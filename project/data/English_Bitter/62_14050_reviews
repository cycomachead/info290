"Overall: I like a fair amount of Geary's product, but this isn't one of them. if I want a Geary's beer in the winter, I'll reach for their porter."

"04/23/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not sure what's up here. Normally I favor 'winter' brews but this has me wondering. There's a dryness in the aftertaste that I'm attributing to an over spicyness. Just as too much cinnamon doesn't taste good without the right amount of sugar, so too, the spices here are unbridled. All that malt & spice w/no sugar creates a bitter aftertaste that's off putting."

"O: I'm really enjoying this. It has a nice kick for a winter time English IPA, and drinks very easily. At $7.99 for a 6-pack, this is a solid deal too. Another option for those who don't enjoy the spiced winter warmers and want something different"
"O: This beer tastes very malty, even when considering it is an English IPA and not an American IPA, but this lends some more body to the mouthfeel making it a nice IPA for the winter."

"Nothing to separate this from the pack of other winter brews out there, but enjoy it if someone offers you one."

"Pours a moderate amber-brown color with an off-white head and some light lacing. The nose carries some caramel and a bit of toffee. Some bready malt in the background. Light vanilla. Not sure this was much of an EIPA. Either way, I appreciated the light malt character throughout. Almost like a barleywine-light. Maybe a faded bottle already? Either way, fairly enjoyable. Caramel and bread through the flavor. Medium body with a pleasant chewiness. Not fantastic or out of the ordinary, but a well-made brew."

"This beer poured out as a nice look amber color. The head was an off white color with a decent retention and lacing. The smell of the beer was hoppy with some sweet malt aromas in there too. The taste of the beer was sweet up front with some basic caramel flavors that were followed up by a hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium bodied and had a nice crisp bite to it. Overall it's more of just a regular IPA than a Winter Ale in my opinion but still not a bad brew."

"O: this is an interesting take on an English IPA, but I like it for the most part, probably come back to it"

"The beer still has a nice coppery appearance in the glass, with a thick, full head. The drinking texture is also very good, with just the right amount of carbonation. Beyond that I found the taste a bit too sweet for my preference. Though if you are a fan of that kind of taste I think you will like this beer - that is if they are still selling it, it may be out of season by now."
"I am not against a vanilla-flavored winter ale; though it's not my favorite style in general, I have had some I quite enjoy. This beer, however, was so strong in the vanilla, that it tasted like the brewer dumped a ton of imitation vanilla extract into each bottle. And for the first time ever, I could not even finish the beer in my glass."
"The feel of the beer is light but medium in body and goes down easy enough with a nice light aftertaste. This beer would be interesting pair with some some with maple syrup or a well buttered pancake."
"Overall- It's not what I would call an IPA."
"I can drink a lot of this beer. It's tasty, not too strong, and readily available this time of year."
"This is more enjoyable than expected. I might actually get this when I'm out on the town some time."
"Drinkability: A good beer overall and one of the more unique IPAs I have had. I would enjoy having this beer again, but it doesn't really seem suited for winter."
"This is a nice beer for the style and a worth a try at least."
"This is a unique and very nice Warmer. It breaks from tradition with a whole different kind of flavor. This has a very smooth creamy Maple/gingerbread taste. Its like a warm serving of liquid waffles. Its certainly not going to be a beer for everyone, but I like it. Smooth, creamy and not too overly sweet."
"However, it is odd for this style and somewhat confusing, it tastes more like a cream ale but I would love to have this again anytime."
"Pretty damn drinkable and a damn decent take on the style... nice choice of a winter ale IMO."
"M/D - decent mouthfeel and carbonation but not much flavor to speak of. I'll have to try this again to make sure it wasn't just a bad bottle."
"D: Just okay, could use a bit more flavor."
"Pale copper with light amounts of carbonation noticeable. Very thin head with a bubbly white collar that leaves sparse amounts of lace. Nice aroma. Fresh yeastiness. Buttery attributes. Some hop notes too. Base is a lot of malt and a lot of yeast. Toffeish and buttery. Hops are minimal, though there is a slight lingering bitterness. Full bodied and lightly carbonated. Decent enough. That's about it. Doesn't compare to Summit's English Style IPA."
"If you looking for a dark beer with Christmas spices this is not your beer. Its a traditional English style ale. The aroma is malty with a slight citrus background. It has a golden amber color and a nice white head. The beer starts with a sweet malt and with a slightly harsh carbonation that brings out the earth hop flavor. The hop flavor is more of a pale ale flavor, but the buttery malt makes is a real English style. What I love about this beer is it's not traditional. Geary's is smart why try and make another dark ale as the HSA and porter are some of the best beers ever created."
"It's fine and different but nothing I would buy again."
"Geary's Winter pours a hazy light copper with a thin but nice head. The aroma is buttery with some grassy, earthy maybe slightly sour bitterness. The flavor is some pale malt up front, with some toffee, but not sweet. The diacetyl comes through quickly and overwhelms the the herbal and grassy hops. The is a solid bitterness, but it seems to lack balance because of the buttery flavor. The mouthfeel is slick and there is a slightly unpleasant aftertaste."
"Medium-to-big bodied, with a light carbonation that makes this beer feel smooth and quaffable. Definitely not Geary's best, but a solid enough beer that I've bought the Winter variety 12-pack twice this year."
"Not much of an IPA (even by English standards) but a big, buttery balanced pale in it's own right. This beer will only go as far one's love for Ringwood."
"This is the January craft bottle of the month at West on Centre in WR. Poured into a pilsner glass. Nice orange color, slightly opaque. Decent sized head. Not as dark as I was expecting for a winter ale. Definite hop aroma. Nice warming hop flavor with a good mouthfeel. A bit hoppier than I would have expected again for a winter ale. This beer was a nice IPA, but just not what I was hoping for when I ordered it."
"D: This beer isn't that good... I wouldn't buy one again. Aside from the Pale Ale, I've never really had a good Geary's experience."
"Cheers!"
"The style classification is somewhat bewildering, seems more akin to pale not enough hop presence"
"D: A subdued, tasty ale that won't win any awards but is a solid offering."
"Overall I'd say not bad."
"Pours a clear amber/golden colour, very thick white head forms, drops some lace rings, and settles to a thin layer, looks alright. Smell is okay, toasty malt, some grain and biscuit, floral, quite fruity, lightly bit of spiciness, oat, not much aroma though. Taste is similar, sweet and toasty at first, some honey, oats and biscuit, floral, light fruitiness, lightly musty, balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Nothing really wrong with it, but just lacks anything flavourful or complex, pretty boring. That being said I wouldn't turn one down if offered. Thanks Kyle!"
"Pours a slightly fogged dull gold. Nose is sweet malts. Slight leafy thing. Flavor is nutty and leafy. It's sweet a bit, but there's a bitter and acrid edge I don't like. Feel is sticky and thick on the liquid and the carbonation. This is decent. Nothing overly interesting. But this might be interesting on cask"
"A light sparkling golden amber colored ale with a fair white head and nominal lacing. The aroma is a pleasantly spicey wheat and clove. The flavor suggests tangy citrus hops and allspice, apple. There's a warm maltiness noted as you go but overall it's fairly dry and tingly. Good drinkability. Very likeable and worth a try. A winter brew that is lively but not heavily alcoholed."
"if this is indeed aiming for an english IPA, and not american, it's not so bad."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, I could easily have 2-3 pints of this although it is not as dark or complex as I would expect from a winter ale."
"Grabbed a six pack while traveling through L-A, ME. Out of the bottle this one was a clear, orange color with a foamy white head. The retention was average, the lacing sub-standard. The aroma was slightly musty and macro-lager like with hints of caramel and toffee. The flavors were ok, but really quite bland. Standard malt, hints of spices and generic hops. Nothing offensive, but totally unimpressive. The body was medium, the mouthfeel slightly prickly and the carbonation medium to high. For a craft beer I though it was pretty crappy and a shame to have to drink six..."
"If I drank this out of a bottle in the heat of summer and it were called a summer ale I wouldn't complain, but thats not the case, and I'm complaining"
"Adequate mouthfeel with very little flavor in the initial hit on the tongue. Turns bitter, but in a stale kind of way. Finishes better than it starts as the hops finally kick in. The finish combines the IPA kick with a winter warmer glow, a strange combination indeed."
"The taste is a touch biting, some leafy hop, but it seems to be faded. There is a decent and full palate of malts to this beer, some earthy, some a bit musty, some bready qualities, perhaps, but the acerbic bite, the yeastiness, and buttery flavors, diminish the maltiness of the beer. The bittering hop lasts too long into the finish and aftertaste. Not a bad beer, I'm not good with calling this a winter ale, but even as an English IPA, this isn't the best one you'll find, for sure. It's okay, nothing great."
"Gave it a shot, but not the best. I wouldn't refuse if offered, and not the worst example, but I won't go out of my way for this."
"Beer has a decent appearance. Smells malty to me, little hop scent. The taste is where it all went wrong. The beer starts off slightly sweet, but finishes watery. mouthfeel is also thin and watery. Overall I was very disappointed with this brew. It's lacking in hoppiness and is watery tasting. It's not a ""bad"" beer, just dissapointing for an IPA. I would not buy it again."
"Intense hop floral finish? Not really. Actually I wasn't completely sure this was considered an IPA. Pours a darker golden color, medium-bodied and a pretty good amount of head on top. A little more malty than hoppy in the aroma. Some hops with a sweet malty taste and doesn't have an agressive hop bite I'd like in an IPA. Decent beer though"
"D: Sorry, a very bland drinking beer and would have to pass on this one. You could safely draino the remainder of the beer and not feel the least bit guilty."
"Drinkability: So-so, it was a bit bland."
"pours a dark golden, decent head and lacing. for an ipa, i'd have to agree that there isn't that in your face kind of aroma. subtle citrus and slight spice. tastes like all the ingredients are there but everything needs to be turned up. subtle is the name of the game here, subtle citrus, subtle pepper spice, slight alcohol taste. very sessionable but not satisfying as a winter beer."
"Not recommended..."
"I actually did not read about this beer before opening it, and was surprised to not find a winter warmer of some sort. Nevertheless, it is a pleasant, well balanced example of a british IPA, my favorite type of IPA. Not spectacular by any means, but quite nice."
"This beer pours a nice dark golden yellow with a tall medium bodied off-white / tan head that laces the glass some. It smells of nice tasted malts, some hoppy bitterness, and some spices. The taste is pretty good with a nice toasted malty backbone underneath some wintry spices - some nutmeg and some citrisy flavors are layered over the malt and a citrisy hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is OK. It has a smooth but dull feel that could use a little more carbonation and maybe a crisper feel. The drinkability is pretty good but it was not what I would want in an English IPA."
"I don't recall it being bitter, but every sip left me with a bitter face, as if my body was anticipating something that wasn't there. I think it was the fact that the feel was not quite crisp, but not leaving much of an aftertaste either. I'm just not sure how I feel about this one. It wasn't really a problem to drink it, but I just don't see myself getting more."
"This one poured a clear, bright orange with a thin off-white cap that fell quickly to a ring. There was a bit of fine, sticky lacing. The aroma was fruity, herbal, grassy, and a little toasty. Medium bitterness with some fruit and malt up front. It finished a little spicy, nearly peppery, with lingering herbal/grassy notes and slight warmth. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation, a little on the dry side. Fairly well balanced with the hops coming on a little strong for an English IPA. Pretty drinkable stuff."
"There's not one single bad thing here. Unfortunately, there's nowhere near enough of what's good either. Flesh it out and it would likely be a fuller and interesting twist on a winter seasonal. Instead, it comes off as an unremarkable, if decently drinkable, session soldier. Maybe I'm overstating it a bit, but it seems there's just no there, there."
"I guess the best way to describe this one is acerbic. It's overly harsh in its bitterness considering there is no flavor to back it up. Not recommended."
"Overall- Tasty and enjoyable but won't be that memorable. Try it if you see it but don't go out of your way."
"Drinkability: This IPA is certainly different than most winter seasonals. It is fairly drinkable, but really lacking in hops to be a good IPA."
"An easy to find beer but I don't remember what it was like. pours a pale golden yellow color. Smells sweet, tastes, a bit citrusy, a bit of malt but tastes a lot like a full flavored lager, not an ale. Average mouthfeel. Overall quite average, like I said it tastes a bit like a lager, looks like one too, but a good one. Not sure if I would really recommend it other than tell a beer newbie to try iy."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is mostly malts, slight spices, and caramel. The taste is malty, spicy, lots of caramel. The finish is slightly dry and a nice little bitter bite to it. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice English IPA, glad to have had a chance to try it, thanks Mark."
"Not ""bad", and has a certain ""drinkability"" to it. But, it's not far from an English Pale Ale with a touch more alcohol noticeablility. Not much of an IPA, or even more - not much of a winter ale. Rather bland and forgettable."
"A decent drinker but nothing really special here."
"Geary's Winter Ale pours brilliantly clear, and golden amber, with a white head that quickly diminishes to a ring of tight bubbles and a thin top. It has a fresh hop aroma that is predominantly green apple and sweet fruit on top of an underlying caramel malt base. Moderate, to moderately light body and carbonation combine to give it a slightly thin mouth feel. Yet, it has pleasant hop flavors and lingering bitterness to assure you that you're drinking an English IPA. I would have liked a little more malt counterbalance, but overall, Geary's Winter Ale is a decent IPA with a big dose of English hops. It's just not big on complexity."
"D: Kind of tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, it’s on the light side for a “Winter Ale” and I can’t think of any other winter seasonals that delve into the EIPA style, so in that, I suppose this beer is somewhat unique. However, keeping that in mind, it is a good representation of the style and a decent beer overall, but nothing spectacular. I thought I’d try it since it was on sale for $2.99 for a sixer."
"Regardless of its flaws, I really enjoyed this and might even seek it out again. Thanks northyorksammy for the trade!"
"Drinkability: Geary's Winter Ale is a very nicely done, hoppy, well-rounded and drinkable ale. It's just a bit bigger than a pale ale, not particularly caramelish at all, and not as bitter as what most think of when they think IPA. However, Geary's Winter is an authentic representation of an English style IPA, or what they used to be until just recently when some of the younger breweries started bumping up their hop charges. A solid brew across the board!"
"Pours a light copper with a small amount of head and little lacing. good head retention throughout the session. doesn't smell like an IPA - has the hops, but is more sweet than citrusy. taste is similar. candied sugar and a little bit of a buttery sensation. light body. not so highly drinkable. just kinda has a weird flavor that i wouldnt really want more than 1 of."
"A sessionable IPA with a solid drinkability level."
"Nice brew, poured a clear amber, sticky white laces were appealing. Good sniff of nice malts and winter spices, although subtle. Solid quaff of a winter warmer  crisp hops and the ginger and coriander were nicely available throughout the bottle. Dry and snappy, I suspected 5.5%, I now see its 6% - so I would say to make this a session brew in anyones book."
"Bottle courtesy of Northyorksammy: Poured a light orangey color ale with a medium foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of sweet malt and light hops is mostly boring. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt and light English hops. Body is a bout average with some average carbonation. I was quite surprise that this is being classified as an IPA and could not have guess by drinking this beer."
"this is a pretty good beer, but not what i would call a winter seasonal, it would need more malt."
"Medium golden body, clear, with a thick film of gauzey white head. Nose is fruity, with apples, bananas, pineapple (all jumbled together). Some toffee and biscuit in there as well, accented by fragrant, herbal hops. Light buttered toast bitterness up front quickly gives way to sweetish, juicy fruit. Kind of sugary. Fruit and sugar wafer are overtaken by moderately bitter hops in the finish. Floral and herbal and nice. Definitely in the English IPA style, with fruity malt forward and hops way to the back. Body is a little thin, but not bad. Solid beer."
"Malty, but I like it. Not too sweet or spiced, with a nice low-key bitter finish. My note to self (before I knew the style) was a hoppy ESB, so basically well balanced with just a bit of a nod to the hops."
"Clear orange gold with a small white head that fell to a few islands and a ring. Nose is slightly floral with a dusty flour hit. The taste starts with an easygoing crispiness that is almost lager like, but then the hop presence comes forward which makes the finish both mildly astringent and dry. Alcohol is not noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish, easily the most satisfying part of the experience. Decent drinkability. Worth a try."
"Overall, this is another very good bitter. I like the dry character that is enhanced by the creaminess of the liquid. While the hop bitterness is understated, it is a very well balanced beer."
"Dull gold color and a weak white head. No aroma worth noting. Taste is fuller and hoppier than the pale but still pretty tame for an IPA. Probably comes up to just below my idea of a pale ale. I know the category is English IPA but it just doesn't do much for me."
"DA: Not bad for the style, I enjoyed the subtle herbed/leafy hop flavor...not every IPA, especially an English IPA has to be a hop bomb to be enjoyed."
"Amber body with thin off-white head. Smells malty and fruity (apricot?). Tastes like apricot, with some malt and floral notes. Medium in body. Rather tasty and enjoyable, but doesnt tast much like an IPA. Reminds me in some ways to DFH Aprihop or Magic Hat #9... I like it."
"Lackluster beer from a brewery that is definitely hit or miss. This one is a definite miss. Not very good at all. Even though I know this bottle to be quite fresh, this just tastes stale and slightly oxidized. Every bottle in the six pack tastes this way, and a friend of mine with a seperate six pack from a different case confirms the flavor. I'm sorry that I bought a whole six pack of this one. Not interesting at all, and not recommended. It may be relatively cheap, but it isn't worth it."
"Not significant head,golden colour, a good floral and spice aroma and spicy aftertaste. The golding and fuggle hops are understated. Appropriate carbonation. Cross style to a winter warmer. mouthfeel on the thin side.I am surprised this was on clearance at Belmont Part Goods in Dayton, maybe it was last year's, but it was good value."
"Drinkability is a little above average. Don't get this an Enlgish IPA or any IPA for that matter but it's not unpleasant just sort of muted and not very memorable."
"This is a fairly recent edition, three years or so now. Hampshire Special Ale was Geary's winter brew, but it's now year-round, and this is the winter offering. It was amber in color with a thick white head and some nice lacing. It had a sweet caramel odor, and was sweet, spicy in taste, with a little bit of hops. Good mouthfeel, and very drinkable. I know it's listed as an English style IPA, but it seems more of a winter warmer to me."
"Sampled 02-17-06 Purchased 6 pack for 9.99 ++ at Ideal Party Store in Bay City, Michiigan. The pour is slight copper with and orange tinge. A medium white head tops it off. The nose is pleasantly spiced with aromas of hop and a touch of pine. Flavor is malt, not overly sweet, dry and spicy, body is drying and the finish is chalky. Nice holiday beer."
"Bought a single bottle on clearance at the local emporium. As others have said this is an IPA rather than what I would traditionally think of as a Winter Ale. Very smooth and drinkable with muted citrus and pine taste characteristic of an IPA. Finish is sweet. Not something I'd reach for when looking for an IPA but a very good beer in its own right. I will look for other Geary's styles the next time I'm out."
"This year doesn't feel so much like winter but it it's always cool to find a nice winter ale to lose yourself in. This one pours with a thinnish head and a nice amber color. The taste is sweet, with a mix of berries, hops, and a little barley, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste. But it goes down smoothly and is definitely worth a second round."
"cheers..."
"Taste = Pretty tasty. Reall ynice balance here. Hops are strong and present as they should be but the sweetness if perfectly toned which creates very good drinkability. There's a bit of floral hops that is interesting and a bit different. I really enjoyed the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel is a little thin but that's the only complaint."
"12 ouncer w/o freshness dating. Pours bland almond , light tan head, minor lacing. Nose is just some musty malt. Medium bodied brew, nothing too exciting going on here, just a decent, middle of the road British style ale. Wonder why they call this a ""winter ale"". Notes of caramel, bready malts and some moderate piney hops late. Enjoyable and drinkable. Decent sessioner."
"This isn't a bad brew by any means, it's just not an IPA and it's a weird choice as a winter brew. I'd call it pretty good overall but nothing to rave about."
"Drinkability... a little below average. I wouldn't get this one again if I wanted an IPA, either American or English. It just didn't seem to fit the style that well."
"Ingredients: Two row English malt (clarity, crystal and wheat); Mt. Hood, Golding & Fuggle hops."
"On-Tap at the wonderful Gilberts chowda house in Portland (Thx Wendell) I had this with a super super freakingly amazingly tasty lobster BLT club sandwich. Mmmm. Anyways, about the beer. It's a light orange colour with a thick white head of pearl coloring. The aromas are all fresh UK golding hops and some spicy, bready, biscuity UK malts. The taste is hoppy up front, but not IPA hoppy. The hops are spicy and meld well with the biscuity British malts. Tasty stuff. The mouthfeel is creamy and the drinkability is good. This is like a pumped up UK pale with nice hopping and good malt flavors. Not what I consider a winter ale, or an IPA, but who cares. This stuff is good!"
"A nice clean orange/amber colored beer. Has a good off white head. A light sweet aroma with hints of fruit. The flavor is light also. With a bit of malt sweetness at the start, some fruity esters in the middle and smooth mild hop bitterness on the finish. Not exactly what one would expect from a winter beer."
"This is a winter beer? Tastes like just a decent IPA to me. Still though, a nice session beer, but Ill go for the H.S.A. next time."
"Overall this isn't a bad brew and certainly has it's good point but even what it does well still suffers from a lack of balance, and there are some subtle flavor shades that just aren't working for me."
"A nice everyday beer for the winter, a simple, easy break from the spices and the Big Beers which abound. No Hampshire Special Ale by any means, however. As to style, while BA and the brewer's site list this as an IPA, a British Bitter might have been closer to the mark. Overall, not bad, but I'd rather have HSA back as their winter seasonal."
"Clear, coppery in hue with a brassy shine as well, the color is lovely. The head was white in color; at the apex the foam reached one finger in height before quickly dissipating to a fizzy cap. There wasnt much subsequent lacing. There isnt much noteworthy about the appearance of this beer. The nose is pleasant, earthy from an English hop influence. Must be Golding and Fuggles. Light citrus notes. The malt construction is equally English. Caramel. Bread. Yeast must be Ringwood. Fruity. Buttery. I found an occasional whiff of alcohol. The potency is modest but the nose is plenty articulate; it helps I like what it is saying. The bouquet is organized just right; Im impressed. Inviting. The palate follows the path the nose setout. Honesty is the best policy, right? I hate beers that lie. This one didnt, so Ill be honest too. The palate isnt as good as the nose, mainly because I dont understand what is going on. Its a bit of a mess. Fruity and spicy at times, there is heat that comes from the alcohol and, it would seem, the yeast. Its like a candy heat; this clashes with the caramel/toffee malt. Hops offer grassy, earthy flavors that do work with the malt and with the buttery, fruity, dirty yeast to a lesser degree. Vague notes of citrus. A suggestion of leaves. Dry at the finish. Woody and sweet. Odd. Overall the palate is okay, it lacks richness what is there to sink my teeth into? Not much. Also, on what planet is this an IPA? I reviewed this bottle without this knowledge and my numbers are based on what I tasted. If I reviewed this as an IPA I would have ripped this beer. My point is this, there is nothing bad about the taste and there are good points too but there isnt anything special about it. Of course not every winter seasonal needs to be a high alcohol/spice/hopped beer; that is not what Im suggesting. This beer is okay. Just okay. Around medium in body, the carbonation is on the low side but the mouthfeel is still decent. It works. Sure, this beer is drinkable. Id have little problem drinking a six-pack of this. If this were a local beer Id buy it yearly. Its a simple but lovely quaff. Thanks ppoitras for the bottle, it was a welcomed addition to the 2004 Secret Santa!"
"pours in my pint glass a fairly light golden color, just a tad darker than say a bud. Nice frothy white head. Very nice looking brew. Aroma is rather weak. Some spicy hops and a creamy maltiness detected, but nothing to blow your socks off. I like the creamy taste of this brew, which goes well with the floral hop aftertaste. I hope this is not a HSA replacement, because it's not up to par with that. Less full & less tasty. Still this is a decent brew with a nice creamy yet carbonated mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"a good drinking brew but it doesnt seem like a winter beer. I would have no problem having this chilled on a nice spring or summer day. it doesnt speak to the season in any category.. it is a pretty good beer, just with a misnomer."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Perhaps I had a bad pint. I will give this beer a try again in the future."
"Pours a rich amber color with a slight haze. The smell is a strong mix of floral English hops and robust malts. Theres a fittingly musty, earthy quality to the smell as well. Very nice indeed. The taste begins with a solid malty sweetness up front, accompanied by a slight warming. Finish is exquisitely balanced with bitterness. It all comes together as a no-nonsense, solidly drinkable beer. Medium to full mouthfeel with a lot of softness. This is one good brew."
"Butter-face=""Nice body...but her face...""."
"ng"
"And P.S., I never noticed it's designation as an I.P.A....didn't feel it, especially as I had a Bell's TwoHearted Ale before this...hops are so small, that this claim is a flat out lie...I've got to go get me some Masala Mama to appease my hop-thirsty tongue!"
"I think Geary's may want to rename a few of their styles. This should be an IPA and Geary's Hampshire Special (though now a year-round brew) should be their Winter style...IMHO."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a malty scent with a small hint of floral hops; nothing special. The taste is pretty damn good. It has a great balance of malts and hops. There seems to be some light crystal malts here along with a generous portion of floral type hops. This is really tastey. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. I think this is a good drinking beer. I would buy this again for sure."
"Poured pure amber with a quarter inch head. Sort of a pale malty aroma. Certainly a robust taste, I feel a grainy spiciness. I like the finish most, as it transforms from a sweet malty flavor into a dry leafy ending. It's not bad, but not incredibly original and not something I would search out to buy."
"The flavor was mostly malt and hop bitterness, but not overly aggressive on either front. The mouthfeel was dry, and the malt seemed to ride the tongue the longest into the aftertaste. Medium bodied and had good carbonation levels. The IPA style definition is questionable here."
"Pours an orangish brown hue with a white head. A balanced quasi-IPA, with a hint of ringwood. A very enjoyable beer. Not quite what I would have expected to replace HSA, but a superb beer none the less. I'd recommend this to anybody who enjoys quality beer."
"Pours a clear copper amber with a nice off-white head. Got that ringwood yeast thing going for it. Malts are round and balanced by a mild crisp hop. I am not understanding of why this is listed as an IPA. 'd rate this beer higher if it were another style, but for an IPA the numbers should be lower. Mouthfeel is nice, quite drinkable beer, but not as hoppy as I was expecting."
"This is an IPA that is all over the map for me. It has the nuttiness of an ESB, the bitterness level that is more of a pale than an IPA and a nicely bitter finish that stays with you. This pours out to a very nice copper color in the glass with lively carbonation and a moderate head. The aroma is light and the taste shows forth essences of pine and nuts with an interesting hop bitterness."
"Tastes like a mild IPA. Slight caramel malt up front followed by a carbonated middle which leads to a slightly bitter hoppy end. Not my idea of a traditional winter brew but it's not bad."
"I think this beer is poorly named; it's light years away from what I think of as winter ale. I don't care, though, because it's wonderful stuff. I love its maltiness, its muscle, and its incredible staying power. If it's this fantastic and full-bodied in the bottle, I can't imagine what it's like on draft."
"Pour is a clear dark copper, with a smallish white head that mostly last, good lacing. Aroma is fruity, buttery, with some earthy hints in the back. Flavor is mostly butterscotch, toffee, with some sweet fruitiness as well. Medium body. Very typical ringwood stuff present here, nothing new or special, IMO."
"Had on tap at the Great Lost Bear...Pour was a dark reddish copper, the head was very light in texture. Aroma was reminiscent of fresh green hops. I thought the mouthfeel was very clean. There's some astringency from the hops. I also picked up more of a grassy hop taste (as opposed to citrus/pine). Pleasant and enjoyable, but I think I liked the Autumn better...the winter is lacking some flavor in comparison imo. pat"
"The label is a mystery. The color is pure amber and it pours with a three fingered, white head that leaves a good lace. No nose, well maybe faint hops. Very smooth. Starts with a good malty/hoppy mix and finishes with just a hint of hoppy aftertaste. This is no IPA - hops that would be ripping your face off are not there."
"(looks up at style) This is an IPA??? Norfolk and Waypal. Too malty, too much fruitiness, not nearly enough bitterness or hop presence. Accept it for what it is (a fruity winter brown) and enjoy."
"Notes: I dont buy it at all that this is an IPA, a good ale to be had but nothing really that special for a winter seasonal  especially replacing H.S.A. as their winter seasonal I expected a bit more."
"Not enough malt for a winter and certainly not enough hops or spice to make up for it. It's smooth and drinkable but that's about it. This is the replacement for Geary's HSA?"
