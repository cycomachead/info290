"O: Unfortunately this beer did not really benefit from being served on nitro - it came out a little too creamy almost like a cream ale. I think this beer would be best served on cask with light amounts of carbonation. Very easy to drink."

"OVERALL: A decent, run of the mill mild. The nitro made it drink like water, and nothing was off but it was surprisingly bland. Even as a fan of milds, I got bored with this one."

"On cask at Churchkey. Served in a pint glass. Pours a nice caramel-copper with a good, lasting white head. Nice sticky lacing. The nose carries some bready, slightly-toasty malt along with just a touch of nuttiness. Good earthy, floral hops in the background then coming through into the flavor. Nice malty base for that, though still fairly thin (without being watery). Light body with appropriate cask carbonation and a smooth bitterness. Well done bitter."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dull amber with decent sustainable whitish head. Nose has a distinct white vinegar note, which is very surprisingly, pleasant and interesting. Flavor is apple cider, mild english green hops, and a very dry finish. There is an acidic astringency that bites the throat as it goes down, but again, not offensive. Lightly sour after the soft very lowly carbonated body. Bitter hop oil lingering finish."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pleasant, nicely balanced, easy-drinking session cask beer for lunchtime."

"Looks fairly standard when poured in the glass - amber-brown in color with really no head but consistent with this style. Smells of apples, bread and other spices - maybe some nutmeg. Taste is wonderful with the same notes hit from the aroma. After many trips to London this is the best delivery of this type of beer west of the Atlantic. What's better is the low ABV - definite session beer."
""
"D - excellent, the best bitter I have had since the last time I was in the UK and honestly better than most even there.  Great yeast character and rich malt with just enough hops to impart the requisite bitterness and keep it balanced.  I'm really glad I got to have it from a cask as that probably made a huge difference."
"Overall: an excellent beer for the style and one of the best casket beers I have had. Highly drinkable which doesnt sacrifice flavor to be so."
""
""
"Very smooth feel, low carbonation, medium bodied. Cask treatment very well done, avoids being at all watery. Feels quite soft in the mouth and goes down easy. A very tasty offering."

"From the cask at London Grill in Philadelphia. Notes from visit on June 1, 2012, the beginning of Philly Beer Week."
""
"Overall – One wonderful session beer. It has good malty flavors mixed with some sweet and hop favors mixed within. Very drinkable."

"Feels like a lot of water in the mouth, and some light tannic effect. not much else."
""
""
"Pour is light amber, little to no head. Sweet caramel malts and some thanksgiving spice with hints of pepper and sugar. Taste is caramel malts being taken by iced tea with some light peppery spice and a touch of hearbal hops. Creamy body, low carb from cask, a touch oily. Iced tea flavor dominates and is not my cup of tea."

"The beer appeared a very nice, clear copper color with hints of red with a great, thick, creamy, slightly off-white head. The head was fairly well retained but eventually faded into nothing. No noticeable carbonation. The aroma was mild, mostly malty with a hint of yeast. The taste of the beer was great, extremely well balanced and the fact that the beer was served at a warmer temp really made the beer more enjoyable. The beer had a medium body, creamy, smooth and exceptional drinkability. Overall, this is a fantastic beer and I hope that I get to enjoy this one again."
"Hand-pumped into a pint glass, this ESB was a clear, golden brown, fairly low carbonation, with a small head of delicate, white bubbles that completely disappeared before the end of the drinking session. Lots of caramel and yeast in the nose, very clean and fresh. Nice taste, with caramel and honey, bready yeast, and a great balance of hop bitterness that makes this beer distinctive yet very accessible. Medium body, a bit chewy, and left a bit of syrupy film in the mouth. Overall drinkable and enjoyable."
"definitely an easy drinking session beer."
"Had on cask at Victory. Has a citrus hop nose. Pours a light amber, mostly gold color. Nice frothy head with suds that lace the glass. Taste is mostly pale or base malt. Would like to see more of a malt-like character whether biscuit or bread or light caramel. I think the hops mask the malts. Nice light to medium mouthfeel. Great drinkability."
"Got a half pint of this from the cask at Victory Brewing Co. A beautiful beer, an amber-golden body with a fluffy 1/2 fingered head. Having this beer at a warmer temp from the cask really enhances the smoothness of this beer. This bitter really is spectacular and it has a bit more cone hop presence than others which makes it quite appetizing. The light caramel malt backbone holds up the extra bitterness from the hops, leading to quite an impressive brew. Very smooth and silky, drinking the head is like diving into a cloud!"
"Relatively recently at Rattle 'N Hum's Victory promo...about 2 months ago. Poured a translucent gold, with less than a finger of white, and less than stellar retention and lacing. No visible carbonation wasn't surprising, given the cask origin. The smell was a robust bouquet of rosemary and other spices that I couldn't place, mixed with grass and sugary apple. The taste was very nice as well, tasting more like a saison rather than a bitter, and finishing on a dry apple note. Non-carbonated, smooth texture, and surprisingly thin which certainly aided its sessionability. Fantastic session brew. It definitely tasted as if the folks from Victory used the hops left over from brewing Saison du Buff to brew this great beer, given the herbal/spicey profile. No complaints here."
"D - With the combo of the low ABV and toned down flavors this one is highly quaffable. I could literally drink this all day."
"I had on cask at the brewpub, served in an imperial pint. The beer is hazy straw in color with a delicate little white head. The nose is earthy and hay like. It has a creamy mouthfeel and subtle flavors, hay, sweet malt and a pleasant breadiness. The beer finishes with light bitterness. I know understand why people have to have bitters on cask, a really well done brew."
"Pours a relatively pale and lightly hazed straw color with a cap of white head with big bubbles from the hand pump pour. Scent is light and made up of bread, nuts, flowers, honey, toffee and earth. Taste suprised me, the light color and scent decieve as the components of scent come forward and make a nice, nearly full flavored beer. The cask pour makes for a creamier mouthfeel with lighter carbonation, great for the style. A very nice, flavorful mild bitter, maybe second only to Yards Brawler in the 4% range in terms of flavor, with slightly more complexity."
"Wow. I was blindsided by this one. I was not expecting such a flavorful beer when I ordered this one. Floral and fruity aromas and whiffs of grain. Nice full and fluffy white head. Palate is clean and refreshing with light citrus and floral hops. Just enough dry bitterness to compliment the cracker flavor of the malt and yeast. With great flavor, and at a sessionable 4%, this is a clear cut winner and a great cask offering."
"Given the above criticisms, drinkability is pretty high. If you like honey flavor, you'll like this. Ultimately, the flavors are mild and inoffensive, and the lack of carbonation and low ABV makes this a pretty easy drinker."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink; when combined with the low alcohol content it makes it perfectly sessionable."
"The beer poured a clear light amber with a fine white head. The aroma is of malt with slight floral hops and vanilla undertones. The taste is sweet malt with a nice hopa finish. The feel is medium and a bit oily with a dy finish. I could drink these all night."
"Especially during my last hurrah there, I had to get a random cask selection at the CK. My brother helped me choose this one. It pours a slightly hazed pale straw topped by a tiny smattering of bubbles yearning to be taken seriously as a head. In vain, I say. The nose comprises strawberry, ginger, candi sugar, flowers, and caramel. The taste is surprisingly simpler, considering the smell: Notes of wheat, flowers, and corn are all that make up the assault on my 'buds. This meager list does well, though, even if not very far. The body is light, with no real carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice bitter, as simple and understated as it gets, while still keeping my interest."
"Beer is clean and creamy, moderately bitter with nice smooth mouthfeel and great midpalate flavors. not a lot of sweetness just a good all around beer. Nothing odd or extreme, just a good cask ale."
"Beautiful amber in color with a dense, soft, off-white head with just phenomenal retention and lacing, this is an outrageously beautiful beer. The nose is outstanding. Toffee, butterscotch, caramel, minerals, earth, mild minty and a touch of fruity English yeast, this puts the craft back into ""craft beer"". The palate opens with butterscotch, vanilla and caramel with some minerals coming through. Drying finish with earthy and herbal hop character, this beer is medium-light in body with a soft carbonation and is just eminently drinkable."
"It's easy (or at least easier) to make a great tasting beer with 10% or more alcohol.... but a beer with this much flavor and 4% alcohol is a rarity. Exceptional. Well done Victory...."
"Drinkability: This is a good, well made bitter that I've enjoyed drinking and that I'll be having again."
"D - a god representation of the classic style, but just not doing enough for me. crazily drinkable though, thanks to an extremely light body and mild taste. a good first beer for happy hour while waiting for friends to show up, before moving onto some bigger guns."
"A lot of time when I order a beer from a cask, I really get the feeling that the brewer just threw a beer into a cask without really thinking about whether that beer belongs there or not. Uncle Teddy's Bitter is not this way. It is perfectly suited to be drank at room temperature from a hand pump."
"D - Crazy good - SO drinkable -I almost gave this a five, but I still was compelled to try several of the 15+ beers at the brewpub so it didn't keep me locked in, but it could have."
"Like i said at 3.9% combined with the super smoothness, i could drink about 20 of these things. (except for the fact its $4.00 a pint)."
"Dr. Very, very drinkable. Had we not been on bikes and sitting on a warm, humid patio, I'd have had another or two."
"For my first beer of the night- this one really did it for me. If there weren't so many other great Victory brews to try I would've likely sat down at the bar and had at least 4 more of these. Orange-ish in color with little head. The aroma is pretty simple- some light malts and a very faint hop smell. This was a very simple, palatable beer- the bitter kick was so subdued compared to my previous experience with bitters- perhaps that's the result of something I can't quite put my finger on. The beer being deliciously warm mellowing it out? I don't know. It had a nice bready flavor with a little caramel malt as well. Mouthfeel was light to medium with little carbonation. Drinkability...well that was off the charts."
"Don't drink and review."
"A nice English-style cask conditioned ale - beautiful golden-copper color with a thick creamy head. Nose shows a strong hop floral presence for a mild. Taste as well - smooth and creamy with a too-strong hop back note for a mild - kind of a mild and one half. Good finish, this is brewed as a session beer and does not disappoint."
"A decent bitter, but far from my favorite. The hops weren't quite as assertive as I would have expected, and the yeast is a bit too upfront."
"Drinkability - 5"
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"All in all this beer is one of my favorites on cask. Recommend it to all."
"Overall- A beer I've been wanting for a few years now. Lived up to what I was hoping for. If you visit Victory pass on the food and drink 1 of these."
"A really solid example of a Bitter from Victory that keeps a decent amount of flavor packed in while still maintaining that lower ABV. I love the fact that they keep this on cask at all times now at the brewery as the silky body only adds to it's immense sessionalbility. I'm always up for a pint or six of this when we visit."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured amber with a decent head and decent clarity. Smelled mostly gentle and nutty with some light roasted malt aromas. Very nice taste. Creamy, nutty, well balanced, with a nice earthy bitterness to finish. Some slight herbal notes of sage as well. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with an herbal, dry finish. A little rich for the style, but still quite a nice beer."
"Pours a reddish amber that is fogged. Creme head that stays. Nose is hoppy and slightly woody. Flavor is just as described: ""cask-ish"". Hops are definitely there. Smooth and nice. Definitely bitter, but in a smooth way. Feel is very smooth. Great carbonation and a smooth liquid. Overall a great treat to be able to have.Well worth trying."
"D - a real joy. Incredibly sessionable and look forward to enjoying this again at some point"
"Definitely recommended. This could even be a very good gateway beer as it doesn't assault the palate with overdone hops or alcohol."
"A delightful surprise. This would make for an awesome session beer."
"This ale was very smooth and easily drinkable from the cask. If I see it available again, I shall drink more of it."
"A great session beer I hope to see more of this from victory"
"Served in a .4 liter glass from a beer engine - brewed with German malts and Styrian and Kent Goldings hops. It arrives at the table a lightly-hazed caramel, with low carbonation and an inch of creamy head that deposits nice lacing. Gently hoppy in the nose, with a sturdy backing of toasted and biscuity malts. Similar on the palate, with notes of citric/grassy and leafy/spicy hops. It has a medium body that is smooth and creamy, low in carbonation, and leaves a medium, hoppy finish. Very enjoyable ale, with excellent mouthfeel and flavor. Definitely give this one a try if you see it at the brewery."
"D: I have at least one every time it is on at the brewery. One of my favorite beers. Something that could be drunk all night long."
"Victory has done it again, this will be a staple from now on every time I make my way to Downingtown."
"d: Made for sessioning and hits the mark."
"D - Pretty standard British-style ESB with Kent Golding hop profile. Not a bad cask offering from Victory. Not my favorite ESB, but I'd have another, especially on cask."
"Appears a clouded amber orange hue forms a vibrant creamy tan head. Froth and thick with thick even bands of lacing that develop with each sip, good cask conditioned gets harder to come by in the Burgh as time goes on. Bars that used to carry a cask or two don't anymore it's really a shame. Well, this flowing at Fathead's and as soon as I saw it I knew what I would drinking at least a few of. Aroma has roasted caramel with nutty edges herbal funky UK hops with just a finish of piney hoppiness. Flavor is mildly bitter nothing overplays anything else. Session beer at it's best can't hide any off flavors in a brew like this definitely a technical display of talent. That slick oily rush of hops quickly disperses with the roasted malt nut flavors, like a said just a clean drinkable mix of flavorful beer were both sweetness and hop flavor have multiple dimensions. Mouthfeel is of course the strength of most cask beers, and this one is no exception. Creamy fluffy body with hop oils streaking the palate natural light carbonation goes down with such ease, no alcohol burn when it's 3.5-4% abv. Drinkability anytime I see this one flowing, hopefully next time I belly up to a long wooden bar in Downingtown that would be a nice place to meet up with this brew again."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish color with a off white head. Aromas that are hoppy and a sweet maltiness. In the taste there is a small bitter, a sweet maltiness and a nice presence of fruitiness. A light bitter, yet mellow mouthfeel and a dry, sticky bitter aftertaste. A nice session-y bitter, a bit light and water in taste, but easy to drink."
"D: This is one helluva session beer, easy to drink with a great flavor. I was tempted to waste my night in Downingtown, downing pints of this beer."
"D- A great beer that is only available at the brewery. This one goes high on my list of session beers. It was so good I stayed alittle longer at the pub so I could have another!"
"I very, very special brew, to be sure. Pale in colour, this offering presents in all it's gravity fed glory. Fantastic notes of bready goodness and mild fruity hops to balance this highly quaffable brew. Smooth on the palate - to say the least - the hops played a predominant role on the tongue, but was balanced with some nice biscuitiness. The prototypical session brew if there ever was one."
"Drinkability: Excellent example of a style that is rarely brewed on these shores"
"Hazy caramel/orange colour with a super-dense, cream coloured head. Great retention and thick, solid rings of lace were left behind at each sip. Sweet caramel and citrusy, piney hop aroma. Solid bitterness throughout with plenty of malt up front, fresh grain character, and a bit of hop character. Low carbonation with a slight astringent graininess. An excellent session brew that really shines in the cask format."
"Served a medium copper colored beer with creamy white head. Smell is superb with a nice mixture of malt and hops. Taste is even better than the smell with the malt and hops forming an excellent balance. Finished with a moderate dryness that is supremely refreshing. The perfect session beer with modest alcohol content, great taste and perfect drinkability. Definitely a winner."
"Cheers!"
"Feel is 100% smooth."
"This beer came a bright golden brown with an off white creamy head that had a Guinness like cascade effect going on that left some nice lacing. Smelled of oatmeal, sour dirty pineapple and maple syrup. Tasted of creamy corn, smoky caramel, copper and grass that faded into a pleasant dryness that tingled my tongue. Mouth feel was very light and thin with very tiny bubbles. I could definitely knock back a few more of these!"
"On cask at CAH. Pours a hazy orange...I let it sit and had another brew while I waited. The bartender had the decency to not sit this on the ice rail. Small head and gobs of lace. A little aspirin in the flavor, but dominated by a mild malt smoothness. Medium mouthfeel with a big smooth finish. This is one of the easiest drinking brews I've had in awhile. Buttery and wonderful. Recommended."
"Cask Draught @ Victory: This one pours a clear golden color. Mine was pulled with a thick, creamy head on top. There was a good amount of lacing. The nose is light and consists of a bit of malts and spiciness. The taste is very good. It is a somewhat dry malt taste, with a good amount of hops that results in no sweetness but limited bitterness. A tad biscuity also. This was also served at cellar temperature. An excellent session beer."
"Overall - One of my favorites from by far, my favorite brewery. Incredibly delicious stuff from the hand pump.."
"Quite drinkable. Enjoyed while touring VICTORY t'nite."
"This beer shows Victory's incredible versatility. They do big-beers well. But they do medium-strength beers well. And they do these small beers well also. My hat is off to them. Bravo!"
"Victory scores again with this bitter, tasted like an ordinary bitter to me which not many US brewers dare to touch being that it is such a delicate style to tangle with. A good rounded malt sweetness throws toasted crackers and a mild fruitiness to the taste buds. Hops were at a impeccable level of balance. The cask-conditioned smoothness was so impressive that I wanted to quaff this one all night. Great job guys!"
"I really enjoyed my experience with this beer. A session beer that can be enjoyed pint after pint after pint. I once thought that cask beer's appearance was unappealing, but not any more. I think cask ales are a beautiful thing to behold. A very nice fruity yeast flavor with just enough hops to barely overpower the malt in this beer. I'm not sure how this would be in a bottle or from a keg, but from the cask, it was excellent."
"Had this on the hand pump at the brewery and was glad I did. Poured a hazy gold (haze mostly due to carbonation) with a nice bright white foam layer on top. Aroma was pretty subdued but hinted at apples and pears with a dash of malt sweetness. Very mild tasting with no overly strong flavors and a very clean finish. Hints of pears and apples and the malt sweetness carried over from the nose. Mouthfeel was amazingly smoothe going down. A truly impressive feat and something I have not experienced very often in a beer. Could easily drink a lot of this and not get sick of it. If you go to the pub, you MUST try this one...of course, you could say that about all their beers."
"One of the most authentic domestically produced English-style bitters; and an ""ordinary"" to boot! Once it's settled from the handpump pour, the body is a hazy golden with an orange cast that's topped by a thin cap of creamy bright white foam that holds quite well and leaves some lace. The aroma is limited but offers a subtly fruity, mostly malty character with a light earthiness that's probably contributed to by hops although they're not distinct. The flavor is quite mild combining a soft, clean thin maltiness with a light floral and earthy hop flavor. The body is light with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's extremely smooth and lightly creamy. The finish continues much as it started but without the sharper hop flavor. The bitterness is very well balanced and does just enough to keep the pint interesting. Serious session brew!"
"Poured from handpump, creating a smooth creamy beer. Very drinkable, silky mouthfeel. Lacks the snappy flavor of Victorys single hop ESB. Great beer if your not in the mood for a very aggressive style. Mild malts, citrusy hops - excellent session brew."
