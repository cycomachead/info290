"O: This would be an ideal beer to drink on a deck under the hot sun. I enjoyed it."

"Pours a hazy golden with a good bit of thick, off-white head that falls and leaves a solid cap on top of the beer. The aroma is faint, led by a sweet, toasted biscuit malt character. Hop aroma comes through as slightly lemon. The taste follows suit, with a dry, cracker malt taste and a grass and lemon hop profile. It has a light to medium body and rounds out with a clean dryness, aided with a touch of bitterness. A very delicately balanced beer with nothing standing out or seeming to compete with any of it's other flavors. Nothing spectacular, but refreshingly clean and a well made example of the style."
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink and its low alcohol content makes it very sessionable. The bitterness is nicely balanced by the underlying malts."
""
"Notes: A great Bitter, lots of funkiness and character. Good stuff."
"O- I am beginning to love these English Style lower abv. with subtle hop flavors playing off the subtle malt flavors. At times these beers become less is more. This beer was awesome, very nuanced and complex in it's own way. I truly enjoyed it and wish that I could get it on cask or in a 6 or 12 pack, I just want to have bunch of pints."
"A very good session beer. Sometime this is all you need in a beer!"
"A decent bitter with a great aroma. Nice use of aromatic hops, while the malt and bitterness are well balanced. Live yeast adds depth to the flavour. Drinkable and worth sampling."
"This beer was pumped out of a cask, the color was a golden yellow and it had a thin white head on it. There wasn't much lacing at all. The smell was grainy and had a subtle hop aroma. The taste was mild upfront and finished with a nice dry bitterness. The mouthfeel was a bit watery. Overall it's a decent bitter but nothing too great."
"d - really drinkable. I wish this was more widely available and on tap..."
"D: nice English session brew. worth trying, but not world class. Could easily down a few."
"D - This is a highly drinkable beer in a highly drinkable style."
"M & D - Very light and drinkable. Nice malt backbone and good hop finish."
"I should have bought two, this goes down easy."
"Slainte."
"Bright orange and a bit hazy with a short, lasting head. Some short-lived lacing too. Malty and biscuity aroma, hops were grassy and a bit citrusy, a bit floral. Bitterness was solid throughout, more biscuity malt, citrus and floral hop flavours lingered. It was perhaps a bit too dry. Light bodied with average carbonation. I quite liked the flavour profile of this beer. Slightly less attenuation would help make it more drinkable and well rounded."
"Drinkability? Great drinkability and why the hell not! Low in alcohol and plenty of flavour. What's not to like? I wish I had picked up more than 1 bottle."
"Perhaps the only issue is $6 a pint... there are a lot of fine beers out there on which I can drop $6.. so this one has a lot of competition."
"Drinkability: A sufficient, decently refreshing, though not exemplary brew, it's certainly more appealing than all that goofball X-mas stuff their churn out at year's end."
"Not overly impressed to be honest, pleased it wasn't a pint bottle."
"D- Very drinkable and would like to put down a few later if readily available."
"D: A delicious and session-worthy bitter. I wish it was cheaper, came in six packs, and easier to find."
"I wish that we had more good English bitters and milds sold in this country. This beer is pleasantly light with a clean, fresh flavor. It would make for an excellent session beer. It pours a bright, light orange with dark yellow highlights and a wonderfully creamy head. The aroma is lightly citric with an excellent light malt presence. While it's very well-balanced, there is still a noticeable hop focus. The feel is soft and creamy with gentle bitterness. I imagine that it's great from the cask. Drinkability is very good."
"From the 1 pt. 9 fl. oz bottle no. F10-077. Sampled on April 30, 2009. It pours a slightly hazy copper-yellow with a modest creamy off-white head. It is a bottle conditioned beer so the cloudiness is not unexpected. The aroma is fresh and grassy with a little dab of hops. It is not an offensive aroma but I think I expected something a little more. It feels lie honey on the tongue but it has nothing resembling that in the taste. The taste is nice and bitter with a hint of something tart taking up the rear. A pretty good English Bitter."
"I had this 4/17 at Dek's. Gravity firkin. It appeared to be a light golden color in my pint and the slight aroma of vanilla and fruit elements came to mind. It was lighter than I expected and a little watery with slight floral hops in the nose. It was very easy to drink as we joked about the hole in my pint glass. I liked the low abv as it provided a relief from the higher ones like DFH 90, which I had after wards. I hope to try the bottle version soon to test the differences."
"Conclusion: I don't know if I got a bad bottle or what, but this was incredibly unsorted and just plain WEIRD...I poured 2/3 of it down the drain, and that's sacrilege for me..."
"An easy-drinking ale with a nice, subtle, well-balanced flavour. A bittering touch in the finish. Could see myself drinking plenty of this on-cask in an English pub!"
"Overall: Lacks a much-needed pronounced bite. Started off ok at first, but at the end I found myself having trouble finishing the over-excessive 22oz. bottle."
"Had a bottle at Moan and Dove. A murky orange look with some patchy lacing throughout drinking. Generally thin head. Citrus orange flavors are weakly permeated from the drink; enough to be apparent but nothing too strong. A dull bitter taste with a decently bready flavoring in the taste department. It was incredibly refreshing, though, with a great crispness to it. Overall, a bit too uneven, but still decent."
"Light bodied with a good carbonation to match, this beer is an easy drinker. Save for the price, a great session ale. Overall, an easy drinker, light bodied and easy to put back a few, but a little thin in flavor. Doesn't really stand out as anything superb, but still a good beer to spend a bit with."
"Overall a solid bitter. Not the best in the world, but I'd have it again on tap. I may pick up a bottle somewhere again if the price is right."
"The taste is bready malt up front with mild sweetness. Mildly bitter hoppiness with light citrus (mostly lemon), and hints of herbs/leaves and pine rapidly complement this before a hoppy, floral finish leaving a pleasant floral atfrertaste with hints of bread, lemon, and honey. It's crisp and lively, yet still has a fairly full-bodied feel. It is very refreshing, smooth, balanced, exceedingly drinkable and satisfying."
"An easygoing ale that I could drink just about any time of day."
"Poured a dark gold with almost no head and a lot of carbonation. There was a large hint of sulfur in the scent that mostly covered up the hoppiness of the beer. It had a bitter/hoppy taste, but it, too, was covered up with a sulfur/egg flavor. (Yes, I checked, it had not expired.) It was fairly smoothly, but not close to the best bottle (or even bottle-conditioned) English bitter I've ever had."
" This brew is refreshing and clean, very bitter with malt that will stand up to it but not a malt lovers bitter. Hopheads should try it but I won;t pay 6 bucks for it again I don't believe."
"Very nice and a good example of an English Bitter. Full flavored, light bodied, and with a low ABV, this could easily keep me entertained at the bar for hours."
"D-Excellent, true to style. Very solid and totally quaffable. Could easliy sit at the pub and drink this pint after pint."
"D - Certainly drinkable, but a bit of a letdown compared to other cask offerings I've had. Very thin body, but had a nice mild flavor."
"Pretty good, just a little sour for my taste to be truly great. That drying ability, though, is wonderful. I would drink this again for that great sensation alone!"
"This is a very classic British style bitter. It pours a deep, almost orangish color with a slight bit of haze. This is a bottle conditioned ale but it doesn't have the yeasty bits floating about, nor any sediment on the bottom of the bottle. The head is off white and doesn't retain all that well. The smell is malty, some piney hop notes, and a bit of floral aroma too. The taste is quite dry, nicely balanced between malts and hops, and with a bit of a minty flavoring as well. The beer is moderately carbonated, fairly light bodied, and very refreshing. The mouth feel is very watery and at 4% ABV, you can drink lots of this beer. It's very drinkable, enjoyable, and well worth seeking out for a nice introduction to the style. L'Chaim."
"A very easy to drink beer, much more so than I was expecting. Would make a great session beer. Overall I was quite surprised and pleased by this Ridgeway Bitter and would not hesitate to pick some up again and share with friends."
"Drinkability - Highly refreshing with a balanced taste. Very drinkable, I would drink this as a session beer all night!"
"D- I could see myself enjoying this in any number of situations. Quite easily drinkable. I wouldn't mind if this was my local pub's brew."
"This beer pours an orange-amber color with a generous head. The smell is yeasty and floral, with a crisp end. The taste is surprisingly complex for a bitter...it starts much like apple juice with not a hint of alcohol, and very little discernible carbonation. As it goes down there is more fruit that comes to the forefront, like pears and orange. The after taste incorporates the same yeastyness that was in the smell, and the bitter tongue lingers for long after its swallowed. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great."
"Thin and fizzy in the mouth, high carbonation is very crisp. Finishes with similar flavors, good drinkability. Not a bad brew."
"...mouthfeel is far too fizzy and over-carbonated, especially for the style. Really hurts the overall drinkability of the brew although I'm sure I'll have little problem finishing the pint."
"The beer poured a lifeless copper with an off white head. The aroma was simply of light malt. The taste was of light sweet malt with a hint of better in the finish. The feel was medium and dry. This one started off a bit weak, but as I drank it grew on me and was suprisingly good, a very delicate beer."
"D- I would probably prefer this more if it were fresher."
"D: Good thirst quenching English bitter. Easy to drink but with enough going on to remaining interesting."
"While I don't love Ridgeway Bitter as much as I love Ridgeway IPA (once a hophead, always a hophead), it's a beautiful beer that is the very definition of the English bitter style, at least as I understand it. I would dearly love to work my way through a succession of pints, on-cask of course, during a warm sunny afternoon in Oxfordshire."
"Overall: A very interesting English Pale Ale; the Marris Otter Malt is no surprise but the mix of Challenger and Boadicea hops most certainly is. Solid stuff."
"D- good brew. Doubt I would get it again unless not much else."
"Pours transparent brown with very large soapy white head, lots of small bubbles, thin lacing. Smells of fresh leafy hops and light caramel malts. Pleasing combination of nuanced flavors; caramel malts, hard mineral water, slightly dry leafy hops, and lightly toasted biscuits. Quite light and strongly carbonated in the mouth; becoming a bit creamy and chewy as it warms. A very gentle but tasty pint that makes a sociable accompaniment to lunch."
"good drinkability, a unique, but pleasant bitter."
"(11.2 oz. /330 ml)"
"Light, malty flavor, somewhat herbal and possessing an oddly astringent character. There's a strange bitterness that doesn't come across as hop bitterness. The beer struck me as strangely dry for a english bitter, as though the malt couldn't keep up with some of the other nuanced flavors. All in all, feels a bit unbalanced. The slight, tangy sharpness feels at odds with the smooth characteristics that I expect from english bitter, impeding drinkability."
"Served from a 500 ml English looking bottle. In appearance this is a dark golden ale with a large off white frothy head. Aroma is rather subdued, slightly earthy, maltiness, some tinges of hoppiness. Malty , earthy tastes dominate, then a slight hoppy tatse and a longer lasting hop after tate, perhaps from the fresh hops. Pretty thin on the palte, well carbonated. A good drinkable bitter, but at the price we pay over here i could not say it was a session ale..but if in Oxford this would keep my intrest for several pints."
"Well, this is very easy to drink. At 4% I could session with this beer easily. I wonder if I can get this in Omaha. Ive seen other Ridgeway beers. Anyway, I really like the simplicity this beer offers. It really hit the spot. Thank you Daniel for the bottle, I liked it a plenty."
"Overall): This is just what I was wanting tonight, a flavorful beer that's not overpowering and not high in alcohol."
"Selection of the beer-of-the-month club. Poured a medium amber color with massive white head. Lots of carbonation also noted. Smell is mildly malty but enjoyable. Taste follows through with a pleasant maltiness sweetness mixed a with a slight hoppiness. The combination of malt and hops present an excellent finish, being thirst quenching yet begging for another taste. Perfect drinkability. Would be the perfect session beer."
"This is a very mild bitter."
"Drinkability: The light body and crisp maltiness are good, but the bitterness seems to persist just a bit much for this to be a really great session beer."
"500 mL, bottle conditioned, best by 5/28/06 - certified by CAMRA as a real ale. Pours a bright amber/copper that is perfectly clear and it's topped with a fleeting off-white 1 finger head. The color is beautiful but the head is lacking (dirty glass?). It smells grassy/spicy with grapes, pineapple?, diacetyl?, toasty malts, and other, perhaps tropical, fruit notes. It has a medium body and tastes grassy/spicy/leafy and maybe some skunky from the hops. It's followed by a good bitterness, fruits, pineapple?, and maybe some citric/herbal qualities. Overall pretty tasty but it just doesn't seem like it's worth it at almost 5 bucks a bottle."
"Clear, bright gold, a couple stray bubbles half-heartedly trying to form the semblance of a collar, leaving the beer entirely naked after a couple sips. Nearly no aroma, probably due to the lack of head. A vague floral, melon-ish fruity whiff. What is there is decent enough. The flavor opens with a mild, very easy drinking pale maltiness. Toasty, with a touch of minerally flavor and a bit of bacterial funkiness. Slightly infected cask? Subtle, melon-like fruit, easing into a passive, floral hop finish. That bit of funkiness isn't bad, but the slight, vague sourness in the finish kinda ruins the drinkability for me. It's such a delicate beer that it overpowers the other flavors very easily. Great carbonation level, just a soft sparkle, pleasant when coupled with the light body. Smooth drinkin' stuff. Light, yet flavorful, this is what session ale is all about. I just wish it were a bit cleaner. I'll definitely try it again next time I see it."
"Clear light yellow-gold in color. Beefy white head that sat up and left nice, thick rings of lace. Aromas are sweet with a bit of skunk and earthen-grassy bitterness. Flavor is dry and somewhat bitter. There a subtle base of malt sweetness...a toasted brown sugar flavor. Finishes dry and has a good dose of bitterness on the palate. Thin, but not to the point of being watery. Drinkable."
"Poured a light golden with a small white head that was gone pretty quickly,aromas are Gldings hop driven quite herbal and minty with a lighlty sweet brown suger malt note as well.A nice bitter here subtly complex a good mix of toasted grain quite dry malt base with a nice herbal quality in the finish that lingers nicely.A touch of mineral adds to the depth of this beer,it gldes down smooth and would be the perfect sociable pint ale.Iam sure a gem on cask,quite nice I would buy again for sure."
"Light golden brown color, slightly opaque in presentation. Big fuzzy head is pillow-like and rises to over an inch. Laces in dots and small strings. Sharp aroma, weedy, maybe a touch skunked. Mouthfeel is light and gets lighter, carbonation is higher than I like it. Malt profile is quite brief, astringent lemon tones take over, senses of pepper, arugala, even cilantro. Finishes thinner but with a lot of the excessive carbonation still in effect. I like softer Bitters, I figure concessions are made to bottle condition and ship, but this comes off as a little gassy and strident."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt (Maris Otter) scent along with some light bitterness and a mild yeast fruitiness. The taste is good. It has a very dry bitter flavor that boasts of Maris Otter malts and leaf hops. It goes down easy with a bit of fruitiness and a wet cardboard finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good English bitter. It's bitter, but nothing too intense as well as having a good malt base; well balanced."
"Hell of a lot of carbonation in this beer. Thick head. Bubbles ripping their way to the top of the beer. The color is a fairly clear copper, with just the lsightest haze. Aroma is mostly of malts. Flavor is pretty decent. Lots of bittering hops throughout, followed nicely with a real woody varnish flavor. Some pine and other aromatic tones; slightly toasted malts. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but the bitterness has a broadening effect to the palate. Nice and easy drinking."
"Tawny orange with a nice, crispy rock of foam. Leafy notes reminiscent of mint, epazote and sorrel top off zesty, succulent impressions of cherry, tangerine, orange and caramel. Windy, carnival fizz -- ambitious if impermanent -- splatters noisy fresh and preserved fruit flavors along with oatmeal cookie. Airy, light and dry. Champagne physique. Toasted nuts and fruits for flavor. Bitterness is earthy and permanent. Hot weather Bitter for sure. I like the terroir."
"Overall- a very good beer yet not as strong as it should be. Fullers ESB much better!"
"On cask at the gingerman in NYC, a nice light orange color, small head that holds OK. Good hoppiness in the smell, some undertone of malt. Nice. Disappointing taste. Very thin. Needed alot more body. I would have another, but with 60 choices on tap, not here."
"A light yellow colored beer at Monk's. Hops there, and the dryness of the leaf. Nutty aroma, perhaps the glass had just been in chlorine. Taste rather off, strange hops and herbal flavor of a tea I could not finish. The sweetness of honey and malt did not redeem it."
"Slick mouthfeel with low carbonation. A pleasant, light-bodied quaffable session ale."
"Had this on cask the other night. The brew was pulled to vibrant golden color with a fairly dense white head that had pretty good retention and left a fair amount of lacing. This is a very malty beer, it definitely seems to dominate but I am able to pick up scents of hops with an earthy/grass like note that really co-mingle very nicely. The tastes are highlighted by a malty caramel flavor that is strongly accented by a hop taste that seems to linger a bit. Nice brew, one I would get again, but not one that I would classify as exceptional.."
" A bit watery as per style, with very chalky dryness on the finish. A classic session bitter served the way it was brewed to be."
"A pretty good ale, i'd like to try this on cask"
