"Very sorry I went to this pub.  Food was ok.  But the beers were mediocre to poor."

"I was surprised by how good this brew is. Will definitely have more."
"O - Not and ESB at all, no bitterness, how could it be an ESB? Its style is more like an extra pale ale."

"one of the better beers at grittys I though, which isn't saying a whole lot, but this classic bitter and amber style fusion worked out pretty well. pours a lighter amber color, flat though, like all beers I had here. smells like light English pale and crystal malts, with the same ale yeast as the others, and a pronounced English hop finish, which is this beers best feature. the taste is the same as the nose, lighter than it looks, sessionable more than any other beer they had. carbonation is severely lacking, as it has the texture of tap water. plenty of body for the style, maybe a nitro tap would liven this up, but it just sits there dead. still, one of grittys better beers, went well with the food, and didn't offend me like their ipa did, so that's a start."

"Served on cask and poured in a true pint, the beer is a clear, pale chestnut coloring with a light, foamy, frothy off-white head of about a half an inch. Aromas of rich toffee and caramel, with a slight roasting characteristic overall. Flavors are smooth, with toffee and butter sweetness, and a kiss of chocolate. Hops presence is extremely minimal, with only a hint of bitter at the tail end. The hops presence does build as you drink, but still a minority player on the palate. The body is very light, and there is a smooth and creamy texture that completely owes itself to the cask serving. The aftertaste is a slight linger of the toffee sweetness, with a slightly drying finish. Flavors and overall experience of the beer aren't bad, but there just seems to be an overall lackluster feel to it all. Palate seems watered down throughout, and nothing really jumps out at you."
"O: There are a lot of interesting things going on in this beer, and it all comes together nicely. I would gladly drink several of these. If this beer was available to me in dated sixpacks, it would be in my fridge pretty regularly."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a creamy white head. Aromas of sweet malt and earthy, floral hops. Flavors of lightly toasted caramel malt and more earthy, floral hops. Nicely balanced and drinkable, with a decent bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall a nice, drinkable Bitter, but nothing to get excited over."

"Pours a relatively clear copper with disappointing head for a hand pumped beer. Scent is lightly caramel and nutty, earthy and grassy hops with a presence from the yeast. Taste follows suit, quite light and in fact bitter, light caramel and nutty malts, earthy hops and a woodiness throughout. Thinner side of medium bodied, slightly over carbonated. Good bitter, meant to be light in flavor but lacks something in its construction."
"Overall there wasn’t a whole lot going on with this beer but that’s fair for the style. Worth a shot."
"This is a pretty tasty brew. Some interesting flavors show what the aroma did not. I bet this would be mighty tasty on cask!"
"Overall pretty decent, nothing special but a nice bitter on cask, thankfully low on herbal hops."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is a little too thick, but otherwise nice. Not bad but not great, either."
"Tasty, good drinker, sessionable."
"Second beer of the night at the Portland location, served on cask for $4, which I thought was a good price. Served in a standard pint glass. Light brown in color, with minimal head. Very faint smell of malt. Taste was of very mellow hops. Mouthfeel from the cask made this beer extremely smooth and easy to drink. The temp, mouthfeel, and flavor all made this beer a great session beer. This is the kind of beer you can gulp. A great beer to end the night with as we watched the game."
"Overall, I didn't have high hopes for this going in, but it was actually a pretty decent beer. Definitely average, but not a bad session Bitter."
"D: It's fine, really... but, nothing that really makes you want to come racing back for another."
"Drinkability: There is a nice malt and hop mix here. I could have three but not six. A nice above average bitter."
"cask is definitely the way to have this beer. usually the bottles are just on the shelf for too long."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable session beer. I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"Off their tap this beer was a hazy amber color. The head was khaki-colored, the retention decent, the lacing scattered. The aroma was subtle (yet again), a blend of crystal malt and some hoppy bitterness. The flavors were good, but unremarkable. Some malt sweetness at first, then pale malt and the bitterness towards the end. But for a ""Best Bitter"" it was awfully malty. Still the hoppy, crisp finish was on-point and it did strike me as rather well balanced. The mouthfeel was decent, the body medium and the carbonation pleasant enough helping it be sessionable. Not bad, but a little off-style."
"Sampled in Jan. '09. Pours from a 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of May '09. The pour is a copper color with little ot no head and not a lot of lacing. However the aroma is a pleaasing mixture of malts and maybe something a little citrus like. I think its body is average to above average. The taste is kind if bitter or sour and it ends dry. This is one that I enjoy and drink it often."
"D: Good, but off flavors distract."
"(rated Jan 8, 2008)"
"This beer was poured into a 16oz mixing glass from a 22oz bomber bottle, using two pours to complete. A: Hazy, with an unfiltered light copper appearance. Solid head retention with a nice brewer's lace along the glass during drinking. S: No overpowering nose or aroma of mention. T: Excellent, in my opinion. My impression of a session beer. Not sure on the ABV, but highly drinkable. Slightly hoppy, with a lingering citrus and piney taste. A great gateway beer to bolder or bigger brews. M: Mouthful was full, but not overly. Easy to swallow. D: This is a drinkable beer in every sense of the word. Labeled a ""Bitter", maybe closer to a lighter pale ale. All around an enjoyable beer. Twenty two ounces was a perfect amount for this review!!"
"A decent brew. Would make a decent session beer."
"D-seems like a great session beer. highly drinkable. has the balance that a good bitter should have."
"Pours a three-fingered cream head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is sweet honey that fades to a light bitter finish. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"This is a nice dry English Bitter. It pours a clear golden, slightly amber color with almost no head, lacing, retention. The aroma is English hops, cracked grains, some maltiness in the backbone, also some huskiness. The taste is pretty buttery, perhaps a tad butterscotch, but clearly with English hops, a coarse graininess, a drying finish, a tad bit caramel malt. There is a slight saltiness in the finish. This is modestly carbonated, fairly light bodied, overall not too complex, but a good English Bitter and worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Longneck bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Best enjoyed before February 2009 notched on the label. Airy white head atop an amber colored liquid and extremely clear. Head drops to a slight covering with a bit of stick to the sides after a short time. Buttery aroma with grain husk, caramel and esters. Flavors include toffee, caramels, light toast, butterscotch, and finishes with a moderate bitterness and appely fruitiness. Feel is medium with prickly carbonation. This is an easy bitter to drink - pleasing malt flavors balanced out by an adequate carbonation and interesting yeast character. A good bottled offering from Gritty - much better than the last two that I have tried."
"Was nicely carbonated, but the hops flavor made me not at all disappointed that I only had one bomber of this bitter."
"D: Good drinkability, I'll gladly consume the six."
"I'm glad I took a chance with a sixer here. Very drinkable, and good as a sipper or with food. One of those beers that this forum has actually helped me to appreciate. I looked for the good in it and it was there. This was the last of a very active beer drinking weekend (10 different total). Good way to finish."
"Drinkability was fair, but not sure there is enough flavor to bring me back for more of this Gritty's staple."
"pours a nice coppery amber with about an inch head that dissipates to a thin layer of tiny bubbles. my girlfriend, who is Korean, said it looks like red ginseng tea. smells toasty and malty. quite enticing... has the slightest bit of caramel maltiness up front followed by notes of paper and cardboard dryness. whether that's good or bad is up to you. it is fairly drinkable; i could definitely imagine myself getting drunk on this in a crowded Irish bar with friends on a Sunday afternoon in late December."
"Taste is light and crisp, starts out malty then transitions into a decent bitterness, not overly offending but very easy to drink."
"Gritty McDuff's Best Bitter pours a light copper color with a thick white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very mild, but plesant. The flavor has lots of diacetyl, it's buttery and caramel like too. The hops do a decent job of balance, but don't really stick out much. It works, worth a try."
"D: Good drinkability making for a good session style bitter."
"Pours a nice orange amber color witha medium bodied but tall white head that sits atop the beer for a while before it fades. It laces the glass with little lacing down the glass. The aroma is of very sweet toasted malts and some faint fruity aromas and a slightly hoppy bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is interesting. Sweet toasted malts underneath some very bitter flavors that I can't put my finger on. The aftertaste isn't as bitter as the rest of it but overall, it is a bitter beer. The mouthfeel is crisp which makes for a drinkable bitter beer. Worth a try."
"One sip and I am taken back to the last time I had this on tap. Its been awhile. Its very smooth, faintly carbonated and very swiggable. Plenty of malty sweetness with not a lot of after taste notes. This is a basic beer from Gritty's. I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean its there flagship brew that is solid, simple and easy to drink. Obviously the bottled form has nothing on the cask conditioned drafts you'll find on tap at Gritty's. If you've never had this beer, start with that option if at all possible."
"Poured into the pint glass a deep copper color. A short white head quickly receded, leaving a small amount of lacing. Smells of malt, kind of bready. Tastes of bready malt with some nutiness. Mouthfeel is medium and nicely carbonated. Pretty easy to drink."
"Even with a vigorous pour all I could manage to get was a thin off-white head which dissipated rather quickly. The color is a nice golden amber variety. When I first smelled this beer it reminded me of chardonnay or perhaps even a champagne. The flavor is sweet and caramel-like. I was expecting quite a bit of bread notes but they came in very faint towards the back end of the taste. Very little hops detected. The mouth feel is very light with just a touch of carbonation. Overall a nice bitter."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice session beer to drink for a long while."
"I enjoyed this one. It is, overall, fairly true to the style and does a lot by doing very little (if that makes sense). It's got some nice, full flavour that's simple but to the point and is just an easy brew to drink. Recommended."
"D- A decent beer- I had it with a ciabatta loaf sandwich, which I enjoyed. I think it pairs better with food than on its own as a night long session beer, as I could actually tire of its bitterness since it's a bit more aggressive in that aspect than other bitters I've had. Still, a good meal brew."
"Had this one in their 22 oz bottle. The appearance was a golden murky amber with a decent sized head. Delicious and sharp citrus aromas with various mixes of malts and bread-like flavors. The taste has a good bitter-sweet balance going within its almost herb-like flavors. Nice, crisp mouthfeel and medium body. Overall, a very nice English-style bitter."
"Recommended."
"The bottle I enjoyed had a new label from what's currently on the site, and it reads ""Gritty's Best Bitter"". It has the colored illustration of the bartender passing over a pint to a customer that I've seen before (probably on t-shirts as I haven't been to the brewpub in years). The label states that it's brewed & bottled in Portland, ME."
"Drinkability: A classic session beer."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth pale and light crystal malt scent along with a nice bitter hop aroma. It's light with some caramel notes. The taste is decent. It has a crisp pale malt flavor with a hint of caramel in the finish. It's mildly bitter with a clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinker. I feel the CO2 is a little much for this style, but it goes down smooth nonetheless."
"Perhaps it was because I was thirsty, but this was a very good beer for the moment--a hot summer day while I was thirsty."
"The diacetyl and noticeable yeast detract a bit, but it's not a bad interpretation of the style at all. Better as it warms, but never quite enough to overcome minor irritants about it. Overall - decent."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable beer, definitely a classy choice."
"It's thick-bodied, nice and chunky. So very dry, so very English. Smooth, but does leave a film. It's delicious, dry, yeasty, and bitter (a bitter that's actually bitter!). Repeats more than welcome."
"Beer pours a light brown/paleish color. Aroma is one of malt with some fruitiness and some detection of hops. Taste is different as there some bitterness up front that levels off with fruitiness at the back of the throat. Not too strong and seemingly smooth. There's some dryness in the finish. A fine example of a bitter and very drinkable."
"D - The carbonation really interferes. Otherwise a light tasthing bitter."
"Decent representation of the style, particularly for an American bitter."
"Initially a lot of staying power foam and good aroma of malt and hops. The initial taste was good, then harsh carbonation wore me down. Hops keeping malt in check, a serviceable bitter but not a great example. A tad of toast or butter on toast. More..ingredients."
"Brew pours to a copper color with a tan head that broke down somewhat slow and did leave a little lacing. The aroma is dominated by the malt, which seems to give it a caramel like scent. The taste while not seeming to complex is nice, with flavors of caramel, dough and a slight hop finish. Over all this is an easy drinking brew, simple but probably one of the better Grittys that I had."
"Overall- A very good beer here. This is a nice session beer. Could become cloying after about 6 but otherwise very tasty."
"In the early days of American craft beer, I might have been satisfied, but the bar is much higher these days. Disappointing."
"Thinner body with good carbonation. Slick on the tongue. Not a bad beer, but I think the 3 that came in my mixed 12-pack will be enough for me."
"Appearance is a clear copper hue with an off-white frothy head that maintains throughout tasting. Lacing has a medium stickiness to the glass. Smell is amazing, I love the odor of this ESB. Has a very nutty character with a bit of a raisin background. Taste follows up with the nutty smell and so smooth. A bit of a toasted corn taste with a nice malty finish. Carbonation is powerful throughout entire tasting. I find this beer to be extremely drinkable, basically a session beer. Very balanced....I find myself coming back for this beer time after time."
"A definate throw-back beer, but in the best sense. It tastes a little of caramel, then creamy and smooth, but there's a lingering bitterness that sneaks up on you. The hops are a bit odd for me, I can't tell if they're jujst grassy or hae been skunked. The flavor profile is a bit low, but this is a style that thrives in casks anyways. Reminds me of milder version of my local Syracuse Pale Ale but a little more delicate."
"Pours a nice light copper. Thin head. Not much retention, but some lacing. Smell is grain,and some carmel. Smell is weak. Body is thin,and carbonated. Taste is sweet up front,with a hint of hops in the finish. Not great for me, but low ABV,so drink up if you like it!"
"Pours a clear copper hue with very little head. Carbonation is fairly still. Aroma is very light, mostly grain. Taste is sweetish malt with a bit of hop bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. A bit of caramel flavor sneaks through as well. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. Actually a decent brew if you're not looking for something to challenge the palate. Seems like it would be good with some pizza. Yeah, gotta go call the pizza shop ..."
"Worth a try."
"After spending time in London this year, I found the Gritty's Bitter to be a very good example of a true British ale. The fact that it had liitle carbonation would make it like a hand pulled pint. The subtle flavors gave way to a typical finish. It's different than other american beers, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it !!"
"McDuff's Best Bitter was a bit of a let down, as I have found their other brews rather enjoyable. This pours a gold-amber color. There was a minimal head which went fast. The smell was nondistinct. The taste was a malty sweet and bittered mess. The aftertaste was a bit sticky on the back of the tongue, but not distractingly so. I can't recommend this bitter, with other availble options out there."
"Pretty easy to drink."
"D - high for the IBU-philes, average for others, very quality brew, Gritty's does it again"
"This was both a nice-looking and a nice-tasting beer. It was an amber color with a thick, sticky head and some lacing. It had a pleasant floral aroma. It tasted sweet with some great hop bitterness. Pretty good mouthfeel, and it certainly goes down easily. I'm usually not too much of a fan of cask-conditioned beers, but this was quite good."
"Alright. I which I never noticed the metallic-ness. I think I would definitely appreciate it more as an easy to pound pretty tasty beer otherwise."
"Not bad overall...I could probably session this."
"Not the most complex brew, not the most intense.... but a very drinkable one...would go well with food."
"mouthfeel is light and crisp. this in combination with the great flavor make it extremely drinkable. i'm impressed with this brewery so far having never heard of it before my boss gave me the sample. great brew."
"Another great beer from Gritty's. Ah, Gritty...you have won me over. I am definately a true fan. This beer pours clean with a small head that does kind of fizzle away, but a classic ""english bitter"" aroma wafts up from within. Excellent crispness to the taste, though the mouthfeel could use just a lttle bit more. Totally a drinkable brew, enjoy five or twelve tonight!"
"Thin bodied, weak carbonation. All in all, uninspiring."
"Had on cask at the Grittys In Freeport this weekend. Thick, thick cream colored foam. It eventually died down to about half, but when the beer arrived, it was about 1.5 inches thick and you could almost eat it with a spoon. Deep orange brown, crystal clear and minimal carbonation. Really low aroma. Medium - mouthfeel. Taste was of pleasant biscuityness, with a small citrus burst at the end. Just a small dollop of diacetyl, not a drawback with this one. Would make a good session brew."
"Sampled this at Brewtopia, first brew of the day. Pretty enough copper color, nothing outrageous, but pretty. Smell was fruity and grainy. Taste was slightly bitter but not overly so, with a cidery/citrusy twang at the end, and hints of vanilla throughout. There's a toasted malty quality to this that I dig. An okay mouthfeel, not too many bubbles, and fairly drinkable. This was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid brew."
"Crystal clear faded apricot colored with a thick and foamy head an inch high that sticks around long. Faint smell of a mix of bready malts and citrusy hops. Flavors of malt and caramel, some butterscotch and grainy light brown sugar. Some cinnamon pokes through, and the faintest of a citrus peel hop bitter emerges in the finish. Mouthfeel is full and round, low carbonation. Reminiscent of a traditional English bitter style."
"This is a well-balanced, fairly standard bitter. Nothing that is especially outstanding, but it certainly doesnt disappoint. An excellent session brew."
"It's a staple in my beer diet. As good as Fuller's ESB, but slightly more creamy."
"A great two finger head and a real rich clear amber color.This has a real floral/like hoppy smell.I don't have a great nose ,but this smells very good.I hope you like hops because this is HOPPY! This has a very dry hop taste,but not alot after that,it is mildly nutty.This has a light feel.I was hoping for more from Gritty's,but this is alittle disapointing.This is still good,but other Gritty beers are better."
"I enjoyed this very much, good overall flavor."
"Pours a light golden colot with a light coat of head over top. There is a good bit of diacetyl in this (as well as their other beers). This is ther first beer that it might actually work in though. I would like to see a little more hop and malt character carry through. The flavor is right with the nose. Big diacetyl with just a hint of hop hanging in the background. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Another brew that could use a diacetyl rest. I don't think I would try and find this one again."
"This one pours a light amber color - very clear - with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of diacetyl going on as well as a lot of lingering sweetness and some caramel maltiness. The flavor has a lot of toffee sweetness and caramel - the diacetyl has a definate presence. I'm not huge on this flavor, but it's not bad. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is ok."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a hint of crispness at the start. The finish was lightly crisp. The caramel and bitterness lasted briefly on the tongue. Definite session beer at Gritty's brewpub as several of these can be quaffed."
"Drinkable? Yes. But any decent bitter is drinkable, and this one is drinkable. I wouldn't seek this out, but this is no beer to be ashamed about."
"Light golden amber with not much of a head on this fine cask pint of hand-pulled real ale. Aromas are subtle, but fresh grassy hops, and biscuity malts are prevalent if you look for them. The taste is more about the hops than the malts, but this still isn't one of the hoppier bitters that I have had. The malts are in good show too, but neither the malts or the hops take center stage. This brew is about balance and drinkability. Mouthfeel is cask goodness, smooth and light and oh-so-drinkable. not a bad UK beer from a Maine brewery."
"A very workmanlike, straightforward English bitter."
"Overall: Definitely recommend this one and the best Gritty's brew I've tried to date."
"Overall: Spot on for the style! Super malty session beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium copper color with two fingers of head. There is lots of clingy lacing left on the glass. The smell has lots of lightly toasted biscuit malt and a good hop aroma. Very well balanced. The taste also has that biscuit malt flavor, a little bit of hay in the middle, and a sharp hop finish. Nice and crisp. A bitter that's actually bitter! The mouthfeel is incredibly thick for the style. The drinkability is great too. Another nice Maine beer!"
"12 ouncer, with best enjoyed before dating. Pours a light clear amber, fairly active carbonation with bubbles continuing to rise to the top and a medium bubble head remaining. Some lacing left behind. Semi soapy, piney nose. Medium bodied, light balanced ale. Malt is soft and nutty, minor hops balance things out but dont exert themselves. Hint of butterscotch also noted. Not a very exciting style nor version here, but this one would do in a pinch as a sessioner."
"Purchased at a Hannaford's supermarket in Saco, Maine. This beer pours a golden amber. A bubbly head recedes to leave sticky sheets of lacing that cling to the side of the glass throughout consumption. Smells of caramel and grainy malts. Mouthfeel is creamy. Buttery caramel malt flavor with a bitter hoppy finish. Overall very smooth and extremely drinkable. One of these days I need to go to Gritty's pub and try this one on tap."
"This is a great tasting all around beer. An awesome balance of malt and hops to be enjoyed any day of the year."
"The hops have a sharp and edgy citrus bite, with a mild tea-like taste and faint metallic tang. It begins to sweeten a bit towards the end, but all in all, it has a fairly dry finish."
"Poured a coppery gold into an imperial pint glass, with a reasonable big-bubbled, albeit not terribly long lasting, head. Taste works well, with some maltiness, and then a nice well-rounded hops bite works its way around the palate. Excellent session-ability, and a great bitter all around."
"Average caramel appearance with little head, lacing quality was ok. Slight fruity an dhoppy smell. Taste was a bit off in this sample...accompanying mouthfeel had a ""gagging effect"" This reduced the drinkability factor. Not one of my favorites."
"Pours a amber/copper color with not much head to speak of,the aroma is of toasted malt and biscuity a nice sweeter aroma also seems to linger.Taste starts out malty crisp with some hoppy citrus tones that come in subtly to round out this beer pretty nicely.Would have liked to try this on cask."
"Taste is creamy and bitter. Metallic flavors with a light malt profile. Hoppy flavors grow as it warms. Big hop profile as you finish the brew. Creamy mouthfeel with a coppry, hoppy aftertaste. Smooth enough. I'm not a big fan of bitter but this brew is very smooth. I would really like to try this on draft."
"Bottom line: Solid offering. I'll keep an eye out for other beers from this Maine micro."
"A very good beer on tap. I prefer it cask conditioned, but it's pretty close on regular tap. Great balance, easy drinking, a top notch session ale."
"Before I tasted this for the first time, I thought Gritty's was going to be just another half-decent New England micro. Best Bitter, however, took my breath away. The taste is best described as a slightly bitter caramel. The ""bitterness," though, is unobtrusive to this otherwise sweet and extremely tastey beer. Irresistable."
"Definitely more English than American, but still maintains a sweetness that i find in most Aemrican bitters/pale ales/IPA's. Caramelly malts, citrusy bitter hops, some tea. Uncomplicated, but enjoyable cask bitter, puts a lot of english bitters to shame. (draft GBBF 03')"
"This bitter poured a clear, amber color with white foam that dissipated quickly and left a thin foam layer. The smell was mild: malt and some hops. The taste was mostly malt with some biscuity flavor and some bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth but crisp with medium body and low to medium carbonation. There was a nice floral hop taste in the finish. This was a good bitter and would be a decent session brew."
"Nice amber with an off white head. Fruity and grainy malts add sweetness Est Kemp hops flow to add the ""best"" bitter. Mouthfeel is great. A very nice brew on cask. Certainly worth a sample. Or two. Or three. Or four. I stopped at one, but there was more beer to drink."
"This is a great bitter on cask. Smooth, refreshing, well balanced, and very tasty. I could drink these all day long. Come to think of it; I have drank these all day long before. This one is well worth a trip to Maine to have on cask, IMHO."
"A straightforward, no-nonsense bitter. Crystal-clear, medium copper with smallish head that didn't go anywhere. A handful of caramel malts buttressed perfectly by a quite mild hop character. Authentically British. Lemon in the finish. Creamy, thinnish mouthfeel. Some metallic water qualities. Solidly flavorful, enough to keep me interested without inflicting palate fatigue. Brings back memories of huddling over a table in Gritty's pub in Portland Maine. Also makes me want to try Gritty's other bottled offerings. Weird to see other bottles of booze pictured on the label."
"Deep copper is the color of the beer as it sits in my glass with a head that is magnanimous in its size, frothy in its consistency. Malt dominates the slightly sweet and crisp nose. Begins somewhat sweet, the top is lean, the finish is benignly carbonated, the hops purposeful in their spiciness, droughty long lasting aftertaste."
"Maybe I have a bias towards cask ales, but this is a very tasty offering.  The aroma is sharp and spicy with a hint of lingering bitterness.  The body is full and smooth with a great malty flavor profile.  Very nice."
"Not what I exspected. Not overly bitter, in fact had a light taste. Smooth and easy drinking, the hops looming in the background of every gulp. Could easily drink this all the time. Tasted more like a lager to me."
"Pours a perect copper collor with a big off white head that forms a very nice lace.  Smell is of english style hops with some light toasty malt in the background.  Smooth toasty malt opens up the flavor and it is in almost perfect balance with the nice subtle hopping of the East Kent hops.  Extremely smooth and creamy and very drinkable.  I can only imagine what this would be like on cask.  Perhaps someday I will find out for myself.  Thanks to the Bierman and JohhnyP for the sample."
"A good, smooth session brew. A spot on bitter."
"Notes: I decent bitter to be had here, balanced quite well ... flavourful. Make sure you don't drink this brew cold ... it will mask all of the true Bitter Style flavours."
