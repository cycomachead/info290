"Overall... a non impressive ale but not a bad one , hops are present but without a long aftertaste."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a small drinking glass. Tasted on 6/1/2013 in Huntly, Scotland."

"O - disregarding the slightly metallic finish, the beer has creaminess than other mass produced english bitters commonly lack. Also, the hint of dark fruits is a nice addition."
""
"This was quite bland. Drinkable, but not entirely enjoyable. Read that the cask version rocks, but this was really quite meh."

"Overall: one of the better English Bitters. I much prefer them full strength like this rather than the milds. A good dose of sweet malts and some floral hops make this an easy-drinking beer. The price is reasonable for an English Bitter too. Worth it."

"Pours somewhere between copper and brick red coloured with a decent slightly off-white head. The nose is lemony with a hint of dried fruit: pleasant but not bold. This seems surprisingly malty for a bitter with a sweet start and then a biscuity taste to the fore. Any bitterness which follows is moderate. The hop impact is more metallic giving way to a slight herbal/mint aftertaste than bitter. The taste didn't quite pan out as I had imagined from the nose, yet pleasant but not bold certainly reflects my attitude towards this beer."

"O: Earth didn't move, a bit like a watered down uninteresting Dubbel."

"O: Decent ESB but rather mundane. A bit sweet for more than one."

"M&D: lively texture throughout, along with the flavour its a bit like gin&tonic!! A bit thin-bodied in the end, though. Overall a light-medium bodied bitter with good fruity elements to enjoy, this is an easy-to-drink session bitter, though not as mellow nor tasty as the cask-conditioned version when in good form."
""
"Not what I was expecting from this one, it was a nice beer but it came across a lot lighter than I would have imagined. The beer was very lively and there was quite a sweet taste overall that I imagine would get quite sickening after a while but since I only had the one it wasn't a problem."
" a lot better English bitters around even in BC."

"Malts lead the way in the taste too: with the hops and yeast coming along nicely in the background. Fruity biscuits; lightly baked with a finish of mildly bittering hops. Easy to drink and a standard ‘Best Bitter’; never been a favourite but nothing wrong with it."

"Overall, not the best, and let's face it, it's a crowded market for bottled Bitter."
""

"Well it is in a can which made is fairly fresh tasting which can be an issue for UK beers in BC. Cheap at $2.10 a tall can which makes it good value as it is a decent bitter that has a fairly thick mouthfeel and a caramel-like note in the taste. Not sure why they had to add sugar but it is a beer I will go back to as it has that English hop nose backed with a strong malt backbone."
"The sugar lends a thicker than expected body to this, and the carbonation is really mild. Drinkable - almost sessionable - but a bit heavy handed."
"O - Just past it best before date so was a cheapie I couldnt pass up. Wasnt a big fan at first but it grew on me as the glass emptied. I couldnt have more than two."
"Overall - overall this is a rich hearty beer with spice and depth in flavour, not good to quench thirst but would be more of a cold winter drink. "
"O/D - Pour showing. Weak in most respects. Not interesting or overly tasty. I'll pass if this comes by again."
"D-This is what I think of when I crave a cask bitter."
"Poured clear dark copper beer with excellent off-white head, leaving some nice laces. Aroma isn't zesty, grassy hops and malt to be easily contradistinguished. Moderate malt body with plain bitter finish, I have felt elusive apricot (or peach) note right before hops. The beer is crisp, but faceless. I'm slightly disappointed"
"Sorry for my English. This is my first review i hope it's not my last"
"Carbonation is high, the body seems watery!"
"Malty and hoppy aftertaste, earthy, musky."
"D- Excellent session better with a solid flavour profile"
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Bitter."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, this would be one of my top choices to have a few pints of with friends at the pub..."
"I used to be very fond of this on draught when younger, imagining I would one day be a director myself. I did get to live that dream, but it turend into a nightmare. Beer is a more reliable friend."
"Vibrant bronze with a tight little head, some good lacing going on here. Spicy hop notes gel in with the honeyed malt. Delivers on the palate with some robust bitterness and a long nutty aftertaste. Very satisfying. Carbonation is perfect. Fills the mouth with plenty of flavour, wish I bought more than one."
"High drinkability on this one!"
"a very nice beer only let down by the awol aroma."
"d) Nice drop, good for a session"
"A very drinkable beer. Perhaps a tad heavy on the sweetness, but it goes down very smoothly. A lovely drop."
"A decent drop, quite drinkable and with things to like."
"Better than the keg version."
"The overall effect left me pleased enough to delay plans to move on and I sampled another. The medium body does tend to lean towards the lighter side, but this did make it incredibly easy to drink on a warm night in Glasgow."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker, but the more harsh bitter character and higher abv make it less suitable for a true session."
"Have to admit, although decent alcohol level, in the bottle form and in its current brewing, it does not excite. Fairly run-of-the-mill bitter with moderate head after pouring, some malty, hoppy components. It's not awful; but it's not really interesting either: plenty of others to choose from."
"Beer poured a golden orange with an OK head initially that floated as the pint was drank. Nose was a hint of malts and not much else. This brew was served fairly close to room tempature and it had a blast of bittering hops with a semi skunky finish. Don't know if it was because it was at a higher temp. Mouthfeel was light bodied. Drinkability was OK but would have been better if colder. I enjoy dark beers warmer but pales and bitters are not as good at room temps."
"Bham UK"
"Taste: The mouthfeel is really good on this beer, and the snappy bitterness is great."
"Pumps an amber color with no head. The smell is slightly malty with sweetness to it, and a hint of citrus although nothing too noticeable. The taste is very surprising for a Cask Conditioned ale, usually I find them bland and not special. It retains the sweetness through the first sips like molasses with sugar. The aftertaste is great... it stays sweet on the tongue but you get hops that stay in the throat. Much better than most ales."
"Other: It's OK, but it doesn't really merit the ""cute"" story on the label about how this was originally brewed only for the directors of the brewery and they were finally convinced to make it publicly available. I wouldn't miss it."
"""Drink up Arthur, the world's about to end."""

"Drinkability is too sweet, just not that enjoyable. Little bit above average."
"Poured a dark copper from the can with light carbonation. This resulted in a thin but dense and creamy head, that lasted through most of the beer and formed this lace on the glass. Slightly sharp, crisp hop aroma with grass and earth notes. Light on malt sweetness, with a hint of ripe fruit. Starts with a light bitterness that grows through the end, giving it a clean finish. Overall, the flavour's quite mild, assisted by the low carbonation."
"This is a pretty average to decent English bitter beer. There are whole swathes of Northern England where it's the only decent cask-conditioned beer available at all. At 4.8% it's not really a lunch-time drink, but it certainly slips down dangerously easily. It's nicely balanced and refreshing, with a clean appearance and a light hoppy aroma. Reccommended."
"this beer continually begs the question, dont the brewers at courage like the directors? if this is the best they can come up with for them perhaps they should look for another career. this is the type of beer id expect as the standard beer in the range, not the top shelf stuff."
"Great with a Ploughmans..."
"I lucked in as this is currently on sale at my local liquor store. This bitter poured out a dark amber colour with a very serious head - not big, it just looks good. The nose is typically of a bitter but light on the bitter taste. It has a fruity taste with a touch of hops. Not bad for an S&N brew. A pleasant surprise. Half way through I added old chedder to the mix. It went well together. Think I'll take advantage of the sale and lay a few in stock."
"This is one of the first bitter that I drank. Pourred an amber brew with a nice foamy head on top of it. Taste is bitter (would have expected more bitterness) and a little bit fruity. No spice are overly detectable. Would be curious to try some more bitter. Would drink this again..."
"Pours with a serious white head that stays, leaving sheets of lace. Medium carbonation. Nice clear amber color, nose is malty. Label has this as ""a classic strong English ale AND the label does not have the word 'bitter' on it. The ABV is still 4.8%, if this is a bitter it is the maltiest, sweetest I have ever had but it does finish ever so slightly bitter. The cock is crowing on the label and brewery is in Staines, England - that's just west of London."
"I really like this beer. It's a very nice, buttery, fruity, toffee bitter."
"The taste starts moderately sweet and remains throught the finish then mildly lingers."
"Wasn't really sure what to expect from a 'bitter' since I cant remember having one. Just knew that its not supposed to be bitter so I gave it a try when I saw it. Has a pleasant light red colour like a weak tea with very little head. A mild grapefruit aroma and sour fruity taste. I wasn't impressed with the mouthfeel but this is not a bad beer. I would have one if you put it in front of me but not especially impressive."
"Had this beer reluctantly on my most recent trip to London when what I really wanted was ""tapped out"" This ale surprised me a bit. Color was a deep copper with a nice head retention, lacing of my pint glass was copious. Aroma was a little weak and mostly of malt, taste was smooth and malty with subtle hopping. I didn't think it was too bad considering it comes from one of the villianous big boys of British brewing. Decently drinkable."
"Very much a sipping ale, Directors is a smooth end to a hectic day."
"Like the regular best, this is very bland. Smooth sweet palate, very, very simple and boring, i'm sorry, i really don't have much to say about this one, one dimentional, also had a slight off-fruit character."
