"Solid refreshing amber - nothing special, but a repeat.  Good swillin' beer."
""
"Pours a nice amber color with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of toasted malt. The taste is nice and smooth with a lot of the malt giving caramel and toffee flavors while still having a nice aftertaste and isn't too sweet. A very good everyday kind of beer."

"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied.  Light hoppy nose and flavor is mellow with hops balanced by caramel malt. $2.29 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma. Bottled 5/23/14."

"Again with many that I have tasted, nothing fundamentally wrong, but there is also nothing that shines as being outstanding."

"Liked tho one more than I expected. Nose is terrific, and the flavor is solid."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid flavorful beer to session with for a long time."
"o: A good American amber (described as ""Amber Ale"" on the label), another that is a bit hoppier than I prefer for an amber or even an English Bitter (what it's called here) but the malt base is evident enough and it makes a good dinner or pub drink. Would buy it again but it is not easy to find and there are some I like a bit more. Let's put it this way: if none of my favorites were on tap but this one was, I'd probably pick The Naughty Nurse, and not just because asking for it would be worth a smile."

"Overall: Pretty average ESB or amber ale like the label says. It is more true to the bitter style."

"O: For being an English Bitter, this beer didn't have much in the way of bitterness. I would have liked this beer a lot better if it didn't taste like cough syrup."

"The sip is far more bitter than the smell indicates. The malt base is brief--it's not sweet but it has some elements of caramel and powdered malt. The hop provides bitterness but little complexity. The aftertaste is long. Thin bodied with an elevated level of carbonation."
""
""
""
"Comes to the table a clear amber color with a small head but a decent amount of lace. Smells of light caramel and brown sugar with a earthy spicy hop to provide some balance. The flavor is earth and spicy hop with a hint of skunk and a solid caramel malty backbone. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Nice approachable easy drinking ale."
""
"Overall - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and ordered a follow up. Very drinkable english bitter ale."

"Overall, I think City Steam's Naughty Nurse is nothing spectacular, but, DEFINITELY nothing to reject. This is a fine brewed beer with nice flavor and versatility. Restaurants would be wise to have it on their menu. Personally, I'd find it hard to pass up to accompany a meal or hardy sandwich."
""
"O - Overall, fairly average/standard beer. Would not buy a six pack of this."
"Pours copper, a little hazy with chestnut hue. A fabulous head of soft creamy foam that fell off oh so slowly like a tease. It really does have a come hither look. Sticky lace and thick cap. Smells great with fat malt and light citrus. Lemon and floral are light as a feather on a bread & biscuit caramel malt spine. Malt opens up deep and sweet. Taste is gentle ,clean crystal malt with a good honey and butter sweetness, slightly nutty, alongside hops that are as gentle as a spring breeze with some earth and floral and not quite too bitter. Just enough bitter to lean in on the back palate. It was a touch watery and thin. Drank smooth and bittersweet and had a silky mouthfeel with just a bit of carbonation to tickle the throat. Really good."

"O: I thought this beer was pretty easy to drink and could be sessionable, though I probably was not a big enough fan to have more than a couple of these - I was hoping for a little more grassy/earth hops that I expect for the style."
"Overall meh, this wouldn't be too bad for an underhopped English amber or red ale, but as a bitter this misses the mark but quite a bit. Hops are barely detectable and just a bit of earthy grassy flavors, way too much on the malt side for a bitter even if the hops were bigger, and malts seem too much on the candy caramel sweet side again for a bitter."
""
"Mild and laid back but not bad, nothing off or abrasive here. Herbal and spicy hop forward with some decent malt backing."
""
"Perhaps balance can be found by paring this with spicy Chinese food or perhaps with dessert. Adding something citrus may be another good idea. I would certainly try this again as it was well above average."
""
"Cheers!"

"I was happy with this beer and would gladly try it again. It wasn't good enough to seek it out, but was certainly good enough not to pass it up if offered."
"A nice American made bitter.. Easy drinking and enjoyable. Solid beer."

"O: This is a nice full bodied Amber Ale with decent malt presence and a little bitterness."

"This was a surprisingly good brew. I had on draft at XL center in Hartford during a Huskies game and another on tap at City Steam - I found it to be a refreshing, easy drinking alternative to the other Macros on draft at XL. I then bought this in bottle six pack and was equally impressed, actually more impressed. As far as ambers go, it holds up in all categories. Ambers aren't my go to, but I'm always curious to see what's available as a local brew. Overall, a quality and satisfying beer."

"D: This beer won't blow anyone away, but still enjoyable to drink. Naughty Nurse has good flavor and goes down easy. Great session beer."

"No hints of ABV and a very easy to drink brew."

"Grabbed a bottle at the Red Door in my home town of Watertown, CT. This amber ale is a deep copper color, clear and fairly quiet. The head is just a thin off-white cover but the lacing is decent. The aroma brings a solid molasses caramel malt that seems promising. The flavor says much the same with more of the distinctive molasses with peachy fruit highlights and a subtle pinch of herbal hop. It’s medium-light bodied with modest carbonation and a slightly chalky feel. It’s not bad, certainly a bit of a statement compared to the average amber ale. But I think it could do with just a little bit more of the molasses power to make this better than simply distinctive. It seems a little watery at times but not enough to ruin it. A different sort of amber and well worth a try."
"Overall, this isn't a style I would normally go for, but this beer isn't bad. If I were offered one, I would happily drink it. If it were available here, I would probably not ever buy it."
"O: Defeinitly would have another but sadley only have this one, thanks Okey."
"Overall: Not sure if this is good for a bitter or pale ale. When I was drinking it, I thought sweet amber ale. There is a nice mix, but the malt triumphs. Not out of the ordinary, but nothing to pass over either."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a gorgeous dark amber with small head and decent retention of lacing. Aroma is malty, with some hops and yeast. Mouthfeel is light. Taste is of hops, yeast and is just overall watered down tasting. It is just ok."
"Not too bad, but not that great either. Pretty mild and smooth, but not too flavorful/memorable. Poured a light amber with a light head that settled quickly. Light, mildly hoppy aroma and taste. Easy drinking, light mouthfeel. Not something I'd reorder, but nice for those who don't live dangerously."
"If you like caramel than this is your beer. Not much in the way of a bitter but nice just he same."
"Taste: A lighter tasting beer with a unique flavor. Instantly became one of my favorites."
"Really good beer, very drinkable. Will seek out again."
"Smell has a small amount of citrus hops, caramel and grain. Naughty Nurse tastes fairly sweet, sugar, light on the hops. MF is medium, no strong aftertaste of any kind. Drinkability is fairly good in this offering from City Steam out of Hartford. I have enjoyed this on-tap at their brewpub there a couple years ago. Now, it is nice to have the option to pick this up at the local package store."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown color with minimal head. Some lacing. Sweet aroma of malts and spices. Taste is mostly spices at first with some maltiness to it. Somewhat bready. Spices in the finish. Overall this beer is okay but I'm hoping this is just the beginning of City Steam bottling its beers. I would really like to see Acapulco Gold or the Summer Stout in 6 packs. For now this entry is ""eh""."
"D: Very drinkable, nice mix of flavors, nice body, and overall a nice beer. I am glad they started bottling this, it's nice to have more local stuff."
"D - Very much so. Kinda wish I had this available on tap when I wanted a fresh ESB."
"D: Pretty smooth choice for the sourdough Swiss burger I had and for quaffing back in the fading sunset of an early summer day as was the scenario this evening. Not off the charts in terms of flavor, but quite serviceable and a nice take on the pint of English bitter."
"Overall-professional bitter, if not spectacular."
"Poured from tap, a nice golden color, with a decent head and excellent lacing. Aromas are of citrus, a bit of wheat and some grassy like elements. This one has a nice tinge of maltiness in the back upon tasting, the grapefruit flavors compliments the malt up front. Mouthfeel is perfect, a nice bitter finish accomapnies a well carbonated brew. Overall, enjoyable, but I still liked the Carpenter's Ale better."
"6/3/7/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"Growler. Dark amber pour with a nice thick tan head. Aroma of malt, roasted nuts and bitter caramel. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and watery. Taste of dried dark fruit, sweet malt and English hops with overtones of caramel. Thin, slightly stale finish."
"This one was much better the second time around. A pretty unique beer to have as a ""flagship"" brew."
"The naughtly nurse is a popular beer at City Steam, some part due to it's mischievous name no doubt. In truth, its a decent, well balanced pale ale, nothing amazing but very drinkable. Color is a light brown to amber, a little bit of white head that doesn't stick around long. Smells like a lighter pale ale, aroma of subtle hops and malt, which matches the taste indeed. The Nurse goes down quite well :-), without any bitterness or major aftertaste. This is a beer you can drink a fair amount of, not too strong, but fairly smooth and mellow. Pretty good for a standard City Steam beer, but I much prefer some of their special brews."
"Draught: Lighter amber color. It had a little head, but not too much, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is a bit thin. I get some citrus hops and a little malt, plus some floral notes. There is a decent enough maltiness to the beer, but pretty this on any bitterness to the taste. Good, but a bit on the thin side for a Pale Ale. A typical ""standard"" house beer for a micro: good, but definitely brewed for the Macro masses."
"This seems to be the flagship brew, at least the most popular, perhaps because it has what it takes for mass appeal. Better than average in most respects, but it probably won't blow you away. Light brown color with a low head that dissipates fairly quickly. Slight hop aroma, followed by a mellow hop flavor, supplemented with some malt and fruity undertones. Decent mouthfeel, but no real lingering flavors."
"I had high hopes. It had a frothy head, it was served well chilled. I could smell hops on the nose. Then I drank it.. missed the hops. They were just really weak. Is this ~supposed~ to be a pale ale? Sure doesn't seem it. The 2nd beer I tried at City Steam. I'm a bit dissapointed."
"Kind of a weak pale ale.  Doesn't have the hop kick that I expect from a pale ale and had a very thin body with a short finnish.  I've found that this place's seasonals are much better than their year-round products."
