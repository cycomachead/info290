"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 8B). Bottle 50 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: malt aroma background with a caramely and dried grapes profile. mild hop and roasteds notes. APPEARANCE: copper color and translucent. slight ivory thin head with low retention. TASTE: roasted notes noticeable with some low maltiness and faint floral hop notes. high bitterness that lingers well beyond a not totally dry finish. PALATE: low body with low carbonation. OVERALL: a best bitter bitter that lacks a bit more of esters, malt complexity and body."

"Meh - rather dull and one-dimensional. Perhaps too traditional for my tastes. It looks alright, however the flavour and aroma are uninspired; grainy malt and stewed leaves. Body is OK. Drinkable enough but doesn't hold your interest. No need to hunt it down."
"O: Mild and Mellow but not boring. A decent brew."

"It comes in a 500 ml. bottle that reminds me those of medecinal syrup. It pours an amber reddish colour, small head that fades quickly. No lace. Smell is earthy, sulphuric, kind of chalk. I can't find anything more here. Sweeter than expected in the palate, a bit watery but fizzy. Taste is sulphuric, hints of caramel, butter, some biscuit . Soft. I took another look to the label to see if I drank it out of date by mistake, but no. The bottle is the best about this beer, IMO."

"A decent and competent bitter a real decent pint not 'alf"
"Above average and a pleasant session bitter to have all night, would need some crisps and nuts though, if I was to stay on it for too long."
"D - Very good session beer. There are much better bitters out there, but this is solid."
"Copper colour with slightly off-white fluffy head. Label salmon coloured rather than white as pictured. Rather earthy nose with a hint of grape or raisin. After initial biscuity start a slightly herbal hop kick takes over. Seems very slightly spicy, almost peppery, in the aftertaste. Better than most bitters."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style English bitter (very low ABV 3.7)."
"D - A pretty damn good english bitter. My bottle said 3.7%. Could do with a bit more bitterness IMO."
"M&D: the texture is very soft with only necessary amount of tiny bubbles to soothe the taste-buds, while the body comes really decent, never thin for its low alc. strength, thanks to (I think) a sound balance achieved b/w malts and hops, and also an assertive level of hop bitterness. All in all, this is to me a thirst-quenching, light-weight ale, not far from what one'd expect from the cask version in a good old pub!"
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 3.7%. Amber to brown colour, moderate off-white head, nice lacing. Fine aroma of malts, toffee and biscuits. The flavour is nicely balanced between the malts and the hops, also notes of biscuits and nuts, hints of caramel. Fairly dry. Distinctly hoppy finish and a long aftertaste. A very enjoyable session bitter!"
"Drinkability: Drank this one to de-stress after burning something in the kitchen. Did the job."
"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO. Thank Dog for the LCBO employees who are there to cross out the 3.7% alc/vol label and affix their own 4.4% label! There's my tax dollars well spent. Pours a slightly cloudy light gold. Light funky hop aroma. Flavour is rather nice, particularly in the bitter aftertaste."
"O: Alright for two.. no more after that before losing interest"
"I'm unsure why, but I like the bottles of St. Peter's. Reminds me of a medical flask. Pours out coppery, with no head to speak of. Their are a few bubbles, but no real foam. It actually looked a bit like the bubbles you get from soapy water. Not impressed. Bit of an earthy, mineral scent withs some floral and citrus. Nothing really remarkable. Toasty flavour, with a bit of earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. A rather plain bitter. Nothing necessarily wrong, but their is no factor that would make me come back for another."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with a small bubbly head that disappeared way too quickly. Aroma of grainy unrefined dry malt is not the most interesting. Taste is also dominated by this unrefined grainy taste with a dry ending. Carbonation is very low with no noticeable hops. Very uninteresting and boring."
"Pretty fair cask-styled light bitter,"
"I still prefer the pale ale, but that is my favourite type period. A really nice beer that lives up to it's label ""Light and Bitter"""
"D: Quite drinkable."
"I was pleasantly, somewhat surprisingly impressed with St. Peter's Best Bitter considering the long journey this bottle has endured and the fact that this style doesn't travel well. It's probably the closest thing to a true, English cask bitter I've had this side of the pond. ""Best"" bitter indeed."
"Pours a clear red/orange, decent off white head forms, big and bubbly on top, thick and compact underneath, neat. Smell is sweet, caramel, light roast, honey, citrus/floral, grass, some bread, nice. Taste is very bready, biscuits, honey/caramel, citrus, lots of floral, fresh bread graininess, grass, nice bitter finish, very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, goes down easy. Very flavourful low ABV ale, definately will session with this."
"This is a decent bitter. It could use a more expansive malt profile and more hops, but its still worth a try."
"A session beer of good bitterness at 4% ABV. Beautiful dark bottle, fresh from the LCBO. Easy medium mouthfeel colour of medium yellow with lots of head. Good bitterness,Goldings hops, moderate and on the bitter side. Nicely drinkable, suitable carbonation."
"Pours a ever so slightly hazy copper. Head is almost non-existent. Nose is fresh hops and a touch of toastiness. Definitely light bodied, and low, low carbonation with a bracing bitterness, fresh floral/grapefruit hop, with a toasty character as well. Quite dry. Very high on the drinkability scale. Refreshing, and tasty - I will admit to being a bit put off by the lackluster head formation."
"Mouthfeel: medium body, gentle carbonation, soft texture"
"Poured out a copper/amber color with a nice head that settles down with time. Smell consisted of caramel, some malts, tea-like aromas with a hint of some spiciness. A little strange I thought. Taste was ok. Light amount of malts hit first with an undertone of citrus flavors and caramel. A little dosage of burnt flavors also come up. I was expecting a lot of carbonation to mix in, but it was light as well. Wasn't as creamy as I expected it to be. Just a strange verison."
"Pours a nice bronze with a soapy-like head that is gone in a flash,light aroma I get a little brown sugar and fruitiness very English.Taste is very subtle lightly sweet and fruity with a little minty flavor that comes out as I drink more.A little watery in the mouthfeel though makes its mouthfeel get a low grad but a real quaffer something to drink alot of.True to the style and a great bottle for my collection."
"Appearance: amber brown with a bit o' head which depleats in a hurry to just a bit of ring, with no lace really. Smell is spicy and chocolaty, much like some stouts I've had. Hints of apple and coffee round out the smell. Taste is a bit burnt, with some fruits and a bit of bitter, but not a whole lot. Kind of non descript overall. The mouthfeel is too thin with not enough carbonation, which makes it feel meager and unimposing in the mouth. Its certainly drinkable, but not the greatest."
"Pouring noisily out of its uniquely-shaped oversized medicine bottle, this English bitter is a deep, clear, reddish amber, and it it topped with only a modest head. The aroma is of sweet buttered popcorn with a hoppy backbone. The taste is initially light and smoky, with undercurrents of cherry and grapefruit. It then lingers on the palate and finishes with more subtle bitterness than I anticipated. With a medium syrupy mouthfeel and only a touch of carbopnation, this brew goes down smoothly."
"I love the St. Peters' bottles, and the beers are always quite tasty. Unfortunately they suffer from green glass syndrome, and don't do so well with light. At least the new bottles are more brownish, I just wish I could be assured of freshness. I'll re-review upon attaining a fresh sample, of course."
"This beer brought back lots of memories from my two years at Oxford. It poured a clear copper tone under a very thin off white head that disappeared quite quickly. There's the typically strong barley and flowery hops in the nose. The mouth was surprisingly prickly (the price one pays for bottling, I guess), and medium-bodied. The taste was just how I remember the bitters in my favorite pubs. Just a bit sour, there's lots of malt at first, chased by an excellent hoppy bite. The aftertaste is mainly bitter, with just a touch of malt in the background. Great example of the style."
"Notes: Nice drinkability. Fresh tasting bitter. The carbonation and head level is reminiscent of a hand pulled bitter. Not an extraordinary beer, but it is very clean with a nice flavor and finish. Session quality."
"1pt .9 oz bottle. Poured a golden yellow, with very little head even with an agressive pour. Some lacing on the glass. The only aroma I could detect was tea. As in a cup of tea! Taste starts out with low carbonation, then comes the bitter, which is followed by a nice sweetness in the finish. Not the best bitter I've had, but still enjoyable."
"St. Peter's site has two bitters - the organic is brewed with Chariot malted barley and organically grown Hallertau hops. This is brewed with Pale and Crystal malts and goldings aroma hops. Pours with a head that lasts and leaves a lace. It finishes bitter - imagine that, but there is a sweet caramel nose."
