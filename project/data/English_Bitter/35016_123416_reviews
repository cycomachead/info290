"I picked this up in a standard 6 pack 12oz cans. Bitters are probably my second favorite beer outside of Belgian ales. While this one is not the best I've had it is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. You definitely get that malty ,bready, biscuit flavor, which I love. Not much lacing and mouthfeel was a little thin but over all I enjoyed this beer. I forget the price but it wasn't expensive. This will certainly end up in my fridge many times."

"Overall. I don't think CAMRA would approve as this is in the can. I had the pleasure of having this on tap and it was much improved by the change in format. Even in the can there is a taste of London. Much fainter in the can, but take an average person to a Pub in London and serve them 4 proper pints and this; I doubt most would be able to pick it out. Worth a try!"
"Enough poetic waxing! The Crack! was nice and loud so I celebrated with an inverted Glug. This caused the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, eggshell-white head with decent retention. I was fascinated to watch it slowly fall, leaving dense, sticky lacing in its wake. Who is going to clean that up? Color was a hazy Amber (SRM = > 7, "
"Sampled from the can.  Pours bright gold and not quite clear.  Huge fluffy white head. Nose is remind one of a lemon tart.  Flavor is bright, malty with a bit of lemon and grass in the back.  While not stunning, very refreshing and clean.  A nice take on this classic British style."

"Pours hazy golden with foamy head slight retention, nose of bready malts and piney spicy hops, taste is an all out attack a full dosage of spicy hops on the front with cooling bready malts and grain aftertaste, creamy almost chewy mouthfeel. I will thoroughly enjoy this beer"

"This beer is slammin. Nice golden poor. Perfect balance of hops at 4.9% abv. I could drink this beer all day long."

"O: 3.25 - Tastes like amateur homebrew to me, like someone's first pale ale. Or some bland bottom-shelf English beer."
"On the whole, I think Oasis hit this one out of the park. I have yet to drink anything else from them, but this particular offering stands out among most other recent Austin/Texas upstarts. I love having a local bitter in cans for the times I want something a little more subtle and sessionable than other great locals like Zoe and Four Squared, and even Real Ale White."

"Pours out hazy and much like a SNPA in color.  Nose is very subdued.  I don't get a whole lot of English character from the smell.  Flavor reminds me of green homebrew.  Yeast is a bit heavy handed, but not in a tasty British way.  Malt leaves a lot to be desire: a bit of toast and too grainy for me.  Hops give it a grassy and citrusy quality.  Carbonation is a touch out of hand.  Overall, this is somewhat passable, but I expected more."

"Really mellow beer, pretty easy to drink. Fruity undertones are limited but present (dark juicy fruits, black barry and fig??) but malt forward on a light body. Hop taste is minimal, not toasty either, just a fat malt bomb english bitter with some fruity notes."
""
"Interesting. I got a couple from this new brewery and I'm anxious to try the next one too. Great to see new craft breweries in TX, as I'm always wanting to buy local."

"Mouth is decent and fits the style."
