4,9,,,,,,"Poured at a perfect temperature with a huge long-lasting off-white head, lots of clingy lace and a hazy honey amber color. Aroma is malt hops grain. Flavor is complex with biscuit malt, A hint of Caramel, some fruit spice, plenty of hops, yeast and carbonic tang. Body is a little watery. A little boozy in the finish.

3.72,1.4,3.5,4,3.75,3,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into an American pub glass. A dark reddish honey gold hue with ample beige head, with the latter retaining its shape impressively well. Nose is extremely bright and fruity, with brisk orange juice, green grape, grassy, and floral notes tingling the nostrils along with a more diffuse honey malty sweetness. Tastes like dilute orange juice or mixed citrus iced tea, green herbs, dry peppery spice, a little medicinal aspirin, a initial touch of canned peach that becomes more salient over the course of many sips, and a pleasant lightly toasted caramel malt backbone. I sorta get the English bitter comparisons but this is hopped with Amarillo, man ... Closely resembles many of the brews currently sold as American session IPAs in flavor profile. Noticeably watery body which others have also described and this certainly mutes the overall flavor impact to some extent. I did not find the beer to be overly fizzy and from this and the ABV standpoint does drink like an English ale. Tangy, medicinal, gently bitter finish. The Amarillo tastes great in here (albeit mellow) and overall I am down (or up) for another. And another.","CalgaryFMC","Beers"

3.81,3.8,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a hazy medium coppery amber with a massive half glass head that slowly dissipates leaving massive lacing. Foamed a bit out of the bottle. Pleasant aroma of bready malt, citrus and grassy hops, light orange. Flavor is orange citrus and citrus hops, mild caramel malt, earthy mint family herbs, finishes with grassy hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A grassy, somewhat subdued IPA, but well flavored for the ABV. This does lean in profile to classic English IPA style, but North American Northwest hops are also evident. Nice variation on an IPA and tasty for a session ale.","LiquidAmber","Nov 19, 2013"

So it's not surprising to encounter a very big hop presence on the palate. It's not at all unbalanced and in fact the fine carbonation helps make this very drinkable.","CookstLiquor","Aug 30, 2012"

3.7,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The ultimate perfumy flavor, aroma, and peppery dryness remind me a lot of highly hopped Belgian ales. Oddly compelling, the grass, herb, and flowery character come together in a rather pleasant rendition of pale ale that defies style.","BEERchitect","Jun 24, 2012"

3.67,0,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Draught IPA from Holland, in St Paul. Well hazed orange colour with sticky lace. Soft bready malt, lemon zest and wet hay in the nose. Appetizing. Dry, pleasingly bitter with a mild, garden herb and citrus zest hop flavour. No complaints. Yeast character leans a bit toward the atypical strains of Belgium, but not as assertive. I like that. Good beer, no regrets.","mjryan","Jan 24, 2012"
3.65,-0.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of floral and bitter hops with light citrus notes. Taste is also dominated by quite strong floral and citrus notes with a semi-astringent finish. Dry caramel malt backbone can be felt though is not particularly dominant. Body is about average with good carbonation and no alcohol. Nothing earth shattering but easily drinkable and enjoyable.","Phyl21ca","Dec 14, 2011"
