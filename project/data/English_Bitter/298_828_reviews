"Not bad. Nice light amber color. Not too bitter, really not too anything. Nice balance.  I'd have another someday."
""
"Aroma: Biscuit malt with a slight skunk that swirling the glass drives off. Appearance: brilliantly clear pale gold, with a 2"" very finely bubbled persistent, lacy white foam cap. Taste: starts sweet with a touch of bitterness, balanced towards the hop, has earthy floral hop, finishes dry with a little citrus peel. Citrus in the finish. Mouthfeel: real crisp, medium body, creamy Carbonation medium."

"O - I like a nice light English bitter/pale but this one unfortunately is lacking in flavor. Unoffensive if you're looking for an easy drinker but there are better choices in the style, probably for cheaper."

"O) Good example for the style, I would wager it is very good on tap in a beer garden in the summer."
""
"Pours a hazy golden-honey in color with almost a 2-finger foamy white head that settles down to just 1mm after about 15 mins. LOTS of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of pine, some floral and hops for the most part. The taste has a bit more going on as the hops and sourness is followed up by the pine with some floral hops. The finish is dry and bitter but doesn't last too long. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. When this brew warms up is does taste a little better but still not a favorite."

"Pours a lighter clear amber with a thick cap of creamy white head. Great retention and stickier meringue-like lacing. The aroma is rich and fruity with just a hint of spice. The taste is just the way a pint of bitter should taste, with rich malt tones (caramel and fruit) and just enough hops to balance it out. The body is lighter, but feels fuller and has a nice smoothness to it. This is a bottle-conditioned ale (it says it on the bottle) so a careful pour will prevent sediment."

"This beer is a great example of simple but well executed English brewing. An excellent true to style bitter, with a nice hop punch to it."
""
"Overall - A very good and quite hoppy British bitter... recommended..."
""
"Quite a lovely intensity of flavor matching the aroma. Clean and crisp body, immensely quaffable (in large volume). I really must endeavor to practice coaxing such sublime taste and drinkability from lower gravity in my own brewing. Can't be too difficult, huh? This is easily in the top tier of bitters I've had so far."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, F13-253 bottle code. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of biscuit, white bread, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of white bread, biscuit, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bread, biscuit, light caramel, apple, pear, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice English bitter style. Well balanced pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a rich medium golden amber wihta fine half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, slightly floral, light grassy hops and a metallic hint. Flavor follows, mild biscuit malt and grassy hops with a surprisingly floral character. Finishes with mild hop bitterness and a hint of sourness. Light bodied. A fairly modestly flavoreded light bitter, but with some nice subtle elements like the hops that make it stand out. I enjoyed this bitter."

"Beer is of medium-light body, with medium-low levels of carbonation. Closes dry, with modest stickiness remaining on the palate and lips."

"This is very to-style, but I think too metallic. I like a little more bread/biscuit in my bitter. Also, the lingering bitterness is a bit too strong for my liking."
""
"It's golden with a center dome of white, and a brilliant clarity. Smells of sweet malt, some bits of crystal malt, a little metal and herbal hops. Flavor is delicate, malty, nice and enjoyable with just a touch of noble malts. Medium bodied with low carb and a wet finish. Nice beer. Quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, mild herbal hops, and a slight tea-like aroma. Taste is much the same with an earthy hop flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and super easy to drink due to how mild it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also malts initially with a fruitier and dry hoppy underbelly. Pleasant enough and my first beer at the Real Ale Festival the club was holding. A good solid session bitter with nothing that is going to upset anyone with strong or powerful flavours."
""
""
""
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours orange with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of perfume hops, biscuit and caramel malt, hints of fruit and yeast. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of earthy hops, sour dough, and some fruit. Finish is long and earthy. I could not drink much of it."
"Overall, not the best I've had. Very easy to knock these back, but this beer underwhelms on so many levels. Just ok."
""
""
""
"overall, i really like this. it is a superb new try for me and i love the flavor and the 'bitterness'. i am a bit concerned, however, that if i'm going to get this full on a beer i'm hoping it gets me where i need to be (ie. high abv) before i fill up. unfortunately, i'm not a light weight anymore.."
""
"This is lightly sweet. Lots of pale malt flavor. Not complex. The hop finishes the beer and gives it balance. There's some sourness and a touch of metal (iron) in the aftertaste. Full like a British Pale Ale typical is."
""
""
""
"Overall a decent English bitter, nothing more nothing less."
""
""
"Feel is light/medium bodied, smooth and pleasing with the carbonation aiding a refreshing moreish feel. Overall its a simple beer in in its own way, but so well brewed its deserving of its low key but respectful reputation in the UK."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very pleasant and easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer, probably the best bottle I have had in this style - I'm used to drinking these as real ales when in the UK."
""
"price point - $5.49/500ML bottle"
"Do bottled bitters from England get better than this? I'm always skeptical of bitters coming from England-since it's such a delicate style it's no wonder that so many of them don't make the journey to the US in good condition. However, this one somehow manages to preserve many of the lovely, subtle nuances that make bitters what they are-low alcohol, fruity yeast notes with a touch of earth, multi-faceted malt profile, and light but firm hop presence. Awesome."
"Pours a goldenrod color with a rocky white head. Head settles to a thin film. Smell is of apples, some biscuit, slightly herbal. Taste is grassy, lots of malty sweetness, a little grapefruit. Mouthfeel is in the thinner side, as it should be for this style, carbonation is playful. This is a great session beer. I initially bought hit looking for a random English bitter, but I think I may come back to it again. Also, fantastically sessionable."
""
"Seems to represent the bitter genre well, but for affordability here unfortunately it's obscene. By no means a worthwhile buy at this pricepoint ($9.50 a 500mL bottle)."

" I am awed by this beer. I think it is world class. If this beer were more widely available I would drink it all the time. I wish I could go to England and try more bitters. Until then, this is the top English bitter on my list. Bravo! Cheers!"
"Notes: Bluebird is a bottle conditioned ale. The bottle says this was the CAMRA Supreme Champion Beer of Britain in 1998. It also says the glass that won was served at 58 degrees Fahrenheit. My glass is probably around 50 degrees. This is a well made beer but I'm not sure how much I like it. The strong hop bitterness is slightly offputting. The overall impression I have is good due to the fine aroma, nice lacing and supple mouthfeel but my tastebuds don't love this like they do for Ruddles County."
"When a beer makes you this happy its magical :D"
"Handpumped into a Troegs pint glass, Bluebird Bitter poured a slightly hazy bronze-gold color with a large rocky cap of white head that dwindled down to a patchy layer and left some nice lacing on the glass. Mild malt sweetness in the aroma, hints of citrus and toffee. Light malts in the taste, grains, bready, again with hints of citrus, slight bitterness, subdued, earthy hops. Light-medium body, a bit watery and thin (as I find most English beers to be), but generally sessionable and easily drinkable."
"O: Good, not outstanding. It's an ESB, so bitter is what you have to expect. Would have gone well with something barbequed."
"The body is medium and it is indeed bitter, but not puckering. This beer is a classic example of this style and I'm glad that my favorite watering hole had this one in when I was there last."
"Coppery colored amber with a sudsy froth top that subsides to a foam slick, no lacing, body is very thin and under-carbonated. Very muted nose, can only just barely make out a tiny hint of vague generic hop scent, I am disappointed. The thing that this beer does do rather well, however, is in the taste. There is plenty of long drawn-out gentle generic bitterness that ebbs and flows across your tongue like a pleasant ocean current. Now that...that part is at least well done if not overly monotone. Perhaps as an effect of my bottle not being quite as fresh as it ought to be, I am detecting absolutely none of the fruity notes commonly perceived by other BA members....and this really hurts my overall impression quite a bit. If nothing else, my curiosity about English Bitters has been stoked to a higher level by this brew, enough to potentially revisit the genre in the future."
"Overall, this is a classic bitter. Especially the finish is great."
"O: Overall a solid English Bitter, maybe not enough going on for my tastes but it does make up a little ground by being sessionable."
"Not worth the fuss or price tag, IMO. There are much more interesting beers out there."
"O-Very nice. Recommended."
"I was looking for this beer for a while, and found it in a really random gas station/bottle shop. I had a couple different bottles, and the guy at the counter commented that this one was a really good beer. He was right. The first sip, a little more bitter than expected, not a bad thing. Definitely nicely balanced, not as sweetly malty as some bitters. A fine example of an English pub session brew. Would recommend this to anyone into English ales for sure."
"A rather nice bitter - the flavour doesn't try to overwhelm you but the balance is excellent. The bitterness is well attenuated, making this easy to drink. Worthy of your time."
"Overall: A very nice bitter, perhaps not what would be found across the pond, but about as good as it gets on these shores"
"Taste/mouthfeel: Delicious. Fruity esters, bready and slightly toasted malt up front. Mild diacetyl lends a very soft, smooth texture. Medium-light body. Faintly metallic in the finish with a soft earthy hop bite. Drinkability is through the roof with this one."
"This is quiet tasty and easy drinking, piece of cake very enjoyable."
"Acquired a taste for English bitters on a trip to London. This is a nice beer, good but not great. Gold to copper in color with a nice two finger head. A little of a spice or hop aroma, but not too strong. Maintains an effervessance in the glass and mouth not to hoppy or too bitter. Not as creamy as some of the hand pumped bitters."
"overall, good for the style, and glad I got to try it. I just usually perfer a beer with more aggressive flavors."
"Overall, for my first English Bitter it was a very enjoyable style and I would look very forward to trying this in England."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze, and it's very sessionable."
"This is probably the most authentic Bitter I have ever had and I am glad to finally have the experience. Not a life changing brew, but I know that if I iever make it to the UK, I will cherish the opportunity to drink beers like this from the cask all day long. If only they were cheaper, fresher and more readliy available."
"Notes: Pretty good I suppose. I seems pretty spot-on for the style, though the very active carbonation was a bit of a distraction. I personally feel rather indifferent toward it, but bitters have never really been a favorite style of mine. If you like session ales, you will want to give this one a try."
"Nice session beer that makes you want to take large sips. The pint goes bye bye before you know it."
"D: great session beer. The low ABV makes this a winner for any party or time of year. Smooth med/light body can get you drinking more than a few with ease."
"Cask fest at Cole's 2010; A nice fruity hop aroma. A light peachy colour with a whispy white head. Both Sourish and hoppy characteristics, caramel. Whole thing does not work as I am not tasting a bitter. Not too drinkable, and apparently wasn't even from the 48 hurs previous that it arrived."
"A solid beer and a good session ale."
"Pours a moderate golden-yellow color with a bit of light haze. White head with a bit of lacing. Nose brings some light floral and citrus hops as well as mild bread. A bit of butter. Taste brings hints of diacetyl again with a slight amount of light hops. Feel is creamy without much of any bitterness or sweetness. Overall, fairly plain with a few off flavors. Nothing really major wrong with it, but it really didn't bring all that much to the table."
"So this is what a good English bitter is like, is it? I like it. Drinkability is absolutely off the charts insane. This is so easy to take down. I would love to try this on cask, and will definitely be going for this again if I see it. Incredibly sessionable at 4.2%."
"What we have here is a beer that's drinkable and different enough to where it'll probably get a dozen crappy reviews. I'm certainly not a Brit (unless you count the ONE Brit ancestor in my family) but I think this beer hits the spot as it is."
"Aroma is ok, a little malts. Flavor is intersting, VERY biscuity with a nice malt finish. Also a very creamy flavor which leads to the really nice mouthfeel on this beer. This also gives this brew a great drinkibilty. However the taste is just ok, I have had better examples of the style."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable; sessionable, even. Sadly, this plastic cannot be ignored."
"Clear gold/amber with a sticky, off-white cap. Lots of clumpy lacing, a mix of large and fine bubbles. Good head retention. Toasty malt aroma, earthy hops, slight citrus and floral notes. Moderate bitterness, slightly sharp in the finish. Clean flavour, some fruitiness from the hops, floral and toasted. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation, fairly dry, nice texture. This is pretty good. Refreshing and nicely balanced."
"Drinkability: Yes, very drinkable. I could drink more of thiss. Much more. And hovering around 4% alcohol, what's gonna stop me?"
"Thoroughly enjoyable - I wish I had access to casks of proper English Bitters, as otherwise this is probably the best example of the style I have available to me..."
"D - I consider this a classic, a true English bitter w/ extra tasty seriously drinkable ale qualities - a great quaff -highly recommended!"
"Serving type: 0.5 L bottle served in pint glass."
"D-great beer. Very drinkable incredible session beer. I would drink this again."
"I usually shy away from reviewing bottled English beer, as bottles from England tend to be very low-turnover items at any liquor store, this is an exception, relatively sure this was a fresh bottle. This is a great, solid beer. It's not too challenging and it's not supposed to be, no, it's remarkable that such a small beer packs as much flavor as it does."
"Poured into a wheat type glass. Beautiful orange/gold/amber color with a thick creamy white head. I just loved the look of this beer. Head hangs around for a long time but was surprised by only sporatic lacing. The taste is crisp and clean, very well balanced. Citrus and floral hints. A really good drinking beer and at such a low alcohol level could drink it all night long."
"The taste is similar, light but firm, and complex. It has clear lemon, hints of woody herbs, toasted grain, and a faint hint of sweet-sour fruit (plums and pear) before a dry, lightly bitter finish that is leafy with some lemon and grain. A light aftertaste of caramelly grain, lemon, herb and yeast then takes over. A light yeatiness runs throughout. Compared to, say Ridgeway Bitter, it is a little more bitter and leafy and less lemony and yeasty."
"I would love to try this on cask but in the bottle it was just plain bland and unimpressive."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, although this beer doesn't really live up to the ""bitter"" part of its name, it's still a good sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D - ABV is well within reason. Carbonation is a bit filling after one 500ml bottle. Not particularly overwhelming in flavors."
"Pours a clear golden color with a small white head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has a spicy and slightly citrus hop aroma. The Maris Otter malt lends some cracker like quality to the aroma. A mild flavor with some spice and citrus notes. Dry, cracker like malt flavor. Bitterness is low. Challenger hops I have found is not a favorite of mine. Light body with a nice carbonation. It is not as impressive as cask conditioned or nitro charged English ales that I have had the pleasure of drinking. Extremely easy drinking and quite enjoyable overall. The only drinkability fault is the price of a bottle."
"D= Highly drinkable session bitter here. Nothing world class, but a solid ale all the same. I would happily drink a bunch of these in a nice pub."
"50cl bottle. Pours a mostly clear amber with a fluffy eggshell head that lasts. A bit of sediment. Smells surprisingly citric and fruity thanks to both the yeast and the strong hoppy character. Sweet Maris Otter in the background. Tastes quite malty, with a sweet, bready earthiness that melds with light floral hops and more understated citrus. Medium body with light-medium carbonation. Very nice bitter."
"D: I'd love to polish off a bunch of these, a pint at a time, on a warm evening in my neighborhood pub."
"this might be a true english bitter but give me a Honkers over this"
"Pours a pleasing golden color, with a fluffy white head that leaves lacing down the glass. There are some floaters of yeast -- fine by me. The smell is biscuit, straw, some mild citrus notes. The taste is grain, mineral, again the mild citrus, and a finish that's bitter but mellow. The mouthfeel is a tad thin, very light carbonation, with a finish that's just slightly dry. It's immensely drinkable, and would make a perfect session beer but for the rather staggering price per bottle. Wish someone around here would get this for growler fills."
"A half liter bottle poured into my Imperial pint glass. Hazy apricot in color with a healthy two fingers of lingering, fluffy white head. A great looking pour. Smells of mild biscuit and caramel malt, fall fruits such as pear and apple, and grassy hops. Flavor carries on from the nose with the addition of bitter, mildly floral hops, and lightly toasted bread. Awesome stuff! A notch above medium bodied and amply carbonated. To hell with the price, I could drink this all day long. This must be heaven on cask."
"Had this in 500 ml bottle at the Capital Ale House In Richmond Downtown. It pours a burnt orange with a half-inch of head in a pint glass. Aromas pfcaramel, orange, and some apple. A nice mild taste with caramael and some apple. A little citric bitterness near the end. Very smooth, and a pleasure to drink. Wish I could get this beer in Houston. Will have again."
"This is a very nice bitter that I would certainly like to have again. This is one I would love to have on cask."
"Very drinkable."
"Bluebird Bitter pours a slightly hazy orange/amber with a creamy white head that quickly thins out. Carbonation is subtle. The smell at first was not real present. Perhaps the brew was too cold. As it warmed, the maltiness came on. Doughy, with a very floral hop aroma. The taste was mind blowing. Slightly sweet and malty, with hints of caramel and toast. The finish was dry and hoppy, with floral and grassy tones. This beer is medium bodied, dry, and very smooth. I could drink this over and over. One of the best session brews I have had to date."
"poured from a bottle into imperial etched bottom pint glass. Poured light copper with little head, however it retained and there was a little lacing. taste at first was light, almost seemed watered down. after a few more sips, i picked up light floral hops with a stronger malt backbone and light bitterness. carbonation was light and easy going. with an ABV of 4.2%, this is BEYOND drinkable! I could pound these out all night and feel like a champ. well done and a perfect english bitter."
"overall still easily drinkable. i did really like the hoppiness, but i also wanted more malt balance from this english brew."
"I poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a pale, clear gold in color with a 2 finger white head. The head has nice retention and leaves a lot of lacing. The aroma has a bit of a grassy smell, but not much gping on. The flavor has a pleasent hoppy bitterness, and a crisp dry finish. The beer is light bodied with moderate carbonation and would be a great session beer. This was not my favorite, an ok beer that would be much better either on tap or on cask."
"Nicely whipped up and thick white foam of a head, no lack of lacing, settles into a one finger level before finally dissolving. Light orange-yellow color, completely transparent and squeaky clean in appearance, lightens some at the rims, not many bubbles apparent throughout. Crisp, briskly paced nose of green, oily hops, pressed flower petals, wet mineral shards, as it warms you get more malt softness to cushion any rougher edges, finishes with ruby to pink grapefruit sour and sweet notes. Medium-bodied, buoyed by a consistent carbonated fizz which keeps the mouth full. That said, plenty of spring to its step, the pink grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus never blows you away but sticks around. Light biscuit and scone breadiness, texture is dry overall but pliant, not desiccating. The grass and grain bits fit with the lighter tea leaf and almost chalkiness. Even after the flavors subside, you feel the gentle imprint on your palate. It's got that old school vibe."
"The only thing prohibitive about Bluebird is the price and availability, otherwise I would drink this every day."
"Clear copper with one finger white head. Some lacings. Aroma is malty and apple. Taste is sweet malts with a good amount of hop bitters. Dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth partly due to low carbonation. Superbly drinkable with the 4.2% abv. I could drink this all evening."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable. I could easily drink a few pints of this with dinner."
"A really nice beer. This could easily be a sesssion beer to drink all night. Light in abv so its drinkable yet has plenty of flavor so you WANT to drink this one. I really like this style and this was a great example of the style. Definitely recommend."
"Light, malty and delicious, Bluebird Bitter is, to me, a very English beer, and I'm happy to get a hold of a bottle around here. It has a very nice, sweet malt character balanced well by some floral-mineral hops. It's fairly dry for the caramel malt, but then it's not a very strong beer. The lack of strength seems to take something away from the aroma, but I imagine this and all of my ratings would rise if I had it out of a cask at a pub near the brewery. It's a great session beer that actually lives up to the spirit of a session beer. One could have quite a few glasses of this stuff. The appearance is bright and amber with pretty good lacing. The flavor is nicely bitter from the hops with good balancing malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is very nice, creamy with gentle and fine hop bite. It's hard for me to really understand English Bitters having never been to an English pub with fresh casks. So, my scores could radically change once I get more experience under my belt."
"As a fat slice of meatloaf is to comfort food, Bluebird Bitter makes for a memorable glass of comfort beer. Medium-bright yellow in color, it develops a tight head that lingers for the ride to the bottom of the glass leaving lace everywhere. There's a nice citurusy hops hit in the nose, somewhat mellowed by the malt. The taste is cleanly divided by earthy malt in the front, decent fizz in the middle and then a fruity, orange-peel, hoppy tang that goes all the way down the back of your throat. Low ABV is an advantage, too. An all-around great beer, neck-and-neck with Harviestoun's Bitter and Twisted."
"Pours a pale amber brown with a thin, tightly beaded head and some nice lacing. Classic biscuity malt in the nose with a touch of crisp minerality. Gentle biscuity malt in the mouth with a clean, slightly chalky finish. Fairly dry with some light, earthy hops. A classic bitter, soothing and satisfying."
"I feel inspired to search out some cask ales. I just wish this beer was a bit more affordable. It would be great for a party. I'll definitely pick it up again."
"Pours a apple-cider colored body that is seethru with good carbonation, leading to an almost three-finger high head that is rocky. Mild citric hop notes along with herbal and floral tones; tea like. Very smooth and creamy, mild hop bitterness with a slightly dry backbite. A light-bodied beer that goes down easy and again reminds of iced tea with lemon. Some sweetness is tucked in there too (maybe caramel or honey). An easy drinking beer that is great to relax with."
"Drinkability - ∞"
"D - Definitely a session-designed brew. This is easy going and smooth, but has enough gripping hop bitterness to keep it interesting."
"Exactly what I expect in an English bitter: smooth, well-balanced, and leaving me wanting more."
"Pours a clear golden copper with almost zero head. Smell is lightly malty and citrus. Taste is surprisingly citrusy upfront, with a nice clean malt middle, and a toasty malty finish. There is also a hint of earthy hops in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation levels low. Very drinkable, this is an excellent session beer. I fear that the trip overseas has decreased the quality of this beer, I suspect if I had this at the source on cask I would be giving it a near perfect rating. Still quite good from the bottle."
"Overall (consider my favorite beers tend to be really hoppy) this is a very good, very drinkable beer, but probably one I would only drink in teh scenario where I have all afternoon or night to hang out with friends and didn't want to fill up (or booze out) too quickly..."
"Honey colored brew with decent off white head and nice yeast sediment on the bottom. Weak but pleasant aroma of alcohol with some floral notes. Grainy, cereal-like, alcohol in the forefront of the taste. A bit malty with no carbonation on the palate make for a medium bodied beer that is an enjoyable autumn seasonal."
"Crisp and dry. A bitter done especially well. Not much to look at, not much to smell, a grateful experience too taste. Sweet turned pale ale bite; California Common's papa. Reserved, never tap dancing with hops or pole dancing with malt; remains centered and elegant. Light breads and crisp hops, moderately balanced. Excellent craft displayed. The English reserve the right to demand reverance."
"D: Light body, light on flavor and overall just a moderate drink."
"Pours a cloudy orange/gold color with a one finger thick white head with good retention and lacing. Fruity, cherry, floral malt aromas. Up front lemon & orange hop flavors leading to some tea flavor ending malty and smooth. Medium body, light carbonation, there is a creamy mouthfeel that is easy to drink."
"Really solid stuff here. A good English session brew."
"D: Bitters are a style the English do well. This is a pretty good example of one. It's well-balanced and goes down easy. That being said, it didn't knock my socks off."
"Not a bad beer to be had, but just a little pricey for what you get in the end."
"I must say I was quite impressed with this English Bitter. It makes me want to grab a plane to England and try every bitter I can find. I wish we had a better selection of these in Minnesota. I will be grabbing this again for sure. It definitely is a session beer. I must find more bitters like this."
"Palate has a tea like component also, with some dry biscuits, gentle citrus, and overall is very medium to thin bodied. This is extraordinarily drinkable and pleasant. No real flaws to complain about. Balanced, sessionable ale that doesn't disappoint."
"Poured an attractive clear amber with a smallish creamy white head on top. Aroma is slightly sweet with caramel tones and a light grassy hop character. Mouthfeel was nice, maybe a tad on the thin side. Flavor is very well-balanced with caramel, sweetness and light hoppy bitterness. Drinkability is quite high on this one. Nice session beer."
"This would be a great session Beer for anyone who can afford more than a couple."
"D = This is an imminently pleasant session beer. I would highly recommend it for that purpose."
"Pours a nice light amber with a great head and great lacing, along with a bit of sediment floating around for a few minutes. Excellent aroma, a very crisp beer with light floral scents, from both the hops and malts. An excellent taste, a nice hop/malt merging with a great slightly hoppy tang at the end. It goes down extremely easily. One of the best bitters I've ever had."
" An awesome brew here. Nothing out of control but a good kick in the pants bittering hop and a refreshing choice if bitter is your thing."
"It pours into the glass a slightly cloudy dark amber, very inviting. Aroma is fairly malty and has some good hops hints. Flavor is bitter but not nastily so, has both hoppy and malty components, a little thin but still pleasant and satisfying. A good lunch beer."
"Easy to drink, overpriced and kind of boring."
"500ml. glass bottle- color of medium gold, with a quickly dissipating thick light white colored head - nose of pale hops, stale, and sweat  taste of pale hops, ever so slight malts, and very mild- body is low viscosity, and with high to medium carbonation  aftertaste of sweat, and light hops"
"Kinda honey amber with a thin white head. Dry cracker aroma with a faint hint of minerals. The flavor is a mild blend of caramel and apples pinned to the light, dry malt backbone with its hint of minerals and slight acidity. There are better out there."
"Overall, a decent bitter/session ale but it's pretty subdued and not very interesting."
"Nothing to remember."
"I was in the mood for a ""real"" British style ale and I wasn't disappointed with this offering. The pour is pretty frothy with a head that lingers and has some decent lacing. The smell is mostly sweet bisquit malt, some hops, some floral notes in there too. The smell is the low point, and it isn't that low, if you want to characterize it as such. The taste is a very nice dry British ale at its core, with just enough hops and malts to create a fine balance. There is an interesting dandelion taste at the back end that I thought was quite good and distinctive. On the bottle they label it as geranium. Gernanium or dandelion, either way it is a special bonus that is quite enjoyable. This ale is a typical British style ale, and if you are in the mood for one, or if the style is to your liking, you won't go wrong here. The floral notes only add to the experience. L'Chaim."
"This beer does what it should, which is provide a crisp malt flavor with a slight bitterness. Nothing overpowering, which is fine with me. This is the perfect session beer. Recommended."
"Light body with low to moderate carbonation makes for a smooth and extremely quaffable beer. This is what a session beer is all about, too bad it has such a short shelf life and non-obvious dating scheme."
"D: Exceptional. Wonderfully complex and light bodied."
"This is one fine beer, though in a bottle. Would really love to catch this one on cask. Very drinkable..."
"Drinkability- Definately better than the lambics here on drinkability. Also, this is better than most beers on drinkability. It is unfortunate that the cask conditioned aspect can't be ported over to bottles without comprimising the flavor. I would love to have this by the case!"
"Smooth and delicious. Thick and creamy with good viscosity. Cereal grain and toffee malt backed by flavors of butterscotch and caramel. Nice hop bitterness on the mid palate and finish. I could honestly drink this beer on cask every waking moment."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with an average off-white head. The smell is a bit faint, a woody caramel malt with a slight touch of grassy hop. The taste is a mix of toasted/caramel malt, has an almost lemony/grassy bitterness to it, finishes with a green apple tartness. It has a unsweetened tea like characteristics. The feel is rather smooth, not too carbonated, moderate body, finishes astringent. A good fairly balanced brew, nice subtle flavors nothing outstanding, finishes a bit dry. Another good beer from this brewery."
"nice brew. i certainly could enjoy dozens on 'em with some fish and chips"
"Eric"
"50cl brown bottle from Lou's in Augusta. Translucent slightly darker amber body with a quarter inch of off-white head that dissipates quickly. Bitter hops dominate the aroma with a good bit of caramel malt. Hop bitterness, burnt tobacco-like quality toward the finish, with caramel malt to support. Slightly harsher than what I was expecting, but fairly well-balanced and more complex than some bitters. Also, very drinkable, due to the tastiness and the lighter body. Turns out to be a great solid ale, and if it weren't so pricey, it definitely would become a frequent favorite."
"This is quite the session beer. On cask at DBA. Poured a rich earthy brown with a small head from the cask. SOme lacing present but not much due to the serving style. Smell was of earthy malt with a decidedly English hop character. Taste was very nice, a very rich and mild hoppiness balanced against the sweet malt. Nothing particularly blew me away about the taste but it did what a bitter is supposed to. Balanced and mild, perfect for having a few down at the pub. Mouthfeel was very rich as would be expected from the cask."
"pours a light honey/amber with minimal head. smelling it several times at first, i swear i got petrol notes. also some grassy/vegetal aromas. taste is a very light malt sweetness upfront with a light malt sweetness at the end. relatively short finish. light mouthfeel with nice bottle-conditioned fermentation, crisp. drinkability is good due to the low abv, but then again not interesting enough to want to keep tasting it."
"-Oelergud"
"A superior english bitter and one I'll certainly be looking out for on cask."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I could see a few ofthese in my future."
"50cl Bottle with BBF 2 11 06 - not sure if that is the bottled date or the best before date. Either way it must be older than it should be. Poured into a pint glass a copper orange color with a nice white head that falls slowly into a nice covering. The smell is very nice with sweet malt, grassy hops, and a slight lemon character. The taste follows suit with clean crisp flavor the is complex for something of this abv. The hops are still present with a nice refreshing bite and the malt goes from mild to sweet and buttery. Mouthfeel and drinkablility is very nice...crisp and refreshing. I can not say have had many ""fresh"" bitter syte beers, but I am beginning to really appreciate the style. The delicate flavors and craftmanship are well done in a beer with this low an abv."
"While I do love this brew, I can't very well say it will take the place of Young's S.L.A. in my heart. But it will always hold the place of that girlfriend you never really had and could never really get. Deep Huh?"
"Easy to drink, not a masterpiece but a pleasant brew."
"Drinkability: Good balance of malt, citrusy hops, and bitterness, but nothing that special."
"Even as a low ABV session beer....there's much better choices out there."
"A very nice ""sessionable"" English ale. Easily drinkable, aromatic, with a nice taste and modest abv. Too bad that it comes in pretty costly singles. Would get more of for a good ""session"" if it were in 6-Packs and more affordable. An innovative, enjoyable Bitter."
"a beer that has some interesting character but not at all what i expected for the style. i can't say that i reccommend it."
"Beer-wise, the brew was ok-- average on all fronts. However, for a bitter, I thought the fruity flavors were too prevelent. For an English Pale, the body was too low. The beer seems to be caught between a few different styles and cause confusion. Estery / fruity flavors a high and flavorful, but the body seems to give way far too soon. A pronounced bitterness works well for many Brittish styles. However, the balance is not there for a Pale, and the clean, crisp feel is not there for a Bitter or an ESB. The caramel / bready flavors are nice, but get dwarfed a bit by the peaches / pear / apple flavors. The bottle conditioning gives a richer, earthier flavor and texture which helps. All in all, an ok beer...with schitzophrenia."
"The mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery as well, though with the low alcohol content, it would be pretty sessionable. But there are many better ales out there that I'd prefer to have for that purpose, so I doubt I'll be going for this one again."
"Not sure what to make of this one. I once had it on tap and it sorta blew me away; great, caramel maltiness with a crisp hop bite, all the while being an exceedingly drinkable session brew. The bottled version, which Im reviewing now, pales in comparison. The tangy hop bite is still pretty perky, but the malt character isnt nearly as bright and the overall flavor is a bit watery. On top of that, the graininess is a little flat in the finish. Then again, lightness in flavor, and the subsequent drinkability, are a trademarks of this style, and the finish features a nice bit of that tasty hop spice. Still, I was really excited to find this one in a bottle having tried it on-tap, but sadly, a bit disappointing comparatively. However, its not bad, recommended."
"BB 17-05-07. Not much head and amberbrown beer. First poor clear 2 nd hazy. Nose shows fine challenger hops, some sweet maltyness in back and bit of butter to cream the nose. Taste is dry but with bit of maltyness before going into a fine aromatic bitterness. Mabey to me bit watery but certainly something to do with not visiting the style regulary. Well drinkable and enjoyable though."
"Easy to swallow, but not a beer that provides great pleasure. Interesting style, and oddly drinkable."
"And whenst fresh is tasty."
"The beer poured a light amber with a bit of white lace. The aroma was of bitter hops. The taste was very soft malt flavor that moved quickly to hops then finished with a bit of vanilla. The feel was medium and oily. A good beer with lots of delicate flavors and textures. Probably a good single or session beer. Could go well with fish but strong food would overpower this beer."
"Filled up an imperial pint nicely with a light amber color and short, loose head. Smell was mild and hard to detect at time, but nice. Tasted of lightly carmelized malts with subtle spices. Something happened during the course of my drink and the taste soured. What the hell is that? At first it was one of the best session beers I've tried, a while later its soured beer. I will say it was good enough to give another go."
"Poured a golden orange with a big frothy head. Pretty active and carbonated with streams of bubbles rising up through the beer. Aroma is light but slightly citrusy and spicy. Light malt, citrus and tropical flavours. Crisp finish. Great easy drinking beer, definitely sessionable as English bitters typically are. Wish I could get more of it here as I got this one as a gift from wl0307 while visiting London."
"This is a very drinkable beverage, although a little pricey here in Chicago."
"I would avoid this in the future, to many good English alternatives."
"The pour into my trusty La Moneuse tulip raises an off-white, big bubbled, lasting head, one finger high. As it falls, it leaves lovely lacing. Sparse, slow columns of bubbles rise through the penny-colored, transparent liquid. Superb! I'd only wish for longer head retention. Smells strongly of Maris Otter, citrusy hops, and caramel. Taste is mellow throughout the beginning, building a mild hop kick. Bitterness is kept to a minimum. Ends with a biscuity, sweet tang. Mouthfeel is mild, thin, and carbonation is almost unnoticable. An easy quaffer. A good beer, but I think I've had a fresher bottle before. I may revisit."
"Notes: I liked it and my next comment was not considered in the review as the beer was good but damn! $$$ for such a smallish brew this is mad money even by import standards."
"Pours very clear golden light brown. Small creamy head with good lace and retention. Aroma is lightly toasted caramel malts over leafy hops and hard water. Flavor is really poor. Fizzy metallic water that leads directly to a bitter hop finish. No malt flavor. Thin, watery, strongly carbonated body. Will definitely not be buying this again."
"(looking at other's comments, ...huh, maybe I got a bad batch?)"
"The beer is an amber color, with about a 1/2 inch white head which disappears pretty quickly. Bluebird Bitter has a nice aroma, it's pretty citrusy (orange/grapefruit) and hoppy. It has a mild citrusy hops taste and also a slight bread/yeast taste, with a low to medium bitter aftertaste. Nothing overpowering there. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, watery with not too much carbonation at all. It is very easy to drink, very crisp. I think it makes for a great session beer because of the low alcohol content, and that it has some taste too. For the style, it's a pretty good beer."
"D: If the diacetyl taste would go away this would be a much better beer. I am going to finish it all, but I do think it was a decent beer all in all and come the hot days of summer might find me buying a few more of these."
"very good drinkability due to good flvor and smell and possibly in part to a little bit of a lighter body. i'd have no prolem putting away more than a few pints of this."
"Pours with a substantial head that fades but leaves lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose is heavy on apple and various citrus fruits with a touch of doughiness underneath. The first taste is of acidic fruits and bitter hops, with a layering of slight, pale malts filtering in afterward. The mouthfeel is smooth and thin but not really watery. The emphasis here is on drinkablility -- the smooth mouthfeel, pleasant-and-not-overwhleming flavors and well integrated hops make for a brew that is both interesting and easy to drink."
"The closest on bottle to a cask conditioned ale that I have had yet. Pours with little or no head. Very little carbonation and aroma. Suprisingly hoppy, yet not overpowering. Very refreshing and well balanced. If I wanted to introduce someone to a cask conditioned beer to someone who hasn't been to the UK or hasn't had a cask here I would serve them this.I wish it came in at least a four pack."
"A very nice example of the style..certainlly not a ""big"" beer but a tasty one and its low alcohol lends well to it being a great session choice..if one could afford it at the price."
"Bluebird Bitter pours a nice copper orange color with a small white head from a 50cl brown bottle. Really nice aroma, hops and citrus are noticeable. Much lighter mouthfeel than I was expecting. No real off tastes. Although the bottle describes the taste as resinous hops, which I would agree with, it really isn't all that hoppy. It's really quite a light beer, frankly it's just not very flavorful. I can't say that I could recommend this."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and moderately carbonated."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Active and very responsive in the mouth, relatively smooth going down. Unfortunately, the negative impressions of smell and taste outweigh the positive, and this beer finds its place next to the curb on Memory Lane."
"I had a nice bitter at CBC this weekend and was reminded how great the style is, so I went out and bought a few authentic, English style bitters. I've had this before, but it was quite a while ago, at the Moan and Dove, which I sadly can't go to as frequently as before. Pours a crystal clear apple juice amber color, with plenty of quickly rising bubbles. Very active and carbonated apparantly. And a decent, but fast fading head. Once again, really a super clear beer here. Smells sharp - nice hop presence here, spicy English style all the way here, although more pronounced than usual. I'm definitely picking up on some sweet, root beer scents as well, which is interesting. Soft fruity esters all over the place and a nice carmel malt backdrop. Mmm, so tasty. As much as I love ballsy, overly hoppy American IPAs and what not, there's nothing that beats a well made, perfectly subtle beer, and that's what this is in my opinion. The complexity is easy to overlook here. The spicy, herbal hops, the toffee like maltiness, and the fruityness come together perfectly. The spicy and floral English Challanger (I read the label) hops, are frickin awesome. The appley, almost grapey juicy fruityness gives the beer so much character. And the classic English maltiness anchors the beer perfectly. Wow, what a piece of work here. Lively floaty mouthfeel, without being watery, though a little less carbonation might benefit. Super session beer at 4 point something ABV. I wish more US brewers could pull this off. I know everyone's got their own tastes, but If you don't like this beer, you've got ants in your pants. Dig into the subtleties."
"Had this at a beer and cheese tasting. It was paired with Sharpham Rustice - Devon. Not much in the way of a head or lacing. Aroma is good with a good bit of citrus hops. This would make a decent session beer on a hot summer day. This beer tasted better as it warmed up."
"The mouthfeel is not thin and it feels like there is some character to this highly drinkable ale."
"So simple and so small, yet very hoppy and flavorful. This beer is such a contradiction in tastes. Sort of the pilsner of english bitters. I'm surprised this isn't labeled as a mild. Just a great simple tasty session beer."
"Drinkability: Very high. Low alcohol content packed with enough flavor and a light body make this a pretty good session beer. It's price, however, takes something away from that."
"An interesting bitter. Almost Hefe or Saison-like in character with its fruity aromas and flavors. According to the label this is due to higher fermentation temps. Not exactly your standard bitter, but quite good."
"Don't get discouraged by the citrus tastes; it does finish with a nice hop taste, though not a big, bold assault like you get with some American craft brews these days. Very nicely balanced and an excellent, tasty example of the Bitter style of British ales. Highly recommended."
"Man did I like this beer. I liked it so much I picked up another few bottles before reviewing. This baby pours out a pretty amber color with a nice creamish color head that hangs around for a bit. It actually does have a tasty citrus kind of smell too. I have to say this baby has an awesome tart flavour that is followed up by a pleasant bittery followthrough. This is one I would love to sit around drinking all day watching sports on TV if it weren't like 3.00 a bottle. That's the only thing for me that prevents this from being a regular session beer."
"Overall a pretty darn good beer. Wonderful balance and so very refreshing. Could enjoy this one all day. If i was rich and didnt worry about money, then i would buy a bunch of these and have them as a great session beer. But it is a touch bland, which i think would help for session beers, but not if your looking for a totally just one beer with loads of flavor."
"Beer pours a solid golden color with a light coating of foamy head and sparse bubbles popping off the bottom to maintain things. Nose is very nice. I get notes of crisp British hop. Not earthy, but almost resinous and green. Malty character is nice and toasty, but hops dominate this one. I am intrigued. Flavor is similar to the nose. Toasy British malt dominates, with a very fresh and green hop playing in there as well. Bitterness is mild and just enough to play well with the malt backbone. I think this is a well built beer. Feel is moderate with a very light to light moderate carbonation...just enough to let me know it is there. Easily a session brew. Full flavor with nothing to detract from the drinkability in the form of alcohol or off flavors. This is another British brew I've had that is drawing me closer to the subtle styles. I like the good flavor and lighter alcohol."
"Pours a copper color with lots of bits of yeast floating around. This brew has yeasty aroma with plenty of biscuit maltiness and just a hint of citrus. The taste is nice and mild. The hops are present but not overpowering, in fact they balance well with the slightly sweet malts. This is an exceptional brew and a great example of an English bitter, gotta say that I love this brew."
"Drinkability: Very excellent. The nice bitter-malty beginning to the sip combined with the nice clean finish could keep me drinking this all night."
"Poured a clear orange color, with a thin head and lightly carbonated. Smell was moderately hoppy, with a spiciness to it. Taste was classic English bitter beer style, with the hops coming through, but not overpowering. Thought it was a bit weak on the palate, but that may be due mostly to the style. Highly drinkable, and reminded me of other beers in this style that I've had in the UK. A solid beer but nothing that really jumps out at you."
"4.2%, easy drinking, and approx. $3 for 1 pt .9 fl oz add up to great drinkability."
"light finish good bitter a good beer all-around!!"
"its crisp and the bitterness makes your mouth a little cottony, but it has a pretty good flavor. i couldnt drink a bitter like this all the time, but its interesting once in a while."
"Pours a nice golden color with a beautiful white head that quickly recedes. Smell spicy and fruity, faintly citrusy and enticing. The taste seems biscuity, buttery and faintly hoppy with notes of citrus and spice. Mouthfeel is thin, but not too thin... seems about right for a bitter. Drinkability? I'd be happy to drink more and suspect that if this was more widely available, I'd be drinking it often. Good beer."
"D: compared with my previous note of this beer about four months ago, I can't believe how similar impressions I've got from the flavour yet it's quite different on the nose... My knowledge is too limited to explain this fact, but the more I drink this beer, the more I'm certain that it's one of my all-time favourite sessions bitters!!"
"Definitely a drinkable session beer but nothing special."
"Like I said earlier, this is probably one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. I could drink this all night if only it were slightly more affordable."
"The taste is also fruity with maybe a lemony note in the background but up front, it's about the malt. A very drinkable English Bitter, it's one of my favourites of the style."
"On tap at The Muddy Pig, this style of beer(English bitter) was served way too cold, so I drank something else while waiting for it to warm up. It is a nice pale amber in color, with a minimal head that doesn't last. There is no lacing on the glass. There is no discernable odor at first, but as it warmed up I could smell a light maltiness. The taste is fruity, with elements of peach, apricot, and toasted malt. There is just a hint of bitterness on the tip of the tongue at the finish, but it doesn't last. This is a balanced nice tasting beer. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would like, but it goes down easily. I have a feeling that this would be tremendous if served on cask. As it is, it's good, just not extraordinary."
"At 4.2%ABV I could drink this all day and all night. Great to see a low alcohol but very flavorful beer out there. Too bad the price tag is steep for a 4.2% beer"
"If nothing else, it is drinkable but if a beer like this fails to be drinkable then somebody really screwed-up! Overall, this is a perfectly fine beer I mean it is decent but like I said before, I dont expect to visit this beer often. My bottle was purchased in Omaha."
"Bluebird bitter has a nice golden color, and not much head, at least not when I poured it from a bottle. It smells like that cheap, sweat, soft and sticky candy shaped like fruits. There is a pronounced hop taste but not much else. What surprised me and in contradiction with my high expectations was a lack of body. But it's still a decent bitter."
"Bluedird pours golden with very little head. I detect sugary sweet baked goods with a grassy hop aroma. Nothing but hop flavor. Again grassy and floral are the prominent flavors. Finished quite dry, but lingered a touch. Overall not a bad pint at all."
"Yeast and lots of it! Crystal yellow with a frothy white head that faded quickly. Leaves a coat of yeast at the bottom of the bottle that you can swirl into the beer if you think of it ahead of time. A bit of citrus on the nose but rather subdued. A sharp hoppiness to it, some earthy almost peaty tones. A tad of an aftertaste that was kinda soapy and unpleasant. Felt rather chewey for a thinner style and it was welcomed."
"Pair with chicken or barbecued leg of lamb encrusted with English whole grain mustard, pepper and sage. For a beer with so much diacetyl (kept in check by hops even as it warms) this was exceptionall drinkable. Makes me want to try their Bluebird XB with the Mt. Hood hops."
"Pours a clear copper color with a modest but lasting head. Lots of yeast floating around chunkstyle in the bottle, which I must say was a bit off-putting. Very herbal hop aroma that suggested some intensity, but the flavor was actually quite mild. Soft herbal hop bitterness, backed by a nice toasty maltiness. Smooth and buttery, dry and extremely drinkable. If you want an old school English ale, this is the one. It would be a great session beer, too, if it wasn't so damned expensive ($3.99 / bottle)."
"Very drinkable brew, mild yet interesting and pleasant."
"Drinkability and Notes  One of the better bitters that I have had and a great session beer. It may be a bit expensive to actually be a regular session beer but that it is certainly easy to drink. The poor head retention is probably my biggest complaint, but the flavor and smell are great."
"orange yellow. malty nose with very little in the hop department. malt flavor dominates with molasses and some residual hop bitterness. some light fruit notes, perhaps apple or peach. virtually no aftertaste. super drinkable and perhaps the ultimate session beer, as it has been declared in the uk. if there is one problem, its a slight lack of flavor. otherwise, a decent pour and a lunchtime staple."
"My first true English bitter. Bluebird's color is a hazy copper with a creamy, average-sized head. Retention consists of a nice, short layer of cream. Aroma is mainly of malts, similar to caramel aroma, but with their own distinct smell. A light dose of English hop is also noted. The taste is maltier than expected, but there are still enough hops to go around. Hop taste is very different from the American styles that I am used to. Bitterness is there, but not extreme. My first brush with an English bitter leaves me with respect for Bluebird, but also the realization that this isn't probably going to be one of my favorite styles. A good beer, but not worth $3.99 to me."
"Poured into a pint tumbler a clear light brown color with golden highlights. A white head forms then falls quickly, but rising carbonation and groups of suds continue swirling around the surface of the ale. Smells of orangey hops, a little bit floral, with malt way in the background. The taste again is hops first, then a medium maltiness. Light bodied, with pretty strong carbonation. It doesn't stand up against a cold and rainy night like this one, but it will make a smart session brew going into the summer heat."
"Just a great mouthfeel, soft with low carbonation. It is also slightly oily and the hops coat your mouth. Almost a perfect example of a session beer. Moderate alcohol levels combined with a tasty, complex and interesting beer. Well done and well worth the $2.49 at Sams Liquors in Downers Grove."
"Very smooth and drinkable. Excellent for a session."
"Very easy session brew, and a welcome break from the extreme, power-hopped ales I usually choose to drink."
"(Thanks to Joshua Ablett for the sample.)"
"The smell has an herbal hoppy start, followed by subtle yeast and malt aromas. Likewise the taste is at first gently bitter hops, then buttery malt, clean and fruity. The plentiful piney hops comes full circle and finishes. The bottle conditioning lends a slight earthy (yeasty?) note to the aftertaste. Very smooth, nothing assertive, but it's well balanced and refreshing."
"Had this on cask last evening, it was pulled to a golden color with the top half having a creamy look that broke to a fairly nice white head. After a few minutes the entire brew had that golden color while the head continued to break down quite rapidly. The aromas from this brew are malt with a floral hop note, not as pronounced as when I just had it on tap. The taste is very smooth with sweet malt like taste leads and breaks to a bitterness from the hops that does not last long but is noticeable. Over all this is not a bad brew but think I liked the on tap version a bit more."
"Drinkablity -- yes!"
"Great from the bottle, even better on Cask though!"
"The aromas are intense with pine, mint, lemon peel and roasted nutshell resins. The malt profile is honey-like on the nose: clear and purposeful. The color is burnt gold. The texture is distinctly lighter-bodied with sappy iron and slate resins defining the cadence and cascade of honey flavor. This is a hoppy ale that can be consumed carelessly from a picnic basket. Nothing heavy or weird, just flowery yellow buds and clean, pulpy yellow fruits. The finish is as dry as gin."
"You should also check out Old Man, which is darker and heavier."
"This is a nice beer to have when looking for something easy drinking, simple, and enjoyable. Not a complex, full beer that makes yoou want to think about it and analyze it, but that's ok- sometimes this is exactly what you want."
"Drinkability: Just rolls right down."
"Somewhat hazy golden amber color with a hint of rust as well. Head is rather compact and off-white. What it lacks in volume it makes up for in a persistent cling. Pleasantly sweet malt smell with a slight bite of crisp hops. Predictably sweet and malty up front, but those flavors are quickly displaced by a lasting hop bitterness. Mouthfeel seems a bit oily but does little to take away from what is a pretty drinkable beer."
"I was fortunate to have a cask-conditioned pint or two of this award winning brew at the Flying Pig in Malvern, PA. It poured a burnt orange color with an almond-colored head. It was remarkablly clear with abundant lacing throughout the tasting experience. There was a faint fragrance of floral hops, some acidic fruitiness, and great malt scents.This bitter had the most delicate and delicious taste of floral hops with a mellow malt backbone. There also was the presence of spicy hops and soft, but subtle roasty malt sweetness as well. The drinkability of this brew is incredible. An exceptional example of a cask-conditioned bitter."
"Other comments: A quite ""American""-tasting Bitter. I can't pinpoint exactly what makes it American (though the Challenger hops probably take a lot of the credit), but it just reminds me of the typical pale ale you might find at a NW brewpub or something. Not that that's a bad thing!"
"Poured to a very lovely caramelly golden color with a nice and thick eggshell colored headfull of creamy frothiness and some big bubbles. Nice head retention there too. Nicely scented, but I was not sure what I was catching there 'till I read the label and it mentioned that the malts have a hint of scented geranium, that is it, verrrry cool. The feel is nice in this one, carbination is not very pronounced, but still there. Good body to it, not heavy, but not too thin at all, very nicely drinkable. When I first saw the name I thought that this may be a blueberry flavored brew, but nope. TThis is just a nicely hopped brew. There is a good peppery, grapefrut rind flavor going on. Very easy drinker."
"Taste is softly bitter, with a delicate and smooth malt balance. Very tasty, and excellent for style. A truly classic English bitter that is very well constructed. I think this was what the Hobbits were drinking on cask, in Lord of The Rings."
"on draft at Copperfields in NYC, this one poured light amber with a mild hoppy nose, low carbonation, bubbles slowly rising to the top, slim white head, leaving light lacing. Well balanced, light and very drinkable bitter in the fine English tradition. Fine sessioner"
"What a pity I only have one bottle of this!"
"This brew is a very hazy orange color, with a small white head topping it off. Pleasant citrus hop scent, some sweet candy malt as well. The taste is all english bitter. Subdued caramel malt and bitter hop, excellent nice tasting light english brew. Pretty wet finish. This is the kind of beer you want when youre planing on putting a few down."
"Pours a clear golden color with some copper highlights. Fluffy and soapy off-white head. Nice lacing as the pint goes down. Resinous, flowery hop aroma overrides a more subtle caramelly malt tone, light fruitiness, too. Hop bitterness immediately hits the tongue, followed by minerally wateriness, and tied together with a bit of malt sweetness, and grapefruit-like dryness in the finish. Wickedly drinkable. The best bitter from across the pond I've had to date."
"This beer has a hazy golden amber color. The head was small did not last but came right back with a quick swirl. There was a small amount of lacing. The smell was mainly of malts with a little hops in the backround. It has a malt flavor with a hoppy aftertaste that is somewhat bitter. This light to medium bodied beer would make a good session brew."
"cheers!"
"You takes your chances when you buy a beer in a clear bottle imported from England as far as I am concerned. Luckily in this case there was no real cause for worry. The beer is a dark amber color with a compact white head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is lightly floral and musty hops. Medium-bodied with tart hops and fruit flavors. Some malt and grain asserts itself later, making this beer not really that bitter after all. The finish is lingering hops with a strange mineral water character. Overall not as bad as I was expecting, but not a beer I would seek out again any time soon."
"Well-packed yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle did not decant on careful pouring. Bright and lively, the challenger hops muted but still forceful enough to carry the malt with some light, floral/herbal notes. Malt bordered on bready with a light caramel roasted flavor. If I just had a pub to go with this beer."
"Drinkability: For a bitter all I can say is yum. The bitterness and hop spiciness combines with a decent malt body to make this a nice session brew."
"This very pretty beer pours a nice golden orange color. The head is thin, but looks creamy. Doesn't leave much of a lacing on the sides of the glass. As the beer hits the bottom of the glass, your nose is assaultedf by a wonderful florally hop aroma. The taste begins as slightly bitter, but before it can really bite your tastebuds, a nice contrasting malt background slides in to soften the taste. There are definite floral notes in the background. This is a very tasty beer, yet the taste is not as strong as the aroma seems to promise. The moutfeel is very creamy, with a small amount of carbonation. If you were to line up a bunch of cask beers and a bunch of bottled beers, I would probably peg this as one of the casks. The mouthfeel is very reminiscent of cask. Drinkability is extrememly high as it goes down very well. A great session ale."
"I expected more, got less but not disappointed."
"This bottle conditioned beer pours a golden colour into the glas. It doesn't have much of a head. The taste is nice and mellow, with some nice bitter aftertaste. It also tastes alot of hops and it has also a little metallic taste. But it disappears after the first sip. The smell is balanced between the malt and the hops. This is a beer i like, would like to taste it on tap one day."
"Wyll-"
"Yummy! Nothing like a pint of bitter. Poured out a dirty light copper color with a decent enough head on it. Best before 12-13-03, uh oh. But not to worry, it did make it just fine. Smell consisted of a good dose of malts in there, but it was mixed in with some hops and some tropical fruits. Taste was typical of a bitter. Matls hit the palate first then give away to some hops that seem to have a big bite to them. Quite nice. Body was nice and creamy too. Decent enough bitter. Seek it out."
"The beer pours a cloudy golden color with a super-foamy white head that takes a while to subside. The aroma is decent. It has a complex mix of pale and crystal malts, hops, and fruity yeast scent. The taste is fine. It is a mildly malty brew with a lot of bitter hop flavor. This taste doesn't settle that well with me. It finishes dry and with a stale hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel stinks. It is a low/medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation, despite the overflowing head; go figure. This beer is overrated. The side says it's an award winner. The field must have consisted of small and obscure breweries."
"A very light beer, it pours a golden amber, with surprisingly little head, and consequently no lace. THe smell bears traces of florals and a small hint of chocolate, or something maybe from a stout or porter, and i want to say i smell a hint of blueberry too. The taste is a bit lackluster, although it is pleasant certainly. There is really no hop presence here, and the malts do not show through that much. Theres just a kind of bitter taste, and the mouthfeel is watery, although carbonated on the back of the tongue. Its a hard beer to describe. I could see drinking this beer on a warm summer eve, since its so light."
"On-tap at Half Time, this golden amber brew poured crystal clear with virtually no head, suggesting little, if any, effervescence. The aroma was muted, just a little hops, and the taste was not all that distinct. Furthermore, this bluebird was not even very bitter, frankly. The ultra-thin mouthfeel only served to make the ale seem like little more than hop-flavored water. A step up from the American macro-swill, certainly, but not much to write about."
"($3.99 / 16.9 oz / 50cl fat brown bottle w/ long neck)"
"The taste is pleasant, with lightly fruited malts and a touch of lemon and cherry. This beer improves as it warms. Overall, light and fruity, pleasantly flavorful and easy to drink. No complaints here."
"Due to its low abv, the beer is very easy to drink and I can definatly imagine myself buying this again."
"The aroma is a terrific mix of spicy hops and caramel malt. Biscuit-like, sweet doughiness and caramel are present in the foretaste. Yeast and hops mingle through the mid-taste. Solid and moderately bitter hop finish. Light mouthfeel with excessive carbonation and a little carbonic bite. I could easily see myself drinking a lot of these."
"Appearance: Golden amber hue with a nice sized bubbly cream head, leaves behind evenly rung scattered lacing. Aroma: Very pine cone oriented hop profile with a flowery buttery caramel specialty malts good mix with the hops taking the forefront of the nose. Taste: Very English malt backbone at the base of the flavor with an awesome balance of hops there to blend, label says English Challenger hops to me they have an earthy pine cone tone to the flavor packing a good bit of hops. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied smooth carbonation nice and easy feeling on the palate. Drinkability: I would love to try this on cask very clean balance of English malts and hops, a true classic true to CAMRA tradition English bitter."
"The beer splits from the bottle a slightly hazed copper color, the head smallish in size, bubbly in texture and the color an off white, the lace a velum like sheet to obscure the glass. The aroma of malt dominates the nose, quite fresh and crisp; maybe just a whiff of hops, start is somewhat sweet, nice malt profile and the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has a friendly acidity, the hops delectable in their spiciness, bone-dry aftertaste that languishes on the palate, quite quaffable, and a great beer after a trying day at work."
"One of the best ordinary bitters I've had the pleasure of sitting down with. Extraordinarily refreshing, with a sharp hoppy crispness, and just enough malt to keep things moving. Light bodied, great after a hard day's work. I had to order another, because 16oz just isn't enough."
"The taste is terrific; a very light bodied but very tasty English Mild Ale. Wonderfully well balanced, nice rich malts balanced with a very flavorful hop/floral taste. The bottle says that they use only Challenger hops, and Ill have to take their word for it. Nice taste, light bodied session beer. Excellent."
"I had three of these in a row at Redbones, so I do think it's pretty drinkable. Anyway, light amber when poured, no head. I thought it had a subdued light grainy aroma. Taste is well rounded, slightly malty, slightly hoppy. It's crisp finish was nice. Good session beer, definitely."
"Bluebird Bitter is supremely drinkable due to its rather restrained flavor, low ABV and light-medium body. I also imagine that it would go very well with a wide range of foods. All in all, this is a good, solid, drinkable English bitter."
"Overall- not a bad little beer. I wouldn't pass this one up."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy which is strange for a bitter. Medium bodied and very light carbonation. This could be a session beer if you can get by the mouthfeel. Interesting, but not overtly hoppy."
"A pale amber/light honey color with a low fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is very light, but sort of fresh and flowery. Flavor is just as the name says, but not a hoppy bitter and not like a typical English style bitter. It's more like a tingly, tart, and nearly sour bitter that grabs at your tongue and makes you take notice. The flavor is not very complex, and there is no hop or malt profile to speak of. Interesting to sip, but not to have more than one."
"This bottle conditioned Bitter pours a nice amber/dull copper with a bubbly white head that fades to a thin rim. The aroma is an equal balance of fruity, citrusy hops and malt. The lightly sweet biscuity malt melds with fruit flavors and a tea-like bitterness. A mild taste of limes can be detected in the background. This mild bitter provides a nice, easy contrast from the big winter brews I've been enjoying lately. This brew will always be welcome in my fridge."
"This bitter poured a clear, dark amber color with thin white foam. The smell was mildly malty with a touch of citrusy hops. The taste was hoppy with some citrus and pine elements. The malt had a hint of caramel flavor, and there was a touch of oak. The mouthfeel was fairly dry with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a decent bitter though with hints of oxidation in the flavor."
"Tasty! This would be a honey on cask."
"Hoppy aroma, a bit aromatic. english hops for sure. Sticky. bready, hoppy, but thin, OK finish, hoppy. The nice hops that were in the nose, didn't really eventuate on the palate. Perhaps this might benefite from some cask conditioning, rather than in the bottle? i'll have to wait to find out i guess, until i get the opportunity to try it on cask."
"Drinkability  This one was kind of watery for my tastes and didnt deliver on the style. It would probably make a good session beer though and probably does better on tap, which is how wolfy tasted it."
"Mouthfeel was watery in a great way, for it really balanced the bitterness and called me back for more. Makes it highly drinkable, which is the point of a good bitter. Went perfectly with bleu cheese. Wont say no if its on tap, which is better than the bottle version."
"I fear that I just don't know how to really enjoy and rate the English bitters. To me this brew is just too mild and creamy as to rate high taste marks as I see from others. Though clearly a very refined beer with great appearance, the flavor seems too subdued and lacquery to be great. Am I missing something here? Is the subtlety the charm of this beer? Perhaps, but I like my beer to make itself known to me in its robust and full flavor, not in its creamy, understated sophistication."
"A refreshing, tasty, mild and subtle ale."
"Had a bottle of this at the Viking. Poured a light copper color with a modest white head. Aromas of bready malt and floral hops dominate. Tasted of fresh bread and honeyish floral hops, with a bit of caramel lingering in the background. None of these taste sensations is the least bit overwhelming. This is a beer you can consume repeatedly, with its modest amount of alcohol and easy drinkability. Had never heard of this before and was quite pleased by it."
"I'd have no problem drinking this one all night long. It is super clean and goes down like silk. It pours a light tawny. The aromas are of fresh baked shortbread and malt with a pleasant outlying hoppiness. The flavors are more of the same. Hops dancing lightly on the tongue, some malted milk flavors, gentle (like a bluebird) hop bitter, and that familiar bisquit/shortbread thing adding character. This is a tasty summer choice, yet pricey 3.49/bottle. I will buy it again though no question."
"The above applies to a fresh keg. As the keg gets older, a metallic tinge creeps in which affects the drinkability. I'm lucky enough to live where two pubs (Man of Kent, Mahar's) have this on tap regularly."
"I really enjoy the way this ale takes me through a complex ride of aroma and tastes from start to finish, but giving me the nice nutty malt flavor to tie it all together. And it's only getting better as it warms to its proper temperature. A very fine English Bitter."
"A light copper ale topped by a nice white foamy head, which leaves an impressive lace in it's wake. Nose is a light fruit, a bit flowery, brings to mind images of a dewy spring meadow. Mouthfeel is light and smooth, taste is mild with a nice compliment of hops. An ale to savour, that's for sure. The price tag is a little hefty, but well worth every cent. I'll be saving my pennies up for another one."
"It pours with a decent head. Looks dark, but with a slight musky color. I smell some floral aromas but it tastes a bit metallic. Fairly pleasant mouthfeel, but a little bland. The metallic flavors stick around, making the beer a little less drinkable."
"Color is a clear amber/copper with a small white head thats about a pencil width high and leaves some gluey/ sticky small lace. Smell is faint of sweet malt and floral hop, very clean and soft. Taste is caramel and butterscotch-like in the front thats sweet and smooth then goes right into a leveling bitterness thats very floral and tangy and slightly earthy. The feel is a rounded medium body with a bittering tang cling and sweetness thats all very mild and drys nice and smooth, nothing to overwhelming. A very good pale bitter which is exactly what this seemed to me, it's pale, but bitter, and in a good tasty, smooth manner."
"Pours clear amber, with a small white head, lightly clinging lace. Aroma is hoppy, grassy, citrusy. Flavor starts with a little maltiness, caramel mostly, in the middle the hops come through, although not too strongly. In the end, it gets metallic, and the metallic flavor lingers on, rather unpleasantly."
"I had heard alot bout this award winner finally got a chance to try it.Really liked the gold straw color,smell caramel almost powdered sugar smell very appetizing.Taste was nice and balanced with nice malty sweetness with a little butterscoth tinge,but the Challenger hops are prevelantVery drinkable and light in alcohol,real good sessions beer.I love to find good English ales like this."
"Thick, ivory white well retained head sits atop a light copper hued brew with good clarity. Resembles a widget nitrogenated brew in appearance. Fruity and floral combination of pearish esters and pungent, almost wilted Chamomile like Challenger hops. Light butterscotch diacetyl and caramel malt sweetness as well. Very distinctive and pleasant aromawise. Buttery combination of diacetyl and light caramel upfront in flavor, followed by earthy tones of hop and hints of tannin. Lightly bittered, but well attenuated, so residual sweetness is appropriately balanced. Moderately bodied and somewhat dextrinous in mouthfeel for a session brew. Low carbonation helps facilitate easy quaffing. Finishes with a lingering impression of bread and butter. As expected, a nearly ideal session brew. Flavorful, soft and quaffable provided you don't find diacetyl objectionable."
"The sample I tasted was packaged in a squat, long necked 25 oz. bottle. the label had a great deal of info concerning types of hops and malts used. The beer had a good head that lasted nicely. The bitterness was quite clean and upfront on the palate. I could not discern any aroma hopping. It was also consistent and right where I like it for this style. The beer was light in color with a great beer aroma. Beers of this type can come off poorly in the bottle. This was not the case with this product. All in all, a very clean tasting and enjoyable bitter."
"The definition of a session beer. To sit and have some pub grub with a few of these is a pleasure. The sharp, crisp taste of pale malts and English hops goes well with food. On draft it poured a pale clear gold with a dense white head that held well. Restrained fruit with some biscuit and grain gave the impression of a lager due to it's clean, balanced flavor. I've gotten away from session beers at times because with other possibilities on tap they sometimes seem boring, but this one went down quite nicely."
"Very tasty. Could become a new session favorite with the low alcohol content."
"Nice wet cream head. Over nice copper body. Very nice creamy mouth feel, feels and looks almost like it was cask but I do not think it was. Nice clean crisp English hops with some light apple flavor."
"Beautiful gold with a hint of red in color, and the head shrank to a good 1/4"" rocky base. It had a lively fruity hop aroma and medium carbonation. Slight phenolic edginess. The best part of this beer, though, was the taste. It was malty up front, and had a toasty, dry finish with bitter hops all along the way. Very good beer. Very easy, enjoyable drinking."
"This beer poured a reddish gold color and formed an amazing sudsy white head.  The lace was an incredible airy cloudlike style.  Heavy amount of carbonation.  The aroma was of fruit and floral/perfume hops.  The flavor was of hops and fruit.  Rather light finish.  Not a bad beer, but the flavor and finish could be better"
"Bottle conditioned. Light amber color. Aroma suggests light toasted grains, some fruit (maybe apricot) and mildly floral hop. As with most in this style consume at about 55° F. The flavors intensify as it warms especially its moderate hops. Classic English bitter."
"A decent bitter."
"Notes: Eclectic with a raw flare to it, being that it is bottle-conditioned what else would you expect? At $3.99 a bottle it was pushing the expensive side a little but if you enjoy a “real ale” than it is worth every cent."
"Yeast layer stuck to the bottom of the bottle. On the pale-ish side of amber, medium to big bubbled 3/4 inch head. Slightly yeasty and skunked aroma. Light bodied mouthfeel. Malt is non-assertive and quite neutral. Hops are moderately sharp but hard to classify as to taste. Drinkable and refreshing but a little thin and hard to describe. A bit of lime infusion is apparent. The pale malts don't add a lot of interest. A little on the dull side to me. The expiration was rubbed off the bottle so maybe age dulled delicate flavors, the bottle was kind of dusty.."
"I have no idea how fresh this bottle was. The best before date was very faint and hardly ledgible. Light amber/gold, airy head disappated quickly but did leave decent lacing. It had that wonderful english smoothness and drinkability. I bet a fresh bottle of this would be outstanding.   I'm going to try this again in the near future from a different store.  Top rating for drinkability comes from the fact that it was pretty darn good despite my doubts about the age."
"This is a good English bitter. Light biscuit malt flavor with an up front citrus hop flavor and aroma with a mild bitterness."
