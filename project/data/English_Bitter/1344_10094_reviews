"10/23....pours medium amber with a 1/2 inch white head of fluffy foam. Modest musty malt nose. Taste opens soft with a fast bitter wave that fades out. Tasty flavor profile. Nice beer. Does what an ESB expects to."

"Overall â€“ Nothing out of this world, but nothing wrong with it either. A nice easy sipping pub brew."
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy amber with long lasting, fluffy, white head and much lacing. Aroma is of piney and citrusy hops, caramel and bready malt, yeast and some fruity esters. Body is medium and tangy. Herbal hops, caramel malt, bread crust and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and bitter. Very nice session brew."

"Blides has a hazy, dark amber appearance with a very small head, half a finger at most. However, there is good retention on that small head as you drink. There's toffee and caramel on the nose with some roasted malts, but not much going on aroma-wise. Big roasty malts with some chocolate and more toffee flavours in the ale itself. There's a little bit of piney hops, but not a lot. I'm even noticing some oakyness rounding it off at the end. The flavor profile is nicely balanced...not very complex, but fairly smooth and easy to drink. It's an enjoyable ale, but nothing more."

"O - This was a lot better than I was expecting, easily quaffable, with a good balance of flavors. Nothing extraordinary, but just good."
"My first Cricket Hill try.Pours into a standard pint glass a clear auburn color with a thin wispy white head atop.Some caramel toffee and butteriness mainly in the nose,no hop presence really to be had.Has a pretty nice feel to it with low carbonation.Flavors are somewhat fruity with a toffe malt base but not overly sweet,a smattering of earthy/leafy hops in the finish.This beer might be better served to be a little lighter in alcohol at 5.5% it's not a real sociable ale but it doesn't have enough ""stuff"" going on to grab over a more well hopped beer of the same size to be honest."

"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Small head with low retention. Little to no lacing. Hazy, dull copper body. Aroma is mainly rich in caramel malt and brown sugar. Taste is mildy bitter, caramel sweet, slight molasses and slightly spicy on the tongue. Good tasting beer, however not sure if it is supposed to taste like this, really wish there was a bottle date to check for freshness or some description on the label."

"Looks good. Taste is nice, but seems thicker than I would expect and a bit more ""pale ale"" than bitter. Still, it works, for the most part. I wouldn't hold it up against any productions from the other side of the pond, but it's a nice drinker."
"Overall nothing to go out of your way in finding but a pretty sweet cast ale found at your local six pack shop."

"O: The color seems to be a bit darker compared to other beers in the style. The aroma could be a bit stronger, but it is quite easy to drink."
"O: This is a good example of the style, especially from the taste perspective - the bitterness is just the right amount and the proper flavor. This beer is enjoyable and I could likely have more than one, though I do not know that I would call it sessionable."

"This beer is an orange-amber colored liquid, completely clear, with a slim white head. The aroma is faint...a little biscuity, bready malt, and just whiff of earthy hops. The taste, however, is more aggressive. Brilliant balance...cracker and bread-like malt flavor, backed very nicely with a solid malt bitterness. There is a touch of fruit...orange peel and apricot. The beer is a little more carbonated that I'd like, especially given the name 'cask ale'. Still, it's got a medium-body and is very easy to drink. Nice session brew."

"The flavors and aromas of beer (and food) trigger emotions and memories for me, just like music. Colonel Blides Cask Ale is one that does not disappoint. When brewing my own, one style I continually attempted to perfect was an English Cask Conditioned Ale. From time to time, I stumbled across a brewery that was offering a hand pumped ale, and always ordered it. This beer looks great. It's smell is awesome - it triggered that ""ahhhh"" in my brain that said ""yea, this is good"". It tastes very much like it should. A few too many bubbles, but when I let it warm slightly from the fridge temp, there were less bubbles and it became real. If you enjoy the style, this is definitely worth a try."
"I have had Colonel Blides many times in bottle form and once on tap at the brewery; it is definitely, one of my favorite beers by Cricket Hill. It did taste slightly off in the growler but still tasted good. The flavors seemed a little weaker, not as in your face. Anyway, it is definitely worth a try regardless if you can get a hold of it."
"o: Overall I think this is one of the better brews I've had from a NJ brewery. Even though my experience at the Cricket Hill brewery was far from spectacular I still think a lot of their beers are solid."
"Have had several beer from this brewery and this one sounded like it would be pretty tasty. The pour was pretty standard for me with a some decent head on it and an amber colored body. The beer wasn't much more than a regular English Bitter. The flavor is on the dry and malty side. Not much hop aromas of taste coming from this one. For me this beer was just average and not much more. Just another English Bitter."
"started to pour this one into the glass, it became quickly obvious that it was going to be a voracious pour, so I quickly slowed it down, but even still, it took two times to get the full bottle into the glass. A huge head, almost immeasurable in size formed on the top and quickly spilled over down the sides of the glass. Very vigorous and lively pour here. The color was bright amber yellow, somewhat hazy and cloudy, but very light and bright. There was tons of carbonation visible throughout the entire glass, which really kept up throughout the entire session. Nice light yeast and fruity characters coming out right away. Some light smells of peaches, bananas, light cereal grains, and grasses were all picked up right away. Very bright aroma, here for sure. Really a nice tight profile and seemed to be very nice. A touch spicy in the back end I was starting to pick up, and some muted hop aromas, though nothing terribly extreme here. Lots of light cereal grains, light fruit, bananas, peach, a hint of lemon perhaps, all mingling in together and giving it a very light flavor. Hints of grass coming through now along with a slightly muted hop profile are really starting to make this one pop now. The finish was crisp, clean and quick, straight to the point. A nice sharp cutoff of light grassy hops gave way to a lingering flavor of light grain. Super light bodied and very highly carbonated would be the best way to describe this one. The feel was extremely light, classic for a blond ale, and much lighter then even a pale ale would be. Huge carbonation profile really helped it go down effortlessly, with a smooth clean and crisp finish."
"Cloudy orange beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is dominated by hops.Taste is hops and light frutiness.This does not go down very well it takes a hard swallow to get it all down.Overall a pretty unsavory beer that was not the least bit enjoyable.I would not recommend and you can bet this is my last one ever."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid sessionable beer worth drinking for a long time."
"This was a decent beer, good balanced flavor and very easy to drink. Would make a great session beer."
"would have this beer again"
"D - This is a fantastic beer! Cricket hill is a self pronounced ""Gateway"" brewery into the craft world, so I wasn't expecting much from this offering, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way they hit this style right on. Yeah, it is a bit deceiving calling is a Cask Ale and using Co2 carbonation, but the nice creamy body makes up for it. I will look for more offerings from Cricket Hill."
"Colonel Blide looks nice, nice in that a nice bright white sudsy head stays on top throughout the ride. Sticking is minimal but it's there if you look for it. For a English Bitter this is much darker than other versions. Id say a bright brown with gold within sets the mood. Smell is quite sweet but not cloyingly so. I get a bunch of apple, slight pear with caramel in small spirts. A nice earthy hop background keeps it together. I never experienced a bitter with such a fruity component and Im liking it. The usual bitter characteristics are there including pale malt(muted), bready morning food, and a touch of grain. The fruit is a added bonus and apple and pear are up there with some others following. The feel is spactacular and smooth with a minimal bite of carbonation, that's barely noticable. A medium bodied bitter with uummmpppphhh. I really liked this and I had another. Very easy to drink but not that easy to find, I never saw this anywhere in the philly area, or even heard of it. Thanks Scoats for bringing this one to my attention."
"Had a glass at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. While this was a tasty ale, I was disappointed that a beer with ""cask"" in the name was poured with CO2. Still, it was a subtle and well-balanced beer. Up front there were toasted mildly nutty barley, which were then backed by floral, herbal citrus hops that I couldn't quite place as either American of British. Still I think this beer would fit in just fine at an English pub, the body was, light, drinkable, and true to style. I really enjoyed and hope I can find a case around here."
"Pours a really nice reddish auburn color with a massive off white head that leaves nice lacing. Has a slight haze to it. Really pretty. Aroma is very creamy and has a orange sorbet undertone. Also has a bready rye component. The taste is very smooth and fruity. Dry esters of fruit come through with a bitterness that give this beer a nice bite. This is one of my favorite cricket hill beers next to their jersey summer ale. Really nice feel with great carbonation and a nice clean finish. Drinkability is great. Really solid session able beer. Got to try this one again."
"Good drink cold on a hot day. Will keep an eye out for it in my visits to specialty stores."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Cricket Hill's (hands down) best beer, *Disclaimer* never had it by the bottle."
"First sip, hit with a slight burst of hops. Not expected, but good. The hoppiness evens out, but remains on my tongue. A malty finish on the end. A good, drinkable beer. Nothing extraordinary, but good. Would enjoy this with a burger or other types of pub food."
"Overall: An OK brew"
"Pours copper with small tight head. Aroma toasty, bready. Flavor is toasty, maybe a little biscuity, with a little hop whiff and a mild bitterness. A little banana ester disrupts an otherwise good beer. The mouthfeel is satisfyingly creamy. This beer isn't deep, but it is highly drinkable."
"I was dubious of this, being labeled a cask ale in a bottle, but pleasantly surprised. While I wouldn't consider it a cask ale by any stretch, it is a fine offering."
"D- a very drinkable beer, a nice eng. bitter, i wish i'd got more than one of them"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a light clear copper with a moderate white head, no lacing. The aroma is bready, faint. The beer is very balanced, bready, slightly bitter grapefruit. The beer is medium/light in body, well carbonated, and easy to drink. A solid ESB but nothting stands out."
"This beer had two things going for it, the appearance and the price. Colonel Blide's had a solid appearance with nothing all that much going on it either the aroma or taste. It's a good thing that this beer is pricey or moderately priced. If it was either of them, I would be kicking myself right now. As of right now, you can more than likely pick up a bottle for less than $2 but more than $1.50."
"Boy, I keep finding beers from jwc215 in the back of my fridge, even when I think I've drunk them all. I think this was the last one, though. And not a bad way to finish up. This one pours a nice copper color with 3/4"" inch fluffy white head. Smells of malt, and tastes of malt, caramel, and a hint of sweetness. I was thinking this was a blonde, not an ESB, but I like it either way. Not really bitter, but a damn tasty beer. Carbonation is just right, and while I don't remember what the ABV is, I wasn't feeling too tipsy. A nice beer, very drinkable."
"I like bitter ESB's and this one ain't half bad."
"Not so much as a bad beer in general, but a miss as an ESB."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a pale and light crystal malt scent along with a moderate hop bitterness and some light yeast esters. The taste is decent. It has a grapefruit bitterness to it along with mostly pale malts and a touch of caramel. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit too much CO2. This is an average ESB. It not a bit fan of hop choice (Chinook?). Also, the malt bill doesn't compliment it well either."
"D: Pretty tasty would be a great hopped up brew to session with."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Tastes like orange juice beer over and over, again and again. No real hop or malt character at all."
"Many bars in New Jersey have put this beer on their draught lines under their house name, like Cloverleaf Tavern. Unfortunately, they call it a wide range of styles, from Alt to Red, none of which is accurate."
"Pours fairly light amber. Good head and solid lacing. Smells of a little malt, fruit, weak. Nothing about this beer impressed me until I sipped it. Excellently balanced taste. Cricket Hill continues to impress me for a small local brewery. Lots of citrus notes there, some lemon and grapefruit topped with a hop punch akin to that of an IPA. I would actually almost consider this an IPA. Finishes hoppy/bitter. Smooth palate with a light, ticklish carbonation. Unlike other tasters, I didn't find this beer to be bland at all -- very complex and shocking. Very surprising brew, thumbs up."
" I have no idea what the alcoholic content of this is, but this would make a decent session beer. I only found this being sold by the bottle, which is fine for those nights like this when it's too cold outside for a given time of the year. Aficionados of Cricket Hill will love the hint of their hops in the aftertaste, and the next time I get over to Fairfield, I'll have to see if they have this on tap there. Something tells me it just didn't translate into the bottle..."
"Pours a nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, bitter, with some citrus. The taste is malty, bitter, slight citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"D: All in all not a bad drink, would venture so far to say it was 6-pack worthy. Good ease of consumption (2-3) with a moderately decent enjoyability factor."
"If you get the chance to stop in, it's certainly worth a try..."
"A good medium mouthfeel with lightish carbonation, it finishes with more fruit, a slight bitterness and some earthy tones. This is pretty tasty and quite drinkable and seems to grow on me the more I sip. Give it a shot if you find it."
"Says ""cask ale"" on the bottle. A bit confused about that, as it is bottled. Anyway, it has a nice enough citric balance, but has an amateur homebrew-ish yeastiness to it that gives it almost an unfinished touch."
"Theis beer pours a nice, dark amber body. It is so thick that they pour half, let it settle, then pour the rest. The head is a nice, thick, frothy head that holds throughout the beer. The smell was slightly malty, nothing really too noticeable. The taste was similar. Their was slight maltiness there, but otherwise it was pretty bland. There was really nothing to ""balance"" out. The mouthfeel was fantastic, however. Nice, soldi and thick. Overall, not too drinkable. The mouthfeel is nice and makes the beer inviting, but I was hoping for a little bit more of a taste to it."
"Cheers!"
"Last swigs: A fine brew for the style. Nothing that I would seek out again. Forgetable, not regretable. On tap at the Gre Lodge 05/20/05."
"This is a very nice brew. This brew is a dark orange colour with a nice khaki head of foam. This cask was served via Sankey, but it was still quite nice. The aromas were of fresh, bitter hops, biscuity malts, and citrus fruits. The taste was fresh and floral with nice citrusy hops in the mix as well as fresh butter malts. The mouthfeel was cask conditioned and awesome and the drinkability was very good as well. Nice stuff, this."
"An absolutely silky creamy smooth brew. Oh, do I love cask brews. The body was pretty full, and the flavor was right there. Floral hops to bitter a bit balanced with a nice sweet maltiness. Little hints of citrus here and there. Although my two glasses appeared very different, the flavoring was not really different. The first one with sediment was a bit more earthy, but it really did not stray away from the other too much. This is a must try beer. If you are from Jersey, you have to realize the meaning of a cask ale brewed here."
