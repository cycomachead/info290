"IT's a little slick and dry at the same time, though it evens out and goes to a cleaner semi-dry in a light but almost medium body.  It goes into a quick finish."
""
"Not really an ale, it's more like an India pale lager. Has a really hoppy lager taste to it"

"Drink- Not again. I appreciate the wife's effort to give me a can of a namesake beer but man this was bad."

"Overall, this incarnation of Foster's is pretty bad. The brew pours a bright golden hue and is capped with a short-lived fizzy head. Both the smell and flavor are astringent, grainy, alcoholic and fairly strong on metallic flavors. The feel is about on-par for an AAL, but this is supposed to be a bitter, so I'd expect a bit more tooth. I would not want another one of these."
"Keep it cold and drink it on a summer day. Better than many of lager options at the same price point."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice white one-finger fizzy/foamy head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is sweet, malty, with some grain notes. The taste is sweet, kinda malty, grainy/ricy. Medium Body, with a not bad bitter finish. Not a bad brew, alot better than most American macros."
"D: I think you get what you pay for and most Aussies I know, avoid this one. Don't bother."
"First taste and aroma have a rotgut, alcohol-enhanced edge, and -- owing to the added color --the mouthfeel doesn't jibe with the appearance, so the whole thing just ends up feeling like a budget get-me-drunk-quick quaff. Heaven knows we've all been there, but I think we can all aspire to our better selves."
"D: Very drinkable but tiring after a few."
"Out of a big green oil can this beer was a perfectly clear amber color with good rising carbonation. The head was off-white, two-fingers, displayed average retention and the lacing quite good in broken fishnets. The aroma was semi-sweet, macro-malt and corn mash/grains. The flavors were more bitter than the aroma but ended a little more sweet with pale malt. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation medium/high."
"Drinkability scores low for me, since I physically had a hard time pouring and drinking this beer. I'm sure I lost a couple ounces while pouring over the sink. And as stated above, there's little to like about it. The aftertaste was actually okay enough for me to get through the whole thing. I will be avoiding this one from now on. If I wanted a cheap and easy to find bitter, I'd get a Goose Island Honkers Ale. For those with no other choices for a bitter, this is may be worth a try."
"D - drinkability is low."
"Just average. Pair it with some hot dogs on a warm day. Nothing special, but it is an option in a style I like. I'd pass for some others out there."
"The taste is smooth, basic, but good ""beer"" taste, a little like a cross between an English ale and an American macro lager, light caramelly , faintly toasty, grain, hint of leafiness and grassiness. It has a solid grain aftertaste. Simple, mild, it has light sweetness and mild bitterness, but both are constant. It is a little watery. It's pleasant and rather drinkable, but nothing great."
"D: Drinkability was pretty damn bad. Sour malting. nothing I would consider every again even on a dare."
"D: Drinkable, but aftertaste began to wear on me."
"D- Easy to drink like what beer should."
"I've always had a soft spot for beers that come in an ""oil can", and Fosters is well known for this. I've had the Special Bitter a couple times in the past so I picked one up the other day for old times sake. Pours a dark copper color with a pencil thin head and average lacing. The aroma is slightly better than your average american macro-lager due to the bitter hops. Very thin mouthfeel followed by a rather simple disappointing flavor. The bitter hops give this beer a decent finish but there is no other flavor to this beer. Not a mistake to have one of these once in a while, but don't get too excited about it."
""
"D - The aftertaste really kills what would otherwise be a decent brew."
"This one is beer, big, and fairly good to drink with some friends. It's a good ""Foster's"" twist on the classic English bitter."
"My vigorous pour created a finger's worth of eggshell-white head with good retention. The color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose was faintly bitter. The mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a light bitterness on the tongue. The finish was also mildly bitter, but nothing particularly special. Definitely NOT their lager, but not all that compelling, either. For the cost, it was definitely a bargain."
"It may not really be Australian (mine was brewed in the US), but it's inexpensive, effective, and did a good job washing down a filet mignon dinner. Just don't chill the hell out of it."
"Clifsnotes: Not bitter, just boring and OK."
"D - I'm a little bit on the fence about this beer its not a bad beer but it just doesn't live up to the other beers I've had from the same style"
"D - I wouldn't mind having a few of these over an evening. Not as bad as macro or light lager, perhaps in the upper ranks of the low end."
"Tastes like very light fruit esters up front, moving quickly into spicy, lightly bitter euro hops. These give way to a more bitter hop node and then some adjuncty tasting grain the back. Not bad at all."
"Very drinkable, and with only 3.5 ABV this huge ass can equals a normal session beer. The English don't really like all that alcohol to get in the way of their malts, and I love them for that."
"I liked this beer, so much better than the Foster's Lager. Will consider purchasing again."
"Overall the Special Bitter wasn't really bad. In fact, I kind of liked it; it's quite drinkable if one might be looking for something to have over a prolonged period of time. I feel that it has more flavor than some of the stuff from Miller or AB and still relatively cheap."
"The taste is rather average. A mild malt profile and wisps of hops are all you get. A very mild bitter if you can call it that. Slightly more flavor than the typical macro. A light body and low carbonation leaves a surprising creamy mouthfeel. It is an easy drinking beer and a very low alcohol content but the lack of real bitter flavor hurts the possibility of going out and drinking this beer again when there are better alternatives."
"Notes: It was decent. I'd consider it if my options were limited."
"overall i dont like this beer at all, too much metalic flavor, and with a can this size usually the last bit is more palatable than the initial but not so, nothing that i will buy again"
"Drinkability: This beer seemed like a Fosters with more character. I will choose this over a Fosters in the future. This is a good beer for making an Australian Shandy on a hot day."
"Drinkability: I guess you could make this some kind of a session ale, but I wouldn't do that. That is, unless you like your beer with the word bitter written all over it and not having the beer itself bitter at all."
"Comment: Overall there is little to recommend this brew other than to say ""its not bad."" Not good; not bad, just completely average."
" This one is not too bad for $2.00 I supose and at 3.5% ABV you could drink these all day, if you cared to."
"Is it offensive? No. Is this what I look for in a Bitter? No. It looks the part but other than the extremely mild alcohol content there's no reason to make a session out of it."
"Foster's Special Bitter pours a reddish orange with a thick white head from a 25.4 ounce oil can. Union Made in Canada is in the small print. The aroma is nicely malty, but then a strong whiff of adjunct rears it's head. There is a mild fruity taste that isn't bad, but it's one dimensional and just sort of ho hum. Probably a tad better than their lager. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: It's very tolerable. Yes, I'd say that's a pretty good analysis."
"I would take it over those, or over most of the Belgian ales I've tried, but not over much else. If you can find it really cheap, it wouldn't be bad to get drunk with."
"Overall, as in the style of an English Bitter, this ale is close but comes up a little short but not much. It's better than a Labatt Canadien Ale, Molson Export or any other Macro offering. If you want an English bitter get yourself a fuller's ESB. But as a swilling lawnmower beer this beer excels! It really isn't a bad beer (like any beer is bad...well maybe light beer is) But it is refreshing, quaffs easily and is not at all offensive. That being said I can get the same qualities from my Genny Cream only because its cheaper !!"
"Worth a try, but only buy one... I have another one to generously give to a guest someday."
"D: From the appearance, I thought this would be a hidden treasure, but was let down in the flavor department. Although the blandness facilities drinking more, I'd opt for a more flavorful bitter. Oh well, it was worth a shot."
"Color is a dark amber, more orange than yellow, with a nice thick head. Aroma is typical of a lager. Flavor is malty and a bit thin, has a fair amount of bitterness; I detected a metallic hint but this may be due to the serving type - perhaps it tastes better on-tap or from a bottle. Finish is smooth but not impressive. Still, it's OK. Maybe I should try this from a bottle or on-tap; perhaps I will have a better impression."
"Definitely not a true Bitter, but it's ok as a lawnmower beer. A notch above the average macro."
"Big 750 mL oil can produces a gold/bronze beer that is lightly carbonated, topped with two inches of head, and smells of faint husky grain. On the palate there are notes of caramel/toasted malts and a touch of grassy hops, backed by a medium body that leaves a light finish. Not great, but the low ABV definitely makes this one a quaffer."
"Picked up a can of this at my local beer shop in Bridgetown, OH. It is a big 'ole can that is for sure! For 1.99 you really cant beat the price and volume. however, this is nothing special. Not much of a taste to talk about. Looks like its older brother, Foster's Lager but without the zing I remember from that beer. all in all, a decent product for the price."
"Leftover from backpacking trip (cheap, lighter packaging than a bottle, easy to pack out, and ideal surface area to volume ratio). The appearence is golden brown and crystal clear. Smells like a macro lager and bitter hybrid. Tastes watered down and chalked full of adjuncts. Mildly fruity. Not an English bitter. These taste so much better out on the trail after hiking 5-10 miles with a 40 lb. pack. This beer is good for what it is."
"D - It is pretty good. It had much more flavor than Foster's Lager."
"Looks OK, tastes blah, probably as good as, if not better than, a lot of macros, but just a mediocre beer at best."
"25.4oz can from Florian's in Auburn. Translucent amber body with a couple of inches of initial light tan head that dissipates surprisingly slowly and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smell is weak, but has elements of malt and hop. Tastes sweet overall, sugary with slight hints of molasses. Initially simple tasting, but is a tad more complex than initially noticeable. Rather light-bodied, but heavier than expected. Not great but not bad either; I'm sure it's better than their other offering widely available in the states. It's growing on me the more of it I drink."
"Drinabbility- It's very drinkable as a lager. As an English bitter, it's not real impressive. Worth trying, but I don't see it winning a lot of awards."
"I've had this beer many, many times and never reviewed it. I always knew I'd never reviewed it, and I guess because of that the question was always floating around in the back of my head as to why. So I saw it tonight for $1.99 and decided to give it a proper tasting and review. It poured a nice, clear amber body and frothy off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. The nose was lightly fruity (when it's cold it's almost undistinguishable from a lager), and it had a sulphury, and perhaps even metallic edge to it. Standard mouthfeel. The flavor is pretty basic ""pale ale"". Lightly caramelish malt, mildly yeasty fruit, and grassy/leafy hops. Not sure where the metallic edge is coming from. Standard bitterness. Finishes dry with some residual, dull hops. Average. Australian for just slightly better than regular Foster's."
"Medium amber color with a fair head. Smells like a simple beer, grainy mainly. Tatse was nothing special, bitter grain and hop flavors mostly, but not overly bitter by any stretch of the imagination. There was a bit of a canned corn taste, but it was really mild in the aftertaste, not in an overpowering or unpleasant way. Mouthfeel was a light medium, good carbonation. Overall, very drinkable, fairly enjoyable. Better than the standard Fosters, in my opinion."
"Though I've had this beer many times, this is the first time I've ever actually seen it. I usually just swill it out of its awesomely sized can and feel like a badass. It is actually a lovely reddish-copper color. It has a big foamy white head that dies fast but does leave some lacing. The nose is a forcefully sweet malt and earthy and spicy hops. Taste is a big bitter flavor on top of a weaker but distictively sweet malt body. I haven't had enough English Bitters to say how it measures up but it blows other beers in its price range out of the water and I've been a fan of this brew for a while."
"Drank difficultly, this doesn't tastelike the aussie version, this is easily one of the worst beers I've since I been a member of BA, try this if you can find it from some where other than the canadian plant, my first drain pour"
"Foster's Special Bitter was amber in color and very clear. The head was thick, white and a little rocky with decent retention and left a some spotty lacing. The aroma was light, a little malty and fruity. The taste was decent, slightly bitter with a little metallic twang. The mouthfeel was good, light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. It's easy enough to finish the big ass can, but one is plenty and I'm ready for something else."
"Pours a nice amber color with a large tanhead,nothing great,but not too bad. The smell is very weak with only a small amount of malt and corn. The taste was actually better than I expected,a nice blend of sweet malt and hop bitterness makes this drinkable. A decent beer for a macro."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Decent with food. This beer was certainly much better than I was expecting. Not a great beer, but better than most macros."
"Medium in body with a smooth, slick mouthfeel and a rather low alcohol content make it easy to drink, but nothing exciting. As for it's style, I'd opt for something else."
"I bought this because a) it was $2 for a 25 oz can at the grocery store, and b) I'd never heard of it. As much as this beer lacks character overall, and stylistic accuracy in particular, its flavor is at least not miserable, but the aroma is just that. It has that metallic, canned, generally foul smell that, come to think of it, is what makes Foster's Lager one of my least favorite beers of all time."
"This is not a good example of an English Bitter, and not even a good beer. Perhaps it would be better in bottle, but unfortunately that's not available. Not worth purchasing again."
"Pours out to a pumpkin orange color with a small head of white foam. Medium low level of carbonation, minor traces of lacing in the glass. Aromas of malts and sour grain with some toasted notes of earthy herbs. Taste is medium bodied; medium roasted malts, dry grain, some fruit estery notes, and a tea like finish. Not bad, but very nominal. Mouthfeel was unexciting, similar to iced tea. Drinkability is north of average due to the lower ABV. I'd have this if there were nothing else, otherwise, I don't see myself revisiting this very often."
"Not bad at all, pours a copper gold with a decent foamy head, rather weak in the nose, ajduncts plus some hop and grain come about. Inexplicably though the taste is not bad, bitter-like light and refreshing, goes down smoothly and its aftertaste is not bad at all. Easily the best cheap bitter I've had and tastes ok although you can tell it is being made with cheaper ingrediants than craft versions of the style. Still though, decent stuff."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer. Great balance. Though it may not be a great example to it's style, i believe it holds up quite nice. I would gladly get this again."
"Not a bad beer, bit also not something I'd go out of my way to find. A shade above the average American beer."
"overall, at least i satisfied my curiosity. a very mediocre(at best) bitter ale. as a cheap beer goes (little more than 2 bucks an oil can) i give this an A+. however, once you get used to decent bitters you simply can't ignore the metallic and astringent quality of this brew. you get what you pay for."
"This'll do in a pinch. Nowhere near being an overachiever in the style but it's respectable of Foster's to take a crack at the style."
"With a can this size I have to give Foster's credit for packaging. Definitely one of the most imposing cans on the market. Beside that I must say that overall this is a sub par example of an English Bitter. The recipe is something like one, but the execution must be flawed. Where the smell should be of soft malt, there is a musty odor. And the flavor has metallic offness as well. Honestly, at the end of checking out this brew I'm a bit grossed out."
"Pours a clear iced tea color with a frothy cream colored head. Smells like the malt used in regular fosters but with flowery hop kiss. Some graininess and corn maybe as well. Tastes corny and grainy with a slight hop kick. Metallic presence. Mouthfeel was far too thin and a little too bubbly. This is in no way a good bitter, but it's quite drinkable and unoffensive for a macro. Miles ahead of the regular Foster's, but that's not saying much."
"This is a drinkable beer, but not something that I find particularly appealing."
"Not a good beer in my opinion. Won't seek out again."
"Cheers!"
"This is not a great or even good beer but it is convenient when you can't be bothered with a bottle or don't have a lot of cash."
"Poured from a big 25.4 oz can. Had pretty good head that slowly dissapated. Light carbonation. It had a hoppy smell and good coppery color. Overall it had a decent middle of the road taste with good mouthfeel. Not a great beer but worth a drink every once in awhile. Slighly better than regular Foster's."
" I think this one might be useful in weening a pure american macro lager drinker towards better stuff."
"Overall, not bad for the price. Worth a try, better than Foster's lager."
"This beer poured a nice amber color, with 3 fingers of tan head. As the head died down, it left some nice lacing, which was a pleasant surprise. It smelled a bit grainy, with some sweet notes from hops present as well. The taste has some hop bitterness present, but is offset with just enough malt to balance it quite well. The mouthfeel is good, not too carbonated, and not watery either. This is a very drinkable beer, with the low ABV and good taste.. the worst thing about it is trying to pour from the can, thanks to the opening being so far from the rim of the can."
"Pours dark amber with good clarity. A massive three finger head is bubbly and light tan, slowly falling into some sticky lacing. The toasted grain and noble hop aroma hides some sweet esters and a hint of skunk, but no off-aromas. The taste is a bitter but mild hop bite first, then sweet caramel that leaves a slight residual sweetness in the aftertaste but finishes clean. Good balancing, even carbonation and light body will crisp the mouthfeel enough to fight off a hesistant diacetyl character. A little on the estery side, but much better than Foster's original for the same price."
"Way better than a Foster's Lager, and a good beer, esp. in the ""value"" category."
"Pours golden yellow, with a good white head and decent effervescence. Aroma is light and almost non-existant, otherwise similar to any american lager (maybe a little maltier). Mouthfeel is smooth but a little grainy. Flavor is actually pretty good, with a dry, grainy-powdery taste that seems more at home in a wheat beer than a lager. Finishes pretty dry and bitter. Not TOO bad overall."
"Not the best bitter in the world - by far - but better than Foster's Lager or the regular Foster's. The aroma really ruined this one for me. Every time I went to take a sip it hit before the liquid did. I'll probably try and stay away from this one."
"A nice smooth beer. I believe I will enjoy this more than the traditional Fosters lager."
"Foster's Special Bitter isn't special and it isn't all that bitter. As I've pointed out numerous times, however, it's a much better beer than its better known brother in blue, Foster's Lager. I don't believe my judgment has been clouded by the fact that this beer has exceeded my expectations by a country mile (and the 3.5% ABV assures that I've kept my wits about me), but it isn't a bad choice at all. Especially if cans are the only practical or legal option."
"poured a decent amber color with mega white head. Smell is slightly fruity and toasty almost like a dark lager. Taste is also a bit fruity with no hops detected. Mouthfeel is pleasant and refreshing. This is a good session beer, but nothing outstanding."
"Decent taste aside, this truly is one odd brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thin at first, changing to a smooth, more effervescent quality. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, therefore drinkability is outstanding. This comes highly recommended for the floating beer cooler in the pool, when you don't want bottles around. Pleasantly surprised ."
"that's almost as bad as them putting Bitter in the name but no hops."
"Foster's Special Bitter looked great coming out of the can, especially for a light lager. Unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to its appearance. That is not, however, to say that this isn't one of the better light lagers - it is - it's just not that good."
"Light mouthfeel makes this one go down easy, but the smell hurts the drinkability."
"The taste... well, for a beer with ""Bitter"" in the name, it's not. Not at all. I get a taste of weak, watery medium malts, followed by some grains. Only a hint of hops."
"Surprised to see this in a divey little package store in the Massachusetts hinterlands. Not quite the bitters that I remember i Australia. Now I find out it is a light lager, but the can says it is an ale. I poured a little bit into a glass, but mostly drank out of the can (Hey, I was grilling!). The beer was a pale goldish yellow in color with slight carbonation. There was not much to the aroma, smelled like the aluminum can if anything. The flavor was very light. Mostly grainy, with a slight bit of caramel. Hops came into play just slightly. Mouthfeel was very light and crisp. Very satisfying after working outside all day. Very smooth to drink, not as bitter as some other Aussie bitters I had when I visited."
"Drinkability: That slight chalkiness on the finish wasnt really that bad, but it just made you want to drink more. This isnt a great beer, but I was surprisingly impressed with this. Much more character than the regular old Fosters, but still light and easy-drinking. I had just come in from a run not long before cracking open this beer, so that probably helped its drinkability. A BIG improvement over the regular Foster's, I'd take this over most American macros... not like that means a whole lot."
"Has an amber color, a lot of carbonation and a fairly impressive white head. Smells like cooked grain and a hint of caramel. Taste sweet and a slighty buttery. Minerals and a slight hoppiness come in play. The carbonation tingles a tad bit. A very drinkalbe beer thought but a bit confusing. This beer is suppost to be 2.8% ABV, a light lager, but at the same time a special bitter? Doesn't the can say ale? Either way this beer is not to shaby."
"just one GENUINE character would make this drinkable. real hop flavor, or real malt flavor. as it stands, this ""bitter"" (imagine the air quotes) has neither."
"Really, hard to tell much difference between this and domestic macro swill like Keystone. Won't be back for another taste, mate."
"Not nearly as sweet as its better-known lager cousin, this is a fairly good English mild style. Enjoying a rather wide distribution, it makes a very good BA ""go-to"" beer when better options are unavailable. Don't dismiss this out of hand; it can be a good sessionable beer when stuck in areas without a big selection."
"Tastes like an American lager, albeit with more flavor. The hop is present, but the brew is still thin and without interest. The aftertaste is short and largely hoppy. It is bitter, but little beyond that."
"Sampled from one of those wacky, huge ""oil cans."" Poured a bit on the amber side, with a tight, fizzy head. Firm bittering, with some husky, slightly grainy malt flavors at the end. Much less refined than a good English bitter, but passable."
"poured out reddish in color. started witha greeat off white head but settled after a few mintutes to a film that left OK amounts of lacing. Aroma was of granulated sugary malts and a slight tinge of hoppyness. not really anything special. taste was a tid bit thin. adjucnt flavor of corn, faint malitness and a biting carbonation. mouthfeel was thin and not overly exciting. drinkibility is good though, not really harsh or overpowering. glad i tried it but i doubt ill shell out the cash to do it again."
"Special Bitter is an average brew overall, but for a macro I found it pretty enjoyable. Definently a better brew than standard Foster's Lager. Appearance is medium amber with an average head that slowly dissipates. Smell is rather weak, but from what I got it seemed slightly skunked and typically adjunctish. Taste is enjoyable, but average. Sip starts slightly bitter, and finishes with a decent malt taste. Pretty straightfoward and not complex, but not a bad beer. I'll probably not rush out to get this again, but I could do a lot worse."
"Drinkability was good due to the mildness of this beer. Although I don't think it lives to its name, I would still drink another few."
"Pours to a frothy white head that leaves globs of foam. Smells a bit like Foster's Lager. Taste is similar to Foster's lager, yeasty, bready but sweeter and without the alcohol bite. Finishes clean with a nasty cheap beer aftertaste that just makes the whole experience unpleasant."
"Pours a dark straw color with a moderate rocky head. The aroma is extremely faint, but displays a distant vegetable smell. Also, theres a far-away earthiness and hop aroma. The taste is a moderate malty sweetness, with graininess and cooked veggies. Slightly sulfurous. Clean and smooth, with a soft mouthfeel. This beer is very ordinary and everyday, but also very easy to drink."
"Not bitter. The nose is almost nauseating. The head is absent. The color is orange/red. I'm not sure about the goals of Fosters in making this, but I'm guessing they make this for macro drinkers and it is quite bad. I couldn't finish it. In fact, I drank a Hopdevil to get the taste out of my mouth."
"This one pours out to an amber in the glass with a massive head. The aroma is that of cereal grains and bread. The taste is actually pretty decent, with some malt character present. It is somewhat refreshing and crisp. It reminded me alot of Bass Ale."
"I was quite surprised by this beer. It tastes way better than I anticipated and is real easy to drink. One of the best light lagers I'd had or risked trying. This brew would now be my ""desert island beer"". I can enjoy the brew, reseal the cans (trust me, I'd find a way), and using some bamboo, be able to make a sturdy raft with all those massive oil cans. As for the beer, no complaints here, mate."
"Final Thoughts: I think I'll have to agree with some others, I don't see how this is only 2.8% ABV. Overall, I think I like the original better. This probably is not popular (at least not in my area) because it says its Bitter. (Whoa bitter beer face!) People should not be so intimidated by this beer, it really has no bite."
"It is drinkable, can says 5% not 2.8%"
"I think this would be pretty good on tap, but I've never seen it offered that way. If it's really 2.8 ABV thats practically non alcoholic. Better than I expected."
"Drinkability  I think Ill finish this one off without help from my sink. Nicely done."
"I would recommend this over the ""blue"" Foster's, but this probably won't find its way into my regular fridge rotation. It was pretty interesting to see what the green can was like after seeing it in stores for quite some time but never giving it a try. Altogether, a drinkable but somewhat boring beer."
"Overall impression - First off, you gotta love the giant can, it's cool, it just is. Second, 2.8% abv doesn't seem correct, after one I could ""feel it"" and I have a pretty high tolerance, gotta be closer to 4 or 5% in this. Third, is it truly an ale?, BA has it listed as a pale lager; the can has the word ALE stamped on it, who is correct?, who knows. With a macro brewery, the brewing process is so ""engineered", I am sure they can achieve the flavor profile they want regardless of the type of yeast (ale or lager). To me, the fruitiness leads me to believe Fosters that it is in fact an ale, and ESB?, no, a nice little easy drinking ale?, sure. A better choice then the lager."
"Drinkability, sure, but how many oilcans can a man plan to can? At 2.8% abv, probably a few more, but consider my suggestion of opening one at a time and splitting to enjoy at the colder temps."
"Drinkability/notes: Sampled in the 25.4-ounce can, brewed in Canada by FBG under license. Not a great beer, but certainly OK. Seems a decent choice as a lawnmower beer or with pizza."
" I am struggling to find an aroma, just some faint spicy hops. It's a very well balanced beer to drink though, even though it's bland. Bland makes it average, balance makes it drinkable. That's about all there is to say. Some sweet malts come through first and the most prominent of the bland flavors is the spicy hop finish. I don't see anything wrong with picking up a few of these huge cans just for something different and not offensive."
"This is poor poor beer. Flavor is very dull and lacking anything interesting. Bready with just a bit of grassy hops. Bitter my ass. This is truly worthless. Don't even bother."
"Foster's Austrailian for beer well maybe not, but one thing is for sure from what America recieves the special bitter is much better than than Foster's lager. It appears with a copper tone and an off white tannish cream head foam very nice. With a perfect ring of lace completely even with a very nice head retention. Very nice mild bite of hops paired with a the caramel like sweet malt tones. A bit light in flavor but this beer overall works for the balance of the delicate hop bouquet sweet malt profile. Mouthfeel is very light in body no consistency like water for the style, although it's decently carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but I wouldn't waste much time on this sorry attempt at a bitter."
"This is a better offering then the lagered blue label by Fosters. This has a nice dark green label and when poured it gets a fairly sizeable off-white head with lots of retention and the color is a lightish brown/orange, kinda pale looking. Smell is faint of malty sweetness and a bit of citrusy fruit hop. Taste is well rounded for a bitter, very smooth and semi-sweet with a nice drying bitterness but is dull and not as bright and toothy as other ESB types. Feel is a very sturdy medium body with a good sweet, semi-bittering hold and finish. Not bad, its a tad lighter in the bite for a bitter, but is smooth enough to suck em down easy."
"overall an average drink..though i dare say if i were trapped in a hell with this or Bud I would go for this."
"Thanks dudey."
"Despite the ""bitter"" on the can, it wasn't. Very similat to regular Foster's except a little darker and maltier. Of the two, I like this better. Taste is sweet and somewhat smooth, but with significant graininess. Not bad, not good. The big cans are cool."
"Fosters Bitter: In an oil can. Hmm, very nice looking, rich amber color, which is absolutely clear. The head is a very tall, very rocky and pure white. The aroma is a little grainy, and (no other way to describe it) macro like. Ugh. Flat, lazy malts seem to lay there, and are barely disturbed by the beat cop hops, who wish they were somewhere else. Flatulent carbonation is noticeable throughout. Skid row."
"Farewell, Foster's Bitter, we shall never meet again..."
"I poured this 25.4 ounce ""oil can"" of beer into my large weizen glass (32 oz.) and was greeted by a beautiful copper colored beer with a magnificent head that very slowly faded to a light, rocky foam. Thick veins of lace were left at the top of the glass, with moderate lacing appearing while drinking the beer. The aroma was very pleasant, with caramel malt and fruit notes, with a bit of hop spice. As I suck some of this ale through the foam, the taste mimics the aroma, with a clean, sweet caramel maltiness followed by a stronger bitterness. The finish is rather clean, with a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin perhaps, but not at all watery. The drinkability seems to be excellent, as I could have a couple of these, even at 25 ounces a pop. If this were a fuller bodied beer, it would be top notch. As it is, I could consider this as a regular beer. It's inexpensive, attractive, and enjoyable. For an everyday beer, what more could you want? If you like ESB, pick this up. Won't be the best you've had, but it will surely please, especially considering the price. I'll be sure to pick up some more soon."
"This is one of my favorite Monday Night Football beers, where one oilcan per half works out just about right."
"Pours a deep amber colour topped by an average head which leaves very poor lace as you drink it. Aroma consists of citrus and malt. Taste is malty and bitter finish. Good carbonation but still it's another average Foster's Beer"
"I keep some of these in my fridge. nice and refreshing good thirst quenching quality!"
"Pours with a nice fluffy head over bold golden liquid. Nose is weak and sweet, filled with adjuncts and little if any malt and hops. Taste is sweet, with flavors of corn and very light hopping. Finishes weak and bland with a slight cidery flavor. Much better is availiable out there."
"This was definitely better than I was expecting, although it was not very special or bitter. Brownish orange with a very thick foamy head that dissipated quicker than I expected. Light hops aroma. Flavor was really not bitter in any way, it was rather mellow with a malt presence. A little tinny and thin which I WAS expecting. Dry, lightly fruity finish. Overall I think if they tweaked this one a little it would be worth another try but as it stands it is kind of mundane."
"""Gusler", Australian for ""Strange""!"
"Nice amber brew with head made up of bid and small bubbles, has a bitter, but not floral, smell. The taste of alcohol teamed up with the grain so that that come together in one weak punch. It has a little bit of a malty finish. The flavors and sweetness reminded me of cheap cognac in a way. Hmmmmm. Not a terrible beer, though."
"All in all Fosters Special Bitter looks much better than it tastes, it is a bitter Beer, even a tasty bitter Beer, just not a Special Bitter Beer."
"Is this really an ale?"
"Oilcan poured with a dense white head that soon diminished.  Color was deep golden to very light brown.  My wife liked this, I knew I wouldn't find this to be a GREAT beer.  The smell was straight bitter hop with a hint of malt. The beer's taste does not stand out.  The hop bitterness is not flowery nor citrusy, just enough of bitterness to remove the malt sweetness.  At least you can tell that it isn't packed full of adjuncts.  This is better than the average bear (beer) but nothing I'd go looking for."
"An ""oil can""...clear, darker gold, biggish head that's spidery and cavernous but mostly gone in a minute.  A little hop in the smell.  Hops are not aggressive in the taste but are important in that the malts are very subdued and only sweet in impact.  Pretty flavorless but with no overtly  bad tastes.  The aroma pairs with the flavor to give a weird, cheap sense to the swallow and aftertaste.  Pretty standard, better than the Lager (out of the can, at least)."
"I did not even know this beer existed.  It was appealing, given my choices.  I was surprised.  I liked the copper color and creamy head.  It did not have much of a bitterness taste, rather flowerly, more like a watered down pale ale.  It was enjoyable, smooth and very drinkable.  Some body was evident that let me know this was an ale."
"The thick, white head tops a light copper hued brew and settles quickly.  Diacetyl butterscotch dominates the aroma, and a light Kent Goldings hop nose is there as well.  Mild, yet pleasant in overall aroma.  The hop bitterness and malt sweetness is well balanced, but body and mouthfeel is a bit thin and a touch watery. Considering it's an ESB, more fruitiness and malt complexity would've been appreciated.  Regardless, the overall balance and lack of flaws make this a drinkable brew.  I was craving a Fullers ESB while drinking this one, however."
"clear copper color.  big rocky head that doesn't go away.  very faint grain and malt aroma.  pretty light bodied but very smooth and creamy.  easy drinking and poses no challenge to the taste buds."
"Big ass 25.4 oz can with no freshness date, brewed in Canada  damn and I thought I was drinking an Aussie product. Pretty good bubbly rocky head that slowly dissipates with a sunset orange hue. Mild fruity and grainy aroma with vague hints of caramel and mineral. Smooth with a moderate carbonation. Slight metallic and buttery flavours run amuck upfront, hop bitterness is no help in the matter and seems to be accentuated from the metallic flavours. Along comes a mildly buttery malt and late fruitiness that seems to barely tame the astringencies but at least draws the brew closer to balance and leads into a bit more malt character. Semi-dry after taste with more mineral and grain flavours. Not a beer I would go back to."
"Crystal cear peach colored with a pinkish head.  Lots of carbonation.  Malt bitterness in the nose.  malty smooth taste with a slight bitter finish.  Also a slight metalic taste (oxidation)....?"
"this beer is extremely bland and boring, i don't know why everyone has rated it so highly, coz it is really really bad, maybe someone else brews it in North America?"
"Grainey scent.  Good balance of barley malt and hops.  IMHO, this is a superior brew to the Foster's Lager.  Nothing very fancy or original here, it's just a good tasting classic (even though a plain) beer.  Good amount of sediment in the glass.  Was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"Personally, I think that ""Foster's is Australian for crap"" but I found their Special Bitter to be most enjoyable and quite the session beer. Shame it only comes in oil cans here in the US, but I'd definitely purchase more of this beer."
