This beer has put me in the position of not wanting to try any more Wychwood products, save for maybe King Goblin, since I would hope it would be similar to Hobgoblin. Apart from Hobgoblin and Fiddler's Elbow, I've been very disappointed with this brewery as of late. This stuff is average at best, and you will want to pass.","TheHammer","Mar 30, 2014"

Not a lot of complexity unlike Scarecrow or Wychcraft . the beer is certainly very drinkable but I was hoping for a little more.

But Goliath was dwarfed in comparrison to Hobgoblin. I pourd it into my Hobgoblin glass, and the colour was a nice orange brown colour and very clear. The head was about one finger in size and lingered on for the most part of the beers consumption, but whithered away by the end of the beer. It tasted very light and watery, kind of bitter though near the end. All and all it did what it said on the bottle it ""slayed my thirst"" and it wasn't unpleasent, it seemed as if I could drink a bunch of these and not feet too lousy. On the other hand, i am not all that impressed, its not a bad beer but there is much better from Wychwood.","Zonthark","Oct 18, 2011"

Nose is bready, some earth notes and a hint of grass. Light hop notes and some sweetness, although something feels a bit off here (touch of skunkiness?). Taste has English malts, bread and a bit of bitterness, lightly earthy and some sweetness as per the nose. Medium light feel, slick carbonation and some residual hops and malt sweetness after each sip. A touch of butter also. Easy to drink, if not the most flavourful of beers.

4.1,19.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A crystal-clear copper body with brass highlights rests gently beneath a creamy half-inch of white foam that holds fairly well and leaves some thin lace. The nose delivers a nutty and delicately buttery malt with a delicate touch of yeasty sulphur and some mild, grassy and citrusy hops. It's medium-light body and fine, restrained carbonation leaves it lightly crisp on the tongue at first before warming to become softer and smooth in the swallow. Yeasty fruitiness (apple, pear, berries) appears clearly in the flavor, and combines with its buttery diacetyl and some citrusy/grassy/floral/earthy hops to lend a great deal of character to it's nutty, caramel kissed malt. A firm bitterness balances and lends an edge to the finish once the sweetness of the malt has had its time to shine. It finishes with some residual malt and a bit of earthy & leafy hops (or is coming from a combination with the slight residual sulphur?) that step aside to let the bitterness dry things out. An enjoyable session beer!","NeroFiddled","Dec 18, 2003"
1.97,-42.7,3.5,1.5,2,2,2,"Eh, this was a sucky beer. I was expecting something big and strong, like Goliath. It was skunky and hoppy, two things that don't mix. It looked ok, which was it's best quality. It was a light amber color with a white head that was thick, but then died out to a laceing. Other than the looks, it had not redeaming quality. I would pass on it, unless you are looking to up your reviews.","JISurfer","Nov 06, 2003"
3.77,9.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a decent head that laces the glass. The aroma smells of yeast and carapils malts. There is not much there, but what is there smells good. The taste is really plain; a little malt flavor and light English noble hops. This seems to be the trend from this brewery. The mouthfeel is alright, although they could use to drop the CO2 pressure while priming their beers. It's a light bodied beer and one that you can drink plenty of. It's too bad their bottled in these huge goofy bottles.","WesWes","Aug 03, 2003"
3.71,7.8,4.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Big impressive name and bottle.... small beer. Pretty good small beer tho. Clear, amber color, lazy trickles of carb witha persistant, clingy off white head that blaketed the beer to the end. Light, typical British aroma; yeasty fruit and earthy Goldings. Smooth and creamy up front, light, session beer body with pronounced hop flavor and dryness in the finish. Drink this one relatively warm to truly appreciate. Cold, this beer has little flavor.","Shiredave","Jun 15, 2003"
3.7,7.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Honey colored with a white creamy head. The smell was citrusy and malty with a grassy edge to it. The taste was alright - pleasantly drinkable, but nothing spectacular to set this beer apart from many other English ales I've had. The hops kick in around the middle of the flavor profile and trail off to a nice dry finish. Drinkable, but after one bottle it gets boring.","jlervine","Jun 01, 2003"
2,-41.9,2,2,2,2,2,"Not as sticky and syruppy as the Circle Master, which i just recently had. Bittersweet, resiny hops, slightly bready and oily. Gimmicky bottle (a large 660ml bottle), pretty broing, and hard to finish (due to boredom). Tastes like any other mass prodeced English Bitter.","rastaman","Oct 16, 2002"
3.85,11.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"An easy drinking ale to say the least, quick jabs of malt, hops and yeast by-products keep the palate in check. Iâ€™d definitely gauge this as a lunch time brew or something to have over a long session. Needless to say it is worth a try.","Jason","Aug 04, 2002"
2.5,-27.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This stuff came in a big clear 660 ml bottle, but I was surprised at the low alcohol content. Out of the bottle, it looks and smells like a dirty 40 oz. of cheap malt liquor, although it is slightly darker. Once poured, it smelled strongly of fruit, particularly pineapple. I'm really serious. Drinkable, but not very good at all.","IrishRedRock","Jun 18, 2002"
