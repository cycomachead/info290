"Decent beer, from one of my favorite breweries. Bottle was over a year out of date but i decided to go for it anyways, quite overly carbonated, which i attribute to the additional age put on this beer. Overall very good though."

"Poured at a perfect temperature with a huge long-lasting off-white head, lots of clingy lace and a hazy honey amber color. Aroma is malt hops grain. Flavor is complex with biscuit malt, A hint of Caramel, some fruit spice, plenty of hops, yeast and carbonic tang. Body is a little watery. A little boozy in the finish. Overall a very good beer"

"Poured from the bottle into an American pub glass. A dark reddish honey gold hue with ample beige head, with the latter retaining its shape impressively well. Nose is extremely bright and fruity, with brisk orange juice, green grape, grassy, and floral notes tingling the nostrils along with a more diffuse honey malty sweetness. Tastes like dilute orange juice or mixed citrus iced tea, green herbs, dry peppery spice, a little medicinal aspirin, a initial touch of canned peach that becomes more salient over the course of many sips, and a pleasant lightly toasted caramel malt backbone. I sorta get the English bitter comparisons but this is hopped with Amarillo, man ... Closely resembles many of the brews currently sold as American session IPAs in flavor profile. Noticeably watery body which others have also described and this certainly mutes the overall flavor impact to some extent. I did not find the beer to be overly fizzy and from this and the ABV standpoint does drink like an English ale. Tangy, medicinal, gently bitter finish. The Amarillo tastes great in here (albeit mellow) and overall I am down (or up) for another. And another."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a hazy medium coppery amber with a massive half glass head that slowly dissipates leaving massive lacing. Foamed a bit out of the bottle. Pleasant aroma of bready malt, citrus and grassy hops, light orange. Flavor is orange citrus and citrus hops, mild caramel malt, earthy mint family herbs, finishes with grassy hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A grassy, somewhat subdued IPA, but well flavored for the ABV. This does lean in profile to classic English IPA style, but North American Northwest hops are also evident. Nice variation on an IPA and tasty for a session ale."

"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Bitter, but I tasted more interested beers from De Molen."

"This beer through me off a bit. It is pretty darn good but at times really seemed to border between ESB and English IPA if that’s possible. I seem to detect more of the malt presence, especially in the nose than many other reviewers."

"A likable beer which is made for the afternoon."

"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a deep orangey yellow. There are a ton of floral hop notes (and a hint of orange marmalade) in the nose. So it's not surprising to encounter a very big hop presence on the palate. It's not at all unbalanced and in fact the fine carbonation helps make this very drinkable."
"Meh, I had no issues drinking it whatsoever, in fact it went down quickly so that says something. With all the selection here in Alberta you could spend your money on something better"
"A decent enough IPA, old-world style, with a whiff of those new-fangled hops, so all is well here. Nothing overbearing, nothing underwhelming, just a nice, drinkable, somewhat hoppy ale."

"overall: If you're out on a hot day, this is the one you want to drink. It's light, easygoing, but lovely balanced in flavor. It's just has that little zip of flavor that most other beers in regular bars don't deliver. I actually love this one :)"
"The ultimate perfumy flavor, aroma, and peppery dryness remind me a lot of highly hopped Belgian ales. Oddly compelling, the grass, herb, and flowery character come together in a rather pleasant rendition of pale ale that defies style."

"330ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Deep golden color, hazy appearance. White, rocky, small bubbled, froth. Not so wide crown. Good retention. Earthy & spicy aromas, citric notes. Gentle clean bitterness, citric fruit touch. Smooth palate, oily texture. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Hints of honey in the middle with citric zest hues. Pleasant session beer. Close to English bitter Style."
"O: Not your typical English IPA, but well made, interesting and drinkable."
"It's a very simple and straight forward beer but what I really liked about it was it's crisp refreshing quality that I think I have been in the need for. Really hit the spot last night, good stuff."

"O: I love this beer. The Vuur and Vlaam is even more impressive, but this is less of a tasting beer, more like a afternoon pool party beer."
"Draught IPA from Holland, in St Paul. Well hazed orange colour with sticky lace. Soft bready malt, lemon zest and wet hay in the nose. Appetizing. Dry, pleasingly bitter with a mild, garden herb and citrus zest hop flavour. No complaints. Yeast character leans a bit toward the atypical strains of Belgium, but not as assertive. I like that. Good beer, no regrets."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of floral and bitter hops with light citrus notes. Taste is also dominated by quite strong floral and citrus notes with a semi-astringent finish. Dry caramel malt backbone can be felt though is not particularly dominant. Body is about average with good carbonation and no alcohol. Nothing earth shattering but easily drinkable and enjoyable."

"O - Average offering from De Molen, was expecting something much better."
"I love the label design on this one though, a De Molen-classic . Old school and clean, that’s how I like it!"
"Overall: A very nice session beer, very refreshing"
"By no means even remotely close to a IPA."
"Still an good brew in this style."
"O- An english IPA with some american hop flavours in the mix. Highly drinkable and refreshing; good as a summer beer"
"With a gentle pour it leaves a massive three finger bubbly,frothy head and yes the carbonation is very high and the colour is a hazy honey hue,the smell is floral fruity hops,boiled candy and bready malts,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of honey,boiled candy,candied pears and finished with a floral fruity hop bitterness and overall comes across to me as good english bitter rather than a great EIPA but in saying that very drinkable."
"I've had much better from De Molen. While this has good things going for it, it ends up a relatively insipid beer overall. Drinkable in its way, and it has its place in the extensive De Molen range, but it has a hard job to stand up on its own."
"D: A nice IPA, but I’m quite surprised that it’s an English IPA. The American hops (Amarillo and Cascade) are quite obvious. Nice though."
"Overall a very nice and unique IPA. I appreciate the low alcohol content which adds to the general drinkability. However, though I would readily drink another in the future, its features are such that one is plenty at any given sitting."
"Not bad, maybe more American than English in the IPA style."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is grassy hops, apples and grain. The flavor is a mix of apples and lemons, as well as some grassy, grain and wheat. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Pretty good overall."
"Overall a good beer just nice for a session beer at 4.5%, not much complexity reminds me a little bit of Amarillo beer from de Molen as well (they both use Amarillo hops)"
"D: Real easy to drink - light and flavorful. Good for a warm summer day."
