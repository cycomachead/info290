4.04,6.6,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"we dont get enough good english styles anymore, so this is rad. also, no surly still in colorado, so thanks to my man in omaha for sending this one my way! an esb grain base hopped like an american ipa, thats what this is to me, i get the maris otter malt and the crystal 60 range stuff, and i do get a cool english yeast profile thats less doughy and bready and more fresh baked, not so raw. amber ale seemingly in its base too, with some caramelized sugar going on. hops are enormous in nose and taste, pine family, more woody even than needles or sap, and for me, that screams centennial, although i am not sure what varietals are used here. i think its cool they collaborated with a band on this one, and i think its neat that they did so much with a traditional european style. surly is one of those breweries i go back and forth on, like, is it local hype or is it really all that good. this one pushes me back into the, yeah, fair enough, its awesome, side of the debate, but it wages on. wonderful carbonation and dry enough in the finish for nothing but the intense hops to linger. well made and clever brew, thanks again to my buddy in nebraska for sharing this one! low enough abv to romp on as well, i could drink eight of these without question.","StonedTrippin","Saturday at 07:10 PM"

The nose is dominated by straight pine, mildly earthy greens, and a touch of grapefruit rind.  The taste brings in more of the same, the pine underlined by a vein of resin that rounds things out rather nicely.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, a solid, straightforward hop farm of a beer.  I'm digging it.","TMoney2591","Mar 29, 2015"
