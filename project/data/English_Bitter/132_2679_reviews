"i really dig this brew here. a well americanized take on a classic english stye.. caramel in color but nice and clear, and having almost a full inch of soft white head. the nose smells like desserty english malt, while the yeast is a burton or something similar. whats unique about this is the flavor in the middle. it has an almost holiday spice cake character, where cinnamon seems obvious, but maybe some molasses and clove too. not over spiced,or even spice per se, but that complexion is there for sure, before its all cleaned up in the finish. loading this much flavor and character into a beer with such low alcohol is a feat, unforced and natural in this beer, and very impressive. clean finishing, plenty of body, and the kind of beer i could gladly have several of given that its both sessionable and different. well done here by rogue, i prefer this to the massive imperial version."

"O- Outstanding take on the style, the 4.8% ABV is well hidden and this would be a great session beer for an evening out with friends. There is a nice story that goes along with the name of this beer too."

"RIP Don."
"YSB is a decent bitter, but it has more bitterness than flavor."
"O: A pretty good bitter (but not the best of this style) from Rogue Ales. Nicely drinkable, killing growler wasn't a chore...glad to try it. I grabbed it thinking it was a special brown, but next time I'll stick with the Hazelnut Nectar. Cheeuhs"
"Excellent example of a British bitter, probably the best I've had from this side. Very full for a beer under 5%ABV, though the alcohol content still makes itself known. Well-balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness, exactly as it should be."
"Recomended. Another solid offering from Rogue. Maybe they're onto something with this Pacman Yeast."
"OVERALL: C- / C"
"O: Good beer. Drinks easily enough and still maintains its wonderful character throughout. Perfect to drink several pints of while laughing with friends. 4/5"
"Overall, I think this is pretty much on target for the style. Not the most exciting beer in the world, but it's not supposed to be."
"Overall this is a perfect beer, period. I wish I had this on draft in my house. It is extremely hard to make a beer of this ABV and style good, let alone packed with so much flavor. Will be drinking a lot more of this in the near future, especially in the warmer months."
"The CPJ"
"D - I could drink a lot of these, but it would probably fill you up pretty quick"
"If you order it at Rogue be sure to try a sample first."
"Deep brown body, no visible carbonation, 1 finger creamy off white head, significant lacing. Nose is malty goodness, caramel. Taste is malty but with a nice hop hit, floral and grassy, on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium, minimal effervescence. Drinkability is superlative, light, refreshing. You really need to have the cask version to appreciate this offering. Now I see why The Old Tavern Rat drinks this all the time (when he's not drinking Scotch). I was pleasantly surprised how good this was. Definitely worth a try."
"D-a well balanced ale that brings a nice malt body with a hint of sweet hops and a fair amount of bitterness. extremely low in alc and very easy to drink make this something I could enjoy on a warm summer day...too bad i'm snowed in, give me a RIS next!"
"Aroma of hops and some citrus.Poured with an average-sized, creamy, frothy white head. Diminished to about 1/2-finger size over time. Body is amber-colored and hazy. The flavor definitely has hops with a little sweetness that is the citrus. It goes down nice and smooth and a nice feel in the mouth."
"Also, as you pour more beer the yeast adds to make a cloudy body which is the reason for the change in appearance."
"MD- There is a lot of carbonation. This beer goes down real easy. Nothing jumps out it is just a solid Bitter."
"This seems like a very agreeable, sessionable English bitter, with a pinch of West Coast USA thrown in for good measure."
"Overall this was a very, very nice ale to sip on for dinner. I would have no issue with having this one again any day."
"another lovely beer from Rouge, well rounded and well made. this is one of the better bitters I've drank in recent memory and I hope you het the chance soon"
"D: My first Rogue beer, and a great one to start with, in my opinion. One of the better bitters I've had so far, and quite easy to drink."
"Rogue bomber, $6.99 at DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours typical darker almond amber, khaki head, that goes all tiny bubbly, and leaves a mess of fine fine lace and a nice shimmering and lightly frothy film. Orange peel, and lighly musty nose. Well hopped Biter, nice malty under coating, thoroughly tasty and enjoyable Rogue brew. Pac NW all the way, with the healthy hop attack shining through. Softly citric and quite appealing. Clearly quality, nicely done."
"Overal and nicely balanced brew, though it was a little underpowered for the steak I had with it."
"Overall this was one of the better Bitters I remember having, however it's worth noting that all of my favorites have had more hops than are standard for the style. Even without all the hops, the solid malt bill would make Rogue's take on the style worth a shot."
"D: A good hoppy example of a bitter, would repeat a tasting if I was in the mood for hops and not the strength of an IPA."
"Goes down smoothly, and is a nice, subtle change of pace from Rogue's usual flavour, hop and alcohol hammering."
"Drinkability: I definitely enjoyed drinking this beer. I enjoyed the moderate bitterness that wasn't trying to punch me in the face. I can definitely see myself enjoying this beer on a hot summer day while relaxing at a cookout or as a session beer. I will definitely be trying another one of these in the future."
"Overall a well balanced and delicious ale."
"Conclusion, A nice English bitter style of beer. More malty then it's American cousin. A bit off-balanced, but still very enjoyable."
"After cleaning up the initial disaster, this got poured into a mug. A cloudy amber color results, with some decent frothy head, which evaporates sporadically. What remains laces down the glass. Smell was of some caramel malts. Taste was bitter, obviously, with some floral sweetness. No real excessive carbonation.. potentially used it all up earlier. Leaves the mouth dry with a slightly sour aftertaste. A decent bitter overall."
"Decent attempt, well crafted, but Rogue got a tad carried away with the citrus hop for it to be a top-notch English bitter. If there was an American Bitter then this would score a lot higher."
"A nice example example of how Americans can make a decent english bitter. The alcohol content is not listed but it feels smooth and easy to drink, which are qualities that you won't see in typical American beers that use a lot of hops or specific hops."
"Notes: A slightly off-balance bitter, if only because it seems like it's just an exaggerated recipe. It's both big on the fruity notes and big on the bitter. Tasty and sessionable."
"Had this as the Fat Head's Ale at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh on tap. Came in light brown body with minimal head that died and left no real lacings. A citric/leafy hop aroma would be the best way to characterize the smell. A little oily/buttery slickness in this thin-bodied beer, but the hops do come through in a herbal, tea-like punch and there is a moderately dry backbite. An easy to down beer that I recommend."
"Great carbonation, and not thick by any means... very easy to drink... and slightly mild in the Alc. dept. maybe 5.5% if you are lucky. Go get one or three!"
"Drinkability: A pretty fine example of a style that is rarely brewed on this side of the pond"
"Very enjoyable drinkable brew and one of the best rated active bitters."
"Side note goes well with the rogue house chili as well!"
"Pours clear amber with a minimal white head. Aroma is full of peppry hops, caramel malt, rosemary, and the normal Rogue yeast sweetness. Taste is spicy hops with some citrus anda sweet caramel malt backing. A bit bitter in the finish. Kind of thin. Not your normal bitter, but definitely another great beer from Rogue."
"Poured a copper red color, this head that didn't last very long, decent lacing down the glass, smelled floral and hoppy, tasted hoppy but pretty malty also, med bodied beer, not one of my favorites but its very drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good, I could drink this stuff like water."
"D - A well made American version of a classic English style. Well balanced and a beer i could drink a few of."
"Taste is euro bitter hops complex malts and slightly astringent. Mouthfeel is smooth with some leather. With a bit too much carbonation and some hops that don't belong, it misses the English Bitter style. That being said this is a terrific beer whatever it is. I have had other Northwest ESB's that are similar to Rogues, so call it a NW ESB. Very tasty indeed. It gets even more pleasant as the bubbles subside and it warms up. I am looking forward to having this on tap."
"Pours a clear, medium amber color with plentiful, dense, off-white head. Aromas are very toasty, biscuity, a touch of caramelish toffee, and just a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident. This malty beer still manages to finish relatively dry and bitter, perhaps a high sulfate water helps. No too bitter but nice."
"This is a very drinkable beer. A nice session brew."
"Nice session worthy bitter from Rogue, this stuff fits the bill quite nicely, decent balance, and after a 22 oz. bomber I`m craving another one still."
"D: This is a fantastic english-style bitter IMO. All the right flavours are there and it is not, thankfully, overly-hopped. Another winner from Rogue. I will definitely buy this one again. well worth the price."
"But if you do - order a pint of Younger's Special Bitter."
"D: This beer is decent. I wouldn't seek it out again. Like I've said about Rogue in other reviews, for me they're hit or miss."
"Golden in color with medium white head. Aroma of citrus and light caramel malt. Nice hop (citrus/grape) and sweet malt taste but not to complex. Medium body beer and a long bitter finish. Good beer very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a good-quality example of an English Bitter, not necessarily a great style, but a really decent beer for daily drinking. The price tag makes it a bit steep, though."
"This isn't an English Bitter, nor is it an ESB. It's closer to an American Pale Ale than anything else. But I guess the goal of this beer is an ""Imperial English Bitter", which is a bit of an oxymoron, but they somehow pull it off. It's a good beer, hence the score, and it's hard for me to penalize a good beer for being outside of the style boundaries (or in this case, making up a style). Enjoyable and recommended."
"D- 4.8% = quite sessionable. Definitely one of the best bitters I've had to date. This would be a knockout if it had some sediment in there."
"The beer poured with a murky orange with thick lacing on the side. Aromas are faint with minor hop hints and a chilled citrus smell. Taste has a bittersweet caramel flavoring to it with a somewhat citrus texture. Mouthfeel is pretty crisp and refreshing, making this a clean, dry beer. Overall, pretty darn good."
"taste is creamy, hop kick, caramel, some citrus, mellow malt back, pine, nice bitter finish."
"I'm giving this one some extra points for its bold flavors and pleasant smoothness."
"I have it on good report that the ABV is 6.5%. Anyway, I had the opportunity to try this on tap at the famous Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR. The beer is obviously brewed with the passion that best describes its namesake Bill Younger. The beer pours as you would expect from a bitter, but wow that first sip has has hops dancing and attacking your mouth. Luckily, the brewer balanced it out with a good dose of maltiness. A perfect beer for the Northwest tastes and climate. Just be careful the higher alcohol will sneek up on you!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while if your in the mood for a good session beer with some substance."
"Drinkability - I found this beer really really malty. It has a nice dry bitterness to it, but the caramel malts definitely headline in this one. Rogue is always solid, and this is a good offering."
"Drinkability- Just as I expected from Rogue. A great offering and perfect example of the style. I wish I could get this more in my region. I brought this back from Chicago, and it is definitely on the list to get again."
"D - I really dig this bitter...another solid session beaaah."
"Had this ontap at Fat Head's, but i've also had it before under the Rogue label. OVerall a damn fine brew and FH's should be proud to put their logo on this one!"
"D: Very easy to drink, had several, good balanced beer."
"Drinkability- Extremely drinkable and will be sought out again. I really wasn't expecting this great a beer from Rogue considering that Dead Guy doesn't do much for me and many of thier beers are a bit overhopped. But this was quite a pleasant suprise."
"Pours a clear, medium to dark amber color with plentiful, dense, off-white to tan head. Aromas are very toasty, biscuity, a touch of caramelish toffee, and just a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check with the 35 IBUs barely making a dent. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident. This malty beast still manages to finish relatively dry and bitter, perhaps a high sulfate water helps. Another solid offering from Rogue, very true to the British examples."
"What I love about this beer is that it doesn't taste like a typical Rogue and it revels in its English hop and malt profile. Dark goldish brown with a huge storm tossed head this beer has Brit hop nose all over it. The beer is complex yet easy drinking with yeasty flowery notes on the finish. Very true to the style."
"Carbonation is nice, not overdone and it really hits the spot. This is a fairly sessionable ale, and as with most Rogue brews, it is well done."
"Pours a beautifully clear copper with a nice frothy head and nice lacing with good carbonation. Smells lightly malty, not a huge hop profile. I guess the guys at Rogue are going for a true to style bitter. *Tear* for no big hops. Nice and lightly earthy/floral hops on the tongue. Good maltiness with biscuit-like qualities. A good nutty slight sweetness in the tail end. Hops subtly tingle throughtout. Finishes dry with a lingering aftertaste that leans toward the hops. This is what I expect a special bitter to be. Amazing."
"The aroma is caramel malts and with a hint of hoppiness toward the floral side. The taste is malty up front with a slight butterscotch flavor and then you taste the hops. In the mouth it leaves a nice bitterness and a tingle. Overall this is a solid English bitter which does its job as being extremely refreshing and good but leaves wanting to open up another to refill the pint."
"Drinkable, yes, a medium body without overpowering hop bitterness.Enough flavor though to reason why this makes a good house brew for our beer friends at Summits."
"This beer pours very nicely. It's got a light amber color and a thick, foamy head. The mild aroma seems to have an even mixture of malt, hops and yeast. The flavor is smooth and simple. I found this to be a very drinkable beer. It would be right at home in a London pub."
"D - Extremely easy to drink. Nice smooth ESB style with good balance of sweetness, maltiness and hops."
"D: Not bad, this beer is very plain and bitter, but it a very good plain and bitter."
"Nice warm reddish amber with very light carbonation, slight lacing clings to the glass. The nose is the best feature of this beer - a full toasty floral hoppy thing. It really is a fine homage to a classical English bitter, emphasis on the bitter, much drier and less citrusy/fruity than the American counterparts. Close my eyes and I could be down the pub. There was a slight metallic taste, but that seemed to dissipate as it warmed up from fridge temperature. It goes down very easily."
"Pours almost an orange color with a nice thick head that with moderate lace and retention. It has a great, fruity, clean aroma. It taste like a typical English bitter but with a bit of an American/ Rogue twist that I enjoy very much. The mouthfeel is awesome as well...clean, dry and a nice carbonated feeling. Overall, I am surprised I liked this beer as much as I did."
"An excellent bitter. I picked it up in the Fathead's Ale version, from Fatheads in Pittsburgh, in a 22 oz bottle. It poured out great, a wonderful coppery color with a great head, and it had some of the best lacing I've seen from a bottled beer in a long time. Very nice smell, a true bitter, with enough malt to help even it out a bit. Wondeful taste, a nice balance of malts and hops with a slightly bitter side and slightly bitter aftertaste, just like it should have. Goes down fine and would be easy to have a couple of these in one sitting."
"Excellent. This beer surprised me quite a bit. I thought this would be more like an ""imperial"" version of Brutal Bitter, but it's quite the opposite. I guess I should have done my research. Regardless, I'm glad I got to add this to my ever-growing Rogue collection."
"Poured a pleasant brownish-gold into a pint glass, with a good sized foamy off-white head. Aroma was mildly hoppy, more leafy or woodsy than citrusy. Flavour is restrained, but bitter enough to make it interesting and worth drinking a bomber of! Low-to-moderate carbonation (just the way I like it), and a pleasantly full mouthfeel (especially as it warms) just add to the drinkability. A very nice, low-key bitter from Rogue that I'd love to find on tap somewhere and have a few pints."
"Overall, an interesting brew. The taste was quite good for the style. I expected a bit more of a hop flavor, but I realize that this might have disturbed the delicate balance of the flavors."
"This is an enjoyable beer. I really enjoy a good bitter and this is a good one. Recommended...I would buy again."
"D- too high ABV% to session, simple and tasty, very drinkable, not the best in this style, but holds its own"
"(just fyi, I'd rate this beer on cask as at least a 4.5 - don't miss it if given the chance!)"
"Quite tasty. My preference runs to more hops, but since a bitter is supposed to be balanced, this was well done. Somewhat simple, but ideal for session drinking."
"As for drinkability, the beer was smooth, flavorful and easily sessionable. Furthermore, it made a perfect accompaniment to the Horse Brass's world famous fish and chips."
"Drinkability: The kind of easy drinking you'd expect from this type of beer, although, as is often the case, I would've preferred a bit less carbonation."
"D: Very well balanced beer, would get this again for sure"
"Bottle courtesy of Okbeer: Poured a medium brown color ale with a medium light brown head with better then average retention. Aroma of English hops is dominating with nice floral aspects. Taste is dominated by English hops and provides a lot of dryness. I thought the malt was a bit too discreet and some caramel malt would have brought some sweetness to balance the dryness form the hops. Body is quite full with some medium carbonation."
"Dry. Leaves a film. It is ever-so-English. Thick. The consummate English bitter. Toasted, dry, good malt. It's just REALLY good."
"12 oz bottle pours a copper color with a one finger head with moderate retention. Aroma is floral hops and complex malts. Taste is like a hopped brown ale. Chocolately and burnt malts meld with a hoppy floral presence. Nice bitterness level. Mouthfeel is fine. One 12oz serving was enough for me. I had to keep reminding myself to drink it because it just didn't call my name for some reason."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: I have to admit it, I am not an extreme beer guy. I like traditional, well made beers, and this is one of them. Enough hops to make you notice, but well balanced by maltiness."
"Very good bitterness, though leaf hop sucking, balanced with orange citrus and malt, like blending with an American pale. Drinkable,but a bomber is too much even for the two of us. Orangey colour body with good creamy head. Willamette and East Kent Golding hops. Smooth mouthfeel."
"Drinks very easy, I do remember this being a little truer to its english-style roots & remember it being better then. Not a bad choice to session on. Not a huge fan of amarillo hops though.."
"Not a bad beer though, and few from Rogue are."
"Taste was actually pretty good. A nice hoppy bite that reminded me of some type of leathery varnish (just a mental ""tasting"" image, not a bad thing) and well-balanced, roasted toffee malts to boot. Mouthfeel was crisp, carbonated, and left a lingering aftertaste which I enjoyed. I'd probably pick up other Rogue brews (i.e. Brutal Bitter), but this one got the job done."
"For an English Bitter, the YSB lacks balance and is off the mark in flavor. With that said, this is still a Rogue ale and still pretty tasty."
"Very creamy,a nice bit of cloyingness,a bit grainy,overall a very nice mouthfeel. The pleasing mouthfeel makes for a great drinkability. 22oz. went down very easy and could easily drink another."
"Was able to try this brew on tap, It was poured to a dark amber color with just a trace of head that was so small that it did not leave any lacing what so ever, I thought that it could have been close to the end of the kegs life but when I asked the bar keep he said that they just put it in tap the evening before. The aroma is nice, with a bitterness that is easily recognized when you take a good whiff. Also picking up some nice malt characteristics but they seem to be very mellow. The taste is good, very smooth with the malt flavor coming out in front but quickly breaking away to the hop finish that seems to have a fruit like property, or at least is mixed in with the hops. Overall this was a nice brew and glad I was able to give it a try, even with the light carbonation the taste was very good which made it a solid choice for the evening."
"Nice drinking beer. Would be great to session."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but just a little too sweet for a bitter in my book."
"Appearance is hazy, mahogany in color, with thin foam that breaks apart leaving a pencil thin ring. Aroma of lightly smoked caramel malt, and mild hops. Hint of diacetyl. I detect more of the smokey, malt flavor in the taste, and it also has some sweetness to it. The finish is lightly bitter, with only mild alcohol notes. Carbonation is moderate, the body is somewhere between light and medium. There is a good balance of malt flavors and hop bitterness here, enough to make it drinkable. Not bad, thanks to Vancer for the bottle..."
"A 22oz bomber with a painted-on label - Pours a medium reddish amber color with a very thin off-white head. Little retention and only spotty lacing. Nose is dominated with sweet malts and a slight nutty character. Only slight flowery hop in the nose. Palate is wonderously malty, yet balanced. Not overly sweet. The goldings hops assert themselves just after the malt sweetness upfront. Perfect carbonation and a very good medium/light mouthfeel. Finished quite dry. Really a very good english bitter. Very drinkable in my opinion. Yet another great beer from Rogue."
"A hard style to find a good one in is the ESB, but this one is a definite above average brew. Pours a decent, creamy head. Smells of light fruit and some hoppy grapefruit, as well. Starts out quite sweet ending with a refreshing bitter hoppiness. A nice, clean, refreshing brew that can be drank anytime."
" A medium amber with a hint of gold and mostly clear, it forms a nice head that subsides to a 1/2 collar. The smell is mild but redolent of fine malt, caramel and touch of spicy and floral hops. It's a light bodied, lightly carbonated brew meant for an afternoon of sipping and ity tastes so good you will want to sip it all day. Very well balanced with just a hint of roasted malt in the mix, a subdued but tangy yeastiness and restrained but evident floral and spicy hoppiness with maybe a tinge of dry citrus. A session beer par excellence."
"22-ounce silkscreened bottle. Ruddied amber with a dense and creamy manilla head. Appealing mellow English hop aromas (EKG); a bit of toasty buttered biscuit as well. Warm rounded malts introduce the taste, with a biscuity character being most prominent. There is an ever-so-slight butteriness to the biscuit flavor, and there are some green plum and other watery fruit flavors -- the character is almost woody. Leafy English hops bring the swallow to a close, and a strikingly sharp mineral finish seals it up. The mouthfeel here is incredibly smooth. Medium body gives it just enough heft. A ridiculously drinkable bitter. I actually much prefer this to Rogue's Brutal Bitter ESB. I'm very glad to have found this at Beers of the World in Rochester, and I hope they continue to stock it. Pairs great with my vegan mac and ""cheese"" with boiled collard greens."
"D- I think I like it. Not bad by any means. Theres just flavors in it I cant put my finger on and couldnt tell if I liked it. It is better than ok. Also I was expecting a lot more bitter just based on the name."
"Pours to a nice deep rustic brown body. Head is a light tan fluffy inch leaving a bit of lace as it fades. Nose is a nice mix of hops and invigorating spiceyness. Includes a hint of citrus and light woodsy malt. Hoppy bitter is not as nwarly preminent as I would have expected. But it is long and even throughout the opening through the end of the palate. Nellow citrus notes with maybe even hints of vanilla and honey twords the finish. Mouthfeel is very mellow for the style, enhancing the drinkability of this one. Grab a six pack."
"I would love to try this on cask!"
"Drinkability - easy to drink, could have another one"
"D- This beer is dry as dust with a big hop flavor. Not much other flavor or interesting characteristics going on."
"This beer doesn't do the bar/restaraunt or the brewer justice. There are much better products offered from both."
"Final Thought: As unique as LeftHand's Jackman's Pale Ale and Magic Hat's #9 - and that is a huge compliment."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, buttery, and way too drinkable... this beer was the bomb tonight. Seafoamy effervescence in the mouth was perfect for the big, juicy flavors here. Unmatched in my opinion, this is terrific."
"-SS"
"Another beer from this month's beer club (the Michiana Coalition of the Drinking) Reasonably cloudy for a bitter. orangy-red. very small head. Light, hoppy citrus odor. Not particularly bitter, some hop flavor and mild, sweet malts. syrupy texture. fairly heavy. Ok on the drinkability but overall a bit bland and forgettable."
"Overall: This is awesome. Compared to other bitters I've had this one really does come on top of the heap. Awesomely complex smell and flavor. Still keeps with some of the traditional Rogue profile but distinctly suited well to this style."
"Rogue solidifies their position as one of my favorite breweries although this isn't one from their top shelf."
"pours a clear burnt sienna with caramel highlights in a pint glass. off white eighth inch head that drops to a ring but laces well. aroma is not very strong. clean light hop aroma with a lightly sweet aroma to compliment. not much else to say here. taste is not overly complex either. there's a medium bitterness mixed with high carbonation disguising any hop character. there is some fruit flavor, mild like peach or apricot, but these are quickly displaced by a metallic flavor. there is a yeasty and dry bitterness in the finish. mouthfeel is light and crisp and easily quaffable. high carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. overall, this isn't more than an average bitter and one of my least favorite offerings from rogue. not terrible, but you might want to seek better."
"Overall--Really good English Special Bitter. Go for it. This will definately be in my regular rotation."
"Pours a cloudy, dark orange with a small but thick head resulting from the hard pour. I think if I'd poured the way I usually do the head would have been very small, but I suppose that's unimportant. Smell is a bit lacking. Some hops are present, but other than that it's pretty bland. Taste is much more robust, with plenty of butter and caramels come through, along with some slight fruitiness over the always present hops that become more pronounced in the finish. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp, and well carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. A very solid bitter, and an eminently sessionable brew, but for me there are better options for the money."
"Nice body, easily one of the most sessionable beers I've had."
"Just a solid English bitter - good example that it shouldn't have to melt glass to warrant a good review."
"The color is dark amber with a small off white head. There is a nice sweet smell with a light hop aroma. The taste is good, the hops balance the malt nicely. The mouthfeel is a little thin, and the carbonation is very light so it has a watery feel to it. It is very easy to drink."
"Even with a strong pour, the head just doesn't add up to much..the aroma is dusty pale malt and a touch of hops. In the flavor, the Goldings hops lend a nice touch, but a little light in body and taste. This beer would benefit from a few more bold touches made to it. Overall, this may be a good session ESB, but there are far better ones, and you don't even have to look very far."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel- A Mix between a rich and light bitter. Very complex palate."
"""Not too filling...not too strong...just right"""
"Body near medium with a crisp, dry mouthfeel and tingling, effervescent carbonation. Body is appropriate for the style and it's very easy to drink."
"Quite smooth on the drink with malt upfront and bitter on the back. Strawberry notes and touches of hops. Fairly well balanced."
"Im please and will make frequent return visits to this one."
"Pours a cloudy brown/amber color, some carbonation, small head, nice lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malt, and caramel. Very nice taste of caramel, and malts, a little dry, but not that bitter at all. Medium body. Another excellent brew from Rogue, if I were to guess the ABV I would say about 5-5.2%. This is a very drinkable brew and would make a nice session drink."
"Overall - Highly recommended, very drinkable...."
"this one pours darker than i was expecting. so it's an english bitter? well it is bitter, and not very drinkable. so judged against the style it is too bitter and not drinkable enough in my opinion. however it is a very good beer with a very good aroma. i'm curious as to the abv. if i had to guess i would say around 5.5 to 6.25"
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation. Loads of great aromas with this one: beginning with citrus and bready malts, then evolving into black licorice and flowers. The flavors arent quite as complex, but strike a good balance between malt and bitterness. An average Rogue beer, which is still pretty good in my books."
"Thanks to JacktheRipper for the opportunity to try this rare brew."
"Drinkability- Went down smooth and crisp. If this is truly an English Bitter, it's one of the better ones I've had."
"Overall - Really nice drinkable ESB from Rogue. Mildly British like in its use of caramel flavors. Finishes very nicely with some light tea notes."
"A nice offering, wholly drinkable, and in that class of solid brews I've come to expect from these guys."
"A very solid-all-around beer. The only disparaging thing I could really say is that the mouthfeel is a bit watery. Just a little thicker would do it. Very attractive head and a bright amber color. Nice to look at. Also very flavorful - tastes great. I could drink quite a few of these. High marks all around."
"12 ounce bottle. Bright amber with a huge creamy looking white head. Caramel malt aroma with English hops. Crisp malt flavor. At different times, the malt is caramel-like, then toasted. Slighty fruity tasting. Generous portion of hops in the finish. This would make a fantastic session beer. This is a very tasty Rogue beer, not as crazy as their Brutal Bitter, but easier to drink."
"A pretty tasty little bitter, would make a damn good session beer"
"D&N: Interesting because it's a beer made on the west coast for a killer bar here in PA. I don't know if this is just their Younger's Special Bitter repackaged for us, it might be interesting to do a side by side tasting to try and find out. I didn't know if I'd like a bitter, but I seemed to have blinked twice and drained 3/4 of the glass. Goes down very well, feels a bit hot but that's ok. I love surprises, and this one is quite tasty."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: a medium-bodied Premium Bitter with full flavour and very smooth mouthfeel, its aftertaste outweighs the palate but generally is quite balanced. Couldn't get enough of this drink when friends are around~~ Almost the best bottled bitter I've tried recently!"
"22 ounce bottle. Brewed for Summitts Wayside Tavern in Sandy Springs, GA. Purchased at Jax in Sandy Springs."
"The color is deep copper. Head is average sized, but retention is fairly weak. The aroma is of moderate citrusy hops with touchs of malt and fruitiness. Sip starts with tasty caramel malts which lead to a splash of hops with a mild fruity undertone. Finish concludes with more malts and hop bitterness. This is probably the least interesting beer that I've had from Rogue, yet it's still very good and almost too drinkable. I just read on Rogue's website that they no longer selling Younger's as sixers, only as 22 oz. bombers and draft, which is too bad because this is a great session choice."
"Dark amber color with a very thin head head that disappears pretty quickly. Somewhat underwhelming. Malty scent with some fruit and a little fruitiness that reminds me of apricot. The flavor is, believe it or not, bitter. Luckily, there's more to it than that. There's a fruitiness in there as well, a little bit of citrus like orange. Aftertaste is very pleasant, too, kind of toasted malt. Mouthfeel is a little light for me, but it's not distracting. Overall, a nice beer that I could probably knock back a few of."
"Pours a cloudy dark copper color with a nice bubbly head. The head quickly dissipates, but some lacing is apparent. Clean floral aroma with citrous hops and a little grassiness, along with some faint caramel. Malt comes through in the taste more than you would expect from the nose. Very smooth with a little toastiness, balanced by clean citrous and pine hops. The malt sticks through to the end, balancing the hops quite well with a little caramel sweetness. The finish is bitter orange peels and grass, with a bit of a metallic off-taste. Quite a good, easy drinking bitter."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Prosit!"
"I will most likely drink this again."
"This one's pretty tasty. Caramel hops dominate with a bitter orange hop finish. There is some lacing with a par head. This is a session beer pure and simple, an afternoon beer, if you will. This would be a great one to have on had at all times. Cheers."
"Overall Impression: All in all an amazingly balanced beer that is incredibly drinkable. Line me up several of these and I'd be happy all day."
"Drinkability is ok for this style due to the metallic feel, grapefruit flavor, and horseblanket yeast this is not a session beer for me."
"copper colored brew with small white head tha leaves moderate lacing. The smell is malt and citrous like hops. The taste is very nice with a caramel malt flavor just slighlty overpowered by a crisp hop bitterness that tastes just great. Good carbonation. Mouthfeel is good but just a little bit two thin in my opinion. Drinkability is excellent. Overall delicious brew that you could drink all night."
"This is certainly malt drivin brew, but you can't over look the big hop flavor. Sweet and fruity. Maybe the hops are a little much for the style? Who cares! This brew tastes great."
"Was lucky to stumble across this one at the H.B. and was well worth a crack. Great beer."
"Amber color body with a big frothy white head. More of a hoppy nose than a malty one. Some light fruit in the aroma as well. Taste is clean, crisp, and dry throughout, however this beer is lacking some important malt flavor. Not very complex in my opinion. I might say this beer is just boring. It's kinda like a hoppy lager. A little weird they call this one a special bitter. It's more like just a bitter."
"Had this on cask at the Horse Brass in Portland, OR. Poured a coppery amber with a surprising head (likely thanks to being pumped from the keg by a 350lb bartender.) Lightly floral aroma, a definite citrus bitterness matched with a super-smooth malty creaminess, a contradiction but a good one. Has a nice smooth finish with a bit of brown sugariness, this turned out to be a refreshingly good cask beer, even if it's a combination of extremes."
"Drinkability: Lets just say, if you drank these until you became disinterested youd have a long walk home or a nice night in jail. Three cheers for Rogue tying things back and making a damn impressive session brew."
"A good cask bitter. Not one i'd really ever lust for."
"Full body, carbonated just right. Goes down smooth."
"Slightly watery in the mouth (again, on style)--and went down like water (high drinkability). A great on-style brew."
"Not an especially interesting beer, probably the tamest Rogue product I've had. Definitely easy drinking, however."
"Mouthfeel is well carbonated, and there are hints of viscuity particularly at the end, but overall it is pretty light. The drinkability on it is fine, but as I said, it really doesn't stand out from the pack, so I doubt I'll be picking it up again."
"The taste is very hoppy with hints of lemon. Tastes much like some IPAs I have had recently, but not quite as hoppy. The hops do come out in the aftertaste. This is a good beer that I would recommend as a refreshing summer drink."
"pours out a hazy dark amber colour with a thick foamy head. subdued aroma of english style hops, an earthy maltiness, and a somewhat sweet caramelish smell...it's very nice. in the english bitter tradition, it's quite tame...with enough hopping to spice things up....very earthy and a bit spicy...medium bodied with a touch of alcohol bite. smooth body, if you like the added rogue hop zest...and finishes a bit bitter and earthy. rogue doesn't produce a bad beer...just ones that aren't as BIG as others....this one is a good one...and a nice twist on the english bitter style. recommended."
"I really like this beer. It's much more balanced than the Brutal Bitter (which is good in it's own way). I usually don't eat when I'm drinking craft beer, but next time I may pair this one with a pizza. Overall, a very good brew."
"Great example of its style. Consistently balanced. Front is an herbal fruitiness with notes of grapefruit and melon. Mid is dry and maintains the fruitiness, this time in a ripe fashion. Finish is moderately hoppy and mainly dominated by caramel."
"On the palate it races along throwing off flavors of scorched pine sap, grapefruit candy, toffee and other, woody resins. It is light to medium-bodied and medium in length. This is a reasonable way to apply Cascade hop extracts to one's palate. It is not too heavy, nor out of balance ultimately."
"Pours a orangy copper with a small frothy head that subsides quicky. Smell is of caramel malt and piney (cascade?) hops. The taste is smooth with nice soothing malts at first and then going into the nice piney hops. Unlike Brutal Bitter, the hops in YSB are more subdued and balance well. Mouthfeel is quite good. Very easy drinking and not over done on the hops. It might be the most ""balanced"" beer Rogue puts out. This might be the best session beer Rogue has out there. Certainly an American take on a ""bitter", but a well done one and one that could be quaffed all night without problem"
"This was a beer that has high expectations but fell just a little short. It poured a dark orange color with about an inch of white foam that left patches of sticky lace down the glass. The smell of this beer was quite lite, with a very sweet malty scent and slight scents of orange. The taste was a little weird with a thick malt hit in the beginning that threw me off and reminded me of Marsala wine, a decent breadiness in the middle and a slightly bitter hop finnish. The mouthfeel was good but the taste was just a little off to me. Try it for yourself."
"Clear orange/amber, pinky high ivory cap, becomes fluffy and crusty looking as it slowly dwindles down to a thin haze on top and a thin collar. Lace in minimal strings. Aroma reminds me of a very subdued barleywine-esk nose, some caramel, a bit toasty, slight pine sap, sweet malt mostly, dry hop leaves and floralness touch the back end in bigger wiffs. Taste is nice and mild, welcoming warm toasty malts favor from front to back. Some refined and soft malt sweetness of breads and dull fruit keep it smooth and tolerable to the palate. There's a nice subtlety about its approach. Floating and caring malt character with the same amount of comfort with the hop profile which has very slight floral, citrus, and pine mindfully placed in different areas throughout the palate. Feel is light and fluffy with a firm and sturdy, smoother lighter body. Which seems to fit this here, making for a nice little drinker. This is one of the few 12oz bottles with a paper label that Rogue distributes, which is a bit weird, cuz I really like seeing the ingredients listed like on their bombers. Oh well...label, no label, this is a pretty nice beer."
"Tawny-coppery gold in hue, this has a lovely color, slightly hazy too. A skimpy white head of a half finger briefly formed, it actually faded to a soapy cap before I could set my glass down after the pour. No subsequent lacing. The nose is brighter than a traditional bitter, as expected by Rogue. The hops shine with good citrusy depth, it is very fleshy with its grapefruit notes. Sharp pine notes follow. However before the bouquet ends the malt becomes noticeable with its biscuit and caramel aromas. I like the fragrance; it is straightforward but inviting. The palate is tasty and dead-on as to what the nose told me what to expect. The hops are a little juicier and the flavors are a bit wider as they encompass both lemon-like citrus and grapefruit. As the hops conclude on the palate they become very dry, which is quite nice. Random orange flavors sprung up. Long hoppy aftertaste, which seems more a kin to an APA, this is no surprise as Rogue is often hard to pinpoint a style on. The malt doesnt say much and it is very secondary only offering suggestions of biscuits and caramel hints. Once the beer warmed to room temperature I thought it fell apart a little, I was a bit too slow drinking it I guess. For the most part this beer is damn tasty. And only modestly bitter. Medium in body, moderate but natural feeling carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. This was a pleasure to drink. Very enjoyable, true it is quite tame compared to other Rogue beers; Im not knocking it though. I bought a 12-ounce bottle in Iowa City for $1.80. Id drink it again."
"Geez, I wish this was available locally!!!"
"All in all a very nice beer. Would probably make an excellent session beer."
"Pours rusty-orange with a feeble white head and nil lacing. Aroma is full of caramel and Cascade hops with a bit of frutiness in the finish. Taste is initially bitter, becoming more flowery in the middle before a fair sweet finish. Mouthfeel is a ittle chewy and oily. Drinkability is great. Imbalanced and bitter like I like 'em, but not bitter enough. Good stuff with homemade nachos."
"This Rogue pours a clear, deep amber with a medium light tan head. To the nose there was a hoppy aroma underscored by light citrus touches--lemon and lime primarily--and a hint of malts. The taste is balanced; it's primarily hops with a good complementing sweet maltiness and maybe some spices, corriander, perhaps? Good, dry finish."
"as far as rogue 6 packs, i really only grab the honey cream. its a great hot weather brew. i was about to do the usual but i have been eyeing this bitter for quite awhile. what the hell, ill be crazy. so this stuff pours out a very nice deep copper with not much of a head. awesome color though. the aroma is hoppy but also has a very nice caramel like malt hangin right in there. flavor wise, this is a about as good as it gets. toasted/caramel malt, slightly sweet, it trades blows with a strong but not overpowering hop finish. awesome balance. satisfying medium bodied mouthfeel, it finishes a bit dry. this a superb bitter, great session drinking and down right tastey. im hyped. really hyped. like alot."
"On draught at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh. I am pretty sure this is Rogue's ESB, despite the fact that our server told us it was brewed ""especially for Fat Head's"". Dark amber color with a thin but creamy off-white head. Aroma is somewhat bitter hops with a light malt character. Medium-bodied and nicely bitter hops and citrus flavors. The finish is somewhat dry with subdued hops. Overall pretty good ""exclusive"" beer."
"This amber ale had little head, but a lot of pride. The Aromas of hops and spices was quite inviting. Unfortunately, the flavors in the beer weren't much more complex. While the bitter had an amazing balance between the malts and the bittering hops, it seemed that the spicy notes were distractingly strong. While they would have been a pleasant background effect, the cask tasted a bit like a spiced beer that was modeled after an ESB. The dry, tangy finish was quite pleasant. The beer was good, but not outstanding"
"Drinkability: This is a very easy drinking beer. That is assuming, of course that you like hops. Although it is nowhere near as hoppy as the big double IPAs, it could bee too much for yellow beer drinkers."
"A rather dry finish. This is a drinkable beer but it is not that remarkable."
"Good overall brew, from a good overall brewery."
"Poured out a nice amber color with some carbonation that lasts all the way through. NIce notes of malts and a hint of caramel come through. Taste. This is a bitter? Tastes somewhat similar to Fuller's ESB if anything. Hops and malts collide against the palate with some toasted flavors and caramel undertones. Toasted flavors last through the aftertaste. Finishes quite dry. Solid brew."
"I was very impressed by this. This beer dances on the border of ESB. Honestly, I would have categorized it as such. Whatever the case may be this beer is really good. It has a nice hops/malt balance that you really look for in a beer. Very drinkable, esp. for a relatively hoppy brew (even for non-hopheads)."
"Rusty amber-orange color with light haze and active carbonation. Topped with a substantial tan froth that dissipates into an nicely clingy lace. Sweet and (no surprise) bitter scents balance nicely in the nose. This balance carries over into the wonderful taste, which features a sweet but not cloying malt base with a bitter bite that is there from start to persistent finish. Mouthfeel is a little stickier than expected but by no means bad. I'll grab this one again."
"Appearance: Amber hue a nice creamy caramel hued head leaves nice even lacing as it dwindles. Aroma: Sweet caramel malt backbone wrapped with pine and earthy toned hops, along with a nice bready characteristic Pac Man yeast I presume. Taste: Extreme bitterness in the flavor but also sorts some good earthy and floral hop tones, a nice biscuit sweetness balances the hop barrage. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied some hop resins stick to the palate but pretty smooth overall. Drinkability: Healthy dose of hops with a nice malt character tasty ale."
"Refreshing -- would go great with spicy food. I'm fantasizing about a plate of hot wings before me."
"I'd rather call this an American amber ale than a bitter."
"YSB is yet another quality beer from Rogue Ales. English Bitter isn't a style that I'm familiar with, but I enjoyed this one very much. Thankfully, it's available in my local grocery."
"Drinkability - Pretty tasty stuff, it could grow on me easily. Should appeal to the hop lover in us all."
"Had at Redbones. Clear dark amber when poured, it came with a decent piney aroma. It starts with a smooth malty touch which runs into a syrupy mouthfeel. Ends in a nice hop finish, but the mouthfeel isn't as dry as it could be. Not a bad beer, but slightly syrupy."
"The beer pours a reddish amber color with a thick off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent surrounded by their signature hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a nice malty palate with a bitter finish. It is filled with hops again in the taste. It's good, but I wish they would back off the hop flavor on this one so that the true malt character can be revealed. The mouthfeel is good. It's a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer goes down easy, but I don't think It's true to the style. That said. I could drink this until the cows come home."
"Smelled of florals, rose petals, and fresh cut grass. Lots of Hops, and slightly tart medicinal smell. Taste was hop concentrated to start, striking bitterness. Big and unbalanced almost. Crystal and carmel malt way in the background, lacked any bready biscuit sweetness and body. Medium to light bodied. Very good and drinkable, but I think the hop flavors were a touch overdone and aggresive. Tasted to me like a West Coast version of English Bitter, which it is, but I guess not what I had expected."
"Pours a golden amber with a small off-white head that disappears virtually altogether. The aroma has quite a bite -- hops with nettle-like character. The mouthfeel is smooth -- unexpectedly so -- and the flavor is mild and pleasant. The hop bitterness is present, but not biting like it is in the aroma. This was much more drinkable than I expected -- bitter, but blended and enjoyable."
"This is a terrific session brew."
"This was a great American bitter. On cask, the carbonation was so light and made the ale absolutely great. The head was thick and lasted for the whole beer. The color was red with a slight orange tint. The hops were very present in the nose. Very clean hops commanded the first taste. As you moved through the beer, the warm temperature and low carbonation made the ale absolutely great. The biscuity malt was a great balance to the bitterness which had hints of citrus and grass. A great cask-conditioned ale."
"I was disappointed with Rogue's offering here. It poured a hazy amber color with a solid head that had decent retention. The smell was rather weak and all that I could get was hops. The body in this beer was what hurt it to me. No body! It almost tasted like many homebrews that I have had before, low consistency. Malts were faint and few. Maybe a slight caramel sweetness and grainy base. Hops were present but weren't that bitter, more flavoring hops in this case. It wasn't the worst beer (the flavors mixed well) and really was about average in terms of style, but I'm expecting more from Rogue."
"A pleasure to drink and a perfect session beer any time of the year. Very well done!"
"Easily among my favorite session brew choices, a treat every time."
"Pours a clear tea-like color with a 1-1/2 finger off-white head. The aroma consists of a citrus fruit smell with a slight sweetness and grapefruit tartness. The taste has an initial bite from the light carbonation and pronounced hops that tingle your tongue and slides into a toasty malt flavor and tapers into a slight grassy taste. This is a light to medium bodied brew that finishes slightly watery which is not what I expected from this style. Still not terrible, but perhaps not the best offering from a brewery in which I hold in high regard. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable beer that is almost like a pale ale. This was a nice easy drinking beer."
"On tap at Horse Brass in Portland, served in a 10 oz mini-imperial pint glass . Color was a clear reddish-amber with a thin fine white head. The brew possessed a mild resiny-citrusy boquet of hoppiness. Very nice for the style. In the taste was the right balance of hoppy bitterness and malt character. This made for a very tasty and crisp beverage. The mouthfeel could have been thicker but was still within specs for the style. Carbonation was a bit low too, but could this have been particular to the keg at hand. The drinkablitly was great. Overall a tasty and refreshing bitter."
"Pours a hazy orange with minimal white head and splotches of lacing. Not much on the nose, other than a hint of pine and sour citrus. Mouthfeel is light to medium-light bodied, dry and bitter, and ample carbonation. Taste has caramel malt, pine, and grapefruit, but is bitter overall. Very dry finish is clean and refreshing. Nice American example of the English style."
"Pours a medium abber with not much head to it very light and fades quickly,the aroma seems more on the malty side lightly fruity and some caramel/nut tones.A nice mix here,more of a malt tilted brew wich is somewhat sprising coming from Rogue,nice biscuit malt flavor with some light sweetness finishing with some piney-like hop flavors.One of my favorite ones from Rogue wich sometimes overhop their brews in my opinion."
"ng"
"Served at cellar temperature. Medium brown in color, with a white head that leaves a layer coating the top of the beer. Hops really dominates the smell, with a little hint of caramel. Tastes relatively thick, with a smooth taste that finishes off with a nice bit o' hops."
" As easy drinking as it gets. Gives the hop lover all he/she needs without being over the top. An essay in balance, which is not common from the Rogue people. Outstanding. But hey, we're talkin Rogue here."
"There's a hop/malt balance typical of the style here. The hops refresh, the malt fills in the blanks. I'd have one or two more, certainly. Again, it is indicative of the British bitter style, and while not a clone of any one specifically, it's a pleasant example. I wasn't overly impressed by any one component of this beer, but it seems a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts."
"Drinkability: If you like bitters, this could be your cup of tea. The sixer I purchased shouldn't last too long, I should think."
"Wonderfully balanced beer. Dark Copper color, a tad bit on the cloudy side. This beer is an awesome session beer. I so wish I could get this on a regular basis. The hops are in this beer, both flavor (flowery, slight citrus)& bittering, and they are perfectly balanced by the malt."
"Overall, this is a nice, nice bitter. I feel like I should be in a Yorkshire pub enjoying this one."
"A drinkable beer indeed..but more like aPacific Pale than a bitter IMO."
"Nice enough bitter, but not something I'll probably remember days down the road."
"Pours a hazy medium copper in color with an off-white head. Aroma consists of sweet caramel, floral hops, candied raisins and butterscotch. The mouthfeel is medium-to-full-bodied. Initial smoothness, gives way to a stinging carbonation on the tongue, which lessens as the beer warms. Fruity and juicy hop flavors dominate. There's a very nice roasted malt and caramel flavor underneath. Finish is moderately bitter and hints at a dryness that never quite materializes. The bitterness is balanced pretty well with the malt flavor and actually I thought the beer would have been more bitter than it was. Nuances in the flavor really emerge as the beer warms to room temps. The water almost seems to have an English ""hard-water"" quality to it."
"A very nice brew. Some floral notes in the smell..decent coppery color, head leaves some lacing. Taste had a nice floral, hoppy aspect....mouthfeel was nice and balanced. A slight, pleasant aftetaste reminded you of teh pleasant drinking experience. Extremely drinkable... a very nice brew!"
"Drinkability  This is a good standard for a bitter. Well done."
"Poured a rocky white head that did not last very long and subsided into a thin white layer of foam atop a rich amber colored beer. Aroma was of sweet malt and a hint of hops. Smooth and balanced flavors between the malt and the hops start off clean then finish with a definite hop bite. Mouthfeel is good as it contributes to the smoothness of the malt flavors. Overall this is a good beer though i would rather have other better beers that Rogue makes instead of this one."
"A mouthfeel that is dry and buttery at the same time. Easy to drink many in one session. Well it does have alcohol in it, so not too many. A real easy drinker and a great bitter ale."
"Overall a Great Bitter!"
"Amber reddish color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Medium bodied bitter. Hoppy and malty. Full flavored bitter. Caramelized malts, good blend of hops. Some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Theres a good looking off white head on top of this deep orange/amber body. Good amounts of lacing. The nose is caramel with some flowery notes as well. As for the taste, this is quite a good one. Its a very rich flavor, with nice caramel and some fruity flavors being topped off by a great hop bitterness. This is definately a nice beer."
"If I wasn't the poorest, sorriest college student there ever was, this is the kind of beer that would inhabit the entire top shelf of my fridge. It pours a Godly amber hue with a moderate yet long-lasting head. The distinctive Rogue flavor sits behind a powerful contingent of hops. A fantastic brew, and one that I shall enjoy as long this fast-paced brewery makes it."
"Cask conditioned imperial pint - looks cloudy and amber, big head that thins quickly. Nice balanced hop aroma, both field and citrus grove. Taste has a distinctly Rogue malt profile, nice chewy feel. Clean hop start and finish, nice for a bitter. Leaves the mouth asking for another sip."
"Pours an amber hue with a white head, a nice medium bodied beer with some nice english hopiness to it. In a day and age where cascade seems to run the show, its nice to enjoy a different flavor of hopiness. An enjoyable beer. A good gateway or session beer."
"My initial aroma shot is of a very pleasant floral and citrus aroma. The malt qualties don't present themselves later. Pours with large full head that breaks down slowly. Very clear orange amber color. With the flavor I'm again taken by the strength of the hops presence. The malt balances and smooths off the hops, thus preventing the drink from being to bitter, but aren't offering enough of a presence to make it a malt based beer. Even with warming the malt didn't make enough of a presence. Nice smoothness to the mouthfeel, making it an easy drink. A good tasting beer, but not a fine enough sample of style. Not sure why my sample is different than others. No dating on the bottle to give a hint as to that issue."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a dark reddish-amber color with only half a finger of head, even with an aggressive pour. There is a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell begins with hops up front, then some caramel and maple maltiness comes through. The taste is a good balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Bits of toffee and grass are present. The body is fairly smooth, but just a bit oily. The drinkability is very nice for this great session bitter."
"A nice hazy copper color when poured at the brewery while on tap. The taste, unlike the bottle version which had caramel and malts, this tap version had a awful sour after taste that made this YSB unpleasant and undrinkable. Drink the bottled YSB;and stay away from the tapped YSB!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy deep orange color with a large rocky light tan head. The smell is sweet malt and a slight earthiness. The taste is mild maltiness balanced by a crisp earthy hoppiness with a silky rounded mouthfeel. A very enjoyable drinkable mild bitter that is fairly well balanced."
"Good beer, kind of subtle for a Rogue. Grassy smell and taste. Not overly bitter (but I had a Stone Ruination prior, so that may have blasted my taste buds!). This is an unusual offering, nice but not outstanding. Smooth, somewhat thin. It was somewhat refreshing to have a Rogue that wasn't overly dry and bitter, but this is not a standout, IMO."
"Clear copper color with a thick, chunky off-white head. The aroma is somewhat fruity with a slight graininess, and a bit of malt. It has a spicy hop flavor, with a malty background that balances out the hops. It has a slight fruitiness in it as well. The finish is very dry; and it has a bitterness that sticks with you. Overall it is an average beer, with decent drinkability."
"This beer poured a light orange color with a minimal head and lacing and a somewhat citrus-like aroma. The taste told me that it was definitely a bitter and nothing else. If you like bitters, this is a good bitter - I enjoyed it and actually went back for seconds. A nice beer."
"Wow, another great ale from Rogue! This is fastly becoming my favorite brewery. Beautiful amber body with a generous frothy head. Aroma is piney and I think I smell almost a hint of caramel. Quite hoppy and pleasantly bitter. Has a smooth full bodied mouthfeel and finishes on the dry side. Great overall ale. This one could earn a regular spot in the fridge."
"Spot-on accurate dark orange-copper color, clear appearance with a multi-bubble size skim yellow head that laces in spots. Slightly cinnamony biscuit aroma with a prickly hop lingering in the air. Very pleasant but sharpish shortbread malt flavor upfront, tea-like body, and tastes of spice and orange with an impressively balanced peppery hop finish. Bit of pine in the aftertaste. Very nice beer, excellent balance, matches ESBs for style but with a little more hop boldness (and a little less malt sweetness) than a Fuller's. A far better approach than the mutant Brutal Bitter..."
"This beer poured an orange-amber copper color and was topped with a huge white creamy head. Sweet floral aroma matching with a beatiful malt presence. Light caramel and bitter hop tones in the flavor. Excellent bittering aspects  especially in the aftertaste. Got some sour malt and what could be described as rye bread, along with some light fruit flavors (apple, orange). An excellent and highly drinkable beer that was well made."
"Drinkability: Gimme a case."
"It pours with a bubbly head that pops away quickly. The beer is a dark orange-brown and looks pretty murky. It smells very hoppy, but there are enough other scents for it to overpower. You can taste the hops, but not too much, as is the case with many American bitters. Delicious bitter. So far, the best bitter I've had."
"It is great to see this in 6 packs. Hazy orange copper with puffy, appealing head and lace. Dead-on aroma with luscious British mustiness and caramel. Much hoppier than a British bitter would be, but fortunately not too tart and one of the easiest beers to drink on the face of the planet. This beer has it all; a robust, sweet malt quality that is salty, chewy and sugary all in one. A huge hop presence that does not overwhelm the beer (only Dogfish IPAs are such hoppy beers that are simultaneously restrained). A tantalizing yeastiness that makes you praise God for bringing back small, unfiltered microbrews. All around great. I am very jealous of our fellow beerdrinkers at the Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR, who get to enjoy this from a cask every day of the week."
"Caramel malt nose with some hop flower deep in the sinus. Hazy orange color with a nice pale sticky head.. some lace follows as you gulp. Hop bitterness throughout in addition to a nice caramel malt base. Hints of orange rind bitterness as well. A decent hoppy bitterness to the finish as well. This is a ""good""."
"Orange copper color, with a short, light brown head full of big frothy bubbles. The head disappeared quickly. Strong hop aroma and pungent hop flavor, but very balanced and not overpowering. Slight malt nuance. Bitter aftertaste that lingers after each swallow. Not much else comes through in the flavor, but this is the closest I've had to a true classic English style bitter."
"It's a surprisingly hazy reddish orange. The smell of biscuit or crackers is present with a nice dose of hops backing it up. The smell is also a bit ""biscuity," with just detectable notes of fruit. It's appropriately bitter for the style. Overall, it's a good beer but not one of the best from Rogue."
"Drinkability: I would think a hot, humid Virginia summer day would be a perfect match for this beer. A semi-persistent bittering aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. Well done."
"Pours a dark orange. Gives off a large white head and leaves a decent lace to the end. The hops hit you in the face. Floral and hints of orange. A typical Rouge beer. The taste is nice and hopie and hints of malts, dry finish. Very drinkable. Another fine beer from Rouge."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange color with a 1/4-inch head that fades away almost immediately. Nose is bursting with floral hops, citrus peel, and a touch of caramel. The taste was quite hoppy, intermixed with orange zests. There was a bit of bittersweet flavor on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a fizzy bite from the carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer, another great brew from Rogue."
"Poured a bright orange color, with a quickly dissapating head. Pleasant floral hop aroma. Hops of course dominate the flavors and provide a tasty bitterness and an earthy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is also really impressive, very smooth. Another winner from Rogue - I would recommend it to any pale ale fan."
"A very nice bitter. Beautiful slightly cloudy appearance, kind of a cheery orange-yellow. Aroma is hoppy and, I thought, slightly sweet. Very clean taste, nice hop buzz, slightly gritty mouthfeel. What a nice beer for a hot afternoon this would be. Head is not particular long-lived, moderate lacing. Crisp. Well done."
"Easily one of the best session brews you could buy. It poured dark copper with a kind of weak head, but some fine lacing. It smelled of powerful citrus and hop bitterness just like a bitter ought to. Taste was exactly how it should be. Crisp, clean and hoppy with some lemon and orange flavors tingling my tongue. I could easily find myself buying much more of this in the future."
"Dark amber with a light tan/cream head. The head fades quickly. Caramel notes with strong hop florals dominate the aroma. The flavor is light and smooth, with a great balance of malt and hops. There's a touch of citrus in the finish. A light toasted maltiness makes this beer really appealing. The mouthfeel is decent, the drinkability very good. I'd like to get some of this as a session beer for the summer. A very balanced, smooth beer."
"Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a thin head. Aroma is grassy with a bit of a fruit undertone. Flavor begins with some toasted malt, then gets overcome by grassy herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body. This beer is a bit one-sided as far as the flavor goes. Would benefit from some more malt to balance things out. A decent beer, but not an ESB that I'm likely to seek out again."
"Maybe this one was old (one bad thing about Rogue beers - no freshness dating) but I'd pass if offered again..."
"This brew poured a murky copper color which is enhanced greatly when held up to the light. There was a white bubbly head that dissipated quickly and there was little to no lacing. The aroma is a sweet fruits with sort of flowery undertones. I could also catch a whiff of alcohol. The taste hits with a sort of sweet citrus but that is quickly dominated by a crisp bitterness. The little bit of malt taste is quickly overpowered by the hops. The finish has a hoppy kick and is a little dry. This brew is sort of sharp on the tongue but fairly easy to drink. Overall I thought this was a solid brew and I would purchase again."

"What I love about good ESBs is that the hop edge is there but with such balance with the earthy maltiness that its not about the hops really anouncing itself in an overt way (Perhaps that has its place, but just not here, if I understand the style.) Well the YSB pulls that off brilliantly. Excellent balance here, making for a very quaffable ale. Up there with Troegs and Anderson Valley's Belks as one of the best American ESBs i've had. And fortunately, unlike Shakespeare Stout, this is one of the few Rogue brews I commonly see in a six pack."
"This is the first time that I have tried this beer and I will most certainly buy it again. A great bitter, though maybe not quite as bitter as one might expect for the style."
"Overall, a very good special bitter."
"Poured reddish amber with a slight chill haze. Beige head quickly settled and left sticky lace on the glass and an uneven layer of bubbles on the surface. A big, fruity nose full of mango and malt. Toasty bread up front followed by a substantial hop kick. Malt and caramel flavors were constant throughout, though the presence of the malt grows as the beer warms and the mouth acclimates itself to the hops. There was lingering bitterness as well as some toast at the very end. Carbonation and viscosity are IMO prefect for the style."

"Drinkability: Outstanding. This is one session beer that I could put away all night long. A very easy-drinking brew. Another great product from Rogue...no surprise there."
"Deep amber the color of the beer on the pour middling is the head, the texture frothy with fair sheets of lace that cling to the last. Sweet malt aromas along with caramel and just a touch of the hop flowers greet your senses. The start is nicely sweet with the mouth feel middling, pleasingly hopped, pertinent in its carbonation and also quite dry, and a damn decent beer in my books."
"Notes & Drinkability: A bit disappointed with the head, but other than that this is an outstanding bitter and a no brainer as a session beer; flavourful and easy to drink. Spot on for the style. Lovely stuff here ..."
"Rogue's take on the ESB style (YSB in this case) is quite attractive. Pours a deep copper color with an inviting, creamy tan head which laces well. Nose features hints of sweet malt and bitter hops, which are nicely balanced. Balance is the key word with regard to the taste, as well. Typical Rogue bittering hops are in place, but they're complemented extremely well with the inclusion of sweet caramel malt. Mouthfeel is smooth with a touch of appropriate carbonation, deeming this a very quaffable beer. Highly recommended for fans of the style."
"Notes: Keep them coming, this one does me just fine. I could happily sip this brew all day long."
"This beer is a slightly hazy copper color.  A thin egg-white head sits on top and is well retained.  It's got that pungent hop aroma that I love about Rogue beers.  This carries over into the taste as well.  I also get some citric tones too.  Seems to be an adequate caramel malt backbone.  Thin and carbonated mouthfeel.  This is a decent brew, but I much prefer their Brutal Bitter."
"I'm not a fan of Rogue beers but was pleased when I tried this particular brew.  I tried it both on tap and in a bottle on the same day and really didn't tell any difference.  It has a deep dark color more like a porter with not much head.  A very faint aroma and good mouthfeel.  IMO this beer is a hybrid between a ESB and a pale ale.  I enjoyed it very much and will drink it again..............CHEERS"
"Full, rich malt with nice hop bitterness. Pretty much a solid beer for the style except for the slight twist of Amarillo hops. Not quite on level with Fuller's chewy maltiness, but still a great beer."
"Deep coppery color, short lasting head, light carbonation.  Typical hoppiness for an ESB.  A little malty overtones but after taste is clearly the hops."
"A solid Americanized ESB, as you would expect from Rogue.  Grassy Brittish hop character almost balanced by a dose of sweetish crystal malts with some toasted character in there as well.  Sweet and fruity start, dryish finish, complex enough to keep you interested."
"The large bubbled but persistent head tops a very clear bronze hued brew.  An excellent Belgian lace is left down the glass.  The hop nose is quite assertive, and consists of floral and green chlorophyll like Kent Goldings-- it smells dry - hopped or hop - backed after the boil.  Yeast esters are absent. A mild crystal malt sweentess hits the nose as well.  The body is a bit light for an ESB.  Tastewise, however, there are a myriad of flavors.  The upfront crisp and clean hop bitterness quickly gives way to light nutty and bready malt notes.  The body is just a tad thin.  Crystal malt and overall residual sweetness is overpowered by the above average hop bitterness for style. Although not as balanced as some British ESB's, the signature Rogue hop character coupled with tasty malt flavors makes this a fine and highly drinkable brew.  Yum."
"Up front this ESB is a little more tart than customary.  Good follow through with a big malt profile and well-balanced hops.  Distinctly caramel at the end for a pleasant finish.  Not my favorite Rogue brew, but I probably have come to expect too much from these folks."
"Copper amber, slight clinging lace. Caramel, biscuit nose with a hint of floral hop, choice. Rich malt spine with a well balanced bitter finish. A quality ESB from the left coast. Can Rogue do no wrong?"
"This was an excellent special bitter. The color is a deep copper and creamy / foamy dense lasting head. The aroma is of bread with citrus notes, as well as in the taste. Nice hoppy finish that lingers on the palate."
"Clear copper colored beer with a wispy head that clings to the side of the glass. Smells like bread and caramel, with grassy herbal hop notes. Inital flavor is hoppy and aggressive, followed by a very clean and caramel-like malt profile. Finish is clean and bitter, with a ""crisp"" mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Deep copper color,nice head, and good lace sheets coat your glass. Has the hoppy northwest flavor that is so familiar.  A very drnkable ale. Good solid beer from a well known micro brewery."
"This beer has been a favorite of mine for quite some time and I should've rated it much sooner. Anyway, YSB is an exceptional beer. Beautiful, hazy, deep copper color and dense lasting head. The aroma is of multi-grain bread with citrus/grapefruit hop. Mouthfeel is slick and full with a hoppy finish that lingers in the nose. Named for the Horse Brass Pub (Portland?) proprietor who sold Rogue's first beers. This beer screams quality. An American classic."
"Caramel, apricot, hops flavor and aromas.  Golden amber with a slight haze.  A mouthful of malts that soon fades into a dry bitterness.  Complex and superbly crafted, must be Rogues trademark.  Fine beer to say the least."
