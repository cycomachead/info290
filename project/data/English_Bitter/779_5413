The aroma is for the most part English malts with a hint of fruit. The taste is the sweet malt right up front followed by a hint of fruit and finishes with a slight bitterness, which wasn't hoppy though. Actually very tasty as I have never had this type of brew. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I liked this one and this style of brew.","BeerWithMike","Dec 16, 2014"

The sip, however, is markedly sharp and bitter with an initial attack of strong herbal-woody and medium earthen hopping over biscuit malts with another garnish of fig jam... it is VERY much drier and bitter on the tongue than the nose had led me to expect, and I'm liking it very much. I'm not normally a big fan of diacetyl, but somehow this beer has managed to have a reasonable modicum of butter in the aroma but hardly any at all present in the flavor, which works out for the best IMO.

Complex enduring flavors of butterscotch, caramel, blended with earthy herbal hops dominating eachother into submission to create an exhilarating layer of balance. Which exudes the palate into wanting more and more, a very easy to consume complex low in alcohol English bitter.

The beer doesn't quite achieve the look of a hand-pumped pint, and the head quickly thins to a stubborn few millimeters. The aroma is freshly baked pastries laced with hop nectar. The caramel malt backbone is quite rich for the strength of the beer and holds up the hops well. The hops are rather fruity - peaches, nectarines, meyer lemons and a hint of pineapple - with touches of mineral notes. The taste is a bit sweet, and there isn't quite enough to the hops to pull it together. The caramel malt verges on sickly, medicinal sweetness, though it's certainly not a fatal flaw in my estimation. Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but it's a pale imitation of a cask. It's hardly the fault of Adnams. I'd just love to try more English ales fresh out of a cask. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and, once again, am amazed at how much flavor English brewers can pack into <5% abv beers. Of course, not having sampled the casks of England, I really have no idea how it compares to the style. Perhaps, if I was surrounded by bitters, I wouldn't praise it so highly, but that's an issue for another day.","popery","Feb 25, 2012"

Quite citrusy and hoppy for a 3.7%abv brew. Nice maltiness in the mix as well, and a killer finish that is clean as an open sky. Mouthfeel, light and easy to drink. Refreshing even. A classic session ale.","francisweizen","Mar 24, 2004"

3.97,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"large bottle with dating, its fresh. Tasty English style ale. Medium body and nice smooth mouthfeel. Nice and malty, bready, yeasty and fresh tasting. Moderate hop bite to add balance and complexity to this brew. Completely English in its sensibilities. Doesnt overpower the ole taste buds, as some U.S. ales can do ( I love those as well dont get me wrong...)","Billolick","Mar 08, 2004"
3.85,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I ordered this at Eli Cannon's on 3-12-04 while waiting for a table. It was served at slightly below room temp. It was kind of dark in EC's but it appeared to be more of a yellow or light tan than amber like the other reviewers said. There was a nice foamy white head. The taste was nice with some hints of fruit and a creamy feel on the tongue. Good balance. I could drink it all night without feeling too dense.","govtmule","Mar 07, 2004"
3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer a cloudless amber color as it sets in my mug, the head portly in size with the color a pleasing light tan and the texture creamy, lace forms a thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is all malt, sweet and pleasant with the start lightly sweet, nice malt presence and the top light in feel to the palate. Finish is devoid of carbonation as one should expect, mild hop presence, quite dry aftertaste and quite reminiscent of CaffreyÂ’s and BoddingtonsÂ’s Cask beers, and a nice change of pace from the hearty IPAÂ’s and dark brooding beers I have sampled of late.","Gusler","Feb 16, 2004"
3.83,6.7,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"First sip reveals soft creamy texture and very faint carbonation. I get a sweet malty start which rolls over to a grassy hop finish that lingers on the roof of my mouth rather nicely. Overall the brew is mild on flavor and aroma but isnt that part of what a bitter should be? I could drink tons of these in a sitting I think. Good example of the style!","sulldaddy","Oct 11, 2003"

4.3,19.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," A nice dry, mildly hoppy ale that made you wish for more. Lucky for me I had a non-drinking driver so this was no problem. A slightly sulphuric taste in the background might put some off but this added to the long dry finish that made this a pleasure to the taste buds. Scotty, beam me back!!","bridgeporter","Jun 08, 2003"
4.27,18.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It was and is good in the free trade in London and Essex, and delightful in a rural Adnams house in its home county of Suffolk.","Seumas","Aug 11, 2002"
3.85,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I had this in the ""Sherlock Holmes Pub"" just off Tralfager Square. They have renamed it for their establishment as ""Sherlock Holmes Fine Ale"". It pours a slightly amber color. The aroma is somewhat faint, but you get both malts and hops in it. The taste is slightly bitter at first, followed by a good maltiness. Very smooth.","Boto","Beers"
3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Considering the 3.8%ABV, this was very tasty, very nice hoppy flavour, and on the drier side of the scale, very nice citric hops and satisfying bitter finish, great session ale.","rastaman","0"
