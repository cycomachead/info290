I guess you gotta make money somehow and, for reasons that I'll never understand, the majority of beer drinkers prefer something insipid, predictable, and undistinguished.

It goes downhill from there. The smell has some light butterscotch, grassy hops, tea like aroma, honey, and an odd smell that I can't quite described. Something kind of, gassy. Tastes sweet with toffee and malts, with a hint of brown sugar. Some grassy and citrus hops cleans the palate afterwards. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.

Mouthfeel is light and fairly watery though the medium body makes this fairly creamy on the tongue, minimal carbonation.

3.28,0,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Another Â“perfectÂ” nitrogen-corrupted head on this beer. Somehow the texture of nitro beers really detracts from the brews other characteristics. Below the head is a tawny colored liquid. Aroma of caramel maltÂ…intensely so. I really liked caramelized sweetness of the smellÂ…underpinnings of fruitiness and maybe a tad diacetyl, but pleasingly so (I think that the nitro-texture gets in the way when looking for the slickness). Mild hopiness, moderate to high-sweetness. The hops donÂ’t do a good job balancing the sweetness, and by the end of the brew, it becomes a little cloying. Worth a tryÂ…maybe even two or more, but not worth going out of your way to find.","Suds","Feb 01, 2004"
3.76,14.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"really nice looking beer, with a thick super creamy head that lasts to the bottom of the glass, with lacing all the way down. mild nutty slightly smokey smell. nice and mild malts nuttyness with a liottle bit of that smoke in there, real mild hops that aren't very distinctive, but present. mouthfeel is the very thinner side of medium, but well suited i think. the drinkability here is very high, it looks great has a good taste, and is low on the alcohol, i feel like i could put 6 of these away and not even notice. i would like to see a little more power behing the taste though.","kmo1030","Jan 20, 2004"
4.09,24.7,4.5,3,4.5,5,4,"It looked great as it poured and settled. The taste is similar to Belhaven's Scottish Ale but much more creamy. All the flavors are somewhat muted but, for some reason, this works very well. There is a toasted flavor upfront and a bitterness in the after-aftertaste. This beer is oh so smooth and one I can see myself returning to.","BeefyMee","Dec 21, 2003"
3.63,10.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I knew this was a low abv, so my review reflects that. Typical nice nitro head and decent caramel color. Smell was lightly malty with a bit of a smoky quality. Taste was smoky in a nice mild way...a definite session brew, Mouthfeel, as expected was light but pleasing enough. Extremely easy to drink...kind of like a light beer, but with a lot more flavor. Good for what it is, a low abv session beer.","edchicma","Dec 12, 2003"
2.03,-38.1,2.5,2,1.5,2,3,"The ""best"" thing about this beer is its nitro-can. It gives the beer an amazing head, and is a cool looking shade of blue. Everything else about it is disappointing. THe most disappointing thing: It only contains 3.9% alcohol! That's incredible! I didn't notice that until I already had poured it, and when I tasted it I couldn't deny the beer's weakness. After the creamy head was a wierd yellow beer that had almost no taste. It didn't taste bad, and it didn't taste good. It simply had no flavor. Not surprising when you consider that it is weaker than Mic Ultra, the tapwater beer. I wouldn't buy it again. If you get a chance to try it for free, do so, just so you can tell everyone about the weakest beer ever.","WMBierguy","Nov 22, 2003"
3.76,14.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Pours a light amber. For such little head it has a nice bit of lace to go w/ it. Not to much of a smell to it. it has a light, semi-sweet flavor it it. Has a hint of smoke mixed with the malty. Dry, finish, but definately not crisp, more of a nice creamy feel.Blanaced through and through. Easy drinking through and through, nice easy going beer","PSUDREW","Nov 14, 2003"
3.55,8.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pop the top and let the Nitro can do its thing. This beer pours a nice amber color after some separation and leaves behind a nice thick creamy white head that keeps its form. Smells of malts and the taste could be described as very subtle. Some may even consider this brew as being watery. Once you can get by this you notice a very nicely balance beer that has a nice malty/smokeyness to it. This beer is very drinkable and I would not pass it by if it was offered to me.","PZuke","Oct 22, 2003"
3,-8.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Another sad example of how not to package a great beer. The usual presentation for the nitro: pop the tab, dump into the glass. After the bubbles do their trick, an amber color beverage appears. First sip, watered down. I hate writing this review because you sense this is a great beer that has been destroyed by the ""widget"". A little hops, but I could not get by the watered down taste. Even my wife commented, ""this would be a good beer after mowing the lawn."" Tragedy.","bewareOFpenguin","Aug 29, 2003"
4.13,25.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Flavor is creamy and malty, with a nice nutty finish. Reminds me of that same aftertaste you get when you eat hazelnuts. No apparent metallic taste. Light earthy herbal hops, blending seamlessly with the malt. Balance like whoa. I can't tell where the malts begin and the hops end. Awesome. Damn fine beer, even in the can. I'd love to try this on tap or cask.","UnionMade","Aug 20, 2003"
3.65,11.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A staple on my recent Scotland trip. It has a black or brown plastic bubble tap sign. The extra cold version of the same beer has a blue bubble tap sign. Medium copper color, Orange looking at times, rust or brown at times depending on the light. Bubbly thin tan head. Toasted smells seem to dominate. Taste was smooth and sufficiently bitter, nice hop presence. Always a somewhat metallic taste to finish. Hard water ? Not sure, but it happened more than once. Nice nitro creaminess to it, but it seemed to get a little watery at times. Overall an easy to find, pleasing experience.","StevieW","Jul 13, 2003"

3.78,15.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark amber with a big frothy cascading head and a fair amount of lace. The mild sweet malty aroma and faint hop smell fades fast so enjoy it while you can. Notes of Caramel blend with tea-like hops. A trace of metallic bitterness can be detected with some effort. I don't know how they do it, but this ale is a pretty fair forgery of a Scottish Mild on tap.","BeerResearcher","Jun 20, 2003"
3.55,8.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is the first Belhaven product I've tried. On balance, although I've been pleased with several of the imported ales available in nitro cans, I was disappointed with this one. It poured out a nice brown color but, unusual for a product in a nitro can, had a very weak-looking head. The smell and taste seemed lighter than I would have expected for a ""Best"" - very little hop flavor - more like a summer ale. Certainly a drinkable product but I find it hard in this case to justify paying the premium import price being charged for a 4-pack","Greenlabel","May 15, 2003"
4.08,24.4,4,3.5,4,4,5,"If this is the best stuff they got, I'd hate to see the worst. Just kidding! This stuff is awesome! It's appearance isn't that bad, but I usually do like darker beers. It did have a cool seperation effect though. The head stuck around forever too, so I liked that. The taste was a very nice creamy taste, somewhat similar to the Wexford, but a little bit deeper in taste. The finish was definately smooth and didn't leave a nasty aftertaste, like most light beers.","JISurfer","May 03, 2003"
