"Pours a very cloudy dark amber with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of malt, bread and tobacco. Malt follows through on taste with a bit of bitter caramel. A bit of oil on the tongue with some carbonation. Very quaffable beer. Nothing spectacular, just solid."

"Pours a darkened amber color, a nice, heavy wood tone. Quite cloudy. I can just see the shadows of my fingers through the full glass. The head is cream-colored and creamy. It's a medium-thick blanket of foam that sticks on top of the beer for a good long time. Solid lacing. A doughy, rich malt flavor comes out as the strongest note in the aroma. There's also a good dose of caramel and some light, earthy hops. The hops make a stronger showing in the taste with a gentle bitterness and a mix of floral, earthy and grassy flavors with a touch of citrus peel. The beer is drier than expected, which is a pleasant surprise. It has a clean, rich malt character that steps aside to let the hops balance things out. Very easy to drink. Relatively low carbonation. Smooth, creamy feel. It manages to hit a rather British-y balance, which is generally hard to find among American takes on British ales. Good stuff."

"Another fine brew found in El Dorado. Pours to a generous buff head that falls to a thin layer and does produce some lacing effects. Color is a hazy amber brown. Aroma is caramel, toffee, and English hops. Flavor picks up where aroma started with a nice malty backbone with caramel malt and Maris Otter malt with a balancing charge of floral/earthy hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, no astringency and appropriate carbonation. Overall a fine English bitter that takes regional standards to a new level."

"O: Very drinkable. This would be a nice beer for an afternoon game (watching the Hogs beat the Sooners). Solid."
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of dry hops, sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of floral hops, hint of grass, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of grass, hint of dry hops, slight floral hops, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"A genuine good beer. The smell is outstanding and it has a great taste to follow."

"Overall, an exception beer, true to the style. Delicious."

"Medium bodied with a decent balance of dry, earthy hops and slightly roasted malt notes. Piny and herbal bitterness but not too dry countered by a sweet malt backbone with hints of caramel, toffee and biscuit. Crisp, slightly bitter finish. Pretty quaffable but not something that I would want to have more than one glass of in a sitting."

"Overall I need to say that I really didn't like this very much. The initial flavors and smell are good but the more important taste doesn't hold up. Thanks to Luis for bringing this back from K.C. for me to try."
"O - Easy to drink. Slightly bitter but not overly so. Easy to drink a couple of these in a short setting."
"Seek out."
"O - This is a very tasty English bitter. Another good brew from Marshall."
"O - This is a very drinkable ale. Not overly hoppy for those who don't care for the bitterness, but just enough for those of us who do. It's a very well rounded beer, definitely worth the buy."
"A worthy session beer!"
"Pretty big for the Bitter style, yeast and constant bisucity flavor takes away from the drinkabilty though it ends up being an OK quaff."
"D: Easy drinker, good for the style. I would like to try this on Tap/Cask."
"Sessionable all night, too bad I only bought a single."
"An incredibly silky feel. This beer is bursting with character, like it has a story to tell."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. and tasty. definitely a bit of an american slant to it, but it's a pretty good shot at the style."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not too bad, more of an ESB I think than a straight bitter but a drinkable beer."
"Poured a very murky amber color with a huge head! I poured timidly and got almost four fingers. Smell is kinda stinky... really grassy, or more like some kind of growing plants...not really grass or flowers...or herbs. Very different smell to me. I read the style info on this site to help me understand, but doesn't really explain it to me. With every sip, I enjoy it more. Kinda reminds me of earthy roots... Yeah, I'm not a big radish fan, but it reminds me of some roots. Very interesting. The mouthfeel is very nice...not as carbonated as the appearance portrayed. Drinkability is decent...I wish I knew exactly what this taste was."
"D: Easily drinkable. Could be a bit better blended flavor and better balance, but still a good beer."
"Overall, a pretty easy drinking beer with a great mouthfeel. Flavor has a few attributes that could be cleaned up, but nice to see another option in this style. Will try it again if I happen to come across in the future."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, while this might not be one of the best beers in the style, it's still comparable to the best. It's very solid and is worth drinking for a long time."
"The mouthfeel seems pretty full bodied with a low to medium amount of carbonation, it's really smooth and excellent drinkability. This beer would really shine on cask."
"D - If I lived in Oklahoma this would be a beer that would pretty much always be in my fridge its a good everyday type of drinking beer with a reasonable abv and good taste its worth picking up a sixer to have around"
"Looking at the later reviews, this might have been a bad batch."
"This ain't half bad for an Oklahoma beer!"
"I'd love to have this on tap at McNellies."
"Overall, a decent ale. It's quite a bit different than most of the bitters I've had in England, but nonetheless it's a decent, flavorful pint."
"The flavor was great and had a smoothness to which I'm unaccustomed. Will look for this again to see if the carbonation problem is a chronic one."
"Highly recommend this beer. So proud of all of the excellent Okie beers I've had lately."
"An exceptional ale from Marshall Brewing Co!!"
"Pours a hazy golden brown color with a large off-white head. The aroma is very nice with grassy hop smells as well as some malt. The flavor is malty sweetness with toffee and biscuit malt. There is a nice amount of hop bitterness to balance things out and you also get some spiciness towards the end. Thin-medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Thanks again BlueOkie!"
"D- I wonder if there was something off with the batch and the cider. Once this went away this was an outstanding bitter that I would definitely have a few pints of."
"Served in a standard pint glass with a full off-white head that dissipated fairly soon thereafter. Appearance was off-white to sallow and completely opaque. Asked the barserver if it was always this cloudy and was told it must be the bottom of the barrel where the alcohol is higher and other stuff. Made perfect sense to me? Smell was average and beery with nothing distinctive. Taste was flat and thin with a hint of toffee. Finish was acidic with only a slight floral bitterness. An average brew that I wouldn't care to try again unless it was from a newly tapped keg and wasn't overly cloudy. Hopefully that was the reason for the unremarkable taste."
"Conclusion: Nice English Bitter if nothing extraordinary...really glad I got to try this as it's one of my favorite styles and not one we see a lot of in the States."
"Alcohol is pretty negligible. Feel, more then the actual flavor is what sells it. A quencher with quite decent flavor too. :)"
"Drinkability: excellent session beer. I would drink this again."
"M- This was quite the suprise beer for me to drink. It is quite smooth and actually makes you want to drink more of it after the bottle is gone. I could make this a everyday drinker if it was readily available to me. Kind of sad that this beer isn't."
"Pours a nice cloudy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger foamy white head, with some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, spicy, with some caramel. The taste is bitter, slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note, got some spice in there, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it, thanks Lane."
"received this in trade from Stephens101 I believe. Shared with some of the regulars at the Brick Store Pub. This is a very nice English Bitter. It surely would have been nice if Marshall Brewing Company had been open when I lived in Tulsa a while ago. Very well done beer. Pours a somewhat hazy amber with a decent head that sticks around for a bit. Smells somewhat light and yeasty, but with a nice, dry, biscuity smell in the background. Tastes very clean and restrained with good, typical English malt notes. Slightly biscuity, soft and with a subtle earthy bitterness. Soft on the palate up front, but with just enough dry bitterness to give it some snap at the end. Really a very well made beer. Nice to try something so well made from Oklahoma."
"[good]"
"Very, very impressed with this beer, especially as I'd never heard of the brewer before we cracked this bottle. A top tier bitter with an impressive hop profile and super high drinkability."
"Drank like mother's milk; highly recommended if you come across it!"
"The bottle version is great. On cask this is exceptional. As good as good as any of the great cask beers I have had in Scotland. This should be on cask at every bar possible. Highly recommended on cask or bottle."
"Marshall is kicking ass with the cask ales, definitely! Thank you, Eric & Company."
"nice melding of earthy hops and caramel/toffee flavors. reminds one of fuller's esb, which is certainly a compliment."
"McNellie's Pub Ale went down too fast and easily. I'd love to have a few glasses of this on tap. This was easily my favorite Marshall beer of three I tried (also had the IPA and wheat)."
"D - Very drinkable. Only 5% abv and a very pleasant tasting - complex but not overbearing. I'd love to try this on tap or cask."
"Notes: This was an extra from beertracker - thanks!"
"Drinkability: A well-made and extremely sessionable brew at 5.0%, this one was quite a pleasant surprise. I'd love to try this one on cask, too - seems that cask ale was sort of made for this kind of brew. Many thanks to thehand for this tasty, pleasant, and very quaffable brew."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"If you are in the Tulsa area and are able to try this beer, I highly recommend you do. It is completely different than the kegged and bottled versions."
"Someone what spicy, but went well with spciy pickles. Somewhat bitter as well, but a nice experience with adequate carbonation."
"Poured from wax-dipped 22oz bottle into pint glass. Clear medium golden amber color with 1"" off white head, some big bubbles on top, settles fast, leaving a thin film, some spotty lacing. Aroma is clean, light earthy hops, light toasted malt, which follows through to the taste. Nicely balanced. Medium-light bodied, little bit of lingering earthiness on the finish. Nice and easy drinking, super sessionable."
"Sampled from draft at McNellies, Tulsa, at the brewery and in bottle. Pours copper-amber with a faint haze. Creamy head and nice lacing. Its aroma is quite spicy with floral and dark fruit notes. Pleasant bitterness with a zesty hop bite. Bread and caramel malt backbone with some of the typical fruity English yeast esters. A well-done special bitter not experienced often outside the UK."
"I recently read where McNellies actually loses money by serving this beer, and that is a sad state of affairs, so if you're ever at McNellies in Tulsa or OKC, have a couple of these and support cask beer in Oklahoma."
