"This bitter pours a some what hazy pale or dull orange, little or no head to speak of. Scent is yeasty and musty, a bit floral, lemony. Taste is more malty than yeasty but with same mustiness, and thats not a bad thing. Taste has some caramel notes in there as well. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Overall, a decent bitter. This beer needs to warm a bit."

"D - Very, very easy to drink. Not overpowering and I cannot believe ANY beer can taste this good at this ABV."
"I've got Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale just waiting for me in the fridge. Can't wait for the next one."
"D - Is very drinkable, good starter beer to ween your friends off of the mass market beers."
"A pleasant, easy drinking beer. Sam Smith certainly brews a solid beer, no matter what the style."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a simple carbonation. The finish has a slightly thick feel to it kind of like the aftertaste of syrup. No sign of any booziness. I know that the style is easy going but I find myself bored after half a glass. I guess session beers like this are somewhat lost on hop heads like me. A good brew but I wouldn't waste more time on it. Life is to short to drink simple, just ok beer."
"Pours a clear honey color with a fizzy white head. Little bits of lacing here and there but not much. There's is lots of earth tones in the nose. Picking up dirt, grass, hay, wheat. There is also a nice sweet honey smell that finishes with a lemon scent. The taste is of sweet honey and rough grains. It has a pleasant bitter finish. Mouthfeel medium body with clean carbonation. Nice and crisp. I can't believe I hadn't tried this beer sooner. I loved it. This might be a new regular for me."
"Drinkability: drinkable but probably better paired with a steak dinner."
"simple, earthy. low abv brew"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Light, clear amber yellow. Smell light and malty sweetness. Some dry hop crispness. Taste is light with faint malts and and a nice balance between the sweet malts and the light hop dryness in the finish. Good session beer though not much going on."
"Quite drinkable but on the mundane side, especially for a Samuel Smith brew."
"D: At a 3.8 abv with that complex and full of a flavor, I think this is an excellent session beer...It paired amazingly with a Japanese style paella, harmonizing with the salty sea weed flavors of the dish and refreshing my palate after every drink."
"Drinkability - This is really a pretty good brew in my opinion. It's different from most. I like the change of pace, however I don't think I could make an evening of it."
"-Cheers"
"Nice low ABV brew looks like a good candidate for lunch, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a nice molasses smell with hints of cinnamon. Pouring into a pint I get a nice cloudy brownish yellow with a creamy off white head. Taste is much like that to be expected for an English ale. Sweet malts well balanced with a lightly bitter hoppiness. The mouthfeel is spot on, however not super robust but for the ABV that should be expected. The aftertaste is delightful with a fading bitter sweetness that encourages another sip. This is the king of session brews by far. Drinkability with this ABV is off the scale."
"Slainte."
"A decent brew, Def. not the class of the Sam Smith brewery."
"This was a nice casual drinking experience. This beer is very PC. It would be hard to find this offensive."
"smells ciderish, light opaque, sharp golden enjoyable color. Butter malt fruit hop mix that fades through as the malt pass, pleasant aftertaste. mild hop bitterness, overall good, just a bit surprised that its only 3.8 in alcohol."
"The taste is very creamy and has that very nice antique toffee flavor, a touch of diacetyl in there as well. The sweetish malts really come through and there is just a touch of leafy hop to dry things up a bit. The caramel and toffee with some drying leafy hop really defines the beer. There could be some other floral, buttery hints in there too, but the medium body, creamy texture, and the aforementioned characteristics define this beer. It is quite nice. L'Chaim."
"Goes down pretty easily with a good flavor. Not a bad brew."
"Nice beer. Very interested in trying rest of the line. Organic!"
"Deployed bottle into a pint glass ""borrowed"" form the White Lion (Covent Garden - London)...fruity nose, penny-meets old Broncos orange jersey color...smooth feel, Bitter got better with a little warm'in (50F+)...Smith's is pricey but consistent...recommended."
"D: This seems to be a good diner beer. One could have several throughout the meal and be very satisfied."
"It was very good between 45 and 55 degrees."
"Overall: I had mixed emotions when I saw this beer. I first drank Tadcaster Bitter from the Handpump in Cask Conditioned format at the General Elliott in Leeds in 1987 – as it happened, weeks before it was withdrawn from that format. Now it is only sold in its Brewery Conditioned (Keg) format. Having had both, I much preferred the softer feel this had on Cask, obviously. But the fact that Sam’s don’t add any nasty headache inducing adjuncts, does make this a decent enough Keg beer though, and it’s a pretty drinkable Bitter."
