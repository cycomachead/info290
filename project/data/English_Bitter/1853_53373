3.78,8,3.75,3.25,4,4.25,3.75,"Pours a rich and deep golden color with a creamy foam topping and plenty of lacing. Aroma of doughy malts and lightly citrusy hops. In the taste, a firm malt foundation with earthy, rooty hop character. Firmly bitter, this fits the style quite nicely. The body is light, smooth, and gently carbonated. Refreshing and bitter. Overall, this was a really good ""real ale"".","Stinkypuss","Dec 16, 2013"

3.8,8.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The one slight complaint I would have would be that I felt the beer was overly carbonated. I like a little less for an ESB whereas I felt like this was carbonated like a summer pils or the like.","fishacura","Mar 18, 2011"
3.85,10,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I liked this one enough to have a couple pints of it. It's nice to find a tasty craft brew that is under 5% ABV, and a cask that is treated well is always a treat.","Hojaminbag","Jan 06, 2011"
4.18,19.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I enjoyed this one, finding that each sip followed naturally from the other. I certainly would be willing to have this one again. My overall impression is of a well made, thoroughly enjoyable beer that is well worth drinking.","drtth","Dec 21, 2010"
4.03,15.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: All round great session beer with a nice flavor and ease of drinkability.","scottbrew4u","Dec 12, 2010"
3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This was another pleasant enough quaff that I found on the hand pumps here at Sly Fox. This Bitter had some bite but was still mostly well balanced and the easy feel from the cask and lower ABV kept this drinking nicely. Sessionable little brew here.","Kegatron","Sep 09, 2010"
3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I have not seen Sly Fox Chester County Bitter before, but since it was offered on cask at Local 44, I thought that I would give it a try since the beers they present on hand pumps are always well done. This is a beer that had a good bit of dry hopping either in fermentation or on cask, that really adds a nice woody, fresh hop aroma and flavor. The malt adds a bready character that helps ground the beer and provided the body that a smaller hopped beer requires.","Soonami","Sep 07, 2010"
3.86,10.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Drinability is off the charts... A great tasting ESB that is sub 5% ABV... I could drink this all night long...","philbe311","Feb 11, 2010"
3.6,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D. This is a good easy drinker that won't challenge your taste buds. Good preparation for my most anticipated firkin beer of the night: DFH's 75 min.","BeerAndBourbon","Feb 04, 2010"
3.65,4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Had a glass on cask at Tap and Table. I always like a good bitter, but the red color is a little dark for a bitter. The flavor is dominated by crystal malts (there's the color). Really, the beer just tasted like a lighter amber/red ale on cask. That's not all bad, there was a please citrus hop note in addition to the caramelized malt, but I'd hope for more depth.","tempest","Dec 06, 2009"
3.48,-0.6,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"It's ok for an American version of the style. But American craft brewers are showing they don't do subtlety real well. Right now the English are kicking our asses in the bitter category.","TheycallmeTim","Dec 05, 2009"
3.38,-3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cask at Cole's cask festival. A fine bitter although a sour finish. Pros were the understated bitterness, and full mouthfeel. A faint Caesar crown an apple juice colour. Is it infection? Sourness does spoil getting it spot in, still a drinkable one.","Sammy","Nov 08, 2009"
4.57,30.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I will definitely look for more from Sly Fox.","TeddyBrew","Nov 07, 2009"
3.73,6.6,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall: one of the best american bitters I've had, but a little too much hop, particularly dry hopping. Turns a fabulous beer into a good beer by throwing balance off a bit. That said, darn tasty.","thatguy314","Oct 14, 2009"
3.97,13.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall a tasty and easily sessionable ale.","plaid75","Beers"
4.09,16.9,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Clean, crisp and extremely smooth creamy body. Very drinkable with light sweet English malts, subtle spiciness and a very crisp clean floral hop flavor. The alcohol is very well balanced, considering this beer is 7% which is very high for a traditional English real ale. The fact that this beer is that high in ABV disqualifies it as a session beer but it drinks like one and is a very complex with a lot of full flavors. The hops really come through in the finish, but not in an overpowering or bitter fashion. This beer is very well balanced and an excellent American interpretation of the classic British style. I will be drinking a lot more of it soon.","corby112","0"
