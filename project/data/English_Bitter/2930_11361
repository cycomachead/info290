Taste like golding hops on the back end. This is a malt forward beer. This is one of those beers that shows there is no reason that ales can't be as light and refreshing as lagers are. I would like to hops to be a little more pronounced.","Theheroguy","Sep 29, 2013"

There is some nice caramel, toffee, and toast notes with some light butterscotch in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation.

4.01,13,5,4,4,3.5,4,"The Crack also evidenced a minor offgassing of CO2, but nothing like the previous Dark Mild. The Glug had some cascading action, but nothing like the Dark Mild. I had best stop thinking about one vs. the other or this review will be seriously flawed. I had a mere finger of thick tawny head when I was done, like a crown atop the head of the beer. The color was a glorious deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and the BUPGOO allusion definitely applied! Nose had a grassy quality that reminded me of drying mown grass in the summertime. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a grassy hoppiness that was very tasty on the tongue. It was bitter, but not quite bitter enough for this self-avowed hophead. Finish was dry and refreshing and given its relatively low ABV, I could make an afternoon of it if I had to, but there may be better choices available.

Good cascade when you pour. Medium aromas of nut sweetness, a slight roasting, and an overall effervescence. Flavors are light, with a toffee and slight caramel sweetness, a roasted backbone, and a slight hopping that gives the beer's palate a crisp endfeel. The afteraste has a slight linger to the sweet blend of flavors, and a very slow and light drying finish.

There is an abundance of caramel malt and sugar sweet mash in the mix but really nothing extraordinary. The body runs in the thin to medium range. The taste is more sweet than anything else with the bitterness there but slightly downplayed. I could picture myself sitting in an English pub and quaffing a bunch of these.

The taste holds notes of watered-down maple syrup, watered-down coffee, watered-down cocoa, light wood, light greens, tea, nuts, and a bit of toffee.
