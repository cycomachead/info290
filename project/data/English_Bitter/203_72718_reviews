"Pleasant beer and safe bet."
""
""
"There is a toasted golden malt character in the flavor with a clean, grassy hop finish. There's nothing that makes this the cream if the crop of golden ales but it is definitely tolerable."
""
"A delicious and refreshing beer. Extremely drinkable."
""
"Perhaps a bit more hoppy than usual for style but this works to its advantage."
"Really good smell and taste, fruity and complex, very pleasant drink."

"O: Great brew.  The hops are great, overall flavor, mouth feel are nice.  Drank from a can."

"03/27/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Better than I expected. Not much head & only a hint of lacing. Nice malty flavors balanced with a hint of sweetness. Nice surprise."

"Tastes very like an adjunct lager except no dimethylsulfide. Some diacetyl would have helped. This is supposed to compete for the affections of the lager crowd – it should since it is pretty flavorless."

"Most English bitters compromise flavour (specifically, hoppiness) to ensure approachability and drinkability, but this ale shows us no sacrifice need be made! I honestly didn't expect to fall in love with Old Golden Hen as I have. Perhaps I shouldn't be so surprised given how impressed I am with Old Crafty Hen and how much I enjoy the flagship Old Speckled Hen. A great brewery."
""
"O: I'm not sure what to think about this beer. I have to wonder if it wouldn't be better if it were straight from the keg. I imagine this might be a good session beer but it needs to be fresh. Definitely hurt by the clear glass I think."

"Final Grade: 4.06, an A-. I don't drink a lot of bitters, but Old Golden Hen is easily my favourite so far. The hops are fresh and interesting; the malt backbone is light but sturdy - overall, this is just a great English-style session ale. I've always had a fondness for bitters, and even though I haven't had a new one in a while, this brew immediately reminded me why I love them so much. I could drink this all night and not get sick of it - much better than Old Speckled Hen, which is a decent session ale in its own right."
""
"Overall - For what it is, it's pretty solid. Very drinkable and pretty refreshing. Probably not something I'd pick up again but a beer worth trying."
""
"Overall, a light, but tasty brew with a low ABV; the perfect recipe for warm weather!"

"Overall: I didn’t like this beer at all, at least not out of the bottle. Too damn skunky. Note: this was part of the Hen House 4 pack that Morland sells, and the other beers in that 4 pack, Old Speckled Hen, Hens Tooth and Old Crafty Hen, which are also sold in clear bottles, tasted fine. After reading some of the other reviews of this beer, I really need to seek it out on tap, as the other reviews are completely different from my experience. Maybe my bottle was contaminated/bad?"
"notes: WHY DO BREWERS USE CLEAR BOTTLES?"
"Overall / Drinkability: A good English bitter. I wonder what this would be like on cask - probably less carbonated. Nice color, interesting aroma and taste. Pretty drinkable as well, I wouldn't mind having another."

"O: A very promising English bitter. I enjoy the great hop aromas and flavors in this beer, as well as its easy drinkability. Definitely one worth seeking out if you are a fan of classic English ales."

"A light body wants to go medium, and it's got a good level of carbonation keeping it lively, though it doesn't really translate to crispness. There's a hint of it, but it mostly goes fairly smooth."
"Rather like a well-balanced darkish IPA, floral-herbal rather than fruit enhanced. Since I am generally not a fan of fruit flavors in beer, this one stands out to me. I'd probably take it over Lagunitas IPA. Perhaps that just shows what an Anglophile I am."
""
"Overall: This was the fourth beer from a Morland ""hen house"" four-pack. Though it is fairly good, it is my least favorite. It is a refreshing beer (as the label says) and one that I might have again."
""

"Thought I would take a shot on this since it was on special for $3/pint and I'm always up for British session ales. Clear gold (aptly named) with a thin white head that nearly disappears. Oddly fruity - the mix of English yeast with Galaxy hops is certainly unique - lime stands out along with some peach and a grassy herbal note. Malt is minimal with a light graininess and a hint of corn. Just a hint of butter at the finish. Not a bad beer if you are looking for something low ABV. It was interesting to taste Galaxy hops in something besides a big, aggressive American ale."
"O: Very solid. Nice crispness & moderately complex flavors. A nice session beer with the low ABV"

"Pours a clear golden copper body with a small white head that quickly settles to a collar. Aromas are very biscuity with brighter notes of a citrus stand. Taste is lightly earthy and wet leafy, and finishes light breakfast tea dressed with a spot of lemon. Medium light body and easy drinkability make it a nice session ale whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
""
""
"I bet it still tastes fine... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light lemon peel, fluffy biscuit, light honey, light greens, and a hint of skunk (damn glass...). The taste brings in more of the same, but with a deeper vein of greens, this time closer to tobacco than anything. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an alright little bitter, but nothing all that special."
""

"Minus the skunk character, this is a great bitter. Damn clear bottles. Good herbal hop character, lightly toasted caramel malt, and nice bitter finish."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, sugar, and a slight skunky aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer but it's drinkable for what it is."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Fluffy white head, medium retention atop a very clear golden body. Go figure, its perfectly golden. Aroma is lightly hoppy with bready/biscuity malt aroma, mild sweetness, very pleasant and inviting. Taste is light caramel and light bitterness. Not a lot going on but nothing bad going on. Very easy to drink, I'm sure quite sessionable to the average English drinker."
"o - Overall a pretty average beer; just not a lot too it. Doesn't smell or taste bad, but doesn't smell or taste good either. Wouldn't seek this one out."
"O: Easy to drink with the light body and low ABV but yet still quite flavorful. Definitely a sessionable beer that reminds me of sitting in the pub in the UK after work."
"Overall, a wonderful, flavorful session beer that I could drink all day. If I could pick this up locally and it was cheaper it would be a go to beer for me. US breweries really need to take a closer look at this style."

"This beer pours a light bodied bright gold in color with a beautiful two finger, white and soapy head. The nose is light as expected. There is light slightly sweet malt and a touch of honey. The galaxy hops that the back of the bottle references are only slightly recognizable in the flavor but absent in the nose. It's mild as it should be. It is refreshing though. It's very light in body and very drinkable. If this were in six packs it would sell very well. Good ESB."
"O: This beer is easy to drink given its light body but still manages to pack in a good amount of aroma and flavors."
"Overall-Just a well done session strength bitter here, hope to see this around more since stuff this good at such a low ABV is pretty rare here in the US."

"Decidedly average - another bland golden ale from a big brewery. The diacetyl is particularly unwelcome; it spoils the drinking experience. There are faint hints of aromatic hops, but I can't say that the Galaxy really shines through. In summary, it's dull - give it a miss."

"Pint served in a footed Adnams shaker. Small head, very clear. Amber colour very much like apple juice. Hoppy citrus smell. Tasted of citrus fruits with a nice balanced bitter finish. There's more than enough to keep me interested even at a low adv. Smooth mouthfull. Overall I'd say a very good session beer."
"I'm as quick as anyone to slag off Greene King, but credit where its due: this isn't a bad beer at all."
"M&D: the flavour of hops treads lightly on a medium body, while the lively carbonation at times strikes as a bit too much to my liking, an effect retreating as the drink goes. Overall, this is an unexciting but decently-made golden ale, easy enough to drink with a moderate level of hop bitterness & taste to offer."
