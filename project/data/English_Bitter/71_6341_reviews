"A passable Brit bitter after you take into account the time it spent getting here. I’ve had it in the UK and liked it more (maybe the pub ambiance vs the sports bar vibe at Sharp Edge). Fullers doesn’t make the best brews, but they’re still OK."

"Clear amber with a slightly soapy cap, spotty lacing. Solid head retention, though it didn't start with much. Floral and earthy nose, malty aroma, quite nice. Balanced bitterness countered the malts and hop character. Medium to light bodied, low carbonation. A good pint, very balanced and drinkable."

"Was expecting better from Fullers. Still an enjoyable bitter."

"O: I could almost tell in a blind taste test that this was the Fuller's yeast... the flavors are on-point but perhaps a bit more subtle than I would have expected... I could drink a couple of these, but I'd likely opt for something with a bit more dimension"

"Overall, it is a very good English bitter, light and lean with clear hop leanings, but approachable and easily drinkable."

"Light English bitter, got it more refreshing and with higher drinkability than some similar peers, though I found it somewhat watery. Good as a session beer."

"Gets the hops across, especially for the strength. Oily body is unexpected and boosts the body in what's otherwise not gonna have much sugar in it. A very doable session bitter."

"This is a good english bitter, but not the best. It's a little safe, to be honest. It's hoppy but could be more so, a little watery. It feels nice though, and goes down smooth and refreshing. British ale is just plain good, so an average one will still be worth drinking. Smells malty and grassy, but not too strong. With the low alcohol it makes a great beer to drink tons of. Worth getting, just a little on the safe side."

"This beer got some problems: The metal hints in the bitterness, the somewhat dense minerals in the finish. Still, it is one of the best 3.5 % beers around."

"A very nice low-alcohol bitter."
""
"O: For being a beer I can pick up any day from my local grocery store this one is quite OK when compared to the alternatives. I wouldn't buy it on tap if I had the chance."

"above average beer , but far below par considering who makes it(fuller's)"

"Very light golden colour with a quickly-dissipating head. It is light bodied, as one would expect from such a low-alcohol session ale. Flavours are still fairly impressive, though - bread, grain, and floral hops with a delicate, subtle bitterness. Extremely drinkable and refreshing while still providing satisfying flavour."
"O- This beer is not the bold-flavorful ""hop forward"" beer that many of my fellow American hop heads would expect, but it is an excellent English Bitter. For a beer with such a low alcohol content, this beer still comes through beautifully with a light, easy drinking, flavorful beer. Great session beer."

"O/D - A nice bitter. I've had this on cask at the Fuller's brewery and it tasted better there, but I enjoyed the bottled version too. Great flavour for the ABV. Definitely a session beer."
"A decent bitter, though probably better on cask. Aroma is a bit weak, but the flavour is nicely rounded with a definite hint of aromatic hops (sadly lacking in many 'session' bitters). Drinkable if you don't want anything too challenging."
"Overall: Nice brew, the least hoppy of the English bitters brewed by Fullers."
"I was thirlled to find the Chiswick Bitter in the US, even if it were on nitro. I wouldn't mind doing a few pints in a session, even if it's supppose to be a shadow of itself stateside."
"As far as a session bitter goes, this wasn't bad at all. It took me about two pints of this to finally figure the brew out and train my mind not to see this as Fullers Light, but rather as its own entity. As a mild ale, Chiswick went down easy with a low ABV and decent cask ale flavor."
"Cask conditioned at the Blackbird, Earls Court, London (a Fuller's pub). Served at cellar temperature, minimal natural carbonation, low head. Golden to amber colour. Moderate citrussy aroma, hints of horse stable. Light bodied, decent bitterness. A nice little beer this one, but nothing to knock your socks off. (I admit I really wanted the ESB, but ratings are ratings!)"
"D-Given the plethora of other options, this wouldn't be on the top of my list. Still, it's a fine beer, and one worth seeking out."
"D: Solid English bitter, sessionable, could have more, but there are better representations of this style."
"D: This fits into the style well; light in flavor and easy to drink. Not overly impressive, but not bad by any means."
"My first chiswick bitter after finally working up the wontons to not go for my favourite fullers: London pride. Definitely worth the visit."
"One of the best bitters."
"Overall a light session ale. A good standard bitter."
"D - A great beer for a session - quality english bitter which is very quaffable. This fits the style well and at 3.6% I could drink this all night probably and still not be bored."
"I would not drink this again except in an emergency where I needed hops and lots thereof to survive!"
"Pours a bright, clear copper, with a sizable white head that dissipates a bit quickly and leaves virtually no lacing. Smell is quite nice, mild Goldings bitterness over light caramel and crady malts. Light tropical fruitiness and a hint of tea. Taste is weaker. Most of the bitterness is lost, and it winds up being too sweet and one dimensional. Mouthfeel is awfully watery and much too thin. Drinkability is fine, but it's not something that I feel compelled to return to. Fuller's is one of my favourite breweries, but this is quite a letdown."
"Pours a clear golden, thick white head forms and slowly settles down to a nice ring, good retention, lace spots all over. Smell is interesting, light and fruity, apricots, toasty malt, honey sweetness, lightly floral. Taste is similar, quite light but nice flavours, neat apricot fruitiness, some floral, oats/cereal toasty malt middle, hint of sweetness in the finish, no real bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. I like it but not much of a bitter. Doesn't have a kick in the finish, so comes across as a little weak."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are more or less average, but I will say this is not a typical English bitter in many respects. Too much refreshing bite and sweetness."
"It's a wonder to me how tea can remain such a popular drink in Britain given the accessibility to wonderfully crafted, delicious and satisfying low strength ales like Fuller's Chiswick. English Milds and Bitters are not always good, but when they are they're often truly phenomenal - and that's definitely the word I'd use to sum up this beer."
"My local off licence in Dublin began stocking bottles of Chiswick a while back but I avoided it because I remember trying a glass of it from cask in London and not being particularly impressed. I'm a big fan of London Pride but for some reason that half-pint of Chiso just didn't do it for me. Anyway, I now reckon it must have been a dodgy cask because the bottle I eventually decided to pick up last night was excellent. The colouring is a nice orange and more like an American pale ale than a traditional English ale. The taste is also quite different to other English ales, which I find quite malt-heavy, nor is it like a hop-heavy American ale, however - it retains its own distinctive English hoppiness which gives it a nice aroma and a really fresh aftertaste. Finally, I like the way the way its low in alcohol content but still very full bodied and flavoursome. This is a highly drinkable beer with a great hop profile and I'll definitely be trying it on cask next time I'm in London."
"What a great beer, there may be better bitters in England so this is being given the American beer drinkers bias, however definitely above average for the style."
"Extremely enjoyable. Even though I don't have much to say about it, this is the ultimate session beer."
"An easy-drinking ale with a ""Fuller's"" house character."
"on the hoppy side for an english session bitter, and could use a touch more malt or fruity character. but tasty, and i can't help but wonder how this is like on cask. interesting that the score is so low."
"Had this one on tap at Mahars and it was poured at a very good temperature, not warm but by no means cold. The color was a medium to dark colored yellow with a very good sized white head that had very good retention and left nice chunky lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was pretty good though it was a little light, what was there was a nice fruit aroma and slight hop presence. The flavors of this brew where pretty nice, some what muted but what was there was quite tasty. The malts come out more here and the fruit flavors seem to be more citric, reminds me a little of lemons. While this brew was some what muted on both the aroma and taste fronts it goes down very easy and the flavors that are there seem to work, a very good session brew. I hope that Mahar's might be able to get this on cask sometime as they do bring in some very nice things in that format."
"Experiences like this disillusion me."
"Excellent lighter ABV for those who like a tasty session beer without having to worry about the alcohol hit. Wish I could get it locally as an option."
"A bit less than medium mouthfeel."
"This beer pales in comparison to London Pride. I managed to finish my pint, but I wouldn't bother ordering another one.. ever."
"Fullers Chisick Bitter is a great session bitter, the apperence is of dark blond and the smell a nice hoppy aroma and the taste nice and bitter with a full burst of hops. A great beer to keep drinking all night long and is up there with youngs bitter."
"The mouth feel is a bit thin, which makes it okay. The beer is incredibly drinkable, like many bitters."
"Overall - A very good bitter.... Very drinkable... recommended..."
"M&D: given the above-average flavour, the mouthfeel is a failure here--rather unbalanced, with way too much sharp fizz at work and making the texture hyper and even slightly thin; maybe due to my long experience of drinking Chiswick on cask, I'm naturally biased in favour of the cask-conditioned version. But I sincerely think the casked Chiswick really is the ""right"" form to appreciate this hoppy and bitter classic real ale, something the bottled one could only dream of comparing with..."
"A gratifying amount of flavor and character for a session beer, and the light body and refreshing hoppy/tart edge make it a joy to drink. A classic session pint. More, please."
"It pours a nice light gold color with a typical England cask beer head (thats small and bubbly). The smell is of earthy hops and biscuits. The taste is much hoppier than I anticipated, pithy crisp and lemony, very pleasant. A solid honeyish malt background rounds up the flavor. Truly an excellent session beer. Very full flavored, yet light bodied."
"I still prefer the old style Fullers Pump-Clips that looked like Shields though!!!"
"I finally got around to trying this fine ale. It's a very clear copper color, the thin airy head leaves fine lacing. Tart hops lean a bit towards lemony. Lightish mouthfeel but it is a standard bitter,. Totally refreshing and quaffable. A worthy competitor to the king of ales, Young's Bitter. Perhaps this beer is the Prince Of Wales? Outstanding!"
"Nice colour and a good head with a subtle aroma."
"Holy moly, for a beer with 3.5%, this is quite amazing, lots of floral hops, quite light, hoppy (perhaps slightly bready, malty notes), bitter and floral, great for session drinking, very good, nice and dry  (sampled draught at the brewery and at various pubs in London)."
