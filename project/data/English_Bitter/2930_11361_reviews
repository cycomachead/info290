"The smell is pretty much all malt and in my opinion not very enticing. Exceptionally light bodied and highly drinkable, a wonderful ale. Taste like golding hops on the back end. This is a malt forward beer. This is one of those beers that shows there is no reason that ales can't be as light and refreshing as lagers are. I would like to hops to be a little more pronounced."

"Pours into a nonic a deep russet color with a thinner off white head atop,the color is quite deep for a bitter.Aromas of biscuit malt and a bit of tin,not much hop presence wich I didn't expect anyeay.Flavors of biscuit malt and a bit more cake-like sweetness,light but noticable leafy hops in the finish.It's a no frills bitter,don't look for big flavors,look for session-style and it it wins at that."

"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, not the best representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"Flavorful. Super easy drinking and fairly straightforward for a bitter no complaints."
"Overall: this is a completely decent bitter, but it doesn't reach out and grab me in any good way. Totally acceptable, but not really remarkable."

"Dark cherry beer with little head after pouring into an imperial pint. Aromas of fruit, grass and bread. Flavors of fruit, biscuit, toffee; has a leafy aftertaste. With its subdued flavor and light body, this would make a fine session beer were I ever to find myself in an English pub."
""
"Very easy to drink, light yet interesting, a solid session bitter."
"I loved this beer. Poured a nutty brown. Quite a bit of head, which settled down nicely. Taste was a bit sweet, but not cloying. A nice malty base, with a trace of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was smooth, almost like a nitro. Light carbonation. Overall, very well-balanced and pleasant. Not super complex, but tasty. I'll definitely look for it again."
""
"A lighter tasting beer than the dark color would have had you thinking going into drinking this 14.9 ounce can of Cains Finest Bitter."
"Mild, easily drinkable, and not at all bitter by modern American standards. We've all become so enamored with hop-bombs or malt-bombs that it's nice to enjoy an easy going brew like this once in a while."
"This is a sweeter beer and many may be misled by the title, but one must remember that this is a British Bitter and when the English use the term, they mean something different from when Americans use the term. The taste actually has very little bitterness and even less alcohol. Its overall flavor profile may be a letdown to some, but it is actually a decent session beer and one worth a try every now and then when you want a lighter beer that still has at least some character."
"3.5 D: Decent beer. Worth a try if you like a lighter beer from time to time."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark coppery brown amber. Half finger, fine, very light tan head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma of biscuit and light toasted malt, hint of caramel. Pleasant light flavor of caramel and toasted malt, hint of orange and toffee. Very slight bitterness. Very subdued flavor, almost too attenuated, but what flavor is here is quite pleasant. Medium bodied, better than expected. A nice low key English bitter. Glad this was in a can as the light flavors would probably have not fared as well in a bottle."

"This grew on me as it warmed, but give me something bottle conditioned or on cask, or hell even with some nitro any day, Drinks alright, but not too memorable"
"I would like this Bitter to be more bitter. Otherwise, everything about this was better than I was expecting. Would drink again but wouldn't seek out."

"Overall: A pretty decent beer. Its what you would expect from an English session brew."
"Overall not a bad brew. Structure is lacking, but flavor is decent."
""
"O - This is a pretty nice English Bitter. Nice to find a canned six pack of a sessionable English brew."
"a lucky and random find in dallas but seems like this and the dark mild are the most populate among BA. very drinkable and a great but very low bitterness of a bitter. great pour. amber with a nice head or about 1 to 2 fingers. i've found that is not consistent but its more so because of the glassware. nice thick but small head. creamy. nose is a bit subdued. first and foremost... toast. and malty hints. everything comes together in the palate as a low carbonation but actually great feel creamy malt beer that doesn't go do heavy his a hint of nobel like bittering. and a touch of apple turnover. a bit roasty. nice little treat and rather flavorful silky for the abv."
""
"Pours a light brown with a slightly patchy ivory haze. Pleasant aromas of sweet caramel malt, lightly toasted grains, toffee, and earthy hops. Taste is very similar to the nose, very drinkable overall. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a light body and good carbonation. Overall a very nice Bitter, and I love the can presentation."
""
"O- An easy drinker, but nothing too exciting which I think is expected for the style. There are a lot of more flavorful session beers I would pick over this, but it seems alright for the style."
"Drinkability: My British friend thinks it is “a crime against British beer” and “an abortion.” He suggests using it “for killing grass and weeds.” I think it is a decent, canned British beer. It is not much but it is drinkable."
"A good Bitter that happens to come in cans. The rather lackluster reviews had me a bit concerned, but I thoroughly enjoyed this ale."
"O - Not unique for any particular reason. I could do really go for a hop presence and some sweet, dark fruit caramel flavors... and maybe even a little roast. However, there's nothing offensive here. And it's charming knowing I'm drinking an old country ale, not another generic lager."
"Cains once again brews an effortless beer to drink. Very rewarding in the full flavor yet soft and elegant enough to carry and understated tone from nose to finish. Where intrigue and complexity is slight, refreshment and ease of consumption are high."
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of toasty malt with hints of toffee, and a whiff of butterscotch. It is all rather faint though. The taste is a bit more impact than the aroma. There is some nice caramel, toffee, and toast notes with some light butterscotch in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, I really like the flavor of this beer, and its refreshing quality is hard to beat. I could see myself drinking this again when In the mood for something on the lighter side. I only wish the aroma were a little more pronounced."
"Close to medium, nah, medium bodied with light carbonation, it is so smooth and easy drinking. I'm a fan."
"O: The flavor isn't too bad. Maybe a little on the grain side. Taste like very, very watered down whisky. Very drinkable. Like beer flavored water."

"O: Overall Good, but maybe not great. Still a very enjoyable, and something nice to come home to at the end of the day."
"O- Overall, pretty mediocre."
""
"This beer is a deep red color, and supports a modest creamy head of foam. It has a very mellow and pleasant aroma of sweet dark fruits, and the flavor is similar: smooth dark crystal malts blending with classic english yeast flavors of fruit. This bitter is excellent, it is smooth, flavorful and a bit lower in carbonation than your average style. A great flavorful and easy drinking ale."
""
"O - A superb beer overall. At 4% you can drink a ton of these in a day and with its flavor you won't complain. Definitely give it a try if you can find it."
"O - Cains Best was a decent selection, with no remarkably good or bad characteristics. It's an average brew, on the whole."
"It is a bit flat looking, not much head. The aoma is a little weak but improving with warmth. The taste and mouthfeel are like the flat look, but nice and bitter. Overall it's pretty drinkable but I won't go out of my way to repeat."
""
"a clear dark amber body with a thin tan cap that has a creamy texture to it. smell and taste are close to the same. nose is made up of grains and malts with a slight fruit smell in the background. taste is the same with the only difference being the bitterness, it's not overpowering, just a sharp bite on the finish. mouthfeel is thin and watery with no hop or alochol presence. overall this could have it's place on a hot day while doing yard work or fishing for some people, but not me. not much going on with this beer so i dont think i will buy another."

"Overall: Due to questions and allegations made against its character, this Cain suspended its now washed out flavor campaign. A so-so beer, but the ABV is definitely appreciated."
"Woodychandler comes through again with yet another canned beer. This guy is unstopable. Poured from a 14.9 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a very small head. Smell is mild, some grains and malts. Taste is also mild, some grains and a touch of bitterness at the finish, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I found this to be a mediocre beer."

"The Crack also evidenced a minor offgassing of CO2, but nothing like the previous Dark Mild. The Glug had some cascading action, but nothing like the Dark Mild. I had best stop thinking about one vs. the other or this review will be seriously flawed. I had a mere finger of thick tawny head when I was done, like a crown atop the head of the beer. The color was a glorious deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and the BUPGOO allusion definitely applied! Nose had a grassy quality that reminded me of drying mown grass in the summertime. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a grassy hoppiness that was very tasty on the tongue. It was bitter, but not quite bitter enough for this self-avowed hophead. Finish was dry and refreshing and given its relatively low ABV, I could make an afternoon of it if I had to, but there may be better choices available. I see that Cain's CANs three other beers and I am game if anyone wants to ship them my way (hint, hint)."
"O: A very mediocre effort. It's kind of like drinking a darker version of Boddington's Pub Ale. Extremely boring and lacking in complexity."
"O: Meh, boring."
"O: Not a caramel bomb...I approve."
"Thanks Aaron for this one!"
"Overall Impression- A very easy drinking beer, not something I would go back to though... Not enough flavor or body throughout. You could almost chug the whole pitcher of it and still want another one. Glad I was able to try this but wouldn't recommend to anyone I'm friends with... Only ""different"" thing that had at this sports bar."
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a crystal clear, hazelnut brown coloring with a low profile, tiny bubbled, dense, frothy head. Good cascade when you pour. Medium aromas of nut sweetness, a slight roasting, and an overall effervescence. Flavors are light, with a toffee and slight caramel sweetness, a roasted backbone, and a slight hopping that gives the beer's palate a crisp endfeel. The afteraste has a slight linger to the sweet blend of flavors, and a very slow and light drying finish. This beer has a very low ABV of 4%, making it extremely sessionable."
"From the can 124-08:34-4 May 12. Sampled on November 5, 2011. It pours a deep, medium dark amber with virtually no head but fine clarity. There is an abundance of caramel malt and sugar sweet mash in the mix but really nothing extraordinary. The body runs in the thin to medium range. The taste is more sweet than anything else with the bitterness there but slightly downplayed. I could picture myself sitting in an English pub and quaffing a bunch of these. A 'drowning your sorrows in your beer' kind of beer."
"To me this is an average to above average bitter compared to what is available here is the States. I like the low abv and could see myself drinking a lot of these."
"overall this is a perfect session beer at only 4% abv and a great deal of malt flavor - not watery at all"
"Lighter body with some soft carbonation. Alcohol isn't even mentioned here, making for a great session beer."
"The flavor is okay. Mostly biscuit, some hops and metal. The mouthfeel is thin but slightly ""creamy"". Just a typical session beer if you don't wanna fill up."
"I like this bitter. Maybe it's the mouthfeel and then again, maybe the fact that it's 4.2% and just as flavorful as something higher in ABV is a huge plus in my book."
"Finally found a single can o' this, so's I could try it without too much fiscal pain. It pours a clear sunset russet topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises cashews, light rye bread, grass, light wood, light biscuits, and light greens. The taste holds notes of watered-down maple syrup, watered-down coffee, watered-down cocoa, light wood, light greens, tea, nuts, and a bit of toffee. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall, a pretty solid bitter, nothing too amazing, but a true session beer (for the most part) that can easily be used as such. Not bad, really."
" Indeed a bit mild on all counts, not much complexity so it's a bit of yawn overall."
"tall can into pint glass, split with a friend...a little on the dark side, missing some of that bitter brightness. nothing too special in the nose, but it's fairly clean. taste is not bitter enough by any means. nothing objectionable here, but not much depth or pizazz. mouthfeel is fine, not too energetic, but not seriously flawed. eh, it's ok, just not spectacular."
"Overall: Wanted SO badly to like this. Their dark mild is actually pretty good, and my last trip to England has left me desperate (until I get better at homebrewing) for really tasty English-style session beers (imported or domestic). In the end, this tastes only a few shades better than the 2.5% Sainsbury's Bitter I had in Gateshead (99p for a 4pk of tall-boys). At $1.99 a can, this isn't something I see myself returning to."
"Overall: A very nice example of a Best Bitter, a style which is hard to come by in the US. I'd really like to try this beer unfiltered and cask conditioned. Do not drink this beer cold, the character of the ale really improved as my glass warmed up."
"O- A decent example of an English bitter. Overall a good session beer."
"Overall: I like this pub beer can have a lot and still drive"
"D. Alright for a one off try I suppose but don't bother having seconds. I have never really been a fan of Cains beers but, seeing as this was the only beer they has available had to try it out."
"M&D: very smooth mouthfeel and light-bodied bitterness lingers. Good backbone of dryish fruity hops. A different bitter from the usual treats of bitters from the southern counties in my local pubs."
"Overall a very nice English bitter."
"Chestnuty amber with ruby edges. Almost no head, as always with these ere' beers. Aromas are fresh floral hops and biscuity malts. The taste is hoppy, slightly bitter, and malty on the finish to smooth it all out. Mouthfeel is cask and lovely, but a bit light to my tongue, and so the drinkability does suffer a bit because of this lack of dimension. This is like a lighter version of the IPA. Not quite as good, but still bloody excellent."
"I'm really happy about the second development and split about the first. The beer is still quite bitter, but it now lacks the slap to the back of the tongue that so stunned me when I first tried it a dozen years ago. I like intense bitterness, but it's not for everybody, so I guess the decision to down the bitterness makes sense."
"Yeah, that sounds about right :)"
