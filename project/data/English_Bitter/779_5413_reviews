"Malt, caramel bread type of aroma. Medium brown body with a bit of an orange hue.. Light tan head about a half inch or so to start and settles relatively quick to a light film. Mild sweet fruit and malt taste with a touch of bitterness. Touch of apple like crispness. Has a full thick feel."
"Balanced and pleasant English Bitter with high drinkability. The warmer the better! After drinking the style often they grow on you. I hope I could get decent local offerings for the style for the right price."

"Overall - An enjoyable beer.  Haven't had many English Bitters, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.  Would have rated higher if not for the steely hop character."
"Pours a deep reddish-amber in color with a thin off-white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma is for the most part English malts with a hint of fruit. The taste is the sweet malt right up front followed by a hint of fruit and finishes with a slight bitterness, which wasn't hoppy though. Actually very tasty as I have never had this type of brew. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I liked this one and this style of brew."

"5 litre cask from brewery shop containing live yeast.  Poured amber, clear, with reasonably lasting head.  aroma:  sulphur and hop. taste:  apple, sulphur, treacle.  mouthfeel, light. overall: great character in this bitter."
"Overall, a very typical bitter. Nothing to get excited about, and probably not something I could pick out of a blind taste test against other similar bitters. However, a reasonably good beer."

"Overall: this bitter got off to a slow start for me, but I find it growing on me. A nicely quaffable beverage."

"An easy beer to drink. A classic English bitter."

"Flavor: nice balance of caramel and toasted malt flavors with peppery and earthy hop presence Overall: an excellent session ale. I could drink these all day."
"Overall - Certainly not the most exciting beer/style by today's standards, but it's something that I always appreciate and can really hit the spot given the occasion - like a half-liter with lunch for example."
"O: requisite pale ale flavors with a solid, satisfying hop bitterness.... a tasty beer and I'd like another.... doesn't quite match the magnificence of draft Broadside, but I'll take it"

"Lots of flavours for a 4.1 % beer, and good balance, too."

"D= Off the charts drinkable. One of the best pints I had in London."
""

"Pours a hazy copper with a thin tan head. Smells of brown sugar and toasted grain. Taste begins with some big tea leaf flavor, then some rye bread, and finishes with some leafy, floral hops. Mouthfeel is great. Overall an excellent bitter. Plenty of flavor but not alcohol."
"Had this bitter at the Plough in London near the British Museum. Pours a beautiful cooper color with nice white head. Some lacing in the glass. It smelled warm and toasty. It tasted so easy. Perfect for a cool fall day. It went down so easy. The perfect session beer. Tasted of a nice glass of milk. I drank 3 pints, no problems. Has to be one of the best bitters out there."

"A decent bitter, if a tad unexciting. Would be nice if the hop aroma was more prominent, but overall this is balanced and well-crafted. A easy-going ale that would be perfect for sessioning. Worth sampling if you see it."

"OVERALL: Bottle claims the Adnams brewery of the year in 2011. With offerings like this, you can see how they've earned that distinction."
""
"Overall, a good English bitter but not quite up to the Fullers level. Still, I love this style and would really like to sample this out of a cask."
"Overall this was an enjoyable beer that I enjoyed while eating my Malaysian dinner the other night. It is extremely drinkable, never boring and just a quality example of an English Bitter, one of the top ones I've had in the US for sure. It lacks the spoiled, old, oxidized flavors many English imports have which was very pleasing."
"500 ml bottle. Pours amber with a medium lasting white head. Aroma is of grassy hops, caramel malt, and ripe fruit. Body is medium and tangy. Earthy hops followed by caramel malt and some fruit on the palate. Finish is long and earthy. I can’t say I enjoyed this brew."
""
"Taste is wonderful juicy, faintly winy toast, tea, woody-toasty bitter finish after a sweeter start. It is lively and engaging, juicy and appetizing. The bitterness and sweetness are gentle and balanced, but firm and it leans slightly to the bitter side in a lean finish."
""
"A so-so bitter, not really up to the spec of a Fullers or John Smiths, with an off kilter, and overly dominant fruit nature. Good for one, I suppose, and then it's simply time for something else."

"Light body. Big malt profile. Toasted grain on the flavor with a little bit of butteryness. Hops come through flavor wise but there's not a ton of bitterness. Lots of balance. A little thin and watery but it has good flavor, a nice balance of complex malts and noble hops. Bold for a session brew but the water like body takes away from it a bit."
"Smells of buttery toasted bread with a light fig jam spread on top. The sip, however, is markedly sharp and bitter with an initial attack of strong herbal-woody and medium earthen hopping over biscuit malts with another garnish of fig jam... it is VERY much drier and bitter on the tongue than the nose had led me to expect, and I'm liking it very much. I'm not normally a big fan of diacetyl, but somehow this beer has managed to have a reasonable modicum of butter in the aroma but hardly any at all present in the flavor, which works out for the best IMO. Well worth trying, and quite sessionable."
""
"Overall better than I though. The herbal earthy grassy hops don't really turn me off, and in fact bring some interesting characters that I'm actually enjoying this beer. A nice malty balance that adds an interesting softness to it which could be the water."
"Pours a deep amber with orange hues capped with a two finger off-white head. Great retention and a noticeable amount of spider web like lacing. Pleasant aroma of apple peel, caramel, toffee notes on the nose. Apple peel, pear, a touch of almond and biscuit notes joined by caramel malt and toffee. Finishes with a restrained herbal bitterness. Slick and smooth, fairly substantial malt backbone lends to a lighter medium body with a pleasant level of carbonation. An exceptionally well-balanced, easy drinking bitter. Highly recommended."

"Medium bodied with a nice balance of grassy hops and sweet malts.  Some dry bitterness from the spicy hop character countered by caramel malt sweetness, spicy rye, toffee and hazelnut.  Not all that interesting but it's nicely balanced and easy to drink."
"Malty nose and taste: toffee and semi-sweet molasses fill the mouth with flavour, rich for a 4.1% ABV beer. Talk about easy drinking, this is a session beer with a great taste and attitude."
""
"Pretty good brew. Poured at a good temperature with a nice sized, foamy, frothy, fluffy, cream-colored head that settles after a bit and some lace. Color is a clear amber copper. Aroma is beery, malt, hop, toffee, caramel, fruit. Flavor's much like nose and bitter up front, then carbonic tang with a little malt sweet under. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, of average length and is very drinkable."
"Overall, likable for the style. Some flaws, but easy to overlook."
""
""
"This is a smooth drink, rich and lowly carbonated. More bitterness than the smell would suggest. Plenty of toasted malt, but it isn't too biscuity."
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty faint with some slight malt and fruity aromas. Taste is of malt, slight fruit, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is pretty lacking in my opinion."
"O: A tasty drinkable pint, this is a good one, haven't had a new British beer in a while and this didn't disappoint. I can only imagine it's even better on cask. A satisfying fun pint."
"The ale has an overall very approachable and masculine quality- although it's difficult to celebrate an one attribute, it's the balance that makes it so charming and comfortable."
"It's nice to come across a bitter stateside. Even better to come across one that has held up on the voyage acorss the ocean. Pleasant mix of flavors here."
""
"Overall a real mellow and chewy classic bitter that is worth seeking out."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite drinkable and I think a good example of an English bitter. I could easily see myself having another one. Like all English ales needs to warm up for a bit after coming out of the fridge before you get all the flavors and the real character of the beer."

"O: This beer is quite flavorful given its low alcohol content, which makes it rather sessionable."
"Southwold Bitter pours a deep mahogany caramel amber color with a slightly hazed appearance. Head is thick and tan full of froth, with fine even lacing. Earthy, leather notes of complexity even some fruity grape notes more concentrated raisin even, with a hop nose of earthy herbal hops. Complex enduring flavors of butterscotch, caramel, blended with earthy herbal hops dominating eachother into submission to create an exhilarating layer of balance. Which exudes the palate into wanting more and more, a very easy to consume complex low in alcohol English bitter. Mouthfeel is complex with a hint of diacetyl but doesn't knock you down, rather it balances out other aspects that the beer has to offer. Medium bodied evenly carbonated this beer I'm sure is supreme on cask. Overall a enjoyable beer that I want travel to far for since I can get right down the street."

"Strong, malty aroma has a fruity overtone, mainly pear and grape. It pours a clear, dark coppery amber bordering on mahogany with a nice light tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Malty flavor is rather bitter, but not fiercely so, with subtle notes of fruit, wood and caramel and a touch of smoke. Smooth texture has average body and a fair amount of fizz."

"Poured into an imperial nonic a clear deep copper color with a nice looking 1/2 finger white head atop that held well.Bready and toffee malt aromas,light fruity ester and hard water roud it out,there is a light whiff of leafy hops.A little light in the mouth but probably right on for the style and abv.,subtle flavors of sweetish toffee and biscuit,fruity tones,that hard water,and a little more pronounced leafy hops in the finish.It's not bad it is what it is,I could drink alot of these over a long period of time in a session."
""
"Overall: It's a very good beer in this category and a good one to drink to get introduced to bitters. However to me it just seems to be lacking a prominent second note. Beyond the bitterness there really isn't much else to it."
"This is not a bad Bitter. The abv is nice and low and drinkabilty as far as said abv goes is great. The flavours just don't mesh as well for me as I hoped."
""
"Overall: Enjoyably subtle."
"The beer pours clear and amber, the color of freshly oiled mahogany. The head is a thick lip of fine, khaki bubbles. The beer doesn't quite achieve the look of a hand-pumped pint, and the head quickly thins to a stubborn few millimeters. The aroma is freshly baked pastries laced with hop nectar. The caramel malt backbone is quite rich for the strength of the beer and holds up the hops well. The hops are rather fruity - peaches, nectarines, meyer lemons and a hint of pineapple - with touches of mineral notes. The taste is a bit sweet, and there isn't quite enough to the hops to pull it together. The caramel malt verges on sickly, medicinal sweetness, though it's certainly not a fatal flaw in my estimation. Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but it's a pale imitation of a cask. It's hardly the fault of Adnams. I'd just love to try more English ales fresh out of a cask. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and, once again, am amazed at how much flavor English brewers can pack into <5% abv beers. Of course, not having sampled the casks of England, I really have no idea how it compares to the style. Perhaps, if I was surrounded by bitters, I wouldn't praise it so highly, but that's an issue for another day."
""
"Notes: had my 1st two Adnams beers today and their is a bitterness which I find not at all pleasing. Pity as I was excited to try some new English beer."
" The taste has a more piney flavor than the aroma lets on with some gentle bitterness which has a more herbal taste w/ gentle pepper tinge and accent with more yeast which brings a light alcohol flavor and subtle mineral tinge w/ a dry finish. The overall is a highly drinkable bitter -very quaffable. I would order this again as it is pretty full of flavor for a 3.7% beer."
""
"Very session-able, a nice relaxing ale. The can bought in Sweden says 4.1% ABV."
"O: as stated above, there is nothing amazing or outstanding about this, but it is a fairly solid offering, and very representative of the style."
"O: An uneven beer. The taste is a little to mild, but nice. The aftertaste is the best I've had in a canned Bitter."
"Cheers!"
"I'm done giving this beer ""another shot""."
"In bottle, 28/5/13 - Raspberry nose, more red berry up front with woody hops and some chew. A very fruity bitter. Makes Fuggles palatable, though past date. I'll taste this fresh some day..."
"Mostly clear amber body topped with a nice head of fluffy foam that coated the glass on the way down. Smooth as silk with a nice malty character and hints of the bittering hops. Mouthfeel smooth and rich with a medium body."
"This bitter poured a very slightly hazy, deep amber color with white foam that settled flat. The smell was minimal: malt with a trace of sulfur. The taste was malty with mild hops, a hint of caramel, and a touch of sweetness and bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and a tad ""chalky", though smooth. The body was medium with very low carbonation. The finish was astringent and made my salivary glands ache. This was an OK bitter."
"Light orangey amber. Little head to speak of (it's cask afterall). Aromas of fresh citric hops and classic, buttery, british malts. Taste follows suit. Quite citrusy and hoppy for a 3.7%abv brew. Nice maltiness in the mix as well, and a killer finish that is clean as an open sky. Mouthfeel, light and easy to drink. Refreshing even. A classic session ale."
"This one I could drink all day and not feel like I was missing out on anything."
"large bottle with dating, its fresh. Tasty English style ale. Medium body and nice smooth mouthfeel. Nice and malty, bready, yeasty and fresh tasting. Moderate hop bite to add balance and complexity to this brew. Completely English in its sensibilities. Doesnt overpower the ole taste buds, as some U.S. ales can do ( I love those as well dont get me wrong...)"
"I ordered this at Eli Cannon's on 3-12-04 while waiting for a table. It was served at slightly below room temp. It was kind of dark in EC's but it appeared to be more of a yellow or light tan than amber like the other reviewers said. There was a nice foamy white head. The taste was nice with some hints of fruit and a creamy feel on the tongue. Good balance. I could drink it all night without feeling too dense."
"The beer a cloudless amber color as it sets in my mug, the head portly in size with the color a pleasing light tan and the texture creamy, lace forms a thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is all malt, sweet and pleasant with the start lightly sweet, nice malt presence and the top light in feel to the palate. Finish is devoid of carbonation as one should expect, mild hop presence, quite dry aftertaste and quite reminiscent of Caffreys and Boddingtonss Cask beers, and a nice change of pace from the hearty IPAs and dark brooding beers I have sampled of late."
"First sip reveals soft creamy texture and very faint carbonation. I get a sweet malty start which rolls over to a grassy hop finish that lingers on the roof of my mouth rather nicely. Overall the brew is mild on flavor and aroma but isnt that part of what a bitter should be? I could drink tons of these in a sitting I think. Good example of the style!"
"Real simple and straight forward. Good clean taste. Nice beer to accompany a meal."
" A nice dry, mildly hoppy ale that made you wish for more. Lucky for me I had a non-drinking driver so this was no problem. A slightly sulphuric taste in the background might put some off but this added to the long dry finish that made this a pleasure to the taste buds. Scotty, beam me back!!"
"It was and is good in the free trade in London and Essex, and delightful in a rural Adnams house in its home county of Suffolk."
"I had this in the ""Sherlock Holmes Pub"" just off Tralfager Square. They have renamed it for their establishment as ""Sherlock Holmes Fine Ale"". It pours a slightly amber color. The aroma is somewhat faint, but you get both malts and hops in it. The taste is slightly bitter at first, followed by a good maltiness. Very smooth."
"Considering the 3.8%ABV, this was very tasty, very nice hoppy flavour, and on the drier side of the scale, very nice citric hops and satisfying bitter finish, great session ale."
