"Excellent beer on a hot summer's day. Very thirst quenching."
"Could be better, though I don't want to write this one off as all-around bad. It's smooth, thirst quenching, sessionable. At times the bitter quality tastes a little too much like rocks, but on the bright side there is a respectable malt presence accompanied by a light fruity quality in the taste to round things out."

"Final Thoughts: I got this in a pack for Christmas from my brother, and sadly the best brew out of that pack was Wychwood's flagship beer Hobgoblin. This beer has put me in the position of not wanting to try any more Wychwood products, save for maybe King Goblin, since I would hope it would be similar to Hobgoblin. Apart from Hobgoblin and Fiddler's Elbow, I've been very disappointed with this brewery as of late. This stuff is average at best, and you will want to pass."

"Overall: a pretty boring English Bitter. There are some malts and a touch of hops, but there really isn't that much there. I wouldn't mind it as a sessional - I'd particularly like to try it on tap - however the price in Australia is (as usual) prohibitive."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"I like the sweet malts but could use just a little something, I suppose its a session beer and as such its decent"

"cool new beer as part of the Wychwood 4 pack. The bottle is brown not clear like the thumbnail above thank god. I like the fact it is 4.2% ABV thought the name suggests a bigger beer. the beer pours a nice autumnal gold with a slight nose. the taste is nutty and quite dry on the finish . Not a lot of complexity unlike Scarecrow or Wychcraft . the beer is certainly very drinkable but I was hoping for a little more. I did like the finish which was rounded yet autstere at the same time. pretty good offering but not my fave Wychwood beer."

"Overall: a lackluster beer that definitely doesn't live up to it's name"

"O- a pretty sound bitter, i enjoyed it and would drink it again on a warm day."

"Overall - Not at all special. Just some basic English beer. Not for your craft beer lovers or for any of the guys who like Belgian beers. Strictly English"
"Amber/orange body. Off-white head retains poorly but leaves a few rings of lace. Light toasted bread and floral aromas. Flavour shows notes of lightly toasted bread, faint whispers of sour apple, and a lingering earthy bitterness. This is pretty meek stuff. Slight metallic quality. Feels thin and watery, with low carbonation. Bland and boring."

"it ends with alot of flavor. a little watery on the end despite big chewiness in the middle. a big beer without the big booze. not a letdown. and the booze and that little. rambling now."
"I really enjoy most Wychwood beers - although this was not a bad beer, it is most likely my least liked of the wychwood beers that i have tried. It seemed to lack complexity, was somewhat light, with far less mouthfeel and head retention then most other wychwood beers."
"Im a big fan of Wychwood's beers especially Hobgoblin, so when ever I see another Wychwood beer at my commision I am always anxious to give it a try. But Goliath was dwarfed in comparrison to Hobgoblin. I pourd it into my Hobgoblin glass, and the colour was a nice orange brown colour and very clear. The head was about one finger in size and lingered on for the most part of the beers consumption, but whithered away by the end of the beer. It tasted very light and watery, kind of bitter though near the end. All and all it did what it said on the bottle it ""slayed my thirst"" and it wasn't unpleasent, it seemed as if I could drink a bunch of these and not feet too lousy. On the other hand, i am not all that impressed, its not a bad beer but there is much better from Wychwood."
"Pours a dark orange with a nice white head - brilliant retention and thickness to the head, and fantastic lace. Great look. Nose is bready, some earth notes and a hint of grass. Light hop notes and some sweetness, although something feels a bit off here (touch of skunkiness?). Taste has English malts, bread and a bit of bitterness, lightly earthy and some sweetness as per the nose. Medium light feel, slick carbonation and some residual hops and malt sweetness after each sip. A touch of butter also. Easy to drink, if not the most flavourful of beers. Could be nice on cask for some lengthier sessions."
"Another imaginative Wychwood label. This low alcohol offering has a malty sweetness with a crisp cookie bite which fights oddly with a dirty hop bitterness. Which one is David and which one is Goliath probably depends on your personal preferences. This one rests easy on the palette leaving behind a complex residue of tastes. I would drink it again but I think for me the initial sweetness is not to my taste."
"Overall – Nothing ground breaking here.. but still a very drinkable beer with a pleasant light taste. It would probably work well as a session beer - if you don't get bored with the taste after 1 bottle. I wouldn't buy it again.."
"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light dry caramel malt is somewhat bland. Taste is also dominated by light dry caramel notes without many other characteristics. Body is about average with good carbonation. Bland offering with very little floral notes or hops that are noticeable."
"Overall, more to style as the bottle would suggest as an amber ale than BAs English Pale classification. Much nicer bottle label and brown glass bottle as well perhaps hinting at a recipie change for this beer has since happened. Regardless, can't see any frequent purchases of this one aside from the DnD guys who want a change from their HobGoblins for the campaign."
"This beer came to Ontario as part of an LCBO seasonal release. Pours a golden orange colour with thick white head. Nice lacing on the glass, fairly good head retention. Smells of buscuity malt with bread and floral hops. Mild bitterness seems to come more as an aftertaste with some sweetness up front. Smooth bodied carbonation. Decent pale ale."
"This brewery has succeeded once again in crafting a pleasant but ordinary beer. If brewing awards were given out for mediocrity, Wychwood would have a tone of trophies on their shelf. Mind you, that's not to take anything away from them. Who doesn't enjoy a straightforward pint of plain, agreeable ale time to time? Many drinkers enjoy nothing more."
"Light copper, one finger of off white head, no lace to speak of. Smell is biscuity and malty, light lemony hop presence, mildly earth with some grassy overtones. Taste is mostly malty, lightly bitter up front,some biscuity caramel and toffee and citrus in the aftertaste. Mild carbonation, light to medium feel, medium body. Overall this is fairly average but inoffensive, I would drink this again if it was given to me but probably wouldn't actively seek this out."
"Not a terrible beer but pretty weak stuff. But then I didn't really expect much from this brewery based on what I have had from them in the past."
"O/D - Not a bad EPA. Could use some work to accentuate that citrus and make it better but very drinkable and not bad. It still seems pretty basic and slightly mild, but for its ABV I can enjoy it."
"This is a great light and bitter session ale in my books, though a bit lacklustre compared to other Wychwood/Marston's offerings. Too bad it's a seasonal release where I live because I'd drink it often in place of a beer like Tetley's Smooth Flow"
"O - a forgettable brew from Wychwood - a really average brew at best - would maker a laker before I pay for this one again"
"D: Fragrant, flavourful, and sessionable, the Goliath strikes me as an unorthodox English pale ale in a good way. I didn't find the offensive metallic or medicinal notes that other reviewers mentioned, so I'll chalk it up to taste and just say that I personally found Goliath well worthwhile."
"Overall, not really to my liking. Not a great example of an English pale."
"A miss for me. A brew named ""Goliath"" deserves better than the standard EPA treatment. Goliath is a name that fits other brews in the Wychwood lineup, but certainly not this one. Stick with Hobgoblin or Fiddlers."
"It's got everything going for it, except for the obvious flaw mentioned a few times already. Too bad - the booze and structure are quite appealing."
"I'd peg this more as an English Bitter, yet even still it tends to be on the underwhelming end of things. It's a fairly easy drinker but lacks balance."
"Dr: It's easy to down, but far too expensive, at least in Ireland."
"D - Very good sessionable ale this one."
"Very drinkable. Great session ale. Quite thirst quenching."
"Not the best ale in the world. Drinkable, but I've had better and other offerings from this brewery are tastier."
"More at: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours clear reddish-golden with decent off-white head. Malts in aroma, nothing special, taste - elusive fruits & malt with good bitter finish, medium carbonation. As I never liked Wychwood beers and awaited nothing of this one, I'm not disappointed. I would just drink it once in a while."
"D: A good beer, but not one I'd drink very often. I suppose the Goliath is suitable ""to slay a mighty thirst."""
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Not really a session. ABV could be lower."
"D. A nice clean drinking ale that slides down a real treat on a hot summer's day but is good all year round."
"A little bit too fizzy, but not overall a bad beer. Not quite the session beer it could be."
"D-Very drinkable, especially at 4.2%abv (that was the version I tried)"
"Good medium body, but a little too much carbonation."
"Moderately low ABV add to the great flavor of this very drinkable brew!"
"My overall impression of this beer was that it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be hoppy or malty, and failed at both. It's not by any means a terrible beer, but the flavors just couldn't decide what to do with themselves."
"This is anothe 50-50 beer from Wychwood. I am not going to rush out and buy a crate of this, but if someone offered me a pint in a pub, I'd except it."
"Goes down pretty smooth, not too filling, but definitely not light & weak. Drinkability is nice & although not really a session for me, definitely something that I would enjoy again."
"An odd one. Wychwood seems to be pulling themselves out of a clear bottle slump.... a soild session ale"
"Got this from an Englishman friend, Vinnie. Thanks man! Poured with some head and lace. Most dissipated. Deep amber color. Malty, quite dry and bitter, woody, hints of fruitiness. Carbonation tang on the tongue. Medium to full body. Very dry and bitter finish."
"660 ml clear bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 4.2%. Deep golden colour, large to moderate lasting head. Moderate but pleasant hoppy aroma (Styrian Goldings), hints of toffee. Decent hops, toffee, walnuts and some fruity sweetness in the flavour. Moderate hops in the finish, Id like some more ""bite"" there. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit thin? A drinkable beer, but not ""big"" enough in any way to deserve the name ""Goliath""."
"Alas the beer isn't as consistent and smooth as Badger's stock brew. It does taste as the nose suggests to start with but then the dried fruit tinged flavour falls through a metaphorical trap door before a little kick returns to finish things off. There is an edge of bitterness to the aftertaste which finds me wanting to quaff the beer unusually quickly. That makes it drinkable, but paradoxically I wish it were less drinkable. A 660ml bottle should last me a good hour while I'm sitting at home."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 660 ml clear glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"M&D: the aftertaste is much more pleasant than the fore-taste, which is slightly off-putting... moderately-carbonated, med.-bodied, moderately flavoured bitter with a nice spicy-bitter kickback form Styrian Goldings hops. Not the best offering from Wychwood, but the clear bottle-package hasn't lent undesirable impacts on the quality and texture of the beer, either. (P.S. I picked up this bottle literally from the bottom shelf, so it was away from direct ""light-poisoning"" anyway.)"
"Drinkability: I find that English Pale Ales each have their own personality, somewhat like the dotty characters that appear on the BBC imports; this one is certainly different and while drinkable, is not something I would seek out very often"
"Other comments: Like all the other Wychwood beers I've tried: ""all right"". They've got that whole ""mystical thing"" going on, which is kind of cute I guess. But if they put a little more of that energy into making the beer, then perhaps we'd have something more interesting. AND FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, START USING BROWN BOTTLES!!!"
"Decent maltiness with appropriate bitterness for the style. All in all would be a good brew if found on tap or anything but these vile clear glass bottles thay Wychwood always seems to use in those version found here in the states."
"The beer evacuates the 660ml clear bottle a luminous copper with the head smallish and frothy in texture, the color off-white after its rather quick demise the lace forms a thin and concealing sheet. Nose is malt with butter like aroma, caramel, crisp and clean with the start lightly sweet and the malt adequate, the top is thin. Finish is delightfully carbonated and the hops delectable in their spiciness very dry almost vinous aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, ah the delightfulness of an English Pale Ale."
"Pours deep amber in color with a foamy light tan head that slowly fades into a fluffy lace. Nose is buttery toffee and caramelvery nice but a bit subdued. Moderate in body with a rather creamy texture. Taste begins with the sweetness of English malts followed by notes of bread dough and a bit of roasted nuttiness. Bitter Nobel hops leave a slight twang in the mouth at the finish. A pretty nice brew thats British through and through."
"Hazy amber-brown in color, decent off white head, grassy and nutty aroma. starts sweet with a mild butter nutty flavor, pretty much bland, light to medium body and somewhat watery mouthfeel, not as bad as I had expected, very drinkable and non- offensive."
"I was afraid of this upon first glance of that clear bottled import. Indeed I had to practically leave the room when I popped the top on this guy. The skunk never did subside but it did diminish. The appearance was a beautiful golden hue with not too much of a head as is to be expected. It was not over-hopped (although my olefactory system was not in prime working order due to the skunk). I would like to give this fabled Ale a fair shake in England someday without the spector of sun-exposure looming over all my senses. I did enjoy the ale and polished it off in short order earning it subjective high marks for drinkability."
"I will buy this beer again. It was not great but was close to style. I may use this ale to introduce folks to other kinds of beer."
"Pours a clear tea-like color with a hint of orange and a nice dense cream-colored head that lasts for a while. The smell consists of a dry bitter aroma with some grassy notes and light hops. The taste is faint and consists of an earthy grain flavor with very mild hops and carbonation bite and is watery bitter on the tail. It has a slight complexity, but far too mild for the style. This is a very light bodied brew that has a light dry finish. Not recommended at all. This is a fine example of not judging a book by it's cover. Cheers!"
"Pours with a one-finger white head that fades to a ring and leaves some lace. Clear, golden amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is hoppy, no skunkiness; Starts with hops, finishes crisp and clean with some hoppy aftertaste but not as hoppy as some pales. $4.69 for a 660ml bottle."
"Ok, gimmicky presentation... too bad. But now I'm over it. This is a clear, amber-brown beer with a medium-sized, off-white, fairly dense head. It has a British-malty nose with sour, tangy toffee. Front is quite fruity leading through a malty, sourish middle to a nutty, bitter finish. Good, tasty, bitter, sourish, tangy."
"Overall, its a worthwhile English Ale."
"A crystal-clear copper body with brass highlights rests gently beneath a creamy half-inch of white foam that holds fairly well and leaves some thin lace. The nose delivers a nutty and delicately buttery malt with a delicate touch of yeasty sulphur and some mild, grassy and citrusy hops. It's medium-light body and fine, restrained carbonation leaves it lightly crisp on the tongue at first before warming to become softer and smooth in the swallow. Yeasty fruitiness (apple, pear, berries) appears clearly in the flavor, and combines with its buttery diacetyl and some citrusy/grassy/floral/earthy hops to lend a great deal of character to it's nutty, caramel kissed malt. A firm bitterness balances and lends an edge to the finish once the sweetness of the malt has had its time to shine. It finishes with some residual malt and a bit of earthy & leafy hops (or is coming from a combination with the slight residual sulphur?) that step aside to let the bitterness dry things out. An enjoyable session beer!"
"Eh, this was a sucky beer. I was expecting something big and strong, like Goliath. It was skunky and hoppy, two things that don't mix. It looked ok, which was it's best quality. It was a light amber color with a white head that was thick, but then died out to a laceing. Other than the looks, it had not redeaming quality. I would pass on it, unless you are looking to up your reviews."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a decent head that laces the glass. The aroma smells of yeast and carapils malts. There is not much there, but what is there smells good. The taste is really plain; a little malt flavor and light English noble hops. This seems to be the trend from this brewery. The mouthfeel is alright, although they could use to drop the CO2 pressure while priming their beers. It's a light bodied beer and one that you can drink plenty of. It's too bad their bottled in these huge goofy bottles."
"Big impressive name and bottle.... small beer. Pretty good small beer tho. Clear, amber color, lazy trickles of carb witha persistant, clingy off white head that blaketed the beer to the end. Light, typical British aroma; yeasty fruit and earthy Goldings. Smooth and creamy up front, light, session beer body with pronounced hop flavor and dryness in the finish. Drink this one relatively warm to truly appreciate. Cold, this beer has little flavor."
"Honey colored with a white creamy head. The smell was citrusy and malty with a grassy edge to it. The taste was alright - pleasantly drinkable, but nothing spectacular to set this beer apart from many other English ales I've had. The hops kick in around the middle of the flavor profile and trail off to a nice dry finish. Drinkable, but after one bottle it gets boring."
"Not as sticky and syruppy as the Circle Master, which i just recently had. Bittersweet, resiny hops, slightly bready and oily. Gimmicky bottle (a large 660ml bottle), pretty broing, and hard to finish (due to boredom). Tastes like any other mass prodeced English Bitter."
"An easy drinking ale to say the least, quick jabs of malt, hops and yeast by-products keep the palate in check. I’d definitely gauge this as a lunch time brew or something to have over a long session. Needless to say it is worth a try."
"This stuff came in a big clear 660 ml bottle, but I was surprised at the low alcohol content. Out of the bottle, it looks and smells like a dirty 40 oz. of cheap malt liquor, although it is slightly darker. Once poured, it smelled strongly of fruit, particularly pineapple. I'm really serious. Drinkable, but not very good at all."
