I looks nice and has decent body, but the aroma is horrid and the flavour also leaves much to desire. Not sure what's wrong with the smell but it is dominated completely by a harsh, sulphur-like quality. This carries through into the flavour, masking this ale's subtle malt and hop characteristics. All said, not a good drinking experience. It's a pity because I've had this before (ages ago) and liked it, so I don't know what the issue is here. Perhaps I should seek it out on cask. At any rate, I'd have to recommend avoiding this in bottles if you like beer.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 25, 2012"

This beer pours a highly fizzy, hazy straw with a MASSIVE 5 inch cap (or should I say the whole glass) of creamy white head. Splotchy, soapy lacing was left down the sides of the glass. The nose is rather generic. A bit of biscuit, some caramel and a nice yeasty twang. The flavor is simple, straightforward and much the same as the aroma. A bit of biscuit, a bit of caramel, tart yeast and just a little grassy hops. This is where my biggest issue with this beer is. Its way to carbonated. The carbonation level almost makes it astringent. Its like soaking your tongue in Sprite. Overall, this beer falls flat into the average range.

Pilsnerish, delicately leafy/floral (lettuce/dandelion) hops and a pleasant orange-and-honey, sort of biscuity malt sweetness tickle the olfactory glands. Crisply hopped with a nice, firm, citric bitterness that dominates the overall flavor, but not without letting a mild but noticeably nutty, whole-grainy malt character to shine through. Quite nicely robust and refreshing, yet light with a pithy hop finish that dries up nicely but leaves enough juicy sweetness to pull you back in for more. This is a lovely summer ale that drinks like a really very good pilsner or kölsch. Possibly a good curry beer.","soulgrowl","Apr 26, 2009"

It looked more like an American Pale than an English Bitter. Not dark enough in my opinion. The aroma is hoppy, mildly yeasty, and vaguely fruity. Again, not what I am used to in an English Bitter. The mouthfeel has reasonable carbonation and texture. The flavor was very sour and tart rather than hoppy. This seemed to have more of the properties of a Blonde.

Light bodied with light natural carbonation. Flavors, while subtle, are balanced and pleasing, and this is a very drinkable beer for sure.

Maybe the comparisons to a Pale Ale hurts a bit, but it's supposed to be a Bitter. The brew starts off with an obvious bottle-conditioned hazed, and light carbonation; trying to capture the essence of cask-conditioning. The brew could handle a bit deeper more of a golden hue, but the beer looks nice and frothy. Fresh aromas of pine and fresh-cut grass complement the medium pilsner malts nicely, offering a balance and added character above the sweetness. Fruity (pears and appricots), spicy (Fuggle Hops), and super clean flavors meld neatly. The feel is a soft, candied texture and a firm hop bite. Finishes very clean with a dry-hop linger.

I cannot quite place my finger on it, but maybe I'm starting to get this. This was good, a nice, easy to drink English Bitter that would excel in warmer weather per its name. Could pair very well with any grilled fare, some light, soft cheese, shellfish, or just a good hot sandwich. There are much tastier beers to be had, but this is a nice change of pace.

Fine English hop aroma, combined with some sweet malts, monkey fruit and apples. On the palate there's a nice, snappy bitterness here that resonates like a rubber band stretched to the near-breaking point. Toward the finish the sweetness of the malts comes out, and adds a juicy burst to things, but this beer never veers over into "sweet" territory -- it's always very dry (which would make this a great summer beer). The finish is prickly and quite dry; it's bitter in the English way, not the American way (snappy not sludgy). Very lean mouthfeel, almost ephemeral, and very drinkable. This is quite a nice bitter overall. I would absolutely order this for session drinking, summer drinking, or bar food pairing (especially fried stuff like fish and chips).

This brew was pulled to a cloudy pale yellow/golden (but not like an American macro) color with a nice frothy whipped like head that had fantastic retention and produced excellent lacing. The aromas of this brew where of a hoppy nature! Had a pine and grapefruit hop aroma that was very noticeable and then had a solid malt smell that was biscuity and buttery, a very interesting smelling brew. The taste was nice, very well balanced between the hop like tastes and malt. The hop notes tasted more floral than citrus like IMO, and the malt backbone of this brew is real nice and as I said really balances out the brew. This is a brew that I could sit around and enjoy for an evening, as it is quite refreshing, but next time I hope to experience it during the actual summer or warmer months.

The aromas are very nice. East Kent Golding hops meld with buttery, biscuity malts, reminiscent of fresh baked bread. The taste is that of a well balanced strong English bitter. A nice floral hoppiness dances with a lightly toasty maltiness to create a very, very, drinkable ale. This ale is medium bodied>light with low carbonation and an insane drinkability.

Lighter body keeps this beer drinkable. Dulled husk-like notes in the malt and a citric fruitiness from the yeast. Finishes slightly astringent, but just about enough to balance the maltiness.

3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Hazy brownish yellow with tons of papery chunks. Half inch head that's almost as firm as styrofoam. Estery cotton-candy aroma, a bit of lime. Impressive floral bittering for a wheat brew, and resulting from English hops. Malt is subtle molasses and a slight bit of banana and unsweetened clove. Light bodied and finishes on a dryish side with re-asserting bitterness. This is an interesting beer, but the flavor profile didn't quite click with me. This bottle was shipped from another store that's closed so it might be on the elderly side and the chunks were large and papery.","ADR","Beers"
2.88,-20.4,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Light and fresh on both nose and palate, wheaty, slighty fruity (banana and citrus), slight hop bitterness towards the end, and enjoyable brew, nothing exceptional about it, but quite solid.","rastaman","0"
