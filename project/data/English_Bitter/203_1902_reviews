"O: Very well done.  Loving the orchard notes, and classic style.  Bought and drank in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Drank Oct 12th, 2014."

"Food match: Tea leaves and tobacco... how to fit them in the context of food? I know - tea marinated Hainan chicken with rice and an after-dinner cigar, damn I'm good."

"O- a great example of an English bitter. Full flavored and malt forward. Is a great session beer and even better on tap when casked."
""
""

"Overall impression: A surprisingly good ale from Greene King. Not as good as Abbot Ale in my opinion but at nearly a full percent ABV less than the Abbot, Ruddles County achieves great flavor and a nimble body. Definitely a great session beer."

"Overall: a decent, if not outstanding beer, I'm going to give this one a few bonus points for its great quaffability. A bit mild for greatness, but wonderful for a session."

"O - Quite a nice bitter, not outstanding, but well executed nonetheless. It was a bargain at 1.99 euro (it was on special)."

"I liked the dryness on the mouthfeel. Also a little stickiness from the hops. I mean that in a good way. The delicious bitterness sticks with you for a while."
"sticky lingering mouth feel."
"Pours a beautiful clear, coppery dark amber with a thick, fluffy, pale beige head. Crisp aroma is strong, but rather typically malty with a hint of pear. Malty flavor has an undertone of pear and just a little bit of fruity sweetness. Smooth texture has only average body and just a teeny bit of tingle. Not great, but still palatable - give it a fair shake."

"D: highly quaffable. this is a style that i have never been too impressed with however, i am enjoying just about everything about this brew. just a perfect balance between hop and grain to make a flavorful, and very easy drinking brew."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Bitter."
"A decent bitter, better than average for sure, my father says it was much better in years gone by, my then what a beer it was then, then."
"O - A solid, sessionable ale, though I'm glad to have had it fresh. In past experiences, this beer has conveyed a slightly metallic, off putting flavor if left on the shelves too long (perhaps due to the clear bottle?)."
"Notes: WOW! This one does it for me and then some. A dry, fruity EPA with an earthy aftertaste. Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale is currently my favorite EPA but this one isn't far behind. I will buy this again (and again)."
"This is what I love about good British ales. It's flavors are full and mature but it is nonetheless a highly quaffable beer."
"O-ok, that skunk smell at first was sort of a turn off but overall it was not bad, maybe it is just a freshness issue"
"Copper in color and cloudy. Off-white head with very small bubbles that leave no lacing. Strong, toasty aroma (almost burnt) with a hint of grape. Smooth, light-medium body with low carbonation; a little thin, but not watery. Taste is sweet, but not overpowering, with caramel and malt. Aftertaste is peppery and bready and lingers pleasantly around the tonsils. Very satisfying."
"Pours a 1.5"" offwhite head. Bright clear but iced tea brown color. Smells like a wee start of skunking and not much else. Taste is very mild, actually kind of BMC, but it has an interesting persistent bitter malt after taste. Drinkable but not really a standout. And maybe if they'd give up on the clear glass bottling we'd have something else to smell besides the early road to skunking."
"Still, it was a bit mediocre. Let's call it slightly above average."
"A decent ale with a robust malty character and dry bitterness - well-rounded and balanced. However the diacetyl comes across as a flaw, albeit not an unpleasant one. This ale also lacks the depth that live conditioning would provide. Worthy but not world-class."
"O: Easy drinker and very sessionable beer. Better than I remember from years ago. I will have to see if I can find this from cask while back in England."
"Overall: Sorry, I simply find it hard to get around Ruddles County's metallurgic aspirations."
"Well the clear glass worries me a bit. Pours a fairly clear deep amber color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly to a ring. The initial aroma coming out of the first pour were skunky, luckily as the glass sat it subsided. Smells of butterscotch, caramel and toffee very sweet smelling with a little earthy mineral bitterness. Taste follows the smell fairly well, but the skunk came back. Sweet and malty with an earthy mineral edge. Moderate carbonation, medium body with a sweet bubbly mineral water mouthfeel. The mercaptan killed this one for me. Not a bad brew, but probably not something I would seek out again."
"O: Ruddles County ESB is a reasonably good example of a traditional British cask conditioned Bitter. You could certainly do better, and when presented with the opportunity, look elsewhere. In a pinch though, this will get the job done."
"Overall a decent beer, I'd try it again. Interesting style and drinkable."
"O: Not particularly enjoyable or drinkable. I finished my half-pint, but wouldn't do any more. Not recommended."
"Bitter up front, but not so assertive that it is off-putting. Bread toast, some caramel, no fruit. Wood, some raw grain, toffee, and this is all pulled together by the bitterness. Refreshing and drinkable, with medium body and appropriate carbonation. A very solid brew. Likable and drinkable and worth trying."
"D: A good beer. A not to sweet toffee tasting ale with a nice bitter bite. A real beaut in the glass, well worth a try."
"M: The mouthfeel is very creamy, malty with a vengeance. A good start, but there were other offerings that I liked better."
"This one comes in a clear bottle- which I'm not a fan of due to quick light damage, but luckily the particular beer I'm drinking is quite fresh tasting. Pours a nice chestnut color with a finely beaded head that leaves some lacing, but fades a little too quickly. Nice earthy hop smell with gentle, creamy malt and some butteriness. The taste is similar, but with somewhat more resonant hops, with a nice lingering grassy and earthy bitterness. A little bit of nuttiness on the finish, and a very smooth creamy mouthfeel. There is a trace of copper lurking there in the background as well. More complex than it seems at first flush, this ale hangs together very well. I thoroughly enjoyed this- now do something about the glass bottle."
"Dr: Expensive and good."
"Ruddles in the pint glass looks kinda like heaven. It was poured expertly and the liquid is a light shade of gold mixed in with some yellow. The head is an inch and is foamy looking and perfect. Smell is fairly common for the style, malts are up front and pale with a small citrus twist that is LIGHT. A simple nose for a simple style. On first sips or gulps rather I can tell this one is a winner and refreshing. I hope Memphis has this one come back. Taste of pale malts accented with a fairly light hopping giving off slight citrus and earthy flavor. English malts bring this back to perspective and reminds me that this is in fact English all the way. Feel is smooth and light and entirely too easy to drink. I could drinka gallon willingly. Probably my favorite bitter so far, in a style not favored by me. Excellent!!"
"O- overall I totally dug this brew. I sucked this pint down like a boss."
"Clear amber pour with a one finger head, decent retention, and great lacing. Very earthy malt nose with a touch of skunkiness. There's no sign of the skunkiness in the taste. It's very unique with a hard to describe kind of vegetable taste with a solid malty base. I'm also getting some tea, caramel and a touch of peppery bitter hops. A fruity sweetness adds nice balance to the bitterness of the hops. Slightly thick mouthfeel but extremely smooth and drinkable. Very unique and surprising!"

"Drinkability - a low abv style and a low abv beer so this beer is made for drinking in quantity. A truly lovely brew. Its one of those beers that when you open and have your first sip, you sink a little deeper in your chair and instantly feel at home."
"DELICIOUS ENGLISH BEER, GO ON GRAB A PINT!"
"I had this on cask at Fountainhead in Chicago. It had a strong toffee & caramel taste and smell, with hops deep in the background to provide some bitterness on the finish. Drinkability was off the charts, I could have put these back all day. English bitters remain some of my favorite beers, especially when they're on cask, and this one did not disappoint. Smooth, rich, buttery goodness."
"D - It's not a bad beer but I just don't enjoy it that much."
"Enjoy a full audio review of this beer on our show, On Tap: http://www.taverncast.com/shows/taverncast-on-tap-04.mp3"
"I couldn't drink more than one of these, nor would I waanr ro go back and pick up some more."
"Smooth and almost buttery, with a hint of brown sugar in the aftertaste. The hops are not very noticable, so while being a bitter, it packs no real punch. Very drinkable beer, I quite like it."
"Pours out a copper colour with a nice, thick head that lasted throughout. Very roasted smell with some butterscotch and toffee. Some bittering hops as well. Tasted decent and sweet. Some caramel and butterscotch ruled, with a bit of bittering grassy hops in the foreground. Great session beer at 4.7%, and highly drinkable."
"A crystal clear English bitter with a rich copper look that has a good head, the dry caramel taste is unique and is topped off with a nice Sharpe bitter hop flavor, which goes down smoothly, making this a very drinkable and freshen beer and gives this bitter a decent character. This is one English bitter that is worth trying either in a bottle or a can."
"Very drinkable!"
"Overall this is a pretty great beer. Hard to imagine a better example of the style. Thanks, Stu!"
"Be careful not to drink this too cold as it will stifle much of the character."
"D: a well made bitter, and worth a try. Don't be afraid of the clear bottle, this bottle has no sign of being light struck."
"Overall, the only real criticism is that, like many bottled bitters, its over carbonated for the style - perhaps more appropriate to an American style. Still, a bit of swirling in the glass to remove some of the CO2 does wonders. Otherwise, this is exactly what a traditional English bitter should be; cricket on the village green on a long summer evening in every bottle."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Rolling and active, the beer's texture is quite lively. The carbonation level begins with some muscle, then it smooths out and eases nicely right through to the finish. A nice example of a classic English Bitter, showcasing the hops and water character in a pronounced, assertive beer."
"A good,pleasant interesting ale which is certainly worth another try and I can imagine in it's day this ale would have been outstanding. I just think however, it lacks the balance of other ales brewed by the same brewery."
"The drinkability is good, I with a fount it on cask. MK"
"Overall, pretty good but I'm not generally a fan of this style so probably wouldn't have again. Definitely worth a try if English bitters are your thing though."
"This is a very traditional interpretation of the style, pretty good if you favor an English Bitter, not so good if you prefer something less traditional. The beer pours a nice amber color, clear, with a smallish creamy head, a touch of lacing. The retention is there if you pour the bottle upside down to force feed the carbonation, because on its own, this beer is pretty flat. The nose and taste are very typical, old fashioned butterscotch toffee, caramel, roasted notes. There is a particularly drying element here with a slightly pungent, almost lemony, mid section and beyond. The aftertaste is the lingering pungence, minus the better parts of this beer. I'm just not sold on the style, and the acerbic stuff in this beer doesn't do it for me."
"Pours a clear, red/amber color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale hops, slight malt, yeast, and some grain. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hops, yeast, grain, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a rather average English Bitter - nothing really stands out."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this is another one I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Bronze amber color with a soft foamy off white head. Good lacing through out. Rich malty and slight sweet grain up front. A hint of fruit in the mix that adds to the sensation on the taste buds. The mouthfeel is more enjoyable as it warms. Nice smooth as velvet taste in the finish. Balanced, filling and flavorful."
"One of my first English Bitters... bring more on...."
"On the whole a decent beer but the harshness of the flavour makes this a bit difficult to drink."
"After a rather nondescript start there is a pleasant rather herbal hoppy bite followed by a warmer, sweeter hit with pleasant vanilla notes. It seems to improve as it warms and the vanilla flavour settles on the tongue. Widely available on cask here, this is always a safe bet."
"Very drinkable beer!"
"This beer was clear and amber with a thin, fizzy beige cap of bubbles. The aroma was hoppy with notes of sulfur and grass, lemon, toasted malt. A little buttery. Bitterness was mild to moderate and the aramel sweetness was balanced nicely, having the same toasted, buttery character that was seen in the aroma. Hop flavour was more lemon and grass than sulfury. It finished with lingering bitterness as the malt faded. Moderate carbonation, medium/light bodied with a bit of dryness and a smooth, nearly coating, texture. Good stuff and an easy drinking bitter. Nothing spectacular here, but it's a solid beer."
"Not a big fan of Greene King but I admit this is better than their average offering. A good, easy-drinking bitter."
"This poured an orange amber color with a massive frothy coke float-like of a head. A few streams of light carbonation travels to the top. Aroma is of wood, apples, pear, tea and caramel. This is a very malty & doughy beer. The hop flavor is more in the background and the bitterness is light. Sweet malt and brown sugar flavor dominates. The feel medium and smooth. This is very drinkable. The general flavor reminds me of old speckled hen except this is cleaner, not skunky and doesn't have that nasty harsh ass flavor to it. Very drinkable."
"Conclusion: This is kind of muted and definitely past its prime (Friar Tuck has been horrible about keeping their English imports for a long time and not restocking lately); therefore, the flavors are kind of muted and muddled...still, not bad; I'd love to try a fresh sample."
"A decent example that loses something from being in a clear bottle. Otherwise, mildly drinkable and you could session a few of these. If it came in cans, it would be even better."
"This beer pours a ruby brown color with a minimum of head, that becomes a thin layer stretched across the top of the beer. Smells a little roasty and a little fruity with some spiciness in the background. Tastes very malty and estery, with a hoppy bitterness, but not enough to keep it from finishing rather sour. The mouthfeel is very heavy and a little fizzy, not bad. Overall, it's a very drinkable english bitter. Not really a session beer, but a special occasion beer."
"Didn't really care for this beer. It seemed like ""just another English Ale."" Nothing terrible to say, but won't be revisiting it."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees.The beer had a great frothy head that was pretty. The beer was a nice caramel color but it had a big fruity loud smell. It was very floral smelling also. The taste was a bit malty and bitter. The lacing was extremely good. The head was gone very fast. I would try this beer again in hope I could get a fresher taste."
"This was poured from 1 pt. 09.oz clear bottle with a marking of GK992791. It is mostly orange-copper in tone with a decent foamy beige head. I immediately catch a wafting aroma of malts, hops, and something slightly fruity. It is bold and full bodied on the tongue and the fine bitterness takes over the flavor. The hops are noticeable and not overzealous like in an IPA. I was impressed with this sampling."
"D- low abv and super refreshment. great session."
"The clear bottle made me a little nervous, but the beer turned out to be pretty good. I think this is a good representation of the style as well. It's a very sessionable beer, that's bitter, without packing a huge punch, which is pretty much what a bitter is. I would love to try this on cask someday. Recommended."
"Given that this is a clear bottled import, the beer may not have been at its freshest, but was still good. Quite raw in its flavour and bitterness, makes many of the Australian brewed bitters seem rather tame."
"Truly a well-balanced, easy drinking, sessionable English ale. Nice hop touch (taste more than aroma). Would love to try this one on cask."
"Overall - Apparently this beer tastes like toffee, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me. I'll pass on this one."
"Drinkability: This was my second beer during this trip to The Old Toad, with my first being Greene King Abbot Ale. While both beers were very drinkable, I actually found the Ruddles County to be a slightly better beer in terms of drinkability."
"MF&D - Medium bodied ale. I got the strong feeling on carbonation on the roof of my mouth. Very drinkable, I want more already!"
"An old school bitter ale that tastes great and has outstanding drinkability. Definately worth it's following. I'm glad that I stumbled upon it and plan on having more in the future. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability- More of the same here. I loved the canned version, and will continue my search for that. It looks like the bottle is not the way I will search for more of this. This was the last bottle at the store as well. So much for finding this one again for now."
"It has potential, I'd love to try the canned version."
"Ruddles County (once Ruddles of Rutland, but now it appears to be consolidated with other breweries from different areas) was one of the icons of the CAMRA revolution in the early seventies. I was interested to evaluate it now some twenty years since my last experience. In a clear glass bottle you can see the reasonably dark amber colour; the nose is somewhat fruity, malty; on the palate is where it counts with a very characteristic hoppy, complex, dry, quite bitter, long after taste. There are layers underneath that you don't get in an ordinary beer. Yes, you could still pick it out of a line-up, even with the diversification of bottled craft brews that has occured in recent years."
"Taste is mild bitter without real hoppiness. The hops are earthy and low aromatic. The malt is light caramellic and dextrinous. Yeast gives fruity notes. Great balance. Body is quite full for the style."
"All around not a bad beer. I have only very recently started appreciating this form and am still wht some would consider to be a newbie to the style. I very much enjoyed this beer."
"Highly drinkable, especially for the price."
"D = Highly drinkable. A good bitter at any time and sure fire bet for session drinking."
"Poured from the clear, yeah clear, 500ml bottle a clear amber brown, with a wimpy white head. Not a bad $3ish pint o brew, worth a try down the road."
"This beer was sampled from a 50 cl bottle that I bought at the local grocery store. It's a good-looking beer, rich brown-amber in color, mostly clear, and with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is great. Most notable is a generous smell of fuggles. It's like sniffing a bag of hop pellets. Behind the hops is a slight biscuit, toast, and modest malt aroma. The taste is medium-dry, with a nice balance between malt flavor and hops. Nice bitterness. There's some toffee, and a little caramel in there as well. Medium body, and medium-low carbonation. This is a nice, pleasant, flavorful drinking beer. Much better than I expected. Also, despite the clear bottle, there's little sign of age in the one I tried."
"the hops smell kind of herbal and tasted that way too. mouthfeel was thicker than i expected, but not in a particularly bad way. i seemed to perceive the alcohol more than i would have liked however. still pretty drinkable though."
"Creamy and light, and moderate bitterness. What you want in a sessionable ale. Would go nicely with lunch. Easy drinking, though not the boldest taste, and so I wouldn't seek it out on cask or in a can. Inoffensive. On tap would be the way to go. Bramling cross hops."
"Pours a strong hay amber with very lazy bubbles, taking their sweet time hitting my every constant head. Excellent retention for a canned English ale with no widget. The aroma is a very light pine and resin aroma. But overall very clean. The taste has a slight tinny malt with some rather assertive English hops in the middle of the tongue. The mouthfeel was smooth and a little little creamy thanks in part to the head. Very easy drinking beer."
"A very nice Bitter indeed.It is balanced and steady making it a very sessionable eer, should you be lucky enough to have it at your local."
"Pours from the tall green can a bright copper color with very little head. The brewers description written on the can hits it right on the nose: Robust hoppy flavor with a delicate smoothness. Admirable mouthfeel and outstanding drinkability."
"Pity about the mouthfeel, it ruined the drink for me, I will not be having a bottle again, but will try a cask pint if I see one on my travels."
"Nice session beer, but like like so many others from the UK I can't help but feel that it'd probably be a lot more enjoyable fresh. Still, it doesn't fall into any of the traps that your average imported ESB does, and for that I give it a fairly high mark."
"D: I only got one pint can in my sample pack, but I could have a few more of these and I will seek it out as a possible session beer."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber/copper color with a half-inch off white head. It mostly smells like grassy hops and bready malt, and some butterscotch too. The taste is bready malt and toffee, with a bitter hoppy finish that doesn't linger for too long. Mouthfeel is smooth, with not much carbonation and a light/medium body. Drinkability is good, it's pretty easy to drink. I could have this as an occasional session beer, I'd drink this again if I'm in the mood for an English Bitter."
"Of all the many styles of the world I'm sure these kind of English beers are absolutely among the worst affected by being put in cans. WHY? It kills the body, nulls the flavours and counters all the quintessentials of the style. The can does NO good for these kind of beers, and this is one of many I've tried lately that I could see being quite nice if it were alive, if it were fresh, if it were hand pumped from the source... but as it is here in front of me, this is nothing but sub-par. Very sub-par. A sad case."
"Overall impression: Strongly slanted towards the English hop bitterness which detracts somewhat from the overall sessionability. The haze suggests a clarity or handling problem. Not my cup of tea but nothing too offensive. Make sure you like your English hop varieties (Fuggles I think) before you sit down with a pint of this."
"Used to be one of my favorites. Still very good. First time I tasted it I had it with a couple of stouts (Youngs Double Chocolate and others) and it really kicked the other beers' asses I thought back then. Now I'm not so sure. A very loveable beer under any circumstances."
"This remarkably clear ale looks good, too, with an off-white head that leaves some lacework. Overall, Ruddles is good bitter stuff."
"Notes: Pours a copper-amber colour with a nice head. Steady retention and bubbles form around the glass. Good strong aromas of molasses, maple syrup, and hop. Taste is nice and powerful. Some fruit mixed in with some caramel. The bold bitterness of the hop kicks in a notch more in the finish and smooth out in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy. Not as good as the cask-conditioned Ruddles County, but still a great bitter ale."
"Notes: I thought it was ok overall. I'd much rather have this than alot of canned english offerings that make their way over here."
"This is a unique and drinkable cask brew."
"Super drinkable and the best beer out of a can I have tried from England yet. Mild and honest to god tasty. Superior to Boddingtons in every way. Far better than I expected, not just another mediocre English Bitter in a can."
"Overall: I first drank Ruddles County drank way back in the mid to late 80s. At that time you had to travel to the South of England to sample its delights. It was a strong Cask Ale that had a great, often legendary, following at that time. The version I just tried from the bottle is maybe a tidied variant now contract brewed by Greene King."
"D: Low alcohol and light body make this what it is designed to be - a great session beer. Very drinkable."
"Pouring lightly down the side, it's quickly evident that I'm not raising a head. I shift the glass to vertical, and dump away. I'm rewarded with a one finger head, along with a nice cascade effect (this is NOT nitro). The head quickly disperses into a nice thin layer of light tan foam, leaving thick lacing. Held up to a light, the body is a bright copper. The aroma is quite distinctive, and apparent from the moment I cracked the bottle. It has a musty, biscuity English smell to it, and a rich, potent hop presence, as well. Tasting while admittedly still too cold, I find a mild, slightly fruity, very satisfying taste. It has notes of caramel, toffee. The hops don't show too much in flavor, but they do in a slight, but growing bitterness. Not very sweet - just balanced. Medium body and low carb make it very smooth. This bitter really works for me!"
"Taste was initially a bit metallic, but that subsided quickly leaving a slightly sweet and hoppy flavor. Impressingly smooth going down for a bitter, and very easy to drink. This is a good example of an English Bitter."
"Poured a deep rust-red in a pint glass, looked really nice, except i was dissapointed in the head (1/4 inch or so) and minimal lacing. Carbonation appeared low. The smell was mild but was nice and sweet. The taste is that of malt sweetness and a welcome hops bitterness at the end, very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth, and due to the lack of carbonation it goes down well. Though i like the taste, i can see the almost syrupy sweetness of the beer becoming too much for me after a few, but a good ale none the less."
"D - high, this is a bottoms up beer, easily done in this nice pint sized (literally) bottle, great on a porch after a hot sweaty day"
"Odd shaped wide mouth 500ml clear glass bottle. Pours a medium copper with a fine rocky head and plenty of stickiness in the glass. Smell is lightly malted with hops peeking through and a mild grassy nutty touch. The taste is a pleasant blend of sweetness and hops, with the hops winning in the end. These are not citrusy hops. These are truly bitter, attacking, but not overwhelming, the taste buds in the rear of the tongue. This is a light-bodied brew, though it never tastes completely watery (again, I believe due to the hops.) This is a sessionable beer. A bit pricey for the ABV. I paid $4.00 for the bottle."
"decent drinkability. not a bad beer just not anything all that special."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and a bit under carbonated."
" This would be a great session beer to spend a day with in some ancient pub in rural England. Good if you like the style."
"This pours a hazy copper color (like the color of a new Lincoln penny) with an off white head from a 16.9 ounce clear bottle. Mild but pleasant malt aroma. Taste is more aggressively hopped than I expected (but not unbalanced). Yes, this is a very nice ale. I'm sure I will drink this again."
"A friend who's big into English beers wanted me to try this. I think I'm more of a Samuel Smith man, but this wasn't bad. It was a nice orange color with a small cream-colored head. It had a fresh, outdoors odor. The taste was mild, malty, with some hops afterwards. Fairly pleasant, quite drinkable, but it doesn't arouse any passion."
"This is a substandard bitter. It needs less butter and more hops."
"Very clear with reddish copper color. A small minus for the quick-disappearing head. Nice ale-aroma with a hint of hops.Tastes as it smells. Malt is noticeable. Maybe a bit thin but very good. Some hops in the after taste, which is nice. A distinct absence of sweetness. Pretty good stuff."
"Ho Hum..."
"Notes: just another English Bitter, not much to say about it"
"Alright, I admit it. I bought it because of the bottle. It was neat. Did not realize it was a bitter until I sipped it and ""Pop!"" Hops! Nice wallop of Christmas tree hops across the tongue. But it was wierd, the hop flavor does not linger until I ran my tongue around my mouth a bit and I find the hops oils are really stuck on the tongue. But coming through all those hops is a nice baselayer of malts that help hold this beer together. Poured a clear brown with a thick, foamy head that left stringy lace all around the edges of the glass."
"Canned sample. Light amber in colour with medium to low carbonation. Some fruity malt aromas, along with some earthy hops. There is a fair amount of bitterness to keep things in check, with some pleasent malt, dark fruit, licorice, and caramel flavors. Full mouthfeel. A solid session bitter, but lacks a bit of complexity. Could get a little boring to drink after a while."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: with good depth and nice flavour but not over the top, this beer is a medium-bodied brew full of pleasant elements of a well-balanced English premium bitter. Very quaffable and mellow..."
"A competent ale, not to blow your socks off, but worth a try."
"Odd bottle: pull-top lid and a very wide mouth. Color reddish-copper, clear, with a slight head. Light hop aroma, not really identifiable. Taste is a pleasant mixture of very lightly caramel malt and moderately bitter, grassy hops. Nice dryish finish. Body is fairly light and carbonation just on the low side of medium. A good, solid English bitter."
"I wouldn't go so far as to say that this brew is chewy, but it isn't thin or weak either. Light-medium bodied, just the right amount of carbonation, full of basic malt and hops flavor.. nicely balanced and perfect for the style. I can see myself mellowing out with a couple bottles of Ruddles County on my next day off."
"Pours a warm orange color with a generous head that takes a good bit of time to die down. The smell is weak, with no distinguished tastes jumping out. The taste itself is much like any other English Bitter, although there is a little more hops than normal. For sure, this is best served at room temperature and out of a tap."
"The head and smell of this beer were nothing special, although I'll take it over most domestic stuff. I'm a big cask ale fan and this was one I had a few times while in England on vacation. It was lighter than other bitters I had, but it went well with fish & chips and steak pie. It didn't fill me up like a few other cask ales I prefer, but quite a nice option if you're in a pub and looking for a good guest ale."
"It appears that the top does not work that well either, as the beer poured very flat. Very little head. Nice ruby red color, perfectly clear, but a bigger concern is the fact that when opened I could smell a massive hit of skunk. Clear bottle, odd seal is not a good combination for a low alcohol, fairly highly hopped ale. Nice malty flavor just barley noticeable beneath the skunk, but not a very good English mild/bitter ale."
"Small, fine bubbled, bright white head fades quickly to a film. Almost transparent, deep copper colored beer. Very inviting floral hop aroma. Hop tea flavor rides over a mildly sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but with the flavors it comes off just right. Damn tasty!"
"Decent mouthfeel, I could drink this, probably better on tap."
"Drinkability: flavor is different enough to warrant some caution, but expands nicely as it warms. Quite good but need to be in the right mood for this one."
"-Oelergud"
"500 ml oldfashioned clear milk bottle - nice design. Now available in Norway. Copper coloured, moderate head. Lovely hoppy aroma, hints of ripe fruits and caramel. Bramling Cross hops account for a distinct bitter flavour and aftertaste, quite dry - I'd like some more malts to balance the hops, but that's the style, I guess. Still, this is a nice beer - will definitely buy again."
"Never again, pretty rough stuff"
"Overall: Smooth. Smooth. Smooth. This is an incredibly drinkable English ale, loaded with flavor. An incredibly quaffable beer, though a bit pricey. Highly recommended,"
"These English pub ales are growing on me. Ruddles County does most everything right and was a pleasure to consume. I bought this on my most recent trip to Ohio; I don't believe that I've seen it around here. If I run across it locally, I'll definitely buy it again. Good stuff."
"Poured from the nitro can, this beer has a deep copper color and a nice reverse cascading effect. It forms to a quite persistent 2 finger head. Aroma is a mix of sweet malt and flowery hops. Flavor begins sligtly sweet, then becomes very pleasantly bitter... some bread notes as well a herbal and floral qualities. Mouthfeel is light and smooth... very low carbonation per the nitro widget. All in all this is a very good beer, and probably the best beer I've had from a nitro can. It *almost* made me think I was drinking a cask ale."
"Mmmm...a real nice session type brew. Excellent head covers a copper colored brew. Nose is light, but filled with a hoppy presence. Flavor is lightly sweet followed by a touch of citrus presence...earthy undertone. Mouthfeel is smooth and light..very nice. Drinkability is excellent..the light hop bitterness on the finish cleanses the palate very nicely. Easily drink 2-4 of these without a problem."
"Solid, I like this one. If the first wave of flavours had been a little more abstemious, and thus made it a little more drinkable, I would maybe even have given it a 5."
"The mouthfeel is slightly gritty and powdery, but the drinkability is great."
"Burnt orange color body with a thick and creamy looking tan head that really lasts and sticks to the glass very well. Smell was nutty and sweet with noticeable tea like aroma. Taste is robust and nicely hopped with flavors of toasted malt, caramel, licorice and some citrus notes. Bitter finish. A full bodied beer. Smooth mouthfeel though a little on the thin side."
"This was another fine English bitter. You could certainly make this a session beer."
"Greene King continues to satisfy the palate with down to earth outstanding ales."
"This came in a cool half-pint clear glass bottle, with an old-fashioned metal pull tab. The aromas were a bit skunky (damn) but the nice biscuity maltiness shined through anyway. The taste was quite malty with some nice floral hops in the middle and a lovely finish as well. The mouthfeel is grainy, creamy, and smooth, and the drinkability is great as well. Probably unreal on cask..."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has all the English ale qualities. It's bitter and creamy with a mild aroma hopping. The taste is not bad. It is bitter and creamy with a malty flavor. It finishes watery; a product I think is from the clear bottle. The mouthfeel is above average. It is a medium bodied beer with below average carbonation. This is a good drinking English ale. It has some faults, but not enough to keep me away."
"glass bottle with the pull-off foil top. poured with a thick dense white head and a orangy-amber color. very fresh flowery hop aroma, definetly an english variety, slight fruity aroma with a touch of malt...but the hops are the definte contender here. smooth clean and refreshing with a hoppy aftertaste that leads to very dry finishvery nice creamy mouthfeel and an excellent session beer. the only way to improve this would be to knock back the hops a bit and this would be outstanding."
"Pours a clear pale copper - a bit lighter than I remember proper bitters being. The head was thin and bubbly, and settled pretty quickly to just spotty film. Nice malty nose with a touch of flowery hops. The mouth is heavy and slightly carbonated. The taste is good, sweet barley malt followed by a very nice hoppy bite. The smooth bitterness lingers well into the aftertaste, just as it should. I quite like it!"
"In the aftertaste, liquorice and wood again. And hop in the back. Medium body."
"When I poured this I could barely extract a head, weird for an english ale. Then I smelled it and it seemed very hoppy. The taste left me with a grimace. Maybe this beer was slightly too old, or the container was not correct being clear and all led to a bad beer. Anyways it tasted extremely hoppy but sour at the same time. Almost like a rotten tarty fruit. Pretty dry finish. My tastebuds got more used to it the more I drank but not good at all. The bottle was the riptop was pretty cool looking though."
"Poured a deep orange with a very nice creamy head from the nitro can,aroma was faint and lightly metallic with a light herbal/grassy tone.Taste is pretty dry with a light biscuit flavor with a definant grassy hop backbone a light metallic flavor I also noticed.A definant easy drinker here not to complex but pretty good and easy to drink."
" Scent is just beautiful, malty, grassy, sweet and bitter hops and earthy. Taste is strong malt then hoppy, slighty citric, bitter and herbal, very complex but smooth and well crafted. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium bodied with just enough carbonation to produce a nice head and lightness in the mouth, holds and caresses the palate. Very drinkable, a seriously great bitter. If these weren't 3 bucks a pop, I could drink any number of them."
"ng"
"Don't know why I haven't tried this before, but it's a good representation of the style - reminds me of the bitters I had in London. Orangey color with a frothy white head. Aroma is hoppy and grassy, very clean. Flavor is sweet malt, with some hints of corn. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Subtle malty finish. Very good all around."
"A pretty good english ale, much better casked or in the bottle. I wish I could find this on regular tap, because the nitro, while smooth, kills so much of the flavor, and the beer is very delicate to begin with."
"Came in a 500 ml green can, freshness date on bottom (only 2 weeks past it). Pours out a very appealing clear amberish orange, thick creamy off-white head capping it off. Leaves some massive walls of lace in its wake. Aroma is of sweet malt, toffee, a bit nutty (if not entirely crazy!), even the scent of raisins is in there, rounded off by very floral hops. Big hop flavour all the way around, it crowds out everything else, surprising for such a mild and complex nose. A bit of raisin on the aftertaste. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, this is a real British pale ale that packs a whallop while going down easy all the same. Definitely worth going back for more."
"This brew poured a medium foamy head of fine off-white bubbles and a carbonated slightly dark amber colored body. It has a malt-hop-floral aroma with a slightly chewy hop-bread flavor that starts out smooth and ends with a lingering slight bitter aftertaste. It leave a most excellent clinging vine lacing on the side of the mug when you tip it that never disappeared and covered the entire side of the mug. One of the best lacings I have seen in a brew"
"Can. This brew poured an off-white long-lasting creamy head with fine-small sized bubbles. The lacing was excellent, but it did not last long. It had a spicy nose in my opinion. There was no carbonation present. The hue was orangish. This brew was definitely bitter tasting and it also had a lingering aftertaste to it."
"Another sample from the Ale Mary's line up (see:beerfly). Poured a deep copper/orange with a fair bit of fog and a fluffy, thick white head.The smell was average at best and not too much interesting poking out. The taste was good though with sweet citrus hops balanced with a scotchy malts flavor for an interesting blend not too often found in a bitter. It warmed me up on an all too cold spring evening and did not overwhelm me in the bitterness. Quality brew."
"Moderately dry and with a moderately long finish, this combined with a thin watery mouthfeel to help create great drinkability., To me, a mushroom and fruit burp. I like this beer, its great to have at a real pub. I really really wish Americans were into bitters like the Brits so beers like these could be more available on tap."
"Anyway, I have it in my head that this is such a fantastic beer that I am always a little let down when I taste it (maybe I am holding on too tightly to my first, wonderful memory of Ruddles). As it's available now in this country, it certainly leaves something to be desired. Those clear wide-mouth milk bottles don't do the beer any favors. And the nitro cans are a joke. An imported cask didn't rock my world either. I guess someday I will have to journey to the brewery and try it at the source. Or maybe the rumors are true and this beer has already changed and the beer I am dreaming about no longer exists."
"Premium Ale? Cloudy copper at first under a frothy cascading head. When the head settles on top the copper color clears and intensifies. Not much aroma (mild tea, sweet malt damp cellar). Amply malted and more than amply hopped with tea-like and light citrus bitterness. Some back-of-the-throat harshness (I like it!). Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkable!"
"Nothing special, perhaps I'd try this again in the bottle or on draught, but never more in the nitro can."
"Color was a dark amber brown, very thick white head about a finger high. Smells very dry right from the start with a strange musty old cloth aroma, some floral hops, sweet citrus and bitterness. Taste was very dried out and a little empty, lots of floral hopiness, and citrusy bitterness. Clean and smooth, but lacking. I know its suppose to be a bitter style, that it was, but the overall dryness in the taste and feel was a little much for me. It took a while to get use to, but once I was used to it, I liked it. Not bad, just a tad overbearing on the dryness."
"Similar in flavor to the bottled version but overall a more rounded and smoother flavor. Of the two packages I have tried, I would opt for the nitro can everytime."
"This ale poured a slightly hazy, copper color with creamy white foam characteristic of a cask pull. The foam left some lace down the glass. The smell was very modest (mild hops and some malt). The taste was not strong: malt and hops with a slight caramel sweetness and a lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean with medium body and low carbonation. The drinkability was good. A rather straightforward English bitter."
"Notes: I’ve always enjoyed the 500ml can, as it perfectly fills a pint glass, with just enough room for the proper head. This definitely is a pleasant ‘down at the pub’ ale. It has a real Old Timey thing going on. It’s unrefined, honest, and meant for a session…. I think I’ll pour me another right now."
"Nice looking brew pours out to a medium-amber color with a thick, pancaky off-white head atop microscopic bubbles, leaving good clumps of lace. Carbonation is very mild. Aroma is unique with tons of butterscotch, toffee, burnt caramel, marshmallows, and nothing else. Probably the strongest diacetyl I've smelled in a beer. Taste is pleasantly mild with a bright, fresh, and well-balanced malt body and hop zing, fading into a tolerable metallic off-note, and ending in a smooth, very dry, and supremely mild ""round"" English-hop bitterness with more butterscotch and bready, toasty malts. The aroma was a little off-putting at first, but the taste more than makes up for it. A well-done British mild."
"Odd looking clear, short fat 12 oz bottle with a pull tab. Looks like an iced tea bottle. Clear copper color. Thin rocky head, no staying power. Smell was acidic, herbal, and more than a little medicinal.(sp?) Taste was higly hopped, tart, and super bitter, just what you would expect from a bitter. Some serious earthy qualities to it. Grass, and grainy touch to the end. Not alot of malt presence. No ""biscuit like"" tastes that would make it outstanding. Thin and watery feel a bit hot on the finish justifies the lower mouthfeel. Easy to drink however, and great with a hearty meal or as marathon session beer."
"Quite nice ale whith a mediumbrown color. Not much of a head at all, I tried making a big one but wasn't able to. It has a quite hoppy smell with a very nice touch of dried prune and fig. The taste is dry, bready and bit bitter, I liked it though, easy to drink imho. :)"
"Thanks to the Coat of Arms in Portsmouth for another fine cask ale. Pale orange in color with a small head that didn't seem to last. The smell was citrus with a hint of hops. The taste starts off with malt but moves on very quickly to the hops and bitterness. The citrus taste is present throughout. I have been to London three times and this one brings me back. If we only had more pubs in the US that offered cask ales."
"Overall a nice bitter. A sorta going down to the pub with me mates to play a little snooker type bitter."
"See notes on the bottle below. I am surprised that the can tastes as good as it does. I ordered it as a substitute for the out-of-stock bottles. And it is the exact same material only with a slight harshness on the finish. The carbonation is another clear difference. Maybe the bubbles were masking the somewhat assertive hop bitterness (?). Still a ""bitter"" that lives up to its name."
"Looks good, moderate carbonation, definitely has character, and they use only the four basic ingredients of beer but it is complex tasting anyway.  But the brewer uses too many hops that just keep on going."
"I was quite surprised by two things in this beer.  One, that it wasn't skunked (clear bottle); and two, that it was so good! Clear. Very deep amber/copper - almost orange-brown in color. The head is a frothy light tan that holds quite well and leaves an exceptional lace throughout the pint. The aroma offers a light sulphur (not enough to be distracting), some grassy, earthy & citrusy (lemony) hops, and an odd - but interesting - mustiness. I'm not sure where the musty character might be coming from.... yeast? house character? And yet, the sulphur and mustiness that I would normally regard as defect seem interesting and exciting! The body is medium with a low level of carbonation that gives it a very smooth mouthfeel. The flavor offers an initial sweet maltiness ripe with caramel & toffee as well as a buttery note (diacetyl? - another normally considered defect that seems to work here), then revealing a good amount of grassy hop flavor and bitterness. The finish is dryish and lingering with a gentle matliness, and a hoppy bitterness that becomes quite lemony at points! (I'd love to know what hops they're using!) This is an excellent example of an English Best Bitter... rich, quite complex, and moderate in alcohol. At 4.7% this offers the opportunity to enjoy several in a night and yet it's full of flavor. It's somewhat rich, but not so much so that it becomes overwhelming. Massively enjoyable."
"An average English bitter, slightly perfumy hops in the aroma, generally dry, with a bitter finish, tasty, but quite thin in body, i think it would be good for session drinking, OK, but nothing insane."
"I've always been suspicious of reviews that throw around the word ""complex", but gee, this is a *complex* ale. I've only had it half a dozen times (the LCBO in Ontario has just picked it up), but it beats the heck out of the other Ruddles offerings. For a non-nitro can (or, as I like to think of it, a ""non-engineered can"") it's as fine as can be. (Get it? As ""can"" be? Chortle.)"
"I fell in love with the ale many many years ago and I am glad to have come back to it. The complexities are surreal and oddly it does not take away from it being a session brew either. A bit in the raw but that is the way I like my ale."
"There is no way this is a bitter.  I think the bitter has got to be different, maybe this is mistake on the website, because the bottle does not mention anything about being a bitter.  The back lable states"" A classic of the the English Country brewing tradtion, smooth and rewarding with a distinctive hoppy flavor.""  This is nice mellow brew, typical of a pale ale from Britian.  Nice balance of maltiness and hops, some cookielike flavor makes this very drinkable.  One of the smoothest beers I have had in a while."
"My understanding is that this beer has undergone some changes since Greene King took over the brand from the Rutland Brewery and moved the brewing site. From what I've read regarding what it once was, it sounds amazing. What I found (present tense) while having the pleasure of enjoying this on cask, was a rich, smooth malt and subtle hop flavor. A pleasure to drink...a bitter with brilliant flavor and character."
