3.27,-10.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall:  Pretty much a perfect English-style bitter, tough overcarbonated.  Less lingering bitterness than Happy Amber or Sweet Action.  I think I prefer Boston Ale, which is similar, but maltier and higher ABV.  I plan on buying this again, though it may be a while.","SaltofOH","Saturday at 07:45 PM"

Clean, satisfying malt creaminess in the lager tradition. Not earth shattering, but with the low ABV, a clean and refreshing go-to session beer.","loubar","Mar 27, 2015"

You could definitely session this, as its ABV is very low and it has just enough body to be a sustainable beverage even if you only plan to have one. It's a mixed bag, but it's definitely something to try.","SteveJeremy","Aug 11, 2014"

Really no lacing is seen to speak of. Good carbonation. The aroma has a lot going on with caramel malts, bready yeast, with a hint of citrus, maybe orange. Pretty close to the aroma actually with a hint of spice with some sourness with a slight dry finish. Medium bodied. Different than some other brews. Not bad but not my style of brew for the most part.","BeerWithMike","Aug 04, 2014"

3.7,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Being a huge fan of English Ales, I figured I would like this. I immediately loved the aroma of malt and hops. It brought back memories of drinking real English ales on a flower filled patio at a restaurant in Bermuda. The head was nice, 1/2 inch, mouthfeel good, satisfying. The taste was good but a little too heavy on the hops for me. I like my ales slightly maltier, but it is supposed to be a bitter. Will definitely come back to this one.","jrein0254","Jun 10, 2014"

Flavor-- well balanced, hops are in the background and subservient to the malt. Flavors include a peppery and earthy hop spice, a rich bready malt (again like a fresh warm muffin, or a fresh whole wheat bread). There is some caramel and just a hint of cinnamon.

3.9,6.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy copper amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, orange zest, herbal, grass, pepper, light pear/apple, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, orange zest, herbal, grass, pepper, light pear/apple, and toast/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy herbal/pepper bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, orange zest, herbal, grass, pepper, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and light-moderate yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbontion and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice English bitter style. All around good robustness and balance of malt, hop, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2014"

The sweet is aided with a smokey body throughout, balancing this ale to exceptional levels! This style ale may not be for everyone though. The sweet, smokey, and bitter characteristics drive this beer home through the finish which doesn't grab me as anything out of the ordinary from what has become more popular in the states. Only the best qualities of this beer tend to linger, leaving this as a great beer in my book!","Zachior","Apr 13, 2014"

APPEARANCE: classic amber body with steady effervescence; beautiful snow white head that creates wonderful, patterned lacing... AROMA: butterscotch, hazelnut, and light yet fragrant hops are counterbalanced by the expected English bitter malts...PALATE: active, medium bodied yet easy-drinking, as the label advertises...TASTE: bitter indeed--slightly abrasive bite tempered by unmistakable ESB maltiness--drinkable and enjoyable, but not overtly winning... OVERALL: a strong representation of the style, with the proper strength, mouthfeel and flavor to elicit a sessionable night; a second quality offering from Goose Island, after the 312 Wheat...","dacrza1","Feb 21, 2014"

It is thin yet bitter, and the taste can only be descried as unique, and perfectly balanced. Worth the money every time, and in case you were wondering, I still got an A in the class because this beer really made me relax, and open up my mind to philosophical arguments.

Another beer that I received in a store made variety pack, I figured it would be a good one to try before trying some of their seasonals. I poured the beer into a standard ale glass and the appearance was similar to Samuel Adams Boston Lager - it has a nice, amber color with a slight orange tint. The beer isn't too heavy when tasted but also doesn't lose it's taste quickly either. My overall experience with the beer was very good - it's great to have at dinner with just about anything, a BBQ, or even just while you're watching tv. Enjoy.","Eando35","Aug 05, 2013"

It pours a nice brown color with an ample head. Finger lacing lasts through the last drink and the taste is full with plentiful malt and hops flavors, which are in no way overpowering. The aroma lies somewhere between bread and walnuts with just a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel is warming without being too thick. All-in-all a very good beer.","AlfaMale","Jul 21, 2013"

Aroma of biscuit malt and light grassy hops. Flavor follows with biscuit malt and light nondescript slightly grassy hops. Mild flavored, but leaves a pleasant, lingering malty hop aftertaste. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant, but light flavored domestic take on an English bitter. Malt seems just right for the style. Moderately bland, but pleasant.","LiquidAmber","Jul 20, 2013"

For an ale, Honkers was light and easy to drink and would probably do well as a hot weather refresher if served as cold as I had mine.

4.12,12.6,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Honker's Ale is a great looking beer, it pours a lightly hazy orange with two fingers of extremely persistent head. The aroma is sweet and malty with a bit of citrus. The taste is very good and rather distinctive, it wraps bready malts, mildly fruity yeast, and citrus hops all together into a tasty bundle that clocks in at a sessionable ABV. The mouthfeel is light and delicately carbonated, and the drinkability is spot on for a bitter. Overall, Honker's Ale is a solid American twist on the traditional bitter, and one of the better choices if you're in a supermarket and looking for something sessionable.","shand","Mar 17, 2013"

There are a moderate amount of visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. Sticky lacing coats the glass as the head retreats. The beer has an aroma of biscuit, brown bread, and toffee with some grassy and fruity hops. The flavors follow the nose. There's that balanced malt profile that has the biscuit and brown bread. There's a touch of toffee sweetness and those hops are just there in the back end. The hops lend some grassy and fruity notes and the back end bitterness lingers in the mouth just every so slightly. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The beer goes down smoothly, giving this bitter a high drinkability. This is a good beer that works as a session ale.","acevenom","Mar 11, 2013"

Smell is of malt, caramel, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty beer but I think it smells better than it tastes.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 01, 2012"

Some carbonation is evident and the overall color is burnt orange. Smell is fruity with a touch of diacetyl as well as some dough and yeast. An earthy hop presence cuts through. Taste is soft and fruity with a firm earthy hops and good solid pale malt backbone. Lots of biscuit with a light caramel sweetness. Finish dry with earth and a bit of a mineral edged metallic presence and hop oiliness. Feel is a lighter medium weight with lower carbonation and a gentle overall tingleyness. Quite crisp in fact. Smooth and easy drinking. A nice English style session ale that represents the style solidly.

Gauzy orange-amber colored liquid, fades to yellow around the edges, not a lot of visible carbonation. The nose has a good deal of biscuit but more so sweeter caramel, butterscotch, candied oranges and lighter nutmeg centered spice, peach to dried apple fruit, there’s some hoppy zing present but it does not last as you really draw the scents in and breathe out. Medium-bodied, foams up too much during the mouth entry but then settles back to release substantial chocolate, caramel, toffee flavors alongside juicy orange, tangerine citrus. The peach, apricot, apple fruit keeps the mouth feel soft and round. Harder to find any meaningful hops presence here than in the nose, however, dries a touch as it ends, never quite cloyingly sweet. Lacks good posture, slouches throughout.","farrago","Aug 10, 2012"

The head is thick, fluffy and light tan, it like an open invitation to jump right into this ale. There are plenty of citrus fruit smells that com through beside the wheat and hops (wheat smell is very, very mild). It’s very light on the tongue and feels and tastes very light and mildly crisp. There are some evident hop flavors as it reaches the corners of your mouth and the back of your tongue.

Slim, filmy, off-white head that clings strongly to the walls of the glass. Aromas are subtle, with a light toffee sweetness. Flavors are light, as well, with a more roasted toffee character serving as the backbone for a light hopping and some char and pepper spicing. Smooth body with a bit of a bitter bite at the end of the palate. The aftertaste remains mild (par for the course), with a more sharp presentation of the spicing along with the subtle sugary sweetness. Smooth, clean finish that leaves the palate quickly.

The beer had a sharp amber look to it with a relatively large, frothy head. The aromas were a good mix of bready textures with some fruit hints, but was not too strong to fill your nose. There is a bittersweet flavor to the generally malty taste of the beer. Some pretty decent earthy spice to the drink, but, like the aromas, they were not too overtly strong. After a large meal, this was an excellent drink to have on a mouthfeel-level. The drink had a good carbonation, but was light on a full stomach. Overall, a pretty decent beer to have with a big dinner dinner.","fitzy84","Mar 03, 2012"

3.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Honker’s Ale, poured out with a nice thick aroma of wheat at hops, fresh hops! It’s a semi-dark amber color and is slightly hazy with little carbonation. The head is thick, fluffy and light tan, it like an open invitation to jump right into this ale. There are plenty of citrus fruit smells that com through beside the wheat and hops (wheat smell is very, very mild). It’s very light on the tongue and feels and tastes very light and mildly crisp. There are some evident hop flavors as it reaches the corners of your mouth and the back of your tongue. It does have a nice semi-tart aftertaste and no alcohol is present at any point while drinking this ale.","vickersspitfire","Sep 17, 2011"

3.75,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Malt character has a lot going on - bread, caramel, toffee with some spiciness and dark fruit. Hops are muted but earthy in nature. Taste is much more bitter than the aroma suggests and the bitterness becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Malts are consistent with the aroma but struggle against the bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied. Pleasant carbonation and the 4.2% ABV make this a classic session beer.","NeutroMan","Sep 08, 2011"

Very crisp, and not very overpowering. Easy to drink, could easily get another; good carbonation.

Flavor is similar to the nose with a large amount of toasted malt and nutty bread. The yeast and carbonation give this bold body a solid crisp feel. Fresh citrus, somewhat herbal, hops finish this off with a bitter balance over the malts. Prominent malt body and a well balanced bitter finish make this very drinkable.

This won't blow anyone away but for those looking for a mellow and bitter beer with a nice balance and a decent range of flavors, this would be a great choice. This could pack more of a punch in terms of mouthfeel, weight, and carbonation but for a warm spring night such as tonight, this fit the bill nicely.

Right off the bat there is a very nice piny hop presence which is followed by sweet caramel malts and a light soapy finish. The flavors are of light hops initially but this is a malt driven brew. It has a really nice and slightly sweet caramel malt aspect finished by faded resinous pine. It drinks very well, both smooth and crisp and has definite drinkability.

The nose comprises mild toffee, light biscuit, flowers, and a relatively wide touch of grapefruit. The taste emphasizes the flowers and grapefruit, whilst relegating the biscuit to the background and expelling the toffee pretty much entirely. A vague sweetness also bubbles up every now and again, though it never lingers for very long.

Simply put, Honker's Ale is a very solid beer in all respects. There is no one thing which is particularly great about this beer, but - as someone else noted - "some of its flaws are what make it unique."

Pours a crystal clear burnt orange with an off white head. Average sized creamy head that leaves some nice lacing. Nose is subtle citrus hops and pale malt. As the label purports the taste is nicely balanced. Typically when describing beer I use the term light in a pejorative sense but not here. Citrus hops and grains are there, they're simple but there, along with some tea leaf flavors. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is right on. Drinkability is definitely the strength of this brew, I wish I could rate it above a 5. I come from an Irish family so one can imagine the drinking that occurs when everyone gets together for Christmas. Throwing a few of these into the mix kept me fairly sober, I didn't even have a hangover the next morning. Definitely an excellent session beer.","alli4051","Jan 01, 2011"

This beer pours a nice deep copper color with a fluffy white finger of foam on the surface. The aroma isn't as much caramel as I would have assumed, in fact it smell like hops. Fresh hops are a wonderful aroma, these in particular gave off a very nice lemon citrus aroma that was both subtle and pleasant. I love how fresh the particular batch must have been. The taste of this first struck me as being very bready with some bittering hops thrown in in the background for ambiance. This was a much fuller bodied beer than I thought it would be, but the carbonation was spot on as well as the viscosity. This drank rather well, the problem is I nursed it through dinner and as it warmed it was no longer as pleasant.

This is a nicely balanced beer. Tastes of some mild tea-like pleasantness from the hops. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, as is typical for standard Goose beers. Ahh, this beer is what I imagine an authentic English bitter to be like. And it is highly drinkable, could this be the perfect session beer?","Star80","Oct 20, 2010"

I might think this is worth a notch or two higher (maybe an A-) but it doesn't quite match the complexity of some low-gravity English Pale Ales I've had, like fresh Black Sheep Special, which absolutely blew me away.

Head eventually settles into a solid, half inch cap with thick swaths of lacing revealed during the session. Nose - well, it definitely smells like a Bitter - a faint citrus quality, as well as earthy/aromatic hops, a hint of biscuit and perhaps some tea. Taste consistent with nose; however, more of the tea flavor comes out in the mouth, with a little bit of biscuit lingering between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an lively, full--bodied carbonation. Easy drinking session beer. Not a go-to style for me, but this is pretty tasty.","Jwale73","Jun 14, 2010"

3.85,5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is a bit prickly on the tongue, which is in character for the style, it is not particularly sweet and has traditional English yeast flavors. There is a saltene finish in the beer and a herbal and grain husk courseness to the beer. I like it, it is rather light, it is refreshing too. There is a bit of lemony spice in this beer but it culminates in that dry salty finish. The carbonation is quite apparent and the courseness exacerbates some of the fizziness to the beer.

4.18,14.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Reviewed from notes, two nights ago. Poured an amber-brown with a one to two finger head that has good retention. A good cloud and ring are left behind on the beer's top. Leaves a fine coat of medium lacing. The smell is slightly fruity hops and a very wheat-bready malt aspect. Caramel malts also make an appearance in a nose that is overall weak in strength. The taste is of slight fruity and earthy hops as well as some malt. The hops seem like the ones I have used for my ESB in homebrewing. There is not much hop bitterness but it is nice, and the style doesn't really call for much (misnomer). The malt backbone tastes wheaty and even corny. Malt is massive and nice. This is a good example of a style that is not produced all that much. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. The moderate carbonation suits the flavor. No warmth from alcohol. It is a tiny bit watery and a coat of light malt and fruit hops is left on the tongue. A good flavor and price with no off flavors. A nice, smooth and balanced ale. I think it is a great example of the style.","cbutova","Apr 23, 2010"

It almost has the maltiness of Boston Ale and the hoppiness and warmth of Boston Lager. It's definitely more bitter than both.

On one end there's a tasty mix of barley grain, dark bread, and wholegrain crackers, while the Styrian Golding hops present both earthy spice notes and fruity citrus rind. This brew covers a lot of different and complimentary flavors, all while keeping a light, drinkable body. This is a fantastic session beer.","tempest","Jan 26, 2010"

It's not light enough to see through it, but some light still permeates it. The smell matches the color, candied caramel apples instantly come to mind. Absolutely beautiful. It was heavier in my mouth then I thought it would be, which cuts down a bit on the drinkability, but still good for two or three pints probably. The flavor itself had such a nice balance in taste. What struck me is that nothing really stood out, but instead of being a detriment, that was an asset. Just an overall good tasting beer.

Good carbonation, an excellent standard. If I could, I would have this on hand all the time with Sam Adams lager, Fat Tire Amber, and anything from 3Floyds!

Taste is not as strong, much of the hop bitterness getting lost and a watery component coming through.

It had an amber-copper hue with a very purposeful sized white head and globby lacing a plenty. The aroma suggested a full bodied brew with some malt character and citrus and brown bread. However, I was disappointed in tasting it to find a surprisingly watery citrus/grass hop concoction lost in a somewhat sweet but wishy-washy malt. It just seemed odd that the same beer that looked and smelled good would taste so whimpy. It was not a bad beer, I could see the connection as a bitter, but it was not something I would buy again based upon this sample. Worthy of a try if you like a thin bitter that is easy drinking.

The taste is about the same. The beer is pretty light, somewhat grainy, and there are light flavors of the same earthy hops that were in the smell. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, a tad overcarbonated, and a little grainy. Eh, this is just okay. It has none of the minerally earthy restraint of a real English bitter. It tastes a little too light in flavor and is a bit one dimensional.","Georgiabeer","Jan 22, 2008"

The beer tastes the same way it smells, and finishes with a mildly sweet aftertaste, enough to make you want to drink some more quickly. Mouthfeel is light/medium, crisp, and leaves a slight coating.

The taste has some lightly toasted notes to it that remind me of a brown. Biscuity would be a word to describe it. The beer is well balanced with a clean finish that makes you want more.

Smooth medium mouthfeel. This is a session ale!! Great flavor and body, and decent abv. What else could you ask for in a brew. Highly recommended.

There's some controversy over the alcohol content of this beer -- some sources say 5 percent -- others say 4.3 percent alcohol.

In terms of flavor, however, the bitterness is actually quite mild. The Honker's Ale produces a faint, buttery aroma that comes across as a sweeter air of butterscotch when drunk, and the flavor profile is grounded in woodiness (from the casks I imagine this brew is conditioned in). Of course, hops are present, too, but not in enough force to detract from the essential sweetness of this beer.

The white head holds for a bit and releases a well-balanced aroma, seemingly right on for the style. Light in your mouth, it isn't the most complex of beers, but that is exactly what it was meant to be. This isn't the kind of beer you will really search out as unique, but if I live on the lake, then it would be a perfect staple. Three cheers Goose Island!","rokoch27","Jul 17, 2006"

It was a beautiful cloudy amber-orange color showing some of that color in the head. The taste was a slightly sweet burnt citrus flavor, and quite bitter. There was also a surgary, syrupy hint. This all made for a fairly complex flavor, and thoroughly enjoyable drinking experience. I think "balance" is a perfect term to describe it. Really hearty without being thick & heavy.

Also pick up some very faint fruit, appricot. Mouthfeel is slighly chalky at the finish. An OK offering.

It's not to balanced with hops which were heavy and kindy woody. weirdly enough they get sweeter as it warms. They were a little too much for the balance to be right.

The early gentle hop bitter fades as delicate bubble from on the flat of my tongue in a nice transition. Starts caramely sweet falling to a flat Munich/Vienna malt. Pears and perhaps some peach and apricot. This then transitions into a finely carbonated swallow. Leaves behind a dry woody aftertaste. Hopping is minimal, but some floral qualities rise up in the throat as part of the aftertaste (woody and faintly orangishGoldings?). Sweet, yet dry, with a creamy mouthfeel, despite its actual md to md-light body. Carbonation is mild to moderate and it works well with the flavors.","mentor","Apr 28, 2005"

Doesn't have that hop bitterness that a lot of pale ales have but the hops are strong. There are a lot of citrus hops in it and some spicy hops too. Sweet roasted malts and caramel malts complement the hops. Begins and finishes with some hoppiness but the middle is malty. Makes for a good mix. This beer doesn't strive for greatness it's just a quality beer that's well balanced.","granger10","Aug 06, 2003"

The carbonation is heavy, and the beer isn't quite as smooth as it might be, given that it doesn't have an overwhelming character in any particular direction. However, the overall balance of the beer is very drinkable, and certainly worth a purchase if you find some.","Kongquistador","Aug 04, 2003"

The smell is a nice mix of honey and hops. A fairly sweet smell, pretty pleasant. The taste is fairly sweet with honey and a hint of caramel and pine. There is a nice crisp, fairly hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light, but it is very smooth, and one of the most drinkable brews I've ever had. A favorite session beer of mine, and even better on tap.","SheepNutz","Aug 04, 2003"

In the taste, fruity esters and caramel are in the fore front rather than hoppiness...which to me seems more bitter-ish. It pours a bright orange amber with a scant white head, no lace. Some non-descript fruitiness dominates the aroma backed by some sweet, bready malt. A good session quaffer.","johnrobe","Jul 12, 2003"

Fairly strong hops smell, with just a hint of malt. Taste was similar, a nice malt base with a hops finish, quite good for a Pale Ale. A bit light on the mouthfeel, but good on a hot day.

Much more balanced than I expected, not like many of the out of balance hops for hop's sake beers out there.","Sixpack595","May 22, 2003"

A slightly fruity malt note with a touch of grassy hops comprises the aroma. The taste is surprisingly bitter in a good way, with a touch of caramel/biscuity malt notes. Earthy hop flavors lead to a nice bitter but smooth finish. The aftertaste is a lingering earthiness with a touch of sweetness now and then. The mouthfeel is decent, but could be a bit more robust to support the flavors. Drinkability is very good. This is a fine pale ale at a very reasonable price.","aaronh","May 19, 2003"

I don't know if it's an off bottle, or if it's part of the flavor profile. I'm leaning towards it being a part of the flavor profile, since I've run into this exact flavor before in an IPA from Magic Hat. I still have a month before the 'best by' date is due, so I know it's somewhat fresh. Whichever it is, I don't care for it.","MJR","Apr 30, 2003"
4.1,12,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"So here is one of my standby's....a go to beer when the mind fails to decide upon something new. It's a beer for all occassions and seasons. It has a nice appearance of clear light amber/orange with a small head and moderate lacing, especially the draught. The aroma is a little but floral hoppiness with hints of caramel malt. As goes the flavor, hints of caramel malt, a little toasty, and a little hoppy in the end. Every flavor is strong enough to enjoy and light enough to drink all day or night or both. This is one highly quaffable brew. When it's on tap, the bitterness of the hops is more pronounced and crisp. Bottle or draught, a wonderful brew indeed.","AudioGilz","Apr 24, 2003"

Taste is sweet toasted malts and caramel up front followed by some woody notes and flavors of unsweetened black tea. A good amount of hop bite is present in the finish. This would make for a fine session beer. Thanks to bditty187 for the sample!","Morris729","Apr 15, 2003"

It's a tasty blizzard of hops, no matter how flung my imagination! Medium body, soft texture, a wonderful play on the tongue, a whirlwind of hop liveliness. Malt is a perfect match, holding it all together. Refreshing, delicious taste, some toasty, caramel notes showing up in the middle. Is it a pale ale, or more of an amber? Feels like a flavorful version of English bitter, for it would make an excellent session beer for those who don't compromise on taste. This is a delicious American ale, and one that does nothing but incite happiness!","feloniousmonk","Feb 06, 2003"

The EKG nose is strong and approaches being pungent-- it tastes dry - hopped.  It's fairly light - bodied, but has plenty of malt and hop character.  Definitely British in hop profile, as there seems to be no citrusy notes in this brew. Lots of tasty toasty malt flavors dominate the taste, but the Goldings bitterness smooth everything out.  It finishes fairly dry with no off flavors.  This could easily pass for a good English Pale Ale or ESB, but was a bit lacking in body.
