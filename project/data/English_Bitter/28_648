The nose comprises faint old sourdough and what may or may not be a hint grass, depending on whether or not I'm actually just smelling the air outside somehow. The taste pretty much echoes the smell, though now it's just generic barley and generic white bread yeast combining to form the most milquetoast of all possible flavors. I'd knock it, but it's not offensive, just insanely boring and undistinguished. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda crisp finish. Overall, this may be one of the blandest beers outside of the BMC arena. It's not bad, per se, just something I'd likely easily forget that I'd imbibed on any given day, especially if anything else happened that day, beer- or otherwise.","TMoney2591","Jul 09, 2013"

Aromas of roast, toffee, and a subtle, tangy hops presence. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a very bitter, astringent hops character. Very sharp on the initial tongue. The malt backbone literally gets buried amongst the bitter and astringent characteristics. Tangy, roasty aftertaste, with a dry, bitter finish.

3.53,12.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a light copper amber with a nice two finger yellowish white head with good retention and lacing. Light aroma of sweet malt with slight toastiness, lightly spicy. Flavor is light malt, slightly nutty, finishing malty and dry with bittering hops, slightly astringent. It does give the impression of a more flavorful malty beer that has been watered down, but it is being presented as a remake of the traditional small beers that were widely drunk and made from spent malt. From that point of view, the flavor is very pleasant for the very low ABV and second malt run. It was enjoyable trying this classic style and I'm glad Anchor makes it. It probably would be a good idea to make a category for this style, since it is traditional and was widely drunk at one time. I'm rating it as a small beer, not an English bitter (although it doesn't miss that mark by much).","LiquidAmber","Oct 20, 2012"

Flavor is bitter up front, some of the peanut flavor comes through, a good dose of cardboard (candy box style) some bits of metals. Medium bodied with much too much carbonation and a wettish finish.

The taste brings on an interestingly peppery wheat with more yeasty bread and grassy edges.

Considering that I'm not a fan of bitter beers, this one is not bad. It's not balanced, but beers that are supposed to be bitter aren't supposed to be, I suppose. I feel like I can taste the fact that it's more watery and less alcoholic than most beer, but maybe that's just in my head. It definitely has a weakness to it, though.

The beer is overflowing out of the bottle but the head retention is surprisingly poor. The beer is thin, thin, thin, and not all that flavorful. There are some very light citric hop flavors, but most just a thin, watery, hop bitterness with no malts underneath to balance this out. There is a very bland taste to the beer as well. I can't think of any reason to go back to this beer. The slight citrus, the cutting and harsh leafy hop, the watery feel, the lack of body and malt underneath render this pretty unsatisfactory.","albern","Oct 18, 2009"

Very grassy aromas, with a touch of hay and washed out cereal grain- very, very light. The taste doesn't impress me- just taste like cereal grains lightly steepeed in tepid water and then chilled. Hops? perhaps. I really just think leftovers as I drink this. Mouthfeel is light and sparkling, like a slightly grainy club soda with a bit of earthiness tossed in. I guess for the style it is basically as it should be, which if that is the case I'll let someone else enjoy the style from now on- I guess I still don't get it.","Georgiabeer","Jan 29, 2008"

Aroma is fair; mild grain and sour notes of hops, with only traces of maltiness. Taste is askew in my book; is this really what the maker was going for? Mild hops give way to a cardboard box like flavor, with a sharp hint of malt and grain that goes nowhere. Mouthfeel is very watery and the expectation of carbonation falls very flat.

The hop flavor is somewhat subdued (which is appropriate for an English bitter, which this beer characterizes itself as), but there is a nice hop spicing which adds some piney notes and a certain zing in the middle of this beer. There is a bit of nuttiness here too. Perhaps a tad too bitter to be spot on to style but I do like it anyway. Quite a clean strain of ale yeast was used as there is not much in the way of fruitiness or esters that might have added a bit more complexity.","Gueuzedude","Feb 04, 2004"

Bitter hops are detectable as well. Predictably, the nose is relatively weak. Straight bitterness hits the tongue initially with a more complex hoppiness taking over afterward. Malt base is there but secondary to the bitterness. Mouthfeel is clean; this one goes down just fine but is uninteresting compared to other Anchor offerings.","BitteBier","Jan 31, 2004"

This may be made with the second runnings of an Old Foghorn batch, but it tastes like third runnings.

From a brewing perspective, it's the second sparge of the grain from the Old Foghorn and moderately hopped into a second batch of beer. Pale to medium golden color with a thin white head. Malt is rather lacking in the aroma department, hops prevail. Definitely Northern Brewer and maybe some Cascades in the bittering. I guess BA lists it as a pale ale, I find it more to be a bitter. After consulting the label, Anchor categorizes it as that, too. Very hoppy and enjoyable. Spritzy carbonation; lack of body may heighten this sensation. Mouthfeel is obviously thin. Slight lingering bitterness paired with a tinge of carbonic acid. Highly recommended as a low ABV summer session ale.","crookedhalo","Nov 18, 2003"

Bubbly carbonation and a tinge of Liberty Ale like aroma. Very thin body with very little sweetness. I don't think its the hops that make this bitter, I have a feeling its the astringent malt that sticks in the back of your throat. Flowery hop flavor is welcome in its attempt to subdue the husky malt flavor, but doesn't quite make it. This one did not sit well with me. Oh well, they all can't be winners.","Longstaff","Nov 10, 2003"

The taste was lightly malty with bitter and floral hops that lingered pleasantly. The mouthfeel was crisp and smooth with a very dry finish (almost astringent). The body was medium-light with moderate carbonation feel. The floral hops really came through in the finish and aftertaste, and this hoppy punch made up for the otherwise light body.

It leaves minor spotty lace aroud the glass at the start of the pint, but very little else after that. The nose offers little more than a lightly husky malt. The body is light; but a very fine-bubbled and gently effervescent carbonation leaves it nicely crisp in the mouth. The flavor offers the same husky malt that the nose promotes; although it's not astringent, and a firm bitterness balances it nicely. Some low-level citrusy hop flavor is present, but not distinct in character. An average beer - there are many better beers in this range available in England. I would like to try this from a cask-conditioned Firkin, however. Additionally, with its low-level alcohol it could make a nice alternative to non-alcohol beers or soft drinks when you have to drive. One, or even two, over a period of an hour or so should be fine. And although it doesn't seem to have enough character to keep it interesting throughout an entire session, it might be a good beer to switch to as the evening winds down and you need to head home.","NeroFiddled","Apr 20, 2003"

Very dry in aftertaste. A bit watery in body. Not bad, but not terrific either. Overall taste is a bit rough on the mouth for such a purportedly ""mild"" beer.

That, along with the low alcohol content makes this a great session ale. There are many other ales out there that would be easier on the palate as far as a good session ale.

An ale pulled from the second running typically does not have this kind of head, but as I see the malt runs thin and they seemed to over hop. Bitterness is to the point of being the only flavour upfront which really kills the chances of the flavour being any good. Bit of a citric hop twang from middle to end. Graininess with some mild astringency is typical of a small beer of second runnings but this is pushing it to the point of being a chore to put down.
