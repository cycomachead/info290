"O: what a score, whatever batch they washed this off of.... follows the ""trend"" of local ""milds"" I had out there - soft-bready foundation with a punch of bold toasted grain and earthy hop dancing upon it"

"Pretty good flavor and drinkable."

"It's shocking how much flavor is brought at 3.2%. Seriously, it's a massive achievement and this is just a real good beer on the whole. This is a picture perfect session brew."

"A decent beer, but in my opinion not quite as enjoyable as the other Little Dog offerings I have tried."

"(Also posted this review under Little Dog - Fred since many people here are reviewing the Fred and Adam Little Dog under this umbrella)"
"After working my way through and Adam from the wood and needing to stay upright for many more hours, I decided to give Little Dog a taste. It was interesting, and it certainly manages to pack a lot of flavor into a low-ABV beer."
"A nice contrast with HOTD's heavier offerings; a good way to start my time at their bar."
"This is a very intriguing ale. The small beer concept is executed here with some serious panache and I like the result. Very good."
"O: So damn drinkable! Truly a sessionable beer, low alcohol and bold flavors (and cheap draft price, too!) would keep me returning to this again and again. As a 'small beer', this may not be to everyone's liking, but I'm fascinated by it and will continue to enjoy it as long as Alan and crew keep brewing Fred, Doggie Claws, Adam, etc."
"Seems more like a veritable Continental pils, and a good one at that. The lower booze (to no apparent detriment) provides a nice offset to the other higher octane offerings from this brewery."
"O: Average. Second runnings of Doggie or Fred may be good for some but not this guy. Not a fan and I prefer the first runnings and I dont see how this could be classified as an APA either."
"Sessionable to the extreme, but great beers to boot."
"Overall: An interesting and well crafted beer, but not one I desire to drink again."
"Session ale for sure, I could definitely sit around drinking these all night."
"Gotta love a great sessionable beer by HotD. This small beer from the second runnings of a Doggie Claws batch poured vibrant, hazy golden/yellow with a white head. Floral hops on the nose with a biscuity grain character. Cascade hops maybe? Very floral, earthy, aromatic, piney. Cracker-like, toasted grains. Smooth drinking, great hop presence."
"Little Dog in many ways has similar characteristics (I felt) to Greg in that is seems to have a crispness like a white wine."
"drinkability - very drinkable, good session beer, happy to see this on draft as the hotd beers are usually slow sippers"
