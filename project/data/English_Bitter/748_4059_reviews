"This beer really grew on me as I let it open up."
"Not brilliant, though I reckon the age of the bottle might have something to do with it. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are overly yeasty and otherwise quite bland. Mouthfeel is OK but a shade overcarbonated. Possible yeast overdevelopment or cell death giving some off-notes to the character. Nothing special but might be worth sampling again if I have the chance. No need to hunt it down."

"O: This beer is very sessionable and goes down quite easily; I would have no problem drinking several of these in a sitting. The bitterness isn’t overly strong."

"Taste is zesty, minerally bread, bread crust, bitter herb and lemon, peppery, leafy, zesty. A light, bright, juicy yeastiness and hoppiness thoroughly dominate and it leans firmly, but gently, to the bitter side with plenty of well-rounded character, yeasty-hoppy-juicy-leafy-herbal, to support the bitterness. It is a great, light session bitter."
"A really nice thirst quenching real ale."
"Very flavorful, hop-forward and quite bitter. Hop flavors take on a more earthy and herbal quality on the tongue. The malt foundation is bready and dry, quite crisp. There's a mineral backbone that seems to enhance the dryness, adding a bit of astringency that doesn't go too far. It's a light bodied beer, but not as thin as some bitters can be - there's just enough heft. Apple-like fruitiness appears mid-palate, but the strong bitterness in the finish quickly washes it away. Bitterness could stand to be dialed down a bit, I feel like it covers up some of the complexity. Nonetheless, this was a very enjoyable beer, one I'd definitely buy again."
"Overall there wasn't much about this beer that stood out but it was absurdly easy to drink. Worth a shot."
"*from notes"
"Fairly drinkable if you want an average bitter but overall nothing remarkable here, no need to search out or pay the inflated export price."
"d - Overall, a pretty nice ESB. Very easy to drink and a great session beer. Would try again."
"I had a bottle at Tap and Table last week (review is from notes) and was actually blown away by how good a bitter could be from a bottle. The beer had a light multi-grain malt flavor with hints of cocoa and coffee. As I continued to drink, more character opened up with big grassy and lemon hops and a peppery tobacco finish. Heck of a beer, I recommend it."
"Yet another nice find at My Place in Newtown, CT this cask ale presents a pale clear amber color with a fair, big-bubbled head that dies pretty quickly with no lacing. The aroma is dank wheat with a slight herbal hop highlight. Not thrilling but there's hope. The taste offers a creamy citrus bite, nothing harsh but reasonable in typical English style. Very modest carbonation. It's a very nice blend of citrus and floral bread. A near full feel, very smooth and quite drinkable. The hops seem to build as you go. A very decent brew!"
"Search this out you'd be happy you did!"
"Conclusion: This is a pretty decent English Bitter...light, smooth, tasty; but a little bit over simple"
"The hoppiness and dry feel stayed into the aftertaste. A good bottled beer."
"Going through my fridge, I found I had 2 bottles of this beer, and they are consistent, if not what I was looking for. I appropriately let them sit out to warm up before opening them. Poured from the bottle, this beer has a hazy pale amber color, with a small white head, leaving minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is slight, but I detected some citrus. The taste is surprisingly watery, but has a slight citrus hop taste. The mouthfeel, like the beer, is light. I was expecting something bolder, especially as this was the 1998 Champion Bitter at the Great British Beer Fest. It's probably awesome on cask, but this version leaves me cold."
"taste of bitter hops, toffee, touch of citrus, nice dry finish and nicely bitter."
"I have no clue as to the age of this bottle, other than I notice some haziness with the second pour and some....floaties. Ok. Another brew from the UK that, obviously, isn't in its peak condition and I guess I'm getting used to that by now. That's a pity because even though I *know* that it's well past its optimum state...I still find it tasty and very drinkable. A fresh sample would probably make me really go gaga.."
"MF&D - Thin-medium bodies ale. IMO way too much sediment, at least in the bottle I sampled. Noting special here at all, I would not go out of my way for this one."
"A well crafted English bitter from a well kept cask. One of those things in life that I really appreciate."
"This beer was poured from a 500ml bottle into a imperial pint glass with a delicate white lacy head and a glowing golden orange hue. There was a bit more sediment than expected. Strong floral and citrus sent with hints of apple, pears and kiwis. Good body not to much hop thickness and the lemoney citric zest just zips off your tounge. Then finnishs with a subtle hint of grapefruit."
"Pours a slightly fogged gold with a good sized crème head that leaves a mass of lace on the way down. And oops, I got some sediment in the glass. Nose is pretty mild really. Not much going on except slight bitter tone and a mild hop. Flavor is an English bitter for sure. Smooth and consistent, but not very exciting really. Feel has a thicker body to the liquid with an odd sticky texture to it. Decent enough carbonation. Drinkable, sure. It is a good beer. But for the price? A bit too high for one bottle I have to say. Especially for not having any wild character about it."
"This beer poured a golden color with a huge head  some sedimentation noted even though I poured carefully. The aroma is spicy and fruity. The taste is spicy and bitter. Hops are noticeable as well as some slight fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is thin to medium and has a lot of carbonation. This beer finishes dry. This is an easy to drink beer - would be good for sessions."
"Light-bodied, appley malt with a resinous base and in the finish a lingering grapefruit that you can chew on long after the last sip."
"Drinkabily: High. This is the first time I had this beer, and sometimes my prejudice (for and against) English bitters compels me to usually rate their beers ""quaint"" and unremarkable. However, this one does stick out for me. Maybe it's been a while since I've sampled many beers of the style, but this one was either quite fresh, or just beautifully made. Or both! This one you'd want to sip on a warm day, preferably river-side in an easy chair, watching the stream roll down the horizon. Easy and pleasant drinkin', mate."
"Nice 1 pint, 9 oz bottle, poured into a tulip. Very sweet aroma, almost like a sweet tea, flowery and alluring. Firm thin head. A bit thin is my first impression. The tea thing is sticking with me on this one ... definitely an impression of fresh brewed Ear Grey here, which is really odd for this yellow-orange brew, but there it is. It mellows as you go, more like a small, seedy orange. This would be awesome on the golf course, in lieu of a margarita ... not one to side with a cigar, but this is a quality brew in a girlie package. (#2697, 2/12/2007)"
"500ml brown bottle. Slightly murky orange-amber body with little chunks of yeast all throughout the beer and about an inch of offwhite head. Floral hops dominate the aroma with some caramel malt. Hops (English), kind of grassy and somewhat piney, dominate the flavor with a fair bit of malt to support them. I may be off, but I detect a hint of smoke in this beer too. Medium to full in body. Not a bad English bitter."
"500 ml brown bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Bottle conditioned. Brewed with pale malt only. Golden colour, just a slight haziness, large off-white head. Nice hoppy aroma, hints of citrus, leather and maybe some oak. Distinct hoppy flavour throughout, some citrus and toffee, fruity finish. Bitter and long lasting aftertaste. A refreshing beer - not bad at all."
"Pours a light brown color with a golden hue. The head is blanket-like and pretty rocky, making this a nicely attractive brew. The aroma is earthy, with just a slight whiff of hops. A small amount of caramel, citrus, and some grain also mix in the smell. The taste is dry, with a grain and mild hop flavor. The flavor is somewhat restrained, which was a disappointment to me. Same goes for the mouthfeel, with seemed a little light. Lots of carbonation. The finish has a grapefruit citrus flavor, with modest bitterness. The beer is okay, but it dint really speak to me. All in all, this is an average and uninteresting bitter."
"D - Highly drinkable. Very enjoyable beer from a brewery that I really like."
"M&D: besides the fine carbonation, the phenomenal bitterness helps result in a 3D and lively palate throughout. This is a medium-bodied, reasonably flavoursome, and really really bitter Bitter. Not as colourful and soft as the cask-conditioned version though, which is one of my favourite Bitters on cask; but still, this bottle-conditioned version scores high in my book. Recommended!"
"Poured a clear deep golden with a light orange hue with a huge blooming foamy white head that slowly crept its way down but took quite some time for it to settle.Aromas are clean I think to clean, a little caramel note and a light passing herbal note but it was faint.Its a sessional style beer no doubt light toasted,caramel sweet malt but nothing overbearing finishing with a light lemon,herbalness.It is what it is a light bitter a good quaffer just very subtle flavors."
"I will definately drink it again,especially if someone else is buying!"
"Overall: Seems to suit the style just fine. Worth a try."
"A dry, crisp, clean, and refreshing bitter. Almost lager-like when decanted."
"My first beer from this brewery, I would search out more and would love to try it a the source."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent along with a slightly dry, yet fruity English yeast aroma. It's bitter with noble hops; quite nice. The taste is average. It has a very bitter hop flavor that is way over the top. It has a light pale malt flavor, but there is no real balance here. It has a powerful grapefruit aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is an average bitter. It's way too over the top for me. I'm not a huge fan of citrus hops. It's one and done for me."
"Another English ale that pours with a good amount of carbonation (probably because it bottle-conditioned.) This bitter pours with a beautifully rocky head that slowly falls leaving thick lacing. There's just a little bit of a saltine cracker aroma. A fairly full-bodied bitter with a straightforward maltiness (not complex) and hearty bitter finish. Nothing terribly complex here, just a very refreshing bitter ale. Perhaps a bit too clean for the style, but a good quencher, and certainly bitter enough. The bottle mentions adding the yeast to the bottle for ""a fuller flavour", which I'd recommend, as doing so seemed to bring out a delicate fruitiness in this beer. I liked this beer but it seemed to be overcarbonated. I can only imagine what it would be like on cask."
"Drinkability: Wow! This is probably the best English Bitter I've sampled. I'm looking forward to picking up some more of these. Ideal as a session ale and delicate and complex enough to enjoy as a sipper."
"Hazy light peach color with a big rising head that's nice and rocky. LAces in large slipping patches. Light brown sugar aroma with an appetizing hop aroma, muted and bark-like, but nice. Light body but fairly generous carbonation. Interesting beer, emphasizes hops but distinctly in an English style, tight and floral, verging on charred. Pretty good balance but hop skewed. Notable in that its almost a stand out in taking a classic Bitter to its extreme, low in alcohol and sharp and a nice change of pace in light of the numerous American Ales that cross my path. Because of the higher carbonation and slightly medicinal qualities, I didn't find this really drinkable however."
"Pours with a five-finger+ white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium bodied and light carbonation. Nose is soapy and hoppy. Starts bitter with hops and finishes bitter, lingering bitter aftertaste. $5.75 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Light to medium bodied."
"Overall: What the heck have these guys bottled??.it isnt the Pitchfork I recall from my heady Cask Ale drinking days in the UK. Im *completely* stumped, is my memory that bad?or is this just different in the bottle. This is both a SIBA Best Bitter and CAMRA Best Bitter Beer of the Year winner also. Though you would never believe it from the bottle.Ill stick with the cask version thank you very much!!!"
"Other comments: Good level of bitterness to perk up your palette, but the hop flavor is not very appetising (sort of vomit-like). Much better if you eat dry-roasted peanuts while you drink it."
"Had this on cask at Rich O's Public House. Pours an amber color with a moderate head that has good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is subdued, but there is a slight hop and a nice maltiness to it. The flavor is incredibly smooth. Very much like an English Mild, but better. Very mellow and incredibly easy to drink. Malty, but not too malty. Bitter, but just barely. Great brew here."
"On cask poured into a nonick pint glass. It pours a medium amber color with two fingers of head. There is lots of lacing. The smell is light and malty with just a hint of hops. Not too much going on. The tate is sweet and malty, with some honey presence. There is a nice crisp hoppy finish that really balances it out. The mouthfeel was exceptionally thick and smooth. The drinkability was great as well. A nice little treat from across the pond."
"Sampled last night at Rick-O's. This poured a nice golden color with a finger of head and lots of stickey lace as I drank the beer. The nose was sltigthly caramel sweet with a toasted character and a really nice english hop, pretty much what I would expect of a bitter. The flavor was very nice, mellow caramel and toasted grains moved to a really smooth yet crisp hop that lingered nicely on my tongue. There was a slight metallic aftertaste that detracted a bit. The beer was smooth and an awesome moderate feel. This beer was a very nice one to start the evening with. Served at just the perfect temperature. I could have drank it all night, but with all the rest of the beers on the menu, what is the fun in that?"
"Pitchfork Rebellious Bitter is pretty good beer. If you allow it to warm a bit (spend the time appreciating the lace), the hops find their stride and makes this a highly drinkable, incredibly sessionable English ale."
"BLAH! Overpriced for what you get, just another English ale, except this one cost $7 a bottle."
"Bitter citric taste up front,freshly hoppy. Lemon zest and yeast, rides long on the tongue and in the mouth. Taste...well...there it is...not very ""rebellious", just a decent bitter, smooth, slightly fruity, with that lightly lingering hoppiness, easy drinking all the way, creamy and quaffable. Yadda, yadda."
"Clouded coppery orange color, thin, compact foamy off-white head, some strings of lace stick. Aroma is faint of floral spiced hops and fruityness of mellons sit underneath, pleasantly toned and mild on the nose. Taste is very nice, good amount of grassy/floral hops with some slight mellon fruityness ties in a nice balance. Bitterness is there in good quantity for a bitter, mellow and inviting, nice length and fruity characteristics lingers nicely. Quite a nice taster. I nearly forgot it was a bitter, it came into an IPA quality of some English variants I've had so that impressed me. Solid medium body, creamy, good bittering hops and malty sweet backing; a fine drinker, really became easy to down as it warmed."
"Color was a very pale gold, huge white head shrunk to a thin layer, tons of lace was left. Earthy grainy aroma. Typical smooth taste profile with right amount of hoppiness. Malt leanings, bitterness is subtle, some fruitiness. Bottle conditioned and very drinkable. I have never come across any RCH beers on cask in the U.K. but I'll try looking harder next time. Interesting label, with a small portrait of I believe King James II on it. Thanks again to Rkhaze for thinking of me on his latest beer trip."
" It is smooth with a nice crisp start. The hops are pretty kicking in this one. It seems to have some hop character from an American pale mixed with a British bitter. Grains are an outstnading partner to balance this one. It has just enough bitterness and sweetness to come together. Drinkability is excellent, and although this was missing a little bit of that nice earthy cask flavor, it was nice none the less."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Lovely stuff. A decent session bitter in my books."
"Drinkability  The low ABV actually helped this one go down pretty well. This is a nice session beer, but not one of my favorites."
"RCH Pitchfork: On cask at the RAF. Yellow color, tending toward hazy. The head was as expected, light with large bubbles. Nice sweet aroma, somewhat grassy. Taste is not at all what I had hoped for. To me this is very musty, with heavy horse blanket/hay/vegetable tastes. A hand full of crackers and a sip of water did not improve the taste. The program stated that this was a Grand Champion, but to me it was the worst of the lot."
"A clear light copper with absolutely no head - but then again, it's cask conditioned... what else do you expect? Actually, I'd like to see even a hint of carbonation on this... nada. Aroma is slightly sweet and grainy, with a perfumy hop presence... herbal and fruity. Flavor is very well balanced between slightly sweet and grainy, and bitter and spicy... some fruit flavors are in the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. A nicely done bitter, that I would recommend on cask."
"A nice hazy amber-gold colored brew.  Nice head, with solid (but not really impressive) retention.  Very earthy, herbal aroma.  Flavor full of herbal, grassy hops and balanced nicely with sweet malt.  Fairly light on the tongue, with a nice bitter, hoppy  finish.  Refreshing brew that I plan on having again before it disappears from the Indy beer scene."
