3.87,3.5,4.25,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Pours a darkened amber color, a nice, heavy wood tone. Quite cloudy. I can just see the shadows of my fingers through the full glass. The head is cream-colored and creamy. It's a medium-thick blanket of foam that sticks on top of the beer for a good long time. Solid lacing. A doughy, rich malt flavor comes out as the strongest note in the aroma. There's also a good dose of caramel and some light, earthy hops. The hops make a stronger showing in the taste with a gentle bitterness and a mix of floral, earthy and grassy flavors with a touch of citrus peel. The beer is drier than expected, which is a pleasant surprise. It has a clean, rich malt character that steps aside to let the hops balance things out. Very easy to drink. Relatively low carbonation. Smooth, creamy feel. It manages to hit a rather British-y balance, which is generally hard to find among American takes on British ales. Good stuff.","popery","Jul 01, 2013"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Another fine brew found in El Dorado. Pours to a generous buff head that falls to a thin layer and does produce some lacing effects. Color is a hazy amber brown. Aroma is caramel, toffee, and English hops. Flavor picks up where aroma started with a nice malty backbone with caramel malt and Maris Otter malt with a balancing charge of floral/earthy hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, no astringency and appropriate carbonation. Overall a fine English bitter that takes regional standards to a new level.","EagleTalon","Jun 07, 2013"

Smells of dry hops, sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of floral hops, hint of grass, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of grass, hint of dry hops, slight floral hops, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, body, and blend.","Tone","Feb 06, 2013"

I read the style info on this site to help me understand, but doesn't really explain it to me. With every sip, I enjoy it more. Kinda reminds me of earthy roots... Yeah, I'm not a big radish fan, but it reminds me of some roots. Very interesting. The mouthfeel is very nice...not as carbonated as the appearance portrayed. Drinkability is decent...I wish I knew exactly what this taste was.","DovaliHops","Jun 30, 2010"

2.74,-26.7,2,3,2.5,3,3,"Served in a standard pint glass with a full off-white head that dissipated fairly soon thereafter. Appearance was off-white to sallow and completely opaque. Asked the barserver if it was always this cloudy and was told it must be the bottom of the barrel where the alcohol is higher and other stuff. Made perfect sense to me? Smell was average and beery with nothing distinctive. Taste was flat and thin with a hint of toffee. Finish was acidic with only a slight floral bitterness. An average brew that I wouldn't care to try again unless it was from a newly tapped keg and wasn't overly cloudy. Hopefully that was the reason for the unremarkable taste.","utah44","Dec 03, 2009"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice cloudy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger foamy white head, with some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, spicy, with some caramel. The taste is bitter, slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note, got some spice in there, and some caramel. Medium body.

4.2,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"received this in trade from Stephens101 I believe. Shared with some of the regulars at the Brick Store Pub. This is a very nice English Bitter. It surely would have been nice if Marshall Brewing Company had been open when I lived in Tulsa a while ago. Very well done beer. Pours a somewhat hazy amber with a decent head that sticks around for a bit. Smells somewhat light and yeasty, but with a nice, dry, biscuity smell in the background. Tastes very clean and restrained with good, typical English malt notes. Slightly biscuity, soft and with a subtle earthy bitterness. Soft on the palate up front, but with just enough dry bitterness to give it some snap at the end. Really a very well made beer. Nice to try something so well made from Oklahoma.","Georgiabeer","Jul 28, 2009"
