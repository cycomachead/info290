Light caramel malts, some earthy and floral hops. Taste is good, but definitely on the lighter side. Malty, and a touch sweet. Some earthy and biscuit notes.","Boto","Jul 14, 2013"

I found it on draught here at the Cock And Bull Pub on Mainstrasse in Covington, KY and have been enjoying it since. On a hot day you can sit outside and the creamy mellow taste cools you down. Anyone who reads my reviews knows I am an avid Half and Half drinker and I like this with Guiness Draught layered in the English pint. Nice for sitting around and having a chat. But on its own, nicely done. It's served at Old Trafford for all you United Fans. Cheers, mate.","WillWillows","Apr 26, 2013"

Virtually tasteless and without aroma. What little can be detected is horrid, while the body leaves much to be desired (like a corpse). This is bad on so many levels, it should be considered a crime against humanity. Avoid at all costs.","jazzyjeff13","May 28, 2012"

2.93,0.3,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I had never had this beer so i decided to try it as it was on tap at my uni bar. It said bitter on the label but I wasn't prepared for exactly how bitter the beer would be. The beer was very thick but at the same time watery. I can see why people have seen this beer as going downhill. Everyone around me was dismissing it as complete shit but I thought it held its own. It was certainly different than anything I have ever tried and I wasn't prepared for it. Was it a little too bitter and watery? yea but I think this beer has more potential than people give it. I wish i could have tried it back in its prime as people have said but for now it is an interesting style that i wouldn't mind trying more","tenaciousp65","Feb 19, 2011"

3.95,35.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I had tried Boddington's pub ale when I lived in the States and highly enjoyed that. Bought the draught bitter after moving to the UK. This has a mellow, creamy taste that is hard not to enjoy. Nice creamy head that remains. It's amazing that beer from a can can taste this good. Only minor downside is the aftertaste is a bit too mellow. The beer tastes great on the tongue, but the finish is almost watery. Otherwise a great beer!","fullsweep","May 05, 2008"

3.23,10.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer poured a clear pale yellow color that was clear and fairly carbonated. The head that was produced was rather weak, it was off white in color, and even with the nitro can the head only lasted a moment before it fell to nothing, not even a ring on the edges. There was no lace present. The aroma that came from the glass was on the weak side as well. Aromas of light sweet malt, some floral hops and fruit were all that I could detect. The tastes that rolled over my tongue were much like the nose, weak. I tasted in the beginning a sweet malt and fruit (maybe a strawberry) and ended on the slight bitter side with floral hops. The aftertaste was faint; some bitter hops came through, but were not lasting. The body was light. Over all a light beer with decent flavors. Even though the flavors were weak, they were refreshing on the cruise in the hot sun. This beer is a decent session beer when in the hot sun and you dont want anything heavy, but want a beer.","Jarod","0"
