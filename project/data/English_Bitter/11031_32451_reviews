"batch 695, label says 4.42% abv. this is an oddball to say the least. upon opening the beer it launched white foam all over the kitchen, and continued to spew foam slowly the entire time, even after most of it was poured into a glass. there was about one part beer, 5 parts lacey head from a gentle pour, very strange. the nose is odd too, its got a dusty sort of smell, ancient in a way, exhumed. the yeast is spicy and heavy, while the hops are unique, oily and crisp. the flavor has some of that same dusty vibe, but has a finish that reminds me of the hop extract oils ive tasted, pungent and powerful, long lasting. the mouthfeel is different as well, its heavier from all the yest suspended within, but its made really light by all the delicate foam you cant help but fill your mouth with on each sip. 11.2 ounces of this was enough for me, but i am glad i tried this one of a kind beer. really out of the box brew here, worth a try."
"O-it's not a bad beer at all. It's different. Not much like an English bitter at all. It's more like a mix between a great Belgian and tonic. It's a fine drinker though.I'll enjoy the whole bottle, but I won't be getting more."

"O: I love it when a brewer can coerce this much flavor out of a sub 4.5% beer. Very enjoyable brew."
"Not terribly representative of an English Bitter, but it's absolutely packed with aroma and flavor for something with just 4.5% ABV."
"O – Very good drinkability, would love to have a case or two of this in my cellar, enjoyed this enough I will be looking out for it in the future… hopefully at a lower US price point 4"
"(11.2 oz bottle from El Cerrito Market). Batch 695. Pours almost all white head. I had to wait some time for it to dissipate. Pours a hazy golden color with active carbonation. Aroma has some grass, hay, bread and some lush tropical fruits. Taste is sweet with a weird bitterness to it. Metallic? Medium bodied with a slick texture. Dry finish. The off-taste was distracting, but I could catch a good enough glimpse of the beer to see what it was. I would like to try again to see if I had an older bottle."
"O- This beer is light but has a nice ethereal spicing quality to it."
"O: The beer is a remarkable take on the style and is definitely a lot more interesting compared to bitters brewed on the opposite shore of the North Sea. The light body makes this beer easy to drink and the citrus aromas and taste lend refreshing qualities."
"A nice light slightly hoppy beer."
"Slainte but spend your bitter-dollars elsewhere."
"This starts out as a very lively brew with a massive head as you pour. It makes you wait to finish the pour. Upon finishing the pour the sediment hits the glass and gets kicked around by all the bubbles in there. The look of the beer is not a foggy yellow gold and cannot see through it anymore. The beer has a very little spicy note to the finish along with some banana in the mix. The bitterness is there in the beginning and it sticks around for a little. Not a bad beer."
"Something has to be wrong with this."
"D: If you don't mind the somewhat extreme carbonation (which is common for Belgian/Dutch ales of the style) you'll love this one - definitely an all night drinker."
"Notes: One of the most unassuming offerings from De Molen I've been lucky enough to try, and again quite a pleasing ride. Not overtly complex or remarkable but in its simplicity and flow it felt mighty good."
"Pours a clear, golden color. One and one half inch head of a white color. There is some suspended sediment. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, citrus, slight floral, hint of tea, hint of tart malt, and slight yeast. The mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Tastes of slight pale malt, yeast, hint of tart malt, dry hops, and hint of tea. Overall, good body, blend, aroma, and appearance."
"The beer pours a straw color with a large, fluffy white head. The aroma is heavy on the flowers and biscuit malt. The flavor is very similar with a few additions. The dominant flavors are biscuit malt and floral hops, but I also get a little bit of grassyness from the hops. As I continue to drink the beer, the flavor gets a little bit medicinal. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: No thank you. I use soap to clean my glasses but don't drink the soapy water afterward."
"D: This was just a strange beer. It had qualities of a witbier, a Belgian pale, and a bitter, but I can't say that any of them worked all that well."
"Cloudy orange with a white head. A pleasant wheat nose with a med/thin mouthfeel. Medium hop bitter with a light malt flavor. Pleasant and subtle. Nice witbier character. But a bit simple all around coming from this great brewer."
"It's not an English Bitter. It's very much a Northern European Pale Ale. I'd say the style should be (BJCP 16B) Belgian Pale Ale. However, it's lovely. Very nice - refreshing when cold,; rich, warm, fruity when warm. Complex all the way through. Very tasty."
"Very nice beer"
"Very smooth mouthfeel with medium body for the style and soft carbonation. Hell of a bitter overall."
"Overall I believe this is my first experience with this hop (unless it's Belgian for a more commonly used hop) and while not ground-breaking it imparts some nice flavors. Worth a shot."
"Light creamy early textures fade quickly to a fleeting dryness, reminescent of cask ales. Well attenuated and refreshing with an effortless ease of drinking."
"This is a solid bitter that is pretty light on flavor but still very, very sessionable."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"D: Good overall flavour and a light-bodied makes this exceptionally quaffable on a hot summer day, good stuff."
"Conclusion: I bought two bottles but I wish it was two cases."
"33cl bottle of Engels--with an S. Pours a cloudy caramel color with a billowing, rocky white head that lasts. It eventually recedes to leave thick lacing. Interesting, estery smell with notes of fruit and bubblegum. Not really characteristic of a bitter, but great nonetheless. Grassy hops and some lemon. Light caramel malt in the background. Very pleasant tasting, with prominent aromatic hop notes. Sharp, refreshing bitterness. Yeasty, fruity taste, again with some citrus. Very light roastiness at the end. Bone-dry finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Great, utterly drinkable stuff. I would classify this as a saison, actually, though with British caramel malt used to cut the usual Belgian pils."
"Bottle courtesy Absumaster. Pours malty, a bit funky smelling white parachute head that leaves but a littl lace. Light body underneath that has an understated bitterness to it, understated carbonation, medium mouthfeel with some mouth tingling. Drinkable, drying aftertaste."
"Taste was flowery, somewhat soapy with some malt and light caramellic flavors. The bitterness was just right for an English bitter and hop taste was typical English. The body was thin and drinkability was good."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is the weakest link in this beer, as it's thin-ish and soft-fizziness of cask-conditioning is in absence, somehow degrading the enjoyment by a big margin; the unsettled yeastiness also makes the flavour all the more muddy and off-balance, not like what a cask-conditioned ale should be. If that weakness is put right and the flavour profile becomes more balanced, I'm sure this beer could be a real success. Great effort, though!"
