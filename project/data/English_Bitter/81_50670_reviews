"an original summer beer, not very spectacular"
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I just don't have enough experience with English Bitters, but this beer didn't sit so well with me. Had on draft at the Times. Clear amber-reddish color, perhaps a little lighter than that. Grainy flavor that you'll occasionally get out of Scottish beers. On tap, average carbonation. It just didn't sit well with me for a Summer beer, better directions to go in for something like that out there."
""
""
""

""
"Meh - a pretty poor effort. Bland and watery, with little depth or character to keep you interested. The Newcastle brand is going to be subject to the law of diminishing returns if it keeps making brews like this. Give it a miss."
""
"Malty feel to the actual taste, but this a watery brew and it doesn't carry the 4.4% ABV very well at all. Nicely carbonated but lacks depth of flavour and comes across as a weak, almost bland blend. To be fair it does have a crisp bitter bite towards the end, but overall I wasn't really impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall pint glass. Pours a translucent yellow orange with a small white head with some lacing. Smells fruity and grainy, nice and inviting. Tastes of slight fruit, sweet, with a nice grain profile. Beer is quite watery and is slightly under carbonated. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit of a strange flavor combination. The fruity, estery taste seems out of place. The carbonation is too high. Lacks malt profile."
""
""
""
""
""

"Says hops and glory on the bottle. It has an old hops and that canned mushroom English malt flavour. With the said, I like this brew much better than regular old New Castle. Nice golden color with a nice grassy floral nose (a bit of an aged hops smell). The hops and malt in this brew are balanced very nicely. I would get this one over regular New Castle."
""
"O) I did not enjoy this very much, something just seemed off. If I had this on tap, I would question how clean the lines were. The taste seemed off and the mouthfeel was poor in my opinion. I enjoy Newcastle Brown Ale, so I thought this would be okay. It was not, I cannot recommend this beer."
""
""
""
"O: I would choose this over most macros, but it would certainly not be something that I would drink normally. I am glad that I got this beer on sale to say the least."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a nice beer to session with for a long time."
"A basic, bitter golden ale, a decent offering and one that I would have no problems drinking again but not one that is particularly worth going looking for, if it's available give it a go otherwise drink what you find."
"Conclusion: a fairly good beer for a macro, that is for sure. As for being a real bitter, it falls short, but it would be an alright choice if the alternatives were all macro lagers."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is ok.. I wouldn't buy it a second time though. In my opinion, it is mislabeled. This isn't a traditional summer beer."
""
""
"Again, the hops do show with balancing malt, but the butter is too much here. While it does add to the complexity and balance here, it goes a bit overboard. I can drink a few, but will have a butter aftertaste with just a hint of the hops that were present in the aroma and initial flavour. Overall though a nice enough ""summer"" bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O-Different summer beer from many others I have had, a bit more bitter which was nice. good session beer"
""
""
"Definitely one of the better summer ales Ive tried. This beer is a light pale yellowish color. It pours smoothly into my snifter and has an average amount of head, lace and foam. It has a typical summer ale aroma of lemon and lager. It is a beautiful color and it is a pretty decent beer. Great for barbeques and backyard swim parties.'"

"Not at all what I expected from a ""summer"" beer (most labeled as such are sweet and golden, but mostly bland), but I like it."

"The Summer Ale is a yellow straw color. On the first taste there are alot of hops and bitterness. It goes down pretty smooth. To be honest the only reason I am trying this is because I'm a huge fan of Newcastle Brown Ale. It's my favorite beer. I am not a big fan of summer ales. I like my beer dark. But anyways, this summer ale isn't too bad. Goes down smooth if that is what you like. It's worth giving a try. Cheers."
"A good attempt by a larger established brewer, however not a refreshing enough beer for summer."
"Overall a disappointing beer. It doesn't taste bad it just doesn't have much taste. I could see where this might appeal to quenching thirst on a blazing Summer day. But taste? This just doesn't have it."
""
""
""
""
"I recommend passing on this. The fact that this got any good reviews makes me wonder if I had a bad batch."
""
"O/D-A nice partner to their trademark Brown Ale. This single bottle was a pleasant surprise."
""
""
"While a solid beer, not really much that would draw me back to this again in the future. It pours a medium-light copper with a slight foamy off-white head, leaving a slight amount of lacing along the glass. Smell is very hoppy, slightly nutty/bready. Taste is also hoppy, bitter, and slightly acidic. The beer starts strong, but it ends a little flat. More than one or two at a time of these would be pushing it in my opinion."
"I would buy it again on a hot day."
""
"Too expensive for the return but a decent brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Hey its better then a bud or miller. It is what it is, a average beer that should be easy to find if your stuck somewhere looking for a beer that actually has some flavor to it. Its nothing special at all, lacks in many areas like complexity, hop kick, overal amount of flavor but its not a drain pour atleast."
"It pours with a nice-looking color that is between amber and golden. I was getting two-finger head on my pour. Decent lacing at first, head disappears in about 10 minutes. There was some foam laying on top after sitting for 20-25 with a last mouthful of beer. Aroma is ok, reminds me of Boddington's (?). It has a nice citrus-like finish but not in the taste. Feels slightly tangy, a little hoppy but not strong. Light maltiness. It is kind of like a Nut Brown ale light. Seems pleasant enough to drink on a scorching summer day, but not an outstanding beer. For summer beer, I prefer to drink a Heffe or Kolsch."
"Pours to a nice creamy white head and decent lacing. Color is dark gold and clear. Aroma presents with sweet malt, clover honey and butterscotch. Flavor is a mild and balanced blend of earthy hops and sweet malt. Finishes clean and dry. Mouthfeel is light, watery and low carbonation which is good for style. Overall a nice session beer you can drink a lot of and still get some hops and malt."
""
""
"O- the style is identified as an English bitter but they want to sell this as a summer ale. In the US that means something a bit different, some spice or citrus. This is ok as an ordinary bitter. It goes down easy and tastes clean and refreshing but nothing special."
""
""
"Overall - I would recommend trying this brew once, just for the sake of trying it. It's not going ot knock your socks off, nothing to write home about, but it is unique and worth a try at least. I wouldn't buy it again, but I would drink it again."
"D/O: Life's too short to drink subpar beer. It's not particularly drinkable, and it's not particularly enjoyable. My guess is they're moving cases of this because they called it ""summer ale", and in the summer time, Common Joe The Beer Drinker gets a little bit more adventurous and will try something new that has the word ""summer"" in it. Turns out this isn't a wit or a wheat... and it doesn't have anything resembling a ""bright hop"" presence. Just boring English bitter. I don't think I ever need to revisit this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Light head and no lacing though. Nose is soapy and floral. Light body accentuated with a pungent, metallic malty tone complimented with flora and hops. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
"Picked up a 6 pack on the way home tonight. Uncapped and took a drink from the bottle. It is marketed as a ""summer ale", so I was expecting something light with a citrus hint. Was surprised to taste malts, caramel, grains, with a slight dry/bitter aftertaste. Poured it into a glass to find a brownish yellow pour with a white head that developed then disappeared. A small ring stayed on the edge of the glass to the finish. I am currently on my 3rd beer trying to figure out if I like it or not. Overall I am finding it just an average beer. I would buy it again. I think it is nice to find a lower alcohol beer with flavor."
"O: Not a bad beer, just too sweet and not enough hop or bitter for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This actually got a little bit better as I continued to drink it, but overall I would not buy this again. Flavors are just “off”."

"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 31-03-X-L0775908. Sampled on June 14, 2012. Newcastle has brewed up a golden yellow beer that has a short lasting head and an odd aroma. I get malts, yeast, and floral hops on the nose but there is something else offsetting the whole thing...something akin to ginger. The body is summer seasonal light and creamy. The taste has a kind of cardboard like maltiness with a more notable bitter hop finish that lingers for a moment. There are summer seasonals from other brewers that I find to be more appealing than this one. I think I will stick with their traditional nut brown ale."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of an English Bitter, I don't have any experience with this style so that might not be that accurate, but I see this beer as average all the way around regardless of style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was somewhat smooth and a little crisp, but the flavors are bland and don't hold my attention, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were the highlights of this beer and while not the best they didn't have many flaws like the other aspects of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and the taste, they were just too bland with not enough hops showing up. I don't think I would buy this beer and I can't say I would really recommend this beer, as far as summer ales go, it's not hard to find a much better one. I have had their Newcastle Ale before but I haven't reviewed it, it's a solid English beer and is a little similar to this beer, but the extra hops that they advertise really don't show up, I wasn't impressed with beer but I still think this brewery is pretty solid, I'll have to try more of their beers, but this one just wasn't for me."
"I'd say this brew is Pretty much a lighter version of regular Newcastle. Not bad looking, light brown, decent head and lace with some staying power, malty, little hops. Not really an exciting beer, but a pleasant enough bitter. If you like Newcastle you'll like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"3.5 across the board."
"O: not a bad beer, way better than that spring thing I just had of theirs. With the different flavors in the taste than the smell, this is a pleasant summer brew especially for the fact that I wasn't expecting this."
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium amber with light foaming. See through. Light malty smell, but a little offputting. Light citrus. Small summery taste - some lemon citrus backed with a nuttiness. Fruits around the edges. Residual bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would suggest this as an alternative for the summer outing to your BMC. This beer is good, not great."
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a crystal-clear light golden color with a thin film of off-white head. Caramel and bread dominate the aroma, with butterscotch and floral hop notes. Bready with bits of toast and caramel and floral hops in the background. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Super-drinkable. Not my favorite example of the style, but a pleasant surprise and something different from the normal blondes and wheats of this time of year."
"Overall: Not your average summer ale. The herbal hops and toasted flavors make this one interesting but take away from the drinkablity/refreshing factor you want in your summer ale."
""
"Overall a serviceable light ale."
"Cheers!"
"O - a beer that is average and tolerable but not really anything overly pleasant. A tad too bitter for me."
"Taste-Light toasted malt, subtle mineral note, with some ""soft"" hops coming along for the ride. A bit toasty and lagerish upon warming, but properly chilled, is quite easy-going and refreshing."
""
""
"D- this one isn't so bad although it's getting bashed all over the place. If I was blindfolded I wouldn't guess it as a bitter, actually I would be stumped. The unchecked diacetyl and prevalent grain husk are somewhat alarming but in the end it's a well balanced, not so bad, kinda summery beer."
""
""
""
""
"Nah watered down cheap keg bitter is preferable to this shite"
"Drinkability is average. An easy drinker that you can pound, but not a lot of good tastes going on, so not a real reason to pound it. Worth a try if served it at a party, but don't go out of your way to get it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Terrible."
"A nice little English Bitter. A crowd pleaser, I'd think. Did me well. 3.5"
"This ale is more like for dead parrots and budweiser fans, save your schillings"
"RJT"
"O - This was okay. It seemed a little unbalanced. A little messy."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but there’s nothing really special about the taste. This would make a good lawnmower beer or something to pair with a summer BBQ."
""
""
""
"An average bitter at best, glad I was able to pick this up as single, it would take me months to work through a sixer of this. This might be better served at lager temps or even ice-cold"

"O: Almost feels like I've outgrown Newcastle. Used to be my favorite beer in the world, but every variation I've had is a far cry from the quality I used to enjoy."
"Definitely one of the better summer ales Ive tried. This beer is a light pale yellowish color. It pours smoothly into my snifter and has an average amount of head, lace and foam. It has a typical summer ale aroma of lemon and lager. It is a beautiful color and it is a pretty decent beer. Great for barbeques and backyard swim parties.'"
"O - Not a bad beer to have around for a social gathering, as long as the gathering doesn't really care what their beer tastes like,"
"Overall, this is average at best, but bordering on bad. I finished it, but I thought about letting the drain do it for me."
"Overall - A pretty good summer beer. And at 4.4 ABV, and the lighter flavors - this would be a great beer for throwing back a few after mowing the lawn. Thirst quenching for sure, with a pretty nice and fairly dry finish."
"a clear apple juice color with a 1 inch off-white head that fade to a film on the top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form randomly on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted grains and caramel malt. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel malt, and a slight metallic flavor. There is also a sour aspect to this beer after each sip. The bottle label says “hops and glory” but I really don’t get any evidence of noticeable hop aromas or flavors. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that really doesn’t say summer in my opinion. I am glad I picked up a bottle to try but I wouldn’t get this one again."
"newcastle summer ale has a pretty nice smell. I feel like I am detecting some chocolate barley. The color is a nice rich golden brown, it's quite good looking. The taste is rich and powerful at first but it quickly wanes to a watered down nothing. I wish it had a stronger finish. I feel like in attempt to make a really drinkable summer ale they fell a little short on what makes newcastle a good beer and that's the great fullness of it's flavor. This over all isn't a terrible beer, but there are better summer ales out there."
"O: Nothing wrong with the beer, nothing memorable either. Very drinkable; not heavy and nice balance."
"Typical summer-driven incarnation here to drum up sales (summer = light and golden, right?). Nothing wrong with that, just typical. Clear and golden, impressive head on top. Buttery nose with some spicy hop presence. Smoothness over crispness in a fluffy light body. Buttery yeast flavor is the main attraction here, with the malt helping to round it out. Hops have a quick kiss of bitterness and spicy flavor. Light bready maltiness peeks through right before the dry finish. The buttery tone eventually chips away at the drinkability; not half bad, but the flavor doesn’t scream summer to us, so perhaps it’s not so typical after all."
" Sure, the alcohol was light in this but I don't think that's why people would grab one of these in the Summer. This was nothing like the flagship from Newcastle and the bottle wasn't even clear. The familiar shape is there but that's where the similarities end. Lots of Hefe's and Summer Ales would fit the bill better than this, and unless you're a Newcastle fan, this beer is probably worth passing over."
"Overall: this is not a half bad little beer. I could definitely quaff a few of these in a session."
"Beer pours a sort of clear honey yellow color with a finger of white head that left a touch of lace in the glass and a thin white film on top. Cracker like grain aromas with a thin bit of lemon on the end. Taste follows suit with maybe a touch of honey sweetness up front and a modest bit of bitterness on the back end. I appreciate the different flavor profile that the English hops have to offer, don't get me wrong, I love Cascades, Chinooks and the like, but it is nice to have something that is not over the top with citrus and pine once in a while. Overall this beer goes down pretty easy, but doesn't offer a whole lot of excitement. Basically if I were at a barbecue and the choices were BMC or this, I would jump all over it. On my dollar? Maybe not."
"D - Had a few of these at a cookout, and rather enjoyed them. Nothing worth writing home about, but if you're in a similar situation, you could certainly do worse."
"The overall score may not impress a whole lot, but it sure beats Newkie Brown from the bottle. For that matter, it's better than many of the large scale commmercial beers out on the market. With so many wonderful (craft) options for a similar price, I wouldn't seek it out, however it would do in a pinch."
"Flavor is thin and light with a touch of bitterness emerging only after some exposure. Finish is dry and earthy once again and doesn't offer any real bitterness. Overall just a big question mark for me."
"O- Compared to other examples of the style I generally feel it's sub par. However this beer is not without it's merits. This would be a great beer to have in the cooler for those summer parties to surprise the BMC crowd without being too intimidating, while maintaining just enough something in the taste department for your self."
"This seemed to remind me of Heineken but without the skunk. The very light sweetness of the malt balanced well with the bitter. There is so much out there that is better, but there isn't anything here to hate. Standard average brew."
"D: Quite high, this is a very easy drinking beer."
"I had this one on tap last summer and never thought to write down any thoughts about it, maybe it wasn't too memorable. Pours pale yellow with a billowing white head leaves behind thin wispy lace on the sides of my glass. Aroma has a nice earthy citric hop character with light pale airy malts a bit of cracker and white bread grain action going on. Nice to see a one trick pony do something different for a changes. Flavor is light on bitterness with a touch of fruity apple notes and pale malt sweetness a very nice refreshing mass produced beer that strays from mass produced beer. Under 4.4% abv send me this in cans and I will tailgate before the concert or the big game. Mouthfeel is light bodied definitely a summer drinking beer, not a lager but a light floral/citrus lightly hopped golden bitter. Each sip is more enjoyable than the next excellent easy going mass produced English summer ale."
"D- A bit heavier than a pale ale, but lighter than most summers. Not overly fruity. Just a little bite on the back of the palate."
"Pours a clear, slightly coppery golden amber with a frothy off-white head that sticks around for a while. Yeasty, fruity aroma is fairly strong and quite appealing. Yeasty, wheaty, malty flavor has a slight woody undertone. The edgy and sassy texture makes for a nice finish to a good beer for kicking off summer."
"I was so excited to see this beer in the store... because all Newcastle makes is their brown ale. poured into glass a hazy golden color with almost no head. This beer tastes like funky carbonated dishwater... something isn't right with this beer. On the label it says hops and glory, I barely taste any hops. Was really hoping to like this beer... but it just wasn't good."
"D: This wasn't really that special. It's a unique style that I haven't tried much, but it seemed just mediocre."
"Overall - very interesting taste, even though I don't love the taste itself. It's still an interesting beer to sample."
"Not much left to say about this one. The bitterness is a little too much and a little off for the amount of malt in this one. Also some of the bolder notes don't exactly work well with the light malt. Probably won't pick this one up again, I guess I'll stick to the one and only. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"Poured a sparkling light orange with an average size white frothy head that was mostly lasting and had good lacing. The aroma was nice and crisp of a nutty caramel malt, floral hops and an earthy yeast. It tasted a slightly sweet, a little acidic and mildly bitter from start to finish with a slight malty feel at the end. The flavor had a short duration although it did leave a nice light hoppy flavor lingering for quite a while. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery yet dry in texture with a nice fizzy carbonation. Overall a tasty ale with a nice light hoppy aftertaste."
"I think this is the British equivalent of lawnmower beer. Pretty good for what it is."
"Solid summer ale. Not bold in any way, but certainly something that could be enjoyed in the cool spring or warm summer."
"There's not much to really like about this beer. Low complexity and below average flavor. I won't have this again."
"Drinkability: Gross!"
"My brother picked up a sixer of this the other day (before the full onslaught of Snow-torious B.I.G. set upon us), so I figured I'd steal a bottle for myself. A little concerned about having a summer ale in the depths of winter, but I can't decipher the ""freshness date"" on the label to ease my mind (or dissuade me from drinking it). Here goes. It pours a clear brass topped by a healthy finger of white froth. The nose comprises coriander, menthol, wheat, and light grapefruit peel. The taste brings more of the same, though the menthol is increased, and there is a strong sense of the white, fleshy part of an orange's peel. The bitterness is a bit in the extreme, to the point of puckering my lips (more like buckling them, like a boxer's fatigued legs). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, I hope this was just an old batch or something, 'cause it doesn't taste anywhere near good. Judging by the overall score, though, it may just be as crappy a beer as it seemed to me."
"a very decent summer ale. B-"
"Drinkable only in the blandest sense of the word. I see no reason to ever have this again."
"D - Well summer ales have come and gone and even if this beer hasn't improved with age it really didn't get any worse. I find that I may be able to succession this brew if I was in a need for a beer fix. A very passable summer ale."
"I could easily put away a few on a warm day, but it's far from a great beer."
"Rich and round body-wise, perhaps from a low carbonation. Relatively unflavorful on the initial sip. The swallow features a touch of hop and notable sourness. The aftertaste is blandly bitter."
"Taste is light peppery-leafy hops with hints of bitter lemon pulp slightly dominating throughout with light bitterness just dominating over light honey-bready sweetness with hint of buttery caramel. The hop elements and bitterness linger gently in the clean, lean finish and aftertaste. It is pretty good, a decent drinking beer but a bit thin in character and not at all complex. It is on the bitter side and slightly lacking character or malt presence to support this since the hops mostly come through in a bitter bite that has only short hop flavour as noted above."
"A fairly clean finish, somewhat astringent with a medium body and light effervescence. Vey good stuff."
"Verdict: Newcastle Summer Ale is a solid little brew. Thoroughly British and easily drinkable without sacrificing all character, this is one of those cheerful session beers from that side of the pond we hear so much about. I was a little skeptical going in, but Newcastle's first seasonal spin-off is a welcome addition for me."
"Pours a bright yellow with minimal lacing and strong carbination. Sweet caramel and malt dominate the aroma. Tastes emtremely sweet and smooth with a butter and caramel taste. Flavoring does not appear balanced and is a bit off. While smooth and easy to drink, the flavors do not bode well, seems way off for a form of a English Bitter, and this a poor choice for a summer beer with so many others out there."
"D: This a pretty basic bitter. It does its job in that it's light and refreshing, while still having some character."
"D - Easy enough to drink I suppose but slight hints of off flavors aren't encouraging. The vanilla seems pretty out-of-place and neither the hops nor the bitterness is large enough here."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Perfect for after mowing the lawn or any other outdoor activity in the heat of summer."
"Pours a very nice light golden color with some nice initial head and some wonderful lacing. Very nice aroma, with a nice sweet malty undertone that's enhanced by a great hop aroma -- a bit jerky and eggish. Nice taste, with a good malt/hop ratio; sweet on top with a quickly turning hop flavor that lasts after swallowing; slightly grassy and a lot of jerky in the hops. Goes down very smooth with a nice lasting hop flavor."
"DB- This one started out with some characteristics of an English Bitter but went downhill fairly quickly. The more artificial hop and adjunct flavors took over and balance was lost. It ended up tasting like some kind of tea-soda elixir, not my kind of thing. It is fairly refreshing when it is cold but I wouldn't wanna imbibe too many of these."
"The appearance and mouthfeel were acceptable (although appearance was tough to judge in a plastic cup). Drinkability score is held down by it tasting like crap."
"On tap at a concert at Wolf Trap. Tap choices were only this or fellow Heineken products Heineken and Amstel Light. I hadn't tried this... and It was hot and I was thirsty and had just paid twice as much as I should have for food, so I was ready for something to drink. That's about what I got. Thirst quencher. Pale gold in the plastic glass, 1/2 inch foam on top; slightly spritzy bubbles visible. No real smell to speak of, though initial taste was a hint of malt sweetness, grass and then some residual sweetness plus... well, that's about it. As it warmed, the flavor waned and was replaced by an annoying diacetyl buttery flavor (albeit faint) that kind'a ruined the whole thing. I wish I had ordered the Amstel. At least that has some balance to it. As much as I enjoy Newcastle Brown (and even have some in my fridge today), I think they missed it with this."
" I would prefer a summer ale to go done a little smoother and a little cleaner. Drink this one cold cold cold."
"This was an ok beer. The color and appearance were better then the taste and mouthfeel. I enjoyed it better right from the fridge, in a frosted mug. As the beer got warmer the taste depreciated. I have always like Newcastle Brown Ale and will stick to that and not its summer ale."
"This stuff is awful. I guess if I only had a choice of Bud Light, Busch, and this Newcastle Summer Ale, I might choose the Busch Beer at least half the time!"
"Pours a pale straw color with a half finger head. The aroma is faint I get some caramel malt and not much else, maybe a hint of a hop presence. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with a slight citrus hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel is low carbonation. Overall its not a hard drink because there is nothing harsh about it, however, the taste could stand to be improved some."
"D: This was bordering on awful. I'll simply classify it as really bad and suggest staying away from this beer."
"Drinkability: It was fine to have this beer with pizza, but on its own its very bland and uninteresting."
"Pours a pale gold color with minimal white head which disperses very fast. No lacing. Light-bodied with some tingly carbonation. Sweet grassy malts with a bit of hops. Astringent finish. Not impressed by this one. There's something about the flavor where it rather tastes like regular Newcastle with a bit of hops or grass."
"Newcastle Brown Ale is a decent beer, so I was interested to give Newcastle Summer Ale a try. Newcastle Summer Ale, despite its name, is NOT a decent beer. It is on par with an average American Adjunct Lager, and I don't suggest giving it a try."
"Pours a filtered light orange color with a fizzy off-white head. Aroma is a little sweaty/skunky despite this being in a brown bottle. Could just be some earthy hops, but it's not particularly pleasant. A bit of musty grain too. Flavor is light grains and dust with a hard finish, similar to mineral water. In fact this might actually even be malt-flavored mineral water. Kind of slimy on the finish, ultra-thin. Not a good beer."
"What I did get from the tasting was a pleasant surprise. Whereas there is litte hop presence in NBA there is plenty here, as promised by the information on the packaging. A spicy Fuggles element really comes through. Mouthfeel is substantial and the higher hopping level doesn't affect the strong malt elements here. For NBA they do add corn grits as the adjunct and I suspect some here also (it is alot less noticable in NSA). The ale finshes with a crisp hop finish. At the end of the day, this ends up being a good quality bitter."
"Pours a dull pale oranage color with minimal head, retention and lacing. Smell is of light carmel malts, faint floral and earth and a touch of chocolate. Taste is reminicient of a mild Newcastle Brown... the sweet carmel matls are there in lesser quantity and also a taste of tootsie roll like chocolate. Faint floral hoping also present. Certain sips tasted good, others muddled... a very mixed reaction. Medium bodied, under carbonated, slight aftertaste. A lighter version of the brown, decent beer that quickly wears out its welcome, a better option than BMC however."
"Drinkability -- The real reason I picked this up was that I drank so much Newcastle Brown in college that I figured I owed Summer Ale a shot, if only for old time's sake. I mean, the label says Hops - AND - Glory. Sadly, neither were present in this beer."
"Although not a real fan of Brown Ales, I liked Newcastle's, so figured their Summer Ale should be decent...WRONG. This poured from the tap to a very pale yellow, with thin white head and little lacing. Aroma was faint, but tried to be a floral and apple mix, and the mouthfeel was flat. Taste was bland, and the finish had somewhat of an unpleasant aftertaste. Newcastle should stick to the brown."
"It goes down easy but is just not that exciting, I'd have it again but maybe next year."
"Drinkability: Though I am a bit disappointed with it, It was nice to try and maybe have been one of those odd circumstances that made me believe it was a very mediocre beer. I'd be willing to give it another try, perhaps at a different establishment or from a liquor store."
"I was expecting more from Newcastle, this seems very new to them too... Hey keep trying !!!"
"Sampled this on draft. Appearance was light and moderately carbonated. The smell reminded me of a Bell's Oberon, with a slight citrus nose. Taste was mostly citrusy with a tiny hop presence. Mouthfeel was pretty thin, with very little finish. A decent, drinkable summer ale, but nothing really exciting about this one..."
"Overall a very weak effort."
"It's a limited time brew. Worth a shot."
"Pizza Club, a slice above the rest! in La Habra carries this beer on draft. The only real criticism is that for a summer beer, I expected a little more carbonation to leave my mouth cleaner. It has a sweetness to it, but it's not honey. Overall, it's a great addition for Newcastle."
