3.81,7,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this beer is beautiful. A vibrant, crisp, blood-ruby coloring with a slight ring of filmy, off-white head around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toffee richness and a tangy sweetness blend together for a subtle nose. Flavors are bitter forward and all over the tongue, with a subtle, rich toffee backbone that peaks its head around the corner every once in a while to keep things on an even keel. The richness almost has a syrupy quality to its flavor. A light bodied beer, this feels heavier with the richness of the flavors, but somewhat sharp with the carbonation and bitterness. A bittersweet aftertaste, with some roastiness to it. The beer has an almost smokey, light, and crisp finish. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 22, 2012"

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Product of U.S.A.Poured into a nonic a deep bronze with a thinner slight off white head,quite a deep pour for a bitter.Light toast and fruity esters mainly in the nose,a noticable hard water element is there as well.deeply fruity with a little brown sugar on the palate,not much hop presence but I didnt expect much of one either.This is a malt mavens beer here with its big fruity esters and sweetish base,hopheads may pass on this.","oberon","Jul 09, 2011"
3.6,1.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. USA-brewed bottle and sampled on July 6, 2011. The pour is a nice looking reddish-amber with a soft, silky tan head that always remains on top to a small degree. The aroma is sweet caramel and reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale with a bit more punch. The body is in the medium range with a smooth creaminess on the tongue. The taste is a strange marriage of sweet sugar and pepper tart. It ended dry.","puboflyons","Jul 06, 2011"
4.34,21.9,4,5,4,4,4.5,"I don't know what the actual price of these would be when found on the shelf as opposed to the discount bin, but I would recommend trying some if you can find then. A good session beer with the non noticeable alcohol level.","matjack85","Jun 06, 2011"
3.5,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer is a rich mahogany color topped with a head tan bubbles that settles quickly. The flavor kicks off with loads of biscuit malt followed by subtle hops. Warming alcohol notes linger. The mouthfeel is smooth, full, and roundâ€”not tongue coating but nicely comforting. A step up from Killians.","ruppert2p","May 05, 2011"

3.08,-13.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Started off with an unimpressive smell- I got a sour malty-yeasty scent. Clear amber color with light foaming. Watery light mouthfeel. Tastes of caramel and toffee, but a little on the salty side. Left a faint aftertaste of bread. Overall, smooth and easy to drink, but nothing I would go out of my way to have again.","shangwang","Mar 25, 2011"

3.73,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a clear reddish brown, with copper highlights when held up to the light. Thin tan head that clings to the glass. A hint of butter in the aroma, with some figs as well. Taste is vinous, oaky, and earthy flavors to start, with a wheat bread flavored middle, and a tea-like herbal grassy finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Carbonation is slightly high for the style. Drinkability is very good, the low alcohol and nice flavors make this a nice drinker for sure.","tronester","Feb 09, 2011"
4.02,12.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Would definitely work well as a session beer, especially with such a light ABV (3.8%) or indeed on its own.","Wattsox","Feb 04, 2011"

3.83,7.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a while even though there are better beers in the style.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 15, 2010"
3.26,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3," D- The very soft muted flavor in could mean that it is an old beer or just a bit bland. There were no off flavors noticed","rhoadsrage","Aug 30, 2010"

2.86,-19.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"D: This is an ok beer, a bit thin, some odd blended flavoring. It is certainly sessionable ABV wise, but there are better representations of the style out there.","Jayli","Jun 19, 2010"
2.31,-35.1,3.5,2.5,2,3,2,"Drinkability is not good. There is a bland taste that makes me want to not finish the beer.","BDIMike","May 27, 2010"
3.25,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Clear, dark amber with a fluffy tan head that leaves some decent lace on the glass. Sweet caramel malt and marshmallow with a touch of wintergreen in the aroma. Rich biscuity malt flavors and not much else going on here. It seems that this beer is geared towards macro drinkers who might want something slightly more flavorful than BMC. This beer is along the lines of Killian's or Honey Brown (fitting since it is actually brewed by High Falls!). Light bodied with bright carbonation. A pretty boring beer IMO.","biggred1","May 18, 2010"
3.26,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Overall- Overall this beer is ok. It's better than its brother Legbiter but again it's not a beer I'd go out of my way looking for. Not overly impressive. Just ho hum.","Beerbuddha","May 13, 2010"
3.6,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, yeast, and slight grain. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hop, pale malt, slight sweet malt, and grain. Overall, a good blend and decent aroma.","Tone","May 03, 2010"
3.12,-12.4,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a four-finger pillowy cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Crystal clear amber color. Nose is light hop and caramel. Flavor is light malt with a hop background. Brewed in Rochester, NY. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA.","jdhilt","Apr 10, 2010"
3.57,0.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D- This is a drinkable beer and high at that. This has to do with the fact that there isn't a high flavor in this. Good drinker for someone who is just starting into craft beer. Also, good for someone who wants to drink import but not something from BMC.","alleykatking","Apr 06, 2010"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This is my first English Bitter and I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of Fuller's ESB and I guess I judge all bitters to that standard. But since this beer is classified as just a bitter and not an ESB I need to rethink my perception of what this beer should be. It has hops but not to the extreme. It has flavor, good aroma, and tastes good. I am happy to have drunk my first bitter.St Patrick Rules!","ejimhof","Apr 02, 2010"

4.22,18.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I could drink this all day. The aromatics alone made me feel like I was drinking an ale in a nice meadow. This is a very floral--not overly hopped, and malty beer. Not the most complex but very good.","tigg924","Mar 23, 2010"
3.8,6.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - This makes a nice session ale and was fun to crack open on St. Patrick's Day.","zeff80","Mar 18, 2010"

3.11,-12.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, slightly sweet. Taste is of malts and hops, not a whole lot of flavor.

3.3,-7.3,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D: Even though this beer is bit mundane, it's still very drinkable. At 4.2% ABV (according to the bottle), these go down very easy. i could easily put down more than one at a time.","JMD","Jan 18, 2010"
3.38,-5.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very little to stimulate the sense of smell; slight hops. The taste was a dull hop taste, with a freshness saving the brew making it a decent enough thirst quencher. Could be drank as a session beer (low alcohol) and nothing offensive, but could get a bit boring. Reasonable.","JohnfromDublin","Mar 20, 2007"
