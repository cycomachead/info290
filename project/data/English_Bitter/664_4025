This seems surprisingly malty for a bitter with a sweet start and then a biscuity taste to the fore. Any bitterness which follows is moderate. The hop impact is more metallic giving way to a slight herbal/mint aftertaste than bitter. The taste didn't quite pan out as I had imagined from the nose, yet pleasant but not bold certainly reflects my attitude towards this beer.","charlatan","Jul 24, 2013"

Cheap at $2.10 a tall can which makes it good value as it is a decent bitter that has a fairly thick mouthfeel and a caramel-like note in the taste. Not sure why they had to add sugar but it is a beer I will go back to as it has that English hop nose backed with a strong malt backbone.","canucklehead","Jul 20, 2011"

3.03,-12.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Beer poured a golden orange with an OK head initially that floated as the pint was drank. Nose was a hint of malts and not much else. This brew was served fairly close to room tempature and it had a blast of bittering hops with a semi skunky finish. Don't know if it was because it was at a higher temp. Mouthfeel was light bodied. Drinkability was OK but would have been better if colder. I enjoy dark beers warmer but pales and bitters are not as good at room temps.","arizcards","Aug 23, 2005"

3.15,-9.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pumps an amber color with no head. The smell is slightly malty with sweetness to it, and a hint of citrus although nothing too noticeable. The taste is very surprising for a Cask Conditioned ale, usually I find them bland and not special. It retains the sweetness through the first sips like molasses with sugar. The aftertaste is great... it stays sweet on the tongue but you get hops that stay in the throat. Much better than most ales.","Toddv29424","Nov 16, 2004"

This resulted in a thin but dense and creamy head, that lasted through most of the beer and formed this lace on the glass. Slightly sharp, crisp hop aroma with grass and earth notes. Light on malt sweetness, with a hint of ripe fruit. Starts with a light bitterness that grows through the end, giving it a clean finish. Overall, the flavour's quite mild, assisted by the low carbonation.","DrJay","Dec 15, 2003"
3.65,4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a pretty average to decent English bitter beer. There are whole swathes of Northern England where it's the only decent cask-conditioned beer available at all. At 4.8% it's not really a lunch-time drink, but it certainly slips down dangerously easily. It's nicely balanced and refreshing, with a clean appearance and a light hoppy aroma.

The nose is typically of a bitter but light on the bitter taste. It has a fruity taste with a touch of hops. Not bad for an S&N brew. A pleasant surprise. Half way through I added old chedder to the mix. It went well together. Think I'll take advantage of the sale and lay a few in stock.","PiratePete","Aug 25, 2003"

4,14.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours with a serious white head that stays, leaving sheets of lace. Medium carbonation. Nice clear amber color, nose is malty.

The ABV is still 4.8%, if this is a bitter it is the maltiest, sweetest I have ever had but it does finish ever so slightly bitter.
