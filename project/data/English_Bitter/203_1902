Smooth, light-medium body with low carbonation; a little thin, but not watery. Taste is sweet, but not overpowering, with caramel and malt. Aftertaste is peppery and bready and lingers pleasantly around the tonsils. Very satisfying.","dudelove7485","Aug 21, 2011"
2.96,-21.1,3,2,3.5,3,3,"Pours a 1.5"" offwhite head. Bright clear but iced tea brown color. Smells like a wee start of skunking and not much else.

2.88,-23.2,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Well the clear glass worries me a bit. Pours a fairly clear deep amber color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly to a ring. The initial aroma coming out of the first pour were skunky, luckily as the glass sat it subsided. Smells of butterscotch, caramel and toffee very sweet smelling with a little earthy mineral bitterness. Taste follows the smell fairly well, but the skunk came back. Sweet and malty with an earthy mineral edge. Moderate carbonation, medium body with a sweet bubbly mineral water mouthfeel. The mercaptan killed this one for me. Not a bad brew, but probably not something I would seek out again.","johnnnniee","Jul 20, 2011"
3.28,-12.5,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"O: Ruddles County ESB is a reasonably good example of a traditional British cask conditioned Bitter. You could certainly do better, and when presented with the opportunity, look elsewhere. In a pinch though, this will get the job done.","Rhettroactive","Jun 20, 2011"

4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Bitter up front, but not so assertive that it is off-putting. Bread toast, some caramel, no fruit. Wood, some raw grain, toffee, and this is all pulled together by the bitterness.

4.25,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This one comes in a clear bottle- which I'm not a fan of due to quick light damage, but luckily the particular beer I'm drinking is quite fresh tasting. Pours a nice chestnut color with a finely beaded head that leaves some lacing, but fades a little too quickly. Nice earthy hop smell with gentle, creamy malt and some butteriness. The taste is similar, but with somewhat more resonant hops, with a nice lingering grassy and earthy bitterness. A little bit of nuttiness on the finish, and a very smooth creamy mouthfeel. There is a trace of copper lurking there in the background as well. More complex than it seems at first flush, this ale hangs together very well. I thoroughly enjoyed this- now do something about the glass bottle.","Georgiabeer","Mar 25, 2011"

4.41,17.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ruddles in the pint glass looks kinda like heaven. It was poured expertly and the liquid is a light shade of gold mixed in with some yellow. The head is an inch and is foamy looking and perfect. Smell is fairly common for the style, malts are up front and pale with a small citrus twist that is LIGHT. A simple nose for a simple style. On first sips or gulps rather I can tell this one is a winner and refreshing. I hope Memphis has this one come back. Taste of pale malts accented with a fairly light hopping giving off slight citrus and earthy flavor. English malts bring this back to perspective and reminds me that this is in fact English all the way. Feel is smooth and light and entirely too easy to drink. I could drinka gallon willingly. Probably my favorite bitter so far, in a style not favored by me. Excellent!!","BARFLYB","Mar 20, 2011"

It's very unique with a hard to describe kind of vegetable taste with a solid malty base. I'm also getting some tea, caramel and a touch of peppery bitter hops. A fruity sweetness adds nice balance to the bitterness of the hops. Slightly thick mouthfeel but extremely smooth and drinkable. Very unique and surprising!","beerdrifter","Mar 12, 2011"

4.09,9.1,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, the only real criticism is that, like many bottled bitters, its over carbonated for the style - perhaps more appropriate to an American style.

3.06,-18.4,4,3,3,3,3,"This is a very traditional interpretation of the style, pretty good if you favor an English Bitter, not so good if you prefer something less traditional. The beer pours a nice amber color, clear, with a smallish creamy head, a touch of lacing. The retention is there if you pour the bottle upside down to force feed the carbonation, because on its own, this beer is pretty flat. The nose and taste are very typical, old fashioned butterscotch toffee, caramel, roasted notes. There is a particularly drying element here with a slightly pungent, almost lemony, mid section and beyond. The aftertaste is the lingering pungence, minus the better parts of this beer. I'm just not sold on the style, and the acerbic stuff in this beer doesn't do it for me.","albern","Oct 30, 2009"

Bitterness was mild to moderate and the aramel sweetness was balanced nicely, having the same toasted, buttery character that was seen in the aroma. Hop flavour was more lemon and grass than sulfury. It finished with lingering bitterness as the malt faded. Moderate carbonation, medium/light bodied with a bit of dryness and a smooth, nearly coating, texture. Good stuff and an easy drinking bitter.

It's like sniffing a bag of hop pellets. Behind the hops is a slight biscuit, toast, and modest malt aroma. The taste is medium-dry, with a nice balance between malt flavor and hops. Nice bitterness. There's some toffee, and a little caramel in there as well. Medium body, and medium-low carbonation. This is a nice, pleasant, flavorful drinking beer. Much better than I expected.

I'm rewarded with a one finger head, along with a nice cascade effect (this is NOT nitro). The head quickly disperses into a nice thin layer of light tan foam, leaving thick lacing. Held up to a light, the body is a bright copper. The aroma is quite distinctive, and apparent from the moment I cracked the bottle. It has a musty, biscuity English smell to it, and a rich, potent hop presence, as well. Tasting while admittedly still too cold, I find a mild, slightly fruity, very satisfying taste. It has notes of caramel, toffee. The hops don't show too much in flavor, but they do in a slight, but growing bitterness. Not very sweet - just balanced. Medium body and low carb make it very smooth.

The smell was mild but was nice and sweet. The taste is that of malt sweetness and a welcome hops bitterness at the end, very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth, and due to the lack of carbonation it goes down well.

These are truly bitter, attacking, but not overwhelming, the taste buds in the rear of the tongue. This is a light-bodied brew, though it never tastes completely watery (again, I believe due to the hops.) This is a sessionable beer. A bit pricey for the ABV.

The aromas were a bit skunky (damn) but the nice biscuity maltiness shined through anyway. The taste was quite malty with some nice floral hops in the middle and a lovely finish as well. The mouthfeel is grainy, creamy, and smooth, and the drinkability is great as well. Probably unreal on cask...","francisweizen","Feb 09, 2004"
3.42,-8.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has all the English ale qualities. It's bitter and creamy with a mild aroma hopping. The taste is not bad. It is bitter and creamy with a malty flavor. It finishes watery; a product I think is from the clear bottle. The mouthfeel is above average. It is a medium bodied beer with below average carbonation. This is a good drinking English ale. It has some faults, but not enough to keep me away.","WesWes","Jan 31, 2004"

3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear pale copper - a bit lighter than I remember proper bitters being. The head was thin and bubbly, and settled pretty quickly to just spotty film. Nice malty nose with a touch of flowery hops. The mouth is heavy and slightly carbonated. The taste is good, sweet barley malt followed by a very nice hoppy bite. The smooth bitterness lingers well into the aftertaste, just as it should. I quite like it!","Globetrotter","Nov 29, 2003"

Maybe this beer was slightly too old, or the container was not correct being clear and all led to a bad beer. Anyways it tasted extremely hoppy but sour at the same time. Almost like a rotten tarty fruit. Pretty dry finish. My tastebuds got more used to it the more I drank but not good at all. The bottle was the riptop was pretty cool looking though.","granger10","Nov 21, 2003"

4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4," Scent is just beautiful, malty, grassy, sweet and bitter hops and earthy. Taste is strong malt then hoppy, slighty citric, bitter and herbal, very complex but smooth and well crafted. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium bodied with just enough carbonation to produce a nice head and lightness in the mouth, holds and caresses the palate. Very drinkable, a seriously great bitter.

Aroma is hoppy and grassy, very clean. Flavor is sweet malt, with some hints of corn. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Subtle malty finish. Very good all around.","far333","Oct 25, 2003"
3.13,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"A pretty good english ale, much better casked or in the bottle. I wish I could find this on regular tap, because the nitro, while smooth, kills so much of the flavor, and the beer is very delicate to begin with.","UnionMade","Oct 19, 2003"
4.12,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Came in a 500 ml green can, freshness date on bottom (only 2 weeks past it). Pours out a very appealing clear amberish orange, thick creamy off-white head capping it off. Leaves some massive walls of lace in its wake. Aroma is of sweet malt, toffee, a bit nutty (if not entirely crazy!), even the scent of raisins is in there, rounded off by very floral hops. Big hop flavour all the way around, it crowds out everything else, surprising for such a mild and complex nose. A bit of raisin on the aftertaste. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, this is a real British pale ale that packs a whallop while going down easy all the same. Definitely worth going back for more.","IronDjinn","Sep 18, 2003"
3.36,-10.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This brew poured a medium foamy head of fine off-white bubbles and a carbonated slightly dark amber colored body. It has a malt-hop-floral aroma with a slightly chewy hop-bread flavor that starts out smooth and ends with a lingering slight bitter aftertaste. It leave a most excellent clinging vine lacing on the side of the mug when you tip it that never disappeared and covered the entire side of the mug. One of the best lacings I have seen in a brew","TheDM","Jul 23, 2003"
2.93,-21.9,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Can. This brew poured an off-white long-lasting creamy head with fine-small sized bubbles. The lacing was excellent, but it did not last long.

This brew was definitely bitter tasting and it also had a lingering aftertaste to it.","hotstuff","Jul 15, 2003"
3.81,1.6,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Another sample from the Ale Mary's line up (see:beerfly). Poured a deep copper/orange with a fair bit of fog and a fluffy, thick white head.The smell was average at best and not too much interesting poking out. The taste was good though with sweet citrus hops balanced with a scotchy malts flavor for an interesting blend not too often found in a bitter. It warmed me up on an all too cold spring evening and did not overwhelm me in the bitterness. Quality brew.","GreatPondBrewer","May 28, 2003"
3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Moderately dry and with a moderately long finish, this combined with a thin watery mouthfeel to help create great drinkability., To me, a mushroom and fruit burp.

4.5,20,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Anyway, I have it in my head that this is such a fantastic beer that I am always a little let down when I taste it (maybe I am holding on too tightly to my first, wonderful memory of Ruddles). As it's available now in this country, it certainly leaves something to be desired. Those clear wide-mouth milk bottles don't do the beer any favors. And the nitro cans are a joke. An imported cask didn't rock my world either. I guess someday I will have to journey to the brewery and try it at the source. Or maybe the rumors are true and this beer has already changed and the beer I am dreaming about no longer exists.","Thrasher","May 16, 2003"
3.56,-5.1,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Premium Ale? Cloudy copper at first under a frothy cascading head. When the head settles on top the copper color clears and intensifies. Not much aroma (mild tea, sweet malt damp cellar). Amply malted and more than amply hopped with tea-like and light citrus bitterness. Some back-of-the-throat harshness (I like it!). Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkable!","BeerResearcher","Apr 19, 2003"

3.53,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color was a dark amber brown, very thick white head about a finger high. Smells very dry right from the start with a strange musty old cloth aroma, some floral hops, sweet citrus and bitterness. Taste was very dried out and a little empty, lots of floral hopiness, and citrusy bitterness. Clean and smooth, but lacking. I know its suppose to be a bitter style, that it was, but the overall dryness in the taste and feel was a little much for me. It took a while to get use to, but once I was used to it, I liked it. Not bad, just a tad overbearing on the dryness.","tavernjef","Mar 23, 2003"

3.68,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This ale poured a slightly hazy, copper color with creamy white foam characteristic of a cask pull. The foam left some lace down the glass. The smell was very modest (mild hops and some malt). The taste was not strong: malt and hops with a slight caramel sweetness and a lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean with medium body and low carbonation. The drinkability was good. A rather straightforward English bitter.","UncleJimbo","Mar 09, 2003"
3.73,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Notes: I’ve always enjoyed the 500ml can, as it perfectly fills a pint glass, with just enough room for the proper head. This definitely is a pleasant ‘down at the pub’ ale. It has a real Old Timey thing going on. It’s unrefined, honest, and meant for a session…. I think I’ll pour me another right now.","lipschitz","Mar 03, 2003"
4.06,8.3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice looking brew pours out to a medium-amber color with a thick, pancaky off-white head atop microscopic bubbles, leaving good clumps of lace. Carbonation is very mild. Aroma is unique with tons of butterscotch, toffee, burnt caramel, marshmallows, and nothing else. Probably the strongest diacetyl I've smelled in a beer. Taste is pleasantly mild with a bright, fresh, and well-balanced malt body and hop zing, fading into a tolerable metallic off-note, and ending in a smooth, very dry, and supremely mild ""round"" English-hop bitterness with more butterscotch and bready, toasty malts. The aroma was a little off-putting at first, but the taste more than makes up for it. A well-done British mild.","Mitchster","Feb 25, 2003"
3.66,-2.4,4,3,4,3,4,"Odd looking clear, short fat 12 oz bottle with a pull tab. Looks like an iced tea bottle. Clear copper color. Thin rocky head, no staying power. Smell was acidic, herbal, and more than a little medicinal.(sp?) Taste was higly hopped, tart, and super bitter, just what you would expect from a bitter. Some serious earthy qualities to it. Grass, and grainy touch to the end. Not alot of malt presence. No ""biscuit like"" tastes that would make it outstanding. Thin and watery feel a bit hot on the finish justifies the lower mouthfeel. Easy to drink however, and great with a hearty meal or as marathon session beer.","StevieW","Feb 15, 2003"
4.04,7.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Quite nice ale whith a mediumbrown color. Not much of a head at all, I tried making a big one but wasn't able to.

3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Thanks to the Coat of Arms in Portsmouth for another fine cask ale. Pale orange in color with a small head that didn't seem to last. The smell was citrus with a hint of hops. The taste starts off with malt but moves on very quickly to the hops and bitterness. The citrus taste is present throughout. I have been to London three times and this one brings me back. If we only had more pubs in the US that offered cask ales.","CharlesRiver","Jan 19, 2003"

And it is the exact same material only with a slight harshness on the finish. The carbonation is another clear difference. Maybe the bubbles were masking the somewhat assertive hop bitterness (?). Still a ""bitter"" that lives up to its name.","putnam","Nov 13, 2002"
2.01,-46.4,3,2,2,1.5,2,"Looks good, moderate carbonation, definitely has character, and they use only the four basic ingredients of beer but it is complex tasting anyway.  But the brewer uses too many hops that just keep on going.","jdhilt","Oct 09, 2002"
4.63,23.5,4.5,4,5,4,5,"I was quite surprised by two things in this beer.  One, that it wasn't skunked (clear bottle); and two, that it was so good! Clear. Very deep amber/copper - almost orange-brown in color. The head is a frothy light tan that holds quite well and leaves an exceptional lace throughout the pint. The aroma offers a light sulphur (not enough to be distracting), some grassy, earthy & citrusy (lemony) hops, and an odd - but interesting - mustiness. I'm not sure where the musty character might be coming from.... yeast? house character? And yet, the sulphur and mustiness that I would normally regard as defect seem interesting and exciting! The body is medium with a low level of carbonation that gives it a very smooth mouthfeel. The flavor offers an initial sweet maltiness ripe with caramel & toffee as well as a buttery note (diacetyl? - another normally considered defect that seems to work here), then revealing a good amount of grassy hop flavor and bitterness. The finish is dryish and lingering with a gentle matliness, and a hoppy bitterness that becomes quite lemony at points! (I'd love to know what hops they're using!) This is an excellent example of an English Best Bitter... rich, quite complex, and moderate in alcohol. At 4.7% this offers the opportunity to enjoy several in a night and yet it's full of flavor. It's somewhat rich, but not so much so that it becomes overwhelming. Massively enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 03, 2002"
3,-20,3,3,3,3,3,"An average English bitter, slightly perfumy hops in the aroma, generally dry, with a bitter finish, tasty, but quite thin in body, i think it would be good for session drinking, OK, but nothing insane.","rastaman","Sep 25, 2002"
4.8,28,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I've always been suspicious of reviews that throw around the word ""complex", but gee, this is a *complex* ale. I've only had it half a dozen times (the LCBO in Ontario has just picked it up), but it beats the heck out of the other Ruddles offerings. For a non-nitro can (or, as I like to think of it, a ""non-engineered can"") it's as fine as can be. (Get it? As ""can"" be? Chortle.)","bmacaskill","Aug 17, 2002"
4.4,17.3,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I fell in love with the ale many many years ago and I am glad to have come back to it. The complexities are surreal and oddly it does not take away from it being a session brew either. A bit in the raw but that is the way I like my ale.","Jason","Aug 05, 2002"
3.88,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"There is no way this is a bitter.  I think the bitter has got to be different, maybe this is mistake on the website, because the bottle does not mention anything about being a bitter.  The back lable states"" A classic of the the English Country brewing tradtion, smooth and rewarding with a distinctive hoppy flavor.""  This is nice mellow brew, typical of a pale ale from Britian.  Nice balance of maltiness and hops, some cookielike flavor makes this very drinkable.  One of the smoothest beers I have had in a while.","AaronRed","Apr 21, 2002"
4.35,16,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"My understanding is that this beer has undergone some changes since Greene King took over the brand from the Rutland Brewery and moved the brewing site. From what I've read regarding what it once was, it sounds amazing. What I found (present tense) while having the pleasure of enjoying this on cask, was a rich, smooth malt and subtle hop flavor. A pleasure to drink...a bitter with brilliant flavor and character.","John","Nov 01, 2001"
