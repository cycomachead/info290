Nothing special while it first touched your lips, but the aftertaste was highly enjoyable.

I think it demonstrates that you don't need excessive alcohol and brutally strong flavours to make a great beer. I can understand the lower ratings from the American drinkers as they are used to IPA that attacks the palete with an onslaught of bitter hops but that is not what the English IPAs are about.

In short, I wanted a good IPA. The first English pub I saw had this in cask, and I thought I had found my answer. I was slightly mistaken. This was not like an American IPA. It was served at room temp (which can be expected in England). It had no head, but it looked the right color for an IPA. It just did not impress me with the flavor. There was not much hop flavor in it. It is drinkable, but it did disappoint, I guess I just had too high of expectations....","aschwab","0"

Very little by way of hops, some malt, bitterness front and centre but with an astringent metallic cloying thud lingering in a non-favourable way. Overall impression not very good.

More of a Bitter than an IPA but pleasant enough to enjoy a pint or two, but not really one to seek out.","merlin48","Sep 24, 2007"
3,-4.8,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours from the can a modestly hazy dark gold to amber color with a smallish bright white creamy head that settles quickly leaving a patchy bit of lace. Nose has a ripe lime crispness, backed by malt, very little hop aroma, start has a decent malt presence, tangy at the back, light to moderate in feel at the top. Finish has a pleasant acidity, hops mild but pleasing, a bit of a paradox this beer, IPA or Bitter, nonetheless, drinkable, nice change from the Big Hopped IPAs I normally drink, quite dry aftertaste.","Gusler","Aug 16, 2007"
3.18,1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Very middle of the road brew and not much to do with hops for an IPA. The appearance was decent with a nice amber hue, a solid white head and fair lacing. A kind of cardboard laced maltiness with carmel apple sweetness in the aroma. It has a grassy dry taste but again, no real hops to sink your teeth into here. Just a biscuit with some malt, fair body, kind of slick, but uneventful. Worth a try for those not bent on a hops experience, not offensive, but not one to revisit in my mind.","Durge","Aug 02, 2007"
3.05,-3.2,3,3,3,3.5,3,"I really wouldn't call this beer an IPA. An english bitter it definatly is but a lot of people would see the IPA name and would definatly be let down. If your just rating the beer by itself then it's not too bad.","iceball585","Beers"
3.16,0.3,4,3,3,4,3,"A pint in a traditional pint glass, enjoyed at Macgreggors Jefferson Street. Somehwat too cold, very creamy white head-with tons of lace. Fresh, and bitter,drying and not all that enjoyable. Neutral aroma. Malting of bitterness an English thing. Not your American IPA.","Sammy","0"
2.5,-20.6,2,2,3,3,2,"The medium mouthfeel was appropriate for this type of beer, however the lack of any real taste made this beer a chore to finish.","kmacphail","Apr 21, 2007"

2.72,-13.7,4,2,2.5,4,3,"That said, this one poured out of the can with a big foamy, thick head that lasted most of the way. Oddly, no lace. Color is a slightly brown amber. Very mild aroma, not of hops at all, let alone IPA. Malty, dryish, slightly grassy. Flavor is the same with just a hint of a play between bitterness and sweetness. Slightly sweet finish. Very nice body, but overall relatively bland.","drpimento","0"
