"Overall:  This beer is just slightly below average to me.  Not awful, but definitely not great."

"Amber color with some hint of orange.  White head quickly retreats to a thin lace. Smell is caramel malt with no hops aroma at all.  The taste is caramel and grains with minimal bitterness.  The finish is slightly sweet.  Mouth feel is very smooth and the carbonation quite subtle.  Overall this is a nice easy to drink beer that is certainly worth a try."

"Overall: A fine sessionable beer by a local brewery. Not a bad drinking beer, but nothing to write home about. About on par, both pricewise and tastewise with Yuengling."

"Clean light amber hue with virtually no surviving head. Barley, caramel malt and some nuttiness on the nose. Stronger barley grain tones on the palate with an even stronger nutty roasted pecan and caramel malt. Very light and overly carbonated feel. Much more complex than I expected, it was not helped by a thin carbonated feel."

"Clear amber, no head. Light malt aroma, slightly specialty fruity, with a toasted malt finish. Flavor is also fairly malt fruity, finishing dry. For a hudy, not a bad beer. Floral hops surface, but there's an offputting metallic character."

"It does pour very nice and has a great head... but, I am a bottle person on this one. It is an easy drinking lager, not too heavy, not too light. Perfect with meals and anytime really."

"Like the smell, the taste is super sweet malt. Touch of hops in there too but mostly just sweet. It is very bubbly as well, carbonation is thick and heavy. While not the best amber I've had it is worth the price of admission. I got this on close out for 3.99 a 12 pack of cans. That's really hard to beat."

"O- local store did not have what I was looking for. been eyeing it for awhile. I will again."

"Sampled from bottles on several occasions. Has a caramel note balanced with rich fruity notes. Has a small head and balanced off with a smooth note of balanced malty flavor. Yuengling Lager, your match has arrived. For $6-$7 session lager, my present choice. Easy to drink, rich enough to hold your attention. A bargain."

"good brew, try one on."

"Good classic-stlye lager. Reminds me of days of yore in Riverfront Stadium with the beer guy hocking various types of low-brow Hudy. This brew is quite an upgrade from those days with a very tasty, mellow lager at a very good price. Glad to see it and its mates on the shelves in Columbus."

"One of the better can designs I've ever seen. The beer inside is pale brown with lots of carbonation. Strong aromas of fruit and cereal hit the nose quite pleasantly. Tastes of fruit and sweet, light caramel. This is a decent lager and a great go-to brew-especially when you consider how inexpensive it is."
"Overall: I've had a lot better, but I've also had more than a few worse. I could deal with this if it were my only option at a party, but not sure I'd ever go buy this for myself. The style in general is not my cup of tea, but I don't see where this is any worse than others of the style that I've had."
"Notes - A short review means this beer wasn't worth more words."

"Tastes sweet Carmel malt followed by a nice hop cut. Big mouthfeel that could border on syrupy when it's warm. This is not bad bad beer. Think Pabst on steroids. Great session beer, that can satisfy your snob tooth. Really good for what it is I say. nothing to complex, but a good effort. Would love to find this on draft!"
"O - It's a moderate to decent beer. I was craving something light and easy drinking and it hit the spot. It would be a good tailgating beer."
"Taste is also toasty, slightly sweet. Certainly richer and more full-bodied than most traditional American lagers. Not a bad beer at all, and a wonderful middle ground between lagers and ales. A solid go-to session drink!"
"Overall, I expected more, alot of hype with this brew but the overwellming sweetness kinda did me in."
"Pretty good for the price point. Very drinkable. At 6.49 for a sixer, it would be a good fallback beer."
"This beer surprised me - I had low expectations, but was pleased to find it a very good beer. Nothing overly fancy, but a nice everyday brew."
"Slightly thick and syrupy in the mouth, yet crisp and tart. Chunky tasting and overall fairly bland. It finishes with a touch of sourness"
"I had the good fortune, if you will, to sip on this right from the bottle the last time my band played the Southgate House. I've wanted to give it a fair shake since. Sure, it's nothing great but I don't find too much going on that's terrible."
"Deep gold to medium amber. Surprisingly corn gristy smell but there is a bit of hidden malty sweetness in the background. There are hints of mild scottish ale in this. It starts out with a bit of that scottish ale taste. It is rich and malty with noble hops dancing in the background. It finishes with that corn grist aftertaste. Typical adjunct amber."
"Traditional Cincinnati lager, nice to see this along with the Moerlin line making a comeback. Not the greatest lager out there, but for a $5.99 supermarket six-pack, you can't go wrong."
"Not too bad, but not great. Its another really sweet, under attenuated lager by a non-craft brewery."
"Overall I think I have found a real gem in that it is a beer that is more than average but has a real low price. It is an easy drinker that will be nice to have a fridge full of for the guys in the neighborhood. In the Cincinnati area I would predict this to be a hit. Not sure how much it will spread."
"Side note: Hudepohl Amber is the only local beer currently offered at US Bank arena in Cincinnati. Also I saw Hudy Amber at the store packaged in cans this past week. Haven't tried it canned yet."
"The aroma is bready and slightly sweet.Has just the right amount of bite and is quite easy to drink.Isnt overly filling and I could easily drink this with dinner."
"Drinkability - This is quite easy and refreshing to drink. It's mostly average to me, but it's easily tolerable. I've had better, but I've also had way worse. I probably won't pick it up again, but I would drink it socially for sure."
"Drinkability: Despite my comments about the smell and this beer being just about average, this is actually a quite drinkable beer. It goes very well with food (LaRosa's pizza in this case) and quenches nicely and doesn't get in the way of the food. It's like this beer was designed to be had with food - complimenting what is there but not getting in the way or clashing. So I could easily have another...but with food. By itself I can think of other amber/red lagers I would prefer to have instead."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with an inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both good. Aroma is bready and sweet malt, along with a little bit of caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like bready and caramel malt, and a bit of hops are noticable, too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and goes down very easy. It wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. For the style of beer this is, it's good."
" Appearance was an amber color but easily seen thru, no depth to the color.head was average and lasted a short time.My nose was unable to detect much other than a malty scent which became apparent on first sip. Overall the taste was above average especially for a beer at this price point. Mouthfeel was light and drinkability is high.Worth the money"
"Proud to see Hudepohl coming back with great products!"
"A really, really good product."
"D- Not bad and definitely sessionable."
"Non-offensive and malty focused, the beer paris well with a lot of foods but as a stand-alone, it's way too one-dimensional for any high ratings."
"This is a solid session beer at an affordable price and a great local alternative to the macrobrands."
"Had a few times straight out of the bottle, this time poured into a pint. Clear amber beer with tan head. Has that classic hudy lager smell, only without adjuncts. Taste is very malty, good body, extremely drinkable. One of those beers that is good from the bottle during a tailgate, but great from a glass at home. My new go-to beer, priced perfectly between cheap and craft."
"I just found out this is available in KY and at $5.99 a 6pk this will be my new session beer if it really is available in Lexington. Seriously good stuff."
"For those who believe this some marketing bridge between larger brewing concerns and smaller ones, all I can say is, this beer's quality and character speaks for itself."
"Drinkability - a pretty decent session beer to bridge the macro folk to the micro folk. A natural pick for this year's Halloween beer tasting."
