"Very easy to drink with a slight hint of hoppiness that nicely balances out the sweeter honey flavour."

"Sweet, crisp, fresh, very easy drinking. Citrus notes. A solid brew, but nothing spectacular."

"Draft: Poured a golden/amber color lager with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma consists of light malt presence with light sweet notes form honey. Taste is also dominated by light caramel notes with sweet honey finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. This is almost closer to a Vienna then a straight lager but refreshing nonetheless with limited amount of complexity."

"O - The honey is barely detectable. Overall this beer is inoffensive, easy to drink yet one dimensional and easily forgettable. Despite that I wouldn't refuse one if offered."

"I wouldn't look for seconds of this but I wouldn't turn one down if passed to me, just another basic brew"
"Very drinkable, but nothing complex. This beer is refreshing but bland with almost no aftertaste. Despite the name, I'm not really tasting any honey. I wouldn't buy it again (Whistler's Bear Paw Honey Lager is much better), but I'm having no problem getting through the six-pack I bought."

"This is not a bad beer but rather one of the most flavorless beers I have ever tasted especially when compared to other honey lagers. Thin mouth feel and nonexistent after taste. The beer starts out ok but gets very boring as you continue to drink since it seems to lose its flavor."

"Overall, this is a simple honey lager. It's refreshing and inoffensive, but also lacks any outstanding features. If you want an easy six pack to drink, I'd recommend."

"D - The clear cut above the average adjunct lager, but a disappointment overall. The honey flavor is almost undetectable, but the overall flavor profile is decent for what it is. Overall, not very good."
"pours a golden orange. no head retention, but leaves a decent lace. smells of sweet citrus. Tastes lightly of honey, vanilla (?), yeast, not much of a finish. Mouth-feel is very light, low carbonation. This would be a very good cross over beer for a macro-beer drinker. Very light sweetness yet somewhat complex. A good ""party"" beer."
"D: wouldnt go back to back with this as it exhaustes the palate an the throat."
"Overall, pretty nice and very drinkable. Low ABV makes it a good session beer."
"D - Overall a tasty offering, but nothing all that memorable. Easily drinkable, and non-offensive, but lacking any bold flavours."
"D: I'm not a fan of the aroma, and it was turning me off quite a bit the more I drank. Otherwise, it's a good example of the style."
"Inoffensive, in that underwhelming Canadian honey lager pantheon way, and easy enough to drink, when hearts and minds are focused elsewhere - across the table, or perhaps down the street."
"Tastes sweet, honey-like with a hint of citrus and backed by a maltiness which reminds me of soaked malt. With a thin mouthfeel and moderate carbonation."
"""A Refreshing Hint of Honey"" is plastered on the can, and I will admit that hint of honey is a refreshing difference between similar beers. And given the choice between this and other lagers, I probably would pick this. However, overall it is fairly bland, and given the choice between this and some of Granville Island's other offerings, this would be one of my last choices."
"The body and drinkability are both typical for a light lager. Overall, while this beer isn't terrible, with the complete blandness of this brew, why bother?"
"A fear of hops and an unsubstantiated fondness for honey seem to be the unifying factors amongst all Canadian micro brewers. I like honey and I like lagers (and I love mead but that's another thing) yet curiously I rarely care for honey lagers. In the case of Granville Island's, however, I'm as much enjoying this bottle as I am yearning for another one."
"Had a friend of mine pick this up for me while she was out west and I've heard a lot about Granville Island but I'm a little underwhelmed. Its a very basic clean lager with a hint of honey sweetness in it. I would have liked it to have a little more bitter on the end. Taste a lot like other honeys lagers I've had in the past certainly on of the better ones but not all that impressed. I am looking forward to the Pale Ale that I also have. All in all decent don't think I would buy it for my self but wouldn't turn it down if it was free."
"D - Definitely a good beer for the summer."
"It began with a nice, solid finger's worth of bone-white head before reducing to mere wisps. The nose, however, was pure honey. It was leaning into a beehive and taking a deep breath, albeit without the angry, stinging bees. Very pleasant. The color was a slightly hazy golden (honey) color. The mouthfeel was medium with a great honey sweetness on the palate. The finish lingered with the honey taste that had been so prevalent throughout. Now for a couple of caveats re. my review and the marks. I am generally not a sweet (malty) beer fan, but this was a very different type of sweet, not cloying and very true to its origin. Also, I like honey as an alternative to sugar as a sweetener. I feel like I really blew it by not buying more of this one when I had the choice. Traders?"
"Its unique with its sweet smell, but not 'girly'. I really appreciate that."
"Bottled version lacks the sweetness and is much more skunky and industrial than the draught version."
"Not a very attractive lager to the palate or as a drinkable session beer."
"In the end I would say that this is better than a macro, but certainly not an outstanding lager. I don't think it would be hard to get macro drinkers into this beer though, so it may serve as a nice gateway beer."
"Pours a clear golden orange, small white head forms, goes quick but leaves a nice ring. Smell is sweet and malty, apples, honey, vanilla and citrus. Taste is malty, with vanilla, citrus and yeast, weak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Flavour was pretty watered down."
"There really isn't much to say about this beer. While it isn't terrible, it isn't that great either. Might be worth a try, but I don't think I'd buy one again."
"An average offering from the Granville Island Brewery, but at least they are consistent in offering average beers. It's a clear golden colour, decent white head upon pour, but it disappears quickly and leaves a minimal amount of lacing. Aroma is crisp, predominantly floral hops, and the smallest bit of sweet malt. This possesses a pretty good mouthfeel, it's very satisfying, but the flavour department isn't really home right now, it's crisp, but the taste seems to be muted. It's actually quite refreshing, just a tad bland."
