"I Pop!, er, unscrewed the cap, just to show you the relevancy A-B/INBEV gives to its G-F consumers. An aggro pour netted a finger of foamy, light-tan head with lousy retention. Bye, Felicia! Nose had a musty, caramel apple smell. I thought of ice cream for some reason. Nowhere as sharp as Green's, but where would these guys be if they didn't polish the s**t out of their beers? Nowhere! Color was Amber (SRM = > 7, "

"Overall- really!! avoid, drink tap water."
""
"Not a good beer. Very little taste but if you have a gluten allergy then it's better then nothing....I guess"
"Nose sweet sour bread (I guess sorghum), moldiness, grains.  Taste like crappy club soda, strange tartness, cidery.  Another underwhelming Gluten! Couldn't finish this one."
"Gluten-free beer is ridiculous. A very poor selection."
"Didn't know this was made by Anheuser Busch.  It was on the list at bowling.  Not bad"
"Crystal clear, watery, sweet with a bit of citrus from the hops, but no bready malt flavours to balance this. ""Lager"" yeast doesn't taste much like lager. I know it's Gluten-free, but, eh, there are definitely much better. (i.e. Green's)"
"Simply awful.  Did not realize it was a gluten free beer mad by AB.  Better off drinking Coors Light, unless you really need something gluten free, but then why even drink beer?"
""
"Goes down smooth - clean finish - can't tell the gluten is missing...! - good beer."
"A good gluten-free beer. A little tastier and more full-bodied than Bud Light."
""
"I would have to say this is little more than a glorified Budweiser.  Has a little bit of an amber or red color, heavility carbonated and not much on the flavor side.  There is a bit of a back side taste, but I'm not sure what it is, because it's not prominent.  I had no idea it was a gluten free beer when I bought, my grocery store had it up in with the Porter's in the mixed pak selection area.  Thank goodness I only got one."

""
"is this beer?"

"This is a very Meh beer overall.  Its not terrible, but its not remarkable, either.  Its very reminiscent of other wheat beers, though it contains no wheat.  It's smooth drinking and refreshing, but does have a (hard to describe) off taste on the back end.  Perhaps thats the sorghum?  Not sure.  Its not very hoppy, though you can taste the hops.  I'm not picking up any fruit - some spice - pepper/coriander perhaps?"
""
""
"O: Not a great beer by any stretch of the imagination - I guess I should not be surprised since it is essentially a sorghum version of a BMC beer. Rather bland with something unpleasant in the finish, this is not a beer I will be grabbing again anytime soon. Much better gluten-free options out there."

"Needs more oomph -- goes down smooth -- gluten-free is an advantage, but the taste fizzles out and leaves you wondering what happened. I enjoy a bottle once in a while but there's no story to it.. All in all it DEFINITELY tastes better than what goes under the bridge."
"Redbridge from Anheuser-Busch is a gluten free brew. It pours a dark amber color. Little to no head but it is a white head. The smell is ok nothing special but good. The taste is smooth and it goes down well. There is no bad aftertaste at all. Overall, this was a good brew to drink if you want to try something different. I really enjoyed this brew."

"O - Not bad for what it is. Interesting taste. BTW, I think there should be a gluten-free style. This definitely has more in common with something like Harvester than Brooklyn Lager."

"O - I had never had a sorghum beer before--picked this one up for a gluten-free guest. I'm not too impressed. The taste is odd and it's a little on the watery side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Nope. Not doing this one again that is for sure. Not too nice drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"When I first smelled this beer, I thought the smell was off like burnt rubber and sweet. When poured, the beer was an amber color with little to no head that disappeared quickly. The mouthfeel was very light and tasted watered down with sorghum flavors, but still lacking a lasting flavor that would make me want to drink. In this case, I wouldn't choose this beer to drink with a gluten allergy."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, average for a Gluten Free. If you class it with real ambers like they have it on Beer Advocate it would be pure sh!t. I'd only give it a 2 tops. But for a Gluten Free, a 3 out of 5."
""
""
""
"Overall – Hey, not bad for a gluten free option. In this category, beggars can't be choosers. Rating by style, it's above average in my books."

"O: Really? It must be a lot harder to make GF beer than I think. This is pathetic."

"Poured out as a reddish amber color with a fizzy white head on top. No head retention or lacing here. The Smell is different, it's not exactly grainy but I think I can tell that it has something in there since its gluten free. There are some yeast aromas and maybe a touch of hops but nothing else really. The taste of the beer is rather bland in my opinion, the flavors are earthy and nothing really pops out otherwise. The mouthfeel is arbonated and light bodied, drinkable but not really all that pleasing. Overall it was decent but nothing I would purchase in the future."

"Overall - It's quite drinkable.. but for some reason I usually get heartburn from this beer."
"Pours out to a thin bubbly white head and amber color. No real head retention to speak of. Aroma is berry, apple and a hint of A-B banana and hop-skunk. Flavor is wine-like, reminds me of sherry or muscadine but is is very faint with some rubbery, skunky hops in the finish. Nothing resembling malt or cereal grain is in this brew. Mouthfeel for a low-point beer is average. Overall, this is a different taste sensation more like a watered down melomel or a cider and not much like beer, unless you count bad beer."
""
"Overall - still better than bud light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's drinkable, but if I was Gluten intolerant, I'd choose other forms of booze like hard liquor over this. In similar vein as NA beers, what's the point?"
""
"This is the gluten-free beer I'd expect from a big brewer like Anheuser-Busch. It's a poor substitute even for an average lager, but if you can't drink lager, it's at least a low-cost option. Still it pales in comparison to Brunehaut, Green's or even American competitors like Off The Grid. The mouthfeel is strange, but the flavor is at least reminiscent of corn-based lager."
""
"O - For a beer that's made with sorghum, I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. I had no clue as to what it would taste like or if it would be any good at all. It's...drinkable, and I think people with celiac would find it's a pretty good substitute for beer. I think it could use more carbonation, which would help carry the flavor and keep this beer more exciting as you drink it. The farther into the pint I get the more my tongue says to my brain ""yeah, I get it."" But that's a small criticism compared to the freedom this offers to those with celiac. 3.0"
""
""
"This beer doesn't come across as extremely watered down and it delivers a well balanced flavor and little to no hoppiness."
"Won't be buying this again, the worst of the gluten free beers I've tried."
""

"O: Interesting beer – picked this up because it intrigued me. It was decent but nothing that I would grab again."

"O: Can I please have my wheat and/or barley back? Sorghum just doesn't cut it in the flavor department. Honestly, if I had a gluten allergy, I'd still stay clear of this beer. There are better alternatives that actually have taste and flavor besides pure sorghum. At least the big boys show some effort in making beer for those with such an unfortunate allergy as gluten, but it's not a very good one. People with these allergies can still taste, ya know"
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but I obviously wouldn’t seek it out at a bar."
"It's a below average beer."
""
""
""

"O: By now, I've had most of the major gluten-free beers (we have a friend with Celiac's, and as a brewer, I'm curious about sorghum-based beers). I truly do believe that the American lager styles simply don't work well for gluten-free. The Belgian styles I find to be better, and I believe that somebody can make a decent sorghum stout, but for some reason the market seems to be driven by people wanting a gluten-free Bud."
"My second gluten-free beer, following the somewhat surprising New Grist. Let's do this: It pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose is faint, comprising wheat, light caramel, and grass (as far as I can tell). The taste is a combination of fruity sweetness (mostly orange, but with a bit of white grape and pineapple syrup) and spicy grain (like pepper- and cardamom-laced wheat). A fakely sweet (think candy-style sugary here) twang hangs over the finish. The body is a very light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I can't say I enjoyed this beer, but I didn't hate it, either. The smell is almost nonexistent, the flavor combination is sorta confusing, and the body is too light and fizzy to really be enjoyable. That said, not much is actually offensive about this beer. I just know I don't want another one any time soon..."
"With around one percent of the population afflicted with celiac disease, it would nice to see more brewers step up and brew gluten-free offerings."
"On the whole, a pretty average beer. Lawnmower beer at best for someone that does not require gluten free."
"Redbridge has a thin, off-white head and a clear, amber-gold appearance, with lots of streaming bubbles and no lacing. The aroma is grassy and sweet. Taste is an odd combination of molasses, sweetness, grass, very slight hops, other neutral grains, and things I can't even describe. This is a weird one. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Redbridge finishes crisp and clean. Overall, I might have to get used to this one, not that I'd ever have it again, but I rate it average. I guess it's okay for someone who can't have gluten."
"O: I hate you Bobby. This was awful."
"Poured a meager 1/4"" head which almost immediately disappeared completely. Looks like a clear glass of iced tea. I detect next to no smell, even after it warmed. Taste is a fairly standard BMC profile and they worked into it that slight zing in the aftertaste you get from the Anheuser family. There was also something I found hard to describe in the taste which in my notes I put down as ""from a dirty glass"" but which I think another better described as a hint of watered down maple syrup. All-in-all, if you can't have beer due to gluten allergies then I'm glad they made this for you. But if you don't have that kind of allergy then skip this for virtually any other real beer."
"Overall, this is not a good beer. It's better than most Anheuser-Busch products and it's much better than most gluten free beers. Having no allergies, it's not one I want to try again."
"Overall I would say I hated this beer. If you cannot have gluten, you should definitely be a home-brewer if this is the type of beer there is on the market for you."
"Overall a weird beer. It's not like it's a drain pour just weird. Will probably never drink this one again."
"O - Not a very good beer. Its not horrible in the sense that it taste bad....just not good."
"O - I don't have any gluten allergies, however, for people that do, this beer is surely a blessing."
"The aroma had a pleasant sweet earthiness to it and a bit of spiciness in the background. The flavors were the same, nothing special. The body was a bit thin. Drinkability was OK, but not notable. Overall, a surprisingly decent beer. It won't ever be my first choice, but, to quote my friend Amber""it's palatable"". If you have a gluten intolerant friend steer them towards this."
"This is interesting. It's not a bad alternative if you can't drink beer, but it's not something I'd pick up."
"M/O. The mouthfeel is a crisp smooth clean feel that finishes off dry. While not a great beer, it is not too bad and I would tell anyone who can't have wheat or barley in their diet to give this beer a try and decide from there if it is worth a second buy."
"D - Very, surprisingly good! This has a mild malt character, but this is really pretty impressive for a gluten free beer. More than that, there is a well balanced, mild but readily apparent spicy hop character that goes a long way towards adding depth to a relatively light beer. In the final analysis, this is an unusually good gluten free beer and it may actually be the most enjoyable AB product that I have tasted."
"Redbridge is a very clear golden beer with a white head that fades to a thin film and leaves decent lacing. It has a faint, sweet, sorghum aroma with a note of grass. It's very light bodied and watery with a chalky finish. There's hardly any flavor at all. There's a light sweetness in the finish. It tastes like non alcoholic beer. Nothing to see here; move along."
"Almost no head, deep gold clear sparkling body. Very little lacing. Nothing outstanding about the taste, almost like a light lager with a little more hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light, watery, fizzy. Not bad, an alternative to the everyday American lagers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Redbridge is very reminiscent of a macro pouring a gold color but did have lasting lace. The aroma was of vanilla, orance, and grass. The flavor was mainly citrusy with ginger showing through as it warms, slightly souring in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and may pair well with fish. Overall this beer is just okay, not recommended."
"Not bad, but definitely different. Could be good around a campfire in autumn."
"D/O - i wont lie... this is drinkable. this is not the worst beer AB has ever came out with. Surprisingly enjoyable to a degree. but watery non to say the least."
"Poured a clear medium amber with virtually no head and no lacing at all. The aroma was of a cereal malt, resin hops and a horse blanket yeast. It tasted lightly bitter from start to finish with bearly any flavor at all. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a very flat carbonation. Overall it is typical brew from Anheuser-Busch InBev and will most likely be my last Gluten-free beer as well."
"From 12 fl. oz. bottle sampled on March 1, 2011. The pour is a golden pale yellow with nice clarity and a short-lived white fizzy head. The aromas tend to be of flour and light yeast. The taste is missing something and seems like of bland although there is a thin hop ending."
"This beer is a light amber color with no lacing and little head, it has a sweeter aroma with cood carbination, it has a watery taste because its gulten free it has an off flavor or less flavor then a regulair beer, overall if you had a problem with gluten this might not be bad but if you dont and you enjoy your beer you should go for a different beer"
"Not very good, and it certainly isn't Hair of the Dog Dave, dammit."
"D- very watery, I had a hard time."
"D - As this is the only gluten free beer in the area, I would hate to have Celiac disease."
"Verdict: I can't really come down too hard on this beer considering it has a limited ingredient list for a reason, but there is certainly room for improvement. The taste is super light, lighter than most beers I have ever tried. Blame it on the Sorghum, I suppose. I was hoping that there could be something else here; roasted, smoky flavors, some citrus zest, some chocolate... anything. But I feel like the beer is weak in flavor. For light beer drinkers or cider lovers, it's all you may ever need. Sorghum drinkers, enjoy. C (2.8)"
"D: If you need to, I guess. I'd personally rather have stomach cramps and a real beer."
"I enjoy this beer quite a lot, and I'd gladly drink it even though I have no gluten allergies. It's easygoing, but certainly more flavorful than the typical macrobrew. I'm really glad Anheuser-Busch tapped into this market. As a quencher on a warm day I'd grab one of these in a heartbeat."
"d: This was a good bit better than the Green's ""Tripel"" I tried, but I hope for her sake that her stress is short lived."
"One finger head of loose bubbles with streaky lace with some cling. Color is a 7 on the SRM chart. Smells of molasses, and clover. Taste is sweet molasses, with some bite from the hops. Very watery feeling in my mouth. I guess it is better than no beer at all and better than many I have tasted from this brewery."
"D- It's something of a reasonnable option for gluten intolerant people. Not a great beer by most standards, but it would be better than nothing and it certainly could be worse."
"Commendations to Anheuser-Busch for supporting the growing number of people with gluten (wheat or barley) allergies. However, don't let that dissuade you from trying this one, as it stands on its own merits. Pouring a nice red-amber with average lacing, this sorghum-based beer has a sweet molasses nose, and a rich and malty flavor. The hops content seems subdued, pushing this one towards an overbearing sweetness rather than a well-balanced mix. Still, an easy-to-drink beer, and certainly steps above mainstream American lagers."
"Drinkability: This beer is downright terrible. The only reason I'm giving higher marks than I should is that I recognize that this beer is meant for people with a gluten allergy, not regular consumers. If I had a gluten allergy, this beer would be a lifesaver. That said, as a stand-alone beer, this is pretty terrible."
"D: Just not very pleasant, it is missing something.... Like half of all the good stuff that makes beer.... beer. I know this is Gluten Free and good for that. I just tried this because I've never had a Gluten Free beer and this maybe my last.... Not a great beer for my taste."
"Light and crisp, this went down easy but just lacks any real flavor. It wasn't bad, just not something I would seek out again."
"D: Deffinately drinkable and I will recommend this to people with gluten problems."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't anything to write home about at all- this is the second gluten-free beer I've had and I'm really glad that my body has no problems with glutens. This beer isn't bad, but not really worth anything, either."
"Redbridge drinks like a macro with the price tag of craft. Sorry to say it, but I think I just needs gluten in my beer."
"Feel/Drink: Light mouthfeel, drinkablity isn't bad at all. I'd be happy to drink this if I had a gluten alergy."
"An acquired taste, but if you have celiac disease, this would be your savior right now. Set aside all of that and Redbridge is a most interesting beer, and worth a try if you like your beer on the sweet side. We could see pairing this with a slow-cooked pot roast and roasted root vegetables."
"Redbridge pours a light caramel color with a transparent body and an interesting nose that combines caramel and light molasses. There is virtually no head of foam on this beer and the small amount present disappears in less than one minute. The flavors I notice are that of light fruit, mostly apple; sugar, caramel; light cider; light hops; and light grain/bread. I'm not really a big fan of this, but I believe it was my first gluten free beer."
"12 OZ. brown bottle, poured a light amber/orangey copper color, little head that disappears fast to nithing. Aroma i guess is the Sorghum? Ive never had anything like this before so i cannot tell. It smells medicinal and lightly woody, caramel malt almost. Taste is very medicinal and some wood going on with a almost metallic blood note. Very unique and different taste, it isnt bad just different. Feel is on the lighter side with alot of carbonation hitting the tongue. Easily drinkable and sessionable, but i can see this taste being more love it or hate it. Give this a try its very interesting, ill have to take a look for more of this style of beer."
"Not having tried the gluten free beer style before, if unable to drink ""regular"" styles, I could find these refreshing on a hot summer day. Maybe even a cold winter nite."
"You know, I don't have a gluten wheat allergy, so I don't really see why I would even try this. But my roommates girlfriend does, and this was brought home and I gave it a go. It has a carbonated bubbliness to it. It's very alcohol tasting. Some lime in there? I'm almost thinking gin and tonic in a beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has A caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and yeast. Taste is of hops, some notes of citrus. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a little different and not a bad beer at all."
"I would buy it again if I was on a gluten free diet."
"I had bought this by mistake and when I noticed the ""Gluten Free"" and realized who the brewer was, I thought Oh oh. Redbridge was surprisingly good though. Better than a lot of other craft/import lagers (red or otherwise). Don't get me wrong, this is not my new go to beer, but I find it very respectable."
"A decent and flavorful Amber. Worth a try."
"[I must say I love the label design of this beer. Very well done. (Not the one pictured.)]"
"Taste: There is a imitation sweetness with an aftertaste similar to a diet pop. Very bizarre taste which is hard to describe."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several other organic beers that I would pick before this one."
"I was expecting something different and original and it sure was different but I will not be buying it again."
"Taste is interesting, quite earthy with a fair amount of leafy hop flavor. There is definitely plenty of sweetness there, but it is not overly distracting. It has some grape flavors in it and lends itself a mild wine-like characteristic. Without the malted barley, it really loses quite a bit of the qualities that make a beer a beer. It is far removed from an amber ale, but I feel that I am rating this one more as a gluten free offering. Way better than the only other gluten-free beer I have had. Unfortunately, I think if I was intolerant to gluten, I would not drink any beer at all and probably stick to wine."
"An okay beer. I guess it would do the job if I could consume gluten since its a sorghum beer. Better than nothing. But let's just say I'm glad gluten doesn't bother me!"
"Overall its much better than I had anticipated, a little to thin to be good, but not bad."
"Clear light amber with a splotchy eggshell head that leaves a little lace on the glass. Faint maple cream smell. The flavor has a mild kind of yeasty, molasses sweetness to it with a mild smack of lemony hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and easy enough to drink. This is easily the best of the three or four gluten free beers I've had, this at least tastes like beer."
"I have been struggling with a wheat allergy and consequently though I am not allergic to rye and barley per se, I definately feel better when I don't consume them. Having said all of this I tried a Redbridge red lager gluten free beer last night. I was surprised how much I liked it. I am generally not a big AB fan though I recently tried the Great American Ale and liked that as well. They have done a first rate job here. Though I would never confuse this for a craft brewed specialty beer or ale it tastes surprisingly good. The taste falls between a pale ale and a classic lager flavor, malty, mildly citrusy with caramel notes as well as a mid range hoppy finish. I would recommend anyone who finds they have gluten/wheat issues to give Redbridge a try!"
"I was told by another customer at my local beer store that this beer ""is kosher for Passover because it doesn't have any yeast in it."" Well that's fun to know! Pours a clear light orange with a small white head. Aroma of dough and sickly sweet malt. Flavor is actually better than I expected. Some sweet fruits, honey, and doughy malt. Palate is thin but not terrible. Drinkable. Ok, I am still very glad that I'm not gluten-intolerant but this beer wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be."
"Drinkability - This is an OK beer but considering the gluten-free circumstances this is probably a really good beer."
"Pours a clear light red brownish colored body. Smalllish cream-colored head, diminishing. Good lacing, looks thick and sticky. Sweet almost grainy taste, almost like rice or corn, vegetably. Malty and bitter at the beginning. Almost like a fake sugar aftertaste. Drying. Okay. Bitter hoppy aroma. Some of that off-flavored ""maltiness"". Too sweet tasting."
"Overall, this was a very unique beer. I am glad I got it from a buddy as I would be disappointed if I had bought it, as it wasn't something that pleased me. I still have a nasty aftertaste left in my mouth."
"D: This is pretty unpleasant. I finished the bottle, but I wasn't happy about it. I don't know if it's a problem with barley-less beers in general or just A-B's effort, but I wouldn't try this again."
"Had a bottle from a mixed case recently. In the world of gluten-free beers, Redbridge is certainly blander than the rest, but it's also the most drinkable. I often find there's a cloying sweetness in a lot of the celiac beers, but this simply resembles a light amber ale. I guess considering the source and style, this isn't a half bad beer."
"Pours a clear, golden amber color. 5/4 inch head with slight retention ad decent lacing. Smells mostly of a sweet grain (I'm assuming rye). I guess it fits the style - I'd put it in its own category of a rye beer. Has a smooth and crisp mouth feel with average carbonation. Tastes mostly of a lager with a sweet rye flavor. There's also a distinct metallic/acidic aftertaste. Overall, a little weak in body and the aftertaste is slightly odd."
"Other comments: This is not a bad beer for a non-malt brew, but there's a reason malt is used in beer: it makes it taste good! I wouldn't drink this beer unless I had to for medical reasons, though."
"I was in no way impressed by this, I guess finding out on the back-end that it was from AB proves that I'm not a snob about AB; I just don't like them. (with a few rare exceptions)"
"Now for the bad news. I believe I have had a reaction to redbridge multiple times. I don't know if there is contamination, shared facilities, shared grain storage, or if its all in my head but redbridge means a gluten reaction for me and I won't drink it. Give it a shot but use caution."
"D; It's always kind of funny when a brewery that makes terrible beer tries to make a good one. Usually it turns out mediocre. Just like Redbridge. This is just an uninteresting piece of brewing. Stick to what you know, Anheuser-Busch, which is making bad beer."
"This brew pours a clear copper-amber color with a medium thick and fizzy off-white head that burns off quickly. Spotty lacing. Aroma of grain and bready malt. Light-bodied with a mildly bitter hops character, and flavors of sweet malt and caramel. The finish is short and lightly bitter. Below average and completely forgettable overall."
"D- Not something I'd buy or drink on a regular basis. Would only drink it if it were the last available chioce."
"Having tried a number of gluten-free versions of normally gluten-containing products, I can sincerely say that Redbridge is fairly successful endeavor. Many small brand, expensive rice/amaranth/potato/arrowroot/whatever breads and pastas are far worse gluten-free versions of their products than this beer. While this beer gets a C compared to the richness of other beers, it's a great gluten-free product from a major brewer. Kudos to Anheuser-Busch."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours an amber color, with a minimal frothy, white head. Aroma is caramel, slight hop nose. Flavor starts all sweet, with a touch of a bitter hoppy finish. Not all that bad for a sorghum beer. watery finish. Nice for those with gluten issues."
"Appears a light toasted malt hue of amber caramel tones, head is slightly off white forms thick after a heavy pour large bubbles fizzy pour going on. Aroma has a faint sweetness with a touch of cascade hops going on mild citrus flow going on. Flavor actually isn't too bad a touch of candy caramel sweetness some rock candi sugar like notes as well but never cloying. Really plays well without any grains actual hop flavor I'm impressed not as bad as I was expecting and more affordable than the Green's line up. If I had celiac this beer would definitely do the trick if nothing else was a possibility on it's own I would drink this over Bud any day. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body definitely has a sturdy level of carbonation but it's not over done this is a well engineered beer. Drinkability overall, let me reiterate not bad enjoyable definitely better than a Budweiser, go for it."
"D- Not something I'd drink often. Even if I could not tolerate gluten I'd probably choose a dry cider over this. Though this is probably one of the better things coming from AB and I'd recommend checking it out if you have issues with gluten."
"D: OK drinkability, but nothing to write home about. The taste was decent, but the mouthfeel was average at best. Worth a try if you want to, but nothing I would highly recommend."
"This beer pours a clear light red color. The head is one inch in height, fluffy, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is of bread and corn, and is very faint. The taste has a candy sweetness that vanishes quickly into nothing. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, but is fuller bodied than other macros. Overall, this beer is palatable. I could drink this again, and would rather have it than almost all of the other AB offerings."
"D: A good alternative for those who suffer from celiac though would not satisfy the big hearty beer enthusiasts (stout, porter, ipas). A malty textured ale at best but deserves some props even if it is AB."
"Drinkability - I didn't care for it, pretty much water with a bit of bitterness to it...try it just to say you tried a sorghum beer, but don't get a sixer"
"I have never had a wheat and barley free beer so I decided to try it out for shits and giggles. Had it chilled in a pint glass. Poured a lucid yellow color that turns orange in the light and virtually no head. Smell is of lights hops and a slight sweetness, the sorghum? Taste is a little musky hoppy with some slight sweetness and a crisp fimish. I guess it would be ideal for anyone allergic to gluten. Poor bastards!"
"Overall this was a good alternative for people that cannot drink for dietary reasons, however for me, it was not a good alternative and I do not think I will be heading in this direction again. It was just too bland for me, nothing really going on with it. Could be worse though, and still better then ,most of the macro stuff you see."
"Well, it's okay - not that bad, not that good. If I was stuck to a gluten-free lifestyle, I'm sure I'd enjoy it and be thankful that it is so widely distributed."
"As it warms slightly, the biting carbonation reduces a little and it becomes more palatable."
"i was moderately surprised. with no other beers to compare it to (that i've sampled), i'd say good job. my go to beer if i could not have gluten."
"D-Really not that bad, I could drink a couple these. It is certainly better that bud, bud light, mich, etc."
"Drinkability is average. Not a bad drink, but not one I'd go out and purchase."
"Drinkability: Not as bad as I heard but I don't plan on buying it again."
"A man can not live on gluten alone, but I probably won't actively seek this one out again. For those with Celiac Disease, or others with a gluten-free diet that couldn't normally partake in a beer this is a nice alternative."
"This is not an amber or red lager...This is an awful foul tasting specialty grain sorghum beer. Poured clear copper with little head that disappeared fast. Very little smell and what little there was, smelled of a kind of non alcoholic beer type maltiness. (Think Kaliber) Wow, taste is bland, and an immediate watery finish. This has no redeeming qualities other than not being made with barley, I guess, if you're allergic. Avoid like the plague."
"D - This is pretty much just an average beer this could be a session beer if choices are slim. Its the first gluten free beer that I've had and its not bad its just average."
"D: Drinkable enough. I'd be willing to drink it again if it were presented to me. I wouldn't buy it for myself, however."
"D - This is an okay brew. It's way overpriced. Thank goodness I'm not allergic to wheat or barley."
"I won't be buying it again."
"Quite drinkable and refreshing. Went really well with a nice steak and shrimp dinner."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability: Interestingly different, but not something I will seek out again."
"Drinkability is considerably better than I'd expected, although the seems nothing like a lager, bearing more of the characteristics of an ale. Altogether I'd say that it makes for a good tipple at the end of a long day. On the other hand I am not affected by celiacs disorder, and those who are might prefer a more readily-available Bud Light. But I'll raise one in Anheuser-Busch's name for doing their part to do some good for a growing market segment."
"Drinkability: Those poor celiacs have enough problems without having to deal with this."
"I wouldn't classify it as a traditional American Amber Ale though. It's made with Sorghum and should be classified separately, similar to how wheat beers are classified. Very drinkable though and if I had Celiac disease, I would probably drink this beer. It's different but it doesn't make me want to pour it down a drain so that's a good thing."
"Extremely drinkable for a gluten free product. Richer ""malt like"" profile then any of the other GF beer sI have tried so far. It's certainly worth a try."
"This beer pours a deep copper in color with a mild white head. At first waft all I smell is a metallic note. I smell again and get a mild hit of green apple. The taste is very similar to the nose, quite mild however I do taste an apparent green apple flavor. The after taste is that of the bottle cap, metal! Body is light with a nice tingly effervescents. Not really for me but if you can't have wheat or barley, drink up!"
"The beer pours reddish amber with a modest white creamy head with the lace a fine coating upon the glass. Nose is all malt, well a very slight hint of hops, crisp and clean. Start has a pleasant malt profile; sweet with a tinge of bitterness at the back, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has a determined acidity, the hops very mild but present and accounted for, somewhat sweet, quite dry aftertaste, not a total drain pour, but did not appeal to me, but there certainly could be an audience."
"Overall I'd say that it isn't a bad beer at all..and if somebody handed me one I'd drink it and thank them for it, but I wouldn't seek it out for myself"
"Copper/amber coloured beer, small pure white head. sourish vinegar like aroma, reminds me of apple cider Again a weak apple cider flavour,but for some reason iits refreshing, well carbonated and slightly bitter after the sour. Nice enough mouthfeel. Not too bad at all..this is my second sorghum based brew and i like them well enough."
"Mouthfeel is fine, a little dry. Drinkability is good, even for an amber ale, I could drink a few of these. Sorghum or not, its one of A-B's better beers."
"Drinkability: OK, not worth purchasing unless you have too. Even then, if this is the best one can do, I'd skip drinking beer."
"They might be slowly headed in the right direction with a beer like this, but theres a lot of room for progress yet."
"Not something you'd expect from AB.A pretty drinkable beer with a slight fruity aftertaste.This beer almost reminds of Sam Adams cherry wheat,although there is no wheat in the beer.I would recommend this to my friends and I definetly will be buying again!!"
"If this was all I could drink I could used to yet, but I have other choices."
"Drinkability: Nope...won't try again. WAY to odd of a feeling at the end of the drink. The taste seems off and the mouthfeel just lingers in a very bad way"
"Drinkability: One of the strangest beers I've ever had - not something I would choose to drink. I'd rather have a glass of water."
"D: All I have to say is I am glad I'm not allergic to wheat gluten. But not a terrible offering from Bud, better tasting than the flagships but this is not one I would want to pay for again."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear copper color with an off-white head. Obviously since the beer is made without malt and wheat, it has a unique aroma. It is really is hard to describe but there is no familiar malt smells, just a sweet and slightly chalky aroma (that is the best I can describe it). The taste much like the aroma is pretty faint and lacking the malty characteristics that I love in beer. There really is not much flavor to pick up on, and the little bit of flavor that peaks through is not very good at all. Overall, I am not a big fan of this brew. I know and understand that this is a gluten-free ""beer", but I am having a hard time justifying to myself that this is a beer. Thank goodness I do not have gluten issues. Not recommended."
"Overall- For celiac sufferers this would be a decent choice. Sorta bland and weak for those of us who don't suffer."
"overall this is the first gluten free beer that ive had that i know about, and it isnt too bad"
"Pours a bright amber with lighter highlights and little head. The aroma is definitely un-beer-like -- kind of vegetal, with a fake maple syrup kind of element and no hops I to speak of. On the palate, metallic sweetness with a bit of sulphur and a touch of watery sourness. Strange but not disgusting, which is a decent achievement for a gluten-free beer. Mouthfeel is nice, with a light body and good portion of carbonation. Some acidity that is out of place in the style. Overall, this is only an average beer (at best), but for a gluten free offering it isn't bad."
"Overall, not that bad for what it is made to be. I wont ever buy it again, but i think it is decent for people that can only drink it."
"Interesting to see a megabrewer trying to act like a micro. Is there an issue with their more well-known lines? (He asks with a huge smirk upon his face) Maybe they need to toss all their old recipes and start over instead of tweaking them and putting a new name on them. My two cents."
"Appearance is a crystal clear light red. Head is present (a plus) although small and commercial looking. Flavor is faint and watery but lightly hoppy. Mouthfeel is slick and thin, like too warm public swimming pool water."
"D - I've never had a gluten-free beer, nor am I generally a fan of the macro's faux-micro offerings. This one, on the other hand, was surprising. It actually has a bit of flavor, and, when cold, could be fairly drinkable."
"This is not bad. Unique flavors and close to thirst quenching."
"Drinkability- I didn't really care for it, but this beer would be very nice for people who are gluttan intolerant."
"I'd have to say this is a pretty decent beer, I wouldnt go out of the way for it, but would drink again for sure."
"Overall: Not bad, but not great, where this beer shines is as a real alternative for celiacs. Though its still too pricy for a gettin hammered beer, its tasty enough to be enjoyed, at least as much so as any decent macro. This beer is interesting for only two reasons as far as Im concerned. One, its sorghum-based, and two, its a good alternative for celiacs."
"Overall, this is great! I'm not sure what kind of flavors can be obtained from sorghum, but the fact that it exists open a whole new world. Nothing bold, rich or complex. Just new. It's like drinking a beer for the first time. Just different..."
"Redbridge pours a copper color with a thin white head from brown twelve ounce bottle. Very mild grainy aroma. Not bad, kind of a sour taste is imparted by the sorghum. I actually kind of like this one, it's not bad considering it's an AB product, and gluten free at that. Definitely worth a try, it's the best sorghum based beer I've had."
"The warmer this got, the harder it was to drink. This beer is a terrible amber, might've passed better as an American Macro. This beer makes me very glad I have no gluten issues!"
"Worth a try."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a thin head that quickly fell. The smell is faint and slightly sweet. The taste is hoppy and sweet. This beers flavor seemed to be heading somewhere, but tastes like it got watered down in the process. It has a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin. Overall, this isnt a particularly bad beer, it is just lacking."
"Redbridge was an amber color with good clarity. It had a white head that quickly dissipated to a thin ring with very little lace. The aroma was light with a touch of hops. The taste when was not very appealing and reminded me of a bad batch of amber ale I brewed at home a couple years ago, sweet with a wierd twang. It was fairly light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is poor due to the flavor. If you don't have celiac disease, avoid this beer, If you do, it may be worth a try."
"I have people close to me with gluten issues who can't drink beer, and I'd be more than happy to have this on hand for them and to share a glass or two as well. It's a well made and interesting beer, and I might even go as far as saying that it's one of A-B's better productions. Hopefully it gets enough market share to be a constant option for those who can't have barley and wheat based beers."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer was a gold organge color. It had lots of bubbles stuck to the glass and a frothy head that decayed rather fast. Taste was a little sweet but not too bad. We thought the beer was very drinkable. I will buy again."
"D: I personally don't know if i'd revisit this brew, but it's not a bad beer. Besides being gluten-free, what else is it? Does the lack of gluten result in fewer carbohydrate or calories or something? This is a beer of mysteries, wrapped inside an enigma, around a riddle. Different. Worth trying."
"Poured a coppery-red. Nominal head. Vague aroma hinting at caramel and apple cider. Mouthfeel was thin and a bit watery. Caramel malt flavor that called to mind an ale made with canned malt and a Mr. Beer kit. A bit of apple-ish flavor in the background. Finish was clean to the point of being flavorless. While all of this sounds bad, overall, the beer was acceptable, just not good."
"Pretty much a standard lager-- I guess I was expecting a sorghum beer to be weirder than this is."
"Taste is clean and somewhat neutral with some fruity notes, possibly pear. A touch of sweet & sour resonates. The mouthfeel is similiar to a mildly carbonated glass of seltzer water. This beer is somehwhat refreshing and unique. Probably not a beer that I would look for again, but a decent alternative."
"I had not seen this beer before, figured I'd try it. Pours a clear amber color with some head. Smells kind of sweet with some earth tones. Taste... hmm.. A bottle beer that tastes like a rusty tin can? It tastes & feels flat as well, maybe the store shook it up or left it in the sun for too long. By the end of the glass it wasn't quite as offensive, I picked up some cereal grain tastes, but definitely not enjoyable. I won't be having another, too bad I purchased a six pack. I'm very shocked at the high #'s for this beer unless my beer is just a fluke and maybe it was left out too long in the sun or something."
"This beer, on balance, is sad."
"Not that bad a beer. It'd easily pass as a generic red/amber beer at many microbreweries. For people with celiac syndrome, an easily available, nationwide brew must be a great thing."
"The beer pours an amber color with a towering offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a very dry lager yeast scent with little ""malt"" or hop aroma; yes I know this is made with sorghum. The taste is decent. It has a smooth ""amber lager"" taste that goes down easy, but it finishes way too dry for my liking. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. I love the idea here, but the end result isn't very attractive. It's one and done for me."
"I certainly had low expections for this beer, so it suprised me when I actually thought it wasn't bad. There is enough flavor here to keep it interesting and everything is well balanced. If you were curious to try a gluten-free beer this one is readily available and not bad at all..."
"Pours a three finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor has a hop sharpness, sweetness in background. Drying soapy aftertaste. Glad I bought only one bottle. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"If you've got a gluten allergy, this would certainly do. But it's not exceptional, and there's little fullness to the flavors and no real depth. Drinkable for sure, not a drain pour, but not much happening otherwise."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light copper-amber color with a thick, foamy head. Smell is slightly sweet, a slight amber presence with a bit of earthy hops. Tastes like an average red, decently bittered... not bad. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a foamy carbonation. This is a decently drinkable beer, I was surprised to find that it wasn't too bad. I would buy this over Bud, which isn't saying much but it is a step up. I can't imagine not being able to drink the wide variety of beers available because although not bad, this beer is no substitute."
"Not enjoyable at all for me although it is hard for me to hate this beer outright as A-B is trying to give an alternative to those who must/desire to mainatin a gluten-free diet. For that I commend them although I for one consider myself fortunate to have no such restrictions upon my diet after trying this."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Very good AB. I'd say this is better than most your stuff, refreshing. Not something I'd get again, but I respect this for what it is."
"D - I might cross the street for one of these beers, but it would depend on the number of lanes."
"I only paid $7.95 for a six-pack of this at my local North Coast Coop here in Eureka, CA. IF you need gluten-free beer this seems like a good price for something so specialized. It poured a clear amber with a nice white head that left almost no lacing. Nose of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat rich and finish is dry. For an AB product this is actually pretty decent."
"I actually rather like this stuff. Might give it another try later."
"Almost like a facade of beer. A shadow of beer. It is hard to drink, and that is my honest opinion."
"The fact that Redbridge isn't great beer probably matters not one whit to those with Celiac Disease or similar afflictions. At least it's better beer than Bard's Tale Dragon's Gold (partly because this is an amber ale and Gold is an American macro lager). For those of us fortunate enough to have other options, I believe the drinkablity score is as above. For those who have no other choice, add two points."
"I think this is a great beer, I think they have done a great job of making a beer for those with gluten allergies. I am not sure I would buy it again, but that is due to the price."
"This Beer is unique especially to me since it is the first gluten free beer I have ever had. I image though that even though it is made with out wheat or barley it should have more flavor than it does. I will give it some credit being an Anheuser Bush beer I can't expect a whole heck of a lot. Now to the break down. The beer has a surprisingly deep amber color with a bit of a head to it, which doesn't hold very well at all. Has very little smell to it at all. like I mentioned before it has little taste, I would describe it as watery. Mouthfeel is it's strong point, as with most Anheuser Bush beers it is refreshing like a soda. Drinkability is poor for me since I found it bland and boring I will not drink more than the one I bought."
"That perfumey sweetness is there in the fore. It tastes a little like patchouli and potpourri mix. Yes, I have tasted both. It finishes with a sort of apple and flower finish. Has a moderately biting carbonation and detectable hops. This is not a bad beer at all. I actually think this puppy would sell well if marketed as a ladies (or guys) who hate beer. That being said....its good for what it is. My raped taste buds are screaming for more."
"Decent color and carbonation level. Somewhat of a slight coppery golden color. Aroma is just there-to me a BUD has more aroma then this. Doesnt even really say ""beer"". Flavor is a tad sweet-almost malty. It is sweet like unfermented wort. Very slight trace of hops to it. Mouthfeel is decent enough. As I reach the bottom of the glass the whole package is quite enjoyable. While I dont think I would buy this again, AB has done an admirable job in producing something quite drinkable."
"Wow... A-B really actually took time to come up with this one. Pours a cloudy brown, with red hints. Has a good thick white head and maintains a ring around the outside through every pull on the beer. Lacks any lacing though, which is disappointing. Has a sweet, malty scent. Nice fruit flavor, with slight hop bite and something else in the ending. Could be Sorghum. I am incredibly impressed. Much better than that Red Hook crap A-B tries to sell as real beer."
"Overall impression: This is a fairly solid beer, even when not considering its intent. It is a decent vienna style lager - drinkable and fairly balanced. When you consider this is aimed at the gluten free market, this is an even better beer. My wife is celiac, so I'm always on the lookout for gluten free beers - so far this is definitely one of the frontrunners."
"I pulled a Redbridge from my fridge not knowing what it was. I poured it and was pleased with the appearance. Nice frothy white head... clear deep amber with golden highlights. I raised it to take a sip and noticed hops in the nose. Crisp... slightly elevated fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor was a little odd, sweetish and kind of off-kilter, so I looked at the label... ""Beer Made From Sorghum"". Ahhh! That explains it then. OK. Hmmm. Not bad! My last Celiac beer, if I can call it that, was unimpressive, but this was good. There's a strong hop flavor upfront, grassy and spicy, that screams ""BEER""! Beyond that it's malty; although I'm not sure if Sorghum is malted. I'd guess it is. It's the seed of a grass, just like barley. It's graininess is a touch rough and cardboard-ish (but not from oxidation), and it becomes sweet at the swallow. Unfortunately, it then becomes a bit astringent and harsh, lingering like that with bitterness and dully grassy and spicy hops for quite a bit. Still, I'd prefer this to almost all of the other Celiac beers I've had. For people with Celiac's disease, I'd highly recommend trying this one."
"The dark amber color is very inviting, and the unique taste has fruity undertones. It has a good bite without being bitter and feels lively on your tongue. I am glad to know that people who must avoid regular beer due to allergies or other medical issues can drink at least one more-than-adequate brewski!"
"Bravo"
"Pours a light amber with a short white head that dissipates pretty quick. Smells slightly sweet like a cross between maple syrup and light molasses. Fairly faint, but not unpleasant. The taste is similarly sweet, but surprisingly restrained. There is also a slight bitterness that balances the sweetness. Comes off as quite a bit more flavorful than the common AB product. Medium to light body, not overcarbonated. Fades as it warms, definitely one to drink fairly quickly. Surprisingly okay for a sorghum beer. I am not a celiac, but I very much appreciate their difficulty and I think that AB should be commended for bringing to market such an important product that still tastes reasonably like a beer."
"I know it's a Bud product, but I was able to buy a single bottle of this so I figured why not try it. The beer pours a dark gold color with a small off-white head. The head went away quickly. It smells sweet, but also like apples and a bit spicy. The taste starts off sweet, but then a metallic taste comes through, and it has a weird bitter finish. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, but it's not bad. Drinkability is OK too, but not great. Overall it's OK, it's pretty average all the way around. Not bad, not great. I don't know if I would pay for this again, but I would drink it some other time."
"Pours an almost still looking honey colored body with a thin head that fizzles out to a ring. Smell is really faint but what I do get reminds me of a mix of pure alcohol and caraway. Again, I get the caraway thing here as well as some grainy flavor I've never experienced before. I'm to assume this is the sorghum. I like it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but thickened by the sugars, Carbonation is decent. This is interesting enough for me to keep on drinking."
" I suppose if misfortune were to befall me and I were unable to drink beer brewed with malt, this would be an acceptable approximation. More likely, though, I'd stick with whisky."
"Yea, I fell for it. Glad to see A-B trying some experimental stuff. The beer reminds me of my first few batches of homebrew. Turned out overly malty (with something) spicy, and pepery. Sweetness and viscous similar to some other no-malt beers. I must say that this one seems better than them. Though the beer fell apart and the body turned out thin, the initial flavors show similar qualities to some Belgian malts, minus the yeasts. Overtly sweet well into the finish made it hard to drink late. A tacky feel on the palate with a heavy buttery feel. Not likely to try one again, but this session was not the expected disaster."
"My wife was diagnosed with gluten intolerance in 2001. She had been a beer drinker and was told beer was on the banned list. Using internet sources, I set out to make her gluten free beer. It was a real effort. Nobody sold malted sorghum or buckwheat, so the the entire process took weeks, and the results were mixed. Perhaps this effort predisposed me to liking a well-made GF beer. A gluten free beer from a brewery with the money to do it right was an exciting prospect. At the same time, I picked up some Redbridge and some Bard's Tale, another GF beer. In a blind tasting, my wife and I both preferred Redbridge by a wide margin. It had no funky smell or taste that is common with GF beers. Most occasional beer drinkers would probably not recognize it as anything but beer. It has a slightly darker color than Budweiser and enough hops to make things interesting. When compared against American Macros, the taste is actually a refreshing change. Not surprisingly, AB had the foresight to market this beer as a ""Beer Made from Sorghum," rather than a ""Gluten Free Beer."" By doing so, AB will almost certainly pick up some market share from drinkers who don't have celiac disease but just like the taste. This is a good development for celiacs everywhere but bad news for the small guys who have been laboring for years to come up with a commercial GF beer."
