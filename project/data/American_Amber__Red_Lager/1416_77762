The flavor is pleasant but very subdued while the body likewise comes across rather weak and lifeless. Yes, there's a decent low-key grain/peach/hop combination going on, and the low ABV would makes this a decent enough sessionable winter offering, but overall, it lacks depth and punch for a winter beer.","beergoot","Feb 08, 2015"

In fact, I got a small amount of overflow as a result. The upshot was three solid fingers of dense, tawny head with persistent retention. Color was a deep copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cool, minty quality, but I was expecting spices or some such from a ""Winter"" beer. Hmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was minty with a caramel malt undertone. Nice, but not really ""Wintry"". Finish was semi-sweet and pleasant, but there is no way that I would risk a horrific skiing accident for more of it.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2014"

3.35,-1.8,4,3.25,3,3.75,3.75,"A decent beer, of equal quality, malty but tastes like im drinking it out of a straw of dirty pennies that are a decade old. There is flavor, both good and bad that seem to battle it out on the pallet. I can't disern which one wins the fight as Im torn from sip to sip. The alcohol is low at 4.0, so this is swiggable if you're looking to keep pace with the Bud Light drinkers at an event but want something with a little more substance. I'd naturally assume the taste improves the more you drink but I have a tough time kicking the filthy copper aftertaste. I'm not going to rush back to get this beer, but it's comparable to say a Sam Adams Light, nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't pop out with flavor. Creative label that beckons to a 50's retro look with a skier taking a dixie on a downward slope. It's snowing as I write this, and theres a crackling fire in front of me.

A firm bready presence sits along the back while a touch of earthy must hangs on the edges. The taste has a crisp and spicy bitterness along with some associated earthy citrus flavors. This is well balanced by a backbone of tight and toasted bready sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean and crisp feel. Very tight in the profiles and body. This was a very flavorful and hugely drinkable Lager, with those Noble hops in particular giving this a spicy festive feel that is perfect for winter.

A nice dose of European hops, earthy, grassy, a caramel base, some grain, bold and to the point, a lager. Taste is a refined amber, a fuller body, not as watery than your average Yuengling. I get some bread, caramel, some earthy hops and all together malty. Not too much else to say here, it delivers per the style, just gotta jump on it fresh.
