3.79,1.6,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"One of my go-to beers for when people come over. Pours a nice deep yellow, almost orange with a white head that trails the glass. The smell has a nice balance of hop and malt with some light caramel scents. The taste is very refreshing with the malt in the beginning and then a finish of clean hops. Very refreshing and a great beer for any time of year.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 28, 2015"

3.91,4.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Brooklyn Lager is a dark amber colored lager, topped with a creamy head and outstanding retention. The aroma is clean, brings quick citric and toffee aromas to smell. With a taste, I learned how Brooklyn Brewery got its groove. This lager is not only with flavor, but is clean, light, and easy drinking. Highlighting the tasting notes are graham cracker, light fruits, and citrus. The beer is balanced as well. If I had access to this beer, Brooklyn Lager may even join my drinking rotation.","DoubleJ","Mar 27, 2015"

The beer has a good malt backbone, mostly light bread and grain with an mild initial sweetness that dries out by the finish. The hops taste like they have been added in flavors with herbal and spicy flavors mingling with the balancing hop bitterness. A very drinkable, refreshing medium to medium light bodied beer with slightly above average carbonation.","pat61","Mar 05, 2015"

Aroma is toasted bread, some caramel, lager yeast (as it warms) and hints of some earthy hops in there. Flavor follows suit. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, solid lager.

Tastes are dry caramel, a bit of biscuit, a bit of citrus on the swallow. Overall, this is a fairly mild beer. As a lager I give it credit for bringing more to the table than a lot do in this category, but the word ""forgettable"" keeps creeping into my mind when compared to most beers I drink..","BeerWatcher","Aug 11, 2014"

This is what adjunct macro garbage could taste like if any of the brewers gave a crap. While this beer isn't going to win any big awards, it is a great, consistent brew.

Because this doesn't quite seem like a Vienna lager, what with the strong American hopping, I'm not going to rate it as one (BJCP does not have a category for American Amber Lager - that's a problem...). This is a beer I could come back to again and again. It is a well-structured, balanced, hoppy craft lager. Easily one of my top five beers of all time. Clean, refreshing, and remarkable (but not a Vienna lager).","SaltofOH","Jul 28, 2014"

Maybe they are not made with the same quality ingredients, but I cannot know or tell the difference. That is not to say that I do not enjoy this one, because I do. I just believe that its a bit overly priced for what you get. I got it on sale for $7.99/ six pack a similar beer out of Pennsylvania I also picked up for $7.99, but it was for a 12 pack. I have been on this tirade for a while now, but beer has gotten overly costly as of late, or so it seems. That has not deterred me from drinking it, but I feel a bubble burst coming, at least I hope a leveling. On to the review, the color is a golden red the smell is flat, nothing much to express there. The taste is good, its not too much of anything, which to me says balance. That is a good thing, especially in a lager. This is, as someone else put, a very sessionable beer, although if you plan on saving some cash I wouldn't put a way too many, because there are much better beers in the same price range. Overall, this is a solid beer, but I do wish that it was more in the same price range of its real competition, because for lagers you have a lot of competition and at much better prices.","humuloner22","Feb 10, 2014"

APPEARANCE: beautiful orange-amber body; healthy and bubbly; thick, rocky white head that settles well; noticeable tracing... AROMA: fragrant malt; faint yet formidable citric elements--lemongrass, some pear--and some softer hops--understated but alluring... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly oily--solid mouthfeel--active and bubbly ...TASTE: light malts hint at bubblegum and muffin--refreshingly light overall, with a taste that invites a six-pack without simply rinsing... OVERALL: A companion piece to Sam Adams' offering, though not as bold, big or bountiful; a solid mix-pack filler, a session beer for certain, and definitely versatile enough to be a plus at parties where macros are offered mindlessly....","dacrza1","Feb 09, 2014"

An amber-brown color with around two inches or so of beige head, quite fizzy. Aroma is reminiscent of light caramel, some other nondescript semi-sweet fruit (melon?), and reasonably assertive German noble hops along with Cascade quasi-citrus elements as well. Hops on the nose fairly impressive for the style. Very inviting. Taste is crisp, refreshing, and again semi-sweet, with some pleasant herbal notes. I get some bread crust, a twinge of brown sugar, unripe plums, and green grassy hops, balanced and quenching after physical exertion. Compares favorably with Creemore Springs Premium Lager (see that review) and is a prime example of how to do this style well. Thin bodied but flavorful with moderately aggressive carbonation. Would tackle a six-pack during an afternoon of yard work and would appreciate actually tasting what I was drinking (bye bye adjunct lagers ... That was your only real purpose).","CalgaryFMC","Jan 20, 2014"

3.38,-9.4,3,2.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a very thick head that stays for a long time. Color is sort of a golden brown. Couldn't smell the beer out of the bottle, had to pour it to smell. Not an overly attractive scent. Taste is very good. A hint of malt with a nice hoppy kick. Mouthfeel is good, not too carbonated. One of the better beers I've had recently. Definitely a fan of pre-prohibition style lagers.","TheBeerdedCharmer","Dec 06, 2013"

Some shy hops come up to offer a little grass and tangerine citrus. Taste is earthy and clean. The pale malt is nice and round and the hops lend a touch of bitterness to make it drink well. Mouthfeel is a little flat, could have used a few more bubbles. But it was smooth, semi dry and had a grainy and slightly bitter finish.

3.78,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a very nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and earthy hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of apple, pear, orange zest, caramel, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and hop earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and earthy hops on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a very good amber lager. Nice fairly robust flavors with good balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

It is stated as being a pre-prohibition lager and I understand exactly what they mean as the hops and malt are omnipresent during the entire experience. Poured into a pint glass and the colour was a light ruby red, nice head retention and lacing throughout. It smelled of light caramel malt with some pleasant, aromatic hops on the nose. I drank a couple of them and they flowed nicely. It's really a shame that Americans did the whole Prohibition thing, and I wish they would have bootlegged beer like this throughout as it could destroy any macro side-by-side. Hell, it could snipe down a crap Miller Light from miles away! Enjoy it in the sunshine with a burger or a brat and a side of slaw.","zachloveshisbeer","Jan 10, 2013"

3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a murky light amber bordering on dark mustard yellow with a big creamy white head with sticky lacing leaving creamy patches like spider webs on the glass. The body is clear of particles (obviously) but has a murky look. The beer is transparent with some bubbles, but murky. The beer smells wet and grassy with notes of slightly citrus light caramel malts. From the can the malt smell is much more potent and sweet syrupy, reminding me of rice pudding and candy. The beer tastes quite sweet for a lager with light biscuit, grass and slight citrus. The beer touches the tongue as light citrus apple juice before moving into grassy hops with light citrus and slight bread and then opening into syrupy sweet on sides of the mouth but never striking cloying levels. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and grassy, but overall quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy, leaving the mouth wet with saliva and slightly dry with bitter lingerings. Overall this is a nice beer to put back. I bought a six pack of the cans to session them, and session them I did. The sweet taste is a little too much for what I would normally like, and I kind of wish the grass was more there, but overall a lovely mediocre chugger. This beer will not blow you away, but is solid where it counts.","Maxwell","Nov 03, 2012"

Well worth purchasing at least once, and something I will probably return to in the future.","thehyperduck","Aug 12, 2012"

The most dominant aroma is malt. This beer is nice and clean tasting, as a lager should be, but then, going against the grain, it has flavor. You can taste malt and there is a decent amount of hop bitterness. If I had to have a (somewhat) widely available lager beer, this would be my choice.","omokoro","Apr 29, 2012"

This lager is definitely a step above most others, and can be easily enjoyed any day of the week with any meal!","AMiz602","Feb 24, 2012"

Huge head that towers over my glass, four fingers plus. Clear reddish amber with mild carbonation. Lots of lace clinging in clumps and rings. Smell has lots of yeasty bread with toasted malt graininess. A nice bit of floral hops and light citrus. A hint of earth sneaking in. Taste is solid with a good balance of malt and hops right up front. Caramel sweetness is couched in malt. A bit of biscuit and a touch of sourdough. Firm hop bitterness balances beautifully. Finish is long and dry with an earthy/citrus hoppiness. Just a touch of citrus and hop oil lingering. Feel is smooth and crisp with a mildly effervescent carbonation that is spot on. Just a great overall beer. Super drinkable with an ability to be a gateway beer while at the same time offer all a sophisticated palate could want.

3.97,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Brooklyn ""Pre-Prohibition"" Lager pours a couple fingers of dense white foam over a slightly cloudy, effervescent amber brew. The nose is lager yeast funk and sweet, clean light barley malt with notes of honey and spring herbs. The flavor is simple and direct- sweet light malt balanced with mild herbaceous hops. The mouthfeel is round yet light, finishing semi-dry and clean with only a sticky lacing left behind in the glass. This is a deceptively simple lager sold for a premium price- but is it worth it? I would say yes- it's so simple there is nowhere for the Brewmaster to cover his tracks- every element of taste and texture is out in the open, and every element is in perfect balance- sweet, but not insipid, the hop presence just enough to balance the sweetness, pleasant in the mouth but dry enough to be quenching- a nice brew.","shadow1961","Dec 22, 2011"

It had a big malt character to it, with lots of wet grass, and earthy, musky smells coming through on it, however, if you looked inside a little deeper, what you found was a very nice, and light citrus noteThis was a highly drinkable session ale for me, and I am not sure what the percentage is here, but it cannot be that high. Really a very nice drinker with a nice light body and a smooth creamy finish with more then adequate carbonation. The flavor was light enough to not really overpower in one direction or the other, but at the same time, it also had more then enough going for it to keep you interested throughout. Nice bready malts popping up for me first, really earthy grainy like flavor, but this was soon passed up by a nice bright spot of floral hops. Really nicely balanced. Not sure what to call the style, other then a nice American lager. A touch sweet on the finish, before drying out and getting you ready for the next sip.","mikesgroove","Jun 14, 2011"

The flavor is fruity with sweet malt notes followed by a hop bitterness that lasts from start to finish. The flavor is more reminiscent of an APA than a lager and leaves a lasting, dry, bitter, aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light.

The aroma and flavor are much more hop-forward than expected, with prominent notes of grapefruit and grass, but there is also a substantial caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel seemed even more off-style, with a much more resinous texture and little of the crispness I expected (and desired) from a lager, even from an American amber lager.

Anchor Steam is one of my all time favorites, so in my opinion this is quite a good beer, even if hackneyed from the original. The smell is subdued, a bit earthy with slight nuttiness and faint caramel. The taste is great: mellow fruit, rich walnut, slight floral hints at the edges, clean malt with a dry hop finish that is nearly perfect. It is a heavier beer than a macro lager, but refreshing and crisp with a little extra heft. There is a crisp hop dryness at the finish which is sublime. This was an instant favorite when I tried it at Roscoe Village Tap last summer, and in six pack form it is excellent. Highly recommended.

The body was rather a little oily, that prefer my lagers (and a hoppy one at that) to be a little bouncy - although it was well carbonated, the mouthfeel was slicker than what I'd prefer.

But as it is, a good light bodied, flavorful lager that is easy to drink. No surprise this is Brooklyn Brewery's top selling beer.","morimech","Aug 19, 2010"

Nice to see what a good lager is capable of smelling like. The taste yielded a nicely balanced herbal/grassy/malty mix that progressed to a crisp dry finish, and left malty hints afterwards. More pear fruitiness was revealed as it warmed towards room temperature. The mouthfeel was a perfectly carbonated medium body. An excellent session lager.","donniecuffs","Jul 21, 2010"

3.78,1.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Brooklyn Lager pours a deep red in my Duvel tulip, halfway to brown. The head is off white with just a hint of tan mixed in, and is impressive both in size (2+ fingers) and staying power and lacing. The nose is a mixture of biscuity malts and floral and earthy hops. As I sip on Brooklyn Lager I immediately pick up on the biscuity malt flavor again before a brief flash of bitterness signals the arrival of the hop flavors, still earthy and floral (I still can't detect the Cascade hops that went into this beer). The beer closes with a caramel flourish, but somehow all the pieces here just don't work together like they do in many of my favorite beers. The mouthfeel is average, but the carbonation doesn't seem to last with each sip, and gives the impression that it's a bit lacking. Brooklyn Lager is a serviceable beer, but doesn't compare to some of the brewery's more exciting beers.","axeman9182","Jun 13, 2010"
3.8,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A solid, solid beer. Pouring a clear amber with a dense light brown head with decent retention, there's not much lace. The nose is solid. A moderate hop character is present, earthy and leafy with a robust malt backbone with aromas of toast, caramel and a little bread as well. The palate opens a blend of moderate earthy hop character with a good balance between the flavor and bitterness, and a robust malt character, toasty, a little bready and with some caramel. I'm rather surprised by the moderate fruit character as well, with a light, ripe fruits. While not unwelcome, it is unconventional. Drying and hoppy on the finish, this beer has a moderate level of carbonation. Very drinkable, I'm glad this is available in cans now.","DefenCorps","Jun 13, 2010"

Lovely grainy smell, nice balance of hop bitterness and sweet malts. Very flavoursome beer - grainy malts hit you up front followed by pine/grassy tones and some caramel. Full mouth feel due to strong carbonation with a crisp finish and some alchohol warmth. A very quaffable brew any time of the year and one I return to frequently. A bottled 6 pack does the job just nicely.","Ruaidhri","Nov 26, 2009"

If you like Sam Adams Lager, this one is pretty similar, maybe a little less sweet.","littlekidlover","Nov 22, 2009"
4,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"First sip is clean, and a little bit more bitter than your standard lager. Pretty highly carbonated, but the beer has enough backbone to stand up to it. Continuing on, the bitterness in the initial taste fades to a dry malty body. Again, no specific flavors dominate, the malt is very balanced and very generic. Finally, the beer disappears with zero aftertaste. I wouldn't normally object to the presence of aftertaste in beer (assuming it's not actually offensive), but the lack of aftertaste in this particular style makes it remarkably drinkable. I don't understand how anyone could criticize its drinkability.","hreb","Nov 21, 2009"

3.83,2.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This cold brew from can to pint glass shows a very glowing orange amber color with a sturdy off-white head and excellent lacing. The aroma is a surprisingly pleasant malt and floral hop mix, mild but better than most lagers for sure. The flavor gives me a crisp cereal grain with bright floral hops that park on the edge of your tongue. Body is midland for a lager, somewhat creamy but easy going down. There is lots of peppery carbonation and a somewhat thick finish of grainy alcohol with some sweet malt. It's not the most drinkable lager I've ever had, a bit full in it's constitution, but it will suffice for a decent flavored refreshment. While I find this more personable than most lagers, certainly more than the macros by far, it still leaves a bit of an abrasive aftertaste for me, possibly owed a bit to the container but it's hard to say for sure. Just not extremely agreeable, but definitely decent. The hops do become more pronounced as you go, more of a citrus hint too. I'm a bit torn between very good and just good. Lager lovers should be pleased.","Durge","Aug 18, 2009"

There's also something sweet in flavor that I can't put my finger on and frankly, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

A fresh, hoppy bitterness lingers into the finish almost like a good IPA. Mouthfeel sits between medium and light, with a bubbly carbonation level that kicks up the spice mid-palate. Gets a little sticky with residuals towards the finish, but it's a minor nit-pick, as this is probably one of the best readily available lagers out there.

Very slight amounts of diacetyl go with the amber malt. Surprisingly medium to full bodied served a little under room temperature.

Aroma is that of honey, malt, and spice and taste is clean, sweet, and grainy - great hint that is in fact a lager. Goes down smooth and finishes dry; very easy to drink. This is one of my favorite lagers because it has more taste than traditional macro/import lagers. A great entry-level craft beer that can be enjoyed again and again even by a discriminating palate.

The aroma is surprisingly hoppy. This is definitely the most hoppy lager I have ever had. The aroma is floral and citrus hops. There is definitely a good bit of lemon in the nose along with a good floral bouquet. The flavor is just a superb combination of a nice hoppy bite with a good caramel malt backbone.

Some earthiness, some sourness, and some grain are mixed in. Tastes of crystal malts, with a quick bitter finish which wraps up some sour apples, spice, and grass. This is a complex lager on both the aroma and taste fronts. Mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied, and leans toward the dry side.

The beer has a splash of dryness, quite a bit of a citrusy acidity, some bready malts, and a nice hop backbone. There is an apple citrus to this beer as well.

Very good balance on the tongue with a good malt undertone in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Wow, I wasn't expecting this beer to be this good.

Gorgeous amber color, with small head that disappeared but left a nice tan lacing all over the sides of the glass. Smell was all malt with a tiny hint of floral hops in the nose. Great, firm mouthfeel that really reminded you you're drinking a substantial craft brew.

No bubbles to seen but has a thin of lacing. I had to mark it down a bit due to the lack of bubbles. NONE. You must have bubbles to be a lager of this style in my book. Very unique and spicey bitterness to this aroma. Very hoppy and rye like. This was out of left-field for me. The taste was even hoppier. A mild bitterness compared to an IPA, but very high for any lager I've had before this one. Very light biscuit malt profile, the hops take over on this one.

You could definitely smell the malt in this one, along with lots of grains, a bit of a musky tree bark aroma, and a slight hint of mint.

Wonderful caramel-candy malts in the nose right away with a slight scent of grassy-earthy hops at the end. The sweetness foretold of the caramel malts by the aroma is artfully restrained in the taste, revealing itself to be more of a toasted biscuit/caramel hybrid. A not unexpected grassy hop flavor is also detectable near the finish, which is decidedly metallic and just slighty marked by an earthy compost character. Medium thin body, not overcarbonated at all. Overall, an utterly smooth and clean mouthfeel. This is a classic lager that I really don't have around as much as I should. In my estimation, a flagship beer of which all New Yorkers (even us out here in the western part of the state) should be quite proud.","orfeu","Sep 06, 2006"

Thin off white head, effervescence aplenty. Deep amber colour, not like your average lager. This had a very hoppy aroma to it, with a strong malt backing. Toffee, smokey, with a hint of violet. The taste I found had intense hop bitterness, butterscotch, and a hint of vanilla. More of a pale ale than what Id expect from a lager, hence I marked it fairly low, despite liking it. A nice bitter finish to it though. Although the mouth is a bit heavier than what Id expect from what is labelled a lager, I find it fairly drinkable. Its nice, in a confusing way, because I expected something lighter from what was printed on the label, although I note that its categorized as an all malt lager, so maybe my lack of experience with this style is telling in this. Overall, a good drink which I'll probably buy again. It certainly blows any other American lager Ive had up to now clean out of the water.","zebedee","Sep 01, 2006"

There's some malt, a little floral scent, a little citrus and yeast. Hops dominate the taste again, with a little malty sweetness. This tastes, again, more like an IPA/APA than an american lager. It's nto that this is a bad bad, I rather like it, but it is not typical of the style. This is fairly drinkable, finishes clean.

It smells mostly like floral and citrusy hops, with some biscuity malts in there also. With the hoppiness it smells more like an IPA than a lager. The beer tastes like citrus hops (grapefruit), with some sweetness and then a slight hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with a decent amount of carbonation.

A bit of spicyness comes in and provides some bitterness but that doesn't last too long. Caramel is the only malt flavor I detect. Malts seem to be simple here and basically just provide the base for the hoppy flavors. Finish is almost fruity but with a bit of residual sugars to it as well.

It's a brew that pretty much pleases everyone. Normally this will put a beer lover off but I was positively surprised. It poured with a finger of foam or so, and with a nice reddish amber color. The smell was stong and citrusy, surprisingly similar to an IPA. The main thrust of the taste is a pronounced bitterness wrapped with a sweetness and some malts. A little toast in the aftertaste.

The brew pours to a nice amber color with a nice fat white head that has great retention and leaves sheets of lace down the sides of the glass. Looks to be very carbonated with the amount of bubbles traversing up the side of the glass. The first aroma that I notice is the hops, according to the website it is German Hallertauer, Vanguard, and Cascade hops. Seems that I notice the cascade hop more than the others but that is probably due to inexperience. The taste is crisp, very fresh feel. Notice the caramel malt a bit at the start but it does have a heavy hop taste, more flowery than citrus. Very nice brew, might not be one if I am having friends over that like a more all purpose lager with the hop aromas and taste but for me a pretty good session brew.

Hints of raisins, grapes, and oranges intermingle in this just-above-simple brew. It is extremely tasty, if I may reiterate.

There are piney/citric/floral hops on the palate that are spicy and leave a nice bitterness, and they're balanced by caramel and biscuity/toasty malts that give it a medium to full body (the bubbles rise slowly).

Some underlying sweetness, but almost sublime. Good flavor. Huskiness and lightly floral hops play a major role, and a citrusy astringency nearer the finish is most interesting, because it doesn't seem related to the hops. Mouthfeel and texture is medium bodied and carbonation level is average to slightly above, which may account for the citrusiness (carbonic acid). A heartier lager whilst maintaining an average ABV.

This pours a clear amber body, with a thick, offwhite head that stands about a centimeter tall and insists on hanging around, eventually leaving some impressive lacing on the glass. Aroma is very lagerish, with vague sweet maltiness and some floral hops. Mouthfeel is typical for style, with a light medium body and high carbonation. Crisp and refreshing for the most part, with slight floral hops bitterness. Malt is quite bready, but thankfully stays in the background for the most part. Another quality brew from a fine NYC brewery. This is a good one for fans of American lagers.","merlin48","Feb 11, 2005"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Golden yellow colored, with active carbonation and a medium foamy head, this was a classic looking lager when poured into a Pilsner glass from the signature minimalist Brooklyn styled brown bottle. The aroma indicated presence of sweet honey and caramel malt and noble grassy hops in this beer, and after the first sip I could tell that it did not lie. Medium bodied, bready, sticky, creamy, and slightly salty, this is a moderately flavored, crowd pleasing lager with enough character, and hoppy bite, so that it would not disappoint even the seasoned beer connoisseur (among whose ranks I would not place myself, I might add). Worth seeking out if in the mood for some simpler pleasures.","rajendra82","Jan 06, 2005"

Beer is translucent sienna in color with bronze highlights bordering on orange. Clean, somewhat dry nosefeel with light aromas of toasted malts. Smooth, not-too-sweet malt flavors share the stage with a surprising amount of hop bitterness. Surprising amount of overall flavor, actually... Mouthfeel is firm and hardly overcarbonated, with a nice bitter aftertaste that hangs around for several seconds after each swallow. There's not much going on here, but this would be serviceable for heavy session drinking. At any rate, I'd take this over just about any other standard American lager from a comparably-sized brewery.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Sep 27, 2004"

The taste fell in line although there was more hop in the taste than the nose. There wasn't much malt to this one, just a lot of hops. The feel was light and very dry. This is one of those beers where you could tell it had been well brewed, but it just isn't your beer.

Smell consisted of sweet malts with an undertone of hops and caramel, but it was a little subtle though. Taste made up for it though. It's more on the sweet side. Sweeten malts come up first with an underlying of hops (which seems to be big at times) and some caramel. Moutfeel is medium which was good. This is a perfect example of a session beer. A good beer.","necoadam","Aug 17, 2004"

Nose is hoppy, but not overly so. Taste is clean, remarkably, with malt notes and that lager sourness/grassyness mixed in with the hops, and dies down to a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice if a bit carbonated, but it adds to the clean and crisp of the lager. Maybe one day I'll devote a Friday at the brewery to this one. I'm coming around to lagers.

The smell showed a great and sweet fruitiness, mostly red fruits; yeasty, with light hints of chocolate. The taste didn't completely fulfill the expections I got from the smell. It is good, but the red fruit notes are much less noticeable. There's more of a tart grapefruit aspect that bites the tongue; or maybe it's more floral. The round and very sweet maltiness sometimes evokes caramel. The hops are quite thick and probably contribute to the grapefruit/floral aspect of the brew. I'm confused about this aspect though. I guess it just didn't give me what I thought it'd give me from the smell. Still a remarkable lager.","tjd25","Jul 12, 2004"
2.56,-31.4,4,3,2.5,2,2,"Richly amber in color, the nose is of sweaty, sticky, cheap, yellow hop buds. Caramel sundae topping struggles to emerge from underneath the piercing load of herb. On the palate it is sharp, with an awkward clash of ingredients and a deficit of integration and harmony. It tastes somewhat rushed and painted by numbers. Alternating impressions of gritty metal and gastric acids are mild, but still too obvious. Some indiscriminate hop-heads may be delighted with this beer. I doubt, however, that one could honestly take pleasure in consuming it on a regular basis.","putnam","Jul 10, 2004"

It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter and bready. It has a bit of hops present which only adds to the taste. The mouthfeel is great.

I can imagine this being a fine session beer, because it is lightly bodied, nicely balanced, and quite frankly, does not have an overwhelming amount of flavor. Sweet malt and then a cleaning swipe of hops, and a lingering sweetness. But flavor, well it tastes like a Yuengling. Not at all unpleasant, and one I can see drinking when Im going to have more than one (Ok, 5), but as a nightcap, it leaves a little bit to be desired.","jackndan","Apr 09, 2004"

By the end, an extremely prevalent sweetness came through, almost like a dopplebock type malty flavor. Actually, I'm not sure whether this was because it was the end of the beer or because it had warmed a little. The sweetness was slightly overbearing but nothing I couldn't handle. For the most part a very solid, drinkable beer, though I'd rather have a Sammy, but that's just me. Oh, and the mouthfeel is superb; a real high note.","BeefyMee","Apr 01, 2004"

This beer may not be in the upper tier of beers but it is certainly good. The first thing that strikes you about it is its nice amber color. It is a hoppy beer which goes down very smooth. It has decent carbonation, it is a lager as the title shows but it doesn't have too much of a lingering aftertaste, which is something that turns some people off. This makes it a great beer to buy a friend at a bar which has a good beer selection that may not know much about beers other than macros.","wsouloa","Feb 25, 2004"

Usually the last beer I have tastes the worst because I fail to adequately cleanse my palate, but tonight was an exception. I'm tasting a remarkable hop content for a lager, almost enough to make it a pale ale. In fact, that would make sense since it has a bold amber coloration.

A little sweet, but enough other flavors in there, too. Somewhat thick in the mouth, but more drinkable than your average lager. A great standby beer.","dwarbi","May 12, 2003"
3.5,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Well I bought a sampler without looking at the date and it's best by date is August 2002, however it is against my religion to toss a beer without at least trying it first. Pours a beautiful amber gold with a creamy white foaming head, this beer is forming nice even rings of lace looking quite beautiful in my stemmed Stella Artois glass. Aroma is a bit musky with some mild hops and a very mild hint of malt sweetness, with all things considered mainly the age of this beer not bad at all. The taste is where the age starts to hurt this beer it still has a nice grainy sweetness with some bittering hops thrown in, but overall just a little stale. What did I expect from a lager this old. I remind you that this beer is still a cut above most beers out there, just I will definitely have to resample due to the age of the product. Mouthfeel is still very carbonated with a nice nutty malt thickness to the finish. Overall I bet this beer is really drinkable, but I am going to update this review to find out for sure.","WVbeergeek","May 09, 2003"
4.06,8.8,5,4,4,4,4,"Sparkling crystal bronze color - the carbonation bubbles can easily be observed. Although not overly malty for the style, this lager bordered on ale-like qualities. The hops were interesting - although not overly floral, they did lend a distinct aromatic quality, and the bittering aspect was almost secondary. Overall, a nicely crafted brew.","Brent","May 01, 2003"
3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A translucent deep amber to copper color on the pour, a prestigious bright white head, generous lace and a nice clean and crisp nose. Start is loaded with malt, somewhat sweet, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate, with the finish stinging in its acidity, the hops stout in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a great drinking beer, I Like It!","Gusler","Apr 28, 2003"
3.3,-11.5,4,4,3,3,3,"This lager had a dark amber appearance, with a nice fluffy head. Very attractive looking beer, complete with a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell was equally impressive, with clove and citrus elements here and there. The taste threw me of a bit, however. An indescribable tangy quality distracted me from the otherwise well-balanced brew. A hint of orange or citrus combined with a yeasty quality that didn't sit well with me. While the taste was definitely something different, I can't say that I enjoyed it immensely. The mouthfeel was rather mediocre, smooth overall, but with a somewhat grainy feel on the tongue. I've had better lagers, even from larger breweries. The Brooklyn Lager wasn't terrible, but it wouldn't be my choice among a variety from the same style.","SchmichaelJ","Apr 17, 2003"
3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer was a real surprise to me. I wasn't expecting much from the single bottle I bought from a split pack, primarily because of the pricing. Surprise! This is a very good lager, but I believed it is misclassified as a pale lager. This seems much more to me Vienna style. The color is deep amber/copper with a very good goldish tan head that lasts reasonable well. The lacing is also very good. Mucho hops on the head aroma, more malt-like as the head dissipates. Great refreshing taste with more hops than expected. Creamy mouthfeel. Thoroughly enjoyable.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 16, 2003"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"One of the better micro breweries, Brooklyn has done a fine job with the various tasks they have attempted, but it is always nice to come back to an old stand by such as the Lager. This is so easy to drink. Lager was presented in a 20oz. glass and it was a rich mahogony color with a fine, white head with an interesting, thin, clingy lace. The smell was sharp with lemon and hop aromas. The interesting part about this beer is that it tastes much like a pale ale or bitter, with that distinct hop taste. It was crisp and refreshing though and not nearly as heavy tasting as a pale ale. This is a beer you can always count on and it is pretty easy to find to boot!","GreatPondBrewer","Mar 27, 2003"
3.85,3.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Had a great thick rocky and fluffy head that shrank in a few minutes leaving a merange around the rim of the glass. The color was a deep copper and very clear. Thea smell was full of hops and some maltyness as well. Texture was thinner than I had expected but still had a nice mouthfeel. Tastes reminded me very much of Sam Adams which I have had many time before this lager. Tastes was a mild sweet maltyness upfront followed by complex hop character in the end. Hops left a grapefruit and lingering aftertaste but was not overpowering. Good overall but I think I would stick to SA if I wanted this type of full flavored lager.","OatmattStout","Mar 19, 2003"
2.54,-31.9,2.5,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,"light copper, hop oils form patches of head. Aroma was nice spicy hop. taste was a caramel flavor that did not integrate very well with the rest of the beer. There was a little lemon zest. The one nice surprise was the floral notes in the flavor of the hops. Easy drinking, but why would you buy one when SA boston lager is more easily found and tastes somewhat similar and much better? I suppose this beer is supposed to provide a step-up from tasteless lagers, which it does rather well i guess.","waughbrew","Mar 07, 2003"
4.15,11.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"As the bottle states, it's a golden-amber brew. Good sized white head with decent staying power. Leaves some patchy lace as it goes down. Clean, crisp aroma of floral hops and sweet grainy malt. As for the taste, again, it's very crisp and clean. Quite flavorful though. Hop oil and grainy malt make up most of the flavor profile. Has a nice pinpoint bitterness to it as well. Smooth and refreshing all the way through. Reminds me of Sam Adams Boston Lager, but a bit better. Great casual drinking beer. Thanks to francisweizen for this one!","hyuga","Mar 06, 2003"
4.52,21.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"These guys have proven that in an age of ""can you top this"" in the hop and alcohol contest, a good , solid beer can be enjoyed. Now that I have found a reliable supplier for this stuff my fridge will always have some on hand. Also a great beer to serve to the casual macro drinker who is turned off by the ""mega"" brews.","thefireman","Feb 28, 2003"
4.12,10.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Like all Brooklyn brews a great hoppy nose, floral hops (Hallertauer and Cascade). A slightly malty taste, but very much a barley malt as it has a tart fruity tone that finishes on a slightly acidic bitter. Reminiscent of nuts without being a truly nutty beer. opens to an even larger soft fruity-floral nose  quite nice due to dry-hopping. Very good lager bitterness in its balance amongst the flavors  not too strong, but definitively a major presence. A good brew that I like to have around as for (as an NY resident) its much better than anything else in its price range.","nomad","Feb 24, 2003"
3.76,0.8,5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A thanks goes out to Francisweizen for this bottle. In a nutshell, a good clean,crisp American pilsner. This one poured a sparkling deep golden color with a nice creamy head and lots of tiny rising bubbles. Nice German hop aroma (Saaz?), grassy and a touch herbal. It has a malty start that quickly vanishes to a light hop bitter finish, a nice dry and crisp beer that would go well on a hot day. It would also go well with pizza or burgers. Not fantastic but solid. Lager the way it should be made here.","jeffboo","Feb 21, 2003"

3.88,4,3.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Its firm head and rich color give Brooklyn's Lager and appetizing appearance. Its soft nose is followed by a dry, refreshing finish that begs for another sip. Brooklyn's standard beer is itself a standard for American Lagers. While better lagers exist, few exemplify the style better than Brooklyn does and is an essential component to an August cookout.","Bcant","Feb 03, 2003"
3.83,2.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"An awesome clear gold color and a bright white head tops of this larger. A citrus/hoppy aroma is present, very clean.

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly chill hazed copper, with a thin but persistent head that leaves a little bit of lace. Aroma is malty... caramel and toasted malt, and a bit of spicy noble hops. Flavor is malty, beginning with some sweet caramel notes, moving to bread and some finishing spicy bitterness. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is somewhat rough, with a medium body. This is a very well done amber lager.","zerk","Jan 05, 2003"
3.52,-5.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer poured onto the glass a medium to dark gold color. The head was of a full consistency and the color of white. The aroma was a balance of malts and hops.

3.4,-8.8,4,4,3,4,3,"This is a pretty good bear.  I got it in a six pack in a variety case of Brooklyn Beers(A good purchase and one that I would suggest to all of you who are unfamiliar with this breweries excellent line of beers!-not that I am partial to it or anything, considering I am from brooklyn originally....)anyway this purs a darkish amber colour which is not that different from a boston lager.  It also smells like a boston lager, and features the same head IMO.  Basically this tases like boston lager as well, but with a bigger mouthfeel.  The only downside to this beer is the aftertaste, which is a little too harsh for me to handle(at least for this style...in a pale ale I look for a more hoppy harsh finish...)Either way a nice beer, and good to have in the fridge at all times.","francisweizen","Nov 05, 2002"
3.85,3.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark golden color, maybe amber. The head is a off-white color and very small but holds pretty well. On the nose the aroma is clean with a hint of malts.

The New York Sam Adams (and both are contract brewed out of their hometowns). A beer that can be overlooked by those searching for the next outrageous IPA or imperial stout, but this is the one of the bedrock brews that can be used to convert the more willing Budmillercoors folks. Always good to have a few around. My prejudice: made with the old Schafer yeast strain. My dad always drank Schafer. So this is my link.","RonfromJersey","May 25, 2002"

Goes great with all kinds of food, or a fine centerpiece when drinking is the only matter at hand. Can't go wrong with this one.","Thrasher","Mar 14, 2002"
