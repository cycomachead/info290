"This beer produces a beautiful head that gradually becomes white lacing, which lasts. It's an amber color and tastes just right to me, that is the balance between malt and hops is perfectly achieved. Carbonation is spot on and the aroma is a rich beer smell. I'm really happy that my Publix carries it."

"Very good, smooth beer with easy taste."
"Malty, with some fruity notes, easy drinking"
""
""
""
"Pours an amber color with decent head. Smells of toasted malts and earthiness. Fruity sweet taste, like blueberries, as well as spices. A hop finish that is dry and slightly astringent. Smooth drinking creamy feel. Not bad."
"Sub Average Lager. Toasted, yet toasted grain notes are almost unnoticeable"
""
"o: Nothing over the top and nothing spectacular. A nice little beer with a bit of character that is easy to drink."

"I tried this beer from a mixed 6 and I must say that it was okay. The main thing I notice about this beer is a slight after taste. I would probably try it again as a draft beer to see if there is a major difference."

"Dark amber and a small head after poured from tap. Very sweet nose of caramel and biscuit. Cloying for lager. Not a light nor refreshing beast. A marzenesque malt bomb. Very sweet. Cherries, chocolate and caramel taste."
""
"Overall (4.17) : I wish they sold this here. 302BeerGuy traded me this one and so far it's probably the most impressive lager I've tried outside of the midwest area. I really enjoy it, it's a fire-side, late night, cozy lager for sure."

"09/19/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. To me, this is like a restrained Sam Adams. Pleasant. I think the toasting pushes this to being bit full for summer, so good it should be good for fall drinkin'. All in all a good brew."
"Overall, this is just a solid flagship lager. It really does what it is supposed to do very well; with a thirst quenching quality in an easy to quaff feel and weight."

"Not too much to say about this one. It is smooth and has nice notes of barley and slight hints of spice. Don't get me wrong, its not at all a 'bad' beer. It has nice balance and tastes good. I just wasn't blown away by it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys Yuengling."

"It's a pretty good beer, but I can only say that if this is the same beer that was given a number of medals, there may have been a lack of competition. There are too many good, flavorful ambers now for one so light in aroma and flavor to compete."

"Pours a clear amber with a fairly thick creamy white head. There was quick dissipation and minimal lacing, left, though. It has a lighter aroma but with nice toasted notes and some hints of fruit. The flavors match the aroma and it was a good beer with brunch. There was also a nice weight to the body. Overall, this is a pretty good lager."

"Although the price and the appearance of the pour were a bit underwhelming for the beer, it more than delivered on both taste and smell. The name is spot on because on the nose and after the first taste you are bombarded by the taste of toasted wheat and malt that I found stupendous. Wonderful toasted wheat in the beginning and then a caramel flavor to finish it. For what it is, I think that the price is a steal at about three dollars a bomber here in CT."
""
"Overall: Meh. I'm not the biggest lager guy, so would I have it again? Possibly. I might have reviewed this a bit more favorably had I tried it earlier in a session."
""
""
""
"Toasted lager this is... on the nose and in the taste buds, there's a really nice toast and caramel flavor that leaves a slightly sweet aftertaste. The carbonation is fairly high, which makes this really drinkable with its low bitterness. I tend to find lagers a bit boring for the most part, but something as simple as making the beer taste a bit toast-like worked very well. I'd have another one. It's a good beer to drink after you've had a few, but are still looking for something with a little bit of flavor."

"Most major beers I can think of"

"Overall a solid lager"

"This beer does not have much going for it."

"Overall: I really liked this one. I'm not typically a big fan of this style of lager, but this one has alot of character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of floral hops, bready malts, and toasted malts, with a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is average with high carbonation, just slightly chewy with a crisp finish."

"Overall: A great beer overall. Vienna lagers make for great flagship beers and this one is no exception. Flavorful and balanced, this is a perfect beer for non-craft drinkers to enter the craft beer world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be quite enjoyable. The darker malts than typical for most canned American lagers made for a deeper flavor profile without being overly sweet. A nice complimentary hoppiness while still staying malt-forward. A quality canned lager. Maybe it's not quite enough to become a staple in my fridge, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another six-pack when I'm in the mood."

"I'm a little new at this so forgive my lack of craft beer ""buzzwords," but for some reason this beer just went really well with food. It was flavorful enough but not overpowering. I've had beers before that were basically meals in-and-of-themselves, and those beers can be good- but when eating steak and shrimp and potatoes and other steakhouse staples, the star of the show shouldn't necessarily be the beer. The BP Toasted Lager was a nice compliment."
"Pours to a thin white head and amber color. Moderate lacing. Aroma is toasty and malty with sweet wine and no hop nose. Flavor is caramel malts and sweet grapes. Mouthfeel is light and slightly sticky and very soda-like. Overall, a solid citizen. Good call."
"While I enjoy the slightly toasty aroma this gives off and the crisp, refreshing mouthfeel, there is some underlying off flavors along with some astringent alcohol building as the lager warms.  I feel like this had some serious potential, but the off flavors are the aftertaste is all about, and frankly it isn’t a good one.  Maybe it was an bad batch, or maybe this is how its always been, but either way, I won’t be revisiting this one again anytime soon."

"A thanks to woodychandler for more canned beer. I had this one in a bottle before, but seemed to be much better from the can. Has a dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is malty, slightly sweet. Taste is refreshing, lots of malts, some caramel and honey, a bit sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a great warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Average craft lager, nothing special here."
""
""
""
"Grabbed this as the only beer on the shelf at a shop in Hell's Kitchen that I hadn't tried. Pretty beer for a lager - kinda red-orange in tint. Light head. Initial reactions by smell were promising, but the beer didn't deliver. A little too much throaty almost mildew taste for me - nearly like That Homebrew Taste. Got over it pretty fast. Pretty malty at the outset, but some hop character shows through at the end. OK beer, but I'm not sure I would buy it again."

"Pours an attractive dark copper-tinted amber, moderate head, some retention. Scent is light... some sweet caramely malt, dried grain husk, some watery fruit and earthy hop presence. Taste has a bit of sweet caramel but leans towards a more dried, husky and bready note, not really a grain profile I found in other beers that i would actually call toasted. Some light fruit and earhty hops round out the taste. Medium bodied but way too prickly. Drinkable but unmemorable."

"My pour netted me two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sweetness that I do not generally find in standard lagers. This had more of a caramel-like sweetness as opposed to the standard malt-driven sweetness that comes with non-adjunct lagers. I have really come to embrace lagers in recent years, having routinely poo-poohed them in my hophead salad days. The more I sniffed at this one, the more it grew on me. My first sip was very pleasant, surprisingly full for a lager and with a slight mintiness from the hops that balanced nicely with the sweetness noted on the nose. Finish was semi-sweet with the malt balanced well with the hops. I may not want a steady diet of this one, but as a change-up, it sure filled the bill."

"For a vienna style lager and a flagship beer, it was good and flavorful but hardly memorable. It has good, quaffable qualities and is worth seeking out if this is a style you enjoy."

"12 ounce bottle, one of my buddies picked up a single of this for me on a trip out of town. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like toasted malt, toffee, and some bready/grainy malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also the addition of a bit of honey. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a solid brew, I wouldn't mind trying this again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – A decent lager. It has a nice more roasted flavor with a decent semi-sweet, then drier, then semi-sweet profile. Nothing to exceptional, but rather easy drinking and at least worth one try."

""
""

""
"Overall: a surprisingly tasty and satisfying lager. I rather like it."
""
""
""

""

"A decent lager that beats the pants off of the big American macro-lagers and most popular Mexicans as well. But absolutely not worth the $10/6-pack I paid at my corner bodega. That's more expensive than Zombie Dust, and this realization makes me a sad panda."
""
"Clear lots of carbonation bubbles. Thin white head that comes and goes pretty quickly. A light amber color guess you could say that it looks like a lager with a slight toasting to it. Not getting a lot on the nose kinda get a sweet almost caramel smell but you have to be looking for it. Taste is well there is a slight bitterness sweetness on the back of the tongue. Not a ton of flavor or much going on. A hot day beer for sure when you want to cool off and be able to put back a 6 pack. Lots of carbonation on the tongue I poured this first one but probably will drink the rest right out of the can. overall good but for 8 or 9 dollars a 6'er probably not going to grab this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper-tinted gold with a decent head of off-white foam that dissolves to a patchy covering. Sweet, bready malt, clean caramel, and lagery-ish-ness in the nose. Clean, simple, toasted malt sweetness. Caramel, light fruit, and subtle earthiness. Medium-light body. There are other, better Vienna lagers available around here that make picking this up again unlikely. Not terrible though..."
""
""
""
""
"I must say I like this beer much more out of the can. Its not buttery but crisp and easily drinkable."
""
""

"trying to be fair with this score since i got a bad batch AND i have had this before on tap and don't remember it tasting anything like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good stuff here. It reminded me of some of the cream ales I've had recently. It's very drinkable and I'd have no issues polishing off a 6-pack. It's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O - I liked this much better out of a can than I did the bottled version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking but has a bit of flavor that helps it stand out from your basic lager. The toasted grains don't overpower the beer but add just enough of a note to make you go back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer to get at a bar, but I wouldn't sit down with a six pack. The taste changes to something ordinary over time, but the first 1 or two are fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of a Vienna Lager, there was just too much sweetness and not enough flavor to make this beer worth drinking. This beer didn't have good drinkability, the high amount of sweetness didn't make it smooth, and the bland flavors can't seem to hold my interest, I wouldn't want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were pretty close to being on par for the style. What i liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the bland flavors and aromas, there was a little toast, but not enough to live up the name of a Toasted Lager. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I can think of more then a couple Vienna Lagers that I would much rather have, I don't really recommend this beer, but a Lager lover might like it. This was my first beer from Blue Point and it didn't make for the best first impression for this brewery, a pretty average beer all around, but I am still interested to see what more of their beers are like. Blue Point is going to have to crank it up a notch if they want me to buy their beer, better luck next time guys."
"Had this beer on tap this weekend at Belmont Park in the Paddock Tent. As close to tasting as Sam Adams Boston Lager. Could not distinguish the difference between the two beers. An excellent micro-brew from Long Island New York. Would recommend it most highly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good lager, easy to drink with a better taste than most lagers."
""
"O: Excellent example of style. As expected, it is not bold or complex, but it had no detectable flaws and is highly drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty, satisfyingly refreshing brew, though, for the price, I might have to give the edge to SABL."

"O - This is a pretty good vienna lager. I had heard about it for years. Glad I finally tried it."
""
""
""
""

""

"O- This beer was fairly average for a lager. I wasn't a huge fan, but it wasn't bad. A little bit different then most lagers, especially in terms of the taste."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a shaker glass. The beer pours a copper color with about a 1.5 inch off white head. This beer has great clarity. Other than a bit of sweet malt, not much aroma at all. The taste is clean, a small amount of bitterness on the finish, without any fruity notes at all. Pine is the dominant flavor, along with some malt. It has a decent mouthfeel. Overall the beer does not pack much flavor, but that may be true to style. i belive I would go with Samuel Adams Boston Lager, as a preference, over this beer."

"From an undated 22 oz bomber into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!), it goes in a clear honey color with hints of amber, with absolutely great carbonation streams fueling a somewhat anemic white head that fades quickly but is continually refueled, leaving a thin sheet and ring. Nose is surprising sweet, bready, but no “toasted” notes here. Slight butter and caramel. Mild hops, perhaps a bit of citrus. In the mouth, pleasant mild hops, nicely balance malt, a bit of bread and a slightly bitter finish. Smooth, crisp, and slightly viscous. Definitely lends itself to another… and another. Overall: Not terribly remarkable, but a solid lager."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 11/08/2011. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some decent soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of apricot, caramel, toasted malt, bread, and light spiciness. Some decent malty aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of toasted malt, bread, caramel, light fruit, nuttiness, and floral spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of bread, toasted grain, light fruit, and herbal spice on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish present. Smooth and easy drinkability. Good balance of flavors. Overall this is a solid and drinkable Vienna Lager offering. Good amount of flavor and balance."

"Overall: It lacks the bitterness of American incarnations and the crisp, sharpness of German ones, but this is a decent Vienna lager and its popularity (in NYC) makes it a great substitute for the BMC stuff that you usually have to choose from in crappy bars."
"Body-Smooth, light, crisp, refreshing. I like it, very easy going session beer."
"If you like Yuengling you will love this beer. And you'll never touch that beer again. Where Yuengling lacks Toasted makes up the toasted hops make for a great finish and little to no after taste. This beer is the Ideal pizza beer. this beer is my go to beer. I hope every one everyone enjoys this beer as much as I do."
"O: Honestly, this is just okay. I was hoping for a fuller style of lager with this beer, but it just didn't meet that expectation. I would, however, recommend this brew for a newcomer to the beer world, as it is highly drinkable"
"Overall, the beer is fairly sessionable. Seems like the perfect beer for a drinker entering craft beer."
"A very solid lager offering, both winter and summer drinking. Easy-drinking and very little linger. The flavor is well-balanced and there is little to no hop bite. Also, very easy to find on tap or in a bodega in New York City. One of those beers you can drink one or ten!!"
"Tried this lager on tap at Erbellis in Portage MI. Pours with thin white head with thin lacing. True golden color. Not much aroma coming off this beer. I can pick up a faint grain and malt smell. Clean overall. Great taste of toasted bread no wonder they call it a toasted lager. Easy to drink light and a little bitter bite. Better than your macro lagers. Give it a try it is better than the reviews."
"Overall, easy drinking boring beer."
"O: Easy drinker, Not an overpowering beer. A nice change of pace . Seems to go best with food."
"D- Highly enjoyable and refreshing, this is definitely a worthwhile beer if nothing mind blowing."
"I haven't had Toasted Lager in a bottle. Because it is a local brew, it is plentiful on tap on Long Island. As a Vienna lager style, I think it nearly rivals Sam Adams. It even surpasses some big name ales like Bass as a good, everyday kind of beer - at least from my experiences drinking it on tap at places like Katie Mc's in Huntington. Here is a beer with good, deep golden copper color, not highly aromatic, but the taste is clean, easygoing, and yes, toasted, which gives it the character it needs. I've had it before, and I'll have it again."
"Buttery and toasty tasting and goes great with food. Drinks super smooth."
"Not a bad lager from the boys in Patchogue, L.I. I like to have a couple of these during the work week...(usually a Tues. or Wed.)...I say worth the while on a 6-er....also, check out their Blueberry Ale. Nice Spring/Summer ale with an effervescent aroma of fresh blueberries...enjoy!"
"O: Easy drinking, and overall not bad. Not something I would want to drink all the time, but there is nothing wrong with it."
"O - Pretty good, Fully enjoying the offers from Blue Point and I would definitely have this one again"
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a n average size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of light dry cereal notes with some lingering sweetness. Taste is also a mix between some dry generic cereal notes with light lingering sweetness. Body has a somewhat oily texture with medium carbonation. I can’t say I really cared about this one."
"overall i had to try this beer because of all the hype... i prob will never buy it again... it isn't that bad just not good.... definitely not GOLD MEDAL standards if you ask me... but now i know."
" I'm told the ""toasted"" part is due to direct fire-brew kettle technique."
"O/D-Better than expected but I would shy away from a 6-pack because the flavor began to aggravate my taste buds. I liked it however. Maybe try it again randomly if there is a weak tap list."
"Overall not too bad not that impressed, but it alright I guess but can't have much more to say about this. It's no Great Lakes Elliot Ness that's for sure."
"D - Medium-light body, med/heavy CO2. Creamy and drinkable."
"Overall, and average lager. I was expecting more interesting flavor with that ""toasted"" idea. Missing"
"O- very drinkable. while not what I would call great, I can drink lots of these easily, and it is still better than most of the beers in average bars."
"o - Overall a pretty decent lager. Lots of toasted and nuts to it, would have it again."
"A lager by name, and not bad ny taste, this is one I'll get again for sure."
"Overall, this is an above average beer. Very nice. Maybe better for the fall though."
"The CPJ"
"DECENT BUT AVERAGE."
"D - A very nice Vienna Lager... Simple, straight-forward, and effective... Super sessionable... Lots of pilsneresque qualities are mixed in..."
"O: Just OK for the style (one I do like quite a bit), a little too sugary/off-balance for my liking. Not a problem to finish, just not a beer that must be revisited. Thanks for the chance to try this one, Ben."
"Not bad overall and decent for what its supposed to be."
"D: Overall it is a very drinkable beer, nice take on the style and really just a well put together sessionable brew."
"D: an easy drinker, but not a good example of a vienna lager in my opinion. just cause it is an easy drinker doesnt mean you need to sacrifice flavor!"
"Poured on-tap into a pint glass, the beer is a copper gold coloring with lots of bubbles and a thin, sparse, off-white head. Good lacing for the style. The smell is light toasted grains. The flavor is malty, with a honey-sweet characteristic, with toasty and smokey end palate flavors. The aftertaste is almost like a Sugar Daddy that was cooked in a toaster oven. Finish lingers a bit too long. This beer is a bit all over the place, with some very interesting characteristics."
"D- this is where the beer wins, I have it available on 6 pack in many grocery stores so I plan on buying it next time i need to bring one along. great lager, not too complex but unique in the style."
"Taste is somewhat light and easy to drink. Tastes are very well balance of hop/malt. Nice mouthfeel and overall this is a pleasant lager that is typical of the New England styles. It probably isn't worth seeking out to buy a 6er or bulk purchase but its pleasant if offerred in a bar, restaurant or party."
"Very impressed by how dark the body was with a burnt amber color and a fairly thick, frothy head. The aroma is closer to a pale ale with a noticeable caramel scent, although it was definitely mild. Much like the aroma, the taste of the Blue Point Toasted Lager is similar to one you'd find in a quality pale ale. It's crisp and hoppy with a slight bitterness up front. The middle is almost all caramel - not anything too rich, but not overly sweet or candy-like. The finish, however, has a strange tang (but it's barely noticeable). This beer reminds me of Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but is not quite as robust. Despite the name and the brewer's description, I really don't get much of a ""toasted"" taste. There does seem to be a slight creaminess to the texture which helps combine the malts and hops into an overall satisfying flavor. The problem with flavorful lagers is they tend to sacrifice drinkability, but that's not the case here. While initially very bubbly upon being poured, Toasted Lager calms down to the point of being a little less than crisp but a little more than tepid. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thick and gentle, creating for an easy-drinking beer that goes down smooth. The astringent aftertaste lingers for a moment or two, but it's easily ignorable."
"Nothing wrong with it, in line with the style for the most part; A clean drinker, but nothing to suggest I have it again."
"I remember trying something from Blue Point years ago and only remember being disappointed, but everyone deserves a second chance. This beer gives a good enough first impression, pouring from the bottle with a brilliant medium amber color topped by a decent creamy, cream-colored head. The aroma is dull but pleasant, with a light scent of toast and undercooked biscuits. The flavor is more pronounced, with the toastiness and biscuit coming out a bit more. In addition, the dry, bready malt base is balanced by a light lemony hop character. The mouthfeel is a lowlight, though, with a very thin, watery body being punctuated by small, prickly bubbles. Overall, this beer is fine and drinkable, but the distracting mouthfeel drags down my impression, and I am again a bit disappointed."
"Overall: Uncomplicated, but tasty. Not my favorite, but I might choose it again in hot weather if I didn't want to go for a pilsner."
"Overall; nice drinkability but also solid flavor, limiting you from knocking them back too quickly...not necessarily a bad thing."
"O: Glad I didn't buy this beer. It's just slightly above average in my opinion. Better than most of the Mexican breweries making German style beers, but for a micro brewery like Blue Point, this was a definite disappointment."
"O- This one goes down really quick and easy. I thought it was an excellant beer."
" The taste is creamy smooth and mildly yeasty with some toasted malt and grainy flavor that leaves a littel to be desired, the yeast fruitiness is not unpleasant but the flavor drops off midway and the diacetyl is noticeable in the taste. I can't say this is my favorite style, but so many do it better than this. I actually remember enjoying this from the bottle, maybe this keg was not the norm but I didn't really find this to be very drinkable for the style."
"high carbonation and a light body, easy drinker"
"Blue Point Toasted Lager pours a stunning, clear, orange-copper color with no head or lace. The aroma is mainly orange and dough followed by well balanced flavors of citrus, bread, and caramel. The hops and malt work well together. It's got a light-medium mouthfeel and is very drinkable. Blue Point Toasted Lager is good beer, very refreshing and pairs well with chicken and mashed potatoes. Recommended!"
"Nice session beer."
"Pours a two-fingered cream head that fades quickly leaving some chunky lace. Clear amber color. Weak malty/hoppy nose. Strong molasses aroma. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts sweet but hops dominate finish. Moderately bitter after taste. Good with strawberries."
"Toasted Lager pours out almost like an amber ale. It's a bit darker than most traditional lagers are. The head comes and goes with ease. The smell is full of grains and malts. Not much of a hop aroma or anything else really. The flavors I felt were a little bland. When looking at the name on this I expected to get some forms of actual toast in this beer. Something that has that real specific taste of char or burned. I wasn't expecting those flavors to be strong in the brew but just a little bit so you can taste them. I wasn't overly impressed by this beer."
"D: A full-bodied amber lager somewhat comparable to Boston Lager, but with a more malt-focused presence. It brings to mind a personal favorite bottled lager: the (extinct) Golden Bear lager once brewed in Berkeley."
"I would be happy if this brewery would make Toxic Sludge and Rastafar Rye as their only offerings, and let go of their other forgettable beers. Toasted Lager is a must miss."
"Carbonation is on the high side and stays the course. It washes out any attempt for malts to fill out the mouthfeel, but the ensuing lightness makes this a candidate for quaffing."
"My local micro bartender suggested that I'd like this one...based on the lable, I was thinking toasted/biscuit, malty...I think I had my mind set on Fat Tire...but what I got from the first taste was a little more sour than I had expected. I was hoping for a bit more on the toasty side, as I was looking forward to that on my taste buds at that moment...the copper/amber apperance was pleasant, the nose was pleasant, but the taste was nothing better than average and it is not a beer I would seek out or buy again."
"Had been wanting to try this for a very long time, but all its stronger brethren had prolonged that wait. Pours with a small head and light amber hue. Very pleasant full-bodied lager. Nice malt presence and smooth. Great session beer. These recently got into Florida (where I live) so the price is right at $5 for a 22oz bottle in the local big-box booze store."
"This beer had little to no head and was a golden beer a little darker than your standard beers. It had no scent or aroma that stood out, it's mouthfeel was unremarkable. If you just want a beer to drink for beer's sake this beer may be for you. But it was really unimpressive. The toasted larger name set my expectations higher than what they should have been. It is a drinkable beer that i might have enjoyed a lot more in my college years before I developed my beer palate."
"Mouthfeel and taste was true to the style I suppose. Not much better than say a yuengling in my opinion. Probably not a bad session beer in the long run over normal BMC taps."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable Vienna Lager, I could easily drink several glasses of this (makes me look forward to Oktoberfest season too!). I look forward to trying it on tap as well as it's become available from time to time locally in that format."
"Lager is good and so is toasted, the label drew me in as I strolled through TW, well maybe the price too. Let's give this bomber a whirl. Popping the top it reminds me of passing through towns where the beer was brewing, classic. On the pour I get a nice bronze brew with a micro to small bubble head, that dissipates quickly. On the taste, the smell is revisted and the brew has a roasted smell, then indeed a roasted taste. The initial taste is a soild belt of malt goodness, lightly hopped but with enough complimentary bitterness. The taste then reveals a toasted flavor, then finishes relatively clean with a hint of lingering bitterness. In my opinion this would be a great brew for seafood. For the style it hits the mark. A good drinker and great value."
"D - It's very drinkable. Light all the way around. It's not bad, it's not great. Strictly average."
"Finish: The finish was smooth and tasteful."
"Plenty drinkable, but I can't award higher drinkability simply because it's a lager with low-ish ABV. I bought this because I was craving a return to lagers after hitting the big beers consistently for weeks...but there are better lagers to choose from."
"D good drinkable, but I likely will not have another.  I don't like the tingle at the back of the tongue, drinking more makes it go away temporarily, but it returns.  3.5  "
"This raises an interesting question: Why don't they toast ALL lager?"
"Morey's Bottom Line: An above average lager. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this isn't half bad. The carbonation is my biggest criticism....it's just a bit high for this light of a beer."
"Overall, this beer improves drastically when it is fresh from the brewery rather than in the bottle or on tap from elsewhere. Its a very solid lager and worth a try if Vienna lagers are your thing. Cheers!"
"D: I could easily drink a few of these beers in one sitting."
"D - Taken for what it is, this is actually a very drinkable beer. The toasted malt and toffee in the aroma is quite enjoyable and it leads to similar character in the flavor profile. The malt is a touch lighter there but still noticeable. The beer has just enough residual sweetness to keep the malt from developing the burnt bread notes that sometimes occur in excessively dry amber beers and it has a very clean finish that shows that it was well looked after as it conditioned. A nice, simple lager that is very drinkable and very much worth trying if you are in the mood for something light but still flavorful."
"A good beer with good character."
"Mouthfeel is solid with a good balance of flavor and carbonation. Overall this is quite a drinkable beer. Goes down smooth and is very sessionable. Nothing to blow your socks off but very drinkable overall."
"drinkability: New to Jax. had at Engine 15 at their tapping party. nice beer... If I were a person that rates to style this would be an A+"
"Drinkability- A good brew with a flavor that changes on your palate. It has a light feel in your mouth that is refreshing."
"D: Very relaxing, no-pressure beer. Complemented the ham-and-apple-butter sandwich I was having with it nicely."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"The color of sweet tea with a nice frothy head that quickly fades leaving behind wet drippy lacing. Smells like a sweat bread. Nice aroma but a bit one demensional. Good sweet bread and toasty flavors. With a tiny bit of herbal and spicy hop bite in the finish. Flavorful for the style. Mouthfeel is dry, dry, dry. Almost too dry. Overall a nice easy drinking session beer. I wouldn't mind having a few of these at a BBQ."
"D- Drinkable beer but nothing specail. The name is actually tastier."
"Bought 6 pack at Traders Joe. Pours amber with a huge long lasting white head. Aroma of grassy hops and light toasted malt. Tastes lemony hops at the beginning with a dry spicy hop finish. Malt character is very muted for Vienna. Would be not bad for the half the price I paid."
"D: Pretty decent lager, I would say. Nothing that really blows me out of the water, but really easy to drink."
"Pours a bright and clear copper/amber color. Head is large and soapy with moderate stick. Smells pretty appetizing. Toasted grains and a toffee. Palate plays it safe with mildly toasted barley, caramel malts and just enough hops for balance. Pretty drinkable overall but might get a bit tiresome after a few."
"Huge big head on pour -- almost to overflow. Nice clear copper color makes me think I'm in for something special. The taste is like seeing someone you think you went to school with in the mall -- isn't that... What's his name... Looks so familiar... It's a beer you probably think you've had before even if you haven't: think standard amber brewpub fare. A light and pleasant experience in the mouth that I would not turn down but neither here nor there enough to warrant seeking out."
"red amber pour with a decent and a proper look that doesn't give much more. nose is not particularly toasted but dextrose... not grainy though... and bitter malt. palate is sweet and a one dimensional bitter hops malt mixture that doesn't serve for much outside of something that is a typical american session. i wouldn't waste my time unless its your style."
"Pretty medium bodied beer, not too light. It's a chugger. This is one that you could get in 6's or 12's and be fine handing out to the party. Very approachable and easy drinking."
"Overall, it is okay. But I'd urge people to try some of the other Blue Point beers before using this as a guide of what they can do. The Blueberry Ale & Hoptical Illusion are better and I like their Oatmeal Stout."
"quaffable, certainly. but how good?"
"A nicely drinkable beer with a different, rich flavor. My only reservation against buying it again is its $13 price tag, though we're talking Manhattan prices here. I'm sure (or maybe really hoping?) it's cheaper on the Island."
"In the end, just another beer. It gets some things right, in that it pours a vibrant amber color that promises a lot of life and it throws up a rich aroma that blends all sorts of syrups. Unfortunately though it doesn't live up to its own hype. This lager tastes like hoppy, burnt pancakes with a heavy, overly-carbonated introduction and lingering spicy sweetness. Fermenting honey sits on the palate longer than necessary. All in all, not bad per se, but Blue Point can, and does, do better."
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable amber beer. Would definitely enjoy more in the future."
"D - I feel very comfortable drinking this in a sports bar, it is just like swill, only elevated a notch."
"This would be a decent brew by the grill, but not something you'd want to revisit multiple times in a setting. Still, has an easy level of drinkability."
"D - Excellent. Like a lager should be, this is one you can pound a 6 of in no time. I was a little concerned that the Honey Bunches of Oats flavor would get old, but it really didn't."
"Drinkability-A nice easy drink, smooth and enjoyable. Probably won't go looking for it again but will drink it if its around."
"Needs more flavor tastes lite and watery. Lacking character."
"Cracked after back to school night to unwind. Nice pale copper color. One finger white head, and actually some clings to the glass. Really clear. Lightly toasted malts, some noble hops, and a little dank lager yeast meet the nose, nothing incredible. Flavor is unassuming and basic except for the toasty aspect which is detectable and nice. Mild lager quality, not too asertive on the hops. Sessionable for sure, would be more ""drinkable"" but has a lingering after taste. Nice round mouthfeel. Everything about this beer is ok, nothing special but well done."
"This was pretty easy going down, the flavor was ok, not a lot going on here. Overall it's not something I would buy again."
"Tasted from a glass pint. Pours mostly clear with just a touch of haze. An average sized head composed of off white bubbles that dissipated quickly. Color is more or less like clover honey - a hint of amber but mostly gold. An oaky, caramelized malt aroma with walnuts and toasted oats. The taste shows off bread and nuts with balanced malt. No big or offensive flavors, the malt is muted enough that it doesn't overpower. Nice smooth mouthfeel that lingers with a long finish. Very drinkable. I could envision this turning into a popular session lager."
"I'd like to point out there's no highly rated lager, period, which is strange because frankly some people prefer lager. Although I'm an ale man myself, I really do find this a fantastic beer and by far the most enjoyable lager I've had, and am looking forward to drinking it again."
"The flavor is very buttery, with a strange nuttiness as well. Suprisingly sweet, perhaps finishing a little too sweet for my tastes. I'm just not a fan of the buttery flavor. It seems to overwhelm anything else. Would not get again."
"I tried this beer a while back but had forgotten to review it. So today while in my favorite beertique I bought 2 6 packs of the Toasted Lager and two of the Octoberfest. These beers are the only Blue Point brews I have ever tried. But after thoroughly enjoying the Toasted Lager I have suggested it to many friends and will continue to do so"
"Clear light amber with a bit of an orange hue, short yellow/beige cap of fine bubbles that dissipated over about 3 minutes leaving a collar. The foam was a bit sticky and clumpy. Malty aroma, caramel, bread, toast, a bit fruity. Same in the flavour with mild to moderate bitterness up front and lingering fruity bitterness in the finish. Slightly metallic at the end. Decent texture, average carbonation and medium bodied. This is a serviceable lager, tasty enough to have again."
"I've had this beer a few times during the Summer, seems to be becoming more popular locally. Overall a decent brew. Not overly complex. Malt and sweet biscuit flavors dominate. Medium body with low carbonation. Almost reminds me of an English mild ale. I wouldn't turn one down, but not sure I'd seek out. I much prefer Sam Adams or Brooklyn Lager over this brew."
"Amber hues and a finger of white head fizzles to nothing in a short amount of time. On the nose, I get toasted biscuit. Nothing special (or surprising) there. Flavors are mellow toasted bread, and a ... well ... not much else, to be honest. I can't decide if there's hoppiness in there to balance it out. It's malt and water. The hops offer maybe a bit of fruitiness, but I don't want to stretch my imagination. This is a really basic brew, with not a ton of complexity. Caramel and sweetness, with biscuit. That about sums it up. Mouthfeel leaves good residuals, and the carbonation is medium. I'd like to try this one as fresh as possible, so maybe a trip out to the brewery is necessary!"
"Bottle. Not where I got this one but it's cold and looks tempting so lets give it a go. Pours a reddish hued golden color with a very tightly packed white foamy head. I think the malt backbone truly takes center stage in the nose with very little else being evident. It's sweet, not is like super awesome sweet, but flavor wise sort of like apples. Slight alomost barely noticeable hops at the end of this one. It is very smooth tasting, I'll give it that. Not being a huge drinker of Vienna style beers I can't really say if this is great or not but I will say that it is ok."
"Cheers!"
"Blue Point Toasted Lager comes a bottle adorned with all kinds of awards from various beer festivals. It pours a nice clear amber with just a little bit of foam that promptly fizzles out to a bit of dappled white. The aroma is very malty, almost like a maibock with sweet caramelized grain and browned toast. This is mirrored in the taste with rich malts and a hint of herbal hop bitterness in the finish that melds well with the malt flavor of the lager. The beer finished smooth and clean with a bit of residual sweetness. I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"d: decent flavors/aromas here but too much unchecked sweetness to be very drinkable"
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper copper with a white head. In the aroma a sweet roasty malty, almost nutty. In the taste, a small roasty malt, sweet nuttiness, and lager-ish. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry roasty malt in the aftertaste. Smooth and roasty, somewhat like Yuengling without the bite."
"I could definitely see myself drinking a few more of these, relaxing."
"Pours a great color into a pint glass, smooth and creamy on the tongue, with a nice toasted flavor. Definitely a beer I could drink more than one of, and generally one I would choose over other lagers on tap."
"Crisp and clean first impression with a doughy, substantial middle and a creamy but semi-dry finish. Fine texture with mellow carbonation. Very drinkable indeed with lots of character to keep the drinker interested. I'm a fan."
"Drinkability: Are you kidding me? This stuff is great! On my list of ""six packs to buy whenever"" list. Blue Point has yet to let me down!"
"Value: I paid $2.99 for a big one. Not bad...not bad at all. In fact, I'm going to buy a few more of these while I can get 'em at that price."
"D - This is a good drinking beer, and probably a good microbrew for the beginners. I dont find much special with this at all, but a good solid beer"
"Received as a share of a Blue Point mix pack. No brewed on/best by date to be found. Poured a reddish brown with a minimal head that escaped into the ether quickly. No lacing. Solid carbonation. A mostly pleasant aroma. I can definitely taste the 'toasty' flavor in this brew, it almost has a smoked kind of flavor to it, with a warm finish. Perhaps if it weren't brutally cold and windy today, I could see myself enjoying this out in the backyard. A nice offering from Blue Point, but not something I would actively seek out."
"MD- Although this beer is very easy drinking and I can't really say anything bad about, I wouldn't look for it again."
"Very drinkable - I once drank 1/2 a keg of this on a ski trip, and have always wanted more."
"D - Well I really don't like lagers at all but this one seems like a good one. Nice"
"Pours an amberish brown with a nice beige head. Nose has stale hops, caramel and mellow malts. Similar flavor profile. Bready malts and some grassy hops. Light body drinks well. Clean finish. Decent beer. Not too much going on, but a good session lager."
"A clean and simple beer, great balance make it smooth, easy to drink. A great sessional."
"Pretty decent body for a lager and very easy to drink."
"Very drinkable but nothing exceptional. I would drink a few of these at a bar but won't seek out for the old personal stash."
"Notes: This is a very simple brew that's decently drinkable. Cheers."
"D-light and easy to drink. Pretty nice flavors that just are a little off from being darn good. The carbonation seems to be on the high side"
"D - Easy drinking, non-offensive lager."
"Well carbonated however the mouthfeel seems a little oily which makes it not so refreshing either. all in all it's a decent beer but not one to go out of your way for."
"Amber colored beer with a head that hangs around for a few minutes.Aroma is hops and malt.Taste is toasted biscuits and sweet malts.Overall a pretty good beer that is pretty smooth and refreshing.I would recommend to try at least once.I can see myself buying this again down the road."
"Overall this beer is pretty sub par for what I'd expect from Blue Point from what I keep hearing, but this is my first experience. Given the aroma you can just tell this beer doesn't fit the high technical standards of a premium lager. Probably a contract brew."
"The feel of this beer is quite crisp. If feels as though you are breaking into this beer and stealing a sip. I was quite impressed by how nice the finish really was. It felt so professional and that counts for something. It is really refreshing and easy going down. A good brew."
"Poured a orangish copper with good caronation and big white head. A sexy brew. Nose is light hops, grains, caramel. Taste is caramel, bread, light hops, a modest roasted graininess, very light booze. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. I enjoyed it."
"D- Goes down smooth and is sessionable. Quite drinkable overall..."
"D- Overall, this isn't a bad lager but I do find it to be a little bland. There really isn't anything ""off", but I think if the flavors were enhanced this would be a very solid brew."
"I am happy that this beer exists though there are many other Blue Point beers I would reach for first. I consider this beer a solid dinner time brew but on its own, it is somewhat lacking."
"Overall there was nothing outstanding about this beer but for some reason I found myself drinking it down quicker than normal. Very easy drinking and worth a shot."
"Since I went all the way to Patchogue NY to visit the brewery and buy this I'm going to pretend it was brewed on premises. So there."
"Overall, a nice sessionable offering from Blue Point. It makes a nice substitute for flavorless lagers, and I'd have it again."
"The body is crisp and fresh. Good carbonation level. Nice sharp lager flavors of grains, light toffee, and a short bitter bite at the finish. Dang. This was really refreshing and tasty. I could make this a regular with my cookouts this summer. Recommend."
"Copper /orange in color. Depth of head varied greatly depending on the pour, whitish, lingered. Not much of an aroma -- hints of fruit -- apple, ? pineapple. Taste is bready, toasted as the name suggests, ? hints of rye / caraway. Feel is combo of crisp and creamy, bit heavier than many lagers. Easy to drink. Decent lager, but definitely better ones out there in the genre."
"D - Very drinkable beer. I was rather excited to see this on tap at dinner in a random restaurant."
"Starts with a dark golden color, medium cream head and chocolate malts in the nose. There is a lot of flavor and surprising balance. The texture is crisp and refreshing but still strong enough. Lots of bready malts accompanying a surpisingly sturdy hop presence and a nutty finish. Overall this has always been a good ""comfort"" beer in the bars of Long Island"
"Overall - A well done lager"
"Poured into a Sam Adam's glass. Great amber color, was a bit darker than I thought it would be. Nice big foamy head that disapates to thin film with OK lacing. Nice sweet tasting a little hint of citrus. Worked well on a hot day. Very refreshing. Not sure what toasted means here."
"D - Good drinkability, but kind of filling and not an exciting enough flavor to go right back to if you've bought a variety pack, which I recommend doing with this beer."
"D- A solid brew for its style. Good session beer."
"D: Very easy drinking for this one. Good for a session brew."
"You get a finger plus head of off-white foam, creamy foam with slight dimpling, slightly above average lacing and decent retention. Red clay to copper orange in color, just short of full transparency, mild infusion of yellow around the rims. Soft malts in the nose, more texturally present than deeply scented, malted milk balls, dried molasses, buttermilk, not a lot of hop presence, perhaps some orange peel and apricot pit. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is foamy yet stops short of getting too large and diffusing the flavors. Metallic edge to the mouth entry, iron and rust, delays the registering of the flowers and more tart orange to lemon peel. Here, the caramel and butterscotch malty flavors less overt, although you kinda wish they were. Hint of raw nuts. The prickle from the carbonation does extend its presence in the absence of more resonant flavors. No big flaws, simply a bit boring and ho-hum, don't find it growing on me with repeated sips."
"I poured this exceptional beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was almond colored almost and had a nice tan colored head. The beer had the best lacing I have seen in a beer in a long time. It actually left rings all the way down the glass. The taste was fantastic with toasted malty caramelly notes. I will buy this again for sure."
"shouldn't be priced like most micro's. not worth the dough..but if you see it out in a bar throw two back....you're gonna need the 1st one to warm up your taste to it so you can enjoy the 2nd."
"Pours a dark amber with a big white head. Aromas are faint but favor the malty end of the spectrum. Malts and hops are nicely balanced on the palate. Tastes are initially hop-forward and earthy, giving way to a rustic [and indeed ""toasty""] malt sweetness. Medium body crackles with lively carbonation. Very enjoyable all on its own."
"Drinkability: I can see this being refreshing on a hot day, but there are many other beers I would reach for first. I will not be trying this again."
"This is a very good beer. I don't know if it's the suggestion of the name or the actual ingredients/process but this has a very toasty taste that is very good. I'm not a big amber lager drinker - I'd prefer pislners in lagers and toasty and other extreme flavors in my ales but this is a very good beer that i would highly recommend. Good flavor, great aroma, good dark color."
"12 ouncer, I can find no freshness/bottling date info. Pours clear, dull orange tinged amber. Light khaki head, showing some retentive powers and then going to a thick collar/film and respectable sliding lace. Bright malty nose, with a hay like quality to it. Nutty amber brew, pleasant enough stuff. Decent sesioner. Nothing special, but not a bad brew to expose a micro newbie to."
"One of the better examples of the style. I like it a smidge more than Samuel Adams BL or Brooklyn Lager, though I think Great Lakes' Eliot Ness tops it by a nose. Great gateway beer for beginning beer drinkers or those transitioning into craft--stock a cooler, have some folks over, and see what they think."
"-Oelergud"
"D - Refreshing and very drinkable."
"Poured a nice golden, carbonated color with a finger of white head that laced spottily. The smell didn't yield as much roasted malt and biscuit as I would have expected; in fact the hop bitterness was slightly more prominent. However, the flavor did yield a more prominent roasted maltiness, balanced by a bitter crisp finish with no lingering aftertaste. Good carbo mouthfeel, and certainly a sessionable beer."
"As I said before, this is one of my all time fav's, and I can't recommend it enough!"
"Nothing unique about this lager, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think this is a good example of what a lager should taste like."
"This poured a clear dark gold with lots of light tan head. It smelled like bready yeast and lemon hops, with roasted barley and wheat. It tasted like roasted barley and earthy caramel, with creamy yeast and a bit of copper. It was somewhat thick with smooth carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice clean taste and an ultra smooth body. There was nothing too unique or rich about the character, but it was super easy to drink. Nice refreshing and enjoyable beer."
"With that flavor and mouthfeel, this rates huge in my book of drinkability. This is far from my favorite style, but this one now sits at the top."
"A very good lager, more akin to a vienna lager in my opinion. Nothing great, but solid overall."
"Overall: strengthens its consistency as the glass drains; caramel comes to the fore, an interesting flavor to a lager... holds its own against the cigar I am smoking...one suggestion: flaunting medals on the label is a bit of shameless self-promotion, no? Let the beer do the talking, as this lager is capable of..."
" have to say that although I am more a fan of ales this Toasted Lager was very enjoyable. It is a beer I could see myself coming home and drinking while relaxing or drinking with friends at the bar. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
"Not a bad Amber Ale. Not a bad beer, it's just not for me. Still, I'd recommend it for a good summer lager."
"D- I think of this in the ""sessionable"" category, and I think of it fondly. Easy to drink, light and good flavor....but not complex or super unique."
"D-Pretty decent. It won an award a couple years back (as displayed on the six-pack holder), which I feel it deserved. I noticed this beer was available at most of the bars we visited while I was in NYC, so it seemed to be relatively popular. I definitely liked it."
"Poured a cloudy light brown with a good tan head and had a mellow hoppy aroma with some biscuit malt in the smell. Smooth, woody/smokey I guess, mild hop and malt flavors in the beer but it goes down easy and is pleasant to drink. More hop bitterness/dryness than sweet, yet this went down easy at lunch and I could easily order another despite its simplicity."
"D: Would be a very good session beer but is not too unique in the whole scope of brews. Solid craftsmanship and flavor."
"Drinkability is good. This pairs with quite a bit and is pretty balanced. Nothing outstanding, but its the fact that this is easily available and better than average makes this something I'd drink again."
"T/M - Light to medium body with a kind of smooth feeling in the mouth. The taste tends to be bitter and tart with a few malts in the background that ends dry. It actually went down fairly fast."
"Pours a perfectly clear orange amber with a good sized crème head that falls rather quickly. Nose is like toasted (surprise!) grains. Flavor is much of the same. Kind of a sweet character that stays consistent throughout as well. Feel is thicker on liquid and carbonation is fairly full. This is a good alternative to macro lager crap. If you are visiting the NY area and see it anywhere there is a lack of selection, definitely go for it."
"fresh bottle. Neutral aroma, a bit of coloured body, without noticeable head. If you like toasted lager, this is for you. A little complexity in malt and balanced, so decent for style. Average mouthfeel and carbonation OK. A little like an amber and a festbeer."
"Certainly is refreshing for a warm day, and a good segue beer for non-ba's. Other than that, not much to report."
"Clear copper with a good head. Nose has some fruit, metal, light floral hops. Dry-ish, with some roasted maltiness and a bit of a fruity undertone. Husky grain as well. Quite dry overall and light in body. Quite drinkable with a nice grainy aftertaste."
"Nice head, sticks around for a bit. Amber red beer, pretty nicely carbonated. Hoppy aroma, and a slight bit of toasted grains... not as much as i would have expected from a toasted lager. It smells pretty nice, and upon first sip, i get the toasty bread up front, but never again, just in that first taste. Malty for a lager, and the hops dont carry through the beer, just in aroma. Feels pretty fine, not too heavy, not too sweet, a bit too dry at the finish line. Drinkable, but I think its a good first beer of the night. I would move onto something with a bit more depth. A good beer, by no means great, glad I only picked up two. Try it."
"Thanks Gary."
"Drink ability: Very good, light, and refreshing. I would definitely buy it again."
"D: very drinkable, goes down easily and is refreshing."
"Drinkability: I found this to be a very typical lager...Nothing outstanding, nothing bad either..Just there..A good lawnmower beer, but nothing I would pay a premium for"
"The pour was nice enough with a light, coppery amber and a nice clarity to it. Really intresting mix here of light carbonation and as mooth, white, frothy head. Very light aroma here, soft malts, light grains and a touch of off fruit notes mixed in with a earthy touch to it. The flavor was light, crisp, medium bodied with a light hop notes and a smooth grain profile to it. Really nice bite in the finish as the hops take front and center stage. Light dry finish and a nice smooth touch to finish it off. Overall not bad at all, not the best but still a very sessionable little lager."
"A solid & tasty lager overall. No off flavors, just a straight forward drinkable beer. Could use a bit more flavor (not very robust) but what's there is good. I could blast through a six of this no problem."
"D~ Bought it for the name, just to try. Glad I did. This is a good brew that I strongly recommend to any beer drinker. Good pick-up on my part. :o)"
"This is a very drinkable beer - definitely a session beer. Although I think the slight honey aftertaste would get old after you throw back a few. But overall, it's a pleasantly crisp beer with still some flavor."
"D - Very enjoyable beer. Since it is so smooth it would be easy to drink a pint or two."
"D - Nice easy drinking brew."
"(D) This is a beer that has the potential to grow on you."
"Like a lighter Brooklyn Lager or Sam Adam Boston Lager. Refreshing; the summery beer it's meant to be."
"D - A very enjoyable beer from start to finish. Who says lagers are boring?"
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Notes from 3/19/07"
"Overall good beer, better than most beers on tap where I'm at."
"(rated Feb 13, 2007)"
"Not a bad beer, could make a decent sessioner, but not anything I will buy on a regular basis."
"Pours a dark golden, slightly amber color with 2 full fingers of pillowy white head that is relatively slow to recede. Classic lager aroma (more of the craft than the macro variety if you know what I mean) with, surprise, toasted malts and a bit of hops. Taste is pretty good. Toasty and slightly nutty maybe even with a touch of caramel malts are the focus here with a light hop bitterness and even lighter hop flavor (its relatively indistinct and I can't name a variety or specific characteristics but its a more general, slightly herbal hoppiness). The finish is fairly dry with a light bitterness and a touch of caramel. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good, this was an enjoyable brew that while easy to drink and low in alcohol provided interesting flavors that make it a good session beer."
"D= probably fine if it's what's available for session or party, or maybe on-tap."
"Quite a unique beer.. it is probably the most refreshing and crisp beer I've ever had. Alas, it also has almost no taste and it's very bland. I can't put my finger on it but it's just way too easy to drink which is a very good thing, I can't help but think if they added a little flavor to it this would be a damn good beer."
"It is what it is - for the style, it falls pretty much in line with the basics but is very average in my opinion. I think this would make for a pretty good session beer overall."
"D- The smooth beer has a nice depth of flavor for a session lager."
"Nuff said...it's ok but I'll pass...have a Boston Lager instead."
"My buddy raved about this brew after he had it at the tasting room on Long Island. Naturally, he brought some back with him before he left for school and said that I had to try it. I've heard quite a bit about it and I'll say that I'm pretty impressed with it. I wouldn't rate it as incredibly mind-blowingly excellent, but it's definately way above average in terms of flavor, drinkability, etc. It's just put together really, really well - try it for yourself."
"The drinkablilty is above average. The toasty malts tend to crowd my taste buds, but I could see having a few of these in a sitting."
"Pours a clear amber, dark copper with small, slow bubbles. Good two finger head that quickly dissipates to nicefoamy film. The aroma is a spicey hop citrus with some toasted traditional white bread. The taste starts with a dry bread malt powder. Very toasted malt flavor then combines and finishes with spicey oranges an a litle rye flavors as well. The palate is balanced well bewteen malt and hops. Good sessionable beer. Glad this is available in Illinois."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Best by October 2008 indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent amber with a 1.5 inch tight, off-white head. Excellent retention, with some bands of lacing adhering to one side of the glass during the tasting. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced from the bottom of the glass to the underside of the cap. Scents of malt and wheat (a little bready). Taste consistent with nose, as well as a mild caramel character and a light hoppiness that presents towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light and pleasantly effervescent and also a little creamy. Easy drinking and sessionable brew; wish I tried this one sooner."
"D: Low ABV, was smooth and easy."
" I suppose it could have better balance and be less salty,but this could also be a beer to offer the many friends and family who love Budweiser and are afraid to try something new. I say this not because it is the best offering for a Bud fan,but because it is a simple Lager."
"D, notes: Good sessionability here. I enjoyed this beer."
"This tastes great, nice malt flavor that you can tell has been lightly roasted/toasted. Hops are medium bitterness, and finishes clean. I hate to say balanced but this lager is very balanced. Does not taste like a traditional lager and maybe lacks some of the hop crisp or sharper hop characteristics, the toasted malt makes this very pleasing. Sessionble. Me likey!"
"It can be easily drank, but ends a bit sour. I only had 1/2 of a bottle."
"This is a fairly average American Lager. Could use a bit more complexity but still good to drink."
"D- These seem easy to put down. ON the downside the flavoring isnt all that great. I could prolly do two of these and thats it. A sour salty aftertaste doesnt appeal to me."
"D. Also good here, an upper class lager. Drink away."
"4/1/11 On-tap: Still wish this beer was more impressive. Drinkable, but not a lot better than, say, Negro Modelo."
"Nothing really special here, just a pretty well crafted lager. Craft beers like this irk me a tad, because you want for so much more while drinking it. Ignore the ""toasted"" claim; this is one you could take or leave if something remotely better appeared."
"Easy to drink for sure. A refreshing lager."
"This beer had a clear saffron coloring to it, and poured with a light head as well. I had high expectations since the label had indicated that it was a 2006 World Cup Gold Medal winner, but was surprisingly disappointed to find only an above average lager. I was definitely expecting more of a toasty malt flavor, but instead found a refreshingly balanced, crisp, tasting lager . . . however awkward that sounds. At any rate, still a great beer, I guess I was just misled by the label."
"Lime seared tuna, triple sec marinated salmon? sure!"
"The toasted lager poured a copperish color with a decent size head. It definitely looks fantastic to drink! This beer definitely follows through on the taste as well. It's rich but not filling, and you can definitely taste the ""toasted"" in it. This is a great beer to sit back, relax and enjoy."
"Im definately on board with this one. Great session beer as well as just for a tasting. Would love to make a homebrew clone of this. Cheers to Blue Point!"
"Drinkability: Pretty damn drinkable thanks to the lower ABV. Clean and refreshing. Definitely a go to beer on a hot summer day."
"D - Hands down an easy drinking beer. This could be a good everyday go-to beer."
"D: This is a great beer, will buy again. A superb beer with a truly original taste and feel"
"The Toasted Lager pours a copper body with a thin, white head that leaves behind minimal lacing. A little bit of a floral hop aroma, but not much else there. Mouthfeel is thin, crisp up front. Having a hard time picking up the ""toasted"" part of this lager. Has a slightly bitter finish. Doesn't compare with some of Blue Point's other offerings."
"D_A good crisp lager and a nice change of pace from Brooklyn Lager. I still prefer Brooklyn to this for the most part."
"This beer looked beautiful. The copper almost shined! After that, it's a solid lager. It just doesn't taste as great as it looked."
"Clear amber appearance with some thin lacing. Faint malt with some spice aromas were sensed, nothing too strong. Not too ""toasty"" but it did have a sweet, hoppy taste to it. Good medium body but a bit too watery. Overall, I felt like the drink could have better, but its watery texture hindered any potential it could have had. Simply, just too weak for my tastes."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer to spend some time with. Went down easy and tasted good throughout."
"Tasted on 3/10/08."
"D: Drinkability was warm and toasty making for a big drinking lager with a big flavor."
"D - Could be a good entry level type craft beer. Not really my style but I could see many considering this drinkable."
"I had this when it first came out, and it seems like it has improved a bit. The presentation is quite nice in that it pours a coppery amber color with a nice creamy bubbly head with lots of retention and lacing. The beer is clear and moderately carbonated. The smell is very subdued, I'm getting some sweet malts, husky grains, some very typical lagery yeast aromas, maybe some florals too. The taste is malty, a bit tilted in the direction of caramel, there is some hop in the finish. I'm getting some crystal malt flavors, some slightly toasted grains, some reddish flavors in the background. There is a slight sourishness to this beer in the finish and aftertaste that detracts somewhat. This is a decent beer, not brilliant, but refreshing enough in the right circumstances."
"Drinkability is up there, a very enjoyable beer, glad I picked it up."
"D - Very complete lager IMO. Very easy to drink and very balanced. Not very filling which allows this to be a great session beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber-orange with a thick off-white head that drop quickly, leaving little lacing. Aroma is biscuits, malt and little else. Toasty malt flavor with a hint of bitter grassy hops. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick, with a bitter aftertaste. A decent if unremarkable lager."
"An excellent candidate to offer a macro drinker as a ""crossover beer""."
"Gorgeous, clear amber in the glass with a nice foamy head and bubbles climbing up the sides. Malt (a toasted-like scent, really) in the nose with the same in the initial taste. Nicely balanced fruity/bitter hops and a touch of sweetness that brings the whole beer together. The ""toasty"" flavor is apparent and, actually, quite unique and flavorful. All in all, a very good beer and one that could be enjoyed over and over again. Very smooth and drinkable. Serve this to your macro-loving friends when you're introducing them to micros. They'll be hooked."
"D - Tasty lager with a very clean palate and lots of flavor. The toasted quality really stands out in this brew. Not particularly complex, but certainly aptly named."
"Aftertaste is still malty and a bit chewy. I could drink quite a few of these lagers."
"This is a versitile beer that will, as the great John Molson once said, ""make its own friends."""
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sharp in the mouth, especially on the outset... it doesn't smooth out very well through the duration either. Overall, this beer was definitely a letdown, considering what I have previously heard about it."
"This brew poures to a copper color with a fair sized slightly off white head which seems to have some staying power. Fair amount of lacing being left down the side of the glass. IMO, presentation is pretty good. The aroma is nice, clear malt scent that goes along with its name as it gives a nice toasted scent mixed with a nice hop presence. The taste is quite smooth with, the front end has a nice malt flavor, again slightly toasted with a slight fruit like presence. The tail end shows off a nice hop presence that seems to coat the back of the mouth to give the feeling of the hops sticking around for a while. Quite easy drinking brew, possibly not a sessional one for me just due to the hop presence and residual taste, take this with a grain of salt as I am not usually one to have a very hoppy brew as a sessional. Overall this is a nice brew, some nice flavors coming out. This is a keeper."
"Copped a single 12oz beer for $1.49 at Wine and More in West Orange... glad I only got one, because even though this is an all-around good brew, it's nothing exotic or above and beyond... The appearance was better than average, with a decent foam head... smell was somewhat bland and didn't really have a strong aroma... The taste was crisp, clear, and went down really smooth... no prob at all drinking a clear-cut brew like this... Although I wouldn't want to run out to buy a sixer of this, it was a nice sample that I did enjoy... Recommended..."
"Blue Point Brewing Company is a great brewery, almost all their beers are top notch. The Toasted Lager is my favorite. Nice lager taste and color. Very refreshing, any time of year. A great hop'py bite, right there for you to taste, but not overpowering at all. A great beer to have when you plan to have 12 or so, not filling at all. Love it."
"Pours a vibrant amber with dark gold highlights and great head retention. The aromas are of buttery, toasted grains, with hints of earthy hops and hazelnuts. On the palate, there's some nice acidity/sourness first off, before things dry a bit into some toasty grape nut flavors. The finish is a bit sour and clings to the tongue. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with good acidity and perfect carbonation. Overall, a very solid lager but nothing too special."
"The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a decent balance of carbonation. Overall very drinkable, but nothing to write home about."
"Medium-light as far as body is concerned, with a crisp finish. The remnants of the head lace all the way down the glass. It's nice, nothing spectacular. Perhaps a good transition for rookie BA's."
"M/D - Subtle flavors that move around smoothly and cleanly in the mouth. That's one characteristic that I've taken from lagers. That they're very ""clean"" tasting. This Toasted Lager doesn't stray far from the middle of the pack but it doesn't disappoint either. I would definitely have another bottle or order another pint. Recommended."
"Pours a light copper hue with a hint of amber. Nice two finger off white head that slowly dies down to a thin layer of frothy goodness. Stickiness is pretty good, some spotty lacing leaving its mark. Smell is of buttery noble hops, caramel malt, and a bit of nuttiness in there as well. Ok, but not the best smelling beer by any means. Taste starts off with a dry caramel malt and some sweet candy like sugar. Aftertaste is a bit on the dry side with a popcorn like flavor. Mouthfeel is a smooth light/medium body with a noticable carbonation tingle. Pretty good drinkability, but there are definitely more lagers out there I'd prefer."
"This was a tough beer for me to review. It just didn't do much for me."
"A pretty decent example of an Amber lager"
"I didn't pour this.... Decent lager, with a bit of hop bitterness that I wasn't expecting. Had that nice roasted...or shall I say ""toasted"" flavor. Fairly smooth, but again, with that bite, not as smooth as I thought it would be. I would drink it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Had a nice full-flavor, though, and the bite wasn't too bad. I'm not a hophead, so that's why I mention the ""bite"" all the time. This was balaced fairly well though. Worth a try, I'd say."
"Pours a very nice amber with an orange hue. Thin off white head,with excellent retention,and lacing.Aroma is of honey,and sweet malts. Nice,but a bit weak. Body is light to medium,with some carbionation. Taste is of sweet fruit,and honey,with a nice little hop balance. Not bad."
"Got this on tap at The Mews in Wakefield, RI. Despite the dim lighting in the bar this one was a nice golden amber without much head to speak of, though perhaps that had more to do with the pour than the beer. I didn't notice much of a nose to this one, smelled clean, good for the style, but nothing impressive. The taste and mouthfeel were smooth with some hop bitterness to keep it interesting, I'd almost describe it as an Amber ale dialed down to mute. The beer is very crisp and refreshing, I ordered a second one. Worth a try."
"Overall, an interesting lager. Pleasing at first, but it didn't persist after warming. Drank cold, this would be much better."
"Pours a brilliant colour, reddish, orange, very clear, just amazing, thick white head, lots of lace, great retention, head never leaves, I have to give this a 5 for appearance, simply one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Smell is sweet, very malty, bit of toast, floral, almost adjuncty, corn, disappointing. Taste is much better, sweet, caramel, floral, citrus, very fruity hops, very assertive citric bitterness, malty toast finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Flavour is really nice, appearance is amazing, smell kind of turned me off. Maybe better aroma when fresh? Still good!"
"Poured from a brown, 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer has a nice, copper color, but poured with relatively no head and only mild lacing. There is not much aroma to comment on; slightly malty and grassy, but nothing distinct. I had anticipated a richer or mildly smoky aroma. Similarly, I anticipated that in its taste as well, however, instead it tasted like a basic lager with a faint roasted malt and mild sweetness. It is a decent lager, but not as interesting as I had hoped. On the upside, it is a nice tasting beer and easy to drink. It was a welcome refreshment on a hot Saturday."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, some spices, and lots of caramel. The taste is kinda sweet, malty, hoppy, nice little spice bite, and lots of caramel. There is a nice clean finish. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice amber lager, would recommended."
"I wouldn't deny that this is decently brewed, but it's simply so uninteresting, even if seeking a simple, summertime lager. Fantastically in·sip·id.The best description may just be ""meh"" ..."
"Good nuttyness due to the toasting, leads off this highly drinkable, if unexciting brew. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Malts lead off with the nuttyness, and hops don't really appear until the finish, imparting a tea-like quality I mentioned in the aroma.	 Pleasant, though uninspiring, this is easy to drink, and could make a nice session beer."
"Poured from a brown bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with about two fingers of off-white foam that leaves a slight lace on the glass. Smells of, as the name suggests, of sweet malt, and bread along with crisp fruit. Taste is, again, of sweet toasted malts followed by a nice dose of mildly bitter, fruity hops. Finish is also clean and slightly dry. Medium in both body and carbonation. I wish I would have thrown more than one of these into my mixed sixer. Well done."
"Had on draft at Friscoe's Grille, Columbia, MD. Pours a deep gold, with a thin off-white head. It smells malty sweet, with a slight nuttiness. Tasted malty sweet, a hint of roasted (toasted??) malt, and a slight dry finish. It was fairly smooth, thin to medium on the tongue, but did not linger. Overall a decent American lager, which woud be tasty on a warm day."
"This was a nice light malty alternative on a hot afternoon. Pleasant to drink."
"No flaws, but nothing special either."
"A nice, easygoing beer. Not trying too hard, good at being what it is."
"Bottom line: I like this Amber Lager and I thank jwc215 for including this in our trade!"
"Easy enough to drink, but rather bland, even for the style. Nothing special about it."
"D - Overall a pretty solid beer, but without enough of a presence to really hold up to that second or third bottle. File this under mix-pack."
"As a side note, I had a taste of this beer that my girlfriend got on-tap. It definitely tasted better, so I recommend a draft of this over a bottle of it."
"prosit und Zun Wohl. MK"
"Pours a dark amber with a frothy head which dissipates quickly, leaving spotty lacing. Carbonation is big to begin with, but settles and is fairly consistant if mellow. Smells attractive -- the toasted malts are sweet and bready. They're also prominent on the tongue, but they're balanced by a faint bitter hop. Thick body for a lager, but easily quaffed. Another good showing from Blue Point, and a great example of what can be done with an American lager."
"D: At 5.3%, this is a beer that I could easily pound in the middle of the summer or on the coldest darkest winter night."
"The beer came out of the tap ice cold. The taste is light and a bit caramel-y when going down and sitting in my mouth, but the after-taste, enhanced by the cold temperature, was sharp and lingering. Tasted great to me."
"D- The aftertaste does not leave you really wanting to taste more of it though it is pretty easy to drink."
"5.3 % ABV"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, it might be a good transitional beer for those that are trying to ease their way into craft beer. However, I prefer something more flavorful and with more of a kick to it."
"The aroma promises more than the flavor can deliver, and that's not for want of trying, but it's just too one-dimensional, and thin at that, once it hits the palate. Though, it is still refreshing, in its way, and drinkable as a consequence. It seems to have won a medal, but while I will eventually finish what I have of this, I have to wonder at the level of the competition. I think this is a beer that would benefit by a beating hot sun and a demanding thirst."
"Would be a very good session lager."
"Overall- Maybe a little past its prime? Probably better right off tap. Otherwise nothing special here."
"All in all pretty drinkable. has hints of a roasted, almost nutty flavor as well. A nice buy if you can find it"
"Cheers!"
"I was intrigued by the toasted lager label and decided to give this one a whirl. This beer poured deep golden color and had huge foamy head but that didnt last very long. It didnt have much of a smell. This was a pretty traditional tasting lager with a slightly nutty tasting finish (this must be the toasted part). It was drinkable but I wouldnt go out of my way for it."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. Some may not like the minor hoppy bite, but that doesn't bother me."
"Pours a dark golden amber color with a nice foamy head. The aromas are a light roast, caramel, and some light floral hops. A nice and pleasant amount of malt too. To me this is a good session brew when a place is serving it fresh. I could put back quite a few of these easily. It's a great beer to drink with food as well. A rock solid amber lager that hits the spot almost anytime. This is their most common beer but Blue Point definitely makes better ones than this so if this is all you've tried get out there and sample the others."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. It's quite a drinkable beer, but there are much better beers from Blue Point. Overall I'd reccoemmend it if you're looking for something easy to pick up and drink; but if you're feeling adventurous I'd look elsewhere around their brewery."
"A very drinkable beer,refreshing and quite enjoyable,it could use a little more hop presence to balance out the malt. Overall,not a bad beer,would drink this again."
"I've been a fan of the last couple offerings from Blue Point for as many adds I've seen about these two breweries in beer publications it's amazing I've never seen them. Appears a nice copper amber hue with a nice off whtie head leaves even webbed lacing as it slowly dwindles away. Aroma has a mild zingling pine/citrus hop combo with some toasted grain brings about light nut/biscuit components and a trace of caramel presence, but I was taken a back from the hops I was picking up especially for a flagship lager. Taste contains a mix of mineral tones, caramel biscuit malts, and expressive hop flavors including pine and citrus with mild overall bitterness, the malts were very nice toasty as the label describes. Mouthfeel is medium to light body range even natural carbonation some light hop slick oily feeling about it, damn. Drinkability comes off with a classic flavorful lager damn tasty good hop presence and I could drink these all day, definitely a fan of this and the Hoptical Illusion."
"The subsequent taste was very smooth, malty, and slightly bitter. It didn't explode with huge fruit, but it easy to drink and would probably be great on draft."
"Lying somewhere between an American Amber and a Vienna, a nice sessionable lager."
"This beer is courtesy of one of my old college friends that lives in this area of Long Island. The beer poured a medium amber color and formed a foamy white head that coated the glass with lace. A mild aroma of hops, grain and banana. The flavor was slightly of hops and grain. A medium light body and a sweet finish. Not a bad session beer."
"Pours an amber color with a very slight head. Smells of malt and roasty nuts (mmm, roasty nuts...). Tastes almost like a nut brown ale, but with a little hop hint...also a little citrus comes back on the aftertaste...a good lager. Very drinkable offering from the Patchogue brewery."
"Comments: I enjoyed this lager from Blue Point, but did not find it overly exciting, More full flavored than your standard lager, but nothing out of the ordinary. Would have liked it to be more toasty per the name..."
"D: Drinkable, but not overly impressive. Blue Point makes some good offerings so I'd try this if you're looking for a good summer lager, otherwise, pass."
"This beer has really improved over the years. A simple easy drinking lager. An excellent session beer with a good flavor. My new local favorite."
"Ah what a treat: I wasn't expecting anything exceptional but this turned out to be a very tasty and highly drinkable lager. For those tired of the ubiquity of hops, this toasted lager is a taste bud sanctuary. It pours a nice dark gold-amber color, with a foamy, though short lasting, head. The smell is malty, with hints of yeast. The taste is pleasantly flavorful. What does that mean? Give it a try and you will knoew. A very nice brew. I wish I had not waited so long to give this a try."
"Being as I am so local to the brewery I managed to score a keg of this for my housewarming party and it went over great."
"Wow, I loved this lager. It poured a dark blonde basically a light brown with a foamy tan head. The aroma is initially sour musty with a sweet fruity background followed by a oaky vanilla flavor. The taste is fantastic, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, sugar cookies are all upfront with a pungent spicy lemon citrus background for balance. This is a playful lager that tantalizes the palate with sweet and funky notes."
"i think drinking this out of a bottle, tho, might leave a little to be desired. this is a pint beer due to its NOT OVERWHELMING characteristics. meaning that you need to really drink a good helping of this guy to really appreciate whats going on. the paltry 12 oz serving common to US bottles isnt going to impress."
"Poured a crystal clear deep amber color with modest white puffy head that slowly fell to a thin coating with no lacing. Smell is mild for toasted malt and a slight metallic note. Taste is malty with a light hop bitterness. The same metallic taste as in the smell is also in the background. Nice refreshing finish with a nice balcance of the malt and hops. A nice pleasurable beer with excellent drinkablility."
"Overall-I've had many Amber Lagers that put this to shame but that by no means makes this a bad choice, lighter version of the style, not too bad."
"All in all, an enjoyable brew... not a big beer, but a well-crafted enjoyable beer that has good balance, some complexity, but is approachable and drinkable for those times when you want a good lager with real flavor... a lager that might even win over your ""lite-beer"" drinking friends."
"This beer is similar to Sam Adams Boston Lager in all respects. I find it, however, to be a bit hoppier and a bit less malty - both of which add to its drinkability."
"Drinkability was strictly average. Not a bad beer to have around, better than a macro, but there are plenty of other micros with more going for them."
"While this is exactly without an aroma it is low enough in intensity that if it were a fart no one could pinpoint the origin enough to lay blame on any one person. Vaguely hoppy is all I can say. Tea colored..thin filmy white head. Slight metallic tinge in the fore yields to a fairly toasty (hey like the name) grain flavor with mild hop notes and a tinge of sweetness."
"Got this on tap at Brickhouse Brewery in Patchogue, NY, right around the corner from Blue Point Brewery. Appearance is a gold color with an inch white head. Lacing is OK. Smell is OK. Taste is sweet malt, with hints of apricot/apple. Mouthfeel is good -- tho' carbonation is a little high, the drinkability of this is quite good. Could easily spend the night drinking just these. Tasty lager. Worth trying."
"Pours a two-fingered cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Weak malty/hoppy nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts sweet but hops dominate finish. Moderately bitter after taste. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"This ones a rich honey-amber color with a simple white head. The aroma is about what was expected: bread crust, a little malt, no fruitiness, light hop aroma, a bit of grainall of moderate intensity. Nice, but nothing special. The taste is a little better: faintly sweet up front, with toasted and caramel malts. Theres a nice balance, but with just enough hops. Finish has a solid bitterness. Medium body, with maybe a bit less than typical carbonation. All in all, this ones better than average, but just slightly over that bar."
"Pours a clear golden honey with a finger of bright white head that subsides quickly, lots of carbonation streams, and a bit of spotty lacing. Aroma is clean and moderately malty with a slight grassy hop aroma. Taste is a sweet malt, lightly toasted as the name indicates, a little grainy, with a decent grassy hop finish. Simple but satisfying. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Not a big lager drinker, but this is a pretty solid one. Picked this up as a single, but I might by a 6 pack for around the house."
"Overall a good looking beer with a better aroma than flavor. It is difficult to judge due to the catch-all character of it's style category, but a drinkable and enjoyable lager."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the clear amber brew. Head deflates rather quickly, down to about half height, with bits of lacing here and there. Aroma is somewhat generically well balanced with light malt and hops presences. Taste is balanced as well, with a bit somewhat sour fruitiness. Mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is limited by that sourness. Not a favorite here."
"Has this on tap at Donnely's public house in Fairport, NY. This came to me with a good head with great lacing. The body was a really good looking amber shade.The smell was sorta toasty and hoppy. Simple but nice. The taste was nice besides the odd metallic flavor i noticed. Roasted malt and good hops to balance. Nothign special but pleasant. Moderate mouthfeel. Moderately drinkable."
"This is a good beer. I know from touring the place that the color comes from the boiler being either on or off, which means the sugar is caramelizing, giving this its color. It's not smoky. The only thing that's weird are the floaters. Recommended."
"I will never pick this one up again. A total bummer!"
"Ultimately forgettable, this was rather a disappointment, as I am very fond of Blue Point's ""Hoptical Illusion."" I'm glad I only bought one. I wont be having this beer ever again."
"Pours a nice rich,clear amber with a sticky white head,aromas a re a little subdued but a real toasted grain presence is there with light caramel note.Very sturdy mouthfeel goes down smoothly,flavors are toasty and lightly sweet some caramel with a nice hop zing in the finish somewhat herbal.This a very nice food friendly lager great with pizza,nice flavor I would definently buy again."
"Nice light amber with a white head. Smells slightly malty and a bit of spicy hops. Taste is clean somewhat sweet. But where is the toasted caramel malt I was promised? If you call something a toasted lager than it should taste of toasted malt, no? It had a decent body and is drinkable and fogettable. Good for a local market, but not worth it if you aren't drinking it fresh, not worth seeking at all."
"Pours a lighter shade of copper color. Low aroma-some malt traces in there. Malty flavor. Very slight hop bitterness. A faint caramel sweetness to it. Somewhat of a crisp finish. I have no idea what is ""toasted"" in there. Me? Good enough body for style. Overall a nice lager. Perhaps a bit ""perfumey"" but I wouldnt dismiss this beer overall."
"if you like the extremely summery summer beers.. airy lagers with not much to say but a solid flavor and the profile to allow consumption of 10+. go for it. i won't again, but its nothing against blue point."
"light copper tinged amber hue. moderate fading head that didn't last long and spotty lacing. musty, raw, but not overly forward grainy nose. coppery taste with a sweetish tail. nothing too complex to this one, not bad either. mild toasted quality lurks in the background without asserting itself enough to qualify the name. mouthfeel was the weakest aspect, kind of watery with prickly carbonation before the finish. not enough going on in this brew to hold my attention, but not terrible. i wouldn't turn one down but i wouldn't ask for one either."
"This lager poured a clear, coppery amber color with creamy, tan foam that settled and clung to the glass in streaks. The smell was lightly malty with a touch of sweetness, though very modest overall. The taste was malty with a light sweetness and a touch of toastiness. Lightly tangy with a mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. The aftertaste was tangy and almost ""soapy"". This was an OK lager."
"Overall: Pretty decent crack at it, but it's nothing to not the socks off. Would make a pleasant session brew."
"Last swigs: Reminds me a little bit of Fat Tire. Clean and brisk. A good convert beer. Paid $2 for 1 12 oz'er at the Six Pack store. I'd have this again."
"Drinkability: A refreshingly tasty lager with a good malt/hop balance"
"Pours a golden almost amber color with a nice white head. Tons of carbonation bubbles in this one, very lively beer. Nice white head that dissipates to a thin film that sticks around for the full glass. Nothing much on the smell other than a nice maltyness. The taste definately brings out a mild toasted flavor and maybe even a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel seemed a little thin to me but had a nice level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable lager that compares very favorably to most of the lagers out there. The toasted flavor gives it just enough of a twist to make it unique."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, yet slightly sweet malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It has a victory malt and lager yeast aroma as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty flavor. It has a light crystal malt feel with a slight toasted flavor. It goes down easy and finishes dry and malty. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great lager. It has good flavor and aroma; a fine sessions beer."
"Nothing here to make me attempt handstands but posssibly something to use to lure bud drinkers away from their bud habits."
"I had a few of these I liked it so much. It was tasty and you don't notice how much you drink of it. A superb beer and a nice surprise."
"Although I know that my judgement of this beer is slightly biast, because I live nearby the brewery, I still think that this is one of the better beers that I have tasted. Although, I must agree that I have had it in the bottle , purchased at a local store, and it was not as good as the fresh distinct taste on tap at the brewery. The toasted flavor is distinct and original, at least to me and I can drink it all night and not get tired of it."
"Pours clearish medium amber, minimal head that quickly dissipates. Moderately carbonated. Smells of toasted hops and alcohol. Tastes follow with bitter toasty hops, a little wheats, and hints of alcohol skunk. A light bodied lager, wasn't too bad, but nothing special."
"This was the first Blue Point Beer I tried, as I am sure is the same with the rest of you. This is a great beer, although when I go to th brewery I generally stick to the Oatmeal Stout, Crop Circle and Hoptical Illusion!!!! The Toasted lager is a great introductory beer to the Blue Point Brewery, where you can see the incredile ingredients they use and maybe it will tempt you enough to visit them! If you are ever on Long Island you gotta give them a visit...maybe you will see me there :)"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. Nice flagship brew."
"Thanks Lupe and BIF 10 for binging this one to me."
"Nice coppery red color with a small head that left pretty good lacing behind. Not much of any kind of nose to speak of. Citrusy, grainy hoppy taste that was kind of like malty lemon bread in a bottle. Really refrehing, smooth and well balanced, helped counter the burning hot sun on the shadeless patio. Clean finish, quite drinkable, I'm not usually much of a lager drinker but I'd pick up another one of these."
"First sip reveals an average bodied brew with medium carbonation. Flavor is overall mild with some caramel mixing with a light grassy hop flavor. THe beer is crisp and refreshing, easy to drink. Not sure why it is called ""toasted"" lager?"
"Drinkability: If you were looking for a malter basic lager, this is your ticket. I was neither displeased or impressed by this beer. No real feelings for it at all."
"This is thicker bodied than other lagers, which gives it a good mouthfeel. Very smooth on the tongue, relatively clean finish. May not look that good, but the flavor and mouthfeel make this very drinkable."
"Contract brewed by Clipper City in Baltimore, MD - fresh off the bottling line from the brewery. It's crystal clear copper body rests gently beneath a short head of light tan foam that drops shortly to a wide, creamy collar and leaves some nice, thin lace about the glass. The nose is exceptionally clean with a light note of yeasty fruitiness and some mildly sweet and lightly toasted malt. The body is medium/light, and it's very fine, moderate carbonation lightly caresses the tongue before it slides away effortlessly. The lightly toasted malts found in the nose return in the flavor with a bit of leafy hop flavor and some delicate, berry-like fruitiness. It's backed by a solid bitterness that becomes quite apparent towards the swallow, and leads into a dry, grainy finish that lingers in the mouth but never builds beyond that. Very well brewed."
"Flavor is malty and sweet, with a lagery mellowness and very little hops. I'm not sure what's toasted about this, only a very light toasted malt presence. Mild carbonation, medium body. Good drinkin'."
"On the downside, this one tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. I'd like to seek it out on-tap to get a better sense of this brew."
"Nice orange/amber color with a small head. The aroma is clean but does not seem like anything special. The taste is balanced with a bit of hop bitterness to finish then it all goes away. No bready or toasted flavors. The name alone makes me look for something extra, which I didnt find. If it wasnt called ""Toasted"" maybe I would not have been disapointed. It is a good beer, but not outstanding. Easier to drink than Sam Adams but very similar."
"blue point went a bit gimmicky here, brewing a toasted lager, and the result, while pleasant, doesn't change this brew from being anything more than an average to slightly above average lager. it pours a nice amber colour with a decent head. an immediate light toasted graininess is apparent in both smell and taste. there are hints of bread throughout. there's a bit more carbonation here than expected, but certainly nothing overwhelming. every sip goes down fairly smooth as well. no compaints, but nothing to rave about at the same time. certainly a safe bet if you can find it on tap, especially when you're in beer hell, i mean long island."
"The bottle is contract brewed in MD and while the tap version is better and more authentic, the bottle is very good as well. Golden amber color with big fluffy head that laces, appealing aroma with some mild hops and roasted grains. The toasted aspect was a bit more noticeable on draft, as was the hop bitterness. Perfectly smooth, rounded mouthfeel, some traces of butter and metal in the bottled version. Still a fine, everyday drinkable amber lager. Its better than the current Sam's Boston Lager and more reliable than Saranac's Adirondack Amber which goes bad pretty quickly. I was a big fan of both those beers at one time or another, and this is a more than adequate replacement."
"The flavor had a little more of the citrus and hop flavor. I never found the toasted flavor. I actually let this sit for a while and tried it later a little warmer. Still nothing. Still drinkable. Definately not in my drinking rotation, but would bring it to barbqs or tailgait parties with non beer educated beer drinkers."
"This beer had an amber color and a nice rocky head. It had a nice floral hoppy nose but it didn't jump out at me. The flavors were of a normal lager beer. I was expecting a nice toasty flavor which would be rare in a lager, but couldn't detect any toasted notes at all. I just noticed it had a smoother taste than most lagers and the hops had a nice floral finish. I am not a big lager drinker so for me nothing to write home about."
"Beautiful clear copper color on the pour, gigantic head, beige in color, lace large thick sheets to coat the glass. Bazillion tiny bubbles show the quality ""Brewership"" of this beer. Nose is malt, slightly sweet, hit of caramel. Begins malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish has a portly hop presence, masterful carbonation, with a malt dry aftertaste. I don't always enjoy Lagers, but I can certainly respect the craftsmanship that is brewed into a good beer, regardless of style."
"Notes: A run of the mill amber lager, flavours are placid though sometimes plain is good. Its just and easy drinking brew, nothing special."
"White head.  Amber color with a slight hop nose.  Taste is malt based with a little cardboard in the finish (oxidation).  Medium body to the brew.  The mouth is quite smooth.  nothing awesome.. but nothing bad about it either.Better than the other macro choinces that were in the bar!"
"Starts with a clean, sharp, toasty malt/citric hop nose with a hint of buttery ester tossed in. Bitter citrus hop on the tongue, with a toasty malt flavor that comes through to keep the rest of your mouth busy. Overall, the hop outdoes the malt (at least as far as my tastebuds went - this was the fourth of six brews/growlers that day) when cold. But as it warms, a toasted caramel flavor emerges that really makes the ol' tastebuds happy."
"Nice copper color, beige head, tiny bubbles bust through. Head stayed nicely. Toasted barley smell pleasant and noticable. Taste was rich, toastedness came through, but not overbearing. Decent crisp finish, no slimy bitter aftertaste.  Medium bodied, easy going down. Better than average American Lager, IMO. Nicely done, worth giving it a try."
"I expected more out of this, but it still wasnt bad. The toasted flavor was quite evident, and the aftertaste was somewhat bitter. I was still able to finish a few bottles."
"This beer pours a clear light copper with a medium white head.  The same clear, gel-like particles that I just saw suspended in my Blue Point Summer Ale are present in this beer also.  Pretty subdued notes of malt and hops on the nose.  The flame-roasted quality is fairly evident in this brew.  It is nice.  This is a pretty good tasting lager.  Many malts were employed to brew this and they blend together nicely.  Very clean tasting.  A bit of a spritzy mouthfeel, but it isn't bad.  Very little hop presence.  Decent brew here."
"This is a wonderful beer to drink with food.  Its' smooth and crisp taste makes this one of the lightest beers that has taste.  I bought a brown jug of this beer  at a local beer store and it was really fresh and enjoyable."
