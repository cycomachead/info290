Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the sides after a minute of so. The aroma is of some roasted malts and some brown sugar. Little more going on with the taste with some caramel malts, hint of spice, dark fruit and yeast in the mix as well. A very slight 'pine' finish which adds some to this brew. No harsh or bitter aftertaste is noted though. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation. Overall it is a decent brew","BeerWithMike","Oct 12, 2014"

Aroma is a toasty malt, brown sugar and slightly fruity notes and a touch of grassy hops. Taste is weak and dusty (this beer may be old?) with toasted, caramel malt and a weak, waxy hop balance. It's not bad but it is rather unremarkable. Mouthfeel is crisp and fizzy, much like BMC. Overall a so-so beer. Bear in mind I could not find a freshness date on this beer and it was stored at room temperature for lord only knows how long. In an Oklahoma package store.

Generic caramel flavor, though it seems moderately roasty. An herbal earthy hop character is there. Semi wet paper in the middle which might have been bad taps, I don't think so though.

So chug it a little bit right after pouring. The mouthfeel isn't extremely good or bad. It is a little bit thicker than most. It is also more drinkable if you let it warm up.

Mildly malty, watery marzen-esc flavors, some burnt caramel and a nutty quality on the tail end-some sourness as well.

Hops are what's lacking in this brew, even for a Vienna Red (while its hair splitting, I think this qualifies better as a Vienna Lager), there's just nothing much to balance the beer and make it a better sessioner.

The nose is unbalanced, half toasty, nutty, maltiness and the other half is odd dull butter and DMS. The potency is mild so the off-ness can be over looked. The taste is better, the light nutty-toasty malt is the focal point, the hops bitterness is mild but very complementary towards the finish a clean sweetness emerges (an adjunct?). Medium-light body, slick carbonation, watery in spots. The aftertaste is tacky & sweet and it falls apart a little as it warms. This is a serviceable beer, if the price was right it would be worth drinking on occasion. But since Ive never seen this in my area I need to thank ZAP for the sample.","bditty187","Jul 27, 2003"
2.9,-10.8,3,3,3,3,2.5,"I'm not sure why this is listed as a Marzen, other than the label references some lagering. Overall, this is a pretty average amber lager. A bit murky. Flavor profile is flat, with some sweet caramel malt and a touch of apple. Mouthfeel leans slightly to the watery side. Smooth and uneventful.","Brent","May 12, 2003"
3.53,8.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think they may have changed the formula and made this beer a little less bold. Either that, or my taste buds have changed. It is still decent, but now, it is a just above average beer.","Redrover","Mar 26, 2003"
2.29,-29.5,3.5,2,2,3,2.5,"Clear ruddy amber hue. Initially fluffy, off white head recedes into a thin, but dense layer that manages loose lace. The aroma is odd, unbalanced combination of toasted malt, sweet caramel, herbal hops along with a grainy, lighty metallic twang and slight sulfur. Hint of sickly sweet corny DMS adds a macroesque edge. Non descript, sugary toffee hits the palate at first, then is ensued by mildly astringent, grainy 6-row husk and non descript ambient sweetness. As the beer breathes, graininess mellows into a refined white bread like quality. Paltry hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness unhindered and nearly cloying if not for the thin, overly attenuated body. DMS emerges late along with a resurgence of dark caramel malt, lending a cooked, creamed corn on stale toast impression. Finishes faintly herbal, with notes of dry cracker and hominy. Classic Amber is a poor Marzen, and is reminescent of a 25% Rolling Rock, 25% Killians, 50% Spaten Ofest mix. If this is all malt, they sure tried to make it taste like it has large amount of adjuncts. Skip this one.","marc77","Oct 16, 2002"
2.21,-32,2.5,1.5,2.5,3,2,"This beer is not worth the effort. It reminds me a lot of weak, wannabe beers like Killians and Amber Bock. And the smell is bad.","Quaffer","Sep 19, 2002"
3.48,7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Good lookin' beer, like many Point beers, big full head (slight beige color), amber and clear.  Slightly toasted aroma that's on the light side.  Flavor, while pleasant, lacks signficant presence.  Mostly, if not exclusively, malt taste but lacking complexity.  Mouthfeel is full from signficant carbonation, otherwise a little thin.  Finish is short.  Why do they market, on the label, that it's 100% malt?  What does that say about their other beers, and who are they trying to influence?  A rather inexpensive (<$5 in MN) beer, but worth it.","garymuchow","Aug 17, 2002"
3.95,21.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This pours a reddish orange color with a clean, clear look and very little head....the nose is toasty and nutty...not real strong but a nice smell....the bigest knock is probably the body which is on the thin side but it isn't horrible...just not as strong as the rest of this beers characteristics..Taste is very nice, but subdued.....toasted malts...some hints of caramel...and almonds....this is really a pretty decent beer....not in the upper echeleon of Vienna's but a very good session beer and one I wouldn't mind drinking just about anytime...","ZAP","Beers"
3.8,16.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer is a deep clear amber color.  A nice looking beige head tops the beer and coats the glass nicely as I drink.  There's a pretty nice somewhat thick malt aroma.  Seems like a munich and/or vienna style of malt.  This is really a pretty decent amber lager.  Nice malt taste.  But an even nicer dry, hoppy note.  It accentuates the maltiness in this beer very nicely.  Body is about medium.  Very drinkable.","Bighuge","0"
