"Nothing spectacular but pretty decent."
""

"An okay amber lager that lacks any distinctive qualities. The flavor is a let down, lacking some of the malt depth suggested by the aroma. Worth exploring but I'm moving on..."

"O: Overall the flavor (malt and hop character) doesn't show me enough to make this a revist or worthy of a recommendation. Some sour flowery off taste and stale malt leaves much to be desired and not enought to keep you drinking after one."

"O-This is a pretty middle of the road beer. The smell and flavor are on the lighter side of things, which isn't surprising given the low ABV and the style in general. There are more intriguing session beers out there, but this one drinks pretty easy and doesn't offend."

"A very light brew. For a beer so close to the four percent mark, it provides a pleasant quaff. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Wilbur's Total Beverage in Fort Collins."

"Pours out to a limp head but with decent lacing weirdly enough. Color on the light side of style. Aroma is caramel malt, yeast and faint hops. Flavor is doughy, biscuity, buttery and malty with a hint of cheesy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is crunchy and co2 is ok. Overall, kind of weird and not what I was expecting. Of course this sample may be past it's prime."
""
"Pours a golden orange color with a soapy white head. Retention is good, definitely has staying power. Smells like yeast and bread, with a mild tea like hop aroma. In the flavor, mild earthy hop, a bit of lemon, and crackery malt notes. Kind of like an English pale ale, but a lager, as there is a bit of toffee behind the stewed hop flavor. Just a hint of butterscotch. Bitterness is mild but with good balance. Medium bodied with a yeast slickness. Overall, decent brew, not really amber, but good."
""
"Overall: Not much in the way of caramel sweetness but it is balanced."
""

""
"Pours medium dark amber, mostly see through. Touches of foam remains after fast fizzy carbonation. Bready caramel nose jumps out of the glass. Taste is a sweet caramel. Sweetness hangs around. Pretty good amber."

"A very one dimensional amber, drinkable with no big flaws, but not something I would seek out. Perfect for the biscuit lover."
""
"This beer went down nicely and when it was done could have had another.maybe the beautiful snowy rocky mountains surroundings and high altitude make the beer better."

"A bit weak, the initial fizz fades, it becomes watery, but the taste lingers through the finish."
""
""
"Hrmm. Quite average. I think this is Fort Collins answer to it's neighbors best-seller, but there is a reason fat tire sells better than this and it's not just marketing or volume."

"Conclusion: This is an alright version of this style of beer. It tastes good and only has slightly detectable flaws. It reminds me of Boston Lager in style, but doesn't have the depth of malt flavors achieved in said beer. It does however have a better mouthfeel, with more texture."

"Caramel and toasted malts with some cream soda sweetness. Light floral hopping with honey sweetness on the finish."
""
"It seems that more caramel malts and less Munich or Vienna malt flavor and feel leaves me wanting more elegance and firmness; and then with a clean malty-dry closure that would have helped this beer compete with Negra Modelo and Eliot Ness perhaps."
"Nice, drinkable beer."
"Pours a very clear amber color with a nice white head that films rather quickly. The smell reminds me of Dial soap. Uh-oh. Maybe some fruits in the back though malt does shine through. Malty taste with more malt on the swallow. Slight caramel on the swallow with some peppery aspects. Overall this beer did not impress too much. Low alcohol is nice for a change but a little more character and heartiness would have been nice."
"Overall, this is a pretty average beer. But it's at least drinkable and thirst quenching,"
"Pours a clear light copper orange with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to an oily film. Random streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of light malt and citrus aromas. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, citrus zest, and a slight soapy flavor. Little hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good amber lager but nothing exciting going on here."
"Overall a nicely balanced, sessionable and easy drinking amber ale."
"Final thought - Not bad."
"O- Nothing special, quite bland when there are so many good amber ales out there"
"Overall: Your basic amber lager. Nothing at all special about this beer"
"O: OK, not the best first impression, but I was starting with the lightest in the pack. Hopefully things will go up from here. No off flavours, fairly clean, just nothing interesting."
"I grabbed this one randomly because Ft Collins has a decent lineup. It's a nice copper color with low carbonation making for head that disappeared in seconds to make a horseshoe-shaped cap. The aroma was light with a pleasing amount of hops. The taste is VERY good for a lager. It has a good crispness and I actually enjoy the taste, unlike many lagers I've tried. This is one I could have several of. It's great for the style and, well, just nice."
"We tried this one with friends Saturday afternoon up at the brewery in Fort Collins. Pours a clean amber color with a smallish off-white head. Aromas of caramel, toasted grains and sweet malt. On the palate, light bodied and crisp, with flavors of biscuit, caramel and earthy hops."
"The beer pours out as a decent looking amber color with a nice creamy looking head. The smell was of biscuit malts and some hops in there. The taste has a light citrusy flavor mixed with a caramel aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent found it to be very drinkable. Overall I'd say give it a try."
"Nice body with lively carbonation. Not overly complex but it shouldn't be. Very food friendly, light toffee, cereal, bread, with a good amount of noble hops in the middle and finish. Lively floral flavors on the end and a bit earthy throughout."
"Better than I expected. I've been relatively underwhelmed by this brewery, and this isn't a style I often go for- a bit bland for me- but I picked this up on a singles rack in one of my local stores, and I have to say I was fairly pleasantly surprised. Pours a nice amber with a fairly thin head that leaves some sloppy lacing. Nice bready smell with a bit of earthy bitterness and some late tropical fruit notes. Crisp and somewhat substantial at the same time in the mouth, with more of that breadiness, light sweetness, anmd fairly firm earthy hops. There is a bit of thinnessin the finish and it could use some more length, but some spicy hops at the end redeem it. Very enjoyable on a hot day, but with enough body and character to keep me somewhat interested, and the nice spicy hop bite went well with some Dubliner cheese and some wheat crackers."
"overall - if the flavor is not there why bother - i will never buy this beer again - yet another fort collins beer that fails"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability is awesome. This amber has such a nice balance and a really dtrong taste. There is so much going on in the taste, but everything balances well enough that I could drink this beer for a very long time."
"The first of my sample pack from the Gettysburg Beer Mart on York Rd. (Always fun to see what you can get in PA that you can't find locally.) Nice orange color in the glass with decent tan foam that laced a bit going down. Spritzy carbonation and a somewhat fresh (bright?) scent in the nose--almost a fruity hops. Taste was very slightly sweet malt with a decidedly ""Colorado"" style (thanks, N, for the use of that term--it fits) hops profile that is both recognizable and very pleasant. Refreshing, slight bitter aftertaste (a good thing) and downright good to drink. Can't wait to try the rest of the pack."
"Drinkability: A balanced, easily drinkable beer with an approachability beyond reproach."
"Finishes dry. Enjoyed this amber, definitely better than average."
"Good, clean, flavourful drink with modest amber malts and gentle, earthy hops on the finish. Very easy to drink and very subtle beer. Mouthfeel is smooth will moderate carbonation. Well crafted lager that seems it would pair well with a multitude of cuisine and highly drinkable, too. Well done."
"D - Well this would be my favorite amber lager second would be flying dogs, and third would be vinyl by magic hat. Very balanced and drinkable. My first beer wow of the pack."
"Appears a pale copper amber hue with a bright white head, nice scattered bands of lacing form retention is really nice. Aroma is pretty tame here subtle toasted malts bring out mild caramel and biscuit tones. A light herbal hop background going on this is a pre pro amber lage. Flavor is light as well with nice cereal grains more biscuit, caramel malts flowing with a touch of herbal hops for balance tame and delicate well brewed amber lager. A nice nutty finish in there as well. Mouthfeel is light body carried well by natural carbonation, straight forward crisp amber lager. Drinkability is nice I could see this being a nice crossover brew has more flavor without overpowering any senses."
"D: This is a nice little beer. It has good subtlety and just enough flavor going on to keep me interested. The lightness makes it easy to drink multiples."
"Certainly drinkable, but I wish Ft. Collins would list the ABV and bottle date on their bottles."
"D- Wonderfully sessionable, this is a treat of a beer. I didn't expect such great malt sweetness, I could drink a lot of these."
"D - This is a great sessionable beer. I will definitely get another pint of this one."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but not for the aroma. Not complex, b ut flavorful and fairly balanced."
"Reminds me a little of a less complex Elliot Ness."
"I don't know what to say. It's almost like beer plagerism. Did they actually think this was unique? I give this a straight ""average"" score because it's all been done before."
"M/D: light bubbly feel with a slight dryness in the mouth. The drinkability is decent when you hold your breath"
"Note #2: Bitterbill, I swear I didn't read your review before I wrote mine, looks like we are on EXACTLY the same page on this beer."
"Drinkability? It was very easy drinking and quite tasty. I think it's a good addition to the lineup of Ft Collins Brewing."
