"It was an ok tasting beer. I bet it would be better paired with a good meal"
""
"Pairs nicely with an Oliva series O cigar."
"I read the reviews of this beer. While I am not an experienced beer drinker, all I could taste and smell was cloves. It was awful."
""
"Nose of malt, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, faint fruitiness. Taste caramel, breadyness, malt, slight spice, & pine. Ok!"
""
"Overall not a bad Amber lager. Goes down easy and is refreshing"
"Presently surprised, this is a very tasty brew! Good job Flying Dog!"
"Overall:  This is an outstanding amber lager!  Malty, sweet and creamy!  Delicious!  This is going to be a regular beer in my fridge!"

"great amber lager/ale. here in the North-East, we cannot get Fat Tire so, this is a nice alternative."

"Deep amber/copper color with a huge bubbly off white head that slowly recedes. The aroma is heavy on the caramel malt with hints of toffee and light chocolate. Light earthy hop aroma barely. The flavor is rich caramel maltiness with a touch of burnt sugar. Earthy spicy hop flavor with a light amount of bitterness. Solid darker lager brew."

"Overall - This beer is simple but still extremely enjoyable.  I like it very much, can't wait for another one."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 11/26/2013. Pours crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malts, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber lager style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I love Flying Dog brewing company and am sad to see it leave Connecticut but hope it comes back soon. The appearance was a nice dark yellow almost orange with a light head. The smell is full of malt and hops, very effervescent. The taste is sweet in the beginning with the malt and then the hops give a bright finish. Hope to have one again soon."

"A relatively plain lager. Nice, amber color. Smell is pretty unappealing. Taste is plain, comparable to more main-stream lagers such as Yeungling or Sam Adams. Flying Dog is an excellent brewery, specifically in regards to ale, but this lager falls relatively short of what I've come to expect."

"Overall, a solid example of the style. Far from an intense beer, but more flavorful than your typical amber lager."
""

""
""
""
""
"Looking for a good Amber Ale? This could be your beer!"
"O: A pretty good Amber Lager. Not too crazy with the flavors but a solid brew from Flying Dog."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"Flying dog is a brewery which tends to produce consistently excellent beers, I still have many more beers in the lineup to try but in the past they've very rarely disappointed me. Old scratch is a medium to dark caramel color. It smells sweet and taste accordingly. It is noticeably more hopped than your average amber lager keeping that sweetness in check. The beer is crisp and perfectly carbonated. The finish is short and hoppy. Easy drinking and delicious check it out."
""
"O - fine but not outstanding."
""
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice off white head developed, though retention and lacing were mild. Appearance was a nice clear to copper color with a mild aroma with light notes of malt and toffee. Tasted of caramel and toffee, sweet with a medium to light mouth feel. Aftertast was sweet."
"Overall, nothing mindblowing but a tasty drinkable lager."
""
""
""

"O - bought the beer to use to poach some salmon, which turned out great, but not impressed with the drinkability"
""
""
""
"O - Not something that stands out and not an example of this style that made me feel it stacks up well to it's competition. There's just not much that sticks out about it. It is a very easy drinker and something that would be enjoyable on a hot summer day and would be a good choice for company that's maybe not big into micros."

"Amber color. Not picking up much of an odor. Taste is okay. Not much complexity. Smooth at first, good initial flavor but has no aftertaste. I'd like for it to have a little more depth as far as taste is concerned. It tastes watered down. Overall it's an okay beer. Better than domestics but not outstanding."

"Pours a true amber color. Almost no nose and no head. While it didn’t boast of anything up front I did notice a little floral hops character, some bitterness. No lacing. Light carbonation. The body of this beer was weak and unbalanced. It had a flat, fruity sweet quality that really detracted form the essence of the malt."

"Overall - Haven't had a lager for awhile but this is a good brew. I would recommend. I imagine this would go very well with food. But it is highly drinkable on it's own."
"""Food friendly"" and thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I suppose if you were in the mood for a lager, this is not a bad option. Both the taste and smell is subtle, but it mixes well in the final swallow. As my hand warmed the glass, it did seem to make the whole experience a bit more enjoyable. A decent drink, but I probably wouldn't get it again."
""
""
"Yum! The first thing I noticed about this beer was it's great smell! It has a really refreshing taste without being totally seltzer-y. Awesome mouthfeel and aftertaste. A great beer to accompany a meal (I'm having some berries, chocolate and almonds with mine, and it complements them well). It was hard to resist chugging!"

"overall- maybe amber lagers are just not my thing, i would do a black lager or a lager. If i wanted ""Amber"" I would just have a brown ale. That being said I could see myself having a few of these in an airport bar. at 5.5 abv they would get the job done for a short flight. I could also see them mixing well with dry snack mixes and and potato chips."

"O: About average amber lager. Looks really nice though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A slightly sweet taste with a nicely roasted malt flavor. A beer that is worth putting in the rotation. Light on the lager scale."
"Overall –A nice blend of roast, sweet and hop make this beer a good easy drinker with a nice smooth flavor and taste transitions. Rather tasty."
"Overall it is a pretty good amber. It is not one of the top ones, but has it's place in the middle. Drinkable and solid."

"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall: A poorly constructed amber lager. Flying Dog has always been hit-and-miss with me and this is definitely a miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly not your average fizzy yellow lager. Has good flavor for a lager and plenty of malts to give some sweetness. Worth a try if you're into lagers"
""
""
"Overall, this is an extremely drinkable beer with no real aftertaste. The flavors are tasty."
""
"O- As far as amber lagers go, this one ranks up there with the best of 'em."
""
""
"This is one of those offering that is inoffensive. It's very drinkable and enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. It pours a deep copper with not much head and poor retention of that, and no observable lacing. Smell is bread, malt, citrus, and roasted nuts. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Taste is very mild with the expected sweetness up front followed by a mild bitter on the finish. The bottle says that the IBU rating is 19.5. It is not all that bitter, but it seems like a little more than that. Still an enjoyable beer, one that would make an excellent session beer."

"D - A simple, quaff-able lager with a light malty presence to it. Certainly not my ideal beer, but this wasn't half bad."
"A lager with some flavor, and oh so easy to drink more than one. Not sure if I would consider it a shining example of a CA Common."
""
""
"O: Never had a steam beer, but have had a couple Flying Dog brews in the past and they are the new brew on the block. Nothing special stands out to me about this brew, but hopefully some others will. Either way, its a different style and worth a try for anyone who hasnt had a steam beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper in color. Nose has nice malty and bready notes.  The flavor profile follows the nose pretty much.  The caramel malt is apparent and the body is fairly hearty for the style."
""
"O-good beer for the price got it in the mix pack. personaly would not buy it because im not a lager fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great lager with some nice qualities. I can’t quite find the California Common characteristics. In my opinion I would have to consider this more of a Vienna Lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: just had it for first time but pleasantly surprised. Also bottles for $2.50 were a sweet deal. Would definitely have again/recommend it."
"Overall - I'm not big into steam beers, but this one is pretty good. I like it much better than Anchor Steam, which most would consider the benchmark for steams."

"overall: on par with what you would expect with a premium lager, very casually drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very middle-of-the-road amber lager. I would not have guessed this is a steam beer, but caramel malts can mask a lot of subtlety."
""
""
"Overall: This is a good lager, it proves that even a rather basic lager does not mean to be very light and tasteless. The Old Scratch has robust elements in all aspects and it's a serious beer."
""
"Light amber with a nice full and fluffy white head that forms and sticks around. Pears, bread, and yeast in the nose. Malty, nice bitterness with a good piney hop flavor going on. Bready and dry on the palate. Adequate carbonation with a medium body. Refreshing and crisp."
""
""
" This is a good example flavor wise, it has some lager-like traits with mild sweetness and subtle caramel tinges with a nice hint of hops with some yeast fruitiness in the background. It ends mostly dry with a little spice and the carbonation pushes some of the steam-like qualities forward. I enjoyed the drinkability of this and would purchase it again."
"It's alright, but there's no ""wow"" factor to it."
"This beer is light bodied, and a little on the sweet side, even with the good spice notes involved and the bitterness at the end. It coats most of your mouth and leaves you dry, ready and waiting for the next sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems bold at first but quickly mellows out in the mouth and leaves only the slightest of nut brown memories. It's an interesting remix of some classic themes. But not one I'm likely to enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The caramel/sugar/syrupy quality dominates the flavor, nose, and mouthfeel. I will probably avoid in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a bold, clear copper color with a thin head and some fine lacing. It's aroma is of caramel apples, spices, and a hint of maple. The flavor is sweet malt followed through by ginger and pretzels. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager is a good beer, a good example of the style. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"A decent lager, but nothing out of the ordinary. Seems to me the Flying Dog brews were better when brewed in Colorado. Nevertheless, these East Coast versions are okay, just more run-of-the-mill than anything else."

"Nice. Sessionable. Very good with food."

"Now I see I am 45% of a deviation from the mean which is really a lot. I wonder if I didn't get a bad bottle or so. I have the beer sitting right next to me so it is what it is I suppose."

"O- Not to much flavor but with small bitter taste at the end. This was tasted at a slightly chilled temperature. Might be better at a colder temp."
""
"Overall: Not terribly impressed by this one. Too thin and lacking in flavor to make this beer one to look forward to."
""
"It's good to have a nice lager to turn to every now and then, what with all the DIPA's and Russian Imperial Stouts aged in oak barrels with a hint of smoked salmon and chili peppers running around these days. I enjoy this beer."
"Overall I wasn't very impressed with this brew. Will need to try again, maybe on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is likewise malty and toasty, even sweet. Comparable to Fat Tire but a mite sweeter (and possibly more oxidized, as I think this bottle may have been past it's prime - no freshness dating). Overall, fair at best."
""
""
"Overall a really nice, easy drinking session lager. Would make a good go-to beer to have on hand in the fridge."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nice brew, easy drinking."
"Overall - This is a beautiful looking beer. Its almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to drink. The smell was nothing too exciting, very light on the nose. It doesn't smell bad, i just wish it was deeper. Taste is great. Its all about that apricot aftertaste that leaves you feeling very mellow. I didn't like the syrup sensation I got in the back of my throat after a few sips and the carbonation was noting to shake a stick at. Overall, This is a good brew. I would get again."

"Overall Drinkability - Not a bad beer, but doesn't offer anything to get me to come back for more. Neither a session nor a tasting beer."
"It's clean enough, and drinkable in a bland and fatalistic way. It doesn't inspire you to drink better beer, unfortunately—it makes you just resigned to the fact that this is what beer is going to be. It's kind of depressing."
"Poured a 2"" off-white head. Clear dark amber color, rather pretty. Smells richly of malt but I don't really pick anything else up. Taste also is rich malt, didn't change much as it warmed up, and was pretty light and clean. I'd say this sample is yummy, just not very complex."
"I really liked this beer, which was light to medium bodied and very drinkable. Good job!"
"D - this is my first experience with the style, so I can't compare it to others. It's a decent beer, but could be balanced much better."
"O-Similar to how I remembered it. Nothing much out of the ordinary here."
"Overall, I thought this beer was OK but could also use some bittering. It lacks the dry woodiness that makes Anchor Steam Beer highly drinkable."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and goes down rather smoothly."
"Written as I tasted."
"O: great appearance and better than average smell build up expectations; taste and mouthfeel are a huge let down; could definitely drink a few of these, sense it has the drinkability of water; I've had this before, and really liked it; perhaps this was just a bad bottle?"
"I doubt I'll buy this again. Not really my style of cup of beer."
"Overall - One of the better beers I've had from this brewer. It's not really memorable, but it's definitely decent enough to warrant trying at least once."
"This is a very solid amber lager/steam beer. I enjoy the flavors and the mouthfeel. Very drinkable and good."
"Overall this beer was okay. not as bad as tire bite but definitely not a star in the lineup."
"Overall: Nice beer. Pretty refreshing, nice taste profile."
"O - Not too impressed with this beer. Has a very thin watery taste to it. Not much in the way of flavor."
"Aroma is of caramel malt, and some bready notes. Medium, smooth body. Caramel malt is balanced by earthy, peppery hops on the palate. Long, peppery, dry finish. Not a bad brew."
"The feel is pretty decent. Light feel to it with soft carbonation. Overall not bad just nothing special here. Easily approachable."
"Pours a medium amber color with only a thin sand-colored head despite a vigorous pour. The aroma is light and malty, with a mild berry-like fruitiness and a bit of graininess. The flavor is likewise lightly sweet, with a thin caramel character and a dry breadiness, and maybe some light lemony hops creeping into the finish. Any deeper flavor complexity is hard to identify because of the fine yet assertive, prickly carbonation that feels a bit harsh. Overall, although there's nothing necessarily wrong with the flavor, I'm just not impressed."
"Dr: Fairly drinkable excepting the lackluster quality. Overpriced as part of the sampler pack. I won't have it again."
"Thanks to Sully for getting this to me. Nice amber appearance as I pured into my Tusker pilsener glass. Small amount of head but some nice beige lacing on the glass. Smells malty and sweet at first. Taste is very complex for a lager. Some maltiness and maple syrup qualities, slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and light to medium bodied. Overall a nice amber lager not too far off from the anchor steam but a tad sweeter and maltier!"
"Overall, a decent amber lager with good flavors, but with a few shortcomings that prevent it from getting above-average marks."
"I could drink many of these and I would say that 5.5% is higher than I would think this beer is. Not an exciting beer, but not a bad one."
"D/O: This amber-whatever features little to recommend it, while being saddled with excessive acidity. Although it is not outright undrinkable, this beer is utterly forgettable and probably best relegated to cooking applications."
"Overall: Nice beer, bit underrated for the style"
"Grenadine nose that becomes a bit of time with the caramel light. Body still quite heavy and with a special flavor, perhaps a little too strong, perhaps too much mixing of tastes and making a grave mistake Association. One finds, loose, slightly roasted malt but also fruity and a little alcohol. Many flavors but a bit too stodgy for a californian common."
"Overall: Not a bad effort from Flying Dog; I enjoy most amber ales and lagers, so this was a nice addition. Much maltier and sweeter than I'm used to, but good overall, and very relaxing. A go-to for the autumn season? Maybe."
"Final Notes: Drink this one cold to avoid the grainy taste. A simple lager, nothing special, but it's great for when you want a beer that's not overbearing and that you can drink a lot of easily. Good introduction to better beer."
"D - This has decent drinkability. It goes down pretty easy, but the flavor isn't all that great. Overall, It is a decent beer, and it isn't too bad to have on a hot summer day. I thought it was alright, but I probably wouldnt buy it again."
"O - Pretty middle of the road amber lager. I felt like it was generic and somewhat one-note. I would certainly drink it again, but I would never go out of my way to get it."
"Overall - A very well crafted lager with complex, pronounced flavors and aggression on the finish. Recommended for more experienced craft drinkers as like I mentioned before, I know I tried this years ago (when I was a less experience beer drinker/taster) and it tasted bitter and rough to me. For the BA's I recommend this."
"Overall not impressed but a very drinkable Cali common brew."
"Overall, pretty much an average amber. Not terrible. Nothing to make it stand out from a crowd though. I probably would pass on another round of this one in favor of something more flavorful."
"D- It's an amber, not the greatest, but pretty good. I'd drink more, but I'm not going to seek it out."
"Overall: A decent amber. A mediocre amber. An amber."
"O: Not the worst beer out there, but for my money I could get better Amber Lagers."
"Mouthfeel was pretty good. Very easy to drink but the flavors didn't leave me wanting to drink more than one or two."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint at 50 degrees. Pours a hazy burnt red with a bubbly band around the shoulders and a soapy slick across the surface. Band eventually settles into a tight circle with no other foam across the surface - no lacing on this one. Nose is quite malty with hints of caramel/toffee and figs or prunes. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a faint earthy/spicy character that cuts across the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. All and all, a pretty drinkable brew with more character than I anticipated. Well worth a try."
"I just want to point out, this beer is very true to it's style. It's always good to have them, they give you a point of reference and reverence! It's got a pleasant taste throughout, and it's got a great citrus quality to it. Setting at 19.5 IBU, combined with hints of caramel and citrus, is like a bunch of angry little leprechauns bouncing on see saws on your palate! A must have in the cooler this summer for sure!"
"O: I wouldn't buy this when I make a better amber ale than this. Boring beer."
"D- This is a solid beer, its nothing extraordinary but something you can happily drink without any fuss. If I had to compare it I would say it is similar levels of sweetness and hops to Sam Adams with the same overall drinkability."
"Finish: Stickiness on the lips"
"Not bad, not great."
"Translucent copper body. Had to coax out the head. Smells grainy and watery with a little butteriness in the backgroud. Tastes grainy as well. Lightly hopped, just enough to get you to notice. A little fruity as it warms. Not bad, not gonna look for it in the bar or at the store. A ""treading water"" beer."
"Even with all that being said it's still not that bad a beer, but I can't rate it that high since it just doesn't feel that great and has some issues."
"I have been away from Flying Dog for too long, and I forgot that they are one of the gateways that got me into the craft beer world."
"Nice and soothing, an easily accessible amber."
"O: Great beer for the style. It's not my favorite kind, but this beer turns me back to lagers."
"Really surprised with how flavorful this beer was. Could see some problems with people thinking it was slightly too weak as it is initially, but finishes with lots of taste so a very good amber lager IMO."
"The beer was a pretty stand looking Amber Lager. The pour was pretty good, it had a nice looking head on it that had a little yellowish color too it. The look of the beer is pretty nice, lots of bubbles coming up from the glass and adding to the head. The smell of the beer is of hops and malts, lightly roasted aroma as well. The mouthfeel is on the heavier which is pretty nice for the style. I'm happy that it wasn't overly watered down. This is a good drinking beer, it can be enjoyed by many and the drinkability is good here."
"O- Obviously not the most sought after style, but I knew I would be at the bar awhile and I had the server keep these coming. It was cheap and drinkable. I would definitely revisit this for a decent price. Also, I would like to note that my girlfriend very much enjoyed this beer; which says a lot..."
"D - Makes a decent winter session beer"
"Cheers!"
"Good on its own, better paired with sweeter food."
"this is an easy drinker for almost any beer drinker, craft or BMC. although this goes down with very little effort, lagers like this really aint my thing, i would turn this down for pretty much any ale. worth a spot in the variety pack, but i would never really buy this on its own."
"D - Overall this is a pretty good brew. It goes down smooth and has enough flavor to keep you interested. It isn't amazing, but it's worth drinking."
"The carbonation is just too high, takes away any level of flavor this beer did have."
"Old Scratch is not bad [for a lager] almost close to an Ale. One of the better Amber Lagers I have had to date."
"This lager is very drinkable, as are most, leaving no strange bite or mouth puckering aftertaste. This is a solid lager that is now on my list of respectable beers."
"Overall, it is a good beer that has a very light feel to it but does not really stand out significantly from any other amber lagers."
"I thought this was a solid amber, it's balanced between sweet and bitter."
"A soft sweet smell, a little bit of liqueur, syrup and nut. The rather small creamy beige head disappeared rather fast. The body is orange-red. In the beginning the taste is light soft, the finish is more bitter. The duration is normal. The body is medium strong, dry and creamy with normal carbonation. A nice beer."
"Drinkability - Friendly but not as good as other Ambers. Its nothing special but its not off-putting either."
"D -- Fairly good. Worth trying, but not running to the store for more."
"Drinkability - very interesting brew with a very morphic type of taste. Very cool!"
"A pretty desent beer. I just think they could bring up the flavor a little bit."
"D: A nice drinkable beer, although it's pretty neutral - not a lot of jazz."
"This was a solid red lager. Poured a reddish amber with big head that receded rather quickly. Smelled of oily hops and some lightly toasted malt. Tasted of hops, but it was understated. Buttery caramel came into play later. Mouthfeel was pleasant and I believe that this is a highly drinkable amber lager."
"Pretty decent mouth feel. Nice carbonation and not watery. I'd say it's somewhere between light and medium on the palate. It's pretty drinkable too. Overall, a really nice lager. It surprised me; I haven't had a lager since summer. The malts reminded me of an ale. The mouth feel is actually better than some ales I've had."
"I've had this beer a few times in the last couple months and I really like it. It's a really good tasting amber beer. Flying dog has some really nice label designs and names for their beer and this one is no different. I'll definitely be adding this to my inventory when I see it in the store."
"This was a vey easy beer to drink, the flavor was good and well balanced, I wouldn't mind having this again."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are basically normal for the lager style. Just a good, drinkable lager. Won't amaze, but it's still a welcome part of the Flying Dog mix packs."
"D- After the smell I was a little worried but this one came together nicely. A good session beer and one I wouldn't mind having again."
"Has a bit of a winter warmer like quality to it, a little bit of wood and heat with red feel. Can't really get much to differentiate the lager style of this, tastes like a red ale through and through, barely a hop presence to it. But for a mellow ride, this stuff gets the trick done, good times, that March Madness."
"Notes: This is the best beer I have had yet from flying dog. But it is far from being the best amber I have ever had."
"This is a decent beer. Not a taste that I am used to in an amber lager. I like the difference. I could see drinking a few of these in one sitting."
"Nothing significant. Taste is ok and there is no complexity, but it's not hard to drink. Not a bad beer, but nothing stands out as more than average."
"Not one of Flying Dog's more memorable beers but worth a try."
" Overall this is a pretty decent beer. The taste was lacking for me. That could come from the fact that my favorite beers are porters and stouts. That being said it is definitely a beer that I would hit the lake with in the summer. I would not buy it by itself in a 6-pack, but would by the Flying Dog Pack again for sure. Great beer Flying Dog!"
"Quite smooth with a good body and light effervescence. Aftertaste is a bit hoppier and slightly dry. Reminiscent of a pale ale. Stylistically off but a good brew nonetheless."
"Decent brew, but not very tasty. Maaybe it's an old bottle so it's not too impressive."
"The mouthfeel was fine, but I believe most ambers are. It was very drinkable as I finished off a 6 pack during just the first game on Sunday."
"This beer pours a deep copper almost amber color, and had somewhat of an off white head to it. The aroma smells rich in caramel malts, almost a toasty smell too. The taste is sweet with the taste of caramel malts. There is also a hint of spicy noble hops as well. The mouthfeel is medium light and I would consider this drinkable."
"I could have a few of these no problem. It seems pretty easy to drink. A little higher ABV than normal with a 5.5%, so you could have a few until you get a buzz."
"Drink- Easily drinkable. I could definite session beer. i could down more than a few of these."
"Nice color, lacing head. Not much smell at all, if any. Smooth, lightly toasted malt flavor, nothing extraordinary. Decent mouthfeel. Smooth, good carbonation, slightly bitter finish. Good session beer. Feel like I could drink a lot of these. Quaffable."
"Old Scratch pours a deep reddish-brown in color with a think light khaki head. The sweet malty nose lends itself to aromas of caramel, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is medium in body. Unlike the nose, the flavor is not sweet at all. An amber lager that does not do much to make a tremendous overall flavor impression, yet at the same time does not offend. Light on the malt and flavor in general. There's a little touch of alcohol in the finish. This isn't a beer to ponder really, it's just an average drinker."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is caramel and toffee with some piney hops and grain notes. The flavor is a mix of toffee, caramel and tea as well as some grassy and citrus notes from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"d- very drinkable beer, i could put down a lot of these at once, nice malty brew"
"D - refreshing, this aids drinkability"
"Amber color, light brown with a shade of red. The head retention was there at a 1/4"" but quickly went away after a few seconds. It is very clear and lightly carbonated. Smells sweet and roasty. Sharp on the tongue but smooth going down, sits on the stomach well. Seems more carbonated drinking it than it appears in the glass. Mild, soft light taste with a clean clear aftertaste. Watery, smooth and a little flat. Overall a good clean beer, nothing dirty about it."
"Drinkability - I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I like it. Easy drinking. Looks great in the glass and had an above average smell, taste and mouthfeel. Great Fall session brew. I hope I can pick this up again sometime. I was expecting an average brew, but to me, this is a few steps above average."
"D: Not an overpowering beer. Just a nice easy drinker. Good for a few."
"Drinkability- This beer has a great, amber look that gives credit to the ""amber lager"" description. Though it does not drive one's sense of smell wild, it's balanced taste has a mild bite, with smooth, sweet after tones that will tickle your tongue. The taste is complimented by a strong carbonation as the beer gently washes around your mouth without filling it with foam."
"d: Really well balanced all around. All of the pieces fit together nicely and make a smooth, flavorful beer that is very nice to drink."
"I finally found one! I found a Flying Dog I like! Thank God, I was beginning to lose hope from the last two I tried....but on a serious note, this is, overall, a good lager. I recommend it if you prefer lagers, but be wary that it isnt up to caliber to the best of the best lagers. Its a safe choice and I enjoy it. I will most likely buy this again."
"d-Very drinkable. I may not seek this out should I be looking for something new. It was good but not overwhelmly good."
"Overall this a pretty mediocre amber, not too bad, but not too good either."
"D. Given its lack of flavours, this is one I would have as an 'appetizer' so to speak. Such a shame all the different aromaas are not present on the palate."
" ~ For an Amber Lager this is a bit on the coarse side. It has a nice robustness to it in the taste but it never really gets anywhere."
"D - It's a great amber beer and well worth it"
"Drinkability is okay. I would prefer more of a hop balance in this one. It gets a little heavy which prevents it from being the solid session beer the style probably dictates."
"d - Not a very enjoyable beer. Wasn't a big fan of the metallic smell and taste, which was odd. I wouldn't order it again."
"very drinkable, however for the price range i'd rather have a good local brew..."
"Taste is nice toasted grain, lightly caramelised bread crust, slight fruity wine hint, with herbal leaves and wood, mineral, citrus pulp hint and slightly peppery sharp bitterness. Light sweetness balanced by light sweetness, the latter just dominating at the crisp finish. All linger nicely in the aftertaste. Overall, this is really good and very drinkable."
"D - a very good session beer, not quite a standalone, but great to have in conjunction with a handful of like beers"
"D: Boy I was thirsty, and boy was this ever satisfying. And with a good abv, its a sessioner. Honestly I'd compare this favourably with a Great Lakes Elliot Ness Amber Lager. As the french say, Bonne Merde!"
"(D) fairly drinkable, though, at the price point i can think of several other beers i'd rather session."
"There's a (not hop) bitterness going on that coats the mouth in an unpleasant way. Very carbonated, smooth, and drinkable if you like this sort of thing. Honestly I'm depressed I have a second bottle awaiting me in the fridge."
"Overall, to me, this beer was reminiscent to Yeungling. A favorite of mine, but I was looking for something different."
"D: A strong start to the 12 pack, this lager is a pleasant sipping beer with a solid flavor profile."
"I picked this up by accident and did not expect it to be good at all. A very drinkable beer."
"D- Pretty damn good once you get past that wet burlap sack aroma"
"Very nice dark amber color around 17 on SRM. Better than average head with great lace on the side of the glass. Sweet hop smell with a touch of caramel. Sits well in my mouth, nice firm flavor, yet not but a touch bitter. Label shows IBU of 19.5. This bottle closer to 14 to 15. Very little aftertaste except a semi sweet faint hop flavor. Taste better as it warms. Nice amount of buzz factor, makes my nostrils flare. Would buy this one to share with others. Will sample this one again (& again), for sure!"
"Overall kind of disappointing, I was expecting more but it was very simple. Not unpleasant, but entirely underwhelming."
"Taste is caramel malt with a hint of nuttiness and perhaps a little bit of hop bitterness, although it is hard to tell. The beer tastes watery and weak, with the tastes being less than expected from the style and the color of the beer. It is a struggle to find words to describe the flavors as they are hard to find - there isn't much difference in taste up front and throughout each sip, and it doesn't leave much - quite smooth and very drinkable, but there isn't much to savor so I didn't enjoy it much."
"D: the brew drank quite well and was pretty good paired with some breaded shrimps"
"As the name suggests, this beer pours a medium amber with some nice burnt orange tones. It has a pretty average looking cream head that fades quickly but leaves pretty good lacing. The aroma is bready, grainy, grassy and slightly toasty with a hint of brown sugar. Flavors include deep bready malt, grain, dry grass, toffee and a bit of brown sugar sweetness. All the flavors are very clean, but seem a bit uninspiring. The mouthfeel is light to medium and has a certain chewy quality to it. Ample carbonation bounces around on my tongue before I swallow and partake of a long, slightly stinging finish that fades to a somewhat dry and hoppy aftertaste. This beer has decent drinkability, but I am not sure I would really seek out another glass."
"Drinkability is so-so. Nothing here makes me want this one in a sixer. it's pretty inoffensive tho and might be good to wean BMC drinkers into enjoying better beers."
"Pours a nice amber color with a frothy head and large bubbles, kinda sponge-like. It has nice carbonation and a nice toffy flavor and smell to it. Has a nice stronger-than-medium body that lingers for some time. I would defiantly buy this beer again, as the experience of drinking this was quite nice. Plus, I have a Flying Dog Old Scratch glass to drink it from."
"When I first poured this one it had a nice color with a decent head. It has the aroma of a standard Amber. The taste was less than I was hoping for with a bitter and almost unpleasant finish. I do not feel that this beer is worthy of the flying dog title and has a great deal of room for improvement in taste."
"Drinkable, decent but wouldn't go out of my way to get again."
"M/D: Moderate body, soft carbonation. no alcohol apparent. Good drinkable amber ale, nothing extraordinary, but glad I tried it."
"Drinkability is average, I could split a 6-pack with a friend."
"Served in a Sam Adams Pint glass. About 2 inches of thick foamy head. The taste was very refreshing on a hot day. Some mildly hoppy flavor and well balanced sweet malts. Mouthfeel is smooth, very drinkable. It was quite easy to enjoy 2 or more of these."
"A thick cloudy head that got me a little amped up, but nothing much after that. Not much smell, not much taste, what was I here for?? Basic, basic, basic. Not bad, but basic. All and all it was a drinkable brew, but I asked myself why I would ever come back to it. Didn't strike me as an American amber either. Always weird when I have beers like this. Not much to say other than give it a try, you might like."
"D - Solidly built and drinkable, but nothing amazing. I got it in a mixed 12 pack, am happy I tried it, won't necessarily go back and get a sixer."
"Overall, a decent brew, just kinda flawed. Nothing you'd spit out, but nothing you'd call all of your friends about either. Solid and drinkable."
"Drinkability: An average amber. Drinkable enough that if I bought a six I would not be disappointed, but there is no need to rush out and get this again. The fruit/tea combo does not work for me."
"D- I guess its drinkable...I'm getting a waterlike texture from it at points, which I guess you could drink. Tastes more like a cider like a Woodchuck to be personally...would not buy again."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"An excellent satisfying and highly drinkable beer from a brewery that is rapidly moving up in my regard. Recommended!"
"Medium carbonation and body, tending just towards the heavier side. Goes down smoothly enough, but I probably wouldn't drink more than 2 of these in a sitting."
"The feel of this beer is smooth and light. A good medium body to this beer is does go down well and leaves a slight weight to it as it clears the pallet."
"Drinkabillity: Good for a hot summer day but a bit heavy for me so I would have to really want more than one if I was going to have 2 or more."
"This brew pours a deep amber,orange hue with nice carbonation that leaves a two finger head and sticky lacing here and there,it has aromas of caramel,toffee malts and some resinous hops,and on taste its exactly like the aroma with the caramel and toffee the first taste i get followed by some piney resinous hops on finish to give it a nice sweet,bitter finish but mostly sweet,overall if this wasnt so highly priced i would like it as a session beer but given its hefty price tag for a brew that isnt that memorable i dont think ill be rushing out and buying it again but would revisit one day."
"A nice amber lager. Clean, drinkable, with the balance slightly towards the malt, everything this style should be."
"I am a big fan of SACKETS HARBOR BREWING COMPANY - War of 1812 Amber Ale, but this is a step above. What a great beer, great mouth feel, no bitter after taste, exceptional drinkability and down right tasty!!! I love it ..."
"MD- This is a very easy drinking ale. The further down the glass the better the beer tastes. I began with a 3 for taste ans changed it to a 4 by the time I was done drinking it."
"Served in a pislener glass. Look: brown wood color, some transparent, foamy head is durable, very thin and poor retention, like a poplar of snow, I like the cockroaches of the logo; Smell: Biscuity malt with hops of wood and earth; taste, you find wood and ground hops, malt and sweet chestnuts, earthy flavor predominates; Mouthfeel: woody and slightly dry, moderately bitter, medium-bodied, viscous, low carbonation; Drinkability: it took me around to take it, is like drinking wood-water."
"12 oz bottle. Nice clear amber color, decent poofy head. Clean taste with that mineral bent becoming of an amber lager. Moderately hopped and malted, an above-average brew with above average qualities the whole way round. Went nicely with a cheeseburger."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark copper/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, and a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, another thirst quencher."
"D - light and refreshing, pretty classic example of an amber lager."
"Taste is crisp, clean, and slightly sweet with just a touch of mild hops. Thin mouthfeel with relatively little carbonation. A pretty inoffensive and safe beer. Drinkability is good."
"From the 355 ml. bottle marked 166FY10. Sampled on April 8, 2010. The color of the pour is an enticing amber with a quarter inch head the fades away to nothing in about a minute. Excellent clarity. Inviting hops and a modest wheat aroma lead the way on the nose with a dash of fruitiness in the background. The body comes in at about medium. The taste is subtle as a rule with a modest hops, malts, and bread gathering together for an enjoyable but not an extraordinary experience."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable. It looks nice, goes down easy, and is, if not pleasing, certainly passable."
"This beer is certainly mellow as advertised. The flavors are very mild and pleasant. Balanced towards the sweet side with only a little bitter. A nice easy drinking, relaxing beer."
"D - Nothing to really ""seek out"" again but a good beer for the variety pack that stands right beside the pale ale and porter. A decent member of the family."
"Don't bother with this one."
"D: Good drinkability. Good beer"
"Pours a nice amber color with a 1 1/2 finger head that didnt leave any lacing. All I get in the nose is heavy carmel malt and slight hops. The taste is pretty much just carmel malt, very sweet. Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability. This beer is definitely worth trying, but its not an exceptional lager."
"Real nice looking brew, amber color, very clear with what looks to be a good amount of carbonation. Has a nice sized tan head that did break down quite quickly but did leave a sheet of foam at the top of the liquid and some good lacing. The aroma really has a strong malt presence, caramel and slightly grainy - also there seems to be something there that is not overly present but gives a slight stale scent ... as I think about it more it becomes a little more offensive. Too bad because the 12 pack looked to have a sticker that said it was fresh till April of this year. The flavor seems to be pretty good, caramel but maybe a little too sweet? The hops make a quick appearance at the end and then disappears. The carbonation is nice and adds a nice mix with the hops at the end. This is a ok brew, but as I have seen with the other brews from Flying dog there are better examples and tasting brews that are common place around here."
"Overall, decent but average. I would drink it again, but I wont be searching it out."
"Drinkable but a little to much on the sweet side. I think this could be better with just a little more hops."
"The mouthfeel is light with mild carbonation for the style. Not a bad session beer. I could put away a few if you handed them to me. It's not going to make me put away the Brooklyn Lager, though."
"D-I'd order this at a bar if there was nothing more exciting, but if I was having a lager (admittedly, not my favorite style) this wouldn't necessarily be my first choice."
"Pours a clear amber color with a magnificent, foamy tan head. Smells of light cereal grains, and a faint grassiness. Taste is rather thin. Light cereal grains, followed by a slightly metallic hop bitterness. Not much else to speak of. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a semi-dry finish. I would reach for a brooklyn lager or SA boston lager over this any day of the week."
"A dry, clean, light body, with medium carbonation, but not really crisp."
"D - Pretty flavorful lager that's mild overall, but I'll take this over a macro lager any day."
"D- Goes down smooth enough, but I feel like I've pre-disposed myself to not like beer with higher (fusel) alcohols."
"D - Excellent drink-ability, very smooth amber lager. Easy for a non beer drinker to like and great malty ale taste for the more experienced hophead."
"I drink could drink a bunch of these, these days i tend to drink more ales then lagers, and it has a ale touch to it, which could be good or bad how you look at it. I liked this combo personally."
"Pours with a light brown color, very very thin head that diminished quickly. Transparent body. Smells mostly of malts and perhaps a little cinnamon? I'm probably wrong, but the smell has that sort of tingle to it. The taste is like other amber lagers I've had, a little less bite than I've tried which was more tolerable for me. Has a good bite with a bitter ending, drinking a few of these would be a chore."
"Pours a dark amber reddish color body, with almost no head, quickly diminishing. Nutty malty aroma, vegetably/fruity. Some honey, sugars. Dark fruit. Vegetably, fruit essence. Honey. Malty, not very nutty. Not very tasty. Better as it warms, less vegetably. Still not a favorite."
"D: For me, this is a decent session beer. It goes down easily enough. A little more complexity would be nice."
"Overall a fairly drinkable beer that brings something to the table but doesn't really impress in the way that it could. Good, but not great."
"Slightly hazy orange-amber color with a thin yellowy-white head. Very light malty slightly hoppy smell, pretty hard to pick up. The flavor is malty with some slightly citrus hop flavor making an appearance towards the end. The mouth feel is a bit thin, and leaves me wishing for a little bit more substance, as does the flavor. While it is an enjoyable and drinkable beer, the aroma, flavor and mouth feel could all be a bit stronger for my liking."
"Drinkability: Not to heavy, it would be conceivable to drink a few in a row. However, there are better beers on the shelf."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts and hops. Taste of malts, lightly hopped, a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Clean and tasty. Lightly toasted with some citrus hop and bubblegum. Nice."
"The nose of this brew hints at the slight malty sweetness on the back end along with a balanced bitterness. Crisp, nice and mouth watering."
"Overall Impressions: Very interesting in that it drinks like a lager, but has some flavors and characteristics of an ale. Likely (at least in part) a result of brewing at a more medium temperature in comparison to many lagers. Enjoyable and would drink again."
"A great, clean lager with just enough complexity and a remarkable level of drinkability. This has the makings of a refrigerator staple."
"This beer was extremely good. It poors a nice amber color with a hint of bronze. Tastes a little malty but is definatly a sweeter beer. Poored into my boston lager Sam Adams glass. I enjoy this brewery very much and this beer is up in the ranks. This beer has a heavier taste to it but over all tastes good."
"Carbonation is high but mouthfeel is pleasant. It's easy drinking."
"D- A decent brew with a nice sweetness. Not really that much going on though."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a copper color with a small frothy light brown head. Aroma is sweet, caramel malts, a touch of fruit, and a touch of grassy hops. Flavor is caramel malts, more fruitiness, a little buttery, and grapefruit/citrus hops. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, dry, and a solid bitter finish. Very drinkable beer and well balanced."
"D: A good representation of the style, but definitely not groundbreaking. I'd have another."
"Decent beer. Not a favorite, but I'd drink it again. I'd like to try it at another establishment from a different tap system. I'm not convinced that I got the best draw."
"D- Very drinkable, a nice party beer or a starter for moving away from BMC's."
"D: Refreshing and drinkable, but the herbal medicine taste is a little out of place."
"Drinkability: Legit one of the best beers I have ever had. It's not as smooth as Yuengling Lager but is a bit sweeter and less bitter than yuengling."
"This is a decently drinkable beer. It isn't terribly inventive, nor is it my favorite from the Flying Dog lineup, but it's a solid lager that's worth a try if it's available to you."
"D - This was a solid amber...I was really surprised to see the notes of hops in the middle of this beer...I just wish there was more of them...a decent beer to try and I would have again on tap"
"I would buy again, and I bet it is great on tap."
"Very thin mouthfeel but a high drinkability make this a beer to grab, but not to search out."
"a very good beer would defintely drink again"
"Serving type: bottle"
"The beer pours a nice amber color with decent head retention. Lacing was pretty good all the way to the bottom of the glass. First impression was very sweet and malty as well as some nuttiness. Not my favorite characteristics but this beer did pull them off well. The smell was also sweet and very well balanced. I prefer a little bit more bitterness in my beers but this is a respectable amber lager. I'll drink this again if I buy the Flying Dog mix pack again."
"D: Definately a drinkable amber. I do find the roasted and maple flavors enjoyable. Certainly a solid specimen of the style. Memorable? Kind of."
"Notes: Another ""just fine"" beer from Flying dog, a solid if unadventurous brewery."
"The shocker of the bunch."
"Drinkability: Meh. Not that impressive. The Flying Dog mixed pack has been incredibly disappointing. It is definitely not worth the price charged for it. I'd take a Sam Adams mixed pack over this stuff any day."
"Served from a bottle into a Carta Blanca pint glass (don't judge me). Beer is amber in color (shocking), they nailed the color. The head was big at first but fell away and remained about 1/8 of an inch all over the top, once i started drinking it reduced further and was diffuse. Smell....not impressed. There is a smell but its like an odd smelling lager, almost an ocktoberfest, but its a miss. Taste, can taste some diacetyl but its OK. I should say that I'm not a big lager fan here and I'll leave it at that. I think its a decent beer. Drinkability is fine. Could probably put this away in short order but there's no rush. Flying dog may be growing on me."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but there's nothing terribly outstanding about it. Probably a good starting point for beer noobs, but the more refined palate won't find anything remarkable about this one. A beer that's very ""drinkable"" but offers very little in terms of substance. I hope the rest of the Flying Dog mixpack is better."
"Amber Lager pours a golden brown with a moderate amount of head formation that idles briefly. At first smell, the nose picks up scents of toast and malt. On the tongue there is some malt sweetness that is slightly balanced by some hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is that of silky carbonation and aftertaste fades quickly. Would be more drinkable if it had more of a crisp taste on the palate."
"D: Fairly smooth and flavorful. Something not quite right. Don't know this woiuld be a repeat for me."
"D: wonder where it went, one of the best beers my mother picked out for me, worth a try."
"Drinkability: Eh, its okay. Its weak and bitter without any complimentary malts or flavors to balance it out. All-in-all its not that great, only has 5.5 abv and just doesn't really stand out unless you like straight-up bitter"
"Overall: For a lager its too watery, it could use some more complexity for the sake of purpose instead of just throwing a bunch of ingredients in to say they are there."
"I don't like my review, even as I do a spell check on it. I am going to reserve my right for a do over on this one, at the first opportunity. Poured a crystal clear, orange/amber with a modest head that reduced quickly to a collar. The aroma was malty sweet. The taste was sweet/sour. The feel was light bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability was good."
"Pours a light red/amber color with just a bit of head and no lacing. Nice sweet malty scent with a little hint of tartness. Good malty taste, a nice deep draught with a bit of heaviness to it from the specialty malts/grains. Goes down very well with just a hint of lager tartness at the ned."
"This poured a nice carbonated amber/orange, with a head that laced well. The smell was a balanced mixture of sweet maltiness and floral hops. A little toffee and caramel in there too. The taste surpassed the nose by a mile; definitely a hearty balance of caramel/toffee/roasted malt against a hop backdrop. Very good for a lager. I find that we beergeeks are quick to judge all beers based on more complex-smelling and -tasting styles, but we shouldn't forget to judge lagers against other lagers. This is a good example. The mouthfeel was nice and medium-bodied with decent carbonation, and I think that this combined with the surprising flavor make it a very good session beer."
"Verdict: Old Scratch is simply decent at best and ends up being totally unable to hold my attention. It's not that it is a bad-tasting beer, it just fails in offering anything worth coming back for."
"Overall a good beer. I really think I need to get a fresh one. Everyone raves about Flying Dog, so maybe I should try a different bottle."
"Pours a hazy copper with a decent head. The flavor is light caramel and fruity, but not citrusy. The finish is a little dry and almost tastes like butter. Perhaps more like butterscotch. Very smooth and drinkable. A very good all-day beer. I'm not blown away by it, but I do like it and would certainly get it again!"
"Overall: A very nice, easy drinking Lager with some complexity, lots of malt flavor, and just enough bitterness to add some balance. It's not as smooth as Yuengling Lager but a nice alternative for those looking to take a swim in the craft beer pool."
"D- Put it this way if Amberbock or Yinglying tasted this good sales would be on the incline."
"Overall, this is barely one step above a macro. I didn't care for this at all."
"If I am looking for a session beer, Old Scratch will be high on my list."
"D: An ok beer, nothing more nothing less. It could really use more flavors and complexity, as for now, it comes out a bit thin. But still it's quite refreshing."
"Light, amber color with a white head. Mild hops and roasted toffee smell. Taste contains chestnut, which is grainy and earthy, but also has a lot of sweetness to it, imparted from kiwi and cherry tastes. Very watery. Slightly bitter and seems like a wannabe IPA, but again, too thin in character to be hoisted as a red lager. Finish is unexceptional. A bit crisp and salty."
"Pours a orange amber color with a one finger head that gives way quickly. There is no lacing left behind. The smell is all malt, the smell isn't overpowering, it is malt with a hint of caramel. The taste is the same it is a little weaker than i was expecting, the taste is of malt and caramel notes. Mouthfeel is carbonated, it is a medium carbonation. Overall it is a very average beer, there is some complexity to it, you could have a couple of them, but not a lot."
"D: This is a flavorful beer with excellent drinkability. The malt character is interesting and certainly worth a try. Nothing spectacular, just a very enjoyable beer."
"Clear beautiful dark amber color. Head fizzles down to nothing fast leaving behind no trace of lace. Smells malty with a good pinch of booze to wake up the senses. Good malt flavor blended nicely. Smooth feel across the pallet. One of the better beers of theirs that I've had."
"Cheers!"
"The brew makes for a great BBQ beer. Not too thin, and slightly complex."
"Decent atmosphere. Appearance leaves alot to the imagination, but the nose makes up for it a bit. Really pleasing, with a nice combination of components. Full flavor. Good balance of light bitterness and subtle sweetness. Overall, this is a pretty nice quaff."
"(D)- These could be had one after another easy enough. Definitely better than your average beer. Straightforward and refreshing."
"D - That's one tasty amber lager that's balanced well and is mellow enough to be enjoyed one after another certainly."
"Pours with a light head. As an IPA fan, I was supprised by the flavor and lightness of the beer. The color is tanish with no unfiltered material. The taste is well ballanced, not too bitter yet not too flat. Over all, a good lager even for those who do not particularly like lagers. I especially enjoy the twelve pack mix that I purchaced it in."
"Drinkabilty: This is definitely something I could drink again. It worked well for me on a warm day and I feel it would work well in the cold winter as well."
"Pours a nice amber color, very clear with not much of a head to speak of. Lively carbonation. Smells slightly of malt. No lacing. Smooth on the palate... light and clear with hints of caramel and a medium finish. Not a lot of character to set it apart, but an easy to drink amber beer with a good flavor."
"Cheers!"
"D- These would go down okay on a hot day. So far this is the back of the pack of all the Flying Dogs I've tried. I wouldn't turn it down, but I won't buy it unless it happens to be in a mix pack again."
"D: To me this is just average. Nothing really sticks out in the flavors or aroma and the mouthfeel was pretty disappointing."
"Overall, not my favorite in any way from Flying Dog."
"D: Another pretty average beer from a pretty average brewery. There's nothing at all here to separate this from the overcrowded pack of amber lagers. Not bad, but just blah."
"Drinkability- Great session beer."
"Not overly impressed, only had a few beers in this style and much prefer the Brooklyn Lager to this version."
"D= very high. Tastes great. I don't understand the low rating for the style. Quite nice."
"Overall, second time in a row that I'm not impress with Flying Dog beer. This one does not stand out of most regular amber lager."
"I believe it is half decent; but there are better options out there. A slight dissapointment from what I feel is a great brewery."
"D- Drinkable probably pick up a six-pack here and there."
"I tend to stray from fusion beers, except dogfish heads (they seem to always get them right) and this is not an exception. A lager with an amber flavor, I do not have the greatest palate so I have a hard time explaining it but the refined flavor of a lager does not mix with the amber beer flavor. Sometimes I think that flying dog gets away with mediocre beer because of their porter and their artwork, who is drinking this on a regular basis?"
"Mouthfeel is antiquated. The malts taste old and the hops are slightly stale on the palate. Both contribute to a dry finish even though the beer is smooth and mild bodied at the start. I could drink more of this but I'm not really inclined to. This is an average beer that is good in a pinch. I'll give it refreshing but not desirable. Worth a try but I wouldn't buy it again unless I was invited to an amber lager party and was assigned this beer to bring."
"Creamy and slow on the tongue. This is an incredible lager chocked full of malty goodness and with ample amounts of hops. Full of flavor and of high quality. Up there with the best"
"D - Respectable offering from Flying Dog, though not my favorite by far."
"Medium amber in color with active prickle in the glass and a higher than average concentration of bubbles from the carbonation. There is little to no head even right after being poured. I guess the carbonation and volatility is in all of those bubbles. The nose has an understated malt quality to it, maybe some gentle caramel notes. The attack is mild with a pleasant and smooth malt flavor. It seems to me that there are gentle flavors of caramel blended with some coffee flavor that give a net result of smokiness. The finish is very clean, so all of the tasting happens with it in your mouth."
"The color is a brownish color with some red hues with a very little beige foam head that dissapated immediatley. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with no hops. Flavor was slightly sweet caramel apple coating sweet malt with almost no bitterness to balance it out. Body was low to medium. Better than a flat tire but not by too much."
"Overall this beer is slightly above average and I would try it again. But it would not be at the top of my list."
"It's also a light and smooth drink."
"D: Doesn't quite fit the style for me. A decent beer, but nothing super special about it."
"Do Not Want"
"Notes: A decent beer. Nothing special here and I just felt it was pretty boring. All in all it was still o.k."
"Pours a nice clear coppery amber with a white head that does not stick around. Aroma is strong and malty with hints of banana and butterscotch. Crisp flavor is mainly malty with some hop bitterness and an undertone of banana. Texture is smooth, fizzy and jazzy. A good choice."
"Poured from the bottle. Pours a medium amber with a smaller slightly off white head that dies off rather quickly. A reasonable aroma with hints of light hop and malt. Taste is smooth on the tongue with hints of malt, caramel, and a bit of hops as well. Easy to drink, but lacking complexity. A clean, rather crisp finish."
"Overall quite drinkable and worth a try."
"Pours a dark amber, with a medium tan head. Smell is somewhat rusty, not too hot. Taste is quite a bit better, toasted grain, a hint of diacytal, and a very earthy hop flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat rough, high carbonation. Drinkability is quite good though, it would be easy to drink several of these. All in all a good beer, i would drink it again."
"Overall - Very solid, sessionable beer to relax with and enjoy a ball game."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. Like I said above - nothing harsh. Easy on the mouth. At 5.3% ABV and not a really strong flavor I could drink multiple of these in a given session. Because this is not really robust or rich flavored I would use this as a utility beer."
"Kind of... unusual for a lager, but serves the purpose to a tee. A six-pack is around $35 AUD, so I won't be taking it to too many BBQs, but that's not to say I wouldn't like to."
"D. I would like this beer in the autum, it reminded me of a new england fall."
"yuengling is the better amber lager."
"Nice amber color, caramel malty smell with pretty good head and decent ringer. Good looking beer. Good smell. Taste is clean and malty, not exceptionally great but still a very good beer. Easy to drink and easy... Mouthfeel is decent, clean and malty with pretty good aftertaste. Malty all the way, very little hops but just enough and smooth..."
"The appearance is really good. Great copper color with thick, lacey head. Ummmm looks tasty... Smells of malt and hops. Dry, smooth taste. With hoppy, deep flavors. The aftertaste is sweet. This is a good lager. Purchased after a recommendation from our local liquor owner."
"D. Very high, the light body and flavors would make this a great session beer. Over all its an good yet average beer."
"12 oz bottle. Cloudy amber pour. No real head to speak of. Malt and quite a bit of floral hop characteristics. A bit of a dry bitter finish for an amber. Not bad, I'm just not sure it fits with the style. I think the things that make their high gravity beers excellent might be working against them in this. Not to say I wouldn't drink it again though."
"pours amber, obviously, got about a 1 finger head out of it. Can smell the malts in this one, also some citrus-y smell. tastes pretty good to me, taste a bit of that citrus, also getting good malt taste, with just a bit of bitterness in the end. overall a pretty tasty brew, but nothing overwhelming about it, its not that memorable."
"D - No thanks."
"Decent drinkability - I liked the beer, though not sure I'd re-up."
"This is a decent beer, but I don't think it is one that I will keep regularly."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, I wasn't expecting much of anything from this beer but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a pretty decent beer overall."
"Seeing as my review is so much lower than the average, I imagine maybe I just got an old bottle. I may have to try this again in the future, but I don't know if I'd get around to it with so many other good brews floating around out there."
"this brew pours up an amber color with a nice big 'ol off white head. pretty nice lacing too. I smell sweet malts, faint hops in the finish. Smells like a sweaty day in the mid summer. I taste basically the same as the nose. Sweet malts, faint hops, caramel, and a whole lotta love. medium bodied, low smoothe carbo. a great sessionable beer."
"P.S. this was judged as a Cali Common... which leads me to ask why it's not classified as that here??"
"Overall a pretty standard Amber Lager. I might consider this to be slightly better than other Amber Lager's I have had."
"Overall this is a pretty tasty beverage. I was not really impressed with the apperance or smell. What lacks in smell and apperance is brought up in taste and mouth feel. I think it has a very light crisp taste and very refreshing. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and is very refreshing on the way down. I think this is a decent beer."
"This was an OK beer. It was amber in color with a medium-sized white head. Not much aroma, just a little bit of caramel malt. The malt came through a little more in the taste, but was still understated. Little bit of hop finish. I had a couple of these, and wouldn't want any more."
"Old Scratch had a beautiful amber-to-light-caramel color upon pouring. The aroma presented bisquity but had not much going on in the way of flavor. This amber lager had a smooth kind of heavy mouthfeel. Overall, not too impressed by this one and probably wouldn't get this again."
"d: An ok lager. Simple, fairly approachable, but pretty ordinary. If you're looking for a simple lager, you could do better."
"Overall an excellent lager. I wish it were a little more easy to find; this would be a great beer to have as a regular option at restaurants and bars."
"Good drinkability, very smooth, good taste but I prefer a lager with a bit more body. Overall good and worth a try."
"Pretty much what I expected, bit of mild hop aroma little flavor but a nice upfront clean bitterness. lends a nice crispness to the brew. Along with the carbonation being a little overdone, not the best brew for a cold winter day, but some where sunny and warm, and this would be a perfect brew."
"D - Drinkable beer. Not too bitter, nice flavor"
"Good beer to try, but don't overindulge. It fills you up for a lager."
"Poured a dark honey color with a fleeting head leaving a very thin line with little lacing. Smells of alcohol, malts and a slight hoppy floralness with a bit of a musty quality. The flavor is malty up front not unlike a malt liquor with little else going on aside from a slight sweetness. Light body with appropriate carbonation."
"D: Very good. Not a terribly complex beer, but an easy-drinking lager with some flavor and balance. . . ."
"Pours a clear amber color. Good 1/2 inch head, but poor retention and little to no lacing. Smells of hops and a strong lager smell. There is also only a hint of malt aroma. Fits the style pretty well. Smooth, crisp, average carbonation, and there it imparts a dry quality on the tongue. Hops are noticeable up front, but quickly disappear. There is a slight malt background, but mostly the lager flavor is dominant. Overall, a little weak and a little to high of carbonation, but otherwise a good beer."
"Nikki"
"A nice amber pour,with a solid one finger of off whiote head. Very nice aroma,of toasted/burnt malt,with a slight tinge of hops,and maybe a hint of berries. A big malt flavor of sweet,and toasted malt,rye bread.Light to medium body,appealing mouthfeel, with a kind of boozy finish. I deem this a solid offering,and will buy again."
"Pours a very nice neon red, very nice. A bit of aroma, not too much, but some caramel malt in there. Tastes waaay too dry for me to enjoy, there are some decent hops and some maple syrup and caramel, but this is just way too dry to work with those flavors. Won't buy this again."
"Overall, a great beer to wind down with after a day at work. Not heavy, but not too light. I look forward to trying more from Flying Dog in the near future."
"Partially through the beer and most of the citrus takes over, but it remains on the lighter side. The only thing I'm not totally digging is the bitterness afterward."
"Overall the brew is good but a little on the plain side. The drinkability is high. This been goes down very easily and would be a good session beer."
"Good beer, I happen to enjoy this one, it has a small hint of citrus in it, overall it was a little more bitter than what I like in an amber. I happen to like ambers almost as much as I like the good ol fashion White beers. I would try the other flying dog beers, I tend to like these as much."
"drinkability: is so so. I really didn't care for this beer. Finish is merely nonexistent."
"D - Good drinkability due to the lightness"
"It has medium yellow amber body. There is a good lace and off-white head. Both have average staying power. The aroma has variety sweet fruity malt and hops tones and maybe a little roasted caramel. The smell kind of fooled me. The flavor is more bitter than the smell but that was good because it made it more balanced of citric and sweet. It is almost medium bodied and has some fizz bite."
"Cheers!!!"
"D-High drinkability due to ease of consumption. It's light flavor and non-assertive bitterness keeps this one light and refreshing. Would be a good session beer, for a longer session."
"this beer pours a amber color with red notes adn an off white head that promises to fade to lacing. the aroma presents a lot of caramel, and other maltiness. the taste presents a nice amount of roasted malt and lager taste with a medium hop finish. good co2 and a medium bodymake this a drinkable beer."
"A nice lager with more bitterness than i expected from it. This would make a good sessionbeer. Worth a try!"
"Kind of disappointing in the taste. There is a bit of caramel up front but it kind of subsides into grainy, watery confusion. There is some late bitterness and plenty of carbonation but this isn't really what I expect from an amber lager at all."
"Mouthfeel is good, carbonation near perfect. Bitterness is well balanced throughout the mouth. Very pleasant overall taste. Drinkable enough but there is definately better beer to try although this is no dissapointment."
"The color when poured was had a reddish hue ot this medium dark amber, with very little foam that disapated immediatley. The smell of mild roasted malts, with a hint of candy filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. But, the taste of roasted malts and a hint of butterschoch, was to bitter for my taste. A very good ale, made unpleasant because of an over powering bitter feel in the mouth and palate. Not what I expected for this amber ale."
"dog."
"Drinkability: Sweet and bitter in balance and it is smooth and easy to drink. Could drink a few of these in a row."
"The best one of the Flying Dog mixed pack, It pours a beautiful deep red color and has a very thick body for the style which makes for a great mouthfeel. Tastes of caramel malts and is a really drinkable beer. This is a damn good one and I would try it again for sure."
"D - Once is enough. Amber lagers aren't my thing...."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't pass one up but wouldn't go out of my way to seek one either."
"All in all, a very solid, complex and drinkable amber lager. I dug it."
"B'ham UK Sept 2008"
"One of the better Flying Dog varieties. Beautiful medium amber color, soft carbonation and decent head with nice lacing. All malt in the nose. Taste is the same, smooth caramel malt with a hops bitterness that borders on a bit too bitter. Drinkability suffers a bit from the aftertaste."
"Nothing special about this one, don't get me wrong its a good beer but nothing stuck out. I just poured it, drank it, and moved on to the next flying dog. Decent malts, not to much spice, smooth beer. There are better ones out there so I wouldn't recommend it."
"D - Very good lager. Not to over powering, very drinkable."
"D- Too sweet to session for me but some folks might like it."
"A nice lager with nice flavor and a hop presence. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a four finger slight cream head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty/hoppy nose. Flavor is sweet and malty and stays that way especially as it starts to warm. But not overly malty there are enough hops for a good balance. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"D- entirely drinkable lager with ale characteristics. doesn't go over the top or push any envelopes, it stays in a safe zone and just does its thang."
"Solid beer that is drinkable and flavorful, like many flying dog ales."
"Overall, it's a decent beer that goes down easily but doesn't do much to impress in the flavor department. Maybe a good starter beer to wean your friends off BMC. For me, one and done. Too many other good beers out there."
"M&D: lightly effervescent on the mouthfeel, medium-bodied, slightly on the thin-ish side but quite easy-drinking; this so-called ""American Amber Lager"" tastes not bad, but surely in need of a clearer character or a more pronounced profile to make it shine. At the moment it's like a sweeter and less hoppy cross b/w Vienna Lager and a fruity English Best Bitter."
"overall- an enjoyable easily drinkable lager"
"Medium body, with good carbonation. Not bad. Well balanced."
"Overall- I was hoping for a little more refreshing beer. The sweetness make it more of a one and done."
"Mouthfeel is high on carbonation, thin on the palate, and easy to drink. Unfortunately it just isn't very flavorful."
"Poured a clear amber and topped off by a two finger frothy tan head. Retention is good and a craggy lacing is left behind. Smells grainy and malty with some sweet tea and lemon in the background. Tastes sweet and sugary but not at all cloying. Mouth-feel is light. Carbonation is medium. This brew keeps it's drinkability while still being interesting and tasty."
"D: Sweet and bitter in balance and it is smooth and easy to drink. Was a better beer then I expected. Could drink a few of these in a row."
"D: Overall, a nice, drinkable beer. A nice combination of crisp, refreshing mouthfeel and a smooth, robust malt taste. Definitely an excellent summer brew."
"This brewery puts out some pretty decent beers. It's not my overall favorite but I do enjoy this amber and am looking forward to my twelve pack sampler!"
"reviewed on my phone."
"This is a good representative of how I like my Ambers. Great job by the Flying Dog boys. I'd get this again."
"D= probably fairly drinkable even in quantity if it's being poured or served. Worth the try. Probably great with most meals."
"I wouldn't recommend this beer. If you have to drink it it's not the worst thing in the world, but I wouldn't choose to drink it again."
"HV"
"Malty crisp, sweet aromas, and a handshake of hops to balance. Flavor walks a tightrope, suspended above the safe zone. Clean pipes of sweet grain and a time reminiscent of gold prospectors drinking with San Francisco transvestite gold diggers. Not bad from the half ass boys. I think I like it."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured small foamy head on a light amber body. Sweet, caramel dominated the smell, and the taste, with coffee coming through in the taste as well. Also a dustiness that wasn't so nice. Medium bitterness was nice, and it's medium carbonation was nice as well. Okay, nothing too special or remarkable, but that dustiness didn't help."
"Something about this beer, I just don't find very drinkable."
"Little head but nice color. Rich amber but minimal lacing. Decent scents of sweet malt and slight carmel are the most abundant smells that I smell. Good malty sweet flavor but nothing too extraordinary. Nice body and it's a good sipping beer. Better than average but not awesome."
"D: A decent amber lager, worthy of a try."
"As I poured the Old Scratch into my pint glass I wasn't surprised at what I saw. A clean, molasses-colored brew with a mild head. Light carbonation rests on the tongue instead of attacking it but the flavorful brew my tastebuds were waiting for did not come. An aftertaste richer than the initial is what followed. There are subtle notes of deep, mohagany that go over well but they hide in the background a little too much. This beer is a pretty good amber lager but sacrifices flavor too much for my liking. This dog needs a kick in the ass to make it fly."
"D: Not a bad beer, just kind of boring overall, and the flavour isn't great. Much rather have a Sam Adams."
"D : I just don't care for it. Not one I would try again."
"This is a pretty bland beer overall. Not a whole lot of flavor, really, and while it is drinkable I don't think I'd revisit."
"This is a drinkable beer, overall not bad."
"Pours a clean amber/ orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, small sweet maltiness. In the taste, malty, sweet and somewhat skunky. A small bite and medium mouthfeel, with a dry malty aftertaste. Kind of skunky taste, malty and dry. Really not that good."
"D - I was impressed with this amber. Full flavor and smooth mouthfeel. Definitely a sessionable lager."
"Pours a one finger head with that recedes to a small, thin island of foam in the middle. Tecolor is a nicecarml copper with some light, lazy bubbling. The aroma has some caramel, light orange sauce witha hint of mint hops. These scent are pretty hard to detect though. The taste is a fruity carmel with a toasted malt finish mixed with some light spruce hop notes. The palate is a light, sweet fruit mixed with earthy hops. With a bit of carameled hops."
"Pours a rich amber color with minimal head. Aroma is lightly hopped with a touch of sulfur and some caramel. Taste is malty but not overbearing - mostly caramel flavors with a faint amount of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is creamier than expected and medium-bodied - easy to drink like a god lager should be. Overall a good standard, everyday, type of beer."
"Probably a very pleasant drink for a calm evening."
"Its a nice ambe colored brew with a smallish quickly receiding head. Smells of toasted and sweet malts with hints of floral hops. Taste is mainly toasted malts upfront and throughout with some sweet hints and a little hop hit in the rear. Has a nice mouth feel but isn't overly drinkable because of the lack of overall flavor. Not a bad beer but I would't seek it out."
"A pretty decent drinking lager from Flying Dog, but not a standout by any means."
"OVerall a decent beer. Not a great beer, but a good lager. Enough flavor to make it interesting. Light enough to make it drinkable."
"Malt flavors mostly, but nice and clean. Sweet at first with pale ale richness, then a little tart with a nice toasty malt syrup-- then nutty, dry, and biscuity, even with a slight astringency. Supremely smooth with a nice bitterness and a surprisingly dry finish."
"D - Because nothing is too overwhelming, and it has a nice light flavor, it is a nice session beer."
"Old Scratch is a decent Lager of clear orangey-copper color, with a modest lid of fine off-white fuzz. It brings some very light sweet caramel and apricots to the table, along with a more pronounced toasted biscuit and spicy hop character. It's pretty light and watery with a modest fizzy carbonation. This completes my Flying Dog sampler and this one, like most of the others, is a decent beer with good drinkability and some flavor. Better than macro stuff, but nothing amazing. I'm thinking the Canis Major sampler I just bought will impress me more."
"Though this is not a beer that will blow you over, I think it's very drinkable and I would gladly have a few more."
"Last one from the sample pack. An ok appearance: some patchy lacing over a typically delicious amber-red color look. The aromas were a bit weak. Had little roasty aromas with a general floral smell. The taste has a good sweetness to it, a bit of honey with caramel and malts. The mouthfeel is a good strong point: pretty crisp and carbonated. Overall, a decent red lager."
"I'm not a huge fan of this one because I was expecting a lager and got something with more ale qualities in my judgement. I'd like to know the yeast strain and temp."
"M/D: Sweet at the back, nice and refreshing. Was happy to see this wasn't a drain pour, like their Tire Bite I just tasted."
"D: Decently drinkable, but it really doesn't have enough flavor to hold up well enough to be enjoyable long-term. Still a decent beer, though."
"Drinkability - Goes down very smooth and refreshes the palate."
"D-Its easy enough to drink but not something that i would reach for very often as it doesnt have enough flavor for me i have had much better ambers."
"D: Smooth hoppiness, nice balance, and a good malty sweetness provides for a smooth drink."
"I would like to have this on draft, may be better!"
"D - 4.5 might seem high, but this is extremely drinkable. It's not too heavy, not too belch-inducing, and not bitter. All this alone makes a good session beer, but the wonderful simplicity of flavor is what pushes this into a great session beer. I'm trying this via a Flying Dog mix pack, but I could definitely see myself buying a sixer of this for a night with friends."
"Drinkability- Wow, Flying Dog has been impressing me so far. Another session quality beer."
"pours a clear light-med. copper color w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving a decent amount of lacing down my nonic ; a decent smell, a steely grain and toasty caramel, smells a bit raisony and metallic ; a crisp and robust deep malt flavor, a bit minerally but blends well with darker fruits and a clean finish ; dry and light but w/ some residual sweetness and decent co2 make this a very creamy feeling brew tho ; wow, very drinkable, i wish i had a few cases of this..."
"A little too much like a weak-kneed malt liquor. Drinkable, but not particularly memorable."
"D-I think I had four or five pints and I enjoyed every single one"
"D- Very easy to drink and goes down with a little bite. This would be nice on a hot day this summer."
"D: The drinkability of this brew is about average. It seemed a little dry and a bit light in character, but overall wasn't too bad. I don't know that I would go seeking this one out but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"Over all a decent brew, however I don't think that I'll be seeking this out on a regular basis. Especially when I consider the quality of this, the difficulty of finding it in my area in contrast to its overall flavor."
"A deep amber color with a haf inch off white head. Smells of caramel and malts. Has an interesting sweet and sour taste to it, the malts and caramel dominating the mouth with a slight hoppy after taste. Not a bad after-effect in the mouth, though it leaves the palate a little dry. Definately a drinkable beer, I wish I'd bought more than just one."
"Probably the plainest beer you will find from Flying Dog. It's a great session ale, with it's mild %ABV and smoot characteristics. Recommended."
"D - Nice session beer, not too complicated but enough to satisfy. A good inclusion in the mixed 12 packs."
"Drinkability: The initial flavor isn't bad, but the sourness and bitterness turn this into an unappealing chore to drink. The feeling that it leaves in the mouth and the throat isn't a good thing, and the flavor of it makes it sit heavy in the stomach. It's not the worst beer I've ever had by a long shot, but I expected more from it."
"Very good drinkability. Seems like a good darker beer to drink in the warmer months. Flavorful, but light enough for a session."
"Drinkability - If you're in the desert and you come upon an oasis with a running refridgerator (bear with me here) and it was stocked with nothing but ice cold flying roach beer....I'd choose death. The rest of these beers in my fridge will be thrown away or given to a homless person on the street."
"What can I say, body is mid to light. Really this beer was pretty bad."
"Drinkability - There is none. Maybe they threw a bunch of the flying roaches in while brewing. I usually don't like to judge a bottle by the label, but I mean come on. Get your act together and slap a real label on there. No one wants a flying roach on the bottle. Fire whoever came up with this idea!"
"One of Flying Dogs more flavorful brews. Not as thin as most, I was a bit impressed. Pours pale amber with a malty nose. Tall caramel malts attack my taste buds with the hops jumping up and down in the back. A bit of swishing and I finally see them and order them to the front for a decent, refreshing finish. I recommend for a not too sugary after dinner treat."
"D: i would say that it is a decent attempt at an amber lager but comes up a bit short isn't quite clear cut or defining in any category"
"Overall, this was a medium-bodied, average depiction of the style - nothing above and beyond, and wouldn't really go out of my way to recommend this one..."
"D: Pretty solid take on the american amber lager.."
"Drinkability- Amber Ale is a good beer, quite drinkable and crisp."
"My first Flying Dog beer. One of six different Flying Dog brews I bought in a variety pack that has me looking forward to the rest of them."
"Poured into my pint glass and received a seethru but dark ruby/copper body with some nice head and a little lacing. I didn't notice too much in the nose area except a mild, grainy malt smell. Could've been my nose, not the beer. A soft, roasted flavor that is medium-bodied with touches of caramel and even some fruit. Went down very smooth and refreshing with a list hoppy backbite, so you know you're drinking a beer, not water. Very easy on the palate and definitely a session beer."
"Pours a light, orangey amber color with a decent off white head and excellent clarity. Aromas are full of biscuity, toasty malts. There's also quite a bit of fruity ester notes, some apple, and a hint of cocoa. Hop aroma comes across as grassy and almost vegetal, IBU far lower than style or Anchor Steam. On the palate, it is very clean with more lager like qualities, I'm going to have to say BJCP miscatagorized this beer. Hop flavor is quite prominent and bitterness isn't as soft as I'd expect for 19 IBUs. Toasty and light estery flavors continue through in the flavor. Overall, a really nice lager, a bit more body than other foreign examples."
"D: Quite nice. I liked this one and could have more."
"Drinkability- A solid lager, well worth a shot."
"Give this one a try. Buy a sixer and take it camping or something."
"Good, not great, but good."
"Poured a nice brown-orange color. Head disappates quickly, not much for lacing. Smell is muted, but hints of bitterness and a slight metallic came through. Taste is well bodied with some bitterness and some mild floral flavors. Mouthfeel is refreshing and dry. Overall a pretty good drink."
"Appearance deep amber in color two finger white head that left a little quick for my taste. Smell was of caramel and sweet malt. Taste was much the same as the smell bu with just a hint of bitterness in the finish to balance it out. Mouthfeel mediem body mediem carbonation. Drinkability had one at the bar at Ruby Tuesday and wanted another but my food came and I had to go."
"Clearish copper pour with a little beige head. Smell at first is very metallic, but it subsides after resting 3-4 minutes. Turns into a caramelly malty, light yeast smell, that is substantially more appealing. Nice, smooth creamy malty amber flavor. Not too full bodied of a mouthfeel, but it has a nice flavor. This was a decent beer that I could have again, but didn't really strike me as one that I should."
"I could session this stuff. Much more character then most domestic lagers as far as flavor goes. A very straight forward ""as advertised"" kind of beer. Not spectacular, but far from mediocre."
"The astringency in the beer really takes away from the overall impression."
"Drinkability is low, I didn't finish this one because it just didn't work for me and life's too short. Don't think it was spoiled or anything, just a gross taste from whatever malt/esters/hop combo they picked. Wouldn't want to power though and chug this one either, insta-puke!"
"Clean tasting and the hops only come through at the very end., and the type is completely indistinguishable. The malt is fantastic on this beer. Rich and complex"
"Old scratch had a very low hop profile, perhaps too low for style. I realize that an Amber Lager is suposed to have a low hop profile, but this one is a bit low for my liking. This is very malty, but so much so that it carries a very sweet flavor profile."
"D: decent and worth a try in the mix pack, but not to get a six pack. probably the least favorite from an otherwise pretty good selection from flying dog"
"D - Don't like it at all. It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste at all."
"Overall - Probably my least favourite Flying Dog beer... maybe worth a try once..."
"Instead, they've bottled mediocrity, a nice-looking but bland beer that will make me selective when considering something from Flying Dog. I remember a couple years ago, I asked a cashier at the local Friar Tuck's what he thought about Flying Dog, and he said that he didn't like their beer, but didn't elaborate. With a few exceptions, I'm not enamored with their wares, either. I'd avoid Old Scratch."
"Overall: Dependable beer with good flavors that are subtle make this one to try again."
"Other: Not Really Impressed as an Absense of Hops Becomes Neccessary to Balance the Overly Malty Flavors."
"Smell is malty, not hoppy. Taste is somewhat smoker with hops and earthy dry finish. Is a drinkable beer, but really needs some sort of food to accompany this brew."
"My old notes show, Old Scratch as a much better beer.. I am not sure if my palate has evolved or if Flying Dog has taken a hit.. anyway, another good gateway beer that nobody could say ""I don't like dark beers."""
"Taste is rather mild, no real hops on the palate, with a clean maltiness and finish only a lager can produce."
"This American Amber has some body, and is nicely carbonated. A good crossover session beer for your BMC buddies."
"Drinkability: Decent brew, but lacks the qualities that could help this beer become a standout."
"Overall this one is merely ""okay"". I can't say I am really blown away at all. The only thing that set this score higher is the appearance and fragrance of it. Other than that, it would be quite lower."
"Taste of caramel, wood and nuts. The beer tastes like a spiced up pilsner with added caramel malts which increase body and taste. Typical bottom fermented beer with light, clean taste, maybe some very light sulfur. Hops are very low. Body is medium and drinkability is OK."
"This is one solid brew in a nice line by Flying Dog. Pours a red/copper color with a nice head, a bit sticky. Nicely done, smells of nutty malts and some hops. Is very smooth and highly drinkable. A great session beer, and fairly priced. Nice baseball drinking beer that is crisp, smooth, and refreshing."
"Very clear and deep reddish amber, this one produced a tin off-white head full of fine bubbles. It showed good head retention with some sticky lacing clinging to the glass. The aroma was pretty clean, balanced towards maltiness, with a very mild caramel character and a bit of floral hops. Mild bitterness with the balance in favour of malty sweetness. Hops were floral with a hint of citrus. Caramel came forward at the end and the bitterness really popped in the finish. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, fairly crisp, solid texture. Very easy drinking, well balanced and well made. I'd definitely have this again."
"D - Decent but nothing exciting. I was tossing up whether to get this or not. Luckily I only got two bottles."
"Yes, I could enjoy more of this, if I had."
"Pours a ruby-red/amber color with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is light and crisp, malty and much like an amber. Taste is malty and even somewhat smoky, somewhat of a cross between a scottish ale and lager? Mouthfeel is ok if not somewhat dullish and metallic. It's also somewhat overwhelmed by the maltiness of this beer, leaving my mouth dry. While it gets points for being drinkable, the dryness is kind of a let-down here.What's odd is the name doesn't quite match the style (California common/steam beer) and that's probably why I'm confused on style."
"It is well balanced fruity lager, with a nice refreshing mouthfeel. It is not overpowering, and could easily appeal to a mainstream market, if the price was a bit cheaper. Not bad, and I am glad I only bought a couple of bottles. Good for a try, but not something I would buy more of, if readily available in Australia."
"D = I do not plan to try this again but it was not offensive such that I would turn it down if offered. As a steam beer Anchor is much better. As a lager, I'd rather have SA Boston Lager or frankly even something like PBR. Could drink this, but with so many other choices, I do not think so."
"But if YOU like craft beer, I wouldnt necessarily recommend this beer unless you are buying the Mix Pack (the others will carry the deadweight from this one)"
"But please change your label artwork!"
"Though mildly hopped and void if any carbonation, I thought it had the characteristics of a flat lager. It was, at least, easy on the palate; but given, other choices, I would not spend too much time with it. I was not impressed and neither was my palate. This said, I still respect the brewery and will also drink their beers should I find them. Nuff said."
"Good dark amber appearance with orange hues on the edges. Light toasty malts and a modest brush of alcohol in the nose, a little fruity too, and caramel. Similar to Anchor Steam, but overall the flavor is a bit toned down. It's nice to see a brewery with an extended distribution network to brew this style."
"Retrospect: certainly not a bad beer by any means, stronger taste for a lager than average but not up to par with other beers by this brewery."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer"
"Drinkability: A decent beer, but I wasn't that impressed. This is the ""California Common"" I can remember tasting besides Anchor Steam."
"Overall, I prefer Old Scratch to Anchor Steam in the steam beer/California Common market, but maybe that's just me. The Anchor Steam tends to be a tad too acrid, whereas the Flying Dog maintains a bittersweet integrity throughout the brew."
"D - Over all a good beer could be a session beer worth a try"
"Pours a clear deep amber with a whitish one finger head. Short lived head leaves little-to-no lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet, malty, caramel and smooth. Taste is also sweet, caramel, malty with a slight hop bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and slick, with a little mouthcoating feeling and a medium viscocity. Overall this is a decent brew. I will probably be enjoying this in the near future, if I can keep my wife away from it."
"The beer poured a light amber with a sparse tan head. The aroma is of sweetish malt, not very strong. The taste is nice and biscuity, just good solid malt, with just enough hops to keep it from being too sweet. The feel is medium and wet. This is a nice pleasant beer and one I'm sure I will sample again."
"This was my fourth sampling from my mix twelve pack of Flying Dog beer. The beer poured a pretty amber color with a fluffy head that soon went away to almost nothing. The nose smells like a hint of grains and some malt. The taste is sweet with some light hops, Mouthfeel was good and I could definitely drink a few of these."
"D - Nice, sessionable beer. The malt character is quite nice and the hops are subdued but they come out when they need to. Overall no complaints, but I have to wonder why Beer Advocate classifies this as a steam beer because it does not really strike me as one"
"Pours clear copper with a big rocky head. Aroma is faint spicy hops. Taste is malty, hints of fruit, toasted malt. A few spicy hops. Light lingering bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and well carbonated. Somewhat drinkable but I wouldn't want to have a lot of it."
"Pours out a clear amber brew with a one finger head,,nice medium carbonation. Smells of sweet maltiness,,very nice.Taste,is very light. Nowhere near as malty as it smells,,light hopping. Actuallt kinda disappointing, its not bad at all but reminds me of when AB makes specialty beers and they are a shadow of what they truly could be."
"D"
"Overall a pretty good beer, worth having at least once to compare to other steam style brews."
"Very red color with an active had, loads of carbonation. Hoppy taste off the bat, alcohol is present but very malty overtones. Flavorful and filling, I had two of these and was very satisfied. A fine example of a steam amber, similar to Anchor Steam. Another solid one from Flying Dog."
"Amber beer with small head and big bubbles, quickly dissolving to zip. Nose is grainy malt, light hops, and some spicy molasses. Not bad. Flavor is fairly similar. Tastes a lot like a slightly improved Killians. Body is too carbonated, but good in terms of thickness. I dunno, this one was alright. As another reviewer noted, Flying Dog stuff is generally okay, not great beer."
"Pours a deap amber with a 1/2"" of white head, that dosent leave much lacing. The smell is faint, of grains and honey. The taste starts off sweet and goes into an almost paper like dryness, which finishes clean with an average mouthfeel. As with most the flying dog i have tastes, not particularyl impressive, but unoffensive, and drinkable."
"Tastes a lot like Anchor Steam to me, but not as good"
"A rosey copper color brew with a modest off-white head and decent lace. The aroma includes good malt and a bit of brown sugar and wheat. The flavor is a nice mellow caramel malt with a smokey background. A little thin, watery, but not tragically. The malt builds up as you go. A little dry at the finish but drinkability is good. I'm satisfied and would have it again."
"D: Light in weight and light in influence overall."
"Just an average, but tasty, amber lager here. The taste is a bit bland, compared to some craft brews, but I'd take this over Yuengling any day. There's a bit of roasted malt and caramel in the mostly sweet and light malt profile. No real hops to speak of, but I still enjoyed drinking it for what it was."
"D- It is alright. Easy to drink but nothing to good."
"I poured this beer from a bottle to a tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer had a nice amber color with a tan head that decayed rather fast. The beer had a bit of a caramel or sweet smell. Slightly sweet taste also but but not bad at all. The beer was rich tasteing yet still light enough to be refreshing as a summertime brew. I would drink again."
"D: A decent brew that's quite drinkable. I probably won't be seeking it out in the future."
"This brew pours a ruby color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into decent lacing. The aroma is of faint generic caramel malt. This beer smells like dozens of others I have had that are dull, and lacking in character. The taste is very sweet with the same generic caramel as the aroma. The mouthfeel is sugary, and gritty with a high level of carbonation. Overall, I don't like this beer, and will not drink it again."
"Amber pour with little head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma was almost as bland and boring as the taste. Mouthfeel was okay as was drinkability. Not much to say about this one. Not a lot of taste or character but what is has is light caramel and toffee. I have been disappointed with several of the Flying Dog beers."
"It looks great and the taste starts out great. The taste really falls off at the end and is definatly missing something. Not much to the smell either."
"Has a great taste and mouth feel. Sweet malty notes come threw on the palate as well. Hoppy and slightly sour. Nothing to complain about."
"Drinkability: Innocuous and highly drinkable; nice session beer"
"D:It's good but not something I would pick up all that often. I would rather have this from tap at a bar."
"So I am finally working my way through the entire Flying Dog lineup, so that includes going for the mixed twelve pack, which thrilled me to pick up anyways. This poured a deep, dark amber, with a nice burnt reddish hue. nice one inch white head, gave way to a nice coating along the top of the glass. Not really any residual side glass lacing to speak of. Nice carbonation bubbles rippling up through from the bottom of the glass. The smell was very nice, lots of grains and cerals, with a hint of some caramel and a touch of bittering pine hops mixed in. A very light off fruit aroma could also be detected after a few minutes. The taste was very well crafted. A good malted back with a good deal of a hop character mixed in. I did not really detect much of a citrus taste at first, but subsequent sips showed this to be more pronounced then I had thought earlier. Very well balanced beer as no particular taste won out over another. Great feel, decent carbonation, but the feel was very smooth and effortless. A little slick, but not distractingly so, rather easy drinking. I could throw down a six pack of these with no time. Definatly a chugger. Overall this was damn fine, and the first steam beer I have had in quite a while. I will definatly be having another one of these in the near future. This was almost too good to pass up if I saw it. I really enjoyed it!"
"Pretty good brew, but the heat of the alcohol took my out of the brew a little bit."
"Drinkable and pretty tasty, well worth a try"
"Overall this is a fine California Common and another winner from Flying Dog. I don't know why I had been discounting them for so long. I was very, very wrong. They are a great brewery."
"12. oz bottle from their seasonal sampler.... pours a heavy lager smell with a hint of caramel...nice one-finger head that stays atop an attractive amber body--I'm intrigued...then, a rich, heavy lager taste, with an equally heavy mouthfeel.... which one can interpret to mean difficult to swallow...as this beer continues, the presence of malt increases in its unsubtle communication... at bottle's end, only thoughts of light beers keep this amber from earning the dreaded ""nondescript"" title...."
"Drinkability is also good, malt and hop flavors are in the perfect amounts. Recommended as a nice change from a pale ale."
"Pours a clear red amber color with a decent off-white head that dissipated into a small cap, left some nice lacing as I drank it. The smell is of malt and maybe a hint of some type of fruit. Not overly pronounced. The taste is of toasted malt, has a weird rusty metallic twang which I think is a result of the malt-hop balance, not very appealing though not gross. The feel is light and well carbonated, finishes a bit bitter. An easy drinking beer, worth a try though not great."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation. Super easy drinking."
"overall this is a very enjoyable beer, very sessionable and very nice"
"Poured into a pint glass.Nice one finger white head.A very refreshing amber color,clear body.A nice clean smell with some hop aroma in there.Some malt smell but I cant tell what type.The taste is sorda sweet with some bready malts and earthly hop taste.This is my first steam beer and it is ok but nothing I would run out to try again.The carbonation is very easy on the palate.This is a good summer time and session beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Okbeer: Poured a copper color beer with a small foamy head with not much retention but some surprisingly good lacing. Taste of pure malt with some subtle sweet nutty notes. Taste is slightly sweet with some very subtle notes of caramel and nuts. Light body with some low medium carbonation. No hops presence could be easily detected. Overall, this is was not too bad as a session al but not something I would go for very often since it did lack some character."
"Not one of my faves, but I might try it again just to see if this batch wasn't a fluke and b/c I've liked other Flying Dog brews."
"Pleasant brew, nothing spectacular but easily drinkable on a summer day."
"A nice beer, but the bitterness in the flavor (which is hard to differentiate between hops and a smokey character) can be a bit overwhelming. Still a good solid beer with a unique flavor that's worth a try. A bit on the pricey side, however."
"D: Since the beer goes down light and still tastes good, it is very easy to drink all night long."
"This beer pours amber as one might expect. There is minimal head that doesn't leave behind any lacing. Very tame taste without many prevailing adjuncts. This taste is dominated by the malts. Overall pleasant beer, but doesn't stay in memory for very long."
"Good solid stuff here, nothing to really complain about. If you want a malty but well-balanced beer that's not heavy or too alcoholic, here you go."
"The only other 'steam' beer I have had is Anchor. This seems very different from what I remember Anchor being, might have to pick up a 6 of the classic steam beer."
"D- You could drink several... you could, but I won't. If you want a good amber lager, reach for a JW Dundee's or something. I like other things by flying dog, but this one isn't up to par."
"Good Beer - No Shit"
"amber, obviously, in appearance. smell is of caramel malts and a touch of fruity hops. taste is mostly of the malt, dry and crisp finish. almost reminds me of a dry, astringent vienna lager or marzen. minimal hop bitterness. mouthfeel is light. short finish. sessionable due to the abv. pretty much your typical american amber."
"D- yes. I will have another. Another great offering from flying dog. The carmel and nuts do overbalance the other flavors so if you don't like those then you will not like this beer."
"This beer was ok. It seems to be a slight step above a macro lager. I poured it into a pint glass and it had no head retention whatsoever. It was better than most of the other Flying Dog beers that I have tried but overall I was dissappointed with the sampler twelve pack that I bought. With that being said this beer was hardly memorable."
"12oz brown bottle from Florian's. Crystal-clear brick brown-red body with very little head. Roasty malt dominates the aroma with hints of diacetyl, though the aroma is a bit weaker than expected. Flavor has hints of roasty malt and apricot hops. Tastes good, but a bit weaker than expected. No real flaws though. Lighter bodied, and very, very drinkable. Not a bad beer."
"Poured a dark amber with a tight thin head that faded quickly and left no lacing. Unusual aromas of chocolate and malt for the stule wiith something medicinal there as well. The taste is also quite malty with more cocoa notes and a little sour grain. The mouthfeeel is smooth but a little slippery. Not my favorite, the flavors are a little bizarre for me to want another."
"It has characteristics of a lager and an ale. This one is decent, but nothing special, IMO. There is a certain blandness that holds back its drinkablilty a bit, but is fine for an easy drink."
"This is a nice amber lager. It pours a deep reddish brown, decent head that leaves some lacing. The smell is malt, caramel, some sweetness, a little tinny - it smells more like a lager than an ale, but the taste is a bit deceiving. The carbonation in the beer is just about right. The taste is smooth, clean, caramel, slightly malty, not much hop except for maybe a tinge at the end. The aftertaste is subtle. This is a lager that can pass for an ale, except for the smell which gives it away as a lager. Not a bad beer, worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability: Good refreshing lager for the spring/summer/early fall months. The taste gives it a ""novel"" feel while not going too over the top. Worth keeping a six around."
"Drinkability: Good, this beer goes down easy and is pretty crisp and refreshing. A decent lager, but nothing world class."
"Overall, a good beer with solid qualities. Not one that i think i would ever crave for, but is nice. but for the style, i prefer anchor steam."
"Thick and a bit bubbly with a malty bite. A bit ashy/dry. Overall, very malty, has a bite to it. Typical amber. Competent, but not exhilarating."
"Tasted somewhat nutty and buttery and a tinge of that metallic twang. Quite smooth otherwise. More of a session ale than a lager is what I'm thinking here"
"Final Statement: My first California Common is a quite the success. I'm definately planning on buying a sixer of this on the first deck session of the spring. This is a very buttery lager that sits well with me. Nothing mindblowing, but a smooth easy drinking beer with a good flavour."
"D - This one isn't overly complex or intersting, but I may have found a new session brew! Tasty and mild enough to dink all night."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. A nice flavor but nothing amazing."
"Drinkability isn't very high. Lack of flavor, harsh ingredients colide, and not very refreshing. Can't really see the point. Hopefully you enjoy the artwork on the lable."
"Overall, a decent average beer... nothing to write home about. I wouldn't turn down another..."
"A moderately light, bright amber with good retention and some splashes of head retention leads into a moderately malty smell. Hints of spices are present. If this beer were just a bit more bitter and had a slightly more bold mouthfeel, it may be something to rave about but its lacking in those areas hold it back. But just a bit, this is a pleasant brew with good flavor just a bit watered down."
"D - Everything about this brew makes me think of Autumn; the color of falling leaves, harvest smells and flavors."
"Otherwise not bad at all!"
"Its a good beer however theres somethign about it that isn't 'great'"
"Drinkability: The alcohol character and strange aftertaste really hurt this brew for me. Not sure I want to try this again."
"D - Pretty boring beer here, if it were priced as a macro I would prefer it over a macro....but its not...so I don't."
"These are preatty easy to put down though since its a ligher brew with nothing really offensive to it. Not something I'd ever really pick up again, but this would have its merits as a crossover beer."
"pours a nice rich amber color with a one finger off white head and a good lacing to the finish, initial smell is of peach or apricot. taste is sweet fruit and caramel, biscuit malt. mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation but leaves a slick oily feel on the tongue. very easy to drink, smooth and good tasting."
"Drinkability- Overall a subpar beer that isn't worth seeking out again, but maybe I'll try it again someday."
"i knew i was in for a sweet, caramel flavored beer as soon as i uncapped the bottle and caught a bit of the scent. once i poured the beer, the aroma involved the hops, but was still predominantly caramel. the beer had a slight citrus flavor and the hops added to the complexity, giving the flavor some bitterness that balances out some of the sweetness. mild carbonation added to the enjoyment of this beer."
"A bit thick in comparison to other lagers. A good brew nonetheless."
"by volume 5.4%."
"The only thing that keeps this from being a session beer for me is the sweetness, but it's otherwise a very drinkable but not terribly interesting beer."
"D: Overall an enjoyable, but not remarkable beer. Good balance in flavors but not dry enough for my taste. Light enough to be quaffable. I would drink this again if I found it on a beer menu but I doubt I would seek it out specifically."
"The drinkability is pretty good here and I could see myself drinking lots of these at a time. There are better abmer lagers out there though."
"Drinkability: This brew isn't anything spectacular. I'll take Anchor Steam over this in a heartbeat. Snake Dog IPA (the other Flying Dog in my mixed six-pack along with Road Dog) is a better Flying Dog option."
"This beer pours a golden amber with a bubbly off white head and dissipates to a thin film quickly without much lace. The smell is sweet with munich and toasty amber malts. The taste mimicks the smell as well with the toasty maltiness and a little bitterness is aparent without much hop flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, a moderately drinkable beer but not exactly amazing."
"D-I could toss back a couple at a party for sure as macternative."
"D: Tastes a bit like a hopped up bud. Not many dominant flavors in there--they all sort of blend together. Not sure about this offering from Flying Dog--I'd pass if had the chance again."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This beer isn't overly tasty but a satisfying brew none the less. A lager? Most likely not."
" Wavz"
"This beer poured a deep golden color with a nice head that lasted for a while. The smell was slightly sweet and very malty. The taste is malty but balanced with a hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is full and slightly creamy. I think this is a very drinkable beer and goes down very easy."
"D - Decent drinkability. Interesting beer that I think could be improved."
"Old Scratch Amber Lager was amber in color with an off-white head. The head quickly dissipated to almost nothing, leaving no lacing at all. The aroma was fairly light, crystal malt with some hops in the backround. Taste was much the same with the hops being a little more noticeable. It had a fairly dry finish with a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel was thin with a medium carbontion level. Drinkablitly is decent."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a pint glass. Rich amber color. Head was light brown, but very tiny (maybe 1/4""). Lacing disappeared almost instantly, along with the head. Nice blend of malt & hops. Almost nutty taste. Slight aftertaste. Very drinkable beer."
"Purchased: 58 Degrees, Tucson AZ"
"The drinkability is ok. Nothing special, I would not buy this again, It is ok, not bad just not good enough to replace better beers in the line up. MK"
"Old Scratch has a decent taste, but not one that I would want to enjoy over and over again."
"Poured nice dark amber color. Little head which dissapated quickly.Lacing barely exsistent. Slightly fruity odor. Tasted somewhat fruity as well with a mild bitterness to finish. Tad bit watery mouthfeel with low carbonation. Easy to knock back a few at a time. Artwork on bottle is great."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, and crisp sugar cookies sprinkled with brown sugar."
"This is alright. I could easily drink this again, but wouldn't go out my way to find it. Probably would do alright with food."
"D: Meh. Pass."
"Overall: Not a bad amber ale. A bit sweet for my tastes, it would benefit from some hop balance. Poor head, but good mouthfeel this one is really a personal preference thing. After trying it twice, I probably wont try it again."
"This is a nice beer, and easy to drink. Would be easy to finish a 6 pack on a hot summer day. Would be good for a serious drinking session or to serve as a crossover beer. If this was readily available and i felt like having a few on a hot night i'd look for this again sometime."
"M/D: Seems a little off for a lager, but it's a great beer overall. I consider this one of the better brews offered by Flying Dog Brewery."
"An inoffensive beer. Flavors are balanced and mild. Seems a little thin on flavor and mouthfeel, but still drinkable as a session brew."
"This looks to be one of the better amber ale's i've seen. It pours very nicely into a pint glass. Nice amber color w/ a white puffy head that disperses into a ring. The smell is a light hop scent. It tastes fine, w/ a wheatish caramel flavor. It is average to good, I almost went 3.5 on this one. It has a slight bitter aftertaste which was nice, it was crisp. I liked this better than the other flying dog brews that I picked up in a sampler pack and wish there was more than 2 in there of this kind."
"Overall I can drink it, but pretty bland."
"Drinkability: This is easily quaffable because it's unintrusive and uninteresting. I won't be having another."
"Poured from a bottle to a nice amber color with an off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly and had some, but not much, lacing. Amber pour with a white head. Aroma was weak, but what was there appeared to be a malty sweetness, with a hint of coffee. Taste was also not real strong, but was again on the malty side, with a hint of hops balance. Not a bad tasting beer, but a littel on the weak side in all areas. This beer really did not do much for me. Expected more from Flying Dog after their Pale Ale and IPA."
"Overall, it was somewhat drinkable but nothing special."
"Overall, I can't say this beer would be worth anything more then a cursory try out of a mixed pack. You may like it more then I did, but I don't think most people here will."
"This is decent. I have to admit that I'm not a big amber fan, and so the style doesn't grab me to begin with."
"Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass with a deep amber color that lightens to an orange/yellow color towards the bottom. A slight head forms, off white in color, that slowly disappates down the glass, leaving several rings along the side. The sweet scent of malt is strong, almost a candy scent, not alot of hop fragrance. The taste is dominated by the malt, giving it a very mild flavor. The feel of this beer is fairly smooth, a slight after taste but nothing to offensive. This beer is very drinkable, the mild flavor makes it to want chug it down. Overall a good beer, great to just quench your thirst."
"Pours a clear brown/copper color with a quickly fading head. Nose is of hops and roasted malt. Taste is of semi-sweet roasted malts with followed by a citrusy hop bitterness. I personally enjoyed this brew. It actually has more ale characteristics than that of a lager but overall a good drinkable beer."
"D- This beer started with some nice malt qualities but didn't have much to support or balance the flavors. Several flavors were a bit strange and I'm not sure if it was an old bottle or they were just brewing flaws?"
"Coppery appearance, clear and attractive with a yellow tinged head of about 1/4 of an inch after sitting for a half a minute. Laces in dripping rings. Slight maple aroma, tinged with a bright smell of husky hay and hops. Mouthfeel is almost medium, carbonation is lower than I expected and a bit tepid. Very neutral balanced approach to a flavor profile, simple sweet pale caramel malt of not a lot of character with a tinge of citric bittering. Just a slight wax paper impression at the close. Actually, one of my favorite Flaying Dog brews, certainly is pretty easy-drinking."
"This is one good looking amber in my book. I enjoy the color of the beer. It is sort of in between a dark and a light. I got my first Scratch in my Beer of the Month Club and I have been searching for more ever since. This is an easy drinking beer that is tied for first as my favorite beer at the moment. The bad part is trying to find more of the beer where I am located. I would highly recommend any beer from the Flying Dog. I sampled quite of few of their tasty treats at the World Beer Festival in Raliegh, NC in April 2006."
"Freshness date of (I believe) Aug06, pours a somewhat hazy copper amber with a thin whitish head and pretty good streaking lacing. Aroma is decent, foremost the hops and some sweet malt, caramel in character. Not feelin in. Mouth is pretty good, a medium body verging on syrupy, finishing crisp and even dry. And while not the biggest fan of the style, this is a pretty tasty beverage. malts and hop balanced pretty well. The malts take on a pretty neat warming feeling, while citris hops take on nice oily notes. Overall though, overcoming my dislike for most lagers, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"Clear amber color with copper on the sides and a nice medium white head which unfortunately disappears too soon. Decent lacing. Aroma is malty with caramel and a bit of yeastyness I think. Taste is similar. Leans on the malty side. I had no idea this was a steam beer. Helps me understand why it doesn't seem like a lager at all. Slight fruity characteristics and a definitely vienna malt dominance. Decent but it loses everything towards the end. Gets really thin with a cooked veggie taste. Unfortunate. Nothing too special here, tastes like a decent homebrew at best."
"Pretty darn drinkable, even for not being my cup of tea."
"This beer pours a light red tinged with gold and forms a light head with lots of lacing. No big aromas jump out at me, smells malty. Ok, the taste is primarily malty, but the hops are definitely there too. I don't know that I really like the word balanced for this beer... more like there is definitely a malty presence and a hoppy presence and they are fighting, with the malt hitting first and the hop finishing. They aren't fighting in a bad way, though, because this beer goes down easily. There is a light mouthfeel and a dry finish. I wouldn't mind more hop presence in this one, but it's still a good beer."
"Goes down easy, good, not great example of the style"
"This is a pretty good Cali. common. I've tried a few that fell well short. This one is pretty true to the style. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a bright, clear, medium copper with a fairly small head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell is sweet caramel and malts with some rum as well, along with some phenolic alcohol and a touch of hops. Doesn't blend well or appeal to me a great deal. Taste is quite malty at first, with grain and grass clippings along with the caramel hints and fruity notes, and a little hop bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but still crisp, and drinkability is pretty decent. No real complaints, but it's not great."
"Taste is disapointing, booring and weak. Indistinct, stale and unflavorful taste. Too light in flavor, with a ligh mouthfeel, certainly more ale like than lager like, but really indistinct malt profile with a very slight alcohol wash toward the end as there is no malt backbone to hide it. Finishes dry. Balanced only in the sense that nothing stands out in either the malt or the hops. If I didn't know this was Flying Dog, you could have easily convinced me it was a macro beer. Why did they even bother producing this? Extremely dissapointed."
"Overall: Kind of impressed with this beer in spite of not knowing exactly what to expect. I does stand apart from Anchor and some of the commons I've brewed, but not so dissimilar that it breaks style. Perhaps could have a more robust flavor, but I can't complain too much about it."
"Poured a dark amber color with a quickly dissapearing off white head. Aroma is malty, with only a hint of hops, has sort of a macro aroma is one way to put it. Taste is of caramel and a small hint of hops, not much there, seems to be lacking. Medium bodied, pretty smooth. Probably seems to be pretty good for a session but I would argue there are better candidates than this one."
"Pours a tawny amber with a slightly imperfect clarity. Two and a half fingers of dense, off-white foam show good retention and good sticky lacing. Cascade and floral hop aroma, with a faint fruity ester and strong toasted malt scent. Steely caramel flavor, but not unpleasent, and a mild herbal tea taste in the background. Slightly drying american hop aftertaste, with a mild fruity ester and diacetyl character as it warms. The carbonation is low, and the body light to medium. The dryness produced by the hops keeps the ester in check and prevents any noticable slickness. This also provides a fruity/malty finish that will fade and allow a session caliber drinkability. Good overall balance and very enjoyable albiet poor example of the style."
"D- wonderful mix between malts and hops, very unique and very enjoyable. Nice beer to break someone into hops, or to break them from macros. enjoyed this very much"
"Light hazy, peach colored beer with very little in the way of head to it. The beer doesn't have a lot to the smell. Just a sort of earthy, grassy and orange smell. The Beer tastes very orange peel like, faint hints of grass, no real hop character to describe. Not spectacular in the way of complexity, but a good enough beer to have a few of."
"Pours a nice crystal clear amber color. The head foams up nicely at first but then drops to a thin bubbly film. Smell is mildly sweet with nothing else of note. Taste is the same, sweet malt very little bitterness or character. No lingering taste of anything, almost like drinking water. Very thin mouthfeel. I dont' like to slam beers but I see no reason to try this one again. There was nothing bad per se about it but also nothing noteworthy either."
"Mouth feel is watery and actively carbonated. This just seems like another Macro style beer."
"Tastes light and sweet, has a quick bitter punch in the aftertaste and goes sweet again, nice mix. It's light an smooth and very easily drinkable, not too much carbonation. Really nothing preventing a good session. This is such a good style, I'd like to see more of these then I do."
" They are drinkable. I wouldn't turn one down."
"Poured a coppery amber color into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. Thin, and fizzy white one finger head quickly dissipated to very light white lacing. Smells very light, mostly of citrusy hops blended with sweet caramel malt, some roasted grain aroma present as well. Taste is fairly simple, caramel malt flavorings are the base that some lighter hop flavors build on, mainly citrus, nothing too outstanding. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation with a light body, fizzy on the tongue, leaves some bitterness in the aftertaste. Reasonably drinkable beer, just very plain all around, a step up from everyday macro brews. While not a bad beer, simply a little disappointing, knowingly not the best quality that Flying Dog typically offers in the majority of their beers."
"All in all a decent brew; about average. Not something I'd seek out, but not something I'd turn down either."
"Dcould (and did) drink the other two bottles that came in the pack. Got a little tired of the taste by the middle of the third bottle, but still a very good brew that is worth the try."
"An elegant looking beer with a clear amber body that pours gracefully. Old Dog shows enthused carbonation, a deft creamy head, and good lace. My bottle yielded a light, grainy aroma with a late surge of malt sugars and a few unwelcome notes of bandaid. A simple mass-market lager taste is coupled with a grainy bitterness and a lingering finish that could have been cleaner. In fact, its surprisingly bitter for a lager (or steam beer) with flat, drab contours not unlike an English ale."
"Overall, it's ok. Nothing really exceptional here but it's ok to toss back. The store I use has 6.99 sixers from plenty of fine micros so I doubt I'll be going back to this."
"Drinkability is good. The ABV is fairly low and the beer isn't so uninteresting that I immediately felt the need to move on. Not so much on the ""would I buy it again"" scale [though I won't complain if somebody wants to leave a few in my fridge again]."
"Excellent, distinctive artwork, right up there with Lost Coast."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptionally tame brew, with it's thin flavor and aroma barely stimulating the senses. Nothing too far beyond the depth and complexity of a standard macro lager."
"Poured from a bottle into a 12 oz. Pilsner glass. Only about a half finger head that quickly dissipates into a slight haze covering the surface of the beer, lacing is spotty down the glass. Color is a rich amber with nice hints of carbonation dancing within. Aroma....what aroma, very faint to non-existant whiff of water and subdued malts, with possibly some floral hop...to minimal to even judge really. The tast is there, nice grainy malt tones throughout with a little hop in the finish, kind of a metallic tinge to the grainy aftertaste. Not my thing...but 9/10 of the taste is good. The mouthfeel is not horrible but maybe a bit watery. Carbonation is adequate. If you like macro lager you will like this one a lot I would guess."
"Im surprised at the California Steam style, never would have guessed."
"I have to say that this is a pretty good brew and I'll look for this again."
"Despite the sweet lack of balance, I give it high marks for moderate complexity, untold smoothness,and ultimate sessionability. I bet this would be killer on tap."
"D: Carbonation is a bit over the top for this to be very drinkable. Decent."
"As you take the first sip you get sweet light nutty body that is even and smooth. Entire palate is full with a nutty zest that is welcomed. Leaves a camilized hue on the mouth. Overall it is dominated by a very pleasant nutty presence throughout, mouthfeel including. Very drinkable but I'd call thes more of a nut brown ale."
"This is good suds. Poured out to a orange amber color with a good head of about 1/2 inch and rings of lace were present. Medium level of carbonation. Aroma of hops and sweet grains. Taste was really good; flavors of hops, malt, grain and raw veggies blended quite well, and were not overly harsh or abrasive. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and well balanced. Higher level of drinkability, I would imagine this on tap would be exceptional and even better than in the bottle. A good beer for any time of year. Recommended. Special thanks to battlekow for the sample."
"Okay, I got through this weak offering from Flying Dog pretty quickly simply to make it go away. Dull, boring and uninspired. Pass."
"I must have had a different encounter with this beer than most. I poured slowly, as always, into a mug and the result was no head whatsoever. It is a decent looking beer. A nice orange tint. The smell is fairly good. The mouthfeel is ok but nothing to brag about. It seems a bit watered down. The taste on this beer is just plain insufficient. It looks and smells much better than it tastes to me. I would not consider buying this beer again."
"Good for sitting around the pool."
"Drinkability: Certainly a 4 for me. I don't think I'd buy this in the winter or anything, but for summer it seems to be a pretty decent and very drinkable session brew."
"A pleasing beer. I am not a big steam beer fan but this seems to be an ok example of the steam style."
"I don't know man. This is a pretty boring brew even for a typically watered style of steam beer or california common. I think this is a style problem more than it is this beer. It pours a copper/amber color. the head is apologetic but it does have a ring lacing with each pull. Malts make up the jist of this beer, hints of caramel, hops are an afterthought, a very odd woody taste approaches the end of this brew that is annoying as hell...never had much success with this brewery and this is another example....overall very forgettable. Very mild in every category. better than the BMC? not really."
"poured a medium copper color with tannish head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is extremely light with maybe a hint of malt present. Taste is caramel and malt, but neither is very strong. Good ending with a fruity dryness that is pleasant to the palate. Good beer to try."
"Drinkabilty - Very drinkable, goes well with food and goes down easy. Low abv keeps it that way."
"Amber in colour with pleanty of carbonation. Loads of caramel malt aroma with this one, along with a hint of roasted grain. The flavors were generally smooth and malty, with subtle notes of herbal hops, roasted grains, and a very mild fruitiness. Far better than I expected. Probably one of the better offerings from Flying Dog that I've had."
"Drinkability: It was a tasty brew with some nice flavors again with a strong ale taste and high in alchol content."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours an amber/orange with a thin semi-fizzy off-white head that doesn't leave lacing. Smells of caramel and spicy hops. There is a cloying sweetness with some bitterness from the green/spicy hops but there isn't much else except perhaps a hint of coffee at the end. The body is a little tingly and the body is medium to heavy for a lager. I really couldn't drink too much of this because of how sweet it is."
"Drinkability is about average and definitely of from a style standpoint. Not a bad beer just a very fruity-like ale brew."
"Appearance is a cloudy reddish color with some beige foam and sticky lace. There are some mildly clove or ester scented hops in the aroma, followed by citrus/fruity hops and roasted malt. A little thin and too much like a nut brown ale for me. And there is too much carbonation. Supposed to be a lager? The alcohol asserts itself and dominates. It is too thin for an ale, but too strong for a lager."
"Pours a golden amber colour, with wispy white lacing. Slightly sweet, but very little else. Thin and watery. A little toasty character and slight hop flavour. Some diacetyl too. Overall, ok on drinkability. Better than the mainstream lager, but won't have again."
"A very enjoyable amber lager. I am typically not a fan of these beers because of their cloying sweetness with little complexity. Old scratch pours copper to golden like a pale ale. Smells malty caramelly, toasty, toffee, mildly herbal, nicely hopped. Taste is much like aroma. Slightly doughy, creamy, crisp and refreshing-moreso than most ambers. Clean finish. A very easy drinking beer."
"I'm reviewing this simultaneously with Anchor Steam Beer to compare. It matches up pretty well with the old sea dog, just a bit off in every regard. It's the same great amber color of Anchor Steam, but is a little clearer and has a puny head. Just looks like less of a beer. Smells and tastes a little sweeter and sharper than the AS; at the same time, it's also more bitter. Mouthfeel is thinner, more watery. Not bad, though."
"Glorious....thats the only way for a malt head to describe this wonderful creamy, malty complex concoction. Poured a deep orange-amber in the glass with an off white rocky cap and good lacing, moderate carbonation allows the flavors to charge through. Aromas are sweet caramel malts with slight fruitish-cider tones. The taste is very malt biased with the sweet caramel/biscuit malts float on a creamy mouth feel...woody, herbal, slightly tangy hops show in the middle and long wet finish. A very tasty and enjoyable lager with some malt characteristics of a Vienna and a creamy delivery...great stuff."
"Pours translucent crimson with a lot of carbonation at first but no head. Not much lacing. Smells include some nice roasted hops, citrus notes, a small bit of wheat, and alcohol. Taste is mainly light wheats and some punchy hops with citrus. Rather light bodied, a good session beer. It leaves residual bitterness and alcoholness in your mouth though."
"All and all a very refreshing and clean tasteing beer but not at all what I had expected from it. This had, to me, the least body of any of the Flying Dog beers I've tried. It is a good beer and is worth a try, but I just wasn't impressed."
"It's overall pretty good. It's a well balanced brew with few surprises. Certainly not the worst, but is probably on the lower end of Flying Dog's line. I'd drink it again."
"Overall, I think I prefer this to Anchor Steam, and would consider it a fairly good, uncomplicated beer to introduce someone to craft beers. More like a lager than a lot of micros, but high-enough quality that I would feel pretty decent about recommending it."
"Drikability was average. I can't see buying this again, but then, even though I liked Anchor Steam, I'm more inclined to buy Liberty Ale for more flavors."
"I don't know if I'd have many more of these."
"Amber colored with a white head that stays around the glass untill the end. Smells slighty hoppy and has a lond of roasted malt aroma. Taste like sweet roasted malts up front and is balanced by a spicy hop. Has a smooth body and a great drinkabilty. A tasty lager and should be a regular for me."
"Medium bodied to the light side, it's ok but nothing special."
"looks like and amber, smells like and amber, tastes like and amber. solid brew, slight carmel like malt tradin shots with some mild hop tones. medium bodied, def. drinkable. not a whole lot to say, just a pretty good stab at the style...cost effective too."
"Poured a beautiful amber color, with a rather impressive head that stayed around for a while. I'm not used to lagers, so I'll have to review this one as best as I can. Had a very light taste, could taste the light hops. A light malt, that was less prevalent than the hops, some fruit, kind of a mild apple taste to it. One of the better lagers I've had thus far."
"This might not be the best amber out there, but it went down smooth. While I wouldn't go out of my way to buy, I wouldn't turn one down if offered..."
"Pours out amber amber amber with a small bright white headskie. Tastes nice and crispy hopped with a decent malted balance. Mouthfeel is smoothm but nothing special. A very decent beer, but not a great beer. Solid drinkability. Amoung the better of the Flying Dog brews."
"Body is thin."
"Very light copper color, with a moderate creamy tan head. Smell is grassy and musty, slightly skunky. Taste is malt dominated, grassy and skunky, not very good, leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Is this a California Common/Steam beer? WHo know or cares. Eych, another lackluster beer from Flying Dog."
"Not a bad beer really, but not something I'll be looking for on shopping trips."
"If floral hopped lagers are your thing, you will be right at home with Old Scratch Amber Lager from flying Dog Brewery."
"I think this beer is underrated. It is a hybrid beer and it definitely has both Ale and Lager characteristics, but it leans more towards an ale .It pours a medium amber color and has a thin white head .It smells malty and yeasty... pretty inviting to me. The flavor is interesting. It is a it schizophrenic, but it is supposed to be. Is it a lager or is it an ale? Is it really a steam beer? Who cares? It is a good beer and worthy of companionship on a worthy evening."
"12 oz bottle obtained from Westminster Liquor (Colorado) in Jan 2005 and consumed that same evening. Review from notes. Poured hard to generate a 1.5 finger light beige head over a slightly coudy light brown (or light rust) liquid. Smooth clean smell. Nice penetrating caramel with some toffee (remniscent of tamarind) and some faint hop. Taste caramel sweet. Fruity, despite being a lager. The frutis are mild and consist of orange playing off of tangerine. A very sutle Vienna malt (maybe even Biscuit) flavor. Good carbonation, which allows the malt sweet to hang around a bit. A bit too sugary for my tastes, but okay all around. Moderate lacing and medium light bodied."
"ng"
"Not a bad beer, but there's nothing really noteworthy about it either. If it's the best choice around, I'd go for it, but that's pretty much the only reason to buy this."
"The taste is mostly malt. True to the smell, there is a (very) slight sourness to this brew. The hop does show up, but only as a harmonic interlude. The beer is above average in body. Not my favorite beer from Flying Dog."
"Overall impression: An interesting lager - but not one I'd seek out again."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a big fluffy head thats sticks well down the glass,quite a dose of citruisy hop in the nose along with a toasted grain not I pick up a touch of caramel as well.Quite a hoppy flavor up front citruisy and piney,get like a brown suger flavor coming thru big late an in the finish.Hey a well rounded lager with enough hops to make it somewhat interesting,much better than I thought it would be"
"Got two in the sampler pack...don't know what I'll do with the other..."
"Drinkability: A decent thirst quencher, but left me wanting more substance than this."
"Pours an amber color (duh) with a small white head that quickly falls away to nothing and leaves almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and floral - some sort of hops there, but I don't know what kind. The flavor is slightly hoppy and has a sweetness with a caramel malt flavor. The drinkability on this one is fine, but it didn't seem all that special to me."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Orange to amber color with a weak head that dissipates quickly. The nose is essentially nil on this beer. Some faint caramel malt scents, but even that might be a stretch. The flavor is a bit sour with notes of carmel malts. There is also a light tanginess and perhaps a citrus flavor. The beer is sharply carbonated and and it distracts from what little flavor may be there."
"The first taste is of caramel malt. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. I can detect a faint hint of hoppy afterbite that lingers in the aftertaste. This is a light bodied lager with a pleasant taste. I could put away a few of these fairly quick. However, it's nothing to get excited about. It was pleasant, but nothing about it stood out as being great in my opinion. This is just your average microbrewed lager. If you're looking for a decent lager there are plenty of other beers that are just as good plus a whole lot cheaper. (like Yuengling or Shiner Bock) This isn't something I'll go out looking for, but I'd drink it again(for free or very cheap)"
"Rather rich in taste, one or two in a sitting would be plenty for me."
"pours a nice amber colour with a fairly large and mildly sticky head. pretty good stuff thusfar. the smell is slightly above average: malt, some grain and a touch of sweetness. the hop/malt balance is much more even in the flavour (as hops couldn't even really be detected in the smell). there' a slight toasted bread flavour mixed in along with a touch of caramel before a moderate hop-bite finish. i would have liked this one to be a bit bigger-feeling, but overall it's a fiarly tasty brew that could be spruced up a bit, but is by no means offensive. a tad boring but tasty nonetheless."
"This reddish lager did not pour much of a head. The smell was good, of carmelized malts. The taste was interesting, a nice blend of the carmel malts and a bit of a hop finish to make it interesting. I thought this was a bit thin but overall this is an easy drinking beer. The Flying Dog line seems to be made for summer!"
"A very ""flat"" beer all-around. The taste is nothing impressive. The hops and malts are there. But not much that tantlaizes the tongue. The aroma is of malts (I'm assuming that's the amber aspect). There are hints of toffee in and around the beer, but nothing that makes this beer stand out to me. It poured the color of mud with no head and no lace."
"A very drinkable beer and a solid version true to the style. No surprises here yet no disappointments either."
"Drinkability - not a bad beer at all, it's got its ups and downs. Had to visit Old Scratch at least once, it was worth the money."
"Light bodied and goes down okay. A good beer, but not the best that Flying Dog has to offer."
"Pours out a fine clear amber colour, smallish head that recedes to a ring. At first the aroma reminds me of scotch, and piques my interest. Sweet malt on the next pass, with an odd sourness as well that doesn't quite detract, ripe fruit, and then leafy hops. It smells like Autumn damnit! In the flavour is an odd balance of sweet caramel malts and citric hops, and a curious sourness from the hops as well in the form of a lemon rind tartness. Perhaps the latter is influenced by the yeast. Full mouthfeel that blankets the palate, rich texture. It's definitely not the best sample of the Flying Dog line I've been able to try yet, but the scotch/fall equinox nose and seductive mouthfeel make this a curiosity that I'll probably revisit again, just to see if those two show up to the next party. If not then I'd probably cross Old Scratch from my dance card in favour of better endowed prospects."
"Fying Dog's Old Scratch displays a crystal clear copper body with a reddish cast beneath a good-sized head of ivory foam that holds well and leaves some nice splashes of lace about the glass. The nose combines a delicately sweet and subtly caramelish, toasty maltiness with a nice touch of yeasty fruitiness. It's lightly crisp and then smooth in the mouth with a medium body and carbonation. The flavor reveals a richer maltiness than the nose suggests with some Munich or Vienna malts, and probably a good dose of crystal/caramel as well. Grassy and leafy hops become apparent towards the swallow along with a very nice fruitiness (strawberries, sweet apple, pear); and it finishes lightly sweet and lingering but never cloying - there's just enough bitterness there to keep it from going out of bounds. Well done!"
"What a lovely surprise, expecting a bland mushy lager and ending up with a juicy, tart, and savory steam beer. Would definitely pick this one up again."
"Despite my blah review I think this makes for a nice social beer, where there is less empahsis on ""thinking"" about what you're drinking and just drinking a beer."
"this has a nice amber copper color. the head is good, not as fizzy as their others. a thin layer of lace. taste is pretty light and simple. mostly thin watery sweet alcohol taste. not their best beer, but it came in a sampler, so i didn't lose out too bad."
"Pours a deep amber color, nice. Very little head and little, if no, lace lingering. The aroma is somewhat fruity, cherry-like, maybe. The taste is good, not exceptional, but good. There is that fruity taste and a small but apparent hop taste that lingers on the roof of the mouth. The beer finishes even and smooth. This is a good beer and one that I would definitely drink any time."
"Bitter hops great the tongue followed by some sweetness from the malts, finishing all bitter. Not enjoyable."
"I was actually a bit surprised by this beer. I hadnt been impressed by most of the flying dog series, but this well its nothing special, but as it warms it actually becomes a nice simple tasty session beer. I'd try this again if I got it in a mixed pack."
"overall, this is what I would call a good lawn-mower beer. Great on an extremely hot day when you need a thirst quencher, but lacking in substance."
"Beer is always good. Happy beering."
"T: This beer has no soul. Very cool label but nothing but water in the bottle. Not recommended."
"To sum up this beer. ""Eh? While it looks quite good with a white head on a brilliantly colored amber body - there's little of substance to the beer. The grain and grass aroma was sub par, and the flavors less impressive. It was an uninteresting blend of grassy notes and lager yeast flavors. I will avoid this beer in the future."
"Caramel, mild apple, cereal grain aroma. Light tan colored head fades quickly to a film leaves a small scattering of lace. Orangish amber colored beer is pretty transparent. Mouthfeel is a bit light and slightly cloying. Malty sweet flavor with a bit of caramel, not much in the finish. Not bad, but nothing really great about it."
"If they cleaned up the ferment, this would be much better. The higher alcohols and diacetyl hurt it's drinkability and give me a headache, but I enjoy the mellow sweetness in the finish. Nothing I would seek out."
"This one surprised me. Easliy my favorite of the Flying Dog line that I've tasted, it has plenty of flavor, with some sass and some sauce thrown in for good measure. The malt profile is round and warm, and it combines with the understated hops to bring a tasty blend to the table. For my money it drinks well and capably. I'd never say no to one, and might even actively look for it. Amid some damned stiff competition, that's pretty decent praise."
"This isn't a great beer but isn't bad either. I'd rather have an Anchor, but if a friend had a 6er of this I could share it."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a half inch tall light tan colored head. The brew is orangey-amber in hue, and has an aroma of sweet malt with a tinge of hops. Taste is of malt, possibly some caramel smoothing the mouthfeel, and only slight bitterness. A slight tinge of citrus seems to pop up as well. The flavor profile seems skewed in the grain direction, but that's acceptable for an amber in my book, and helps the drinkability quite a bit."
"I haven't been impressed with Flying Dog in the past and Old Scratch Amber Lager does nothing to change that. If the brewery put as much effort into their beer as they put into their labels, they might end up with something a little better than merely decent."
"This beer is an amber colored brew, with a small white head on the top. Slight maltiness to the scent, nothing overwhelming. Clean lager taste, malty with a good hop contrast. I can see where they wanted to go, but the taste comes out too thin. Thin mouthfeel. This one is probably worth skipping."
"-Oelergud"
"Very drinkable, just not up too what it tries to mimic."
"A good CA Common, though it isn't my favorite of the style. Copperish amber color with a feeble, transient head that seems to be a trademark of this brewery. Smell is syrupy malt backed up by a crisp, citrusy hops aroma. Taste is nice and crisp if a little simple. Sweet at first, the taste gets dry real quick with an abundance of astringent citrus and hop notes. A graininess lingers on. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability is good, as is the case with most CA Commons I've had. I like it but...are we sure this brewery isn't an extension of Coors or Bud? Some of their beer is well made, but lacks any special qualities. This is a one time purchase and I'll be picking up Anchor Steam if I want this style again."
"The mouthfeel is smooth. Carbonation levels were perfect. The malt and bitterness quickly leaves the tongue after swallowing. Very drinkable. Good session beer."
"highly drinkable beer..its an easy quaffer."
"This beer poured out a very bright copper/amber color and was topped off with a thin head of foam that left small lacing on the glass. The aroma gave off something like sweet bananas and sweet caramel malt.The flavor is semi-sweet with caramel notes and is very pleasant on the whole. This is a medium bodied beer with some interesting flavors and a decent malt body. Bitter clean in the finish. A very pleasant and flavorful lager beer."
"Per FD website: Original Gravity: 13.3Plato, Specific Gravity: 1.053, Alcohol by Volume: 5.4%"
"Pours a clear amber with a head that quickly falls to a thin layer of foam. Lots of bubbles rising to the top. Smells caramel malt and citrusy hops. Tastes ok sweet and tart nothing really jumps out and grabs you. Light to medium brew that tingles the tounge with carbonation adding a little bite to the hops. Not a bad beer but not one I would seek out in the future either."
"Solid clearish amber color, gained a medium off-white head that fades fast to a skim on top and ink blot lacing. Smell is faint of sweet malts, a touch of dulled citrus, melon husk and grape skins. Taste has a grainy, somewhat raw and strangly textured malts, semi sweet, dulled citrus, and lightly roasted, dry, crispy, mildly flavored, not in a watery way, more of weakened effort then anyhthing. Feel is about medium with a very average drinkability. Plain, a bit boring, an average amber."
"Poured a copper color with a semi thin head that stayed with the whole glass. Better than average lace. Aroma is not powerful. Slightly malty, less hops, a tad of fruit and citrus. Its taste is malty with slight fruit, and light hops. Could stand to be a bit more hoppy, but not too much. This is a medium bodied lager, not very complex but tasty and very drinkable. A card playing kind of a brew. This would be a good choice to introduce to a AB drinker to try and show them the world of beer beyond Bud."
"This is a smooth, medium bodied, easy to drink brew."
"Zum wohl!"
"The mouthfeel is a little oily and tangy for me. It is smooth and this is a refreshing lager. Very nice medium bodied beer. I would drink another despite the tangy mouthfeel."
"This tasted a lot like the the Dunkles I had at Gordon Biersch, but it's a bit better as it has more flavor. It's basically your typical dark lager flavors with just a little more character, probably coming from the steam-style brewing. Of course, that's why Anchor Steam is good for a lager, so it's no surprise."
"When I had my first one, I had my doubts, but this 2nd bottle that I've reviewed seems to be a lot better. Not a bad representation of such a unique beer, and another rare Flying Dog I'd seek out again."
"Comments  Its tough to pull off the even hop/malt flavoring and retain smoothness, but Flying Dog did a good job of it here."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:When poured into my glass, this beer had a small sized tan head that contained fine sized bubbles that fully dissipated.The body was clear with no carbonation.The hue was amber and the nose was lightly hoppy and malty and fruity.The flavor was bitter with a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth and light-medium bodied.This beer tasted more like a Pale Ale in my opinion."
"Dark amber color. Head is off white and foamy. Aroma is fruity and slightly sweet. A medium bodied ""steam"" beer. Malts are very smooth and sweet, nutty and soft. Hops are a touch citrusy. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Crystal clear amber tone with a full inch of foam sitting on top of the body leaving scattered webs of lacing around my pint. Aroma has some zesty lemony tones along with a mild sweetness and caramel malt tones to it very nice aroma pleasant and appeasing to the senses. Flavor has a bit of an alcohol edge to it then a wave of hop bitterness blended with a sharp sweetness created from the malt and mild fruit tones also arise in the finish. Crisp with a nice hop profile that does compare to Anchor Steam on tap however the bottles never seem to travel well from San Fran but I can compare this to the draught version. Mouthfeel from a light to medium bodied beer is slightly syrupy texture with a sharp carbonation to tickle the palate nice. Drinkability not dying for another could easily consume this amber lager purely due to the fact that it does have a really nice flavor profile."
"Medium amber color with a light cream colored head. 1/2"" head quickly fades to a thin layer of foam but leaves a fair amount of lacing behind as you quaff. Mild aroma is lightly sweet with some grassy undertones. Taste is fruity and rather light, with a mild amount of caramel being swept up by some lemon grass hop flavors. Fairly clean finish, but there is a lingering battle between sweetness and bitterness on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, as with over 5% I'd expect a bit of body. Drinkability is OK, but the dichotomy of flavor in the aftertaste wears on me a bit. Almost poured 2 bottles into my larger 1L glass. Glad I didn't, as 12 ounces is enough of this for one night."
"This beer pours as the name that it was given, a nice amber color. It gave off a thick head, which left a sticky lace to the end of the glass. Very nice! The aroma was mostly malt and some caramel tones are noted. Nothing overpowering with the aroma. The taste was very nice, a straight shot of malt with the caramel notes mixed in giving it a bit of sweetness to the flavor but the hops came in at the end to give it a slightly bitter finish. Over all a nice brew, light body and very drinkable this is the first from the flying dog that I enjoyed!"
"The beer pours just as it's name calls for, ""amber"". There is little head, but a nice thin lace. The aroma is of a traditional lager, but with the addition of caramel malts giving it a amber color and aroma. I'm not a particular fan of lager beer due to the fact that most are so simplistic in make up. They hardly ever meander from the regular. The taste is good. I like the amber lagers better than a plain. I guess it must be that there is some malt character although it's still not much. The mouthfeel is good; a low bodied beer. A real booser's beer. A clean finish marks the end of this beer. Not bad, as far as lagers are concerned."
"Pours a brownish copper color with a foamy off-white colored head that soon settles into a good amount of lace. Nose is toasted malts and caramel with a touch of fresh bread. Taste is sweet malts followed by notes of doughy yeasts and some citrusy hop oils. A smooth and easy-drinking brew. Not a bad choice for a session beer. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Nice brew, easy enough to drink, and a fine taste."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark amber, with a small head the quickly receded. Leaves bits of lace on the glass. The aroma of roasted malt is present, but no real hop aroma. You can taste the malt and it has a subtle hint of hops with a smooth finish Good carbonation. This is a good session beer"
"This good amber gets better on draft, but that is what you would expect. A great session beer and a great offering from Flying Dog."
"Pours a nice amber color with a thin soapy head. A faint, distant smell of fresh fruit and some hops, tough to detect. Very thin body, some hops and fruit to be noted, has a decent warming feeling. Just a thin and bland beer, not too many qualities, not one of the better Flying Dog brews."
"Amber in color, perfectly clear. Nice head, but fades quickly. Hops and caramel malt tickle the nose. Taste is subdued, malty on the finish. Mouthfeel is much more interesting - carbonation hitting here and there all over the tongue. Very drinkable, but boring."
"This was a real surprise. The pour created a cloudy amber look with a head that couldn't make it up to a finger even with much coaxing and teasing. The tan head retreated quickly and became a thin film that left small bits of lace. The nose was heavily malty with nary a trace of hops. Lots of grainy richness and bready notes. Yeasty. Not sweet, but not bitter either. Fairly dry tasting throughout with a substantial body that is not filling. Substantial residual tan oily residue."
"Clear amber color, not too much head which dissapated rather quickly. I agree that this tastes like some form of a hybrid beer. Lager body, with some of the tartness and bitterness of an ale. I'm not quite sure how the brewer is calling this a ""Steam Style"" beer. Nothing about this reminds me of a steam beer. I'm guessing that the label art sells the beer. The art is quite good, but the beer is mediocre."
"It's amber with a brown tinge and little head. A metallic smell underlays the smell of butterscotch, making for a not completely pleasing combination of smells. The taste isn't much better. It's pretty bland with just enough going on to keep drinking it in the hope it comes together at some point. Unfortunately, it never really does. The Flying Dog stuff just doesn't really cut it."
"It's a clear amber color with hardly any head at all. The aroma is pleasant caramel maltiness. Caramel malts are pretty much the entire flavor as well, with a dry slightly hoppy finish. I find more of a toasty flavor in there as it warms. I enjoyed it, nothing exciting though."
"Pours to an amber color with a big tan head. Leaves a bit of lacing when sipped down. The aroma was of sweet caramel malts, a bit of grain, and a slight fruitiness. The flavor had the sweet caramel maltiness with a fruity hop flavor. It was light-medium bodied beer, with a medium level of carbonation. It finished semi-dry and bitter. This was my second sampling out of their mix pack; overall it was a smooth, easy drinking beer."
"This brew pours a nice, clear burnt-orange amber with an off-white head that reduces to a cap but leaves lace rings nevertheless. The smell is of buttery toffee and tea-like hops. Light-medium bodied mouthfeel. The taste is of caramel malt with a nice dose of herbal/tea and mildly citrus hops and some fruity esters in the background. Unfortunately, a fair amount of diacetyl comes through in mid-palate. I guess this was done on purpose, but it seems wholely out of place...even for a California Common style brew. Fruitiness transforms into a somewhat dry/crisp finish which gives away its ""steam"" ale/lager heritage."
"Orangey-amber hue, whitish head, ½ a fingers worth, decent retention, pretty good lace. Rather fragrant bouquet, plenty of malt, hints of fruit, sweet caramel comes through as well. Surprisingly nutty taste, buttery, hints of tree-bark, malty citrusy hops create the backdrop. Odd palate. Slightly sticky, yet bitter finish, not very dry. I cant tell if Old Scratch is attempting to expand the realm of what is an Amber-Lager or they have failed miserably at brewing an Amber-Lager. I tilt towards the latter. I dont find this beer very impressive at all. Id skip this one"
"Great label, shame about the beer  albeit strange, it is just pretty average for me."
"The beer pours a sparklingly clear deep amber color with a noble in size head that is creamy in consistency, the color a light tan with the lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Nose is malt and slightly sweet with the start sweet and the malt profile fair to middling, top is light. Finish is sparingly acidic with the hops subdued and the aftertaste quite dry."
"clear amber color.  thin head and lace.  toasted malt nose with some flowery hops.  pretty full mouthfeel, very round and smooth...almost buttery....and then a lager crispness in the end...this leads to lingering ale like flavors on the tongue. lots of sweet caramel malt and oily hops make it very un-lagerish. a very interesting, if not schizophrenic brew, and one i found rather refreshing and fun to drink because there is stuff going on not normally associated with lagers.  i'd like to try more steam beers to get a better understanding of the style."
"Clear amber in color.  Posseses a thin and dense off-white head that is well retained.  Leaves some nicely ringed lace.   Nice caramel malt aroma with brown sugar mixed in.   Pretty clean tasting.  Caramel maltiness is the main player.  But there is also some spiciness and dryness added by the hops. A little better than average if that."
"Dark orange in color...a little lace...I get caramel maltiness on the nose, but it is very soft...the taste is of light caramel...a touch of ale like fruitiness....I guess this is a steam beer with lager yeast used at ale temperatures...it's decent...finishes dry surprisingly enough..just a little too tart on the finish for an amber lager, but it is definitely interesting..."
"Initially this brew pours with a nice deep amber-orange color.  The delicate lace sticks around for a little while.  The aroma is very lightly malty.  Overall the flavor is quite light as is the body.  Slightly sweet maltgives way to a light, but sharp bitterness that disappears with a crisp finish."
"This is the last of a sixer I bought 3 or 4 weeks ago. The 1st was the best, this is noticeably different. Definitely amber, approaching dark side of the spectrum, so they got that right. Head fizzled out and mouthfeel is flat but at the beginning I remember it being fine. Strong piney hops which are the appeal of this beer, giving it a unique character balanced by forceful caramel, buttery malts. Like others have noticed, some ale flavors. This is a good beer, filling and crisp, and it's changed my opinion of Flying Dog after I sampled their unpleasant yogurt-tasting Scotch ale a couple years back."
"Dark copper in hue w/ brilliant clarity, topped by a one fingered persistent off white head.  Attractive lace is left.  The aroma is a combination of medium caramel malt and resiny citrusy hops, with a hint of sweet fruity esters. Biscuit notes become discernible as the brew warms.  The flavor profile is clean overall and consists of dominant caramel sweetess and bready malt, with mild hop bitterness providing adequate contrast.  Lightly bodied, but with a mouthfeel that's oddly slick and oily (See Portland Woodstock IPA) Finishes with caramel sweetness and more of the oily, tongue coating sensation lingering.  Flavorwise, this is an enjoyable California Common / Steam (lager yeast fermented at ale temps) but the oily mouthfeel and finish was a bit offputting."
"Notes: A pretty good brew, very flavourful but seems to have some ale qualities and finishes like an ale also with stronger than normal alcohol qualities."
"Copper colored with a lightly toasted malt aroma. Good balance of subdued sweetness and spicey hop flavors. Pretty decent amber lager, although I would pick several others ahead of Flying Dog, namely Wagner, Saranac, SA Boston Lager, etc. Too bad many more worthy micros don't have the distribution resources that FD seems to."
"Well the old doggie got me again, I had it in my head these beers would be lousy, but I really, really liked this one as well. Did I get an IPA in an amber lager bottle ? Nice copper color, big fluffy head with tiny hop bubbles coming through. Lots of hop smells and some slight sweetness. The taste is pleasantly hoppy, with an equal balance of malty sweetness. Unbelievably pleasant and drinkable, just the right body, balance, hops, and carmel sweetness. I must have got the best of the batch, this stuff was really tasty. Despite my doubts, this brewery is 3 for 3 with me. Just goes to show how many great beers are available, if you just look a little.  I will buy it again."
"Cloudy bronze in color with a rather full white head initially, fades fairly quickly, decent amount of sticky lace.  Potent hops dominate the aroma, also slight fruit notes.  Flavor is quite distinct, strong hops initially, with underlying tangy citrus flavors, then roasted malt and more hops towards the finish.  A complex and satisfying beer."
"Other than that ... this is a pretty decent and drinkable beer."
"Great appearance.  Nice bronze color in the glass, and held to the light takes on a ruby glow.  Not sure I would classify it as a bock.  The bottle calls it an amber lager - seems more in line with a Vienna amber (i.e. Dos Equis).  Solid malt with nice hops balance.  A bit more alcohol kick at the finish than average.  Tasty and quite drinkable."
