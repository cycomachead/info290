Nordeast isn't the best tasting beer in the market, but for the price it is very difficult to find beers that can compare in drinkability and refreshness. It's my go to beer both in the winter and summer and will continue to be my first choice for reasonable priced beer. Look is what one expects from amber lager. Smell is a good balance of malt and wheat and a sample of honey. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. This beer can be drank all day and should be the go to beer for any trip to Minnesota; especially on a budget.","ANiklaus","Jul 25, 2014"

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty dark amber with a thin off-white head that leaves a good amount of sticky lacing when sipped. Not much of a smell actually, just some malt and floral. The taste is lightly sweet upfront but isn't over done at all with a little dry finish from the malt. Just the right amount of carbonation and a very easy drinking brew. Has a clean crisp taste that is very enjoyable! Really like this one.","BeerWithMike","May 10, 2014"

This is not one of those craft beers so I see why people would not go nuts over something like this but at the same time I can see why it is so successful. Its a beer that can be enjoyed by all, no off putting flavors or bad aftertastes or anything like this. I've been told this is a beer that is indicative of the Schell lagers and if that is the case I will have to try some. This beer would satisfy most drinkers in my opinion but would be a real treat for someone like myself who typically drinks domestic beers like Miller or Yuengling. A terrific beer.","bullwinkle88","Beers"

Aroma was beery and a bit of malt. Flavor was mainly sweet with a little malt thrown in. Body and carbonation were ok. Finish was like flavor. Fairly shallow overall.

Overall, there are a number of good things going on in this beer. Unfortunately, there are a few bad things going on too, and they stand in the way of the good things becoming really good things.

4.15,19.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"definitely recommended. good stuff.","budgood1","May 18, 2010"
3.13,-9.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Nothing special, not bad at all though. Haven't had regular Grain Belt in awhile, so I'm not sure if I prefer this to the original.","herman77","May 17, 2010"
3.6,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Grain Belt Nordeast is surprisingly good. In fact, I'd choose it over every pale or amber lager of the old school sort... except for the outstanding Schlitz Gusto. When's the next cookout?","BuckeyeNation","May 15, 2010"
3.51,1.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4," Light to medium bodied, has some lingering flavor. It's a drinkable beer, and good for a hot summer day while mowing the lawn. Not something I would drink on a daily basis, but overall decent.","WYVYRN527","May 05, 2010"
4.3,23.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste is also sweet and bready malts with some hops. Starts mildly sweet, and there is a bit of bitter hops at the finish. Light to medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and a bit of a dry finish. Very drinkable, and very good.","hardy008","May 02, 2010"
3.25,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"August Schell Grain Belt Nordeast pours a finger of creamy foam over a clear deep amber brew. Carbonation is strong and steady, and the nose is adjunct lager all the way- sweet corn, lager yeast, maybe a little fruitiness. Flavor is more of that corn sweetness, that fruit note again (apple skin maybe), and just a little bit of some kind of herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This actually seems a lot like a darker version of another Schell product, their Lakemaid beer. They're both corn lagers with a taste of real hops, something like training wheels, almost...","shadow1961","May 01, 2010"
3.51,1.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Nordeast, but it is an easy drinking beer that I prefer over the standard Grain Belt. GB is a little too sweet/malt liquor tasting to me, Nordeast reminds me more of Sam Adams Light. Not super flavorful, but an easy drinker and good session beer.","Mdog","Apr 24, 2010"
3.97,14.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"M/D - Another enjoyable brew from New Elm. Not quite a medium bodied brew, light and very easy to drink more than one. I recommend this brew if it is still around. I brought this brew to DarkLord day and had some good reviews from others outside of Minnesota","FreshmanPour77","Apr 19, 2010"
2.52,-27.4,4,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Great amber orange color with a trillion miniature carbonation bubbles zipping forever upward, no lacing, but surprisingly decent head retention. Ugh, this smell is awful. Smells like a dirty old penny, very metallic, with a touch of grainy notes in the background. Taste is incredibly light, barely anything going on there. There are some very soft flavors of caramel and bread, but not much, metallic, and the hops are non-existent. How dare they put the Grain Belt name on this beer?! Sorry Schell's, but this is not very good at all.","KeefD","Apr 13, 2010"
2.71,-21.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Was expecting something a little different at first, but the more I thought about it, this is pretty much what I should have expected. Not bad, but nothing special.","Mistofminn","Apr 13, 2010"
3.78,8.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Have you ever thought Grain Belt was too sweet to enjoy, but you like everything else? This is your beer. Please forgive the short review. I'll review Grain Belt another time. When I do, just add ""not as sweet as Premium"" to the review, and you'll have my brilliant review for this.","hodgsongreg","Apr 11, 2010"
3.61,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"As is, this is one heck of a sessionable brew to have a bunch of when in the need of a good outside/grilling, BBQing, lawn mowing, fishing, yard working, sit back and enjoy the day away kind of beer.","tavernjef","Apr 11, 2010"
4.3,23.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- Easily drinkable. Great brew.","Greggy","Apr 10, 2010"
3.21,-7.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,2.5,"Poured from a clear bottle. Clear amber color with one inch of white head that has very good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. Smells like a grain mill. Slightly musty and spoilled grain aroma. Also pick up some grass and mint. Just not crazy about the flavor. Too grainy for me. Some earthy and grassy hop flavor. Bitterness is very low. Much more substantial body than most lagers. Definately more than adjunct lagers which is the point. Not as drinkable as regular Grain Belt and combined with a flavor I was not crazy about, keeps drinkability around average.","morimech","Apr 10, 2010"
3.41,-1.7,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"A good lawnmower beer. Painting the garage today, so it works perfectly for what I will be doing. Drinkability is pretty high, as the abv is low.","Buebie","Apr 07, 2010"
3.31,-4.6,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D: I had several pours from the pitcher, and this beer did not begin to feel heavy. The sweetness of the malt did however compound somewhat with each drink, making later pours a little sweeter than I'd like.","bcpriess","Apr 07, 2010"
3.2,-7.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: A good simple American Amber beer that will appeal to the casual beer drinker and to some craft beer drinkers as well. It probably won't win many awards (other than clever targeted marketing), but it's a decent beer that is a nice homage to my little NE Minneapolis neighborhood. I know I will probably be drinking plenty more of this in the future at local watering holes.","ChopperSmith","Beers"
4.38,26.2,4,3.5,4.5,5,5,"D= Excellent brew. I think this is just a little step up from Premium without making it too much of a craft beer lovers only beer. This is a nice step from the ordinary. Nothing crazy or special just a good easy drinking Amber Lager for a hard working guy after the job is done; exactly what Grain Belt was trying to portrait. Excellent work.","jjanega08","0"
