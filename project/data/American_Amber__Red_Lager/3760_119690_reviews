"Meh. Being organic is a selling point and this makes a nice companion to this brewery's original organic pale lager (see that review). Safe, should appeal to the masses and those just venturing forth into Sleeman's or Rickard's land from paler climes."

"Overall, an okay lager. A point for the organic ingredients."

"A step up from the plain Mill St. Organic but nothing brilliant."
"Not to sound petty, but I still can't over that this so-called ""Amber Lager"" is actually bright gold. It speaks to the fact that this recipe lacks virtually all the components intrinsic to the style - even the most basic element (colour) that's listed right there in beer's name! Almost designed as a hybrid between Organic and Tankhouse, 100th Meridian isn't as good as either."
"O - OK drinker. Middle-of-the road, accessible beer."

"Overall - An easy drinking amber lager with a solid malt backbone. Nothing too complex with this brew, just a simple malty lager."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by fairly bland flavors and aromas."

"Enjoy"
"Overall - A pretty decent amber that has a really good smell and taste, but can't quite measure up across the board to some of the best. Nevertheless something I wouldn't turn down if offered again."

"Final Thoughts: I heard a rumor that this beer was brewed to have the IBU dead between Mill St. Organic and Mill St. Tankhouse, and that's really what this beer taste like. A dead center compromise on the very smooth and easy but mild Lager and the more robust, hoppier character of Tankhouse. For what that is worth, I think it's a pretty good beer. Thumbs up."

"Overall - While not all that exciting, it does fit the bill of an amber beer. Not an American amber though.. not much hops and no fruity flavours. Kind of like a less sweet version of their tankhouse."
""
"A relatively ok lager, probably a slightly better than average in the organic beer realm as well."

"Final Grade: 3.88, a solid B+. Mill Street's 100th Meridian is a straightforward, tasty little organic beer that most beer enthusiasts should find highly agreeable. I rarely purchase Mill Street products (outside of these samplers every few months), but this is a brew that I'd definitely return to if it were to become available in a more convenient format. This is the sort of brew that 'regular' beer drinkers and BAs alike should be able to enjoy equally - well worth including in future samplers."

"Overall: A finely balanced and tasty beer, this is another solid offering from Mill Street. Pretty good stuff."
"A well-wrought amber lager, the organic nature merely an unused sidebar to me (I'm just glad that it doesn't seem to screw anything up). Flavourful, rounded, and pretty tasty overall - more lagers need to be made in this fashion, as if to debunk the American myth of bland, cheap, tainted caramel 'step-ups' from yer typical adjunct swill. And that's every single fucking thing I know on the matter."

"Part of the summer mixed six pack. This is a totally credible attempt at a pre-prohibition lager much like Sam Adams lager. Nice hops and malt mix with a long finish this is a beer that should be part of the regular lineup. Totally session able yet interesting enough to warrant buying again"
