"Good Amber color.  Smooth taste with strong lager finish.  Nice compliment to Bud stable."

"Refreshing beer, tastes great, solid abv, can drink all 12."
""
""
""
""
"Watery and slick. Will not buy again."
""
"This is a good beer. Smooth with a little kick. Throw in sal y and a Lime and it gives it that extra kick needed. The taste of the black crown is more powerful than the lime. Which is good in its own since. Also this somehow will get you tipsy without trying"
"I love this beer. Plenty of drunk nights with this"
""
""
""
"Bought it thinking it might be decent, but it was just typical macro watered down beer. Last time ill ever pay for a macro."
""
""
"Much better than the original and any other macro. Still wouldn't ever drink it again though"
"Overall: Not the worst beer I've ever had and certainly not the worst from the brewer. This is one of the better efforts from AB."
"Do not taste the hint of caramel they refer to, however a lot lighter than I originally anticipated It to be. I would drink it again."
""
"Probably my favorite Budweiser.  It surprised me a bit."
""

"One of the better beers they produce."

"M/O- A decent enough beer that doesn't change a whole lot from the start through to the finish.  It is a beer that I would be able to enjoy during a session, as it's thin to medium bodied, very smooth....the carbonation is quite fine, and it had a very standard, yet flavorful enough taste.  I would buy this again and think it's a good effort, and think it is getting a bad reputation overall just because it is a Budweiser product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this less and less as I continued to drink it. It had hints of being an amber lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a yellowish amber, white frothy head with quick dissipation, nose grainy, taste bland with hints of sweet corn nastiness. Not as repulsive as Bud Lite, but honestly I'll take the blandness of Bud over this one's attempts at character."
""
"Overall: This is a noticeable step above standard bud and other AAL's in flavor with a nice boost in abv to go with it. I wouldn't turn down this beer if someone offered it to me, but would not buy it myself. The worst fault is the lack of flavor to mask the somewhat high abv making it a little unpleasant to drink, but other than that it's pretty smooth which is what they are going for."

"O - A step above Bud's general offerings but not amazingly flavorful either.  An easy drinking session beer that is apparently inspired by amber lagers.  Not nearly as flavorful as most ambers or reds that I have had though.  3/5"

"In Sum: Four ounces in, count me out. Not undrinkable, but I'd have to be parched or dying of thirst to have this one again. Funny, I had a Miller High Life not long ago (which inspired me to pick this up) & it wasn't so bad. End Game: Sink."

"I like Fortune better than this. This may have a touch of age on it with an Apr 14 date on bottom of can (best by or canning date?). Either way I don't find the flavors all that pleasing putting it towards the bottom of lawn mower beers for me."
""
""
""
""
"overall I'm not impressed. although I got this bottle free, I wonder if they had a craft beer price tag on this one. but the thing is, pretending it's craft doesn't turn a bud into a craft beer. not that I am taking anything away from bud: it's not easy to make a nearly colorless, flavorless, crystal clear beer. but that's not going to take anything away from the craft beer market either. craft drinkers will see right through and go back to what they really want when they seek out an amber ale: flavor, aroma, head, lacing, etc, which this really doesn't have."

"I think of a malt liquor disguised in a sleek, 12oz bottle. Surprisingly enjoyable. Never thought I'd dig an anheuser Busch brew. Not a fan of the regular Budweiser or bud light but somehow the brewmasters at anheuser Busch created something I could enjoy. I especially like the fact that this particular brew is 6 percent alc by content. It packs a descent buzz for a budweiser"

"The taste also has a nice caramel sweetness to it and that Budweiser Beech-wood roastiness. Better than regular Budweiser by far."

"Saw this at my local C-store and decided I would give it a try. After all, it's black crown, so it must taste regal....right? Wrong. If I had to describe this beer it would be 3 parts bud, 2 parts Michelob Amber Bock. Tastes pretty bad and leaves a ""twang"" taste on your tongue after your done. Michelob Amber Bock isn't the greatest, but it deserves a crown a lot more than this crappy beer does. I'll stick with Sam Adams Boston Ale or even Miller Genuine Draft is better than the ""Black Crown."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think the hardest thing with this beer was the expectations. It's called Black Crown, but has a subtitle of ""golden amber lager"". What does golden amber mean, and why give it the black crown? It turns out the Budweiser on the can told me everything I needed to know. Looks and tastes like any other Bud product, a little sweeter than most. Not a bad beer if you're just drinking while hanging out, but the ABV is a little high for that. What this beer does very well is hide the somewhat high alcohol content, which could be trouble...if you're drinking it while hanging out. It goes down easy but it's not a beer you'll remember, and it could lead to a night you won't remember."
""

"Can: Poured a light brown color lager with a medium head with limited retention and very subtle lacing. Aroma consists of light cereal with grainy caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by grainy cereal notes with light caramel adjunct notes. Body is thin with OK carbonation. Worst than I was expecting."
""
""
""
"A good finger of head on a clear, amber colored body. The aroma is a little grain with some fruit, the beechwood is evident too. Smells nice. The taste is balanced and smooth. It has only the mildest bitterness to go with it’s malty body (for a lager). The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. It’s a smooth and tasty lager."

"Not sure what they going for here"
"Budweiser Black Crown brewed by Anheuser-Busch.The brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. This brew has an ABV of 6.0 but it goes down real smooth . The smell is the same as american style beer. The taste is heavy with a lot of flavor. This brew is really filling. Nothing Bad about this brew. Over all I give this beer a 4 out of 5."
""
"The color of the beer is awesome - very nice caramel'esque appearance. I enjoyed the nose - pleasant and certainly anything but overpowering. The taste was great. This beer isn't trying to do too much - it's solid, smooth, and well rounded. Very impressed with this effort, notwithstanding it's brethren."

"O-This has more taste that most beers from the big brewers enjoyed it"
""
"I'm glad I just had a sampler and didn't buy a 6 pack."
"It was all right, didn't care for the alcohol in the aroma."
""
""
""
"Disappointing. Immediately concluded the beverage was just another attempt by a giant producer to raise the APV and gain or maintain market share that way. Budweiser, a true American icon needs to lead the way, not follow the crowd. Unlike ""plain old Bud"" which has many distinctive characteristics, Black Crown has none other than its ""me too"" persona. Really disappointed. I expected much more."

"Overall better than most BMC."
"I will say this about ABInBev beers - they never lack for carbonation and effervescence. I started out with a finger-and-a-half of foamy french vanilla-colored head and it slowly fizzled down to less than a pinky's worth. Color and clarity were both fabulous with a deep-amber like you might see prehistoric bugs encased in and the opportunity to see all that there was to see, which in this case was the other side of the glass, the other side of the room, et al. I saw where previous reviewers mentioned its smell and it was nice, to be sure. It had a lightly toasted smell, sweet, but not necessarily caramel. More toward coconut. Mouthfeel was soft, especially after all of the initial carbonation. The taste was toasty, bready, not really even all that sweet. Finish was semi-dry and refreshing. It really was not a bad effort, although not a ""masterpiece"". If they put it in a CAN, I would be willing to try it again, but otherwise, it is one among many of its style."
""
"Appearance was surprisingly disappointing because normally you would expect and receive a good head on any beer from a large brewery like this. Not much here, and it fades fast. Nose is also a bit muted with some light grain aromas. Palate has a very light malty taste, whiff of alcohol heat, and not much else going on. Not as extremely light bodied as I was expecting and yet it is fairly drinkable. Just doesn't come across at all as any sort of flavor-focused beer."
""
""
"I'm a longtime Bud fan and recently tried this variation. First bottle, I thought ""it's OK", but by the second bottle I decided that I really like it. Not too far off in taste from original Bud. I don't think it will replace my favorite (regular Budweiser), but I much prefer Black Crown over most micro brews. Good stuff!"
""

"My rating is what I give Budweiser Black Crown and is based on the comparison between Black Crown and all of the other Budweiser Beer. This is the best Budweiser yet. I am surprised it has such low ratings. I have been drinking bud off and on for 15 years, and most of the time it tastes like piss water; but of course, after the first few regular buds, it does get better.. That aside :), this is a great beer. I was at the store and was considering other beers (micro brews) but saw Black Crown - hadn't seen it before. Got the 12 pack home, hoping it tasted a tad bit better than piss water... and it did. It tasted a lot better. Budweiser will never be known for being elegant, or taste like most micro brews, but this is the beer to get if you need something that tastes good on the first sip while keeping more money in your wallet/paypal acct /bitcoin acct/etc. :D The aftertaste, after consuming a taco and sipping on the beer isn't the greatest, but drinking this beer while eating is wonderful. I wrote this 3 beers in."
""
""
""
"Color me surprised! This stuff is drinkable. And it even has moments of being enjoyable! Give it a go if you are curious or need that tick fix."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very disappointing beer from Anheuser-Busch, not much taste or smell and the color reminded me of weak tea, know need to go into an in depth analysis. Would much rather drink bud, busch or even select over this beer. I think I will stick with the micro brews made in the area."
""

"O- overall not a bad beer for people who are beginng to explore the world of beer. A foot in the door. I could drink a couple on a sunday."

"actually, it IS almost drinkable.... pour pi$$ urine yellow (?more yellow than the kirin I just had) . . . . smell is non-existent.... taste is . . . . geez, whatever.... I so wanted to be a part of that commercial where everybody is drinking the black crown and saluting the guy at the head of the table.... oh well, never mind.... barf. but I think I just MAY be able to finish this one if I hold my nose and guzzle . . . . ."
""
""
""
"Overall - Hey, it's a step in the right direction for BMC drinkers I guess. Really boring taste wise and not something I'd have any reason to order again."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly transparent amber color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Small amount of lacing. Smell a faint smoky aroma. Has a light body feel in the mouth with the taste of grain and some sweetness. Almost no bitterness of hops. After taste of smokey gran is very good. Goes down smooth. Over all a good beer and wish I had another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No hops, a medium-light body, and only a vague caramel taste to support it, I wondered if A-B was trying to recapture the lost 1970's glory of Michelob Lager with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's an almost cloying aspect to this beer which is fortunately kept at bay by a dryness that's while subdued, does counter it. The body is light, a bit too light, but crispness doesn't disappoint."
""
""
"O: This does not really taste like a Amber/Red Lager but rather like a light or watered down version. It really needs a little more body, some richer malt flavors, and hops that can be found in both the aroma + taste."
""
""
""
"This is an alternative to the vanilla Bud when you’re looking to crush some beers post work. Definitely a new challenger has emerged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"O- This beer is clearly trying and failing. I would rather drink a less ambitious beer that is not trying to be anything but good ol' American macro swill and succeeding at succeeding at it splendidly. This was not an enjoyable Amber Lager. Not an enjoyable beer in general. I got this bottle for free the morning after a barn party, and I don't plan to buy it in the future. In fact, I would be pleased if this beer never crossed my lips again."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, it’s just a mediocre beer at best."
""
"Final Grade: 3.1, a C+. Budweiser Crown isn't an especially bad beer, but at the same time, it has no real distinguishing characteristics that would bring me back for more. While superior to standard Bud in every category outside of sessionability, it still has enough flaws - most prominently the lack of any real bittering hop balance to counter the caramel - that I can't really consider this anything much better than average. A serviceable, if unimaginative macro amber that I'd never turn down, but I'm not in a hurry to pick up another six-pack."

"I really wanted to not like this brew because as we all know Budweiser is not a quality product, but I tried a few at my fantasy football draft and I was pleasantly surprised. While I will not call this beer a quality beer, I enjoyed them and was able to finish them before they got lukewarm. The beer is very average looking for a lager, all the typical signs of a lager, the aroma is slightly above par for a lager and it pours with just the right amount of head and lace. A bit over carbonated, but not to the point of rejection. Where this beer fails is the strong aftertaste it leaves in your mouth, kind of sour and pungent, but not the worst beer in the world. I would not recommend spending your money on this beer, but if you are at a friends house and they have some, give it a try!"

"Amber lagers and ales are already a blighted by ennui style, so of course AB-Inbev would choose this as their next attempt at craft beer 'legitimacy' for the US market (uttered with only an iota of cynicism). Not bad, I suppose, and much, much more malty than their standard fare, even the short-lived American Ale of a few years back, if memory serves. It's just that, while malty is good, it just seems like the hops should be treated with the same respect, maybe? Baby steps, I guess, and I'm certain that Bud knows and thus caters to their target market's predilection for all things sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black Crown Pours a clear golden color with a nice large head, and nice carbonation. Smells likes ass and soap. Taste is very soap and damp. Poor flavors make it undrinkable. Overall its not the worst offering from there, but the taste is just not there."
""
" A good backyard grillin beer, went good with chili. Easy drinkin working class lager, when you want something heavier than Budweiser, or Miller. Good price."
""
""
"O - even given the color, which at this point I can safely say could even be artificial, I cannot recommend this beer at all. to beer nerds, to regular Bud fans, to people looking to branch out, to anyone looking to try something new. No reason to recommend this. If this is an attempt on Bud's part to reach out into the craft world with its ""beechwood aging"" and the like, they need to rethink it. hell, American Ale was a great beer that I can't even find anymore. They should reinvest in that and just leave this one to rot."

"Pours a pretty reddish-copper amber in color with a very thin cap. Some spotyy lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is mostly of roasted malts and grain with a very light hint of caramel also. The taste was pretty much the same but did leave a bitter aftertaste that lingered for awhile. Strange that I liked this brew less and less after each sip. Lighter bodied with good carbonation as is the norm for most Bud products. What did I like about this beer? The color and that is was gone finally."
"the 2ed best macrobrew stuff Ive ever had, right behind Narragansett."

"Budweiser Black Crown (2013) - So the story goes-- Bud challenged its 12 brewmasters to come up with a better Bud. 6 beers were made. Taste tests were done. This amber lager was the winner. And so even though I despise Bud in every way possible comes my eventual meeting with Bud's ""best""... and it goes like this: Good head upon pour reduces to decent lacing. Highly active carbonation. Straw yellow in color. Decent body for a lager. High alcohol smell revealing its 6% ABV. Under notes of malt and hops. A little citrus. Light mouthfeel. Not bad. A little wet but there is a subtle crispness. Nose is slight hops. Little if any lager skunk. Mid-palate is roasted oats and smoked barely. That alcohol punch right in the back of the mouth as it makes its way to back palate. A little caramel (as promised albeit light in nature) and again some lemon citrus. Malt on the back palate. Slight pine hops. A little more citrus highlighting that. Crisp after taste. That notable Bud drinkablity is there. It's not as watery. Not as wussy fizzy. But arguably it is the Bud of mass produced wanna be micro brewed lagers. Think less hoppy Sam's Lager. More clean Third Shift with a higher ABV. This is a high alcohol beer that is very drinkable. It makes Triple X by Molson look raw and unrefined. But at the same time it is lacking. There is simply something missing. I could be lame and say passion, but I think it's more the taste. It tries to be everything to everyone. And its so inoffensive it almost is offensive. If I had to suggest a beer for the every man this would be it. There is no daring to it. No unknown waters. Nothing bad to be had. But if you are looking for unexpected-- this is not this. This is simply an amazingly drinkable high ABV lager with a nice beechwod Bud finish. Safe. Like a life jacket. Or US bonds. Or driving with Grandma. If that's not your thing-- well you too will be left staring going ""I just though there would be more"". 3.5 out of 5. Good."

"Tasty! A pleasant surprise from AB. Fun to see the big boys try something different. I'm a Yuengling fan and this seems like a comprable alternative (Ive likley betrayed my ignorance, but who cares) Really just learning about beer, so I don't know art, but I know what I like, and I like!"
""

"Overall I like it more than the original Budweiser and think it has a good position in the macro beer market. Don't mind seeing the big guys being ""crafty"" when they keep the same brand name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everyone is saying this is a red it is a golden. Which is even stated on the AB website. I like the fizzy taste after a hard days work it wakes up the palate. Washing down the dust from hard work. I would like to see a little of smoke added to the flavor profile. Maybe after roasting the hops run a little smoke of them."

"Budweiser Black Crown isn't the worst i've ever tasted nor is it the best but they are okay. I am a fan of busweiser in general and never have had a problem with flavor or anything like that. i like that they came out with this. i prefer it to some of the other stuff that they have made and enjoy a nice cold one once in a while."

"O- pretty poor example of a Red Lager, not even a good example of a beer."

"Bitter, almost sour. Not red in color as amber would suggest. Not terribly pleasant but the ABV gives a good kick from an atypical macro. Kudos to Budweiser for the effort though."

""

"This beer is highly effervescent, too effervescent I must say, in which the bite of the bubbles sting your palate. Taste is similar to a regular Budweiser beer, but slightly sweeter due to its ABV content. Overall, I would drink this beer with burgers or dogs, and then move on to quality craft brews. Bon Appetit!"
"Not bad for Budweiser, has a real beer taste... got to say .... this might be one of my favorites from the bud family... I thought this was going to be to Budweiser what Bud light platinum is to bud light, but the flavor is distinct ... Good job guys"

"O - Quite tasty for what it is. However, maybe a bit high in alcohol for a sessionable lager."
""
""
""
""

"D - Surprisingly, this isn't just repacaged bud, it is much heavier and maltier than I expected. Still, that isn't to say it is exactly good. The malt comes across well enough, but they are still afraid of hops, both flavor wise and in terms of bitterness. With some balance it could have been decent, but as it stands it is a bit flabby and cloying."
"Into a pint glass, a clear pale amber color with one finger of off white head. Quick fade to a thin cap. Nose is overly sweet and grassy. Taste faintly of malt alcohol, no real hopiness. Taste is not as sweet as nose, thankfully. Faint alcohol note on finish. Mouth is a bit thin and bubbly, OK. Overall: Rather mediocre, not terrible, kind of what I'd imagine as a sub-par example of pub ale, except it's 6% ABV so it's not exactly a ""session"" beer. I wouldn't buy another but wouldn't turn one down either."
""

"O: I like this beer better than the regular Bud by far, but it's not my go to beer unless Heineken was sold out in my local gas station/mart/store. It's all around pretty decent."

"Clear amber body with an eggshell white head forms fine evenly dispersed lacing, somewhat fizzy carbonation a stream of bubbles rise from the bottom of my glass. Aroma has some actual cereal grains going on with a touch of Beechwood or at least reminiscent of the regular Budweiser. This one kicks up the alcohol at 6% abv, and also invites a touch of fruitiness and mild caramel accents, earthy jumbled generic hop accents. Flavor wise it's a bit rough, each sip has an edge that I'm just not in favor of, light cereal grain sweetness with a dry finish with rough cooked vegetable notes and some woody bark like notes that don't add to the complexity but only fortify the reason why I drink craft beer pre-dominantly. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with aggressive carbonation, harsh finish I spoke about continues to effect the palate in a negative way. This is Budweiser's answer to Yuengling let's add some caramel coloring to a similar Budweiser recipe and compete directly with a brand they we now do a lot of distribution for. Overall impression is that I won't be picking up more of this, the plus side is that it's only 2 bucks for a 22 ounce bottle of it, and I believe pretty affordable in sixers, and twelve packs."

"From the bottle it pours out a rich, dark hue of amber - thick, tan head with just a little lacing and staying power. The odor from the beer reminds me of smoked wood, hickory actually, which I enjoyed and took in for a while. The mouthfeel was simply average - not too watery, not too thick, no aftertaste, but nothing to set it aside from others. The taste was also above average - I didn't take in any of the smoky scents in the beer, but it did have that good dark lager taste (surprising me in the process.) Overall, I rated it well above average - for all the flak Bud takes, you gotta give the devil his due on this one. (Oh, and at 6% ABV, its a quick way to get shinola-faced...)"
""
"12oz bottle, pours golden-amber with striking clarity, thin, bubbly, white head dissipates very quickly. Aromas are lager yeast, metallic, faint toasted grain. Taste has some nice toasted grain up front, but other than that it's pretty much like most of the other AB offerings: not much for flavor, cereal, faint grassy hops. Mouth-feel is thin and watery with the higher carbonation making it feel a little fuller. Overall, I didn't expect much here, so I guess you could say it delivered?"
"Appearance has a light golden brown color supporting a dissipating head leaving nill lace. Smell of the adjuncts within a Bud but also having a sweetness of the malt. Taste has a Budwieser, adjuncty, malt infused sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with fair carbonation. I mainly got this beer do to curiosity, one bottle is all thats needed, no need for a half rack."
"Overall Budweiser's Black Crown is a step above the traditional Budweiser, offering a fuller taste and mouth feel. The taste duration is good, neither short nor long."
"Pours a clear copper body with a head that fizzes and fizzles like soda water, without leaving a collar or a trace of lacing. Aromas are faint bud not bad. I mainly get a lightly toasted graininess with maybe a hint of caramel sweetness and a bit of plantain peel. Taste tends toward the sweeter end of the spectrum from start to finish, with toasty malts blending with sugariness on the front and mid-palates before a minerality emerges on the back to make the finish more crisp and memorable. Medium-light body is appropriate for how little flavor it carries, and overall it's an okay beer but seems boring when compared to some of the more established competitors in its style."
"Excellent idea following the platinum, but could use some more noticeable flavors to improve the beer"
"This beer has clear light amber color with a white head that disappears quickly. It has light carbonation with a smell of cereal grains and sweetness. This is slightly different with its smooth, clean finish and some caramel notes. I would choose this over a Bud."

"I actually enjoy the flvor and taste of a Budweiser or ""Bud Heavy"" as I call it, over several other beers especially Miller Light. It is what it is a beer that is going to get you drunk and that you can drink alot of. I do feel like this version is a little heavier than the regular Bud but other than that there is no difference other than the alcohol content."
""
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving traces lace. Crystal clear amber/yellow color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Nose is sweet pear, flavor is light sweet pear. Clean finish. Better than a Bud. $1.59 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
"Overall: I didn't try any of the other Project 12 beers, but if this is the winner, then apparently I didn't miss much. This beer isn't awful, and it is a step up from regular Bud and Bud Light, but that's the best thing I can say about it. I tried it once to satisfy my curiosity, I'd never get it again."
""
"Much better than I thought it would be, but I still wouldn’t order it at a bar."
""
""
"Decent drinkability, not super complex, but I could do a few of these on a hot day (like today). One of the better beers from the evil empire I've had in a while. A heavier hand with the hops would've been my preference though from a taste & style perspective"
"This isn't a bad beer, but it's a bit rough around the edges. The malt offers a decent flavor profile that isn't typical for an AB product. It could be smoothed out a bit, but as is, it's clean, smooth, and goes down easily. As one would expect, it's very crisp and a bit over carbonated. In the end, this isn't a beer that I'll be going back to. I'm glad I tried it once, and it does meet the requirements of the style nicely. Ultimately, I just need a more flavorful, hoppier lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is slightly sweet, but finishes fairly dry. Apple, bread crusts, soaking grain husks. Light bitter tang in the aftertaste, which has little to no hop flavor. Gassy carbonation, foams up immediately on contact, producing excessive burps. Taste is decidedly middling to average, many better and some worse in this category. Better than BL Platinum..."
""
""
"Overall I don't know what this beer is trying to do. I would rather buy amber bock which at least has some balls. Don't bother with this one."
"Source: Purchased at Wal-Mart in Texas as a selection of a Brewmaster's Choice build-your-own six-pack for $8.99."
""
"D NOT bad! bud not as good as a real craft beer. havent really priced it yet, its good if it's significantly cheaper than a craft."
""
""
"O: I can see where they were going with this but I thought it was pretty gross. Given the choice I’d rather drink normal Bud. Not worth the money."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a below average ale from Bud, but still better than Bud Light and Bud Heavy. Seems like a closer attempt to something craft than there other products, but still not great. Worth checking out if you're stuck at a bar or house with only BMC products, but if you have a choice of something craft, it will probably still be better than this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is the ""platinum"" version of ""Bud Heavy"". Some advertisement claimed this beer to have won a competition between Budweiser brewers. This cannot be possible. It exists to pump a little more alcohol into regular Budweiser. I'm sure the drunks will buy it at least."
""
""
""
"The aroma of this brew consisted of pale malted grain, and a slight hint of floral hops. Light in body, there is a foundation of malted grain, a slight amount of hops and a dry finish. Overall, disappointing, perhaps a bit more flavor then Budweiser, but leaves a lot to be desired."
""
""
"A step up from Bud Bud Light Bud Heavy etc, but a lightweight in the real world"
"O: Better than BL Platinum, I suppose. I've had it once, I never need to have it again."
"I was mostly impressed with the appearance here. Good looking beer for real. I think the aroma could be seriously improved and the hop character could be more defined, and then we would be talking a seriously amazing beer. Would I buy this again? Maybe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Uninspiring. For an amber lager, I was hoping to get a little more out of it. And if I'm looking for an Anheuser Busch product to drink, does Michelob still make their porter and dunkelweizen?"
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprised; wouldn't buy this one but I'd choose it hands-down over a myriad of other BMC options."
"Really good stuff. I am close to 60 years old; I can no longer drink any beer with live yeast in it due to an enlarged prostate. Which really blows; I love IPAs and hoppy hoppy beer. Hoppy beer makes me happy. So unless, I want to walk around with a catherer inserted; I need to drink pasteurized beer. Budweiser got this one right. It tastes good. It has a kick. And I can pee afterwards. Bravo Budweiser."
"No reason to be a beer snob about this one. It is one of the better macro brews I can think of. A good, but not complex aroma and taste. At first sip I worried a bit about the slight sweetness but that faded as I continued. I would definitely try again ... one of the better value beers I've encountered in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This beer was much better than I was expecting and is really not bad at all. It’s lighter and more toned-down than good amber lagers, but I was expecting a lot less from AB InBev. It’s extraordinarily drinkable, especially at 6%, and very refreshing. For what it’s supposed to be, it’s actually quite good. I would definitely take this over other BMC offerings."
""
"Seriously, If you find yourself fuct in a MBC desert, try this one. Threre is some flavor there if you look really hard. i give it fours for taste an mouthfeel because in comparison to my other options tonight it went above and beyond. Wood drink again."
""
" This lager tastes decent with generally light malt but only the slightest toasted grain taste and low hop flavor with some gentle yeast and subtle alcohol with generally bready taste and grainy with slight sweet adjunct type sweet flavor, but not as full flavored as you might expect from a 6% lager. Overall a no frills stronger than average lager for this brewery with ease of drinkability but not abundantly flavorful, I would probably pass unless it was given to me."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a amberish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some light malts. Taste is also mild, somewhat weak, a bit of grains and malts. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while nothing offensive, tends to be a bit yawn inducing."
""
"A new favorite BMC beer. I could actually see myself downing a few of these on a spring afternoon. If the price is right, I'd actually consider going halfsies on a case."
""
""
"I will say that the smell is okay, the taste is not really bad or good, and the color is a reddish one. Outside of that, there is not much going on here but it does hold up to other beers that are exactly like it."
""
""
"FWIW, this was Batch 91406 from Bud’s Project 12 last fall. This was my review of 91406: An amber lager finished on beechwood chips. If you close your eyes and pay close attention, you can catch the hint of woodiness. Drinkable, with nothing to insult your palate."
""
""
"Anyhow, I expect this one to fade from the market quite quickly."
""
"I would imagine if you drank a lot of these that the sweetish malt might build on your palate, but it's balanced enough that everything remains in check throughout one. And I'm not sure that it would work with any less maltiness, as it would then just be a slight variation from their standard product; this should clearly stand out as a different product."

"Pours a clear, amber color. 3/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong adjunct, sweet malt, pale malt, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable metallic quality. Tastes of strong adjuncts, slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, decent appearance and feel, but the aroma and body are negatively affected by the presence of adjunct."
""
""
"O - Not as bad as I was expecting. An improvement over standard Bud and the Platinum, but I won't be buying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final verdict? Better than Bud Light, Budweiser, and the rest of the lot, but still nowhere near good enough to require a second purchase."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent reddish amber with a small head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of water, some darker malt, not much of anything. Tastes of slightly caramel malt, a little of hops, but watery. Beer is carbonated heavily and very drinkable. Overall, this beer is not good, but not bad, just average."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely impressed by Budweiser for stepping up their game by making a stronger craft wanna-be beer. I hope they continue the experimentation, because compared to the rest of their lineup, this one's pretty good."
""
""
"High F"
"Very disappointed with this beer. At best, an average lawnmower beer for the summer. But there are enough of these. The manufacturer led me to believe that this was something better than average. So, my money didn't go to Stone, Dogfish Head, Drakes, or any other smaller but better brewery. So, I'm the sucker. You don't need me to convince you what you'll achieve by drinking this. Good luck."
""
""
"O: It's a notch above AB's base product line, but still very safe, bland, and indistinct in the end."
""
""
""
""
"The Budweiser web site says this is a ""smooth drinking"" amber lager, but I wouldn't go quite that far. There is an almost sharp and metallic ""twang"" to this beer overall, both in taste and feel. It's certainly not the worst of things, yet hardly appealing (to me) in a generic lager style. There's not much balance or real taste treats to be found in this offering. In fact, I'd much rather have a Budweiser than a Black Crown. No, AB did not come up with a winner with this one..."
""
""
"O - The good news is that it's better than regular Budweiser, but it falls short of being a flavorful, balanced lager. There's just too much sweetness and no hop presence. It's not terrible, but definitely not something I would purchase again."
""
""
""
"Overall - If you go in with an open mind, it really isn't that bad. Could be used as a bridge beer for macro drinkers into craft. I wouldn't buy it, but if it's free I'd certainly drink it again."
"i was a bit disappointed. Knowing that Budweiser was bought by a European brewer I expected a better brew after watching the commercial. i was hoping for something along the lines of a European lager."
""
"Overall Drinkability: If an adjunct and an amber gave birth to a malt liquor, this would be it."
"I'm sorry, this is the best light bodied beer I've ever had. Its my new lawnmower beer. Its not craft brew, its just damned good macro swill."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has about the same appeal as standard Budweiser. There's something to be had here, but they haven't figured it out yet. The increased depth of flavor is unfinished and weak. At least Budweiser is what it is. The crown is black, not by choice, but by neglect."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pokal glass. Pours light golden amber with a thick, quickly dissipating white head and lots of visible tiny bubbles. The beer smells like lightly toasted grain with some mild sweetness. I can also smell some of the alcohol as well. The taste follows the nose. There's some grain and some mild caramel sweetness in the flavor. The hops are mild here, but they are present and provide some woodiness. This isn't very different from the regular Budweiser, which isn't a bad thing. The body is light with strong carbonation. The beer finishes crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer."
""
"I've had much worse beers before, but this isn't one I'd return to, given the choices."
""
""
""
"O: if you want to buy something from Budweiser get a plain ol Bud diesel, there is a reason it will be around long after Black Crown is gone, this beer is too much like a sweet beer flavored soda, it's trying to be a bock but falls short on all areas"
""
"O: Has some interesting hints and notes here and there but ultimately is a hollow beer that doesn't fulfill its potential. Probably my favorite of the Budweiser bunch, however."
""
"O: Pretty much the lightest version of an amber lager that you could imagine. It's sweet with just a touch of hops. Pretty drinkable though, it's quite smooth and it goes down easily for a 6% BMC product. Honestly it's remarkably similar to bud light platinum. Just has that little bit of color and herbal flavor to make it an ""amber"" I guess."
""
""
""
""
"A-B/InBev could learn a thing or two from Coors, especially Batch 19, Blue Moon, etc. This variant isn't interesting enough to warrant further attention."
""
"I came at this open minded but find it an average delivery, but not nearly as poor as some."
"Instead of $6 for 6, it should be $2 for a whole 32oz pitcher. With some pull off or scratch off lottery tickets. And cake on a Styrofoam plate."
""
"O - I wanted to try it because it was something new. Wasn't bad, but nothing I'll seek out for sure. If I'm not drinking good beer, I'll just stick with Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
"Saw the commercials for this and had to try it. The beer had a nice color and a small short lived head when poured. Not a lot of smell, nothing unpleasant. This beer was malty without any hoppy bitterness . It felt nice in the mouth when drinking with just a slight aftertaste. I really didn't find anything I liked or disliked about it. It was not real flavorful overall . Probably wouldn't purchase again"
""
""
".I'm not a professional beer reviewer but this beer hits the sweet spot for me and I encourage you to try it."
"I will continue to buy this beer until it inevitably becomes discontinued."
""
"This is a Yuengling rip off. It is certainly nothing great and I will never, ever purchase this again. This is why I bought a single bottle just to try, and I didn't have high expectations for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It was rather like a malt, but not a great malt and more expensive and less effective than the average. If you want a Bud, stick with the regular or the American and pass on this."
""
"O - Budweiser plays it safe with Black Crown, barely stepping away from their core brands with this beer - don't wanna rock the boat or open any craft beer doors to people! Just a little addition of toasted malt brings some dryness and flavor to the otherwise adjunct-rich brew and, honestly, I can actually taste some faint ""wood aging"" in play here. Black Crown is by no means a bad beer though, it's just run-of-the-mill as one might expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It won't change your life or win over someone who only drinks fancy $10/bottle craft beers, but I like it for what it is: an inexpensive macro brew that goes down smooth with a nice flavor. This is the kind of beer that's good to pick up a 6 and share with a friend after work or drink during your fun weekend activity of choice. Well done, AB."
""
""
"Overall: Better than Budweiser or most of the American yellow fizzy water out there. However still lacking in some areas that I could see making the beer better. With that said, I would recommend this to almost anyone to try a solid simple beer that is not overly complex, or to throw down a 6 pack with some buddies after a hot day in the sun while relaxing under a tree or around a pool."
""
""
"People get all up in arms about Marilyn Manson and Jersey Shore and video games corrupting youth and traditional values. This beer and its marketing campaign are guilty of a similar crime, and we should take to the streets about it!"
"The second taste was a full, mustache wetting swig that revealed a medium-bodied, rich and flavorful beer with a hint of sweetness. Everything after confirmed that Black Crown was created to have a broad appeal. Its profile will satisfy without standing out. One might call Black Crown an ideal ham and cheese sandwich beer, perfect accompaniment to an impromptu lunch on the deck under a bright sun. It would also serve as an excellent apres-ski beer in front of a roaring fireplace with friends."
""
""
""
""
"Not the worst beer I've ever had, but bleh. It is what it is... for the price, it's good to get cheap drunk. It's certainly better than Budweiser, but not by much. There's a lot of sweetness, so I expect a lot of adjunct fans to fall in love with this."
"O- this is another lackluster product from AB, there's nothing that really sets this apart from other mass produced products, not offensive but nothing worth noting, wouldn't buy again"
""
"1.49/bottle at Total Wine. Had to try it. Not the worst AB product I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Maybe it should have been called ""BLACK DIAMOND""."
""
""

"I'd commit to a sixer."

""
""
"What king would wear such a thing? King of the Goths, perhaps? BA-ZING! ... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises dried caramel, flowers, and a hint of artificial vanilla. The taste focuses on the inherent sweetness of things, adding in a touch of wheatiness for the sake of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slightly slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an okay beer, sorta reminiscent of Bud American Ale, but sweeter and less nuanced. Not bad, but nothing to make me wanna buy another one on purpose."
""
""
""
"I hope they continue to step it up from here. I like this one actually."
"Sometimes I feel that the vast majority of BA has an unjustified hatred for AB Inbev. But then I drink a beer like this. This basically tastes like Budweiser with a slightly different malt profile. It's not a complete mess (I've definitely had far worse beers), but it's sub-par on every level. It's like giving a crappy car a fancy paint job. At its core, this tastes more or less like Budweiser. But thanks to marketing, poor unfortunate souls (and me) pay more money for this. At least Bud Light Platinum (BL NUMZ!) has the novelty of being a mainstream, light malt liquor. This is just a more expensive Budweiser."
"Overall- Easy to drink and better than a regular Budweiser, but still a pretty average beer."
""
""
"Overall: I'd hoped for and would have appreciated something at least tolerable. It was a little less than that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it is what it is."
""
""
"Another beer to come from a big brewer that has loads of potential and just does not follow through and is not bold enough to be epic. With that said it lands average, if the flavors did not pull their punches I'd be singing some praise for this brew."
""
""
""
""
"The malty finish saves this beer. Very toffee-like, which detracts from the initial tanginess in a good way."
""
"This tastes like Bud in a black bottle. This is regular bud in a black bottle. This is not beer. Also, the head is weak and goes away almost immediately. Giving this beer a 1 for smell is a lie. It is actually a 0."
"Other AB attempts to compete with craft beer have been flops, so it will be interesting to see if this beer makes it."
""
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket. Pours a crystal-clear light amber body with a good half inch of off-white head. Hints of wood comprise a rather modest aroma. Wood, bready malt, reminds me of some kind of cracker though I can't think of what kind. Light bodied with moderate to full carbonation. Not bad. Smooth, clean, and pleasant. A good law mower beer."
""
"Cracked a bottle open and poured it into my mug. It was a clear golden amber with a quickly fading head. It kind of tastes like a less-amber Yuengling. There's noticeable touch of caramel and toffee over a bit of bread crust. The beer isn't slightly sweet, like a lot of clean macro lagers—especially the ambers. The aroma is too bland and empty, just a vague graininess. If I were you, I'd just go for a Yuengling. It's certainly better than Bud heavy, and is relatively clean in inoffensive. There are just better toasted and amber lagers out on the shelves."
"O - Overall, It was an improvement over it's Project 12 counter-part, but that isn't saying a whole lot."
""
""
"O: Overall its a decent beer. now as for its tittle as a ""Golden amber"" eh almost there i feel like it needed to be a lot of hops added and more of the caramel malts to be very more dominated. But i have to admit the hidden alcohol (over load of the sugars) is very well played. It a step up of their regular Budweiser but came a bit short. if you want to be impressed with a domestic beer try coors ""Batch 19"" those guys killed it"
""
""
""
""
"Just a better bud, more golden / amber / darker in pour. As we await the super bowl commercial. Malty, crisp, fresh, smooth, caramel, floral hops, alcohol (6.0). Very little aroma. Hopefully on sale in grocery store. Minimal after taste, pours into glass well with a noticeable head. Worth a try ."
""
"Poured aggressively into a regular pint glass producing a two finger head which slowly dissipates into a foamy top. No lacing. Amber in color and a few bubbles of carbonation. Sweet malty aroma. First sip has a medicinal/herbal taste and a malty finish. Honestly, I can't taste the hops. Are they even in there? The alcohol definitely hits you after one. This beer is good if you want to get hammered, but taste-wise it's like chewing up a cracker and instead of swallowing, letting the pieces dissolve in your mouth. It's doubtful I would ever get this again, but I just wanted to see what ""Black Crown"" was all about."
"Overall this is just average. Pretty much this is Budweiser re-imagined, the result is more or less a maltier Michelob."
"not terrible but not outstanding . again, just Budweiser cleaned up, a bit ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoy Budweiser. Budweiser American Ale seemed like a genuine attempt to step outside the box for A-B. Black Crown seems like an attempt to just sell more beer by finding a few (million) people that like this unique taste. Like Bud Light Platinum, I'll have no desire to buy this again. Even crappy Bud Ice is better than this. I sincerely hope that A-B will one day use its massive resources to brew a truly wonderful version of Budweiser."
"First off I am a Budweiser Drinker. I usually Drink Regular bud Canned. This beer is the ""winner"" of brewmaster's project twelve. I wish they would have gone with the vanilla cask ale myself.... On to the beer: Dark golden color (for bud) Noticeably not much of a head and no lacing. it's not offensive but I was expecting so much more for the ""Black Crown"" It does hide the 6.0% ABV well. at $6/6 pack it's a decent brew"
"O: this beer is ok if it were to replace regular bud i would be fine with that but as a competitor to high end beers or micro brews it does not fair as well. at the same price, at least in my area, as beers that are of much better quality i dont see much of an incentive to buy this again"

"The beer pours a light amber to dark golden in color. There is a large white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is toasted malt, lightly burnt bread crumbs, slightly sweet with a light grassiness on the end. The taste follows the aromas, quite toasted, lightly sweet, with a grassy and lightly bitter finish. There is an unpleasant overcooked brussell spout note that permeates the entire thing."
