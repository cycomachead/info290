"O- based on its initial appearance, this looks like it should be a better beer than it is. Nothing worth pursuing again."

"As the name suggests, this pours an amber color with a decent off-white head. The aroma is mostly of grains and malts. The taste is rather malty with some spices as well. Finishes slightly crisp and I actually think this delivers a better spice flavor than their Oktoberfest. Not bad, I heard they were putting this into hibernation so I wanted to try it before I couldn’t find it anymore."

"Classic Amber pours a clear darken gold color, with a small head. There was a very subtle malt aroma; not really much of anything. The taste was subtle, strawy malts, with a yeasty like taste. A bit watery, but still crisp. Overall this isn't a bad beer, doesn't have that cheap taste some other red lagers have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would probably not go out of my way to get this again, but it wasn't horrible. Very sessionable. If my friend happens to leave this in my fridge again, I will drink it. Not bad enough to throw out."

"O- its just an average lager beer and i wouldnt waste money on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A slightly above average amber that was better than expected."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is soft. Not abrasive in any way. Very drinkable. Not an in-your-face beer by any means. Just an easy drinking, dependable, lower alcohol lager that is fine for any occasion or any season. To be honest, it’s much better than expected."
""
""
""

"This is a very average beer. It's not awful and ultimately drinkable, but it's rather one dimensional and forgettable."

"Overall, I have no desire to drink this again, there is really nothing going on here, except noticeable faults and problems. Drinkability is practically near zero for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: I thought this would be an ale since it was in a mixer with a red lager. Oh well. Goes down easy enough, but otherwise is less than good. A beer for washing down food. Actually gets less appealing as your drink it down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appears as a standard clear amber color, has exactly the same fizzy non-head, no lacing, as all other Leinenkugel products I've tasted. Smell is very faint and nondescript...I get a vague sense of faded biscuit malt and some mild cooked corn. Tastes like a cross between the nuttiness of the Fireside Brown and a corn adjunct lager. Fizzy thin body just like a soda pop. This one only just barely manages to be a slightly better choice than a BMC."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt. In the taste, a sweeter malt and a bite gingerbread like. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malt in the aftertaste. A sweet gingerbread malt to a dry end, eh!, really lacking any flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Otherwise, its decent, but fairly boring, and a little expensive, seems to grow in price more every year. Pretty mild, might have a place with converting people early on in their foray into craft beer. . ."

"Far better than I expected from this brewer, but both the marketing and the style claims are out of line. The final verdict always comes back to taste and while it is far from offensive, it isn't going to win too many people over. A bland beer from a bland brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"blah! this is about as bland as they come. pours a not at all amber golden color with a minor haze and a decent head, but this looks like a pilsner to me. the smell is very basic too, no indication of those rich amber malts, just a very generic budweiser type nose. taste is similarly bland with nothing to distinguish it as a ""classic amber"". it is nto a bad brew, but it isnt what it claims to be in the slightest. reasonable mouthfeel with medium body and suitable carbonation, but this will not be purchased again. weak showing from leinys, which usually produces at least B level beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bud lite-- I take the classic amber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's an entry level beer. Definitely not a great American Amber and it has a lot of Adjunct Lager qualities. I find it more pallatable, but still very basic. I see this beer as a gateway and can appreciate it at that level."

"This beer is a great Fall offering for those who dig the Leinenkugel lineup... i.e. someone who likes going a notch above macro."
"Overall: expected big things from this beer, as I've enjoyed cases of the Leinenkugel sampler before; not disappointed by its balance,, its drinkability, and its characetr--crisp yet full, tasty yet smooth....a beer I could session in a college bar for an evening,, for sure..."

"The taste is well...average. Along with the mouthfeel. It goes down really easy and is mildly appealing. But I would compare this to one step down from most good amber ale's I've had. But like I said, very average."
"O) This is decent. No wow factor.... It's crisp, fairly refreshing, and it goes down easy enough."
"Overall Drinkability - No off characters."
"D- Blah. Not that great."
"I don't know...if you're an amber fan, you should try it. I'm not a fan, but I also don't not prefer them, if that makes sense?"
"O- I like American Amber style brews, simply put. Almost as good as an American Ale, but not quite there. A solid beer I will drink again."
"Gave it a semi-gracious 2.5. I wouldn’t try it again on purpose."
"I could flip a coin between this and a Schlitz, so I guess I do give a Schlitz for Leinenkugel Classic Amber."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a copper body with a 3 inch fizzy white head that stays around for a little while. The smell is sweet and malty with some biscuit coming through. The taste is malty with some bitter hops coming though. The mouth feel is good. Overall this is a decent beer."
"This stuff is alright. Nothing special yet easy drinking."
"This is a nice amber beer and I've enjoyed it more on-tap than in the bottle. It tends to seem a bit fuller-bodied and maltier. Solid but never blows me away."
"The Classic Amber pretty much reminds me of their Red Lager. The pour gives off pretty much the same color and head. It's a redish colored liquid with a little white head. The smell gives off a decent sweet aroma with some grainy malts followed by a light hop aroma as well. The taste is decently bitter with some good malts in the background. The finish is on the dry side. The mouthfeel is light to medium. The beer is drinkable to say the least. It's good for a casual drinking beer."
"Overall: this is a decent amber lager which would make a great barbecuing beer. It's got a little bit of character, but it is refreshing and sessionable as well."
"D: Very drinkable as an ""almost macro"" with a good flavor profile."
"Taste is lightly toasty biscuity malts. The hops shine through in this beer more than most other macro produced amber lagers. This beer was a bit similar to Yuengling but perhaps a tad more hops in this one. I still like Yuengling a little better though."
"this is true to class and I was pleasantly surprised. glad to have it on draft, not sure I would enjoy as much out of the bottle. found it quite drinkable and would have again."
"I'm a huge fan of amber lagers but I'll pass on this one."
"Drinkable, but overall a very average amber ale."
"O - This is not a terrible beer, but I would probably not purchase it by the case."
"The days are getting longer and warmer and saw a Summer Sampler 12 pack $11.99 so I figure I would give it a go. I used to drink quite a bit of Leines back in my Coast Guard days(1997) in Duluth, MN. Leines was the first ""hand crafted micro brews"" I had ever tasted. We would buy in wax box bar cases. Pretty Awesome wish I could still do that. I thought it was the best back then but only now recognize it as a gateway beer to better beers. So thanks. Classic Amber is a great looking golden caramel. Pours with a great head that dissipates quickly. Tones of grains and apple. Taste water down but I guess you could make this a hot summer day light session beer. I always think Leinenkugel's is best enjoyed on a canoe or around a campfire."
"Pours a nice color, but a little light for an amber. Crystal clear, a light head and good carbonation. Smells of yeast and grain, but only very mildy. Taste is clean, but a little to smooth for this variety. Not alot of malts, and somewhat watery...So on the plus side, drinkability will be up."
"But left me with a full feeling and tired and a bad headache. Not something i would sit at a bar and order. Something new to try though."
"D: I had no problem consuming this beer but there was nothing special about the taste that would make me want to try another one."
"All in all....rather average I suppose. It doesn't excel nor offend in any way."
"D: Not really all that horrible, but I can't see that it's something I really want to drink again."
"It is pretty well balanced just not much flavor to speak of, a basic example of this style"
"Drinkability: Easy beer to drink. It would be good on a hot summer day. I was hoping for a little more flavor but overall pretty good."
"D: good evryday beer and one that should be enjoyed everyday."
"Not bad, but not great. It would do well when the selection is poor."
"Drinkability - nothing at all complex or interesting in taste, but at the same time not bad tasting. For its likely intentions, this beers is not a bad brew."
"Taste: Nothing too exciting but it is not bad. It has somewhat of a dry taste but without any bitterness."
"D: I am glad I did not purchase this beer, but drank it at a friend's house!"
"D - I didn't understand the hype behind this beer. It is just a dressed up macro offering. Not bad, but not good either."
"From bottle no. 01101-020936. Sampled on December 14, 2010. It pours a light amber color with a fizzy head that goes away in short order. The aroma is a bland mixture of grains and malts. The body is medium. The taste brings out the sweet malt character a bit more than in the aroma but it reminds me more of a pale ale rather than a red. It is just missing something."
"Drinkability: It is rare that my favorite element of a beer is the mouthfeel but that is the case with this one; otherwise, the flavor profile is clearly aimed at the middle of the road; not a bad beer by any stretch - just not something I am likely to seek out again"
"Overall I find this beer to be a good amber, it may be pretty hoppy for its style but it tends to benefit this beer. I drink this beer pretty often and I am glad Leinenkugels added this to their year round line up."
"This beer wins the ""Clown Award"" for funny taste. Why would I pay a premium price for a beer that tastes this bad? Rates very low on my scale. Avoid this one at all costs. Save your loot for a better beer. This is even worse than some of the big brewers mass-produced stuff."
"This beer pours out a nice amber color with a small head that has decent retention with very little lacing and moderate carbonation. When drinking this I get some malts in the taste with maybe a slight caramel taste and the last taste I get is a citrus taste which remains in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a medium mouthfeel that is a little sticky that clings to the tongue and lips. This is another Leinie's that is easy to drink and I do like it when a beer is easy to drink."
"Pours a moderate amber color with a single-finger white head that soon trickles down into nearly nothing. The nose has some toasted bread and some light caramel, as well as a faint hint of sweetness. The taste is a bit more sugary with some bread crust and light toast. Light-to-medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Pretty ordinary, but not bad."
"D- average drinkability, I would drink one if someone bought it for me but I probably won't buy it again."
"There are better Red Lagers out there, this one just runs in the middle of the pack."
"I like this beer. There is almost a sweet flavor to it, like brown sugar or something I can't put my finger on. There is a bit of an aftertaste, but it's not bad."
"drinkability is average. i'm not a big fan of this brewery's other beers, but this is something i could enjoy every once in a while"
"This is the definition of a mediocre beer. Nothing about it stands out as good, but nothing stands out as bad either. An inoffensive choice. You can do better."
"Hey, I like the colour. It pours a deep amber into my pilsner glass/ It was part of a Fall variety pack and probably one of the better choices. Smells better than my running shoes but not as good as some of my hoppy beers. I smell caramel and malts. Pours a deep head and laced some but dissipated quickly. Mouthfeel is average, nothing special but better than the typiacal macrobrew. Drinkability is fine, I could enjoy a few after a long run or bikeride; even some tennis. C+ Average-fine for guests; but not for close friends. Would not seek it out but I am a hopphead..."
"Meet me at the Leinie Lodge! The first CAN is on me!"
"Pours a very light amber/copper color with minimal head. Scent is very weak with a dominant metallic like scent over top of a burried grassy hop and musty light carmel scent. Taste doesnt improve on the scent much, metallic and some touches of butter and vegtables... these flavors burry an underlying nutty and grassy taste whith some brown sugar sweetness. Light bodied, spritzy. At first i thought it was off, but after reading the reviews, it may just not be anything more than an ok beer."
" ~ This is a decent beer and one I'm sure I will cross paths with again. Will I seek it out? Most likely not."
"D- This was a drinkable beer. I have had this a couple of times now and have grown to drink it. Although $1.25 for a glass is hard to beat. It's good for what it is and the drinkability is high for that matter."
"It's very malty, very smooth. 100% barley roasted just enough to wash away most of the breadiness but not enough to bring out any bitter nodes. The hops profile is surprisingly complex but far too faint."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied with a good deal of carbonation. Overall, I wasn't a huge fan of this beer but it wasn't terrible. Easy to session, for sure."
"D: In the same style as Yuengling, but it's nowhere near as good, but much more available. One of the few Leine's brands offered in CA. This beer is only marginally better than BMC, in fact I'd probably prefer a Coors Original over this."
"D: Fairly good drinkability. Not a particularly memorable beer."
"d- better than a standard adjunct, but not by much. a subpar beer from a mediocre brewery. if you're going for a leinie's get the 1888 Bock. Otherwise get an actual microbrew."
"i really enjoy this beer, im not a big fan of darker beers but this one is good"
"Serving type: Draft"
"Overall: Not an especially memorable beer. At the same time, as usual Leinie does not disappoint."
"RJT"
"Poured in a Bayern-Pilsener glass, copper-crystal color, no bubbles, foamy head with two fingers thick, good lacing. Smell: Toffee and biscuity malts. Taste: Toffe and nut malts combined with wood. Mouthfeel: Woody somewhat dry, bitter sweet, viscous body and high carbonation. Drinkability: The best red lager i've tried."
"D- pretty unremarkable. this isnt one i could have too many of, and i dont think ill be going back for more anytime soon."
"D: Great drinkability, this is a easy going beer, that could be enjoyed anytime of the year."
"Drinkability: A good effort and a nice beer on a summer night."
"D. A good brew nice carbonation, good balance, nothing extrordinary."
"Drinkability is pretty good, as this kind of dry but refreshing beer is very easy to drink after a long, hard day."
"Drinkability: This is an alright beer, good enough for parties or if nothing else is around, but not anything too special here. I wouldn't rush to get this again, but would suggest it as a gateway beer."
"I'll give Leinenkugel another chance, but with something else. Maybe their summer shanty, I heard it was pretty good."
"D: Low abv, and very refreshing, but it loses its appeal pretty quickly."
"Drinkability: Really the main feature of this beer. If you want something which goes down easily but doesn't taste terrible, this is a good choice."
"It actually looks pretty good, but the soapy smell is a killer, and the beer itself tastes a lot like a light toasty Märzen... they must be using those malts. The hops are pretty light here, there's a little bit of caramel and burnt toast, the beer gets grainy fast and there's a metallic finish with a medium mouthfeel. It's okay, washed down my Indian food well but nothing I'd seek out."
"Not a great brew but certainly better than a run of the mill macro."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear amber with a small big bubbled head that disapates rather quickly into a thin film with very minor lacing. A mild malted aroma but not much else. Very mild taste a bit biscuty and a very mild citrus finish. Very easy drinking beer. Not bad but also nothing remarkable."
"D- Goes down easy. Nothing that tastes terrible but pretty macro like."
"Light body, almost watery at times from the mineral taste. Medium-low carbonation."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are definitely several others in the style that I would choose first."
"I can't put my finger on it, but I just enjoy this beer. I don't think I'm gonna go looking for explanations, I'll just take it."
"D-Easy drinker and my go to beer from Leinenkugel's. A great summer beer."
"Overall: A pretty average beer. It has good flavors to it, but won't wow you or anything."
"D: Very drinkable. I used to swear by Leinenkugel's back in college days. Unfortunately many of the liquor stores have pushed its price pretty high because of micro brew popularity; and I would bet it's costing the same from the suppliers!!!"
"Drinkability - I can't think of a good reason to buy this again - it's pretty undistinguished."
"Overall seems to follow the pattern with all their offerings. Decent enough to get by, but nothing that is going to be earth shattering in anyway shape or form."
"A clear amber color pour with a short lasting two finger fizzy offwhite head , high carbonation , little to no lacing left . Aroma of cereal grain , dry wood and a hint at caramel . Flavor is pretty strait forward lightly malty and lightly bitter , a little spicy at the finish , crisp clean mouthfeel with a light body , I would call this quite drinkable and a decent enough offering ,"
"This was fairly basic, but unoffensive. I'd choose it over the average lager."
"Very flavorful yet light in body and on the palate. A very basic well balanced taste, malty with just enough hop presence to make it very drinkable."
"This feels pretty rich in carbonation and leaves the palate refreshed, not too bad for a sessionable lager."
"Drinkability - First one was good but I am a little afraid that the second one would not be so good but since I only had one I won't specualte and just say that is was good."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with amber hues and a small head. Smell is of malts and hops. Taste like it smells, caramel, malts and a bit of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent beer."
"Drinkablity: Disappointing brew from Leinenkugel. Serviceable, but could use a bit more work on the formula to improve the body and cover up the cheap ingredients."
"D: Bar I was at was having a special, and I thought it was good enough to have three times. If your looking for an affordable beer to have with some pals, Leinenkugels is usually a good choice."
"overall it is not that great of an amber ale, more on the lager side."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I could certainly drink this one again."
"D: I really don't care for this beer! Makes me want to grab some chips or peanuts. Something to get that after taste out of my mouth. I've talked to a lot of my northern neighbors who really like their ""Leinies"" but I guess I am just not a fan."
"overall, I dont think ill buy this one again but it was nice trying it"
"Drinkability- Nothing I was even tempted to reach for again that night at the bar or anytime soon, of this style there are just so many beers better out there you will have to not search out this one again, maybe my tap was bad or something but just kinda of a let down beer"
"Pours a light amber color with a white froth that dissipates somewhat quickly...for an amber, I would really like to see something darker...this almost looks like a pale ale. Simple aromas of grains, light red fruit, easy caramel, light skunkiness, roasted nuts, & subtle chocolate. It gets better as it warms, but not very impressive. The flavor of the beer is much better than the nose with characteristics of roasted hazelnuts, chocolate, caramel, grains, & subtle citrus hops. Overall, this is a very simple, straight forward beer that goes down easily. Not bad, but no something that I'll recommend."
"Another OK beer from Leinies....I buy Leinies expecting a solid session beer, and thats about it. Crisp clean tasting, a touch of roasted malt, after it warmed a bit I think I actually tasted dusted cocoa?! Carbonation was a little more than Med. Color is actually very appealing, head fades quickly leaving small amount of lacing as Im sipping, Tastes almost like their Octoberfest. Maybe with all the Big beers I've been drinking, im used to much more flavor? I think I'll have another."
"O: Not much going on. Pretty straight forward brew. This will appeal to many tasters, but comes off as a bit bland in my opinion."
"Not bad Amber Ale - however, was hoping for a little more flavor."
"Drinkability: Weak on taste. Don't bother with this one."
"It has been a long time since I've had a decent Leinenkugel's beer. While I have no desire to drink them all again for comparison's sake, my sense is that Classic Amber trails only Creamy Dark at the top of the Leinie's heap. Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout doesn't count... unless they brew it again."
"This bottle went down pretty easy. Good with my pizza. Better than BMC if the choices are limited at the local restaurant. This was ok but not great. Of the offerings from Leinenkugel I do like this and the Creamy Dark the best."
"This is the best product leine's has come out with in quite a while. Beer that tastes like beer, what a novel concept. It's not mixed with lemonade or berry flavoring or maple syrup, it's just good amber beer. It looks very nice, chrystal clear orangish copper. About two inches of off white foam that doesn't last long. The smell is very biscuit like, toasty malt with hops in the background. It's a little more watery than I would have expected. A lot of fizzy carbonation. All in all a nice solid amber. Nothing great, but solid. A good choice to wash down a burger at the tavern."
"Average, but sessionable at the local watering hole if you had no other choice."
"Notes: Of the many entries in the Leinie's lineup in recent years, this is one of my favorites. There's really nothing off about it (although the musty hops weren't exactly my cup of tea), and it's refreshing without being low on flavor. Solid, if thoroughly unspectacular, beer."
"All in all, a very average to above average beer. I'd rather have this than a BMC beer, but it's nothing exceptional either. Drinkable enough - you could pound these back while watching a game or playing cards. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing great either."
"Drinkability: Glad I tried it to get it out of the way but it isn't something I could drink regularly."
"Nothing horrible, but I'm glad I didn't buy a full six pack of this (just got a single in a mix pack)."
"Drinks fairly easy, nothing earth-shattering , but I could happily drink 3-4 of these watching football or BBQing. One of Leinies better mainstream offerings"
"D-Very easy to drink, but not terribly enthralling."
"D - Easy enough to get down, but I didn't care for the taste. Could do a lot of these watching football and eating pizza, but really will be avoiding this one."
"On a side note, I'm still amazed that I bought a 12 pack of this for $6 at Supreme Liquors in Quincy, MA. 6 packs were $3. Pretty friggin' good pricing on an average brew."
"Pours a reddish brown color with some orange tint with a nice white to slightly off white head to it. The smell is of caramel and some other sweet malts. The smell is pleasant and enjoyable. The taste is of some bread malts and some caramel and some other sweet malts, the taste however, is slightly watery and doesn't pack as much a punch as I hoped for. The mouthfeel is good, it is very lightly carbonated. The drinkability is okay, the first two I thought it was very drinkable however, on the third the flaws were more present."
"this beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy off white head that diminishes pretty quickly to a thin lace. the aroma gives off a bit of sweet malt in conjunction with the lagery esters, it's better than bad. the taste delivers on the sweet malt right up front, with a bit of breadiness as well. the light highly carbonated mouthfeel make this a pretty easy drinking beer."
"a nice intro beer."
"This beer is light enough for a session, but the lack of any defining characteristics left me disappointed."
"Overall this is very close to bud American ale and twice the price. While I am happy that leinenkugel is doing real beers this one just isn't that good."
"Overall, not anything I expected. I've never liked Leinenkugel brews and I thought this one might change my mind, but I'm once again left dissapointed."
"Leinenkugel's Classic Amber pours an amber color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I get mostly malt in the aroma with a touch of bitterness that doesn't smell especially hoppy. The flavor is malty, I get some biscuit like flavors. There is some bitterness, but the hops really are in the background mostly just adding balance. Decent, sessionable beer."
"This is light and drinkable."
"It's not great, but it's not bad. It's decent, but don't expect more out of this."
"Not bad, a decent no frills ""beer"""
"Drinkability is good but one could find a better beer. Still quite quaffable."
"D -- Not a bad, no nonsense drinker. I'd even grab a sixer at a less-than stellar sale -- I opted for a case after the first $2.99 six-pack (sorry ChainGangGuy!)."
"Overall a pretty mellow average beer, a good amount of malt presence, coppery taste, a too sweet and bland malty finish for my liking. I will not seek this beer out again."
"This beer is light and easy to drink, but not very tasty."
"This would be an easy beer to session. I personally would not, but could see how others would."
"Drinkability: While it goes down smooth and easy, it is terribly basic, generic, and simple. One and done for me."
"D: Drinks like an adjunct amber with a bad, tart fizzy orange soda like quality with a weak, watery hop presence makes this a big pass. Only gets worse progressively while you drinking. Honestly found this to be a defamation of character against all American ambers. Better suited as a drain cleaner."
"Drinkability: This would be a very respectable everyday lager. Perhaps the best Leinie's I have had."
"D- Easy to drink there's just nothing really exciting going on here. Not bad but not good."
"Something a bit ""off"" here. I suppose they tried to give it a more modern twist on a ""classic"" style, but came up with a sweet and bitter brew that is mediocre-ish. Overall- not ""bad"" but not too ""good"" either."
"We are so deprived here in MS, but I got excited when I saw this Leiney offering. I've spent many summers in Chippewa Falls and have been through that brewery. Was a little disappointed in the overall product. It has a nice orangy-brown color and you could smell the hops rather nicely, but to me it seemed like an almost caramel taste that was overpowering and a rather strong smoky aftertaste. Guess I'll just have to stick with my Sam Adams for now..."
"Bits of doughy malt in the aroma, light and subtle. Taste is along those lines also, with a nice balance of spicy hop in the finish. Nothing outstanding, nothing bad about this beer. Fits the Leiny style of beers - cheaper beers just across the craft border from BMC land."
"D: Nothing real great or real bad about this beer. It did not impress me and it finishes a bit to bitter and dry for what I want out of an amber ale. Cost was cheap and makes it seem worth it."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability/overall: medium carbonation, slight tangy sensation on the tongue kinda speads around the entire mouth. pretty good drinkablity; half way thru my first one i felt that i could have 5 of these comfortably, but when i finished my 3rd, i changed my mind. Overall, this beer is pretty good and has some potential to be better."
"I typically agree with the assertion that Leinenkugel's makes a great ""bridge"" to the world of craft beers. This beer is somewhat in line with this reasoning; it's good but not great. The flavor and balance are good, but there's nothing that really stands out as exceptional. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's simple, but it's worth trying."
"Notes - Refreshing after a hot day. Not exciting, but a good solid amber."
"D) Just alright. Drink it in a pinch but not a standout. The taste runs a little thin and lacks character."
"Given to me by my brother-in-law for my birthday. Thanks Mark."
"Dark golden/light amber beer..darker than that in the picture. Tight bubbly off white head. Aroma mostly toffeeish malts, slight milky smell in the back. Pretty balanced lager here..had a quite nice semi-swet malt taste and a ""buzz' of hops overlayed. OK mouthfeel..quite dry in the end. Drinkable enough beer."
"Light copper/amber color with a modest white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is toasted grains, a bit of caramel and herbal hops. The taste is light toasted malt, hints of caramel, with enough herbal hops to balance well. Nothing particularly exciting, but easy to drink. Light bodied and fairly smooth, should be a reasonable refresher after mowing the grass or for washing down some barbeque."
"Drinkability: I generally like Leinenkugel's beers. That being said I am kicking myself for buying a six of this as opposed to a single. The taste here is not overly strong and seems like their fireside nut brown minus the sweet flavor. For an amber this just doesn't stand out."
"Edit: Upon further review it seems a tad sour like some apple cider that's gone bad."
"2 thumbs down for this one."
"Copper colored with a puffy white head that lasts awhile and leaves a few blobs of airy foam behind. Toasted grain and mild leafy hops make up the nose. Sweet malt with just enough hop bittering to balance. A light bodied beer that is easy enough to drink, at least there are no berries in this one."
"Light to medium bodied, a decent amber."
"Pours a very light copper color, not as deep as I like, but the huge head and bubbles help, as well as the decent lacing. Malty scent, very sweet with that slight skunky aroma you get from macro lagers. Nice flavor, extremely sweet, mostly malt with just a slight hop bite and a slight skunkiness at the end. Very bubbly but not rough, goes down fine if overly sweet."
"On tap at a local watering hole.Came in a standard pint glass a chill hazed lighter shade of amber with a thinner white head.Muted aromas just a hint of toasted grain and a passing whif of caramel.Standard amber lager flavors toasted with some sweeter caramel,this just have a slight bite in the finish like an herbal smack but its still par for the course.Not anything to write home about,its standard and rather blah."
"D: Makes for a pretty decent sessionable lager. Good buy for a party if you want to have something more than BMC but don't want to break the bank."
"I don't seem to have much luck with Leinie's brews. However, I would take this over a Bud in a heartbeat."
" I was excited to see a different Amber lager around, but it's not up to par for me."
"Not a very good beer at all. Not a ""dumper", but will never buy again!!!"
"D: Drank 2 of these pretty quick. Kind of uninspiring. Boring."
"Infinitely drinkable. This is a light yet characterful interpretation of a played-down style. A nice, thirst-quenching lager that is clean, balanced and inoffensive."
"The taste is toasty grain, hints of citrus, grass, metal. It has luight sweetness followed by light bit lingering bitterness that is a little on the unpleasantly sharp side. The hoppy bitterness is rather bland, with weak hop character, but has light citrus and bitter grass elements. It has a faint hint of thin caramel. I don't quite get the artificial citrus element that some seemed to complain about, but I can kind of get a sense of why people describe it this way. It certainly is not the strong, obvious (to me) artificial citrus of things like Leinenkugel's own Sunset Wheat or Lost Coast's Great White. Compared to some other basic, American amber/red lagers (like Dundee's Honey Brown, which I find far inferior to this), this is pretty good but like the others it really is little more than a more caramelly pale lager in character."
"I don't look at ""drinkable"" as ""how many can you pound down?"" This is a pretty bland offering and I don't see myself cracking into the rest of the 6-pack. Wasted my money. So, drinkable? Not really. I hope my wife likes it..."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a bone dry scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. There is a slight metallic aroma as well. The taste is average. It has a very lackluster malt character along with a super dry, metallic finish. It lists four different hops on the bottle, but I'm not picking up any. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer needs to be scrapped and reconfigured."
"Overall this beer was a big dissapointment. I am glad I only purchased a single. However, I could see myself trying this beer again in a couple of years or if there is nothing else to choose from."
"Pours a crystal clear amber colour. Imagine that. Large head dies quickly and leaves zero lace. I dont expect lace from most lagers so I wasnt disapointed. Aroma is citrusy with a touch of caramel and biscuit. Flavour is at first light, sweet caramel that transitions into a suprising citrus hop character. Finish is slightly malty sweet/biscuity. Medium bodied and super easy to drink. Probably the best Leinies beer I have ever had. Nothing too complex or in your face. Just a nice, moderatley hoppy, all malt amber lager. Nice job Leinenkugels."
"Drinkability is probably the most appealing part of this beer. The beer has a good balance and not a lot of crazy taste, so it makes it go down fairly easy. There is more alcohol in this than most beers of this taste, so you can put down a good amount without really noticing the heat."
"Not a particularly good finish, some of the flavor is too artificial to be very drinkable, but ok."
"This looked somewhat similiar (maybe a little less orange) in the pour to the Nugget Nectar I just finished off. Clearly this is where any and all analogous comparisons end. Granted, I'm only comparing the color, because the styles are the same in name alone. Malty caramel smell with a hint of sweetness. Kinda reminds me of a macro making a stab at something that looks the part, but won't offend the masses with too much taste. I'll not be buying this in the future."
"This beer is uninspired and uninspiring. Even the free appetizers and the short-shorts-wearing Leinenkugel girls, mingling among the patrons at the bar, could not redeem this ordinary beer."
"On-tap at Fox & Hound after watching Beer Wars, reviewed first as the place was too noisy and crowded to take notes. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp light amber with a decent head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a hint of amber malt, but not much else. Taste is just a hair above Yuengling. The beer is light and crisp, but just as watery as I've come to expect from these guys. This one was just what I expected, nothing I'd try again."
"real sharp"
"On tap in tall pilsner at Chili's. Appears clear orange amber with slight head that is not very tight plenty of carbonation rising. Smells slight malts - damp grain. Tastes like an amber I suppose but malty not much roast little to no finish - served too cold - dimishes ability to taste. I don't like calling beers watered down versions but I always do. I guess if you poured an amber like cap and served it with ice this is what it would taste like - fairly drinkable - although makes me want the real thing. Again leines are good introduction beers for friends to transition out of adjuncts."
"Pours a golden color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight yeast cleanliness, some hop notes are present, and some sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an high carbonation level. Tastes of strong yeast cleanliness up front, then slight hops , some sweet malt comes through next, and a slight grain flavor (causes a dry quality). The after taste is not very pleasant, but otherwise its a decent beer. Overall, a easy drinking, slightly bodied ale."
"It has been a few years since I last had a Leinenkugel's beer, as I don't live in the midwest any longer. This seems to be a newer beer, possibly more for ""export"" from the midwest. They messed up with the hops, and put too much carbonation in here, I'm sorry to say. The Amber Light is a superior beer to this one. Unfortunate that this is the taste of Leinenkugel's that most will encounter, when they actually have some really nice beers."
"I've been on an amber kick so I thought ""what the hell?"" I poured into a pint glass to little head that quickly receded. The smell was malty with some fruitiness. The taste was even worse than the Moe's Backroom Amber that I had two nights ago. I have to say that I am disappointed in this attempt at an amber."
"Comes out of the tap a clear orangy amber with a thin white head. Aroma is fairly strong and malty, rather lagerish, with an undertone of banana. Flavor is crisp, mainly malty, and has a hint of hops and a touch of fruity sweetness. Texture is tingly and rough, and leaves a malty and slightly bitter aftertaste."
"D - This is a good brew for washing down a burger or a few spicy chicken wings when your taste buds aren't able to fully appreciate a really good brew. This isn't bad, it's just pretty boring."
"Poured a deep yellow color, maybe more like orange with a small white head but it disappeared quickly. Nose is simple, lightly malty, some hops and even grainy. Taste is thinner than I expected. Caramel malt, syrupy, maybe even like a dash of maple syrup. Mouthfeel is thin. Drinkability is ok but I wont buy again."
"The aroma is not bad it's citrus hops, malt, and a mild nuttiness. The appearance is light amber with a medium head. The flavor on the other hand is astringent with a dry nutty finish. The palate is watery. A horrible beer. I would not recommend this to anyone for any reason."
"D-This is one half a good beer....I really like what they did with the munich malt...I do not like the hopping...overall it is ok but could have been a lot better.."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Not my favorite style but I could come back to it in the future."
"A decent drinkable brew, not too over the top, but definitely something sort of unique here. Worth a taste."
"Pours a nice looking copper body with a small one-finger white head. Smells hoppy earthy and some strong caramel notes. Tastes about the same as smell. Sweet caramel and malts hit upfront turning into an earthy tone fused with some hops which only become stronger in the hoped bitter finish. Carbonation is about standard but overall it's a pretty drinkable beer. Well done."
"Appearance is okay, nothing impressive. Nicely balanced nose and palette. Nothing special, but solid. Feel is non-offensive, light but present and accounted for. Pretty much, a run-of-the-mill amber (which is not a bad thing), with just a bit of extra hop. Overall, solid quaff."
"For the price point with today's expensive beers at $6.99 a six pack a really good deal especially in the Chicago area. Will buy again."
"Just a beer really. Not much of anything to recommend it sort of boring. In about the same class as Budweiser American Ale."
"Pours a clear amber, zero head retention, lacing for an inch. Smell: astringent graininess, bread, faintest of caramel. Taste: pale malt, grainy, brief appearance by some Munich-ish malts, and a jumbled mess of the hops they list on the label. Thin and overly carbonated. A messy stab at an all malt lager, with a name that doesn't fit."
"Pours a clear amber orange color with a large white head that left very light lacing. Aroma is grainy, lightly bready, nothing special, pretty much like Leinie's Red. Flavor isn't bad. There's a nice hop bite too it, pretty well balanced, although it could use a little more umph. Caramel is light, some grainy breadiness is there. Just nothing special. Body is actually a bit more sturdy than I expected. A fairly drinkable beer."
"At least on tap, I didn't get much of a head or lacing to speak of. I think it was a little flat due to a tap line issue or some such. The color was a clear amber with an orange tint. The aroma is malt with some wheat / grains. The taste follows suit. It's light and none too complex. Balance isn't perfect but it's not too off. Mouthfeel is above average. It isn't particularly thin and is pretty smooth. The finish is somewhat dry with a touch of hops. To be honest, this is quite session able but I think the appearance might be better if I poured this myself from a bottle and it was fresher."
"Overall, another letdown from Leines. I was hoping thing would be similar to an amber ale, but it reminded me a lot of a lager. The last three brews have been major letdowns to me (1888, Classic Amber, and Fireside). I am hoping they can step it up and put out something a little better."
"This beer poured a copper color with a big head. The smell is pretty subtle and after a while I've decided that it kind of smells like some malt and that's about it, I have no idea how they made a beer that smells so little. The taste is depressingly similar to the smell, just a spurt of lightly toasted malt at the start that gives away to a bit of hops that lead into a clean finish. Not unpleasant, but very boring. The mouthfeel is watery with some fine carbonation. You can drink the hell out of a six-pack of this beer, but I'm not sure why you would. Not a horrible beer, but I certainly wouldn't call it a good version of the style."
"Bottle pour into pint glass. Nice moderate white head, carbonated. Clear amber color with good, definite malt aroma. Well balanced, roasted malts, caramel notes. Very slight hint of hops in the finish. A good session beer. Overall a good effort from Leiny- - Cheers!"
"I poured this nicely finished beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice amber (light) color and it poured a pretty nice head that lasted a decent amount of time. The lacing of the beer was also fair. The smell was not so great I thought and smelled sour. But the taste was not so it was all good. Taste was nutty slightly and hinty of toffee. I liked the beer."
"Pretty generic amber beer, like you'd get at a generic brewpub, or any generic late 80s or early nineties micro. Just... generic."
"D-Easy to drink, this brew is not complex, but it has a pure, clean taste. Beer advocates might not be blown away, but this might be a good ""gateway beer"" for macro fans. I had this on tap for free at the Old Fashioned in Madison, WI. Damn shame how few people I saw leaving tips."
"D - Easy drinking but the flavor would get old very quickly to me."
"This new brew pours a light copper color with a quickly diminishing thin white head. The aroma is mainly malty, some grainy and bready character, along with a hint of roast and a hint of hops. The flavor is moderately malty with a hint of roast at the swallow. Hop bitterness and carbonation balance the beer from being sweet. The body is a bit thin and mouthfeel is a bit prickly from the carbonation. Overall not a bad beer, worth a shot, on the better end of their offerings."
"Drinkability: Like pretty much all the Leinie products, very drinkable. Not going to stand out in a crowd, but better than the macros that cost the same in the stores (one nice thing about living 10min. from their brewery and probably adds some bias to my review) so I'd be more than happy to drink it all night long."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is barely ""amber", it's more like golden with copper highlights. Perfectly clear, there is a pillowy white head that leaves bits of lacing around the glass. The smell is very underwhelming; sweet amber malt is about all I get out of it, maybe just a hint of hops. The flavor is similar - underwhelming. There is a sweet amber malt presence with a slight mingling of toasted victory grain and hops just to balance. The finish is slightly bitter but no real hop presence. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with an almost chewy carbonation. Overall, not an impressive beer but not bad either. I would definitely have this over most macros but it would lose in the face of any other decent micro."
"Small to nil off-white head. Clear light amber with decent carbonation. Little bit of hop bitterness on the finish. It may not have any adjuncts in it, but everything about the smell and taste is very ""macro-ish"". Will not buy again. Will not suggest to others."
"Appearance is bland. Red in color but a little lighter than expected. Very little head and no notable lacing. Smell and taste is ok, very similar to their fireside- but a bit sweeter and an odd metallicy taste. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, some carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"There is a bit of a nut flavor note in the finish. I agree with others here. There is too much packaged over pricing on this one. If this were a few dollars cheaper, it would be worth picking up, now and then."
"Purchased at Bruno's at the Summit in Birmingham. Nice amber color to this one with a slight off-white head. Smells malty with very little hops coming through. The taste is exactly the same. While malty and decently flavored, there are not many hops present at all. I would not be quite as harsh in my review if the label hadn't proclaimed 4 kind of hops inside. I just can't find them. On a brighter note, this beer is drinkable and sessionable. Still better than most big macro brews."
"Drinkable average brew"
"I'm not going to detail every aspect of this new ""flavor"" of Leinies. It's been reported that this beer is being ""slotted"" (by Leinies) as competition against Sam Adams on the national scale. I found it to be very 'generic' for a ""micro"" or ""niche"" brew. Flavor's OK, nothing outstanding. Drinkable. To me though, it's just ""beer", nothing that justifies the price point it's being marketed at. I'm willing to pay a premium for some of their specialties (Oktoberfest, Creamy Dark), but IMO, this isn't ""special", and shouldn't be priced as such."
"Also, this is categorized wrong. It's a lager, not an ale, and I graded it as such."
"D - This is by no means the best amber ale around, but it is very easy-drinking and sessionable."
"This is an easy drinker and would be a good crossover beer for just about anyone. Its not geeky, but is well made with no obvious flaws or shortcomings."
"D - Easy to drink, ABV is manageable and the flavors are light. Carbonation is a downside here as I feel it becoming very filling and bothersome to the mouth."
"Pours a pale crystal clear amber with a large off white head bubbles form quickly and collar of lace is left in thin uneven formations. Aromatics offer up a mildly sweet light toasted malt character with just a kiss of citrus hops. Flavor is quite disappointing same Leinenkugel generic ""craft"" brew flavor. Some sweet malts divide with a touch of herbal and citrus hops, 100 percent malt with actual hop character let's kick this up a few notches and do away with the Leine yeast strain. Defnitely unoffensive in every way, body is extremely light and somewhat fizzy but not cloyingly so. Goes down smooth pretty effortlessly, it just hits as more of the same."
"I think this is a winner from leinenkugel's"
"Btw, head retention was above average and there's *some* lacing."
"Wow, not very impressed after the local hype on this one."
"This beer pours a clear gold color. I guess Leinenkugel wants me to believe ""classic amber"" is actually gold. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing quickly. The aroma is of the same generic caramel malt that is present in most of Leinies beers. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, this beer tastes very similar to Leinies other beers. Dull would be a good word to describe it. I can't see myself drinking this one again."
"I was hoping for more than what I got, I decided that the beer would be a better one. I really like Liene beers they are pretty good, the summer brew is one of the great beers that I have had. I really would like to try the different beers that are offered by Lieni. I am sure It would be one of the best beers ever."
"Another fairly good interesting beer from the north woods."
