"This is a tasty and easy drinking lager beer, but with some complexity from toasted malt and hops.  Well worth a try."
"8/11...pours deep amber, very light layer of foam that settles out. Reddish. Rich caramel nose with malt. Taste is a higher malt concentration, lightly sweet, bready, and toffee too. Mild carbonation. Very smooth, backed with a tasty malt profile."

"A tasty amber lager. Nothing particularly memorable, but a solid beer's beer."

"I could definitely session this beer all day - it reminds me a lot of Boston Lager, except I think this Full Sale offering tastes and feels superior, especially on the finish. I'll be seeking out more for sure."
"LTD #5 is a solid beer and has lots of characteristics that remind me of my all-time favorite amber: Full Sail Amber. After the initial let down of a nose no better than you're average middle-of-the-road ""craft"" (e.g. Dundee) lager, I was pleasantly surprised to find a relatively complex and interesting flavor profile. I would consider adding this (probably as a last option) to a mix-a-six again."

"Apperance of a nice deep red orange. Condensed foamy thick head, did not dissipate too quick. Smells of roasted malt some marshmellows. Roasted malt of coffee and dark chocolate off the bat, maybe even marshmellows, smooth lager finish, not even week at 6 percent abv. Barely any hop bitterness, like the malty dominance. Good medium body mouth feel with great carbonation, it does look like a mini aquarium in my mug of bubbles like a good beer should, who likes a flat beer huh? Overall a good brew especially for the red or amber beer color fans."
"Overall – A rather pleasant and easy drinking amber ale."

"The Verdict: Not bad. Fairly well balanced, it does a decent job of trying to convert you to lagerism as the label suggests. Not the best example, but I'll take it over a Samuel Adams."

"Low C+"

"A pretty good lager."
"The body was nicely smooth and full, a bit creamy and had a medium finish. Drinkability was OK, but that odd taste was a bit off-putting. Overall, not a terrible beer, but one not up to the standards of the rest of the LTD series. Probably worth a shot if you see it, but not worth hunting down at all."

"this taste more of a fall beer then summer frist smell frist taste is crispy a smooth beer going down but enjoy this beer but their other out that dont remind you of fall roastly dont taste it i mostly drink dark beer they say what they put in it i dont taste it"

"O: This is a good version of the style. Maybe a touch too sweet to earn higher scores, but a good, flavorful (and colorful) lager."
""
""
"O- A very complex and rich tasting vienna lager. This is the best of the style that I have ever had, really great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very flavorful lager with the flavor of malt, spicy hops and hops bitterness all balanced."
""
""
"Overall, a tasty lager but not one that really stands out from the pack. Really reminded me of SA Boston Lager. I would pick it up again if I saw it."
"Malty up front. I'm getting caramel and toasted malts mostly. Slight bitterness along with earthy-herbal hops. Crisp finish. Medium-light bodied, carbonation is nice."
""
"I like the malt profile on this one quite a bit...just enough sweetness on a cocoa, hazelnut, caramel flavor. Kiss of leafy hops add the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is decent with an appropriate carbonation. This is my favorite in the LTD series since the very first one. It is kind of somewhere in between a dunkel and an amber lager. I wish I would have found this one earlier in the summer, I would’ve bought it on more than one occasion, that’s for sure."
""
"I expect this beer to be light and crisp, but this beer is too spritzy and lacks smoothness. It's not bad, per se, and the smoothness does come in with the carbonation after the bite of the fizziness backs off a little, but it's still too much."
"This beer strikes me as muddled and uninteresting. It's kind of just ""there."" Nothing really inspiring or, sorry to say, interesting going on here. It's a beer. Amber lager, yeah great. Blah blah. Snoozer."
""
""
""
"O - This was an okay red lager. Nothing too exciting but it is very sessionable."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, the aroma promised more than the flavor delivered. A bit cloyingly sweet and lacking hop presence in the flavor."
""
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the grain and grass, with not too much else going on. The flavor is similar. The toffee and grain notes really stand out, with some grass from the hops thrown in. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: This beer is quite malty but is rather easy to drink."
"Taste-Toasted malt,spiciness, caramel. Smooth, flavorfull, and sessionable. A good ""crossover"" craft brew. A ""pre-prohibition"" style lager that would go great with a couple og grilled hot dogs."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip / fluted glass. This pours a dark amberish brown with a short lived off white head. The smells are of light crisp malts not any real hop presence. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, not real strong, a little nutty, light hops, didn't convert me to lagers that's for sure."
"Pours a cola looking brown with an amber hue. Slight brown head as it poured but by the time I put the cup down there was no head to speak of. A very sweet, sugar candy aroma with some brown sugar and a hit of hay that I associate with lager. Flavor starts off sweet with some brown sugar and candy, a little lager yeast comes in mid stream, and it closes out with the sugary sweetness with some herbs. A little too sweet for me in general. Thinnish to medium bodied bodied. Overall, meh."

"Overall - Decent beer. Not really digging the herbal qualities presented here. Drinkable, but I probably won't buy again."
"Pours a clear dark amber/copper with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, slight caramel, and an interesting earthy, herbal hop flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice mouthfeel but probably not something I would go after again."

"This is amber lager is very easy to drink. And is one of the few dark beers that is great for the summer time. Very refreshing, crisp, and very easy to drink."
""
"A solid brew for Full Sail. One of there better ones."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a becker a full rich deep bronze color with a well defined sticky 1/2 finger off white head,what great color and clarity.Alot of German malty goodness in the nose with toasty bread and a bit of iron to go with sweetish caramel.Crisp toasty bread on the palate with mild caramel sweetness in the finish,a smattering of leafy hops as well.This is a great amber lager,to me it has a little marzen in it with crisp bready malt,and iron/mineral notes.A great lager,this should be much higher rated in my humble opinion."
""
"Drinkability - The wonderful texture of this ale made it worth drinking."
""
"Mouthfeel is full and pleasant. Overall, not bad at all."
""

"A so-so lager offering. Not bad, but really wound up lacking with any distinctive malt flavors. Sure, I'd drink it again, but wouldn't hesitate to pass it up for a more flavorful alternative."
"Pours a nice medium red-orange amber. Light off white head and a bit of lacing. Looks nice. Mild, slightly sour sweet malt and wheat aroma, hint of grain. Light spicy hop finish. Light bodied and very subdued flavor. Light malt, nuts, light fruit. Tastes like a decent lager that has been somewhat watered down. The taste that is there is pleasant, but faded. Might do in a pinch."
"DRINKABILITY: This beer is definitely repeatable and easily drinkable, particularly on a hot day. It reminds me somewhat of Magic Hat Vinyl. It provides good value for the cost and I'd probably buy it again but wouldn't necessarily seek it out."
"This is a pretty good beer, especially after it warms up. I could have downed a couple more, but this was part of a mixed 6-pack."
""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper color that had some amber highlights that could be seen when held up to the light. The off-white head retained itself rather well and it left bands of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, bready malt, yeast, hints of nuts and some green/grassy hops. The flavors were similar with the sweet malt coming first followed by notes of bread and biscuits as well as yeast and then at the end the pleasant bitterness of floral hops. As it warmed up I detected some notes of citrus in the hop finish as well but they were still delicate enough to compliment the malt elements. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation good."
""
"O: Not a bad Redm but nothing crazy different about it. Good clean Red with a good ABV. If you like Red's you will like this one."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"The taste is of a traditional ""red""--lots of crystal malt flavors (without much sweetness). There's enough hop to give some balance, but it is really a malt brew. Compared to most Ambers, I'd say the body is on the thinner side."
"This isn't the best Amber I've had and because it tasted and felt strong, I wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. It's a good effort on Full Sail's behalf but it's just a bit dark and not hoppy enough to fit the bill. By itself, this is a good beer to kick back with after a long day."
"O - Sacrilegious to say this, perhaps, but this is very similar to, and certainly no better than, Killiians Red."
"A good lager."
"Clear dark amber, almost brown with a three finger foamy off white head. Head lasts about five minutes and leaves good lacing. Smell is grainy malts. Taste is sweet caramel malts and just barely enough hops. Easy drinking, with just enough carbonation for proper mouthfeel. A bit of spicy leathery hops on the back of the tongue. Medium bitter/ sweet finish. Overall a very fine amber. Good job Full Sail."
"Overall: not bad at all. It seems like it is better than the sum of its parts; it reminds me of a nice Mexican Vienna lager, but a bit drier. I'd have this again."
"I'm a big fan of Full Sail, but this one misses the mark for me"
"I can't say that I really love amber ales, so the entreaty to 'convert to lagerism' kind of falls on deaf ears. However, with the solid biscuit/cracker nature of a good lager, and the colour and bearing of a standard red ale - this is indeed a decent gateway beer - for the rare extant craft drinker who only has had lager up to this point."
"Overall, a decent warm weather/session brew, but still not complex enough to make me ""convert to lagerism"" as the bottle states."
"An easy drinker, but nothing special here"
"Overall not bad, nothing special, the lager yeast doesn't play as well with the toasted caramel malts, a little syrupy, and seems like the lager yeast was rushed a bit as it didn't add as many great lager flavors as usual, and hints of an off flavor. Also where are the hops?"
"O: I thought this was one of the better LTDs to come through, although I have liked most of them pretty well. This amber lager really slams the malt aroma and flavor and provides it in a highly creamy, drinkable brew."
"The beer pours a light amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a dry, malty scent that boasts of sweet caramel malts and light biscuit malt breadiness. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth, bready flavor. It goes down easy with a touch of sweetness and a dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good amber lager. It's complex, yet highly drinkable."
"Overall: If more brewers would put as much effort into their amber ales and lagers as Full Sail has done, the style wouldn't be waning. Quite pleasant. Certainly worth trying."
"O) A decent brew. Nice flavor profile. I'd definitely drink another."
"Overall it's pretty decent, but not outstanding. I'd probably try it on tap if I saw it somewhere, but I doubt I'll buy a six-pack again."
"Picked this one up as part of a mixed six-pack. It's ok. I don't really like it that much, but my other beer isn't cold yet, so it's better than no beer at all. It smells clean, and the lightly bitter finish is refreshing, but there's something in the malt profile I don't like and can't quite put my finger on. I suppose it goes down just fine as long as I'm not thinking about it."
"D - Pretty mild, slighy malty after taste."
"Pours amber with a finger of resilient off-white head. Sweet malt, a little red hot candy and some apples to the nose. Sweet and a bit grainy to the tongue with a slight hop edge at the end. Light to medium bodied, well balanced and smooth going down. Great summertime brew right here from a series that always satisfies this Full Sail fan."
"OA: Good brew, nothing great, but nothing bad or overpowering as well."
"pretty good. I'd drink again, but not seek out."
"Overall: I'll be honest, it's a skosh reminiscent of Magic Hat's Vinyl, which is certainly fine, as I enjoyed that one as well. A mighty tasty malty red lager."
"I picked this one up as part of a mixed six pack just the other day. Poured a dark amber color with a good sized white head. Slightly metallic aroma, along with sweet malt and some hops. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and drinkable, with flavors of sweet malt, caramel and hops."
"Aroma is not strong but still malty and slightly fruity, just a little appealing. It pours a dark brownish amber with a thick, fluffy white head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor is malty with a fruity undertone, mainly pear, and just a touch of hops. Texture is fairly smooth, just a little fizzy. I’m not a big fan of lagers, but this is pretty good."
"Drinkability is very high. This is a quaffable beer, a solid session offering."
"(12oz bottle). Pours clear amber with off-whtie head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma has florals, sweet caramel and fresh cut grass. Taste is sweet with more caramel malts and some light bittering hops. Medium bodied with a slick/oily texture. Finish is smooth and slightly bitter. A pretty good beer although its a little maltier than I prefer. Still, I could drink a couple of these. Nice job."
"D: Decent drinkability, one or two, but doesn’t come off as session style or one that defines a style. Overall a limited beer that is limited in spectrum and comes off a bit ordinary."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with light carbonation, a watery feel and a very light body. Decent beer, boring overall, but still only decent at best."
"O: A little sweet for my personal taste, but a very good example of the style. This is the third of the LTD's I have had and believe they offer high quaility for value."
"Pretty flavorful Red Lager. This holds it's own in the style. Good malt presence. This is a keeper."
"Overall I would not recommend this beer. It must have been a boring accident because this beer is not exciting nor would I session it"
"T: Lagers of any kind aren't really my thing, but this one isn't terrible. Probably my favorite of the three LTDs I've tried. The taste is much sweeter than I expected with a lot of caramel malt and a hint of something that almost tastes like cotton candy. The finish has some grassy and slightly metallic tasting hops and a bit of bready malt."
"O: Good flavor. Good balance. Sessionable beer for sure."
"I always find Full Sail to be a good value even if they aren't the best in their style. I think I've probably had three sixers if this already since it's only $6. Amber in colo of course with a smell like lager, sort of earthy too. Taste is decent, a little bready and easily distinguished as a Full Sail beer, maybe it's the malt? Overall, an easy sipper and a good value."
"Drinkable I guess if you like the style. I am more of an ale drinker, and this one won't get me to switch."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very malty, and sweet. The taste is malty/sweet. Medium Body. This is a pretty tasty Amber Lager, nice job FS."
"While not my top favorite of the LTD series, I have liked them all. I wonder why Full Sail doesn't jettison their regular and not very interesting beers and make these the lineup."
"Overall: A decent beer but nothing I'm going to miss."
"Overall a nice beer, incredibly drinkable, great smell, and pretty decent taste"
"Overall, not much to look at, but is fairly well done. Doesn't have a large amount of hops, but I still find it to be good."
"overall: I like it. Very different from any other beers I've had. Reminds me of a cloudy hefewizen but slightly citrusy. I have a female relative who is very picky about what beers she likes and I think she'd like this very much! Giving it a thumbs up, Good Job FULL SAIL!"
"All in all, this is a pretty impressive offering from the LTD series... and my favorite one in a few years. I can easily see picking up a sixer of this one again."
"Pleasant amber flavors on the initial sip imply that the subtle aromas are minor distractions. Light caramel and some hop spice are evident yet without the fuller body of an ale, as implied. Finishes with a bit of light chocolate and dry hazelnut. Still relatively full in body for an Amber Lager and with a firm and dry spicy finish. Stands up to warming fairly well given its relatively coarse structure."
"Overall, not bad, but not great."
"I'm really liking this lager. Great value and quality. Easy drinking but rich. With all the fantastic, bold ales coming out of the US, it's nice to see that these guys can still put together an impressive lager."
"This is one of the better lagers I have tried in a while and I think I'll be a little disappointed when its gone."

"D: Very good drinkability. Simple flavors with a sweet malty flair. Very balanced."
"Bottle stamped 052411-15:41-FL. Sampled on March 26, 2011. The pour is a deep and clean amber tone with orange hues. A quick fizzy head emerges then disappears. The aroma is vibrant with rich, toasted malts and a little bit of a yeasty chaser. The body runs in the medium range. I very much enjoyed its sweet, malty taste, which seemed to capture what I like best about Amber Ales. Easy to drink."
"Overall- I loved it! This is my second time trying the LTD series. I tried 4, which I also like. This one is a little different from 4. This is a lager with sort of an ale personality. You still get the lager body and taste. This is a very drinkable beer. I will have my fair share until they stop making this."
"Easy drinking, not complex, but still tasty. That wins with me."
"Pours an dark amber color with a 1/2 in off white head. Retention is not great. Smell has a malty sweetness to it, sort of bready. There is also some hoppiness in the nose, but the sweet malts stand out more. The taste didn't knock my socks off, but it was certainly not bad. The taste gives you more of that easygoing maltiness, I am getting bread, grains, maybe a little caramel. The gps are less pronounced in the taste, but the different malts give some complexity that makes up for it some. Mouthfeel was on par for this style, but might have lacked just a touch of carbonation. Overall a great addition to the LTD line from full sail. I got on the LTD train a little late and I am regretting it now, they are making some really cool German style lagers."
"- Overall a damn fine lager, like all of Full Sails. Nice to see them experimenting w/ so many lagers. So far my order of favorite LTD's is as follows: 03,04,05,02,01"
"I had a six pack of this beer last week. It wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't a good beer either. It smelled mostly of sweet malts and grain. I felt the mouth and taste was rather watery and bland and it reminded me more of an amber ale with no hop bite. I know they were going for a larger that amber ale drinkers would like, but I feel they missed the fulled body malt flavor that lagers a supposed to have and then forgot to add the hops for that little bite in the finish."
"Very drinkable, only picked up one bottle in a mixed six pack at safeway in Bend for 5.99"
"The LTDs are coming faster now! 12 oz from a 6-pack . Winco store S.Salem. $5.88 Handsome deep amber beer with a largish light tan head. Very malty aromas..toasted oat cereal comes to mind..a little nuttiness also. Taste is semi sweet toffee,again a dose of nutiness, Sweet honey finish..and perhaps the fainest hint of hop in the end. Nice enough on the tongue..good feel to it. Overall a nice tasty lager"
"4/3.5/4/4.5/4.5"
