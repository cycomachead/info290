"So overall would I recommend it ? Yes, definitely one of my favorite Rickard's yet. But it is not one of the best Red Ale on the market."

"O- Rickards Red. One of the best brews in the Rickards line but definitely not one of the best Red Lagers out there. If you're looking for a tasty brew that is good with a steak and available at most restaurants (in Canada at least), Rickards Red can do the job. If you have a choice, definitely choose draught over bottle (the bottles have a weird metallic taste). Overall, I recommend this beer."

"O: Its fine, not really much distinguishing character, perhaps the macro brew of amber ales. Smooth, nothing really standing out."

"Overall its a pretty good beer easy to drink but not really worth picking up unless you can equally find it for a dollar."

"Had a pint on tap at a Calgary neighborhood pub, following another pint of its white stable mate. Was considering an attempt at the whole Rickard's rainbow but perhaps fortunately there were only the two most common options. This red lager is an attractive amber red hue, more red than brown, and is highly carbonated. As is so often the case with decent but not earth-shatteringly good macrobrews, the aroma is not unpleasant but is faint and takes some work to discern: I get some caramel, red fruit, and some citrus hop notes against a toasty malt backbone but the whole thing is downplayed. Taste was astonishingly fruity in this example, a bright sweet cherry gum flavor along with another form of rounded corny sweetness, bramble fruits, and some subdued caramel that follows the nose. Some tangy spice accompanies a fairly watery body and a minimally bitter finish with metallic, cardboard, and sour apple notes, although frankly I have tasted worse faults in micro-brewed red/amber ales. Other examples I have tried had a dry nut character. There's some technical proficiency here but little true artistry unless one deems the emphasis on fruit and medicinal notes to be a unique feature of this particular exemplar. Personally, I'd like more caramel/crystal malt and hops to provide balance. Color me conservative."
""
"Overall - Good offering from Rickard's and not a bad mass-produced red lager, however slightly inferior to its direct competition being the offering at Alexander Keith's. Overall not something I'm likely to enjoy regularly, but any trip to a chain restaurant with limited beer selection here in Canada means that this becomes a viable option."

"Used to be my go to beer before I discovered craft beer"
"A slightly above-mediocre beer. The one thing I like about it is that it is somewhat easy to find in common restaurant chains in the area. Something to fall back on if the place I'm eating at doesn't have anything else better."

"a good standard easy drinking red beer. branded as an irish style, this seems distinctively Canadian to me. a lovely darker copper amber color with a tall lacing head that would get even higher marks if it lasted more than a minute or so. a pleasant mix of malts, less dry irish red than American style amber to me, with a touch of earthiness, a bit of smoke, some caramel sweetness, and a peculiar yet enjoyable nutty element. the carbonation is great, tons of little micro bubbles instantly refreshing me and getting my palate ready for a big afternoon and evening of beer consumption here. this is an all day beer at a lower abv and such a quick finish for the style. a much better than average brew here, impressive for a Molson coors offering, and one id be happy to drink again. a little adjunct and metallic on the finish, but its minor and doesn't deteriorate much from the overall experience."

"Poured on-tap in a shaker pint at a Margaritaville in Canada. The beer is a dark, ruby red coloring with no head, but a filmy ring on the surface. Nose of roasted character, caramel, and nut, but all very subtle. Flavors of sweet caramel forward, with a roasty backbone, and subtle, bitter hops at the end. Crisp and light in mouth. Clean, minimal toasted grain aftertaste. Crisp, clean finish. Typical macro-style red."

"Like I said, there's no good beer out here, you either get used to it or you put up some cash and drive a lot. Seriously, I have to drive 25 minutes to get to an LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) that stocks about 10 decent craft beers that aren't macro produced wannabes. For the real good stuff I have to drive 45 minutes to an hour. Don't waste your time with this beer unless you're in my position. I moved from just outside of Philadelphia to here, Beer Hell."

"A step up for a macro: a bit more flavorful than, say, Molson, and with absolutely no off nodes."

"O - Easy drinking but not much in terms of flavour. Reminiscent of a Molson Canadian with red food colouring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of pale malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, and slight rice/corn. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, and slight rice/corn. Overall, good appearance, but aroma, blend, and body are lacking."
""
"O: too sweet, not enough hops and a thin mouth feel makes this a forgettable brew."
""
""
"Pours a clean amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, a small sweet roast, but quite faint. In the taste, a bit sweet in the malt, that has a small caramel like roast. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry and sweet roast in the aftertaste. An easy ale to drink, a bit sweet and it lacks aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Avoid."
"The smell is sour and metallic, overall I wouldn't say this is a go too, but it is superior to Dark Horse, and most likely over Labatt Blue."
""
""
""
"341mL bottle. Pours a hazy dirty copper color with no head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of caramel, malts, earth, and a bit sour. The taste is mostly of the malts. Some sweet caramel along with a little sourness. Earthy. Not all that flavorful. Thin mouthfeel. It nothing special. Overall, I dont need to have it again."

"Overall, a good sessionable brew, decent flavor, but you really have to love rice."

"Overall, it is not a complex beer but its simplicity is what makes it so generically good. The aroma is this beer's weakest point but it is very drinkable."

"Often the best product available in a Molson-sponsored bar, and I’ve quaffed a lot of it in the past, but never something I'd choose otherwise – and I won’t be returning to this place soon!"

"Overall – Was over at a friends house and wasn't going to turn this beer down even though I'm not a huge fan of it. At least it's a step in the right direction from most of the other boring macros out there."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with fairly bland flavours and aromas."
"On tap at Swiss Chalet in Toronto. Pours amber with a thick, long lasting, white head. Aroma is of fermented dough and not much else. Medium, tangy body. Taste is of very unpleasant sour dough. I do not know how is it possible to spoil the beer like that."
"Fine for having at a BBQ, but pretty mediocre overall."
"I guess the color was amber but there wasn't much else about it that was to style. It was more like a killian's than anything else. Maybe a little extra maltiness but otherwise just a light aroma, low taste beer that was very unmemorable."
"It wasn't worth the calories... so I left two-thirds behind."
"Overall, this beer is readily available and is a good alternative the Coors/Canadian/Blue options for widely found Canadian macro-beers."
""
"O: Not a great start, Canada – this was not a pleasant experience. And it’s not because there’s some huge, offense off-taste or a striking flaw; it just wasn’t satisfying or flavorful in any way. Too bad, but it hasn’t shaken my confidence that I’ll find some good brews in Ontario. I’m still on the hunt!"
"Pours a caramel amber color with a hint of red and an inch high fluffly head that slowly recedes. Low aroma of toffee and butterscotch. Flavors of toasted malt, some grainy cinnamon and caramel, finishes a bit buttery. Full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Not sure why this one gets slammed so much. May not be world class, but not a bad beer, particularly from such a large producer."
"Was able to taste Rickard's Red at The Keg restaurant in Calgary. This was a decent beer produced by a marco-brewery. The appearance was a ruby red with foamy white head. The smell was not overly impressive, but most red ales aren't. There was some malt and subtle hop to the nose. The taste was very smooth with nice malt character that was well balance. The mouthfeel was quite good and would be a good selection for a session beer."
"D - Lacks a bit in the flavor department, and could have used some more malt to put it over the top. Nothing offensive, just pretty generic."
"Overall-a decent red, I can think of better ones but this was ok to have in Canada and went well with my fajitas. Cheers."
"Serving style: Bottle"
"Drink is good though, light beer, light flavors, goes down easy with no real off flavors, just not a lot of flavors."
"D: Overall this isn't a bad beer. It's a great choice when you're somewhere that basically only has a macro selection. It's also quite drinkable and I could have a bunch of them."
"Faced with a lineup of some of Canada's less exciting beers, I decided to take the plunge on Rickard's Red. I was not disappointed! The pour had a nice ruby appearance and a thin head. There are perceptible hops in the nose, although nothing too shocking. The taste has the nice roasted malt flavor you want from a red. All in all this is a decent example of the style. I could have a few of these while others pounded their Labatt's and not be unhappy."
"Pours a nice light red with beige head that stays for a while and it has pretty good lacing. smells like slightly roasted grains and tastes wet but has decent flavour. carbonation is good. very easy drinking and its not overly strong taste makes it good for a nice session beer. overall pretty good beer!"
"Not at all bad (the Rickard's seem to be better than Molson in average)."
"The name certainly isn't a lie -- this poured a clear medium red with a short cap of beige foam. Lots of lacing, very sticky, with good head retention. Strange aroma. I get lots of fruitiness, not quite citrus, with some grainy malt and a hint of floral hops. Same in the flavour, just with mild bitterness added. Light iron character in the finish. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, quite dry and nearly astringent. Not bad if you're stuck somewhere with only macro taps, but certainly not something I'd seek out or choose over nearly any craft offering."
"D: Good choose when at a pub that serves mostly macros."
"Cheers!"
"Ahhh... Rickard's Red! Picked up as part of a Canadian beer haul by the little lady. The last time I had this, I was 20 years old and on a snowboarding trip at Mont Tremblant. It didn't seem too bad back then... my, how the times have changed! Poured into my camp cup (while camping in the Pisgah National Forest) a clear copper / red with a thin, effervescent head - looks refreshing at least! Smell: hmmm, what smell?! Just malty / sugar. Taste is more of the same - a light caramel malt sweetness with pretty much nothing else - no bitterness / hops / or bite on any level. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkable in the realm of thirst quenchers, but the sweetness would probably do you in after a couple. Kinda disappointed..."
"Poured into a plastic cup at a golf course. I'm stuck behind the group in front of me at the 11st tee and they are taking forever. Pours a dark amber colour with a thin off-white head. Lots of sweetness in the smell, very malty. Flavour has lots of caramel, without much bitterness at all. This is quite drinkable for an everyday beer. When I was still in high school, this was my favourite beer and it is my go to when the selection sucks, but don't confuse it for a good beer."
"Of course it had a nice red color with just a bit of head. It didn't have much of a smell @ all & the mouth was a bit watery. The taste wasn't bad at all, a light, sweet malty taste. Not what I would normally drink but it was the best of my 3 options."
"Used to be one of my favourites a few years ago but now I just view it as an average brew."
"Rickards Red poured an amber color. There was almost no smell to it at all. It had a bit of a flavorfull taste, but still weak, and watered down. It was very easy to drink, and realitivly light. Overall like most of the Rickards beers its not really that good, but its not really that bad either."
"D - A decent beer that I could drink a few of but I would not have even bought this pint had there been some better craft options. Overall a very average beer."
"Rickard's Red pours a medium red amer with a thin head. The aroma is grainy and sweet, just a bit of dark fruit. There is some dark malt in the flavor and a bit of crystal sweetness, but the finish is dry and grainy with a bit of herbal hops. Overall the beer tastes like a decent macro ale with some chocolate malt thrown in for color."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a bit fizzy. For a macro that is found everywhere, its not too bad."
"It has no distinguishing features. It's just beer. Not bad of a beer if your sitting around with buddies watching a game."
"Drinkability - I'd say this is of mediocre drinkability. Basically refreshing but not something I feel like pounding on for 6 hours."
"The papa bear of a string of unimaginative bland beers."
"On the positive side, the fact that this beer is fairly popular in Canada might suggest that there are more people out there that want more than the basic, buck-a-beer experience."
"I bought 12 pack with the Red,White and the new Rickards Dark,,.,for 14$ wich is alright."
"Mouthfeel was a bit too thin with a slight metallic taste. Drinkability is average....a good lawnmower beer...acceptable session beer (with food). Very average."
"I will not try this again."
"don't say no when passed one but don't go out of this way for this one. after pouring it i thought i was in for a treat, but after drinking it i know i was tricked and it's not as good as it looks"
"Drinkability: One is enough and even that one I had a hard time finishing. The bitter parts were too bitter and unflavorful. The beer just is kinda there."
"D: Average beer that I wouldn't order again. There are much better Canadian red's out there."
"Thin, slick, carbonation is really noticeable. At least it goes down easy cold. I think I'll try to finish this before it warms."
"Pours with a very small, diminishing head, with fair lacing. Body is extremely clear with no particles, with a nice reddish color. Aroma is very light and doesn't yield much (to my nose, anyway). Average carbonation with a light body and thin texture, and a bitter finish. The flavor sticks around for a little while after finishing, moderately bitter and lightly acidic. Overall, not the best beer, but far from the worst, either. Crisp, yet bitter, it's a fairly good beer to sip on, regardless of the season."
"The clean finish makes this one a bit drinkable, but I can't say I'll request it again."
"Well, given this re-acquaintance with Molson (for posterity, I say to myself), I think my friend was right. This sure tastes like their flagship middling-to-low lager, all dressed up with a fair dose of caramel flavoring. Ok when the options at the bar are limited, but, nostalgia aside, nothing at all here to get excited about either."
"D- This is where Rickard's scores high. This is a perfect session beer, very drinkable, if not served too cold."
"As far as Molson products go, this is one of the best. It's a good session beer, flavorful enough to let you know you're drinking beer, but rather light and not too filling. It pours a modest head atop a nice orangish red malty liquid. The nose is light, as is the palate. The palate boasts slight sweetish maltiness, with little bitterness to finish. Smooth, unremarkable mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This is a standard in Ontario pubs and restaurants. Certainly it's worth a drink during the short warm Canadian summers."
"D: Nice for style. Good sessionability. A nice surprise from Molson. I would have this one again."
"A nice ""quench-thirster"". The caramel/Red character is pretty good and nothing particularly ""off"". A fine attempt for a ""macro"" brewery."
"That sweet finish doesn't beg another sip right away, but the appealing taste keeps you coming back."
"Overall not a memorable experience. Macroesque to be sure."
"Poured a mahogany brown, with about an inch of foam, which stuck to the glass. The brew had a faint aroma of toast. Flavor was mostly toasted malt with a slight note of tea, and maybe some piney hops if you concentrate real hard. Not a lot of complexity to a pretty standard, straightforward red which is nice, easy drinking beer, and otherwise not particularly special."
"Had this one on tap in Calgary. Not much for appearance - a little on the red side and very little head. Smelled of sweet malts and a little hops. A crisp taste that was OK with your tongue feeling the sweetness of the malt. I had a couple more because the drinkability was fair."
"(From a limited, dated journal): Deep bronze in color; distinct malty aroma with a bready character. A wave of sweetness at first, with a long, biscuity, tangy finish. Nice yeast character, which I don't mind. The beer of choice for my PEI friends, though I'm not sure why."
"D: Very easy to drink and franky pretty good overall."
"Poured into a 23 oz pint from tap. Nice amber/cranberry color, pretty translucent. Off-white head, about a finger, which slowly dissipated. Nose is faint, maybe a bready malt - tough to pull out. Taste has a generic, muted hop taste with hints of nuts, and a bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is quite light and watery - not much carb. Goes down quite easy, so one could drink a few if they didn't mind the drab taste. Pretty run of the mill beer - not really true to a red other than it's color, as it lacks any maltiness really."
"Ok the smell is pretty faint, I get some fruitiness, malt, and some light hops. The taste is pretty disapointing after looking at the beer in front of you. Subtle hop bitterness and some sweetness from the malt. Well balanced. Watery mouthfeel. No question that this is an easy drinking beer but its way overpriced"
"Drinkability: I have found this beer to be refreshing on many of a hot summer day in Ontario."
"This is good in a pinch, but still a little to ""macro"" for me."
"This beer poured a copper color with red highlights and little head that dissipated fairly quickly. The scent is nice but uncomplicated, some malts and perhaps a little caramel. The taste is mostly bready malt with some caramel and little to no hop characteristics. The mouthfeel is a little thick with significantly less carbonation than you'd expect from a macro. I'd consider this a tasty little beer that wouldn't be too bad to pick up for the next hockey game or curling match. A little bit of a single-note brew, but that note ain't too bad."
"Sampled with my girlfriend at a café overlooking Niagara Falls. Off the tap the glass was topped with a cream colored head and the beer itself was a clear, red/amber. It laced very well but displayed little retention. Aromas were understated, earthy and malty. Flavors were muted as well, a nuttiness, some breadiness. Hoppy bitterness was a little heavy handed and it didn't have enough malt to balance. Medium carbonation but the body was watery. It didn't really strike me as a true Red except for the color and it's just another macro-brew in my opinion."
"I remember this beer being a lot better out of the bottle, but maybe because that was a long time ago?"
"D- I have enjoyed a schooner or two of this in a sitting before, and even though it isn't the lightest beer out there, it's great if you are looking for something with a rich flavor, but still retaining that refreshing aspect. Goes great with chicken wings BTW. I recommend this for anyone who is graduating from cheap run of the mill brews to something with a little more class! Definately the best of the Rickards family!"
"Nothing really stands out about this beer to make it worth buying again. Very non-offensive red ale that was brewed for the masses of people who are affraid to try new beers."
"This is a beer you'd sample in your Introduction to Beer 100 class. A half-effort put into the style to bring in the masses and not scare away the veterans. Decent."
"I was surprised to see that this product was made by Molson."
"Drinkability is fine, good when you want to concentrate on the Sens beating the snot out of the Leafs instead of your beer."
"D: I was surprised to read the label and see that this is a Molson product. The flavor is good but not great, a decent session beer if you don't want something overwhelming."
"Poured clear amber but with cherry highlights once in the glass. Modest tan head, some lacing. Smells feintly hoppy, not much else. Foamy mouthfeel with a syrupy texture, a touch of caramel but sour on the finish. Bitter aftertaste, a bit parched, astringent. Went a little flat by the end but the lacing held up throughout."
"Clean caramely malty syrupy sweet smell that tastes quite refreshing and sweet with caramel hints as it goes down,medium body mouthfeel and flavor,quite a refreshing beer that i really enjoyed and do stock up often with this...if you havn't tried this it's definately worth trying....quite enjoyable."
"A nice beer with a modicum of flavour. The colour is dark red-brown which looks very thick and the head varies. The aroma is non-descript compared to other beers, there are some slight malt and hop tinges, nothing overpowering. It has a lagery feel in the mouth which for me makes it a bit more palatable. The taste is a slightly sweet taste with a hint of malt. It tends to be a smooth brew which goes down quite well. I have recommended this to others."
"Summary: A well-crafted, smooth, and great-looking brew. Although by no means offensive in taste, its good looks belie its simplicity in flavor. Nothing special, but at the same time good at what it does."
"This seemed to be the most popular Canadian beer I came across on the trip. Since it wasn't a macro lager, I was hoping perhaps this would be the Sam Adams of Canada, but that mark fell a little short. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but doesn't have anything really too special going for it. I guess if you want a solid, smooth session beer it's ok, but if you have better options I'd go with them."
"Pours a fairly dark amber color with a niceinch of white ehad and a surprising amount of lacing. Nose is mild, matl and grain--smells like your standard lager. Taste is very refreshing. Mostly malt, some light spices. Very light hops at the end. Slight astringency, but not bad. Feel is fairly thin bodied wiht solid carbonation. It's solid macro lager that for some reason is claiming to be an American Amber ale (seriously, this makes no sense to me, its essentially a Canadian Killians). It's refreshing and smooth. A good one to throw back a bunch of."
"Final Statement: I would not say I enjoyed this one, but the bottom line is that it's OK, for what it is. It's an attempt at Molson to brew a beer that people with taste buds can tolerate when they're are faced a with limited selection. However, it's still not to be classified as a 'good' beer. Pint of glory? I think not."
"Final Grade: 2.97, a forgettable C. I first tried Rickard's Red very early on in my beer-drinking career, which is probably why I liked it so much at the time. Scrutinizing it today, after many years of being a BA, I can confidently say that it's definitely nothing special, and a mediocre, sessionable amber at best. I'd probably still take a Rickard's Red over a Keith's Red Amber, but I can't think of any OCB ambers that I wouldn't pick well before either of them."
"Flavor is similar to nose with caramel malt and a bit of sweetness. beer goes down very easy.Not a very interesting beer. I dont think I would try this one again."
"Looks and smells alright but the taste seems a bit off. It's bland, and comes with some unsavory flavors. It's probably about average for the style. Try it for yourself."
"Unremarkable taste. Balanced malts and hops. Toffee flavous with enough of a hop presence to stop this from being too sweet or caramely. Smooth mouthfeel, but nothing to get excited about. Great as a session ale...round after round and you don't get tired of it...of course, when selection is limited...."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I can easily enjoy this brew and will probably put down a few today watching U of M beat up on Notre Dame."
"This is the beer I usually order when my only choices are Molson and Labatt products. This is fairly often as it is often the best choice on tap in standard restaurants with limited beer lists."
"By far, the best Molson brew I've had to date. I even let mine warm up, as I was enjoying a book at the time. No harsh off flavors, smooth drinking clean fun."
"Would highly recommended, the best out of the Rickards series and one of the best mainstream Canadian beers."
"D - Definitely easy-drinking."
"Drinkability is stellar. I could (and have) enjoyed several of these in a sitting. At 5.20% ABV, it's perhaps not the best choice as a session beer, but it is still quite drinkable nonetheless, and a treat for the mouth after far too much macro sludge. Big name aside, you do have to (reluctantly) give credit where credit is due - Rickard's Red is a solid, enjoyable brew. Better on draught, certainly, but still good bottled. Even bars that only tend to carry lowest-common denominator beer seem to have this one on tap, so it is - and will continue to be, as long I'm forced by friends to frequent those establishments - a brew I enjoy regularly."
"Pours to a very pretty reddish-brown color with a practically non-existant head (likely due to the fact that it has been sitting in a pitcher). Smell is quite nice, rather nutty. Taste is actually pretty good, that same nutty aroma is there which makes it really easy to put back. mouthfeel is a little thin and not very pronounced, carbonation isn't very obvious. Overall, not bad, looking forward to putting back a few more come the next time i go home."
"The head is thick, dense, creamy, faintly cream-colored. Nice, psycho, sticky lacing. The beer is a clear, darkish copper-brown. Aroma is sugary with cooked caramel. Kinda fruity. Front is sweet caramel and nutty. Middle is fairly full, sweet, fruity with caramel. Very nutty in the end with loads of sweet grapes. Great nutty aftertaste. Not much hops to speak of, but it's a decent red. Nice and nutty, if a little to grapey sweet. But I still like this beer."
"This really isn't that good. It's just a macro is disguise. In fact, there are a few macro lagers that I'd rather have than drink this again."
"Im thinking that they actually use copper to colour this stuff, because there is this lingering metallic quality to it. Thats what ruins this beer for me. The metal makes it feel funny, like you're sucking a penny."
"Drinkability: Another good highly drinkable beer that is a better alternative than the macros. I'd drink it again if I had the chance."
"I had this on tap at a place in Niagara Falls. Everything about this beer was good, but I found the mouthfeel to be a bit watery. What I really loved was the unique flavor. It was a bit nutty which was what really stood out to me. If I ever visit Canada again, I'll have to bring home a case of this."
"Of the Rickard's beers I've had, this is my favorite by far. I really love the colour of this one, nice deep red, although I must admit my experience with red ales is limited. Head sticks to the glass for most of the pint. Smell is faintly sweet, hoppy. Taste starts out a bit sweet, then goes on to a grapefruity sour. Alcohol is fairly prevalent, even though this isn't THAT strong of a beer. Finish is fairly clean but slightly bitter. This beer starts with a slight tangy carbonated feel, but weakens quite quickly and ends up being quite soft and smooth on the way down. I like this for a session beer, and for a macro, it's quite acceptable."
"Not a bad beer, but lackluster. Poured a rather anemic red for the style. Little aroma - a bit of malt. Flavor was rather monotone, with some mildly apple-fruit malt that hinted at some raw grain. Hopping perked up a bit toward the end, and helped redeem the experience. Verdict - so-so."
"Drinkability: Average. I don't like the way this brand is marketed. We know Rickard's is Molson, but I don't like having to pay higher prices for a domestic macro."
"Bottle....standard twist cap. Pour gave me a slightly reddish brown clear beer with a 2 finger rocky off white cap ...good retenetion (for a Mol-coor brew),fair lacing...medium carbonation. Nose is a slight spice tone under sweet malt...little detectable hops. suprising balance in the body between sweet caramel malts and spicy hopping...actually very pleasing on this revisit of this ""beer"" ( I do not think this has an ale yeast or warm process and it is definately cold lagered) The finish is (amazingly) medium...not fast like other Mol-coor sudz. Nice sweetish-biscuit-spice decernment in the end...I could swear I was drinking a true Vienna lager...this is definately not ale. Very pleasant and probably one of the best Mega brews in Canada."
"In the end Rickard's Red hasn't changed much since I first tried it, except a lone pint of it won't get me all wigged out anymore (thanks for abstaining with the use of that nasty mystery additive, whatever it was!). But more than ever, now that I'm at the bottom of my glass, is it apparent to me that it tastes just like a coppery version of Molson Canadian, perhaps with a bit more corn for that added sweetness. I notice the label only says it's a red beer, not an ale. Busted!"
"Nice dark amber body and off white head. The smell is very yeasty, kind of spicy yeast. Taste is light overall, medium roasted malt, major yeast, little hops charactor. Mouth feel is bubbly and watery. Drinkability is easy and unoffensive. An average red, nothing special except more that average malty-ness"
"Thx"
"This beer poured a reddish copper color with a long lasting little head. The aroma was a boring mish mash of indolent malts and soapy corn. The taste, while inoffensive, lacked definition. It consisted of some bland malts, minute hop bitterness, and some wet cardboard and soapy(?) notes. The mouthfeel is prickly from high carbonation. This beer is average at best. Its not much better than your average macro swill, it does look prettier though."
"This is a very generic red ale. It does have the color you would expect in a classic red ale. It is not offensive, but really has no character or anything special. There is a caramel taste, but not much sweetness or hoppiness to it. It is lighter in taste and body than some other ales which makes is easy drinking. Pretty average for this style, a bit better coming from a national brewer."
"A pretty boring beer overall. A let down for me."
"it's definitely along the same lines of killian's red or michelob amber bock -- a slightly malty beer with a modest hop profile. this one is apparently an ale, but it's almost devoid of esters or diacetyl. very clean, lager-ish finish. overall, a pretty decent macro beer. won't blow you away, but is very drinkable and inoffensive."
"Sampled 8/4/04 at Bugsy's in St. Catharine's."
"This beer was read, with a quickly receding head and no lace to speak of. It smells slightly of yeast, but, other than that, there is no real aroma to speak of. An adjuncty taste dominates, and is just kinda of a foul taste over all. I had this beer sitting outside at a restaurant, and it did quench my thirst, and it is relatively drinkable in the right circumstance."
"this brew pours a ruby amber color with a tiny head that is gone in an instant. smell is rather sweet with malts dominating the nose. the taste is sweet malts with very weak underlying hops. mouthfeel is thin and lousy. moderatly carbonated. drinkabilty is ok. i saw this swill at most bars in niagra falls. it was always mentioned when i asked for a draft list. not the wost canadian i ever had but , certainly not the best."
"This beer is what I consider Canada's version of Killian's. But this I like better. Deep red color, short lived head and a really good flavor. Hints of corn and barely and a really smooth aftertaste. Kind of sweet, but not like candy. More or less a touch of sugary taste that is just barely enough to notice. This is one of the beers I wish we had in the states. Worth a try if you like Red Ales and are visiting the Great White North. Recommended."
"Taste was quite one dimensional. Lacked any sort of depth. Some malty sweetness together with a touch of grain and some bitterness, all at once. After a while you fail to get any sort of taste from this beer."
"Poured a clear dull golden-red in color with a sparse off-white head that held up well and even laced the glass. Aromas are malty sweet with just a dash of bitter hops in the background. Flavors are average. A slightly roasted nutty flavor mixed in with a caramel sweetness on the front side that finished with a slight bitter metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side and this was one I didn't find myself reaching for to finish. A Molson product, so what'd you expect?"
"I don't care: I like this beer. I first had it on draft at the hotel we always stay in in Montreal, and I was just amazed at how pleasant and easy it was to drink. The taste is there, and you can keep on drinking them. Last had on draft in April in Montreal...Clear irish setter red when served, came topped with a nice white frothy head. Clean aroma. Great medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, it's mostly all malt with a biscuity aftertaste. I guess this could be my favorite macro! I would not turn this beer down. Since I've been known to have many in a row, it gets a 5 for drinkability."
"Molson's poster child of craft brewing. Better than water, possibly drinkable. OK red color. Bit of malt taste but not much taste thereafter.. Grainy. Tiny hops but carbonation. Bitter astringent aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel. A lot of creamy head disapearing like soap in sink."
"Tap: clear dark brown colored beer with absolutely no head or carbonation. Aroma is very neutral with small traces of malts. Taste is also very neutral with traces of malts. Just another macro beer with no taste whatsoever. Very boring beer from Molson."
"More of a dirty brown than red, still it looked nice after the experiment gone awry that was a Molson Canadian. Looking forward to this after that, the disappointment was immediate. Thin thin thin, I think this is the most watery beer that wasn't yellow/clear I've ever had. Nothing happening in the aroma, a funny metallic taste, and the only good thin about the finish is when I was finished with it. To it's credit, the beer was fresh and adjuncts were not detected. Just way too thin and too funny tasting."
"Nose was limited caromel/fruits, no linger there either."
"Pours out a dark amber colour. The head disappears leaving no trace. Nose is a kind of maize smell - sort of - maybe. I just couldn't tell. I drank it but it was not what I think of as a good tasting amber/red. I might have to try it again and see if I missed something."
"Spent an extremely pleasant afternoon in a Pub in Victoria BC drinking this beer, so my rating may be a little biased.Medium red color. Roasted malts, slightly hoppy, very flavorful ale. Refreshing and slightly hoppy. Good malt/hop balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"At a recent tasting with a few friends Rickard's Red was at the top of the list along with a local New Brunswick beer called Alpine. At this tasting we learned not to mix too many types of beers together as the drinkabiltity of lighter tasting beers such as Corona and Budweiser were very negatively affected by the stronger tasting ones such as Rickard's."
"this was in Niagara Falls so getting it in Columbus Ohio is only unlikely. I can live with out it though."
"Color is a solid red amber, deep and glowing with a small off-white head of tight foam that faded leaving minimum lacing. Smell is very faint of sweet caramel malt and thats about it. Taste is lighter then expected, mostly sweetness from caramel malts a bit of hops but is uneven a bit towards the finish, nice effort, but still watered down enough for less taste and easier drinkin. Upon closer inspection I see its a Molson product, that explained alot. I went out of my way a bit while traveling in Sault Ste, Marie,Ontario to find this stuff and was pretty disappointed, oh well, no harm done, it was in Canadian exchange so it was pretty cheap."
"Good appearance for a macro. Almost fools you. Deep red colour with a 1 finger head that lasts. Weak smell. Mildly sweet and spicy. If the smell was more prominent, a higher score would be deserved. What I did smell was good, but too weak. Fairly good taste. Sweet and malty, with a little floral hops. Not enough to balance perfectly, but enough hops to let you know an attempt was made. Refreshing mouthfeel and drinkable. A very good beer, considering the source(Molson)."
"Overall, a decent red ale, but just decent, nothing remarkable here. But not bad, it's certainly better than your average hotel bar beer."
"An alright beer from a Macro... well I think this beer is very drinkable and smooth. It appears an amber slightly copper brown haze over it with a highly carbonated white creamy textured head. It smells of a caramel malt sweetness, and there is really no dominate hop character present here. The flavors are a nutty caramel slightly dry finish that is overall very sweet and drinkable. Nothing amazing here but very good session brew available only in Canada, so between the tap version and the bottle version a reasonable go to while looking for a better selection. Lighter to medium body with a lighter watery texture that is very drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall a good beer for nights of pleasurable drinking."
"Tried this brew at the Mondial de la Biére in Montreal this past summer. A very light tasting red likened to a milder version of Killian's or Shea's."
