"Yup. Another crap beer trying to compete. Effort noticed but keep trying. By the way. Add some hops"
""
"a cheap high abv miller"
"Not too bad when you want something cheap"
"It's Miller. Nothing special here. Taste's like cheap beer."
"Great advertising bottle and good taste"
""
""
"Amber colour, nothing special. Aroma has a slighty sweet corn smell. Tastes like a typical amber lager. Not bad, but has no hint of hops. High APV for a inexpensive price."
"Has a nice golden color to it, usual cheap grain/corn smell, but on the taste it's a rich corn and malt with a creamy mouthfeel to it, much like a good cream ale, very very good considering it's from miller, will buy again."
"This is a very good beer."
"Pretty good. Best of the Miller Beers I've had. Higher ABV and for a lower price than many others"
""
"Overall:  People who enjoy the aroma of rotten corn and stale malt will derive amusement from Miller Fortune.  People who like a beer that reminds them of grain mixed with light metal will enjoy Miller Fortune."
""
"Overall: Not a bad addition to the Miller lineup.  It is not pretending to be anything else besides a step up from High Life, MGD, etc.  I would drink it again, but it is not exactly a go-to."
""
""
"Blah all over.  Only thing enjoyable was that it was a higher ABV than miller light."
""
"Pretty good, I found it the best of the Miller Beers I've had. Higher ABV got me buzzed after a few."
"Good beer for Miller to do. Dark and high alc. content makes for a decent beer."
"It's to me a poor man's flashy beer. I'll give it to miller on trying to venture out of light beers but they need alot more testing. The flavor goes from a dark lager to a burnt chocolate and hops, it to much going on and throws flavor way off and way to much carbonation . Packaging is cool though."
"Great beer great price! Gets you drunk pretty quick"
"Not good. If you want a mainstream moderately darker beer, pick something else."
""
""
""
"Best Miller product IMHO but then again, they have a low bar to begin with.  If you can't find anything else, this is not too bad."
"A decent beer that's affordable."
"There is no way to try and mask this beers intended market! This beer was made for people who like strong inexpensive beers. I happen to like all beers and depending on the mood I might want a cheap strong beer. That being said this beer is not expensive, so I will treat and rate it as so. Like other strong beers in its category, Malt liquors, High Gravity lagers, Ice beers... this beer is a cut above the rest. This kind of reminds me of a cross between Olde English and Leffe Blonde, of course it’s made at 1/4 the budget of Leffe Blonde so please don't bash it. If you want a better tasting strong beer/ale then go for something like a Leffe Blonde. If you want a six pack of strong beer for the price of two Leffe Blonde's than look no further! Miller Fortune will do the trick."

"Kind of bias due to my dislike of reds and Miller, but a passable beer for sure"

""
""
"taste like beer with a shot of vodka to me, not complex at all, malt and hops are muted by the pure booze flavor"
""
""
"If they threw in a little hoppiness, this could have been a great beer. It is sweet and malty with no malt liquor ethanol attack and is still highly drinkable even after standing for 15 minutes. A notch above your typical lager at a decent price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well,  this isn't half bad but I reckon that I won't bother to revisit."
""

"I've given miller fortune a 3.5. I'm not much for talking about tastes flavors and mouthfeel. In my reality you have to take into consideration price which in this case is extremely affordable. I wish I could drink barrel aged tripels everyday but i can't afford it. This beer isn't bad tasting it's pretty strong and doesn't give me a hangover like cheap ""ice""  beers do. I like miller fortune!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Someone left this in my fridge so I decided to give it a shot...kinda wish I didn't.  Taste starts off with promise and then there's the nasty aftertaste that fills you full of booze and regret.  Tastes like it was filtered through a hobo's sock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff was so bad it made me mad. All I could taste was the booze and some sweet maltiness but that almost just tasted like sugar. It tasted like barf and sugar combined. This was not good. I got it for free but next time I would even drink it for free... and that's saying something."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is essentially the antithesis to ""refreshing"" as a proper adjective. Heavy, not easy to drink, and just downright repulsive to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
""
""
"Think back to those first few times you drank too much beer and got sick late that night or early the next morning.  Then think about that taste in your mouth.  This beer is that taste."
""
"love this beer, beer bros."
"No one drinking Miller Fortune is drinking is for the lovely taste, but it is very tolerable when compared to other cheap 24oz beers. It will get you very drunk for cheap. It's a cool looking can too."
"O: Exactly what I was expecting for a higher gravity version of a Miller product - certainly not offensive but definitely not anything special either. Decent enough that I would not refuse it in the future but I would not seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.66) : I would buy this again. It's decent, and I think it gets a bad rep because it's a Miller product. On the contrary, I think it deserves a thumbs up BECAUSE it's a Miller product. This is a decent amber and one of the better macro ambers I've had in my lifetime. Nothing wrong with drinking this one, it's tasty and different than the run-of-the-mill High Life or MGD."

"O. Overall craft beer lovers should stay far away, however I would recommend to Miller Light lovers. It tastes like Miller Light with a shoot of vodka in it to get you drunk quicker."

"Taste is very smoothe.  Not a hoppy beer but just enough hops.  Perfect carbonation without a bite.  Taste is top shelf to yeungling. Look out though since the alcohol content is strong and will sneak up on you..."

"Miller Fortune pours a pale straw color, with a fizzy head. There really isn't much of an aroma. The taste is full of adjunct flavors, with some spice notes. Easier to drink then other similar beers, and not as harsh. Overall it is a step up form most adjunct beers, easier to drink and the flavors are not as pronounced."

"i got this at HEB in the 12 pack. I chose it because i was looking for something new with a bit more alcohol than a typical beer. It is described as a red lager HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! ITS DARK STRAW KINDA LIKE urine when im dehydrated. tastes like copper. no head, no fiz and no flavor. I drank four and I am saving the rest for guests and I am going to to the store to get a real beer."

"Picked this up because Butler's (Riverside Liquors in Frederick) was clearing a bunch out for $3.99 a six. I mean, how bad could it be at 7% for that cost. Well, not much to look at. For a, albeit slightly, bigger beer there was nothing to the appearance, maybe a little more color than a typical Miller beer. Smell, well, pretty much the same, a little better than typical Miller. However, it was not bad. Reasonably tasty and easy to drink, a little better than Miller High Life which is not horrible. Plus, at almost 7% it gets a little bonus overall, especially if you can get if for 4 buck a six. I will be stopping back by to stock up on this, it is drinkable and I can fill the fridge with it for guests who do not like beer snob stuff, and if I have to end up drinking it, or if I am having a quantity day, giddy up."

"This beer does not remind me of any mainstream beer. The closest I can think of is Carlsberg Elephant. If Miller would only add some more hops this beer could be a 5.0 instead of 4.5 as it is a big malty brew with a good mouth feel but without the requisite hop nose and bittering hop level to balance it. I would call it's style as Maibock if I were to give it an international style description. Miller please rethink the inadequate hop level on this beer and add an adequate hop level and you will sell more. I would still be more inclined to drink this than any of the other American Pilsner lager beers available."
"Hefty feel to the bottle, pours amber in color and above average in appearance. Aroma is corn/vegetal and in line with other macro brew. Taste is also similar to macro. Its a little more malty, given the higher abv, but most of the sweetness is from corn. Underwhelming taste with minimal hop presence. Mouthfeel is ok, and overall this is slightly below average for style. $7.49 for a sixer with 6.9% abv - I mean, I'll probably get it again but its definitely more about the buzz than the flavor with this one."

"Drink this beer as cold as you can get it because it's really awful. It starts off okay however it does not hold it's 6.9% alcohol very well at all. In fact you get the distinct alcohol taste when you roll it around across your tongue ....the next problem comes when you swallow it you realize at that point you're drinking a beer that's loaded with sweetness almost like a very bad attempt at a cream ale. My Advice is leave this stuff on the shelf for someone else more adventuresome to try"
""
"Drinkability – This was much better than I thought it would be. It’s a smooth drinker, nothing offensive, and makes a laudable effort at following the style guidelines. My only criticism is that it was light in the ass but that didn’t take away from the drinkability of the beer."

"People are nuts. I have liked Miller beer, but this beer is unbelievably good. Try it for yourself and stop trying to say what you think is cool. Just be honest with yourself. This beer is GOOD!. And at 7% alcohol, you don't have to drink a bunch to get a nice buzz."

"Overall: Not bad for what it is. This beer is functional and not the worst i have had. I still think the best budget brew is Mickeys... So the next time i will go to that."
"Overall: Hey, it's an American macro beer, what do you expect? This definitely does not compete with craft, not even with Coors' Third Shift or Batch 19, but with it's high ABV it's decent to get a slight buzz going for cheap if you can stomach malt liquor. Miller missed the boat with the marketing on this one, but not too bad considering I'm not expecting Weyerbacher Insanity from this."

"Overall: Not really getting red ale here. More of an amped up adjunct lager. The extra alcohol was not overly noticeable. If you like adjunct products, this falls right in the middle--only with an extra kick."
""
"This beer completely surprised me. I would definitely have it again. Not bad for Miller’s attempt at a craft beer. I would have rated this even higher compared to American Adjunct Lager’s, but Beer Advocate had it as a American Amber / Red Lager."
""
""
"Bottom line: this is a sub par domestic beer. For your money you might was well buy some 40s."
""
""
"Taste / Palate: It's flavor has a firm grainy presence with notes of corn husk and cereal grain with light grassy hop backing it up. It also has a little sweet malty boozy character as well. It feels slick and full with some fizzy carbonation trying to give to some lift off the palate."

"Miller is tryng to make a beer that is compareable to smaller market beers and do an ok job. This beer has more taste than anything else I've drank with the name Miller on it. If you want to try something new but are afraid to leave the big name beer companies give it a try."
"The abv level is higher than other domestics, obviously to compete with Bud Light Platinum but this is a richer more enjoyable amber lager. It actually reminds me of Flying Dog's Amber Lager."
"This is another glitzy attempt from the big beer companies to produce ""Super Premium"" beer to compete with craft. Once again, a misfire. This is not tasty. A little nicer than cheap malt liqour. 40 oz black painted bottles would be the only way I'd respect this beer."
"OK, so my buddy Jake left two of these at my house and I figured why not rate it. I could be surprised. OK Miller...surprise me. It pours a slightly brownish gold with a loud fizzy head that dissolves to nothing in a matter of seconds. The smell is...fruit loops and cardboard. I begin to suspect that childhood is about to punch me in the 'nads. The taste is bready, grainy, then ugh. Sour, metallic, and then sour some more. It's like an old tin sandwich made with infected bread. The mouthfeel is fizzy and not quite watery. This is a terrible beer. I'm sorry, I really wanted to give this a chance. But its like they took everything not objectionable away from crap beer, then added the parts from crap beer that only your pretentious brother-in-law likes."
""
""
"I really wanted to like this beer, as I drink both MHL, and MGD. I poured this into a Guinness pint sized glass. The appearance is a medium golden color. A very thin head, with very little lacing. It had a fruity taste at first, then leaves an odd, thick textured, sour taste which isn't very pleasant. Glad I only bought a six pack. Way overpriced too. Like others noted, they did a good job of covering up the high alcohol content. I'm not a beer snob, so let me say that I'd rather have a Miller Highlife over this stuff..."
""
"O: The fortune I see is not very long lived. Poor attempt MillerCoors, very poor."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom brown glass twelve-ounce long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, if the higher alcohol content is what you're after, just get some malt liqour, because that's basically what this tastes like."
""
"O: This is a premium? It wasn't a drain pour, but it was one and done for me. When I asked the bartender if anybody else had one of these, she said she'd sold one other bottle and they had the same reaction. Her sample of the beer also proved the same."
"Bought this in a 12 pack of bottles at Walmart. Miller in a brown bottle, Hmm, it's looks like a dark beer, 6.9% alcohol. Pours with tan color head, fades away, has very little aroma, maybe some generic grain, medium alcohol smell. Tastes rather sweet for a dark beer, carmel, molasses, something... Doesn't seem like a 6.9% alcohol beer. I'm not a heavy drinker nor a dark beer drinker yet this went down easy with a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Not sure what Miller is aiming for here, seems to be in search of an identity. Doubt if I'll buy it again but if you're buying..."
""
""
""
"This beer in no way, has common attributes to their High Life or lite brand."
""
""
""
""
"except for it's amber color which is the best part of it's appearance the beer has no head and no lace. smell is weak not much there. taste is of malt with some caramel and hint of whiskey mouthfeel ok. it hides the alcohol well which is the best thing i can say about it. i will not buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the worst beers I've had in a while. The whole product seems unoriginal, from the black bottle which is reminiscent of Bud's Black Crown, to trying to tap into the spirits and craft beer markets. I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
""
"O-Pretty disappointed, comes in a nice package and a cool bottle but its really just a jacked up miller, Very similar to what bud light tried to do with the platinum. The only good part about it is the ABV"
"It's not too bad considering the 6.9% ABV."
"A strange find with the Miller logo, for sure. I duly got sat down with a 12 oz bottle to see what would happen. When I bought it, my wife tried to discourage me, and she doesn't even drink. Well, anything (almost) is worth trying once. So down the hatch. What is that unusual taste? This bothered me for quite a while, until I remembered. It was Miller, but with more alcohol. Well, Miller is OK as far as it goes. And more alcohol? How can you lose with that combo?"
""
"Nothing like kicking back, taking a quick bike ride over to the local 7-Eleven, and grabbing a 24oz can of Miller Fortune, the only way to try a single serving of this beer 'round these parts. It pours a clear brass topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises hard water, wet grains, a hint of toast, and a vein of sweet vinyl. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of pure booze quietly lurking in the background, unwittingly throwing off the feng shui a bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat crisp finish. Overall, this is what I expected a higher-grav version of Miller to be like. It's not all that great, but I'm still drinking the can, so it can't be all bad. Good for a bit o' slummin'."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall: decent, but a little lacking in balance."
"Miller Fortune is the best economic equation of price vs. taste vs. ABV. It defies your natural expectations for a beer that has 6.9% alcohol by volume. It's ethanol taste is remarkably subtle, the liquid has a light crisp feel. It's light on spice and flavor, but it delivers what it promises which is a higher than mainstream ABV that is potable for the masses. I don't perceive it as insulting. Personally, It's one of my new guilty pleasure beers."

"The Verdict: Not bad. There’s no doubting that it’s a macrobrew, but it’s a drinkable one. The bourbon flavor it supposedly carries evades my taste buds, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Let's all face the facts. We wouldn't have bought, and tried this beer if it didn't have 6.9% It's an aweful beer, don't try to pull out flavors. I like the one comment about all the corn - that's funny - because that's what it is. I mean, compared to all macros, it fits the bill. And with the 1.9% higher abv than most macros, it's okay for the masses. It's basically marketed to the ""club"" crowd in their early twenties. It's marketed as ""classy"" and has a higher abv that bars can charge 7-8 bucks a pint. All the while guys with way too much cologne and hair gel think they're drinking something great in their futile attempt of bringing home a girl drinking pina coladas. Yeah, you know it :) I had to try it - because I pretty much drink every beer. But just another Platinum rip-off. Blah"

"Jun1614 B.B.D. -can- sampled on 4/5/14"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not sure what Miller is going for here. At best, this beer is all over the place and doesn't connect any dots. At worse, it's a watery 6.9% brew that doesn't really taste like anything you want it to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - all over the board here. I like it and I don't. It's way too sweet and could use some more hops. It does have some decent flavors, but would I actually buy it again? I'm not sure. Probably not, especially this giant sized can - it's too sweet and odd for me. It did, however, exceed my expectations."
""
""
""
"overall i would say that Miller always does higher gravity lagers better than A-B, so maybe this is just an attempt to make a ""classy"" malt liquor. it's just an amped up version of adjunct amber lager. i really don't see the point in brewing these. would make a good beer to boil some brats in."
""
"following a cantillon review with this, such is my life. 24 ounce can, apparently the miller answer to bud light platinum, i must say this is worlds better, but thats as far as i am willing to go on it. smells like college, already dead, corny and sweet, unnecessarily strong, and fizzy as they come. somewhat comical to me, i have not had a beer of this quality in some time, and am reminded why i made the switch to craft all these years ago, its not horrible, but its so so bad compared to even the most humble and pedestrian craft offering. sometimes i get so lost in our beer world that i forget the vast majority of americans drink stuff like this. a commentary on our society more than just beer i guess, but this is utterly disgusting in the context of all beer. in the context of BMC stuff, its middle of the road. no detectable off flavors in it, which puts it ahead of at least half of its peers. it has a sweetness to it too that isnt all the way nasty, but i am left realizing that i would have no chance of finishing this can withotu vomiting, even for money im not sure i could pull it off. drinking should be a chore, and this can of beer is exactly that."
""
""
"Overall: I wasn't overly impressed. Overly sweet with little bitter balance. Seemed like a good summer yard work beer but for the price there are better, more tasteful options."
"If I had to guess what the wort is made of I'd have to imagine ultra-filtered dregs of cream corn fermented with some corn sugar thrown in. Yeah, it's a high-alcohol corn-fest, and a waste of, perhaps, a few hops. This stuff is like drinking sweet alcohol infused filtered corn juice with a shot of CO2. Absolutely no imagination here. Doesn't Miller realize there is a grain called barley? The corn market would collapse overnight if Miller went out of business, lol! Truly a wasted effort by a major brewer trying to pass this off as a craft brew. Stay away."

"O) Tried a sample of this at a local bottle shop about a month ago. Honestly never thought I'd be drinking it again. Then my grandma gives me a sixer, because it was on sale, and she had a coupon. So now I'm just rambling... My point is, Miller wants you to put this in a tumbler, like it's some high brow shit. Well of course that's a crock. You keep this beer ice cold, and you pound it out of the bottle. If you maintain that approach, then under certain circumstances it will be okay. Thanks grandma... I'm glad it wasn't a sixer of Lite or MGD."
"O: This is kind of like a fancy pants, sofistimicated malt likka. While I'm not a fan, I honestly believe it exceeded my (hideously low) expectations. As an amber lager, though, it sucks. Even in the world of malt likkas, I'd rather drink Steel Reserve or Natty Daddy. Next!"
""
"The body is light but does, surprisingly enough, work its way toward medium. It doesn't quite reach it, though. Crispness is fizzy but consistent off the rolling carbonation, and the best I can say is that at least it doesn't get too slick, and it keeps up some semblance of smoothness."
"O: This is bad... but will make people who don't know/like beer think they are getting a more ""craft experience."" The place where this is drinkable: If pabst and yuengling are sold out and you are going boating that afternoon. Spending a day on the lake with this wouldn't be awful. Spending a night by the fire with your honey... well this would be like adding Robert Goulay throwing nuts at you."
""
""
""
""
"Chilling this beer only masks the poor quality of its creators. I had two just to ensure I wasn't mistaken, one off the shelf into a frozen glass, and one chilled for two days. The fact that it's considered an ale is almost an insult. Couldn't finish either of the I had."

"Takes like crap. Black Crown from Bud is so much better. Thankfully I only bought one can. I tend to like a little sweeter taste. This is bitter. No enjoyment in the drinking. Had to force it down. Never again. It seems like an experiment gone array. Back to Black Crown."
"BTW, if yer into this style Bud's Black Crown is a better bet. A bit less booze with a bit more body and mouthfeel."

"This bottle was given to me and I'm happy for that as this seems to be just a touch above so many adjuncts"
"This is a light-to-medium bodied ale with a nice fresh and crisp feel when it first hits your tongue. The malts really take over this ale and the mild bitterness, there are some mild fruit flavors in its aftertaste."

"This beer is truly horrible. I thought miller might have made something that was comparable to Busch signature copper lager, which suprisingly wasn't too bad, but damn.. This just tastes like a mustier version of busch, or coors, or something. Slick mouthfeel with the gross aftertaste of what I can only describe as metallic corn cobs. I believe another poster mentioned ""cooked vegetable", which also works. There is nothing special about this beer, it is gross. I feel bad that I gave a dollar for a single bottle. Jokes on me I guess, but what did I expect."
""
"24 ozzer for $2.50 at the Lititz Weis is a fast way to get there if you're OK with BMC adjunct lagers. It's definitely reddish without a lasting head. This isn't a fashion plate beer anyway. Flavor is getting better with that corny thing at mid taste pretty much going away. You can pick up the extra body but the 6.9% is pretty much in the background. An OK beer."
"Nose smells cheap and malt liquor like but the attractive copper color and bright clarity are appealing. Taste is very clean and marzen-like when ice cold, with an aftertaste of vanilla and caramel. As it warms, the flavors become more cloying, an adjunct taste emerges, and the flavor goes from marzen to MGD."
""
""
""
"I wouldn't choose this over any other big-brand brew and certainly not over a quality beer. The bartender and someone at our table both exclaimed ""Miller Fortune? It's new and hopped!"" which must be parroted from the marketing. This, my misinformed friend, is not hopped."

"Anyway, I liked it enough that I would probably buy it again."

"Sweet malty flavor, mild hop bitters, faint bourbony note, finishes sweet, just shy of cloying. Very slick and watery mouthfeel, this beer has NO body. Carbonation tingles in the finish."

"Overall: Tried to give it a fair shake - I seriously snagged a whole six-pack (it was late on Monday and everything but the nearby gas station was closed) - but it's rather nasty, I must say."

"Overall - the write-up is done and I still have 18 ounces left. I liked it more than I thought I would, I'd have it again."
""
""
"Overall this will not be a sipping experience tonight. Fortunately I can drink it quickly."
"It's easy enough to dislike macro brewery offerings, but this beer is fairly decent. Caramel and hints of honey sweetness are evident with a generally toasted note to things. Nothing exceptional, but certainly worth a try."
""
""
"Interesting beer. They've gone to a lot of trouble with the packaging, and I do have to say the shape and weight of the bottle are nice. It's a surprisingly deep amber color. Fingerprint clear through the glass. Fairly decent head retention - the lacing could be better for sure, as the spots that are left slide steadily down the glass before your eyes. The aroma is quite fruity and estery. Sweet malt is present as well, but also adjunct-like. Somewhat dextrinous in the mouth with a moderate carbonation that leaves it gently crisp. The flavor follows. Sweet with sugar and light malt flavors, some caramel but not much - adjunct-like overall. Pear, apple, and some dark skinned fruit... esters and alcohol... 6.9% shouldn't be so easily revealed, and I'm also finding what I think of as higher alcohols (in the way that it hits the back of my throat and then makes my face and ears turn red). Not much bitterness here, but balanced. It finishes drying with a bit of malt and a wash of alcohol to take it away. Some minor hop flavors may be appearing in the finish, leafy and floral. English in character, I'd think. And if I had to categorize this beer I'd probably classify it as some kind of English strong ale, but there's also a kind of malt liquor character to it that shoots that down. Brash. Alcoholic. Odd for a large brewery to allow that, especially in fancy packaging. I have to ding it on points for the flavor as it's got such a kind of ""hot fermentation"" aspect to it."

"From a 16 ounce can. Now reviewing it as an upscale Malt Liquor.  Easy drinking with much less of the grape or apple skin than before.  Not a beer I would drink on a regular basis but very good as a M.L."
""
""
"Cloying, hard to drink, and reminds me a lot of malt liquor. This is a nasty beer. Not worth trying again."
"This is an imbalanced gimmick. It leans towards a malt liquor. It says ""undistilled"" - well, I would think so, as it is a beer. Not a good one though. Adding boozy character to a bland red/amber lager doesn't make for a good beer, IMO."
"Miller Fortune brewed by Miller Brewing company. This brew has an ABV of 6.9. It pours out a dark amber color with a small white head. The smell is sweet and that of a american style beer. The taste is smooth but has that of malt liquor. There is nothing bad about brew. Nothing special but it is drinkable. I has a better taste than other brews with a higher alcohol content. This is something I can drink every now and again."
"Bought this one at the local wally world thinking, how bad can a Miller craft beer be? Ah, pretty bad. I won’t waste much time on this as others have said pretty much the same thing I would. Very disappointing “foray” into craft; I believe this is just marketing hype and agree that it’s competition with the similar lackluster Bud Platinum. Very mediocre appearance, substandard nose (adjunct grains), acerbic, un-redeeming flavor, and OK mouth. Overall: There are so many good and even mediocre alternatives available even at your local Wal-Mart. Do not bother with this over-marketed swill."

"Overall – Really nothing too spectacular here in my opinion. The bourbon flavors decent, but with the off flavors that accompany them, it really pulls away from the quality of the brew."
"Pours a lighter amber-gold in color with about a 1/2 of a finger of a white fizzy head that settles down to a thin layer on top and sides. Spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is on the 'sweet side' of corn, grain with a hint of caramel. The taste is more complex actually and hard to describe with the flavors mentioned above with the sweetness right up front followed with a hint of a apple juice flavor. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Actually goes down pretty easy and is different, but in a good way."
"PPS., Score one for homebrewers. The bottle is very dark, thick glass and re-cappable. The bottle has a pry off top, not a screw top. It does not taste very bad, is relatively inexpensive and after you drink enough of them, you have some really great dark, protective bottles for your next batch!!!"

"Miller Fortune ---2.5/5"
"I concur wholeheartedly with digitalflood's excellent and on-the-money review. I always thought Miller had a good 'beer' flavor but it was overly sanitized and HEAVILY carbonated. This is a pretty good attempt at a micro-brew product, and I've just had 4 flights in the last week."
""
" the taste is lacking, not great but for the style about on par with some malt flavor light caramel in the taste and some cooked corn elements with slight carbonic influcence and mild buttery diacetyl in the background, with a hint of vanilla ad light toasted notes the yeast flavor is the least desirable trait. Overall a basic strong lager -nothing special and could use more malt flavor. It comes off like a malt liquor which lacks inspiration."

"The last time I reviewed something from Miller it ended up dead last in my listing of beers I have personally reviewed. This time, it's a whole different story. This Fortune stuff is purty good. It has a beautiful dark-amber hue, although there is little head, staying power, or lacing. There's no smell to the beer - maybe a distant odor of barley, but barely. The mouthfeel was impressive, a nice mixture of carbonation with a thick, velvety texture. The taste was good, not so overpowering like many of those high alcohol content beers. Overall, I consider it outstanding - a refreshing taste for a beer at almost 7% content."

"Really dark glass bottle, why don't they use these for IPAs or something worth preserving from being light struck. Pours a fizzy deep copper the label boasts the 6.9% abv, white head dwindles away so quickly. Aroma has some grain husks, malt liquor like smells, a bit of apple fruitiness, with cooked veggies. Flavor super sweet somewhat alcohol finish, there's nothing smooth in this beer. Residual sugars flood the palate, cloying hard to finish the bottle. There's just no point in getting to know this beer anymore than the single 12 oz bottle I purchased. Mouthfeel fizzy carbonation, nothing good to say I can't believe this made it through the testing phases huge multi-million dollar ad campaign big brewers are ridiculous basically monkey see monkey do, this is right in line with Bud Light Platinum."

"O - It's a decent macro lager. I also like the 6.9% abv. It's no Busch Signature though."
"This is MIllers attempt at marketing to liquor drinkers.. The company even recommends bartenders to drink it from whiskey tumblers.. When I read that I couldn't believe it seeing as how it has almost no taste at all.. To me its like a lighter tasting beer than MGD.. and is has quite a bit more alcohol.. I have no idea how they pulled that off. But the beer is ok if you like light tasting beers and want to get drunk... but if you drink for the flavor.. well this beer almost has none...and what flavor it does have isn't great. Its an OK beer, but drinking it from a whiskey tumbler is just stupid.. This was made just for the money, seeing how as most alcohol sales is liquor.. Beer makers are tryin to get into some of that money.. Hence all the new beers with high ABV...not a true craft beer.. no matter what neone says.. I probably wont buy anymore of it. Plus I don't think it will even last, I cant see other people buyin much of it either."

"I had a couple of bottles of this through a deal at a Pistons game. Poured from a bottle with a reddish-copper color and a foamy white head. Has a very faint wheat aroma. Tastes like sweet bread, with a hint of cream and an even smaller hint of bitterness. Pretty light on taste, but still better than many other commercial lagers. Has a light mouthfeel, but not too watery. For what it is, it’s actually decent."

"This is a disappointment because I was really excited for this beer. I bought into the whole concept, and I was hoping that Miller (a good brewery) was going to seize the moment and make a solid ""craft"" style beer that Budweiser tried and failed to do. Unfortunately they missed the mark completely. Not only is it NOT better than Black Crown, its considerably worse. Its damn near undrinkable. Maybe on draft or out of a bottle it'll be a little better but I am reticent to try it again. A real shame because the packaging is really cool. A waste. For the same price as a 4pk of tall boys I can get a sixer of High Life or Genuine Draft and enjoy them much more."
"Clearly Miller's answer to Black Crown. It's an okay beer, I paid $6.50 for a six pack, so I guess I got what I paid for. Not the best, not the worst. Seems geared towards younger people, as it lacks carbonation and that full texture that most college aged kids avoid"

"First, some music. Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"" will act as a nice lead-in. The Crack! took place just as Lemmy's cracked voice began booming forth. Steve McQueen stepped on the gas and we were off and running. A massive two fingers of dense, tawny head formed above the liquid and we me made a wide left turn into madness, followed by a quick right and the chase was on. Color was a deep-gold (SRM = 7) with NE-quality clarity and everyone in the car began to wish that we were in Lincoln, NE, cozying up to Val Midwest, rather than being at The Tao of Steve's mercy, rocketing through Noe Valley in CAN FranCANisco. I leaned in for a sniff and it hit me like a right cross from Ronda Rousey! I smelled better from Minhas products and this was awful! Plastics factory, chewed pink bubble gum, dry cleaning plant and gas station tarmac all came immediately to mind. I may have played my last hand. Mammon, Midas and Croesus, all of whom had shown up for a taste, began to back away, checking to ensure that no one had any spark-producing devices. Mouthfeel was thin, watery and exuding a melange of other-worldly flavors like bubble gum and solvent. I will never employ a drain pour and then count it towards The CANQuest (TM), but I was sorely tempted in this case. Was this someone's idea of a joke? I CAN do much better. After a while, I began to make some headway, just as Mad Max showed up on his bike and instructed me to stuff a bedsheet wick into the opening and set it alight. We zoomed past the Miller headquarters in MKE and I let fly. Your Fortune may be more satisfactory."

"There is a subtle caramel sweetness up front and then a crisp, clean hop finish. This does have its own character but nothing that would persuade me to make this a staple in my beer drinking adventures. In some respects it reminds me of Country Club or Magnum malt liquor in a vogue can. At the same time I would not rate it poor like previous BA opinions. For the style it is what it is supposed to be and that in itself it worth a higher rating."
""
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of grains, not much going on. Taste is unusual and not so good, metallic, cereal grains, some alcohol, a touch of plastic. Feels light in the mouth and overall, even at this price point, not something I would buy again."
"O - From the simple, dark design (even the bottle is a darker brown glass) to the pry-off bottle cap, it's clear that Miller did a good job of making this brand classier than it's usual offerings but, let's also keep in mind Miller isn't trying to impress a single member of the craft beer community with this beer; it's brewed for the masses. My only gripe with Fortune is that I have a hard time finding any correlation to it's target market, bourbon whiskey, aside from the use of corn as an ingredient. Notes of vanilla, common to the spirit, emerge slightly in flavor but it's focus is primarily on the addition of caramel sweetness to the otherwise grainy pale malt base. The result is a slightly stronger lager that's relatively clean with more flavor than most Miller drinkers might be used to but nothing that will wow the seasoned craft drinker but again, this is not brewed for them anyway. With that said, aside from the noticeable adjunct flavor (still acceptable for it's style), Miller Fortune displays no bad traits. If it was handed to me, I wouldn't be terribly upset."
"Poured into a pint glass and was expecting a lot more. color was too pale. The taste was like a flat Miller lite Bad mouthful feeling and overall a tasteless beer. This by far has the worst beer i have had in months. I expexted more from Miller on this one"

"Btw, I made this account because it seemed like this was getting a bad rap it didn't deserve. Just please don't accept reviews looking at this as a beer. It fills a different place."

"I wasn't expecting much from this brew and wasn't disappointed. I poured the first half of my 24oz can into a rocks glass over ice (like Miller is advertising it), and poured the second half into a frosted pub glass like I do most of my beers. I preferred the latter over the former, but it still didn't make it a good brew. It has a slightly bourbon like flavor, but it's masked by the presence of cheap ingredients. This is just another gimmick brew from Miller that will make them large short term profits as this gets sampled on college campuses and trendy 20 something's night clubs nationwide. Once everyone has sampled it, they will stop buying it, and it will go down as another retired Miller brew."
""
"Good marketing, i.e. nice bottle, but that is to be expected."

"I'm reading into this New Miler Beer Fortune that Miller wants you to pour it over ice which I did after first taking my first few sips out of the bottle and my thoughts were we try again Miller Beer even with maybe a touch of the taste of whisky for this doesn't what's so ever meet what at least myself and with in a sec its like its flat and no spunk a watery make believe nothing should I say Never again."
""

"Taste similar to a yuengling without the hop notes..or a coors banquet with added corn and/rice..was expecting better I'll stick with my craft beers or yuengling/pabts for sessions..although not bad I was just hoping for more complexity..miller has all the resources to mass produce something great but as always with macro brews they want to cut corners to make money even it means cutting quality and overall experience.. But if you enjoy a malt type flavor it's up your ally..it's would actually be a great backbone to a good complex layer of citrusy and floral hoppiness.. For me I felt for 1.50 more I coulda got Sierra Nevada or aviator IPA and called it a day.."
"If this is Miller's response to microbrews, they have nothing to be afraid of. The beer didn't taste much different from their standard offerings. It is slightly darker in color than Miller Genuine Draft. The bourbon taste is weak. Save your money so you can spend it on a high quality craft beer."

"I'm glad I paid under a dollar for the bottle. I can say I've tried it and have given an honest critique, and I don't have to feel bad about wasting good money on it."

"This is a smooth but ""corny"" beer. This corny effect may not exist after one of these, but on the second or third the corny flavor becomes overwhelming. The bottle is trying to take on a modern look, and I appreciate the effort. The palate flavor is fairly light, but the after taste is too malt liquor for it not to be an actual malt liquor. Drinkable, but not desirable."
"Miller Fortune (2013) - 6.9% ABV. There was a time and place where to break the 5.8% ABV and strive for more than yellow fizz one would have to find a micro-brew. That time is long gone. So here we are in the age of mega-brewers and their micro-brew attempts. So comes Miller to bat with its latest creation. Pours a faint reddish amber. Little head with faint lacing. Very active carbonation. Apples, alcohol, and malt aromas. Oaky barley front palate. Quick sting of alcohol. Faint hops and bread mid-palate. Very strong. Rough and sharp. A juxtaposition to typical high ABV brews. No hop notes on the back palate. This is malt and alcohol. I've heard comparisons to malt liquor and I can see why, but this is far smoother than malt liquor. There is a faint sweetness. Caramel corn. Some dry malt rows. A lingering oak and smoke. Miller is said to have based the taste structure around whiskey. I can see that. This is a sharp stinging beer with deep sugar flavors transposed over smoke and oak. It is a sipping beer. I can't imagine trying to session this without a headache ensuing the next day. Is it a grand achievement? No. But I will give Miller this-- they took a risk and there is no way you can say they were copying their big brewer brothers... this is something different. High end malt liquor? Yes, this is it. 3.7 out of 5. Good."
"O - Not bad for a AAL. The 6.9 ABV is a little on the high side for a session beer."
"Overall - Good session beer, Miller gets my approval"
"o: there is a hotness i don't care for. it's not that high in alcohol but unfortunately there is nothing else there to give it some complexity. almost like this was trying to be a 'beam and coke'. not my cup of tea."
""
""
"Not at all bad, but way faster than what Lite beer drinkers are used to. Or even High Life drinkers. Start with one of these and switch off to 5% or lower if you plan to last the evening. Holds its own with Batch 19, although the Coors is arguably the better brew when all is said and done. Should be interesting when matched against Black Crown and Becks Sapphire."

"I'm somewhat surprised here. Even though I have an appreciation for some of the less loved end of the beer aisle, anything with the actual Miller name on it has been a no-go for me for years. Well, this is the best product that says Miller on it I've ever had. After some consideration I'd say it sits on a fence between the ideal malt liquor & your typical red. Worth it if you're into both."

"I am shocked that Miller did such a good job brewing this beer. It has a nice 2 finger head on it, a awesome amber color that you wouldnt expect from a miller product. The taste and mouthfeel in my opinion is a full body beer backed up by a 6.9% abv. I would choose this over budweiser black crown or the bud light platinum any day of the week. Hands down for a american adjunct lager this is great!"
"anyway,I think Miller did a GR8 Job with this Beer,and while I Myself really enjoy it's overall Flavor and Taste quite a Bit,I just do not know if it will take off to become the Huge Seller Miller is Banking on..it may be a bit too Obscure for mass consumption,too pricey for the College Kids who will more than likley stick with the $10.99 30 packs or cheaper malt liquors like Mickey's and Steel reserve,and perhaps a bit too bold for the average Beer drinker ..I Guess only time will tell eh? cheers and Peace2all:)"
""
"All in all, not bad, the slightly less than 7 percent ABV is nice if you are trying to feel good, because at the same time it is light, tastes better than a Bud Light - but still priced at a good price. If you are looking for mostly good taste, I might look elsewhere - however."

"$2.75 for a 24oz can. Is it a good deal? I don't know. I won't ever buy this again. The business reporting on this beer was hilariously ignorant: 'Miller Fortune is brewed with Cascade hops to give it its bourbon-like flavor. Bloomberg describes the taste as “resting somewhere between a craft beer and a light lager.” ' I got no bourbon or cascade hops(which obviously don't create a bourbon-like flavor). I would recommend this for 40oz drinkers who want something classier but don't actually want to drink craft beer or quality imports etc."

"This pours a clear, dark amber color with a slight white head. The aroma is bold with grassy grains. The taste is bold but has a bitter bite at first. It is fairly drinkable with an ok taste but the after taste is a little nasty. Always happy to try something new, but this didn’t live up to the excitement."
