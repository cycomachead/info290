"A nice red lager, nice malty finish.  Wish it had better mouth feel, kind of thin.  Drinkable."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Thick golden head, with a dark appearance. Goes down smooth, not too bitter for sure. A real solid drinking beer one can enjoy. It's a lot better than I expected."

"Capital Brewery Winter Sk√•l ---3.5/5"
"O-A boring, overly malty beer without much in the way of flavor."

"A good amber ale. Nice mix of malt and hops for the winter season!"

"A decent enough beer, definitely a malt-forward lager, as it should be. But the taste is kind of a mess, with mismatched pieces crashing into each other and battling for dominance."

"Taste, pretty smooth, inoffensive stuff, the nuttiness of the aroma is slightly disappointing for its lack of a coming out party on the taste buds, but its still ok. Real mello, a little bit of toffee and caramel, this is probably a good choice for drinkers who don't like hoppy or very strong beers. Filler beer is how its known at my house. I do have another situation I would recommend it though, if you just came in from the snow, but you're now sitting by a warm fire, I can see this working in the winter like that."
"O: While this wasn't what I expected with a name like 'winter skal', I enjoyed it overall and would recomend it to any BMC drinker that wants something more complex without going to far away from the comfort zone."

"A very excellent balance of hop and malt; enough hops to keep you satisfied, and a strong enough malt to really impress you. One of my favorites from Capital."
"Skal pours a dark amber color, with a nice size head. There is a strong malty aroma, with hints of floral notes. The taste has a nice malty backbone like most red lagers, but has a strong hoppy flavor. Good full flavor, enjoy the hop flavors, finishes bitter. Overall I found this a very good and interesting Amber, the bitterness really makes this beer enjoyable."

"D/O: Wisconsin's Capital Brewery is generally pretty good at letting the quality of its beers establish it as a very conservative, but proficient, producer. This beer is a departure, with discordant qualities and a wildly-oscillating level of sweetness that is never able to become comfortable on the palate. It is a seasonal whose useful lifespan has elapsed."

"Maybe I left this in the fridge too long. Best I can say is it freed up some space in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well it sure is different so I will grant them kudos for creativity but I cannot say that I would care to try this again"
"D/O- Very drinkable, although just one step above a macro for me. I do not think I would have this again as I wasn't a big fan."

"The main memorable feature I am left with is that here is a 'spiced winter' themed brew that keeps things restrained and subtle on the spicing. It does not taste like pumpkin pie spicing nor like spicy chinese takeout, as other heavily herbed/spiced winter warmers often do. So, if you prefer your spiced beer lighter on the spice factor than most, this is the easy-drinking brew for you."
""
"O: This beer had some decent flavors, but it could have benefited from a little more caramel malt flavors and a little less carbonation. Overall a solid beer though."
""
"Plus, they sell it everywhere-Mariano's, Binny's and Jewel Food Store."
""
""
"Light bodied with high carbonation and it finishes dry. Not much to like about this beer. I won't go out of my way to find it again."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent summer beer for a malt lover."
""
""
"Easy drinking and pretty tasty. Refreshing and quite crushable for a beer with this much character and personality. I don't usually reach for lagers in the winter, but this is pretty tasty."
"Overall: Not exactly sure why this is a winter seasonal. But I am sure that this is an excellent Vienna-like lager - well balanced with tasty malts but a nice, dry hop kick. Capital knows how to make lagers with the best of them."

"Freshly-tapped kegs are always attractive when skimming the board, right? This example pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises toasted biscuit, toffee, light brown sugar, and a few pinches of allspice. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more brown sugar, some cinnamon, some light maple syrup, and a twinge of ginger. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice winter brew, nothing amazing, but a nice, easy-going brew with some mild spicing."
"Had a pint at the Pig & Fiddle in Edina. Not a bad beer, but it's an American amber lager with holiday spices added. It's not a bad mix, but I'd enjoy the beer just as much without it. The malt gives a dry, crisp bready caramel with a hint of toffee. The lager feels a little off and lacks the fruity esters of a winter warmer. Though I guess if we're calling it an amber lager, it does alright. Worth a try."
"O) Another highly enjoyable lager from Capital Brewery."
""
"As I just mentioned in my review of Capital's Oktoberfest, many of Capital's beers taste about the same to me but I do like that ""taste"" so I generally will give their brews favorable reviews. Some characteristics that I was able to pick out though about this offering was a fair amount of biscuit/bready maltiness and a small bit of holiday spiciness. Maybe some ginger or nutmeg?"
"O. A great wintertime beer. I can see myself enjoying several of these next to a fire on a sleepy snowed-in weekend. Couldn't see myself drinking these outside the late fall/winter months (but it's a seasonal brew anyway."
"The capital city brewery winter skal is a decent beer. The appearance was a rich amber with very thin white head. The scent has spice and malt which was decent. The taste had ginger/nutmeg which provides a nice wintery delight. The mouthfeel was decent and would be perfect of cold nights. I recommend this for those that want good flavor without being to heavy."
"A very nice amber lager in general, I could definitely see myself having more of these with the right season."
"Good crisp mouth, that mellows to a moderate fullness. Toasted caramel, toast, light juicy hops. Finish is bready and full. This is a pretty good lager here. Not one of my favorite styles, but a good representation. I'm continually impressed with Capital. Keep it up."
"This was a nice medium bodied beer with goof flavor. Not overpowering. Sweet caramel malt flavor with a bit of a bitter finish. Pretty easy drinking beer, but not one of my favorites. It's worth a try though."
"This beer pours a clear bright red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of toffee, and caramel with a very faint hint of herbal hops. The taste is very sweet with a ton of caramel. The faint hop character that is noticeable in the aroma is not present in the taste, and I think that is a real shame as it might have helped things from becoming as cloying as they are. The mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky with low carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer that I'm sure a lot of people would really like, but I can't see myself drinking it again as it is just far too cloying for my tastes."
"Pours a light bronze color and is quite transparent, though no real visible carbonation. Pretty good head with some nice lacing as it goes down. Persistent head with good retention. Nice cap as it eventually falls. The nose has a bit of light toasted bread plus a touch of caramel. Taste has a bit of grain and bread and a mild bitterness on the back end. Finishes pretty dry after a light body with higher levels of carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough. Not my favorite style, but this does a decent job hitting the high notes that I'd consider possibilities here."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer. It is not something I like to have too many of but has become somewhat of a ritual in the early winter season."
"2/13: Revisited this beer and lowered all my previous rankings by .25."
"D - Considering I'm not a huge fan of amber ales/red lagers, this is a interesting change. Solid and worth a try; nothing earth-shattering here, but give it a go."
"Drinkability - This beer lacks the heft of others appearing this time of year, but is by no means a low quality beer. I don't find myself choosing this one often, but there's no reason someone who doesn't feel the need to spend an hour with a beer during the winter might not make this their go-to beer."
"This beer is about as basic as it gets, with little flavor. Like a watered down butterier oktoberfest beer."
"D - Not hard to drink, but doesn't have me running back to the fridge. Could have one or two more though."
"I was underwhelmed. Easy to drink, but I don't feel I could pick it out of a lineup."
"Mine was overwhelmingly dominated by a honey taste, though a solid amber style taste was discernible for about the 1st second of every sip. The color looked like a fairly light orange, not dark enough for amber and nowhere near red. I was pretty disappointed with this one, since I felt like I was drinking out of a beehive."
"Taste: Not as good as the smell was. There is a nice malty flavor that is followed by a bitterness but the bitterness doesn't really compliment the sweetness for some reason. Not bad but could be better."
"Tasty brew, glad I have several bottles as the football Sunday progesses - a real session type frosty that would work well in the summer too."
"D -- Very nice amber lager. Goes down nicely."
"I find this to be very drinkable. Would be one I would like to have on tap and sit and drink a few."
"Overall I was told this was a great seasonal. Well I beg to differ. This was just another ""marzen"" to throw on the pile. Nothing really distinguishable about this beer at all."
"A hard pour leaves me an amber brew with a billowing cap of foam which eventually settles into a pillow-like situation that left decent lacing down the glass. The aroma consists of caramel sweetness from toasted malt nicely balanced by spicy notes from the hops, clove perhaps. Sweet and grainy on the palate. The spice from the hops lingers a few seconds after the beer has been swallowed. The faintest indication of a metallic character also lingers. It is not strong enough to be off-putting but certainly exists. This light-bodied brew is good. To achieve greatness it would need added complexity and an element of uniqueness."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice big bite of carbonation."
"O - Winter Sk√•l is a fairly straight-forward malty amber lager with subtle floral hop nuances that provide good balance for an easy drinking and smooth winter lager."
"drinkability is good - if you want a easy drinking holiday lager this will fit the bill"
"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass, beer is a rusty/copper color with a pillowy tan head. The nose is rather weak and non-distinct. A bit of stale grain is all that is discernable. The taste retains some caramel and biscuity flavors with a touch of hop bitterness and flavor, there is also a slight citrus sourness at the end. The mouthfeel is light in body and has a smooth, velvety carbonation. Overall a drinkable beer, it would be interesting to try this beer when it was actually in season."
"Pretty good beer I must say, I hope to try more from this brewery in the future."
"Pours a perfectly clear amber with a decent cr√®me head that fell fast. Mild fruity malts and mild hops on the nose. Flavor is slight salty with a touch of citric bite. Not abrasive by any means. Smooth and not trying to be showy. Feel is smooth in liquid. Carbonation bites a bit. Easy to drink. I'm going to peg this as a pale ale. Not too shabby."
"Pours out a pretty nice orange-red with a white head that fades quickly into the beer. Light caramel malt nose, not much too it. Taste is a mix of spices, caramel malt, and slight hoppy bitterness to it. Very well balanced interesting amber lager, much spicier than riverwest stein, but very nice. Warming sweetness in the finish makes this a wonderful candidate for a cold night. Pretty heavy carbonation adds to the drinkability of this beer. Makes it much more refreshing."
"Notes from and tasted on: 01/11/06."
"D-Decent brew. Nothing too exciting as far as flavor and complexity, but it's still a tasty and easy-to-drink brew."
"Thanks to my bro for this one...beer for Christmas!"
"They should call this a nice session beer, not much to satisfy your winter needs."
"This light bodied well carbonated beer is a ""wet"" beer, no dryness or bittering hops evident, just the mild sweet malt with a hint of spice. I wasn't overly impressed by this."
"Not bad overall, but nothing to blow the socks off. Worth giving a shot."
"D: Very good winter seasonal. Highly recommended."
"Poured crystal clear, light amber, big pillowy tan head. Great looking beer! Nice fresh smell with a hint of spice and citrus. Very malty taste typical of the style. Very light carbonation went nicely with the taste. Also noted a little warming as it went down, but no real noticeable taste of alcohol, which was also nice. Medium/light mouthfeel. VERY drinkable beer that I will enjoy again."
"D= A very drinkable and very enjoyable beer. I could easily drink a bunch of these and not regret it! Very sessionable!"
"Pours a straight up clear amber, with a one finger head after the pour that diminishes to next to nothing pretty quick. Little to no bubbling. Somewhat sweet, toasted caramel and crystal malt aroma. Faintly citrus, bitter caramel is the aroma. Starts with a bittersweet, malty, melba toast malt. Then some well placed hop citrus hits the middle, allthe way through to the finish and linger of this beer's taste. A little spicey in the hoppy mouthfeel of this beer. Only the spicey finish and linger of this beers flavor and palate makes me think of winter. Other than that, a blind taste test would convince my tastebuds that this was a west coast amber ale. Not a Wisconsin Winter seasnal brew. VERY sessionable though. Should consider producing all year round."
"Conclusion: Nothing's necessarily ""wrong"" with this beer, it's a decent amber lager in the American style...and for what it is, it's tasty and deft. a cut above some of its competitors. However, it's nothing special...perhaps a good beer to really introduce the BMC crowd into ""real"" beer?"
"D- easy enough to knock back a few in a sitting. not so strong so it wouldnt be a bad idea either."
"In my usual hit or miss experience with beer from Capital Brewery, this one is a miss. While a crisp beer, the taste really left a lot to be desired.... as in there wasn't any taste. Of course the benefit of that is no lingering bad aftertaste though. All that being said it is a seasonal beer and who knows maybe it's just a bad recipe this year. Personally I'm waiting for Redhook's WinterHook as that consistently delivers year in and year out."
"Very nice offering from Capitol, well worth a try."
"Clean and crisp with just enough body. Actually a really nice lager. I'd be happy to drink this for an evening."
" ~ I was pleasantly surprised with this Capital brew. I don't think I'd pay for a six pack but I would partake in another should it cross my path down the road."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent beer as the flavors improved as it warmed slightly."
"Drinkability: It's alright beer. If you have a problem with that, why don't you go cry into your pillow?"
"Pours a creamy amber red, almost copper color, with a foamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells of a sweet malt, with hints of orange and a bit of hops to finish. Mouthfeel was very light, almost watery. Not terrible, but for the aroma I wanted a heavier silk feel. Tasted simple, but not in a bad way. Starts with the sweetness of the malt and finishes with a crisp hint of hops. Overall, a very solid offering. If the mouthfeel lived up to the aroma/taste it would be better, but still a good seasonal brew."
"Only had a single, but several would be nice any time of the year. The unique orange spice element is reminiscent of Jenlain Noel, another winter seasonal."
"D- the finish becomes a little cloying by the end but otherwise ok"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a copper light reddish color with a soda pop white head that fizzed away in a matter of seconds. Smell is faint malt aroma slight hop aroma. Taste creamy malt flavors with just a hint of carmel. Mouthfeel is light body but a little over carbonated. Pretty easy to drink but not my favorite of the style."
"D - This is a very nice beer. Certainly worth a try during the winter season."
"Other reviewers have stated that this isn't a big, complex beer and I would agree. What you do get is a solid lager with a good taste that is satisfying and quaffable. Carbonation is spot on and is light bodied. Don't have to worry about drinking several of these in an evening and have them hurting you either."
"definitely recommended."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Fairly uninspiring appearance, ""rusty amber"". Smells of malt and caramel, and tastes the same. Never a big fan of these types, and this did nothing to change my thinking. Actually managed to get worse with each drink. Really just didn't work for me on any level."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and refined brew that does not need to be bold or rich. it is solid and well proportioned, making it a perfect winter brew. cheers!"
"I'm not a big fan of lagers. The American Macro market has destroyed my respect for the style, especially after going to Germany and finding that their standard lagers, while better than a Bud, are still lacking in every category. Recently, however, I've been privy to some outstanding lagers changing my opinion. So if you think my review is a bit high for this one, just know that I'm reviewing 80% for the style and 20%personal taste. It accomplishes something many lagers try to achieve. The hops are still important, but there is a great malt character for such a traditionaly hoppy and thin style of beer. Very nice."
"Overall, Winter Skal is another very good lager... I wish more breweries had the skills to pull something like this off; it's still European in nature, but wth just a touch of the Americas to make it different."
"A very nice lager here. I picked it up on a whim while traveling in Wisconsin. A great session beer. Flavor is smooth and subtle."
"Well thought out and put together. Invites you to drink more than one."
"It is not powerful, extreme or complex, but still has a nice flavor to it, easy to drink, quite pleasant."
"D- This beer is very clean and has some nice flavors but the tartness is a bit off and breaks up the balance of malt and hops."
"Drinkability: Notmally, not my favorite style, seems to be a catch all that catches soem crap. Howver, I found this beer to be malty and substantial."
"D - Overall a very solid beer, nothing terribly outstanding, but it is refreshing and relatively well-priced. Try it, its good."
"overall i really enjoyed this, wasnt priced too bad i think just over $7 for a 6-pack"
"D - Easy drinking but nothing exciting."
"single from Riley's in Madison, brought back in a suitcase"
"Drinkability is average. Kind of depressing to drink. Winter is already depressing enough, this only adds to it. Woah, where did that come from? This beer was much thicker than a BMC, but I couldn¬ít help but think the flavor was similar."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"A believable take on German brewing that really hits the spot."
"Drinkability: Not the most interesting or fun red ale out there, but still quite sessionable."
"Drinkability & Notes ¬ñ So smooth and easy to drink with a solid flavor profile. I like this beer, but its not really heavy enough to be a winter beer, more of a fall beer in my mind."
"Light orange/copper color, very clear. Only has a faint head that evaporates quickly leaving it looking a bit dull. Aroma of mild hops and bready, caramel malt hits the nose, with also a hint of peppery, citrus spice. Taste is stronger on the malt side, with a breadiness up front. The finish has a slight nutty sourness, though not bitter. Mouthfeel is light, but not watery. Fairly smooth, it has adequate carbonation. The flavor doesn't get you too excited, but there's not much bad you say about this brew. The alcohol seems pretty low and I would say it goes down pretty easy..."
"Pours a nice golden amber color with a nice foamy head that lasts for about 2 minutes and shrinks to a thin film, with the first pour lacing lasting but none down the glass. Don't get much from the smell, but I do get a hop and slightly peppery presense and a good pilsner malt aroma. Taste-wise, a good hop presense with bready malt and some carmelization, mildly fruity and a hint of pepper. Mouthfeel is good, and it feels like a good deal of alcohol, enough to feel like a winter warmer. Another good session beer from Capital."
"drinkability: session"
"Pint poured at Quivey's Grove in Fitchburg, WI. This beer has a clear copper color with a small head. Malty aroma with a little bit of fruit and occasional bursts of alcohol in the nose. The flavor is very much like grain. Capital beers really give you a sense of the flavor of the ingredients that go into beer. Lightly fruity. Just a hint of hops in the finish. Alcohol is noticable. This beer does not have the most complex flavors, but I enjoy it."
"Served a bright orange-amber with a finger of off-white head. Nose is musty and malty with a bit of fruity-citrus. Taste continues with an oktoberfest mustiness, some floral hoppiness, and light fruits. Mouthfeel is crisp and slick. The alcohol seemed on the high side for an amber lager but was welcome as it was about 5 degrees outside. A nice winter warmer from Capital minus the overdone spiceyness of most."
"Yet another version of a session lager from Capital Brewery, Winter Sk√•l pours a dark amber with little head retention or lacing. It smells rather subdued and malty at that, but tastes judiciously hopped. There's a bit of mustiness, and the mouthfeel has a significant amount of harshness. To me this feels like they just threw some hops into their Oktoberfest. Still, the hops are welcome, and this is a tasty winter beer option for those looking to escape the ranks of winter warmers."
"It has been a while since I had this beer. Back when I enjoyed this beer the weather was more seasonal, which makes this beer a good try. The thing that brought me to this beer was that it was brewed by one of my favorite breweries (Capital), so I thought to give it a try. I purchased this one at my favorite liqour spot, when I was in Whitewater (for college), Corido's Liqour Locker. When I got home, I popped off the top and started to enjoy it. I was suprised at how sweet the beer, was seeing that Capital, to me, is more bitter than usual. After that it was surely enjoyable. When the time is right and if you have a lady friend, you'll appreciate this beer more than often on those cold Wisconsin night. Cheers"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-syle glass. It pours a slightly hazy light amber color with two fingers of head that have good retention. Nice lacing too. The smell has a pilsener malty aroma to it, with a decent amount of hops. Nice and full for a lager. The taste is also malty at first, with a good caramel flavor. There's a little bit of biscuit malt as well. The finish is nice and hoppy. It's very well balanced. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is very nice. A big thanks to Kev for this solid brew."
"798"
"This beer gets right down to business, biting the tongue with a sharp, burning fizziness as it enters the mouth. This biting subsides as the beer slides closer to home, and is evocative of honey and a light sweetness as it takes the plunge down the throat. It may have been my imagination, but the beer, as it journeys along the tongue, shooting off new, impressive flavors as it moves, like a wagon full of ignited fireworks, seems to produce a sensation of a sort of rolling. The beer- the flavor, that is, has its own character that feels like it's determined to make you keep enjoying the beer well after the last of it has been carefully swallowed. Also, it burps well."
"Pours an orange-amber with a sticky, light khaki head. Nose is filled with caramelized vegetables, brown sugar, faint spice, and spicy, vegetal hops. Taste is much like the smell. Very vegetable-y, yet sweet with caramally malts. Hops provide ample balance--spicy and green. Finish is sweetish with light bitterness. Nice, light carbonation enhances the full, thick mouthfeel. Robust amber lager but goes down easily."
"Overall, this probably isn't a beer I'd buy again. I'd much rather drink Schell Firebrick, or even Capital's Autumnal Fire."
"Every Capital beer I've ever had is flawed in a minor way, but these flaws are never enough to keep me from drinking several of them or trying a new Capital production or style. Easy to drink and complex enough to keep me interested, they're always very good."
"Overall, I would say that as far as a winter offering is concerned, this is certainly interesting. A good beer."
"Another of my spoils from Wisconsin. The beer pours a nice red/amber color with 2 fingers of head that is rather fleeting. Pretty much what I would expect here. The nose is caramel sweetness, with a hint of what a marzen smells like. Touches of the funk of a lager, but not offensive as other lagers can be. The flavor is nice, for a lager. The flavor is caramel and some hints of toffee. Its like a Killians Red, but actually good. The feel is right at the interface between moderate and thick, with hints of a creamy texture in there. Good good beer. Drinkability is good as well. The aftertaste sticks on sweet and a hint grainey. It keeps me coming back for more. I do like the beer a lot. Not neceassarily what I want in a winter beer, but it is very good non the less."
"Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a soft and delicate carbonation in a medium body. Very easy drinking here. It fits in with most of the Capital beers though, not too exciting."
"Pretty copper hue, with a nice white head, it's crystal clear. Nice balanced aroma, malty (sweet and nutty), some floral hops, and a crisp and spicey yeast aroma. Good malt flavor upfront, bready then nutty, with mild bitterness. It finishes clean with a sparkling carbonation and a caramel aftertaste. This beer won't make me excitied for winter as Capital claims, but it may help the time pass more easily."
"Rich and satisfying, Capital Brewery's Winter Skal delivers a straght-forward Oktoberfest/bock-like lager that's captivating and drinkable! It's clear auburn body rests gently beneath a short head of off-white foam that drops steadily to an average collar and leaves only traces of lace about the glass. It's distinctly malty in the aroma with only a hint of floral hops in the background. The body is decidedly medium, and combines with its moderate carbonation to leaves it silky smooth and creamy across the palate. Rich, grainy, Munich malt dominates the flavor. It's well-balanced by a firm bitterness and tempered by its mild, floral and spicy hop flavors. The alcohol never becomes apparent; and although it's not particularily complex, it never fails to satisfy. An exceptional winter seasonal that doesn't have to rely on spices or fruit to earn it's place at your table or gathering."
"Poured a clear reddish-copper in color with a short-lived layer of thick off-white head. Sparse glass lacing. Zesty wintertime nose of spices, caramel sweetness, and some grassy hops. Flavor starts off sweet, much like a Heath bar. A spicy toffee flavor that fades once the hops arrive. Nothing lingering in the aftertaste. Nothing harsh or unsettling in the flavor. Well-balanced. Mouthfeel is ever-so-slightly thin. Still, a very tasty winter brew. I'd seek this one out again."
"Winter Skal is one of the best Capital beers that I've had yet. Considering the style, it's one damn fine winter seasonal."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Nothing outstanding but well made beer."
"It was poured with a very minimal head, maybe that was just the server, and it didn't really stick around or come back with swirling. It was a deep dark amber color. The aroma was subtly but mostly hoppy. The taste was strongly hoppy with a floral nature and a definite bitterness. It finished with a mild malty, sweet flavor with hints of nuttiness. I didn't think it was carbonated enough."
"Overall: Big Thanks to BigHuge for this one, my fourth Capital Brewery beer and another good one. Worth keeping an eye out for this one."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the trade."
"First impressions of flavor is CO2 cutting into a soft malt with a growing hop spice that cuts into the mid palate with an agressiveness. The finish marks the arrival of the caramel hinted at in the aroma finally mixed with spicy hops and dried fruits."
"Kind of a thin mouthfeel, but very easy to drink. Nice beer here!"
"Looks exactly like a glass of iced tea. Clear brown, with very little carbonation, and a white head that shrinks to just covering the top of the beer. Smells exactly like a red should. A little sour, a little malt. Tastes fruity and a little hoppy. A fine red, but not something I would reach for on a cold winter night."
"Pours a beautiful copper with a red tinge to it and a nice creamy off white head that trails all the way down the glass. Nicely toasty malt is the only aroma that my cold filled nose will let through. Great mellow toasty maltiness throughout that seems to just glide across your tongue with some subtle earthy hops at the end. Smooth and soft as it glides across my palate this brew is a joy to drink. I haven't been reviewing much lately but this brew may have turned that trend around. Very tasty and not heavy or cloying I could drink this all night long. A big thanks to Bighuge for sending it my way."
"Sampled 10/3/03"
"Deep clear- amber in color, has a nice white head that doesn't last very long, light malty bready aroma. Sweet caramel malty flavor, mild hop profile it does have a nice clean finish, light to medium body, seems kind of bland and watery, overall not all that bad but average."
"One of the better lagers I've had...The first time I had it I was disappointed...I expected a hearty old ale...this is just a lager but a special one...it is not spiced or anything like that but I would put the quality of this lager up against anything brewed...sweet almost vienna style maltiness, but balanced with a perfect husky hoppy finish...just a splendid beer.."
"Somewhat of a dark copper color on the pour. A small white head that wants to take off early. Some lacing occuring. This is an interesting concoction. Reminded me of sam adams double bock on the first taste. Some caramel taste, slight hop bitterness. Theres no listing of the alcohol content, but it might be a little higher than some. I'll say this, next winter i will pick up another 6er of this."
"Brilliantly clear ruddy bronze hue, topped by an ivory white uniformily thick, well retained head. Sparse lace remains. The aroma is dominated by a combination of grassy and pronounced spicy noble hops, underset by mellow toasty Munich and medium caramel malt sweetness. Snap of candyish sweetness is perceived upfront, then is tapered by mellow toast and mild, clean, functional hop bitterness. Hop bitterness is evanescent, allowing sweetness to quickly reemerge along with a mildly toffeeish caramel malt and melanoidin combination mid palate. Herbal hop flavor adds a mellow, chlorophyll tinged contrast. Moderately bodied overall, but a touch thin and fleeting in mouthfeel. Finishes lightly sweet and bready, but otherwise clean and crisp. Winter Skai is a unique, balanced brew. It seems to occupy a precarious niche between dunkels and hellesbocks, having elements of both. Tasty. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for sending the bottle!"
"Color is a clear amber with a thin off-white bubbly-foamy head that fizzed away after a minute and had some light patchy lace. Smell is very nice, its a sweet fruity delight of green grapes along with a bit of apple and peach and has a smoothing sweet malt backing. The smell and taste was very close to Hales Wee Heavy Winter but just a tad lighter. The taste is mild and light with a clean, sweet, smooth malt with a very slight and mildly bright hop thats citrusy/tangy, just a bit of green grapes and apple; all very subtle and smooth. Feel is light bodied and silky smooth, has a interesting light tang hold that reminds me of a wet wine and gets barely dry in the finish. This is very drinkable and is a very subtle, intesting beer. Yep, I liked it. Thank you, may I have another."
"The color on the pour a limpid deep copper, the head portly in size, frothy in texture and a nice light tan color, as it dissipates the lace left behind seals off the glass. Personally I think this a sign of a well-brewed beer, along with the bazillion tiny bubbles lifting from the bottom of the glass. Nose malt and lightly sweet, musty and a tad yeasty, fresh and pleasing the nose on this beer. Start sweet, lots of malt top moderate in its feel, finish has a delightful hop spicy presence, the carbonation tolerable and the aftertaste somewhat dry, quite a quaffable brew it is true."
"Try one."
"10-04-03 Just had a bottle from last year's batch the other day, and must append this caveat to the above bit of diffidence. Maybe it got better over the months, or maybe my mind and tastes have been altered, but it's better than I said. Much better. When the new batch comes out, I'll do a better one."
"What a great appearance this beer has, shiny amber and a rather large, creamy head that leaves a nice lace. Strong maltiness is in the aroma, nice caramel nature. The mouthfeel is nicely creamy, very smooth beer. Flavors of malt sweetness and caramelization hit first, and then some hops are evident through the finish. I'm very pleased with this beer. I bought it on a whim and got lucky, worth a try for sure."
"And especially gorgeous on tap."
"This is a very good beer, not what I expected for a seasonal winter beer, but I warmed to it very quickly."
"Copper in color with a light beige head. Malty aroma smells too much like the spent grain we used to feed our dairy cows when I was growing up for my liking. Nice lightly roasted malt flavor that is well balanced by the hops. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. I had Capital's Summer Tour Pack and felt the beers were all good and a couple were very good. This peaked my interest in their Winter Skal which thanks to Bighuge I was able to obtain. This is a solid beer, but it didn't acheive that very good to exceptional score in my book that I was hoping for."
"Pours amber with a malty spicy smell. The taste is big on caramel malt and the hops start to come through as it warms. I can see why others might call this a lager rather than an ale. Whatever it is, I enjoyed it and I'm sure I will enjoy the remaining three."
"Poured a clear copper in color with an off - white head. Signs of carbonation present in 3 columns of small bubbles. Aroma primarily consists of malts and hops. Creamy mouthfeel with a mild carbonation tingle in the middle. Bready malt flavor with a touch of spiciness in the finish. Very reminiscent of an Oktoberfest. Not what I expected in a winter seasonal beer, but very good non-the-less."
"Clear copper color, not much head to describe, just a trace in 45 seconds. Firm but not heavy sense of caramel to the malty aroma. Satiny mouthfeel, sense of brown sugar and good toast impressions. Hop sparkle close to the swallow. What's somewhat dissappointing is the mid-mouth flavor. The early malty tastes seem to vanish, giving this beer an awkward pause in the middle. This beer is good, and a step away from being truly solid."
"Capital Winter Skal:  Cripes, I know it‚Äôs the dead of summer, but they sold it to my wife last week, so its gotta be reviewed.  Hey, not bad!  Deep red beer, with a great big hops aroma (good sign in June) The taste was full of malt, with a pleasant spiciness, followed up with hops in the follow through and the aftertaste.  Not bad for an old beer (thank you hops). I‚Äôll look for this next Dec. 21."
"Lighter amber in color and clear.  Medium  and fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Aroma is very pleasant and complex with qualities of malt and hops, plus alcohol and an almost spicy quality.  Has the thinner quality of a lager, yet a heartiness to it.  Taste is complex too with the hop bitterness dominating, but the caramel malt helping to rounding it off and make it very smooth.  Pretty dry finish and that remains for a lingering aftertaste.  This is as complex a lager as I have tasted. It has the Vienna qualities of a lager with maltiness and smoothness of a California Common."
"This is just an outstanding lager.  It IS my favorite lager of all time.  It has a beautiful appearance and smell, delicious taste and a smooth clean finish.  Could drink a lot of these in one sitting."
