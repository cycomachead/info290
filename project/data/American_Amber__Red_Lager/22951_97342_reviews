"The hops shine through and make up for the fruity flavors that ale yeast would usually supply with fresher flavors."

"Maybe it was from the alcohol but had I bought another bottle, it would have been easy to polish that off in a sitting. While not a session beer, there was enough to like here without this feeling weak or watered-down and this was about as balanced a beer as I've had for this style. A bit of brown sugar would have made this stand out more but as it was, I enjoyed this more than I would most other lagers, because of how much it resembled an ale. Worth a go one for anyone who loves balanced beers or American Ambers."

"When poured it has a dark reddish color body with a small foamy head. The smell has a grapefruit, fruity hop aroma to it. The taste has a citrus hop up front, then the a little bitterness comes into play. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a great hop flavor."

"On tap at Old Chicago Plymouth Clown Shoes tap invasion. Nice dark amber with a thinnish cap of foam. Heavy lace. Smells orange, flowerys, hay, grassy. Taste is crisp, lightly citric and floral. Moderately bitter. Medium body. Easy to drink and great flavors."
""
"Overall: well-rounded flavours, a sweet and bitter hop with good malt backing. Add a reasonable price and that this is different to your normal grain lager; definitely one of the better lagers I have had to date."

"nice brew from clown shoes. not sure why they are getting a bad rap out here in colorado, all of their stuff has been solid. red lager hopped aggressively. caramel color more amber than red, with over an inch of lacy white head, looks great. the nose is all lemon hops, citra probably, and maybe something for bitterness, because this is very bitter. the taste is malt first hops second, with a distinct lemon character all the way through. one of the first reds where hop bitterness trumps sweet malt and i really like it. soapy sudsy feel, really big for a lager, but it drinks clean in the finish. i think this is a great illustration of a well flavored and not boring lager. the hopping is done very well, and the mouthfeel is big for the style. these guys deserve some credit for making some really neat beer."

"O: I've relearned the importance of looking for bottle dates very carefully before purchasing anything hoppy. The dry-hopping with Simcoe and Citra just wasn't there for me."
""
""

"I've had this a few times now, good stuff. Nice hops but the sweetness of it detracts a little."
"Pours into a becker a clear deep bronze with a large blooming head that leaces two full rings of broken lace as it settles oh so slowly into a frothy mass.The Simcoe hops stand out in the nose along with caramel malts and mild toast,like a hopped up Vienna lager to me.Dryer on the palate with toasted grain,earthiness,and leafy hop goodness,a little more oomph from the leafy hops and it would bump up my score.A damn fine amber lager,a healthy dose of hops, and on the dryer side."

"O - 3.5 - It's not that great. Little bit of a dirty/earthy taste."
""
""
"Overall: A quite solid beer from Clown Shoes that I would drink again. This bottle wasn't extremely fresh so I'd love to get my hands on something fresher."
""
"Overall quite a good deal mixed and matched for $2.50 and I found it quite worth it. A great tasting hoppy red ale despite if its a few weeks or months old."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good hoppy representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time."
"O: This would make a great everyday drinker. Great beer to pair with any meal, not too overwhelming, but interesting and tasty. I suspect fresh it would be way hoppier, I'll try it next year."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the hop profile in this one is quite earthy."
""
"OVERALL: A very hoppy, citrusy amber ale. Quite tasty and worth revisiting."
""

"Could use more carbonation."

"It's hard enough to find a variety of red lagers, and even harder to find one which stands out. Clown Shoes nailed this one. Too bad it's brewed as a summer beer, because honesty I could see this working during the winter season too."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, bright, amber coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a thin, sparse, off-white surface coat of head. Aromas of tangy sweet caramel, resiny and piney hops, grapefruit and mango sweet, and a subtle roasting. Flavors are roast and rich caramel sweet forward, with a very quick hops bitterness to follow. Tropical fruit notes combine with the piney notes to balance the rich, sweet backbone. Light, effervesced body keeps this beer very drinkable, with a tangy, tropical sweet aftertaste. Clean, effervescent finish with a subtle drying. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied and a bit more complex than expected. Thankfully, the hop presence is stronger and more interesting than the aroma hinted toward. Some dank,sticky bitterness with resinous oils, pine needle and grass followed by a subtle summit/onion presence before the malt backbone comes in. Sweet caramel flavor along with toffee, hazelnut, some dark fruit, biscuit and graham cracker. Well balanced, flavorful and decently drinkable. Nothing too exciting going on her but it's a interesting take on the style."

"I didn't really like this one. It seems rushed or not thought out."
"Good name and pours a dirty orange amber hue with a two finger head packed full of little bubbles and lacing as far as the eye can see,woah the smell is defjbately different almost smells infected like a weird mix of blood orange,chicken pieces,stone fruit and jelly definitely unique and obviously that's the smell as on taste it's not infected it starts off with orange marmalade,plum jam,some roasty malts that give a nice medium body and finished with a citrus piney smooth bitterness and overall yeah easy to drink but nothing to make me come back cheers."
"Good, but not quite true to style."
"Trying this one fresh results in a much brighter and citrus prevalent brew. Swagger is a solid lager with some earthy depth and punchy hops to go with the balanced malt backbone. Would strut with this one again."

"O- loads of flavor could drink the whole 4-pk again its dank and full bodied but also creamy delicious"

"Pretty good citra-centric brew. Nothing short of a ""hoppy red ale."""

"Super-clean and delicious. This is a downright stellar Red Lager. This deserves to be at the top of its class. Thank you, Clown Shoes!"

"The session police say that 6% abv is not a session beer, but a few pitchers of this with friends would be very welcome. A good everyday beer."

"Overall pretty nice hoppy red ale, good malts and nice bitterness balance, nice hop character, fairly tasty, good body, overall pretty nice beer. I was worried this would get too hoppy, too bitter, or too much sweet candy malt character since it's Clown Shoes, but this was pretty nice."
""
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Foamy head, and some persistent lacing. Wood, spice, and buttery goodness. Roasted malt, with a really woody tone and hints of spice and a nice does of grapefruit. Earthy and hoppy. Well-balanced combination. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"The finish is bitter, and gets increasingly sharp and drying as a few moments go by after swallowing. This definitely leads me to crave another sip right away. As usual with Clown Shoes beer, the glass is almost empty by the time my review is coming to a close. It feels rather full-bodied for a beer only 6% ABV, and it also fully coats the mouth, as I would prefer. Overall an American Amber Lager is is a vague style, and may not conjure the most excitement when compared to others. Thankfully Clown Shoes took a little bit of an experimental approach that yielded a very flavorful, yet easily drinkable beverage. If you're bored of the average lager, definitely give this one a try - especially if you're an IPA fan, as it bares some resemblance to East coast IPAs and to things like Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe IPA. You've gotta love that name, too!"
