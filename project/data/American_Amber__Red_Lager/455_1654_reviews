"o: a tasty amber lager with an aroma that could use some work.  i would happily have a few of these in one sitting"
""
""
"O: good, bot nothing to seek out;"
""
"Discovered creemore on tap at Dooly's in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada ( my hometown) and loved it. Began trying all their products I could get my hands on. I'm by no means an expert, I'm still experimenting with different beers, but creemore products - especially the lager and bock-  are definitely my favorite as of yet"

""
""
"So overall would I recommend it ? Im general a Big YES. As a Lager this is one of the best. It goes down very easily, a little bit on the watery after taste, but overall there is nothing to complain expect that the price is a bit hight compare to a Moosehead but way much better taste than the competition."
""
"Pours a copper like amber color with a creamy two finger head. Creemore Springs has  hints of hops and sweet caramel that is a pleasant tasting beer, and remains a top notch beer to enjoy time and time again. For me, this is one of the most flavorful beers from Ontario, and it's among my favorite beers."

"Pretty darn good- creamy-toasted malt and hops are well balanced."

"O: Good beer and could be easy to drink a few of. Reminds me of sam adams or anchor steam. nice surprise."

"Overall: 4.25/5. One of my preferred beers. I've only encountered them in tall cans, and that's fine with me. Will gladly drink this beer if given the option!"

"Sampled on tap at an Irish pub in Calgary. This brew arrived in a pint glass, a really nice russet bronze color, veering towards red, fizzy and with billowing white foam that retained its form quite well. Aroma all ""grape and grain", some nice floral aromatics, sweet malts, hints of toast and sour fruit. Palate amazingly complex and well-rounded, with malts and hops synching up near-perfectly, with neither component running the show nor hiding in the shadows. Mellow biscuit and caramel malts backstop a tobacco and iris perfume, melon rind (German hops!), rhubarb, baby aspirin, a little red berry and a healthy dose of bitter citrus pith to fuel a crisp dry finish. Grainy and toasty but manages to retain some sweet and tangy complexity as well. Difficult to find flaws in this well-crafted brew and this could be a top amber/red lager choice for me in the future. Are we sure this is brewed in Ontario??? I kid, I kid. Creemore is a top-tier lager brewery and this is their flagship for a reason. Was good enough to distract me from the fights."

"A pretty good beer, makes me think it's what amber bock would taste like if AB tried to make good beers."

"It was always my top classed beer, without doubt."
""
""
""
"I like to drink it with burgers done on the BBQ."
""
""
" slightly burnt)! I rename this beer ""Morecheese Please""."
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent lager that is often the best option on tap as well when dining out in Southern Ontario."
""

"Little to no head. Very light color (straw) and clear. The smell is mild but well-balanced. The flavor is basically of the palest malt and a bit of raw grain. The finish was a nice peppy hop. The aforementioned body was very thin and the extremely high carbonation didn't help."
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation, yet a satisfying crisp finish. Medium body, nothing to exciting."

"This was one complex brew. When it got brought to the table I was a little worried about it doesn't have a clear appearance that I was expecting out of a traditional Canadian Lager. Pleasantly surprised I was Creemore had a great spice note without overwhelming the sweetness of the beer. It had a crisp clean finish that didn't hang in my mouth. Great drink."
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, slight hop, hint of grass, and corn/rice. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. The beer would also seem to fit nicely into the Light Lager category. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of corn/rice, slight pale malt, and slight hops. Overall, weak appearance, body, and blend."
""
""
""
"Overall- An easy drinking lager by Creemore Springs. I was a little off put by the aromas but the taste certainly made up for the aroma. Besides that drawback, a lager that is better than some on the Canadian market."
""
"I'm not a huge Amber/Red Lager fan, so it's hard for me to give this beer an unbiased review. That being said, I'd say it was just below average for it's style. It was average in appearance and mouthfeel, but totally ""musty"" in taste. That's the most notable quality about this beer that I can mention. I had a couple, but it's not one that I'd buy again."
"This is a cut above most Canadian lagers both in complexity and hops used. Not as grassy smelly as a Pils but not boringly sweet like most Canadian lagers. The colour is darker than the majority of beers in the style and the finish is dry with a long mouthfeel. Could drink this one all day."
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow lager notes, but nothing more than average. In the taste, a small caramel like roast in an average lager. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry caramel and small hop notes in the aftertaste. Not bad, but nothing more than average."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I like it. A lot. If I could only ever have one beer to drink forever, I'd have to consider this one. It's good from a flavour and a refreshing perspective. I do think I'd probably end up with some form of a bitter ale as a single beer if push came to shove, but I'd have to at least think about this one, too."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice level of bitterness for a lager, the biggest drawback of this beer for me is the smell, which affects the drinkability to a certain extent."
"Definitely drinkable without being inspiring or memorable."
""
""
"O: nothing really memorable. A nice beer but certainly forgettable."
""
"Wow, this beer breaks all of the rules. It pours a beautiful deep golden/red with a slightly off white thick head (which did not lace). The aroma is slightly malty with a mild slightly grassy aroma mixed with malt. This is a big beer with body and mouthfeel but with no aftertaste. It's flavorful but very clean and drinkable. I have yet to find a been in this category which is so well balanced. Nothing stands out, it just all melds perfectly together."
"Overall nice, maltier than most base lagers but then again this is a premium I guess. Nice malts, herbal hops actually blend in well, and the lager flavors come through nicely despite the bigger malt profile and herbal hops, but still quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and refreshing, a totally sessionable beer and one I might get on my next visit up here to the great white north. Very well balanced with a light but enjoyable flavor."
""

"I brought a 473ml can back from Canada. The beer poured a clear amber/orange with white head and some lacing. The smell has subtle hops, with slight tangerine like citrus as well as malt. Taste had sweet malt, like caramel, some hops are present that give it a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall it is a good beer."
""
"This is one delicious beer that I plan on going back to again and again."
"Pours an amberish orangish yellow with a nice head on it. The nose is some grainy malts. Grainy malts show up and dominate everything on the pallet as well. A subtle kick of spicy hops on the finish. This is a pretty solid lager. Nothing too crazy or over the top with some subtle complexities, however delicious and above average for the style. Recommended if you're ever in Canada!"

"This is a good lager that I enjoy allot when served cold in a glass, To do this beer justice I recommend not drinking from the can"
""
""

" Tastewise it's pretty interesting. It starts off with a bit of a creamy sweetness from the malts, followed by a little bit of hop and then finishes clean. It's light and refreshing but also full bodied and well rounded all the way through."
"On tap at ethel's lounge, poured a two finger head into a pint glass, white frothy head with good retention, amber copper colour, nice lacing. Smell is malt, caramel,grass, hint of citrus. Taste follows the nose and is very well balanced. Little bitter on the back end with some carbonation. Medium body and dry. Definitely one of my favourite lagers."
"473 ml can. No freshness date. Nice touch of malt sweetness, mild bitterness. No unpleasant or off-flavors whatsoever. Really an extremely drinkable lager, quite delicious, not as amber in color as I would have expected but Canada craft brewing seems to be continuing to step up their game. Way to go America's hat."
"O - an interesting mix of lager, pilsner, and amber qualities, but 100% easy drinking"
"Flavor as well, not outstanding. Nothing bad. More malt than hops."
"A fair Canadian brew."
"Readilyu available on tap in Ontaro. Free of preservatives, pasteurization, etc.. small town brewery, now owned by Molson but they seem to be unchanged."
"O: Again, this one was a bit above the Canadian beer that I had before, mainly due to its bitter aspects. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this beer; it tickles the taste buds in a way that is more common in ales rather than lagers. You can tell that this beer has a bit more passion and thought behind it than most of the beers you’ll find in a macro-brewery. Still, it’s in no way a HUGE achievement. It is a good change of pace, though."
"Final Grade: 4.01, an A-."
"Quite nice! Beautiful in a glass with a bright amber color. Has a moderate head and almost no scent. A very clean simple taste with a slight toasted finish. Mouth feel has a little bite, but very easy drinking. Can state no additives, preservatives, or pasteurization and it has a natural quality impression that makes me think they are telling the truth. Well done."
"O/D - A very well put together lager from Creemore. Just like every other beer they make, this is just very well done."
"Pours a nice dark amber color with have inch frothy head and moderate carbonation. Smell is very malty and nutty. This thing is packed with nutty flavor and slightly bitter. Goes down extremely smooth. This beer is frickin' awesome and wish I could get my hands on some more, but unfortunately won't be heading to Canada in the near future."
"Light bodied and refreshing, but still flavourful and complex enough to satisfy a beer lover. Since Molson bought this brewery it is often available alongside the usual Molson lineup in places that don't serve craft beer."
"Overall, this is a great lager! I'd get a 6 pack of this any time."
"O-good, a nice surprise, especially for under $2.00 for a 500ml"
"A golden yellow beer taut had no head but somehow left pretty good lacing. A little skunk aroma and not much else. The carbonation was sharp in the mouth. Tastes of honey and malts also appeared. A very light bodied beer, pretty ordinary. For having paid $9 in an airport, it was one of the more appealing choices."
"Overall: A nice flavorful lager that manages to keep it simple yet interesting."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth, easy to go down, drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great lager."
"Libation: This is one of the better macro lagers available. This is especially flavorful and refreshing despite a complex flavor. I'm glad to see the Molson buyout hasn't ruined what was and still is a great beer. When compared to other lagers of a similar price, they simply do not compare."
"Drinkability - In my opinion, another solid tasting and strong beer, very good to have in the fridge at home for friends and family!"
"Clearly no ""hop bomb", but acceptable to people of many different ale or lager tastes, and it's increased availability is a pleasnt surprise. Unfortunately I thought Molson's would destroy it on contact, but they appear to be exceding my expectations - well done!"
"but the aftertaste is dissapointing. tastes like a macro. cardboard stale corn."
"Drink - I'm happy to see this beer popping up everywhere. It is one of my favourite Ontario beers and it appears as though it is really making a name for itself. I wasn't happy with the 11$ price tag at the hockey game; but at least I wasn't limited to a Molson Canadian."
"D= very drinkable, recommended, went well with pasta dishes."
"Cheers liamt07!"
"Perhaps more expensive than some other regional beers, but is one of few that is deserving of the term ""world class"". Can be served at your backyard BBQ or fancy dinner parties."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation. A pretty good lager, extremely easy to drink. Something I would definitely grab for my fridge if it were available."
"D-Very nice lager. It has nice body and texture and very pleasant to drink."
"Price = Gratis"
"D- Very good beer. Surprised I didn't know about it. Will likely become a regular. Not too pricey"
"Pours a clean golden pale colour with nice white head. Smell has a lot of hops for the style, with sweet fruity malt too. Bitterness is there, but it won't put the macro drinkers off here. Very smooth carbonation level. Clean drinking lager that I tend to drink when sharing pitchers with friends."
"D: Very drinkable. Good for more than one any time. One of my favorite Canadian beers."
"Did anyone else realize that this is in the same style category as Brooklyn and Old Scratch? This comes off more like a macro lager, or maybe in the same ballpark as Yuengling. I feel like I'm in crazy town reading other reviews. I would definitely not recommend this, even for the style."
"Creemore is an iconic brewery in Ontario and it earned that reputation with good reason. Its flagship lager - one of the few ""premium"" lagers to actually use the word in its true sense - is flavourful, clean, distinctive and pleasurably drinkable. It is a magnificent example of unpasteurized, uncompromising, small-batch beer if there ever was one."
"Pours a tawny gold with a fluffy, white head - leaves some specks of lace. Aroma is dominated by biscuity malts, and a bit grainy - a touch of musty hops in the background. Taste is pretty impressive... a doughy / biscuit maltiness with a well balanced, light hop bitterness - very surprised with this one. Mouthfeel is a hint above light, and it finishes a touch dry. Very drinkable brew - I'd gladly have it again!"
"d - very delicious ""summer"" beer, can easily have a few pitchers of this"
"Pours a crisp, clear golden 'lager' colour with a wonderful white head that caps about 1/2 cm tall with lacing as you drink. Aromas of spicy hops above a bready malt. The beer itself is an enjoyable bready malt with a light bitterness and a crisp finish. Nice carbonation and an enjoyably drinkable beer to cap a 2200 km car ride to Ottawa!"
"d-Like I said it's a fridge staple."
"I'm happy to see this on tap in a few bars in Calgary, a much better beer compared most of the macros (even though it's owned by Molson)"
"Just a stand up brew; my default draught choice. If you're looking for a solid Canadian red, look no further!"
"Overall I really like this Lager. Creemore produces a delicious beer which is perfect for when you're lounging on a sunny afternoon or vegging on the couch. The mellow flavour makes this beer very drinkable..."
"It's great to see that despite being owned by a macro this brewery were allowed to stick to their guns. A great local lager and, thanks to Molsons, wildly available in mainstream bars making it one of my go to bar drafts."
"Overall, a nice, enjoyable, light amber lager with some nicely layered flavors. An enjoyable interpretation of the style."
"Not a bad beer, though I'm certainly a long way away from the days when I thought this was the best beer I had ever tried. This beer is obviously meant to be drinkable, and it is. I pretty much only buy this beer when Tankhouse isn't available (Tankhouse and Creemore being the two drinkable beers you'll find either of at any given drinking establishment in Toronto) but am glad to have it to fall back on...since there's not much else to count on here in Ontario."
"Clear amber/orange with a ring of white head and spots of lace. Smell is light fruity hops, citrus, strong tangerine aroma, bready malts, fresh yeast as well. Taste is toasted biscuit, caramel, grassy and herbal hops, mildly citric, with a big punch of whole wheat cracker in the aftertaste, like Triscuits without the salt. It's hard to describe, but there's an 'off' emptiness in the flavour that takes this beer down a notch from Brooklyn Lager (the natural comparison). Mouthfeel is delicate and silky, medium carbonation, balanced malt/hop finish. Good session beer, more complex than your average lager. Respected by craft drinkers, accessible to macro lovers. A Canadian classic."
"D: It would be extremely easy to put back several of these babies. This is a lager with a lot of flavor, and a lot of character. Easily one of the better lagers I've had."
"Damn tasty and evenly balanced, hard to even began to describe the taste excepts that it's smooth and creamy, it's one of a kind.It's medium bodied and lightly carbonated.An exceptional beer all around that's a pleasure to drink.Would love to try this on Tap."
"On tap. Pours a clear amber. Pretty fucking bland to be honest. I was pretty disappointed with this beer. Considering the overall rating it has locally. Definately overrated. After taste was annoying, and after two pints I actually quit drinking that night. Pretty disappointing."
"Mouthfeel - smooth and lightly creamy. The diacetyl provides some slickness into the finish. A nice medium level of carbonation."
"This is an outstanding beer. Always try to ger my hands on some when i'm up north. A must try!In my opionion its just a great, simple straight forward,good tasting brew! Wish it was more available to us here in the states.But it definetly makes a trip to the falls well worth the time."
"D: Outstandingly drinkable. Even more so on tap."
"This is ""Nectar of the Gods"" status for this style. truly world class, and brewed in my neck of the woods which is bonus for me!"
"This beer is a must-try for any lover of the Pale Lager style. Full of flavor and it's slightly high price is worth every penny."
"D - Flavourful and easy to drink. Has become one of the staples in my fridge."
"OVERALL: A great pale lager beer; one of the best in Canadian beer stores. Light and refreshing, perfect for a warm summer day, coupled with an exceptional taste profile for the style. Very enjoyable and drinkable, this is one I'll keep around during the warmer months of the year. Recommended."
"Clear copper with a small creamy light tan head that leaves a few scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is toasted grain and caramel with a touch of grassy hops. Pretty tasty, kind of the ""Boston Lager"" of Canada, nice and clean with biscuity malt and herbal hop notes. Medium light bodied and mildly carbonated. Easily the best non Unibroue Canadian beer I've had. A good lager."
"Sample- 500 Ml bottle- Dark amber coloured body, very nice! Aromas of some malt, and hops in the background. I also got a whiff of fruit(?). Taste is hoppy, fresh, and a tad sweet of malts. A very distinctive taste in my opinion. It went down very easily."
"Fuller bodied than your typical macro lager. Carbonation just shy of moderate lightens it up a little. Clean, simple, and very easy to drink. A solid lager."
"Creemore Springs pours a light copper, a bit darker than your average macro lager. The aroma is slightly grainy with a hint of caramel sweetness and slightly herbal hops. The flavor shows a similar profile, just a bit of malt sweetness and a nice but mild hop flavor. Overall the beer is nice and refreshing after a run and a swim."
"This is a great session beer - the best widely available Ontario beer."
"Drinkability - very easy to drink many of these. Cold and refreshing, natural flavours, goes down easy."
"Active carbonation, about par for the style. Definitely drinkable but still just too light and with too many vague flavors for me to pick it up unless it's the only choice."
"Definitely sessionable. Drinks very lightly, is quite clean, and finishes off as such. Great beer at Graffiti's to catch a show there."
"Had on tap at the Loose Moose in Toronto"
"Definitely recommended. I'd enjoy this most in spring and fall, and on summer evenings after the heat of the day, or quite easily in winter after hockey, too."
"You know you're about to have a good lager as soon as you see it. Pours a clear, shiny copper color with some good lacework on the glass. Slightly grassy aroma. The flavor is fresh, toasty, with a crisp bitterness. Nothing very fancy, and pleasure is in the simplicity. Very enjoyable to drink, and paired well with Asian Chicken Salad I had. Really intensified the flavors of the dressing. Proof that great beer can come in a lager."
"A well-balanced, easy-drinking, enjoyable lager!"
"Here's a well put together lager. Seems like it couldn't have suffered much from being bought out by Molson."
"Overall, an excellent American pale lager. Smooth, creamy, well balanced and not lacking in flavour. Decently priced here in Ontario, I could definately see this beer being one of my summer saviors."
"Good auroma and even better flavors. I was fairly suprised by this beer, not amazing but I would definitely get it again if I can find it."
"Final Thoughts - This is a good and solid beer. I wouldn't call it exceptional by any means but I'd be happy to drink this stuff at a restaurant any day, or if I just wanted a single beer. I wouldn't buy a case of it (especially since it needs to be drunk quick due to the lack of preservatives and pasteurization) but I would love getting this stuff on tap."
"D- Good session beer! I would say this is one of the best lagers I've had and would recommend this to anyone wanting something with some substance. I'd say this would be a good beer for an evening with company!"
"Carbonated mouthfeel, this beer fills you up fast on tap though, other than that, a very good lager."
"Notes from: 7/29/05"
"A generally agreeable, somewhat robust, and overall tasty lager. I get a weird sense of wholeness with this one, something even beyond the obvious eschewing of adjuncts - there's still pride here, the kind that stubbornly persists after a family member does something unpleasant or just plain silly."
"Eric"
"D: Very drinkable."
"Better mouthfeel and more of a soft carbonation on tap than the bottle version. The flavours compliment seemed more pronounced when the beer began to warm. Happy to have ordered it."
"highly recomended and try to find as fresh as possible."
"Drinkability: A sigh of relief that there's going to be a beer I can have here at the airport (travel here about once a week). Very smooth, refreshing, and a quite tasty lager here."
"Had this at ""The Keg"" in Ottawa, ON and at the Ottawa Int'l airport. A solid lager, seemed more like a Pilsner. Nice mouthfeel and very crisp and refreshing, no noticeable hops though. Had on tap at The Keg and the bottle version was actually much better."
"Re-review: After trying this again I think I was unfair the first time around. This is a very nice lager with some flavourful caramel malt and a nice crisp hop finish."
"Delivers the style quite well. I could enjoy 2-3 of thes on a warm day...."
"Very well balanced with both the malt and hops reaching high compares to most North American lagers. This would be my mainstay or fallback beer if it was readily available to me, seek this one out."
"I was expecting something much worse than this after I drain-poured their Traditional Pilsner. Given that you can find Creemore at a lot of mainstream bars this wouldn't be a bad choice."
"A very good tasting beer. Very satisfying. A good lager to enjoy a sandwich with or your favorite pasta with a cream sauce."
"Pint at Madison's during a lightning visit by an Australian friend. Amber body with a slightly off-white head, that slowly diminishes to a film. Light bready aroma. Mild caramel malt flavour, and the slightest hint of hops. Lager is not my style, but this one is pretty decent, and would help change my mind."
"This is a drinkable ""malty"" lager. There are maltier lagers or ales, but this is alright."
"D- Quite easy to drink. Better than the Heineken or Rickard's also on tap at the bar. A good ""basic"" beer when wanting some flavour but no big surprises."
"I tried this beer on August 24, 2007 at Kelsey's in Milton. The beer was a beautiful coppery colour with a one finger head. The aroma was very faint to non-existant. Disappointing to say the least. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour was mild, a little malty and a little bitter. I may try this beer again."
"I'm not a fan of Lagers, so I was hesitant to try this. But once I tried it, I liked it. The appearance is nice -- a clear pinkish-orange and with a thin, frothy foam head. The taste doesn't overwhelm the palate. It's difficult to describe the taste in detail, other than to say it was crisp and clean. This beer is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability- Smooth and easy to drink and can really compliment a hearty to medium meal."
"Now it seems to be a blend of the original Creemore and Molson Canadian, actually more like a Molson Canadian with a hint of Creemore in it. This is typical of how a large mass-producing giant takes on a smaller craft beer and streamlines the recipe and process to maximize profits. Just my 2 cents."
"Poured out a copper orange color with a bubbly off white head, thick, then faded to a thin film in under a minute. The nose, ummm.... let's see. I guess, something, right? Maybe some faint malt. I could be lieing though. Now, on to the taste. Ok, some toasty malt, not much, and it dissapears quickly, but it was there. Has a slight bitter hoppy finish as well. Light bodies with medium carbonation. Very clean finish. Nothing great here, but nothing offensive."
"Sweet malt flavors with hints of caramel. Toasted grains are a bit lighter than in the nose. Buttery. Floral hop presence, but this one is all malt here. Carbonation is a bit too high and sucked the wind out of the flavors. medium bodied with a toasted grain aftertaste. A nice lager from our friends from the north."
"Overall i love drinking this beer with a nice pot roast or something, it pairs excellently with lots of types of food ( salmon worked really well ). Great, all natural, probably one of the best lager beers in Canada."
"Had on-tap in Windsor. It's clear brown/red with a small foam head that fades quickly. Decent amount of bubbles. Nose is grains and corn, not the best but it smells like a lager. Taste is similar to the nose, a musty grain/corn blend with slight hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is average or just below. Same for drinkability. Not a bad beer, it's just bland."
"Very nice, sweet and drinkable, good thick and white great foam. NICe colour between gold and sunny. The taste is not tiring, reminds me a little the Polish lagers but it has its own Canadian character. I like this kind of lagers, they do not taste like crap."
"One heck of a session beer, if nothing else. With so many mediocre beers calling themselves all malt these days, it's nice to see what a real example of the style can be like. It's also nice to see craft beer in cans!"
"Taste is just plain awkward. I think I know what they're trying to do with this one, and the hop presence scores it some points, but the malt is nearly non-existent, unless that sour adjuncty soapiness is supposed to be it. Mouth is sticky with a zippy carbonation, dry. This is drinkable and more unique than a lot of lagers out there, but in my opinion it's pretty poorly executed. Unfortunate."
">>This is sad because I liked this beer and have bought it for years but there are now several better premium micro lagers with richer import malts and fresher taste these days."
"A rather nice All-Malt Lager. Pours out to a deep orange gold color with a lively head of white foam that stays consistantly dense and large. Rings of lace are present. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of rich roasted caramel malts and wheaty grains mixed with a touch of wood. Nice. Taste is well rounded and very enjoyable; caramel malts, light wood notes, smooth rich grain, a touch of earth, the slightest nip of hops. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but not overly carbonated (almost not enough carbonation, honestly). Drinkability is north of average. A well made lager. Recommended."
"Overall an acceptable beer but nothing to go out of the way for."
"D - Quite good. Easy drinking session beer. Much, much better fresh on tap."
"Taste is quite pleasant, and I always like the mouthfeel of this beer -- smoother and creamier than commercial lagers, and one of the best of the region. Quite malty, but well-balanced like I said. A short-lasting but satisfyingly bitter aftertaste. A little bit of a cracker flavour, and maybe a little bit of red grape flavour in the very very back."
"Creemore claims to be ""proudly behind the times," and in this, I salute them."
"Delightfuly wonderful, Looks nice, smells nice, tastes great, nice and smooth and extremely drinkable. I can't believe i've overlooked this beer so many times in the past. By far my favorite example of this style. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
"Bright orange in color and hazy in appearance, the body is topped by a small white head that quickly fades. A mild and lighlty sweet maltiness, some nut perhaps and a gentle bitterness and maybe a touch of tart citrus in the finish. Nutty and fruity in the nose. Light-medium in body, lightly carbonated and is one smooth and easy drinking beer on the palate. Not too bad, but inconsistent, from place to place, this beer may be sensitive to age or batch type?"
"A slightly above average lager. Nothing more, nothing less. Light golden with a billowy head of pure white foam. Decent lacing and retention. Aromas of husky grains, light malts, and where are the hops here buddy!? This one is definately light on the hops! Taste is malty with some nice bready notes and some husky frito-lay grain notes as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and semi-dry. Finish is corny, and adjunct flavored. If this is all malt, i'm a bit confused. Drinkability remains decent. A Canadian standard if nothing else, but to me it tastes like an American macro..."
"Purchased at the LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Pours a deep gold, almost copper color, nice head, full, carbonation is nice at a medium-low level. Beautiful lace on glass as the head disipates. Slight fruitiness in the nose, odd for a lager, still not offensive. Flavor is malt, slight, but nice for style and balanced. Body is crisp and lager like, nice beer."
"The brewery has recently been swallowed up by Molson as, I suspect, a microbrewery showcase. I hope the guys in the suits leave well enough alone and not make any undue changes."
"Pours a beautiful clear amber, nice big white head caps it off with generous lacing. Smell is of sweet malts, dark candy perhaps, a little metallic. Taste is a little sweet, malty, bitterness in the finish, a little spicy as well. Very smooth beer, not as carbonated as most lagers so it goes down easily. One of the best beers made in Ontario, if not Canada, very good lager and takes away the bite of a hot summer day."
"Poured a copper golden color, thin white head that left little lace on the glass. It had a crisp and clean aroma, wet grass with some hops on top. Strong, full flavour with some malt sweetness (almost honey-like), well balanced with floral/hop bitterness. Clean, dry finish. Smooth and easy to drink."
"It's a good session beer and I've been finding that it's a good intermediate step for weaning friends away from Coor's and Bud and onto real beers."
"A really nicely done lager - one of the freshest-tasting bottled beers I've run across. Good balance of hops with a touch of honey in the malt. Had a nice, homey quality that reminded me of the best homebrewed lagers I've had - no scrimping on the production. A standout in a category in which it is hard to stand out."
"For all the ""cool"" beer being brewed in the states, no one I know of has made a simple lager this perfect."
"A solid beer. Very tasty, and truly a different lager that has many ale like qualities."
"Pours out of its 500 ml brown bottle a deep ruddy golden colour, very little carbonation, and only a splash of fizz for a head. So this is what it actually looks like! (I wouldn't know from past experience...) The aroma possesses a clean sweet and biscuity malt profile, with light floral and herbal hops. I can even pick up slight caramel as well. Well-balanced and rounded flavour, the malt and hops act in unison, mild grains and some toasted malt cheek-to-cheek with the crisp flowery hops. Very refreshing stuff. The mouthfeel is light to sip, but has a decent body when rolled across the palate. If I lived in Ontario this stuff would be my old reliable, there would always be at least one bottle of this stuff in my fridge. I used to look back fondly about this stuff, and it is good to know that it's still the great beer I remember it as. My favorite Canadian lager along with Yukon Brewing's Chilkoot."
"Poured an interesting (and unexpected) clear copper in color. Head was thick and long-lasting. Nice patchwork of lace on the glass. Nose is also interesting. Mix of juicy fruit, floral hops, and a touch of malty sweetness. Flavor is up-front sweet and is mixed nicely by hoppy influence. Finish is dry. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. I was quite pleasantly surprised at this, given my recent run-ins with the Molson offerings that I'd tried whilst in Canada. Great summer beer. I'd gladly drink more of this."
"Poured a coppery gold with a very thin, almost white head that left little lace on the glass. It had a crisp aroma, with noble hops shining through. Slightly sharp flavour with some malt sweetness followed by a floral/spicy bitterness. Definitely a full bodied lager with a clean, dry finish. Fairly high carbonation with average smoothness."
"inoffensive, though..."
"Nice coloured beer, but next to no head. Kinda sad to see. Some lace does cling to the glass. Clean, good, quality lager smell. The simple beer smell, without the cheap beer smell. Slight hop aroma, some grass, and bready, almost chewy malt. Taste is similar, with a slightly stronger floral sensation. Crisp, clean mouthfeel that is very suitable for this beer. Light bodied and simple. Drinkable, yeah. It's got enough taste to be drinkable, without the complexity to make it amazing. This is a simple beer. And that is what I like. More importantly, that is what I respect about this beer."
"so the review- the color of this beer is exceptional, wonderful amber bronze color a clarity and wispy full white head that speaks of good clear canadian water. Even in a bottle a bit aged, the head stands up well. Aroma strongly of fresh-baked bread with a hint of alchohol. this fresh-baked bread taste permeates the drinkability. Straightforward, strong flavor of malt, flavor starts clear and strong and finshes with a full mouthfeel with a hint of sweetness. the fresh falvor asserts itself but fades gradually through the sip(or gulp), leaving a a clean sensation at the finish. Pure, unadulturated Canadian quality in a glass. highly recommended for all levels of beer drinking appreciation. worth hunting for if you can find some, best recommendation is to visit T.O. Ontario. either way its win-win for me, as your loss is my gain and my pleasure again and again. This is truly a sublime beer."
"The color is orange reddish, there are medium and large carbonation bubbles and lots of them. An intricate lacework clings to the glass. Aromas of floral hops, bready malts, hop bitterness and fruity yeast are quite evident. The taste is crisp and very pleasant. The mouthfeel is definitely smooth and crisp like a lager but there are definite ale characteristics to this beer. perhaps the hops used, or more likely the yeast stain. This is possibly the best lager Ive tried yet."
"My favourite of all beers up to now, as it impresses me in every way a beer possibly could. Rich colour, a great flavourful taste, and the spring water definitely gives it an unusually CLEAN taste. Highly recommended to the novice beer enthusiasts (like myself) and the experts as well."
"An A grade beer for anytime, anywhere. I love this beer."
"Superior than in the bottle, had served right (not-too-cold ) at safari Club. More balanced, malty without being as sweet and as creamy and as carbonated. Good by itself, or before food or with the meal. Cane sugar stays with the Belgiums and mint with other Onatrio challengers."
"Overall Comments: This is a pretty decent pilsener. I am not usually a fan of this style, but this was pretty well done."
"This is a highly drinkable beer!"
"I've been encourged by recent efforts from Canada. Brilliant, stylish entries such as this one and Mill St. Organic Lager, not to mention fresh Walkerville, contrasts with the cookie-cutter aspects of the scene in the USA."
"As for some of the comments about this being pricey... well quality must be paid!"
"What a nice, malty, fresh, balanced lager. This is one of my favorite light Ontario beers: quite malty in the middle, quite hoppy in the finish. Yum."
"A very crisp brew with a perfect level of carbonation. It smoothes out and has great drinkable qualities. Sweet malts dominate, and they are balanced with some grassy hops. A great summer lager."
"Thx"
"Defeintely better the second time around."
"This is an interesting beer, very full and dark amber in colour. Well balanced leaning slightly towards the hops with a lingering after taste. Est 1987, when this beer gets some seniority, it may be a classic."
"Pours a nice clear amber color, the head abundant, the lace lavish, and both beige in color. Nose has a nice hop floral tone, with malts and a touch of fruit. Start is malt sweet, the top is moderate in mouth feel, and the finish is mildly acidic, nice hop spicy bite, the aftertaste droughty and long lasting. A quite pleasant beer, and the fact that lager/pils leave me wanting, this was a pleasant surprise."

"Good copper coloring, and nice lace left around the edge of the glass.  Nice nutty / buttery taste, with a distinct yeast aftertaste.  Not bad for a Canadian lager."
