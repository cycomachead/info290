"just average......tastes mass produced"
""
"Not the best finish, but good taste."
"Every time I have another bottle of this I like it more.  It's more like Rahr Texas Bread."
""
"Poured clear copper bronze with little head, smelled of sweet bready malts and grains, tastes bready and malty with a nice finish of bitterness, thin mouthfeel."

"I'm surprised of all the low reviews.  Great beer for a hot day.  Very clean going down.  Near refreshing in fact.  Suttle hops with a crisp finish."

"Has the right idea, this is a remarkable red for a Texas brew. I am actually proud this brew is from Texad,after tasting over 6 fine red ales in the PNW I am proud to be a Native Texan, sure hope there is more to come in Texas. These guys are obviously learning and they will soon master the craft."
"I found this one to be pretty typical of what I think of when I see something that's labeled ""red."" Nicely colored quite reddish, with a good head and lace. Aroma and flavor are pretty malty with a nice hops bite and a slightly lingering bitterness from the hops. Medium bodied and smoothly carbonated. Overall I see no reason why I wouldn't buy it again when I'm in the mood for a red. This brewery hasn't disappointed me so far."

"O-this beer had a combination of grain, yeast, roasted, hops and malt smells and taste that make this a beer to try again"

"O: lots of taste and lots of malt. the full sweetness it promises never fully shows up -- that huge malty nose isn't fully mimicked in the taste. BUT it's good ... definitely better than average, and good enough that I'll be investigating this one further. i love malty English pale and brown ales, and honestly, this has a lot of those same notes (for a bit cheaper price). who says lagers can't stand toe-to-toe with ales?"

"Draught: This one pours a fairly clear reddish-amber color. There was a bit of an off white head on it. It left a little lacing. The aroma isn’t too bad. Pretty typical malts with some grassy notes, a decent enough lager aroma. The taste is also good, nothing really special, just good and easy to drink. Malts, some bitterness and biscuit notes. Pretty smooth. Easy to drink."
""
"Malty, toasted, caramel, a little sweetness. Hop bitterness is moderate, mainly earthy-leafy, a little spicy. Finish is semi dry. Body is medium, well carbonated, smooth, dry, a little crisp."

"Summary - Nice. I like a lager every now and then and Rahr's is a pretty good one. It's not outstanding, but enjoyable, and it goes nice with some chili or maybe a burger."
"Good, slightly thick, mouthfeel makes this beer very drinkable and enjoyable. I'm not much of a lager fan and prefer ales, but this has a flavor complexity and solid maltiness that may change my mind."

"I recommend giving this beer a try. It is nothing exceptional, and I do not see myself rushing to the store to buy another six pack. It is a solid all round lagerthat is easy to drink, and the color is really something worth mentioning. I gave it a 4.5 because it looks fantastic to me."

"Very nice red lager. Color is absolutely perfect and out of the bottle had a surprisingly good head on it. Very creamy and malty beer. I'd say its very drinkable, with slight hop notes, but has an over all smooth taste. A little caramel flavor on the back end."

"The beer pours an amber copper color with a bubbly tan head that quickly faded. Smells of nutty malt, dried fruit, caramel and its a bit vegetal. The taste is mostly bready malt flavors with some caramel, toasted nuts and earthy/ lemon hops. The beer is medium bodied with more carbonation than it should have and a very dry finish. This is an excellent amber/ red, I think I would choose this over most other ambers."
"Was in the Dallas airport so I bellied up to the bar and ask the server, give your best Texas hand crafted brew. She gave me this beer in a pint glass and there was no head and had a reddish copper color. I would compare this beer to a Killigans. Had notes of rye and malt. Very light and easy to drink. Wish Texas has better beer."
"O: Good session beer to support my local brewery with. Nothing special, but nothing wrong with it, either. I tend to prefer limited and seasonal brews from Rahr's. Good gateway for BMC light lager drinkers."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, I picked this up from Central Market in Fort Worth while we were staying with a friend. The beer pours a dark amber-red with a thin, white, foamy head. There was a light aroma of semi-sweet caramel, but very subtle. Flavors are dark toasted malt initially, with some subtle hopping at the end. Smooth, but watery, especially on the finish. The aftertaste is sweet and slightly balanced with hops. This is an average red, and would make a decent go-to for guests that may not be fans of craft in general to start them on the road of transition."
"D - This beer is clean and refreshing and will definately be having several of these with no problem."
"Pours a clear dark reddish amber, with a thin tan head. Smells strongly of biscuit malt, and a hint of vinegar. Taste up front is major biscuit (victory) malt, thin malty middle, and an extremely tart finish. A hint of earthy hops in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was nice, and smooth, however, with medium carbonation levels. Drinkability was below average, this beer just wasn't too appealing to me. IMO they used WAAAY too much victory malt, and the beer got more tart the more I drank."
"mouthfeel/drinkability: felt surprisingly smooth even though i felt it lacked in taste"
"D: I couldn't have more than one of these unless it was the only beer left at the brewery."
"Came out brownish red with a decent tan head. The aromas were of all malt, some caramel, no hop aromas here. The flavor was also dominated by malts, a little bit toasted malt and a little bit caramel sweet. Not a bad flavor, just sort of one sided and somewhat normal like a Killians, but I admit that it is definitely better than Killians. I have only had a few other red style lagers, but I would say this is the best of the bunch that I have tried."
"Overall a great Amber beer from my local Fort Worth brewery. I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it."
"Not a bad beer, but I wish that my local brewery put out a better product."
"Drinkability isn't bad, I didn't care for the smell at all, but the taste was fine...but not so much that I opted for a whole pint! Nevertheless, if I was served this at a keg party or something, I'm probably have no problem drinking a few."
"This brew pours a dark shade of red, with some signs of carbonation. A bit of foam on top, but not much. Smell is of sweet malt, a hint of roasted grains, and some light hops. The taste follows - this is definitely a malty amber brew. Hops are faint, but present, and the sweetness of the malt dominates. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Overall, this is a pretty good brew, and a great session beer. I'd recommend trying it."
"Drinkability is good as it is an easy drinking brew. Good with pizza."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a dark copper/reddish color, forming a 1/2 inch tan head, that leaves light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is very light, consisting light malts, and what smells like grain. The taste is also a bit lacking in flavor, starting with a hint of malts, and ending with a touch of hops. By no means complex. Smooth light mouthfeel. If it were'nt for the lack of flavor, this could be a very drinkable ale, but no flavor equals bad beer. Overall, this just seemed like a ""light beer."" However, I could see using this beer as a starting point for BMC drinkers wanting to expand."
"I really want to like this brewery because it's in DFW, but I'm afraid that I'm done trying thier less than stellar offerings."
"D - It's a very drinkable beer. Although the roastiness builds up."
"This beer is very easy to drink but somewhat lackluster. Very quaffable and a beer I would drink watching football with my friends so I could pay attention."
"D: This is a very good lager. From the pour and description, I expected it to taste like a Vienna Lager, something like a Sam Adams Boston Lager. However, this brew doesn't have the complex malt flavors of other darker lagers I have tried. That being said, I still really like the taste of this beer. This would be a great choice to give to the guy who thinks all ""dark beers"" taste very strong, and introduce him to the wonderful world of craft beer. I would defenitely buy it again."
"Smells of low malty sweetness  toasty caramel - low fruity floral hop. Pours orange copper  clear  low head. Tastes of warm malt  low floral hop  lightly spicy  caramel sweetness  nice little tartness  medium-low bitterness. Thin body  medium spicy carbonation  tart with just a hint of dryness. Final thoughts: Really grows on me. A smooth and refreshing, easy, nice summer beer. I would imagine Rahrs Red would session great."
"Tried this while visiting my folks in Arlington - a bit disappointing. Flavor is generic malty, nothing amazing. Little head, minimal body. My impression was that it reminded me of a Samuel Adams Boston Lager that had been watered down. The other reviews of this beer were rather more positive, perhaps I just stumbled upon a bad batch."
"A rather pedestrian beer. Maybe a decent session brew. Not really bad or good, I'd say. Brewed to compete with Shiner maybe? It's a little lighter, dryer and crisper than Shiner Bock. Maybe a decent alternative. At least it knows what it is, an Amber Lager, instead of calling itself a Bock, which Shiner really is not."
"Overall impression: meh. Very average amber lager - drinkable, but I certainly wouldn't seek this out again, and would probably take a Shiner instead if given the choice."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dates. Nice light amber color with a good head to start. The smell was on the bland side and malty without any noticeable hops. I was really hoping to like this one since it's local and wanting to support local efforts. Unfortunately, the taste followed the smell and was pretty bland. It had no hops and was weak and a somewhat watery (mouthfeel very watery as well). There are others in the style that I like so not a style issue. This one is on-par with most macros for me. Don't recommend unless to mark off list. (2.5, NA, ML, N)"
"Pours reddish brown, with a white head that recedes relatively quickly. Aroma is malts, some toasted malts. Flavor is mostly malts, some slight hops evident. Medium-light bodied. This is a great session beer, its low in alcohol, good flavor but not overpowering."
"Pours out a clear amber with a thin head that looks like frothed milk. Leaves substantial lacing. I smell a little toasted malt and some graininess. Very faint floral hops. Up front is the sweet, toasty malt with some cutting bitterness and flowery hop flavors. The aftertaste lingers on with some bready notes. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, but not overly prickly. A little on the watery side. Not Rahr's greatest, but it's all around pretty decent and a great session beer to boot."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, I enjoyed my 6-pack and would buy again when in Ft. Worth."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the amber brew. Head fades very slowly, with hearty hunks of lacing throughout. Aroma is balanced, lightly fruity. Taste has a light malt sweetness, nicely balanced by somewhat generic hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, with a clean finish, and drinkability is very good in the session type of way. A beer to have when you're having more than one, perhaps."
"This is a nice beer to have on a warm sunny day. You can knock back a few of these without a problem."
"D- Not a big beer and lighter which is fine as the style isn't big in nature. Not as much body as other Reds but it is pretty good. Very drinkable and refreshing. Session away with this one."
"Since I'm in Denton givin my bud GP a visit I figured I'd try some of the local stock. Pours a dark orange that's crystal clear.. I like it. Smell is some grain/syrupy sweetness that surely does not offend. Taste is in the same line of smellin, except with some seltzery carbonation to finish the job. This beer sits well in the mouth and stomach, and would be very drinkable with even the greasiest of entrees."
"A fair offering from Texas. Pours out to a light amber color with a small white head. Medium low carboantion, some notes of lace. Aromas of caramel malts and grassy earth. Not bad. Taste was light and slightly bland; dry malts mix with medium bodied hops. Mouthfeel is mediocre, with some smoothness about itself. Drinkability is north of average. This isn't great stuff, but it's definitly worthy of drinking. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"Well this was the loser of the bunch and I by loser I mean not as good as the others from Rahr. Nice color, amber quick disapearing white head. Smells of lager yeast and muncih malt sweetness. Taste is blandish and a little indifferent, there is some toffee kind of flavors here but not enough, still it is clean and it would do well for a session whistle wetting beer."
"I had no problems drinking this, but just not much to it at all. It's greatest value is that it would be very refreshing in the hot summer sun."
"Opinion: Well, this style of beer doesnt mean to be too big, so you cant expect it to be bold. It does cross your palate like a well intended beer, and not some ill-conceived macro-crap like Zeigenbock or the like. I really like the maltier beers, but I would actually have to say in this case that they may want to bump up the bittering just a tad as it leaves the palate very plain. The sweet balance and attenuation are all good and make it a refreshing, yet sufficiently flavorful beer. I could definitely see buying a 6-pack of this stuff to bring to a get-together when I have to drive myself home."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Sure this beer is drinkable. It is also forgettable. If I could buy this beer locally it might warrant a once a year purchase. Of the three beers Ive tried from Rahrs this is by far the least impressive. Maybe this beer is just good and the other two were just that special? Whatever the case I am happy I tried it. Thanks assurbanipaul!"
"The color is a pale shade of amber with a tall, thick head. The aroma is of mild malt strength with a touch of caramel. The taste isn't as full-flavored as expected, this seems a little watery. The smooth malt body is enhanced by a caramel flavor mixed with a mild smokiness. A touch of herbal German hop flavor rounds this beer out. Drinkability is good, but, for flavor, there are better amber lager choices out there."
"It does cause a bit of friction on the palate if too cold, the roasted, sweet flavors come out as the brew warms up and that's how I would recommend it - higher than what is currently shown on BA."
"This is a perfectly serviceable beer, more interesting than a macro and easy to enjoy without thinking too much about it. This would go nicely with barbecue, methinks."
"Well, you know, I'm pretty surprised that this scores higher than, well, the Red Tail Ale that I just had. I mean, well, yeah. I liked the Red Tail better. So, that's not much for constructive criticism, is it? Well... It's very light on the body. Hmm. Looking at the different weights on the different parts I guess I see the problem - too much weight on the appearance. Well, this one sure looks nice - a deep amber with a smallish white head. Yes, the head is quickly gone, but the lacing lasts. The taste isn't, well, bad or anything - it's just so light and airy... There's not much there to taste! No hops, very light malts, thin. I guess that's much my experience with this one - thin... Not bad, or anything, but I can't really see myself going out and buying this to have this, you know?"
"While this beer pours a beatiful clear pale amber/orange color with a soft and thick cream colored head, the smell is quite subtle. What's there smell pretty nice, but quite muted. The aroma consists of a soft grain with a slight hop presence. The taste is a smooth grainy taste with fresh cut grass notes and a small jagged edge of hop bitterness combined with the carbonation. This is a very light bodied beer that finishes slightly dry and roasty. Despite the somewhat smooth characteristic of this beer, drinkability isn't quite what I expected. Still a solid beer, but perhaps not my favorite style. Nonetheless, I hope Rahr does very well! Thanks to Aunt Beckie for bringing me this beer. Cheers!"
"I must say that I do love the Rahr bottle labelsespecially this one with the crimson background and black silhouette of a longhorn head. It sort of has a beast from Hell look to it. As for the beer, it pours a medium amber color with a thick and frothy white head that very slowly recedes into a fluffy lacevery nice. The nose possesses some light floral notes but overall is a bit subdued. The taste begins with lightly caramel malts and a mild fruitiness followed by notes of black tea and a mildly spicy hop bitterness towards the finish. Smooth and easy-drinkinga great session beer."
"Drinkability/notes: Smooth and very flavorful, an easy to drink session beer."
"Overall Impression: A bit harsh overall for a red with the malts seemingly a bit over roasted or perhaps over-sparged (a bit astringent). I had no trouble drinking this and Ill pick some more up next time I see it. My first sample from the tap seemed a bit more mellow and tasty."
"One finger of pale tan, dense, foamy, slow head. Nice again. The beer is slightly hazy and a dark red-brown. Sheets and swoops of lacing. Sugar in the nose, nuts, a little soap. Malty, nutty, sweet and fruity up front. The middle shows thick malt and fruit, dark caramel. Tangy fruity and really very bitter at the end. It's good: quite fruity and nutty with solid caramel. Moreso with temperature. This is really much better warm."
"Lets see what this brings us. The beer pours a nice clean clear amber color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slight caramel and lotso f other business that I don't like. I would guess its is hop that doesn't giveo ff the good smell, but there is definately something. The flavor is just okay. The hop is not as offensive, but it just tastes dirty with a metallic aftertaste. There is some caramel sweetness in there, but the hop hides it. The feel is rather thin and bubbly. I would like at least a medium body. This is definately not my favorite beer. The nose and flavor are just not nice, and the feel is lacking."
"12oz. Brown glass bottle. Thanks to assurbanipaul for the sample. Pours a very nice scarlet red color, that is a nice bright color when held to light. Smell is faintly grassy, somewhat carmely, and slightly nutty. Big malt flavors dominate this beer, making a nice balance between roasted malt and grassy flavors. Mouthfeel is full and robust, and drinkability is also very pleasing."
"Very strong effort here. It stands out against most lagers I can think of from American micros."
"This is a fine, fine beer particularly for the first one out of the box. It is evident that Fritz and his staff have taken great pains to get it right the first time. I look forward to trying his other offerings at the brewery and in the bottle."
"This could be a better beer and I hope one day it is."
"Medium body but balanced and does not grow tiring. A very good session beer, it definitely grows on you after a while."
