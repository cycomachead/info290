In the flavor, mild earthy hop, a bit of lemon, and crackery malt notes. Kind of like an English pale ale, but a lager, as there is a bit of toffee behind the stewed hop flavor. Just a hint of butterscotch. Bitterness is mild but with good balance. Medium bodied with a yeast slickness. Overall, decent brew, not really amber, but good.","Stinkypuss","Aug 17, 2013"

The taste is VERY good for a lager. It has a good crispness and I actually enjoy the taste, unlike many lagers I've tried. This is one I could have several of.

I've been relatively underwhelmed by this brewery, and this isn't a style I often go for- a bit bland for me- but I picked this up on a singles rack in one of my local stores, and I have to say I was fairly pleasantly surprised. Pours a nice amber with a fairly thin head that leaves some sloppy lacing. Nice bready smell with a bit of earthy bitterness and some late tropical fruit notes. Crisp and somewhat substantial at the same time in the mouth, with more of that breadiness, light sweetness, anmd fairly firm earthy hops. There is a bit of thinnessin the finish and it could use some more length, but some spicy hops at the end redeem it. Very enjoyable on a hot day, but with enough body and character to keep me somewhat interested, and the nice spicy hop bite went well with some Dubliner cheese and some wheat crackers.","Georgiabeer","Jan 24, 2011"

Taste was very slightly sweet malt with a decidedly ""Colorado"" style (thanks, N, for the use of that term--it fits) hops profile that is both recognizable and very pleasant.
