"It doesn't taste BAD, it just doesn't really taste great. A little watery for me."

"One last thing as I pour what's left in my glass down the drain...when I'm out of town I like to pick up a new beer or two that I haven't seen locally. That would be the reason for this purchase. When I returned to my home in Missouri I looked up ZiegenBock on the web. It apparently has had a very colorful life, one point I thought interesting was that it is only sold in Texas... I bought my sixer on a fishing trip in Arkansas? and must say that regardless of where it's sold...I won't be buying again."

"A friend of mine brought me back a little mix-pack from Texas. He doesn't know a lot about craft beers, but the sentiment was nice. Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a muddled, clear, light brown coloring with a thin ring of off-white film around the surface. Aromas are subtle, with a blending of roast and sugary caramel sweetness. Flavors are watery at best, with a touch of sweet on the mid-tongue and really nothing else. I mean, there's a dose of carbonation to sharpen up the nothingness. Wow, this is like carbonated water. There's really no aftertaste because there is no taste taste. Maybe a touch of caramel, but that is really reaching. Carbonated and watery in mouth. The finish is light and clean, because there really isn't anything to linger behind. Jesus, this was a stretch to get much of anything out of this one."

"Drink- Meh. At least it was free. Never again though."

"Very drinkable but not memorable. Luckily I found several other good Texas beers when I was there."
""
""
""
""
"Popping the top on this brew I get a sweet adjunct smell. Pours to a light root beer color with a beige head that fades quickly. Taste is rather bland, a sweet and sour balance that is overpowered by a soda like carbonation. Taste is consistent throughout and then the finish is clean with no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated and when the fizz goes it is rather watery. Almost more lika a soda than a beer. No thanks."
""
"The beer pours a combination of dark yellow mixed with an color. The aroma is strange. It has cooked sour vegetables with a mixture of grainy malt and generic sweetness. The flavor has a large starchy adjunct component. I am not sure what the adjunct is here, but it is definitely present in a big way. There is a dash of bitterness at then end."
""
"O: Overall there was nothing really special about this beer and it is not one I would recommend - if you want a pseudo-bock beer and are in TX, I would recommend Shiner over this."
""
""
""
"O - Would never seek this beer again. Rather drink Shiner Bock or PBR."

"O - If there's a brew out there that's made for when craft beer drinkers want to sit around in lush mode and polish off a twelve pack alone, this one's it. Usually the same price and availability as budweiser, but with a thicker feel and a much more interesting flavor."
""
"Not really a beer to brag about other than it's from AB and i's one of their better beers, kinda sad."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer to drink if there is nothing else around."
"Medium to dark, clear brown with a tan head. The aroma is grain and lightly toasted malt with not too much else going on. The flavor is a little bit of dark fruit with a lot of grain, toasted malt and some grass notes. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not offensive, but a relatively flavorless beer with no real exciting qualities."
"It lacks in flavor, but its highly drinkable."
"Brownish copper with a fluffy tan colored head. The smell consists of sweet, corny, metallic, with just a hint of caramel. Tastes of sweet malt with a hint of butter and toffee. It has a light medium body with low but soft carbonation. Better than other macro lagers but still nothing to brag about."
"ZiegenBock pours a deep mahogany color with a light head formation and a slightly malty nose. The beer is a little sweet at first. There is a nutty taste shortly thereafter with hints of caramel. The beer seems to have a sweet finish as well. This would not be one of my regular go to's, but its not bad either. Worth a shot if you see it on tap at a bar, but I don't think I'd ever buy a six pack."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Ziegenbock is amber-brown in color with a white, fizzy head. The nose is sweet maltiness, nothing more, nothing less. The taste is just as remarkable as the smell, slightly sweet caramel maltiness but that's about it. Mouthfeel is a light medium body with minimal carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer but nothing remarkable either. Like most, I thought this was a genuine Texas beer but was duped by A.B. I would definitely go with Shiner over this but it is a better alternative to the standard light beer."
"O: I was fooled into believing that this was a local Texas beer. Only now when I went to write this review did I learn that it was brewed by AB. That being said, I wasn't very impressed with it while drinking it. It really lacked body and character. While drinkable, it was nothing special."
"RJT"
"Until I got ready to review this I didn't realize it was a Anheuser-Busch flanker against Shiner. Sad. And unfortunately not a very good beer!"
"Ziegenbock is Anheuser-Busch's answer to Shiner Bock, I assume. It's only available in Texas and they've undercut the price on Shiner. However, if you're looking for a bock, this is much further from the real thing than a shiner. If you're looking for a refreshing water beer, this is better than Shiner AND most water beers. But other than just enough hops to make it nice and crisp, there is NO FLAVOUR aside from a weird annoying aftertaste. The best point about this beer is its keg price. It competes with the bottom of the barrel in keg prices. I don't know how. Keystone might be the only keg cheaper than this. If you're throwing a party and wondering whether to get Bud Light, High Life, Ziegenbock or anything else that costs under $90, it's an easy choice. Get this! It may not be impressive, but it totally beats piss water and is the same price! Sadly, this beer is only made in Houston and therefore anything outside of AB's Houston distribution area doesn't have this choice."
"It is owned by AB but is brewed here in the Houston area."
"Overall It was just too bland for me, nothing really going on with it. Could be worse though, and still better then ,most of the macro stuff you see."
"Good cheap beer to choose at a bar or club in Texas. On the whole though, not something I would pick up at a store to drink on my own."
"Had this during a 3-hour layover in the Dallas/Fort Worth airport on my way to Cali for the Bruery RS Party. Was told it was a local brew... Served from tap into a mug. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained very minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutmeg, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall I was not a fan of this at all. Not much going on here as it was weak in all aspects and dare I say, watered down... After this mug full I started pounding double Jack & Cokes until my flight left. What should I have expected... I was in an airport afterall."
"Overall this is exactly what I would expect from Anheuser-Bush in a Red Lager. It's in competition to the Shiner bock, and marketed in Texas hence the reason they taste quite similar. This beer, however smooth it is, lacks a real flavor, as some other beers like it do. Pretty good but not one I would pick again on my trips to TX."
"? -2-2-1.5-1.5"
"On tap at ""TX Road House", Victoria TX. Pours dark red hue, lively carbonation. Sweet, fruity aroma. Medium, crisp body. Regular, flavorless, macro taste without any finish. I think Anheuser-Busch was trying to copy Schiner Bock here. I will avoid this one."
"Drink this if you must."
"D - Obviously designed as a competitor to Shiner, but not up to the task. I did not want more than one."
"It was easy to drink and I had three of them due to the lack of anything better."
"It's inferior to Shiner in nearly every way. The label MAY be slightly cooler. Tough to tell. I'm sorry, now, for not getting my go-to cheap beer."
"It's color reminds me of a coke that was left sitting around long enough for thice to melt. And head, what head? I didn't smell much, just kinda metallic. It tastes about the same. Watery and weak. Metallic, a tad sweet with cheap caramel hops. Not particularly drinkable because it just doesn't have much going for it. ABs answer to Shiner Bock. It isn't as good to me and that aint sayin a whole lot!"
"Drinkability - The mouthfeel really saved this beer for me and I actually ordered another one. I guess AB is selling this in TX only to compete against Shiner and if that is the case then Zeigenbock is a better drink IMO."
"D- I was expecting a bock so I was thrown off a bit when I tasted it. Get here and see its an amber which makes more sense. I wont look for this one whenever I make it to Texas."
"Of note: paid $7.99 + tax for this...oh, for the pricing and selection we have at PDX!"
"Overall: The Texas version of Killian's? Not as good in my opinion, but then Killian's isn't outstanding either. I suppose it is AB's attempt to compete with Shiner Bock, which itself isn't very memorable. Overall in the macro-trying-to-look-like-micro world, I would take an Amber Bock or a Killian's over this beer, but it is alright. I wouldn't spend my own money on it."
"Pours to a compact white head and a bit of lacing. Dark amber/brown color. Aroma is sweet with crystal malt and buttery aromas. Low hop aroma. Flavor is sweet and malty/grainy with a caramel note. Mouthfeel is thin and bubbly. Some character but not enough to make it a true ""craft beer"" This is right up there with Shiner Bock and a notch below Amber Bock."
"Not bad for a macro-beer distributed regionally."
"Drinking it at a Chili's in Houston International. I find it very good with the boneless wings. I could pound a few of these down with no problem. Surprised to read that it is an A Busch product. Must have been an aquisition because this is too good to be their recipe."
"drinkability: just fine"
"this brew is one of the best beer i've ever had from A-B. that isn't saying much, though, because it's still a pretty average (but leaning towards bad) beer."
"D: I could drink a few, but I was disappointed overall. If I didn't have to catch a plane, I would have ordered a different beer next."
"P.S. This beer is sorta a shit-heel move by AB to move in on Shiner's market in Texas."
"drinkability: very easy but horrible dirty aftertaste. beer than a bud light but not better than much other."
"D: Not that great. And certainly not a Bock by any stretch of the imagination. Really a sweet take on Michelob, for all intents and purposes. Not worth a revisit."
"D: easy to drink and not disgusting"
"Pours cystal clear amber - brownish. a finger worth of head foams up then is gone just as fast as it is poured. Has to be a record for the fastest i've ever seen a beer lose its top. malty sweetness in the smell. very little smell. taste is a bit sweet up front and then rounds out with a minor bitterness in the finish. overall, a bit cloying. mouthfeel is a bit thin, but has a nice level of carbonation to it. mouthfeel is probably about the best this beer has to offer. certainly not worth the 7.50 a sixer i paid."
"Poured a dark amber. Practically no head, but there was a little bit of lacing down the glass. There was some malt smells, but that was about it. There was a sweet toasted malt flavor and again that was it. A watery mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. Not that impressed, but it was drinkable, could have used more flavor though."
"unfortunately in my hotel room im stuck to a 5 once dixie cup, so i can't really comment on the color, it looks like a redish amber color, so i'll give it an average, just to be fair. smell, or lack there of is weak, not much of anything going on, some light hops and roasted barley malt. taste is pretty boring, not much alcohol, not much hops, not much of anything. not gonna really waste anymore time on this, i'll drink the 6er, but hopefully i can find a brewpub or something here in san antonio."
"A blah attempt by Anheuser-Bush to put another Amber Bock or Shiner Bock product into the Texas market. Both, by the way, are much better than this."
"'Available only in Texas' says the neon sign. I sense this to be a local brew picked up by AB vs. a true AB product, though I'll let someone else research it further..."
"Off the tap at the Dallas Ft. Worth airport this beer was a dark copper color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The retention was moderate, the lacing only so-so. The aroma was light, toasted malt, some floral hops and a touch of sourness. The flavors were good but bleached out, toasted malt up front balanced by a nice hop presence. Hints of nuts and caramel. Slightly macro-tasting. The body was medium, the mouthfeel watery and rough, the carbonation medium/high. Clean and sessionable but weak."
"Overall this beer does taste a lot like Shiner Bock, but not quite as good. If I'm in a bar that sells both Shiner and this, I'm taking Shiner. Though for the very few places that do not sell Shiner in Texas, this is a good substitute."
"Wow, what a big disappointment."
"On a side note, while it's an AB product, this beer is listed as being made in St. Louis, MO, but it's actually brewed in Texas."
"Ah, a Texas rivalry - ABs attempt to compete with Shiner Bock, from what I hear. Small off-white head, quickly diminishing. Dark brown color body. Has a dark malty aroma. Taste of malty flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, not much else to the palate."
"Drinkability is fine in that this is so neutral tasting, but so damn boring, I'd have to be drinking to get drunk with no other options to have more then one of these."
"D - It's fairly drinkable, since there's nothing offensive in the flavor, and it's not too heavy. But it is a little bland."
"This beer doesnt really taste much like a bock but i suppose its drinkable for one of those nights when you're low on cash but arent in the mood for a light beer."
"Tastes sweet, with caramel notes. But the swallow brings a very watery taste. No hops to balance. Carbonation is pretty low and the mouthfeel is good. The drinkability is okay but I really wouldn't choose to drink many of these."
"Overall, a bit off in taste, but not too bad"
"Notes- Does not remind me of the other three Amber Lagers I've had before. Also has 4.00ABV so you can drink like a Light"
"Taste is smooth at first then some slightly burnt caramel flavors come in and the finish is smooth but very watery. It's a bit of a dissapointment, it dosen't have any of the characteristics that you'd look for in an amber beer. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Ordered this at the Grey Rock 19th hole when visiting my buddy in Austin, Texas. I had never heard of it and expected some local bock beer. Didn't have a clue it was another AB marketing ploy until now. It had a golden brown color with a modest off-white head and lace. The aroma brings mild caramel and wheat. Quite aqueous, very well carbonated, refreshing and very easy drinking. Wheat and toffee, mild malt. OK when poured cold on a hot day."
"Tried this one at a friend's party. Drank this one out of the bottle so I can't vouch for the appearance and I'm not going to try to get the smell out of the bottle. To be honest, there was not much to this beer. It has a pretty bland taste with some malt flavors. It was thin and watery. It wasn't offensive or anything, it was just a boring beer. Not something I would drink again but if it's the only thing around, I may pick it up."
"This beer reminded me a lot of Bud or MGD. It's light in body and flavor containing just a touch of pale and perhaps caramel malts and barely a touch of hops. Unlike the aforementioned beers, however, this beer didn't have any obnoxious metallic, chemical, rice, or corn syrup qualities and even finished with a nice honey-nut flavor. I actual liked it for what it was, a light, easy drinking macro. It went just fine with some BBQ although I did prefer the local crafts we brought with us to this one. One of the dryer and better AB products I've had."
"This is the most boring beer I've had in a long time just because it's trying to be something it's not. Shiner Bock isn't great, but it at least has some substance and some maltiness to it. This ""bock"" isn't even as potent or flavorful as normal Budweiser."
"D - This is a seession beer with some flavor it was the best thing on tap at the Toyota center so I drank three durring the Rockets game not a bad beer will drink it again durring the next game I go to"
"At the end of the day I wouldn't drink this by choice but it is (as many Texans had told me) better than Shiner Bock. Although they're both just dark macro lagers."
"Why does Texas have mock Bocks? It's like a pet store selling Miniature Pinschers under the appellation: 'Texas Doberman'. Wooo."
"Pours deep, yet clear dark brownish, maroon with a pale off white frothy head that lasted for a bit. Smell is bland, and metallic at first with a faint touch of malt coming later, but nothing pronounced or special. Taste is lightly malty with a definite bland, dull, nuttiness and a touch of light sourness. I understand this is was made as a competitor to Shiner Bock, and I prefer that to this one."
"Drinkability - I could see how it would be easy to drink a sixer and not even think about it. It has a low sessionable ABV, and the texture is thin enough to chug it with relative ease. On that level, it is extremely drinkable. On the desirability scale, it has next to none with me. I would never buy this beer, and typically avoid drinking it period. The only time I have it is at parties where the only other option is Miller Lite or Bud Light."
" What the hell would it take to get some Real Ale or Live Oak at ABI? Or any decent Texas beer at the DFW airport?"
"D- Drinkability is the best selling point for this one because it is so watered down. If you are in TX and want a beer like this, go ahead and take Shiner Bock. It is better than this. (but not much!)"
"Edit from 10/19/11. Was in the Austin airport the other day, and was saddened to see how prevalent this beer has become. A number of bars had signs referring to it as ""a taste of Texas," which if I was from Texas would totally piss me off. Almost every place had it on tap and/or bottle; for the most part it was the only option other than the usual BMC macro swill (a few places had shiner bock). Just very, very sad...."
"Nicely done! Very drinkable in flavor, balance, and body. You could easily have quite a few of these during a night out with the boys if you were just interested in throwin' 'em back."
"This is the first ZiegenBock I've ever had as far as I know. It might be a tad better than Shiner Bock. That's no reason to ever have another, though."
"This is probably AB's attempt to brew a beer to compete with Texas' Shiner Bock. Neither are great examples, but this one is just a watery lager that had a longer boil. Compared to Budweiser this is dark and heavy, however. Drink at your own risk."
"Decent deep, brown/gold colour with a small bubbly head. Aroma is strongly adjuncts with a little bit of unprocessed malt. Flavour is corn and very mild hops. Adjuncty aftertaste. Not a good one."
"Thanks still Grub!"
"Thanks for sample Grub!"
"Macro brewery, however this is underrated in that it is more than a passable brew. Light colour, creamy in mouth, light mouthfeel. Aroma a bit cheesy negative. Drinkable. Some bitterness in finish. Not really a bock. Thanks Grub for something new and different."
"drinkability is ok. not as bad as the usual offerings from A-B, but not great either."
"D: Pretty good, easy to drink. Not that I'd have more than one."
"Drinkability: Easy to put down a 6 pack. I assume this is a Texas only beer as I have not sen it before (only heard about it here on BA). Obviously aimed at Shiner Bock, but I'd take a Shiner anyday (as would most Texans, I suspect)."
"Brewed by A-B, the packaging looks like something from Michelobe, so I'm not expecting much. The best thing about this beer is the appearance right after the pour - an amber, caramel colored body with a thick, whitish head. A faint smell of caramel sweetness barely reaches the nose. The body is very thin (I'd hate to taste the light version) and tastes watered down. Sort of like a Bud with some caramel flavoring. I wouldn't want anymore of this, even if it was available in my state. It could be very drinkable, if only I liked it. It's one of those beers that you could drink a lot of due to its light body and carbonation. Their web site states: ""Only Texans Get It."" Well, they can have it."
"These are a step below Shiner Bock in my opinion."
"Comments - Go get a Shiner Bock. Or even better, since it's classified as an American Amber/Red Ale, go get a Rogue All American Ale or a Fat Tire."
"I've had this brew before but forgot how much I disliked it. If I had known in advance it was an Anheuser-Busch product I never would have picked it up anyway. Yuk and double yuk. No balance, no real flavor. The usual AB corn-rice filler is ever present. Carbonation is about right. Not a bock at all. Just amber colored. I guess it's kinda like that new Ultra Amber junk. I can't imagine how brewers put out product like this and expect people to buy it. Of course, it's like a buddy of mine said once: ""You can just mix any crap up, slap some sort of label on it and somebody will buy it."" Guess that's right."
"The sign in the airport bar announced ""Only Texans Get It."" On sampling the beer, I had to wonder why they would particularly want it. Pretty easy to peg in the amber lager category, so I was let down that I wasn't getting a bock beer (they should at least be honest enough to call it ""Ziegenamber""). Some middle-of-the-road malt flavor, a bit grainy with adjunct notes. A chocolate note in the malt faltered and faded before making any impression."
"Overall, A-B did a good job making a beer that i dont think is good, quite drinkable (if that makes much sense). Bottle says, ""Brewed Exclusively For Texas."" That's fine with me."
"Likely the best AB product i've had. Pours out to an odd caramel brown color with some dark gold notes. A big head of white foam quickly calms to about 1/4 of an inch. Medium to medium high carbonation and little lacing. Aromas of buttery yeast and malt are suprisingly enjoyable, as a sweet grain element rears it's head in there as well. Taste is medium-light bodied, but still fair; caramel malts and roasted notes make way for some sweet and mild hops, followed by the ever-present AB wash out. The flavors die a quick death on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a step above others, as there is some density and crispness to the beer. Drinkability is north of average. AB should seriously consider marketing this outside of Texas, becase for what it is, it isn't bad. Worth a try. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"I can definetly tell this is an AB beer, because it tastes watered down. It's not bad, and it tastes smooth. I'm surprised that this has so much praise if Bud Light is an avoid. AB beers a lot of the time taste watered down. This beer is smooth for a bock, but that's not a good thinkg IMO. It doesn't have that bitter bite that I expect from a bock beer. It's a bock beer for the non beer drinker."
"This beer was purchased for me at the bar by an Anheuser-Busch representative. I asked about Redhook, but no dice."
"Cheers2Beers"
"When you go to Hooters, you don't go for the beer. I like their sandwiches and the hospitality, but this beer is an abomination. I will just hope that there is some Shiner for me to suffer through. If only Hooters believed in Optimator!"
"I had this one on tap, in an Texas airport. Its a light, transparent amber color with a respectable white head. The nose is of lightly roasted, toasted malt. Its not a strong smell, but its attractive and is vaguely reminiscent of bread-crust. Theres a little caramel in the taste, which is teasingly malty. Finish has a touch of hop bitterness. I certainly wouldnt use the word Bock on this beer. Its a fairly thin and uninspiring brew. Still, theres nothing particularly wrong with it. Satisfying but average."
"Pours a deep amber color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly in to nothing. No lacing either. Not too much stands out in the smell. I was hoping for something slightly hoppy but to no avail. The mouthfeel is one of the redeeming qualities of the beer but otherwise I would choose something different in the future. Enjoyed at DFW airport."
"Starts even, smooth, and slightly bitter; Settles full-bodied and semi-sweet with caramel, cashew, and wheat flavors; Finishes smooth but heavy and very strong; Leaves a lasting wheat-like aftertase with sweetened edges."
"Pours a dark amber color with a flourish of an off-white head that quickly dissipates into just a whisp on top. Sweet, almost cloying aroma of adjunct malt and the faintest hint of cheap hops, accented by a touch of caramel on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin. I guess you could drink a lot of this, but I don't see why you would want to."
"Not a bad beer to pour on the roasting pig (ZiegenPig!) but not a session beer even for a pig over hot Mesquite coals."
"When I purchased this today in Orange, Texas, I though this was a Shiner Bock Amber version. I know realize it said ZeigenBock. Not bad for an amber. The label says it's brewed and available only in Texas but it's a Anheuser Busch beer. Oh well. Nothing too exciting for an Amber but I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"This arrives with a nice, thick, off-white head above a deep mahogany color. There was not much evident on the nose, maybe a light maltiness, but nothing to really speak of. It has a rich, creamy mouthfeel, but not a lot of taste. The finish is light and sweet, but again, there is just not a whole lot of flavor evident. This was all very disappointing for something that they are calling a bock, regardless of style. Even as a lager, I would expect to taste SOMETHING! Oh, well."
"[Note- unless Texas dictates otherwise I have to believe the ABV on this is beter than 4% and in line with the Michelob products)."
"Comments - ""Brewed and Available Only in Texas."" Thank goodness. At least maybe the rest of the world will not be subject to this beer. When seeking a Texas-made bock, grab a Shiner."
"Overall the taste is unimpressive. It has a bready malt taste that lasts all the way through to the aftertaste. No hops to speak of. In the mouth it feels way too carbonated and has a very thin body. The closest thing I can compare it to is soda without the syrupy texture. This seems to be a darker colored version of Bud with a bit more taste than Bud, though not much."
"As the label states, ""Brewed and Available Only in Texas"" (I believe it goes by Michelob Amber elsewhere; if not, they taste about the same). A large brewery's attempt at competing with a smaller, local favorite (Shiner)."
"Drinkability - an easy session beer with a bit of character. Why is it only available in Texas though? This would sell well farther north, bring it up!"
"Parting thoughts: A good beer from Busch, while not exceptional its easy to find and enjoyable."
"This beer is a light amber color with a medium thin off-white head that disappeared quickly. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma is faint sweet malt. Kind of thin with a light hops and honey-nutty flavor. The finish is lightly sweet with a hint of hops bitterness. This isn't a terrible beer, it just doesn't pack much punch."
"Overall Impression: This is an excellent, well-rounded bock that someone has poured into a gallon of water. What is there is good, but far too watered down to be enjoyable. The “bock” name must be from the same Texas Alcohol Laws that make Shiner call itself “bock”, but neither of these beers are a true Bock. Drinkability is equivalent to water, you can drink a lot of that, but not going to scratch any beer itch you may have. I guess I could recommend this beer if you are very thirsty, but don’t want a beer."
"I found this bottle in the back of my fridge with a born on date of 10 Sept 2002. This beer poured a medium brown with very bright clarity. The head was white and in good contrast to the dark brown liquid. Too bad it went away so fast. The aroma maybe had a hint of roasted. The taste was of malt with a little sweetness. The hops were not present in either the taste or the aroma. Or maybe this beer is so well balanced I could not detect them The mouthfeel was very light and had no creaminess. Not a bad beer to sip at a bar or in the backyard over a burger or a dog. The label says it is brewed and available only in Texas."
"I sought out this brew after seeing it on the AB web-site and many Thanks to fellow BA TXHops for allowing an Ohio'n to aquire this Texas only brew. I have to say, its like it national sister, Amber-bock in ways. Although alittle darker, it pours a dark brown with a foam soft white head. Lace was hard to come by. Taste is more malt, very little hop. The mouth starts out carbonated ( fizz-like ) but the mouth is left dry. A very drinkable, smooth brew that goes well with burgers & cookout type fair. Even if this is a once in a lifetime for me, Im very pleased I tried it."
"Pours dark brown in color with a foamy off-white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is fresh malts and grains. Taste is rather bland. This beer is similar to Shiner Bock but is a step down in my opinion. Still, if you find yourself in Texas, its worth a try."
"On tap on a recent layover in Dallas. Deep dark brown color. Minimal tight beige head. Not alot of aromas to note. Mostly sour faint beerlike smells. Taste was decent. Lots of sweet malt flavors. Then finish lacked any hop kick. A touch thin and slimy finish. It paired well with lunch. I had no idea it was an AB product. It's got to be an amberbock with a different name."
"Definately a very drinkable dark beer. Yes, the head fades quickly, but ZB is a very smooth, easy beer. There is no lingering bitterness that is so common with other dark beers. It has a malty flavor that compliments any meat dish quite well. Drink VERY cold."
"Pours a light brown ""tea"" color. Has a better head than most macros but fades rather quickly. The smell is rather bland as is the taste. It is hard to describe due to not much character. There is nearly no bitterness at all. It is quite smooth despite it's negative qualities and yes, I could consume quite a few of these, although it is WAY down on the list. Probably won't drink it again unless the menu forces it."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
