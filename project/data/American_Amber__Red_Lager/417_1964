The nose comprises light caramel, light grass, and a touch of rather mild roast. The taste brings in more of the same, though things are a bit stronger all-around, and a small bit o' coffee finds its way in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice little brew, one that was somehow surprisingly enjoyable (something about a MDL in a clear bottle just advertizes itself in the wrong way to me...), something I could see drinking plenty of if presented with the proper circumstance.","TMoney2591","Dec 03, 2011"

It had a nice burnt sort of smell with a definate hint of caramel and coffe, which really suprised me. It was so pronounced, almost like a porter type of hint in there.

The mouthfeel is on the watery side with the carbonation not helping matters in that it is almost non-existent. Overall, drinkable but drinkable like BMC beer...
