"Lacking anything to elevate it into the province of ""really good,"" this is nonetheless an beer that doesn't have a lot of clear faults: at 4.0%, and darkened but still a true lager in bite and feel, it's a solid session for its intended season—and certainly a good change-of-pace sort of six-pack."

"It can be pricy, but the taste is definitely worth it. I stocked up."

"A lightweight winter beer that promises more in the looks and aroma than what it ultimately delivers. The flavor is pleasant but very subdued while the body likewise comes across rather weak and lifeless. Yes, there's a decent low-key grain/peach/hop combination going on, and the low ABV would makes this a decent enough sessionable winter offering, but overall, it lacks depth and punch for a winter beer."

"Drinkable but pretty flat smell and not very flavorful."

"Great tasting easy drinking lager, would definitely try again. Smooth malty flavor, not dry finish. Corn smell, reminds me of a more complex version of Pabsy blue ribbon."
"So to sum up, the beer app needs an alarm, and this beer is ok"
"Justification seems like such an intriguing request -- but anyway, the beer is really nice, it does everything it attempts to do very well. It's an amber lager that tastes like an amber lager and I find that noteworthy and admirable."

"Like a slightly smoother Long Trail Ale."
"Strange aftertaste - plastic like.  Nothing I would revisit."

"Yard Sale is an apropos name for this beer:  it's pretty much junk that Uinta is selling to whomever will take a chance on it. Technically, this beer smells like Budweiser and tastes like a lager, but with a much darker hue. If you're into lagers, this might be somewhat interesting but it will be a lot more expensive than your typical lager. Me, I'm not a fan."

"Like a Bud Light clone that costs twice as much... Avoid."

"I was anxious to get started, so I went with an aggro pour, initially, backing off only when the pseudo-cascade began to create so much head that I had to back off. In fact, I got a small amount of overflow as a result. The upshot was three solid fingers of dense, tawny head with persistent retention. Color was a deep copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cool, minty quality, but I was expecting spices or some such from a ""Winter"" beer. Hmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was minty with a caramel malt undertone. Nice, but not really ""Wintry"". Finish was semi-sweet and pleasant, but there is no way that I would risk a horrific skiing accident for more of it."

"Overall like most of these beers its hit or miss and I really don't like this one. I am sure this would appeal to low ABV lovers but I see nothing ""winter"" about this lager."
""
""
"I could mow my lawn while drinking this beer if it weren't winter. I do think Uinta could become more creative with this one, however. I would buy it again, as Uinta makes the best beers in Utah, IMO. It was overall very standard and a little boring. But it has enough taste to go back and give it another try in the future. This would taste refreshing after a day on the ski slopes."

"Amber red with an orangish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a respectable, thick white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap that left a ladder of sticky lacings down the glass. Toasted malt, earthy grain and bready aromas. Medium bodied with a slightly thin, oily feel up front followed by assertive tangy carbonation through the middle. Caramel and toasted malt flavors with tangy, herbal hops through the middle that taper near the end. Finishes cleanly with a light bready, grainy aftertaste."
""
"Nice foany head atop amber colored, clear beer. Aroma is interesting. A little smoky and spiced with bock-like maltiness. A little husky. Flavor is very lagery with yeast and spice. Pretty decent and interestingly festive. Dirty tasting, earthy, and rustic."

"A decent beer, of equal quality, malty but tastes like im drinking it out of a straw of dirty pennies that are a decade old. There is flavor, both good and bad that seem to battle it out on the pallet. I can't disern which one wins the fight as Im torn from sip to sip. The alcohol is low at 4.0, so this is swiggable if you're looking to keep pace with the Bud Light drinkers at an event but want something with a little more substance. I'd naturally assume the taste improves the more you drink but I have a tough time kicking the filthy copper aftertaste. I'm not going to rush back to get this beer, but it's comparable to say a Sam Adams Light, nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't pop out with flavor. Creative label that beckons to a 50's retro look with a skier taking a dixie on a downward slope. It's snowing as I write this, and theres a crackling fire in front of me. I;d suggest enjoying in a simular fasion."
"Light brown beer with near-perfect clarity. Biscuity aroma with some toffee & smokey(faint) notes. Biscuity-caramel taste with a slight metallic tang to it. Very dry finish. Not terribly fascinating but hey, it tastes good and makes you want another. Nice to see a ""winter beer"" that is also sessionable."

"O- It's an OK beer not exactly what I was expecting but not a disappointment either. The 4.0% ABV makes it sessionable but I don't think it would hold my interest all night."
""
"Overall - An easy drinking and rather flavorful brew for only a 4 % abv brew. A nice session winter style lager."
"O: Overall a pretty linear experience, nothing that entices you to have another. Unexciting, a bit bland, mundane and boring, yawn. A yard sale that is sure to see fire sale prices."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear copper with a foamy off-white head. Retains with a creamy look that drenches the sides of the glass. Smells fresh and citrusy with a touch of spice. A firm bready presence sits along the back while a touch of earthy must hangs on the edges. The taste has a crisp and spicy bitterness along with some associated earthy citrus flavors. This is well balanced by a backbone of tight and toasted bready sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean and crisp feel. Very tight in the profiles and body. This was a very flavorful and hugely drinkable Lager, with those Noble hops in particular giving this a spicy festive feel that is perfect for winter. I’ll be seeking more of this out next time around."

"How can you not love this label? The beer on the other hand, not so much. Nothing really special about this amber/red. Pours clear and bright, tastes of slightly weak malt, and too citrusy. I was expecting something more bold and roasted. A little caramel on the finish but it doesn't stay with you. Pretty average and was a bit of a let down. Sorta' like the dude on the skis."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some grains and malts. Taste is crisp, mild, malts, grains, just a touch of hops, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
"O - No reason I wouldnt drink this beer again. Tons of flavor for a lager and a very refreshing easy drinking beer. I'd pick it up again."
""
""
"Overall this is extremely drinkable and surprisingly flavorful beer for a 4% offering. A bit one noted and underwhelming because of the advertisement of a Winter beer but I will easily/gladly finish my 6-pack but won't seek it out anytime soon."
"Overall not bad, the lager flavors are more mild but it does get fairly crisp, nice malts, hops are a bit on the lighter side too. Similar to Sam Adams Boston lager overall but a bit maltier and less hoppy, and less lager like."
""
"This isn't a bad session lager. It has a decent though mild flavor and it has tremendous drinkability. There isn't much to separate this from other beers of this style except that it doesn't have many of the off notes of a macro. This would be a great stepping stone beer for any macro lover looking to get into craft."
"A well done amber lager, suited nicely for winter without being a big, stout or porter."
"Bottled on date 11/16/2012. About 9 weeks old."
""
"A tasty brew though if it was cleaned up a bit it would be nothing short of great. Still worth a go and definitely one I'll revisit each winter."
""
""
"O - nice beer. Nose is underwhelming but the flavors are deep. Something pleasantly drinkable for the colder months."
""
"Notes: A good all around offering from Uinta very drinkable anytime of year. Cheers."
"A pretty mild beer but delivers a lot of different flavors. I especially like the use of malts here in a lower ABV lager."
""
"Even though I only bought one, it would have been easy to down 2 or 3 in a sitting. More spice would have made this more along the lines of a Winter Warmer or Wassail but instead, it's just a beer with a hint of smoke and wood that goes along with a cold winter's night by the fireplace. This isn't worth seeking out but getting stuck with a few of these isn't bad either if you love a good holiday beer to kick back with."
"O: There is really nothing special about this beer so I would not recommend seeking it out but it is not a bad beer - just kind of average in my mind with nothing that makes it stand out. Easy to drink and sessionable but not sure I would want to have a bunch of these as I want something with a little more complexity."

"Yard Sale is a normal beer, a straight up American amber, traditional in the sense. I've been getting back to my roots lately and just digging on simple styles more and more. I like the back and forth. Yard Sale has a nice dark bronze semi brown look with the color and a frothy inch of off white/tan bubbles up top. Typical lager look. A nice dose of European hops, earthy, grassy, a caramel base, some grain, bold and to the point, a lager. Taste is a refined amber, a fuller body, not as watery than your average Yuengling. I get some bread, caramel, some earthy hops and all together malty. Not too much else to say here, it delivers per the style, just gotta jump on it fresh. Body is towards low with a nice carb build, glides down the gullet. A tasty beer, simple and fresh."
""
"Tastes nicer than I initially hoped from other reviews. By no means stellar, but it's a nice, smooth, sessionable lager. Little bit of caramel and bread taste with very subtle hops. Creamy mouthfeel, well carbonated and a good body. I'll enjoy this six pack and could see going for this every once in a while as an easy drinking winter lager."
"I don't know, maybe this is much better fresh. As it is, there is nothing to get excited about here."
"Overall a nice suprise. It may be a winter seasonal but I wouldn't mind having this year-round."
"Bottled 3/8/12. Nice red color, good head. Smells malty, grains, lager-like I guess. The taste had a very interesting cereal flavor without being too grainy. I actually liked it. Overall it was nothing too crazy but I wouldn't turn down a bottle if someone offered me another."
""

"Pours a clean/clear reddish amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, with some caramel. The taste is kinda sweet, malty, a little hop bitterness. Medium body. A nice little brew, worth checking out, I guess."
"Pours a bright, clear, amber with a frothy tan head. Head is about a finger and a half high and leaves some sticky lacing. Nose kinda disappoints, not much going on, some toasted malts and that's about it. Taste has more going on but still a bit underwhelming. Some nice fruity esters up front followed by bready, biscuity malts. Mouthfeel, again, was thinner than I expected. Overall a bit of a let down, I expected a winter lager to be a bit heavier and more flavorful. It is definitely drinkable though, finished the whole six pack and woke up pleasantly hangover free this morning."
"Bottle from Total Beverage Westminster poured a clear reddish amber with a small lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness and toasted malt. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel, toasted malt and light earthiness with a crisp lingering malty finish."
""
"unimpressed. yeah, its a lager, but this is a bore. oours a very clear light brown color with a small white head. smells malty, german, crystal palts, light, but no hop at all. flavor is the same, watery a bit, but malt based and very very low key. not what id expect in a winter beer, even a lager. nothing burley or hearty or meaty or spicy. mouthfeel is fine, crisp and quaffable, but overrated in my opinion. nothing special here."
"O- Not bad but not something to seek out. much better beers from this brewer. No info on bottle or website about the ABV."
