The flavors were similar with the sweet malt coming first followed by notes of bread and biscuits as well as yeast and then at the end the pleasant bitterness of floral hops.

It smells clean, and the lightly bitter finish is refreshing, but there's something in the malt profile I don't like and can't quite put my finger on. I suppose it goes down just fine as long as I'm not thinking about it.","lisomiso","Jun 01, 2011"

3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours amber with a finger of resilient off-white head. Sweet malt, a little red hot candy and some apples to the nose. Sweet and a bit grainy to the tongue with a slight hop edge at the end. Light to medium bodied, well balanced and smooth going down. Great summertime brew right here from a series that always satisfies this Full Sail fan.","stephens101","May 26, 2011"

3.41,-5.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I picked this one up as part of a mixed six pack just the other day. Poured a dark amber color with a good sized white head. Slightly metallic aroma, along with sweet malt and some hops. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and drinkable, with flavors of sweet malt, caramel and hops.","emmasdad","May 14, 2011"
3.35,-7.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma is not strong but still malty and slightly fruity, just a little appealing. It pours a dark brownish amber with a thick, fluffy white head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor is malty with a fruity undertone, mainly pear, and just a touch of hops. Texture is fairly smooth, just a little fizzy. I’m not a big fan of lagers, but this is pretty good.","Cyberkedi","May 11, 2011"

3.8,5.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"(12oz bottle). Pours clear amber with off-whtie head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma has florals, sweet caramel and fresh cut grass. Taste is sweet with more caramel malts and some light bittering hops. Medium bodied with a slick/oily texture. Finish is smooth and slightly bitter. A pretty good beer although its a little maltier than I prefer. Still, I could drink a couple of these. Nice job.","trappistlover","May 06, 2011"
3.43,-5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D: Decent drinkability, one or two, but doesn’t come off as session style or one that defines a style. Overall a limited beer that is limited in spectrum and comes off a bit ordinary.","beerthulhu","May 04, 2011"

Amber in colo of course with a smell like lager, sort of earthy too. Taste is decent, a little bready and easily distinguished as a Full Sail beer, maybe it's the malt? Overall, an easy sipper and a good value.","ArrogantB","Apr 16, 2011"

3.77,4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pleasant amber flavors on the initial sip imply that the subtle aromas are minor distractions. Light caramel and some hop spice are evident yet without the fuller body of an ale, as implied. Finishes with a bit of light chocolate and dry hazelnut. Still relatively full in body for an Amber Lager and with a firm and dry spicy finish. Stands up to warming fairly well given its relatively coarse structure.","HalfFull","Apr 02, 2011"

The aroma is vibrant with rich, toasted malts and a little bit of a yeasty chaser. The body runs in the medium range. I very much enjoyed its sweet, malty taste, which seemed to capture what I like best about Amber Ales. Easy to drink.","puboflyons","Mar 17, 2011"

I will have my fair share until they stop making this.","Klondike","Mar 10, 2011"

3.78,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours an dark amber color with a 1/2 in off white head. Retention is not great. Smell has a malty sweetness to it, sort of bready. There is also some hoppiness in the nose, but the sweet malts stand out more. The taste didn't knock my socks off, but it was certainly not bad. The taste gives you more of that easygoing maltiness, I am getting bread, grains, maybe a little caramel. The gps are less pronounced in the taste, but the different malts give some complexity that makes up for it some. Mouthfeel was on par for this style, but might have lacked just a touch of carbonation. Overall a great addition to the LTD line from full sail. I got on the LTD train a little late and I am regretting it now, they are making some really cool German style lagers.","gkunkle","Mar 07, 2011"

I felt the mouth and taste was rather watery and bland and it reminded me more of an amber ale with no hop bite. I know they were going for a larger that amber ale drinkers would like, but I feel they missed the fulled body malt flavor that lagers a supposed to have and then forgot to add the hops for that little bite in the finish.","Beatnik4913","Mar 05, 2011"
