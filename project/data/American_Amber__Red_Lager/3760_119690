3.46,-3.4,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Not to sound petty, but I still can't over that this so-called "Amber Lager" is actually bright gold. It speaks to the fact that this recipe lacks virtually all the components intrinsic to the style - even the most basic element (colour) that's listed right there in beer's name! Almost designed as a hybrid between Organic and Tankhouse, 100th Meridian isn't as good as either.","biegaman","Dec 28, 2014"

A dead center compromise on the very smooth and easy but mild Lager and the more robust, hoppier character of Tankhouse. For what that is worth, I think it's a pretty good beer. Thumbs up.","TheHammer","Jul 22, 2014"

I rarely purchase Mill Street products (outside of these samplers every few months), but this is a brew that I'd definitely return to if it were to become available in a more convenient format. This is the sort of brew that 'regular' beer drinkers and BAs alike should be able to enjoy equally - well worth including in future samplers.","thehyperduck","Jun 08, 2014"

3.94,10.1,3.75,4,4,4,3.75,"A well-wrought amber lager, the organic nature merely an unused sidebar to me (I'm just glad that it doesn't seem to screw anything up). Flavourful, rounded, and pretty tasty overall - more lagers need to be made in this fashion, as if to debunk the American myth of bland, cheap, tainted caramel 'step-ups' from yer typical adjunct swill. And that's every single fucking thing I know on the matter.","biboergosum","May 23, 2014"
