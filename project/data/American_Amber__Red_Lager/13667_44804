Floral hoppiness does make an appearance in the finish, and the aftertaste does suggest that this is, indeed, a Märzen.

3,-4.2,3,3,3,3,3,"The Crack & Glug was music to mine ears and produced two tawny fingers of dense, bubbling head with good retention. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet, much more so than Yuengling Lager, to which a previous reviewer compared it. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy and with a pleasant melange of flavors on the tongue, ranging from an initial sugary sweetness to an herbal mintiness and back again. Finish was more sweet than anything else and I think that the constant onslaught of malt would be too much for me to CANsider inclusion in my cooler.","BlackBearForge","May 08, 2011"
3.5,11.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Well I have to say I was expecting better from this Starr Hill offering but then lagers are harder to dial in than the average ale. They have a way to go with this Fest beer and I hope they are in the process of tweaking it.","indiapaleale","Apr 03, 2011"

I think I would have rated it higher if it was priced like it tastes. I'd pick a can of Yuengling over this beer and would compare them fairly equally. It is not bad just made to make you think it's a craft micro brew and it's a boring lager.","goldbot","Nov 01, 2010"
2.97,-5.1,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Purchase before Aug. 2011 notched in the label. Pours a nice golden to amber in color with good carbonation. Thinnish white head that shrinks quickly but leaves some lacing on the surface. A pleasant caramel aroma with some warm, bready malt and a pretty good balance of citrus and floral hops. Grainy malt flavor with a bit of caramel sweetness. Some floral hops but this beer is more oriented towards the malt. Crisp mouthfeel and light body.","Clydesdale","Oct 31, 2010"
3.28,4.8,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"D: A lackluster fall seasonal from a normally above average brewery. This is lightly flavored and too thin/astringent to be very enjoyable. You won't miss much by avoiding this one, although it's far from bad.","ktrillionaire","Oct 07, 2010"

2.96,-5.4,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: A below-average Oktoberfest. With Starr Hill being a fairly local brewery for me, I was hoping for more from this beer. This really isn't that good. I'll have to hold off on getting more of these until next year to see if it gets any better. Pity...","Vdubb86","Sep 30, 2010"
3.25,3.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This one pours a hazy light orange color with a fast fading half finger of ecru foam. The smell is a bit sour as if any hops that were in this beer had already gone wrong. I think it may be the burnt biscuit flavor in there. There are hints of orange zest fronting the slight malt aroma. The flavor is of orange zest and not a fresh one at that. The maltiness that I expect to see in an Oktoberfest is totally not here until the aftertaste. This isn't the worst Oktoberfest, but it sure as hell isn't the best. The mouthfeel and drinkability do it some justice but overall I'd go elsewhere for my Fest beers.","TMoney2591","Sep 30, 2010"
2.19,-30,3.5,2,2,3,2,"This is the last sixer I bought before leaving the NoVa area. It pours a mostly clear pale apricot topped by about a half-finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, peanuts, buttercream, and a touch of orange. The taste seems to initially lean in the direction of an increased amount of orange, but this then dovetails into a heavy dose of buttery biscuit with a generous amount of sweetness tossed on top. What hurts this thing is that the orange doesn't really leave once the maltiness enters; what results is, in effect, a cupcake whose stump is an orange slice. Honestly, it would be fine if this were done in phases, but together it just doesn't seem right. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel. Oddly enough, despite the slightly awkward flavors, this thing spitefully retains a decent amount of drinkability. It may not be the best O-Fest I've had, but it's certainly not the worst, either.","billab914","Sep 23, 2010"

Light orange-brown in hue, while somewhat cloudy turns to a washed out zinc hue around the rims. Quiet nose of apricot/peach pits and skin, if you had to choose you'd say it's more malty than hoppy but really it's a wash, some mocha and bread, more than the nondescript white citrus and dried lawn grass notes, just not much going on. Light to medium-bodied, possesses a big carbonated swirl in the mouth, a handy way of disguising the fact that there's not much here either. Some bitters and brine, sun dried lemon peels and more dried out grass. The malts are like an aftershadow, you can just make out the general contour but no depth. In fact, watery would be one way of putting it. Even after focusing harder on each successive sip, it is not any easier to find a flavor to describe. Empty finish.","farrago","Jan 08, 2009"
