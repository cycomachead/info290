"very smooth drinking beer, not bitter at all"

"Meh for na amber beer."

"Nice smooth feel and taste with no bitterness in the aftermath.  Would make a good summer beer"

"Classic Amber pours a dark reddish color with a small head.  There is a very sweet spicy aroma, its very odd, and a bit offensive.  The taste is very crisp, clean, with a nice malty flavors.  Good flavors, a little flat.  Overall its a very clean, crisp and tasty amber lager."
""
"Pours a very deep amber in color with a good 1-finger off-white cap that settles down to just along the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the sides after a minute of so. The aroma is of some roasted malts and some brown sugar. Little more going on with the taste with some caramel malts, hint of spice, dark fruit and yeast in the mix as well. A very slight 'pine' finish which adds some to this brew. No harsh or bitter aftertaste is noted though. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation. Overall it is a decent brew"

"Pours to a thin off-white head that falls to a thin layer that laces minimally and a dark amber color. Aroma is a toasty malt, brown sugar and slightly fruity notes and a touch of grassy hops. Taste is weak and dusty (this beer may be old?) with toasted, caramel malt and a weak, waxy hop balance. It's not bad but it is rather unremarkable. Mouthfeel is crisp and fizzy, much like BMC. Overall a so-so beer. Bear in mind I could not find a freshness date on this beer and it was stored at room temperature for lord only knows how long. In an Oklahoma package store. Change the damn law already!"
"Not too shabby; in fact it goes down quite nicely. Looks the part, while the aroma and flavour have a caramel malt backbone paired with some satisfying pine notes. Good body. A pretty solid amber lager with more flavour than most. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"This is some smooth drinking if you want something malty. At $6/6-pack, it's hard to beat."

"A bit fizzy for me, but others will say it's well carbonated no doubt: a malty lager, no more, no less."
""
""
"A decent, middle-of-the-road-ish amber lager. Decent, but nothing particularly noteworthy."
""
""
""
""
"A fairly decent beer with a nice malt taste that struck a good balance with the sweetness that appeared throughout the beer. A very pleasant beer and one I'll pick up again if it stays at this price."

"O - Point's Amber drinks wonderfully with it's smooth profile making it really too bad the aroma and flavor seem so cheap. Nice notes of toasted malt and caramel sweetness are marred by the adjunct corn and cereal grains - imagine a ""light"" beer darkened up a few shades."

"3.0 D: Pretty unimpressive amber ale."

"Appearance is clear amber with some head, poor retention. The nose features uninspiring amber malts with sweet grainy notes. Light waves of grapes an molasses with a hint of caramel. Taste is light and sweet with molasses and watery grain. Not much character. Mouthfeel is light, dry, and highly carbonated. Overall, pretty blah."

"I wouldn't by a six pack."

"O - A decent amber, but nothing spectacular. Easy drinking but needs a bit of a flavour boost to kick it to the next level."
"Overall- Kind of sad that this isn't better balanced with hops. The nose and carbonation leads me to believe that everything is in line for a decent amber but the lack of hop balance leaves me wanting something else added in."
""
"Another one from these guys that I got from my brother. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear red with a frothy white head. Nose is sweet and fruity. Mild citrus, apple, honey. Crisp mouth, clean, subtle twangy finish. Sweet beer with sugar cookies, citrus, mild bitterness. Another good beer that is as simple as it is tasty."
"O: A very good offering from Stevens Point. The Classic Amber is a very approachable beer with some character."

"Overall - So far I like every beer I've tried by Steven Point Brewery. This is a good amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A sweet and lively amber. Wish the aroma had a larger presence. Pretty one flavored taste. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Not what I expected as an amber. Hoping I got a bad bottle. Not nearly enough hop or malt flavor."
"Rather run of the mill and forgettable if not for a slightly better-than-average head structure."
""
"O: I like this beer. It's at that balance point where it's not heavy that you can't drink more than one, but not light enough to have too many of."
"This has been on tap at my local watering hole for quite some while. Just realized I have never reviewed it I think. This is prob. The best beer Point makes. The best thing about this beer is the way it looks. Very rich amber color with a beautiful head that has nice lacing. Not much aroma going on but I do not have the best smeller. Very mild. The flavor of this beer has nutty, dried fruit, and grain. Kind of like a granola bar. Nice to drink I am on my second one so it is decent. 312 Goose Island tap has been staring me down though. Hope my chicken wings get here soon."
"Pours a dark copper color with a slight fluffy head. Scent is mostly that of grains and sweet malts. Taste is slightly heavier than I expected. Toasted malts and sweet malts clash together to ignite the taste buds. Overall has a sweet, refreshing taste that is very drinkable. A great everyday kind of beer."

"Overall, being a person who wants beers with robust strong character, its nice to have a nice enjoyable delicious beer to drink that does not to do by being strong as it can do so while being subtle. Give this one a try. I would say that it should be rated more than what BA together gives it."
"The more I drink of this beer, I want to read the flavors of Vienna Lager that fuses with American Amber Ale maltiness- maybe this is what the brewery is targeting. Regardless, it leads to a very floral and lightly carmelly beer that could use more citrusy hop bitterness to balance- this one just becomes too sweet and one-dimensionally floral."
""
""
"Sprecher's amber/vienna/black lagers are all better and more classic than this."
"O-not much to write home about with this one, it's beer without much flavor or smell"
""
""
"Overall: A very sessionable amber. Goes well with red beans and rice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is okay if your looking for something like a darker version of PBR."
"Overall- I've had other beers from this brewer that I liked and I'm a fan of Amber Ales. i thought two and two would equal four, but here it apparently equals zero. I won't be buying this again."
"Overall I actually like this more than Yuengling's amber lager which is puzzling since it's a lower score."
"Notes: Meh. Just an average beer. Pretty bland with just caramel malt and hints of hops. A little on the sweet side, but fairly balanced. It doesn't wow but it is quaffable."
"D- decent enough to say i would drink one again but would not buy a sixer i would do another single"
"This is not a beer that will wow you, but it isn't terrible either. This is similar to the kids that don't ask questions in class, don't fail but also do not get great grades, they just attempt to go by unnoticed."
"Amber clear colored beer with a small white fine head. Head dissapates very quickly. Some mild lacing. There are not many carbonation bubbles, it's pretty plain looking. Smell is rather plain. Some basic malts but they are hard to pick out. It's kind of bland. Taste is pretty smooth with some caramel malts and a slight bitter finish. Pretty smooth but not really distinctive. It's an average amber at best but reasonably priced so it gets some drinkability points. Light bodied, light carbonation and smooth. I'd not buy a six-pack but if I was at a bar and it was on tap, I'd probably get one."
"D: Easy drinker, good for a couple. Sort of middle of the road for the style."
"Poured a watery chocolate color with alot of carbination, the head disappeared almost immediately. Beer did not have much of an aroma and the flavor was a bit watered down, I did notice hints of bread and coffee and aftertaste of honey. This is just an average beer, I think I would enjoy Killian's just as much."
"1 thumb up from me"
"Notes: Overall this comes off as a nice average beer."
"I have always liked Steven's Point beer. It is one of the original ""old"" Wisconsin breweries. For that reason alone we should be buying and drinking their beers. Pretty much everything everybody else has reported on this beer has at least a little of what I would agree with. This came in an assorted 12 pk that includes some wheat beers. Come on over, you can drink them if you want!!"
"The beer pours a beautiful dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted malt scent along with a touch of caramel sweetness. The taste is average. It has a bone dry roasted/caramel malt flavor that's weak and watery. It goes down quick, but finishes bitter and overly dry. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is your basic amber ale. It's a middle of the road beer with little to get excited over."
"If I had to give an amber to somebody who'd never had an amber, it'd be this one. Think about it: if the first beer you have in a style is too good, then you're going to look down upon--or at least be disappointed with--most other attempts at that style. This is so *in the middle*. It does everything it's supposed to, no frills or surprises but also no bad nodes or offness."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet malts, a touch of hops. Taste is also a good balance of malts and hops, very refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"This started well, with my pour creating two fingers' worth of medium-tam head with good retention. Amber?!? I would have said ruby-red with NE-quality clarity. This really looked pretty in the glass. Nose had a grassy hop presence overlaying the malty sweetness inherent in the style. Mouthfeel was medium with a lightly hoppy taste in the mouth. Finish had a mild sweetness, but I wanted more throughout. It was not a bad tasting beer, it just suffered from a mildness that could have been avoided. Get the Point?"
"The mouthfeel was thin. A step thicker than plain water. So of course this went down pretty easy and I can totally see this as a session beer that at least is better than drinking BMC."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite. This one tastes way to chemical like and not well balanced. I will pass on this in the future."
"Overall a very middle of the road amber. Drinkable yes. Would I pick it up again? No."
"D - Overall kinda disappointing. Wanted to give Point a try and was hoping for a solid amber but for the style it is lacking. Kinda tasteless but certainly easy to drink. I must say that it is a great looking beer! I'll give em' another try. I hear the RIS is good"
"Pours a dark ruby-amber body with a thin white head that falls to a cap. Aroma is bready malt with a hint of fruity yeast esters. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Flavors of toasted malt are at the center with a light hop flavor and a dry finish. I think this tastes better out of the tap, but not a bad beer. Good drinkability."
"Oh what an eventual disappointment this beer is once it hits the palate. It pours from the bottle a dark copper color. There is a faint fruity hoppy aroma. There is a massive head which lasts for but a few brief moments. The taste is bland, with barely a lingual taste bud being tantalized. The mouth feel is best described as being wet, like drinking a class of water. I could only recommend this beer for those actively flying commercial aircraft or doing extensive yard work on a steaming hot day."
"Amber colored beer with a quick fading head.Aroma is very weak..faint malts? Taste is malts,hops and light florals.This beer is as about as boring and bland you can get without actually being bad.It might be nice to try one but don't shoot yourself if you never do."
"Drinkability: A decent amber lager. This beer is interchangable with almost any other amber lager out there but is still pretty good. Worth a try but don't go out of your way."
"Drinkability - Eh, I've had better Ambers and Point Brewery is doing nothing special with this one."
"I feel I've pretty much summed up the drinkability portion already -- this is a very ""middle of the road"" type amber. However, I did not mind drinking it at all, and wouldn't have trouble drinking it all night long. It's cheap enough and easily sessionable."
"(D)- Very dissapointing for its amber classification. Very lackluster in every way. Almost bland."
"D-An easy session brew, and crisp and refreshing enough for a warm day."
"Amber color with light prickle and little to no head. Malty nose that is heavy and rich. Clean attack that takes a while to develop. When it does there is a full malt flavor and a thick mouthfeel. The finish is pretty clean. There are some mild hints that are reminiscent of nut but are just a result of the richness of the malt I think."
"Easy to drink, but unfortunately that's because there ain't much to it, not awful but not even as good as Killians. I suppose it'd be a easy starter for someone trying a beer darker than Budlight."
"Pours a clear, orange/amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, slight pale malt, and a hint of hops. Barely fiits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong yeast cleanliness up front, hint of hops, and and very faint sweet malt. Wow, there is just no real body. Both the hop and malt flavors are severely lacking."
"This beer pours a clear light amber color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of very faint caramel malt, but mostly there is no aroma. The taste is a little stronger, but mostly water. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very weak amber ale that I cant see myself drinking again."
"So nothing really stand out but overall a respectible beer. Appearance is very crisp and clear amber color with one and a half finger head that sticks around for a bit. Smell is decent, slightly sweet malt with an interesting spice combo and no real hops to note. A touch of hops come through in the taste, unfortunately so does a bit of metalically taste. Mouthfeel is average, light to medium body and fizzy carbonation. Drinkability is pretty decent."
"Drinkability - A little more flavor and a little different flavor than a macro lager. Nothing especially notable here, though. Might be a good choice if options are few."
"Drinkability for this beer is pretty good. Give it a try if you find it."
"Not bad overall, interesting to say the least. this is quite a bit of flavor for what I'd assumed would be an adjunct lager type beer."
" Pours a nice dark amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is pretty much all malt,caramel roasted malt.Aroma and flavor are much better as it warms .Flavor is caramel malts,slightly nutty with a small touch of hops.I found this offering very good and was sorry that I had only bought one.Drinkable for sure."
"Overall: it is an okay beer."
"another mediocre one from point that i probably won't need again."
"I used to think this was Da Bomb until I got my craftbeer feet wet. Deep mahogany color, quickly disaperaing head, no lacing. Has a nice caramel malty, slighty burnt, even more slight nutty flavor. Balance is all right, but leaves me with a sweet finish, could use a little more hop bitterness & flavor to balance the sweetness out better. Not bad, but nothing to kick your heels together over either."
"I'm surprised scores aren't better for this. I think people may have let price influence perception of quality. This is one of the tastiest lagers I've had, and I can't recall being able to find something this good for this cheap. Then again, I haven't delved into this style before this beer, so I'll temper my excitement. I was tempted to score this even higher in a few spots. It goes down so easy too. Easy to down a sixer, considering the moderate abv. The best from Point I've had - but their Belgian White and Augsburger Golden Lager hold their own, too."
"D: I could get along with a couple two or three of these. Quite sessionable. I haven't had a Stevens Point brew since college over 10 years ago. They have quite a few more interesting offerings than they did back then. Thanks."
"D - I think this beer is a little underrated, possibly because the name has you expecting an amber ale not a marzen/oktoberfest. Very sessionable."
"D - This is either a slightly below average amber ale, or a really shitty oktoberfest. I personally disagree with the classification of this beer as an O-fest, and I'm rating it as if it were and American amber lager. This ain't bad for the price, but it's not all that great either."
"I enjoyed this beer last night, although it was the last beer of the night. It held up to the Killians and others I had last night, I do say this is really a beer I will enjoy in the future. i am looking forward to the other beers this brewing company offers."
"The drinkability is good, smooth easy drinking brew. Prosit, MK"
"drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not exactly something deserving of the label of ""classic", but it's alright as long as you fully understand you're getting a light, though easy-drinking amber lager."
"D - Very easy to drink. Good for someone just going into reds. Might be a good session beer, if I didn't think it may get a little boring after a couple. Not bad, not great."
"Drinkability: Just enought flavor and the low alcohol content makes this a potential session beer. It seems every brewer is doing an ""Amber"" something (ale, lager, o'fest style). As a Marzen/Octoberfest this is average at best."
"Beer is boring and a little odd tasting."
"Pours a clear amber/orange color with a moderate head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is caramel malt, but not too sweet, lightly burnt. Taste follows with more of a sweet fruitiness- pear. Little to no aftertaste, very light bitterness. Easy to drink and one of the more interesting of the bunch."
"This brew has a redder copper color, deeper than most, with a minimal 1/4 in head. The smell is minimal with some hints of caramel and mild hops. The taste is heavier than most in the same category with some mild hops and hints of earthy tones...almost a wheat and malty flavor. Medium body with moderate carbonation. This beer is the ""classic"" brew from Point and represents a strong heritage. Not something over the top, but more on the traditional side of things. Better than the ""norms"" but not spectacular."
"overall-wants to be a macro when it grows up"
"Well balanced, this one is not designed to knock your socks off but provides a good, solid session beer."
"Served cold, this would make a decent session beer."
"D - 3.5 - Pleasant scent, good drinkability - carbonation a bit too high for my tastes."
"D- high drinkability, because it is smooth and medium bodied,"
" ~ This is one of choicest local brews around Stevens Point, Wisconsin. I frequent the fine establishment Archies on a weekly basis during the winter volleyball season where they offer this fine Point selection on draft, and I take full advantage. If you haven't indulged in a Point Amber I suggest you give in and enjoy one or two or more."
"A decent beer at an affordable price. Pours a deep copper hue with a thick foamy head with a surprisingly long-lasting lace. Smells fresh and piney with light hoppiness. Tastes well-blanced with a crisp, malt first wave with a tight hop finish. Moderately light mouthfeel and a light alcohol finish makes Classic Amber a moreish brew. Highly drinkable and not at all disrespectful for those with a thin wallet but desiring more than the typical domestic pilsner. I buy this regularly, mixing it up with my high ABV big beers"
"m: light to medium bodied not overly carbonated"
"A pretty nice, all-around amber lager. I could easily see enjoying a few of these at a ball game, wedding reception, or fall festival. Nicely done. Well-brewed and well-balanced."
"A very middle-of-the-road beer that does not offend, nor does it excite."
"It is a good beer, definately drinkable and worth picking up a six pack or more of."
"Point Amber was clear dark amber color with a light tan head. Before long only a very thin layer remained. There was a nice malt aroma, a touch toasty. The taste was mostly malt with just enough hops to balance out. It was medium in both body and carbonation. It's a decent tasting everyday sort of beer."
"Ordered on-tap at the Exchequer Pub in Chicago, under the title Exchequer Red Ale. Poured a deep copper, red color. Clear, with a thin white head and no lacing. Smell of light maltiness. A little weak. Taste begins a bit watery, with the sweet malt in the middle, then a light touch of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is again watery, with very little carbonation. Overall, the beer goes down easily, but its weak flavors and watery feel give it no real character."
"Had this on tap at a super po dunk bar right across the street from my po dunk apartment. Quite a clear coppery color with amber on the sides. Head is small then nothing. Signs of carbonation are not present. Smells toasty with touches of caramel and a bit earthy. A touch of nuttyness comes as well. Not much more than that. Taste is fairly bland. Generic caramel flavor, though it seems moderately roasty. An herbal earthy hop character is there. Semi wet paper in the middle which might have been bad taps, I don't think so though. Finish is sweeter with a bready touch. Really smooth but a bit watery and nothing too exciting at all. Not bad for its price though but there are many better ambers out there."
"This beers most notable point is in its pour. It pours a nice copper hue with tons of tiny little bubbles racing to the top. With a nice off white frothy head and good retention. It smelled of malt sweetness, spice, fruit peels or fruit spcie, and soem floral notes as well. It tasted smooth and sweet with a nice balance of hops and malts. There were hints of malt sweetness, fruit spice, and a slight bitter finish. All around a very nicely balanced beer that was relaxing and enjoyable to drink."
"Pours an attractive clear amber in color. Great color, but the lack of a head is disappointing. Weird aroma. Started off smelling like wet cardboard. But as the beer was given a chance to breathe, caramel and an almond nuttiness emerge. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Taste is disappointing. There's a watered down malt flavor. Some caramel, but not much going on here. A mild hop bitterness emerges toward the back. It doesn't really balance the malt sweetness as it's not that strong to begin with. A very uninteresting amber."
"Poured a nice Amber color. A medium tan head dissipated but left a thin ring and comes back with a nice swirl of the glass. I loved this beer from the moment the mild hops hit the palate. A nice malty flavor is present and the Pale malt is easily tasted. A good froth on the palate releases nice sweeter malt flavors and the finish gest the hops back in play. Point has done well in improving their offerings and this brew was good and very drinkable. A perfect example of what an Amber should be. Cheers, Joe"
"The appearance is a brown edged copper with a deep red center. The tan head is big but it slowy dissapates and leaves almost no lacing. The smell is caramel and strong on the toasted malts. The taste is good with some caramel smoothness and hints of toast. It also taste the best if you drink it with the big fluffy head in the way. So chug it a little bit right after pouring. The mouthfeel isn't extremely good or bad. It is a little bit thicker than most. It is also more drinkable if you let it warm up. The bottom line is that I have had better. Drink Paulaner Oktoberfest."
"Ruby red, has some nice brown highlights. ¼ inch plain creamy white head, nil lacing. Grainy nose, some sweet malts barely detectable. Biscuity, some toasted malts off the cuff; very thin in the body, contrary to the style characteristics. There are some caramel and wheat cracker notes, the palate is left cleansed. There isnt much going on here, and this certainly fails to the O-Fest/Marzen standards. Another plain-Point-product."
"Bottle provided amid a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering at 2005 GABF. Thanks much, I really appreciate the opportunity to try craft beers I'd never see otherwise. Pours a two finger light tan head over a crystal clear light brown-red liquid. Smells wet sweet with caramel and some chalky dry munich malt character. A little bit of cardboard and some dirty hops (which indicate tettnanger). Tastes moderate sweet with a later (and also moderate) hop floral. Malt flavors come across stiff and formal. They've got some vienna malt character (ie, similar to, but sweeter than munich malt) as well as a hint of caramel and some iron. Also a bit of cardboard. All these flavors are presented, but not inviting. The hops are earthy, yet light in the floral aspect. The aftertaste is sugar wet sweet and may be the most distinct and refreshing part of this beer. Md sugary mouthfeel and md-high carbonation."
"The beer is overall very light but not really watered down. Some good taste are here but they are minute. Also there a hard-water in the nose and taste that I just not like. So take it on that."
"I think If I lived in Wisconsin I would drink this often !"
"I must be honest and say I wish I hadn't chosen this one for a pick-a-six."
"I hate to be a nitpicker, but why is a beer that has 'amber' on the label and all over the Stevens Point website, and is brewed year-round, called an Oktoberfest? It kinda, sorta tastes like one, but still. Average, average, average... aver... zzz... zzz..."
"This really doesn't fit what I would consider a typcial Marzen, but for a macro, it comes off pretty well. Poured out to a darker amber brown color with a nice foamy head. No lace in the glass. Very weak aroma of hops and spices. Flavor was sort of bland, but notes of caramel, hops and malt were noted. Finsh was slightly sweet. This could be a nice session beer. For a major brewery to make a go at this style, I give them props."
"Taste is mild toasted malt, slightly sweet, maybe a bit of caramel, with a touch of hops bite at the end. Not a particularly complex beer, but pleasant, very drinkable anytime."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a 2 finger head and small amounts of lace. As with most of the POINT brews, there is not much aroma. Some slightly roasted maltiness, a bit smoky, with caramel notes and a minor hop presence. Taste is OK, not horrible, but OK. A mild roasty, smoky malt. Some vanilla and caramel notes but both are minor. A decent hop presence for a Marzen, maybe just the fact that it is not as malty as it shoud/ needs to be. A bit watery. It seems that this brewery is trying to make their brews more mass market friendly. For each of their styles, they seem watery for the style. Decent beers, but not too complex. These would be a good leap into the world of BA."
"Very clear, darkish-amber colored brew with a decent white head. Leaves a little spotty lace on the glass. Smell and taste are both sweet and malty. Not much in the way of hop flavor... just enough that you know they're there. Moderately fizzy carbonation, medium-thin mouthfeel. Not sure this belongs in the Marzen/Oktoberfest style... maybe a Vienna-style lager? Overall, a straight middle of the road beer... Nothing really bad about it, but nothing really exciting either!"
"Taste? there's a malty feel, a caramel tone that swims around the palate, but it leaves as quick as it comes. Light body, short finish, little texture, too much carbonation at the front. Hollow, listless...a trace amount of flavor trickles back and flits down the throat, but it's not a terribly happy sensation. This one's definitely for the lower rung, and will impress only those with small reserves of taste and infinite tolerance for blandness."
"An average Joe here. Things start out ok with a fair bit of deep caramel on the pour, and a good bit of frothy, and sticky head that offers good retention. But, things slide downhill from there. Aromas are malty, yet also skunky and barnyardy (in a bad way) as well. The mouthfeel is crisp though somewhat syrupy. Flavors are hard to define? Mildly malty, watery marzen-esc flavors, some burnt caramel and a nutty quality on the tail end-some sourness as well. I guess this is fair for a mass marketed Marzen, but as one who truly enjoys the style this is just another Amber for the quassi adventerous."
"Pretty nice tasting beer from Stevens Point Brewery. I got this in a mixed grab bag and I am actually pretty impressed. There is a nice color and aroma to this and the mouthfeel is very balanced. Dry malty overtones fill your mouth and you are left with virtually no aftertaste. Nothing amazing, but a nice session beer."
"Clear ruby amber color, good 3/4 inch head, but its small bubbles start deconstructing a little early. Some drips and dots for lace. Pleasant pecan nutty aroma, bit of maple. Very smooth mouthfeel, works pretty well with a mild malted milk character -- but could use more toastiness. Lower carbonation than my expectations. Hops are what's lacking in this brew, even for a Vienna Red (while its hair splitting, I think this qualifies better as a Vienna Lager), there's just nothing much to balance the beer and make it a better sessioner. As it is, it flattens to a sugar water close. Not too bad, easy drinking."
"As a Wisconsin native I am happy with this one."
"Ruddy brown color, with almost no head. This beer is a lot better than the Point Special I tried. Has a deeper flavor of malt and a nice hop finish. I may even consider getting this beer again, if the chance ever presents itself. This beer may best as a standby, a solid choice over the macros."
"Clear, orangey-bronze in hue. Slightly off-white head, very modest in size (maybe a half a finger), fair retention, some unorganized lace. It does look nice in my glass. The nose is unbalanced, half toasty, nutty, maltiness and the other half is odd dull butter and DMS. The potency is mild so the off-ness can be over looked. The taste is better, the light nutty-toasty malt is the focal point, the hops bitterness is mild but very complementary towards the finish a clean sweetness emerges (an adjunct?). Medium-light body, slick carbonation, watery in spots. The aftertaste is tacky & sweet and it falls apart a little as it warms. This is a serviceable beer, if the price was right it would be worth drinking on occasion. But since Ive never seen this in my area I need to thank ZAP for the sample."
"I'm not sure why this is listed as a Marzen, other than the label references some lagering. Overall, this is a pretty average amber lager. A bit murky. Flavor profile is flat, with some sweet caramel malt and a touch of apple. Mouthfeel leans slightly to the watery side. Smooth and uneventful."
"I think they may have changed the formula and made this beer a little less bold. Either that, or my taste buds have changed. It is still decent, but now, it is a just above average beer."
"Clear ruddy amber hue. Initially fluffy, off white head recedes into a thin, but dense layer that manages loose lace. The aroma is odd, unbalanced combination of toasted malt, sweet caramel, herbal hops along with a grainy, lighty metallic twang and slight sulfur. Hint of sickly sweet corny DMS adds a macroesque edge. Non descript, sugary toffee hits the palate at first, then is ensued by mildly astringent, grainy 6-row husk and non descript ambient sweetness. As the beer breathes, graininess mellows into a refined white bread like quality. Paltry hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness unhindered and nearly cloying if not for the thin, overly attenuated body. DMS emerges late along with a resurgence of dark caramel malt, lending a cooked, creamed corn on stale toast impression. Finishes faintly herbal, with notes of dry cracker and hominy. Classic Amber is a poor Marzen, and is reminescent of a 25% Rolling Rock, 25% Killians, 50% Spaten Ofest mix. If this is all malt, they sure tried to make it taste like it has large amount of adjuncts. Skip this one."
"This beer is not worth the effort. It reminds me a lot of weak, wannabe beers like Killians and Amber Bock. And the smell is bad."
"Good lookin' beer, like many Point beers, big full head (slight beige color), amber and clear.  Slightly toasted aroma that's on the light side.  Flavor, while pleasant, lacks signficant presence.  Mostly, if not exclusively, malt taste but lacking complexity.  Mouthfeel is full from signficant carbonation, otherwise a little thin.  Finish is short.  Why do they market, on the label, that it's 100% malt?  What does that say about their other beers, and who are they trying to influence?  A rather inexpensive (<$5 in MN) beer, but worth it."
"This pours a reddish orange color with a clean, clear look and very little head....the nose is toasty and nutty...not real strong but a nice smell....the bigest knock is probably the body which is on the thin side but it isn't horrible...just not as strong as the rest of this beers characteristics..Taste is very nice, but subdued.....toasted malts...some hints of caramel...and almonds....this is really a pretty decent beer....not in the upper echeleon of Vienna's but a very good session beer and one I wouldn't mind drinking just about anytime..."
"The beer is a deep clear amber color.  A nice looking beige head tops the beer and coats the glass nicely as I drink.  There's a pretty nice somewhat thick malt aroma.  Seems like a munich and/or vienna style of malt.  This is really a pretty decent amber lager.  Nice malt taste.  But an even nicer dry, hoppy note.  It accentuates the maltiness in this beer very nicely.  Body is about medium.  Very drinkable."
