"Nice deep Amber color one of my favorite Lakefront beers. Great from the bottle, even better from the tap."
"Pretty good nice and sweet beer."

"The taste is a little better than the aroma suggests with a good caramel malty note with a slight peppery bitterness."

"Definitely not an overly sweet maltiness. If you want to enjoy it, I'd suggest doing at least two in a row. One is good if you're just enjoying a brew with a meal but to get the full flavor, I'd take few along for the ride so they don't get lonely and you get a good taste. I don't know if its a great stein beer, but it is still fun to drink in one!"

"Picked this one up at Super Sub and Six Pack in DuBois, PA while on trip. Never seen it and do not anything about Lakefront but figured worth a try. Very surprising, good looking beer that offers very little to the nose but oh so tasty, very good. Not sure if I will ever see this again but I hope so."

""

""

"Overall: I put down three full solo cups of this one- it's a marvelously drinkable beer that paired excellent with the pulled pork barbecue that was being served at the party. Would highly recommend for craft lager lovers or new converts to craft beer, as it is an approachable style for all beer drinkers and one that really hits the style on the head. Would recommend."

"OVERALL: A good American Red Lager here from Lakefront that would not be out of place in my fridge. Malty, bready lager beer that drinks easy and has pretty solid flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is dark copper with a mild haze and sports a half inch off off-white head. The aroma bring caramel malt, bread, grain, a hint of sweetness and mild alcohol. Perhaps a touch of citrus in the flavor with a light bitterness in the finish. Pretty drinkable, though the beer itself is rather bland and uneventful. Ok..."

"O - Very drinkable amber, confident in its flavor but not overly showy. This is yet another excellent beer from Lakefront. The average beer drinker would enjoy this."

"DATE TASTED: November 16, 2013... GLASSWARE: Sam Adams lager glass... OCCASION: TWO rates in one night--feeling good!... APPEARANCE: solid orange amber body; pours a Santa's beard-white head, frothy and thick; lacing is sporadic but significant... AROMA: malty and confidently so...pleasant hint of caramel, candied sugars and faint hints of floral hops... PALATE: somewhat smooth; simply a slick, aptly medium-bodied presence with a lingering aftertaste...TASTE: indeed malty; borderline dunkel/doppelbock base; flat, singular effect...OVERALL: caught off-guard by the five-finger malt punch this brew delivers; liking the eight-beer mix pack Lakefront puts out more and more; not a standout but one that pairs well with rainy November nights like this..."

"Overall a neglected style that examples are not prevalent. It was advertised as an amber on the menu, but I was pleasantly surprised to get a Vienna Lager. Slightly astringent. Other than that it was to style and smooth. Served straight from the cooler at the Elephant and Castle in Chicago."
""
""
"Pretty good beer."
""
""
"Appears a deep amber with nice clarity, thin layer of white head, and heavy lacing. The nose is malty with a light herbal hop presence. Notes of caramel malts and brew present beneath the hop profile. Taste starts with a nice hop bitterness highlighted by some flavorful pine an earthy hops. This is followed by a nice grainy malt character which brings some bread and honey to the flavor. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, this is a nicely balanced brew and makes for a nice flavorful lager."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep cloudy red orange with a small white head with some staying power. Smells of dark roasted malt with some berry undertones, the label does not lie. Tastes of roasted malt with some berry undertones. Beer is medium body with nice carbonation and a clean taste with a great finish, can't really describe it other than you just have that great feeling. Overall a very good beer."
"Paired this with a garden tomatoes, balsamic, grilled fish sticks, and it could stand up to any winter fare. Order this for T-giving & Xmas. Bravo!"

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, surprisingly, with medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a smooth, though somewhat placid, mouthfeel. Some more carbonation would fit this beer and accentuate the aromas and move it more prominently across the palate. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips."
"Pours a copper color with a finger of off-white head some of which sticks around for a bit. The nose is musty and astringent – not a good start. The malt flavors are easily discernible in this hearty beer. The finish dries out a bit, but there is also a hint of sweetness from the malt at the very back end. This offering has a unique flavor that I enjoyed, however taken as a whole package, this beer is mediocre."

"Holy hell, this if absolutely fantastic. Why have I not been buying cases of this?"
""

""

"O: The ol' go to beer in these parts of the MKE where every bar carrys BMC (and LF). While I think its a good easy drinking amber lager I'd like some hop character to come through in this beer. Between Riverwest and east side dark I prefer the east side dark (i know i know they are totally different beers) but most carry RW over ESD not sure why..."
""
""
"Beautiful dark copper color, lots of sweet malt in the nose, but with a hop bit at first taste that yields to a sweet, slightly citrusy body. Extraordinary good mouthfeel that finishes as smooth as any lager I've ever had. A big surprise, and a great beer."

"O: A refreshing yet somewhat substantial lager that would pair well with german sausages and sauerkraut."
"Pours a clear bubbly deep amber red. Nice inch deep off white head and notchy lacing. Sweet and bready smell with some floral and piney citrus hop smells. This is just a really nice balanced flavorful beer. It's biscuty and malty in the begining. This gives way to a touch of sweet caramel flavors. There is not a huge hop presance, but some bitter pine and citrus hoppy notes come out. All this is held together by an awesome rich creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth and drinkable. There is nothing here that will wow anyone. It's just a well made pefectly balanced red. Really nice beer flavors and very easy drinking."

"overall, a lot going on, easy to drink and it leaves me wanting to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An OK beer, but nothing really distinctive in the flavor profile. It's a little too heavy to be a hot weather beer (or anything I'd want to quaff out of a full stein). Would likely be a delicious pairing for beer cheese soup, beer bread, or food in general - drinking standalone isn't the best experience, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has been around for quite a while and I can see why. It is an outstanding example of a Vienna-style lager. It's too bad a lot of beer advocates shun this style and gravitate towards more hoppy and extreme beers. I love Vienna lagers and go back to them often. No other beer complements food like these do. This one does just fine."
"This beer poured out as a decent looking amber colored brew, the head was white and fizzy. The smell of the beer gives of some lager yeast aromas as well as some hops and malts, all seemed pretty well balanced. The taste of the beer was nice, it was earthy and crisp with a sweetness in there too. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side I thought for a lager, it was drinkable and nicely carbonated. Overall the beer wasn't anything too special to me but still was nice to try."
""
"O - I was pleasantly surprised when I had this for the first time at a backyard bbq. I was even more pleasantly surprised when I found it at my local beer store."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap, it's a very good summer beer for a malt lover. (Not sure the bottle version is quite as good.)"
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer and the reviewing process. It gave me a better appreciation for what is really in this beer, a complex amber lager that should be enjoyed thoroughly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lakefront's ""flagship"" beer, Riverwest, is an easy-drinking amber lager that's got the malt and hop balance down pat. If you like your lagers malty but not cloyingly sweet, this utterly smooth lager is for you!"
""
"O- Overall, this is a good Amber overall."
""
""

"O- Very drinkable. An extremely attractive beer (color, head, lacing). Very flavorful. Leaves a good taste in your mouth long after you're done."
"O: Fairly easy to drink and enjoyable but nothing really special. Definitely a sessionable beer but not sure it is one I really want to get again."
"Overall this beer surprised me. It is really good with my one complaint being I wish the finish was a little crisper. Besides that a pretty outstanding beer."
"O - Hops were relatively absent. Nice complexity to its malt but a little to off balance. Still clean and a nice lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"WELL DONE, TRY IT!"
""

""
""
"12/1/12 update--I had a full glass this time and this is much better than I recall--changed Appearance to 5.0 and taste to 5.0. 1/23/13; changed Overall to 4.75."
""
"O -- Overall this is a really nice drinker. Not in-your-face, but also letting you know you've got something out-of-the-ordinary in your glass. The Amber lager is a catch-all style for BA, but don't mistake this for Leinie's Red. VaTech Hop Head -- you need to find some fresher stock."
""
""
""
"Looks and smells like an amber lager or red ale but after one sip there is definitely something wrong with this one it tastes like a hard apple cider or faint farmhouse ale. Don't know if something went wrong or is infected but this one is way off the style guidelines not worth reviewing in my mind, avoid"

"A decent enough amber lager, (or 'stein beer', I suppose), but the bar is pretty freaking low for that style around here, so, I guess I gotta say something sorta nice about this here offering - uh, nope, I got nothing - just an adequately balanced, good to go brew."
""
"this is a decent beer and gives me a little hope for the rest of my mixed pack that's been pretty basic to this point"
"Nice earthy amber lager that hits the right notes including a long finish. The beer is just right for the Fall with a big malt backbone to anchor everything. I like the way this brewery manages to brew both decent ales and lagers and maintains a wide range of styles though drinkability seems high on the list rather than cutting edge."
"Very good example of the style."
"The smell is nice, a little roastier than I like. This is one red I would maybe have again. I am swinging through Milwaukee next month so I might seek this out on tap."
"M: A medium body with good carbonation and good mouth coating."
"On tap at the brewery. A nice drinkability to this. orange body and soapy head, spicy pepper and clove and nutmeg. Above average mouthfeel. Hoppy grapefruit c-hops, good malting with caramel, good amber.Decent balance. Just not the greatest drinker for me, wanted something edgier."
"The body is medium but seems a little shallow, almost thin and spritzy, at first. Warming just a little seems to help quite a bit, though, as it fills in and goes smooth and creamy."
"Nice appearing medium amber with persistent white foam head. Fairly non-descript nose that is vaguely malty and somewhat earthy. Taste is slightly sweeter but thoroughly malty, biscuits, caramel and dried apricots. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin but with decent carbonation. Extra points for drinkability but is otherwise middling."
"O: Not a bad beer, average rate of consumption and enjoyment though it did start to lose its originally luster a bit more then mid-drink. Small flashes of promise mixes more so with average regards makes me a fence sitter on this one."
"O: Nowhere near as delicious as the Cherry Lager."
"O) This is a solid brew, and I felt that pairing it with the bacon cheeseburger and bottomless fries was an excellent choice."
"O: This beer goes down very easily and is quite sessionable."
"Pours a hazy light reddish-orange color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of biscuit-like malt and butter. A buttered biscuit if you will. Taste is of biscuit, graham cracker, and citrus zests. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. There is a good carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice bready aroma and taste. Reminds me of a Fat Tire variant."
"This is a very nice amber that Lakefront has put together. It has stellar balance between the hops and malts that makes it dangerously drinkable--you hardly notice that you've just put away three pints while talking about the politics surrounding the Wisconsin state budget or whether the Packers will get a chance to repeat this year. While it's a favorite of the Milwaukee hipsters, this is an amber for all people and should not be missed."
"Very light bodied, but it is a lager. Would be better a bit heavier, but this way is quite refreshing, a bit maltier and sweeter than it is hoppier. Clean, refreshing."
"This one pours a muddy reddish-brown color with a puny head. Aroma is slightly toasty bready malts, with a touch of fruit and some citrus hops. Taste is fairly standard, toasty bready malts with some dark fruit undertones. A bit of astringency on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and goes down easily. Overall, a decent lager, but nothing to offer over some cheaper alternatives."
"O) A nice amber lager. I'd pour another one for sure."
"D: Not a bad beer, but nothing really special about it either. Easy to drink. A decent representative of the amber style."
"Overall: Though it lacks the real depth of character and malt complexities of the finer examples, it's still suitable as a mild, easy-drinking lager."
"Pours a clear amber color with a decent head that leaves some lacing. Scent is very heavy with malts as to be expected from the label on the bottle reading ""All Malt."" Has a really good taste to it that is very well mixed. Very malty but also has some nut hints and sweet carmel. Leaves a good after taste. A very tasty and well made Red Lager."
"Overall, another tasty brew from Lakefront. Well done amber lager."
"Another revisiting of an old SummerFest brew. It pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, wheat, light pine, and orange peel. The taste amps the caramel up just a bit, increases the orange peel, and then adds a bit of orange flesh to the proceedings as well. Near the end, the caramel toasts itself (or somehow becomes toasted...whichever...). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little amber, something pleasant enough to stroll around SummerFest with."
"D--This is a really excellent, sessionable brew. I recommend this one for sure and I am glad I was able to try it!!"
"The drinkability is very good. This is a light easy drinking beer."
"Overall a solid lager. I could picture this one holding well against any German Oktoberfest beer, but with just a little les ABV."
"Good beer. I could see this pairing well with a meal."
"Pours a clear bubbly deep amber red. Nice inch deep off white head and notchy lacing. Sweet and bready smell with some floral and piney citrus hop smells. This is just a really nice balanced flavorful beer. It's biscuty and malty in the begining. This gives way to a touch of sweet caramel flavors. There is not a huge hop presance, but some bitter pine and citrus hoppy notes come out. All this is held together by an awesome rich creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth and drinkable. There is nothing here that will wow anyone. It's just a well made pefectly balanced red. Really nice beer flavors and very easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Pretty straightforward. Overall, not a bad brew but not something I would drink on the regular personally. Nice and malty. Thanks to BeerFMAndy."
"Drinks fine but a little less sharpness would have made it much better."
"They also make a very nice holiday ale."
"Pours an attractive amber-red, with average lacing. This rich all-malt lager also boasts of a lovely ripened fruit bouquet, and the first taste reveals a biscuity flavor, with a slight zip of hoppy citrus in the finish. Tasty and well-done, and a perfect example of a lager done the right way."
"Halfway through the variety eight pack and finally a keeper. Does Milwaukee lager traditions proud."
"There is a weird bitterness in the finish. It would be alright for me if there were more hop flavor or extra maltose in the brew to balance it, though it does fade away after a couple minutes. Maybe I'm just too used to Oktoberfest beers and how soft they are because this one jarred me a little from my expectations, which I suppose isn't always a bad thing."
"Overall impression: I'd never consider this a go-to, but for what it is, a damned drinkable brew and well worth a try."
"Overall: For the style, I think they did very well. I'm not sure how I feeling about some of the flavor sensations I got for my personal tastes. This created some unique aromas and tastes that are not found in other styles."
"A very good Amber. It smells sweeter than it tastes. The hops compliment the malt beautifully. Very balanced."
"Clear light amber body, minimal rising carbonation, with 1/2 finger off-white head, quick dissipation resulting in an uneven thin sheet of head. Nose features big maltiness, some roast re Hot Rocks, sweet and either pilsener or munich for smoothness, a wee bit of floral hops on back end. Taste mirrors nose, more malty than hoppy, with a bit of hoppiness on back end but not very much. Mouthfeel is medium light, minimal effervescence. Drinkability is OK, but nothing special and not all that tasty."
"A strong amber lager with individualism. Worth trying again."
"Well balanced and flavorful, this was excellent and really surprised me."
"Drinks more like an ale than a lager, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Would drink again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Sure enough, that makes this easy to enjoy and I hardly noticed the ABV% in this. For the summer, this won't take the place of a wheat beer but I could have seen myself enjoying more than one bottle at a time. I enjoyed this and it made for a pleasant surprise since I haven't had too many beers in this style. Worth a try once for those willing to go outside of their boundaries a wee bit!"
"I could have a few of these but be careful on the pour!"
"D - Good. Give me more."
"This is something new to my tastebuds, but nothing special. Decent taste but that's it, worth skipping."
"That trait is caramel butteryness. It's what I always used to say was diacetyl but what I now know is sometimes intentional. It's usually used, when intentionally used, to middling effect, but here it mixes with a kind of dry riverwater maltiness and rounds everything out into a beer that jibes together differently, that works in way I've never seen a beer work before."
"MD- Thick and creamy. The taste makes it a ""I won't buy this ever again"" beer for me. I was really looking forward to my first Lakefront offering and was really let down."
"This is drinkable, but nothing I would reach for again."
"D - Very easy to drink, but not the most interesting beer. Certainly worthy, although I'm not sure I'd have it often."
"I keep wanting to drop down one or more of these scores towards average, but frankly, this is a really solid, above average Amber lager. No flaws. No truly defining characteristic, but something I would have loved early in my craft drinking career and something I could easily toss back a few pints of today. Also nothing I'm seeking out... but that's the style, not the beer."
"D - It would be hard to find this one again and the label is so average I would probably pass right by without noticing. Very drinkable for the style."
"The beer fares much better as an English Pale. But even then, the malts are too simplistic and too caramelly. Still a pleasure to drink if you like your Vienna Lagers as an Ale."
"d - An ok amber ale. Some nice caramel and bready malts in the smell and taste."
"Color is what you'd expect, amber-red. Carbonation is almost white and there was good head. The aroma was very faint and the flavor is ok but nothing outstanding."
"An easy-drinking, well-balanced, enjoyable amber lager!"
"This beer is a light amber in color almost golden. The aroma is almost flowery and sweet. The taste starts with a light sweetness and carbonation and the sweet flower smell prevail in the taste. It finishes dry with no bitter. I think if you have a girlfriend who doesn't like beer have her try this the light body and smooth taste make this an easy beer to approach, but unlike many beer in this style it is full flavored."
"Mouthfeel, good dynamic between the light aftertaste on the palate, and the surge you get initially. Very affordable round town."
"The body is smooth and creamy. Carbonation level is low-to-moderate. Eases consumption for sure. The flavors on this along with the aftertaste really remind me of a Marzen/O'fest. Big malt presence, mild caramel flavoring, light hops, and the finish is very doughy and bready. Light ethanol taste on the backend as well. Again, Lakefront has made another great beer. I am super excited to try the other 4 offerings Andy sent my way. Thanks again for the trade!"
"Very drinkable and pleasant. The alcohol content is just right for this brew, allowing me to share the growler over the afternoon and enjoying every bit of it."
"Overall a very tasty lager."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a very nice touch of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with some nice caramel notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this one hit's the spot pretty well."
"D-A nice drinkable beer, which does meet the style more than it doesn't. I will have this one again."
"D- Goes down pretty easy and would make for a session beer. This one won't cause too much palate fatigue because there really is only one dominant flavor."
" M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a fizzy finish. D- This beer has no real off flavors but it doesn't really have any other flavors either."
"Pours a clear amber/orange color with a slight offwhite head that has a tint of yellow. Forcefull pour produces less than a finger of foam which displays very little retension. Nose is a very welcoming mix of malt and a bit of hops, much more going on with this aroma than I was anticipating for a lager. Also detecting a bit of caramel notes in the smell. Taste a nice blend of malt sweetness upfront and a touch of hop bitterness that finishes crisp. Slight bit of caramel/toffee in the taste. Light feel and med carb. Overally pretty good."
"Pretty good amber, solid. For a lager this has alotta flava"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is of malts and somewhat sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer worth checking out."
"Got this as a ""try this"" from a guy at work. Haven't had anything else from this brewery but am looking forward to giving more of them a try. It is amazing to me how many ""ambers"" there are out there that just don't live up to the perception; many are too thin or over the edge on hops. An amber (to me) is not just a color or a strong version of a lager, they have a different (and better) profile. This is a pretty well done AMBER."
"(D)- A great beer to enjoy one after another. A bit sweeter than the norm, but not out of the ordinary. A solid all around beer that has something to offer."
"Very nice beer."
"As I've stated I love this beer. It's on tap all over town. So getting my fix is rather easy. I've been lucky to have been to a couple weddings at the brewery where you can basically lay down under the tap Homer Simpson style. Free of charge. ALL NIGHT! I love this town."
"Delicious lager. Well built. Strong malts, creamy texture, good nose. Seems to bea bit hoppier than past years, but still one of the best from Milwaukee. Great brewery tour also, with a great fish fry for tourists. Probably Lakefront Brewing Companies best beer, however, there new Monkey Wheat is turning many heads, and is a great light summer beer."
"3.5 not too bad, though the tang is a bit much. would not seek out, but the more i drink the more it cajoles me into drinking it."
"drinkability is ok - not a beer i would pick up again though"
"Notes: A really good beer for sessions. Well balanced and so creamy."
"This has got to be a very popular beer at Lakefront, it's got the perfect characteristics for a nice crossover beer. First off it's a lager, so there's some common ground already. Secondly it's very balanced yet it's actually got some color from malts and flavor from hops. But the key here is balance with that hop profile. Pours an amber with an orange glow when held toward the light, head is light cream and forms nicely with lace broken up into unevenly strewn patches. Aromatics offer up some citrus herbal qualities with biscuit malt sweetness with a touch of caramel. A clean air of yeast nut edge, maybe almond. Flavor blasts through with a creamy mildly tart and bitter sweetness. Cereal grains bring caramel sweet layer with hops through in the citric floral zip that's needed for balance. Mouthfeel has a smooth crsip curb appeal for the masses, lighter bodied with a semi dry finish. Carbonation is very nice minor hop burps come after a few sips. Drinkability overall is by the stein, I'm not sure how this is served in Milwaukee but it's defniitely suitable for at least a 1/2 liter krug or stein."
"Enjoyed on tap at Miller Park from a compostable corn polymer cup. Poured a bright, golden-copper body with a fluffy white head that fell slightly and remained all the way to the last sip. Aroma is balanced between sweet malts and floral hops. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to be refreshing, this beer tasted sweet with a slight nuttiness and faint hop finish. Excellent drinkability, it was the perfect full-flavored beer to have while watching a baseball game."
"Pours a beautiful dark coppery amber with a VERY thick, if not too persistent, head. (The bottle foamed like nobody's business so I had to grab a bath towel or get a lapful of beer!) Aroma is quite strong and malty with just a hint of citrus. Taste is malty, not complex but pleasing, with just a touch of sweetness. Texture is smooth and lively, leaving quite a tingle."
"Off-white head and a rusty amber/orange body. Rich malty aroma. Caramel malts with a little bit of floral hops. Taste is much like the smell. Good bitterness to wrap up the experience. Real nice mouthfeel thanks to just the right amount of carbonation."
"The feel is milky and smooth as silk. Chocolate milk on the tail end. This is the best Lakefront beer I have had thus far. Rich, smoothy, nutty."
"Drinkability: A rather flavorful lager; I wouldn't necessarily seek it out again but it was a cut above the standards for the category"
"Pours a clear, amber/orange color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, grass, and some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, then grass, then slight earthy malt, and some yeast cleanliness in the finish. Overall, a little lacking in body for what I was expecting. A decent beer that is easy to drink, but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear amber color with about two fingers of fluffy light ecru foam. Aroma and flavor are of sweet caramelized malts, medium toasted grains, grassy, earthy bitter hops. This red ale is medium bodied and amply carbonated for it's style. Worth a try if you stumble upon it."
"Overall, I do think this is a reasonably drinkable beer. I wouldn't search it out but I'm glad I had it and will enjoy the one I have. I do think the blend of tastes and mouthfeel make worth trying."
"Easy drinking, easy forgetting."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy amber color with a good amount of rising carbonation. The head was one finger of beige foam that retained quite well and left lacing in sheets. The aroma was sweet and tart with sour malty notes, citrus, toasted malt and sweet spices. The flavors were of toasted malt punctuated by a slight citrus sourness with some nutty elements. Similar to a Bock beer with a nice, clean finish. The mouthfeel was rough at first but softer after it had a chance to breath. The body was medium and the carbonation a bit too high."
"Drinkability: when I say that this is becoming my ""go to"" beer, I really mean that this is becoming a session beer for me."
"D - Other then the smell and lack of head, not a bad brew. Consistent, put together taste, could drink a few of these."
"Riverwest Stein Beer has a lot going for it. At first it reminded me a little of Sam Adams Boston Lager, but a bit more smooth and subdued. I like this pick for a weekend hanging out with my friends. I could easily drink this one all night long and be happy for doing so."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful session beer with some substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"This is a fairly hearty lager, at first I felt it was a bit thin but given time to sip on this one I find it quite satisfying. I would surely drink another."
"D- one of a sampler, one of the better ones in the box"
"This is a decent beer that I couldn't quite get a read on with the slight sourness that crept in."
"D= average. This was a very basic malt based beer. I could see myself enjoying a few of these."
"It's a mediocre malt beer."
"Not an instant classic but it definitely grew on me as the glass got lower. The flavors melded better as it got warmer as well."
"D: A fair beer from Lakefront, I really didn't like it, but I didn't hate it either. Drinkable, but I don't see myself getting this again."
"A good solid example of the style; nothing earth shattering, but a good solid beer that I would enjoy having on a regular basis if it were available. Good job!"
"Overall - It's not perfect but somehow I love it. The DMS is distracting, perhaps it is intentional? Or I got a bad batch? I enjoy the balance of toasty and grainy malt against the wide spectrum of hop flavors, no doubt due to the use of at least three different hops. Quite spicy compared to a lot of other beers. Vaguely comparable to Sam Adams Boston Lager, but without caramel and not the same hop flavor. If you like Sam Adams, you might like this. If Lakefront is reading this... I think this beer might benefit from the addition of a bit of rye malt, to help smooth it out. Just a thought. I really enjoy this beer, the hops balance the malt very well."
"This is a good beer that is good for style."
"A decent session brew. Quite full flavored for the style."
"Not to bad, I found the more I drank of this the more It started to grow on me. Pretty solid amber."
"Drinkability: nice session beer here. If you are in the mood for a malty brew this is a good one to have."
"Overall a decent beer though the malt sweetness would catch up with me after the second one I do believe."
"Two of the last three sixers of this I have bought have been disappointing. This is my one of my favorite beers on tap. Bottled last week of August - so beer is about 6 weeks old. Deep dark chestnut color - nice head and lacing. Smells moderately malty with a touch of skunk. Taste is not as malty or roasty as I remember - finishes like Heineken - not much but just a hint of skunk. Mouthfeel okay - nice and carbed. I really hope Lakefront works on its consistency or my hometown brew will go back to Sprecher."
"Nothing special..."
"Maybe a criticism: it seems to be a little ale-like for a lager. Maybe that's why I like it."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Easily sessionable, and the flavors are decent."
"D - This is a pretty good amber lager. Surprisingly hoppy for a lager."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with decent head and a lacing that lingered. The smell was probably the weakest part of the beer with there being some malts and maybe a little fruity. The taste was real malty and the mouthfeel was great because it was just so silky, creamy, and smooth. The drinkability was also very nice, I had two bottles and I still wanted more."
"Taste has a decent malt backbone, slight bitterness in the aftertaste, smooth and creamy texture with a good amount of carbonation, the buttery slickness is the best thing about this beer."
"The taste is toasty bread, crust, some pine, hints of caramel, citrus, herbs, and butter. The starts is sweet followed by increasing, faintly spicy, light bitterness. It's light and smooth but remains flavourful and interesting."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester as part of this brewery's sampler 8-pack. Pours a dark amber with a good half inch or so of off-white head. Smells bready with a fair bit of caramel. Tastes biscuity with strong caramel and chocolate. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Actually a pretty tasty beer, and pretty damn drinkable. One of this brewery's better offerings IMO."
"Nice tasty brew, my first from Lakefront, with high drinkability, but just a so-so mouthfeel."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with an average tan head. The aroma is fairly weak. The taste is buttery, tea like malt, slight lemon flavor. No off-putting flavors just nothing exciting. The feel is light almost watery, thin carbonation, with a sweet-tea like finish. An average brew at best. No off-putting flavors but no good characteristics. Easy drinking yes, but not worth remembering. Definitely better amber lagers out there."
"D- Pretty high, I would have another if I could. I recommend it. Would pair nicely with red meat."
"D - A near perfect do-anything beer, you really can't go wrong. Will pair well with pub fare, and is equally sessionable. A quality amber."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a clear pale amber with a couple of fingers of off white head. Plenty of carbonation. Caramel/bready malt aroma with some noble type hops. Malty but not sweet. A little more hop bitterness than you might expect from an amber. Clean and very drinkable session type beer."
"Super smooth and medium-bodied. Highly sessionable. Consistently one of my favorite hometown brews."
"D-Something doesn't fly with me. I'm not a fan."
"I picked this beer up in a sampler case with 8 different beers. I wasn't disappointed with any of them, and if given the opportunity to drink any of these beers again, I'm taking it."
"D - Easily drinkable with a nice, balanced malt character. A good beer overall and certainly one of the best efforts from lakefront."
"Very drinkable. Nothing bad to say here. A great after dinner/work beer that brings a medium to the playing ground between the thick porter/stouts, and the lighter ales with it's own balance between malts and hops."
"Drinkability: A good easy drinking ""fest"" like beer. I like swilling this from my mug. ABV is a little high which keeps this from sessionable, but still enjoyable. Definately worth trying, I would buy this again."
"Only the faintest slickness, an unexpected by-product for this style that holds it back from perfection. This is the very definition of drinkable. Who needs Germany when we have Wisconsin?"
"D - An easy drinking lager. Light flavors, as expected from a lager, but I've had more robust red lagers (Winter Skal). I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't want another one though!"
"I can tell this was made for maximum drinkability; if this was on tap at my local bar I'd spend the whole night with it. Sure, it may be a tad too strong, but I think this makes an excellent session beer."
"Medium body with gentle, tingly carbonation. Extremely easy to drink and a beer that definitely leaves you begging for more. A well done lager."
"Eh. No thanks."
"Overall, Lakefront gets a kudos on this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the finish is relatively clean. Overall this beer isn't bad, but I was hoping for more."
"http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/malay_apple.htm"
"D - Ok beer. I'm not really impressed. I got a variety 8 pack from Lakefront and really haven't been impressed with many of these."
"A very sessionable amber, the Riverwest Stein Beer has low to moderate carbonation and is medium bodied. Malty aroma with a hint of apple from the yeast. Flavors of maple, apple, and a slight butterscotch. Malty grain presence too, but well integrated. Color is a deep reddish amber tone, true to style, with a small amount of foam. Truly a session style lager, with an interesting flavor profile to match."
"Very reliable. A quality session brew if there ever was one."
"A good solid offering from Lakefront. One of my ""go-to's"" should I see its tap handle gracing a bar."
"Pours an orange-copper color topped by a pinky finger's worth of off-white head that vanishes almost immediately. Very light aroma of caramel malt and a touch of fruity hops. Palate is mildly sweet up front, with a touch of smokiness and just a little bit of metallic tinge. A hint of vanilla sweetness emerges mid-palate before a mildly hoppy finish. Body is nice and silky smooth. I could drink more than a couple of these."
"Looks pretty with an amber/red body and a bit of lacing. The aroma has a mix of caramel malt and American citrus caramel. The malt is super smooth on the tongue, but too faint. The hops are nice, a bit juicy, but not complex. There's also a slight off aroma and flavor that comes out as this beer warms. I don't know about this one, something is rubbing me the wrong way."
"Excellent Beer!"
"Drinkability - Solid brew and unique for a lager which is why I'm sure it's getting plenty of good reviews, but overall not that amazing. Kinda can't make up it's mind whether it wants to be a lager or an ale and basically gets stuck somewhere in between. Try it if you get the chance, but don't expect the world."
"This one has a little hop to it, is very clean, lightly malty, and very very drinkable. It's not exciting, but it's not supposed to be. It's a great step up from a pale macro lagers and probably the best example of this style i've yet had. That may be damning with faint praise, as i mentioned i haven't seen many of these in stores around here, but nevertheless; it's enjoyable."
"This brew poured a clean clear dark brown with moderate head that quickly dissipated but carbonation that kept on going. Nice maltiness, earthy and robust. Mild brown bread, slight yeastiness and medium body. Clean crisp finish with an earthy bitterness and molasses aftertaste. A mustiness permeates the brew but it is not totally overpowering, almost pleasant. Very german feeling, a more complex amber than im used too with more malt layering and less hop flavor. A hearty lager, and with a hardly noticeable alcohol content, it sessions well."
"Very easy to drink. The glass was empty before I realized it."
"drinkability is good. this is not complex, but rather a simple and clean tasting brew that is refreshing. there are enough flavors here to produce a solid profile, enjoyable by many. cheers!"
"Pours a chill hazed copper amber with a small almond head that leaves some patchy lacing. Aroma is malty toffee, spicy hops, and some apple skins. Medium body supports a low medium carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Taste is nicely balanced between the malty toffee and caramel and bitter spicy hops. Hints of red apple and mineral water add a tasty complexity. Very nice."
"There are so many different ales now available in America. I think this one is one of the better ones...Don't expect anything extreme, just a flavorful, full-bodied ale."
"From my Lakefront Variety 8-Pack. I was hoping to be underwhelmed by this variety pack because there's nothing worse than finding something you like in a trial pack and never being able to get it on a regular basis where you live. Case in point: Riverwest Stein Beer. Wow. Gorgeous deep copper in the glass with a nice head of foam that coated your face when you tried to drink it. Perfect carbonation and rich, soft creamy--emphasis on the soft creamy--mouthfeel. A nice malt/hops balance in the nose, but the taste is equally balanced, but dynamic at the same time. A touch of hops hits you first, then a rich, satisfying malt... then a solid hops spice kicks in to round out the flavor and provide a really nice tartness on the tongue. I think I said the word ""Wow"" out loud at least 3 times, pausing to look at the contents while draining the glass. Fantastic. And now I have to find a place where I can buy more than the trial back. How far is Milwaukee anyway?"
"D: A good highly sessionable brew. I am generally not a fan of amber ales but this one might have turned me."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one and was totally taken by surprise from a lager. It had the spiciness from hop and yeast that I've only had from an ale - one of the better BOTM picks I've received."
"Overally, pretty good. Easy to drink, nice overall flavor, and sufficient hops to give me a small fix."
"Went down easy."
"Drinkability: Smooth and fruity and buttery, lots of things going on and a good choice to keep in the fridge."
"Beer poured an amber color with a nice off white head that has sustaimed very well. Nose initially was very citrusy and has settled down to a nice malty, bready smell. Taste is very malty and bready but finishes with a slightly citusy hop. The aftertaste is classic lager. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with almost a full body. Drinkability is very good. This would make a great tailgait brew!"
"This is a great lager, one of the tastiest bottom-fermenting beers I've ever had. Highly recommended. A little crispness in the finish makes it easy to drink the whole bottle. Well done."
"brew from Lakefront. Good stuff."
"First I'd like to say that I'm not a fan of this style. Wth that said, what a great beer. A terrific, copper-colored beer with a nice white head. Sweet, clean taste with a good deal of hops for an amber lager. Melons and citrus in there too. This is a fresh, crisp beer that I could drink all day."
"My first beer from this brewery. It poured a copper color, that head a nice looking head at first, but then fades away into nothing. Smell was of milk, honey and a toasted grain character. Taste was pretty sharp and a bitter in the beginning, giving way to a sweeter presence in the end. I got some hops in the flavor, some tobacco, and grainy husk. Mouthfeel was medium. Drinkability was decent enough, although I wish I had some nice cheese to pair with this one. I have a feeling it would go well with some chevre. Not a bad beer as far as I can tell."
"good stuff!"
"Pours a strong, off white, thre finger head and some semi sticky lacing. The bubbling is strong for the style. Greeted with an Oktoberfest like deep amber. The aroma is a sweetmalt with notes of bread and butterscotch.A sweet buttered bread malt hits with a little hops in the finish that balances the sweetness alittle, but not enough. Mlaty sweet, chewy, yet tight palate. Definetly stayed in the center of the tongue."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very crisp and tangy. At the same time it's just a little creamy as well. Put that along with the excellent balance and I could see this thing being an excellent everyday drinker no matter what the conditions. I just hope everything from my sampler pack can match this brew."
"The bottle is very colorful and inviting...that being said; poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky, amber-orange color with a thin, creme colored head. The smell is a mix of amber/red malt and a touch of citrus. The taste actually has a bit more hops to it than I was expecting from an amber lager. It starts out slightly sweet, of amber malt, and quickly transitions to a pleasant bitterness that leaves a mouth dry and hoppy. Alcohol is only slightly detectable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer and definitely an enjoyable one."
"Appearance is a dark red-brown color with decent head formation. Aroma is a nice caramel malt and fruity hop balance. Flavor is also similarly balanced, with an assertive hop presence. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Quite good."
"Originally reviewed on August 10, 2006. 12 Oz Bottled Feb Wk3. Pour of hazed amber orange, fringes of tawny cantelope flesh. Oily fringe of white. Rich blow of aroma with freshly grated lemongrass, touches of savory tarragon and a hint of lime-tinged grains. Gentle alcohol glows. On the tongue, a fairly average but quite pleasing soft sweetness from barley esters and lemon water. Fleeting hpp dryness. Hints of rusty esters glow in the nose, alcohol detectabl. Toasted caramel corners and rising raspberry bubbles. Palate is coaxing, leaving a glistening dab of molasses on the tip of the tongue. Heavily drinkable. Hop balance in plain C is appreciated."
"Very well done Vienna."
"This is a pretty good beer, I do not think I could drink a six pack of it in one sitting, but I could definately have a bottle or two of it on a daily basis."
"Slightly hazy copper color. Low aroma of malt & lager yeast. Big malt flavor, not as subtel as imports. Medium body, rich carmel flavor marks it as an American brew. Finishes a bit sweet. Widely available in Milwaukee, a good standard beer. Less carmel falvor would make it more drinkable."
"This is a pretty filling beer, so after about 3 or 4 you might start to feel a little bit full, but this is a beer you'll definitely want to save room for."
"Drinkability: Great overall beer, leaves you wanting more. The high level of carbonation may fill you up quickly though."
"Too bad that I don't own a stein because Riverwest Stein Beer really should be drunk out of that particular vessel. It's a fine example of an often overlooked style and is easily the best Lakefront Brewery beer that I've had yet. Recommended."
"This little confection reminds me of an Oktoberfest in that it's not overly dark, has hints of roasted and toasted goodness and a smidge of sweetness to it. Nothing out of the ordinary or extraordinary. Just some ground up nuts and tree sap and fermentables. But seeing as I have nothing ""wise"" or ""witty"" to say about it it should be noted that I would recommend you tasting it but not buying stock in the company."
"Overall impression: Nice amber lager - very well balanced. Highly drinkable."
"Bottle notes that it is an ""all malt lager."" Moderately bitter, with no grainyness to the malt. Barest touch of caramel sweetness. Finish was a little weak, but not enough to be a detraction. Seemed like it could use a bit of beefing up to meet the amber lager category."
"Lakefront Riverwest Stein beer pours a hazy orange with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The smell is mostly malty. Taste is quite good, strong malty backbone with a good hoppy finish. Definitely better than I expected. Recommended."
"The moderate mouth has plenty of carbonation and dryness from the hops. I wish I had bought this as a sixer instead of a single. Very drinkable. The best AL I've ever had."
"Not bad. From the bottle the beer presents a reddish amber color (suprise, suprise) with a short lived head of foam. Medium level of carbonation, no lace. Aromas are mostly malt, some fermented grain. Taste is medium to full bodied, lots of malty goodness. Some hints of grain and earth, wood notes. Nice. Mouthfeel is nominal and rather uneventful. Drinkability is north of average. A good lager when something of the red variety strikes your fancy. Worth trying."
"Light mahogany/copper with minimal haze, thin head has little retention, appears somewhat flat. Aroma is weak as only a light caramel breadiness hits the nose, very macro-ish. The taste is much improved, caramel and brown sugar sweetness from the malt is initially present, balanced by a clean, tangy bitterness toward the finish. There is enough flavor here to keep me interested at least. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This was an easy to drink brew, perhaps sessionable for some, worth a try..."
"Clear coppery body with a good sized creamy head. A bit of lacing. Aroma is sweet with notes of toffee and bread. Quite malty. Taste follows suit. Lots of malts without much to cut them. Caramel runs strong and thick. A slight fruityness in the finish but it doesn't really cut off the malty caramel-like syrup texture. This tastes more like a Vienna Lager than anything else but it's not really that solid of an offering. I am surprised the abv was at 6%, seemed like it would be lower and maybe it should be. I will try this again and see if I get a different result but its really just average at best imo."
"This brew pours a clear deep ruby color. The head is one finger in height and recedes ever so slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is really amazing. Zesty, grapefruity, sweet, clean. Wow. The taste lives up to the aroma. zesty grapefruit without the backgroud haze that you would get in an ale. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth with good carbonation. Overall, this is a great, flavorful lager, and i will certainly buy this again."
"Drinkable beer that would work well a session quaffer or an apperitif to something stronger."
"This came with a big, white head that quickly subsided, leaving behind a good bit of sticky lace. It was a deep amber color with a light, slightly malty nose. The mouthfeel was light with a sharp, cheesy taste on the tongue. The finish was more hoppy than sweet. It was a decent beer, but I've had better, and from this brewery."
"-UF"
"Clear copper body, head is impressive, about 3/4"" with a slow fade. Lots of sweet carmel malts in the nose, some breadiness. Taste is also very smooth and malty, a very good hops kick is also present. Sweet breadiness pervades. What mroe do you want from an amber lager? Sweet, but not cloying, hops are way above average from the usual amber lager. I see no faults here, one of Lakefront's best beers."
"D-Although I only bought a single as a precautionary measure, I would happily keep this beer in the fridge."
"Pours a light golden amber with a finger of white bubbly head that coats the glass but leaves no lacing. Smell is floral and fruity for an amber lager. More flavorful than what I've come to expect from this style too. Sweet caramel malts, citrus/floral hops, a bit of musty/metallic off-flavor in the finish, but I find this in most lagers. Mouthfeel is full and coating, crisp but smooth carbonation. This is a tasty and extremely drinkable amber lager here. Lagers don't tend to blow my mind, but for an Ale guy, this is a tasty beer."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a brown color with a small head. Sweet malty aroma with just a little bit of an off sour smell. Rich malty flavor. The flavor is a little bubblegum-like. A nice fruity hoppiness prevents this beer from becoming too sweet. Mouthfeel is full for the style. Great drinkability. I didn't think I would like this beer after smelling it, but it tasted really good."
"Paired this with a grilled turkey tip salad with a mild feta cheese."
"It's an absolutely gorgeous, well, amber/red color. It's so alluring that my girlfriend is beginning to get jealous. Smells of lemons and prunes; in a good way though, I promise. Tastes fruity, tangy, and malty; it reminds me of both Lakefront's Klisch and Great Lakes' Dortmunder Gold. Very flavorful. Fucking good beer."
"Lush notes of toasty (even slightly roasty), nutty, mildly sweet and caramelish malt entice you in the flavor; accented by grassy and delicately citrusy hops. It starts more nutty and toasty, then becomes caramelish across the middle, and finally finishes dry with a zing of lightly sweet malt and hops. The bitterness and some toasty malt linger in the aftertaste, reminding you that you've just tasted some beer and need to taste some more! Very nicely done!"
"A sentimental favorite- based in my Mom's old neighborhood; originally out of a storefront bakery. Good people."
"Poured into a pint glass. Bottle had a first week of March date on the label. Has a nice ruby, tan color with a decent head and lacing. Lots of carmel maltiness with some flowery hops in the background in the nose. Lots of carmel comes through in the taste with not enough hops to balance it out. The mouthfeel is way to sweet for me to have more than one. No real faults but I could not sit down and have one after another."
"This really reminds me more of a Vienna Lager or Bock than anything, which semantically speaking are amber lagers, so I guess Lakefront isn't wrong, but they aren't completely descriptive either. This beer packs a lot of flavor..as such despite being tasty and smooth, I would have a hard time drinking more than 2 of these as they are very rich to my palette. Still, quite tasty stuff."
"Clear, ruby-brown with coppery-tawny influences. The color is lovely. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was less than a ¼ of an inch in height. Head retention was poor; it faded quickly to a thin collar. The subsequent lacing was clumpy, spotty, and it wasnt very widespread. Overall it is an attractive beer. The nose is clean, sharp, toasty with caramel notes and traces of earthiness. Light nutty aromas. The potency was low. It is simple smelling. It fails to say much. I detected no off-flavors but there isnt anything to get excited over. Apathetic. The palate is nice. It is improved over the nose, mainly because the flavors are louder. Thankfully the hops are clear, softly bitter with a nice earthy taste. Malt sweetness is well placed; it is rich within its boarders. Caramel mainly with hints of toasty grain. I like the palate. It is very clean, very simple, and straightforward. I have no complaints. The flavor profile of this beer reminds me of SA Boston Lager. A firm, medium in body with solid carbonation, of all the Lakefront beers Ive had this one has the best mouthfeel. All of the others Ive sampled were lacking in carbonation and body. In this case the mouthfeel is fitting for this beer. Drinkable. I bet it would be good with pizza or a grilled ham sandwich. Id love this beer if the aftertaste were sharper; it falls apart a bit and becomes muddled. Id buy a six-pack of this in the future. While it is nothing special it was good enough to stay on my radar. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" of beige head over the dark amber brew. Head is dense and not going awhere too fast, and lacing is average to good. Aroma is malty biscuits, with a tinge of hops. Taste is malty, with a sedate yet intensifying hops character. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is excellent. This beer was made for sessioning."
"This beer is a nice clear amber with a small white head. The head does not stick around very long. There is a strong smell of malt and hops. There is a lot of flavor. The taste is good, malty with a slight hop bitterness and mild aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, and it is very drinkable."
"Pours a lovely mahogany color with a tight laced cream colored head that seems to want to curl up on the sides of the glass. Carbonation is there.. but not overruly. Smells very sweet.. apricots?? maybe..and a light hint of alcohol.. lots of subtle undertones, hard to describe.. The taste leans into the same apricot taste but not as sweet as it smells, here comes the hint on hops and the aftertaste fails to go bitter. An interesting beer, good but very hard to describe. We'll suffice to say that its drinkable."
"Dark copper-red with a glass-coating, off-white head. Smells of rich cookie dough malt, and a touch of spicy German hops. Taste starts off with the sweet cookie dough malts, followed by some roasty, burnt caramel. Nice. Hops are minimal, but balance the sweetness. Finish is a tad bitter with lingering cookie malt. Medium-bodied, yet surpisingly chewy. One of the best amber lagers I've had."
"Sampled at the Great Taste. Dark copper in color, with little off white head. Complex malty aroma, sweet, roasted, breadlike, with a little yeast in the background. Good bitterness yet still malt is key here. Finishes clean but not overly dry. This is a beer I could drink all night."
"Drinkability: nice balance. light to medium body makes for an easy drinker. very good beer without trying to hard."
"Sampled 5/1/04"
"12 ounce bottle, thanks to Skidz and BIF10. Bottle during Wk2 Wk3 Jan."
"A яedksi Na-Zdravi Komrade to BiKHugeski for this one."
"Not a bad little lager. It's unfiltered and cloudy, which is interesting for a lager. The head is nice and lingering and leaves a nice lace. Constant cascading bubbles catch the eye. A little watery up front, but a nice toasted malt in the back with a touch of caramel sweetness. I'd really like to take this beer and punch it up with a nice spicy kick of some noble hops like saaz."
"Drinkability: Better than average. I would enjoy a 1L stein of this beer, for sure. Easy drinking, yet has enough body and character to satisfy those looking for a good, German-style darkish lager."
"Clear copper appearance. Pale head, slightly wanting and settling to a skim early. Nice ropy ring laces, however. Light apple skin aroma, honeyish tones as well. Caramel in its purest form makes up the initial taste, matched well by good moderate carbonation and a light but pleasant mouthfeel. Good balancing hop snap to the finish, in the style of Hallertau. Futher sips reveal a touch of popcorn buttery diacetyl, works well in its moderation. A very drinkable beer here, one of the best I've had from Lakefront, which seems to shine in Lager-style brews."
"Medium body with gentle, tingly carbonation. Extremely easy to drink and a beer that definitely leaves you begging for more. A well done lager."
"Ruddy bronze hue, with a slight murk. One fingered, compact, light beige head yields frothy tattered lace. Gentle toasted grain bolstered by stately medium lovibond caramalt, with an herbal hop tinge in aroma. Agreeably mellow caramelized nut impression adds richness. Clean, and pleasantly understated aromawise. Toffee driven sweetness incipient in flavor is contrasted by a tepid combination of toasted malt and hop derived bitterness. Subtle coupling of softly floral and sweetly herbal hop flavors complement and add a trace chlorophyll like, leafy twang. Lean in overall body, but aptly dexrinous and suitably fluid for frictionless quaffing. Mild notes of singed, candied nuts emerge late, building on and extending the well executed malt and hop balance. Finishes nearly squeaky clean, with fleeting toasty hints of Munich and caramel malt sweetness. Unexpected, bock like alcohol warmth surfaces after a pause, belying the apparent refreshing nature of this brew. Riverwest is a superbly drinkable and balanced brew, with a simple, innocuous malt and hop character. I could (and will) go through a lot of these..."
"In my opinion, this brew makes a good session beer. It's certainly not outstanding, but very drinkable"
"Poured dark amberish, small head aroma was slightly hoppy, with fruit traces,a nice full hop taste, a slightly thick texture, a little oily on the tongue. It faded into a pleasing malt taste with just a little bitterness the rest of the way. Pleasantly complex and satisfying"
"Since I moved away from Milwaukee, I had forgotten how wonderful a brewery Lakefront is...I will forget no longer."
"Great texture right up front, and a very mellow mouthfeel. Little hops, but substantially malty. That's what this beauty is all about, and it delivers a fantastic, rewarding taste all the way through. Rich, tasty, lush, warm and friendly, full in body, this is a malty masterpiece. Just a perfect lager in every respect, never, ever lacking in flavor."
"Thanks jeffboo, big time!"
"Acquired via trade. People seem to compare this one with Great Lakes' Eliot Ness but it's not exactly a photo finish in my book. Pours a very clear amber color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is malty and a little nutty. Flavor did not have as much rich malt character as I would have liked, but it is easy to drink. There are enough hops in the finish to keep it interesting. I'd get this again but Mr. Ness is still Untouchable as far as I am concerned."
"Bright glowing amber in color, nice frothy head that cling to my glass. Light caremel malty aroma, flavors of sweet caramel, very balanced, smooth clean finish, great for the vienna style, great session brew."
"Named after an eclectic neighborhood on Milwaukee's near northwest side, west of the Milwaukee River.  Pours a dark ruby-brown with a thin light cream colored head.  Aroma is of sweet malt and caramel.  Thin body, but rich in flavor.  Malty midtones and sweet finish.  Roasted barley adds a nice toasted taste.  Beer's true flavor is unleashed as it warms slighty."
"River West Stein:  Nice looking reddish orange, little head, but nice lace. Spicy aroma, and well malted taste.  Chocolate/cocoa tastes, with just a hint of coffee.  This is a very complex beer in terms of malt profile.  Nicely balanced with a spray of hops toward the end.  Light bodied, and easy to drink, but with a slightly high alcohol level for a lager.  Not bad, not bad at all."
"One of my favorites."
"Here's a beer I could get into...(say several pitchers into)..Copper in color....very small white lace...soft malt/bready nose...the taste has a nice malt profile similar to a red ale...slightly on the sweet side but the hop balance keeps it from being overwhelming...it is not hoppy at all, but the hops do their work in balancing this excellent malty beer....finishes dry and tight....solid.."
"This is a beautiful looking brew.  Clear deep scarlet color with a 1 inch creamy tan head.  There's a nice refined malt aroma with a hop dryness apparant.  Wonderful vienna like malt presence on the palate.  This is a hearty malty brew.  I would choose this beer over most of the multitude of Oktoberfest brews that come out in September.  A subdued spicy character and a great drying on the finish as the balanced hop load clean of the palate."
