"I've had beers with honey in them before that are decent, but I can't recommend this beer. It's just dull and not all that enjoyable."
"It is not horrible, but I would not buy it again. I would probably turn it down even it was offered for free."
"D - Yeah, I can drink this. This is an interesting variation on honey beer. I wouldn't drink a lot of it, but it's a nice change of pace."
"d- i actually enjoy a sixer of these on occasion"
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is grainy.Taste is a macro with honey sweetness.Pretty smooth and refreshing a perfect beer for a summer day.Overall a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing.This is something I would recommend and purchase again."
"D: Well done and reasonably balanced. Great for what it is, a sort of gateway brew. Nice and drinkable and, actually, pretty damn fair."
"Drinks terrible. Drainpour. I got a third of the way through it and realized I had other beers in the fridge, so why waste precious seconds of my life consuming this beer. ""Swill"" would be a complement."
"Golden and transparent. Paper thin head sticks around about as long as a leaf in a hurricane. Smells of bread grains and rice. Tastes of white bread, rice and an artifical honey sweetness. The small amount of sweet flavor is enough to vastly overpower any hints of bitterness present in this beer. Light and watery in feel, lots of bubbles. Not a brew I would drink often. Very little flavor or complexity."
"Sampled on October 11, 2010. The pour is fairly typical for a honey ale with an orange tone and a short-lasting fizzy white head that bubbles to nothing. The aroma is full of honey and malts. The taste is about the same. There is nothing special going on here."
"Atmosphere is okay. Nothing special in terms of appearance or nose. Flavor follows suit. A bit a bittersweet palette. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
"overall another i will have to pass on, just not doing it for me at all."
"Taste, goes downhill quick, funny aftertaste from whatever honey they are using, doesn't do well with the high carbonation, just a fizzy honey aftertaste and corn left over. A neat beer to smell, but not much else going on here noteworthy."
"Overall: A missed opportunity. A little less sweetness would make this enjoyable."
"Not a bad honey lager - it tastes like, well, honey, which also provides the benefit of distracting from the otherwise mediocre amber lager underlying things. For all the weak-ass honey ales/lagers that I've had over the years that hardly have a whiff of honey essence and sweetness to them, now I get (pretty close to) the real deal from AB? Will wonders never cease?"
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is honey with some grain notes. The flavor is heavy on the honey but I also get some banana and grain. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not great, but not terrible."
"m/d- way carbonated, so, that kills the mouthfeel, but its light so its easy to drink."
"so guys if ur wife.girlfriend.other does not really enjoy beer give this one a shot,,,,"
"Duh."
"A good beer for those afraid of beer."
"This is my unsung hero of the year. The only question I have is: Have I allowed the other reviews to cause me to underestimate the beer? There is nothing wrong with this beer other that being a BMC, get over it!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a crystal clear dark gold with a thin white head on top. Leaves some spotty lacing. Smells like honey, syrup, and some grains. The mouth is crisp and easily drinkable. Carbonation level is decent. Wow. This is a really sweet beer! Tons of honey-sweetnes, puckering candy sweet. Not much for beer-flavor in this one. No hops, no grains, nothing. Not my thing."
"The Michelob brand is capable of making solid beers, but did not do so here."
"Fail, will not drink again!"
"An absolute chore, and I think I'm giving up."
"This beer has a deep golden clear honey color. I get the impression they used artifical coloring to make looks as much like honey as possible. Smell is overwhelmingly sweet honey with a few floral characteristics. The sweetness is the dominant force though. This is undrinkable. It tastes as if someone took a bottle of michelob, poured a third of it out, filled the bottle with honey and put the cap back on. That's probably not too far from the truth. It just horrible sticky disgusting sweet and nothing else. Avoid it like grim death."
"God, what a waste of perfectly good honey."
"the after taste is where the honey is most notable. it basically feels like your tongue is covered in a thin layer of it. very sweet. it has a very nice appearance an head. id probably drink it again but a bit to sweet for something to drink regularly"
"When poured was a nice dark golden color with a nice head. That is about as good as it gets. The smellwas nothing special, a slight hint of honey. If you like to taste beer in your beer, this is not for you. It is very sweet with an overpowering taste of honey in it. It left much to be desired."
"GOD BLESS AMERICA !!!"
"Notes - Nothing special just a slightly sweet lager. Mouthfeel was good. The bottle has ""Beer with Honey"" printed on it and I would have preferred a little more beer."
"Tastes really good with parmesan cheese"
"D - If you don't mind sugary beers, you'll love this. It's definitely a little too sweet to be easily drinkable."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this beer just didn't do much for me, it is not one that I would drink again."
"Being a 20-year honeymead drinker/brewer, I have some experience with this kind of beer. The Michelob Honey Lager is slightly darker gold and a tiny bit thicker than a standard lager, which adds to the mouthfeel. The honey in the aroma is noticeable but not as overwhelming as some suggest. Nor is the taste dominated by the honey stored within. Sure, it's a bit sweet but also kinda malty and has a light backtaste of hops and a hint of fresh corn. I think the honey flattens the head, but it's a small price to pay for the overall taste. I enjoy it."
"Bleh. not good. I'm glad this is the final beer from the 6 pack."
"A decent lager with a ""fruit"" flavor added."
"Not bad but the honey is too much here. Where's the lager part?"
"D 3.0 - A bit sweet for my taste in a cloying overly done honey fashion - but almost good."
"Too much honey without substance, though there is a slight touch of caramel and light, vague hops - along the ""macro"" line. Not bad for someone who wants a beer with a heavy hand of honey (and not much else). Honey lingers for an almost annoyingly long time."
"This is a pretty low score from me but I just don't like it."
"D - Honey Lager certainly won't knock anyone's socks off, there's simply not enough flavor or complexity going on. It is however an easy drinking beer. Forgettable at best but a passable intro to the uninitiated."
"D--Goes down easy, but how many beer sugar bombs are you interested in?"
"I don't know whether the target consumers drink Michelob or if they are craft beer drinkers looking for something cheaper than their usual buys. Whoever they are, Michelob probably won't get them."
"This beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of faint bready malt and nothing else. The taste is of bready malt too...more than the aroma with a hint of honey in the finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with carbonation that is too high, and gets in the way of tasting the beer. Overall, this beer is decent at best, and I can't see myself drinking it again."
"used to drink the hell out of this stuff on the cusp of my micro-evolution...yet another single picked up in Hampton"
"Wow, it's been awhile since I've had a really bad beer, but this one fit the bill. Pours a golden color with a bit of a glow almost. Not much of a head, a little sticky lacing. Sweet - very sweet with a strong honey flavor. It's almost like they just took some raw honey and stirred it in to sweeten the beer. The problem is that there's nothing to balance the sweetness, hops are virtually nonexistent. Real hard to get through a bottle of this."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a gold/amber color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The head was one finger thick, bright white and retained ok as a skim but laced very well. The aroma was very much of macro mashed-grain and a little artificial sweetness. The flavors were similar, basic Michelob beer with a little added pale malt sweetness and something syrupy that wanted to be honey ,but wasn't. Blah. Bad aftertaste that lingered, a nail in the coffin. The mouthfeel was good but the carb too high and the body watery. Thumbs down."
"It has a fizzy gold body leading to an off-white head. The head wasn't that impressive but the lace was nice. It has a two-tone body it gets darker towards the top once things start to settle. It smells mainly sweet a little bit of honey but mostly adjunct and malt. The taste is also somewhat adjunct as well but not bad overall. The after taste is really sweet and honey like. There is a little bitterness and it is a light bodied beer."
"Taste is way sweet, almost cloying. Mouthfeel is actually pretty good on this one.Finishes on the sweet side."
"If you want a sweet brew stick with a Wee Heavy, or possibly a Dopplebock. This light lagers infused with flavors are horrible."
"I'm willing to give Anheuser-Busch props when they deserve them. Michelob Honey Lager is deserving of nothing but scorn. Even though it doesn't taste like them, this is beer for those who think that Fruity Pebbles are the ultimate in breakfast cereal. Two thumbs waaay down."
"Light bodied, and easy to drink. A nice beginning beer for any BMC drinker looking to step it up a notch."
"Bottle.Pours golden and clear with less than a one finger head it had some decent lacing and head retention. The aroma was sugary/honey sweet with possibly some corn? The taste was sickly sweet from first sip to finish. The beer was medium bodied, smooth but not very easy to drink.Did not detect any hops at all,a good dose of them may have helped out a bit here."
"I thought that honey might mike this beer a little more enjoyable. In reality, it just adds an off anrtificial flavor to an already bad experience. The same yellow color and no head. The nose and taste are all stale rice. Watery body does not drink well at all."
"Overall: macro with honey"
"D: Pretty drinkable, if it was less sweet maybe a bit more drinkable."
"Drinkablity: A lighter beer that has a good, sweet backbone. Refreshing and satisfying."
"This is a good summertime beer and I think it's underrated being that it's an AB product."
"Pours a golden color with a thin white head. A definite sweet honey taste. It is light-bodied with honey, corn and a grainy, malty mix. It's not bad for a Michelob and somewhat refreshing and clean. Still, this is not a whole lot better than standard swill."
"Blast from the past, I came across this on tap last weekend up in Cleveland and had to order one since I haven't come across it in years. I used to work in a beer truck at an outdoor concert center and this was on tap along with regular Michelob. It was decent back in the day, and is still alright in my book. Faint aroma with a sweet honey scent. Pour is so-so, lack of a decent head and lacing knock it below average. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Flavor is quenching with the basic Michelob/Bud grainy malt but with a good touch of sweet honey."
"drinkability - This thing is nasty. I'm open minded and thoguht it would be good stuff. Watery, light, has a wiered after taste that after drinkking half of it, I feel like pouring it out."
"Drinkability: Not a terrible ride for the one bottle, though I'd be pretty loathe to accept an entire six-pack."
"D : Drainpour. I wouldn't touch this one again."
"Pours a clear amber with rocky white head. Retention is ok but lacing is more or less absent. Smell: Michelob + honey... honey, grain, slight presence of pale malt and boiled hop. Taste: astringent grain, euro-lager skunk character, finishes with honey sweetness that overwhelms a hint of hops. Mouthfeel: very thin but sticky sweet. Too one-sidedly sweet and a bit watery, not interested in another."
"D - Poor. This is really a mess."
"D - This is not a bad macro lager. I purchased it alot in college because my girlfriend would actually drink it. But I picked some up recently and it is still a good session beer."
"Michelob Honey Lager pours a typical lager yellow with a white head that fades quickly. I don't mind the aroma, sweet, honey like I guess. Very fizzy and very sweet. If there are hops in this I don't taste them. Not the worst macro I've had, I could probably drink a couple."
"Sample at AleFest Dayton: Pale gold color with a thin white head with poor retention. Spotty lacing. Sweet aroma of honey and a hint of malt. Light-bodied with a flavor differentiated from the normal Michelob only by the added honey. It actually seems more like an afterthought than a concerted effort at creating something new. The finish is bland and mildly sweet. Not worth coming back to."
"The sweetness (without a balance) would do me in after two, but as a single shot it's alright, especially for a hot day."
"Low drinkability. I don't even think I'm going to bother to finish this bottle. Life is too short."
"This beer pours a light honeyish color with a small fizzy head. Aroma was strong on the honey flavors along with some pale malt. Taste follows aroma. Really sweet with honey being prevalent. I like that flavor better than corn or rice, which is what one usually finds with macros, but its still nothing special. Lacks complexity and balance. Cloying after a few sips. Very similar to Dundee's honey offering. I wouldn't turn this down but I don't think I'm going to pay for another."
"Michelob makes a decent beer for the price per bottle and scale or production. This beer was ok. It had a very golden color and on the pour had a bubbly head which went away as fast as I poured it. Aroma was typical of a macro lager with a bit of a sweet aroma. Tasted like a lager with honey in it. Overall, this was an ok beer that I would not buy on its own, but you can't say you don't like it without trying it."
"Nice slightly orange-yellow-gold color, very clear, decent head. Aroma is fairly clean, plain, non-descript...it has maybe a hint of a honey character (sort of like a lightly floral scent) but just barely, not impressive but not offensive either. The flavor is not bad at all - if this is an American macro lager ala regular michelob its got it beat hands down, much more malt character and also some honey sweetness that is a tad cloying but not too much (certainly not more than a lot of Big beers and big beer styles), and does have some balancing hop flavor and bitterness although its clearly on the malt side of the balance. I think this beer probably had honey added after pasteurization or filtering - most honey beers get honey sweetness attenuated by the yeast, or certainly the homebrews I've made and consumed have been. So, maybe its kind of cheating but hey I think it works OK. This is another sample from the holiday pack, which I think overall is pretty good for a macro brewery. If they'd dump the mich regular and use that all-malt michelob from a few years back it would be a much better package to me."
"Enters the mouth soft and zesty but with almost no honey noticeable as I would have expected. Maybe a hint of vanilla silk on the mouthfeel twords the end of the palate. Overall drinkable with a decent mouthfeel but not interesting at all."
"As with most beers fermented with honey, you dont really get a honey flavor, but instead, you encounter a light, fruity malt flavor. And while most beers fermented with honey have this pleasant quality, as this one does, this beer just doesnt have much else going on to make it all that interesting. Not really recommended."
"Michelob Honey Lager, poured into a chalice glass, is a golden-amber beer with a light topping of foam. Aroma is typical mass-produced lager, mostly grainy malt, without any honey scent I can find. Flavor is mostly sweet grain, with a lot of fruitiness in the middle. Somewhat surprising in fact, with an apple-like fruit roundness. Finishes moderately clean, with a medium-light body."
"Not a bad beer, not necessarily a good one either. A solid attempt perhaps and I'll bet something that my non-beer geek friends would call ""good""."
"Drinkability: The artificial sweetness is only detrimental to this beer; it doesn't taste like honey, but almost like someone threw an Equal packet into Michelob lager. I wanted to like this, I really did. But I can't, I just can't."
"Overall: Unimpressive to the point of being almost bad."
"Nice clean head. Easy Drinkability. This is a great beer for hot wings or any other of your favorite spicey foods. I found this beer one of the best I have enjoyed in a long time. It's totally Bitchin'. I wish I could buy this beer all the time. I Love Honey Beer!!!!"
"To finish this review and try to be fair I finished the beer, but really wanted to just dump it out. I'll probably throw out the one I have left rather than suffer through another one."
"Light bodied, mild, honey flavored brew, smooth enough, slightly sweet but balanced with just a bit of hops at the finish.."
"Sampled at local beer store. Poured a moderate amber color with white head. Smeel is sweetish with hints of honey. Taste is good at first but the sweetness becomes too much after after several sips. Left a sticky feeling in the mouth. Glad it was a sample."
"Overall impression: No off flavors, and the honey does add a nice touch, but this was too sweet for me."
"Pours a transparent bronze color with an airy, white head that dissipates very quickly. The aroma is of sweet malts and honey. The taste is quite sweet, and almost too much like some sort of artificial honey syrup flavoring. There is a hint of bitterness at first taste, which adds a little kick to the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and flat. It almost has a syrupy feel to it. Its desperate for more carbonation. After a couple of these, the slimey uncarbonated mouthfeel becomes very unattractive."
"this was a suprise. i was expecting much much sweeter. THis beer was about right as far as the sweetness meter goes. Other than that it did have a pretty good flavor. but the sweetness was definetly the centerpiece. Overall looked normal, smelt sweet, tasted slightly sweet. finished with a honyesk aftertaste."
"Michelob's Honey Lager delivers a clear, deep golden body capped by an average-sized head of white foam that drops shortly but maintains a thin surface covering, and leaves some nice lace before it goes. The nose is welcoming with a disctinctly sweet, honey flavor and some malt. There's no hop presence to speak of, but that's to be expected for the style. Surprisingly dextrinous in the mouth, it's creamy and smooth with a medium body and delicate carbonation that gently bristles the tongue. The flavor is sweet and honeyish as well, but it's not overdone; and there's enough bitterness there to pull it into a drying finish, and keep it from becoming cloying. Well done!"
"I approached this one with mixed feelings: Ive liked some of the new Michelob brews, but most honey flavored beers seem to fall short in many aspects. This brew is decidedly in the latter camp. It pours a crystal clear golden color with a fizzy, unappealing head. The aroma is faint grain and a little honeymaybe a bit of a cooked corn smell as well. The taste is almost unbearably sweet. Syrupy and cloying. Now, I enjoy a sweet mead occasionally, but this didnt have the deep honey flavor of a mead. Instead, its a sugary, unbearable, sticky sweetness. This beer was not for me at all!"
"in my opinion this is worth a try at least and is fairly underrated. i think that just because AB puts it out, people are biased against it but it is really a decent beer and is worth a try. definitely one of AB's best."
"Well what can I say? It's beer and honey flavored water. Slight head, but not worth speaking of, this one is made to be drunk from the bottle. All in all what you would expect from Michelob, low quality beer at a very affordable price. A beer for people who don't like beer, it has almost no flavor, but without the perks of flavorless light beers as it is loaded with carbs. Not offensive, but not worth touching."
"Almost horrible, too much like sugar water. I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these. Feels like I'm rotting my teeth."
"Tasted: 12/19/04"
"overall, a horrible beer. I think it is physically impossible for me to finish a sixer in a night if i tried. way to sweet with no other flavor."
"This is fairly one-dimensional, mundane stuff. So far, I don't think I've found a honey beer that I really liked. Appearance is honey golden, head is below average-sized. Smell has a generic sweet smell, mainly malts with a touch of honey. Taste is sweet honey and some malts, not too strong, but very one-dimensional. This gets old fairly quick. Drinkability isn't too bad, but could be a lot better if this had a little more character. Not something I'll pick up again."
"Reflection: This is another good example why I don't buy anything from A.B."
"Cheers!"
"I'll finish the other 5 bottles in a frozen mug, to deaden my taste buds. Won't be coming back to this."
"The beer pours a very transluscent golden color with a 2 finger head that sticks around longer than most others from the macro companies. The beer smells honey sweet without much more coming through. Most of the flavor also comes from the honey. It's just a little too much in the foreground for my liking. The beer is moderately thick in my mouth. Rather surprising from for a maro offering. This is an easy beer to drink, but because it's so sweet, I couldn't do more than a few. Not a bad offerng, but still a macro beer."
"Drinkability - I gotta be in a mood, but I could drink a few of these."
"Im going to against everything I have ever said about Michelob. I hate Michelob, but I figured I try out their honey lager because Im a huge fan of honey beers, wines and all most anything with honey it. I wasnt expecting all that much and here it turned out to be probably one of my favorite honey beers. I feel that it puts Honey Brown to shame and I love Honey Brown. This beer has a decent golden color to it, aroma is mild with the sent of honey floating about it. You can expect the average North American lager taste that you get from most big name brews, kind of plain, not much malt flavor or much hops, nothing to great but they but in the right amount of honey to make it good. As for its head it really isnt there at all but at this point I dont care. I feel that this beer was well done."
"Drinkability: Can't drink too many of these because they are so sweet. Ok for about one or two but that is it."
"Looks better than it is, just too sweet to be palatable. I couldn't even finish one. I don't think all that sweetness can just be from honey, unless it wasn't alowed to completely ferment."
"Appearance: Honey golden amber tone with a decent sized silky white head leaves behind some scanty lacing. Aroma: Label claims all malt, this maybe but it's a mild biscuit malt sweetness blended with honey sweetness this one's not bad some very light hopping. Taste: It's not off to me just honey trace throught it with some light bready malt sweetness finishing hops to balance not horrible. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied not too impressed with this aspect and quite overcarbonated. Drinkability: Well, not a staple but the best of the Michelob sampler in my opinion, refreshing and strangely not bad."
"From a sampler box I bought mostly for the two included glasses, and to pacify the manager of a local beer store that is trying to get her distributor to find something more exotic than Heineken and Sam Adams. Pours a clear golden amber, off-white head disappears in seconds. Nose is honey sweet, maybe a faint hint of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is sweet, slightly carbonated. Taste is sweet honey,not much else. No lacing is evident as the glass empties. Not much here to balance the honey sweetness. Syrupy aftertaste doesn't improve my opinion of this mediocre offering."
"The beer pours a golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is average. It has lager characteristics, but it has a sweetness to it from the addition of honey. It makes the aroma a little more complex enjoyable. The taste is good. It has the flavor of a macro-lager, but the honey mellows it out and adds a nice sweet flavor. The mouthfeel is good. This is a medium bodied beer with a average amount of carbonation. It drinks well. This is a good beer for the money, macro or not."
"Drinkability: A noble effort, but not sure what style this is. A disappointing part of the sampler pack."
"Pours a bright looking gold color. That is where the positives end. Sweet and funky tasting that made me hold back my gag reflex. I guess honey is not supposed to be in beer (see Leinie's HoneyWeiss). Drinking this beer was not a very pleasant experience. I cannot recommend anyone buying this beer for anything except practical jokes."
"Poured a golden amber with no head - went straight to lace. Smell has some pale malts behind it, maybe a little citrus there? Either way, it's hard to get a good whiff of this beer. The taste isn't too bad, but not exciting - weird honey-like flavor at the beginning, and a light malt finish. Mouthfeel is pretty interesting - very effervescent despite the lack of head, tingles on the tip of the tongue. Decent drinkability, but I dunno about 2 in a row - too bland."
"Yikes. An A.B. beer that is drinkable! (Just) It DOES look a little like apple juice. And it definitely contains a honey sweetness. But, hey, on a hot day, I wouldn't kick it out of the fridge...the taste is acceptably good. The initial beer taste is subsumed in the sweetness which is not overwhelming. In fact, there are bitter elements that linger. A lot of times when I have an particularly bad or too bitter beer to dispose of, I will (please: no one panic!) mix some Honey Lager in, and end up with something a lot more palatable. Or to produce the result I am looking for but can't find in one beer. Try: my recipe: 1 part Bass Ale, 1 part Honey Lager, 2 parts Samuel Adams Boston Lager = perfection!"
"This beer pours a light amber color with a creamy head that dies off quickly and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma was sweet, as expected with honey. Nothing much else in the nose. The flavor was not one of my favorites. It was sweet, but very bitter at the same time. I really didn't enjoy this beer very much."
"Poured a glowing golden - and by ""glowing"" I mean it had an odd, chemical reaction brightness - or at least it struck me that way. Nice tight fluffy head. Lightly sweet malt aroma. Initial taste was a sweetness with bittersweetness floating on top. Dried at the finish with a powdery mouthfeel, but then crept back with an odd, oily slickness. As the beer warmed, an artificial sweetener aspect became pronounced, as did the oily finish. A lot going on in this beer, but little of it enjoyable."
"Alright. This has got to be the most peculiar beer I have ever had. Ever. It pours a nice darker golden colour, almost like apple juice, and the smell is quite nice, too. The taste is actually quite good. When it first gets into your mouth, it immediately tastes of beer, (which it should), but quickly it turns sweet. Quite sweet in fact and one can most definately tell that honey was indeed involved in the production of this brew. I saw where one fellow wrote in his review that this stuff leaves a peculiar, but pleasant, after taste in ones mouth and I must say I'd have to agree with that. I really like this brew, even though it is quite strange, sweeter than most people seem to enjoy (I gave it 3.0 because of its sweetness in drinkability), and, as much as I hate to say it, it comes from AnheuserBusch. 'Tis a day of great shame, for I have spoken praise to A&B."
"Bright deep gold color, creamy short term head that quickly becomes large bubbles and then fades. Smells of apple and adjunct, I can't detect any honey in the nose. First impression is of one dimensional sweetness. No bitterness, but is lightly sharp from the carbonation. Not much to taste except the sweetness. Quite a disgusting beer, I must admit that I threw it out. Tastes like a macro with a tablespoon of sugar added."
"This brew pours a nice white head of small bubbles and leaves behind a nice lacing as it recedes. It has an aroma of honey and some malt. I rather like the taste of this brew for the money. It has a nice honey malty flavor and is very smooth. There is a mild aftertaste that leaves a nice flavor in your mouth. All in all, it is a good all-round drinking beer. I just wish I could get it more when I go out."
"Tasted faily sweet but not too bad, it even had an after taste of banannas which I found really interesting. I'm not saying we should call this a ""Banana-weisen"" ;) but for a hot afternoon grilling, it was good."
"Taste is slick and sweet for sure. Lots of honey flavors, front and back. Famialer AB cornwater taste as well. No hops at all. None. A touch more pleasing than I anticipated though. Slick, sweet finish. Nearly syrupy, not to be guzzled but it did okay against Bud, Budlight, and Miller Lite on tap."
"Pours typical yellow, decent carbonation. Only a slight head. The smell is sweet and inviting. Taste is sweet, but not overpoweringly so. You get the honey taste pretty strong, so any malt is hidden. Hops are decent. Finishes with a sweet honey aftertaste. I don't like honey brews, and this hasn't changed my opinion."
"Leftover from the Ales and Lagers Winter 12 pack. Pours a straw color, with thin carbonation, the thin head disseminates rapidly. Very faint honey and grainy smell. The honey taste stays throughout with somewhat of a bad syrup feel left on the palate. The idea is right, a decent balance of the honey, but a bit tough to drink; however, might be one of the better Michelob brews, still . . ."
"I dont know why I try all these odd flavored beers. This pours a dark gold with a fast fading head which turns to a lace. The aroma of honey is there, not much of anything else. The taste has a bit malt but is over ran with honey, a bit too much for me. I would like a slight hint of it. Not bad but nothing that I would drink again."
"Pour this hard and you get a get head, there isn't a lot of carbonation. Leaves a lace. Pale orange color and a faint honey nose. Very light bodied but better than a Mic lager. Very definite taste of honey and finishes with smooth malt/honey flavor. The ABV is 4.9%."
"This is an alright brew for the style. It pours a golden color with slight reddish hue and a creamy head that thins to short layer. It smells like honey with a light hoppy aroma. The one thing I do not much care for is how sweet it is. I know that honey be is supposed to be sweet but this is just a little too much for my tastes. It has some carbonation in the mouthfeel but still goes down fairly smooth. This is just an average beer for this style."
"Deep amber colored body is topped by a rather thick, white head. This beer displays excellent head retention for an american macro. The aroma is strong on honey, with a touch of fruity hops. Again, pleasing, especially from AB. The taste of honey hits you inmmediately upon the first sip. It almost reminds me of a blueberry honey taste. Different, but good. Nice malt background with a touch of hops in the finish. The honey sweetness is not balanced all that well with the rest of the flavors. The mouthfeel is rich and a little thick, leaving a thin, syrupy cating on the tongue. Residual sweetness lags behind, again betraying the unbalanced honey and perhaps a lack of bittering hops. Drinakbility is hurt by the cloying sweetness the honey creates. A decent beer from AB, but an overly liberal use (waste?) of honey."
"This is a good beer, as far as mainstream Honey beers go. I enjoy this one and it's sweetness. It's sweet, yet dark, so the combonation is a good one. It had a nice dark color to it, with a short lived light brown head. Had a very strong honey taste at first and finnished with it. I could see it getting too sweet for some, but I really enjoyed it. Finnishes smooth and delivers satisfaction."
"A nice sweet change of pace on occasion and my favorite out of the sampler....If you like sweet beers give it a shot you might like it...If not stay away because it is overdone...kind of like a sweet can of fruit punch or something like that...."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a twist off crown; served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability could be an issue as the sweetness here could catch up with desire to quaff this particular product in abundance....."
"Pours an ultra clear golden/orange with a tiny, I mean TINY white head that all but completely disappeared. The smell is a very faint fresh bread smell that is lightly sweet. The taste of honey is very, very apparent in this beer. Almost overwhelmingly so. Whew!...this thing is sweet tasting with a carb bite and nothing else can get past the honey. Strange tasting at best. For a company that's normally scared to use flavor, they went ""flip-side"" on the honey here! They just don't understand if you have bold flavor, you have to provide some type of complexity to it to counter balance things. Very light bodied and oh so sweet (not in a good way). Not very drinkable at all in fact I struggled through 12 ounces of this stuff. Cheers!"
"I also was surprised by thisone for I have not found a Honey ive liked yet, until now! My rate #'s are up for that reason. A pure gold' clear honey color with a white puff short-lived head.Somewhat medium lace. Aroma is kinda grainy ( beerlike rather than honey on the nose ). Very AB smooth mouthfeel.Leaves the mouth alittle dry. Taste is more of a caramel sweet than an overdone honey sweet. Beleave it or not, this is my best honey and perhaps my pick of AB specialties."
"Pours to a deep golden color, with a white head that diminishes quickly.  There is a faint sweet malt aroma.  The flavor is very sweet, with a very pronounced honey flavor.  It finshes smooth and sweet, with low hop flavor or bitterness.  Overall, I was pleasantly surpised with this one.  The honey flavor really came through on this one.  It is a bit sweet, but would be a drinkable beer on a hot summer day."
"Rich medium amber. Rich head and tentatively clingy lace Not bad apperaance in a glass, poured from tap. Very sweet malt and under carbonated. Way to sweet to drink at all. Make me sick to my stomach."
"it is smooth and sweet with a very strong taste of natural honey, much more than i had expected. the honey is balanced out by a nice maltiness that makes it an all around flavorable beer."
"Anyway, I didn't think this was too bad.  I surely don't accept it as a serious specialty beer, but I think it's kind of a ""macro novelty"" that you try once and leave it at that."
"Sorry,Honey Lager.  Good hustle, but I don't think you made the team."
"After a hard day of shopping at the market, I was very thirsty when I popped the top on this Michelob Honey Lager. The combination of the sweet honey and the bite of the hops put my palate at ease right off the bat, this is a fairly good macro lager."
"Any beer that tastes better out of the bottle has problems.  I was dissatisfied at the lack of head and head retention.  I was dejected at the lack of smell, some faint sweetness (honey?) but nothing noteworthy.  The taste seemed kind of manufactured; the honey/sweetness did not seem natural.  I did not find the flavors overwhelming nor did I find them overly enjoyable.  I could drink one or two of these (in a pinch) and thats about all"
"I think the BA reviewers were on to something. The brewers were full of crap--this is not what it should be. Honey, when added into the fermentation process (where it belongs, IMO) will NOT sweeten the beer. Honey is 100% simple sugar, thus 100% fermentable. I can't stand it when brewers and meaderies make such cloyingly sweet beverages such as Michelob Honey Lager. What they are really doing is ""flavoring"" this otherwise decent beer with honey to give it honeyish aroma and sweetness. They have to add it after the yeast has been removed or killed, otherwise it would ferment out and you would get a drier, more vinous flavor from the honey and maybe the aromatics of the flowers the bees were using. Dundee, A-B, stop doing this! It misrepresents the true role of honey in fermented beverages. I damn it on principle."
"Cloying and sickeningly sweet.  J.W. Dundees does a better job with their Honey Brown.  This smells o.k., pours out to a bright yellow, then assaults you mouth with a nasty, sweet taste that follows through all the way to the end."
"i didn't dislike this beer, and even drank a few of them while i was at it....but i can see where beer geeks would be turned off. the honey taste and sweetness was almost overwhelming, but genuine. nothing i would seek out if i had to pay for it, since i had this at a friends house. if you REALLY like the sweet taste of honey, or are looking for a breakfast beer to go with those pancakes....this is a good choice. if your looking for genuine beer flavor, stear clear."
"Of all the Michelob ""craft brews", this one is least likely to give me a headache (before the Michelob line, the AB ""Black and Tan"" Porter was my favorite but it was long ago discontinued)...a look at the ingredients label told me that this brew doesn't include rice or other grains, differing from the others...maybe?  Very average and a little greasy, because of the honey, I guess...when I'm trapped into bringing something home from a limited grocery selection, I might get this...no hops, malt hidden by sweetness, but I can drink it..."
"Notes: Pretty bad, way too sweet and very hard to drink one 12 oz bottle. Needs a bigger twang of hop and/or a bit of dryness. Not recommended at all."
"Tastes like they poured a whole jar of honey in one beer!!  Seems like it was made for underaged high school girls.    A very, very poor effort!"
