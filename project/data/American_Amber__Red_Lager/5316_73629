3.58,-2.2,2.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall - A good beer, just not a real good one, and certainly not a ""session"" beer despite the product line. This is a pretty heavy feeling lager, and weighs a bit more than your average amber @ 6.2% ABV (the booze is detectable but actually pleasant). Good tasting, but could use more carbonation and a heavier hopping hand for more balance and bite: needs a body tweak for improved crispness. C'mon Full Sail, I know you could do this better!","Redneckwine","Oct 08, 2014"

A dark amber you'd expect from an ale. Smelled sweet, first pull was different and not off putting . Enjoyed the carbonation and the body which was a little distracted by the tingling of the carb. Almost a light brown sugar after taste and almost no hop notes at all. Considering the high abv for a brew lager this is pretty great.  Sorry for the lack of descriptive language lost my sense if smell due to being sick, just now slowly getting it back.  Will  get again once full senses come back (olfactory). Would recommend if your wanting something different to enjoy. No risks here","SVan007","Aug 01, 2014"

Of course, their bottles are only 11oz. so you're not getting any particular bargain over a pack of Sam Adams or Sierra Nevada, but their lagers provice a more basic taste tailored for sessions. Our local store had 12 packs of these marked down to $6. Can't help but pick one up. This one is a little more robust than the classic or black lagers. Hops + carbonation have quite a bite. It's a good, if unremarkable taste. To me, it's not quite as sessionable as the others, but it's worth a shot, especially if you get it at the price I did. It'll go well with a lot of food too.","TheRealBigC","Jan 13, 2013"

ANY beer drinker can enjoy this--though hop-heads will be discontent that it doesn't slap them in the throat--oh well, let them settle down. As I wrote above though--terrific that America's most serious brewers are finally paying attention to do first quality renditions of the Continent's most serious beers (instead of just following English or 20-something American tastes).","AnalogReigns","Nov 24, 2012"

Flavor is fairly typical for a lager, except fairly strong and with nary a trace of the skunkiness I detected in the aroma. Maybe I was smelling things? ;) It does have a hoppy, somewhat bitter tone with a hint of something nasty, but it is still decidedly drinkable. Texture has average body and average fizziness.

Aromas are rich and malty, with a sweet caramel tang to the normal roasted cereal scents of a lager. Flavors are nutty and spicy, with a caramel backbone and a slight hopping at the end to clean everything from the palate. Tasty brew on a round, smooth, yet crisp body. The aftertaste is a bit resiny and bitter, with a roasted character. The finish dries nicely, leaving the palate clear for more. Very easy brew to drink, and the flavors are spiced and smooth enough to make a very sessionable holiday ale.","GarthDanielson","Nov 23, 2011"

Smell is of toasted malt/grains, bread/biscuit, and some caramel notes. Taste is of toasted malt, bread, caramel, and some spicy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good red lager and a good alternative to spiced Winter beers. This is probably my favorite Session beer from Full Sail to date.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 21, 2011"
3.47,-5.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark copper-red, nearly a tawny brown. Thin, short-lasting bubbles show head retention just a tad more impressive than a soft drink. Polotmavé - never had, nor heard of the style. I'm guessing amber lager is a good enough descriptor. Some caramel, baking bread, and shortbread balance out a pleasant grassy and earthy hoppiness. Nicely brewed and clean, dryness is appreciated since this was meant to be an easy drinker. Surprisingly, Full Sail managed to capture some holiday elements in this seemingly basic red lager. It's nice to see a brewery go outside of the winter warmer/stout box for a winter seasonal. This definitely a beer that would please both craft drinkers and generic beer guzzlers alike. I think a box of 12 bottles will be making the trip to Thanksgiving dinner with me this year.","bump8628","Nov 21, 2011"
3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark copper/amber. Not much for head but a good amount of foam clings around the sides of the glass. Every time I sip some more forms on the sides. Light German malty sweetness. Some hop spice as well. Biscuity malt flavor and just like the nose it finishes with some hoppy spice. Thinner side of a body but still a decent malt character.","DrinkingDrake","Nov 20, 2011"

3.94,7.7,3,4,4,4,4,"Solid beer. Not much to look at with its pale amberness and lack-o-foamy-head. Smells like malt liquor with a spicy cinnamon poke in the sniffer. Smells like flowers too. Tastes tingly and bock-like: surely a dichotomy. Mouth feel belies the light color.... a bit. Weightier than expected, but by no means a tongue carpet. I picked up a single in this instance, but I'll get the 12er next time.","specksnreds","Nov 15, 2011"
3.29,-10.1,4.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Appearance is a dark copper amber having a stable head and nice lace. Smell is light thats a little grainy, roasted malt and hops. taste of grainy roasted malt with a bitter hop lasting through the aftertaste. Can't taste much of the alchohol either. Mouthfeel is medium with a good spike of carbonation. No wow factor hear, but not to bad for a red.","Bookseeb","Nov 13, 2011"

The body was kinda ugly, but that was only because of the colors. The head was...eh, not great. I'm kinda confused on how to grade this beer for appearance, maybe it deserves a 4 for the good lacing, but I'm pretty sure it's well short due to everything else.","MaltsOfGlory","Nov 12, 2011"

4.06,10.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice reddish brown with a frothy off white head that sticks around. Smell is mostly malt with some yeast and subtle spice notes. The taste starts with the malt and moves into the yeast, and has a nice subtle spice finish. The aftertaste has some of the malty notes with a subtle sweetness. A nice medium mouthfeel adds the the depth of the beer, giving a thicker style. Nice carbonation and an easy drinker. These session beers are solid beers, all with subtle nuances and great flavor. Nothing huge and over the top but done right.","wingman14","Oct 16, 2011"

Fine malty,hay,bready aromas slight hint of lemony hop Malty taste..hint of chocolate and spices..not sure were i get it from but there is a definate peppery spiceiness.

3.57,-2.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3,"- It's a solid drinker. A sessionable beer? Perhaps for the cool holiday's yes, but I can see this recipe as more of a marketing ploy. If it were bottled in 6-packs and sold for more, I doubt it would do as well as it is as a new session series. The flavor is very good, but the rest falls short. I am more keen to the likes of their latest imperial IPA, because that beer didn't taste like the rest of theirs. This one does.","Docer","Oct 08, 2011"
