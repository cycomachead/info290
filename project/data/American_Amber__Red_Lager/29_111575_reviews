"Good beer, goes down easy, smooth and very light, would drink 2-3 with good quality hot dogs, use 1 to boil the dogs in. for a large corporate beer, can't knock it, it is good."
"OVERALL:  sometimes I think AB wants to delve into ""craft"" brewing, this would be like dipping your big toe into the deep end of the pool.  It's a step in the right direction but does not go far enough for me.  This is a decent beer, not unlike Sam Adams Boston Lager, just not as good.  Since there are better options available I would not seek this out again."
"This drinks with evident adjuncts like a corn sweetness, and crisp rice but it has an additional caramel malt flavor. The finish is rather bitter and tinny and there's an overwhelming metallic bubblegum taste."
"Overall: pleasant and easy to drink."
""
"Comes in talls!!  Good alcohol content.  A working mans brew for sure!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with the usual carbonation level. Crisp and clean with just a hint of syrup in the finish. Overall an excellent alternative to most macro lagers. Good price point as well (so far).  Not craft level but more in the crafty style. Reminds me of AB Black Crown."

"That's my rating. I'm no beer snob. I'm not a taster. I'm an average guy, who's more into beers than the next average guy."

"16 oz can into a pint mug. What a find! But seriously. For the price, this might be the best beer out there. I don't have a lot of money, so I can't drink high-end craft 365 days/year. This is a definite step above all of the other crap and a slight bit better than PBR which was my previous cheap go-to crap. It has possibly been replaced. If I could rate this for value I'd rate it 4.75/5. It is like a cheaper, watered down SA Boston Lager. Very inoffensive and accessible."

"Pours a clear copper/amber color with a foamy head that very quickly subsides to barely a thin lace.  The smell/taste have some maltiness with no noticeable adjuncts present.  I sensed just the slightest amount of alcohol heat but not enough to detract from the overall flavor.  Mouth feel is a little thin and the finish is very neutral.  The carbonation level is quite low.  Overall an OK beer but nothing worth going out of your way to get."
"This is a awesome tasting beer. Now all of us are hook on it for parties"

"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some caramel. Taste is light and mild, malts, some sweetness. Feels light in the mouth and overall is refreshing and highly drinkable, but a bit on the bland side."
"Taste has a little more toasted malt than regular Busch but other than that, I really dont get much else that differs. I like Busch for an AAL, and will reach for one at the ice trough on a hot day at the gas station over any other bargain beers. This is a fine addition to the lineup and with a 5.7% ABV tag, Im game. I have trouble rating this, as an Amber Lager, this isnt all that good compared to the craftier versions, but as an Adjunct Lager (priced as one), it kicks a fair amount of ass. Im fairly impressed."

"Overall-  not a terrible beer, A-B has attempted to make an upgrade to their Busch beer and it is not bad.  Won't be confused with many craft beers but it is not a bad beer to drink."

"DEE-CENT! (to quote Bubbles) My new favorite affordable brew."
"Just saw this at Walmart last week and thought I'd take a chance. We LOVE it!  I'm not really into the dark or flavored beers and hubby hates them. This is what we're drinking now and are looking fora  place that sells it by the case!"

"For $8.99 a 12 pack in the bottle at 5.7% ABV with a nice finish ... pretty good brew and better than many microbrews/craft beer on the market. It and Michelob Amberbock have a lot of similarities, even some of my high hop bitter grapefruit aftertaste enjoying friends were enjoying this one."
"So up front you got a really decent amber malt profile, and that gives way to a graininess that's distinct to Busch and that's objectively not bad, only it tastes like Busch and I dumbly associate that with a lack of quality. Medium bodied and very easy drinking, even in spite of my stupid prejudices."
""
"I confess. I recently bought a riding lawn mower and lawn mower beers have lost some of their appeal :( But the good news is this is a beer with enough body and taste to make me take note (after acknowledging its relatively low cost) Not one I will be having with the guys at a tasting but a solid beer for household chores and what not."
""
"O- For the price, I may have found my new ""cheap beer."" Since i usually grab a case of High Life Light as my cheap beer choice I'll try em side by side before the final verdict. Nothing to complain about but also nothing to brag about. Much better than Miller Fortune or Bud Black."
""
"Certainly not a great beer but it has its place. Price seemed on the cheaper side. I'll be curious to see if this is still being made a year from now. My hunch is it won't."

"This is, at least in my neck of the woods, a cheap beer. It has a high alcohol content and great for a cheap buzz, or drunk if you drink the whole 6-pack. Poured in a Weizen Glass it produces a large head but provides little to no retention of the carbonation in the brew. Meaning this sucker goes flat faster than you can drink it. Lines of froth on on the glass do not stick as with other lagers. In my honest opinion, this beer is meant to be consumed from the can and, while tastes good for the first sip when poured, does not live long outside of it."

"O: Not bad for a big brewer. Better than Black Crown but not as good as Yuengling."

"overall this seems like an amber bock on steroids. a beefy, cool weather lager. it's pretty flawless but also sort of dull. never was a fan of A-B's malt liqour lineup, but this is ok."
""
""
"This is okay. I think I might like it better if it was warmer out and I was more thirsty as it falls closest to a lawnmower beer."

"Prior to trying this, my philosophy on Busch was why drink it when you can eat it?"

"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"A nice drinking beer that i would buy again and again."
" Easy drinking, carbonation upfront, then some nice malt. Little to no hops. The beer starts bubbly, then has flat finish. As the beer warms it takes on a more flat, less peppy way. Uninteresting beer, though I wouldnt turn it down. It has a kick after only half the can. Good for huntin, and fishin."
"room temp tastes bland but cold its really good."

"Pours a clear, copper/golden color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of slight hops, slight sweet malt, pale malt, corn, and slight metallic. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hops, slight corn, and hint of metallic. Overall, better than regular Busch, but still not much to rave about here."
"O - One of the best adjunct beers I've had in many a moon. Most beers get worse the longer they sit. This one gets a little sweeter. Nice. Great beer for the price. AB finally gets one right."
"Overall: I'm not gonna lie, I liked this probably more than my objective score suggests. It has a nice toasty taste and it goes down nice and smooth. This is a good cheap beer with flavor, in other words."
"O=This might have been considered a breakthrough beer by a big brewery 30 years ago (hell, I think even Killian's is better), but not today. There is no need for this beer in the marketplace. I like Busch as AAL's go, but this doesn't even live up to the Busch name. It does not taste awful...well, what little taste there is is akin to flat cola. Will not buy nor drink this again."

"25oz can boasting 5.7%abv. Pours out to a one inch head that laces initially then falls to permanent 1/8"" layer. Color is a brownish copper. Aroma is sweet and adjuncty and sulfury. Flavor is clean, easy and a little on the sweet side. The toasted malt is faint but noticeable and welcome. Mouthfeel is light and slightly astringent. Overall it is the first product with the Busch label that I consider a ""good call."" Best beer for its price class, too."

"I had high hopes for this beer. Finally a decent Amber from one of the giants. The color on the pour was great and the head wasn't half bad. After that it went downhill. The taste was fizzy, like someone took a good beer and put seltzer water in it. No back taste, nothing. I would like for the Internationals to brew a decent beer here in the states instead of trying to keep an ""American flavor", which is drink it ice cold so you can't taste it. I bought six and gave five away. Fageddaboudit."
"The feel is not so much one of Busch's classic AALs rather than an amber ale as one might expect. True, the body leans light but isn't terribly thin, though it comes along with a slight graininess in the feel. True, one could have any one of the numerous superior beers in the style, but this fits right in the middle of the pack."

"When I rinsed out the can with hot water for recycling, it smelled like burning plastic..."

"25 ounce cans, that bring this WV boy some nostalgia competing with fellow high school friends to who can finish their 30 pack of Busch first (tag team edition of course)...that will hurt you the next day...my digestive tract has never been right since. It has that amber caramel coloring added with a fizzy off white head, just barely has specks of lacing holding on. Busch Signature Copper Lager...I'm sniffing on it trying to get a feel before I attack. What the hell is this, it's an upper class lager for the Busch crowd, I think that's an oxymoron. It smells like a Michelob Amber Bock, just barely more malt presence than your average BMC product, a bit of caramelized sugar notes noticeable no real hop profile to speak of. Horrible flavor almost a caramelized nutty character that hits with a cooked veggie adjunct sweetness, almost like vomit coming up in the back of the gullet hard to stomach each sip...wonderfully horrible. It's cloying the mouthfeel is pretty overcarbonated completely off putting in every sense of the word beer. I can't go on, not even a beer I would ever think of buying again, it's approachable for someone who wants a copper colored lager with food coloring but the label states ""proudly brewed with grains from America's heartland and toasted malt for a smooth , signature taste. Alcohol 5.7% abv higher than the BMC crowd is used packed into 25 ounce cans for next to nothing...they're going to love it."
"overall for an A-B brew i am impressed! better than bud/light and for cheaper. better than original Busch and for the same price, and higher abv. Busch was already my favorite cheap beer. now i think i found a new cheap favorite. as long as A-B doesn't discontinue the best brew they have ever made."

"O- Well son of a gun this brew has blind sided me. I wasn't expecting this to be this enjoyable. I've tried about every beer under the Busch name and this one takes the cake. Very smooth a clean. Good hot day brew. And the bang for buck aspect is terrific. Well folks, this ain't your fathers Oldsmobile."

"Solid beer, I was able to try this. Obviously my expectations weren't extraordinarily high but I was real pleased. None of that nasty aftertaste that you find with most beers (Busch included) at this price point. For a low profile roll-out, I find this to be MUCH better than the Black Crown or Miller Fortune or those similar amber styled beers. Its actually kind of funny. Leave it to the Busch brand to make the actually ""good"" beer. Definitely an A+ on the Bang For Your Buck matrix"

"I know for a fact that A/B nailed it when they made this. Its exactly what it says on the can. Its a awesome brew, great great copper color, rich aroma and a smooth taste going down. And for $1.10 cents a can/25 ounce, I can pretty much step out on the limb and say it will hang with the more expensive darker amber brews."
"Pours a pretty reddish-copper in color with a 1-finger slightly off-white foamy head that settles down to just the top and sides. Some lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is of sweet corn, grain and caramel malts. The taste is the same with the caramel malts coming out for the finish. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter finish at all. Is this a 'Bud' product???"
"The thing about this beer is, it's a one trick pony. It's not a brilliant craft lager, but it's the first time I feel Budweiser has produced a lager that's actually worth my time and money. It's tasty, affordable, and there's truly nothing offensive about it. Plus, that 5.7% is a lot more suitable to a craft beer veteran than a Yuengling Amber clocking in at 4.4%. Honestly, in my book it's like a better Yuengling. If you enjoy some cheaper lagers from time to time, or are already a fan of Yuengling Amber, you owe yourself to try this. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I plan to smash about twelve of these with a buddy tonight."

"D/O- Taken for what it is, classified as an ""American Amber/Red Lager", Busch Signature really blew away my expectations. I thought ABInBev was going out on a limb by dramatically upping the SRM color for one of it's flagship brands but this is a pleasant surprise and one that both I can see myself drinking in the future and one that will stick around and not be a ""flash-in-the-pan""."
"Read that we were in a ""test market area"" in an article, so I picked up a 6 of pounders for $7 in the name of science. Pours as advertised in color. Smells like most adjunct lagers - not much of anything. I'll be damned, it actually tastes pretty good. Considerably better than Budweiser. No fizzy metallic aftertaste. A little bready, carmel maltiness going on. I actually think it is almost as good as Yuengling. Based on the ABV and price point, it may be one of the better options when you are ready to throw down on a summer night while playing cornhole or looking for a tall boy at the gas station."
""
"Wow...all I can say is wow. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a top quality brew, but I just can't believe that something with ""Busch"" on the label actually turned out to be a decent brew. Definitely, and without a doubt worth a try."
""
""

"O - It is a pleasant surprise. It has some decent flavor, and I'm a homer for Busch. Hey, my mom named me buschbeer, so I have some sentimentality for it."

"Busch Signature Copper is not your average Busch Beer. This is a a lot darker in color. This brew pours out a rich, deep amber color with a nice white head. Not a light amber as other Busch Beers. Being 5.7 abv witch is high than Busch being 4.6% ABV and Busch Ice at 5.9%. The smell is rich with grins and malts.  The taste is bold with flavor. The mouth feel is nice and clean. This brew has a lot going on in it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  This is one Busch Beer that I would write home about. Great Brew for the Money. I would buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5."

"O: Not bad. It's decently drinkable for a negligible (and worth it) price increase over Busch/Busch Light. I could see this being a go-to pickup when the occasion calls for cheap tallboys."
"Overall, this is surprisingly similar to Budweiser. Darker malt flavors, along with the light, crisp, easy drinking qualities of a light beer. I know it's not a world class beer, but when you combine the fact that this beer is sold at Busch prices, is 5.7% ABV, and has just a touch of darker flavors, it's a winning combo."
