4.3,26.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Unfortunately, it appears as though the Lion Brewery has decided to halt it's production of their Amber Lager, quite possibly for good. From what I've heard from numerous distributors around Northeast Pa, Amber has always been a good seller. Aside from their Oktoberfest, Amber is the only thing the entire Lion franchise has going for it. Advertisment is practically non-existent for their products. I just recently tried Susquehanna Brewing's Goldencold Lager, and the Lion would be wise to revive their Amber.","paulhargus","Mar 29, 2012"
2.91,-14.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a light copper color, off white head recedes away to a wisp with little lace. Very light aroma of bready malts and a whiff of hop. In the flavor, mild unoffensive pale malts, lager yeast strain, unoffensive adjunct (corn) flavor, small hop and a slight metallic twang to go with a mild but perceivable bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium/light, well carbonated, semi crisp. Overall, not too bad of beer that could be drank in mass quantities.","Stinkypuss","Mar 07, 2012"

Nice even flavor, again mostly a bready, grain malt flavor with only a touch of hops to serve to try and even and balance it out. nice carbonation though and it went down smooth and easy with a crisp, clean finish and a nice bite at the end.","mikesgroove","May 24, 2011"

Toasty caramel malts in the taste, and not much else; some hop bitterness becomes apparent near the end, providing some balance.

3.5,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: A pleasant, no-frills amber lager. Not really well-known or popular, but this is a better amber than a certain ubiquitous Pennsylvania beer that enjoys a near-cult following. A worthy, accessible brew.","Clydesdale","Nov 30, 2010"
2.56,-24.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I got this in a mixed Stegmaier 12-pack, and this was my least favorite (most of the others were quite good). This smells and tastes like a mass-market adjunct lager, much like beers produced by Dundee (of Honey Brown lager fame). Sweetness overwhelms most of the other flavors--there's only a very slight element of the roastiness typical of amber lagers, and hops are fortunately present but underwhelming. For better examples of the style, try GLB's Elliot Ness, Dos Equis Amber or even Trader Joe's Mexican Dark Lager.","HeightsEats","Nov 28, 2010"
3.45,1.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 oz single from Grocery Outlet, Salem Oregon Average clear see-through amber colour nice creamy head to top it off. Aroma is pleasant enough caramel malts. taste is semi-bitter caramel, with a touch of grassiness, a little taste of iron in the back perhaps from the water used. Pretty OK on the palate . Fine for the style. Overall a simple drinkable amber lager. No real off tastes. Does the job intended for a cheap price.","Reidrover","Oct 04, 2010"
2.8,-17.9,2,2,3,4,3,"Pouring this red-brown beer into a pint glass leaves very little head that quickly fades away. The odor is not powerful but seems to be citrus and leaves.

3.03,-11.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a very basic caramel malt sweetness with a dry lager yeast aroma. It has a light metallic aroma as well as little to no hop character. The taste is average as well. It has a weak and watery caramel malt sweetness along with a bone dry finish. It's very bland and lacking in hop character. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a forgettable amber lager. It's lacking flavor and aroma. I'll pass on this one in the future.","WesWes","Sep 16, 2010"

3.92,15,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Good for what it is, however laggers all more or less taste the same for me give or take a little sweetness at the end of the sip. Smell is remarkable for a lager though with notes of caramel, cherries and other fruits, too bad it doesn't hit the taste bud with such force. This one ends in a medium malty sweetness. I don't find it desirable to go look for, but it certainly is drinkable enough to drink if lager is the only option (which it so often is in this day and age).","hdofu","Jul 12, 2010"

Taste is light bodied, has a slight tinge of hops to it, decent malt backbone. Flavors don't totally mesh well together with me, just average drinkability in my opinion. Amber ales tend to be a boring style, but this one's lack of hops make it even more boring. I'd have one if given to me, but I would in no way seek this one out... rest of the mixed 12 pack is quite good though.","oriolesfan4","Jul 06, 2010"
4.18,22.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A dandy gift from Rubby..thank ye. First of all, I had Steg 150, not the stuff pictured here as Amber Lager. From all accounts I could find on line this stuff is a Vienna ""Marzen / Lager. This beauty shows a dark orange amber color, hazy with a fair off-white/light oatmeal colored head that disappates quickly with good lacing. The aroma says rye malt with a slightly minty edge, sort of an odd hint of alcohol, but interesting, not bad. The flavor comes on with a nicer version of that same rye malt, very grainy with an almost resinous feel and proper carbonation for a refreshing and tasty lager. There's some orange/lemon citrus going on but it just adds some tasteful highlights to the solid grain pleasure of this neat brew. There's a little Tootsie Roll sweetness with a fairly clean tingly feel in a medium bodied brew. Very nice lager, one of the better ones for me and one to be quaffed freely!","Durge","Jun 25, 2010"

And although I think it would be a real winner with just a little bit more malt and body, I can't argue against it as it is. I find it quite pleasant and charming. It would be the perfect beer for parties or get-togethers where a mix of drinkers are present. There's enough here for the initiated, and yet it's not too much for the newbie. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Aug 18, 2009"
3.42,0.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pops the top but didn't need to, I see its a twist-off, good sign or bad we will see. Smells like a macro red but it does have a bit more maltiness behind it. Pours to a reddish-gold with a big bubble head that recedes quickly. Taste is malty at the start with a very twangy hop kicking in, in the middle then lingering while the sweetness fades. I don't know what hop this is but I'm not sure if I like it. With the beer warming up a bit the twang isn't there so much and the god malty backbone transitions to a sweet dry hoppiness that then finishes dry. Has got to be the lagering. I guess I blew the call expecting a red ale but this is much crisper with a much drier finish. For the style a tasty brew. More an Ale man myself but this works in a pinch.","mooseisloose","Aug 17, 2009"

There's also a bit of apple juice fruit flavor and overall this is an affordable and tasty lager.","tempest","May 20, 2009"

So after looking for it at my local distributors and not finding it I finally had to ask a for it. They really didnt sell much from the Lion other than Lionsead. Anyway it cost me about 23 bucks in So.Chester County(later found it for under 18 at BeerMart in Reading, not close too me but I stop in while in the area now and then). The beer from the cold bottle was a slightly hazy amber color. It smelled of sweet malt. I would put the taste between Yuengling (more there) and Sam Adams (less than SA).It had a sort of sweet stickiness which reminded me of a Sam. Overall, I thought it was an impressive beer from the Lion.It seems like all of the PA breweries are moving to more richer lagers ala Yuengling. On the downside, I had a hard time finding this beer in Lancaster and Chester counties.","lionking","Jan 04, 2008"

The beer itself was clear and effervescent deep gold (rather than copper as indicated on the packaging), and the head was one finger thick. The aroma was clean and malty with some spice also present. The taste indicated spicy floral hops and double concoction sweet and toasty German malts. Although malty, the start and end was each sip felt quite dry. Very smooth and softly textured mouthfeel. Simple of construction, but more complex in character than first suggested. No ABV listed, but I suspect this was a bit heavier than a typical Vienna Lager.","rajendra82","Oct 11, 2007"

There's just enough hop presence to balance the sweet. There's also the Steggy house metallic twang which always seems to be appropriate by the second bottle. This is crisp, medium-bodied and finishes lightly sweet. Drinkability is good. I rate it slightly below SABL and slightly above Negra Modelo for style.","BoozySmurf","Aug 05, 2007"

A few slow moving streamers of carbonation. Aromas of lightly toasted malts, mild hops and a slight mineral quality. Predominantly malty and sweet with very little bitterness to counterbalance other than some light astringency in the finish. Carbonation seems a bit low, as if it was all blown off by the pour. What's left after the lower carbonation is a medium bodied lager that feels a bit thicker than it should with an average carbonation level. Overall, a pretty decent all-malt lager that is fairly drinkable. Personally, I like it better than Yuengling, it tastes smoother, contains no adjuncts, and is more affordable.

Kind of on the amber, Vienna side of things, with a more complex malt bill. Like the all the Steg varietal products, I don't think this is any lawnmower beer.
