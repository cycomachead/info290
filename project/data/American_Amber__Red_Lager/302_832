3.5,12.9,,,,,,"honey brown is one of the original beers of rochester, and unless you drink the genny stuff, this is really the original craft offering of the city. i still like it as much as i ever have. its distinct. a little pale in color to be considered a brown in my book, more copper, and very clear. the nose shows a little honey sweetness, but most of that is fermented out and leaving only the pollen honey flavor. lots of malt middle too, with more of an amber sweetness than a honey one. malty like an esb almost, less roast and chocolate malt than i usually expect from a brown, but there is a sight darker malt element which i guess can get it there for those not used to bigger darker richer browns. the fact that its lagered makes it awesome i think. drinks lighter, finishes quickly, and lets the flavors sort of come back one by one after the swallow. a very pleasant and drinkable brew, good craft to drink a lot of, and even right from the bottle feels appropriate. nice carbonation and not the least bit filling. the original and best from dundee.","StonedTrippin","Aug 17, 2014"

You get a sweet malt flavor at the front of the tongue with a pleasant mild honey aftertaste. The two different sweet characteristics makes you want to take another sip. The beer is easy to drink and an excellent choice on a hot summer day or night. Since there is no bitterness to this beer, it is an excellent recommendation to friends who are used to drinking typical American lagers.","MMaxim11","Jun 24, 2014"

Mostly earth and nut tones from the smell but most of what you get in the taste was a little bit of floral tastes from the hop and a little bit of sweetness from the malt.

This is the kind of brew you start drinking at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday and are still enjoying in early evening. The alcohol does not overwhelm, but the beverage remains highly drinkable. A true session beer offering from New York state. This beer pairs with alot of 'bar-food' and is equally enjoyable on its own. It has a unique flavor and is consistently enjoyable. Share with friends after work, while watching a game, or while relaxing on the patio by yourself. Add a few bottles to your refrigerator so you have a fall-back when guests don't appreciate the high-end stuff.

Mouth feel is smooth. Flavor is good, but a bit sweet. More malt than hops -- in fact, I can barely taste hops. Overall, not bad. Don't think I'll be buying this at the store, but I'd choose it in a restaurant if they didn't have anything more interesting.","DukeBedford","Mar 27, 2013"

The aroma is sweet honey, a little staleness, roasted grains. The flavor has strong undertones of honey sweetness behind some roasted grain, and not much bitter to balance. The honey leaves a strange aftertaste to this pretty standard lager. A good changeup if you normally drink Bud, but I tend to avoid this one these days as the finish isn't as pleasant as I would like.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

Overall I enjoyed this, not a great lager in any sense, but serves its purpose, gentle sweet honey adds to the lager.

My girlfriend who usually sticks to the yellow fizzy beers, such as bud light, actually enjoyed this one. The taste was not very strong and somewhat sweet, which is expected from a honey beer. If you are in to an strong hoppy flavor, this beer isn't for you, however it is a lager. This beer is light and very drinkable; something you might want if entertaining non-advocates of good, bold, strong beer.

Things haven't thickened out, though: they remain as whispy as in the smell. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

The only real smell is the big malt sweetness, but a fresh honey smell does make a slight appearance at the end. The taste is also only big on some malt sweetness. The only honey comes at the end in the form of a grainy, honey comb taste; sourness rounds it out. The mouthfeel is good; slightly thick and very smooth. However, it is a little bubble and will sting the recesses of your mouth. Due to the sourness and bubbles the drinkabilty isn't great.","nicksta","Nov 16, 2006"

Really smells like a honey-scented perfume. The only initial taste is malty, but there's a hint of honey on the finish that's nice. Mouthfeel is limpid; I'm not convinced that there's any carbon dioxide in this beer at all. I suppose this beer hits exactly what it aims for, which is a malty lager with a hint of honey.

The mild honey flavor timidly reveals itself in the mid-to-after-taste, which complements the initial bitterness of the alcohol and hops. The alcoholic content seemed slightly lower than what I expected from the taste, but it still did the trick. Not thumbs down, but definitly not thumbs up. Somewhere in the middle is where this beer resides.","scaaven","Oct 05, 2003"

The aroma is mostly a chalky malt smell with a macrobrew-like smell as well. The taste is not bad, very light and crisp, but rather lacking in complexity. It was a little thin and simple, but the price was the same as Bud or Coors and it still managed to bring a little bit more to the playing field. Not bad, I would recommend to anyone looking to get more from a macro while paying the same price.","nixhecks","Sep 24, 2003"

It contains a slight honey flavor along with the maltiness from the vienna malt used. It is a light beer with a low body. It's like most macros; quite popular and quite drinkable.

The retention is fairly good and it leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose delivers a honey-tinged sweetness. The body is light/medium and a fine-bubbled, median carbonation leaves it lightly crisp in the mouth. The crispness in the mouth is needed, however, to help balance the flavor which is also sweet and honeyish. There's a bit of malt character present, but overall it's more about simple sugary sweetness than grain flavor. It finishes less sweet than might be expected, but with a very distinct note of honey at the outset. It's definitely an interesting beer. Apart from the honey flavor, it's surprisingly drinkable - and yet it's not because it overwhelms the palate after more than two servings. And yet you could continue to drink it because there's nothing there to stop you. Probably worth trying if you've never had it before.","NeroFiddled","Mar 29, 2003"

Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts followed by nutty yeasts and a bit of a cracker-like flavor. A honey-like flavor is also present in the taste, but it seems a bit artificial, almost like corn syrup. A pretty average brew for its style all the way around.

Was a good clean honey flavored beer, there's worse and there's better. This sits just above average for the style. Could be a bit thicker, bolder, and flavored, but pretty good non the less.

Something resembling hops is present in the finish with just a slight touch of bitterness. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is solid and smoother than many mass-produced lagers. The drinkability is better than average for me, but just by a bit, as the sweetness starts to wear on you rather quickly. Not too long ago, this was one of my favorite beers. I was prepared to be very disappointed when I bought this beer, believing there was a strong possibility my memory was enhancing this beer's qualities. But I was not disappointed. It's still a respectable brew, and may be worth considering as a cheap session beer for macro-loving friends, or those times when the beer budget is a little low.","aaronh","Mar 01, 2003"

I like the occasional one here and there but the taste is just too sweet to enjoy more than one or two with out having something to eat.  It isn't a stand alone beer but in the facility of one maybe two beers its not all that bad.  The appearance supplies the drinker with almost no head at all, the only resemblance to a head is a foaming similiar to that of a well poured pepsi.  The color is a slightly dark yet a very transparent goldish amber.  The carbonation on this beer is very light with a medium body, the beer itself has a sliky relaxing feel with every swallow.  The flavor is just too sweet though for me to call this a good beer.  Its has a mellow feel to it nonetheless.

Lightly bodied from the copious use of adjuncts.  There's a one - dimensional, non caramel malt derived sweetness in flavor that is quite offputting, and borderlines of being cloying.  Malt complexity is sorely lacking.  Hop bitterness is meager, and thus allows for the sugary sweetness.  Tastes like a typical macrobrew w/ sugar added.  Mild honey flavors emerge in the finish, then vanish quickly leaving an empty blandness.  Honey Brown is not an enjoyable beer.
