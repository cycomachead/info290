3.27,11.2,3.25,3,3.5,3,3.25,"I should probably credit Sleeman for helping me to graduate beyond Molson Pilsener, Saskatchewan boy elixir of choice, to a much wider world of beer styles and legit quality-focused breweries, but a) that doesn't mean one can't turn an ""objective"" eye towards these Canadian standbys now and b) do not presume that Sleeman is necessarily one of the latter breweries. Sleeman was a transitional step. I likely consumed a disturbing number of honey browns and cream ales during my grad school days, so this trip back into Sleemanland, Onterrible was tinged with some nostalgia. Oddly enough I used to think this was an ale despite the term ""lager"" being right there in the name ... I suppose the goal of drinking back then wasn't to pay close attention. Also, Woody's Tap House only has so many wares to sample. It was this or something from a clear glass bottle that rhymes with ""Borona"". In any event, Sleeman honey brown on tap is a very light burnished bronze color, looks quite watered-down, with traces of white foam skittering on the surface. Aroma is sweet boiled grains, ephemeral brown sugar or caramel, lemon rind, a sourish apple fruitiness, and perhaps a hemp seed nuttiness. Palate is a blend of different malt and hops-generated effects, I get sweet white bread, sour vines candy, play dough, dilute citrus iced tea, and interestingly enough some cooking molasses. More dark malt character than expected! Nice! Less optimistically, however, the whole watery package is flavor-anemic, everything interesting is ramped down in favor of enough gas and bubbles to launch a hot air balloon. Crisp and dry finish does include a pleasant hay-like sweetness. Not fantastic but there was enough interest here to make me masochistically wonder what the cream ale would taste like now ... Stay tuned!","CalgaryFMC","Jan 01, 2014"

Mild hops ride in the background, along with a light butter scent. Flavors show the balance of grain and malt that the aromas show, albeit light. Light, earthy, metalic hop flavors and bittering hardly offset the grains / sweetness. Feels light and partly scrubbed to the palate, leaving a light diacetyl on the toung.

The sweetness might start to infringe on the overall enjoyment of this beer after 4 or 5 – but 2 hit the spot perfectly.","lipschitz","Aug 02, 2003"
2.73,-7.1,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"This one is surprise, surprise, and surprise! Bland. It has a standard lager taste, and what honey it has is notable only in the smoothness it imparts to the mouthfeel, and a hint in the aftertaste.","jackndan","Jun 03, 2003"
2.82,-4.1,4,2,3,3,3,"Pours without much head leaving little lace. Clear amber with light carbonation. Nose is distinctly skunky which is disappointing, I'm expecting a little bit of honey. Taste does have some sweetness with a brief hoppy finish. FWIW it is better than a JW Dundee - has more body.","jdhilt","May 24, 2003"

3.74,27.2,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The head is minimal and laces poorly. The smell is inviting, with a fresh lively character. The taste is smooth, with a very noticable honey note. Mouthfell is well rounded, and lingers nicely. Very drinkable, over several hours. NOTE: Beer is sold in clear glass bottles, so freshness is paramount. Beer suffers terribly with age/light.","beerdeity","May 02, 2003"
1.96,-33.3,2,1,2,2,3,"This beer might be more appealing to those drinkers who like Miller and Bud.","lampkins","May 01, 2003"
3.48,18.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"It's clear and bronze in color. A small but sturdy head of fluffiness stays for a while. I found the aroma a bit skunky with a touch of caramel sweetness. Not much skunkiness in the taste though, and the sweetness sticks out. I found it rather refreshing and drinkable.","AudioGilz","Apr 07, 2003"
3.92,33.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Color is brownish golden yellow, some big bubbles for the head that fizz out fast. Smells of strong sweet honey and malts. Taste echoes the smell. Smooth with a honey hop tangyness thats a little rough at first and ends with a nice malt coating. Quite drinkable and flavored honey lager, better then most I've had. Has more solid body where as most others are kinda watery.","tavernjef","Mar 22, 2003"
1.62,-44.9,3.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"The definition of swill is this beer. Their was neither taste nor smell that I could detect. Expecting a skunk smell due to the clear bottle, I practically snorted the bottle trying to detect any scent whatsoever. Nothing. Tasted like water. In shock, I kept looking at the bottle to see if I were drinking Aquafina by mistake. The appearance was alright. Attractive maple leaf gold. It's only winning attribute.","slitherySOB","Jan 21, 2003"
2.81,-4.4,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Aroma was a tad skunky. The taste was of a nice light honey and non lingering...a little to sweet for me which cuts back on drinkability....","Shiloh","Jan 04, 2003"
3.55,20.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"My only other run in with a 'honey beer' was JW dundee's honey brown and this is no comparison. Much better, mainly due to its milder honey flavors that are by no means overpowering.","allboutbierge","Dec 30, 2002"
2.61,-11.2,4,3,2,2.5,3,"This beer is a clear bronze color.  A well retained beige head tops it off.  A little mustiness and graininess on the nose.  The taste is pretty bland.  No bad off flavors or anything, just plain ass bland.    It wouldn't be hard to throw some of these back, but water would work nicely as a substitute for this.  Maybe I pick up a little bit of honey and the crispness that goes along with it.  Some faint maltiness.  Buy something else.  There's a lot better than this out there.","Bighuge","Aug 27, 2002"
2.73,-7.1,3.5,3,2.5,2,3,"Clear pale brown color, billowy head that stays at 1/2 inch for a while.  Caramel aroma, a little hay smell.  Light and sweet, a little buttery with minimum hop impact.  Could really use some more overall oomph, its watery enough to be pretty much done by the back of the mouth.  A little impression of overcooked celery.  Drinkable, I suppose, its a little more subtle than some honey brews in heavy sweetness.","ADR","Aug 24, 2002"
2,-32,2,2,2,2,2,"Thin and muddy in appearance and taste.  There was sweetness, but none really seemed to come from the malt.  Not well balanced.","Brent","Aug 22, 2001"
