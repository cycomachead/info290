It's an amber color and tastes just right to me, that is the balance between malt and hops is perfectly achieved. Carbonation is spot on and the aroma is a rich beer smell.

The carbonation is fairly high, which makes this really drinkable with its low bitterness. I tend to find lagers a bit boring for the most part, but something as simple as making the beer taste a bit toast-like worked very well. I'd have another one. It's a good beer to drink after you've had a few, but are still looking for something with a little bit of flavor.","Alextricity","Jan 13, 2014"

A nice complimentary hoppiness while still staying malt-forward. A quality canned lager.

I've had beers before that were basically meals in-and-of-themselves, and those beers can be good- but when eating steak and shrimp and potatoes and other steakhouse staples, the star of the show shouldn't necessarily be the beer.

Nose had a sweetness that I do not generally find in standard lagers. This had more of a caramel-like sweetness as opposed to the standard malt-driven sweetness that comes with non-adjunct lagers. I have really come to embrace lagers in recent years, having routinely poo-poohed them in my hophead salad days. The more I sniffed at this one, the more it grew on me. My first sip was very pleasant, surprisingly full for a lager and with a slight mintiness from the hops that balanced nicely with the sweetness noted on the nose. Finish was semi-sweet with the malt balanced well with the hops. I may not want a steady diet of this one, but as a change-up, it sure filled the bill.","woodychandler","Feb 14, 2013"

Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like toasted malt, toffee, and some bready/grainy malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also the addition of a bit of honey. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a solid brew, I wouldn't mind trying this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Dec 29, 2012"

A light amber color guess you could say that it looks like a lager with a slight toasting to it. Not getting a lot on the nose kinda get a sweet almost caramel smell but you have to be looking for it. Taste is well there is a slight bitterness sweetness on the back of the tongue. Not a ton of flavor or much going on. A hot day beer for sure when you want to cool off and be able to put back a 6 pack. Lots of carbonation on the tongue I poured this first one but probably will drink the rest right out of the can. overall good but for 8 or 9 dollars a 6'er probably not going to grab this again.","alk3kenny","Jul 20, 2012"

3.08,-13,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of a Vienna Lager, there was just too much sweetness and not enough flavor to make this beer worth drinking. This beer didn't have good drinkability, the high amount of sweetness didn't make it smooth, and the bland flavors can't seem to hold my interest, I wouldn't want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were pretty close to being on par for the style. What i liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the bland flavors and aromas, there was a little toast, but not enough to live up the name of a Toasted Lager. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I can think of more then a couple Vienna Lagers that I would much rather have, I don't really recommend this beer, but a Lager lover might like it. This was my first beer from Blue Point and it didn't make for the best first impression for this brewery, a pretty average beer all around, but I am still interested to see what more of their beers are like. Blue Point is going to have to crank it up a notch if they want me to buy their beer, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","May 17, 2012"

Other than a bit of sweet malt, not much aroma at all. The taste is clean, a small amount of bitterness on the finish, without any fruity notes at all. Pine is the dominant flavor, along with some malt. It has a decent mouthfeel. Overall the beer does not pack much flavor, but that may be true to style. i belive I would go with Samuel Adams Boston Lager, as a preference, over this beer.","omokoro","Mar 31, 2012"

Nose is surprising sweet, bready, but no “toasted” notes here. Slight butter and caramel. Mild hops, perhaps a bit of citrus. In the mouth, pleasant mild hops, nicely balance malt, a bit of bread and a slightly bitter finish. Smooth, crisp, and slightly viscous. Definitely lends itself to another… and another. Overall: Not terribly remarkable, but a solid lager.","jettjon","Jan 23, 2012"

Taste of toasted malt, bread, caramel, light fruit, nuttiness, and floral spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of bread, toasted grain, light fruit, and herbal spice on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish present. Smooth and easy drinkability. Good balance of flavors. Overall this is a solid and drinkable Vienna Lager offering.

3.35,-5.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very impressed by how dark the body was with a burnt amber color and a fairly thick, frothy head. The aroma is closer to a pale ale with a noticeable caramel scent, although it was definitely mild. Much like the aroma, the taste of the Blue Point Toasted Lager is similar to one you'd find in a quality pale ale. It's crisp and hoppy with a slight bitterness up front. The middle is almost all caramel - not anything too rich, but not overly sweet or candy-like. The finish, however, has a strange tang (but it's barely noticeable). This beer reminds me of Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but is not quite as robust. Despite the name and the brewer's description, I really don't get much of a ""toasted"" taste. There does seem to be a slight creaminess to the texture which helps combine the malts and hops into an overall satisfying flavor. The problem with flavorful lagers is they tend to sacrifice drinkability, but that's not the case here. While initially very bubbly upon being poured, Toasted Lager calms down to the point of being a little less than crisp but a little more than tepid. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thick and gentle, creating for an easy-drinking beer that goes down smooth. The astringent aftertaste lingers for a moment or two, but it's easily ignorable.","Rootdog316","May 29, 2011"

3.16,-10.7,4,3,3.5,2,3,"I remember trying something from Blue Point years ago and only remember being disappointed, but everyone deserves a second chance. This beer gives a good enough first impression, pouring from the bottle with a brilliant medium amber color topped by a decent creamy, cream-colored head. The aroma is dull but pleasant, with a light scent of toast and undercooked biscuits. The flavor is more pronounced, with the toastiness and biscuit coming out a bit more. In addition, the dry, bready malt base is balanced by a light lemony hop character. The mouthfeel is a lowlight, though, with a very thin, watery body being punctuated by small, prickly bubbles. Overall, this beer is fine and drinkable, but the distracting mouthfeel drags down my impression, and I am again a bit disappointed.","devilben02","May 24, 2011"

Not much of a hop aroma or anything else really. The flavors I felt were a little bland. When looking at the name on this I expected to get some forms of actual toast in this beer. Something that has that real specific taste of char or burned. I wasn't expecting those flavors to be strong in the brew but just a little bit so you can taste them.

Popping the top it reminds me of passing through towns where the beer was brewing, classic. On the pour I get a nice bronze brew with a micro to small bubble head, that dissipates quickly. On the taste, the smell is revisted and the brew has a roasted smell, then indeed a roasted taste. The initial taste is a soild belt of malt goodness, lightly hopped but with enough complimentary bitterness. The taste then reveals a toasted flavor, then finishes relatively clean with a hint of lingering bitterness. In my opinion this would be a great brew for seafood. For the style it hits the mark.

The hops offer maybe a bit of fruitiness, but I don't want to stretch my imagination. This is a really basic brew, with not a ton of complexity. Caramel and sweetness, with biscuit.

3.63,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"You get a finger plus head of off-white foam, creamy foam with slight dimpling, slightly above average lacing and decent retention. Red clay to copper orange in color, just short of full transparency, mild infusion of yellow around the rims. Soft malts in the nose, more texturally present than deeply scented, malted milk balls, dried molasses, buttermilk, not a lot of hop presence, perhaps some orange peel and apricot pit. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is foamy yet stops short of getting too large and diffusing the flavors. Metallic edge to the mouth entry, iron and rust, delays the registering of the flowers and more tart orange to lemon peel. Here, the caramel and butterscotch malty flavors less overt, although you kinda wish they were. Hint of raw nuts. The prickle from the carbonation does extend its presence in the absence of more resonant flavors. No big flaws, simply a bit boring and ho-hum, don't find it growing on me with repeated sips.","farrago","Nov 22, 2009"

Toasty and slightly nutty maybe even with a touch of caramel malts are the focus here with a light hop bitterness and even lighter hop flavor (its relatively indistinct and I can't name a variety or specific characteristics but its a more general, slightly herbal hoppiness).

The taste is malty, a bit tilted in the direction of caramel, there is some hop in the finish. I'm getting some crystal malt flavors, some slightly toasted grains, some reddish flavors in the background.

Similarly, I anticipated that in its taste as well, however, instead it tasted like a basic lager with a faint roasted malt and mild sweetness.

Aroma has a mild zingling pine/citrus hop combo with some toasted grain brings about light nut/biscuit components and a trace of caramel presence, but I was taken a back from the hops I was picking up especially for a flagship lager. Taste contains a mix of mineral tones, caramel biscuit malts, and expressive hop flavors including pine and citrus with mild overall bitterness, the malts were very nice toasty as the label describes.

3.45,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This ones a rich honey-amber color with a simple white head. The aroma is about what was expected: bread crust, a little malt, no fruitiness, light hop aroma, a bit of grainall of moderate intensity. Nice, but nothing special. The taste is a little better: faintly sweet up front, with toasted and caramel malts. Theres a nice balance, but with just enough hops. Finish has a solid bitterness. Medium body, with maybe a bit less than typical carbonation. All in all, this ones better than average, but just slightly over that bar.","Suds","Jan 23, 2006"

Aroma is clean and moderately malty with a slight grassy hop aroma. Taste is a sweet malt, lightly toasted as the name indicates, a little grainy, with a decent grassy hop finish. Simple but satisfying. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Not a big lager drinker, but this is a pretty solid one.

Head deflates rather quickly, down to about half height, with bits of lacing here and there. Aroma is somewhat generically well balanced with light malt and hops presences. Taste is balanced as well, with a bit somewhat sour fruitiness. Mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is limited by that sourness. Not a favorite here.","ppoitras","Jan 01, 2006"

If you call something a toasted lager than it should taste of toasted malt, no? It had a decent body and is drinkable and fogettable.

Nice white head that dissipates to a thin film that sticks around for the full glass. Nothing much on the smell other than a nice maltyness. The taste definately brings out a mild toasted flavor and maybe even a hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel seemed a little thin to me but had a nice level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable lager that compares very favorably to most of the lagers out there. The toasted flavor gives it just enough of a twist to make it unique.","beermanbrian","Jul 15, 2005"

It has a light crystal malt feel with a slight toasted flavor. It goes down easy and finishes dry and malty. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

3.63,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Contract brewed by Clipper City in Baltimore, MD - fresh off the bottling line from the brewery. It's crystal clear copper body rests gently beneath a short head of light tan foam that drops shortly to a wide, creamy collar and leaves some nice, thin lace about the glass. The nose is exceptionally clean with a light note of yeasty fruitiness and some mildly sweet and lightly toasted malt. The body is medium/light, and it's very fine, moderate carbonation lightly caresses the tongue before it slides away effortlessly. The lightly toasted malts found in the nose return in the flavor with a bit of leafy hop flavor and some delicate, berry-like fruitiness. It's backed by a solid bitterness that becomes quite apparent towards the swallow, and leads into a dry, grainy finish that lingers in the mouth but never builds beyond that. Very well brewed.","NeroFiddled","Sep 14, 2003"

4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"The bottle is contract brewed in MD and while the tap version is better and more authentic, the bottle is very good as well. Golden amber color with big fluffy head that laces, appealing aroma with some mild hops and roasted grains. The toasted aspect was a bit more noticeable on draft, as was the hop bitterness. Perfectly smooth, rounded mouthfeel, some traces of butter and metal in the bottled version. Still a fine, everyday drinkable amber lager. Its better than the current Sam's Boston Lager and more reliable than Saranac's Adirondack Amber which goes bad pretty quickly. I was a big fan of both those beers at one time or another, and this is a more than adequate replacement.","Thrasher","Apr 27, 2003"

I was expecting a nice toasty flavor which would be rare in a lager, but couldn't detect any toasted notes at all.

Bitter citrus hop on the tongue, with a toasty malt flavor that comes through to keep the rest of your mouth busy. Overall, the hop outdoes the malt (at least as far as my tastebuds went - this was the fourth of six brews/growlers that day) when cold.
