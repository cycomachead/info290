"Not on the top of my list, kind of a disappointment."

"Overall:  Not bad, I'd do it again, and I don't regret choosing it instead of the Fat Tire that was my only other option."

"Overall it's an acceptable beer, but nothing stellar.  A notch above Bud but not into great beer territory."

"This beer pours, from the can, a dark amber color with a plentiful cap of foam. The lager has an inviting aroma with a wonderful mixture of clean barley malts and bittering hops. The accent on malt is a nice touch. A smooth and clean feel on the on the palate leads to caramel notes with a slightly bitter, nicely balanced, finished. A great refreshing beer to enjoy while at the ballpark."

"This is ithe greatest beer Coors has ever brewed. Clealry a beer based on marekting and a bit gimicky, but on the other hand, this is a great tasting beer featuring all Colorado ingredients and ""only"" available in this, the greatest of states. A beer to be proud of, no matter who it's from."

"The beer pours a slightly off white and foamy head. The beer is a hazy amber color that is a little bit copper and leans towards the red side. The beer smell is a yeasty and caramel malty smell with a bit of alcohol on the nose. The hops are a slight note but still make an appearance. The beer has a much stronger hop presence than in the smell. The hop taste is balanced by the malt taste. Similar to the smell, the malts primarily consist of a sweet and light caramel taste. Additionally, the beer has a slight mineral taste as well as a bit of alcohol. The feel is crisp and lean with biting carbonation. A pretty good lager and shocking that this came from a MillerCoors subsidiary."

"Overall this was a nice middle of the road beer that shocked the hell out of me since the macro owned stigma can give misconceptions and decreased interest, but my friend Vinny insisted I try it as he had 2 cases brought to NY so I thank him again for sharing a few with me. A definite session beer that goes down smooth and easy, glad these escaped Colorado and made it to NY as they were easy to put down and enjoy."

"A pretty decent tasting amber, drinks pretty easily."

"O-I tried this beer a few years ago when it first arrived and was less than enthused, but this second look was positive. The flavors are good and there is a great balance between malt and hop with a nice bite for the style. Setting aside the craft v. crafty issue here, I will drink this beer again."

"Overall, a pretty decent, clean and easy drinking amber lager. Malt forward with a very refreshing lager smoothness with a dab of hop bitterness to nicely balance everything out."

"It turns out that a beer that's so simple in its plan and execution yields so much dialogue. I'm not one to sell it as as an undiscovered gem, it shows that there's a lot of appreciation to be said about simple beers done well. Turns out that native -Colorado ingredients make wonderful beers!"

"Just a real solid nice simple amber lager."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this one a lot. It cleanly shows off the bready malts and a touch of hops. I am not sure I agree it is the ""only lager ever brewed with Rocky Mountain water", but whatever. If visiting Denver, I would pick this up."
""
""
"Skeptics, don't let the name Coors taint your decision to try this beer."

"Pours a deep amber brown with a finger of off white head. Malt and buscuity aromas, slight hop notes. Taste is identical but more hops, malty and sweet buscuit but a nice balance of mild but present hops. It is very drinkable, balanced, and pretty tastey and at 5.5 abv is an easy session brew. Nice brew and great way to start my quick trip to Colorado."
"Enjoyable local brew. Glad I tried this one. Why aren't these guys shipping this out of state? If you enjoy a caramel/ biscuity beer then get ahold of this."
""
""
""
""
"Still, it does have other light flavors that help me move right along with this one. A different finish, a zipness, from other Coors..er, ACG...beers exists here a bit."
""
""
"O - i didn't think i would care much for this, but i actually enjoy it. the light caramel/cereal sweetness with the grassy aromas and crisp finish fit in well with the beautiful weather we are having today in the Twin Cities."
""

"Native pours a clean and clear copper color with amber highlights, and a thin off-white head that provides decent amounts of lacing. Sweet bready malt aromas are met with some slight hop tones. Toasty, bready malt flavors are very noticeable in the beginning, with a little hop bitterness providing good balance in the finish. The brew is crisp and clean with a medium-light body and a moderate amount of carbonation."

"O) A delicious brew - proof that the ""big boys"" are capable of producing quality beer."
"this is not a craft brew, and it doesnt taste like one. pours slightly darker than the industry standard corn beers, decent white head. smells a bit metallic or something, malts in the nose, no hops to speak of. taste is pretty weak, cerealy a bit, with a slight metallic tinge. not as bad as a silver bullet, thats for sure, but a poor attempt to capture the craft beer drinker by a big company. still, when next to budlight at the hockey rink for the same price, ill get a native every time. credit for all colorado ingredients, but this just doesnt taste real good"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, slight pale malt, slight grain, and hops. Overall, great appearance, good feel, and good blend."
"Overall: a very good lager. Attractive appearance and solid lager taste. I wasnt expecting a macro brewed lager to be as good."
"If the objective is to bring hoppy, IPA-like beer to the masses and call it a lager, they've succeeded. But to review this as a lager doesn't seem fit the requirement. I liked it, however, and will buy it again if it gets to my state."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint. This beer pours a golden caramel with a decent 2 inch head that quickly disappears even though the glass has a nucleation point. Just a bit of wispy lacing is left as I drink the beer. The aroma is good. Up front is a nice malt backbone with caramel and toast. A nice hop aroma is also present. I'm surprised with a bit of grapefruit and lemon. The flavor is much the same. Straight forward with a nice bready background and hops up front. Nothing muddling, straight forward. Nice and clean. Really tasty. Coors has done a really good job with this beer. I'm looking forward to seeing what else they put out."
"woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. This beer almost exploded out of the can and settled down with a caramel color and 1.5 inches of head. Smell is rather mild, some hops are present. Taste is also hops up front, some grains, a tad bitter at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall was a refreshing and enjoyable beer."
"This is a lager?!? Made by the AC Golden Brewing Co. of Golden, CO, eh? Who's zoomin' who here, boys? I have long said that given their (unspoken) expertise and having tried some of the beers during the GABF at The Rockpile, like the (unnamed) Rauschbier, they should refocus on making quality craft beers, especially for a CAN."
"Pseudo BMC-craft product but it really is pretty good, they have the amber lager part down pretty well, malty yet refreshing and drying. Flavors are rather sweet, coarse and grainy but it's a large step up from Coors."
"I don't find this very drinkable as an American Amber. It's about as hoppy as a Pale Ale. But I don't know what else to call it, since it represents this increasingly chaotic style of random recipes."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes. I would be happy to get a 12-pack of this from time to time to stock the fridge or cooler this summer. This is an easy drinking, refreshing lager that would make both the craft beer enthusiast and the casual beer drinker very, very happy."
"Two Schlitz? If I could buy this in Michigan, it would replace Schlitz as my go-to macro lager."
"I was ready to hate on this beer, given its association with megabrewer Coors, but that was impossible to do after the first few sips. Great head retention and lace particularly for a bottled beer. The aroma is malty and honeyed, what you might expect from a cloudy amber brew. A surprisingly soft start, despite the amount of carbonation shown when poured. Chewy body and great balance between the malt and hops. Long bitter finish. I'm sorry for only having brought one bottle back from CO."
"Clean, balanced, semi-complex and easy to drink. Yeah, they are walking the walk here. We live for exceptional lagers that jump out of the bottle and get all up in your palate."
"Dr: At this price range, better beers can be had - especially in the Colorado microbrew scene. Save yourself the money and buy a better beer."
"A clear rosy amber color with a fair white cover and decent lacing. The aroma is nice and malty with a tasteful bit of skunk. The flavor brings more mellow malt with citrus/grass highlights. This stuff is very smooth with a healthy effervescence. The musky quality comes through to make it interesting. Some sweet toffee in there too. Highly drinkable and easily recommended as lagers go."
"Colorado Native is a total session beer. It manages to, ""combine the great hop and malt flavors of a pale ale with the soft, delicate features of a lager."" This is hands down the best Amber Lager I have tasted. If more Lagers tasted like this maybe Lager wouldn't be the curse word it appears to have become in the Craft Beer community. And maybe if the big boys brewed more beer like this, we wouldn't care so much about words like Craft."
"Opinion: Well, this is an OK beer. I will drink the whole thing which is something to say for one of the big three. I am glad that I only got this one bottle in a ""build your own six-pack"" deal at the local liquor store. It might be OK for someone who has been brainwashed by the big three and is starting to think for themselves...otherwise there are a whole lot of better beers out there."
"Not a bad lager, like a macro but with a little more."
"Tastes like the second runnings of sam Adams BL."
"Edit- As I finished the last few gulps of this beer I found I really enjoyed it more than I had as I wrote this during the first half of the experience. I bumped up my drinkability and mouthfeel marks."
"Overall a very average beer in a state full of exceptional ones."
"D: This is an OK amber. It carries more flavor than most Coors offerings, which was a nice change of pace. The lightness makes it an easy drinker."
"Bottle. Pours a reddish amber color with a slightly tan head. More red in appearance than I would have expected. I haven't had a lager in a while so this should be interesing. The aroma immediatly reminded me of walking through the Coors brewery when I was younger. Strong aroma of sweet malt and sweet corn. A slight hoppiness in the beginning followed by a subtle sweetness. The aroma is really the downfall on this one to me. Medium/light mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness. It's not terrible but it's not good either."
"I'm not sure why, but I felt I had to try this one. I blame my never being west of Iowa City before. It pours a clear copper topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises a decent bit o' caramel, countered by a stark bit o' hoppiness, mostly sharp pine and slightly less sharp ruby red grapefruit. The taste is identical. 'Nuff said. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a decent brew, highly drinkable, not all that complicated. Now we've got about 49 more Native brews to craft..."
"A perfectly fine American style lager gussied-up with a little roasted malt for color, is my guess. Anyone expecting the likes of a Märzen or Vienna lager will be dissapointed."
"This is really rather well done. Not earth shattering by any means, but then it's an amber lager. It isn't supposed to redefine craft beer. As it is, it's a good beer worth trying. Nice to see the big boys know how to do good beers too, eh?"
"Tastes wonderful. Light malt, strong hop flavor, and clean hop bitter that is crisp at the end like you get in a good czech pils. Each of these dimensions is balanced with the others, though the carbonation makes too strong of an acrid sting (so, swirl the beer to address that concern). Malt is mostly bready sweet with a hint of light-colored caramel. Hop flavor is lemony, earthy, grapefruit pithy, and a light hint of basil sweet. The pith works quite well with the clean hop bitter. By the end of the glass, the beer is coming across as quite hoppy bitter, almost to the point of minerally. I wonder if the brewer added calcium carbonate during the mash. The aftertaste sees a reappearance of the malt sweet. Md light body and very drinkable (keep in mind that I'm quite a hop-head)."
"Drinkability was very good. Clean beer, well balanced. Good summer session beer."
"D: Easily drinkable with all the well-blended balance of a good lager. Light abv helps too."
"On tap at Old Chicago Westy. Color was somewhat of an amber (amberish if that's a word); a slight floral aroma. Hoppier than most Coors' products--very surprised. Taste was slightly sweet and quite quaffable. A pleasant surprise. Doubtful I'd buy a sixer of it but if I'm ""forced"" to choose amongst a few BMC offerings, I'd look for this one."
"Finally found this one in the mix six cooler so I figured I'd give it a try. Not at all what I was expecting. Poured a nice copper-amber color, with a bit of ecru foam. Aromas of sweet malt and caramel. Nothing too overwhelming on the palate, but a very nice malty body, with just a hint of spicy hops. A very pleasant surprise."
"A good lager with some hops presence that has a good malt backbone that makes me think of a marzen. Price point is about right. I like this better than SA Noble Pils and Boston Lager which I think it competes with. Definitely worth a try."
"Bottom line, I wanted to hate it, and I can't find much fault with it. Kind of reminds me of Boston Lager. Kind of octoberfesty as well. All and all, damn solid brew."
"Another interesting note. This beer is made with all Colorado ingredients from Monte Vista barley to hops from near Montrose. On tap I've found this brew to be a good go-to in the summer. Good stuff from Coors? Yes!"
