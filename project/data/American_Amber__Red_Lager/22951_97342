While not a session beer, there was enough to like here without this feeling weak or watered-down and this was about as balanced a beer as I've had for this style. A bit of brown sugar would have made this stand out more but as it was, I enjoyed this more than I would most other lagers, because of how much it resembled an ale. Worth a go one for anyone who loves balanced beers or American Ambers.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 18, 2014"

3.73,-1.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, bright, amber coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a thin, sparse, off-white surface coat of head. Aromas of tangy sweet caramel, resiny and piney hops, grapefruit and mango sweet, and a subtle roasting. Flavors are roast and rich caramel sweet forward, with a very quick hops bitterness to follow. Tropical fruit notes combine with the piney notes to balance the rich, sweet backbone. Light, effervesced body keeps this beer very drinkable, with a tangy, tropical sweet aftertaste. Clean, effervescent finish with a subtle drying. Very drinkable and refreshing.","GarthDanielson","Sep 20, 2013"

Sweet caramel flavor along with toffee, hazelnut, some dark fruit, biscuit and graham cracker. Well balanced, flavorful and decently drinkable.

As usual with Clown Shoes beer, the glass is almost empty by the time my review is coming to a close. It feels rather full-bodied for a beer only 6% ABV, and it also fully coats the mouth, as I would prefer. Overall an American Amber Lager is is a vague style, and may not conjure the most excitement when compared to others. Thankfully Clown Shoes took a little bit of an experimental approach that yielded a very flavorful, yet easily drinkable beverage. If you're bored of the average lager, definitely give this one a try - especially if you're an IPA fan, as it bares some resemblance to East coast IPAs and to things like Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe IPA. You've gotta love that name, too!","Neorebel","Aug 07, 2013"
