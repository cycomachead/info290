That would be the reason for this purchase. When I returned to my home in Missouri I looked up ZiegenBock on the web. It apparently has had a very colorful life, one point I thought interesting was that it is only sold in Texas... I bought my sixer on a fishing trip in Arkansas? and must say that regardless of where it's sold...I won't be buying again.","Boca-X","Feb 26, 2014"

2.09,-25.6,3,2.75,1.5,2,2.25,"A friend of mine brought me back a little mix-pack from Texas. He doesn't know a lot about craft beers, but the sentiment was nice. Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a muddled, clear, light brown coloring with a thin ring of off-white film around the surface. Aromas are subtle, with a blending of roast and sugary caramel sweetness. Flavors are watery at best, with a touch of sweet on the mid-tongue and really nothing else. I mean, there's a dose of carbonation to sharpen up the nothingness. Wow, this is like carbonated water. There's really no aftertaste because there is no taste taste. Maybe a touch of caramel, but that is really reaching. Carbonated and watery in mouth. The finish is light and clean, because there really isn't anything to linger behind. Jesus, this was a stretch to get much of anything out of this one.","GarthDanielson","Mar 13, 2013"

However, if you're looking for a bock, this is much further from the real thing than a shiner. If you're looking for a refreshing water beer, this is better than Shiner AND most water beers. But other than just enough hops to make it nice and crisp, there is NO FLAVOUR aside from a weird annoying aftertaste. The best point about this beer is its keg price. It competes with the bottom of the barrel in keg prices. I don't know how. Keystone might be the only keg cheaper than this. If you're throwing a party and wondering whether to get Bud Light, High Life, Ziegenbock or anything else that costs under $90, it's an easy choice. Get this!

The flavor was of sweet malt, nutmeg, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall I was not a fan of this at all.

2.21,-21.4,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Brewed by A-B, the packaging looks like something from Michelobe, so I'm not expecting much. The best thing about this beer is the appearance right after the pour - an amber, caramel colored body with a thick, whitish head. A faint smell of caramel sweetness barely reaches the nose. The body is very thin (I'd hate to taste the light version) and tastes watered down. Sort of like a Bud with some caramel flavoring. I wouldn't want anymore of this, even if it was available in my state. It could be very drinkable, if only I liked it. It's one of those beers that you could drink a lot of due to its light body and carbonation. Their web site states: "Only Texans Get It." Well, they can have it.","jhammerly","Jul 28, 2006"

Yuk and double yuk. No balance, no real flavor. The usual AB corn-rice filler is ever present. Carbonation is about right. Not a bock at all. Just amber colored. I guess it's kinda like that new Ultra Amber junk. I can't imagine how brewers put out product like this and expect people to buy it. Of course, it's like a buddy of mine said once: "You can just mix any crap up, slap some sort of label on it and somebody will buy it." Guess that's right.","spaceranger","May 17, 2006"
2.43,-13.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"The sign in the airport bar announced "Only Texans Get It." On sampling the beer, I had to wonder why they would particularly want it. Pretty easy to peg in the amber lager category, so I was let down that I wasn't getting a bock beer (they should at least be honest enough to call it "Ziegenamber"). Some middle-of-the-road malt flavor, a bit grainy with adjunct notes. A chocolate note in the malt faltered and faded before making any impression.","Brent","Apr 30, 2006"

3.3,17.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Likely the best AB product i've had. Pours out to an odd caramel brown color with some dark gold notes. A big head of white foam quickly calms to about 1/4 of an inch. Medium to medium high carbonation and little lacing. Aromas of buttery yeast and malt are suprisingly enjoyable, as a sweet grain element rears it's head in there as well. Taste is medium-light bodied, but still fair; caramel malts and roasted notes make way for some sweet and mild hops, followed by the ever-present AB wash out. The flavors die a quick death on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a step above others, as there is some density and crispness to the beer. Drinkability is north of average. AB should seriously consider marketing this outside of Texas, becase for what it is, it isn't bad. Worth a try. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample.","Frozensoul327","Mar 11, 2006"

I'm surprised that this has so much praise if Bud Light is an avoid. AB beers a lot of the time taste watered down. This beer is smooth for a bock, but that's not a good thinkg IMO. It doesn't have that bitter bite that I expect from a bock beer. It's a bock beer for the non beer drinker.","jasonjlewis","Feb 16, 2006"

3.17,12.8,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"I had this one on tap, in an Texas airport. Its a light, transparent amber color with a respectable white head. The nose is of lightly roasted, toasted malt. Its not a strong smell, but its attractive and is vaguely reminiscent of bread-crust. Theres a little caramel in the taste, which is teasingly malty. Finish has a touch of hop bitterness. I certainly wouldnt use the word Bock on this beer. Its a fairly thin and uninspiring brew. Still, theres nothing particularly wrong with it. Satisfying but average.","Suds","Jul 24, 2005"

2.35,-16.4,1.5,4,2,1,2,"Overall Impression: This is an excellent, well-rounded bock that someone has poured into a gallon of water. What is there is good, but far too watered down to be enjoyable. The “bock” name must be from the same Texas Alcohol Laws that make Shiner call itself “bock”, but neither of these beers are a true Bock. Drinkability is equivalent to water, you can drink a lot of that, but not going to scratch any beer itch you may have. I guess I could recommend this beer if you are very thirsty, but don’t want a beer.","HardTarget","Feb 02, 2003"

The head was white and in good contrast to the dark brown liquid. Too bad it went away so fast. The aroma maybe had a hint of roasted. The taste was of malt with a little sweetness. The hops were not present in either the taste or the aroma. Or maybe this beer is so well balanced I could not detect them The mouthfeel was very light and had no creaminess.

I have to say, its like it national sister, Amber-bock in ways. Although alittle darker, it pours a dark brown with a foam soft white head. Lace was hard to come by. Taste is more malt, very little hop. The mouth starts out carbonated ( fizz-like ) but the mouth is left dry. A very drinkable, smooth brew that goes well with burgers & cookout type fair.
