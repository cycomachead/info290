I know they plan on doing more releases in the future of the more regular offerings and maybe they will offer up some of their stouts in six packs, because that is really where this brewery shines.","humuloner22","Jan 10, 2015"

1.99,-40.2,4,3,1.5,1.25,1.5,"Although this beer is OK for appearance and smell, taste is just OK, the 3.7 alcoholic content barely rates this as a beer. I gave it a rating as a one because I want my beer to be real beer and not just a beverage. It didn't rate high enough in the other areas to consider it decent. So I gave it a low rating. Because beer should be beer and 3 % alcohol doesn't equate to beer in my book! Have you tried the rating scale on weak beverages? I'm from NC and I truly wanted to rate this beer higher but honestly I can't.","Kilyena","Apr 15, 2014"

3.35,0.6,4,4,3,2.5,3.5,"o - overall at $3.99 for 22oz, it was worth a shot. the mouthfeel really distracts me from the flavor qualities that i am digging here. decent session beer, but not something i will seek out again. good fora pour, but 22oz of this is a bit much for me.","cosmicevan","Dec 15, 2012"

3.06,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Strong, malty aroma has a yeasty overtone but is otherwise about average. It pours a clear dark coppery brown with a fairly thick, slightly yellowish light tan head. Malty flavor has yeasty and grassy notes with just a hint of apple, nothing special but still enjoyable. Texture is quite fizzy but just a bit on the thin side. Overall, a decent if not outstanding brew.","Cyberkedi","Jan 26, 2012"

3.7,11.1,3,3,4,4,4,"Smooth and creamy mouth on this one. Really a mellow gulper. Nice sweet malty backbone with plenty of nutty flavor that I really liked. Caramel and toffee notes noted. This really was a refreshing beer to sip while waiting for my food. I definitely much preferred this on-tap to the bottle form. But this makes me want to revisit it for sure. Another solid offering from OHB.","Onenote81","May 09, 2011"
3.63,9,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Amber to Ruby in color. Duh? With a thin but lasting cream colored head. Sweet aromas with a fair amount of nuttiness. Caramel flavored with said nuttiness. Minimal hop flavors. Maybe some earthy hops for balance. Silky smooth mourhtfeel. Good session beer.","wcudwight","Apr 03, 2011"
2.22,-33.3,4,2,1.5,3,3,"Pours a nice looking dark reddish orange almost ruby color with a thick off white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of nuts, malts, and a little hop aroma. Tastes of a little slight hops, tons of nuts, and a total ton of malts. Mouthfeel is medium with a ton of carbonation. Drinkability is not the best.","TheKingofWichita","Feb 24, 2011"
1.79,-46.2,3.5,2,1.5,3,1,"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a very minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. This is where it went downhill.... The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutmeg, and burnt hair (WTF!?!?!?). The flavor was of burnt malt, nutmeg, and the taste of how burnt hair smells (OMG!). It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall holy Christ this was bad... It was just not appealing in any aspect. Burnt hair... REALLY!?!? If I'm honest I wouldn't drink this again if it gave me a ruby everytime I took a sip. Just not worth it. However I might keep this in mind for when I want to play a cruel joke on a not-so-good friend.","thagr81us","Jan 17, 2011"
3.72,11.7,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Pours a deep red, maybe a tad lighter than something I would call ""ruby"" but it's getting there. The beer has a medium head that retains it's self nicely. Some fruity and bready malt shows up in the aroma along with mild vegetal notes. Generally it smells nice enough but the aroma is pretty reserved all together. The flavor is really very nice, and consequently a mildly roasty fruity lager with some mild snappy hops is pretty much exactly what I'm in the mood for at the moment. I'm glad I decided to open this up. There's not a whole lot to dig into here, it's a very clean cery malt forward beer that is really well balanced with a bit of zesty hop bitterness. Very full flavored for a >4% beer.","BieresDesMoines","Dec 20, 2010"
3.63,9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clean and well balanced ... not much else you can ask for right? Easily marked as a session beer and a good one at that.","Jason","Apr 11, 2010"
4.18,25.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: I enjoyed this one. Keenly drinkable -- it's got just enough flavor, the right amount of hops to balance, a slender body, and a graciously low ABV. I cleared through the entire bomber in record time, by the time the Pinback song ""Grey Machine"" had finished, I was done.","ChainGangGuy","Mar 07, 2010"
3.57,7.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Another OH iffering that has popped up here in GSO.Poured a clear amber/bronze with a very minimal head that was gone quickly.A nice mix of caramel malt and toast in the nose,it really stuck out nicely.Big caramel and toasted flavors with a a light smack of herbal hop in the finish.Its not a world beater,but its not bad for the style.","oberon","Dec 31, 2009"
