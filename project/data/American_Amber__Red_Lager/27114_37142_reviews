"03/28/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. When I saw the dark color I thought it would be more Hoppy or bitter then it was. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - Very nice lager, flavorful. I enjoyed it and would gladly have another. While it did not blow me away, it was a very solid basic craft beer."

"Overall - A very smooth, very drinkable and enjoyable lager from Coney Island. The flavor won't blow you away, but it's good, and the smooth delivery makes it all the better. Does this come in sixers?"
""
""
""
"Either this was a bad bottle or I'm just not a fan...."
""

"I've been sick of ales, and went looking for some high quality lagers, was recommended this by the owner of the craft beer store where i shop and was really blown away by the mellow, smooth, taste of this beer, just the right amount of hops and dryness adds a perfect compliment to the malty sweetness, although that flavor is also mild. a great addition to my list of good lagers."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice fruity presence but the mouthfeel is a bit too flat for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light coppery amber with around two fingers of light butterscotch foam. Aroma is mellow, pilsner malt, a bit of toast, maybe a hint of green apple. Standard lager nose. Palate was malt galore, toasty bread sticks and some citrus pith. Nice hops to balance the malt with little discernable sweetness. Hops are a bit peppery, vegetal/herbal, perhaps a hint of rhubarb sourness. A metallic ting in the finish. I am an ale drinker by preference but this sort of malty, hoppy lager makes a nice change of pace. Could be a bit sweeter."
"Its smooth and peaceful sailin' from here on out with a cool wind bringing up the aft and no swells in sight. A great beer to celebrate your victories and reflect on your defeats with."

"Look, this is the beer you use to introduce your friends to the better beer world! This lager is the most refreshing, tasty, and satisfying lager I have ever had. This one has a perfect level of carbonation that balances out the mouthfeel perfectly. The taste is still a lager, which means not as flavorful as an ale or stout but this is much better than bud."

"This lager is very unique and quite tasty. It is a fairly hard beer to obtain around here, or I might drink it more."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a copper color with a thick off white head and lots of bubbles rising from the bottom. The aroma is crisp with some lemon, grain, grass and a hint of caramel. It tastes bitter up front with pine and lemon, with a hint of grain. It is nice and refreshing with a perfect amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Overall this is a really good beer that I would make a top choice if it was widely available."

"Overall there are much better beers out there, and this was sadly disappointing."

"O: Not bad by any means, but it doesn't do anything new or interesting."
""
""
""
"O: While I gravitate toward ales, I really liked this lager. It has a wealth of interesting flavors, good balance of malt and hops, and a clean finish that sits satisfyingly on the stomach. I would buy again, especially on sale at Kroger for $3.75."
""
""
""
""
"O) A decent brew. Not you normal run-of-the-mill lager."
""
""
""

""
""
"I generally find lagers to be kind of plain. This one was fantastic. I randomly picked it up in a backwoods grocery store (22) and was happy I did. Had a really nice caramel-ly darkish flavor with a nice mouthfeel. Fantastic. Really good beer if you don't want something heavy but can't stand light, cheap tasting beer. I would love to have this out of a keg, since I heard it's even better that way."
""
""
""
""
""
"With the creepy Coney-island face on the front, this large bottle pours an amber color with a modest white head. Good clarity. The aroma has a little malt, with a touch of wood, smoke, and peppery spice. It's not a usual clean lager smell. The flavor is of light and amber malt, a bit of grain, and twigs...interesting. The beer is of medium body, with a lingering hop and malt mouthfeel. Better than average and interesting, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be a good beer in the right setting but overall nothing too spectacular."
""
""
"Drinkability: Decent Lager to add to the rotation, but difficult to find here."
""
""
"On-tap this beer has a distinct caramel (almost burnt caramel) taste that is delicious! I took home some of the bottled version and tasted a much different beer. The bottle had only a hint of caramel. Still enjoyable, but a point lower overall due to the loss of flavor compared to tap."
""
"This is a pleasantly crafted amber lager easy drinking but with enough flavor to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep auburn into a 1/2 liter stein with a thick slightly off white crown that left multiple rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Alot of yeast and bread dough aromas with mild caramel sweetness and even more mild leafy hops.Flavors are yeast driven with sweetish pizza dough,drunken fruit, and caramel notes with the hops being lighter than expected.This is a yeast assertive amber lager but it's pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this one is hard to characterize. What I know is that it isn't memorable and the aroma is almost non existent. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"O: An impressive lager, but that being said, not complex or intense in flavor or fragrance"

"Pours copper with thin, off-white head. Nose has sharp floral, slightly metallic hops, some butterscotch. Aroma is mild overall. Flavor is soft bread, very lightly sweet, mild buttery notes. Prominent bitter citrus-like hop background. Citrus and slightly floral resiny bitterness and a very mild tartness linger on the palate."
""
""
"The beer had a lighter feel to it and it was crisp and refreshing. This could be a lager that I keep in the beer fridge more often for regular consumption. Overall, this is a very good lager."
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, like most of the Shmaltz offerings. It's definitely an off-center beer, whatever style you call this. Quite drinkable and pleasant. It does take the prize for one of the wackiest labels ever, the scary Coney Island freak face."
""
"Poured out a standard transparent amber color with one finger of white foam that sticks around for about a minute, texturally medium bodied and gently carbonated. Smells of Czech-hopping spiciness + earth tones over a cracker / light biscuit malt, flavor presents hop forward as well. I get a hit of the Czech spice on toast that bleeds into orange peels and a nice extended resinous finish. Pretty good, but not as memorable as most of Shmaltz's other products IMO."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty disappointing brew, to be honest. I've found the Coney Island branding to be genuinely substandard to the He'Brew branded beers, and this is no exception. Worst of all, while this could be a reasonable session brew, the 5.5% ABV puts it slightly out of that range. It's a shame."
""
"Drink- I will outwardly admit. I drank this a few years ago, never reviewed it and am only drinking this for the style tick. I can say with the yeast and pils and malts. Not really a good combo for me."
""
"I liked the look of the orangish amber color this gave off in the glass. It seemed to lighten up toward the top with a decent head that retained quite a bit. The beer has some hoppy character to it, I can smell it all over the nose. its very aromatic imo. The taste was mirror to the smell and I felt a rush of hops about halfway and up to the finish. Also I get some toasty bread in the their up front and continues in the background of the mouthful. I feel like I'm drinking a pale ale, which obviously this is an amber ale. I'd give the hop character similar or a little stronger to that of a sierra nevada. It definetly stays on my pallet for a while. This isn't to take away from the beer, although I think I prefer the hops taste to take a more conservative role in a beer. All in all, this beer is decent, I'd drink it again, but I think I'd stick to just a pint or so and move on to something else."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the better Amber Ales I've had. It's a beer that is perfect for any occasion, thanks to it's easy drinkability and flavor. It's a well rounded beer that gets the job done."
"*Postscript: Apparently it's not a pilsner. Maybe it's the lagering but I definitely picked up on hints of a pilsner-like yeast flavor profile."

"This is really a tough one to review. It's solid in every way, shape, and form. It's a sweet red lager with a bit of hoppiness on the finish. It looks fine, laces fine, smells fine, and goes down easily. I'm not thrilled by it at all though. Especially considering the price it commands. I mean, it's alright, and is probably a solid choice on tap. Bottles though? I wouldn't bother."
"A pretty good beer all-around and I really tried to downgrade it for some reason. Give it a try."
"Carbonation could be a little lower."
"O - I'll pass on this next time, really cool label though"
"Overall, I didn't care for it too much. Reminded me of an amped up Dos Equis."
"Pours a rich amber color. Stiff off white head that sits around for a bit. Lots of sweet barley taste with enough hop to dry it out some. Not the biggest lager fan... but this is great stuff. Didn't have high hopes after trying their ""Sword Swallower", but this offering has redeemed them a bit. I'd definitely get this again if it was a single and I didn't have to get the whole mixed 12 pack. Try it if you get the chance."
"Overall: A nicely complex and very tasty lager. Very bold flavor and nicely balanced. On of the better American lagers out there."
"Pours a red amber hue which leaves a rather frothy two finger bubble laden head,the smell is creaming soda,sweet malts and caramel,the mouthfeel is light bodied and sessionable with tastes of caramel candy,toffee,ripe berries and at the finish i get this weird but nice mix of the flowery hops along with the czech pilsner yeast and overall its a very different Amber/Red but easy enough to knock back cheers."
"O- Ok beer, not in love with it but I would drink another. Not really my style of beer but one of the better lagers I have had."
"This beer has gotten plenty of reviews, so I'll skip any in-depth analysis and explain why this is a favorite. It starts with the nose - delightfully roasty and nutty. One reviewer called it a carnival of flavors, and I agree. Yes, some clash a tiny bit with others, but the sheer complexity is a great sipping puzzle. Rolling it around thoughtfully on the tongue yields an ever-changing list of tastes. It's squarely in my Top 20 list if only because it is over the top in comparison to some other great beers that lack this complexity."
"Nice medium amber/copper colour, one finger white head, good retention, some lace. Smell is malty, grassy hops, earthy with floral notes, graham cracker like quality. Taste is malty with some biscuit, lightly earthy, floral and grassy, not an overly complex beer but quite nice. Light-med carb, full feel, medium body. Good stuff, not great but it is enjoyable, straight forward and inoffensive."
"O: An easier-to-drink Coney Island. Very nice amber, with a bitter sweet tingle. I'd have it again, if only for the purely evil cheshire grin on the bottle."
"Lager drinkers this one's for you. Ale drinkers you'll probably want to avoid. Not a bad beer, but rather one dimensional and not really memorable."
"Taste pretty sweet up front, with some caramel/molasses notes, this beer allegedly a variety of hops added but I got little hop character or bitterness, perhaps this bottle is a bit old. I found it a bit to sweet/malty/unbalanced. DOes have a nice mouthfeel/carbonation to it, a good beer to have with a meal as it is not too filling on its own. A nice beer but nothing special, you can get equally/better beers in cheaper 6packs."
"I had fun with this beer, which I had on tap at Dorian Gray's in lower Manhattan. At first I thought the waiter got the order wrong - with the excellent head, a slighty carmel citrus nose, and the fairly deep red amber hue, it certainly didn't look like lager material. And it tasted more like a pale ale or IPA. When I looked at the list of ingredients online, I understood better - they've thrown a wild variety of malts and yeast into this one. Here's yet another beer where the artwork let's you know what you're in for - a flavor carnival. Classic? Maybe not - perhaps there's a little too much going on here, but the mix of full body, moderate sweetness, and the hopped-up finish makes it enjoyable. I'd have another."
"O: Overall there is a taste in this brew that does not match up, a very sweet character that sends the balance off. Roasted note is warm, but a bit too powerful"
"Pours a orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, small caramel and standard lager like smells. In the taste, small sweet roast with a note of caramel and a saaz like hop. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small pils like hop in the aftertaste. Nice but average, somewhat Yuengling like."
"O: Incredibly refreshing and clean lager. Very balanced and quite tasty. Great for summer!"
"O - overall, this is a very interesting beer. The finish in particular was very enjoyable and gave a lot of life to this beer. I will definitely be coming back to this."
"O: Pilsner – really? The best part of this beer was probably the label. The beer itself was interesting but nothing I would have on hand all the time."
"O:The color, texture, taste and the finish of Coney Island are so similar to Brooklyn Lager that I wonder if there isn't an Adirondack beer mafia selling the same brew with different labels. Coney Island seems less assertive and long-lived than Brooklyn. But it's a very enjoyable beer. I'll stick with Brooklyn as a go-to beer because it's less expensive!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color lager with a nice foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of lightly caramelized malt is quite enjoyable. Taste of biscuit malt is very refreshing with limited complexity. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation as well. Well brewed and easily drinkable which I bet was the goal of this one."
"The beer pours a hazy brown/orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and caramel malts with some grass notes mixed in. The beer also smells a little bit like iced tea. The flavor is tea, earth, grass and biscuit malts. Very easy to drink and the alcohol is completely hidden. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O- in the end, the thing that takes away from this being a great beer is the lack of balance between the malt and hops. outside of that, this is a solid beer, considering style or not."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down smooth, and I could easily drink a 6-pack of this on a hot summer day. Overall, I thought it was a decent beer, and I'd try it again."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking, very sessionable beer. Nothing about it is great, but it is good overall."
"Nice stuff, easy to drink and worth trying if you are looking for a lager."
"D: Nice easy drinking beer; a fine lager"
"a nice hopped up lager with a big malt backbone, I like the tropical fruits with sweet malt it works well and I could see myself drinking this again"
"This beer is really smooth. Its a nice brew, well balanced with flavor, carbonation and all around. It's nothing out of this world but its a good brew. I didn't know what to expect but it was a nice lager beer. Basically, good for what it is..."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some malts. Taste is good, malts, a caramel sweetness with some hop bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"This is the first of the Coney Islands I have tried, and I gotta say, it's pretty damn good. I bought it cause it stood out with its bright colors and 22 oz. bottle, and I'll admit I wasn't expecting it to be this good. It truly is beautiful with all its hop-majesty and smooth lacing. Its great for hangin out or taking a few to a get-together for a nice start. I will definitely buy this one again, its a very fun and interesting take on lagers. Oh by the way mine was carbonated like a ginger ale, I don't know what happened to the other folks'."
"8 malts? 6 hops? The Czech Pilsner yeast I can understand as it is clean and does not support the hop bitterness at all in my opinion. They sell these for $20 bucks a 12 pack around Chicago. Por que?"
"D- I had to force this one down sip by sip."
"My pour netted me just over a finger of bubbly tawny head with good retention. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was on the sweet side, but accompanied by a slightly piney bitterness. Mouthfeel was medium with a honey-like sweetness on the tongue. It evinced a slight bitterness on the finish and then returned to a honey-like sweetness on the extreme finish. It was okay, but not compelling enough to make me want more of it."
"This is a very solid beer. I've been trying a mixed pack of beers in the Coney Island brand and they're all good, and this one is one of the best. I would definitely drink this year round."
"In every sip such a swift change in direction from malty to hoppy; to find such endowment in both maltiness and hoppiness - for a lager no less - is the product of a generous brewer with high-standards. Coney Island Lager is awfully reminiscent of its neighborhood counterpart, Brooklyn Lager. Whether it's something in the water or what, who knows, but that borough can definitely lay claim to two of NYC's best lagers."
"Pours light copper with a nice white head and a good deal of lacing. The nose brings forward a pretty good amount of biscuit malt as well as some light hops. Good bready flavors throughout. Light to medium body with good carbonation. In the end, a nice craft example of the style and drinks quite well. Very good for what it is."
"Drinkability - I think this is a great beer for just chilling out. I happen to be clearing out e-mails and this just hit the spot. - 4.5/5.0"
"D - with the balance of flavor and smooth texture, this would make for an easy drinker any time of year!"
"Draft version is pretty much the same, hard to have lagers on draft for me. Very good though."
"Pours like a traditional amber lager, semi clouded nice khaki tan head forms minimal lacing between sips. Aroma fruity caramel malt notes, slightly spicy with a floral edge. Flavor has a dry back end with a bunch of upfront sweetness interesting blend, there are competing flavors here that don't seem to agree with each other spicy malts dry yeast strain American hop bitterness from teh cascades. I don't know, it's not my favorite. Mouthfeel is light bodied dry bitter harshness, carbonation is a bit spritzy making the mouthfeel rougher than it has to be. Drinkability overall for me, leaves me in confusion. Not an average style, I question the flavors I'm getting whether or not they work together...I'm going to try their hoppy pale lager."
"D - tastes GOOD... sessionable. nice approach at a lager, unfortunately, if one doesnt search around here for a lager (like Victory), they'll settle for a Yuengling and perhaps think the brew style peaks there."
"Love the concept and cause. The plus? The beer is pretty damn good too. Kudos to Shmaltz for coming up with the Coney Island Lager series. We need more lagers! Beer freaks and geeks rejoice!"
"This is an enjoyable beer, but considering I cannot get it in Texas, I probably won't drive far to get it."
"Sure, but in no particular hurry."
"A pretty hefty lager, enjoyable for its near-balance, and lovely intensity."
"D: The beer wasn't that difficult to consume. I might considering trying this again because it had tons of hops for a lager, which seems rather unique."
"D - This is a pretty good beer thats pretty basic and easy to drink I could probably drink a few of these in a sitting worth a try"
"Lager is a bit smooth and slick, and leaves the palate nicely moist."
"Dark golden red brew gives a half inch of light tan foam from a heavy pour. Settles to almost nothing, no lace to speak of. Nose is a robust malty semi-dark sweetness, same thing on the tongue. A little citrus and bitter hop in the finish. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, pretty filling, a good drinker."
"D - Quite a delicious lager, goes down smooth and offers some unique flavours. Easily drinkable with some strong flavours, but mild enough for anyone seeking something that won't overload the taste buds!"
"D- this beer seems to be ubiquitous on the west coast and east coast. Where is this stuff made anyway. Listed as San Francisco, yet says it is brewed in NY? It is a fine malty beer that is eas to drink, but nothing crazy here. I would pick this over some beers, but would not seek this out per se."
"Malty like an Oktoberfest, spicy like an American Amber an interesting mix. My bottle was rather still and I find a very drinkable beer under here. Some day I look forward to having this one tap some day and will rerate. Found this as part of the Coney Island Mix pack."
"Part of the Coney Island mixed 12 pack... a pretty standard sounding beer from the get go. Pours a nice looking copper color, small to medium head to it. Great mouthfeel, medium body, get some caramel sort of malts in there, some nice hoppiness comes through. Finish is clean and smooth... pretty solid beer overall, won't knock your socks off but very drinkable and tasty."
"Pours a dark brownish/amber with a thin off-white head. Smell is sweet dopplebock style malts. Taste is tart malt up front, with a slightly mineral water taste in the middle, and a grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation. Good drinkability, I would get this again."
"Shmaltz Brewing Company--Coney Island Lagers--Coney Island Lager--2008 22 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 30 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) Pale Lager. Rich creamy lacy off white head. Clear rich amber gold color. Sediment hint. Malty mild hop front. Mellow sweet mildly creamy malty smooth rich caramel body. Cloying malt mild hop spice end. 8 Malts 6 Hops Typical Complicated Formulation detracts from flavor. Sampled 9/13/2009. 2 @ $4.99 Each."
"It's a nice clean lager, but after that doesn't justify the price tag."
"I've had this in bottle before too, and I think that it is much better on draft than in bottle, so if you have the chance get this on draft."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a nice grain taste to it. Slight aftertaste but its not bad. Good midpalate presence. Mildly sweet up front, creamy body, minimal carbonation on the palate. highly drinkable."
"MF -"
"Very good for a lager. Nothing to scream at, but I'd definitely drink another if the situation arose."
"This is an OK beer. Again nothing wrong, but nothing to write home about."
"I found it easy to drink and enjoyable, but the flavor is just a tad too basic for me to keep drinking this all night. It's a good beer and I enjoyed this bomber, but this is not something I would seek out; I'll drink it again, but I like some of the other more flavorful Coney Island beers much better."
"D: Smooth, well balanced and full flavored mix making each next sip is as enjoyable as the last."
"drinkability: not a fan and will not drink again, but I have had way worse"
"I couldn't handle more then one and I wouldn't go out of my way to find one again...That said I have enjoyed this one enough...."
"This is definitely a highly drinkable amber lager, though the slight pilsner aftertaste (not the biggest fan of pilsners) detracts slightly. However, that's a subjective opinion and I would reach for this repeatedly, especially when paired with foods such as fries."
"this is a decent beer, nothing out of this world but worth a try."
"I am in disbelief at how good this lager tasted to me after sitting in my hot garage for the better part of two years unrfridgerated! And I'm not even that big a fan of lagers in general. This lager shows a fairly clear copper color with a big off-white clumpy head with decent lacing. The aroma is very weak but some wheaty malt floats out that is pleasant. The flavor comes on with lots more creamy malt and a nice little herbal/pine hop kiss. Surprisingly tastey, medium bodied for the style, finely carbonated and very drinkable. It's smooth and a bit creamy for a lager. Sweet malt is the theme here, and what a nice version of a lager. This is as enjoyable as any lager I've had. A quality brew with great flavor, probably my new favorite lager."
"pours a murky orange amber color huge head over four fingers that just holds and holds with a fair lace. smells spicey, woody, fruity. taste spicey lots of malt, slight citrus comes through followed by bitter hops definitely has a big taste. light to medium body and a lively crisp carbonation. very good but i don't think i could made it a session beer."
"D - Too trying would tire fast."
"Drinkability: Really easy to drink, very rewarding. There really is nothing to fault about this beer: it is truly outstanding."
"The smell is pretty strong with a large floral aroma with sweet malt and hops. The taste is flavorful with sweet malt,bitter hops,and bread yeast. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A very good lager, I can see myself having alot of these."
"taste is of malt, popcorn, grain, some hops, dry grass, touch of citrus, and a touch of caramel, ends a somewhat dry and a little bitter."
"Overall, this beer was delightful. It didn't blow me away with any amazing flavor but it felt good drinking it and my stomach was happy afterwards! I would definitely drink it again!"
"D: One and done."
"D: A appropriate beer for any day of the year, with it's malt and hop profile working well"
"was ok to drink, but i got tired of it pretty quick. not the best"
"Very cool looking bottle."
"Drinkability is good. This would pair well with about 100 types of summer food and the flavor is mellow and easy to down."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pilsner and bisquit malt scent along with a mild hop aroma. There is also a bit of crystal malt sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a sweet crystal malt flavor with hints of bisquit character. The hop profile is nice, but the taste is still more on the sweet side. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with low carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, although it too sweet for an amber lager."
"Quite drinkable."
"amber, small receding head. Smell has sweet toasty malt, some citrusy hops. Hop bitterness is more assertive in the flavor, along with bready, toasty malt. Some caramel sweetness Long dry finish. Medium carbonation. a nice lager showcasing a decent amount of hoppiness."
"According to the label - ""Schmaltz Brewing Co. invites you to witness the delectable alchemy of 8 malts, 6 hops & Czech pilsner yeast."""
"Pours out an amberish copper color. There was a little head maybe one to two finers. Smell was floral with a hint of hoppiness. The taste was of slight hops and slight fruityness. The mouthfeel had a little carbonation but was not overly carbonated. It was a decent beer that you could have a couple of but not drink over and over."
"I've had a couple of He'Brew beers and was really excited to try the lager line. This one pours a hazy copper to amber with a small head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of bready malt and dark fruit dominate on the nose. Tastes are similar to the aroma...some breadiness and dark fruit blended together nicely, but there aren't many hops to speak of here. There are major malt residuals here, like I just sucked down a syrup! This is overall a decent brew and, like the other lagers in this line, very easy to consume."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp light amber with a decent frothy head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a barely there amount of sweet malts. The taste is a decent amount of sweet malts and fruit with a nice lingering sweet finish. The beer is quite light and refreshing with decent carbonation. This is a decent summer beer, but not likely one I'd have again."
"D- Having lived in Brooklyn, I can see myself taking the ""F" train down to Coney Island for a Nathan's hotdog, a couple Lagers, and a ride on the Cyclone. Very good summer beer. Where's my blanket?"
"I've never been to Coney Island, but with this beer and a Nathan's brand hot dog on hand, I can pretend I did. A good beer overall."
"D: A good lager, not a beer you're going to be waxing poetic about, just a drinkable, give me some faire food and something to wash it down with, I think the Coney Island name fits. Good example of a malty East Coast lager."
"Pours a clear copper/honey with a giant tan foamy head. There is a ton of carbonation in this beer,so be careful. The smell is pretty strong with a large floral aroma with sweet malt and hops. The taste is flavorful with sweet malt,bitter hops,and bread yeast. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A very good lager, I can see myself having alot of these."
"I finally found this for a reasonable price ($3.49 a bomber), and I'm glad I didn't pay more than that. It's not a horrible beer, but it's too reminiscent of sour apple candy for my taste."
"D: A little hoppier than I'm used to for this type of brew, but very nice... Goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, reminds me a little of an IPA mixed with a Lager... well balanced. Worth looking into."
"when poured in to my glass it had a decent head.. going in to a light film.. and looks are a like reddish brown or copper color. and good carbonation.. smell was sweet and you could tell it had a hint of toasted grain from smell.. taste was nice and crisp malty and had a smooth taste of sweet and taost notes..great after taste not overpowering.. drinkablity is good and recomend more than one bomber bottle"
"D - Easily drinkable, this is a nice amber lager with dominant toasted malt notes. The malt character is not nearly as rich as in its European counterparts, and the dry, toasty finish eventually turns a bit astringent. Worth trying."
"D-Pretty decent drinkability although I'm not likely to reach for another as I finish this up. Definately one to revisit and toss back on a summer day when quenching thirst gets higher marks than complexity."
"I had this beer the other night in a bomber. The appearance was very enticing - almost looked like ice tea during the summer. The smell was honey and citrus. The taste was very strong in honey which is odd that I don't see that mentioned in a lot of the reviews. Drinkability for this is very high and I wish I could get a better price for it than $4.99 a bomber. This beer would be fantastic during the summer."
"While I have a bit of a grudge towards them, Schmaltz offers up some truly good beer. This one, which I've had on draught & in bottle, however, is not one of their best. A yellowy golden brown pour gives to nearly no head or lace. There is a sweet honey-malt aroma, that is rounded out with lemony hops in the tasting. A bit flat & bright in body, this lager serves it's purpose as a basic lager but no more. Maybe they ought to serve it in cans, further drawing out the retro-Coney theme?"
"Not what i expected. beer form Coney island Stinks. This poured with a dark amber color, very little head and no lacing. odor is unremarkable, similar to and macro Irish Red. taste is somewhat pleasant though. Fuller than most lagers with a nice finish. A great option over Budweiser, Killians or othe macro's."
"Drinkable smooth brew"
"Pours a coppery, somewhat hazey iced tea. Pretty quick, spritzy head and small, quick bubbles. Great toastd bread aroma mixed with some oolong tea leaf hops. Very crisp andild hoppy flavor profile. Tea and just a little mint goes very well with the toasted malts. Then there is a slow malty sweetness in the finish that linges with the bubbly carboation. Geeat dry, bubbly, malty sweet palate makes this beer insanely drinkable."
"This is a good lager that mixes hops in well. It's certainly a refreshing lager and league something of a tingly taste on the mouth. It's a very solid beer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and would probably have another. I had the opportunity to speak with one of their salesman at a beer dinner this past week in which he talked about Coney Island and what Schmaltz had put into this beer. I'm certain if he wouldn't have talked about this beer/brand I probably would have passed it by. A little pricey, but well worth the try."
"D - Not a session beer, but very nice, and I would definitely try it again."
"Overall- Delicious! $3.49 for a bomber and well worth it!"
"On New Year's Eve, I drank this beer (on tap!) the whole night, and I really enjoyed it. This is a really easy-to-drink beer; it's refreshing, pleasant-tasting, and smooth. I agree that this is a good party beer because it works on its own as a crowd-pleaser; all my friends seemed to like it too! I also really like the logo."
"All in all a good beer that could be tweaked a bit to be excellent. I'd buy it again, though. It definitely sticks out among the lagers on your average grocery store shelf."
"8/4/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Pours clear gold with a medium white head. Lager aroma of yeast, sugar, some hops. Watery, corny taste at first, but comes back later with more hops. A sugary cereal taste is prevalent throughout. Not great, but not bad. More of a comntrived marketing gimmick"
"Overall I was less than impressed. For some reason I've always steered clear of Schmaltz, and now I know why. This wasn't an absolutely terrible beer, but I can't see myself ever ordering one of these again. I'll try a few more of their beers, but I hope they get better."
"This ones an easy drinker and a nice example of a lager. Recommended!"
"I find this beer, crisp, refreshing and flavorful. This is a great beer drinking beer. Not hoppy, just malty, sweet and tasty. I tend to use this beer for parties because it doesn't come expecting a hardcore beer drinker's palate (like a hopslam might) and the logo is great."
"22 ouncer, no freshness info to be had. Pours pretty clear, orange tinged amber, light tan head, lose frothy and gauzy, this one leaves nice webs of lacing. Light whole wheat Bready nose. Pleasant enough stuff. Nicely balanced with soft, drying hops coming on late. Nothing hugely special going on here, just balanced, smooth, drinkable, sessionable stuff."
"Perhaps not as exciting as a day at the amusement park, it's worth a shot. A truly great Amber Ale (is that an oxymoron?) should be sessionable and interesting; Coney Island really only brings the interesting."
"As far as a lager, it's better than most."
"Good carbonation. Crisp feel, towards medium on spectrum of body, but still light. Goes down smooth. A pretty tasty, quaffable lager."
"Drinks easy, not a bad attempt at the style"
"Well, the farmhouse wasn't air conditioned and the fermentation was fast (so I heard over the phone, I wasn't going near the place again until it was pickup time) and the maker thought it might not be exactly what I was anticipating. And he was right; it was sort of an ale lager hybrid, kind of what I drinking now. Well, the Czech Amber Lager Ale is all gone but I still have, 10 years later, one bottle of the second case, oddly enough an extract barleywine. I like the Coney a little more now, on second thought."
"I was not too impressed by this one. This, my third, Coney Island offering leaves me wondering a bit about these wacky labels and caps. May give it shot next batch that comes out, but this one was not very appealing."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent lager, and one of my personal favorites. The refreshing taste of this beer never gets old, and I can't think of many beers better then this one to enjoy after a long day at work. During a meal this beer will succeed both in quenching your thirst and not filling you up. I love red lagers, and if you do too you need to try this one. Like it says on the label: ""Indulge your inner Beer Freak!"""
"Amber beer with a half finger head that kills to nothing quick, minor sea foam lacing on the glass initially. Smell is sweet malts, carmal on the tongue, sharp carbonation, crisp. Easy to drink."
"i was kind of reluctant on this one but it was a pleasant supprise. i recomend it"
"Tastes pretty much like a traditional Czech pils. (Not much like a red). The hops are bit more varied and American-tasting than you might find in, say, Urquell or Prima Pils. This is a nice change, but it's also lacking that wonderful dryness that a really great Pils tends to have, and this complexity of the hop also blots out the malt profile just a smidge. Still, very tasty and nicely balanced. But not quite an elite beer."
"The flavor is quite good, with a malty burst of sweet caramel and toffee that gets immediately balanced by bitter hops. The hop note is piney and resinous, and rides the back of the palate for quite some time. For a lager, this packs some serious flavor, and it's a welcome change from the lackluster lager offerings I've come across. The mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, refreshing, and all of the above. A joy to consume (a bit less overbearing than Schmaltz's Sword Swallower Steel Hop Lager), and at $4.99 for 22 oz., I'll be sure to revisit this gem."
"Easy to drink solid amber lager."
"Half inch, off-white head. Clear body. Moderate malt, light bread, light hoppiness, light yeast aroma. Intial flavor was moderately sweet and a little bitter. Texture was initially watery, but then dry on the tongue later. Interting beer. Could be a real good session beer."
"A well done red lager. I am new to most of the schmaltz brewing stuff but if all of there brews are like this, i am a big fan. Poured a gold color with a nice reddish hue to it. The head sticks around with you as does the carbonation but not in a bad way. Smell is pretty interesting the malt is pretty present in the aroma. Malt is also quite present in the taste with just enough hops coming through. For the bizzare make up of this beer i was quite surpised by the quality. A good solid brew worth the money..."
"Pours a handsome golden/amber color, smallish beige head settles into a foamy ring around the beer, small patches of lacing, and lots of bubbles rising up through the center of the glass. Some grassy hop aromas, bready, and a touch of lemon. Incredibly balanced taste, just the right amount of bittering hops, and a rich caramel malt taste. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, without seeming watery at all...some nice lingering hoppy bitterness. You could drink these all day, or at least, I could. Very versatile beer, and something I'd have again in a heartbeat. Tasty!!"
"A nice offering and easy drinking beer, but there's not a lot here to set it off from any other peers."
"Outstanding drinkability: great balance and not too heavy. The low 5.5% ABV means one can enjoy more than one, the bomber is an excellent dosage."
"Clear amber. Average head. Fair retention. limited lacing - may be the glass. Menu lists Brooklyn as the point of origination? Brooklyn Brewery? Seems odd. Must be Sixpoint or Greenpoint... no, definitely Greenpoint - they contract Sixpoint don't they? Great nose. Hoppy. Malty. Caramel and toast with citrus and leafy hops. A touch of marmalade perhaps. Not over-done. Medium bodied. Standard carb but with a bit of a dextrinous edge to the malt. Very nice beer. A great introductory beer. More hops appear in the flavor, but the malt remains the dominant entity. Citrus rind dryness. Firm bitterness. Finishes malty and hoppy with a bit of spiciness and some delicate earthiness leaving you ready for another sip. Fairly impressive for a kind of standard style brew."
"Pours amber with a light head. The aroma is grainy, but a bit sour for my taste. The flavor is sweet, slightly smoky and grainy, with a bit of bitterness on the back end. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin given the color and promise of the pour. This is a tasty beer, but a bit unusual to be truly refreshing or highly drinkable."
"Split this cool looking bomber with my brother-in-law . This is actually a great lager and I would believe that it is made with quality in mind. It was balanced, sessionable, and good looking. However I think because of the ""czech pilsner yeast"" it has a minerally bite involved that I simply do not enjoy. There's really not much I can say other than that and unfortunately it isn't in front of me to do a thorough review, but I was convinced that it was a quality american lager, just not something I would spend the money to get again."
"Coney Island Lager pours an amber color with a thick off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is quite a nice aroma, lots of malt and a nice amount of hops. Very flavorful for a lager, lots of caramel like malt flavors and a nice hop flavor are present. The body is light as is appropriate. Quite tasty."
"There really isn't too much to this beer, but it's pretty refreshing. I doubt the brewers were trying to make anything extreme. Though, this does come from the same brewing company that makes the 10+ %ABV Jewbelalation series. Recommended."
"A great lager. Very refreshing even though it has a more dynamic flavor profile than what is typical for most lagers I have sampled. A bit expensive so that limits sessionability."
"Easy to drink, but far from impressive."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, this beer seems to be a lager that's trying to be an IPA and it combined the best qualities of both styles. This is a very good beer to drink for a long time."
"Overall Impression - I generally drink IPA's, Imperial Stouts, and Belgian's. In general I've avoided lagers for a long time. I'm trying to get over the stigma I've put on the lager side. With that I have to say while it's not as complex as I am used to it has a very nice flavor, and it is very drinkable. There is just enough hop flavor to tie it back with more familiar and loved beers, but it is still distinctly a lager. This would be a great beer on a hot day, and at 5.5% ABV I think I could put a couple of these bombers down."
"Pours a clear amber color with a medium lived whitish head. Smell is lightly grassy and pale maltiness. Taste is perhaps a bit hoppy for a lager, malty, medium bodied and a full flavored nice lager. Perhaps a touch lemony as well. Not offensive, is easy drinking, and pretty solid for what it is."
"Very tasty and refreshing. Brew this in a six pack and this will become a regular of mine."
"Now, I normally don't trust my nose that much, but my buddy sharing this beer with me didn't smell much of anything either, which was pretty surprising considering the flavors going on. Didn't hinder my experience in the slightest though. I definitely enjoyed this beer and look forward to having more in the future."
"D - enjoyable, but I think the 22 oz of this will be enough. As I said, it's pretty heavy for a lager, but either way it's nice going down. Worth a shot if you're looking for a lager that's slightly different."
"D- all the flavors i love from an ale are put into a lager with a really clean taste and an unoffensive finish despite the loads of hops. honestly i never would have expected this flavor profile. this is my first beer from schmaltz and i am definitely gonna seek out some more of their offerings."
"Wow. Nice lager!"
"Aroma is strong and malty with just a whisper of fruit - banana on second examination. Color is a dark honey-amber, not like your typical lager, and with a nice thick off-white head that sticks around for a bit. Flavor is smooth, malty with a fair amount of hoppy bitterness and a trace of fruit. Hop flavor dominates the aftertaste. This is rather different from what I expect when drinking a lager."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pilsener glass. Light amber with lots of bubble columns. The aroma showcases an unusual hoppiness for a lager; sweeter citrus fruit comes through alongside the more classic earthy Saaz. The flavor has a nice maltiness that is part caramel and part cookie. The hops are mostly leafy and herbal but some of the citrus from the smell is detectable. Body is heftier than expected for the style, but this is still a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability-Not great, not wretched."
"Flavor is rich malts with just the slightest hint of sulfur. Toasted biscuits and French bread. Hops are mildly sprucey but balance out nicely with the malts. Hop flavor linger around the tongue well after each sip. Light mouthfeel. Very nice beer to have on a summer day. Would not mind getting my hands on a few more bottles of these."
"Drinkability- Overall a good lager to try. Very much within the style."
"A great lager, and with 8 malts and 6 hops what's not to like. smooth, enticing, and develops quite nicely. Longer finish than most lagers have too."
"Poured into a pint glass, hazy amber with a thin but alluring head--good retention. Very nice nose, caramel malt, pine and maybe fig. Flavor is less distinct, but a good balance of caramel malt & mild hop spiciness,with a clean finish. Medium carbonation goes down easy. A refreshing and enjoyable beverage."
"If I were blindfolded I would swear that this is an ale. I would happily serve this to my beer geek friends and tell them it is a mild American amber."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a clear copperish dark amber with nice off-white head, ok retention, and some lacing. Smells of floral hops, citrus, and honey. Tastes of lemon and sweet caramel with a firm bread and butter backbone and a slight alcohol, grapefruit, and pine finish. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Sweet and malty smooth with a bitter, crisp finish. Low in ABV and easy to drink, nice to session for those who love malty sweetness and a crisp hop finish."
"Poured a golden amber color with a thin white head. A slightly spicy smell accompanied a caramel sweetness. Like an American Macro Lager on the nose, only a little more complex. There was a very nice balance of caramel malts and American hops, along with a certain spiciness to the flavor. It was a smooth beer for the type. Most of these Lagers just have so much bitterness and bit like other Lagers that I avoid them. This one put the L in lager."
"D- It's a good, but not spectacular drinker. It was a little heavier than I expected keeping it from being a really sessionable beer."
"D: I think that this beer is extremely drinkable. It is hard to imagine a better beer in this category. The alcohol is tame and so I would be able to have a couple of bottles easily without passing out. I recommend this American amber lager highly."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Chimay chalice (2 pours). This beer pours a crystal clear copper with a light, creamy head that leaves just a slight lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is malty up front. Caramel and toffee sweetness come out followed by a slight buttery smell. There is also just a slight hint of grapefruit. The taste is sweet but has a descent hop bitterness at the finish. Caramel is pretty prevalent up front. There is grapefruit and other citrus that comes out from the hop presence. Brown sugar and molasses definitely come out also. The mouthfeel is good. Its medium bodied with just a slight carbonation. While this is my first experience with a Red Lager, it really isn't what I expected it to be. There is a lot more flavor than what I expect from most. This is a really good beer."
"Decent, but certainly not above-and-beyond..."
"D:Easy session brew"
"Overall not a bad session lager at all, really quite good actually and went very well with dinner. I was very happy with the way this one turned out, and it was nice to see that they could put together a quality session ale as well as some of the bigger offerings they make. I would recommend giving this one a try. Also as a side, growing up in Jersey, the label brought back some fun memories, really interesting little beer here, and definitely worth a further look."
"Get your Lager here, Lager, get your lager here."
"Outstandingly good drinkability here. Pretty much an ultimate lawnmower beer and one of the best American Lagers I have had in months, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: easy to drink ale here. Not overwhelming but a simple session beer."
"Overall this is definitely a ""big"" lager compared to other styles, for the price I was hoping for some more complexity, still a fine beer and you can't beat the cause."
"The 22 oz. bomber was adorned with a label befitting a funhouse theme I associate with Coney Island (although I have never been there personally). The Beer came out orange amber in color with some chill haze. Carbonation was fine and gentle, which made me wonder if this was bottle conditioned. The aroma was very toasty and caramelized and was layered with a follow up smell of spicy noble hops. The taste was well balanced between the simple bready sweetness of caramel malts and surprisingly bitter hops. Not watery like most Vienna lagers, this was a flavorful and caressing treat. Went fabulously with a plate of Indian cashews and Marcona almonds."
"It's okay enough to drink the whole bomber, but - sorry - not a big fan."
"Mouthfeel is very clean and refreshing and this is a beer that you could quaff."
"Picked this up in a 22 oz Bomber from Dan's Buyrite. Caught my eye for its bargain basement pricing and the Shmaltz reputation for quality. This beer is a lager but I did not drink it ice cold but more at the ale temp. Imbibed from a wine glass. Did not disappoint. Highly quaffable with a low abv (5.5). This beer had that je ne sais quois that just made you want more and more. Maybe it was the hypnotic stare of the clown on the bottle. Or maybe this is just one of the most drinkable amber lagers I've ever had. Less hoppy but more balanced than that Sam Adams stuff. Makes me want to go the Coney Island. Kudos to Shmaltz!"
"Drinkability: I'm not a big lager fan and, while I can tolerate a Sam Adams if nothing else is available, this is a very nice beer that I would seek out"
"Pours a dark clear yellow with a frothy white head. Smells malty and sweet, with some hoppy notes. The taste starts sweet and malty and finishes somewhat hoppy with some spice thrown in. The mouthfeel is smooth a great balance in flavors with multiple layers, a very impressive lager. This one is an easy drinker, creative flavors, and an interesting break from the usual. Worth checking out."
"I'ts pretty cool that some of the proceeds go to the Coney Island fund. WE need some freaks left in this world."
"I'll be looking to buy more of this one...especially in the warmer months."
"Drinkability - I forget what I paid for this, but if it's not too much I'd love to share some of these around this summer. A delightful find."
"Notes - At almost $5 per 22 oz bottle, I can't see any reason to seek this out."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Drinkability: That being said, I defy any person with a soul to not enjoy this Vienna."
"The first time I became aware of this beer was on a hot Sunday afternoon last August, when I saw bottles of this for sale at the Coney Island Freakshow but they had just sold out. Well let me tell you, this would have been a perfect beer for that hot summer day. With a nice fresh, crisp taste and easy drinkibility, this would have gone down very nicely and it still does, even as I sit here on a cold ass day in January."
"Being heavily involved in architecture and urban design, I appreciate the fact that a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this beer go toward the stabilization and preservation of Coney Island."
"Thanks Matt!"
"Notes: I really enjoyed this. The combination of a zippy carbonation and solid hop bill really snaps this thing together."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of, amber, with a medium tan colored head - nose of mild malts, some soapiness , and subtle hops  taste of pale hops, ever so slight malts, and very mild soap - body is dry , and light , and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of mild hop, bitter, and dry"
"Had this one at the cask festival at the Brazen Head a few months ago (transcribing off of notes) Pours a clear orange amber. Nose is grainy. Flavor is a bit more nutty than I remember off the bottle. Nice smooth feel with a definite silky edge. Very nice drinker."
"A nice easy drinking beer. Mildly flavorful."
"Too much sweetness in this one is the first thing noticed, cloying on the almost. Hops help to tame the RS on the middle leaving only slight bitterness on the finish taking abandon to the malt. Malts tastes exactly how the nose was described. Thick with cereal grain, toffee and caramel with that similar graham cracker flavor. Mouth is a little thin as well. If this wasn't quite as sweet it would be much better."
"A decent beer, and happy to try it, but I was hoping for something a bit more balanced."
"This is a very easy to drink red lager but not anything special."
"Sinkability  A stain on the Coney Island name."
"Overall, a good entry in the lager category, a genre that needs more unique and compelling beers."
"The bottom line: A decent take on the Czech PIlsener style. Nothing particularly remarkable though."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear amber brew. Head fades slowly, with sporadic bits of lasting lace. Aroma is lightly malty, with some floral hops character. Taste is biscuity malt upfront, nicely balanced with ample fresh hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, with quite nice drinkability. Nice pils-style, with a bit more oomph in the malt area."
"Easy enough to drink, this one is meant to slug down and not put too much thought into it."
"D- The malt is a bit soft in the smell but has some nice flavor. There is a good complexity to the grain bill with some big bitterness at the finish. It sounds exciting but I just found this beer a bit boring."
"Overall a very well balanced and easy drinking beer. However, the beer drank more like a Vienna Lager than a pils."
"Final Note: cool bottle label."
"Bottle from City Wide in South Bend. Pours orange to terracotta. Lacy, doily-like head is khaki to off-white in color. Looks surprizingly dark for what i was expecting. Smells buttery and tangy, notes of lemons and brussel sprouts(!) Taste is more bitter than expected, like an APA. Slightly sweet malty flavor with distinct hop bite. Not too crazy, but admittedly unusual in its presentation. Medium bodied. A good drinker, but nothing special, i dont think."
"Not really a Czech pilsener, pretty thin, all the character is wrapped up in the caramel."
"D - Based on the description on the bottle I thought this beer might be a bit of a mess but I was pleasantly surprised. I will look for other beers in this series."
"I don't believe this would make a regular rotation in my fridge, but I certainly enjoyed. At $4.99 per 22 oz. bottle, a little pricy for my beer budget."
"D: Perhaps not the typical pilsner, but quite drinkable. Enjoyable flavor, plenty of both hops and malts (label says there 6 hops and 8 malts in this beer). Jeremy Cowan, you've again broken the mold on what to expect from certain styles. While this may not be the most drinkable, smoothest pilsner I've ever had, it's definitely one I'd have again and will recommend."
"This label should be on a T-shirt!!"
"have no idea how this 22 oz bottle made its way to a small grocery store in Salem,Oregon. Lovely looking lager, dark copper with a large tan head. Great laceing throught the galss. Aroma I wasnt so pleased with, its sort of malty/nutty but with some off putting ""cheesy sock"" thing going on. Nice taste to strong on the malts, dark and semi-bitter, with a great zing of grassy/sherberty hops near the end. Pleasant hop aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel to this one, smooth under the well done carbonation. I thought this wasnt a Czech pils but a very drinkable Vienna, very nice."
"D - This is a very good beer. It doesn't taste like a Czech Pilsener from the Czech Republic, because it has those West Coast hops. Still it is a very good lager."
"too big- I think that's why I like it."
"I kind of with this came in a smaller bottle. Towards the end, I was getting a little tired of it. Still glad I sampled."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear orange amber body with a healthy almond head that is creamy and well retained. Some patchy lace left on the glass. Aroma of spicy hops, toasted caramel and fruity pear esters. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is a nice balance of earthy spicy hop bitterness and toasty caramel maltiness. A hint of red apple in the middle. Very approachable but not a pilsner."
"I picked this up since I liked Lenny's RIPA, but was pretty disappointed by this beer. It's definitely nowhere near a Czech pilsner so that amplifies my disappointment. I just don't like the tea-like hop flavors of this beer."
"Coney Island Lager is the first in a series of 'sideshow inspired' lagers from Shmaltz. That's certainly an interesting theme for a brewery to pick. A portion of the proceeds go to Coney Island USA, an organization founded to 'defend the honor of lost forms of American popular arts and culture'. Although it isn't outstanding beer, I'm glad I gave it a go and I'm glad I could contribute a little something to a worthy cause."
"Great label and a worthy cause (save Coney Island!). But the beer is too sweet for my money -- all malt backbone, chewy and bready without a noticeable hop edge. Good color, great bottle, and fun to drink anyway. If you're not a hophead like me, you might love it."
"The taste reminded me much of a steam beer. There was a very nice balance of caramel malts and American hops, along with a certain spiciness to the flavor. It is an incredibly smooth beer, and an incredibly easy drinker. I'm always a little gun shy about American lagers but this one was really quite good. If I can find a six pack of this I wouldn't hesitate to buy it."
"Copper. Crystal, clear copper. Head is somewhat fizzy. About an inch. Dirty white/off white/ivory white. Something along those lines. Lace is spotty. Decent nose of carmelized malts and burnt sugar and earthy hops. Medium bodied. Appropriately carbonated. Quenching. Easy going maltiness on the palate. Fairly sweet overall, though there is a bitterness that is noticeable. Caramel and toffee the flavors of note. A little spiciness. And a bit of a dryness on the finish. Overall a decent beer."
"Its no knock out of the park, but it has a well-crafted nature that suits it well and is comfortable for drinking."
"This is a nice lager. It's definitely not like a 'traditional' American craft lager though, as others have said, it definitely has more of a Pils thing going for it. All in all, quite nice. I just wish this came in smaller bottles."
"Hail freaks, geeks, barkers, and carnies!"
"Fairly light-bodied but very drinkable and refreshing."
