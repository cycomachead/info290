"Poured from tap in s 16 oz glass.  Nice amber color.  Sweet flavor.  Real good"
"It's a shame this beer needs refrigerating throughout all of its life, I'd love to see it makes its way down to the deep south.  A beer I would always keep handy for sporting events and get-togethers."
"Feel: Solid throughout, good finish. Very smooth, full-bodied."
""
"crisp, clean, beautiful beer that quenches during any season"
""
"My all-time favorite beer. It's a damn shame that you can only get it in North Carolina."
"Very easy drinking Lager. Compares to Yuengling but much more crisp and clean tasting"
""
"Full of flavor!  This brew if very light on hops.  I like that for a change."
""
""
"My favorite amber lager. Nice malty flavor, great texture. My go to beer with a meal. Try their seasonal varieties; Big Oak, Battlefield Bock."

"The taste is malty but balanced, caramel, toffee, light tea like hop flavors. Ultra clean yet full bodied and satisfying. This beer is brewery only and always refrigerated. What else can you ask for in a Vienna Lager?   Thx to my cousin Brennan for hauling this back from North Carolina."

"O: A lovely thing. Again, one of the best balanced beers out there in my opinion and certainly one of the most rewarding amber lagers."
""

"This is a gorgeous amber beer, with a solid 3/4in head. There was a bit of tang in the nose with an overall excellent aroma. The flavor was mostly malty and sweet, but really there wasn't a whole lot of flavor there. I expected a little more based on the aroma. However, it certainly lives up to its claim of smoothness. It is a very drinkable beer. Drink it while it is cold though, the sweetness gets to be a bit much when it starts to warm up."

"A neighbor brought a bottle to me in Ohio from North Carolina and kept it cold per bottle warning. Poured into a mid-20th century hollow-stem beer glass. Carbonation was moderate with with small bubbles and light head. Noticed a slight yeast taste but not bad. Beautiful read-brown, clear color and no sediment in the bottle which I expected based on the description on the bottle. Felt a little tingly at first but mellowed to a smoother feel as it warmed and settled. Overall a good, smooth beer but a tad on the bland side for my taste."
""
"My favorite beer! They do a wonderful job making sure there is no difference in the tap and the bottle! Amazing! I can't wait for it to be available everywhere! I had this beer the first time a the mellow mushroom in Greensboro, nc it went great with everything and I've been in love since. I've never been a big beer drinker but red oak has changed my ways and had showed me there is more to beer. Not just Miller and Budweiser beers. I'm so half I have found them. :-)"

"O: Pretty solid Red, not crazy different but strong none the less... Worth looking for when you are in the NC."

"Now that I have ""grown up"" and my tastes have changed, to preferring less sweet beers but without this beer I wouldn't have gone through the journey of craft beer discovery trying to find that flavor that Red Oak provided me."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. I was wishful this was going to be a good beer since i had to travel 300 miles to get the $20 12 pack. The beer poured a pretty gas colored brew with a pretty tan head. The head did not last very long. The beer smelled a bit sour, that worried me. Well the taste was not too bad I thought. itty bitty bit of sour maybe and a little sweet. However after a few days of having one now and then I have decided I will not buy this again. It just aint worth the money to be average."

"O: The smoothness of this beer is really enjoyable. It kind of reminded me of a Munich Helles Lager with a bit of an American accent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very serviceable amber, good balance and went well with my buffalo chicken"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good example of the American Amber style, very easy to drink and sessionable - not sure why but every woman I know really likes this one. I would certainly have this again even though this is not one of my favorite styles."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable beer that is what it advertises - fresh and good. Nothing world class here just a solid, drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: very drinkable but also very simple making this anoether not terrible, not memorable beer."

"Smooth drink with a sort of sweet aftertaste. Tastes like a better Yuengling/Killians. I am absolutely fanatical about the beer, best beer I have ever had. It is almost too drinkable, I'll slip up and drink a whole 12 pack on a Friday night doing stuff around the house (18.99 a pop makes the wife sad)."
"It wont blow your mind in any way, but it will go down smooth with no off flavors at all."
""
"O: Solid and session-worthy medium-dark lager. Reminds me a little of a recent Full Sail LTD release, one with a similar weight (modest), flavor (balanced nuttiness) and drinkability. The label brags about strict adherence 'to the 1516 Reinheitsgebot Purity Law' and liberally uses the words 'Fresh' and 'Pure' all across its label. I get it: fresh and pure!!! And good, too. Wouldn't mind having this again. Thanks, Jeff!"
""
"This improves a bit as it warms. I've had these around all week and they've grown on me. I find the twelve packs a little pricey but I certainly won't complain anytime anyone wants to gift me some."

"Overall, I would never purchase a 12 pack of these but I enjoyed it."
"from notes 1/20/12"

""
""
"O - The quick and dirty way to describe this beer in my eyes is a more fresh and slightly thicker Yuengling. Great easy drinking amber, perfect to have readily available at college."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is an amber lager and is as simple as they come. If you enjoy Yuengling, you'll enjoy this beer even more. I am going to recommend this to my Yuengling drinkers and would not mind purchasing this beer again next time I'm in the Raleigh area."
""
"Speaking of drinking quick the mouthfeel is conducive to that. Smooth with a hint of creamy and a pop of carbonation. This brew tastes great and goes down as easy as a $5 hooker. Well worth trying and one that I'd buy again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appears rusty orange with a wispy, off white head. The aroma brings sweet malt, fruit, alcohol. Thin, with sweet, fruity, alcohol. No off flavors, per se, but just not my thing. Bland, lacking depth and complexity. Too sweet to enjoy more than one."
""
"Trying the Red Oak Amber Lager at Taste of Carolina located in teh B concourse of Charlotte airport. The beer poured a copper/amber color with weak head and no lacing. The smell was barley/malt. The taste was very grainy with barley. not much to cheer or rave about. When compared to the OMB Copper this doesn't hold a candle. The mouthfeel is light with big carbontation....hoestly this is like Mic Ultra Amber. Overall, not a good beer when compared to others in this family."
""
""
"definitely on my list of likes... have recommended to several friends..."
"Over a nice beer to have while passing through N. Carolina."
"Had this beer last weekend at Ham's in Greensboro, it's a nice brew with a smooth taste. The taste and color remind me of Yuengling Traditional Lager but a smoother taste. Nice mouthfeel with some almost sweet notes. I have also had this from a bottle but I prefer it on tap. Overall a quality beer with a good taste and feel."
"O - One of the smoothest beers I've ever tasted, which makes it incredibly easy to drink. The lightness of the body and the dry finish make this a quality beer."
"Not sold on this one. My brother swears by it. I think I would have liked this one more it wasn't so creamy. I would prefer it to be more crisp and clean. Red Oak is a nice little brewery so I'll revisit and give them their fair due."
"Sticky sweet malt hit that grows cloying as the beer warms. Tons of malt body here. Very sweet caramel finish. Just too sweet for my taste."
"O - Great to try for no other reason than it's local. Probably just a tick under SA Boston Lager but the freshness makes up a bit for the slightly less balanced flavor."
"O: A nice solid amber lager, I like the story of how it sticks to lager natural law, was a nice present getting a case"
"Comes from a friend in North Carolina. He had it when he was down there at the Brewery. Not a bad beer. I am not a huge fan of Lager beer. Looks good and has the Lager beer smell. But just not that exciting. May have been the build up of having a beer here in Michigan that you can't buy in Michigan. Would like to try it there to be a better judge of it. I drank it with no problem just was not a ""great beer"""
"Poured into a pint glass and was initially impressed by the color, head was an off white color and The aroma had a bit of a sweet smell. The taste was lackluster. I have been wanting to try this since I heard they would be bottling, and really wanted to enjoy this, I did not. I may try another offering from here, but not this one."
"Bottle poured into a glass beer mug. Beautiful amber color. Only a small 1/2 inch head with not much lacing. Smell...not much...malty with a little caramel. The taste is about the same...malty, caramel, and a hint of nuttiness. Mouthfeel and carbonation is good. Very drinkable. I like this better than another local brewery's amber (Natty Greene's), but that's not saying a lot. Overall an okay amber, but nothing special. I wouldn't really seek this one out again. It really is hard to find a good amber."
"D - I thought this was a good beer; had a very unique feel and taste to it for a lager; The Weihenstephan yeast cultures and oak aging definitely helped give this beer a good smooth crisp flavor; definitely worth a try for any beer lover"
"This beer is a beautiful copper with a practically non-existent head. Smell is VERY malty with hints of bread and clove. Taste is all up front and spicy. Mouthfeel is average but the carbonation is too high. Drinkability is decent. I didn't like the way this beer smelled or tasted when I first poured it but by the time I got to the bottom of the glass I decided it was just ok. I see no reason to buy this one again."
"Overall, the beer is incredibly drinkable. Red Oak has hit the style on the head, doing nothing over the top, and creating a fine amber lager."
"Clear copper with a small, off-white head. Sweet, bready, grainy malt aroma...there's something artificial and off-putting about it. Less sweetness makes the flavor more enjoyable. Honey, toasted bread, caramel, light bitterness. Clean, medium-light mouthfeel. There's just something about this beer that isn't quite right coming from the bottle. Whenever I find myself in a bar with a limited tap selection, this isn't such a bad option. From the bottle however, I won't buy it..."
"single from WF Cary"
"Lots of carbonation with this beer. The taste is pretty standard lager with some malty complexity you don't get with large production American lager beers. One thing I'll say is this beer is very drinkable, i wouldn't hesitate to take this to tailgate. The finish is clean and helps make this a better than average lager."
"D - Over all this isn't a bad beer but it does fall short in a few areas but it has a decent taste that's going down pretty easy right now"
"On tap into a pint glass...Pours a super light copper, medium clear. A bright tope head good retention and lacing...A mostly dead aroma, a little generic sweetner comes through, a little medicinal...The taste is generic toffee, light skunk, bad rye. This is pretty tough to drink, I wouldn't recommend it."
"A bit on the dull side, but you have to appreciate Red Oak's commitment to the Reinheitsgebot. Other local brewers like Foothills and Natty Greene's don't need or want to stick to strict traditions, so these guys are the ones doing it in the Triad. Room for everybody and all that..."
"Poured out with a deep copper color, good silky head that disappated, it is a little clody, and the carbonation is rapid and small. Lovely to look at. It has a grainy hint on the nose but overall clean. Pretty complex on the palate though. A little fruity, very bready, and a slight dry hop taste that it buried in a sea of malt. Misses being a dunkel lager by a bit but still very tasty. Got to knock it for not hitting the style right. Needs more hop balance. Moderate body and very airy...burp. very drinkable however. Good for fall though spring."
"Not much head, and pours a light amber color. The first sip is kind of strange if you've never had it before, with an oak/nutty flavor to it in the after taste. Once you adjust though it's incredibly refreshing and one of the easiest beers I've ever had to drink. The flavor is very crisp and refreshing, and the hints of oak/nut give it a distinct and delicious taste. I'd suggest the draft to the bottle, but at least it's finally available in bottles now and they're still very good."
"The color is a deep mahogany/ reddish brown with a off-white head with a fair amount of carbonation. Aroma of malt and strong barley some faint alcohol notes. Taste of strong malts balanced with some noble hops; not too bitter -- this beer is all about balance. Very smooth mouthfeel with exceptional drinkability. Red Oak was the beer that got me into craft beer."
"Gateway beer with no complexity whatsoever."
"Served from tap into an imperial pint. Poured an amber orange with a one-finger off-white head that subsides slowly. There was no apparent lacing evident. The aroma was comprised of nutmeg and malt. The flavor was earthy and nutty with a big nutty follow-through upon swallowing. It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is a very nice brew that is really refreshing. The extremely nutty follow-through is a bit overwhelming at first, but once you palate adjusts, it is quite enjoyable."
"D - Tried this because it's brewed about 25 miles away. Will definitely be having a lot more of these. Good tasting beer. Did not disappoint."
"D - A good amber lager for a session beer. I would imagine it would be perfect for an early fall afternoon as the flavors mimic earthy tones."
"Good mellow crispness to the body. Flavors of honey-kissed biscuits, some caramel, and a good bready finish. Bitterness is low in this one. This is a great refreshing beer. Glad I can have this one in the fridge more often now."
"Not a bad warm weather beer if you like them on the sweet side. a little sticky-sweet for me, but it looks beautiful in the glass."
"Overall: One of my favorites. I'll definitely be recommending the bottles to anyone who enjoys Red Oak draft."
"Drinkability is not bad. Overall all this is a easy drinking brew with a decent flavor. It would make a pretty good session beer, but its not what I would consider a great example of the style. But still not bad!"
"Pretty good session beer that I would have repeatedly, but I would definitely recommend a more solid amber if someone was asking."
"I could and did drink a couple of tall ones."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D - Well I guess it's drinkable. This beer is really not too exciting overall though."
"No head bud some decent lacing. A warm orange color. Not much of an aroma to speak of but what is there is pleasant, slightly bready. Not much hop character on the flavor and overall a very bready flavor dominates, just like the aroma. That being said, the flavor is mild but still pleasant. It's nice but forgetable. It's extremely popular in NC and I never knew why considering it's fairly expensive in a lot of places. I guess it has a mass-appeal drinkability while still have the appearance of a legit craft beer."
"Overall, this beer was very drinkable and pleasant the whole way down. I would have another."
"D: Easily drinkable but not overly complex. The metallic notes take some away."
"Found it on tap at a bar in the airport in Greensboro on my way back from a business trip. I didn't even know North Carolina had a brewery."
"Good beer. Living in North Carolina I hear about this one all the time but had never tried it until last night. Glad I tried it. Good price too, $3 a pint at Corbin's in Winston. This will be a beer I come back to."
"D: A somewhat simple brew but not difficult to drink. A new style to my pallet so difficult to compare to a pale ale for example."
"Light brown-amber color with a medium head. Had it on tap and left lots of lace. Light-bodied and it had a sour malty bitter taste to it. Not all that great, wasn't a big fan of this one, but beats a lot of other crap that was on tap (Bud, Michelob, etc.)."
"This one of my favorite beers.I have enjoyed it on tap many times and even fresh at the brewery. This may be one of the smoothest beers you'll ever drink. It's red color with a little cloudiness is good to look at. It pours (depending on where you get it) with a one finger head that dissapears quickly. Great refreshing taste of malt and hops with a slight oaky finish.Again the smoothness is it's real plus, you could drink a few real easy."
"Served a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was slight caramel malts and subtle hops. Taste was a nice balance of smooth crisp malts and undertoned but present hops. The beer is very light and crisp with decent carbonation. This one is somewhat enjoyable, one that's occasionally available around NC in places that otherwise don't have much good beer."
"If you are in NC make sure you check it out."
"D - I didn't have a problem putting back a pitcher of this stuff and though it didn't really blow me away it was a decent change of pace."
"This is a pretty good amber lager. It's unfiltered and has a nice cloudy amber pour with a small head. It tasted of mild citrus hops, well balanced with mildly sweet, bready malts. It's an enjoyable, everyday brew that has been overshadowed lately by the explosive growth of rival Natty Greene's."
"This is good beer. It has a sweet smell of slight fruittyness, with the added aroma of hops. It pours an amber tone that makes me think....blah. Though it doesn't have a great appearance. It has a nice taste. A floral blend of malt and hops is a sure pleaser and makes it easy to guzzle down a few of these beers. Definetly a decent beer."
"$2 Wednesday afternoon special @ abbey road in cary, nc. a little too sweet but better than most $2 specials that i have had(i'm looking at you bud). the first time i had this beer was at the red oak brew pub in greensboro nc and the beer tasted like turpentine. it took me years and the aforementioned special to try it again but i am glad to report that the chemical taste must have been in the glassware and not the beer. the beer isnt bad but it isnt great either."
"I'll opt for a glass, if it's all that's available. But, it's by no means one of my favorites. Likewise, their other main offering ""hummingbird"" (sic?) is very passable. It's a shame considering that the brewery seems to pride itself on being unfiltered and unpasteurized. Oh well, thankfully there are better NC breweries to choose from..."
"Almost an orange-ish amber with a big off-white head and reasonable lacing. The smell was of wheat and sour mash. The first tangy taste brought more of the tart sour mash flavor with some citrus and maybe fig in there somehow or another. It is nicely carbonated, pretty refreshing, reasonably drinkable but it comes down to this tart thing with a dry finish that doesn't make me want to overdo this stuff from a taste standpoint. It's OK, worth a try."
"D - you could keep drinking this all day...but would you really want to?"
"This came from the tap with a light amber pour with small lacing and little character. The smell was bready and malty but unremarkable. An easy, smooth taste with light malts and more bready flavor but nothing remarkable. Smooth enough to drink and make a session ale, but nothing spectacular. Sadly, in quite a few places in Greensboro, it comes down to this and a Sam Adams... take the Sam Adams."
"Drinks very easy, one I will look for the next I'm back in NC. One of the better bottom fermented beers I've lately"
"I tried this beer on tap at Mellow Mushroom in Winston-Salem, NC. It is extremely smooth with a strong honey scent/taste. It actually reminded me a lot of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch, in the mouthfeel and aroma. The menu at M.M. described it as a ""vienna lager," and since that is said to be the best style of beer to have with a pizza, I had to try it with my pie. On here its classified as a red lager, so I dont know... I really enjoyed this beer, even though it differs very much from the other vienna lagers I have had (Samuel Adams, Negra Modelo)."
"Copper/amber color and a decent white sticky lace for a head. The aroma had roasted malts and a touch of sweet caramel. Clean medium-light body. The flavor is dominated my toasted malts. A little bit of carmel and hops can be detected. Has a clean finnish and a great drinkablilty. You can find this beer in many bars around the Triangle area, so I order it often. Makes a great session beer!"
"All in all, it's somewhat hard to summarize. As many have said before below, it changes from batch to batch. It's a rich amber color, unfiltered, with little to no head and scant aroma - just muted hints of the nicely underplayed tastes. Definitely not for the coinneseur (spelling? hm, think I did allright with that one) that prefers an exotic cavalcade of taste with their beer, but a good and very drinkable brew, in my opinion."
"All and all probably a good lawnmower beer. Very light on body and flavor."
"Per Red Oak website: Amber Lager - Munich malt body, select Bavarian Noble Hops."
"The finish just plain disappears but I guess that makes it imminently drinkable. A good call over a macro, maybe."
"Oh well..."
"Remembered a few years back enjoying the Red Oak on occassion but not finding it as available in the Charlotte area lately. That or I've been trying so many other styles lately, I skipped right passed it. Pours more of an amber looking color with an average head and lacing. Tastes a bit malty and does not do too much on the palate. Paid $2.00 for a pint and find it hard to resist at the price, but not for too many other reasons."
"Drinkability - A good beer to drink when the weather is hot and you want something that is very easy on the palate"
"Anyway, simply, I was in no way impressed. Yes, I know the sourness is per the style, and I have enjoyed several Vienna-style lagers in the past, but onlike those, this one seemed to hitch it's entire wagon to said sourness. Sorry, but that's not a quality that can stand alone and survive heartily. The lack of dimension and depth made it minimally drinkable, and even as thirsty and road-weary as I was when I drank it, I had to switch to PBR for my next glass. While I will say that it has more character than virtually any BMC macro out there, I think most would agree that is not exactly a ringing endorsement."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Sour taste and vinegar nose grate on you after awhile."
"Strangely enough this brew is the best selling beer made in NC. Very polar, either you like it or you don't, there's no in between"
"On draught at the Cherry St. Bar (Adam's Mark hotel) in Winston-Salem, NC. The beer is a solid amber color with a medium light beige head. Thin lacing. The aroma is mostly caramel and vinegar. Medium body, and I had trouble making my way through the entire glass because of the sour aspect. I am not sure if it was an old sample or what. If so they should do a better job of making sure establishments selling their beers have fresh ones, as it appears this is an ongoing issue. There was some malt in the flavor thankfully saving this from being a drain pour. The finish was malty and still a little sour. This should have been better."
"I'm looking forward to visiting the brewery at some point in the near future."
"I had this again today on draught. It was horrible. There was an awful sweetness to the beer. The taste was pretty bad also."
"This is a regional brew that is seems you either hate or you like. The beer pours a good copper color and a fair head that dissipates quickly. The beer has a malty, slightly sour aroma. The beer follows the color and smell fairly close to the style. That?s were all good comparison end. The brewer intentionally introduces bacteria during the brewing process. This gives every batch I?ve tried a metallic, bitter aftertaste that is quite unpleasant to drink. Battlefield black is a much better choice IMHO. I do recommend if you are in the Piedmont Triad area of NC that you try it for yourself. It is served on tap at may local establishments. As for me I?d rather drink the water."
"Living here in Greensboro have had this many times.It is a hit or miss with this sometimes can be fresh and fruity and chocolatey,and others stale and bitter.I think it is an ok beer when fresh it is an amber but I think has dunkle qualities in the palate,many of the people I have met think the world of it.They have some to learn I believe."
"Good copper amber color with a nice airy head. This German lager house is staying true to their roots. The highly carbonated beer seemed a little too crispy for the style but still was a good product. Low hopping with a buttery aftertaste left me wanting a little more bitterness to the end. Of the three beers on tap, this is definitely the non-threatning appeal beer. The new brewnmaster is cranking it up a notch and I expect good things down the road."
