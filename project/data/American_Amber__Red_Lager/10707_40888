3.42,4.6,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Notes: Clear, brown body beneath a thin, short-lived head of off-white. Lacing is average. Aroma expresses dark caramelish malt with a hint of nuttiness and some background hops. The flavor follows suit, and it's basically a straightforward lager with a solid caramel component. Light-medium in body and gently crisp. Moderate bitterness. It finishes fairly short and dry. Given the price it's hard to argue against it as a fall-back beer, at least for one or two while watching a game or cooking dinner... times when you don't want to focus on your beer, when you just want something refreshing at hand. This is a beer I'd buy for a backyard BBQ just so that the newbie beer drinkers can try something other than Yuengling Traditional.","NeroFiddled","Jan 04, 2015"

2.95,-9.8,3,3,3,2.5,3,"A Trader Joe's six pack (with Tecate listed on the bottle as the brewing company, interesting). Billed as a "Negra Modelo" clone of sorts it is a little light in body and mouthfeel. A Vienna lager it may be but not one that really satisfies the pallette and makes me want numerous bottles. Malty, slight caramel, and a hint of sulfur.","SiphonKing","Jan 03, 2009"
3.48,6.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Other comments: Negra Modelo is one of my favorite beers from "South of the Border". This cheaper version from TJ's isn't too bad of a clone.","GreenCard","Dec 28, 2008"
3.11,-4.9,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Despite all my negative words about this beer, it wasn't all that bad. It's just that there wasn't much to it. You know what? I would rather drink this over a certain famous flavorless clear bottled Mexican beer. If this beer has one really good quality to it, it's the fact that this beer is cheap as hell. I only paid a dollar plus tax for this beer. If you got a pocket full of change you want to get rid of, then think about getting a single or two of this beer.","AltBock","Dec 16, 2008"
3.55,8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This is obviously a Negro Modelo clone, and it tastes pretty much like you'd expect. Taste is malty with a slight hint of some cooked vegetable flavor. I know its sacrilege around here, but ice cold with a lime, this one could hit the spot with some spicy mexican food. Nothing too exciting, but for a cheap grocery store beer I enjoyed it.","rowew","Oct 03, 2008"
3.65,11.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a dark but clear brown with a good thick head and decent retention. Lacing is about average (1/4 inch - 1/2 inch). Smells of sweet malts and another sweet unknown sweet entity. Fits the style. Tastes of a strong lager with lots of sweet malt. Very smooth with little aftertaste; low carbonation. Overall a very easy drinking beer with a smooth, sweet taste that's not too strong. This is a good dark/amber lager. Overall, I'd definitely drink this again, especially based on the cheap price. Also, this is much better than its Trader Jose counterpart (Premium Lager).","Tone","Sep 13, 2008"

The carbonation bite is way to high and detracts significantly form the flavor. The body is very nice. Maybe a beer to make certain you use a harsh pour.","beveritt","Sep 02, 2008"

3.43,4.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Another private label Mexican style beer from Trader Joe's - this one, however, is much better than the Mexican lager. This one is more in line with Negra Modelo or Dos Equis Amber, thereby making the flavor profile less dependent on corn and more on caramel malts. From the clear amber hue with the nice tan head to the sweet aroma, this is a solid manifestation of the style. The flavor is sweet up front but is balanced nicely by the citrus like finish. Nothing objectionable here - would pair well with any of the frozen burritos at Trader Joe's. Recommended.","montageman","Jun 20, 2008"

3.06,-6.4,4,3,3,3,3,"Poured a dark brown with a thick caramel head that dissipated pretty quickly. It reminded me of a slightly darker Killians. Pretty malty but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely a pretty good "regular" beer, especially for the price. It's my first Trader Joe's brew of all styles so I'm interested in how they did with the other ones.","jeremyd365","May 17, 2008"
3.58,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I know it says its from Mexico so it must be crap, but I am quite surprised by this brew. I think it gives Negro Modelo a run for its money and if it isn't, it sure does a good job of faking the aromas and flavors of an all malt beer (well minus the caramel coloring). While this is certainly not earth shattering, it actually has a better mix of flavors and balance than many of the usual Trader Joe's label beers. At the price they sell this at it is almost a go to BBQ / grill beer for those hot Summer afternoons & evenings.","Gueuzedude","May 17, 2008"
