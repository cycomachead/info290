"I always look for local brews when I travel. The store down the road only had Mojave Red, and I can honestly say I really enjoy it. I'm not always a lager drinker, but it's smooth and balanced. I will definitely keep this in mind for the next time I am out in the Mojave area."

"Overall nothing special but not bad. Wouldn't turn this down but wouldn't seek it out or buy from a store."

"O: If you find most Red Ales too strong, then you may like this beer. Otherwise, it is a lackluster brew that feels like it's holding back. I really want to like this beer, but it just doesn't have enough of the primary characteristic I require--taste."

"Not recommended. If you want to make a red ale without hops, fine, make it smooth. But why make a red ale that is nasty bitter without hops? It just doesn't taste good."
"A little heavy on the caramel malts for me."
""
"Tried this a couple times each straight from the bottle. Dark copper color with a bit of a dusty fruit smell with just the slightest hint of some hop on the back. Having driven by Indian Wells I was pretty excited to try some of their beers but this along with the Gold disappointed. The Red Amber color wanted to strive for a nice full body beer but this one fell short and was quite watery and thin. Out in the desert guess it good to have something cold to drink but I would pass on this one if given another option."

"Taste is candied bitter orange peel, juicy spice, light toasted grain, all thin and a bit watery."
"Finishes watery, overly sweet, with brew salts left over. Not high on my list, but here in Mexico I take my American microbrews where I can get them."
"My Beer Rating: 2.3"

"T: it is very crispi on tongue, there is nice sweetness form the malt, nnice bitterness at the end, the final is kind of short the hops presence is good enough"

"Overall, I wouldn't drink this again, and I won't be seeking out other Indian Wells efforts."
"Beer was served on tap in a pilsner glass from the Brewery. The beer has a good red coloring to it with a light head. The smell was typical of most reds, with a light, malty tone to it. It smelled similar to most reds. The initial taste of the beer is good, but unfortunately the flavor is off your tongue before you swallow it. The beer is light and crisp, and easy on the finish. Almost a hint of apples in the aftertaste. It would be an easy beer to sit back and drink for a day, but I can honestly think of better ways to spend your time."
"I finished about half the bottle and then shared the rest with the drain."
"D: Not a well made beer. A definite pass on this effort for me."
"Sample at Alan's HSC initation. Bottle from Park Lane Liquor in Lancaster, CA. This beer is a clear orange-amber color with a thin off-white head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing. Sweet aroma of malt and caramel. Light body with a sweet malt character and light caramel and hops flavor. The finish is sweet toasted malt with a hint of hops aftertaste. Pretty basic overall."
"D - Decent. This is pretty unexciting, but not too bad. Beats their pumpkin ale, which I had side-by-side with this."
"M/D - This beer was a bit over-carbonated. Just too fizzy. Drinkability was okay, although it was a bit too sweet and sticky for the style."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer, but one that you may want to change styles from after two or three of these."
"New beer in Texas, so had to try. Poured into a 12-oz mug, it's a dark red color, with a head that forms well but falls away within moments. The nose is very sweet malt. Flavor is malty, quite sweet, a touch of hops... wow, this tastes nearly exactly like a lot of kit homebrews, made with hopped malt extract. It makes a bit nostalgic for my first few brewing attempts. I'm not sure if I've ever had a commercial beer that tasted as much like cheap homebrew before."
"12 oz bottle from some general store in Death Valley. Pours a translucent amber-brown color with a fair size sudsy beige head that had OK retention. The aroma is mostly lightly roasted malts with corn and a touch of fruit. The taste is nothing to write home about, sweet malts, corn and faint walnut hops. The mouthfeel is medium to the palate and there is plenty of lively carbonation. The finish is short and slightly biter. A decent quaff that is much more interesting than the macros, but it won't hold up to the higher craft standards."
"D- A pretty enjoyable brew from Indian Wells, probably one of their better brews at that. Found for a decent price in southern california. If offered I'd drink one."
"Not the most drinkable beer of this type. I managed to score a single bottle of this instead of having to purchase a six pack and was happy for that. Not a beer I'll be revisiting."
"Skip this one, kids."
"D: It is by no means one of the better beers I've had but I can easily enjoy a few of these while watching a movie or a football game, but I'd tend to reach for something a little more robust to sit and enjoy as an overall beer."
"Dark ruby red with a very satisfying head. Nose is malt, malt, malt, and a touch of sour fruit. Taste is functional, but unimaginative, conststing primarily of caramel, with a dash of hops, and an unfortunate bit of cloying metallicism (Band name!). Mouthfeel is predictably rich, but sticky and unispiring. Drinkability is fair. Probably won't pick it up again, but wouldn't make it a point not to, either."
"Drinkability: Well I'm ready to pour the rest out. No wonder they were blowing this out at Whole Foods."
"Interesting lager to say the least. Flavors are really reminiscent of a swartzbeir."
"Drinkability: It's okay. Nothing great. I'm getting a weird aftertaste. Not a beer I would recommend, but I wouldn't steer people away from it either. I'll never buy another sixer tho."
"I haven't had much success with random finds at trader joe's. I'm starting to wonder who the bigshot is that samples the brew before they sign them up for distribution. At any event this beer is not reccomended with a bullet."
"Drinkability- No thanks is all I have to say."
"Hrmmm... No sir, i didn't like it."
"D: possibly a little sweet here, any beer competing with SABL has to do better, but I would not avoid this beer however"
"**NB** I just checked out the website, quote Mojave Red is FLASH PASTURIZED* to guarantee a fresh tasting brew every time WTF?? Is this the Micro Brewers answer to Bud? And I note that they also brew an Irish Green Ale for St. Patricks Day. Oh Dear!!! As Lt. Columbo once said, I think that closes the case nicely. *They cant even spell Pasteurize properly on their website, geez; guess the schools are poorly attended in Inyokern. Nuff said!!!"
"If this beer is taken for what it is, it's not bad. This lager poured a nice red amber, head shrunk down to nothing and lacing was not even there. Still the color alone bumps up the appearance a bit. Sweet malty, bready aroma. Ultra smooth, malty refreshing taste profile. A tad on the sweet side, and that is to be expected of a beer from this style. Very drinkable and nice when in a lager mood. Good for a hot day or with lunch. A decent micro lager."
"An easy drinking brew. Not terribly complex but a solid ale I would buy again."
"Pours a dark, red amber, with a fluffy, cloudlike, thick (1 finger) head. The aroma is neither unpleasant or strong, its just sorta there. The primary smells seem to be nutty or maybe yeasty. Tastes fairly good, a bit bready or yeasty, a little sweet, and rather mild. Feels fairly smooth and the carbonation and maybe some of the sweetness tingle the tongue a bit. A decent beer, but not something I'd really look for again."
"Overall, the best of the three Indian Wells beers I sampled. I tried this beer about five years ago and I remember liking it then. I still like it now and it would make a decent session beer. I'm just not ready for the nearly two hour drive to get it."
"Did not think much of this beer.Not sure if it was a bad bottle or just a bad beer, but here goes. Deep red color, medium head. Roasted malts, kind of spicy, no hoppyness, flavor a little weak. A watered down red ale. Finish is neutral. Mouthfeel is thin and watery."
