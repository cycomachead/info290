Having driven by Indian Wells I was pretty excited to try some of their beers but this along with the Gold disappointed. The Red Amber color wanted to strive for a nice full body beer but this one fell short and was quite watery and thin. Out in the desert guess it good to have something cold to drink but I would pass on this one if given another option.","jnezda","Apr 01, 2012"

2.54,-10.2,3.5,2,2,3.5,3.5,"Beer was served on tap in a pilsner glass from the Brewery. The beer has a good red coloring to it with a light head. The smell was typical of most reds, with a light, malty tone to it. It smelled similar to most reds. The initial taste of the beer is good, but unfortunately the flavor is off your tongue before you swallow it. The beer is light and crisp, and easy on the finish. Almost a hint of apples in the aftertaste. It would be an easy beer to sit back and drink for a day, but I can honestly think of better ways to spend your time.","GarthDanielson","Mar 12, 2010"

Spotty lacing. Sweet aroma of malt and caramel. Light body with a sweet malt character and light caramel and hops flavor. The finish is sweet toasted malt with a hint of hops aftertaste. Pretty basic overall.","Dogbrick","Apr 29, 2009"

3.15,11.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"New beer in Texas, so had to try. Poured into a 12-oz mug, it's a dark red color, with a head that forms well but falls away within moments. The nose is very sweet malt. Flavor is malty, quite sweet, a touch of hops... wow, this tastes nearly exactly like a lot of kit homebrews, made with hopped malt extract. It makes a bit nostalgic for my first few brewing attempts. I'm not sure if I've ever had a commercial beer that tasted as much like cheap homebrew before.","allengarvin","Jun 21, 2008"
2.91,2.8,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"12 oz bottle from some general store in Death Valley. Pours a translucent amber-brown color with a fair size sudsy beige head that had OK retention. The aroma is mostly lightly roasted malts with corn and a touch of fruit. The taste is nothing to write home about, sweet malts, corn and faint walnut hops. The mouthfeel is medium to the palate and there is plenty of lively carbonation. The finish is short and slightly biter. A decent quaff that is much more interesting than the macros, but it won't hold up to the higher craft standards.","likestoswallow","May 18, 2008"

3.65,29,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark ruby red with a very satisfying head. Nose is malt, malt, malt, and a touch of sour fruit. Taste is functional, but unimaginative, conststing primarily of caramel, with a dash of hops, and an unfortunate bit of cloying metallicism (Band name!).

3.82,35,3,3.5,4,4,4,"If this beer is taken for what it is, it's not bad. This lager poured a nice red amber, head shrunk down to nothing and lacing was not even there. Still the color alone bumps up the appearance a bit. Sweet malty, bready aroma. Ultra smooth, malty refreshing taste profile. A tad on the sweet side, and that is to be expected of a beer from this style. Very drinkable and nice when in a lager mood. Good for a hot day or with lunch.

The primary smells seem to be nutty or maybe yeasty. Tastes fairly good, a bit bready or yeasty, a little sweet, and rather mild.
