"Wow... Beautiful Amber colour matched with a beautiful amber taste... Lovely... Would recommend...."

"One of my go-to beers for when people come over. Pours a nice deep yellow, almost orange with a white head that trails the glass. The smell has a nice balance of hop and malt with some light caramel scents. The taste is very refreshing with the malt in the beginning and then a finish of clean hops. Very refreshing and a great beer for any time of year."

"This was a simply astounding lager, exquisite and dee-lish x"
"Brooklyn Lager is a dark amber colored lager, topped with a creamy head and outstanding retention. The aroma is clean, brings quick citric and toffee aromas to smell. With a taste, I learned how Brooklyn Brewery got its groove. This lager is not only with flavor, but is clean, light, and easy drinking. Highlighting the tasting notes are graham cracker, light fruits, and citrus. The beer is balanced as well. If I had access to this beer, Brooklyn Lager may even join my drinking rotation."

"such a good beer. finger and a half head. Amber color head lasts throughout whole time but eased down to quarter inch. good lacing throughout. malty. little dry. smooth as hell. little bit of a hop bite. medium feel. I loved this. f or people who never had this it's like closer to a less intense Sam Adams I could drink this all the time"
""
"Theres a definite american touch to this and i love it."

"Ok beer to me, not the best lager i have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a light bready nose with light grains and spice. It pours brilliant gold with a three finger fluffy, lacy white foam collar. The beer has a good malt backbone, mostly light bread and grain with an mild initial sweetness that dries out by the finish. The hops taste like they have been added in flavors with herbal and spicy flavors mingling with the balancing hop bitterness. A very drinkable, refreshing medium to medium light bodied beer with slightly above average carbonation."

"This lager pours darker than expected, with a nice amber colour and quickly dissipating head. It smells good, perhaps a bit metallic, but that could have something to do with how fresh it is. It is very tasty - just enough body and sweet malt to set it apart from other lagers. The hops are not pronounced, but that is not a bad thing whatsoever. A quality lager, to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my thing, I'm afraid - lagers in general don't do it for me, but as such things go this isn't bad. Glad I tried it, but	I doubt that I'd go out of my way to have it again."
""
"Another nice brew from New York"
"One of the best lagers ever!"
"A nice if not extraordinary lager."

"Restaurant tap poured into weizen glass. Light Amber color. Very light, quickly dissipating head. Not much lacing. Has a crisp feel but not much body. Middle of the fairway lager taste. Probably a top quartile American lager. I prefer it to Sam Adams. (8.0)"

"Pours a straw like yellowish/gold color. Thin white lace dissapeared quickly. Not much hop aroma, taste of malt, bready, light bodied, light hop flavor. A nice, refreshing, not to complex lager for when you want a change of pace from the heavier stuff. A solid session beer."
""
"Very British much like Old Speckled Hen ... simple lager with malt and more hops than usual."

"Solid lager. Best chilled. Nice consistent hoppy flavor throughout with a very smooth finish."
""
""
"Very solid amber lager. One of the best I have tried in the U.S. Not a style I usually go to, but this one does the trick."
"Fairly nondescript aroma, with a caramelly malt backbone and a dry, lightly bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark caramel-amber with minimal off white head. Disappointing appearance overall. Aroma is toasted bread, some caramel, lager yeast (as it warms) and hints of some earthy hops in there. Flavor follows suit. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, solid lager.  Reminds of Great Lake's Elliot Ness but the less sweet of the two options.  Would drink again but happy I only grabbed a single and not a full sixer of this."

"My personal go-to beer. Its nothing crazy, no over the top hops or malts. Just a tasty, drinkable, good beer, especially when you're not trying to drink bud products or natty..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good but simple, this is a beer I'd reccomend to someone if I'm trying to steer someone clear of bud or coors"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium brown with medium sticky head,aroma is somewhat hoppy. This is a complex brew, in my opinion has a hoppy taste but still a very smooth taste. Overall, very filling beer indeed  and i think it would go great with a backyard bbq"

""
""
"o: a tasty and great lager that i wouldn't mind drinking again in the future"
"Pours a medium amber. Visible carbonation. Not much in the way of head or lacing. Aromas are light. What is there is a blend of light citrus, caramel and wet cardboard. Tastes are dry caramel, a bit of biscuit, a bit of citrus on the swallow. Overall, this is a fairly mild beer. As a lager I give it credit for bringing more to the table than a lot do in this category, but the word ""forgettable"" keeps creeping into my mind when compared to most beers I drink.."

"Nicely balanced but could use more Saaz. True to style and a great example of a drinkable pils. Finish is smooth and crisp with light hop notes in the flavor.  Malt is slightly grainy but no dycetyl or DMS is present. Carbonation is perfect as is the serving temperature."

"O: Confession - I love this beer more than I probably should. Nothing really blows you away, but this is a consistently solid, ever-so-drinkable lager. This is what adjunct macro garbage could taste like if any of the brewers gave a crap. While this beer isn't going to win any big awards, it is a great, consistent brew. Great job Brooklyn!"

"Overall: Really pleasant. Because this doesn't quite seem like a Vienna lager, what with the strong American hopping, I'm not going to rate it as one (BJCP does not have a category for American Amber Lager - that's a problem...). This is a beer I could come back to again and again. It is a well-structured, balanced, hoppy craft lager. Easily one of my top five beers of all time. Clean, refreshing, and remarkable (but not a Vienna lager)."

"Overall: The same style as Yuengling and significantly better. You can find pretty clear similarities between the two but Brooklyn lager has a much more developed taste. An easy drinking beer that would be excellent with cookouts and barbecue, which is incidentally exactly where I tried this one."

"Weak abv for me. But I had this beer in New York on tap and it was amazing. The 4 pints I had Complimented my shepherds pie extremely well. I forgot the name of the pub or else I'd mention them, oh well. I do suggest going to the heartland brewery tho ;)"

"Dark blonde kinda orange with a head that dies to a ring but leaves good lacing.. the smell is a sweet malt and a sharp bitterness.. the taste is more bitter with a grassy pine bitterness from start to finish and a light toasted tea sweetness.. pretty good beer i say it mirrors Sam adams but less sweet more bitter."

"This is not a bad beer it is not an outstanding one either. For the price there are other beers in the same category at a better price. Maybe they are not made with the same quality ingredients, but I cannot know or tell the difference. That is not to say that I do not enjoy this one, because I do. I just believe that its a bit overly priced for what you get. I got it on sale for $7.99/ six pack a similar beer out of Pennsylvania I also picked up for $7.99, but it was for a 12 pack. I have been on this tirade for a while now, but beer has gotten overly costly as of late, or so it seems. That has not deterred me from drinking it, but I feel a bubble burst coming, at least I hope a leveling. On to the review, the color is a golden red the smell is flat, nothing much to express there. The taste is good, its not too much of anything, which to me says balance. That is a good thing, especially in a lager. This is, as someone else put, a very sessionable beer, although if you plan on saving some cash I wouldn't put a way too many, because there are much better beers in the same price range. Overall, this is a solid beer, but I do wish that it was more in the same price range of its real competition, because for lagers you have a lot of competition and at much better prices."

"DATE TASTED: February 6, 2014... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. pilsner...OCCASION: the Olympics begin in Sochi--and I am a fool for the hype... APPEARANCE: beautiful orange-amber body; healthy and bubbly; thick, rocky white head that settles well; noticeable tracing... AROMA: fragrant malt; faint yet formidable citric elements--lemongrass, some pear--and some softer hops--understated but alluring... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly oily--solid mouthfeel--active and bubbly ...TASTE: light malts hint at bubblegum and muffin--refreshingly light overall, with a taste that invites a six-pack without simply rinsing... OVERALL: A companion piece to Sam Adams' offering, though not as bold, big or bountiful; a solid mix-pack filler, a session beer for certain, and definitely versatile enough to be a plus at parties where macros are offered mindlessly...."

"Enjoyed a bottle poured into a pint glass at a Calgary pub in the Kensington area (the Bottlehouse, which now also has the best fried chicken in the city by the way). An amber-brown color with around two inches or so of beige head, quite fizzy. Aroma is reminiscent of light caramel, some other nondescript semi-sweet fruit (melon?), and reasonably assertive German noble hops along with Cascade quasi-citrus elements as well. Hops on the nose fairly impressive for the style. Very inviting. Taste is crisp, refreshing, and again semi-sweet, with some pleasant herbal notes. I get some bread crust, a twinge of brown sugar, unripe plums, and green grassy hops, balanced and quenching after physical exertion. Compares favorably with Creemore Springs Premium Lager (see that review) and is a prime example of how to do this style well. Thin bodied but flavorful with moderately aggressive carbonation. Would tackle a six-pack during an afternoon of yard work and would appreciate actually tasting what I was drinking (bye bye adjunct lagers ... That was your only real purpose)."

"Pours an amber, light brown with head that doesn't last long. Nice and clear. Smells like sweet malts, and a hint of hops. Tastes about the same, the bitter from the hops outweighing the sweetness. Finishes clean and a little dry. Thinner mouthfeel. Overall a very good lager, but there's others from Brooklyn I like better."
""
""
""
""

"O: A pretty flavor lager. A bit too hoppy and floral for my personal tastes but very dynamic for its style."

"Brooklyn Lager from Brookly Brewery is a perfect example of a quality craft lager with amazing taste. The lager gives out amazing taste without a hard acid level. This lager although tasteful, continues its lager tradition in how light weight the beer settles. Although one could make the arguement that the brew has a almost too much hoppy taste. But in visiting New York City, this beer is a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So overall option I enjoy it!"
"Pours a very thick head that stays for a long time. Color is sort of a golden brown. Couldn't smell the beer out of the bottle, had to pour it to smell. Not an overly attractive scent. Taste is very good. A hint of malt with a nice hoppy kick. Mouthfeel is good, not too carbonated. One of the better beers I've had recently. Definitely a fan of pre-prohibition style lagers."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Aside from the decent mouthfeel, this is a very passable lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. As far as everyday easily attainable lagers go, this one sure is unique and atypical. Easy drinking despite being quite different. Worth trying again if it had been awhile."

"O - I'm a huge fan of quality lagers, but Amber/Red Lagers aren't among my favorites. More a Munich Helles and German Pilsener guy. Still though, I enjoy some offerings from this style and this is one. There isn't a ton going on, but it's still pretty tasty. I really liked that the malt is very noticeable without being sweet. A beer that I probably won't buy again, but if the beer were offered, I'd certainly drink it again."
""

""
""
""
"I can't remember if there were much malts, but it went down great on a hot and sunny day."
""
"Light amber color with mild carbonation and mild head. Malty, yeasty aroma with a floral and fruity hit from the hops. More carbonation in the sip than it appears. Overall taste is similar to its aroma. Slight tang with some sweetness. Not really bitter at all. Perhaps too light."

"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a Vienna-style lager or an ``Americanized'' version of one. In either case, it has a nice flavor, just not quite enough of it to suit me. An average lager at best."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma of sweet citrus malt. Pours amber/orange body with a finger and a half of white foamy head. Head dissipated to fine white film light spotty lacing of glass. Taste of crisp citrus zest and flowery notes. Finely carbonated, thoroughly enjoyable! I am going to have another right now!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a damn fine lager! It has more depth than most other good lagers that I’ve tasted, such as Yuengling to Sam Adams name two, and a great balance between the malt and hops. That balance, combined with how crisp and clean the beer is, makes for an excellent session beer!"

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"I enjoyed this lager with a Naples style pizza and it was the perfect match. A crisp clean lager with a medium body. Nice brown color and smell. I drank this from the bottle ice cold. It was refreshing and the flavor is reliable and outstanding finish taste."
""
""
"Pours copper orange with a finger of foam that dwindled to a nice lacing. Nose is aromatic with a rich malt profile. Cracker, biscuit, carmel. Some shy hops come up to offer a little grass and tangerine citrus. Taste is earthy and clean. The pale malt is nice and round and the hops lend a touch of bitterness to make it drink well. Mouthfeel is a little flat, could have used a few more bubbles. But it was smooth, semi dry and had a grainy and slightly bitter finish. It won’t blow your mind but you could drink a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I suppose I would prefer this style without the dry hopping and without the American hops, they give it a kind of bite that I'm not looking for in this style of beer. Without it, it would probably lead to a cleaner more malt forward amber lager, which is what I like these days. Keep the citrusy hops and the dry hopping for pale lagers, APAs and IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall smell and taste are just ok but kind of lacking complexity of flavors. I like other Brooklyn beers much more and find their other styles more impressive"

"O- This is a pretty good brew, but I'm going to leave it at that. It's nothing out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's nice to drink it, it's a good lager after all. But even though I had medium-low expectations on this, I was expecting more."

"O- Good, drinkable beer. It was light on a lot, which isn't a bad thing for lager. There was nothing that really stood out about this to me, but thats not always a bad thing. Its still tasted nicer than some other drinkables in the same categories (Bud, Coors, etc.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am hoping this one is bad tap lines. I was at a bar that wasn't the most craft friendly. other than that i found it to be on the verge of undrinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - really solid lager here. For some reason this is distributed to Guatemala - this must have been the 100th I've have since I have been down here. Easy drinking, refreshing lager, yet flavorful enough to keep me spending more and more on it. For hot, sweaty NYC days to lakeside views in Guatemala, I recommend this one!"
""
""
""
"This beer is perfectly balanced. I wouldn’t expect that much from a lager. This is close to expiration date maybe that is the reason to seem to be better than the last one I tried. And definitely better than their Pilsner version. Very flexible beer, works as a session or for enjoying it slowly."
""
"O: A good all-purpose beer, but not one that will hold the attention of the seasoned beer drinker for very long. Very well crafted, and the hop bitterness saves it from being overly dull. It's reliable and simple, but not particularly exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Brooklyn's addition of American hops to a Vienna style lager yields an excellent brew. This is noticeably better on tap than from the bottle."

"Can someone send me a 12-pack of this. While this might just be the Sierra Nevada on the East Coast, this is a really good Lager. Nice brown color with a great balance of hops and malt and a super clean finish. Wonderful session beer and perfect with lots of food. A must stop (along with Momofuku) on Friday's when in NYC"

"Not a bad brew, I think it needs a touch more sweetness on the palate, just for enjoyment. Without it it's more of an everyday drinker, but I could really take pleasure from this if there were a sweeter edge."

"Notes: A straight forward and very drinkable beer. Cheers."

"The palate is similar to the excellent aroma mentioned above, and you see a complex harmony between the American hops and the toasted malt. The finish is dry, leaving a pretty decent reminiscence of the whole story of this beer, told three times (aroma, taste, finish): piney hops and toasty malt. This is an excellent beer, to say the least."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a very nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, orange zest, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and earthy hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of apple, pear, orange zest, caramel, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and hop earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, cracker, biscuit, floral, herbal, light pepper, and earthy hops on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavors with solid robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a very good amber lager. Nice fairly robust flavors with good balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"This one was something I wanted to try for a while, but I never seem to float to the lager section of the liquor store, though I do enjoy a nice pilsner or black lager. It is stated as being a pre-prohibition lager and I understand exactly what they mean as the hops and malt are omnipresent during the entire experience. Poured into a pint glass and the colour was a light ruby red, nice head retention and lacing throughout. It smelled of light caramel malt with some pleasant, aromatic hops on the nose. I drank a couple of them and they flowed nicely. It's really a shame that Americans did the whole Prohibition thing, and I wish they would have bootlegged beer like this throughout as it could destroy any macro side-by-side. Hell, it could snipe down a crap Miller Light from miles away! Enjoy it in the sunshine with a burger or a brat and a side of slaw."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich barley malt, biscuity, caramel, a little toffee. Hop bitterness is medium, floral, citrusy, lemony. Semi-dry finish. Body is light-medium, a little dry in the aftertaste, nice carbonation, very smooth."
""
"Overall: this beer was a complete shock - I was expecting a standard American lager without much flavour, but this delivered a properly good, interesting pale ale / lager cross. Impressive."
""
""
"a lively lager, more fun than most. it pours a lighter amber color, with a short white head that sticks around. the aroma is very crisp, properly a winter lager, a little nutty on the malt profile, with a clean rounded finish. taste follows the nose, and this beer is a dead give away as brooklyn lager every time. its so distinct in terms of balance and richer malts than the industry standard, its really unmistakable. the red malts give it a nice body, not boring at all, and the carbonation is there. overall not the most adventurous or profound thing to come out of brooklyn brewery, but its a really servicable lager. the lager for the pale ale drinker i like to call it. yummy stuff. golf course beer to me at its finest."

"It is what it is; it's hardly a classic. But it does what it does pleasantly enough and I confess to having a soft spot for this one."
"The beer pours a murky light amber bordering on dark mustard yellow with a big creamy white head with sticky lacing leaving creamy patches like spider webs on the glass. The body is clear of particles (obviously) but has a murky look. The beer is transparent with some bubbles, but murky. The beer smells wet and grassy with notes of slightly citrus light caramel malts. From the can the malt smell is much more potent and sweet syrupy, reminding me of rice pudding and candy. The beer tastes quite sweet for a lager with light biscuit, grass and slight citrus. The beer touches the tongue as light citrus apple juice before moving into grassy hops with light citrus and slight bread and then opening into syrupy sweet on sides of the mouth but never striking cloying levels. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and grassy, but overall quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy, leaving the mouth wet with saliva and slightly dry with bitter lingerings. Overall this is a nice beer to put back. I bought a six pack of the cans to session them, and session them I did. The sweet taste is a little too much for what I would normally like, and I kind of wish the grass was more there, but overall a lovely mediocre chugger. This beer will not blow you away, but is solid where it counts."

""
"O: A solid pre-prohibition style lager with plenty of flavor with a full (not light or fizzy) mouthfeel. Nice and malty without overdoing the sweetness. Definitely a solid choice for lager fans"
""
""
"O: I'm really not a fan of the style, but I'm trying to open myself to it. This is decent - balanced with a very restrained metallic flavor. Usually I get a stronger metallic flavor with the style. I get some nice caramel and bready malts in the flavor that I enjoyed, I just find myself wishing it were made with ale yeast."
"Overall – A good herbal and floral lager that is crisp and delicious."

"Pours up with a Blanca head, copper colored, boogie outta control. Smells of hops, German perhaps, nothin crazy, maybe a lil wee bit o' malt. It's nice and bitter, like an American Pilsner only because it's not a true Pils to the best of my lack of knowledge. Sweet lil baby kiss of malts. Nice medium body, good carbo, solid beer. Solid is the word here. Brooklyn is a solid brewery. Not gettin a fully here but I'll remain half-mast"
"Not my favorite style of beer but I found myself having a second and will definitely have this again"
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.92, a solid B+ grade. Brooklyn Lager is one flagship that should be welcomed into Canadian ports with open arms. Few amber lagers that I have tried are of such high quality - and this stuff is noticeably heavier on the American-style hops than most of them, placing it in a comfortable middle ground between ambers and APAs. Well worth purchasing at least once, and something I will probably return to in the future."

"O- A refreshing, easy drinking beer, with still a quite nice amount of complexity and character. Would be a nice regular choice if i could find it for something less than 4€"

"The beer by my favourite writer, I got my hands on it in Pune, a small city in India. The perfect lager in my opinion, this is a real thirst quencher. Not sure how it pours because I drank it from the bottle but the taste is crisp, clean and slightly bitter. It was served cold but tasted nice even when it wasn't so cold!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer. It's definitely refreshing and I could easily have more than one of these. However, it's simplistic and rather one dimensional with caramel malts taking the forefront. The hops are noticeable but are not the saving grace. For the style it's good, but overall it's not great."

"I last enjoyed this beer directly from the bottle. But if I recall correctly from previous experiences, it was of a light amber color with a decent head. The most dominant aroma is malt. This beer is nice and clean tasting, as a lager should be, but then, going against the grain, it has flavor. You can taste malt and there is a decent amount of hop bitterness. If I had to have a (somewhat) widely available lager beer, this would be my choice."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a vasse, the beer is an orange-copper coloring with a sparse, uneven filmy covering. Aromas of roasted grains and floral highlights. Flavors are rich, roasted, and slightly tangy, with a biscuit and toast backbone and some juniper highlights. Roasty and tangy aftertaste, with a sharp, light, and crisp finish. Easy to drink with full body and flavors. Good."
""
""
""
"O: I have to say, I do love lagers. And this one was definitely enjoyable…I’ll have to check out Brooklyn more often from now on. Tasty beer, for sure."

"Overall (4.5): Overall, Brooklyn lager is my favorite amber lager out there, and may even be my favorite lager. I love the sweet malt backbone that contributes to both a lovely aroma and nice balanced taste. Warm, creamy, and malty enough to compete with an amber or brown ale and it looks great in a glass."
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured with a hazy gold color with noticeable carbonation, an uneven bubbly frothy head, and good lacing on the sides. The aromas are a mix of sugars, orange, and grains. Flavoring of the drink had a relative bitter-sweetness and bread or yeast taste. The drink was light and a bit watery, but still refreshing. A better refreshing drink for the evening."
""
"Just a really good beer. And I say that surprisingly. Nothing like I thought it was going to be. Loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber colour with a very dense off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma of malt, corn flakes, hops, and slight fruit and honey. Slightly sweet on the tongue, malty, and bready. Medium body and mouthfeel. Finishes with a bit more of a soft hop background."
"O: Great flavor profile. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Back in 1998 I had my first Brooklyn Lager and I knew then that some 14 years later I would still be enjoying it. Nice amber in a pint glass with plenty of balance. PLenty of hops and malt backbone, but the malt stays with you each sip. Nice finish and plenty of complexity for a session beer. Brooklyn Lager is classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Amber color with medium of-white head with decent lacing. The aroma is sweet, floral, some bready. Taste is medium sweet, floral, some tart. Finish is light grassy and floral. Mild bitterness that doesn't linger. Has a medium body -- readily drinkable."
"O - Worth a 6 pack, at most prices."
""
"Pours amber with a white head. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt and of hops and some sweetness. The flavor of malt hits you up front and the bitterness hops come in to balance it very well. The hop flavor is not overpowering, but it is definitely present. The body is light, but the flavors really help this stand out. The carbonation is just right. This is a solid and very drinkable lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very full flavored and a great example for the style. Quite easy to drink and very much a session beer."
""
"Color is a reddish amber, with a moderate white head. Citrus hops are noticeable in the scent, with some bread and caramel as well - very nice. The taste is bready and nutty, with a touch of floral hops. Quite flavorful and complex compared to most lagers I've had. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Has to be one of the top of its style."
""
"O: A truly astonishing lager. I've had this beer so many times i'm taking it for granted. When sitting down reviewing this beer I realize how great it is and why i'm so comfortable having a couple of these from time to time."
"Glad I tried it but won't seek it out again."
"It smells sweet, and is a malty, well balanced lager that tastes very bold of either Saaz or Hellertau hops with a wonderful lagering malt that keeps everything in check. It has a caramely sweetness to it, and as it goes down produces a sweet, dry, yet malty bready flavor. This lager is definitely a step above most others, and can be easily enjoyed any day of the week with any meal!"
"Reddish amber color, and leaves a thin white head that disappates quickly. The smell is very malty with caramel aspects that give hints of honey and lemon. The taste of this lager is crisp and refreshing the sticky sweet malt weighs on your palate in a good way and there is a lemon wheat flavor on the palate that makes this a balanced refreshing brew."
""
"Still a favorite of mine after all these years. This was a staple in my apartment when it first came out. Still like to have it on hand. Huge head that towers over my glass, four fingers plus. Clear reddish amber with mild carbonation. Lots of lace clinging in clumps and rings. Smell has lots of yeasty bread with toasted malt graininess. A nice bit of floral hops and light citrus. A hint of earth sneaking in. Taste is solid with a good balance of malt and hops right up front. Caramel sweetness is couched in malt. A bit of biscuit and a touch of sourdough. Firm hop bitterness balances beautifully. Finish is long and dry with an earthy/citrus hoppiness. Just a touch of citrus and hop oil lingering. Feel is smooth and crisp with a mildly effervescent carbonation that is spot on. Just a great overall beer. Super drinkable with an ability to be a gateway beer while at the same time offer all a sophisticated palate could want. Proud to make this one review number 500."

""
""
"Update( May 9): It's been a several months since I sampled this beer. I put a bottle in the freezer for about 20 minutes, and the temperature was quite good. I noticed more orange rind in the smell and taste. In general, more fruity with a strong orange accent. Quite a good beer at a moderately cold temp."
""
""
"Those new on the scene might appreciate this briefly,but with more experience in the field they'll no longer take the Last Exit to Brooklyn."
""
""
"Overall: Definitely an unexpected lager/pale ale combination, yet Brooklyn pulled it off to make it a well-rounded session beer. This will make it to my kegerator in the future. The lager fans who expect just a caramel/toasted malt presence with this style might not like this one due to the mild hoppiness. I didn't mind it at all..."

"This is a great easy drinking beer and a nice alternative to SA Boston Lager."

"O-a good lager. I've had this brew many times before, not my favorite as I trend toward a hoppier taste."
""
""
""

"Hazed, amber blonde with a big fluffy head of cream colored foam that sticks to the glass. Caramel malt and grassy grain with a touch of lemony hops. Grainy and toasty with nice flavors of caramel, mint and citric hops. Medium light bodied with mild carbonation. A good lager much like Sam Adams BL."

"Very nice - would make a great session lager. Slightly sweet malt with a nice aromatic hop character. Very similar to Sam Adam's Boston lager. Good stuff."
""
""
""

""
"One of the better lagers that Ive had. This offering was very enjoyable, very refreshing, and is recommended."
""
"O - not what I expected from a Lager. Don't know what ""Pre-prohibition"" style means - is this like Anchor Stream - lager yeast at ale temps? I like it, very drinkable. Good transition beer for someone who thinks Bud is good - nothing too scary."

"Overall: Perfect all around beer, no matter how hot or cold it or how your feeling you will adapt lovely to this beer. In essence it might have properties of other famous micro-brewed lagers if you know what I mean. I call Brooklyn lager my number 2 when it comes to lagers you know who's number 1, Enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Brooklyn ""Pre-Prohibition"" Lager pours a couple fingers of dense white foam over a slightly cloudy, effervescent amber brew. The nose is lager yeast funk and sweet, clean light barley malt with notes of honey and spring herbs. The flavor is simple and direct- sweet light malt balanced with mild herbaceous hops. The mouthfeel is round yet light, finishing semi-dry and clean with only a sticky lacing left behind in the glass. This is a deceptively simple lager sold for a premium price- but is it worth it? I would say yes- it's so simple there is nowhere for the Brewmaster to cover his tracks- every element of taste and texture is out in the open, and every element is in perfect balance- sweet, but not insipid, the hop presence just enough to balance the sweetness, pleasant in the mouth but dry enough to be quenching- a nice brew."
"O: good but not great. Could take it or leave it. After having so many different flavorful beers I feel that this beer just couldn't hold its own. Probably not it's fault. It was overshadowed by great beers however."
""
""
""
"O: not bad. Would make an excellent summer or winter session beer. Give it a shot after all it's from Brooklyn Brewery"

"This is a very good lager and very enjoyable. I don't think it is excellent or outstanding, but then again I have never had any Brooklyn brew that I thought was, but, like most of their brews, this is a good beer."
""
""
"O- I'm impressed. I tend to not purchase many lagers but this was a pleasant surprise. Not sure of the price since I didn't buy it, but I'll probably check this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a decent beer with some good drinkability. Mild flavors and bitterness make it easy to consume although slight metallic flavor is a little off-putting."
""
"Overall, a good beer from a good brewery. The brew master says to drink it with a basket of fries, I say drink it with a nice juicy burger with cheese and bacon."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a thin off-white head. The aroma is candy sweet, almost cloying with tangy Noble hops. This is a full bodied lager with a sweet malt flavor that dominates. There is in the flavor a taste that follows the sroma with the Noble hops biting into the sweetness. This is what a lager should be and a good one to introduce your yellow-fizzy stuff friends to."

""

"This beer poured out as a decent looking golden amber color with a foamy white head on top. The head settles and leaves minimal lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer had some caramel elements and some lager yeast aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer was pretty good, it wasn't anything over the top but had a good drinkablity to it. The malts and hops are pretty well balanced in my opinion here. The mouthfeel was pretty good, nicely carbonated and fairly smooth. Overall it's a good drinking beer for anytime of the year."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent lager. Probably one of the best lagers I've ever head. Extremely drinkable, could easily pop a sixer without thinking too hard about it."
""
""
"For some reason, there's something about this beer that doesn't make it great. Perhaps the malts are too strong or the hops are too bitter and generic, but this is just a good/ok beer and nothing exceptional. Worth drinking over a Boston Lager, though, maybe even a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."

"O - Good lager but a little too watery. I would still recommend it."
"The malt backbone is just as broad as the hop character. A solid brew from start to finish, more than enough flavor and complexity to make it interesting enough to want more than just one."
"I give a Schlitz for this solid lager. If it were more cost effective I would gladly give two Schlitz."
"O: Pretty good for a lager, could drink this pretty much anytime, especially from the can."
"Overall: To me, this is like SA Boston Lager's maltier, American cousin. It has many similar aspects in flavour and aroma profile, but just clocks in with a bit more malt sweetness than Sam's amber lager. It's a nice little beer, and I'm glad that even shitty places (selection-wise) usually have this on tap."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is good, but it's just a bit under-carbonated. Maybe this is just an off bottle. The flavor is there though."
"O-A decent lager, would pick up to try and convert BMC drinkers."
"O: Sort of an ubiquitous beer on the East Coast, it seems. I found it to be pretty enjoyable."
"Overall a great beer. Packs a huge amount of flavour for a lager. Could stand with being a bit cheaper cause at the moment it's got a 33% markup on the Sam Adams range when I've seen it. Still a fantastic lager with similarities to Boston Lager but which it ultimately outdoes. Bit harder to session as a result of the massive flavour and slightly higher alcohol."
"O-much better than i originally expected, before opening. a very good lager. this is the first amber lager i have had, and it is a very good start with this type of beer. i would definitely have this again."
"O - A wonderful plain and simple session beer. I'll definitely be picking this brew up whenever I'm in need of a session and find it in the area. Looking forward to visiting the brewery next year."
"O - A top option if looking for a session beer with plenty of flavour."
"Solid brew - nothing to write home about, but still a nice lager that I can see myself picking up now and again."
"O - Excellent lager. Could be more crispier. Nice flavors that enhance the beer character."
"On special at C J's Pub in Kalamazoo for $1.75 a pint. A darker golden brown for a lager beer. Pencil thin head with little lacing. Smell of sweet Malt and grain. Not a lot going for it until you taste it. Nice hop bite with mellow tones of biscuit and rye. Real yummy. Over all great beer for the price. Time to order another."
"I am a fan of Brooklyn beers and whenever I want a simple, quality, easily accessible, local brew I often reach out for a Brooklyn lager."
"Overall, a typical lager, popular for mild palates and drinkers who want a bit of flavor but don't travel too far off the path. Not a repeat purchase for me."
"Overall, this is a really nice lager, and a great everyday beer. I'll try and keep a couple of these in the fridge at all times. Definitely a drinkable choice for a 6-pack and a weekend night."
"O: refreshing on a hot night, but that's the only time I'd choose to turn to it."
"Overall Drinkability - Actually pretty good for a lager. Would have gotten a better score if not for the staleness and astringency."
"O-Overall this is a solid brew. I think I'd take this over Sam Adams Boston Lager. Easy drinking and very flavorful."
"It is very dinkable, but other than that nothing special."
"O - A really nice everyday beer, one I would have again"
"This was poured for me at a bar, but the color was a nice amber color / light copper with a two finger off white head. the smell is very crisp and clean, some noble hops and earthy grains. The taste is very nice, crisp noble hops dominate the aftertaste and I get a toasted barley flavor on the front with a little caramel. Overall I was impressed a mighty fine lager which I'll gladly get again."
"Overall: Very excited for Brooklyn to be coming MN for a while. I always love more drinkable brews and this one is a greatly acceptable choice from here on. Very drinkable and a great future conversion beer for peers."
"Overall: Fantastic lager, lager will never be my style, but I don't mind buying a six pack of this when the situation calls for it!"
"Pours a tranquil clear light copper with lingering off-white head. Small bubbles of carbonation and spots of lacing. Nice aroma of biscuity malt and noble hops, traces of diacetyl. Smooth, crisp taste with a superb balance of malty sweetness up front and mild lingering hop bitterness. Overall a pleasant and full-flavored lager. No yellow fizzy stuff here."
"Little stays with you when you finish as the aftertaste is just a tad too short and thin. I think this suffers from being a beer which, if we are honest, exists outside a clearly identifiable style."
"D - High drinkability. A good sessionable lager with decent flavor. While I prefer the similar Yuengling Traditional Lager, this a great example of the style and easily could takes its place in my fridge."
"Clear, dark golden color. Almost no head, just a couple big bubbles floating around. Nose has a big malty aroma with a lot of grassy earth, almost like I just ripped up a patch of grass. Flavor has a lot of grainy malts but some fruity hops comes through but get covered up by a bitter, grassy dryness. Orange fruit middle but too much of a dirty bitter dryness. This was alright to drink all night at a bar with no selection."
"Comes out of the tap a beautiful clear orange amber with a thick, pale butter-tan head that leaves some substantial lacing. Aroma is strong, malty and slightly fruity. Malty flavor has firm fruity underpinning and a slight hoppy note. Firm-bodied texture is smooth, fizzy and lively. Normally I don’t care much for lagers, but this is a happy exception."
"Overall: excellent session beer, especially in the summer."
"poured from a can into a 4 oz tasting glass"
"A really nice lager with a surprising amount of flavour and a pleasant balance. Not too much aroma but the flavour makes up for it."
"a decent lager, easy drinking for sure and cheap. a few months ago, i had this out of a bottle that was a few months fresher than this can, thought it was hoppier, even a little better. not something i would go out of my way to buy again, but i wouldnt ever turn one down."
"I poured this lager into a pint glass, good initial head that dissipated quickly. Backed by natural light, the beer has a coppery, reddish hue. Very little hop aroma, more complex in it's malty flavor, with decent carbonation. Good lacing, with fine bubbles. I personally feel this a better lager for the fall, or early spring, rather then the summer. Tasty."
"This beer was otherwise ordinary, but the consistency merits giving it really high marks."
"O: A nice and drinkable beer, not as good as a great pilsener, but still a refreshing alternative - like a pale ale - with tasty, meaty food. I think I'd really enjoy this at a BBQ."
"O: Good solid beer to have on hand."
"This is an unusually complex and drinkable lager. Not even comparable to the usual adjuncts, this is my favorite of the style. A real winner."
"O: Pretty good, especially for the style, but not something I'd probably buy twice."
"Overall, not a bad beer, for a lager. LOL It's surely maltier than most lagers and represents the listed style well, but I'd much more appreciative if the finish was cleaned up a little. This would certainly stand up better to BBQ than its lighter cousin."
"Overall a decent beer but I'm not sure I'll go for it again."
"Brooklyn Lager is a nice tasty lager, flavorful and hoppy for the style."
"Wasn't expecting this from a lager, I was a little disappointed because I thought it would have been similar to a Samuel Adams which has a better balance of bitter and sweet. In my opinion a Sam Adams is a much better beer."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style. This is one to sit with for an afternoon."
"Could use more carbonation."
"Overall this was a pretty subdued beer. Nice and light across the pallatte. I get sweetness from the start and it got stronger as the beer warmed. It had a clean flavor without any bitterness. This really hit the spot for an outdoor barbeque."
"Overall, a good lager with a nice bready sweetness and just the right amount of bitter hop flavor. Very balanced. Something nice to have once in awhile, and great for any time that causes for cans. We don't get enough cans around here so this is a top choice for something like that."
"Overall: One of the better lagers which is one of my least favorite genres but I am still impressed with this one."
"O - Very enjoyable."
"Overall pretty good, lighter but full flavor, light malts could have added a bit more of the lager flavors and crisp drier finish but a nice beer overall."
"O- A nice lager. Would be great for someone trying to show a non-craft beer drinking something familiar but superior."
"Pours a crystal clear very light copper hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is cereal,grains,caramel and medicinal hops,the mouthfeel is just above light bodied and has tastes of barley,brown sugar,sticky date pudding,prunes and finished with a bittersweet toffee twist and overall not a bad drop and easy to knock back but nothing over the top by any means cheers."
"O: The lack of carbonation was a little strange, but this is still a good beer."
"Overall a good beer that is true to label as i've found from everything i've come across from these guys."
"That is one nice beer. So glad that we've finally got access to it in Australia. Would love to try it brewery fresh one day."
"Notes: A nice, solid beer, very sessionable. Really quite lovely. This is the kind of lager that all American Brewers should make. Is it more expensive to make it this well?"
"This is probably the smoothest Lager around; incredibly easy going down. The taste is unlike any of your Macro beers and blows a lot of craft Lagers away. This is very tasty in a can."
"The beer poured a copper color more light and amberish. Very biscuity and malty in the nose. Caramel notes as well. Taste has a nice hop bite, somewhat English-y, but more malty and biscuity. Nice mouthfeel- smooth and easy drinking. I will always have love for this beer even though it is not the greatest that I have ever had. Still, a great example of the style."
"Reviewed from notes; poured into pint glass, scent of hops from bottle, pours a 1/8"" head on top of reddish/caramel color. Malty w/a slight hoppiness. Strong flavor nice full mouthfeel w/a balanced finish. Seems stronger then the ABV listed. Another solid entry from the Brooklyn Brewery"
"I wouldn't buy this beer again, unless it was on sale. I mean, it's a typical boring lager. Brooklyn makes a LOT better beers than this. It's just okay…"
"The taste is just excellent. A slight hop punch hidden by the delicious malts and caramel flavor. It tastes a lot bolder than its alcohol by volume. I can't believe I've never tried this because I love it."
"I buy this beer a lot. It's one of my go-to beers. I think it's a very well crafted beer that's easy to enjoy. A good step up from your run of the mill lagers."
"Overall-Great session beer. Highly drinkable, with some very nice flavors. Nothing over the top by any means. I will definitely revisit this beer again. Also very reasonable..."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this flavorful, well balanced lager. I will buy again to sample at my house ""properly"" at a later date in my Sam Adams Pint glass like most of my other samplings."
"O: Highly drinkable."
"O: A very clean lager with a bite of hop bitterness to finish it off. Nothing very spectacular and wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
"LOVE FOR LAGER BUT MOVING ON"
"D: i wouldn't really consider this an american amber lager, but more of an english. just sort of a malty one-note lager. looking for more."
"The body feels a litle syrupy and heavy for the style. Otherwise, pretty good."
"I cracked it open assuming it was more of a pale lager, so i was kinda surprised. I dont tend to love amber ales or lagers, and this isnt my favorite beer, but its certainly not bad, and as i continue through brooklyn's selections i continue to like what i'm seeing from them."
"O: This is still one of my all time favorite lagers. Simple, straight forward and delicious! These are excellent for summer and are extremely refreshing."

"The aroma was striking me as odd when I leaned in, but no so much really in a bad way, but rather just a touch different then what I was expecting. It had a big malt character to it, with lots of wet grass, and earthy, musky smells coming through on it, however, if you looked inside a little deeper, what you found was a very nice, and light citrus noteThis was a highly drinkable session ale for me, and I am not sure what the percentage is here, but it cannot be that high. Really a very nice drinker with a nice light body and a smooth creamy finish with more then adequate carbonation. The flavor was light enough to not really overpower in one direction or the other, but at the same time, it also had more then enough going for it to keep you interested throughout. Nice bready malts popping up for me first, really earthy grainy like flavor, but this was soon passed up by a nice bright spot of floral hops. Really nicely balanced. Not sure what to call the style, other then a nice American lager. A touch sweet on the finish, before drying out and getting you ready for the next sip."
"This beer pours a clear, pale gold with no head or lace. It's aroma is of fruit, bread, and caramel. The flavor is fruity with sweet malt notes followed by a hop bitterness that lasts from start to finish. The flavor is more reminiscent of an APA than a lager and leaves a lasting, dry, bitter, aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light. Brooklyn Lager is a mediochre beer, not recommended."
"Very enjoyable brew. This would be a good canned beer for a fishin' trip or day at the beach."
"This is an old favorite of mine. A high quality, easy drinking beer that's priced right and commonly found around where I live in Ohio."
"O: Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer. Something you can just sit back and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is very good: smooth, nice amount of bubbles. Overall, a very drinkable lager. Simple, to be sure, but still very crisp and easy to like."
"O: Crisp, refreshing, easy drinking, a nice lager."
"Another new-to-Minnesota beer, I thought this was a pale lager when I bought it but find that it is an amber lager. Not my favorite flavor combination, but I'll still try the other Brooklyn beers."
"I've never had another lager quite like this, with its solid hop presence. I'd love to see more."
"Overall, a nice beer. It's flavorful, but light enough that it refreshing and drinkable."
"Very clean finish with residual maltiness. I think this is a great all-around beer. Less American style, more S. German style."
"Dr: ABV is disguised, contrary to the smell of the beer. The major flaw is the price. Give it a go."
"Overall: A very solid lager. One of the best American lagers I've had."
"Bronzed color....nice lacing....nice malt forward lager but hops are not short changed either....maltiness is light caramel....hops floral and earthy...this lager has some character...retains its drinkability level nicely....reminds me some of Sammy Boston Lager...Nicely done...great BBQ beer...crisp...light side of medium bodied..."
"Overall, a good beer especially for someone new to craft brews and more acquainted with adjunct lagers."
"Overall, I like that this has more of a roasted character than other lagers I've had. The slighly amped up hoppiness also saves this from being too easy-drinking."
"M & D - Very light and crisp. Nice carbonation. This one was designed to appeal to the masses. Very well-balanced, but nothing extremely exciting. I would certainly try another."
"Overall, Brooklyn Lager is a clean, refreshing, easy-to-drink beer. Light to moderate-bodied, and pretty darn tasty. This is a beer that could be paired with just about any cuisine."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The aftertaste has floral hop bitterness. A nice amber lager. It does nothing to blow my mind, but is a solid offering."
"Poured a 2.5"" head which took a while to settle down. Lots of effervescence in the glass. Dark amber color. Otherwise both the smell and taste could have been most any other American lager. So to me this is a really good looking version of the same old thing. But I love lots of Brooklyn's other specialty beers and this one is clearly a mass production version."
"O: There is nothing interesting about this beer to me, and I would not recommend it."
"Overall: quite nice. Brooklyn Lager is really starting to grow on me. It was one of the earliest craft beers and I remember not liking it at all. In the span of a month, I've had it in the can and on tap and both have really impressed me. Think a more hoppy, flavorful Boston Lager and you have Brooklyn Lager. Certain worth a try!"
"The mouth is good and very appropriate to style with the level of carbonation and body. Overall, the beer is good and very drinkable. Nice work from brooklyn."
"O- this is the flagship brew for brooklyn its pretty tasty ,well made but i dont see buying alot of this one..i will drink it again for sure but only in single or on tap"
"The beer pours a clear bronze-amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel with a really nice floral hop presence. The taste is very balanced with caramel and floral hops each trying to dominate the other. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a really good beer. I can see myself drinking this beer often."
"Overall: Other than a couple Pilsners out there, this is about as good as an everyday lower alcohol lager can get. This should be bigger than Sam Adams Boston Lager. But New York is always better than Boston, right? Just kidding, I am from Minnesota and really couldn't care less about the rivalry."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/4; Aroma 3.5/4; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"Brooklyn Lager is even better on tap, especially from a fresh, cold keg, the closer to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the better. Expect a frothier, lacier, maltier, more complex experience, and expect to get to know the bartender by first name by the time you're done."
"A very well crafted beer that should appeal to just about anyone. Sessionable brew that stands up to the best of them in the style."
"Went out to dinner with the Mrs. and some friends and the Brooklyn Lager was on tap....so I had to partake!!! The Brooklyn lager is a Amber in color, with thin clear head. There was not much nose on this beer so I really couldnt get too excited. The taste was a solid lager. As it warmed up it started to remind me, albeit very slightly, a little like Samuel Adams. The mouth feel was decent and I could SESSION this beer."
"Overall, a really solid lager. Really easy drinking. I like this one."
"Pours a clear amber tone with caronation evident. Medium fizzy head dissipates quickly. Lovely malt aroma mixed in with nice flowery aroma accents. The beer has a nice firm body. There is a slight bitterness present. Maltiness is average. For european style pilsener, I was expecting a little bit more of a bite. This is a decent brew however."
"A welcome addition to the selection in the stores of the UK."
"Medium body, normal carbonation, a little sticky. This is one of those beers that's an awesome find at a sporting event or random bar, but not something I'd necessarily buy or seek out (If that makes sense)."
"D Drinkable, mild amber lager."
"D. A pleasant, clean drinking lager, not quite as good as Sam Adams Boston Lager IMO."
"Overall a great session beer, one of the best out there. Good balance of hop and malt character with just the right amount of body and carbonation."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As stated, very light bodied and packed with floral notes. A good overall lager but not close to being my favorite amber. Easily drinkable in any fashion."
"D: It goes down easily, I can see eating with this beer. Certainly not a dessert unto itself. Id go back for another one."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but I wasn't completely blown away. I would consider having again if I was in the mood for a lager and the price was right."
"D - Pretty drinkable lager, glad I had tried it but not overly impressed. I wouldn't seek this brew out but glad I had it"
"D- Probably the best amber/red lager I have had to date. Well balanced and wonderfully tasty."
"O - Very easy to drink, either on its own or as a session."
"D: refreshing when warm, less so when warm (but that makes sense for the style). It's basically a slightly more malty/hoppy macro lager, short on the flavor and complexity, long on the drinkability, but then again drinkability isn't everything."
"D: This was a different lager then what i've ever had. But it was a good different. I'd have no problem having a bunch of these."
"This is a great beer and is an easy drinker, but has a ton a flavor."
"Regardless this is pretty easy drinking with some good qualities to be had."
"I'm very happy to see this in cans at last, and 16oz cans too. And at 5.2% it's very sessionable."
"D - Very very drinkable. Could drink this all day every day and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite session beers of all time. Will be getting this a LOT in the future."
"Pour yields a brew with an amber body and a pretty big off-white head that leaves behind gobs and gobs of lacing. Head goes from a few fingers to a nice, stead half-finger. The nose has some light malt and a bit of earthiness. Nothing too complex, but it's done well. The taste improves upon this with a nice dry malt presence and a bit of light earthy hops. Slightly bitter in the finish. Seems to be part hops and part tannins. Body is light to medium. Good carbonation as well. Drinks really quite well. A solid brew that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Well-crafted and session-worthy."
" Right on."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"Overall: Good beer overall. This isn't something I'll actively seek out, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered to me. It's worth trying."
"D: This is easily the best Lager I've had and it goes down incredibly easily. This is close to a perfect session beer/lager."
"A very nice, well balanced lager. Malty and hoppy with a bitterness that balances ou towards the end of the drink. Very refreshing and drinkable, possibly one of the best lagers. Plain tasting but that is to be expected of a lager. I would definitely get this again."
"Drink - it seems like you can have quite a few and not really feel it."
"Took a bottle of this and poured it into my all purpose handy-dandy glass and see a medium amber body with a light creamy tan head. The scent is full of grapefruit and the foam head tastes more like grapefruit juice than beer. The taste is long on citrusy hops with a short start of light toasted malts. It feels good in the mouth, not thin or watery, but still light with a touch of limgering creaminess. Slightly hoppier than I prefer but very good and I can honestly say it's very tasty and would probably be a good brew for a hot summer afternoon."
"Problem with this particular beer it was a little past its prime. A little flat in initial smell. Overall, great beer."
"D: Not a ton going on in this beer but a nice all around lager."
"Overall: Seems I haven't found a Brooklyn beer I love. Gonna keep trying though..."
"D- Drinks clean and crisp can pair with just about anything, for your buck a great deal."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, goes down easily, pleasant but not spectacular"
"A good, solid lager for any occasion. Much better then BMC. On par with Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"Pours a clear amber orange with a bit of whitehead. A bit of nice lacing. Smells malty and good. Honestly. A better smell than i was expecting. Tastes really malty and smooth. A bit of hoppiness on the forefront but very balanced. Very well carbonated. Crisp and smooth. Honestly, way tastier than expected."
"So this is the Brooklyn Lager, eh? Seen it zillions of times, but this is my first meeting. I like it, it's solid, and it has a good bit of personality that makes it stand out just enough to recommend."
"D - Very easy going down. Even a 6 pack is gone very fast by myself!"
"D- Absolutely one of the most perfectly balanced and flavoral beers available. This is about as pleasureable and drinkable beer there is. Brooklyn knocked it out of the park with this one. For my money, one of the best beers out there."
"I have had this beer a number of times but I have never felt compelled to review it. I heard it was good, but I have never found it remarkable. It is not a bad beer, but there are definitely other flavorful lagers out there."
"D - Not bad. A good beer that you can enjoy for a long while without it getting overpowering."
"Great job!"
"Once again, it's really nice to have Brooklyn distributing here. I just wish I could find this beer a little easier!"
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down easy, and it is a great tasting lager. I think I would choose this over any lager I've had in the past. I think Brooklyn Brewery did a great job with this beer. I would gladly drink this beer again."
"This is a pretty nice beer, there is good balanced flavor and is very easy to drink. I wouldn't mind drinking this again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a 16oz pint glass. The appearance is one you would expect from an amber lager, reddish, gold transparent tint with a frothy white head on top. Smells delicious, and tastes delicious, smooth sweet caramel flavor with a big malty finish. Very good session beer, I'll probably drink it's 5 other buddies tonight, yum."
"I've heard good things about Brooklyn Brewery so I was a little bit disappointed with this offering. It's certainly not bad, but there's nothing special about it. Pretty drinkable, but not good enough to make me want to drink a bunch of it."
"D - A very flavourful offering, and a pleasure to see on tap at the local Irish pub. Easily sessionable with a nice hop/malt balance, likely a go-to offering at this establishment in the future."
"(76)"
"I went through 5 gallons on my home tap, and I checked the labeling multiple times to make sure that I had the right beer. If it wasn't so clearly marked, I could have sworn that this was a pale ale or even an IPA. The beer pours with a deep yellow-amber color and a thick, creamy off-white head. The aroma and flavor are much more hop-forward than expected, with prominent notes of grapefruit and grass, but there is also a substantial caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel seemed even more off-style, with a much more resinous texture and little of the crispness I expected (and desired) from a lager, even from an American amber lager. Overall, it was different, interesting, and quite unexpected, but it was just too far from what I was looking for in a good lager."
"Drink - I drink this beer quite a bit.. It's an above average beer that never lets me down."
"Has a nice fruity aroma that reminds me of an IPA. Has a nice deep amber color with about a one finger head that laces nicely. Has a int of hops with bitter bite that fades quickly. The taste seems intimating at first but then seems to mellow. Carbonation has a nice zing to it. Not a bad beer overall that seems to have a nice balance to it. I'm not sure if I'd buy it again but I would refuse one if offered."
"taste little bitter yet had some sweetness to it. also malty/citrusy/hoppy. smooth but well carbonated - good drinkability."
"I really wish I could get this locally, I hear it's affordable. Great hop flavors."
"Drinkability - Another enjoyable beer that would make for a great session beer. I truly think this is a beer i would stock and share with friends!"
"D: It is slightly less smooth and crisp than I was hoping it would be."
"12 oz. bottle. The beer is amber in color with anice, foamy, white head. Aroma is of bread with a touch of hops. Hops hit you right away (almost IPA like) and linger for a while. Sweet malt is muted compared to hops. Too hoppy for Vienna but great lager nevertheless."
"drinkability: unique lager with its larger hop influence, fresh tasting ingredients; makes for a good casual drinking beer."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but not too flavorful."
"RJT"
"The beer pours an orange color with a smaller white head. The aroma is a lot of biscuit malt with some floral and fruity notes. The flavor is biscuit malt, flowers, grassy hops and a little bit of fruit. The beer is very clean tasting and very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkable enough though."
"I'll select this beer again at bars that have it on tap when it's only up against a few other beers, but it's hardly going to win me over when I'm staring at a store shelf full of selection."
"D: Pretty bland. Not my cup of beer. I'd probably rather have one of the better American adjunct lager over this."
"Poor head of less than a finger and went poof in about 15 seconds. Lace is splochy and no cling. Color is a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells like barley, and wet wheat. Tastes are roasted wheat, malt, and yeast. Mouthfeel is adequate, but nothing special. Just does not have much going for, flavor just sort of sends me the wrong way."
"D- This was a very impressive lager. I was really surprised by the amount of bitterness in the finish of this beer. The brewers of Brooklyn have done a wonderful job balancing the malt and hops. Will have it again for sure."
"Pours a clear golden amber, with a nice white lasting head. Aroma of fruity floral hops with some malt. Taste is toasted malts with some light bitter hops. Nice medium body, crisp mouth feel, moderate carbonation. Finish is toasted sweet malts with some bitter hops, there is a lingering nutty malty ending. Overall a very good, refreshing, easy drinking and mellow lager"
"Much darker than your average lager. It is dull amber, and looks and tastes almost identical to Anchor Steam. Anchor Steam is one of my all time favorites, so in my opinion this is quite a good beer, even if hackneyed from the original. The smell is subdued, a bit earthy with slight nuttiness and faint caramel. The taste is great: mellow fruit, rich walnut, slight floral hints at the edges, clean malt with a dry hop finish that is nearly perfect. It is a heavier beer than a macro lager, but refreshing and crisp with a little extra heft. There is a crisp hop dryness at the finish which is sublime. This was an instant favorite when I tried it at Roscoe Village Tap last summer, and in six pack form it is excellent. Highly recommended. But, I do question the authenticity of their recipe, because this is a near match to Anchor Steam in color, flavor, and body."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite lagers. On draft w/ a good pizza is an unbeatable combo."
"D: This is a quality brew from one of the companies that started the movement."
"The taste was a fine balance of the sweetness of caramel, brown bread backed by a heady array of floral and slightly citric hops. I can swear that I have never experienced this quantum of hoppy juiciness in a lager before. Very surprising and very enjoyable. The body was rather a little oily, that prefer my lagers (and a hoppy one at that) to be a little bouncy - although it was well carbonated, the mouthfeel was slicker than what I'd prefer. But this in no way hampered its drinkability - I could easily have a few without batting an eyelid. Its enjoyable and light on your gut. Overall, a great beer to crack open any time of the year."
"Drinkability: hop and malt balance was good. Good for the style."
"This is a very good beer. It's an excellent choice for the hop-head who wants something a bit lighter and less aggressive than the IPAs of the world."
"D-Quite drinkable. Oh only if this was how most lagers tasted."
"Good beer."
"Solid offering from a solid brewery. Not the typical larger as it was much more ""red"" than I expected but is fit the style perfectly and it really a start of the Red Larger category. This is recommended for both the enthusist and the every day beer drinker."
"A pleasant enough, generally lively all-malt lager. This seems to be a proper go-between amongst BMC's best faux-craft offerings, and the headiest of neo-German brewing provocateurs active in those United States. Tasty, and just the sort of thing one might slam a sixer of without moral sidesteps during yer best backyard BBQs of the season."
"It's a very nice lager. Lots of good hop flavor."
"Taste starts with moderate maltiness, some lemony notes in the middle, and closes with pine bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. All around enjoyable brew that sessions with ease."
"Cloudy in appearance with a deep golden color. Head is a thick white foam with lots of staying power. Citrusy hop aroma. Biscuity malt flavor with lots of citrusy and spicy hop flavor. Tastes like cascade hops mixed with continental noble hops. I'm not crazy about the citrus hop flavor in a medium bodies lager. In my opinion this would work better with a little more malt presence and alcohol strength."
"Pours a good copper color with a decent sized head. Smells of hop fragrance and some malts. Tastes more of hops than your general lager but is mellowed out by tasty malts that add a slightly honey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average, somewhat thin. Highly drinkable for beer lovers and beer novices alike."
"I didn't love the smell. All I got was yeast with a bit of hops. The taste was lovely: citrusses hops that fade into a mellow honey aftertaste. This beer has a great medium body - I was surprised how thick it was. A very nice beer; it went down well."
"I vastly prefer this over Boston Lager. Might be the hop profile, or just the bigger nose and lighter body, but Brooklyn Lager is a winner and I now understand why it's their flagship."
"Foamy, agreeable mouthfeel exceptional drinkabiliy. If this is indeed what our preProhibition forebears routinely drank, they are to be envied at least on that score."
"You almost forget that you're drinking a lager. It has a tea like quality. Wonderful citrus aftertaste.."
"A very nice lager, and a refreshing accessible beer. Seems to fill the same niche that SA Boston Lager does. A nice, balanced lager with some hop presence. Good for breaking in a craft newbie or enjoying with a meal or with friends."
"Highly recommended."
"Highly drinkable lager, a standout in the category. Very clean and balanced hoppy lager. Will enjoy again in the future."
"MF/D: nothing special in the mouth, neither heavy or light. a great sessionable summer afternoon beer."
"One of my favourite lagers available at the LCBO. Provides a nice splash of hops that aren't too overpowering and is not heavy feeling at all. A perfect summer time session lager."
"Cheers!"
"Great mouthfeel and carbonation. A perfect session beer. Really enjoyed this one"
"Overall impression: I could defiantly see myself purchasing a 6-er of this. It wasn't a knock out beer, but for a readily available micro brew this was solid. No complaints here."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough and crisp. Drinkability is very good. Goes down easy, good solid flavor. This is what a lager should be."
"D: Excellent lager. Good brew anytime, any place."
"Not just a hot weather lager I guess, this one has a bigger flavor profile than most."
"It is simple but clean and effective."
"d-These go down well...I could do these as a session beer no prob. Will get again."
"Pics at: http://wp.me/pNKWo-7U"
"Yes, as an ""anytime"" beer."
"Well, it looks and smells good, but I'm not 100% into the taste and feel. Miss a solid bitterness, the sweet tones remains behind the bitterness, which actually makes me more thirsty."
"Clear light amber with a finger of off-white head. Thin cap of retention and tons of lacing. The aromas are quite malty, with more toastiness and caramel than anything else. Something baked and sweet in the aromas, too. Biscuit bordering on cookies. Flavors are mild. More than anything, it's a toasted biscuit. Not a lot of hoppiness in there that goes beyond ""bitter"". A slight astringency is killing the flavor a bit. Mouthfeel is medium body with mild carbonation. I don't know if I would recommend this one. Maybe to folks who are newer to the craft scene?"
"Nice work Mr. Oliver!"
"It would be nice if the lagers produced in Brazil were like Brooklyn. Amber color. Like all Brooklyn beers that I´ve tasted, it has a salty, but nice flavor. Aroma: floral, herbal, citric and malts. Taste: well balanced hops, something sweet and salty. Mild carbonation. High drinkability. Pleasant bitter end."
"Clear amber color with a solid two fingers of white head that hung on for a long time. The head settled to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Quite the hoppy little lager we have here. Floral and slightly citrus aroma with just a hint of a bready malt base. The hops play a large role in the flavor as well. The spice from the hops compliments the dry, bready malt flavor. I would bump the score up a bit if it was a little bigger beer in the malt department. But as it is, a good light bodied, flavorful lager that is easy to drink. No surprise this is Brooklyn Brewery's top selling beer."
"D - Pretty solid and enjoyable drink. It is what it is. Great for summer drinking."
"DB/Conclusion- Refreshing lager with maybe the best lager flavor I have come across. Well balanced and smooth, could be a great session beer, great example of the style."
" An American classic for the style, this is what it should be folks!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp pale orange with a decent diminishing off white head that leaves a trace of lacing on the top of the glass. Aroma is pale malts and mild earthy hops. The taste is a nice amount of sweet Malta in front of a nice citrus hops backbone that leaves just a touch of bitterness in the finish. The beer is quite light, smooth, and refreshing. I'll admit, I didn't expect much when I ordered this one, but it is a great beer for a hot Summer afternoon."
"Not incredibly complex but I really don't think that's what they were going for. Pleasant and easy to drink, I probably wouldn't seek it out on a regular basis but definitely wouldn't complain if it were the only option at a backyard barbecue or in a similar setting."
"Honestly, one of the easiest drinking lagers out there and a prime example of how they should be."
"Drinkability - A very drinkable beer. My overall impression at this sitting was unremarkable. But I have enjoyed this beer right out of the bottle too."
"D: This is a delicious beer. Easy to drink with enough body and girth to make it feel like you're drinking something substantial."
"O: Really nice lager, but could be better."
"D - I could easily session this baby. Good does of hops and the regulation ABV makes this a decent lager."
"Poured copper/amber, with a heavy dose of carbonation, two fingers of white, good head retention, and good lacing. Smelled of biscuit, malt, pear, grass, and herbal hops. Nice to see what a good lager is capable of smelling like. The taste yielded a nicely balanced herbal/grassy/malty mix that progressed to a crisp dry finish, and left malty hints afterwards. More pear fruitiness was revealed as it warmed towards room temperature. The mouthfeel was a perfectly carbonated medium body. An excellent session lager."
"The beer pours golden brown with a thick half inch white head. The first sip brings a malty flavor, a bit sour, but refreshing. Drinks fast without a hint of alcohol. A good lager for a summer afternoon BBQ. When Sam Adams goes sweet, this goes bitter. Very drinkable. One of my favorites."
"Pours a clear amber with an offwhite head. Smells of citrus fruit peel. Taste is a light caramel sweetness, followed by a very herbal, earthy, Floral, hop flavor and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is average, so is carbonation. Very good drinkability, I could drink several. A nice refreshing beer."
"D: Yes sir pour me another. I like this beer. It may well become a staple in my household. Like I said it is the sweet and sour of the beer world. I want to drink it with Chinese food."
"D -- Not bad, but the hops get a little heavy after a couple. I have to wonder if this recipe wasn't developed as a match to Sam Adams Boston Lager. It is nearly identical in profile, save for being a little heavier in body."
"Drinkability - I really like this beer. I could drink this at any time during the year. Not real heavy. Good all around beer. I will definitely pick this up again."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite of Brooklyn's ""Party Mix"" pack. A good, highly drinkable and sessionable lager. A beer lighter on hops, but with very refined malt flavors. Worth a taste."
"D - A nice, sessionable lager; well balanced and easy on the palate."
"D: This is a very good lager, one of my favorites actually. This is a great beer for hanging around the grill, or just making a night of it."
"d - This beer is very easy to drink and a very solid amber ale. Have had many times again and something I will definitely buy again."
"D - An excellent lager. Easy drinking yet still has a nice full flavour. A good summer beer and would be a good any time beer."
"This is only the second beer I've tried from Brooklyn, the first being the chocolate stout and I was quite impressed with that wish I could get more up in Canada, but it is what is."
"An East Coast classic. Glad to see Brooklyn add cans to their portfolio."
"D: Easy to drink, more so than most beers."
"I like this beer and recommend it highly. It's great looking, with a unique flavor profile (to me) and is so very drinkable. I think this is my third 6-pack in 2 or 3 months. I look forward to trying Brooklyn's other beers."
"D-I really like this brew a lot. Easy drinking but sophisticated enough where I'm still interested in the beer. Very nice effort from Brooklyn."
"Brooklyn Lager appears a slightly dark brown shade. Atop the beer rests a small head that fades after a few moments, leaving no trace on the glass. Aromas are fairly weak, though I don't expect huge scents from a session lager. The taste is very refreshing and light, with a hearty malt backbone that gives the beer a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. This is a solid example of the style and a good, lighter abv beer."
"Overall, quite drinkable, a beer that goes well with a game of cornhole!"
"Notes: A really solid American Craft Lager. I do not pick up any factors that could be explained by the idea that it was from a can (metalic taste...etc.)."
"[draft at The Distillery - Rochester, NY] Very light aroma, nice deep amber color with nice lacing, small tan head. Wonderful flavor of fruit mixed with hops. Medium body with a slightly bitter twang to it. The finish is smooth with very little aftertaste. I did not know what to expect from it but I was surprised and pleased."
"D - This goes down easy, definitely wouldn't turn one down, one of the better lagers I have had."
"D-It was what I was told it would be...a malty lager. Not a bad beer overall although I was expecting and hoping for more."
"Pours a clean yellow to copper color with a big off white head. In the aroma, a sweeter malt and small Saaz/ pilsner hops. In the taste, a smooth, sweet maltiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dryness, yet mainly clean aftertaste. A nice lager, nice body clean and fresh."
"D: A fabulous looking brew that really doesn't live up to its presentation. This one isn't anything special beyond its appearance. Not quenching, fruity, or hoppy, but rather just kind of bland in a mundane, metallic sort of way. A bit too overcarbonated also. Widely available so I'll drink it if its the only thing offered but really nothing to write home or even get excited about."
"9/10 beers I buy are ales, because my experience with lagers has been pretty lackluster. This really is one of the best lagers I've ever had."
"D- Drinkablity is great and easy at that. Its a drinker and alot of at that! Cheers!"
"Brooklyn Lager pours a deep red in my Duvel tulip, halfway to brown. The head is off white with just a hint of tan mixed in, and is impressive both in size (2+ fingers) and staying power and lacing. The nose is a mixture of biscuity malts and floral and earthy hops. As I sip on Brooklyn Lager I immediately pick up on the biscuity malt flavor again before a brief flash of bitterness signals the arrival of the hop flavors, still earthy and floral (I still can't detect the Cascade hops that went into this beer). The beer closes with a caramel flourish, but somehow all the pieces here just don't work together like they do in many of my favorite beers. The mouthfeel is average, but the carbonation doesn't seem to last with each sip, and gives the impression that it's a bit lacking. Brooklyn Lager is a serviceable beer, but doesn't compare to some of the brewery's more exciting beers."
"A solid, solid beer. Pouring a clear amber with a dense light brown head with decent retention, there's not much lace. The nose is solid. A moderate hop character is present, earthy and leafy with a robust malt backbone with aromas of toast, caramel and a little bread as well. The palate opens a blend of moderate earthy hop character with a good balance between the flavor and bitterness, and a robust malt character, toasty, a little bready and with some caramel. I'm rather surprised by the moderate fruit character as well, with a light, ripe fruits. While not unwelcome, it is unconventional. Drying and hoppy on the finish, this beer has a moderate level of carbonation. Very drinkable, I'm glad this is available in cans now."
"If it's a hot day and you're in the mood for a nice malty beer go for this, even though it's so well balanced. I could drink this year round, a solid standby."
"a lager with the feel of a pale but without the loss in light body. nice. thought it was a mild english pale at first. but clear. orange. nice head some lace. nice of sun tea sweetened with honey. a bit of pollen flower. palate is like but full. a good beer to have in the summer for sure."
"D. Very drinkable. The wife and I are big fans of this beer; we've been discussing grabbing this next year for our summer beer."
"The drinkability is very good, and even though I've only had this beer a few times it's become one of my favorites. There are quite a few bland lagers on the market, but this problem is especially bad where I live in Japan because lager is the dominant style for the major domestic brewers. It's refreshing to have one like this which actually offers up some complexity and taste to chew on!"
"Nice lip-smacking malty mouthfeel. Solid carbonation. Feels smooth and invigorating going down. Yessir, I could drink a few of these."
"Drinkability: This is my new, go to everyday beer. light and easy drinking with tons of flavor. move over yuengling."
"overall its a solid lager, probably my go to lager b/c local always wins."
"This is definitely my beer of choice when faced with a bank of lagers and ""big"" names. Absolutely will drink again."
"Drink: As drinkable as any other amber, maybe a bit more-so due to the presence of a few nice flavors."
"One of my fondest days was when I got to meet Garrett Oliver at a beer tasting and ask him his brewing philosophy. He said that one of the things he keeps in the forefront of his mind when he tastes a beer is whether or not the beer exhausts the palate. It can be the most interesting single sip in the world, but if you can't finish the beer, he isn't interested. Mission accomplished on this one."
"Extremely drinkable, full flavored lager."
"I've always seen this lager posted on bar menus in NJ, so I finally decided to try a taste last weekend. I was thoroughly impressed with the color and smell. Coloring of the beer was a dark medium brown (darker than Yuengling and lighter than Sam Adams). The sweetness of the beer gave it a nice floral aroma. My palate was impressed with a really nice balance of flavors. This beer is not overpowering and complements pizza very well. I would recommend Brooklyn Lager over Sam Adams Boston Lager any day of the week."
"Two thumbs up over here for this beer. Its definably session-able."
"nice pale orange color. frothy white head with a surprising amount of lacing. the nose is mostly pils like malts and grassy hops. a fairly strong nose on this one. clean pale and pils malts with a pleasant sweetness before a bitter drying finish. a little earthy grassiness from the hops. a nice full body for a lager with crisp carbonation and a good clean dry finish. a great feel that helps this beer slide down extra smooth."
"D - Pleasantly surprised with this beer. Wasn't expecting a lot, but will definitely have more of these. Bought this one as a single from Total Wine & More, but will have a 6-pack or more next go-round."
"Great all-arounder"
"I checked out their website. Looks like a nice bunch of people running/working at the place. I also see their other creations are very well rated. I may try some of their other offerings."
"D- This is an average beer but it is way better than most other amber lagers around. Its great for a warm weather session. This would be a good beer to have around a BBQ."
"M/D: I like Brooklyn, this is an easy going beer, Very easy to drink. This is a great beer to bring to a BBQ, it would be something most people would enjoy."
"d-good drinkability because of smoothness"
"Fantastic lager."
"Poured from my growler a golden amber color with about 2 inches of tan foamy head. Faint smells of roasted nuts but mostly malts. Caramel flavors, candied malts, and a faint bit of hops. Flavor is very drinkable nothing to special. Mouthfeel is smooth and very drinkable."
"Very good drinkability. Another well-rounded beer that drinks easily."
"Once served in my ""Club America mug"". Look: Bright amber color, fat foamy head, acceptable duration and good lacing. smell: Biscuity malts and floral hops. Taste: Biscuity malt and semi roasted malt, a background of floral hops and grains, the malt character dominates. Mouthfeel: Dry, crisp, medium bitterness, medium to robust body (somewhat creamy). Drinkability: Nothing to criticize, probably the best red lager i drank."
"Not a bad lager, not a great lager. Certainly way better than most of the selection around here, kinda a toss up between this or Creemore."
"My conclusion is this, if you're stuck in a room with the big brands or a bottle of this, you take this, but if you had a craft beer selection, then you don't pick this."
"Sinkability - Well I couldn't really pour this in the sink because I was at the pub, but I was drinking it so slow that the barmaid came over while I still had half a pint left and asked me if I wanted something else. I have had so many good beers from this brewery it's hard to believe that this came from the same place."
"I would have no problems keeping a 6pk of this handy"
"Pours a clear dark copper color with a nice white head with decent retention, leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma is fairly mild with citrus and floral hops and a tiny bit of sweet malt. The malt is more pronounced in the taste, and nicely balanced with the hops. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied. This wasn't quite what I was expecting; this didn't taste like a typical lager. But regardless, this is a very good beer!"
"Lots o' hops for a lager, from my experience this is a bit different than most others I've had. Orange amber in color with some lacing, it has a strong floral hop aroma on the pour. The upfront flavor is similar to the smell, floral/herbal hops. Has a malt backbone and a trace of some sweet wheat/grain. Feel is about what I'd expect, nothing remarkable. Would buy again."
"D: very highly drinkable, great balance, nice crisp and refreshing flavor that gives off a nice malty profile"
"D: Very drinkable, but too many hops to be a guzzler for me. You need to slow down a little when drinking this one. Not your typical lager. Lots more hops than I expected. I think it would be a really nice brew to cut through the cheese and sauce of a pizza. Definitely reminds me of a hoppy American Pale Ale in the mold of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale rather than a red/amber lager. Not really what I'm looking for in a lager."
"A nice little surprise. I bought it and poured it without reading the label properly and was expecting a pale lager. This is a very pleasant red lager with a nice hop kick and slightly creamy malty feel with firm bitterness. This would be a go to beer for me if it were available in Australia. Good stuff."
"Honestly I could confuse this with a pale ale what with the American hops leading the show. Easy to drink but not what i was hoping for when I grabbed a lager. Perhaps with a different mindset this would have been more impressive to me."
"A good drinkable beer, whose only fault is how long it sticks in your mouth after you drink it. To me, that is not what a lager should be. If this is what beers were like pre-prohibition, bring me back there!"
"Definetly nice on a hot day."
"I wish I lived a little closer to the source and could find this on tap more often."
"love the Brooklyn lager... always pick up a six pack when I'm in new york... like the hoops smell and has a great taste that you can drink all night... also had on tap and is also excellent... excellent with hamburgers and other American food and BBQ foods."
"Pours an amber color with a nice creamy head that stays a long time and leaves a lot of lacing. The smell is carmel malt and hops. The taste is carmel malt, hops, and a good amount of citrus notes that I didnt catch in the smell. Nice and crisp, its a little too sweet but it has a good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"I'm not sure exactly what I expected from Brooklyn Lager, but it far exceeded what I thought it would be. Right up there with Boston Lager and Prima Pils with craft lagers I'll be buying when the weather stays warmer."
"A classic lager that is easy to drink.Nice amber color.Slight lacing from a medium head.Huge flavors dont pop out but very drinkable.A great introductory craft I would suppose.If you are in New york or the Tri-state area it is pretty common.Definetly worth a try"
"The definition of a solid lager. Clean, crisp and fresh. Pours a smooth rust with a decent head. Drinks like a beer is supposed to drink. In my opinion, I don't think there is a ""fresher"" smelling or tasting beer out there. The hops are alive.... Love it, give me another!"
"Tastes crisp and malty up front, followed by citrus (maybe lemon or grapefruit), caramel, toasted bread, hops and grain; the malt and caramel brings a sweetness to the end that is crisp and borders on bitter, with a final note of orange peel. The mouthfeel is crisp, but on the smooth side, while the carbonation and body are both medium. This is a very drinkable beer that is quite crisp and refreshing, but the flavor is only above average, even for a lager. Great beer to drink all night, as it seems to flow like water and go down smooth."
"Red amber with a nice off white head that settles away and leaves good lacing. This beer smells of sweet bready malt and fresh lemon grass. The tast is quite wonderful. Much hoppier than I expected with plenty of lemon, herbal and grassy flavors. The malt is caramely, toasty and not too sweet, playing well with the hops to make a balanced presentation.  Nice, slightly creamy mouthfeel with a balanced finish. Very drinkable. I am not generaly a fan of reds, but this one is quite tasty."
"When i took the first sip of this beer i could tell it had a very crisp clean taste to it, very hoppy and it is similar to a Sam Adams lager. i could definatly see my self at a bar drinking these back all night long. i highly recommend this beer to people who have never had it, if u live in new york city you don't have an excuse not to have it because you can get it at almost any bar down there"
"Drinkability - This beer is very easy to drink. A great choice for a kegerator as it's mild enough that most people will drink it, but tastier than your average boring lager."
"one of the better lagers I've had recently and I can't think of any reason you shouldn't try it. I love a great lager and this is a great lager"
"Drinkability: Light, crisp, easy to drink, and with a nice crisp bite--everything you could want in a session beer. Pretty impressive for a lager, since I usually drink heavier stuff."
"drinkability - i am not a lager guy but this is one that could change my mind"
"Quite good Lager. Good quality as the other Brooklyns I've had."
"D-pretty solid mouthfeel, not bad flavor, pretty straight forward. decent session beer."
"Overall a drinkable beer. Been drinking a lot of outstanding beers recently, so this was up against some stiff competition. I probably would have thought this much more flavorful a year or so ago. I could probably drink a few of these working in the yard on a nice summer day."
"While I'm not usually a lager fan, this one was a fairly pleasant break from my usual stouts and porters. If I found my options limited at the liquor store (as was the case when I picked this up), I would probably buy it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"M/D: Pretty easy going down, but doesnt have a whole lot to offer. Exceptionally light for a lager."
"I've sampled this amber colored lager from both tap and bottle now and feel that its carbonation can be slightly overwhelming at first but then overcome by a good medium body. But perhaps I've been drinking too much IPA lately to truly judge my recent first sips of this from tap. It was difficult to detect anything revelatory on my initial smell and mouthfeel but I was impressed with its good drinkability and uncharacteristic load of HOPS. This is a very refreshing lager and my preferred choice over most."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. This would be an excellent beer to session with and one to reach for on a grass cutting day. Nice, easy, refreshing and good."
"D: Lots of flavor all around. Kind of reminiscent of an Oktoberfest (or at least and Octoberfest). Flavor profile is less than clean (almost ale-like) and sort of rustic like maybe beer used to be way back when..."
"D - Drinkability is good. This isn't a beer I would put in regular rotation, but it's not bad at all."
"This is a very sessionable brew and also a good one to convert a BMC as the taste isn't extreme."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this one. For a beer 1 month past its ""best by"" date, it's very sessionable and makes me want to have another one. Makes me wonder how better it would be before its date. Went well with a mild curry dish for dinner."
"EDIT: I see that it's on here as a red lager. That could explain the maltiness that I didn't expect. Either way, good beer."
"I would recommend it to others."
"Value: Overpriced."
"Very pleasant beer. Definitely sessionable, could easily enjoy multiple in a sitting. Not my typical beer but a great option for times a easy drinker is called for. Glad to see this is coming to Kalamazoo."
"D - Good, this is a sessionable beer, especially for hop-heads, or those who are beginning to get into hops. I'd prefer this over pale lagers any time!"
"Drinkability: This is a great lager! It would be one of my go-tos if it was available out here. Thanks again Zach."
"Please realize that this review is per the style and the Brooklyn Lager nailed it. A very fine lager and well affiliiated in the American Amber/Red Lager category."
"D-not as hoppy as Sam's. Lacks that balance one looks for to be a lager"
"Bottle pours a dark clear amber with the slightest haze to it. Lots of foam in this one. Taste is malty with the slightest hint of sweet fruits with a mild hop taste. It is a little on the flat side though, so maybe its an old six pack. Its not bad for a lighter beer, and quite sessionable. But not one I would go out of my way to seek."
"The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and very clean and crisp with a strong carbonation that all pulls together to make an excellent lager. It's smooth, fairly sweet and has none of the skunky characters you sometimes get in a run-of-the-mill lager. Enjoyed this one thoroughly."
"Mouthfeel - A medium body with some carbonation."
"Beer has a lot of malt in it and its medium bordering on high bodied. There are nice citrus hop flavors and some bitterness at the end. Ultimately the beer is a little dry. There is no aftertaste and the drinkability is high. Mouthfeel has nice connectivity and overall is a very good beer. I'm glad I've tried this so many times and in different incarnations."
"Overall I do enjoy this one. Big step up from the macro stuff but I still rate it under Boston Lager even though I know they quasi different styles. May sound crazy but I can't help to wonder how this would be very near or just past the best buy date. I also expect to like it a bit more after warming."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Poured a great amber color with a slightly offwhite head of about one finger that lingered and laced fairly well. Definite lager aroma initially, with ample hops aromas of citrus/floral variety, balanced by a good malty base. Taste is has a good malt flavor with the hops balancing well. Carbonation is about medium, with a good crisp feel and a slight oily afterfeel lingering. Overall a good drinking beer with a sessionable ABV. Definitely one to keep at the ready"
"The finish is very refreshing and it is not too heavy, though not light either, in the mouth. I could definitely drink a few of these sitting around the house or a bar without getting full."
"This is a very enjoyable, sessionable lager. Light on the palate, but it does have some complexity in the flavor."
"Strong bodied but smooth, has substance but light enough to toss a few of these back and hope for more."
"The appearance is great, light fluffy off white foam. light clear yellow red color. i really didn't detect to much from the smell, but there is some good citrusy aromas. taste is great with exceptional mouthfeel. i know this review is brief, but simply put- this is a great beer to convert your friends to good beer.-"
"Easily one of my favorite beers."
"D- Might have been a bad bottle but this was a terrible lager. The style was wrong and it actually tasted more like an Old Ale to me. Might try again in the future to see if I had a bad bottle. I drank this all while think about drain pouring it the entire time."
"Orange copper body with an ivory head. The nose offers sweet toasted malts, a toasty biscuit character and grapefruit peel. Has a pleasant tangerine backing in the taste to go with a freshly baked biscuity sweetness encompassing the malt profile. very drinkable and succulent for the style, I'm not a big lager fan but a sixer of this would be delicious next to most lagers. Mouthfeel is adequately carbonated, somewhat silky and medium dry."
"D/Overall: A real go-to beer that you can find almost anywhere in the City. I could (and often do) put back several of these, making it an excellent session beer."
"D: Great on a snowy night with a bowl of spicy chili, a hot summer night on the roof with bbq, or with dessert. Very drinkable and very pairable with all kinds of food."
"This is seems to be a pretty clean and crisp beer. Has good carbonation and nice foamy white head. It is a golden amber color. It has a faint malty smell. It has a good malty hop after taste, a little weak in the front, but that is okay because it is still a good beer. This is a good lager, smooth, easy drinking, and well balanced."
"D-I wont be buying another 6 pack. Maybe there other offerings are better."
"Drinkability: you know the first pint went down well but after that the bitterness caught up to me making it a bit hard to keep going. It's a great refreshing beer but couldn't drink more then two before calling it quits."
"Drinkability is great, could go all night on these guys. All in all a damn fine lager, well done Brooklyn."
"Overall, a very drinkable and very flavoursome lager. Plenty of character to keep it interesting, but mild enough to be a true session brew."
"Poured into a pint glass. Inticing deep amber colour with fluffy head which settles to around an inch and lasts pretty much all the way down. Lovely grainy smell, nice balance of hop bitterness and sweet malts. Very flavoursome beer - grainy malts hit you up front followed by pine/grassy tones and some caramel. Full mouth feel due to strong carbonation with a crisp finish and some alchohol warmth. A very quaffable brew any time of the year and one I return to frequently. A bottled 6 pack does the job just nicely."
"I poured my Brooklyn Lager into a pilsner glass. The appearance is reddish copper with a thick puffy white head. The smell is of sappy bitter hops and a slight nutty sweetness. The taste is clean with well balanced spicyness. The mouthfeel is more viscus than a typical lager with nice carbonation. Good session beer. If you like Sam Adams Lager, this one is pretty similar, maybe a little less sweet."
"First sip is clean, and a little bit more bitter than your standard lager. Pretty highly carbonated, but the beer has enough backbone to stand up to it. Continuing on, the bitterness in the initial taste fades to a dry malty body. Again, no specific flavors dominate, the malt is very balanced and very generic. Finally, the beer disappears with zero aftertaste. I wouldn't normally object to the presence of aftertaste in beer (assuming it's not actually offensive), but the lack of aftertaste in this particular style makes it remarkably drinkable. I don't understand how anyone could criticize its drinkability."
"Overall, this is a very nice and tasty lager. Although it's just a touch too malty, I think, it still has a nice hop presence. Either way, it's very refreshing and easy-drinking. Definitely worth grabbing a six pack"
"I had two of these alongside an enormous sandwich at the Stage Deli in New York."
"Decent brew for a steak. Paired with a heavy meal, this would be an outstanding offering. On its own, it feels underwhelming and also unappealing on the aroma and overall drinkability. I think I will go grill a strip."
"Cheers!!"
"pretty solid all around if you like the style, and much more hoppy than i expected."
"Cheers to Brooklyn, I'm impressed!"
"every time i got to citi field i drink brooklyn lager best ballpark beer out there! even though the mets always lose, i always win with brooklyn lager!"
"has a rather light copper color to it. very clear and not much density. Head isn't too bad, with some lacing and decent retention. Smells of toffee caramelized malts with a hint of citrus. Taste is a bit lemony but mostly getting the caramelized malts and toffee and with quite a bit of hoppiness. pretty easy to drink this one and feels good in the mouth."
"Pours a deep dark golden almost red color with a two finger fluffy white head that sticks around forever before impaling itself to the edges of my glass. Smell is very floral with a hint of citrus. Sweet malts, a little bread, a little caramel round out the nose. Taste is a little odd for a lager. Sweet up front, caramel and floral hops play off of each other nicely, then a slight mineral taste followed a dry hoppy finish. Medium carbonation, light to medium body, smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. This a great light easy drinking lager."
"Overall, a great tasty lager that's somewhat simple and quite refreshing. Solid 4's across the board, but nothing really stuck out that would make me say this is an excellent beer. Definitely worth the try and would love to try some more of their offerings."
"This is the first Brooklyn beer I tried and is quite the good amber lager."
"If there had been any nose, I'm sure I would have rated the brew higher, but it's still a good session brew."
"M: High carbonation, but works well. Crisp and tasty, this beer is sessionable and delicious. Very pleasently surprised by Brooklyn's most widespread offering."
"Drinkability: Very good. It goes well with hamburgers and it also stands well on its own. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Certainly nothing wrong with the beer does not make me want to drink another though"
"medium body, smooth, with touch of astringency near the finish. crisp moderate carbonation is almost fizzy, but keeps body and smoothness."
"The smell was terrific. Nice balance of malt and hops. Great floral smell. The taste was somewhat similar, a bit more complex with early sweet malt transforming into a nice dry hoppy finish. It has a very refreshing mouthfeel. Substantial but not too heavy. This is now one of my top session beers. Along with Sam Adams they are two great beers you can spend a night or day with."
"D: Excellent. Flavorful lager that goes down easily."
"When drinking it, you can tast the floral hops that were used to make this great drink."
"2 fingers of off-white head float above the clear amber body. The head sticks around for a bit and leaves a little bit of lace behind. It smells of caramel and bread with floral/citric hops. It has a nice citrus rind hop flavour over a biscuit malt base, with a hint of caramel. Starts sweet and finishes with moderate bitterness. Just shy of medium bodied - the carbonation works to lighten it a bit. A nicely balanced lager, easy to drink at summer barbecues or while watching the baseball game."
"D - An ok lager nothing too exciting going on a decent beer over all just ok to me"
"My favorite ""lager", though I've never met another lager quite like this. Pours a beautiful dark-golden brown (it's crayon might be burnt sienna) with a modest head. Citrusy notes in the nose, and those come through, along with a surprising amount of hops, in the taste. Malt only really comes through afterwards, and even then, it stays in the background. An eminently drinkable, refreshing, hoppy lager. My favorite from Brooklyn brewery, probably even surpassing the Black Chocolate Stout."
"Pours an amber with a moderate head that has decent retention. The aroma is a hoppy citrus. The taste is quite refreshing, not your typical lager with the hops. The malt is there, but does not overpower the citrus taste. Lightly carbonated and light bodied. The drinkability is very good for this tasty lager."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and easy to enjoy."
"this is a good session beer really"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is a clear copper that pours with a slight head. The nose is a bit grassy. The flavor is sweet with hints of hay, the finish has a bit of bitterness to it. The beer is light to medium in body with average carbonation. Overall a solid lager."
"Light body, with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. I would have liked it a bit cleaner, but still good."
"One of the most drinkable beers Ive ever had. Light and crisp...but in the good way. Easily the best session lager Ive had yet. Bring this to a party for BMC drinkers and they will more than likely give up there commercial world of crap and join us in the wonderful world of craft."
"This cold brew from can to pint glass shows a very glowing orange amber color with a sturdy off-white head and excellent lacing. The aroma is a surprisingly pleasant malt and floral hop mix, mild but better than most lagers for sure. The flavor gives me a crisp cereal grain with bright floral hops that park on the edge of your tongue. Body is midland for a lager, somewhat creamy but easy going down. There is lots of peppery carbonation and a somewhat thick finish of grainy alcohol with some sweet malt. It's not the most drinkable lager I've ever had, a bit full in it's constitution, but it will suffice for a decent flavored refreshment. While I find this more personable than most lagers, certainly more than the macros by far, it still leaves a bit of an abrasive aftertaste for me, possibly owed a bit to the container but it's hard to say for sure. Just not extremely agreeable, but definitely decent. The hops do become more pronounced as you go, more of a citrus hint too. I'm a bit torn between very good and just good. Lager lovers should be pleased."
"Pours a very nice copper golden with great clarity and lasting foam. It has a great light body and crisp effervescence, and thus is very refreshing. Taste is fairly biscuity and sweet. The finish is quite bitter and dry but this beer is definitely driven by the malts. There's also something sweet in flavor that I can't put my finger on and frankly, I'm not sure how I feel about it. All in all though, this is a tasty lager and I'd be happy to drink it by the liter."
"This is just an all-around solid beer. I've had this quite a few times and seem to have felt differently each time I've had it; maybe I just got lucky with this bottle but whatever is in this one is amazing. I could start drinking this at lunch and keep drinking it until I go to bed, it's that drinkable."
"Nothing memorable, but definitely pleasant and drinkable."
"Cheers to you Brookyln Brewery for getting in there and hopefully converting some of those life-long canned tasteless macro adjunct lager drinkers!"
"Lots of herbal grassiness to the hops, very well done. Balance of light, toasted amber malts and traces of sourdough. A fresh, hoppy bitterness lingers into the finish almost like a good IPA. Mouthfeel sits between medium and light, with a bubbly carbonation level that kicks up the spice mid-palate. Gets a little sticky with residuals towards the finish, but it's a minor nit-pick, as this is probably one of the best readily available lagers out there. Kudos to Brooklyn for crafting a sessionable, hoppy, and extremely tasty American Lager."
"Overall a very enjoyable lager. The featured brew from the Brooklyn lineup and it does not disappoint. Highly recommended."
"Poured from the can a dark copper color with a nice sticky off-white head. The nose mixed caramel toffee aromas with pine and floral hops. The flavor offered more of the same with more floral hops riding on a rail of sweet caramel maltiness. Highly drinkable and nicely balanced."
"Overall not a bad beer, but not one that I'd go on a quest to find."
"D: This goes down very easy, a nice session beer, great for the pool or beach. A good choice for your BMC drinking friends. I could easily reach for another one of these, now I just need a cheeseburger. Worth trying."
"D: This is a well crafted, highly drinkable lager, which makes for a great session beer. Perfect for a summer bbq or sitting inside watching a game. Great for seasoned BA's or beer newbs just getting into craft beers. Brooklyn lager has become a staple in my beer fridge."
"M&D- A smooth ride with just a bit of bitterness with the finish, Im not sure if it's the hops or the carb, which there is a lot of. The feel is a small step below medium bodied. The low abv make this a anytime beer, one which I would love to drink a six pack of at or watching the ballgame."
"Hops quickly over power the malt flavor I am looking for in a medium lager, and interferes with the crispness of the finish."
"Overall, a very good brew on its own or with food. Good structure and balance, but a bit untraditional for a lager. Some fruit and light sourness make this one you won't instinctively reach for when seeking a lager. It's ok."
"This is a decent lager but I think I mostly have it because it's local to me. I appreciate everything Brooklyn Brewery has done for craft beer and they have some great brands (especially recently with the Locals and Cuvees) but this is not my favorite lager. If you're in brooklyn or nyc and deciding among 6% beers (i.e. siera, sam adams) i think this would be the choice. Otherwise, a great pilsner would be my preference."
"An all-around drinkable and sessionable beer. Easy to drink and well balanced. Perhaps its all in my head, but seemingly a little less hoppy from the can than the bottle."
"I'm a fan."
"Drinkability?? I had 6."
"D: A very nice lager, that really goes well with a bit sturdier food. I will buy this one again and again."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has light body well carbonated. Very easy to drink. I could throw back several of these in an evening."
"Drinkability is pretty high. If you could buy this stuff for around the same price as -- say -- Sam Adam's, I might pick it up fairly often. As it stands, nearly $9 is asking too much. Price aside, I could knock these bastards back all night."
"D: Very flavorful and quite drinkable. Would certainly be a shocker for those whose only experience with the lager is the pale American variety."
"Not always on the brooklyn bandwagon this was a pleasant suprise. A hoppy ultra smooth lager that will please pale ale fans and lager fans."
"Shore Test: I already said that I am taking a sixer of Little Yella Pils. A sixer of this is going in the cooler, also. Ten Fidy may not make the trip at this rate."
"Flavor is lightly malty and then somewhat astringent on the back of the palate with hop oils and bitter sensations. Pretty hoppy for an amber or Vienna lager. Very nice, smooth and low-carbonated mouthfeel. Has an intermittent vegetal flavor that takes a few points away in the flavor category in my book, but it's far from offensive. I find that this beer shares a lot of similarities with a lighter, but hoppy pale ale. Drinkability is very good; could drink several of these flavorful lagers."
"The 16-oz. cans are gone and I'm back to Becks. Ooops! Did I admit that? Ultra-stressed, pasteurized Becks is a better drink? For better or worse, it is. Feel the softness, taste the subltle malt and German hop, see the clarity...."
"I'd also like to mention that I love this beer with pizza. I can't think of anything better to pair a pizza with."
"Reminds me a lot of certain Vienna lagers actually with the hop character and slight grain. It's not bad. Pretty refreshing. Has a bit in common with Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"Easily drinkable with loads of flavor. Very appealing to all types of beer drinkers."
"Balanced malt and hop aroma. Earthy, citrus, hop aromas with hint of caramel malt. Goldend amber, clear. Off white, rocky, head. Poor retention, but maintained a thin layer with good lacing. Roasted malt w/ earthy hops. Good balance of malt/bitterness. Clean aftertaste. Medium body with good carbonation. Good session beer. Comparable to Sam Adams Boston Lager, but a bit earthier. Overall well balanced; a good beer."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and lively with strong carbonation."
"D - This is a good session beer. The highlight of this beer is the exceedingly smooth mouthfeel."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. can. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a good balance of malts and hops. Taste is hops up front, malts kicking in later, slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a pretty good beer."
"D: Very fine brew, I can see how it's become so popular in the area. One of the fine examples of a mainstream craft brew, acceptable to a wide audience and proves a gateway to more complex brews. Another winner from Brooklyn, do yourself a favor and pick up one of the original jewels of craft!"
"Again, had this one after work the other night. Poured a deep auburn/amber color with thin white head that left decent lacing. Smelled of earthy hops and malts. Tasted the same with some caramel notes. Very smooth, keep em coming! My second favorite lager next to Porteris."
"I WILL buy this again! I'm very excited to try more from Brooklyn!"
"the excellent balance of the hops and malt in this along with the relatively low ABV will have me coming back for more of this"
" great brewery."
"last time i had this, i recall more hop flavor."
"Drinkability: Tasty and refreshing enough to have a few. The only thing that would hold a few people back is the sweetness and floral character. I do confess I am very partial to this brew and while its not perfect, it should be considered a modern classic. I've had this many times and I do recommend you serving at the proper temperature 40-45 degrees any warmer and you'll get a bad impression of this. The coolness of the serving temperature is fine by me, this is my favorite after cycling beer. :)"
"If not for his special releases then certainly for his core brands, Brooklyn Lager chief among them, Garrett Oliver deserves his face on the Mount Rushmore of brewers (if such a thing is ever made). There aren't many - are there any? - flagship lagers I find this interesting, let alone superb. If you have this beer readily available then maybe going through life drinking nothing but lagers wouldn't be such a bad way to live after all?!"
"D: So this is what beer was like before Prohibition, eh? Not bad. It certainly beats the pants off of any macro."
"D- Very drinkable or perhaps I am in the mood for beer."
"Drinkability: This is a very average lager. The color and the nose are the highlights of this beer in my opinion. I'm sure this beer could be sessionable, but the taste and mouthfeel make me wonder why anyone would want to do that in the first place."
"Drinkability: This is a bit on the bitter side and for me, I think it is an average amber"
"I'm no lager lover but this strikes me as a deviation from the norm in the best possible sense. I could drink this all day."
"d- super drinkable, very tasty, would (will) buy again, great for a session."
"Can't really comment on the head since this was the first pour out of the keg and it was mostly foam. It did settle into a nice, clear, amber color. The aroma was hard to place. Slightly yeasty, slightly sour apple, I don't know; I was having trouble with this one. I do like the taste, though. Nice full mouthfeel with some well balanced bitterness and a smooth finish. Carbonation was a little low, could be the keg though. Wasn't as crisp as a typically lager, but that could be due to the carbonation. Overall, a very nice American lager."
"Mouthfeel is good. Creamy and smooth and the carbonation is barely noticeable. The whole thing goes down fast though so hopefully you have some more on hand."
"Pours a solid amber...almost hazy dark with better than a full finger off eggshell foamy head that decomposes in 3D with a nice amount of Belgian lacing. The smell is sweet malty and citrus. The lighter carbonation lends to a lighter mouth feel and medium body. At 5.2 % ABV, this one is a real nice drinker. Haven't been a big fan of Brooklyn, but I'm going back for these."
"Not very complex at all but very solid all around. Easily sessionable and probably a good conversion beer for the macro drinkers."
"D - If you're not in the mood to drink something heavy and/or complex, this is a great choice. This would pair very well with standard American pub fare, chili, tacos, or Thai cuisine. In fact, I made chili last week that included a bottle of Brooklyn Lager. Don't expect this beer to blow you away, because it's not trying to."
"If this beer was available around where I live it would be without a doubt my go to session beer."
"This is very drinkable."
"This is a great, refreshing lager. Maybe it was because i had this at the end of a long day, but this beer is fantastic. Why drink any macro lager when you can have this!"
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated that is a little dry. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is a little dry and lingers for a few moments. This is a really good brew. It has a wonderful well rounded beer with a nice pleasant flavor. This is the 2nd beer from Brooklyn Brewery that I have tried, I like what I am tasting. Very well made would like a crisper finish."
"D - I keep hoping and wanting for this to be my go-to lager, but I continue to be disappointed. Ultimately, I just don't find it clean and crisp enough. Seems like more of an amber ale to me."
"Very enjoyable to drink this brew. One of the best tasting lagers I've had."
"poured amber with medium white head. you can really smell the barley -hint of caramel and hops. good feel in mouth, medium-light body a bit malty. the hops really come through in the taste, pretty satisfying lager. can go for one or too more, very satisfying brew."
"A very good beer."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a decent head that lingers. Smells of sweet malts and citrusy hops. Tastes of biscuity malts, balanced out by citrusy floral hops. Very crisp and extremely thirst quenching. Good carbonation....This is the perfect session brew with the exception that it tastes so damn good that I tend to drink them a bit too quickly, defeating the purpose of sessioning. Fantastic."
"D- This is a session beer. Feel absolutely guilt free going crazy."
"Pours a deep golden color. White head leaves a lot of lacing. Smells like American hops, a lot more so than I'd expect in others from this style. Tastes fairly malty and sweet, but with plenty of hops to clean it up. I know I've had this in the bottle before but I don't remember it being this big. Not too bad."
"Drinkability: this is a decent lager,goes good with peanuts .i do drink this beer often and enjoy it .cheers"
"D - Thank you Brooklyn Brewery for bringing these beers to NO, this is quickly becoming one of my go to session beers"
"This is one of my favourite lagers. A copper colour with a thick head as soon as it poured. The head does go down, with still some on top all the way through. Smell of mild floral hops. A much better taste than any macro lager, with the flavour of the hops. I could drink these all day."
"I was very surprised with this beer. Unlike other lagers, the Brooklyn had a nice hoppy aroma/taste and presented a nice amber color as opposed to a sickly pale yellow. Notes of floral hops in aroma with just enough bitter flavor. Not a lot of sweetness but a light body makes this a great session beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear amber with a tall, dense white head. Great lacing. Smells surprisingly of citric hops, with a good amount of sweet, floral malt backing it up. The taste leans to the bitter, hoppy, citric side as well, though it's well balanced by a grainy backbone. Body is a bit on the light side. Very nice lager."
"D-Very drinkable. I could session this like no bodies kidding yo. :) I highly suggest this one."
"M/D- Smooth viscosity that washes over the tongue leaving a bright flowery hop aftertaste. Very drinkable!"
"Presented in a shaker ""pint glass. Appears a hazed apricot color with about a finger of dense off white foam. Minimal lacing is left on the inside of my glass as it goes from full to empty. Smells and tastes of cereal grains, sweet caramel malt, and grassy, lemony citrus hops. Quite hoppy for a lager, I'm diggin' this. Medium and crisp in body with medium carbonation. So easily drinkable that I had a few cases of this as my ""do-all"" beer at our wedding. There wasn't any left over to bring home..."
"D: Pretty nice. I'd put this a notch or two below Great Lakes Eliot Ness, which is one of my favorites. It's not as good, but it's a very tasty, surprisingly hoppy amber."
"Its a very 1 dimensional beer with not a whole lot going on. That metallic aftertaste was not too harsh, but also not enjoyable."
"Notes: Overall I was fairly pleased with Brooklyn's Lager. Since I'm not a hop-head I think I prefer (as I mentioned above) Samuel Adams' Lager, but this is still a decent beer to drink. Lagers aren't my favorite style, nor will they ever be, but I was able to put this one back very quickly and easily, and I can see myself buying this beer again when I'm grilling out or ordering pizza."
"Brooklyn Lager has a clear amber body that is very appealing. Excellent head retention, soapy and off white, and quite sticky. Smells include some farm and yeast with a touch of lemon. Altogether a bit underwhelming. My rating of the smell may have been skewed by the fact I was at the Druid in Somerville sitting near the kitchen during the dinner rush. Hops! Delicious... Bunch of lemony citrus is well balanced a great maltiness. Body is just ok: a touch watery. Good carbonation, exactly what I'd expect for the style. It's altogether highly drinkable - very gentle on the palate. Sessionable."
"Drinkability: I'd choose this over any mass produced lager. Definitely session beer if you have the means. Enjoy whenever."
"Lots of carbonation, to the point that a sizable gulp when it's still from-the-fridge cold causes the same tingling sensation that a soda can. Becomes creamy. Light to medium bodied. Quite drinkable. I like it quite a bit. The comparisons others have made to American Pale Ales are apt, and I'd say it'd be a pretty good APA, as well."
"one of my go-to's"
"brooklyn can certainly pull some nice beers but this one isn't the best i've tried so far."
"This style is probably never going to be one of my favorites, but this is tasty, and definitely the best lager I've had."
"M/D - Very smooth, no bad aftertaste. Wish I had picked up more than one of these. The only disappointment is that I never picked one of these up earlier."
"D - The overpowering hops might set you on the path of something else midway through the night."
"D - Super drinkable."
"Overall: When I make it to New York one day there's not a chance I'll miss out on sampling this brew. This is a fine beer and a solid representation of a classic style."
"D: very drinkable. B+. However, I was a little disappointed, because I remembered loving this the first time I had it, but now I only like it."
"D- very easy to drink and would pefer more than one"
"D- Have and will continue to pound Brooklyn Lagers one right after another."
"Drinkability: great session beer...drank it all the the big east tournament"
"Nothing against this beer. It may technically be a lager, but it acts, smells, and tastes like an ale. Not my favorite."
"Overall - I haven't met a Brooklyn Brewery beer I didn't like, and this is no exception. While not terribly complex, it's a well balanced and tasty brew that will likely become part of my regular refrigerator standbys."
"All in all, this one is a good option for a regular and would serve as a session beer very nicely."
"Drinkability- Full bodied enough to satisfy without slowing you down. A good all weather beer and a fine choice for a session."
"This has been a favorite of mine for a while, I'm surprised I never reviewed it before today. One of the most drinkable beers there is in my opinion."
"D: A damn good lager. I would definitely drink this again and again. Very sessionable. The hop presence was definitely a good surprise. Highly recommended for all. This beer has the ability to be a great crossover beer for the non-beer geek."
"This is my second time sampling the Brooklyn Lager. First time was on tap. For the review, purchased a single bottle and poured into a pint glass. Nice copper tone to the beer with no significant head to speak of. Fruity tones were present. The taste started out somewhat sweet and then the bitterness came in later. Some nice lacing in the glass. The mouthfeel was a bit on the dry side. Overall, I really enjoy this lager."
"D- This beer is very drinkable, goes down easy. It would go great with almost any kind of food. It would also be great summer night on the porch beer. I will buy again. So far my favorite from the Brooklyn sampler."
"D - A different take on a lager. More spicy and dry. Interesting & drinkable."
"Poured into my new Sam Adams boston lager glass. The color is somewhat light tranparent copper. Poured a nice thick head that faded into decent lacing. Carbination is decent. Smell is nicly hoppy not too strong. Taste has a nice bit of hop taste at the front with a decent malty base. Leaves just a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty fairly light with decent carbination. Overall a decent lighter beer to enjoy and relax with in the afternoon."
"Poured a dark amber color with a white one finger head and moderate lacing. A nutty malt to the smell, little sweetness. Some nice carbonation makes it tasty, sweet malts round off with what little hops are thrown in. Gulp factor is high, a session lager is there was any. An overall great craft lager that gives the style some justice. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Excellent. this is a great session beer, and a fairly unique blend of flavors for a lager, in my opinion."
"I first had this Brooklyn offering after a tour of the Brooklyn Brewery a couple of years ago. At the time I thought I could have sat there all day and knocked one back after another, which I did. I hadn't had it since, so after a lenghty trip to the liquor store I thought I would give it another shot. What a good choice. I forgot how much I loved this beer. To me, it tastes like Sam Adams lager with more of a hoppy bite. However, the Brooklyn Lager is much easier to drink than Sam. Glad I picked it up."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. Would drink again."
"Definitely one of my all time favorites."
"Absolutely great session lager. Must try side by side with Sam Adams."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very crisp. The beer seems to coat your mouth with sticky sweetness. Incredibly easy drinking. Add a touch more hops to it and the drinkability would be an easy 5.0"
"D: Back in college I would get in moods for a session with Newport Storm amber ale but sometimes grew disappointed by its almost syrupy malt sweetness after one or two. This could have been a lighter, but still earnest, replacement. Better late than never."
"Drinkability -- If I had a six-pack of this, it wouldn't be hard to finish them all on a hot day. I imagine this beer would go well with a lot of different foods, including those with multiple flavors/components at once (a supreme pizza or a burger with everything on it, for example). In spite of its minor shortcomings, this is a highly drinkable beer that I'd definitely try again."
"Drinkability-- This is definitely a beer thats worth a look once in while, its good and enjoyable not one i necasarily stock constantly but still a pretty good beer to have around every once in while especially when it can be found frequently at pretty low price for its relative quality"
"Body is medium for a lager, very nice, vey very drinkable (7 thumbs up). I've only had a couple american lagers that tasted like a good hearty beer. Leaps and bounds ahead of BMC."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is what I picture as ""Real American Lager"" in termanology of how much this brew satisfies. The excellent dose of hops and malt are paired perfectly to give a beginner in the brew circuit a good picture of what a good lager is supposed to be. I tried alot of Brookyln's offerings and suprsiingly I tried this last, but this is a great introductory beer in the world of craft beer."
"Very session able beer. Light, simple, would drink again but not in a hurry to have another one soon"
"Pours a tawny orange with a huge head with a styrofoam like consistency. Head sticks around several minutes after teh pour with good lacing. Aroma is of metal and light citrus, oranges, paper and light Munich malt, reminds me of an Oktoberfest. Taste is very strong in the amber flavor with a creamy aftertaste. Very slight amounts of diacetyl go with the amber malt. Surprisingly medium to full bodied served a little under room temperature. A friend of mine bought a keg of this a while back and it's a really great, easy drinking lager when you want a little more flavor."
"Versatile beer, and nice for as ubiquitous as it is in the NYC area."
"Very nicely made lager from Brooklyn. I've been getting into all malt lagers recently and this is a nicely balanced one. Pours very nicely, with a nice dark amber color, a good head, and excellent lacing. Smells somewhat malty with a bubblegum undertone and an earthy finish. The taste is nicely balanced as well with some more light maltiness, slight graininess, and dry, nutty earthiness. Pretty mellow, but satisfying. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"pours a red amber color, normal white foamy head lasts for a while. Smells mostly of breadiness, a slight bitterness. Taste is very malty, hops are slightly present. Reminds me of a samuel adams boston lager, but with less carbonation in the mouthfeel (which is smooth but slightly watery). Highly drinkable and good as a thirst quencher"
"I don't really care for how robust the malt flavoring is on this lager. It is too heavy and doesn't have a distinct enough taste for me to love it. Brooklyn Brewery makes a lot of great beers, but this one is one of the more disappointing ones, in my opinion."
"Pours a clear amber with a tan head that clings with stickiness. Aromas of a mossy bitterness. Tasts a sweet malts and an asparagus-like bitterness - very pleasant. Feel is just fine. One of my favorite beers by Brooklyn. A highly recommended thirst-quencher that stands up to nearly any meal you could want."
"Overall: this is like a better version of Sam Adams Boston Lager. A superbly drinkable brew with hops all over the smell, taste, and finish. The head retention, lacing, and mouthfeel are excellent. I wish more beers were made like this in Canada. Until that happens, the LCBO should keep Brooklyn Lager in their lineup!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with a Best by date of Apr. 2009. I like the amber-red pour and quarter inch beige head and there's some decent lacing. Good clarity. The aroma is of sweet malts. The hops are evident in the flavor and it is a fairly mild taste. Good finish. Really it was a pretty decent brew but I like the Brooklyn brews anyway."
"Poured an golden copper color from a 12oz bottle. A one finger white head appeared and then quickly vanished. Aroma is that of honey, malt, and spice and taste is clean, sweet, and grainy - great hint that is in fact a lager. Goes down smooth and finishes dry; very easy to drink. This is one of my favorite lagers because it has more taste than traditional macro/import lagers. A great entry-level craft beer that can be enjoyed again and again even by a discriminating palate. Haven't had this one since last summer in NYC so it was great to finally try it again."
"D: Goes down easy, a great lager that I could drink a fair amount of. Tasty beer really, and well crafted!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a dark orangish red with a fluffy 2 finger head that left an unanticipated amount of lacing. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy. This is definitely the most hoppy lager I have ever had. The aroma is floral and citrus hops. There is definitely a good bit of lemon in the nose along with a good floral bouquet. The flavor is just a superb combination of a nice hoppy bite with a good caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a velvety creaminess to it. I wish this beer would be local to me. I definitely would make it a staple in my beer rotation."
"(D) This is a great lager with excellent flavor. I could a few of these consecutively."
"I bought this beer because I wanted to try something clean and crisp and simple. I was on an IPA binge and I needed a change. Poured into a pint glass and looked like an amber ale. Fluffy head that left a lace around the glass. Malty scent with a light hop bitter taste and medium carbonation. Just what I was looking for. A nice clean lager that is very drinkable. Would be a good session beer."
"M/D: Smooth. A very easy to drink lager that provides different tastes than other lagers."
"D - As an amber lager, you'd certainly expect drinkability and Brooklyn doesn't disappoint. The soft malt character, dry finish, and pleasing herbal hoppy spiciness combine to make for a very drinkable version of the style. I'll take a second, maybe a third."
"Drinkability: This would make a nice session beer. Nicely done."
"D: A really good beer that you can enjoy in a session."
"this beer pours a light clear golden color with a tall creamy off white head that fades slowly leaving lace sticking to the glass. the aroma brings a strong scent of floral and pine hops with a bit of malt in the background. the taste follows with a good bit of hops and sme of the sweeter malt characteristics. the mouthfeel is decent if a little low in the co2 department. a very drinkable lager."
"3.5/5"
"Nothing fancy, just a good, drinkable beer. Definitely on the hoppy side, but without ignoring the malt. I would say this is probably my second favorite lager behind Sam Adams."
"a worthy beer but i might not buy it again."
"I could have easily have a few of these, but I am not sure this is a brew I would actually buy again. Maybe it's just the style, but to me, it tastes like a slight astringent version of a vienna style lager. Nevertheless, this a well crafted beer, and I think some of the harshness I am tasting could possibly be attributed to improper storage of the beer. Overall, a good brew, and one that won't overwhelm most peoples' palate."
"D - Easy drinking making it enjoyable to have a few in one sitting."
"A very nice lager. Something I should have tried a lot sooner and something I will definitely have more of in the future."
"Brooklyn Lager from Brooklyn Brewery pours a lovely deep copper color with a nice thick head. The smell is of malt and faint hops. The taste is exactly the same but with some earthy tones mixed in as well. Was enjoyable and left lacing down my glass. When I'm in the mood far a lager(which don't happen much), this will be my go to beer. Sessionable and very drinkable."
"Great, complex taste packed into a lager - rare and wonderful."
"Drinkability: Pretty good beer. A good balance of malts and hops, which is sometimes rare in a lager. Something ale drinkers should try, even if they're not fond of lagers."
"In summary: a good, solid, drinkable and enjoyable beer, though nothing to write home about."
"(rated Jan 30, 2007)"
"Pours a light amber color, has a hoppy floral aroma with a malty undertone. It has the mouthfeel of a more full bodied lager. The taste is a good balance between the Cascade Hops and the American Malts. Overall I liked it very much, I would label it as the ale drinkers lager."
"Had this during Armin Van Buuren's set in McCarren park. Amber pour, not much head. Hoppy aroma, hoppy taste, smooth, a bit toasty. Lots of hops, they work well with the beer. Strong malt also. Quality brew, it will surprise you."
"Pours an amber brownish body with a small creamy white head. Has a sweet aroma, fruit. Some hops in the nose. Grapefruity taste, sweet strawberry aftertaste. Malty. Watery palate. Has a soft mouthfeel. Hoppy taste. But too malty for my taste."
"Extremely drinkable beer, a favorite of mine to get in a sixtel."
"The taste is caramelly-toasty grain, leaf, grapefruit, slightly oily but with a crisp, lightly bitter finish that is dryish,, leafy and grapefruity. A light juiciness immediately precedes the finish."
"M &D- not your average lager, but an excellent diveation from traditon, a smooth mouth feel and great drinkability could drink this all year round but imagine it to be fantastic during the summer."
"The beer appears as an amber with it's slightly reddish color and minimal head. The first thing that jumps out about this beer when going in for drink is the incredible level of hoppiness that can be detected in the smell. However, the taste is quite good with a moment of bitterness followed by a nice clean and abrupt finish. This lager has a decent body that gives it a nice sense of drinkability."
"Cheers!!"
"An explosion of bubbles flows upward through the dark orange brew into a two-finger, bubbly tan head. As the bubbles pop, the head slowly recedes, leaving a healthy amount of lacing behind. A nice brisk maltiness floats to the nose, along with some fruitiness (perhaps pineapple or apple). Some earthiness, some sourness, and some grain are mixed in. Tastes of crystal malts, with a quick bitter finish which wraps up some sour apples, spice, and grass. This is a complex lager on both the aroma and taste fronts. Mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied, and leans toward the dry side. This is a very tasty and somewhat unique lager which might be losing some minor points due to style, which would be terribly unfortunate."
"This is a very well put together beer. Plenty of flavor, yet not at all heavy, and the malt and hops are nicely balanced. It's a shame that Brooklyn beers aren't available in California, because this is a superb session beer that makes me want to try more of this brewery's offerings. One of the most satisfying lagers I've had in years."
"Solid feel to it. Very easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I may even go grab a sixer for tomorrow night's poker game. But then again, maybe not. I don't want everyone else drinking my beer!"
"Really drinkable, I could see myself drinking a ton of this stuff. Another nice beer from Brooklyn."
"A very solid lager and one that is exceptionally easy to drink."
"Overall: Very enjoyable, and a one of the best American Lagers I have had. Good Drinking!"
"O) Solid beer, lots of flavor, mostly hop driven, strikes me as a Sam Adams Lager, a mainstream macro, but a well done one."
"I could take about 3 of these. The bite might get overwhelming after too many. My good drunken memories didn't serve me wrong though."
"D - First Brooklyn brew...looking forward to more...this one is a winner"
"D - Easy to session and kind of enjoyable but nothing I would drink on a regular basis"
"Drinkability: I'm glad I found this beer. If it weren't so expensive in Japan I could see making it a session stand-by. Overall I'm very impressed"
"Mmmm, a flavorful lager. Piney hops seem most prevalent to me with a toasty flavored malt backbone. A few hints of clover and caramel. Refreshing! This beer shows the macros that lagers can still be thirst quenching and maintain a high level of flavor. One of the best (American style?) lagers I have had. Very tasty."
"Pretty good. I'd like to see it on tap; and I'm eager to try more Brooklyn's offerings."
"Drinkability: Not too heavy, ABV is on the lower side, tastes good, good mouthfeel. A good beer to have a few of."
"This holds some characters similar to Sam Adams and I'm not quite sure why they aren't in the same category. I like them both, but I like the flavors of the hops more in this one, but the length of the dryness and bitterness of this one I prefer less."
"Pours a rich copper with about two fingers of head. Smell is mostly of hops. Taste is very bready with nice hoppy finish. Don't let the style name fool you! There ARE hops in here and you WILL enjoy them! Drinkability is excellent! The label calls this ""Pre-Prohibition Style."" Too bad the macro-lager replaced this!"
"Notes: Fantastic beer to pair with food, especially for bbqing and spicy foods this beer stands up well."
"My favorite lager in the world. Since its not as available as Sam Adams it's a great alternative. Similar to each other."
"this is a great regular beer. It has a nice copper color. A nice hop presence on the nose without being too hoppy. The taste is a nice hop bite with a good malty backbone. Its not too bitter. This has a good medium mouthfeel and it goes down one after the other. This is a great beer for beginners."
"D - Drinkable, but not memorable... Not one to avoid, but also not one to seek out... A very average American Lager..."
"My bottle says it's about a year past the best-by date, but what the hell. The color is a deep cloudy amber with a quarter inch of head. Almost no lacing at all, but the head does stay there. Smells of pungent malt. Tastes of curiously bitter malt, a bit of citrus, with a intriguing bitter aspirin aftertaste. Pretty damn good. I wish I could have tasted it a year ago. Drinkable as hell, and it seems like a promising gateway beer from BMC."
"D= very drinkable if the description suits your tastes."
"EDIT: Had this fresh in Astoria and it made all the difference. Much better hop character and a very well done hoppy lager. Brooklyn really does not put out any sub-par beers. Beware of old kegs - this is much better fresh."
"D - A terrific session beer. With better distribution, this one could give Sam Adams a good run for its money. It's very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a light brown with some reddish highlights and lot of visible carbonation rising in it. Big, fluffy light-tan head retained very well and the lacing was nice too. Great looking beer. Aromas of lager malt and restrained but pleasant floral hops. The flavors were pretty classic, a perfect balance of caramel malt with some nutty elements and floral hops. Slightly bitter and quite dry. Something about the finish was a little off, hints of minerals and earthiness that didn't quite sit right with me. The body was medium, the carbonation medium and the mouthfeel semi-smooth. I'm not really a Lager fan but this was a good version of one. Still, the flavors were nothing unique and the finish did throw me off."
"The aroma was floral hops and sweet malt. Little bit of damp grass clippings as well. The taste was OK. Good hop bite but didn't like the bitter finish on it. Also just didn't have that much overall flavor to it. Still being than BMC but not enough there for me after so many flavorful beers over the years. With that said, this would be a good starter beer to get your friends to try something other than BMC."
"You won't want to stop drinking this beer. It won't dissatisfy you."
"This is what American beer is all about right here. Simple, tasty, refreshing and nothing else... I could have this all day, every day. It's very balanced and a low enough ABV it acts as a great session beer.. if you haven't tried this yet run out and grab some."
"M&D: light-bodied, refreshing on the texture, never too fizzy, while the hoppiness comes almost before any other elements in the flavour. Not much in this beer wakes me to the fact that this is a lager, and for such a decent flavour profile I just couldn't care any less about what experts like to categorise this... Really enjoyable like a session Bitter!"
"this with sweet foods of any kind, but for a hearty dinner this would definately be a decent beer to take in."
"Nicely done!"
"D - Very drinkable especially in warm months but at the same time flavorful"
"D: Very drinkable, Brooklyn just came into Dallas and I'm very pleased as this beer definitely met my high expectations. Definitely sessionable and will be a stand-by if it is readily available."
"The feel is a fizzy, bubbly mouthfeel. Lager-dry, but good. This is one terrific, hoppy lager with good body and lots of character. Grassy and malty both."
"Pours a nice, thick white head. Substantial lacing. Color is a sort of hazy dark amber. Smell is strong of hops, flowery. The taste is also hoppy at the end but it begins rather malty. The hops give it an almost citrusy medicinal taste. Not too far from an IPA. Mouthfeel is clean. Overall, a very refreshing beer. Easy to drink several in one session."
"This could be one of the quintessential session beers. Heavy for style but who cares? Great to drink."
"Overall, a very good lager that would pair nicely with food but good enough to enjoy on its own. I will probably make this my ''go-to-lager'' from now on if it's available."
"Pours a clear amber with a creme head. A mild, sweet malty nose. Flavor carries some of the same character but with greater intensity. The tangy sweetness is quite high actually. Still nice though. Feel has a bit of a bite on the carbonation to it and the liquid is smooth but a bit thicker. A bit of a bite on the flavor profile slightly detracts, but there's a reason why this is a Brooklyn standard."
"i was disappointed, having expected something a lot less cascade dominated. it's a competent beer, and i suppose a lager impersonating a pale ale is something of a novelty in today's market, but i'm having trouble seeing the point when there are already plenty of beers that taste like this but are more interesting."
"I always appriciate a good lager beer, and this one is outstanding! In the same class as Jämtlands Bärnsten from Jämtlands Brewery."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden orange color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy off-white head, with some small islands and creamy sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly bitter. The taste is malty, sweet, very slight bitterness from hops. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty Lager one of the best I've had to date."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"D - Enjoyable and easy to drink, the hops really stand out in this beer and give it a bit more complexity than most American lagers. Pre-prohibition style lagers are a rarity, but this is a very nice example of the style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Leaves the palate with a grainy taste and dry feel after having been swallowed. Carbonation is low key and this one has a medium body. This is definitely one that I'll be picking up again....next time I'm in the mood for a nice balanced and full flavored lager, well here we go. This is one I could really drink all night. Be sure to pour it into the glass as much more can be appreciated that way. It really changes the whole character of the beer."
"I enjoyed this beer. It poured a fairly small head, but the color was a rich amber. At first the high hops presence gave me the impression that they had been mislabeling the beer as a lager when it should have been an IPA. After a few sips, however, I found the lager within. The beer is worthy of six pack and can be enjoyed on a warm summer night"
"A selection form the BOMC. Pours to a golden colour, more golden than typically expected for a lager. Smell however is classic lager malt, but with more fruity hop smell. Taste is not just sweet but a more complex carmelly and slighly bitter taste. Well bodied brew and well carbonated. Well balanced and smooth. More than I expected for a lager."
"has a good hop bite and good malt flavor but this isnt great, this is a beer that is slghtly above avrage, i could drink this every now and agan. i am not a huge fan of lager but the hops in this one act more like a pale ale. this is a beer that is good for a hot summer day"
"Drinkability: Too strong for a true session beer, but I feel like I could have two of these in a night and not feel like I was missing any other beers for the most part. Good taste, and refreshing hops allways make for a very drinable beer, and this beer fullfills such."
"Wow! This shocked me with how much more fresh and hop forward this seemed than the bottled version. Probably a tribute to the canned packaging. Fresh, crisp, tasty, and quaffable as heck, I think that I might have to designate this as my new go-to."
"D - Crisp and light - a decent session beer. I'd like it to be a bit more flavorful."
"Recommended..."
"This would be a great tailgater, and perfect for all places that don't allow glass bottles."
"This is the real Great American Lager, don't let the mass advertising fool you. A carbonated, mildly cloudy amber brew sits in my glass with a pretty decent head. For a name that is shamed by weak, American lagers this one tries to separate itself from the pack and I congratulate it. Slight smell but deep mahogany, smooth taste makes this a brew everyone should try. An American lager with taste! NO WAY! Pick up some Brooklyn Lager and enjoy."
"Overall; a very solid drinkable beer."
"I am always surprised by how much I like this beer. For some reason, I always expect less. Perhaps it's because it is simply a lager, not a pilsner or marzen. I think this has elements of both: It's dark for a pilsner, but hoppy for a marzen. Either way, it's delicious."
"Pours a clear amber color, foamy tan head settles slowly, leaves huge, thick rings of lacing on the glass. The great balance of this beer hits the nose hard...piney floral hops meet sweet, toasty caramel malt. Slight lemon taste, tons of biscuity malt, and a great grassy/pine hop presence. Nicely carbonated, super-refreshing, and as drinkable as a beer can get. Great stuff."
"Tasted on 7/4/08 (God Bless America and God Bless our Troops)."
"Great gateway beer and also a great Friday-after-work beer. If we could get cans here, it would be the perfect beach beer."
"Drinkability - As an ale lover I find it surprising I enjoyed this lager as much as I did. This is a very drinkable beer that would easily pair itself with a wide variety of food."
"D: Nice crisp refreshing lager. I'd still choose Session over this, but this is a good beer nonetheless."
"Very enjoyable lager; its complexity was a nice surprise. This one definitely lives up to the hype."
"D : It's an easy to drink lager that I wouldn't mind having again but wouldn't go out of my way to find."
"D: Very drinkable beer as all the flavors mesh very well and none of them are overwhelming. It is also a nice light session beer."
"This may not be the ""Great American Lager"" but it's a lot closer to it than the beer that claims to be. I'm going to have to put this into the rotation for sure."
"That being said, I find the Brooklyn to be more drinkable and would probably be more appealing to the average beer drinker. There is nothing overly offensive about this beer. Its color, aroma and taste are all fairly unobjectionable. With a medium hop presence and mouthfeel, its a good step up from BMC stuff and I would definitely use this beer when trying to convert a BMC drinker, or if I were going to session, on a day like today."
"D-I would have to agree that this beer is a good session beer, I plan to use it tomorrow on the 4th."
"D - Easy to drink beer. Bought a sixer, this is my fourth one. I would buy another sixer of this."
"D - A great session beer for almost anyone. Though I think I prefered this a little better out of the bottle, I'd never pass this brew down. An excellent beer for the style."
"D. I see why they call this a good session beer. Easy to drink and full of flavor that finishes clean."
"I do recommend this craft lager to any and all lager fans."
"this one goes down a lot better than the pils i had a few miuntes ago. easy drinking. a good session beer"
"D - This is a perfect session lager. I am not a big lager fan but this one could defintely find a permanent place in my fridge. Very well balanced and a very pleasing lager."
"Eminently quaffable."
"Way too sour and somewhat sweet to have more than one, this should almost be a lemon beer, very strange."
"Notes: Decent brew and worth a purchase for the summer."
"This has a huge hop profile for a traditional Vienna (which of course this is not trying to be), and it is quite a nice addition, the fact that this is dry hopped comes through quite nicely with the vibrancy of the herbal / spicy hop character. This is a really nice beer, a perfect accompaniment to the 106°F / 41°C heat we have here today."
"D = A very highly drinkable beer, great on a hot Summer day."
"I nice brew. Not great but nice."
"Full bodied, great mouthfeel. Still remains light enough to be great followup to my 7 mile hike up a mountain this morning. Exceptionally drinkable. I'll have to look for this on tap somewhere and make a night out of it."
"D: A really solid and unique lager with a strong hops component that blurs the lines of lager and ale in a very pleasant way. I think I like the on-tap version a little better though."
"Had a pint of this while at a comedy club in NYC this past weekend. Didn't look like like an average lager, it was a bit more darker orange than I would have expected. Taste was interesting. For an all malt beer, it had a bit of that hoppiness to it that makes it stand out. Very smooth going down, but it has a nice body to it and some very good flavor characteristics. A lager with great depth to it is not easy to make, and Brooklyn has hit the spot."
"M/D: Overall, this is a very good beer. The beer was smooth and finished well. The carbonation level was right. Highly drinkable and one that I will be enjoying often."
"Tasty brew that I'm sure I will revisit."
"Drinkability: A fine, tasty lager from Brooklyn. If only every trip to Lagertown could be as satisfying."
"D: Medium-body and intriguing flavor make this a most enjoyable beer. Not an ideal session beer, but I'll be picking some up again."
"It's too big for the style, but alright in its' own regards."
"I tried this beer on February 26, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario. The beer poured a dark translucent amber colour with a white head which disappates to permanent lacing. The aroma was slightly malty, but had an unmistakable floral hoppiness that was a prelude of good things to come. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour had some hints of malt, but was very hoppy, with some grapefruit like bitterness in the finish. A very good beer."
"D: Will have to revisit this. Don't know if I got a bad batch with crazy carbonation or what, but did not leave a great impression. I will give it the benefit of the doubt."
"D: drinkability was very smooth providing a enjoyable experience."
"Had on-tap at The Brick in Milledgeville, Georgia. Came out in an appropriate Brooklyn goblet. Was a very deep brown, with not much of a head. Smell and taste were much sweeter than I had anticipated. Alot of malt and caramel backbone. Not a whole lot of hop backbone. Certainly not bad, just not what I was expecting. A pretty drinkable beer considering the ABV. Overall, a solid offering from Brooklyn."
"Balance is OK but tilted toward the malt side. A bit caramel dominant. Drinkable for sure but there's something missing in the middle I can't pin down. Keeps it in the B range. Lack of complexity perhaps."
"M&D: The mouthfeel is rather a bit toward medium at first but sort of finishes with a bit watery. This isn't a bad thing, in fact it works well with this brew. The carbonation is very light, matching everything well. I nice lager, very enjoyable, and one I would drink again anytime."
"Great to have a proper lager, given the slop that passes as standard in the UK. Up there with the best and a million miles from the majority of ""lager"" that is consumed worldwide."
"D: Easy to drink as any lager, while remaining complex and rich."
"This beer poured an orange brown color with a thick tan head. The aroma is mild and malty - very inviting. The taste is malty with a touch of sourness (faint). The mouthfeel is full and seems well-suited. Overall, I'm impressed - not the American Lager experience I had expected."
"D - Very drinkable, sessionable beer."
"D - Very nice overall. I would consider this a good ""regular"" beer, nothing special, but good overall."
"d - Not quite as clean of a finish as I like in a lager. It is a lot like the boston lager, but with more hops. This beer might have it's place with the right food pairing, but the extra hops in the finish kind of puts me off from this one if I'm looking for a good refreshing clean lager."
"This is an outstanding lager, one that I intend to enjoy often. It rivals Sam Adams as one of my favorite ""go to"" brews."
"D- seriously impressed, brooklyn! their best offering that i've had by a long shot."
"UPDATE: This has become my favorite beer."
"It's a good beer, and an odd one at that. It's easy to drink but not as easy as a Sam Adams, and certainly not as easy as an American Macro Lager such as Yueungling Lager. I think the hops are a bit much for the style. Still, I recommend it."
"Btw, great head retention and some lacing as well."
"All 4's across the board on this one. A decent hoppy lager that would hold its own even as a pale ale as well, it puts many of that style to shame all the way from the other side of the bottom fermenting fence. Almost worth the exorbitant price for a 6 pack here in Alberta when all is said and done."
"Prosit, MK"
"Good solid satisfying beer that I look forward to having again."
"Pours a clear, light amber, caramel color with a solid quarter inch of fluffy head and great tracing. I get very strong hop aromas, plenty of citrus, spice, a bit floral. There's also some toasty, and a little biscuity malts too. On the palate, the hops really pull through providing some initial bitterness, moving to a medium filling malt feel finishing very bread like. Mouthfeel is very crisp with medium high carbonation, but the finish is more lingering than most lagers. Overall, an excellent lager with plenty of hop appeal and a solid malt profile."
" D- I could've had a few more of these, went down very smooth, and was great with a Val's pizza."
"Amber colored beer with a thick foamy head that quickly fades to a lacing.Smell and taste are bread,florals and malt.This beer really don't do much for me it's kind of average and bland.I would drink it again only if it was free though.I will label this as a disappointment."
"Smooth beer. Not enough going on in this to want to drink a lot of it."
"For an all-malt lager, this is pretty hoppy. The beer pours a nice amber color with a nice off white soap like bubbly head. Retention is good and this beer really laces, especially for a lager. The beer is only modestly carbonated, slightly heavier than a typical lager, but I wouldn't yet call it medium bodied. The smell is malt, hop, and citrus ... quite good. The taste is a little surprising in that the hops really make their presence known throughout. The beer has a splash of dryness, quite a bit of a citrusy acidity, some bready malts, and a nice hop backbone. There is an apple citrus to this beer as well. The beer does lack some of the yeasty snap of a lager. The beer seems to have had its lagery tail clipped a bit, but this is a nice beer well worth seeking out because it transcends the limitations of the style. L'Chaim."
"Pours a golden amber color, with a very thick white head that lingered nicely. Aroma is clean and malty. Flavor is very easy-drinking; a nice balance of malt and hops, with much more of a hops presence than I would have expected. This would make an incredible session beer; it's what I wish most commercial lagers were like today."
"Poured from the bottle into a tapered glass. Good head retention and a bronze/copper color. Not too much hops, but hoppy for a traditional lager. You can tell that this a quality lager from the aftertaste. Very smooth and semi sweet. The texture reminds me of Sam Adams."
"D - Solid lager that's easy to drink. I like the addition of the extra hops in this one. The finish isn't quite as crisp and clean as I typically like in a lager, but it has a pretty satisfying hop profile that makes this lager stand out."
"Well done, Brooklyn Brewery."
"poured a clear amber gold color with a beige three finger head with a easy pour with large patches of lace. floral and herb aromas are strong. taste is bready with lots of malt and bitter hops from start to finish also very dry. mouthfeel light with lots of crisp carbonation. unique dry taste but not unpleasant, taste more like a ale then a lager."
"Appearance lite brown in color large white head. Smell a little hops a little malt nothig special. Taste was like a sam adams without as much caramel flavor, very crisp and cleen. Mouthfeel was good well carbonated. Drinkability was good I could have a few."
"Medium body with med-high carbonation. Somewhat creamy. Satisfying and refreshing. A very nicely balanced beer."
"Had this on tap while in NJ for work. Overall a nice brew and best option on draft at the bar. It lost a touch on taste and mouthfeel IMO as it seemed to be missing that clean lager note I enjoy in a lager beer. nice hop note, biscuit malts and all but it comes back to the lager aspect for me. Worth a try."
"Very malty on the palate. Strong bitterness with a highly malty and spicy finish. Grapefruit in the finish. I'd like to compare this one with the Ambroise Pale... this is almost ale-y in its maltiness and lack of clean finish. I don't mind this but I see how as this is a lager there are some detractors."
"I definatly consider this one great lager. Full of auroma and flavor, but not too overpowering."
"Really seems to be more of an ale/pale ale taste to it, but good nonetheless. A decent standby session beer."
"On tap at Beerbistro. I dont really like lagers, but maybe Ive just drank the wrong kind. Nice hoppy aroma, and a taste of hops, fresh fruit and malt. Very pleasant. Ive since bought a couple of bottles at the LCBO and it worked well paired with a Thai red curry."
"Overall one of my favorite lagers. Being a hop head I just love the hops that comes through the beer in the nose and flavor. Well done Brooklyn. I grab this whenever I get a chance, it's a great drinking lager that is different from the rest. Great beer."
"D: One of the more drinkable lagers that actually has come bite. I am from NY so I will pimp these guys. Good beer. Read the book."
"Just a well--rounded lager."
"Brooklyn Lager pours an orange color with a thick white head that laces nicely from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a decent amount of hop in the nose considering it's a lager. There is also a decent amount of hops in the flavor as well and a nicely balanced malt backbone as well. An enjoyable lager."
"Edit: I think I overrated this beer the first time I reviewed it nearly a year ago. Still has a lot of the qualities I extolled originally, but the aroma seems a little more down to earth, maybe a bit more diceytal than I would like to see. Still a great balance struck between the malts and hops, great taste, one of the better lagers out there to be sure."
"Pours dark amber color with thick white head and lots of lacing. Nice citrus aroma with sweet malt in the background. Taste is clean with a nice citrus hop bite at the start, a well-balanced malt backbone, and then lingering hop bitterness. A very well done beer thats easy to drink, very refreshing. A lager with a bit of an APA personality."
"Drinkability: Good but, depending on your taste, either the hops or the staleness near the end of the glass, might get to you."
"Drinkability - gorgeous aroma and nice taste marred by over carbonation/acidity. Good but not great."
"D: Easily drinkable and not a back representation of the style."
"Final thoughts  Leaves your mouth wet and wanting more. Excellent lager that is more like a light IPA. I could drink a lot of these : )"
"This is a lager I would have over most any other. Really a surprising hoppiness and bitterness to it, but I like it. I'm not a huge lager fan, but this is a very good one."
"I could drink a whole lot of this beer if I could find it in the midwest (highly unlikely with all of the AB supporters here)."
"All in all an excellent and almost perfect example of a fresh amber lager. I wish I could try this on tap !!!"
"Drinkability  This is a tasty, balanced lager."
"Overall this is a very good and flavorful brew. Tonight I drank it on its own but it paired very well with some pepper-lime chicken I made the other day. I am a hop-head but I think this beer has just a tad too much bitterness for the style. Back off the hops just a little bit and I think it'd be a near perfect lager. Still, very good."
"Pours a deep amber with a nice head and good lacing. Lots of flowery hop aroma which I find odd for a lager. Smell is more like a pale ale. Taste was hoppy, with lots of bitter, flowery hop taste. Tasted like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which is great if you want a pale ale but bad if you want a lager. Thought this strayed too much from the style. Medium-bodied and easy to drink."
"drinkability - Not your normal lager beer, real nice beer to enjoy. I'm starting to like Brooklyn Beer"
"Easy drinking and would be a superb everyday lager to enjoy regularly."
"Very nice golden amber color with a tinge of orange,nice foamy off white head that leaves spotty lacing,The nose brings a fresh floral,lite grass and malts with trace of caramel.Taste is refreshing,crisp,with the floral coming thru,caramel hitting in at the middle than some bitterness finishing off dry and leaving a tinge of the floral behind.Medium carbs,going down very easily and would be a very good summer drink.Quite enjoyable,but not really something i would like for a session beer,but 2 or 3 and move on and it's allright with me."
"Overall: A nice all-malt lager, definitely worth a try."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a one finger white head that dies down to a nice lasting layer. Stickiness is very nice, good lacing on the sides. Smell is of noble hops and a floral bouquet. Some caramel malt in the nose as well. Taste is a clean oily citrus hop flavor with a nice sweet honey taste. Very good balance on the tongue with a good malt undertone in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Wow, I wasn't expecting this beer to be this good. Pretty hoppy for a lager, but just enough malt to balance this one out well. This might have to be my new golfing beer seeing this beer is available in cans as well."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer. It is always good to find a lager that keeps it simple, yet still comes off with some complexity."
"Drinkability -Very solid lager. As far as lagers go it was one of the better ones I've had."
"12oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Pours a beautiful golden amber color with a nice creamy off-white head that displays excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is malt and fresh hops with hints of bread. The taste is a nice balance between the malt and citrusy hops. The mouthfeel has a little more body than the average lager but that certainly is not a bad thing with this brew. Overall, this is a really good American Lager that ranks right up there with the best of them. Recommended."
"If I could only choose one American lager to drink for the rest of my life, this would be it. I've yet to try a better one thus far, although I'm taking suggestions."
"I can't imagine that anyone would have a hard time finding this brew at any decent beer store. 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Half inch frothy head with gentle pour. Smells of malts and hops. Taste reminds me an awful lot like Sam Adams' flagship lager, except much more subtle on the malt. Unlike SA's, Brooklyn's seems way more drinkable simply for the fact that the sweet caramel malts are much less profound. Overall, tasty beer and a very basic brew in the world of micros."
"Comes out amber with a finger of dustlike white head that fades quickly and leaves a few pocadots of lacing as I wind my way through the beer. The smell is of hearty bread with a hint of toastyness and some floral hops as my nose gets deeper into the glass. The taste has the same without much of a distinct lager taste. There is a great vineous quality to this one, almost of red wine musk. An easy drinker that is delicious."
"Picked this up in Ohio, part of the Brooklyn Beer Party pack. Comes in a brown bottle with history lesson on the label. Served in a pint glass because my pilsner glass is MIA. Inviting golden color with thin head that laces down the glass. Some malt smell. Drinks very smooth with some citrus hop bite. It is hard to fight the temptation to gulp this all down. Again, another well down beer that I wish was available in Wisconsin, or at least North East Illinois."
"Usually not crazy about hop focused beers, but I enjoyed this. A lager with some really crisp hop flavours. I'd have it again."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability : Very nice in the mouth can go with this beer again."
"This is one Hoppy lager! Well built and balanced and very drinkable. An excellent session beer."
"Pours to deep honey amber body. Head is a short one finger of light tan fuzz. Nice woodsy hops meets wheat nose that is soft but appropriate. Mineral and nutty hints exist. Enters the mouth with a very sharp bitter soured feel. Reminds me of a Brittish ale. Mineral notes as well as raw wheat are present on the palate. Mellows a bit with warmth. Bitter feel really hangs around the mouth creating the mouthfeel along with an almost sour vegetable thing going on. Not really my thing."
"Nice coppery/amber color. Poured with a nice head and very effervescent. Nice lacing stayed with the glass through the tasting. Subtle smell, very faint floral aroma. Very hoppy, somewhat similar to an IPA. Not what I expected from a lager. Smooth mouthfeel, but I wouldn't consider this particularly drinkable in that I really wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting. In my opinion, not Brooklyn's best offering."
"D - I think this is the best ""lager"" I've ever had. Drinks much more like a good pale ale. Shame it's availability is so limited in Australia. I could drink this all night long."
"D- Definitely worth a try. Very flavorful and crisp. I can't believe I ""avoided"" this for so long."
"This beer poured a clean medium brown with a foamy head that left a good amount of lacing on the glass. It smells malty and it has a good hop sent too. It has a clean malt body with a hops bite to it. Its a smooth feel with a light finish. In all this is a nice clean well balanced beer. It has a nice flavor with out being overpowering. It lacks any thing too amazing but its well rounded and easy to drink. I would recommend this beer for anyone who likes beer at all but in the end it really doesnt offer a lot. Worth drinking but not an amazing beer."
"I had this one on draft at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Nice hop aroma and attractive amber color. The taste was very hoppy and really appealed to me. The drinkability was very high. I would recommend and will definitely have again, and Im not a huge fan of lagers. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Good beer."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Nice deep golden/amber color with a nice carbonated head that stays for awhile. The aroma is a floral hop, a nice bontique of hop and sweet malt. This reminds me a german lager, but better hop bite and aroma, IMO. Then the flavor is big smooth malty, bready, and crispness that you look for in a lager. The body is full. This one is easy to drink and it makes for a great session brew."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an amber orange color with fluffy foamy head that leaves some serious lace on the glass. Smell is malty bready yeasty funk, a funk that I actually enjoy smelling not a bad one just a bit moldy also a bit lemony smell as well. Taste is very chewy with a bit of hoppy character to it also a goes down smooth and leaves a bit of hop bitterness towards the finish. This is a fine offering for a lager beer and one that goes down very smooth, a good offering from Brooklyn and finally we get some love in Florida."
"D: A beer I could really enjoy outside on a hot summer day. A great choice for grilling or just relaxing."
"I'd recommend this beer to people who don't know what to get a bar and ""want to try something different."" If they say they don't like dark beer, just get this for them and I'm sure they'd be happy. I know I would."
"Overall, I I found this to be a very satisfying lager that reminded me why I favoured lagers for so many years ... it really doesn't get a whole lot better than this. What a steal from Brooklyn New York, thanks from your beer drinking friends in Ontario."
"The most flavorful lager out there (IMO). The hops are the dominant factor with some malt notes and a slightly bitter finish. This makes up for all of the other bland lagers out there."
"I could really have a decent session on this stuff."
"You will never go wrong with this brew. This beer pours a light amber with noticeable hops in the aroma, the cascade hops really show through with a hoppy smell. Taste is light and hoppy, biscuity too, like a low-grav APA. Delicious and very drinkable. A little filling and a bit heavy for this style, but I'm not complaining, This brew is a true American classic."
"A great summer beer with its light body and refreshing quality. Certainly drinkable and sessionable. Approachable enough to serve at a family or work gathering, and interesting enough to be enjoyed by beer geek friends. Good stuff that i will be drinking again."
"D - I could drink this all day, a well-made, well-balanced beer. I will be coming back for more and I am looking forward to other Brooklyn offerings."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer but it still seems too hoppy for me to think of it as a lager."
"Good drinkability, a hoppier American Amber."
"Overall this is a solid Lager beer from one of my favorite U.S. Breweries. I wish that it was more easily available in Canada. Recommended."
"Not filling and tastes great. This is what the macros should target."
"I figured out pretty quickly that this beer is ubiquitous in NYC, and deservingly so. My girl is a little nervous about the baggage, and the beer cost $8.68, but I don't give a damn. My first beer in NYC was well worth it."
"Pours a nice amber color with ample head. Aroma is nice and malty, even fruity somewhat. Taste has a strong malt backbone with just a hint of bitterness. Very nice for an all-malt lager. Goes down smooth and would make a decent lawnmower beer. Definitely would recommend it over other all-malt lagers I've had so far."
"The color is a very warm brown and has a crispy, yet light head. The smell is a blend of chocolate and nuts...that drinks very well. The hops opens up the fruit flavors and stay in your mouth, not leaving a bitter after taste. This is a great beer! Taste even better on draft!"
"Drinkability: A quality beer, I enjoyed this one."
"D: The smoothness and flavor of this beer make for a versatile lager that works well for most any occasion."
"Highly recommended."
"D: Average. I wouldn't pass on this, but with so many other brewers kicking out Lagers that I would prefer over this, I likely won't be back."
"D- The high carbonation, thin body, and aggressive aftertaste don't do much for me. The refreshing hops and caramel malt leave a lot of promise though. Not bad overall."
"D- It was a decent beer before dinner on a warm summer night, but nothing spectacular. I'd take it over many of the ""cleaner"" lagers out there, but after enjoying other Brooklyn offerings I was hoping for a little more out of this one."
"This lager is certainly on the hoppy side. Some initial sweetness, but the herbal hops take over quickly. Not bad, but could use a little more depth of flavor."
"A very easy to drink, solid lager."
"Taste is hops, lemon, spice, malt. Very nicely balanced here as well, very IPA-like in character. Good body - medium leaning fuller - with a nice hoppy/malt blended aftertaste. A very good brew and I'm not a lager man but I would gladly do this one again."
"D - This one goes down pretty smoothly"
"Pours a golden pale amber color with a nice and fluffy white head that dissipated into a decent cap with good lacing on the glass. The smell has a light floral hop scent, I'm picking up some caramel malt. Not an overly pronounced smell. The brew has enough hop presence to notice. The hop flavor is followed up with a light caramel malt taste. The feel is light and well carbonated, an ever so slight bitterness left on the palate. This is a well balanced lager and is very drinkable. A great example of an American lager, good competition with SA Boston Lager."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, theres a lot of substance for a beer in a style that usually doesnt have too much of it, I expected this beer to be decent at best, but was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a very good beer. I could certainly drink a few of these easily."
"I wish they would sell this beer in bottles at the beerstore. If not, i would just have to return again to the pub for the beer on tap."
"I'm not a lager man myself but this would certainly make a good session beer for a slow drinker like me."
"Solid golden amber color with some brown hints too. Very nice two fingers of white frothy head on top. Good looking beer. Nose has a touch of grain, but lots of tasty malt with some nice spices too. Taste is first of a dry, toasted malt that lingers on the tongue. There's a bit of citrus flavor as well, along with a little apricot. Feel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. This one is a good one; for some reason I've been hesitant on Brooklyn stuff, but this one might have single-handedly turned me around. A solid lager with a good flavor and interesting after-taste."
"D. Using only h20, malt, hops and yeast, Brooklyn set up a very drinkable beer."
"D: A very basic lager, that is missing something to me. I think that it could be a little more crisp for the style. Overall worth a try but that is about it."
"Very drinkable, smooth, yet crisp and clean"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Carbonation is nearly perfect in this beer. Definitely light bodied and quite the session beer. I could drink this all night. Overall, this is a very good beer. Highly recommended."
"This is the kind of lager that Sam Adams does so well, good dose of hops and lots of flavour. This is well constructed and well finished making you .a second round while still on the first. The colour is a nice dark golden brown and the nose lets the hops come through. A great session beer that is interesting enough to sip and savour"
"Golden edges around a copper body. Firm, lasting, dirty beige head. A great looking all-malt lager. Caramelly toasted malts mix with light cookie dough and spicy, herbal hops. Cookie sweet malt flavors up front. Toasted, almost nutty middle. Light cooked vegetables and vegetal hop notes. Lasting spicy noble hops in the finish. Moderate body with a smooth feel and a crisp finish. Very drinkable and would be a staple session beer if it were on-tap at my house!"
"D: Not sir, I didnt like this one much."
"A good micro beer by all standards."
"Found this one on a business trip to DC. This beer has a really nice depth to the taste. It was better than I thought it was going to be. The beer had a lovely color out of the bottle with a decent head. The initial taste was smooth but then there was a great hop finish. Very drinkable."
"Taste is very full, hop bitterness balances the caramel and vanilla malt nicely. Light citrus, floral, and a bit herbal. Great balancing act, absolutely delicious. Finish is a bit sticky but very clean with a mild hop bitterness. Medium-light body with a perfect amount of carbonation. This is a dangerously delicious and drinkable lager. I would have this in my fridge all the time if I could get a steady supply. Here's to summer!"
"Drinkability: this beer goes down quite easily, especially once I knew not to expect the carbonation crispness."
"Medium to light bodied. Id say theres not really anything about it that stands out too much, but this is pretty much a quintessential session beer for me."
"Poured a clear copper with a huge, foamy head that lasts. Thick, clumpy lacing and vigorous carbonation add to this beer's visual appeal. Smell exhibits a mild, peppery hop aroma and is both clean and fresh. This is not a beer that has been sitting in a warehouse for awhile. Taste is good. Medium, lingering bitterness makes this a refreshing lager. Mouthfeel is slightly dry with a crisp finish. Overall, drinkability is very good."
"D-This is what i would call a session beer. Or a hot summer day beer as well. Not too many breweries in the US are producing lagers of this quality. This will be in my summertime fridge rotation. Another winner from Bklyn"
"High quality sessionable beer from Brooklyn. Brooklyn just recently came to Illinois and I'm looking forward to trying all of them I can get my hands on."
"This beer has a fairly dark amber color with a creamy off-white head and a clear sparkling body. The aroma is malty, with a distinct caramel smell. It also has a light hoppy smell of pine. The flavor is initially sweet and a bit caramel-like. Has a slight bitter finish. Light to medium body with a soft carbonation and a light astringent finish."
"overall this was a very enjoyable beer, left a very pleasant bitter after taste"
"On a sidenote, this beer (like most lagers) is best enjoyed cold, but it is very good when only cool which is a testament to how good this beer is."
"A casual, drinkable beer. I ended up ordering another round. Great any time!"
"D- A great everyday beer."
"Overall pretty good beer, very enjoyable."
"Even though it's been around for awhile, this is a new favorite of mine and easily one of the most drinkable beers on the market. Whether a newbie or a seasoned drinkers, it's solid complexity captivates and refreshes but does not overwhelm in any sense. A great session beer."
"Even though this was not my favorite style I found it very drinkable. On a summer day I could chill this and drink it all day."
"pours a darker golden color. good head that leaves nice lacing.very fresh smelling, really nice. definitly an inviting beer. good bitterness, slight spice notes, slightly grassy in the finish. very refreshing. definitly how a lager should taste. i don't have anything bad to say about this brew. my favorite lager, and yet another great offering from brooklyn brewery."
"BH."
"12 oz bottle. The beer pours a crystal clear light golden color with a light head over top and a moderate carbonation working out of solution. This one is brilliant. The aroms is slightly grainy, with a honey-kissed sweetness. Very light and very enticing. The flavor more focused on the light grain aspect, with a more subtle sweetness. On the finish, there is a nice grassy hop and a mild bitterness. There is good balance and a very nice taste. Mouthfeel is moderate with a mild carbonation that really works well with the rest of the beer. I enjoy this one as a subtle and drinkable lager. It is very full on flavor, but nothing that gets in the way. I am happy this beer is distributed in Illinois now. It is very nice."
"Finish is bitter and crisp. A nice lager, very drinkable."
"The beer pours a warm caramel/amber tone. Its appears darker than an average lager, and has a very frothy white head. The aroma was plesant but for me was not all together strong enough to note. The taste however was very nice. A bit more hops than most lagers, creating a stronger flavor profile than is expected. It is not as clean and smooth as some more watery lagers but the extra flavor i sappreciated over the lost crispness. It has a medium body that is nice in the mouth and makes each sip enjoyable. Very drinkable beer i would buy again."
"D: Very drinkable. Great ""Session"" beer"
"Drinkabilty, etc: With the heavy hops and enough malt to balance it out, it's more like a Vienna lager, than an American pilsner. I could see this being a session beer in the colder weather. It's not as much the light and crisp style lager to quench your Summertime thirst. I'll definitely make this a regular purchase."
"Final Statement: This is the best lager I've had. Someone said in the forums that it makes you think of the style in a different way, and they are right. This is a well crafted lager, fantastic for hop heads like myself."
"Pours a clear amber, thick white head forms, nice lacing all over the glass, good retention, this head really sticks around. Smell is nice, real hoppy for a lager, lots of florally notes, some citrus, caramel, grains, very pleasant. Taste is sweet and malty, bit of caramel, floral/citrus hopping, nice clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very nice lager, good drink and a nice complexity. Like the hops in this one."
"Pours a light amber color with one finger head. Not much aroma here, a little malt and a little floral. Taste is spicy hops with some lemon. Finish is dry and bitter. Biterness does not make me want to take another sip. Not my idea of a sessionable beer. I would pick it over the macros but probably will not seek this one out again."
"Thanks for the great brew, Brooklyn. Very much on par with the likes of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"It pours out an amber color with some head, not a ton, but it seems to hang on OK. The initial aromatic impression is malty and a little floral. Not much more than that. The first sip hits with me sour bitterness that won't go away. I'm a little past the ""best by"" date, and that may be contributing. Otherwise, the flavor is both crisp and tart, but pretty tame, not complex. It is appropriately carbonated and pretty decent in the mouth. It's OK, but I'm not thrilled, and I'm not inclined to return to it."
"My team lost by 33 pts ... ouch. Ah, well at least theres still beer in the fridge. This poured with a deeper color than Id expected (because I didnt read the label), pretty much an amber-golden beer. The whipped-up head sticks to the top of your lip on the first swallow. Wow, theres a lot of apple in this one, tart light caramel, too. Pretty rich, yet disarmingly drinkable. Well done. (#2750, 3/15/2007)"
"D - Well... it's almost gone already. Easy drinking with a solid flavour. A good sessionable beer."
"Appearance is a perfectly clear amber color with a nice foamy head. The aroma is of malt with some citrus hops. The malty taste is well balanced with the citrus and floral hops. Nice crisp taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Smooth and crisp with some mild carbonation. This is quite drinkable and would make a good session beer. Overall, a very good American-style lager. If this beer is available, there is no need to settle for the macro lagers."
"Phenomenal offering from a fantastic craft brewery. I tried this back in my early beer drinking days (2 years ago) and then tried it again today. It was like tasting it all over again. I liken it to one of the best APAs I've ever had but with lager smoothness. Gorgeous amber color, with small head that disappeared but left a nice tan lacing all over the sides of the glass. Smell was all malt with a tiny hint of floral hops in the nose. Great, firm mouthfeel that really reminded you you're drinking a substantial craft brew. Then the taste... heavy malt with delightful floral hops that tickled the tongue but stopped short of being overpowering. Like a good ale, as it warmed it tasted even better. This is absolutely a wonderful beer!"
"D - Very drinkable, I am happy that I had the pleasure of trying this one down here in Florida."
"From a 12 oz. bottle this brew is better looking than most lagers. It is a crystal clear amber with a very well retained cream colored head. I'm having trouble really picking up anything on the nose, kinda got a hint of some spices, even though there are none actually in this beer. Taste is quite well balanced. Very malty. Very good mouthfeel and highly drinkable. With a nod to all the recent forum talk about session beers, this could be my new one. Simple and good."
"SMD"
"I liked this enough to buy a case. When it's fresh there's plenty of citrus flavour, which subsides within a few weeks of aging, producing a more well-rounded hop profile (floral and even a little grass comes forward)."
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color lager with a nice medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma is hoppier then expected with some light caramel malt. Taste is more bitter and hoppy then I would have expected but still retain some of the light caramel malt that I love in Vienna. While this beer is interesting and refreshing, it resembles more of a hoppy ale ten a Vienna."
"Pours a nice amber/copper, ample head....floral & fruity nose....the taste was again fruity with more hop character than i would have expected...fresh, lively mouthfeel, somewhat creamy....more like a pale ale than a lager i would say but quite drinkable nonetheless"
"One of the best malt lagers I've had. Definitely give it a shot. I look forward to warmer weather and pairing it with some grilled items."
"D - I always like going back to this beer...one of the first micros I ever sampled. If you've never tried it, I'd say grab a sixer, as it goes down pretty easily."
"Good choice for fans of hops, but still fairly well balanced. I very much enjoyed this. Tasty, distinctive, pleasant to drink."
"This is a fantastic lager, and takes the place of Sam Adams as my second favorite American Lager. Its hoppier and lighter on the malt side. Prima Pils still remains king for me though."
"D-Like I said, maybe a little harsh on the hops (and trust me, I love hops) for a lager like this. All said, I am not a huge lager fan to begin with but this is definately the way I would brew a lager myself."
"This brew poured an light amber color with a nice white head. Nose is somewhat bready with a hint of floral hops. Taste is good, heavy on malts that blend very well with the floral hops leaving a somewhat citrusy-bready taste. My taste buds are thinking this is a light APA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall drinkability is very good. This is an extremely quaffable refreshing beer that I would recommend to those that like this style or the APA style."
"Sloshy, with a good body, it spreads very well. A nice buffer for the more intense beers, having these all night would not be uncommon. Something salivating on the side would be necessary, as it would run your mouth dry after too many. Ever have too many grapes, & their skin starts getting to you? Yeah, exactly like that."
"The taste starts with a sweet maltiness that is accented with a spicey hoppiness. This fades to a rich sweet malty middle before finishing with a very nice hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is full and thick but finnishes dry. It has good drinkability with enough flavour to make you want another but not so heavy as to make it a sipper. Overall a very good complex flavourful lager."
"Hard to believe this is a lager just by looking at it. Has a clear amber, much akin to and American IPA. Thin, yet sustained foam throughout. No bubbles to seen but has a thin of lacing. I had to mark it down a bit due to the lack of bubbles. NONE. You must have bubbles to be a lager of this style in my book. Very unique and spicey bitterness to this aroma. Very hoppy and rye like. This was out of left-field for me. The taste was even hoppier. A mild bitterness compared to an IPA, but very high for any lager I've had before this one. Very light biscuit malt profile, the hops take over on this one. Would love to drink this one fresh from the tap to compare. God I hate IL sometimes... just sometimes."
"M&D - well done for the style, for which i didnt expect much, much more complex than i thought it would be, a few levels of flavor when i only expected one or two at most, not smooth but easy down, a nice brew, well done Brooklyn."
"This beer pours rich golden color with about a 3/8"" off-white head (which dissipated quite quickly),and moderate lacing.Scents are of a hoppy/grainy mix. Taste is a very hopped bitter one that left a less than desirable taste on the back of the tongue. Mouth feel is quite good, full and creamy with a stick to the tongue feel.For my personal tastes this is a fogettable beer based on the lingering aftertaste."
"Translucent amber body with around a half an inch of off-white head. Smells hoppy and roasty malty. Tastes hoppy and roasty, kind of citrusy sweet notes in the flavor too. Full-flavored and medium bodied. Not quite as crisp or clean as one might expect a lager to be, but a pretty tasty beer."
"Tasty."
"Poured a deep amber/orange. Smells of floral hops and a bit of malt. Tasted like what a good simple beer should, nice bitterness on a solid malt backbone. I think this gives me an idea that adjunct is not a good thing (this is my first American all malt lager). This is a fine brew that is proof Lager is not a bad word. I'm sure this is going to be perfect on hot summer days."
"Brooklyn Lager is a very nice beer. If this is truly representative of what we Americans drank prior to prohibition, it is truly a shame that beers like this were lost for so many years"
"Carbonation is slightly lower than I expect from this style but the flavor and body make this the standard by which American lagers should be judged. One of the elite for its style."
"A nice little beer, that takes lager a step further than the average. This beer took me beyond Samuel Adams and Anchor Steam, and really fueled and renewed my interest for american beer."
"Wow, this beer really caught me off guard. When open a bottle of an all-malt lager I dont expect much in terms of flavor, but this was on par with a great amber or pale ale. There was rich caramel and fruit flavors with a nice hoppiness. Again, I wouldn't rate this so high, except that this beer is such a stand-out in the style."
"This is a nice crisp lager that goes well with pizza, burgers and a variety of other foods. Furthermore, it is quite affordable."
"d - great beer and very enjoyable from start to finish. glad this is finally in alabama."
"Perfect drinkability. Probably the best lager I've ever had."
"Overall a very drinkable lager. Very sessionable and uniquely hoppy."
"Other comments: The color is startling. I was expecting something golden or yellowy, but instead it's this gorgeous amber. Looks great, tastes great!"
"On tap at the Dove in Greenwich Village. Poured into a pint glass with half-inch head. Amber gold, looked very yummy. Smelled malty and hoppy. Taste full of malt, with that typical Brooklyn Brewery flavor. Medium to heavy bodied. Very drinkable (most nights), my cousins and I drink pint after pint of these babies when they are in town. BL is my favorite hometown beer!"
"Smell is delightfully floral with a grassy and grainy tang. Light and nicely textured in the mouth, with hop bitterness chasing a surprisingly full flavor profile replete with lightly bready notes and a sort of raw-veggie freshness. Very clean in the aftertaste, making this very easy to drink. Another? Yes, please."
"Easy to drink; a great session lager."
"Brooklyn lager pours a clear light orange with a frothy head that lingers nicely. Smell is of fresh hops, as well as a sweet bready aroma, slightly fruity. Nice bitter hop bite up front, followed by a flavorful maltiness. Not as clean as I would expect from a lager, but I really like it. Definitely the beer to give to someone who thinks there are no good lagers out there."
"This is yet another beer that I have seen on the shelf hundreds of times, and always passed on it for something else. Finally the other night I came to my sense and worked up the nerve to grab a sixer. Pours an appealing golden color, with chaimpaigne like bubbles floating to the top and a nice clean, thin white heading. You could definitely smell the malt in this one, along with lots of grains, a bit of a musky tree bark aroma, and a slight hint of mint. Taste starts off slightly fruity, with a small lemon kick, then fades away into the malty grains in the background. Mouthfeel is relatively light, maybe bordering on medium. This is an easy drinking beer for sure....a step above many other golden lagers, and an all around solid choice. Glad I had the oppurtuntiy."
"Drinkability- a very nice lager, my first american all malt lager - a wonderful alternative from the american macro rubbish we normally get in the UK. My favourite american beer to date."
"Drinkability: Yet another great beer from a great Brewery. This one disappeared faster than I wanted it to be. Overall a full flavored, reasonably priced session beer. I could and will drink this again in the future. This is one of Brooklyn Brewery beers you need to try for yourself. It will surprise you!"
"Overall: Not quite what you expect - but this is exactly why this beer shines. Challenging and excellent in equal quantities - my favourite beer at the moment."
"The mouth is medium but very much alive from the carbonation and hop bitterness. Too bad I have to drive over an hour to get more."
"Slightly hazy, amber orange with a dense yet modest yellowed-newsprint head. Wonderful caramel-candy malts in the nose right away with a slight scent of grassy-earthy hops at the end. The sweetness foretold of the caramel malts by the aroma is artfully restrained in the taste, revealing itself to be more of a toasted biscuit/caramel hybrid. A not unexpected grassy hop flavor is also detectable near the finish, which is decidedly metallic and just slighty marked by an earthy compost character. Medium thin body, not overcarbonated at all. Overall, an utterly smooth and clean mouthfeel. This is a classic lager that I really don't have around as much as I should. In my estimation, a flagship beer of which all New Yorkers (even us out here in the western part of the state) should be quite proud."
"Simply put, this is a well-built beer. A nice amber color with a lasting head. Surprisingly deeply malty aroma and taste, with a hop tingle in the finish. Perfectly balanced, with a smooth medium body. Very drinkable, and a dependable beer to fall back on, as it is available everywhere in this city."
"Another new line in my local monopolising supermarket. Hidden away on the bottom shelf, with various obscure (for now) lagers. I poured this into a pilsner glass. Thin off white head, effervescence aplenty. Deep amber colour, not like your average lager. This had a very hoppy aroma to it, with a strong malt backing. Toffee, smokey, with a hint of violet. The taste I found had intense hop bitterness, butterscotch, and a hint of vanilla. More of a pale ale than what Id expect from a lager, hence I marked it fairly low, despite liking it. A nice bitter finish to it though. Although the mouth is a bit heavier than what Id expect from what is labelled a lager, I find it fairly drinkable. Its nice, in a confusing way, because I expected something lighter from what was printed on the label, although I note that its categorized as an all malt lager, so maybe my lack of experience with this style is telling in this. Overall, a good drink which I'll probably buy again. It certainly blows any other American lager Ive had up to now clean out of the water."
"Has a deep amber color, deeper than a normal lager. A nice white ehad sat on top for a good amount of time. A ton of hops in the nose, what's this, an IPA? There's some malt, a little floral scent, a little citrus and yeast. Hops dominate the taste again, with a little malty sweetness. This tastes, again, more like an IPA/APA than an american lager. It's nto that this is a bad bad, I rather like it, but it is not typical of the style. This is fairly drinkable, finishes clean. I'm good with about three of these before all the hops start to burn my tongue."
" It's a bold amber with a decent head and has a slight but nice aroma of yeasty malt and just a trace of hops. It is smooth and well balanced with no discernible aftertaste. Body is light/medium and it's slightly astringent. All in all it's a good beer but it seems too calculated to be moderate in all things to be anything special."
"Quite nice! There's enough complexity to keep it interesting as your tastebuds are carried on a little trip with each sip; and it's rich enough to satiate without becoming overwhelming at some point. Very nicely balanced, and quite drinkable."
"A recent brewery that has begun distribution to the Central Kentucky area. Bought a bottle of each of their offerings. The standard lager...well, it is what it is. It's beer. Though I can't detect anything that is really wrong with the beer, it is lackluster. Lightly malty and earthy hopped. Light and refreshing. Not watery, but I prefered a smoother texture. Modestly grainy and vegital like. Light notes of apple and citrus. Finishes a little abrupt and thinning. Not bad, but must be reserved for those times when out working in the backyard to truely appreciate."
"D: Good session beer. A nice beer overall, and I was looking forward to the second one before the first was even finished."
"D - if it wasnt for the cardboardy / paper taste at the end, it would be a very clean refreshing beer."
"D: Very drinkable, this beer has the good firm malt flavor of a lager and is worth looking at."
"D - A nice one to quaff a few of."
"Freshness label on side of the bottle says this is best before September 2006. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber color with about a half inch white head which goes away very quickly. It leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. It smells mostly like floral and citrusy hops, with some biscuity malts in there also. With the hoppiness it smells more like an IPA than a lager. The beer tastes like citrus hops (grapefruit), with some sweetness and then a slight hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good as well, it's crisp and refreshing. Not what I expected, but a good surprise. I'd drink this again, it could turn into a session beer for me."
"Brooklyn Lager looks like and drinks like a good ol' American made IPA. Somewhat dark for the style, this lager pours a deep topaz with a nice rich malty head. A nose of ferric laden citrus and pine are easily detected, as flavors of well-bittered sweet malts cascade on the tongue. Smooth, plush and snappy, this ""all malt lager"" has something going for it; a well endowed version of the style on steroids. Pick up your sixer today!!"
"It's flavorful - hoppy for style - and enjoyable. A good brew!"
"D  Decent session beer."
"Overall a very, very fine golden lager that stands above most micros I've had (of this style). The character of this lager is strong, but it's very pliable to many people (I would guess). Way to go Garrett!"
"Appearance is a golden amber with a small white head and just a tiny bit of lacing. Aroma is slightly citrusy, as is the taste. A little bitter, the taste of hops comes through, and it's overall dry. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but probably not a great session beer in my opinion. I prefer the Brooklyn Brown."
"This is a lager, but reminds me more of an ale or even a mild IPA. Pours to a golden copper color, with thin, diminishing cream-colored head, and okay lacing. Aroma is citrus fruit, and floral hoppiness. Taste follows along the citurs fruit, predominantly grapefruit, and some floral, rose petal. Finish is somewhat dry, slightly bitter, but long lasting. Im impressed with this beer."
"It's drinkable, but it's not a big thirst quencher."
"Brassy amber. Tall, loose packed buff colored head of medium sized soapy bubbles that slowly settles leaving no lacing, but a smattering of stray foam. Prolific carbonation streams a clearly visible. Light citrus and floral nose, fresh and crisp, with just a touch of biscuity malt. Initially bright with a floral hop note and backed by a solid malt body that adds some biscuit. The finish is a combination of soft, but crisp, citrus rind and light floral esters that persist long after in a pleasing way. Medium body with fine, peppery carbonation. This is tight and well crafted, crisp and refreshing with a nice hoppy finish."
"I would buy this one again."
"Medium body with a nice tongue caress, very quaffable beer. How does Jim Koch sell any beer?"
"Man, i hadn't had this in a while until last night a single bottle appeared at our beer club. Pours golden and clear. small white head with nice looking lacing all around the glass. Smells like a mild lager, which is no say, not like much at all. maybe some hints of apples on the noce. Taste is quite hoppy, which i don't ever think lagers as being. The hops made it very delicious. mmmm. This is a session beer methinks. I'll buy a case to bring home when next i go to New York (which happens to be in 2 days!)"
"Rich, creamy mouthfeel, an enjoyable easy drinking lager."
"Drinkability was high. I found myself done with this rather quickly and wanting more. A good barbq or tailgate beer."
"Served a clear dark amber with a nice 1/2"" white foamy head that lingered. The nose was strong hops and some spiciness. Taste was a bit of hops up front then a malty middle and finish, with a lingering bitterness. A pretty thin mouth feel, but very drinkable."
"I can't help but point out a lot of ale characteristics in Brooklyn Lager. It has piney/citrusy hop features and fruity notes associated with top-fermented beers. Not as crisp as you'd expect, but still a good beer."
"Eh, this beer seems like a mess. It's an APA wannabe lager, and not great at either. This is as mediocre as they come."
"a copper beer with decent head and lacing"
"Cheers."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer. A good break from all of the ales i've been drinking."
"Still, I'd indulge again without question, and it's interesting enough to get me behind the idea of seeing what else Brooklyn can do."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - this is my first, and I really don't think the six pack will survive the night. If only I could get it locally!"
"Drinkability: pretty darn good, if you ask me. Polished off the glass and found myself wishing for another. A well-crafted brew. Recommended without reservation."
"drinkability is very good. if you don't watch yourself the glass is over before you know it. once again, a simple, but expertly crafted beer."
"Medium copper, but very clear body with steady carbonation and a thin head. Smell of grain grain, piney resin and some sweet citrus. The taste is of a dry sweet grainy husk, light herbal tea, dry walnut taste, citrusy bite with a piney finish. All in all a good beer, really crisp and went down easy."
"Goldish amber color with a medium frothy head that lingers. Lacing not really there. Aroma was strong on the floral hoppy aspect. Not really bitter but quite floral with a pleasant hoppiness in the background. The taste begins with that floral quality. A bit of spicyness comes in and provides some bitterness but that doesn't last too long. Caramel is the only malt flavor I detect. Malts seem to be simple here and basically just provide the base for the hoppy flavors. Finish is almost fruity but with a bit of residual sugars to it as well. Not really too crisp or refreshing but definitely enjoyable. This is a full bodied lager. I could use a little more malt flavor and a better finish but other than that this is top notch."
"Excellent beer, overall, and makes me rethink Brooklyn."
"Can be drunk without disappointment, and no end in sight for the taste. Very, very nice!"
"Amber color with busy carbonation and a fat creamy head on top. Decent retention as a milky covering. Nice pleasant floral hop aroma along with toasted malts - a little creamy. The flavor is fresh and malty with a dry spicy hop finish and a mellow fruitiness. Plenty of hops in this lager. Medium bodied and crisp, easy to drink - a very solid dry-hopped lager."
"A very good solid and pleasant lager."
"The ubiquitous (at least in the Northeast) Brooklyn Lager pours a light amber color with a copious head that thins to a white dusting but can be agitated back into existence. The nose is mostly sweet malts, with some hints of lemongrass. Taste is predominantly sweet, but with a distinct hop note. This beer centers itself in the front of the palate. The finish is fairly long for a lager of this color, and the mouthfeel is quite smooth. This is a very drinkable, tasty beer, although not a terribly complex one. A great session beer, though."
"NOt a bad beer, but to me it seemed more like a pale ale than a lager. It wasn't terrible, but not really what I was expecting. I doubt I'd drink it again."
"Musings: A good drinking lager - nothing spectacular."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Recommended..."
"Poured out orange, with with head, that had some lacing. Malt, sweet, slight caramel, with notes of pine and some pungent. Tastes of malt, some grapefruit, hay/straw, and hoppiness to finish. Bitter aftertaste, with some dryness in the throat. Nice lager, very drinkable. Not overwhelming in any of the flavors, or aroma. Low alcohol percentage allows for a nice drinkability to go through the long night."
"Overall- a nice lager with flavor to it!! A beer I relyed on heavily 1 night in a bar called ""stitch"" in the garment section of NY. I converted 3 guys from Calgary from Bud to Brooklyn."
" This is not my favorite offering by Brooklyn, but I've had this at Grimaldi's (best pizza in New York City!) and other places around the borough that offer great food and this brew. It's worthy to be served at great establishments, and this is one of the few beers I know of that could suit a ride range of tastes and times. A solid offering indeed..."
"Dark orange with minimal head, no lace, appears still. Sweaty saltine and hops odor. Malt and hops blend together exceptionally well throughout the taste. While the finish is a little wet, it is lingering and satisfying. Decent mouthfeel for the style and one of the family favorites for casual beer drinking. Recommended for most refrigerators."
"d - Good with food, good by itself. Found myself liking it more and more as I approached the bottom of the glass."
"Overall - I'm not usually a lager drinker, but this is one that could change my mind. Fabulous beer, goes perfectly with pizza or pasta or those type foods. This would be a great beer to have ready in the fridge for those friends who ""don't like fancy beer," but would if they had this. Highly recommended."
"The sales pitch around this beer has deterred me from buying it but in the spur of the moment I decided to bring a bottle home anyway. It's a brew that pretty much pleases everyone. Normally this will put a beer lover off but I was positively surprised. It poured with a finger of foam or so, and with a nice reddish amber color. The smell was stong and citrusy, surprisingly similar to an IPA. The main thrust of the taste is a pronounced bitterness wrapped with a sweetness and some malts. A little toast in the aftertaste. The mouth-feel is creamy and in general I think Brooklyn lager is a well-balanced beer. Pleasing but perhaps lacking in character."
"Overall = Nothing spectacular or unique. Doesn't really remind me of the lagers I've tried before, although it is a different style. Comparing this to most lagers it kicks butt. On it's own it's still a decent beer and is pretty drinkable."
"Grassy malt and bitter hops. Light fruitiness from the malt. Persistent low level herbal hops. Lightly sticky mouth and long longering bitterness. Pretty good stuff."
"D - This is excellent for a lager. The lager has as much depth as your average IPA, while still leaving a subtle presence. This would be a fabulous session beer, would go well with food. It is actually worse in drinkablity than your typical decent macro, because the flavor is so complex. Now, if only it were as costly as the average macro! Brooklyn is an awesome brewery. I'll have to make my way up there one of these days."
"The beer pours an orangish golden with a frothy head that holds and laces nicely. There are subtle hop aromas balanced nicely with some sweetness from the malt. The overall smell however is not that strong. The beer tastes fairly similar to the smell however the taste is not weak at all. There is a decent mouthfell complemented by smooth carbonation. Overall this is a fantastic beer for what it is. There was even more of a hop presence than I was expecting which was quite welcome."
"This pours a honey/like color with a smallish head.The smell is not really that strong,but you can make out some malt aromas.The taste has a real sweet malt flavor that is a real delight.The m/f is light,but it does have a slight watery aftertaste.This beer is one that could be an everyday beer.It's not perfect,but it's worth trying."
"This beer pours a sweet reddish amber color, and leaves a thin white head that disappates quickly. The smell is very malty with caramel aspects that give hints of honey and lemon. The taste of this lager is crisp and refreshing the sticky sweet malt weighs on your palate in a good way and there is a lemon wheat flavor on the palate that makes this a balanced refreshing brew to drink all day def session quality."
"Clear, golden orange colour toped by a short, off-white head. The foam reduces fairly quickly, but leaves behind some nice lacing. Bold, hoppy aroma for a lager, quite floral with a hint of herbal and citrus character. Mellow sweet malt, maybe a bit toasty, hides in there as well. Hops kick off the flavour, melding into a balanced sweetness and a bit of fruit at the mid. It finishes with a lingering hop bitterness with plenty of flavour. Medium/light body with just the right balance of gentle carbonation to provide a creamy texture. Finishes with just a hint of dryness. This is a quality lager, a pleasure to drink. If I see this on tap, I'll definitely give it a try."
" Not much bad to say about this one. For a lager, this borders on amazingly good and I could drink it all day."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a pretty medium amber with a good two finger head, good longevity and very good lace. Good malty presence with a bit of caramel and spicy hop aromas. Good malty flavors with a good bit of hop spicyness and bitterness - even more than the pale ale I think. Leaves a nice hop bitterness all over the tounge. It is perhaps a bit too hoppy for a beer in this catergory, but it is a tasty one and a good solid beer."
"I am surprised that I have not reviewed the Brooklyn Lager before but here it goes. The brew pours to a nice amber color with a nice fat white head that has great retention and leaves sheets of lace down the sides of the glass. Looks to be very carbonated with the amount of bubbles traversing up the side of the glass. The first aroma that I notice is the hops, according to the website it is German Hallertauer, Vanguard, and Cascade hops. Seems that I notice the cascade hop more than the others but that is probably due to inexperience. The taste is crisp, very fresh feel. Notice the caramel malt a bit at the start but it does have a heavy hop taste, more flowery than citrus. Very nice brew, might not be one if I am having friends over that like a more all purpose lager with the hop aromas and taste but for me a pretty good session brew. Very good product from the Brooklyn brewery."
"I really like this beer. It has tons of flavor for a lager, with a great hop character, but the malt is right there, also. People talk about the perfect ""lawn mower"" beer; this has to be considered in the mix. Very crisp and refreshing. Highly recommended."
"Best buy date of Pours a copper color that was darker than expected with nice carbonation rising to the top and a thina off white head, could definately pass for an APA. The aroma is layered and has an english air to it, with floral hops, toasted bread, light caramel, minerals and some fruity yeast elements that i was not expecting...surprisingly complex in the aroma. The flavor is also coplex and well balanced, with toasted bread, biscuit, and caramel malt flavors and some floral and citrusy hops...seems alot more like an english ale than an american lager but its freakin good regardless. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a slightly bigger body than your typical lager but still very drinkable and refreshing. Another good offering from brooklyn...nothing spectacular here, but a good, easy drinking and flavorful session beer"
"Drinkability: A nice transitional beer. Wouldn't offend to many palates. I could see myself drinking a bunch of these, a good tailgate beer or session beer especially with the 5% abv. Worth a try."
"This is a non-compromising lager beer; very American micro."
"This washed down very nicely with my spicy chipotle-orange barbeque chicken on a bun. The citrus flavors balanced perfectly with the orange bbq and the hops balanced the spice. Every sip was pure refreshment to my burning tongue. I found this was fairly easy to drink on its own as well, though a little bold for a session beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Pass me another, please. A winner in the American All-Malt Lager category."
"Definitely one of my favorite brews. Great with any gamey meat dish, like venison. Reminds me of the taste in the air during autumn in the northeast? So ask your local bar  Where Brooklyn at?"
"An average beer lacking in complexity and balanced character; but a reasonable example of the style. It pours a medium-gold color with good carbonation. Rather subtle malt smell. Bland taste without complexity or backbone; malt presence is all there is. Unpleasant aftertaste due to the residual sugar texture. I didn't enjoy this beer, but I think under the right conditions a few of these could be had. A more balanced body is needed to make this more enjoyable, but then it might not be the right style."
"D- This is a great fresh example of and all-malt lager. If this was a typical lager pre-prohibition then they had it pretty good. Good complexity and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is chewy and bubbly, medium-bodied, very nice. Very drinkable, as more Brooklyn brews are. I hesitate to rate this as is, part of me wants to rate it lower because I don't think it's reeeeally a lager... but I liked it. So there."
"Fear not the bottom-fermenting yeasts. This beer is smooth, has some nice, mild grainy flavors, and sports just enough hops that the IPA lover in me doesn't feel ashamed to have this beer in my hands. While I'm not a huge fan of this style, this beer proves that the style deserves some respect. Bud, Miller, and Coors, try this one out and realize that your beers don't have to suck."
"This is a nice entry level beer that I will share with my macro enamoured neighbors."
"starts out Ok, with floral aroma and reasonable appearance with head. First sips fine, but tires quickly. Not so drinkable. Some bitterness and balance. Malts and Ok aftertaste but just damn boring and plain. J'accuse. Least liked of the Brooklyn product line."
"Aroma of spicy hops. Tastes citrusy, inital hop taste is strong but mellows with the malt. No strong aftertase. A very drinkable, different lager. Definitely reccomend trying this one."
"Best before Oct 05. Pours a bright amber with a finger of white head and not much lacing. Smell is suprisingly full of floral hops with a light bready malt coming through as well. Taste is not like a normal lager, with a pretty strong hop taste hitting upfront mellowing into a slightly sweet malt that completely balances the hops and hardly leaves an aftertaste at all. Medium bodied with a lower carbonation level than most American lagers, this feels great in the mouth. This is a really nice beer that I would share with my macro drinking friends---best American lager I've had."
"Brooklyn Lager is the second superb Brooklyn offering that I've had in the past several weeks (Brooklyn Pilsner was the other). I'll have to give the nod to this one, though. The secrets of its success include a healthy amount of malt, an even more healthy amount of hops, and an inspired hop bill of disparate, yet wonderfully complementary, flavors. I like this one a lot."
"Drinkablity: This came in a sampler case and I only have 3 left, oh no. I will definitely be getting some more."
"Date notched on the side of the label. That is a good start. The color is an inviting dark amber, topped off with a decent tan head. The aroma is all hops. So different from what I expect in a ""lager"" but such a welcome surprise. Brooklyn makes a nice beer with this one. Great hop flavors pushing right up to its malt counterpart. Perfect balance and amazing taste. This makes an outstanding session brew. I feel very fortunate to have this as one of my locals. This is my absolute favorite lager and a must try for anyone in the NY area."
"Solid stuff."
"A real tasty treat from Brooklyn. Pours an amber color with a nice one finger head that diminishes to a frothy cap. Very inviting smell, with a fruity base to it and a sweet, almost syrupy accompaniment. As far as taste goes it is very refreshing. A burst of leafy hoppiness followed by a sweet, fruity maltiness. Hints of raisins, grapes, and oranges intermingle in this just-above-simple brew. It is extremely tasty, if I may reiterate. In between the light and medium aspects of body, it has a semi-apparent carbonation that is rejuvenating. One of the more quaffable brews I've had, and a delight to imbibe."
"Really surprising... Don't be scared by the ""lager"" title on the outside of this one, it has amazing depth and flavor. The smell is hoppy, almost as much so as an IPA and the taste is the same way. Color is reddish-brown with a moderate head. The first sip is pretty pungent, especially if you are expecting anything like a traditional lager. The hops take shape right away. As it goes down in mellows out and almost entirely leaves your mouth, so there is no strong aftertaste. Recommended to anyone."
"Overall-one of the more flavorful lagers I've ever had, somewhat similar to Sam Adams Boston Lager but more floral in my opinion. Nice beer, I look forward to more Brooklyn releases."
"Drinkability is quite good as a result, and it's a great beer for outdoor events: concert, BBQ, etc."
"12 oz., best by Oct. '05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. As the bottle states, it is amber gold, and it's topped by a 1 finger tan head that slowly recedes and leaves little bits of lacing. All I got in the aroma was citric and floral hops. There are piney/citric/floral hops on the palate that are spicy and leave a nice bitterness, and they're balanced by caramel and biscuity/toasty malts that give it a medium to full body (the bubbles rise slowly). The mouthfeel is a little tingly but still fairly smooth. This makes me think of a bottom-fermented Sierra Nevada Pale Ale recipe. A delicious lager."
"Mouthfeel is creamy for this style, medium bodied, and has a biscuity, floral hop finish. Well done. Now I can renenber why I used to drink this."
"I am not only enamoured with the kickass graphic design of the bottles(by Milton Glaser) but also the taste. There is something special about this brewery. The sticky sweet taste that I am so addicted to. The lager pours a gorgeous red amber color with a nice white head. The smell is so friendly. You can smell the hoppinesss. The taste is crisp as hell. The hops rock. The malts rock. In terms of specific flavors I won't go into it, it is a crazy melding of all sorts of goodness. The taste is unique and so pleasant. I love all of their stuff. The mouthfeel is sticky and it is so damn drinkable."
"Pours from the bottle a reddish amber color with a white head. Smells clean, with sweet malt and considerable hop aroma, smells of light brown sugars and maybe some slight herbals. No grainy aroma evident. Crisp and clean on the tongue, with a perfect amount of carbonation. Malt taste evident at first, accompanied by a nice hop bitterness. Finishes with a lingering, bitter hop flavor. Another good one from Brooklyn. I prefer this one on the cooler of summer nights. Brooklyn Lager is smooth, clean and refreshing; yet full and flavorful at the same time."
"Many thanks to lenin for all of the Brooklyn beers.."
"One of the best examples of what would be considered a ""pre-prohibition""-style lager (obvoiusly indigenous to the U.S.). Pours a lightly hazed orangy amber with a foamy off-white head that dissipates into a thin collar. Some toasty and husky malt aromas with flickerings of lower-alpha German hills hops. Some underlying sweetness, but almost sublime. Good flavor. Huskiness and lightly floral hops play a major role, and a citrusy astringency nearer the finish is most interesting, because it doesn't seem related to the hops. Mouthfeel and texture is medium bodied and carbonation level is average to slightly above, which may account for the citrusiness (carbonic acid). A heartier lager whilst maintaining an average ABV. My kind of session lager."
"This is my kind of lager; a bit hopped up, but not overdone as in many American IPAs, and super refreshing. Pours a very clear light orange amber color with an average head that disappears quickly. Smell and taste have a strong malt foundation with some sweet honey butterscotch notes and at the same time citrusy hoppy and piney, perfect balance here. Smooth mouthfeel, this is another perfect summer beer... bring it on!"
"A clean golden orange colored beer. Has a small creamy off white head with some lace. The aroma starts with an nice hoppy citrusy and tea like character. With a smooth sweet caramel malty background. There is a quick snap of hop followed by the tea like character. then a bit of malt sweetness on the sides of the tongue and back the hops for an even bitter and dry finish."
"Pour tawny and clear with a very nice foamy off-white head with nice retention. Mostly hops in the nose, and little malt able to be smelled. Faint biscuit malt in the first taste leading to a citrusy hoppy finish. I would like a little bit more malt backing in it though. Maybe that's just me. Mouthfeel is nice, and this is a very refreshing brew. Still, would like to have more malt."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this one."
"If every macro-brewed American lager were half as good as this, we would live in a much better beer culture to be sure."
"Filmy cream of sheening head that has a fair amount of stick. Light amber hue is clear and has a fair amount of action going on. Soapy malt wash on nose leaves mouth watering, and just a touch of light oak. Bite at top of goodly caramel malt and a wash of lemonade finings on mouth makes this pour whoringly refreshing; I will search for this during the summer months without reservation."
"This is a pretty good beer. I just cannot find a characteristic that separates it from any other. It's slightly above normal. But I like it."
"Has a clear light amber color with a decent head. The head settles to a lace around the glass. Smells very hoppy. A spicy floral hop. Has a firm malty body. Taste very hoppy but has enough sweet malts to go around. All round a good lager. Not quite a Boston lager but makes a great session beer."
"I don't care much for this style, but bought this one along with some other Brooklyns that I've never tried over the past week. This pours a clear amber body, with a thick, offwhite head that stands about a centimeter tall and insists on hanging around, eventually leaving some impressive lacing on the glass. Aroma is very lagerish, with vague sweet maltiness and some floral hops. Mouthfeel is typical for style, with a light medium body and high carbonation. Crisp and refreshing for the most part, with slight floral hops bitterness. Malt is quite bready, but thankfully stays in the background for the most part. Another quality brew from a fine NYC brewery. This is a good one for fans of American lagers."
"Overall a very drinkable nondescript lager with a bit more hops that I was expecting. Not too bad!"
"A very tasty beer and straightforward brew. Thick malty backbone with a melted caramel sweetness. Slight buttery backdrop with a clean hoppy finish. The Brooklyn Lager has great drinkability level and would make a good choice to pair up with a number of different foods."
"Decent beer, nothing to get that excited about, but good enough."
"As it warmed malt became much more pronounced yet retained a good balance with the sublte bittering hops."
"Golden yellow colored, with active carbonation and a medium foamy head, this was a classic looking lager when poured into a Pilsner glass from the signature minimalist Brooklyn styled brown bottle. The aroma indicated presence of sweet honey and caramel malt and noble grassy hops in this beer, and after the first sip I could tell that it did not lie. Medium bodied, bready, sticky, creamy, and slightly salty, this is a moderately flavored, crowd pleasing lager with enough character, and hoppy bite, so that it would not disappoint even the seasoned beer connoisseur (among whose ranks I would not place myself, I might add). Worth seeking out if in the mood for some simpler pleasures."
"Clear, pale amber-brown body with a good head. Theres a slight tingle in the nose. The flavor has a slightly bready malt. This is extremely drinkable and actually not a bad beer by any stretch. I actually preferred this over the disapointing Pilsner."
"I could drink this regularly with no complaints. A nice solid beer."
"For its niche this beer is quite good indeed and worth a look."
"A slightly above average beer in most respects. Solid, but nothing amazing. I'll be sure to try it on tap when I have a chance, but I probably won't buy any more. If you like lagers but don't want an American macro, check out this offering from Brooklyn."
"Pours with an inch-deep head that quickly fades to a spotty, soapish off-white film despite a fairly high level of carbonation. Beer is translucent sienna in color with bronze highlights bordering on orange. Clean, somewhat dry nosefeel with light aromas of toasted malts. Smooth, not-too-sweet malt flavors share the stage with a surprising amount of hop bitterness. Surprising amount of overall flavor, actually... Mouthfeel is firm and hardly overcarbonated, with a nice bitter aftertaste that hangs around for several seconds after each swallow. There's not much going on here, but this would be serviceable for heavy session drinking. At any rate, I'd take this over just about any other standard American lager from a comparably-sized brewery."
"It poured a good looking light bronze with a small white head. It had a pleasant light hoppy smell too it. The taste fell in line although there was more hop in the taste than the nose. There wasn't much malt to this one, just a lot of hops. The feel was light and very dry. This is one of those beers where you could tell it had been well brewed, but it just isn't your beer. This lager has just too much hops for my taste and I'd be looking for an alternative."
"After tasting again, this is one of the hoppiest lagers I've had to date. I was really pleased with this brew. Great on-tap as well."
"The elements of this brew mesh very well together. The hop presence was more assertive than I would have predicted, but the brew is not bitter at all and is in fact dangerously easy to drink. It can be compared to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but overall I would rank this a top session brew."
"Poured out an amber color with a nice head that lasted for a good while. Smell consisted of sweet malts with an undertone of hops and caramel, but it was a little subtle though. Taste made up for it though. It's more on the sweet side. Sweeten malts come up first with an underlying of hops (which seems to be big at times) and some caramel. Moutfeel is medium which was good. This is a perfect example of a session beer. A good beer."
"At a party recently my german friend noted that this was one hoppy lager. I tried it. Yeah, yeah. Hops. It pours clean and golden with slight hints of red. Nose is hoppy, but not overly so. Taste is clean, remarkably, with malt notes and that lager sourness/grassyness mixed in with the hops, and dies down to a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice if a bit carbonated, but it adds to the clean and crisp of the lager. Maybe one day I'll devote a Friday at the brewery to this one. I'm coming around to lagers. Slowly, but this one is good enough to make me want to try more."
"Poured a deep golden in color with a *HUGE* sticky white head. All sorts of lacing. Aromas are caramel sweet with some flowery hoppy-ness. Flavor is pretty tasty. I wish had this in a can in college. Flavorful mix of caramel sweetness mixed with a muted hop note. Nice mouthfeel, medium body. Very drinkable."
"This beer poured a golden amber color with a 1 inch cream colored head. Looks pretty good. The smell was just malt and floral hops. The taste was likewise. Good balance between the two. More hop flavor then expected which balanced the anticipated strong malt flavor. This lager is better than average and I would drink these anytime. Very drinkable. This would be good for a session."
"decent but for 8 bucks a 6 its a bit pricey for what you get out of this one"
"The head is dense and regular; it fades smoothly and slowly on the amber orange color body. The smell showed a great and sweet fruitiness, mostly red fruits; yeasty, with light hints of chocolate. The taste didn't completely fulfill the expections I got from the smell. It is good, but the red fruit notes are much less noticeable. There's more of a tart grapefruit aspect that bites the tongue; or maybe it's more floral. The round and very sweet maltiness sometimes evokes caramel. The hops are quite thick and probably contribute to the grapefruit/floral aspect of the brew. I'm confused about this aspect though. I guess it just didn't give me what I thought it'd give me from the smell. Still a remarkable lager."
"Richly amber in color, the nose is of sweaty, sticky, cheap, yellow hop buds. Caramel sundae topping struggles to emerge from underneath the piercing load of herb. On the palate it is sharp, with an awkward clash of ingredients and a deficit of integration and harmony. It tastes somewhat rushed and painted by numbers. Alternating impressions of gritty metal and gastric acids are mild, but still too obvious. Some indiscriminate hop-heads may be delighted with this beer. I doubt, however, that one could honestly take pleasure in consuming it on a regular basis."
"This is a delicious and drinkable beer. Pretty long-lasting tannish white thick cream head. Streaming lacing. Smell is lightly sweet malts, with flowery hop notes. Great dark orange lager color. Taste is subtle and addicting, round mouthquenching malts interplayed with bitter clean hops. Mouthfeel is varied with smooth rich malts and dry hops and ends happily clean. Could've had about 8 of these I think."
"Overall: This is one of the best American-made lagers I've had. It's slightly similar to Anchor Steam, but different. Highly recommended."
"A great marathon beer. I've found I like this beer towards the end of a long night. It quenches the thirst, and still has alcohol. But not so much that things turn ugly. Plus, it tastes great. Sweet hops and only slightly bitter--pleasantly so mind you. It poured copper in color with a thin head. Very little lace formed around the glass. I could be quite happy drinking this beer while BBQing on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good. This beer has a very well developed taste with a good hops character. However, the hops are not overpowering and therefore do not leave a strong aftertaste, which makes for good drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Nice amber color with good head retention and very good lacing. Smell is a nice rounded malt with a hint of yeast. Taste is initially sweet and finishes with a nice bitter element. Mouthfeel is very smooth and easy on the palate. Drinkability is fine due to smooth quality good mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a nice dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades slowly to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent that boasts of pale malts lager yeast and a breadlike aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter and bready. It has a bit of hops present which only adds to the taste. The mouthfeel is great. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of the best lagers I've ever had. It has great malt character and excellent mouthfeel; a great drinking lager."
"This lager poured a clear, dark amber color with off-white foam that settled and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was malty and fruity with a bit of hops in the nose. The taste was malty with a faint dry caramel character and with some fruity and floral hops notes. The finish was lightly hoppy with a touch of a woody taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and relatively clean with medium body and medium carbonation, and overall it was fairly dry. This was a very respectable lager."
"A legend in the realms of the session beer. A superb lager, one I keep coming back to time after time"
"Pours a golden amber with tannish firm head that settles nicely and leaves a sheeting of lacing.Aroma is bready with a floral note and a hint of citrus, Nothing like the smell of a Brooklyn Lager freshly poured. Nice big malt flavor and a surprising hop note that some might find strange in a lager however seems perfect and quite surprising. Carbonation is not overdone making this a smooth crisp refreshing brew that could easily be a great session beer but is a little sneaky with a 5.0 A.B.V. If the choices are limited, you can't go wrong by ordering this."
"Medium bodied, but I didn't like the way this felt too 'acidic'. Good bitterness for this style of lager."
"Good solid bland lager."
"The taste was very carbonated, if you know what I mean. I can imagine this being a fine session beer, because it is lightly bodied, nicely balanced, and quite frankly, does not have an overwhelming amount of flavor. Sweet malt and then a cleaning swipe of hops, and a lingering sweetness. But flavor, well it tastes like a Yuengling. Not at all unpleasant, and one I can see drinking when Im going to have more than one (Ok, 5), but as a nightcap, it leaves a little bit to be desired."
"First sip reveals average body and carbonation. The flavor is light and grainy malt with some grassy hop notes coming through. This is a very smooth and easy to drink beer. A good lager."
"A little more pale than I thought it would be. The head didn't shape up either. Tastes good though. At first I got this sublte hop flavor, I'm not sure what kind. By the end, an extremely prevalent sweetness came through, almost like a dopplebock type malty flavor. Actually, I'm not sure whether this was because it was the end of the beer or because it had warmed a little. The sweetness was slightly overbearing but nothing I couldn't handle. For the most part a very solid, drinkable beer, though I'd rather have a Sammy, but that's just me. Oh, and the mouthfeel is superb; a real high note."
"This is a great lager. Not like what the macro breweries have done to the name. It has a really nice foral scent with a nice smooth malty and hoppy taste. Brooklyn has made one of the best lagers outside of Germany."
"12 ounce bottle, best before date of June '04, yeah fresh beer! Golden amber, with an outmeal colored head. Soft malt, yeast and flowery hops in the nose.Balance and drinkability are the theme here. Freshness of the hops is obvious. A nice clean lager, a great session brew."
"When you venture into New York City area quite a bit, you definitely see this beer around enough and it is often a very good choice depending on what place you go to. This beer may not be in the upper tier of beers but it is certainly good. The first thing that strikes you about it is its nice amber color. It is a hoppy beer which goes down very smooth. It has decent carbonation, it is a lager as the title shows but it doesn't have too much of a lingering aftertaste, which is something that turns some people off. This makes it a great beer to buy a friend at a bar which has a good beer selection that may not know much about beers other than macros."
"Nice amber color with decent head that fades to a fizzy minute head. Leaves a little lacing Quite aromatic for a lager with hints of hops. Taste is a good clean flavor with a hop bite. This is a unique taste to most lagers and Brooklyn pulls it off well. Crisp aftertaste with that lingering hop flavor. Well balanced malts and a overall good brew. Very drinkable and I'm not a big lager fan."
"Drinkability: This would make a nice session beer. Nicely done."
"The classic Amber Lager. Pours a light red with a white head. Sweet malt with a suprisingly floral hop aroma smell is mild. Taste mimics the aroma of the beer. Tingly carbonation on the mouth with an easy drinkability. Pairs nicely with the pepperoni and mushroom pie at Grimaldi's."
"Mouthfeel: Good overall mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Good thickness in the mouth."
"Very smooth at first then a slight crispness hits the back of your tongue. Clean finish. Extremely drinkable and very enjoyable. One of my favorite lagers."
"This was a very satisfying brew."
"orangy light amber color with a slight off-white/cream colored head. grassy hoppy aroma, wasn't expecting that has a sweet chewy malty aroma with bready and toffee hints. very well balanced with a juicy taste. slight hint of a butter in the aftertaste. an excellent lager, one of the absolute best I've ever had."
"This beer pours a clear amber color into my 16 oz Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. White foamy head lingers which leaves good lacing. Starts fruity and malty, but finishes dry with some nice hop bitterness - Hallertauer and Cascade hops. This well balanced beer is round and crisp and makes for a nice session beer. It's a constant staple in my fridge. I've been drinking this since the early '90's and makes for a good cross-over beer for macro drinkers. One of the most under-rated beers on this site."
"Poured a dirty white, foamy head. Its leaving a bit of lace as it sinks back down into the beer. The smell is of sweet malts. The beer is light amber in color and pretty clear. The taste is just a bit sweet, it's definitely leaning toward the malt side, but there's enough hops in there to keep it from going to far. This beer is just ok out of the bottle. I had a can (yes can!) of Brooklyn Lager a couple months ago and it was super hoppys, kinda like a lager/IPA hybrid, and I loved it."
"Tasted: 10/25/03"
"A really good lager, somewhat in the mold of Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but much better. Sweetish malts give way too a nicely hoppy spicy, dry-ish finish, lots of flavour, yet mildly refreshing, really nice quaffer, not really complex in any way, just nice n' tasty and enjoyable to drink."
"Pours clear copper, smallish white head that sticks around quite well, and leaves good lacing. Body has a lot of tiny bubbles meandering about. Aroma is mainly caramel and some other malt sweetness, some hops playing around in the back to balance it out nicely. Flavor starts with some caramel, middle is clean with a slight fruitiness, ends with a good chewy and tasty hoppiness. Body is medium, medium carbonation level, easy drinking and smooth."
"Another good beer in a can tastee. Pours darker than most ""pale lagers"" that I've had. Not much smell, some malts, a little hops. Has a very nice malty flavor and a hop bite. No fillers or adjuncts in there what so ever. Smooth taste and much better than any macro lager out there. Very nice."
"Amber body continually pierced by light carbonation. Fine ad rocky white head topped it all off for a little while before the mass melted into a thin layer of sticky fluff. This is a very easy drinking and uncomplicated beer. Lightly hopped and modest malt, this beer has always reminded me of a good version of Yuengling Lager. Strange metallic flavors build on the finish the more you drink. I hope this is never the first Brooklyn beer that anyone tries. Its not bad, but when compared to their other brews it is nothing great."
"I don't know how much the order of beers had determines how tastey they all are, but this was the last I tried tonight and boy was it good. Usually the last beer I have tastes the worst because I fail to adequately cleanse my palate, but tonight was an exception. I'm tasting a remarkable hop content for a lager, almost enough to make it a pale ale. In fact, that would make sense since it has a bold amber coloration. A notably fruity nose makes Brooklyn Lager especially unique. Tastes pretty damn good, will probably buy again. This and that, bla bla bla."
"Drinkability - A very versatile beer. A light enough style to be a session beer all by itself, but enough character to stand up admirably if paired with food. I suspect the hops would hold their own reasonably well with wings or barbecue."
"Clear and golden in color with a thin white head. Aroma is malty with some citrusy hops. Taste starts out sweet like caramel with a zesty lemony finish. Very bitter in the finish which may not please most beer drinking novices. Not the best from brooklyn, but it's a classic in the microbrewing industry."
"12oz. bottle poured into a sample tasting cup. It pours a classic amber color with one rocky finger of head. There is lots of lacing left on the cup. The smell is a mix of sweet malt and slightly grassy hops. The taste starts with rich malt, and ends with a good dose of hops. Pretty hoppy for a lager. The balance is very nice. The body is a little light, but very smooth. The drinkability is great, and this is good to go for the summer."
"Noticable hop presence on the nose, which surprised me. Nice crisp taste, slightly toasted malt, and crisp hop finish. More hops than I ever would have thought from a lager. Very crisp and refreshing. Medium body, nicely carbonated. Taste is less full, less gas filled, and much crisper and more refreshing than a Boston Lager. This could be the perfect grilling beer."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that left circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation is also present. One of the darkest lagers I have ever seen. An aroma of malt and hops are present with a touch of caramel. A flavor of malt and caramel. A rather crisp and light finish to it. The coloration and the flavor isn't bad, but I guess this brewer is trying to point to an older way of brewing lagers like Victory's does."
"Pours a medium golden color, topped by a solid white head that shows good retention and lacing. The smell is more malty than most, and a little light on overall aroma. Faint hop notes are also evident. The taste is fairly malty for a lager, but it has a substantial hop bite on the finish. I was actually surprised by the overall flavor profile of this beer. The mouthfeel is solid, and the overall package makes for a supremely drinakble beer. I'll revisit it later after my initial impression fades a bit, but I have to get this one in the fridge soon."
"In the transition tho, I cannot get past a syrupy presence that I find annoying."
"One of my favorite US Lagers. Pours an amber with orange hue and short-lived off-white head. Nice malty and floral hop aroma. Mostly a trailing lace with some clinging residue. Lightly sweet caramel notes within a nice rounded malt body. Sharp citrusy bitterness and a light metallic edge. A hint of pears appears towards the end of the glass as the flavors meld and balance."
"It went down nice. The aftertaste was pleasent to the palet. a nice crisp lager."
"Overall, a good lager. If you're in the mood for a lager, give this one a try."
"This beer poured a very bright and clear amber orange color. Decent frothy white head. Wonderfully inviting and slightly flowery hop aroma. Nice malt presence. The beer is medium bodied and is a great tasting lager. Smooth and mellow and very flavorful. Perfect carbonation. Its a definite step up from a normal premium lager."
"Thanks Stegmakk for the bottle!"
"This is a true amber colored beer. Pours an average head that fades quickly, but provides excellent lacing. Smells of flowers and sugar. Good tasting lager. A little sweet, but enough other flavors in there, too. Somewhat thick in the mouth, but more drinkable than your average lager. A great standby beer."
"Well I bought a sampler without looking at the date and it's best by date is August 2002, however it is against my religion to toss a beer without at least trying it first. Pours a beautiful amber gold with a creamy white foaming head, this beer is forming nice even rings of lace looking quite beautiful in my stemmed Stella Artois glass. Aroma is a bit musky with some mild hops and a very mild hint of malt sweetness, with all things considered mainly the age of this beer not bad at all. The taste is where the age starts to hurt this beer it still has a nice grainy sweetness with some bittering hops thrown in, but overall just a little stale. What did I expect from a lager this old. I remind you that this beer is still a cut above most beers out there, just I will definitely have to resample due to the age of the product. Mouthfeel is still very carbonated with a nice nutty malt thickness to the finish. Overall I bet this beer is really drinkable, but I am going to update this review to find out for sure."
"Sparkling crystal bronze color - the carbonation bubbles can easily be observed. Although not overly malty for the style, this lager bordered on ale-like qualities. The hops were interesting - although not overly floral, they did lend a distinct aromatic quality, and the bittering aspect was almost secondary. Overall, a nicely crafted brew."
"A translucent deep amber to copper color on the pour, a prestigious bright white head, generous lace and a nice clean and crisp nose. Start is loaded with malt, somewhat sweet, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate, with the finish stinging in its acidity, the hops stout in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a great drinking beer, I Like It!"
"This lager had a dark amber appearance, with a nice fluffy head. Very attractive looking beer, complete with a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell was equally impressive, with clove and citrus elements here and there. The taste threw me of a bit, however. An indescribable tangy quality distracted me from the otherwise well-balanced brew. A hint of orange or citrus combined with a yeasty quality that didn't sit well with me. While the taste was definitely something different, I can't say that I enjoyed it immensely. The mouthfeel was rather mediocre, smooth overall, but with a somewhat grainy feel on the tongue. I've had better lagers, even from larger breweries. The Brooklyn Lager wasn't terrible, but it wouldn't be my choice among a variety from the same style."
"This beer was a real surprise to me. I wasn't expecting much from the single bottle I bought from a split pack, primarily because of the pricing. Surprise! This is a very good lager, but I believed it is misclassified as a pale lager. This seems much more to me Vienna style. The color is deep amber/copper with a very good goldish tan head that lasts reasonable well. The lacing is also very good. Mucho hops on the head aroma, more malt-like as the head dissipates. Great refreshing taste with more hops than expected. Creamy mouthfeel. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Drinkability - a wonderful lager. I almost do not believe this is a lager. yummy."
"One of the better micro breweries, Brooklyn has done a fine job with the various tasks they have attempted, but it is always nice to come back to an old stand by such as the Lager. This is so easy to drink. Lager was presented in a 20oz. glass and it was a rich mahogony color with a fine, white head with an interesting, thin, clingy lace. The smell was sharp with lemon and hop aromas. The interesting part about this beer is that it tastes much like a pale ale or bitter, with that distinct hop taste. It was crisp and refreshing though and not nearly as heavy tasting as a pale ale. This is a beer you can always count on and it is pretty easy to find to boot!"
"Had a great thick rocky and fluffy head that shrank in a few minutes leaving a merange around the rim of the glass. The color was a deep copper and very clear. Thea smell was full of hops and some maltyness as well. Texture was thinner than I had expected but still had a nice mouthfeel. Tastes reminded me very much of Sam Adams which I have had many time before this lager. Tastes was a mild sweet maltyness upfront followed by complex hop character in the end. Hops left a grapefruit and lingering aftertaste but was not overpowering. Good overall but I think I would stick to SA if I wanted this type of full flavored lager."
"light copper, hop oils form patches of head. Aroma was nice spicy hop. taste was a caramel flavor that did not integrate very well with the rest of the beer. There was a little lemon zest. The one nice surprise was the floral notes in the flavor of the hops. Easy drinking, but why would you buy one when SA boston lager is more easily found and tastes somewhat similar and much better? I suppose this beer is supposed to provide a step-up from tasteless lagers, which it does rather well i guess."
"As the bottle states, it's a golden-amber brew. Good sized white head with decent staying power. Leaves some patchy lace as it goes down. Clean, crisp aroma of floral hops and sweet grainy malt. As for the taste, again, it's very crisp and clean. Quite flavorful though. Hop oil and grainy malt make up most of the flavor profile. Has a nice pinpoint bitterness to it as well. Smooth and refreshing all the way through. Reminds me of Sam Adams Boston Lager, but a bit better. Great casual drinking beer. Thanks to francisweizen for this one!"
"These guys have proven that in an age of ""can you top this"" in the hop and alcohol contest, a good , solid beer can be enjoyed. Now that I have found a reliable supplier for this stuff my fridge will always have some on hand. Also a great beer to serve to the casual macro drinker who is turned off by the ""mega"" brews."
"Like all Brooklyn brews a great hoppy nose, floral hops (Hallertauer and Cascade). A slightly malty taste, but very much a barley malt as it has a tart fruity tone that finishes on a slightly acidic bitter. Reminiscent of nuts without being a truly nutty beer. opens to an even larger soft fruity-floral nose  quite nice due to dry-hopping. Very good lager bitterness in its balance amongst the flavors  not too strong, but definitively a major presence. A good brew that I like to have around as for (as an NY resident) its much better than anything else in its price range."
"A thanks goes out to Francisweizen for this bottle. In a nutshell, a good clean,crisp American pilsner. This one poured a sparkling deep golden color with a nice creamy head and lots of tiny rising bubbles. Nice German hop aroma (Saaz?), grassy and a touch herbal. It has a malty start that quickly vanishes to a light hop bitter finish, a nice dry and crisp beer that would go well on a hot day. It would also go well with pizza or burgers. Not fantastic but solid. Lager the way it should be made here."
"Was suprised at the great appearance of this one great golden color,wirh a great foamy head.Had freas mowed grass fruity amoma almost like a IPA.One of the hoppiest lagers I have had if not the most.Refreshing quaffer with some substance,I can see why alot of people give this brew good marks."
"Its firm head and rich color give Brooklyn's Lager and appetizing appearance. Its soft nose is followed by a dry, refreshing finish that begs for another sip. Brooklyn's standard beer is itself a standard for American Lagers. While better lagers exist, few exemplify the style better than Brooklyn does and is an essential component to an August cookout."
"An awesome clear gold color and a bright white head tops of this larger. A citrus/hoppy aroma is present, very clean. The taste is just as clean with a fine mixture of hops and malt. Nice mouth feel and very drinkable. Im starting to enjoy the beers of the Brooklyn Brewery. Cant wait to I find more!"
"High drinkability as the taste is mild and pleasant, combined with a low to moderate alcohol % makes this a beer you can drink all night."
"Pours a slightly chill hazed copper, with a thin but persistent head that leaves a little bit of lace. Aroma is malty... caramel and toasted malt, and a bit of spicy noble hops. Flavor is malty, beginning with some sweet caramel notes, moving to bread and some finishing spicy bitterness. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is somewhat rough, with a medium body. This is a very well done amber lager."
"This beer poured onto the glass a medium to dark gold color. The head was of a full consistency and the color of white. The aroma was a balance of malts and hops. The taste was exactly like the aroma, bitter hops and sweet malts balancing each other. This is a decent example of the style of beer that it represents."
"Clear golden in colour, fluffy white head. Good, smooth, with some prevalent hop flavours as well as malt sweetness. Finish is initially smooth, with some bitterness trailing at the very end. Good, but not great."
"The only down fall was the slight bitter hops a little to bitter for a lager but all and all a good beer easy to drink!"
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Honey-colored with with a minimal head. Dry hops flavor with a decent finish. Not on the same scale as the Black Chocolate Stout but decent nonetheless."
"Pours a nice golden colour with nice white head. Well carbonated and quite refreshing. Quite nice beer, on average, with nice appearance good taste but must be enjoyed really cold for maximum satisfaction"
"This is a pretty good bear.  I got it in a six pack in a variety case of Brooklyn Beers(A good purchase and one that I would suggest to all of you who are unfamiliar with this breweries excellent line of beers!-not that I am partial to it or anything, considering I am from brooklyn originally....)anyway this purs a darkish amber colour which is not that different from a boston lager.  It also smells like a boston lager, and features the same head IMO.  Basically this tases like boston lager as well, but with a bigger mouthfeel.  The only downside to this beer is the aftertaste, which is a little too harsh for me to handle(at least for this style...in a pale ale I look for a more hoppy harsh finish...)Either way a nice beer, and good to have in the fridge at all times."
"Pours a dark golden color, maybe amber. The head is a off-white color and very small but holds pretty well. On the nose the aroma is clean with a hint of malts. On the palate there is a smooth malty flavor, with a nice hop bite, woody, rich, and a nice sweetness to it. Seems like this would be a good fall back beer..."
"Pours pale, clear, and carbonated with a surprisingly short-lived head.  The beer has a decent hop aroma and terrific malt/hop balance.  Finish is a little sweet for a pilsener, but still very enjoyable.  Well made, no apparent flaws."
"Pours a deep golden color with a thick, frothy head that lasts a long time. Aroma of fresh hops. Well balanced malty to hopsmaybe just a bit hoppier than expected. Also has a touch of lemon. An excellent lager. I really enjoyed it."
"a great blend of malt and hops. this beer was just a good lager. it was very nice on the way down without overpowering carbonation. i will have it again soon. it is worth the time to get this beer"
"Clear amber body, with some carbonation. White fluffy head. Good, clean nose. Smells like... good beer.   Malt is first on the tongue, with hops right behind.  Good balance between. The New York Sam Adams (and both are contract brewed out of their hometowns). A beer that can be overlooked by those searching for the next outrageous IPA or imperial stout, but this is the one of the bedrock brews that can be used to convert the more willing Budmillercoors folks. Always good to have a few around. My prejudice: made with the old Schafer yeast strain. My dad always drank Schafer. So this is my link."
"This and SA's Boston Lager are my 2 fallbacks. This is just as sturdy and reliable, although surprisingly full for a standard lager. It ain't your run-of-the-mill watered-down American brew. Could easily be mistaken for a hoppy pale ale. Rich, woody, and complex. Goes great with all kinds of food, or a fine centerpiece when drinking is the only matter at hand. Can't go wrong with this one."
"A great everyday drinking beer.  It one of those ""must haves"" in the fridge. Very nice lager.  Goes will all kinds of food.  Keeps it's flavor until the last drop."
"an okay lager"
"Notes: Good drinking all around. This is a traditional lager, with all the characteristics one would expect from ""The Pre-Prohibition Beer"" as it states on the label."
