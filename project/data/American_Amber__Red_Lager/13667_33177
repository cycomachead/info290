The aroma is odd at first. There an earthy bread-like smell that reminds me of a basement. There is also a faint hops scent and a malty tone. The flavor is sweet with hints of honey, caramel, and wheat bread. A very mild sense of hops while in the mouth. It's slightly tart, has a light body and a clean dry finish.Â ","KMcG","May 20, 2011"

It tasted bitter and rather malty at first and finished with a nice biter-sweet hoppy flavor that stuck around on the taste buds for and average amount of time.

The nose brings forward a bit of bready malt plus a touch of toast. Some mild earthy hops there as well. The taste has a very pour showing--slight infection has set in and there is a bit of an acetic presence. Very unfortunate. Other than that, there's a mild cherry-skin presence along with some breadiness in the background. Slight bitterness in the finish, but the coming vinegar takes over.

The nose shows a character that makes the beer seem more like an east coast Amber Ale than a Vienna lager; although I suppose there isn't a world of difference between the two styles. Fairly subtle notes of medium to medium-high crystal malt. The palate does indeed carry the malt-forward character of a Vienna lager. German malt notes greet the palate, followed by a mild bitterness, and a clean slightly malty finish. Overall, the beer is not poorly made, but lacks any really differentiating character.

3.6,5.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A very drinkable beer. As I mentioned it's not overly complex, and the fairly low ABV makes it appealing as a session beer. Assertive compared to many lagers, but pretty tame overall.","DaveBlack","Oct 10, 2010"

There is some other aroma that I would say is almost akin to oregano, it was off putting. The palate is a bit of wheat flavor mixed with some sour citrus notes. The sour flavors somewhat ruin the malty goodness that should be there. The feel is a bit flat on the tongue, nothing too bad, but still not great. The beer is fairly drinkable.

The taste also has a lemony wheatiness to it, the coriander weaving its way through, and a somewhat blunt funky tartness cutting across it all.

It smells of diacetyl, caramel/toasted/nutty? malts, and some green/herbal hops. The flavor is similar, with a big malt backbone and leafy/green, piney/spicy, floral/perfumy hops that are almost raw, leaving a medium bitterness. I also detect a Simcoe-esque fruitiness, but the website tells me they used all noble hops: Perle, Hallertau, and Tettnang. The body is medium, with matching carbonation and a medium to long finish.
