What does golden amber mean, and why give it the black crown? It turns out the Budweiser on the can told me everything I needed to know. Looks and tastes like any other Bud product, a little sweeter than most. Not a bad beer if you're just drinking while hanging out, but the ABV is a little high for that. What this beer does very well is hide the somewhat high alcohol content, which could be trouble...if you're drinking it while hanging out.

I started out with a finger-and-a-half of foamy french vanilla-colored head and it slowly fizzled down to less than a pinky's worth. Color and clarity were both fabulous with a deep-amber like you might see prehistoric bugs encased in and the opportunity to see all that there was to see, which in this case was the other side of the glass, the other side of the room, et al. I saw where previous reviewers mentioned its smell and it was nice, to be sure. It had a lightly toasted smell, sweet, but not necessarily caramel. More toward coconut. Mouthfeel was soft, especially after all of the initial carbonation. The taste was toasty, bready, not really even all that sweet. Finish was semi-dry and refreshing. It really was not a bad effort, although not a "masterpiece". If they put it in a CAN, I would be willing to try it again, but otherwise, it is one among many of its style.","woodychandler","Jan 02, 2014"

I am surprised it has such low ratings. I have been drinking bud off and on for 15 years, and most of the time it tastes like piss water; but of course, after the first few regular buds, it does get better.. That aside :), this is a great beer. I was at the store and was considering other beers (micro brews) but saw Black Crown - hadn't seen it before. Got the 12 pack home, hoping it tasted a tad bit better than piss water... and it did. It tasted a lot better. Budweiser will never be known for being elegant, or taste like most micro brews, but this is the beer to get if you need something that tastes good on the first sip while keeping more money in your wallet/paypal acct /bitcoin acct/etc. :D The aftertaste, after consuming a taco and sipping on the beer isn't the greatest, but drinking this beer while eating is wonderful. I wrote this 3 beers in.","VinceJones","Dec 24, 2013"

While I will not call this beer a quality beer, I enjoyed them and was able to finish them before they got lukewarm. The beer is very average looking for a lager, all the typical signs of a lager, the aroma is slightly above par for a lager and it pours with just the right amount of head and lace. A bit over carbonated, but not to the point of rejection. Where this beer fails is the strong aftertaste it leaves in your mouth, kind of sour and pungent, but not the worst beer in the world.

Not bad, I suppose, and much, much more malty than their standard fare, even the short-lived American Ale of a few years back, if memory serves. It's just that, while malty is good, it just seems like the hops should be treated with the same respect, maybe?

3.38,23.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Budweiser Black Crown (2013) - So the story goes-- Bud challenged its 12 brewmasters to come up with a better Bud. 6 beers were made. Taste tests were done. This amber lager was the winner. And so even though I despise Bud in every way possible comes my eventual meeting with Bud's "best"... and it goes like this: Good head upon pour reduces to decent lacing. Highly active carbonation. Straw yellow in color. Decent body for a lager. High alcohol smell revealing its 6% ABV. Under notes of malt and hops. A little citrus. Light mouthfeel. Not bad. A little wet but there is a subtle crispness. Nose is slight hops. Little if any lager skunk. Mid-palate is roasted oats and smoked barely. That alcohol punch right in the back of the mouth as it makes its way to back palate. A little caramel (as promised albeit light in nature) and again some lemon citrus. Malt on the back palate. Slight pine hops. A little more citrus highlighting that. Crisp after taste. That notable Bud drinkablity is there. It's not as watery. Not as wussy fizzy. But arguably it is the Bud of mass produced wanna be micro brewed lagers. Think less hoppy Sam's Lager. More clean Third Shift with a higher ABV. This is a high alcohol beer that is very drinkable. It makes Triple X by Molson look raw and unrefined. But at the same time it is lacking. There is simply something missing. I could be lame and say passion, but I think it's more the taste. It tries to be everything to everyone. And its so inoffensive it almost is offensive. If I had to suggest a beer for the every man this would be it. There is no daring to it. No unknown waters. Nothing bad to be had. But if you are looking for unexpected-- this is not this. This is simply an amazingly drinkable high ABV lager with a nice beechwod Bud finish. Safe. Like a life jacket. Or US bonds. Or driving with Grandma. If that's not your thing-- well you too will be left staring going "I just though there would be more". 3.5 out of 5. Good.","digitalflood","Jul 21, 2013"

Aroma has some actual cereal grains going on with a touch of Beechwood or at least reminiscent of the regular Budweiser. This one kicks up the alcohol at 6% abv, and also invites a touch of fruitiness and mild caramel accents, earthy jumbled generic hop accents. Flavor wise it's a bit rough, each sip has an edge that I'm just not in favor of, light cereal grain sweetness with a dry finish with rough cooked vegetable notes and some woody bark like notes that don't add to the complexity but only fortify the reason why I drink craft beer pre-dominantly. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with aggressive carbonation, harsh finish I spoke about continues to effect the palate in a negative way. This is Budweiser's answer to Yuengling let's add some caramel coloring to a similar Budweiser recipe and compete directly with a brand they we now do a lot of distribution for. Overall impression is that I won't be picking up more of this, the plus side is that it's only 2 bucks for a 22 ounce bottle of it, and I believe pretty affordable in sixers, and twelve packs.","WVbeergeek","May 13, 2013"

Taste tends toward the sweeter end of the spectrum from start to finish, with toasty malts blending with sugariness on the front and mid-palates before a minerality emerges on the back to make the finish more crisp and memorable.

One might call Black Crown an ideal ham and cheese sandwich beer, perfect accompaniment to an impromptu lunch on the deck under a bright sun. It would also serve as an excellent apres-ski beer in front of a roaring fireplace with friends.","ACasualObserver","Feb 04, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises dried caramel, flowers, and a hint of artificial vanilla. The taste focuses on the inherent sweetness of things, adding in a touch of wheatiness for the sake of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slightly slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an okay beer, sorta reminiscent of Bud American Ale, but sweeter and less nuanced. Not bad, but nothing to make me wanna buy another one on purpose.","TMoney2591","Feb 01, 2013"

It's like giving a crappy car a fancy paint job. At its core, this tastes more or less like Budweiser. But thanks to marketing, poor unfortunate souls (and me) pay more money for this. At least Bud Light Platinum (BL NUMZ!) has the novelty of being a mainstream, light malt liquor. This is just a more expensive Budweiser.","angrybabboon","Feb 01, 2013"

There's noticeable touch of caramel and toffee over a bit of bread crust. The beer isn't slightly sweet, like a lot of clean macro lagers—especially the ambers. The aroma is too bland and empty, just a vague graininess. If I were you, I'd just go for a Yuengling. It's certainly better than Bud heavy, and is relatively clean in inoffensive.

The alcohol definitely hits you after one. This beer is good if you want to get hammered, but taste-wise it's like chewing up a cracker and instead of swallowing, letting the pieces dissolve in your mouth.
