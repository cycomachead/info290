"O-pretty solid lager that is easy drinking and has nice flavor"
""

"The malts are the big part of the taste too with a low nearly invisible bitterness balancing things out at the finish. Sweet throughout."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice tan head developed with good retention and lacing, Appearance was slightly hazy with a ruby / copper color. Aroma was mild with some malt notes. Taste had caramel and toffee notes with a smoky and slightly bitter finish. Medium mouth feel with a dry and mild / bitter aftertaste."

"It's decent, but has something odd about it and has almost a burnt tinge to it."

"O- Overall a good beer, not a great beer. It has strong points but one glaring week point which is the carbonation. I've had this beer a number of times and I'm always perplexed how it's a bit flat. I got my growler filled and brought it back because I thought I got a bad batch. The bartender poured it out, took a taste and said ""Tastes right to me."" He then filled up another growler and gave it to me, which I quickly took home...same thing, I just can't understand it."

"O: Really very drinkable."

"D - I really enjoyed this beer, not sure why it got a B, but it definitely deserves a higher mark; maybe this beer should only be tasted from a tap or growler, but its really good"
"O: The beer isnâ€™t overly difficult to drink, but could use more malts and hops to create stronger aromas and flavors."
"Interesting tasting Lager. Not a huge fan of Lager's anymore -- it's weird considering, Yuengling Lager and Miller Lite are the beers that got me into beer. Muddy Creek is certainly not horrible. I think this would be a good gateway for someone trying to get into beer, in general."
"Overall a very tasty and well balanced lager. Very quaffable."
"Goes down easy, but certainly a heavy lager than say a Yuengling. A little tougher drinking than other lagers, but worth it. Great lager."
"D: The hoppiness keeps this from being a session beer for me."
"Had a pint at the Hop Devil Grill in NYC for $6.50. It appeared clear light brown with a short off-white head. This beer immediately reminded me of Sam Adam's Boston Lager, but it's a bit lighter. There's a mix of herbal and citrus hop flavors while the malts bring a mild chocolate cookie taste. All in all, it's a pretty tasty session beer. I wouldn't mind having a few."
"D: I could see myself throwing back a few of these. Any more than 3 and you might get a bit full/bloated though."
"Don't drink and review."
"again i was impressed with this pale lager.. nice head retantion.. apprance was a nice darker yellow.. smell was pleasing.. and taste was hoppy and smooth.. i got to say this is a good lager.. i enjoyed every sip.. great brew when you sit dow nat the bar try this first and you will be pleased"
"D - decent overall, could work as a session beer. Me, I'll pass till they change the hops effect."
"D: I could definitely drink back to back to back beers if only the beer was a little more desirable."
"This beer was definately drinkable and I wouldn't mind pouring a second glass for myself."
"This poured a very dark brown out of my growler; ironically enough, like a muddy creek! It had a small white head with fast retention and decent lacing, nothing too overwhelming. The smell was very malty and earthy, almost like old beer. While this may seem unappetizing, it had me intrigued since I respect and admire the reputation adn brewing style of this brewery. The taste did not disappoint; again, an earthy, ""muddy"" taste was very evident. The mouthfeel was not typical of this brewery, which kind of caught me by surprise. It was alittle thinner than what I've been accustomed too from Defiant. Overall, a nice and smooth, easy going beer that's easy to drink."
"I received a corked and caged bottle from a trade with a ratebeerian. This thing had a lot of carbonation! The head took a while to settle down. The color was a ruddy brown. The smell was stinky, like a muddy creek. The taste was a standard lager taste to me. Decent beer but i couldn't get past the smell."
