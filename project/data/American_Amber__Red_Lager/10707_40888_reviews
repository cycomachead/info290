"Solid non-offensive brew that is very affordable. There is cheaper stuff out there that is similar (Busch Signature Copper Lager). Overall I would recommend it."

"Notes: Clear, brown body beneath a thin, short-lived head of off-white. Lacing is average. Aroma expresses dark caramelish malt with a hint of nuttiness and some background hops. The flavor follows suit, and it's basically a straightforward lager with a solid caramel component. Light-medium in body and gently crisp. Moderate bitterness. It finishes fairly short and dry. Given the price it's hard to argue against it as a fall-back beer, at least for one or two while watching a game or cooking dinner... times when you don't want to focus on your beer, when you just want something refreshing at hand. This is a beer I'd buy for a backyard BBQ just so that the newbie beer drinkers can try something other than Yuengling Traditional."
"Solid beer, love Trader Joe's"
"Caramel malt aroma, same in flavor pretty much. Decent head with some lacing; slight murky amber body. Good start with crystal malt and caramel but doesn`t hold my interest. Still, for the price point, way better than a bland BMC."
"Great for an inexpensive craft-ish lager.  Amber color is pretty, nice to drink out of a glass.  Not too bad of an aftertaste for a lager, due to richer caramel notes.  Not to sweet, nice smell."

"Leftover from a get together, I was expecting a possible drain pour, but it's really pretty good. Overall some pretty good character and decent flavor.  Carmamel upfront with a whisper of hops to being it back to Earth.  Compares very well against Dos Equis dark and Modelo.  I guess you never really know."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark mahogany amber with a thin ivory head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with hints of molasses and biscuit. Flavor is dark sweet malt, hints of nuts and molasses, light grassy hop finish. Light bodied with good carbonation. As expected, a lightly flavored dark lager, flavors are pleasant and malty, but subdued. Nothing to seek out, but a decent cheap dark lager as presented."

"O: Not bad but not anything special - better than some of the others from Trader Joe's and enjoyable, especially for the price."

"Overall: This is pretty clearly Trader Joe's Dos Equis Amber analogue, and it's much better. I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer this to dumb Dos Equis."

"Drinkability: If you like caramel, malty beers, this is a good session ale. Great price, great flavor. Best beer I've ever had from Mexico. Better than Modelo or 2X amber. Can some one share a better beer from Mexico?"

"Overall, nothing spectacular. Good average session beer. Price is good."

"From a mixed six from the Tallahassee Trader Joe's."
""
"Overall- I didn't really expect much and didn't get much. I picked it up as a sample of the style but it seems to be a pretty poor example. The supposed heavy malt bill is nonexistent."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Much better than the Trader Jose Lager. This is Trader Joe’s affordable version of a dark Mexican beer. If you like Modelo Negra and the like, give this a try."

"Overall Drinkability: A good and very different red lager."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and watery smooth, with very light carbonation, a medium almost chewy body and a grainy sweet finish. Middle of the road in every aspect; not bad, not great, just there and overall average."
"I poured this beer expecting bad. At first taste I thought it was. It also smelled sour which almost ruined my sampling. Dark pour with a tan head that was nice at first. Very creamy. The beer was a bit sweet tasting to me but then leveled out. I will try again but the beer was nothing really special."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was pretty typical, medium and clean, with good carbonation. Drinkability was OK, not special, not terrible. Overall, just kind of bland, Meh-ish brew. At $6 a sixer you could grab one. Or not. Whatever."
""
""
""
""
"O- Ok for a cheap beer."
"single finger head with little retention but nice lacing on a straight amber clear body. aroma is very sweet, mostly malt and grain with sweet corn. flavor is mostly malt but it is a little flat. smooth, simple and drinkable but not very memorable. medium body and light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark crimson brown with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt and some nutty and slight metallic aromas. Taste is of dark malt and some nutty flavors. A slight metallic flavor shows up on the aftertaste but it's not too strong. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer taste wise but nothing all that exciting."
"O: This isnt bad actually. It has a porter or brown ale feel, with a ale like mouthfeel. I wouldnt go as far as to say this is abover average, but i'd recommend."

"Poured this American Amber ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy light brown color, produced a creamy off white head, thick, good retention, leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of subtle amounts of roasted grain and caramel. The taste is light in body, thin, watery. Toasted grain, caramel come through. Easy to drink- Overall boring beer- Disappointed with the entire trader jose line. On to the next beer! Prost!"
"Dr: Drinkable but boring. I wouldn't have it again. It's alright, but largely forgettable."
""
"O: A very good beer for the price. Nice flavour, no complexity, but an enjoyable effort."
" light and surprisingly hoppy with a nice bit of grain pushed up from the bottom. The blend was nice and light and had a good bright aroma. Some light fruit in the back as well.a good amount of floral hops sitting in the finish. The initial flavor I picked up was that of a nice cereal grain with a touch of a light grass mixed in. This rolled into a nice light fruit with a touch of a pine like finish to it. It was a nice bitter finish and a surprisingly good hop profile."
"Clear and dark brown color and an off white head. Smell reminds me of some chocolate and light coffee. Nequick like. LIght hop presence as the malt dominates with chocolate drink mix like flavor. The mouth feel is medium and well carbonated. I might drink this again."
""
"T: It's definitely nothing mind-blowing, but it's not altogether awful either. Taste is cereal grains, sweet malts, caramel and hazelnut with a hint of marzipan as well."
"This was an American Amber? Could have fooled me. It pours dark, almost coffee black. Maybe a hint of red if you hold it up to the sun. I really liked the color, especially since it didn't taste as heavy or as dark as it looked. You can taste the malt, a little sweetness. It's a very bold lager."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 06/17/11. So it's about a month after that, no big deal. The single bottle was only a buck from Trader Joe's so I don't feel bad about buying it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear brown/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is bready and caramel malt, nuts and some toffee. The taste is the same as the aroma, it tastes like bready and caramel malt, nuts and toffee. Finish is mostly sweet with some bitterness noticable too. Even after its best before date it's still a pretty decent brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate/high carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. For the price it's not a bad beer, it's better than I expected it to be. I can't complain for $1 a bottle. I'd buy it again at that price!"
"6 pack bottles from Trader Joes in S.Salem. $5.49 Dark amber/brown beer with a really good looking tight ,thick head..light tan in colour. Simple aroma..bready,some caramel..a little nutty. Taste again pretty simple..slightly caramel/toffee, some niuttiness..walnuts maybe small amount of hop in the end. Ok mouthfeel..not to bad for style..nice slightly bitter after taste. I enjoyed this..a nice simple dark lager"
"Overall: I'm gonna be totally honest right now and say this might be the best .90 cents I have ever spent but it the beer cost $1.99 I would not buy it"
"This beer poured out as a clear looking brown color. It's got a fizzy off white head on it. The smell of the beer has a lager aroma mixed with some roasted nuts and a hint of hops. The taste of the some lager flavors at first that fade into some decent nutty flavors in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, It's got a decent carbonation to it. Overall it's an average brew really, but has a drinkablity that made this a bit more enjoyable. I wouldn't hunt this one down or go out of my way to get this either."
"Even for a cheap (imported from Mexico!) beer this isn't very good. Another case where the style isn't really right. Should be Light Lager with caramel color added."
"Trader José Dark Lager is a very clear, coppery brown beer with a thin, bubbly, off white head that fades to a film and leaves nice lacing. It has a roasty, toasty aroma that's pretty chocolatey. It's light bodied and a bit watery. It's pretty smooth and the finish is pretty dry. The mellow flavor is chocolatey with a little green bitterness at the finish. It's smooth and mellow."
"Clear dark chestnut color with a small, fluffy off-white head. Decent sheets of lace left on the glass. Sweet caramel malt, nuts, and earthy notes in the nose. Dark roasted caramel, cocoa, and a hint of leafy hop bitterness. Tastes a little too sweet and cheap...but it is cheap. Light bodied and fairly drinkable. As with most lagers like this, it's much better cold, so don't let it sit around too long. Suitable for a summer cookout..."
"You'd think ""Trader"" would be en español too, right? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear dark sunset amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises toffee, dark greens, and light buttery biscuits. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a decidedly light addition of caramel. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little lager, nothing much to distinguish it from everything else, but easy to drink and generally enjoyable enough for a nice-and-easy quaff."
"I'm guessing that it's got a 5% ABV."
"D: Fairly crisp and refreshing, but still has a cheap beer vibe."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, but not very memorable. But at this price...$ 5.99 a sixer...it scores a few points as a viable session beer over a BMC choice."
"Mouthfeel - thin but smooth."
"Pours a clear brown with a small, short-lived head. Aromas are burnt sugar and toasted malts but little else. Toasted malts and tons of nuttiness on the palate make it actually sorta tasty. It lacks any meaningful sort of balance from hops but it's surprisingly good, despite its lack of depth."
"Drinkability could be worse. Some nice flavor going on, though a couple of off flavor also make things a bit weird. Not a bad beer though."
"D: Pretty low ABV, only a buck a beer, pretty good flavors what is not to like here.... Worth a shot. Nice summer time brew that is a little different."
"Drinkability: well, it's not fantastic but it's nice to drink. It's satisfying. Can't say I would ever go out of my way to buy it again, but not saying I would never buy it again. I actually probably will - mostly for the price. But if you want a mediocre dark lager for a cheap deal this would probably be it."
"Drinkability is also good, and is this beers strong suit. Easy to drink, refreshing, and with enough going on to make this kind of interesting as well."
"It pours a nice maroon brown, with a small head that recedes and doesn't lace much. The smell is light and coppery, as is the taste. It's very palatable but nothing really stands out about it. There's a nice caramel apple tone but it becomes a bit too sharp to be a highlight. It rests smoothly in the mouth and goes down easily, which makes it a nice choice for the price. A well-crafted value beer. Have one after work with a hastily prepared steak."
"Poured clear brown color with a large frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate sweet malty aroma. Medium body with a thin texture and soft carbonation. Light sweet flavor with soft sweet finish of short to medium duration. Worth trying agian."
"M/D - Pretty drinkable brew, another good one from Trader Joe's, a light bodied brew, nice and smooth with a good blend of malts and caramel, I recommend this brew and would get it again"
" ~ This is a brew that would go down well while hangin' on the boat or while socializing at a picnic."
"Much like many of these Trader Joe's beers, they are just a fantastic value. You won't find your socks blown across the room, but you will be amazed you only paid a dollar for it."
"This beer is bad but at the same time it really doesn't stand up to a majority of the west coast small and micro beers, but at the same time it's a cheaper beer and Trader Joe's seems to go through a lot of their product."
"Very roasty on the nose with notes of caramel and rot. Pretty dark brown with small lacey head. The taste is very maltcentric, sweet but roasty malt, very little hops seem present in bittering or flavor dept. I would say style wise this is more akin to a Euro Dark Lager. Many dark Eastern European lagers I've tasted were very similar to this - to its credit though this beer does have a richer and more dynamic taste than most of those beers. It probably owes this to higher quality ingredients and freshness. Not my favorite style of beer, but not bad for $.90 I paid for it as a single at Trader Joe's."
"The beer pours a clear brown color with a white head. The aroma is malty with a lot of biscuit and bready malts. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of lighter malts. No real hop presence. High carbonation and low-medium mouthfeel. Pretty basic lager here, nothing special, but not terrible."
"Drinkability: Average."
"Flavor follows the nose with a subtle caramel presence and a hint of nuttiness/toasted grain on the finish. Otherwise offers a light brown ale sense. Nice smooth feel, unoffensive yet unobtrusive. Decent drinkability and almost ale-like."
"One bottle of a mixed sixer I received from my parents for my 26th birthday."
"There is a lingering sweetness reminiscent of a malt liquor, but the beer has a refreshing level of bitterness. This is a decently cheap beer that you could drink a good deal of in a sitting if desired."
"Drinkability- Kinda impressed with this one. One of the better tasting red lagers I have had recently."
"Overall a decent lager with a surprising amount of flavor."
"Drinkability: A Negra Modelo clone, and a much cheaper one at that. I have no side-by-side comparison, but this is refreshing enough, and light but balanced with flavor. For $6 a 6-pack, a darker brew like this ain't too bad in the summer."
"Taste: There is a slight toasted bitterness initially that changes into a nice sweet malted flavor."
"Drinkability: not bad. i would buy this over its ""clone"" negra modelo."
"A Trader Joe's six pack (with Tecate listed on the bottle as the brewing company, interesting). Billed as a ""Negra Modelo"" clone of sorts it is a little light in body and mouthfeel. A Vienna lager it may be but not one that really satisfies the pallette and makes me want numerous bottles. Malty, slight caramel, and a hint of sulfur."
"Other comments: Negra Modelo is one of my favorite beers from ""South of the Border"". This cheaper version from TJ's isn't too bad of a clone."
"Despite all my negative words about this beer, it wasn't all that bad. It's just that there wasn't much to it. You know what? I would rather drink this over a certain famous flavorless clear bottled Mexican beer. If this beer has one really good quality to it, it's the fact that this beer is cheap as hell. I only paid a dollar plus tax for this beer. If you got a pocket full of change you want to get rid of, then think about getting a single or two of this beer."
"This is obviously a Negro Modelo clone, and it tastes pretty much like you'd expect. Taste is malty with a slight hint of some cooked vegetable flavor. I know its sacrilege around here, but ice cold with a lime, this one could hit the spot with some spicy mexican food. Nothing too exciting, but for a cheap grocery store beer I enjoyed it."
"Pours a dark but clear brown with a good thick head and decent retention. Lacing is about average (1/4 inch - 1/2 inch). Smells of sweet malts and another sweet unknown sweet entity. Fits the style. Tastes of a strong lager with lots of sweet malt. Very smooth with little aftertaste; low carbonation. Overall a very easy drinking beer with a smooth, sweet taste that's not too strong. This is a good dark/amber lager. Overall, I'd definitely drink this again, especially based on the cheap price. Also, this is much better than its Trader Jose counterpart (Premium Lager)."
"Not a bad beer but not much to talk about. The price is certainly right - $1 a bottle at Trader Joe's."
"Drinkabilty: Okay overall, kind of a mix of highs and lows. The appearance is a positive, with nice lacing and a good color. The carbonation bite is way to high and detracts significantly form the flavor. The body is very nice. Maybe a beer to make certain you use a harsh pour."
"D - Refreshing enough and not bad tasting, but there needs to be more in there."
"Another private label Mexican style beer from Trader Joe's - this one, however, is much better than the Mexican lager. This one is more in line with Negra Modelo or Dos Equis Amber, thereby making the flavor profile less dependent on corn and more on caramel malts. From the clear amber hue with the nice tan head to the sweet aroma, this is a solid manifestation of the style. The flavor is sweet up front but is balanced nicely by the citrus like finish. Nothing objectionable here - would pair well with any of the frozen burritos at Trader Joe's. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Not altogether terrible and priced, if not for glory, then at the very least for an outdoor, sunnytime gathering."
"Overall: a great simple beer to go with food. would also be great for beer novices. cheap too!"
"Drinkability> I'm going to have to start sneaking these beers into El Farrolito and Papalote because I prefer this to my standby negra modelo."
"Poured a dark brown with a thick caramel head that dissipated pretty quickly. It reminded me of a slightly darker Killians. Pretty malty but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely a pretty good ""regular"" beer, especially for the price. It's my first Trader Joe's brew of all styles so I'm interested in how they did with the other ones."
"I know it says its from Mexico so it must be crap, but I am quite surprised by this brew. I think it gives Negro Modelo a run for its money and if it isn't, it sure does a good job of faking the aromas and flavors of an all malt beer (well minus the caramel coloring). While this is certainly not earth shattering, it actually has a better mix of flavors and balance than many of the usual Trader Joe's label beers. At the price they sell this at it is almost a go to BBQ / grill beer for those hot Summer afternoons & evenings."
"For a buck apiece, there's worse..."
"D'ability - A smooth and unexpectedly malty brew. Pretty good stuff for the low TJ price."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but too thin. There is some legitimate chocolate malt flavor here but it would be much cooler if the texture had the balls to stand behind it. Reasonable smoothness and drinkability but hardly the most interesting or flavorful thing I've drank...tonight."
