4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 6/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers, Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, floral, pine, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, peach, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, mango, peach, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice IPL style! All around good balance and complexity of hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 26, 2013"

Amber / red character shows itself more in the flavor. Hop forward with a supporting malt body. Sufficient hop bitterness, especially in the finish. Solid.","Huhzubendah","Sep 12, 2013"

3.79,-1.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average hoppy Red Lager, there's no doubt that this beer was heavily hopped and it really comes out in the flavor even a little too much so. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest and the bitterness really lingered, the taste did hold my attention, but I think one would be enough for me since I think the bitterness would start to wear on me after more than one. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good, balanced and the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, it wasn't as smooth as I would like and I think if the lingering bitterness was cut down a little it would really help the drinkability. I would buy this beer again and I think it's a nice addition to Short's new variety pack. I recommend this to anyone who likes really hoppy and really bitter bears. All in all i was happy with this beer, it was a little more intense than I thought it would be but I still thought it was pretty enjoyable, it just wasn't the most drinkable. Thanks for releasing this beer Short's, I think it can hold it's own and could be released by it's self, nice work guys this was a pretty solid beer.","StoutHunter","Aug 27, 2013"

3.85,0.3,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Another hoppy lager from Shorts and basically another winner in my book. Delicate hands are needed when combining lots of hops and any types of malts darker than pilsner or pale, but Shorts seems to know what they're doing. I don't like this quite as much as a few of their other hoppy lagers, but it's still a solid choice. I wonder if it will ever see distribution.","tectactoe","0"
