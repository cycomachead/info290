The beer smell is a yeasty and caramel malty smell with a bit of alcohol on the nose. The hops are a slight note but still make an appearance. The beer has a much stronger hop presence than in the smell. The hop taste is balanced by the malt taste. Similar to the smell, the malts primarily consist of a sweet and light caramel taste. Additionally, the beer has a slight mineral taste as well as a bit of alcohol. The feel is crisp and lean with biting carbonation.

The nose comprises a decent bit o' caramel, countered by a stark bit o' hoppiness, mostly sharp pine and slightly less sharp ruby red grapefruit. The taste is identical. 'Nuff said. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a decent brew, highly drinkable, not all that complicated. Now we've got about 49 more Native brews to craft...","TMoney2591","Aug 09, 2010"
2.49,-31.4,3.5,2,2,3,3.5,"A perfectly fine American style lager gussied-up with a little roasted malt for color, is my guess. Anyone expecting the likes of a Märzen or Vienna lager will be dissapointed.","SassyBootblack","Jul 26, 2010"
3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is really rather well done. Not earth shattering by any means, but then it's an amber lager. It isn't supposed to redefine craft beer. As it is, it's a good beer worth trying. Nice to see the big boys know how to do good beers too, eh?","jokelahoma","Jul 13, 2010"
4.18,15.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tastes wonderful. Light malt, strong hop flavor, and clean hop bitter that is crisp at the end like you get in a good czech pils. Each of these dimensions is balanced with the others, though the carbonation makes too strong of an acrid sting (so, swirl the beer to address that concern). Malt is mostly bready sweet with a hint of light-colored caramel. Hop flavor is lemony, earthy, grapefruit pithy, and a light hint of basil sweet. The pith works quite well with the clean hop bitter. By the end of the glass, the beer is coming across as quite hoppy bitter, almost to the point of minerally. I wonder if the brewer added calcium carbonate during the mash. The aftertaste sees a reappearance of the malt sweet. Md light body and very drinkable (keep in mind that I'm quite a hop-head).","mentor","Jun 14, 2010"
3.73,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability was very good. Clean beer, well balanced. Good summer session beer.","riored4v","Jun 04, 2010"
3.9,7.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D: Easily drinkable with all the well-blended balance of a good lager. Light abv helps too.","Haybeerman","May 14, 2010"
3.6,-0.8,3,3,4,3,4,"On tap at Old Chicago Westy. Color was somewhat of an amber (amberish if that's a word); a slight floral aroma. Hoppier than most Coors' products--very surprised. Taste was slightly sweet and quite quaffable. A pleasant surprise. Doubtful I'd buy a sixer of it but if I'm ""forced"" to choose amongst a few BMC offerings, I'd look for this one.","Schmittymack","May 07, 2010"
3.8,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Finally found this one in the mix six cooler so I figured I'd give it a try. Not at all what I was expecting. Poured a nice copper-amber color, with a bit of ecru foam. Aromas of sweet malt and caramel. Nothing too overwhelming on the palate, but a very nice malty body, with just a hint of spicy hops. A very pleasant surprise.","emmasdad","May 02, 2010"
3.99,9.9,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"A good lager with some hops presence that has a good malt backbone that makes me think of a marzen. Price point is about right. I like this better than SA Noble Pils and Boston Lager which I think it competes with. Definitely worth a try.","SteelieB","Apr 21, 2010"
4.08,12.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Bottom line, I wanted to hate it, and I can't find much fault with it. Kind of reminds me of Boston Lager. Kind of octoberfesty as well. All and all, damn solid brew.","BlackHoleBrew42","Apr 10, 2010"
3.83,5.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Another interesting note. This beer is made with all Colorado ingredients from Monte Vista barley to hops from near Montrose. On tap I've found this brew to be a good go-to in the summer. Good stuff from Coors? Yes!","Domingo","Apr 05, 2010"
