"Love the beer. The problem comes with the inconsistancy in the flavor."

"An okay beer, I guess. The taste is the main downfall. I think it's past it's prime. The aroma is holding up pretty well, but the tasty is pretty nondescript. An easy drinker."

"I am drinking it out of A Samuel Smith pint glass. It has nice amber color. Very little carbonation and no lacing....Which I don't mind cause I hate scrubbing my glass. It has a bit of a skunked smell with just a hint of that fermented smell a Belgian would have. It tastes like almost nothing...I don't know how to describe this but it tastes almost like any old amber then nothing...not after taste at all. You know how if you drink diet coke the taste goes away so you drink more then no taste so more and then more until you know it the bottle is gone? I need another beer..."

"D - It is drinkable based on a certain very nice aspect of the flavor. It is not a complete or tremendously inspiring offering, but it has a serviceable quality (or two)."

"O- There is something wrong with this beer. I can't put my finger on it, maybe an infection, maybe just a combination of an old poorly made beer with some DMS, either way this is down there with some of the least enjoyable ones I've had. This was a dumper."

"This is a nice, easy to drink beer. the flavor is a bit unbalanced between malty and hoppy, bitter and sweet. It's also a bit overcarbonated. It's not bad, but at this time of year I'm looking for a more balanced Marzen."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a light amber with a large white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of light grain, not much else. Tastes of roasted grain that has a great body for this beer and is sweet, but not overly so. Beer seems a tad overcarbonated, but this light bodied beer still goes down really smooth. Overall, a pretty good beer."
"Overall: I'm really disappointed with this one. Starr Hill is a sentimental favorite since it's fairly local but this one just isn't that good. I think they would have been better off brewing a more traditional Marzen/Oktoberfest style rather than a kind of generic amber lager."
"Overall – A very easy to drink beer. While not super flavorful and rather light, it is a great choice for a nice session brew."

"This would be a great step-up for a bud drinker who wanted to head towards a mild pale ale. I would call this halfway between the two."
"O: The more beers that I have from Starr Hill the less I think of them as a brewery. There is nothing especially exceptional about this beer, the sticky mouthfeel makes it not particularly drinkable and the taste of cereal grains is reminiscent of a mass produced lager. It's not necessarily a bad beer, but neither the taste or smell stand out as anything special."
""
"DRINKABILITY: Well, an Oktoberfest should be repeatable for a good part of the day, right. I could do that but other than that, there's not all that much to recommend it. The price is okay but there are equally worthy beers of the same style that are less expensive. I doubt that I'd buy this again."
"D: Its very drinkable, unfortunately it's just not very good."

"Has some mild sweetness and hint of bready, crackery malt. There's actually some light fruitness here, almost bordering on an off, sourish character. Floral hoppiness does make an appearance in the finish, and the aftertaste does suggest that this is, indeed, a Märzen. In the big scheme, though, this falls short of being even a decent Fest-type bier. It's still drinkable, but not what I was expecting. Thnx, Bro!"

"O: Not my favorite marzen. Just kind of misses the mark on this one. A little less sweetness and a stronger malt presence is what this brew needs."
"For Starr Hills sake, I'm hoping I just had a bad bottle."
"O: Goodish beer, mediocre compared to some of Starr Hill's other offerings. *Very* drinkable. Not recommended, but I'd have another."
"Once again a thanks to woodychandler for another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts. Taste is also malty, refreshing, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable brew."
"O- fairly smooth and a drinkable beer. I might have another but i doubt i will purchase a sixer or more."
"The Crack & Glug was music to mine ears and produced two tawny fingers of dense, bubbling head with good retention. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet, much more so than Yuengling Lager, to which a previous reviewer compared it. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy and with a pleasant melange of flavors on the tongue, ranging from an initial sugary sweetness to an herbal mintiness and back again. Finish was more sweet than anything else and I think that the constant onslaught of malt would be too much for me to CANsider inclusion in my cooler."
"Well I have to say I was expecting better from this Starr Hill offering but then lagers are harder to dial in than the average ale. They have a way to go with this Fest beer and I hope they are in the process of tweaking it."
"Would I buy more of it? - not much of an option where I am. This is a pretty easy drinking lager and if it was more available I could definitely see myself putting some on ice once in awhile."
"I expected this beer to be much better than it is. If packaging was a scoring category I would have given this beer at least one high mark. It is over priced for what you get. I think I would have rated it higher if it was priced like it tastes. I'd pick a can of Yuengling over this beer and would compare them fairly equally. It is not bad just made to make you think it's a craft micro brew and it's a boring lager."
"Purchase before Aug. 2011 notched in the label. Pours a nice golden to amber in color with good carbonation. Thinnish white head that shrinks quickly but leaves some lacing on the surface. A pleasant caramel aroma with some warm, bready malt and a pretty good balance of citrus and floral hops. Grainy malt flavor with a bit of caramel sweetness. Some floral hops but this beer is more oriented towards the malt. Crisp mouthfeel and light body."
"D: A lackluster fall seasonal from a normally above average brewery. This is lightly flavored and too thin/astringent to be very enjoyable. You won't miss much by avoiding this one, although it's far from bad."
"D - It is drinkable based on a certain very nice aspect of the flavor. It is not a complete or tremendously inspiring offering, but it has a serviceable quality (or two)."
"Drinkability: A below-average Oktoberfest. With Starr Hill being a fairly local brewery for me, I was hoping for more from this beer. This really isn't that good. I'll have to hold off on getting more of these until next year to see if it gets any better. Pity..."
"This one pours a hazy light orange color with a fast fading half finger of ecru foam. The smell is a bit sour as if any hops that were in this beer had already gone wrong. I think it may be the burnt biscuit flavor in there. There are hints of orange zest fronting the slight malt aroma. The flavor is of orange zest and not a fresh one at that. The maltiness that I expect to see in an Oktoberfest is totally not here until the aftertaste. This isn't the worst Oktoberfest, but it sure as hell isn't the best. The mouthfeel and drinkability do it some justice but overall I'd go elsewhere for my Fest beers."
"This is the last sixer I bought before leaving the NoVa area. It pours a mostly clear pale apricot topped by about a half-finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises caramel, peanuts, buttercream, and a touch of orange. The taste seems to initially lean in the direction of an increased amount of orange, but this then dovetails into a heavy dose of buttery biscuit with a generous amount of sweetness tossed on top. What hurts this thing is that the orange doesn't really leave once the maltiness enters; what results is, in effect, a cupcake whose stump is an orange slice. Honestly, it would be fine if this were done in phases, but together it just doesn't seem right. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel. Oddly enough, despite the slightly awkward flavors, this thing spitefully retains a decent amount of drinkability. It may not be the best O-Fest I've had, but it's certainly not the worst, either."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability isn't good, it was close to a drain pour. I thought it might be old but the bottle has a best by date 5 months from now so it must be pretty fresh. Something wasn't right at all with it though. The flavors were not what I expect for the style at all."
"D= we were saddened only that we couldn't stay longer to have a few more, went great with Hard Times Cafe's chili dishes and burgers & fries, even the large salad."
"D: Can't quite call this an Oktoberfest, but it's refreshing nonetheless."
"The beer pours a honey amber color with fairly good head retention and minimal lacing. The nose is lightly malty with a hint of ginger and pumpkin bread. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose pretty closely in this one dimensional, albeit inoffensive, lightly sweet beer. The flavors drop off pretty quickly in the finish, and the beer is almost watery at the end. Drinkability is OK, though a bit more flavor would be appreciated. Mehhh...."
"D - I could drink more, I just have other stuff I'd rather drink right now."
"Not up to the competition I tasted this with. (Victory Fest; Dogtoberfest; Dominion Fest)"
"I'd drink it again, although I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."
"D: Hmmm. Seems like this beer wasn't totally thought through. Thanks Jeff :)"
"Its getting to the end of the O-fest beer season so I figured I'd grab this one today.Poured a clear lighter shade of bronze with a nice one finger tight white head that was gone pretty quickly.Aromas of caramel/vanilla,and toasted grain mainly.A light sharp mouthfeel was kind of annoying,flaovrs were really mild with some residual caramel sweetness and that toasted grain again,the flavors were very light.A pretty average beer,not one to seek out."
"D: Hardly a 'carnival': really didn't have much fun with any part this beer. Lackluster in most every category, it's not even worth a try. My sincere hope is that the 'Purchase Before FEB' was actually for 2009, not 2010, which would explain some things - though I know my buddy Metalmonk just picked this up weeks ago and I received earlier this week. Many thanks for the try, Jeff, but I'll pass next time...but thanks for the pre-written apologies below! :)"
"[Threw a couple of these into a couple different trade boxes as a ""bonus"" the other day...they're already on the way! Good thing I've already traded with the recipients a few other times--they'll forgive me I hope--but guys: I AM SORRY.]"
"The feel is crisp and moderately carbonated. Decent body. It has some weak points, but the flavor is right where it needs to be. Nice filling bready taste, some mild hop bitterness in the middle, but it finishes with a touch of caramel and sweet malty goodness. There's a slight sour note on the back end, but it's not offensive in any way. I didn't have the highest expectations for this, but this was better than I thought. A nice go-to for the fall."
"It's not too bad to drink and you could probably drink many of these, but I'm not sure you'd want to."
"Overall this was not a very good beer and one I won't revisit again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is okay. It tastes fine..but not excellent. Try it out. Not the best marzen, but I could have another one."
"D - Moderate to high. I prefer a more flavorful Octoberfest, but this one could be had over and over again."
"Moderate half finger head, eggshell white, larger bubbles interspersed throughout the foam, no real lacing, dissolves down swiftly. Light orange-brown in hue, while somewhat cloudy turns to a washed out zinc hue around the rims. Quiet nose of apricot/peach pits and skin, if you had to choose you'd say it's more malty than hoppy but really it's a wash, some mocha and bread, more than the nondescript white citrus and dried lawn grass notes, just not much going on. Light to medium-bodied, possesses a big carbonated swirl in the mouth, a handy way of disguising the fact that there's not much here either. Some bitters and brine, sun dried lemon peels and more dried out grass. The malts are like an aftershadow, you can just make out the general contour but no depth. In fact, watery would be one way of putting it. Even after focusing harder on each successive sip, it is not any easier to find a flavor to describe. Empty finish."
"Festie pours a beautiful clear amber with a medium sized white head with decent retention. Lot of bubble action visible. Smells of sweet malts, toffee. Tastes good but nothing in particular stands out except biscuity malts. To be honest it's a bit bland for Oktoberfest but it's medium body is perfectly carbonated; definitely drinkable."
"Good all around beer and just what I'm looking for in this style. I could drink it all day."
"D: To me this is another very nice beer from Starr Hill.... a good Fall follow up to their Summer of LOVE... Will be buying more very soon..."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough for the style. Drinkability is pretty good if you are looking for a nice crisp, malty beer. I wouldn't turn down a pitcher of this stuff, but wouldn't go looking for it as an Oktoberfest beer either."
"Drinkability: A bit of a disappointment from Starr Hill. It's not that this is an undrinkable beer, it's just really, really average beer, and definitely won't be a go-to Marzen for me, despite my overwhelming obsession w/ local drinking. Shame."
"D: Not Starr Hill's best offering, but not a terrible take on a marzen-style lager."
