The nose is faint, comprising wheat, light caramel, and grass (as far as I can tell). The taste is a combination of fruity sweetness (mostly orange, but with a bit of white grape and pineapple syrup) and spicy grain (like pepper- and cardamom-laced wheat). A fakely sweet (think candy-style sugary here) twang hangs over the finish. The body is a very light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I can't say I enjoyed this beer, but I didn't hate it, either. The smell is almost nonexistent, the flavor combination is sorta confusing, and the body is too light and fizzy to really be enjoyable. That said, not much is actually offensive about this beer.

There was also something I found hard to describe in the taste which in my notes I put down as ""from a dirty glass"" but which I think another better described as a hint of watered down maple syrup.

It has some grape flavors in it and lends itself a mild wine-like characteristic. Without the malted barley, it really loses quite a bit of the qualities that make a beer a beer. It is far removed from an amber ale, but I feel that I am rating this one more as a gluten free offering. Way better than the only other gluten-free beer I have had. Unfortunately, I think if I was intolerant to gluten, I would not drink any beer at all and probably stick to wine.","twiggamortis420","Sep 05, 2009"

I am generally not a big AB fan though I recently tried the Great American Ale and liked that as well. They have done a first rate job here. Though I would never confuse this for a craft brewed specialty beer or ale it tastes surprisingly good. The taste falls between a pale ale and a classic lager flavor, malty, mildly citrusy with caramel notes as well as a mid range hoppy finish.

Worth trying.","Frozensoul327","May 05, 2007"
2.73,5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Poured a coppery-red. Nominal head. Vague aroma hinting at caramel and apple cider. Mouthfeel was thin and a bit watery. Caramel malt flavor that called to mind an ale made with canned malt and a Mr. Beer kit. A bit of apple-ish flavor in the background. Finish was clean to the point of being flavorless. While all of this sounds bad, overall, the beer was acceptable, just not good.","Brent","Apr 09, 2007"

2.3,-11.5,3,3,2,2,2,"I had not seen this beer before, figured I'd try it. Pours a clear amber color with some head. Smells kind of sweet with some earth tones. Taste... hmm.. A bottle beer that tastes like a rusty tin can? It tastes & feels flat as well, maybe the store shook it up or left it in the sun for too long. By the end of the glass it wasn't quite as offensive, I picked up some cereal grain tastes, but definitely not enjoyable. I won't be having another, too bad I purchased a six pack.

It has a smooth ""amber lager"" taste that goes down easy, but it finishes way too dry for my liking. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation.

This is a decently drinkable beer, I was surprised to find that it wasn't too bad. I would buy this over Bud, which isn't saying much but it is a step up.

I image though that even though it is made with out wheat or barley it should have more flavor than it does. I will give it some credit being an Anheuser Bush beer I can't expect a whole heck of a lot. Now to the break down. The beer has a surprisingly deep amber color with a bit of a head to it, which doesn't hold very well at all. Has very little smell to it at all. like I mentioned before it has little taste, I would describe it as watery. Mouthfeel is it's strong point, as with most Anheuser Bush beers it is refreshing like a soda. Drinkability is poor for me since I found it bland and boring I will not drink more than the one I bought.","mclanem","Feb 12, 2007"

Doesnt even really say ""beer"". Flavor is a tad sweet-almost malty. It is sweet like unfermented wort. Very slight trace of hops to it. Mouthfeel is decent enough. As I reach the bottom of the glass the whole package is quite enjoyable.

Has a good thick white head and maintains a ring around the outside through every pull on the beer. Lacks any lacing though, which is disappointing. Has a sweet, malty scent. Nice fruit flavor, with slight hop bite and something else in the ending. Could be Sorghum. I am incredibly impressed. Much better than that Red Hook crap A-B tries to sell as real beer.","mattd017","Jan 31, 2007"

3.2,23.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I pulled a Redbridge from my fridge not knowing what it was. I poured it and was pleased with the appearance. Nice frothy white head... clear deep amber with golden highlights. I raised it to take a sip and noticed hops in the nose. Crisp... slightly elevated fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor was a little odd, sweetish and kind of off-kilter, so I looked at the label... ""Beer Made From Sorghum"". Ahhh! That explains it then. OK. Hmmm. Not bad! My last Celiac beer, if I can call it that, was unimpressive, but this was good. There's a strong hop flavor upfront, grassy and spicy, that screams ""BEER""! Beyond that it's malty; although I'm not sure if Sorghum is malted. I'd guess it is. It's the seed of a grass, just like barley. It's graininess is a touch rough and cardboard-ish (but not from oxidation), and it becomes sweet at the swallow. Unfortunately, it then becomes a bit astringent and harsh, lingering like that with bitterness and dully grassy and spicy hops for quite a bit. Still, I'd prefer this to almost all of the other Celiac beers I've had. For people with Celiac's disease, I'd highly recommend trying this one.","NeroFiddled","Jan 30, 2007"

Fairly faint, but not unpleasant. The taste is similarly sweet, but surprisingly restrained. There is also a slight bitterness that balances the sweetness. Comes off as quite a bit more flavorful than the common AB product. Medium to light body, not overcarbonated. Fades as it warms, definitely one to drink fairly quickly. Surprisingly okay for a sorghum beer. I am not a celiac, but I very much appreciate their difficulty and I think that AB should be commended for bringing to market such an important product that still tastes reasonably like a beer.","Georgiabeer","Jan 28, 2007"

The head went away quickly. It smells sweet, but also like apples and a bit spicy. The taste starts off sweet, but then a metallic taste comes through, and it has a weird bitter finish. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, but it's not bad. Drinkability is OK too, but not great. Overall it's OK, it's pretty average all the way around. Not bad, not great. I don't know if I would pay for this again, but I would drink it some other time.","bluejacket74","Jan 26, 2007"

Smell is really faint but what I do get reminds me of a mix of pure alcohol and caraway. Again, I get the caraway thing here as well as some grainy flavor I've never experienced before. I'm to assume this is the sorghum. I like it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but thickened by the sugars, Carbonation is decent.

3.27,25.8,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Yea, I fell for it. Glad to see A-B trying some experimental stuff. The beer reminds me of my first few batches of homebrew. Turned out overly malty (with something) spicy, and pepery. Sweetness and viscous similar to some other no-malt beers. I must say that this one seems better than them. Though the beer fell apart and the body turned out thin, the initial flavors show similar qualities to some Belgian malts, minus the yeasts. Overtly sweet well into the finish made it hard to drink late. A tacky feel on the palate with a heavy buttery feel. Not likely to try one again, but this session was not the expected disaster.","BEERchitect","Jan 16, 2007"
3.47,33.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My wife was diagnosed with gluten intolerance in 2001. She had been a beer drinker and was told beer was on the banned list. Using internet sources, I set out to make her gluten free beer. It was a real effort. Nobody sold malted sorghum or buckwheat, so the the entire process took weeks, and the results were mixed. Perhaps this effort predisposed me to liking a well-made GF beer. A gluten free beer from a brewery with the money to do it right was an exciting prospect. At the same time, I picked up some Redbridge and some Bard's Tale, another GF beer. In a blind tasting, my wife and I both preferred Redbridge by a wide margin. It had no funky smell or taste that is common with GF beers. Most occasional beer drinkers would probably not recognize it as anything but beer. It has a slightly darker color than Budweiser and enough hops to make things interesting. When compared against American Macros, the taste is actually a refreshing change. Not surprisingly, AB had the foresight to market this beer as a ""Beer Made from Sorghum," rather than a ""Gluten Free Beer."" By doing so, AB will almost certainly pick up some market share from drinkers who don't have celiac disease but just like the taste. This is a good development for celiacs everywhere but bad news for the small guys who have been laboring for years to come up with a commercial GF beer.","mickeymac","Jan 11, 2007"
