3.68,6.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear amber/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown bread, light nuttiness, plum, apple, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown bread, light nuttiness, plum, apple, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice Vienna lager. All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 21, 2014"

3.53,2.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of a Amber Lager, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the still, but I still wish it had just a little bit of hops to provide some balance to this beer. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, fairly crisp, not filling at all and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, but I think I would start to get bored with it after a couple, but if I wasn't concerned with taste I'm sure I could drink more than a few of them. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was and the mouthfeel, to me those were the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer was that there wasn't any hop flavors and aromas, I think a little hops would help this beer out a little and provide a little bit of balance to it. I might by this beer when looking for a nice Amber Lager, but it isn't something I just have to keep stocked in my fridge, but I do recommend it if you enjoy the style. All in all I thought this beer was nice, but there's a little room for improvement and I think with just a little work this could be a pretty tasty and memorable Amber Lager. This made for a decent first impression for Hop City and I'm interested in trying more of their beers. I think it's one of the better Amber Lagers I've had. Nice job guys, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Jul 15, 2014"

3.62,4.9,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"BSL poured a deep amber colour with about 1.5"" of pale orange coloured head...an attractive looking beer. The head dissipated within a few minutes, resolving itself into a collar and thin film that left some modest spotting and lacing down the glass. Some small, slow rising bubbles were visible in the beer. Its aroma was fairly straightforward, hops and caramel malts. Given the brewer's name I was expecting something with a hop heavy taste, but was pleasantly surprised by the balance between the hop flavour and sweet caramel malts. A faint lemon taste was also detectable. BSL had a slightly bitter aftertaste that lingered for a few seconds after each mouthful, but nothing overpowering nor too long lasting. The carbonation was perhaps a bit on the conservative side contributing to a smooth mouth feel, and I would describe BSL as light to medium bodied. Overall, a solid, straightforward brew that is good enough that I'd like to sample Hop City's Lawn Chair Classic Weiss. At $2.65 per can, BSL represents decent value for money.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

The malt tastes fresh, yet not overly sweet which is a good foundation for the subtle hop flavor which add to the mild yeast taste. The maltiness goes well with the hops which have a hint of herbal profile as the lager finishes semi-dry. Overall I really enjoyed this a very good lager with a nice balance of flavor which makes it more drinkable thany many of this style.

Nose was heavy with a biscuit malt scent. Mouthfeel was full, especially for a lager and the biscuit taste continued on the tongue.

3.73,8.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"My second review, and as with my first, bare with me. I don't reach for a lager when I want a good brew, but tonight when I asked the bartender for something different, he handed me this tall 16 ounce can. I poured the beer into my glass, and an average pour produced about two inches of thick white head. The color was a bit darker than an average lager and allowed less light through. The beer gives off a typical lager aroma - a metallic hoppy smell. The taste is what sets this drink apart. For a lager, I found the flavor sweet, starting with a toffee taste and migrating to a typical lager blend of malt and hops. That initial rush of sweet toffee really drew my attention, however. The body was also nice. I found the mouth feel to be a bit thicker than the average style - still light bit teetering on medium bodied. Overall, if I ever find myself with a hankering for a lager, this beer would absolutely do the trick. It doesn't rewrite the style. Rather, Barking Squirrel Lager serves as a nice edition in any lager lover's library.","eddie_g","Dec 15, 2012"

The taste is pure lager, with grain balancing out with caramel and crystal malt. I guess there is some hops used, but they aint reaching my tounge.

Hops are probably Tettnang or Saaz, or both. More bread and cereal flavours in the aftertaste, very lager-like. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a lightly parched finish. For an amber/vienna, this is comparable to Creemore and Sam Adams but not as well-hopped as Brooklyn Lager. While Barking Squirrel isn't ground breaking, it's still a respectable drinker.

It will also be interesting to see how our local microbreweries will respond if these guys start to eat into the craft lager market. It would be neat to see some of them branch out into different styles and try to differentiate themselves more. Hop City is quasi-independent of Moosehead, just as Creemore are of Molson, and I can see a lot of parallels between the flagship brands. Both are clean easy drinking lagers that would be acceptable to craft and non-craft drinkers alike. Does this mean I'll start drinking Barking Squirrel all the time? No, I'll stick with the fuller-flavoured offerings I prefer, but this will be an excellent choice when the selection is sparse, as it gives the usual macro suspects a whuppin'.","bobsy","Nov 20, 2009"
3.63,5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Being an affiliate of Moosehead Brewery, I was surprised at how good this beer was. I could see this being pretty close to Creemore for me and wouldn't mind switching the two up every once in awhile. Overall, nothing spectacular, but sure worth a try.","ludachris","Nov 16, 2009"
3.51,1.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A pretty decent entry into the craft market for Moosehead. Could be more ""craft"" but I was relatively happy with the quality of this one.","Viggo","Nov 16, 2009"
