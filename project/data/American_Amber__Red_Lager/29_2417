It tastes as if someone took a bottle of michelob, poured a third of it out, filled the bottle with honey and put the cap back on. That's probably not too far from the truth.

3.98,61.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Being a 20-year honeymead drinker/brewer, I have some experience with this kind of beer. The Michelob Honey Lager is slightly darker gold and a tiny bit thicker than a standard lager, which adds to the mouthfeel. The honey in the aroma is noticeable but not as overwhelming as some suggest. Nor is the taste dominated by the honey stored within. Sure, it's a bit sweet but also kinda malty and has a light backtaste of hops and a hint of fresh corn. I think the honey flattens the head, but it's a small price to pay for the overall taste. I enjoy it.","jimmybryght","Jun 24, 2009"

Sweet - very sweet with a strong honey flavor. It's almost like they just took some raw honey and stirred it in to sweeten the beer.

The flavors were similar, basic Michelob beer with a little added pale malt sweetness and something syrupy that wanted to be honey ,but wasn't. Blah. Bad aftertaste that lingered, a nail in the coffin. The mouthfeel was good but the carb too high and the body watery. Thumbs down.","thekevlarkid","Dec 07, 2008"

It has a two-tone body it gets darker towards the top once things start to settle. It smells mainly sweet a little bit of honey but mostly adjunct and malt. The taste is also somewhat adjunct as well but not bad overall. The after taste is really sweet and honey like. There is a little bitterness and it is a light bodied beer.","MTNboy","Nov 22, 2008"

I used to work in a beer truck at an outdoor concert center and this was on tap along with regular Michelob. It was decent back in the day, and is still alright in my book. Faint aroma with a sweet honey scent. Pour is so-so, lack of a decent head and lacing knock it below average. Mouthfeel is a touch thin.

The flavor is not bad at all - if this is an American macro lager ala regular michelob its got it beat hands down, much more malt character and also some honey sweetness that is a tad cloying but not too much (certainly not more than a lot of Big beers and big beer styles), and does have some balancing hop flavor and bitterness although its clearly on the malt side of the balance. I think this beer probably had honey added after pasteurization or filtering - most honey beers get honey sweetness attenuated by the yeast, or certainly the homebrews I've made and consumed have been. So, maybe its kind of cheating but hey I think it works OK. This is another sample from the holiday pack, which I think overall is pretty good for a macro brewery.

The honey sweetness is not balanced all that well with the rest of the flavors. The mouthfeel is rich and a little thick, leaving a thin, syrupy cating on the tongue.

3.03,22.7,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Pours to a deep golden color, with a white head that diminishes quickly.  There is a faint sweet malt aroma.  The flavor is very sweet, with a very pronounced honey flavor.  It finshes smooth and sweet, with low hop flavor or bitterness.  Overall, I was pleasantly surpised with this one.  The honey flavor really came through on this one.  It is a bit sweet, but would be a drinkable beer on a hot summer day.","BeerBuilder","Nov 11, 2002"
2.73,10.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Rich medium amber. Rich head and tentatively clingy lace Not bad apperaance in a glass, poured from tap. Very sweet malt and under carbonated. Way to sweet to drink at all. Make me sick to my stomach.","psugrad98","Nov 08, 2002"
3.27,32.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"it is smooth and sweet with a very strong taste of natural honey, much more than i had expected. the honey is balanced out by a nice maltiness that makes it an all around flavorable beer.","ElGuapo","Nov 07, 2002"
2.79,13,3.5,2,3,3,3,"Anyway, I didn't think this was too bad.  I surely don't accept it as a serious specialty beer, but I think it's kind of a ""macro novelty"" that you try once and leave it at that.","Beastdog75","Sep 19, 2002"

3.46,40.1,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"After a hard day of shopping at the market, I was very thirsty when I popped the top on this Michelob Honey Lager. The combination of the sweet honey and the bite of the hops put my palate at ease right off the bat, this is a fairly good macro lager.","BeerBob","Sep 01, 2002"
2.85,15.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Any beer that tastes better out of the bottle has problems.  I was dissatisfied at the lack of head and head retention.  I was dejected at the lack of smell, some faint sweetness (honey?) but nothing noteworthy.  The taste seemed kind of manufactured; the honey/sweetness did not seem natural.  I did not find the flavors overwhelming nor did I find them overly enjoyable.  I could drink one or two of these (in a pinch) and thats about all","bditty187","Aug 04, 2002"
1,-59.5,1,1,1,1,1,"I think the BA reviewers were on to something. The brewers were full of crap--this is not what it should be. Honey, when added into the fermentation process (where it belongs, IMO) will NOT sweeten the beer. Honey is 100% simple sugar, thus 100% fermentable. I can't stand it when brewers and meaderies make such cloyingly sweet beverages such as Michelob Honey Lager. What they are really doing is ""flavoring"" this otherwise decent beer with honey to give it honeyish aroma and sweetness. They have to add it after the yeast has been removed or killed, otherwise it would ferment out and you would get a drier, more vinous flavor from the honey and maybe the aromatics of the flowers the bees were using. Dundee, A-B, stop doing this! It misrepresents the true role of honey in fermented beverages. I damn it on principle.","EagleTalon","May 13, 2002"
1.35,-45.3,2,2,1,1.5,1,"Cloying and sickeningly sweet.  J.W. Dundees does a better job with their Honey Brown.  This smells o.k., pours out to a bright yellow, then assaults you mouth with a nasty, sweet taste that follows through all the way to the end.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"
2.28,-7.7,3,2.5,2,3,2,"i didn't dislike this beer, and even drank a few of them while i was at it....but i can see where beer geeks would be turned off. the honey taste and sweetness was almost overwhelming, but genuine. nothing i would seek out if i had to pay for it, since i had this at a friends house. if you REALLY like the sweet taste of honey, or are looking for a breakfast beer to go with those pancakes....this is a good choice. if your looking for genuine beer flavor, stear clear.","budgood1","Mar 10, 2002"
2.95,19.4,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Of all the Michelob ""craft brews", this one is least likely to give me a headache (before the Michelob line, the AB ""Black and Tan"" Porter was my favorite but it was long ago discontinued)...a look at the ingredients label told me that this brew doesn't include rice or other grains, differing from the others...maybe?  Very average and a little greasy, because of the honey, I guess...when I'm trapped into bringing something home from a limited grocery selection, I might get this...no hops, malt hidden by sweetness, but I can drink it...","ADR","Feb 18, 2002"
1.2,-51.4,3.5,1,1,1.5,1,"Notes: Pretty bad, way too sweet and very hard to drink one 12 oz bottle. Needs a bigger twang of hop and/or a bit of dryness. Not recommended at all.","Jason","Jan 07, 2002"
