"Unique beer I wasn't accustomed to.  To a of coronation and head. Sweet but stout. I'll drink this will I'm eating BBQ but that would be about it."
""

"One of the worst beers ever."

"im a big fan of this"

"Very disappointed."

"This is my go-to, session beer.  Just a nice taste that goes down easy."

"Pretty disappointing.  I expected a sweeter newcastle, however this was not the case.  Poured a very light bronze with white head that didn't last.  Smell was sweet malt, maybe some corn.  Taste was very sweet with a bit of honey and a weird after flavor that I couldn't quite place.  Overall a very thin sweet beer that I would pass on again."
"Honestly, it tasted like bud light with a splash of honey. Disappointing"
"Has a tinge of honey at the end."

"Drinkability: I really wouldn't want to drink too many of these there are soooo many better drews."

"Heavy and sweet but goes down very easy."

"O: This is the most drinkable beer I've had in a while. Very light, but refreshing. I have no doubt this would be a great beer for barbecues, or with burgers. Very good for a mass-produced domestic beer."

"honey brown is one of the original beers of rochester, and unless you drink the genny stuff, this is really the original craft offering of the city. i still like it as much as i ever have. its distinct. a little pale in color to be considered a brown in my book, more copper, and very clear. the nose shows a little honey sweetness, but most of that is fermented out and leaving only the pollen honey flavor. lots of malt middle too, with more of an amber sweetness than a honey one. malty like an esb almost, less roast and chocolate malt than i usually expect from a brown, but there is a sight darker malt element which i guess can get it there for those not used to bigger darker richer browns. the fact that its lagered makes it awesome i think. drinks lighter, finishes quickly, and lets the flavors sort of come back one by one after the swallow. a very pleasant and drinkable brew, good craft to drink a lot of, and even right from the bottle feels appropriate. nice carbonation and not the least bit filling. the original and best from dundee."

"This beer is refreshing and balanced. Honey brown has a sweet malt flavor with seemingly no hops to taste. You get a sweet malt flavor at the front of the tongue with a pleasant mild honey aftertaste. The two different sweet characteristics makes you want to take another sip. The beer is easy to drink and an excellent choice on a hot summer day or night. Since there is no bitterness to this beer, it is an excellent recommendation to friends who are used to drinking typical American lagers."

"Overall- A lager I was pleased with. I would buy these for those warm Summer days. Very easy drinking and has a pleasant sweet taste about it which makes it quite agreeable. I'm not a lager guy but this beer is now one of my favorite lagers. Refreshing."

"A good everyday beer. The appearance is a little thin for a brown, but the smell and taste were both pretty good. Mostly earth and nut tones from the smell but most of what you get in the taste was a little bit of floral tastes from the hop and a little bit of sweetness from the malt. The mouthfeel was nice as well although it was thinner than I thought it was going to be. It's not complicated, doesn't have a real wow factor, but overall not bad."
"Overall: I quite enjoyed this beer. It is the first time I have ever tried it. It is certainly not a ’world class’ beer but it is perfectly fine for what it is -- a clean, refreshing, and enjoyable brew."
"Overall: Just a bit too watered down, I was disappointed even without high hopes."

"overall this brew is great by my accounts. .99 Cents a 24 oz. A honey dominate brew. but well balanced. malts are well hidden. i would buy this again. Price is right, and so is the taste if you like honey. you can pick up a 12 pack of 24 Oz's for just over $12. that's 24 beers for a shade over 12 bucks. deal!"

"Honey Brown Lager is a nice Light Brown color. Smell there is not much there. Taste is smooth and rich. Over all it is a good drinkable brew. Like I said goes down smooth. It is a full beer. This a brew that i will be buying to change it up for the main steam brews on the market."
"Pours a amber color with a small white head that doesn't last long at all. With really no lacing to speak of. Average carbonation. Aroma is of a sweet malt and yeast with honey & brown sugar. The taste was about the same with a hint of caramel. No bitter aftertaste. Overall it was very decent."
""
"O-This is a pretty macro-type beer, even if it does offer hints of honey to set it apart from the BMC standards. The biggest problem for me is that the honey is a bit artificial tasting, which doesn't do much to cover up the grainy base beer. Oh well...it is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I picked this up because it looked like a good deal for a beer I'd never tried before. It's a perfectly decent drink- nothing splendid, but for the price, I didn't expect anything more than perfectly decent. I'd buy it again, but without any especially great enthusiasm."

"Leftover from a party on the 11th. Not good. Previous notes from 2007 indicate I judged this to be a bad beer. I still agree, despite the technical rating."

""
""
""
""
""

"I would definitely like to try this beer out again when I gain a little more knowledge about beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, and certainly easy to drink a lot of. ~$10 for a 12 case isn't a bad price, but it could be cheaper for the quality."
""
""
""
"It has been awhile since I had this one. I have fond memories of it. Pours a beautiful golden brown. Smells of honeysuckle, the mouthful is like chewing toffee candy. This is one of the two honey beers where you can actually taste the honey. Taste is sweet malty, definitely satisfies the sweet tooth. Very drinkable beer. I am rating it higher than most but I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: You can definitely smell and taste the honey in this beer, which prevents it from being bland."
""
""
""
""
"A little light on the taste but still not a bad beer, I could down a few of these."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer for the price. Not a lot of complexity and low on alcohol content but what do you expect at $19 a case. My favorite ""bargin"" lager so far."

"Pours a deep copper color. Aroma of sweet malt, honey and spent grains. In the taste, honey, malts, bread, and very little hop or bitterness. Smooth lager with notes of caramel and honey. Toast, caramel, hop and a bit of corn. Smooth lager with a mild honey taste. Medium bodied feel with a honey slick finish. Good amount of carbonation and quite drinkable. Overall, this is still a good beer. I made myself famous in college by throwing keg parties with this stuff. Let the good times roll with this one."

""

"Overall I liked this beer and will buy more. A very enjoyable drinking experience."
""
"Overall better than I thought it would be. Know I've had this beer in the past but didnt sit down to think about it in depth."
""
"Overall: Full disclosure- I am a fan of this because of its pricing and overall taste. This is the kind of brew you start drinking at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday and are still enjoying in early evening. The alcohol does not overwhelm, but the beverage remains highly drinkable. A true session beer offering from New York state. This beer pairs with alot of 'bar-food' and is equally enjoyable on its own. It has a unique flavor and is consistently enjoyable. Share with friends after work, while watching a game, or while relaxing on the patio by yourself. Add a few bottles to your refrigerator so you have a fall-back when guests don't appreciate the high-end stuff. This is appealing to beer-snobs as well as beer-illiterates."

"Not a great beer but enjoyable. This is my standby for something cheap but quaffable. Also good for cooking brats and sausages. For the price, its A great choice for something that tastes reasonably good without the craft price tag. I'd agree as well that its a steppingstone to greater things but it is great for times that you want something decent without exhausting your supply of quality brews."

"Half finger head that fades instantly. Amber red color. Almost no smell. Syrupy bland taste. Goes down smooth. Goes down like rootbeer. Barely and carbonation makes it taste thick. It almost leaves no aftertaste. Overall it's a pretty decent beer. I would buy it again."
""
""
""
"Fits the American Amber category well in some ways. A bit too sticky for me and the hops were noble, not citrusy/piney American. Judged to style, not my flavor preference."
""
"Overall- This beer is decent. Even with the nostalgia in my heart (and Palate) it is not as good as I remember. However, I have offered this beer to many a women and they really like it which is good for all you craft drinking men out there. I would only recommend this to people experimenting in beers so they can acquire a taste for something a bit more than the typical American adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Shiner Bock is not easy to get where I live, so this can be a more affordable substitute and though the flavor doesn't match Shiner it's not as noticeable if you don't compare them together like I did. It's a refreshing beer with a slight sweet darker taste than any of your macros."

"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy golden color, produced an average head with average retention and left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain and honey. Light in body, easy to drink, base of barley malt, slight hop flavor- beer is thin....not much of a honey flavor however the beer is very sweet. - out of balance in my opinion. Expected a lot more from this cult beer."
"O: A very mediocre lager, but then I was not expecting much. The honey flavor is very subtle and the beer is poorly balanced. Not entirely unappealing, but I doubt I would ever go out of my way to try this again."

"Enjoyed the smoothness of this beer. Enjoyable mouthfeel, easy to go down and great smell of roasted malts. It was not too sweet and not too bitter. You can expect the perfect balance between the two. This is the perfect dessert beer and also a great refreshing treat after a hard day of tending to the lawn in the hot summer sun. However, it does taste a little watered down. Definitely could use some more hops to it. The yeast flavors are lacking in this one if you like yeasty beers, but would definitely try again if caught on sale."
""
""

""
""
"O: Watery amber beer with little flavour and a slightly above average bottle and name. Not worth the price I paid in China (45yuan for this import). Only like that its from Upstate NY."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I was not impressed with this beer. I found it to lack a lot of flavor and the metallic scent was a turn-off. I would not recommend the beer. Not looking forward to the other 5."
""
""
""
"Clear, medium amber color. Not much nose that I can detect (where do tasters come up with all these descriptions??). Head vanishes quickly, leaving no traces. Mouth feel is smooth. Flavor is good, but a bit sweet. More malt than hops -- in fact, I can barely taste hops. Overall, not bad. Don't think I'll be buying this at the store, but I'd choose it in a restaurant if they didn't have anything more interesting."
"A: pours with little lacing and is transparent light amber. S: Honey with light wheat. T: Sweet honey front transitioning to light caramel. Taste finishes quickly with little aftertaste. Mouth feel is watery and light. Overall, not bad for the style but the beer lacks depth, complexity, and individuality."

"My go-to cheap beer. They've got this at every store and every bar around here and it's always super cheap and tastes way better than anything else for the same price. Pours a brown color with off-white head. Malty taste with a hint of honey. This is the perfect beer for a low budget."

"Light amber and completely transparent. Soda-like head with no retention or lacing. Bread and rice aroma. Adjunct flavor with some wheat flavor. Hint of honey. Sweet character overall. Light body and highly carbonated. Lack luster. Won't be having another."

"Bready up front. Light toasted malts, some honey, slight hint of corn, just a touch of bitterness towards the end. Light bodied. Dry lingering aftertaste."
""
""

""
""
"This beer is pretty unspectacular. If I had to use one word for it, that word would be ""sweet."" It has a very subtle sweet (and honestly not unpleasant smell.) It pours a nice full golden amber with a 1 inch or so head and not much lacing. Mouthfeel is a little thin and the aftertaste is just more sweet without a lot of hoppiness. Not horrible at all, but not spectacular either."
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavors were pretty much the same, with the added surprise of just a slight bit of a hop tang on the finish. Nothing really notable or terrible. The body was just middle-of-the road between light and medium. Drinkability was good enough, if you're stuck at an event (wedding, graduation, etc) and the choice is between this and the basic BMC-style offerings, you'll be pretty happy old Dundee is around. A decent for what it is, and hell, a 24oz can for under $2 ain't no bad thing."

"This brew brings back memories, I don't think I've had Honey Brown since I was in college more than 15 years ago. 24 ounce tall boy can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold/amber color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The aroma isn't bad at all, but it's very light. It smells like sweet and grainy malt, and some honey. Taste is similar to the aroma (but much stronger). It tastes like sweet/grainy malt, honey, and a bit of caramel. Very sweet tasting beer. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's smooth and goes down pretty easy. It really isn't too bad at all, I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't turn down a bottle or can of this."
"Hayward Abbey Rating: 76"

"o - Overall a pretty average beer. I found it a little too sweet and having a lot of toasted and burnt malts. Not something I'd probably seek out again."
""
""
"This is an awesome session beer. I'ts thirst quenching and still flavorful. I like this beer a lot. A macro drinker could easily like this beer right away."
""
""
"Either way, a good one to keep on hand (or pick up anywhere really, since it's common). One of my more preferred beers from Genesee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – A dull and kind of low quality malt lager. I wouldn’t turn it down if a free one were handed to me, but I would never buy this either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of average lager, nothing really stands out or puts it ahead of the rest. Would love to try it in a can or on tap to compare."

"Pours light caramel brown with a quickly dissipating finger length white head. The aromas are of sweet malt and honey, but it's not an intense aroma. It's sweet, but not too sweet. The honey flavor is present as well as some breadiness from the malt. It's a slightly sweeter macro lager. The mouthfeel is light and watery. It's well carbonated, so it drinks fairly easily. This is average and easy to drink. If you're looking for something macro, but slightly different, this would be fine."
""
"O: Hey, you get what you pay for – and I got this for free! It’s no Hopslam or Breakfast Stout, but hell, I’ll drink it by week’s end. Cheers!"
"O: this used to be so good, but turns out to be just an average beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is the only honey type beer I've ever tried but it's pretty good. A little too sweet but not bad.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorites back in college when I thought I was sophisticated, definitely a gateway brew for me. This pours a light brown color with a nice white foam on top. The aroma is sweet honey, a little staleness, roasted grains. The flavor has strong undertones of honey sweetness behind some roasted grain, and not much bitter to balance. The honey leaves a strange aftertaste to this pretty standard lager. A good changeup if you normally drink Bud, but I tend to avoid this one these days as the finish isn't as pleasant as I would like."
"It's a really good beer you can taste the honey! Not what I expected when poured out didn't really grab my attention with the color not as amber as hoped, the taste is the beer is great it is very easy drinking with not noticeable mouthfeel, overall it worth a B!"
""
"O - Pretty much mediocre. Don't think Ill be drinking this one again any time soon."
"It pours a dark and slightly reddish hue with I light tan colored head. It has a somewhat sweet taste and a roasty flavor but mellow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance was really nothing exciting,light brown,no head,no lacing,descent bubbling. Smell was better, a sweet honey malty odor,really couldnt pick up on any hop. The taste was a lot like the odor, very easy to drink,maybe too easy. No bite or real sense of ""hittin the spot"". This to me is a beer to drink in the same situation as a Coors or Bud...not that there's anything wrong with that. I like this beer and would drink it again."

" This is a beer I used to drink a lot of so I wondered if I would enjoy it again years later. The taste is mostly caramel with a light sweet smooth tinge and gentle diacetyl from the lager which isn't unpleasant. This has a hint of creamy caramel, but finish is semi-dry and light. Overall I enjoyed this, not a great lager in any sense, but serves its purpose, gentle sweet honey adds to the lager. It is probably one I will not return to unless the beer menu is similar to the place I ordered this in."

"Drinkability: I try to leave prejudice out of my reviews, but in full disclosure this was the beer I probably drunk the most of in my later years in college and my first years out out of it. Now I only have it every now and then. Still it is sentimental and is a favorite. I love the sweetness and refreshingness of this. I could easily drink a six of these--if not more. Of all the Dundee's beers this is by far my favorite. I think it drinks more like a sweet brown. If you like sweeter beers, hunt this down. The honey is about as present here as it is in any beer."
"Aroma sweet malts floral. Appearance is a coppery light brown with fairly large white head. The head dissapears in seconds, there is no lacing. The taste is horrid, overly sweet, adjunct lager with brown food coloring! Nasty, Nasty,Nasty!"
"O - not really my style. Only reason I was able to try this was because my wife bought some. I would not buy this for myself, but my old lady seems to enjoy them."
"O: A decent amber, but rather plain and a little too malty for my taste. Just a very basic brew."
"One-dimensional but not bad."
"o- nicely and happily surprised at how much i like this. its not bad at all for cheap beer and is very drinkable. since the abv is so low it wouldnt be a bad thing to down a 12 pack. very happy with my choice!"
"D-Very easy drinking and sessionable beer. You can't beat the price either: .99 for a 24 oz. can. A great choice for a backyard BBQ sort of event."
"O: Might try to cook with this one..."
"Pours a weird colour for a so called honey brown its more like a clear see through golden amber hue which leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and a rim of lacing,i found the smell of honey more prominant when smelling the bottle but when poured the aromas are creaming soda,a touch of honey,floral hops and sweet barley,it has a just over light bodied mouthfeel and is very smooth and has tastes of toffee,honey,a touch of floral hops,barley sugar and finished with a caramel sweetness and overall i really was hoping for more cheers."
"Poured a 1.5"" white head. Clear light sienna brown iced tead colored body. Smell is mildy sweet with caramel. Taste is pretty much the same. Label says this is extra rich? No. Is it lager? Yes, I get some of the crispness in the finish. Is it sweet as honey, no, not really. Just a tiny step up from BMC mainstream."
"Overall - meh. It is what it is. The price point is a direct indicator of what you're getting."
"O: Decent honey brown lager. Very smooth and easily drinkable. Better than a watered down mass produced beer but not an over- the-top craft beer – and it looks like that is what they were going for."
" Nothing too amazing, but a nice flavorful brew."
"Pours a dark gold with 1/4"" of head that quickly fades to a thin lacing. Smells of grains and lager yeast with just a hint of honey. Taste is sweet; grains up front and honey in the finish. The honey doesn't over power, but is actually mixed well with an average lager. Mouthfeel is crisp though a little over carbonated."
"Pours a golden body with a thin white head that has good carbonation, decent lacing and minimal retention. The nose consists of sweet malts and not much else. The taste starts out with some sweet honey flavored syrupy malts with a hint of hops and grains. The label says brewed with honey, but I can't taste a good quality honey in this beer. The mouth feel is light and very watery and overall this is just an average sweet tasting American lager. Amazing that ten years ago when I was drinking Labatt, Bud, Bud Light, Dos Equis and Smithwick that I thought this was a great beer."
"""Mr. Dundee"" most likely is sighing in his grave."
"O - it's just ok."
"Poured clear and with a nice amber/light brown color with a small, white head. The nose was strong with caramel and a general fruity sweetness. The taste was filled with a caramel and honey sweetness what was not at all overpowering. As the glass progressed, that honey started to come out of the background a little more, but this remained a sweet, refreshing drink."
"This is the first beer that I ever drank. I hated it at the time. I actually thought it was bitter! Coming back to it many years and many beers later, I'm struck by how times and tastes change. Not a great beer by any means, but a good one. I could session it easily. A good one to have from time to time, and it's hard to beat the price."
"This beer is cheaper in the big 24 oz cans than in the 6 pack where I shop. I drink the cans multiple times per week. It's the best beer anywhere near its price range. (about 1.50 for a 24 oz can)"
"The bottom line: I paid a dollar for this 24 oz. can, and that's a damn good price for what you get, but I always try to push price aside when reviewing a beer and focus on quality. As far as quality goes for this beer, it's decent. Give it a try, you might enjoy it. Much love~"
"Pretty good, but this one comes with a warning. It has some nice sweet undertones which make it easy to toss back, although it has a light ABV compared to other sweeter beers like Brown Sugah. Refreshing, tasty, and delicious."
"Honey brown pours out as a Light brown lager similar to what a Newcastle looks like. The head is thin and fizzy, the smell is lightly toasted. The taste is kind of bland now these days, it used to be a nice roasted sweetness that was pretty easing. The mouthfeel is very light. Overall I thought it used to be better but I guess my tastes changed."
"Overall - A pretty measly attempt to seem like a craft beer, when it's nothing but an unimpressive, not-very-pleasant macro lager with sweetener in it."
"Poured from the bottle with a promising head which soon vanishes, leaving the least lacing I've ever seen in a commercial beer. Color is a pale brownish amber. Slight caramel flavor is only good feature, I think. Slightest hint of dishwater taste must be the hops. Too sweet to be refreshing. Insipid is the best short description."
"Not an impressive beer but not a bad beer either."
"Almost a two finger head of cotton looking foam that lasted about as long as a fly in a crowd of frogs. Little lace to this one, just a slight spotting on the side of my mug. Color is a 9 on the SRM beer color chart. No haze and plenty of little bubbles rising to the top. Smell has the fragrances of clover honey, dried wheat and oats, cooked corn and malt. Taste is slightly sweet, with flavors of malt, honey, slight spices, and toasted wheat. Mouthfeel is crisp, great zing from the carbonation, medium creaminess, and a freshness that cleans my upper palate. A good refreshing beer with a out front flavor leaving very little after taste with the exception on a honey sweetness."
"I can't believe I ever thought this was a good beer in the past. I'm so glad my palate has changed. It's like adding honey to something bland but even the honey has a hard time making its presence known. Less than average."
"I used to love this beer, but since I've tasted true great beer, this now leaves me with a lot to be desired."
"A bit dissapointed by this one. Not bad, but not great."
"Pours a golden amber color with a fast diminshing head. A slight scent of wheat, malts, and little honey. Taste is rather light and simple every bit of the taste is too weak. You really have to search for the Honey. It's drinkable but could really use more depth to it's taste. Something to add to your list of beers drank, but that's about it."
"Overall, I was kind of disappointed in this beer. I'm a fan of Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss, so I figured combining red lager (one of my more favorable styles) and honey would be good. I might get this again because its reasonably priced and packs a decent malty flavor profile for a change of pace."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a decent-sized white head. The aroma has a little bit of honey in it but the major aroma components are grain and sugar. The beer smells very sweet overall. The flavor is also heavy on the grain with a little bit of caramel malt mixed in. Nothing special. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I do NOT like honey-flavored beer."
"Light and watery mouthfeel with no crispness present from carbonation at all."
"Finish: Not a lot going on here, from the start to the finish on the plate it seems the beer does not change in complexity, the finish dies out fairly quickly and I'm sorry but I do not taste the notes of Honey on my palate"
"Overall: Underrated. No doubt."
"It's a nice amber lager. Don't expect a brown ale type body, because that is not what you'll get. Has a decent head in my Meantime snifter, but it doesn't last all that long. Lively carbonation to watch rise, but it comes off a bit watery in with the richness. Doesn't smell much like anything except weak malts and a bit of honey. Taste is lacking. Good enough to pull out for a party though. It's way more flavorful than the alternatives. I'd love to use this for beer pong. It's not overly carbonated and won't fill you up."
"Poured a transparent copper color with a little bit of head. Little bit of malt on the nose, not much honey really. Taste is OK, although it's a little weak. Decent flavor, but nothing special. Good mouthfeel and goes down smooth, but not a great beer."
"Nonetheless, this is a tasty and easy-to-drink lighter beer that doesn't offend, and I'd get again to share with friends."
"Most people will criticize it for it's lack of complexity and character. That aside you absolutely cannot beat the drinkability of this beer."
"The Honey Brown is a consistent smooth beer that will satisfy the average beer drinker, and should keep the beer snob moderately happy. It has a medium to light bodied brown ale taste with a semi-strong malty flavor (no doubt the honey). It is sweeter than most Lagers but not overbearing. If you do not mind a lager with a hint of sweetness, it will be a good choice. However, if a Yuengling is too sweet for you, stay away."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001): Pours a lighter transluecent amber with a small off white head that went away quickly. Aroma of malts, honey and roasted peanuts. Taste of honey and a slight roastiness. Some roasted malts. Average beer, better than a majority of the macros.Very mainstream mild caramel malt flavour with very low bitterness. Light body with decent carbonation."
"D: This one renews my faith in lagers. Thanks to this beer, look forward to diving deeper into this style."
"This beer is what it is. It is a good example of a crappy style I guess."
"D: Drinkable, yes. Good, no. Better than BMC beers, but not a great beer by any stretch of the imagination. Too light and unexceptional on the pallet to be a single drink beer, and too sickly sweet with the honey to be a session beer."
"D - at 4.5% I might as well be drinking light beers. A easy going beer that probably wont creep up on you."
"Overall im up in the wind with weather i like it or not I mean its not bad but at the same time its not great so i guess im saying i wont be making any more purchases of this but if you offered me one i would have one or two."
"Altogether not an absolute horrible beer but I dont think I will ever be picking this one up again."
"The foam was an almost white wheat color, smooth, bubbly and dissapated quickly. The color was a very deep gold with amber highlights. The smell was a floral hops aroma with hints of toasted wood and a very light orange peel undertone. The taste had a definate hops overtone but too overbearing, a earthy wood and soil undertone with floral and citrus highlights. Mouthfeel - light bodied, crisp and clean. Drinkability - was an ok beer due to the earthy undertones but almost drowned out by the lack of flavors and aromas. Not a personal favorite - just below average."
"D - Man I knew of this stuff when I was drinking crappy BMC because it is a slight step above it. Drinkable, light, with flavor and refreshing. A nice starter to craft beer!"
"Drinkability is definitely good, perfect for hot summer days."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It had a golden red color with a head that was not very think and quickly disappeared. In this aspect I was not very impressed; I like a good head. There was not a strong smell but it was slightly sweet. I however thought it was pretty tasty for a lighter beer. My girlfriend who usually sticks to the yellow fizzy beers, such as bud light, actually enjoyed this one. The taste was not very strong and somewhat sweet, which is expected from a honey beer. If you are in to an strong hoppy flavor, this beer isn't for you, however it is a lager. This beer is light and very drinkable; something you might want if entertaining non-advocates of good, bold, strong beer. I like most types of beer and enjoyed this one for an easy drinking, sweet, lager. All in all this is one I would try if trying to get someone away from drinking mass-produced ""economy"" beer, and trying to expand their horizons beyond bud, coors, or miller into more distinct beers."
"Verdict:"
"D - Very drinkable, but not enjoyable. It really does not taste like much. Bland."
"Very average to below. Drinkable but not much in flavor."
"D- Easy to drink. Average, not impressed. Expected sweeter taste to be called a honey."
"D- Good in terms of being able to down this rather easily, but it isn't great. I'd definitely have a couple of pints before moving on, without feeling offended. I just feel that for this style, it's a weak attempt and seeing as this is one of my preferred beer styles to drink, I'd get several others before picking this up again. Oh well, it's still something I'd recommend someone try as a stepping stone."
"Label sucks too..."
"12oz bottle. Pours copper color with s small, short lived, white head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, honey and some pear. Light, thing body. Taste is of caramel malt and honey. No hops on the palate at all. Finish is completely absent. I will skip this one next time."
"Pours a pretty amber color with reddish tints, a thick white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells very sweet much like a frappe if that is a good thing... Tastes of sweetness from the malts, honey, and some well balanced hops. Mouthfeel is medium and nice. Drinkability is high."
"Drinkability - I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. Wasn't full enough for me. I mean, I can drink it, but I'm not going to go out of my way to find this beer. It is better than any ""macro", but I was expecting something maltier with a better mouthfeel."
"D. An average performer as beers go but as a lager better than the massed produced tripe that is floating around. I am giving it 4 for drinkability as it is a clean drinker though there are better honey flavoured beers out there (Holts's Humdinger and Brewdog's Dogma). Couldn't make up my mind wether this was a 3.5 or 4 for Smell but plumped for the higher mark."
"This beer has a honey color to it. It smells a very sugary beer, there is a honey sweetness with some orange aromas as well. The taste is really way too sweet to be enjoyed well. The mouthfeel is pretty decent but this is really fizzy on the tongue, not bad to drink, if you're hurting for money there are worse beers you could buy than this."
"The brew day was coming to a close by the time I cracked this bottle open. It pours a clear pale golden honey topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises fake grape, light caramel, mandarin oranges, and lemon zest. The taste runs along a similar course, with some light honey thrown in as well. Things haven't thickened out, though: they remain as whispy as in the smell. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a decent brew, a bit on the weak side, and a bit fizzy to truly be highly drinkable."
"D: Pleasant, a bit too sweet for me to want a sixer. I might order another."
"I found this in a 24 oz. can sitting on a shelf and just decided to give it another go. It's mostly the same as I got from the bottle with two interesting differences: the head was tall and dense, leaving thick, sticky lacing, and the only thing keeping if from a higher score was that it didn't last long enough, though it wasn't especially short-lived. Secondly, the mouthfeel seemed a bit thicker and creamy smooth, so that seemed to be an improvement as well. Otherwise there's really nothing different about it from the can as opposed to the bottle, though those aspects did up the drinkability."
"Light bodied, medium carbonation, slight chewiness. I guess it's smooth drinking, but the sub-par flavor doesn't really help anything. If I'm going to drink something this weak, I'd rather go with a light beer and just forget any attempt at poor flavor."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, but the sweetness can be cloying at times. Needs more hops."
"The final verdict is that this is an aesthetically pleasant beer that unfortunately comes up short on taste. In the years since my last Honey Brown my preferences have certainly changed. I probably won't be coming back to this one any time soon."
"Slightly above-average quality. And for the price (about a dollar per beer) it's tough to find better."
"The beer is a bit sweet with a hint of honey. It may catch some people off guard if they're expecting something richer and heavier after seeing the color. There is no hoppy bitterness and no nuttiness like you'd expect from a nut brown ale. This beer drinks very easy...almost like a Coors Light, but with sweet flavor. Not a terrible choice if you're looking for something cheap."
"Also I picked up a 12 pk of bottles for 10.99 which is a steal, and I do like the label."
"Overall not bad at all. It has some depth and complexity. Isn't for everyone but definitely not the worst beer in this class. Pours dark with a decent head. Taste is rich with a slight ""honey brown sugar"" sweetness which doesn't appeal to everyone. Good for a few but might not be the best choice for a Saturday or Sunday full of football."
"Despite the fact that this beer has a low rating, i think it really great. This is not at all a typical american lager like bud or coors. This beer has a mild sweet taste that is very smooth much like all lagers and an almost creamy aftertaste that will please any mouth. This is one of my favorite session lagers and i highly suggest it."
"This beer is medium to light in body, mildly sweet and grainy. It has a mild aftertaste its a very boring beer. There is no honey in the palate, at least I can't detect it. Just another (basically) bland beer for the masses."
"While I was disappointed with the taste, the mouthfeel of this beer is enough to make me give it a second try. Gotta love that heaviness and full body! This won't be a frequent purchase, but if I'm in the mood for a sweet and full-bodied beer I'd go for it."
"This is one of those beers that most peopele who try it say is good but it is nobody's favorite. I will drink this one again but probably not today."
"D: you bet, you could have a number of these, but mainly to try to catch up to what one good craft ale would do for you"
"D- Drinkable, I suppose. Sits in that same level is the Michelob ""crafts"" for me. This beer is decent, and nice to see in someone's house instead of some alternatives, but still nothing to search out."
"Nothing all too great about this beer, it's a bit better tasting then the average lagger, smells ok, tastes watery with a finish of honey which removes the bad taste I normally get with a lager. Its about as drinkable as the style gets, that being said I could easily pass on the style."
"Pretty refreshing brew when served colder than 40, even though it is quite sweet. Has a honey flavor which is what they were going for I assume. Light bodied with a delicate toast on the finish that helps the meager hops clean things up. Not great, but it makes a good, reasonably priced gateway beer to get people interested in more flavorful brews."
"Had this one on-tap at Flying Saucer for no reason than to chalk one more beer towards my 5th plate. Served in a standard pint glass a deep orange, certainly not anything I would call ""brown," with a thin, quickly diminishing head. Aroma was slight honey, but not much else. The taste was a bit of sweet honey and malts, again, not much there. The beer was light bodied with low carbonation. I honestly didn't expect much with this one, and it certainly didn't deliver anything. This is one I will not be having again."
"Drinkability: A very average lager. Certainly better than most other macro offerings but still pretty pedestrian, in my opinion."
"Drinkability well while not the most exciting buzz worthy beer this is definitely a great intro to the craft world and beer with real flavors."
"Biere mit honning, eh? My Old Lady is both an apiarist and a meaderist so I wonder what she thinks of this, or maybe I don't, since she is rather outspoken. The pour gave me just over a finger of fluffy eggshell-white head with great retention and the beginnings of decent lacing. Color was a bit on the golden side for an Amber/Red, but it did exhibit NE-quality clarity. Nose had an odd nicotine/tobacco smell and I am sitting in my ABSOLUTELY smoke-free kitchen as I type this. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a slight sweetness on the tongue. I also experienced an odd flavor that reminded me of freshly bleached laundry. Oof. Finish was slightly sweet, but overall this was not worthy. Sorry."
"D: I would consider this a quite drinkable beer although the mild sweetness would stop me after a couple."
"Beer made with honey, once served in a pilsener bayern glass. Look: Brown-crystal color, lots of bubbles, thin foamy head, white and fine, the logo looks like the Simpson's bee. Smell: Clean, just sweet malt and honey, nothing else, maybe a little toffee too. Taste: Sweet and toffee malt, lots of honey and some floral hops. Mouthfeel: Clean, little bitter with a sweet finish, light and soft body. Drinkability: Very acceptable and very sweet."
"Dundee's Honey Brown was probably the shit back in the age of disco, but these days craft beer drinkers expect more from their beer. Not a horrible option, and maybe worth a try just for the sake of nostalgia."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Goes down smooth and with no trouble. That slight alcohol taste, however, is a bit confusing to me. I was hoping against it due to it's low ABV."
"Notes: There is definitely nothing wrong with this beer. However, it doesn't really do anything for me either. It is really just a premium lager with some honey."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable! I could easily quaff this beer all night, especially with the 4.5%. I think as I drank it I wasn't able to pick up the mellow honey flavors as well. Worth a try, I might have this one again, not sure if I liked it enough though. Cheers!"
"pretty good drinkability, definatly a sessionable beer be it a weekend party or just mowin the lawn on a hot summer day. id take this over any macro, but not by much. definatly wouldnt seek it out again."
"D- maybe I am reminisicing of my college days... However this is a drinkable craft beer. The theme contributes to an easy drinking session. Very crisp, very light, very feasible semi-craft like experience"
"Drinkability: Pleasant and not too heavy. High marks"
"Taste, big letdown. Too sweet. Man, honey should not dominate the taste buds. No hopping. Is this like a nu-mead? Or maybe get some stronger malt so the honey isn't so prolific (or whatever is causing the sweetness almost cloying). You can't even get used to it halfway through. Expensive and not too likeable."
"Decently drinkable with its low abv and quick finish. Still not something I'd look to have more of though."
"I have had many label versions of this over the years, so they must be doing something right as far as beer sales and investing in marketing. Pours a deep gold, little head. Smell and taste has a tinge of sweetness and honey. Not much body but overall a pretty drinkable beer. This is a step up from the macro's, has more flavors and body, but not by much."
"This beer is good, if not overtly remarkable. It wont explode your taste buds with overbearing 100+ IBU bitterness... and that's a GOOD thing. Dundee Honey Brown is a solid ""every mans"" beer that enthusiasts and casual observers alike can enjoy. It is one of the beers I keep on hand at most times."
"There's really nothing remarkable about this one. It's cheap, seems pretty easy to brew, but it usually satisfies me when I'm drinking it with some sort of light food or just watching a game. Solid."
"Pours deep golden with a suggestion of amber, with nice white head. Nose is soft with some honey and a light biscuity/toasty quality. On the palate this beer is medium to light bodied with more of the biscuit and honey character, but is still light on the flavor profile - result is very good drinkability. Not a bad session beer, or something that I would consider with breakfast (biscuits of course)."
"Overall, an affordable, sessionable beer. Would make a nice ""transition"" beer for macro-beer drinkers to enter the craft beer world"
"Poured from the bottle with average head, no lacing. Clear light bronze/honey color. Could easily pick up the honey from both smell and taste. It was a very unique beer, unlike anything I had tried before, however I didn't particularly like it. I liked the idea of adding honey, and it had a somewhat soothing texture to it, but overall it was not very good. I guess it's just a strange beer that doesn't do it for me."
"The flavor is a weak malt component with a better the meh hop edge that I would describe as being similar or slight better than the best BMC. The honey sweetness reminds me that there's more malt and really I could better describe this as being closer to Yuengling with honey. The mouth feel is good, fizzy and thick and not too watery. Over all drinkable, but just so."
"To be fair, I had this beer straight from the bottle, no pour (although I have had it before). Smells sweet but not necessarily like honey to me, then a bit of maltiness. The taste was light grainy malt mostly, and again a touch of sweetness that approached a honey flavor but wasn't quite there. The beer doesn't taste bad, there's just not much there. Not as thin as I expected, nice crisp finish. It's drinkable, but it's the kind of beer you drink when you're not paying attention."
"Drinkability is ok, I can put down a couple before the sweetness really starts becoming too much, with nothing to balance it out."
"D- uhhhh i finished it. that should count for something, right? that will be my last."
"D: OK. Too sweet to score any better."
"Crisp mouthfeel, tingly and dry. Very bubbly. Tasty beer, not overly complex, but fairly drinkable."
"Nice clean flavor, mostly honey and a little malt. Golden color with a little bit of head. Overall well balanced and pleasing-not knock your socks off bitter, not too complex, but a good summer kick back kind of beer."
"12 oz bottle from gift pack to glass. Amber color, smells sweet but I didn't really pick up on 'honey'. Taste is pretty one-dimensional, mellow malty sweetness, really no hops or any bitter to balance it out. Somewhat drinkable but gets boring after several sips."
"For a beer that I drank in college, it is a good rememberence of good times I've had and beer that I drank. I think it should be given another chance, every beer deserves another sip...."
"great alternative to sam adams or blue point toasted lager, especially with the price difference. $9.99/12 pack"
"A very drinkable lager which, although not full of flavor, makes a really good session beer and a great alternative to any macro you might usually seek out. Give this a try."
"Value: I've seen this priced at over $8.00 a six pack. I think not."
"D: Not a bad brew and I would definitely take it over many other lesser beers. It's probably better to drink this one a little on the colder side, but it would definitely be refreshing under the right circumstances."
"And old favorite from college still good after all these years. The honey smell is apparent out of the bottle, think and sweet along with some caramel malt. Pours a, well, honey-colored amber with about 2 inches of head in a pint glass, which fairly quickly recedes down to about half an inch, leaving no lace, and then stays for a while. Flavor approximately matches the smell, with just a little bit of green grass in the aftertaste as well. Thicker than your average lager in its mouthfeel. Not a lot of obvious carbonation. Has a lot of the characteristics I'd ordinarily associate with a brown ale, but somewhat lighter. No hop bitterness to speak of, and goes down smooth. I like it as an interesting substitute for either a lager or a brown ale, and on top of that it's dirt cheap."
"Pours a yellow color that has a bit of orange to it and is clear. Forceful pour produces less than a finger of white head that receeds fast but laces a bit on the way down. Slight bit of malt in the nose blended with a sweetness that I am assuming to be the honey addition. Slight bit of sulfur twang in there as well in the end of the aroma. Taste is a let down, it has a lingering sweetness and that is about all that the taste has to offer. Not malty sweet, but honey sweet mostly. Finish is crisp, feel is light and carb is right on. It is easy to drink and you could probably session the heck out of this beer if you enjoy the honey sweetness. Once was enough for me."
"Thin, clean white head, the foam not dense enough to prevent a swift dissipation, no real lacing to be had. Clear, mostly transparent copper red to orange color, lightens a good bit towards the rims. The nose bursts with sweet corn syrup, honeyed oats and then orange peel, burnt caramel and a grittier graininess, full nostril presence in terms of pushing outwards but ends up hollow. Medium-bodied, close to fluffy carbonation adds to the body, drier with a bitter, metallic ring, especially at the finish. The honey, corn syrup not as dominant here, at least in terms of ratcheting up the sweetness. Apricot and peach pit notes are nice, minute touch of mixed citrus, buttered English muffins. I mean, it's alright, but not sure why someone would really choose to drink it per se."
"These go down easy and are actually mild enough on the palate to have more than one of. Not too exciting, but drinkable. The beer actually burps quite pleasantly ..."
"Overall I didn't expect much from this beer and it pretty much hit the mark. Meh."
"Poured from a 12 bottle to a pilsner style glass. Little to no head on this brew and directly after pouring there is very noted carbonation coming to the top. Sweet, sugary aroma with very lite mouthfeel. Taste is sugary syrup sweet, small hints of honey and biscuit notes, finishes quite dry. It would be pretty easy to drink a few of these with some salty or spicey food. Not a bad beer something to have on hand for the BMC drinkers in your life."
"dr. Goes down okay, not offensive, but there are lots of choices out there."
"Notes: Perhaps, like all the rest of the beers in this mixed pack, a bit off-style, but probably the most drinkable of the beers I have had from this brewery. Cheers."
"Pours a honey golden color in the glass with a white froth. Simply and straight forward, this beer shows some caramel, sweet honey, and grains. This really is a simple beer that I can easily see myself drinking a few off during a summer BBQ. Nothing special here, but easy to drink. Would go great with honey-BBQ ribs or even orange chicken."
"an easy beer to drink"
"The head is thick, but doesn't retain well. The beer has a decent, not overpowering smell. No real aftertaste to speak of. No strong tannins. The sweetness and flavor are appropriate for the style. The color is slightly lighter than most honey brown ales"
"D - Very easy drinking beer but not much character. Nice beer for Sunday football."
"This is an ok beer that goes down fairly smooth and has some definite honeycomb sweetness to it. Taking a whiff is like smelling a warm buttermilk biscuit that has been lathered with sweet sticky honey. The sweetness comes out in the taste, which isn't much more than your average lager. Mouthfeel and drinkability were alright."
"Great beer! Golden light brown. Sweet malty husk notes hit the palate with moderate carbonation. Honey coats the palate during the after taste and lingers for 15 seconds. Def. a great session beer! Its def. a step above the macros! Perfer it straight from the bottle and or on tap. p.s. rochester NY baby!"
"Pours a clear copper with a small white head. Very subdued aromas of light malts. The honey comes through on the palate but not the nose. Light, sweet maltiness, not much in the way of hops. Body is thin. Overall its not bad but neither is it interesting."
"D: YOu can pound these back like there is no tomorrow if that is what you want to do. THere is zero I mean zero complexity to this brew."
"though i've never had a 'honey' beer before, i didn't know what to expect. this beer is unbearable for me to drink. it's way too sweet and not in a good way."
"D- This is a pretty drinkable beer. I can tell it is marketed more toward the BMC crowd with all their beers from this brewery being watery going with a BMC stance on things. I almost enjoyed this beer a little to much but nice beer to sip on inbetween the big boys."
"Pours a honey like color like an ice tea with a nice one finger head that is a very slight off white. The smell is of a sweet roasted malt backbone with a honey presence and a little caramel. The taste is of the sweet roasted malt backbone with honey and a sugary presence. The taste was a little watery but a little too sweet. The mouthfeel was moderate carbonation and a little slick. Overall it is very drinkable but it leaves you wanting more flavor. Other honeys have been a thicker fuller taste without the sweetness."
"It's sweet, malty, but I'm not sure I would identify the honey. Not a lot of hops, and it feels watery overall. Very drinkable to start, but the sweetness tends to become cumulative over time. I think this would be a good beer with food, but on its own it drags."
"Cheers"
"D - Easy drinking, has a little bit something to make it above average but could go a little higher with some effort."
"Number three from my mixed 12 pack of Dundee beers. Yellow with about a 1"" head. Smell is all malt. The taste is pretty nice actually. I drank this one late in the evening when I was getting tired and about ready to call it an evening, and this was a good beer to get ready for bed on. Nicely sweet. Not too much carbonation. A nice ""last beer of the evening - I'm going to bed"" beer. Would mix nicely with a slice of pie when you get home and are a little peckish before bed."
"Taste: There is also a sweetness to this beer but almost a little too sweet. Pretty good taste but lacks much complexity and a little too sweet to drink a lot of."
"light and drinkable."
"D- Not bad but not one to buy again."
"I drank this all the time while living in Rochester--it was always brewed recently, and tasted quite different from the bottle I am reviewing here (bought in a package store in CT). Some of the flavors were there, but tasted watered down. Moe importantly, the mouthfeel was watery--not the robust creaminess I had come to expect. Overall, outside of the Rochester area, I don't know that I need to try this again."
"Mediocre as far as craft beers go, falling in easily with the likes of macro ""craft"" offerings such as the Michelob brand, but easy-drinking and an inexpensive, more flavorful alternative to many of the blander offerings out there in the same price range."
"Drinkability: I'll have the one.... but this is nothing special."
"D- Meh. If it isn't cheap, it isn't worth it."
"This warmed copper coloration beer pours with a retentive head that keeps a fair amount as it reduces. The beer has the aroma of a sweet hopes that gives a hint of honey. As the first sip of the beer hits the taste buds it lights up a great balance of hops and malt with tones of honey, slight coriander. Overall a good beer to have on a warm summer day."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle.. Has a golden, light brownish color with a small head. Aroma is slightly sweet, very mild. Good taste. Mild and slightly sweet, refreshing. Medium bodied in mouth and very drinkable. Overall this is my go to low cost beer."
"Overall, pretty good, not the best honey lager... but good."
"D - Really drinkable, although the metallic taste could get a little vexing. I like this beer a lot though, I'd say it's definitely sessionable."
"m/d - Not sticky but there is a fair amount of body to this beer that when combined with it's distinct sweetness might make this beer best left for a cool summer evening rather than a hot afternoon. Highly drinkable, unique and accessible to non-beer geeks with a friendly label and twist off cap. My only beef is it is in no sense of the word brown and that identification might make it a little less likely to get picked up by someone looking for something new but scared of ""dark"" beers."
"drinkability is good - a refreshing lager and priced right - a good gateway craft beer"
"Honey gold with fluffy white head that leaves sugary cotton lacing. A mild assortment of honey, hops, wheat, and light caramel in the nose. Light wheat flavors, honey, slight candy that dissolves into processed sugar. A light lager with mild notes of honey to add a twist to the usual fizzy corn brew that most people drink. Not terrible but not impressive either."
"D: Back in my college days, this was the beer we splurged on when we wanted something ""good"". How times have changed. This beer is average in every aspect. They go down easy, but not something I could drink on a regular basis."
"Drinkability is high. Sweet but not cloying. Overall it is nondistinctive, muddy, but pleasantly like cream soda. This is about as good as it gets for a cheap-as-dirt brownish lager. A great value."
"It poured a light amber color with a finger of white head. The aroma had a sweetness to it that was a bit hard to point out. For the taste I was expecting some honey flavor, it was just barely there. Perhaps I got spoiled on my mead trip a few years ago and had unrealistic expectations. It goes down the gullet very easy and finishes clean. It's a nice summer fun beer."
"Drinkability is great on this beer. It is a nice beer in a can with some awesome crisp, refreshing qualities to it without overbearing taste buds. Might be one of the best beers to drink a 6 or 12 pack of cans on a hot summer day doing some lawn work."
"Drinkability- Light and sweet. Refreshing and accessible."
"T + M + D: Soft maltiness... the honey flavour is pleasing. It's maybe a little 'artificial' tasting - like Golden Grahams or the like, but it's certainly honey. It has a nice crispness to it, with a lighter body, so it does well as a refreshing warm day drink - I'm having it on a cooler rainy evening, though, so that's just an assumption! ;) Light alcohol, easy session choice. Not the most extraordinary or even flavourful beer, but sometimes it could be just the thing. It's certainly a good 'gateway' candidate."
"A good beer for macro lovers, but a little lacking."
"The taste is very mild but fairly nice, rather like a more full-bodied basic pale lager but with noticeable grain, a hint of pine and hay, hint of brown sugar, and a light but clear alcoholic quality. I noticed no honey in the taste, although as mentioned the aroma had a hint of it. It's mostly sweet with a faint bitterness in the end. Ultimately it's little more than a basic, rather thin, watery pale lager with a light caramel-brown sugar quality. It' fairly drinkable, though."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, particularly if it is a little sweetness you desire on a hot day; not for me, however"
"A little too sweet for me. It would be pretty drinkable if it wasn't as sweet."
"It was a pretty drinkable beer. It has room for improvement. But it is still a quality beverage."
"The overwhelming sensation is cloying sweetness and watery mouthfeel. The aroma is that of nuts and honey. Flavor is dominated by a sweetness that is underpinnd by a wandering maltiness. I am glad I tried it but I think it needed more malt dryness and honey aroma and maybe a touch of carawheat."
"D - An easily drinkable lawnmower beer. Enjoyable is certainly a way to describe this."
"Drinkability - Could easily have more then a few of these in a night. Easy drinker but not much in the way of taste."
"Last weekend fellow BA Das Freak showed up with the Dundee craft pack sampler. After tasting the PA,IPA,Porter and Pale Bock Lager I thought we had stumbled onto something above average, then came the Honey Brown Lager. At first I thought it had a funky after taste but it doesn't wait until after. When my dog broke wind I thought I was at a beer pairing in hell. Sorry for the negativity but if I can save one BA from this fate it will have been worth it."
"D Excellent, and this is the point. I believe this beer to be made to be drinkable and it delivers."
"D - Easy drinkable beer. So sweet that I would think this has potential as a summer drinker on the deck. ABV is low and manageable."
"drinkability: An interesting novelty beer. Shows much promise, but doesn't deliver on it. Worth a try, but not a re-visit."
"Don't drink and review."
"An OK brew but not one I anticipate revisiting. And not sure why they call it a 'Brown' as the color is golden and the malts are simpler."
"If I look at this as a light lager, I'm pretty pleased. It tastes pleasant, doesn't pack much alcohol, and is light bodied. The price is pretty decent still, although this used to be quite a bit cheaper. It was $4.99 a sixer not that long ago. $11 for a 12 pack is not bad, and it's something the guests won't mind. This serves its purpose well. Off the top of my head, I want to say this is preferable to the similar Leinie's Honeyweiss."
"I would not call myself an experienced beer drinker at this point but am learning as I go. I originally purchased this brew from pure looks. It looked appealing and I can appreciate a ""sweet"" beer. I purchased a 6-pack. I had nothing against the beer on the first go. The next night when I decided to polish off the pack, the honey sweetness really kicked in. Now, I do like a brew that is sweet but this one in particular is too strong with the honey. It's drinkability is smooth, more like a light beer. I would not put this in the category of a brown ale. If it were to be this sweet, I would like to see it with more hops to balance it out. It's smell does have a hint of honey but does not brace you for the ""honey overload"" that it will give you. Good at first but would recommend lighting up on the honey flavor!"
"D 4.0 - I dig this one, I would not call it ""brown"" but I do like the honey addition. Almost overdone in the honey, but tolerable for 1 or 2 brews.... I would home brew a fuller body less sweet version of this and love it! (This is why I bought it, I am working on a recipe idea ;-)"
"D, I find this drinkable goes well with pretzels. nothing extraordinary but a nice alternative to a standard lager"
"Here's a pretty good domestic beer. It's fairly comparable to Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss, but it has more honey flavor than Leinie's, and it's a bit darker. I'd give this beer to somebody who's looking for an alternative to their mainstay American lager."
"The best part about this is the way it looks. Everything else is just average. It's your run of the mill, assembly line beer. I also think its a little confused. The style listed is an amber, but the beer calls itself a brown. Doesn't look like either or really taste like either. The only thing that saves this offering is the honey adding a touch of character to the nose and taste."
"Overall: Pretty much what it claims to be a relativly sweet lager that is good on occasion"
"The score would be higher it the beer didn't look or smell so crappy. I expected the worst, but this was a good beer."
" D: Its very drinkable but i dont think i would every buy it agian its just to bland not enough taste"
"T - The mouthfeel is thicker than water and vaguely sticky like honey. The taste of honey is the leading flavor. A very sweet beer and mild. Kind of elements that I like."
"I feel a little bit bad reviewing this so highly but can't help it. I really enjoyed this for some reason. Appearance was light/amber with your average macro lager aroma. The taste however was nicely balanced and pleasant. Nice balance of malt and hops with a bit of sweetness. It wasn't braggot sweet but just a bit of it came through from the honey. Mouthfeel was average and drinkability was good for me because of the taste."
"update: this time around the honey really seems to stick out as an aftertaste. fresher batch maybe? still very plain beer with honey thrown in"
"D - Respectable presentation for a honey ale. Delicious and refreshing."
"D: This is an easy drinker. I could see myself throwin back a whole six pack of this quite easily. A pretty tasty mild light beer. I'd recommend it."
"Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and this is an easy beer to put away. Could be a good session to start someone new to craft beer on."
"D - This is definitely a Macro drinkers micro. Very sweet honey flavor is about the only thing that differentiates it from other lagers. I remember this being one the first beers that caused me to become interested in ""better beer."" I also gave it to my now roommate freshman year, and it was the first beer he had in college. So fond memories from a mediocre beer that seems as though it were a macro crossed with root beer and honey."
"I'll be bock!!"
"Unimpressive? Sure. Drinkable? Most definitely. This beer, unlike other mass produced lagers, actually tastes really good. Yes, perhaps a bit sweet, but this is a great beer to go to after having one or two already if you want to mellow out. Nothing super special, but not deserving of the bad rap, I feel. I'm a huge proponent of wildly complex, expensive, artsy beers, but sometimes, you don't want a Quad or an Double IPA. Sometimes, all you want is something that goes down easy and tastes good too. There are definitely better session beers out there, but this isn't bad."
"i bought a sampler pack to review all the dundee beers, and thought this would be a good place to start as this offering was the only one i had previously sampled."
"I found this beer a bit too unbalanced and thick for my liking. It seemed to lack crispness and contain a bit to much of what I would call ""processed"" flavors. Based on what the bottle and box said I should expect, I wouldn't not have guessed that this brew would taste like it did. It's not particularly bad, but I don't think it's too special, either."
"D: Overall, I'm a fan of the body, but anything this sweet is off-putting and makes me glad that there are only two in the variety pack I just got. The flavor isn't terrible, but 12 ounces of it seems to last too long."
"This beer poured a orange-copper collor with a two-finger head that didn't last too long. The smell is sweet with malts and honey. The taste starts off with some sweetness that reflects the smell with a tiny bit of hops in the middle and a bit of honey in the backend. The beer itself is a little watery with a decent amount of fine carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer and is a good starter beer for people who aren't sure if they like beer or not."
"No bitter after taste, but it is perhaps a bit watery."
"I haven't had one for a while, but I imagine it would be much too sweet for me now. Still, a very easy-drinking pint. As others have pointed out, it's sort of funny that it's called ""brown," as it clearly is not. In a pint glass, it pours a deep orange sort of color."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall- Honey and brown sugar not much else. Bland."
"Pours a clear, light amber color. 1/5 inch head with slight retention and no lacing. Smells of strong malt or grain. Fits the style, well enough. Tastes of a clean lager with a stronger body. There's just the slightest either skunkiness or perhaps adjunct in the flavor as well. The malts are relatively weak, but noticeable in the aftertaste. Smooth, average crispness, really low carbonation. Overall, a decent, more full bodied lager."
"Pours a clear amber into my pint glass with a finger-width white head which quickly bubbles to a very thin cap. Aroma is malty and sweet, with lots of honey, caramel, grain, butterscotch, toffee, a hint of sweet hay. Mouthfeel is extremely thin, a little sticky, with medium carbonation, but refreshing - I loved this beer's mouthfeel. Taste is very sweet, same as nose but not as intense, very mild, with a creaminess in the back that is very inoffensive, lots of malt with little if any hop bitterness to speak of. The taste does not support the great texture of the beer. The only hindrance to drinkability would be boredom, as this beer is a little bland. Overall, this is a solid brew with no huge flaws, it just doesn't have the oomph factor it needs to be a great brew."
"Bland base with a an obnoxiously artificial sweetness makes for a pretty crappy lager. This used to be a 'beer of choice' in high school versus the macros...thank God that my palate has matured."
"D- Not overly bad in drinkability but the flavor prevents me from having anymore."
"Pours more pale than I expected. Not much on the nose, a little bit of honey malt. No hops. Taste is very malty with a touch of honey but overall not impressive. Beer is done in for me by a stinging overcarbonation. Stay away from this one."
"I remember buying this a lot right when I got into craft beer. I think my taste has evolved since then, which is good, but the things that drew me to this beer are still there."
"Nothing special, but an easy drinking, serviceable quaff."
"(rated Jul 22, 2008)"
"Taste is a subtle malt with little to no hops. The lingers one the back of the beer to give it an okay finish.. Overall the finish is clean with just a touch of honey. A good game beer."
"Light golden brown. Hint of white head.Sweet/grainy aroma,no hint of hops.Mild wheaty taste with a ton of sticky sweetness. Very thin, medium carbonation. A lighter, refreshing beer.I get this sometimes when on sale,nice to take to a party and share with the Macro crowd."
"Pours a light golden brown color body, with a low-medium white head, that is diminishing. Has an aroma of hops, and some nuttiness? Taste has some nuttiness. Has a light body, and a lightly hoppy taste. A nice clean finish to the beer."
"Has a very beautiful appearance. Color is a rich amber. Did not produce much head when poured. The smell of honey is very slight. The taste of this beer is that of malt and hops. The honey taste is most noticeable on the finish. I was expecting a bit more ""honey"" and was slightly dissappointed as it came across as a regular lager that was slightly sweeter than others I've tried."
"It has a great color to the body. This beer poured with a bronze almost gold color. It had a great head two and a half fingers of head with a lot of retainability. Tight off white lace. The aroma is sweet and candy like with just a little bit of fruity hops to it. It has a sweet and slimy mouthfeel. The flavor is crisp and sweet at the same time. It has a bitter cady like taste."
"I had the chance to try this one on-tap at T. Ruggs Tavern the same say I had earlier had it out of a bottle downtown. Off the tap this brew was indeed a honey gold color but it was a little darker than out of the bottle. The head was moderate and foamy, slightly gold tinted and it displayed good retention and some decent lacing. The aroma was malty, grainy and slightly sweet with honey all subtly blended together. The flavors were sweet with honey at first (as opposed to caramel or chocolate malt). This then became grainy and dry with a crisp finish but the hops profile was lacking. The mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation good. It was still nothing great, but it was better on tap."
"Probably a little bit tame for a true beer geek, but this can be a life saver in beer challenged areas. Put it in the same grouping you would Yuengling."
"I bought this hoping this would be close to my much loved Barbar, but after smelling this beer I knew I was going to be dissapointed . It smells like an average euro lager, there is a vague hint of honey but it's barely there. Pored a nice looking yellow with a basic lager head, nothing bad to say about it's appearance. As for the taste, I can't find anything wrong with this beer but I really have a hard time saying it's great. Lightflavored and pretty crisp, the honey didn't really hit me till afterwards, and when it did it was only vague. There's really nothing wrong with this beer, I just think I was expecting too much."
"D: It's very sessionable and quite pleasant, if a bit simple and uninspiring. A nice offering, considering the price and what they were apparently going for."
"Would recommend anyone to at least try. Might buy again but definitely not often. Don't let the ratings or the critics ruin the beer for you. It's definitely not ""awful"". Don't expect the full flavor of a traditional ""lager", though."
"D - Very. It's super easy to drink this one."
"Perhaps the best thing about this beer is the commercials way back when it came out, with the little tiki statue and the slogan ""Beware the Beer God!"" When I was a kid and saw that I thought a beer with honey - can't wait to try that. Oh how naive youth is. I see the label's changed...but the beer still sucks. Pours a darkish gold with a one-finger head that died quickly. Some sweet malt smells, honey and caramel, mixed with minor citric hops. Watery and slick, thin-bodied, a mellow hop falvor and a not very sweet malt taste. Goes down easy, too easy. not worth having."
"D - Not that enjoyable. Won't be buying this again for sure"
"Not wonderful but not too hard to drink either. It goes down rather easy and I'd drink another or two, but I could think of better tasting bears to drink had I the choice."
"D - It's an interesting style...with the honey and all...really didn't like the sweet after taste"
"Update: 4/5/14. Picked up some 24 oz tall boys for 1.69. Now there is something to get excited about."
"Overall not bad, a light lager with a pinch of hops and a touch of honey. I am not sure which one dominated, though I would have liked to see both be a little stronger. Still, not terrible at all."
"A nice mix of malt and honey flavors lend an enjoyable sweetness that never gets cloying. The honey really helps smooth out the mouthfeel. Highly drinkable - a very nice session brew. At 9.99 a 12 pack, its a great deal if you are looking for a smooth easy-drinking lager with some flavor."
"This beer doesn't look like much. Sort of a straw color, with very little head, absolutely no lacing. Smell is very grainy. Taste is relatively sweet, not too bad really. A touch of honey along with a touch of hops. It's very carbonated, and very easy to drink. An excellent summertime beer, tastes excellent out on a boat fishing. I would definitely drink these again for the price."
"Definitely recommended if your just looking for something different."
"I read the name honey brown and thought it would be just a little darker. I was really let down with this beer. Not something I will be drinking again."
"D - I woundn't drink it with a meal unless I needed something sweet to contratc the dish. It is more of an end of day/afternoon beer, especially if a sunny patio is calling you. An it's low alcohol level and light feel means that if you wish, couple will work nicely for you. But one thing is for sure, I you're not a honey fan then don't even try out of curiousity. You have been warned."
"I remember this beer being around for a while, one of the first non-BMC beers I tried back in the day. Revisiting it, it isnt too spectacular. Barely any honey taste at all, but it's smooth and heavier bodied than the usual cheap beers."
"Drinkability however is pretty top notch. A six pack of this could go pretty quickly, but yeah, for an amber beer, this is a good New York brew to get your hands on."
"Some new notes... had one on 12/29/09 as part of a Christmas pack of beers. More honey flavor that I remembered, on the front of the sip. I'm surprised, pretty solid... I figured I'd rate this one a little lower as I drink more and more different beers that I love, but if anything it gets a slight boost up."
"Id give this to someone whos afraid to venture away from the mainstream beers. One for price and two for the drinkablilty which is was most novices look for in the first place. Its good. For the price. I wouldnt buy it for $6.00 a six for instance."
"If you are forced to drink a Dundee beer, this one isn't too painful, though I wouldn't recommend anything from the line except if you are stranded in Upstate New York with no alternatives and you are in extreme need of a beer."
"D: drinkablility limited to 1 or 2 due to sweetness."
"Pours a clear, rusty amber with hay sunshine highlights. Very little head right after the pour that quickly dissipates to nothing. The aroma has notes of cramel, honey, and white bread in an overall soft aroma. The taste starts with soft white breads that slowly reveal the dripping honey that leads to a soft, bready malt finish wth some light white tea hops. The palate is very easy and balnced, ending in a very balanced honey lager. Very underrated beer in my opinion."
"The beer seems unbalanced and confused. I feel like this one is an over processed brew that was created on auto pilot. Packaging is probably the biggest seller of this beer not the contents itself."
"Well I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. Somewhat of a below average beer. Decent sessionability as one would be with low abv and drinks like water."
"nothing offensive but nothing great"
"Mouthfeel is fine and drinkability is good but it would be too sweet to drink all night."
"The taste was very mild, semisweet. It was smooth and had a light bitterness at the end. Not a beer I would drink again if I had a choice."
"A good beer to go to when thirsty after mowing the lawn or something. But if you're looking for something complex with an attitude, pass on this one."
"D: Really good. I could enjoy, and indeed have enjoyed, several of these in one session."
"It wasn't bad but this one seems to drink better cold right out of the fridge. Has lots of carbonation."
"Poured a dark golden color with almost no head. Almost no bitterness or hop flavor but still a strong honey taste to it. Pretty easy to drink, almost like a light beer. Very light and unimpressive. This beer is like most of their products: watery and mass produced bad beer."
"Actually feels creamy for a lager, closer to a pub ale feel. Crisp enough. Not terrible but wouldn't be my go-to choice. It's a honey-soaked macro lager."
"Terribly under-rated beer, that is actually quite drinkable. I hadn't had one in quite a while, and I was bit surprised at how smooth and balanced it is."
"Poured a very pale amber color, just a shade darker than golden, with a little head and some nice lacing. It had a nice scent, fairly weak, with malt and biscuit tones and a bit of honey scent that helped. Good taste, descent lager, better than a macro, and the honey flavor added a fair bit to it. It went down smooth, a nice thirst quencher."
"I don't know this isn't terrible but it just doesn't offer much. I remember drinking this in college, it was better than swill and didn't cost much more than a sixer of Bud. Anyway aroma is really not present except for a faint scent that lets you know this is beer. Pours a light copper with a decent white head and some proper lacing, not bad. Slightly creamy and full on the palate with a smooth clean finish again not bad. Flavor is of a crisp lager rather bland but there is a nice touch of honey sweetness after the swallow. Mellow and easy to drink, don't expect anything great."
"I'd say this was an average drinker. Nothing interesting stands out at all, although I haven't had many honey lagers I expected more honey taste."
"Overall an easy drinking session beer."
"D- Yuck!! I am having a hard time putting this oe down, and may be dumping it. I would not recommend this beer, the sampler, or any other Dundee beer."
"Drinkability: Bleh! I'm slowly working my way through the JW Dundee's Box of Horrors, and this one, so far, is the worst of the lot. Again: bleh!"
"The drink is very smooth with plenty of gummy sweetness holding on and hanging around. Reminds me of St Arnold's Fancy Lawnmower: a sweet easy-drinking lager. All sweet with very little bitter and light carbonation. Great beer for hot summer days. A little weak in flavor overall but definitely honey sweet and a good summer lager. Could use a little more body. But a beautiful beer to pour in a pint glass."
"A clean, soft lager. Not much in the flavor department, but where it lacks interesting flavors it also lacks all potentially unpleasant flavors. A good no-brainer; a good flagship for a brewery that's always seemed to me to be more interested in selling beer than brewing it."
"Not a bad beer. In fact it was the first case that was ever purchased for me...about ten or so years ago. Decent session beer."
"D: OK session beer. A safe bet for someone who doesn't want to stray too far from the macro path."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium head on a lovely amber body. Smell was unremarkable, nothing to mention. However, the honey sweet taste and smoothness were excellent. Very easy to drink, with a nice aftertaste. Surprisingly good, despite it's overall grade here. I could drink this all day. Well done."
"Wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this one..."
"Pours as the name suggests, a honey brown color with an average white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is a bit faint, some sweet caramel malt, honey, and a light clove spiciness. The taste is sweet, honey malt, a bit bready, not much else. The feel is light and well carbonated, finishes with a somewhat smooth malty sweetness. No real strong flavors and a sweet honey smoothness makes this brew quite drinkable. The sweetness is not cloying, works well. A refreshing beer for a hot day."
"overall, this is a fair brew but nothing to seek out"
"mouthfeel is crisp, macro lagery, nothing super special, i would buy again over some beers, but only bought this time around because it was on sale."
"Generous two-finger pure white, frothy head sits on an effervescent honey-golden body head that simmers to a single finger... sweet honey scents couple with malts in a formidable yet inoffensive pairing that is somewhat distinctive... substantial palate, like an old-school lager, meant for weighty significance moreso than pure drinkability--and yet this could play both the serious actor as well as a party extra six-pack... versatile... malty in the back, honey up front, clove in the middle--the balance is unique and refreshing, like a liquid graham cracker (and I know that does NOT sound appetizing)... safe to say, this rating will well exceed the respect of the masses, but Dundee's Honey Brown was my first beer love and though I've seen many others since 1997, I keep coming back to the sweet maltiness that I drank--sometimes warm to ward away roommates--during those wonderful college days... this was the beer in hand when I innocently talked to my future wife for the first time in Bill Hess's Tavern's basement, the beer I carried in a backpack at Bloomsburg block parties, and still the treat on humid summer nights like this one, inexpensive and casually impressive... I'm biased, but we are allowed one guilty pleasure on this site, I hope--it IS beer, after all"
"Drinkability: I could drink this over and over. Light like a bitter with a good honey flavor."
"D: I have a place in my beer drinker's heart for Honey Brown. This along with Pete's got me drinking stuff other than macros and when I couldn't afford German offerings around here. As far as drinkability, you really can't drink too many. I don't know why, nor can explain it. It just overwhelms you if you try to drink this like a macro (considering it is the same price), just sits heavy and not too comfortable. Not a bad beer and I find myself slumming with it every now and again."
"Notes: Honey brown is very refreshing, clean and simple. Not bad at all for the price."
"I'll still drink a couple for the nostalgia factor, but I've moved on to bigger & better beers."
"D: Not offensive, easy drinkinging, ABV makes it so you can put down a number of these. Good value for a decent beer but for taste versus price I'd take a macro to save my money for what little extra taste you get from this beer."
"Quite drinkable and all that, but nothing real special."
"D - Nice. I could easily go through a 12er. Great session beer."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and mellow brew, whose only downfall is a lack of concentration. the brew comes off a bit watery overall, but the flavors present do compose a pleasant brew."
"all in all not a bad effort, but for full disclosure it's the only honey beer I've tried."
"A clearish copper brew with a fizzy tan head. Nose has some grainy malts and some artificial honey sweetness. The clove honey seems to cover up most flavors. A light body heavy with carbonation. A drinkable brew, but needs either less honey or stronger malts and hops."
"Honey beer seems to be the big thing. I have been trying some different ""honey"" beers. Of course this one being a macro brew I wasn't really impressed. Poured a pure honey color, or maybe I just had honey on the brain. Smelled faintly of malt and a bit of honey. Taste is bitey with minimal hop balance and some honey, a little malty. I don't think Winnie the Pooh will go crazy over this one."
"Not too bad for what it is. A touch sweet for my taste, but that is what they were after, I suppose."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost soapy. Drinkability is good, especially at 4.5% ABV, but the sweetness would prevent me from drinking very many of these at one sitting."
"Poured a nice three finger head which quickly dissipated. Nice light amber color. Smell is hops and a sweetness, honey or malt, can't really tell. This was a blast from the past. I remember this from the early 90's. In PA, at the time, this beer was in all of the bars, kind of a step up from Coors Light and Miller Lite. An above average beer versus BMC, but not something I would revist or seek out to purchase."
"Drinkability: For what it is, it is one of the better macro brews and for only $4.39/6 pack, it is very easy to drink!"
"All in all, a very drinkable brew. Clean, smooth, refreshing. Probably a good session beer, but it's not gonna find a permanent home in my fridge. That being said, I would not rule out the possibility of a return visit or two."
"On a side note, it was definitely a great beer for the price. $8 for a 12pack at Meijer (a Michigan-area grocery+ store). Seems like a pretty good deal."
"This beer is a steal. Perhaps not the first thing that comes to mind with this style but it's one hell of a bargain, so I'm sure it'll find it's way back into my fridge again soon. You can find it in my neck of the woods for 7.50 a 12 pack."
"While I don't recall this one ever being a top of the line brew, I certainly do recall it being far better than this. It was at least marginally drinkable and respectable in the pas and is just plain bad now. High Falls took the time and effort to craft some decent to very good brews for it's ""Craft Mix Pack," so why couldn't they take the time to make this one a better brew? Avoid."
"I think this would be an excellent session beer. Light and crisp for those warm afternoons."
"Overall - I wouldn't buy a sixer of this but I'll try to finish the couple or so that come in the mixed packs just to get to the other Dundee brews."
"D - This ended up more drinkable that I thought. It goes down well and leaves a nice sweet bitterness on the palate."
"Decent beer - better brew than many of my friends buy on a regular basis."
"A very drinkable brew, especially for less than $6 a six-pack. Alas, it is neither good enough or inexpensive enough to become a staple at my house. A classic ""tweener"" beer I'm afraid."
"D - This is an easy drinking beer. I used to drink it alot when I thought it was a huge step up from what most of my college buddies were drinking."
"Drinkablity: A tasty, unique lager. Good sweet to dry balance."
"This beer is somewhat lighter than it's name implies. Not bad for a mass produced American lager. It's similar to other ones, but tastes more grainy, and has a sweetness from the honey flavor. Fairly smooth and easy to drink. When you get bored of your current session beer, this is a nice change of pace."
"Pick this one up if you're in a pinch and desperate for a decent beer."
"This is neither offensive nor arresting, fine beer if cold and one is thirsty, I suppose. No Wow! factor, just decent. It certainly isn't one I'd spend the coin on."
"Taste is pretty similar to the smell, it isn't too far away from a slightly more flavorful macro. For me, there really is no reason to drink this because of the ubiquitous presence of yuengling, but it isn't a bad beer. The sweetness kind of got to me and i wouldn't want another, but it wasn't bad."
"Not a bad brew for the price (very affordable). Rvrn though there is some non-descript balance to it, it's still too sweet for me to ""session""."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer,light side, under 5%ABV!!!Lawn mower beer."
"pored a nice amber brown with a very thin head. you can clearly smell the honey. the first sip i had of this beer i was impressed, i really enjoyed it, but after about the 5th or 6th the sweet honey aftertaste started to get to me and i had to grab my hop devils. I would recommend this beer at a bar or even a 6 pack but no more"
"For the price ($6 for a six-pack), it's a decent beer and better than a macro, but it's nothing special."
"Nice dark golden to amber colored pour with a head that doesn't last. Some malt and honey like sweetness in the smell, but not too much else. Taste is light malty with some honey sweetness kicking in during the aftertaste. It is nicely carbonated, but not too highly, and is very easy drinking and refreshing. I know this isn't a fancy beer, or a very complex one, but it's perfect for easy drinking on a hot day especially. Very likeable if you just want some simple flavor and not something heavy or complex. This is a simple classic that I can enjoy while not wanting to think about the beer."
"I've always enjoyed this beer and as far as I've found it's the best example of a honey beer. I recently had the pleasure of getting it on tap instead of the bottle. It was really amazing. The honey flavor was definitely more pronounced than in the bottle and it went down much smoother as well. I had it served in a pint and the head was reduced from what you generally get out of the bottle."
"From the name, I thought this would be a brown ale, but I now know that is definitely not the case. This is a thoroughly mediocre lager that was worth what I paid for it, but it's not terribly memorable. I can only see getting this when it's on sale, like it was today."
"It pours a dark yellow with very little head and even less lace. Smooth light maltiness with an equally light honey sweetness. Moderate carbonation. Easy to drink. Nice to visit the past while being able to leave it there."
"The money shouldn't matter but this is a steal, not a reason its my favorite but at $9 for a 12 pack, thats just awesome."
"D - This is a good session beer good taste and pretty cheap too"
"JW Dundee's Honey Brown pours a clear bright orange with a thin head. The aroma is grainy with a hint of honey. The flavor is more graininess, with just a bit of sweet malt. I think the ""brown"" part of the name must refer to the color of the bottle, and not the beer."
"LIght body and mouthfeel. Better than your average macros but still uninteresting and bland."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of dark orange, with a off white head - nose of mild hops, slight grass, melon, and malts  taste of sweet corn, some malts, and no honey- body is light, sweet and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of honey(finally), and sweet artificial"
"D: Definitely not one of my favorites. Wouldn't really recommend it"
"Pours a pleasant honey color with very minimal head. As I stick my nose in to take a whiff of this I am immediately smacked in the face by what I can only characterize as an American macro lager with some depth. The aroma is fairly mild, slightly malty and just a touch hoppy. Taste is somewhat better. I do get a bit of macro lager coming through again but with a touch of honey and malt. Mouthfeel is ok, body is light with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is mediocre. Overall this beer just really doesn't appeal to me and I wouldn't recommend it."
"I use to drink this all the time when I thought this was a high end beer for a low price. Not all that bad though. This was very popular in College because people thought they were drinking a better beer than the BMC swill. I guess that it is better than that, but still not very highly recommended."
"D - Goes down easy enough. Basically a fairly bland golden lager."
"The taste has some sweet malt and honey flavour to it but it's very bland. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and it's of medium carbonation but agai, the flavours are very bland. I got this in a mixed 12 pack and I would *not* buy this by the sixer. It's just too ordinary. Give me their Pale or IPA, or their Amber Lager."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but the sweetness becomes cloying after a while. Not too much character to this one other than the honey."
"a favorite choice during my early beer development, acquired a single bottle"
"Smooth and drinkable. Inoffensive. Not something I'd buy again but it seems like they consider it their flagship so it's not too bad."
"All in all, it's a decent beer. Good taste and decent body. Not bad and certainly better than alot of beers out there. I can and have drank them in succession. Definately a good beer for the fridge."
"Final Statement: Not a bad beer at all but another classic example of the a brewery calling their beer a honey brown and it not being brown. I don't get that. Either way, an average boring beer that isn't bad."
"D- I could drink these a lot of the time. Ill buy these again on a regular basis."
"As far as drinkability, Honey Brown was an old go-to beer in college. $3 for a pitcher of Honey Brown? Sure, that'll keep me happy for the night. Now, that my palate for beer is more refined, I find it hard to drink more than one bottle of this. Not an exceptional beer. Not even a good beer. But average."
"Honey colored beer with sweet fresh aroma.Taste is biscuit followed by a sweet honey.Minimal carbonation and very smooth from top to bottom of bottle.This has been one of my favorites when I was younger and I still enjoy it.Got this as part of an assorted JW Dundee craft pack for 20.00 a good buy!!!"
"I've been loving me some browns lately, from Moose Drool to New Castle. I found this one in a six pack of bottles with only 4 left in it and I'm so glad I did. It's super-tasty and an excellent session beer(I could drink these for hours). The only downside was the smell, but I dont expect much from browns. This beer just proves that not all beers need a lot of alcohol to be great."
"this was actually the 2nd high falls brew i ever drank ( i used to drink Genny cream ale 20 yrs ago) before i got to Rochester ; pours a light gold colour w/ a thin head which dissapates quickly leaving little lacing ; not much for aroma, a ""macro"" smell overrides all but a faint waft of a caramely/honey/ even less hoppy aroma ; very thin flavor, Am. lager w/ some sweet caramel/honey flavor lurking deep beneath it all ; a light mouthfeel, yet not dry enough, i feel this beer should be less to match the taste ; on the upside, i could prob. drink a 12 of this easily (tho i'd pref. Bud Light or Corona for my rehydration)...."
"The bottom line: definitely better than a Bud or Coors Light, but really just one step up from a macrobrew. Maybe a good ""gateway"" beer to an appreciation of better brews. But I'm surprised this won any awards... it's slightly above average IMO."
"J.W. Dundee's has always seemed like a macro among micros, but their gold standard in my opinion has always been the Honey Brown. Not too bad, but not impressive enough to keep on hand."
"Not a bad beer, espeically for its price. It pours a nice golden honey color with a white head that seems to stick to the sides of the glass pretty well. It has an aroma of a very sweet malty beer. The taste is the same, very malty and sweet yet smooth. Not too sweet for a beer and not too malty either. Very little hoppy feel if at all. It feels fresh and a nice carbonation makes it very drinkable. The aftertaste is good as well, no sour, no bitter beer face. It is a decent beer, espeically if you're only looking to spend $6 for a 6pack. Other than that, it's not overwhelmingly delicious, but it is definately worth a try at that price."
"Warning: To be given to crossover hopefulls only. If you already like craft beer, this one isnt going to impress you one bit."
"D- The honey flavor is more of an off taste with more of a nougat quality that any fresh honey flavors. There are some lager characteristics that keep this beer dry but the light flavors also makes this beer a bit bland."
"This beer pours a clear yellow-green color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma is of sweet biscuits, and caramel malt. It is a very generic aroma, and very faint as well. The taste is even lighter than the aroma. I keep sipping hoping I will find something, but all I can detect is a light caramel note in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied, but a little thicker than I would expect from a beer with such little taste and aroma. Overall, I am insulted by this beer. It calls itself ""Honey Brown," however, it has no honey in the flavor profile, and it is certainly not brown. I guess the brewers assume I am too stupid to know what honey tastes like, or what brown looks like. Anyway, I assuredly will not drink this beer again."
"From a 12 oz bottle costing $1.79 at Safeway in Eureka, CA this poured a very clear amber that seemed more like apple cider than beer. Very little head and virtually no lacing. Nose of light hops and s little sweetness.. Not much finish. In spite of this it was drinkable."
"I've been glancing at this beer for a while now at my local grocery store and when it went on sale, I thought, eh what the hell. I wasn't really impressed with it overall. It pours fairly well at best. It has a clear golden color with almost no head. Almost no bitterness or hop flavor but still a strong honey taste to it. Pretty easy to drink, almost like a light beer."
"Color is a nice golden-brown. Aroma is malty and has undertones of honey sweetness. Flavor is good, malty, with strong hint of honey, no bitterness or hop component. Smooth, not complex, but refreshing and tasty. This is a good beer for a party or to have with dinner."
"Really nothing special here. It's very sweet w/ honey flavors almost giving it a candy like taste. Also a little too carbonated feel for my liking."
"You can see right through this beer. no smell really, s/light lingering honey taste. Low carbonation, good lawn mowing beer. Not a bad taste after burping. Good session beer, others were right, it does coat the tongue a little. Have at it, crisp, refreshing light beer."
"D: Very drinkable; tastes pretty good overall and is very easy to drink since it is so light."
"D - I guess it's OK. Not a lot of flavour, but certainly easy to drink one of. More than one... I dunno."
"Overall this is about average. I wouldn't turn it down."
"Haven't had this in a few years...and it's still the same. VERY smooth....one of the smoothest ever....and VERY sweet....and NOT hoppy AT ALL, which I personally like. Very nice reddish-brown color, and a nice malty smell to it. I like this brew alot. SO smoooth...as I said...and NOT HOPPY AT ALL!!!! I don't even think there ARE HOPS in this!!! That's ok though. Beer is NOT about all hops. There are many other characteristics to consider...and this is a good one. Sorry I haven't had this in so long...but it came in the Brewmaster's Sampler, and I'm glad! One of my fav. in the variety pack. I can see why this got medals. One must not be a ""hophead"" if you're gonna try this! One must be a ""malthead"" or ""lagerhead"". Give it a try, and you won't be sorry! Again, don't expect the hops though!!!! There's NO bitterness whatsoever in this delightful lager! SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, pleasant, light, with interesting flavor."
"d - easily drinkable and a good session, especially for newbies."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a light brown, forming a 1/2 inch head that quickly faded. No lcaing. The aroma is a mix of sweet malt and light honey. The taste has a grainy/dirty taste up front, then ending with a slightly sweet honey flavor. Nothing complex here. Medium mouthfeel. I can see non-craft beer drinkers enjoying this brew, because this reminds me of a Bud light, with a shot of honey added. Not horrible, but definitely something that I wont be buying again."
"Certainly drinkable and almost sessionable, although this would likely be boring session fare. Would be a good beer for getting a macro swill drinker to try something with a little more colour than piss yellow. Pretty run of the mill brew, theres a lot of better beers out there, and as such ill probably never buy this again. That said it was nice to try it."
"DA: This seems to really drop in quality after a while, it really flattens out and becomes ""old"" quickly."
"12oz brown bottle from their multi 12-pack. Red-amber translucent body with a thin off-white head. Smells of roasty grains and cooked vegetables. Sweet processed honey flavor with hints of roasted malt dominate the flavor, with strong notes of cooked vegetable. Not particularly appetizing. Watery mouthfeel, which doesn't actually help the drinkability much... Not too impressed with this one."
"Was hoping that the honey/sweetness would be a little more prevalent in the taste  although worth a try!"
"Comments: I drank this as an offhand to a Guinness the other day, and the honey sweetness was brought out a lot more."
""
"Drinkability- Not great, not bad."
"this was what i drank as a kid when i wanted something upscale. looks pretty good with a nice amber color. smell is of honey and some sweet caramel malt, a hint of roastiness is present. i don't like much as far as non-malt/hop additions to beer but i do like honey. this is moderately sweet from the malt and honey but not much going on to bring balance. not totally out of whack though. relatively light in body and mouthfeel. hops are pretty much undetectable. at 4.5% drinkability is good, but not complex enough to drink much of it these days. also can become cloying."
"Bleagh, the worst beer in the Dundee lineup."
"Eric"
"Overall not a bad drinker. Reminds me of my college days upstate. A very popular beer for many that represents a baptism into fuller and more robust drinking. Not bad for what it is."
"Basically, this beer is good because its cheap, and an alternative to your run of the mill American light lager."
"As plain as this beer is in the drinking department, I have found it to taste wonderful when cooked with brats. I'm not a big fan of the honey taste in a beer, but it really adds flavor to the bratwurst. Not a bad beer, just not one I'd really get excited about."
"Pours out a golden honey (no shit?) color with a thinnish head that leaves some scattered lacing. Smells grainy, and, honestly, it's hard to pick out much else. Lot of sweetness in the nose too. Flavor is pretty much, grain, honey, and a metallic twang. Not much else. Faint hint of rubber bands too. Too sweet. Mouthfeel is sticky and fizzy. I'm not impressed with this. How the hell did I used to drink this? Give me a High Life over this any day. At least High Life does't have this cloying sweetness."
"overall i was not overly impressed with this one but i wouldnt turn it down if somebodygive me one or some."
"D= if I weren't so restless and always loving so many other beers, this would suffice as standard home-stock and for as many as you want. Nothing detracting or unappealing, and for the price it's a nice standard to keep on hand for when the great stuff runs out."
"eh. looks okay when poured, smells slightly sweet. the flavor is pretty one dimensional. slightly sweet malty flavor that finishes dry. not my favorite beer although there was a time when i did consume quite a few of these. not something i'd pick up again unless i was in a bind."
"D- Not tasty and so not drinkablility."
"Poured a warm golden colour, with a two finger head that quickly dwindled to half. The lacing was consistent and even. Lots of malt flavours in the front, with just a hint of hoppy bitterness in the finish. Creamy texture in the mouthfeel. Despite being mass-produced and easy to locate, remains an excellent choice. Should definately be categorized as lighter fare, though."
"overall, i think this is a decent beer. nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible. i dont think id buy this again, but i wouldnt avise against it."
"Light body, mild alcohol content...this lager is average at best."
"Rusty copper with honey edges. Clear, clean, with a small, short-lived, off-white head. Lightly toasted malts, cardboard-accented honey, cookie dough, and a subtle vegetable aroma. Sweetish cookie dough flavored malts with caramel and honey. Lightly toasted malts before a slightly bitter, but mostly sweet malt finish. Sweeter than I expected, but not bad. Moderate body with soda-carbonation. Easy drinking at first, but gets a little sweet (artificially so). Still, not bad."
"poured a light copper color two finger off white head faded quickly to just the beer and no lacing to speak of. could not smell the honey just a macro corn aroma. could not taste the honey just some sweet malt very blah. mouthfeel light and carbonation was ok. not something i would buy again."
"Drinkable and unoffensive, takes no risks. There is one good reason to get this beer: the price."
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty easy, although might be a little sweet to drink more than one or two"
"This is surely a sessionable beer, and at around $5 for a 6-pack, why not? Plus who knows, maybe you will open up someone else's eyes to the potential of beer."
"D- this is a drinkable beer with a great aftertaste. I'm sad my local distibutor stopped carrying it but there's plenty of other places to buy it."
"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, it was really very pleasant. Possibly a bit one dimensional with the honey but it works. Quirky."
"D - A less than average beer, but better than some honey brews. Give me the Sam Adams Honey Porter any day over this one though."
"Would not classify this as an American amber, it is more like a dark lager with honey. However, very drinkable. Good session beer with some taste to it. Looks like nothing and smells, well, not the best. Has some nice caramel flavor to it and goes down extremely smooth. A low end micro, but it is a micro and deserves some attention."
"Easy to drink if your choices are limited. Otherwise, i'd try something else."
"overall not bad...just not really my cup of tea...."
"Appearance is a dark lemon with a minimal head. Smell is very light..slight malt presence. Taste is sweet, light honey notes...almost cloying. Mouthfeel is a tad syrupy, which enhances the cloying effect. Yet, the smoothness of the brew helps drinkaability."
"It may be a good introduction for a BMC drinker, but it's not much better."
"D-Very drinkable. You could have five in a row... but it's because it's such a boring beer."
"Not a bad beer, has a nice golden color on the pour, the smell is not all that impressive, smells like a beer out a of a ""dirty 30"" case, however the taste is quite nice, the honey-like taste is quite obvious, great drinkability, a cold one of these goes down real smooth, but overall not a really impressive beer, but it is something i could drink again and again, a bit over priced though. cheers."
"jdundee's brown has a noticable honeyness.. obviously...it is light for the style....both in taste and in abv. I personally think there's something wrong with being able to down 12 brown ale's and still walk a straight line...but the taste of this brew isn't all bad. There is an early toasty malt flavor with a little grainy/earthy bitterness due to faint hops or slight out of balance flavor at the finish.This needs even more flavor and sweetness...especially early on. While being thin....comes off ok in the flavor but far from satisfying.... for the style anyway. An average accessible American Brown with less distinctiveness and flavor than most in this style....but ultimately high on the drinkability."
"."
"This is one of the better beers I could get before the change of laws a little over a year ago. It might also be a reason I rarely drank beer until recently. Not much in the way of smell, and appearance is typical of the style, much like Yeunglueng but sweeter. I seem to taste mostly adjunct, this seems to be a sweet 'corn beer'. I get only cloying sweetness in the finish. Could use some more hops to even this beer out. Definately a step above macros though."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. This was one of my first baby steps towards craft beer and that is exactly what it is... a move in the right direction for the BMC crowd that's scared to try something that isn't piss yellow."
"well, i thought this particular beer smelled a lot better than it tasted and looked. I poured it into a clear class and it reminded me of applejuice, it had very little head and no lace what so ever. It really smelled sweet, and it's taste wasn't too bad; it has a pretty crisp after taste, but not much flavor."
"I can see why people would recommend this to a non-beer or starting beer drinker."
"What I don't like is that there's a very definite funky aftertaste that just tastes cheap."
"The beer pours a very nice gold with some nice red hue. Unfortunately, its head recedes to quickly, but the lacing is okay. The only real smell is the big malt sweetness, but a fresh honey smell does make a slight appearance at the end. The taste is also only big on some malt sweetness. The only honey comes at the end in the form of a grainy, honey comb taste; sourness rounds it out. The mouthfeel is good; slightly thick and very smooth. However, it is a little bubble and will sting the recesses of your mouth. Due to the sourness and bubbles the drinkabilty isn't great."
"Pours a light golden amber with a foamy white head. Smell is of honey (suprise) and malt. Taste is very similar, not a whole lot of flavor besides honey and some malt. A bit better than most macros, great beer for the price. The mouthfeel is smooth, but somewhat watered down. This beer is very drinkable, nothing amazing, but goes with just about anything. Worth trying, a great cheap beer. Enjoy."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is clear and very light amber in color. Beer has a foamy head that quickly dissipates to bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is sweet, of honey and malt. The taste is equally sweet, but not too overpowering. A wonderfully smooth finish. The bottle says ""extra smooth"" and this is no lie. The mouthfeel is light, kinda watery and very carbonated. Overall, I definitely think this is a drinkable beer. Better than your average amber macro."
"This beer wasn't as bad as other reviewers made it seem. Not too bad at all. Not something I'd look for again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"This lager pours a clear and clean honey color with a head that is very light and airy. The flavor and aroma are also very light with a slightly sweet finish that you barley notice and almost no hops presence at all. This brew was too watery and for my personal taste. It needs more character."
"Thank you Honey Brown for making me curious as to what the beer world has to offer, and thank you for being just the right beer I was looking for at that time. I'll never forget you old friend!"
"A solid, and excellent Lager for the price."
"This is quite drinkable, but not very complex or interesing. A very average beer all around."
"Below average. I guess it's about what I expected, but even at less than five bucks a sixer I can probably do better. Not offensive, but not good either. Not recommended."
"I was yet to try this brew. I bought it one night after I got out of work. I was suprised at the taste. I was expecting a real sweet beer. But I was wrong. It is only slightly sweet. I poured it into a pint glass. It held a head fairly well. The color was on the dark yellow, almost orange. I recommend you try it. I was impressed."
"M&D: very spritzy on the mouthfeel, thin, slightly metallic at the back, but not horrible. Yet this is the least impressive honey-flavoured beer I've had. Full-stop."
"Pours a clear golden-amber color with a white head that is quickly reduced to a thin lace. Sweet malt aroma with a touch of honey. Taste is rather thin and watery. Taste is sweet toasted malt with not much hops to help balance this brew out. This actually is a bit too sweet for my liking. Overall, this brew is lacking in so many ways. I am disappointed with the Honey Brown after trying their Pale Ale which wasn't bad."
"Tasted: 07/28/06"
"D- Well, I tried routing for the home team (Rochester, NY), but you let me down again. Nothing but genesee with a tux made of ""honey""."
"Light brown color. Basicly no head. No lacing. Scent has hints of honey and light hop smell.Taste is pretty disapointing. Basicly no honey taste. Has a slightly sweet after taste but nothing that I would call a honey flavor. Mouthfeel is watery and light. Easy to drink because it is so light in taste. Not too expensive. A good party beer but not good for anything else."
"Get my buzz on- y (session)"
"I do not know what the brewer is trying to do here, whatever it is, he has failed to impress me."
"More honey colored than brown, with a typical JWD short-lived, fizzy head. Sweet, candied malt taste masking bitterness and what little carbonation there is. Thin, buttery mouthfeel and rather flat. Honey is detectable, but there's not a lot of other complexity there. Not all that exciting."
"If my only choices were this or a macro, I'd go with this. Probably a good beer to get your Bud drinking friends to try to help them crossover to other choices."
"for the price it's pretty good, and a huge step up from budweiser or miller, but this is by no means a great beer. i'd have rather bought killians, honestly."
"Good beer for what it is. This was one of the ""non-macro"" beers that I tried. I was more impressed by it back then. This is a good crossover ber for those who want to explore outside of their BMC world."
"Im having this beer just right now.The honey taste is light.the mouthfeel is very good but if i was in bar i would not ask for a beer this sweet.Is good if you are just having one.i really like the color of this beer is like dark gold but not to dark for my taste."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the crystal clear light amber brew. Head fades slowly, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet grain with a light hoppiness. Taste is also sweet malts upfront, possibly too much, again with a lightly hoppy character, and both flavors linger after swallowing. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, limited by the sweetness somewhat. Not bad for an aluminum offering for those places that shun glass, but not much else would draw me back."
"D: At 4.5% alcohol, it's OK if you're out and you're drinking for volume. It's not a terribly refreshing beer, though, so it's not much of a lawnmower beer. First glass went down easy. I recall from college that the sweetness isn't nearly as pleasurable on subsequent glasses."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Appearance was medium brown with a quickly dissipating head and little lacing. Aroma has hints of malt, but very faint. Flavor was okay, but lost in the thin body, which in turn led to a watery, less-than memorable finish. Not much to this beer."
"Overall - An average beer... nothing ground breaking but quite drinkable although it gets a little sweet towards the end.... worth a try..."
"D - as a previous reviewer mentioned, JW Dundees continues to prove that qualty beer doesnt have to be expensive. for $8.99 a 12-pack what a great deal!!"
"D-If had no other beer, I could drink a few, otherwise I'd switch"
"Small amount of head when poured into a pint glass. Quickly fades to an incomplete layer of head. Dark yellow, not quite brown. Smell is very faint, an indication of the flavor. Not too much flavor. I recall from my yesteryears that this beer was dominated by the taste of honey, but now it's not so prominant as I recall. Pretty decent beer, nothing special though. I bought a JW Dundee sampler pack, ready to try something else, this is a pretty boring beer. On second thought, there's quite a bit of honey taste, but not as much as Eureka! wheat honey ale."
"I bought a 22-ounce bottle of this beer today, for the first time in many years. It isn't as good as I remembered it being. Not bad, just undistinguished. Color is a nice deep amber-gold. Head is loose and foamy; dissipates fast. Very little odor. Faintly ""cardboardy"" taste. I'd drink JWD Honey Brown if it was the only beer available - say, at a picnic - but I won't be buying it on a regular basis."
"A good beer. Gimme their Amber lager or Pale Ale over this offering, but still quite good."
"Nothing harsh or challenging about this beer at all. On the boring side of the beer divide useful as a transition beer but really too light for a BAs taste buds."
"This one was given to me as a part of a mixed gift pack, and was not one I had picked up intentionally before. For a beer called Honey Brown, this poured out a very pale and fizzy, which was understandable, as it was just a lager. It looked pretty good with a one finger head, despite the label misnomer. Not much going on aromatically, except some cleanly grainy smell and a faint touch of honey. The honey was more evident in the taste and was followed by some green apple sourness and a hint of spice. Not unpleasant, just very very bland. Not a lot going on in the mouth after the first taste either. I was hoping this would be a pleasant surprise, but this wasnt it."
"Da. Nil."
"Drinkability: a little to light textured for me to enjoy a few at a time, but I could probably down a few like water if i had to... (i don't know what situation would force me to down this stuff like water... and i'm not too interested in finding out)."
"Poured a clear , golden amber with a half inch white head. Smells is of some malt , slight adjunct , and artificial honey like smell. Mildly malty taste , slightly on the sweet side , no hops taste , a little thin with a tad bit of honey flavor that helps the drinkability. Mouthfeel is light. A decent brew , just not very flavorful. Goes down quick and easy though. Id buy it over most macros."
"Picked up 12 of these for $9. Pourded into a mug, the appearance is pretty standard. Like its name, it's honey-colored, with only a slight, bubbly, thin white head. Sweet, starchy smell -- a bit of corn comes through. The taste is solid -- reminds me of a Bud with a little sweetness to it, you can detect the honey. Mouthfeel is fine -- a good amount of carbonation tho. This could be a good session beer. Perfect with chips, or a burger/hot dog on a summer day. If you're tired of Bud & the like, but don't want to sway too far away from it, this might be the one for you."
"Drinks okay, but to sweet to drink more than 2. Folks who like sweet or bland will enjoy"
"D- this beer is very drinkable. i said previously that this tastes a lot like honey, and thats true. it's not necessarily a bad thing, i could drink a lot of this, but i probably wont."
"This pours a light amber with a smallish white head. The smell is very light,almost no smell, with a little sweet malt aroma. The taste is like any large macro lager beer. Light,crisp and very little taste. The m/f is light,weak and watery. I really can't imagine ever having this again."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable, but certainly not an exciting beer. This is a good gateway beer, and cheap enough to buy in bulk for the BMC crowd."
"D - Drinkable. Not too bad, I've had worse. Would not buy again though."
"Considering the price, its not a bad beer, but if Im looking for an inexpensive alternative, there are other cheap beers that Id prefer."
"you either like or you dont like. My guess is that the more different beers you have tasted, the less you will like Honey Brown lager."
"Overall this is just above average. I think it succeeds in being a cheaper beer with a bit more flavor than similarly priced brews."
"Opinion: Well, I wasn't too impressed with this beer by any means. The malt bill was out of balance, the water seems off for the style, the carbonation is too low...need I go on? It gets rather unpleasant as it warms, and one that I doubt I will drink again."
"Drinkability - Definetely drinkable, goes down like a cola. One of my favorite up and coming beers"
"Poured out of the bottle into a strait pint glass. Looks amber but very light. You can smell the honey and also a typical brown ale smell. Sweet taste right from the beggining. First thought is that this beer should be served cold. Out of my beer fridge it was around 52 F. I think it would be better served like a macro lager at 38 F. Aftertaste is sweet and nutty. Over carbonation is the next feeling. I'm not saying I dislike this beer, just that it needs some major improvement. I don't think you could drink very many of these unless you were in the mood for something sweet. Even then there are better alternatives out there."
"Notes: Drank a lot in college and it helped me to understand that beer could have flavor. I now see that it had very little flavor. Enjoyable enough to be refreshing. Definitely worth the price ($3.99/6), but I would rather spent 3x as much and get a better beer."
"Poured a crystal clear medium amber color with modeest white head. Smell is on the sweet side (honey) and while different not especially appealling. Taste is more sweetness, but the honey notes are somewhat enjoyable. Finish is more sweetness, which begins to get a bit tiring. Not your average beer, but may be more enjoyable on a hot summer afternoon."
"Drinkability : For the price you cant go wrong. It has sort of the same taste as bud light but with more flavor and of cource a tad of honey for half the cost."
"Brew pours to a deep golden color that hedges on amber. Has a nice sized off white head that has some retention and leaves a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma has a sweat quality to it that seems to dominate causing any malt aromas to be well-hidden or even non existent. The taste is pretty good, does have a sweat characteristic but it is not too much for me. Do notice some malt flavors but even though they do come out in the taste they still seem quite hidden. The feel is very fresh and crisp with a nice amount of carbonation. Probably my least favorite in the Dundee offering but a old favorite from college days long past. Over all a fair brew."
"The only other honey lager I have had is Young's Waggledance, and comparatively speaking, that is much better, but this beer is really not all that bad. If they ironed out the burning sensation it gives your mouth, this would be an above-average beer, in my book."
" I'm acually surprised as how I don't hate this beer. It's total macroswill but for macroswill, it's half decent. It's close to Yeungling and Saranac although a few notches behind Blue Point, imho. However, for $8.79 a twelve, it's good value and great for game day or another event when you have to host and want to appeal to everyone, not just your beer snob buddies."
"Pours an orange color with a decent head from a twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is mild, not a real lot there. Taste is pretty decent for a lager beer, I like the touch of honey. Makes for a fairly quaffable beer. This is probably a decent beer to introduce macro drinkers to craft beer."
"I couldn't drink too much, too sweet."
"Overall, this is pretty much just an ""eh"" beer for me. It's nothing that tastes fantastic, but it's a nice solid brew that I could probably drink several of if the need ever arose. Rogue's American Amber is miles better, though."
"Pours an ultra-clear light golden color. Fizzy two finger head dissapears quickly but leaves fair lacing. Massive amount of fast-moving carbonation bubbles rising to the top. Honey-ish and light malt aromas, pretty clean. Pale malt sweetness, and a nutra-sweet fake honey taste. Hops attempt to make an impact on aftertaste, but there is almost no bittter in this unblanced and off-sweet brew. Light body and champagne-like carbonation prevents the off-flavors from turning slick, but the finish is residual with artificial sweetness, and the resulting drinkability is low."
"from the bottle. poured a honey with a white head that left no lacing. aroma nutty, malts. just a slight hint of sweetness and some hops. flavor what there was odf it got nuttyness, malts, sweetness could only get small hints of honey out of this bottle, and thats all folks. I guess for the price might make a session beer"
"Poured this into a pint glass and wasn't thrilled with the result. Light brownish yellow, clear, with no head, lots of carbonation. Beer is almost clear at the edges. Smell is hard candy sweet over a watery malt base. Looks suspiciously like an iced tea at this point. Taste is sweet, nearly cloying, with a crispiness that doesn't quite save the day here. Light body. Yes, you can drink it, but I wouldn't seek this one out."
"The color of the beer is dull brown with a frothy head that leaves a little foam the whole way down but does not leave any lace. It smells mostly of some barley malt with a slightly sweet aroma. The taste does not reveal much that the taste does not. There is an average thickness and carbonation. Overally this beer does not bring enough to the table to be considered all that great."
"Three of these came in a sampler 12 pack along with the amber lager, pale ale, and the new special edition festive ale. Pours a dark amber color a thick tan head that quickly fades. Not very much in the aroma department besides a mild sweetness. Taste is thin and weak with a little too much sweetness for me. There is a place for this beer, just not in my fridge."
"I like this beer but it isn't anything special. The honey taste is slightly noticeable but the beer is much more enjoyable after drinking a more bitter beer, as the honey then jumps out."
"That said, JW Dundee's product is nothing to write home about, but you could do a lot worse for the price range. In fact, Honey Brown is unquestionably superior to the Big 3 macros, so you have no excuse to be buying them if you see this on the shelves."
"Poured an amber/brownish color with a small head of white foam that dissipated fast that left no rings or lace whatsoever. It didn't have much of an aroma, except for some grains in a sweet background. The taste was like the smell, grainy with a little bit of sweet honey in the background. At one time I noticed some hops in there too. The mouthfeel was very average, light and easily drinkable. Basically a cheap above average beer and would make a nice substitute when the bar has nothing but macros."
"Pours a clear, light brownish amber with a small, slight off-white, foamy, quickly diminishing head. The smell is of sweet grainy malts, very light grassy hops and a bit of doughy yeast. The taste is mostly grain with some cooked veggie in there too, and it rather sweet as it heads toward the finish. The finish is short and very lightly dry with a touch of honey. It has a medium-light body, lightly oily texture and lively carbonation. Nothing special, but quite drinkable. I was always happy to see this on tap at college parties (but considering what they would normally have, can you blame me?), because it was a little heavier that the average kegger beer but smoother too."
"While not that complex or interesting, the honey flavor, sweetness, drinkabilty and even the price make this a great brew to use when introducing BMC drinkers to the craft beer scene. Recommended."
"Smooth, refreshing and very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is average. Not much carbonation in this beer, and it is light on the palate. It also goes down easily. You could drink this all night with no problems, but I wouldn't want to. I don't think that I am a big fan of this beer. I really wouldn't buy it again unless I had no other better options."
"but you dont have to take my word for it!"
"Overall: OK for a specialty beer, but nothing spectacular. Worth a try if youre intererested in this style or want to show a macro drinker what else is out there. It is relatively inexpensive; I paid $5.85 for a sixer."
"overall a very decent and underrated beer. it's really not that bad for the price, and i enjoy the honey flavor once in a while."
"Nice golden color. One inch head slowly goes into a nice lace. Light,but not watery. Good flavor with a slight sweet edge.Smooth finish,makes this a very drinkable beer. This has been a beer of choice for me lately. Good price,full flavor.I recommend this beer."
"notes: personally i wouldn't buy this again. however, it's cheap, really really cheap. you can pick up a 12 of this for less than a 12 of bud at yankee spirits. this is probably a good beer to use if you're trying to turn a friend on to ""better beer""."
"Taste is very surprising. Good sweetness (not over-powering at all). Nice honey flavor. The mouthfeel is rich and round. Mid-level carbonation. Very nice change of pace and very easy to drink. Good beer at a great price."
"The kicker on the drinkability is that it is $7.50 for a 12 pack. Yes! Easily one of the top beers in this price range. Also, I got a 1/4 barrel of this over the summer, and it was even tastier on tap."
"Pours a pale amber...not exactly what I was expecting from a ""honey BROWN"" with a minimal white head. Smell is a little adjuncty, with some sweet malt. Taste is of a standard macro lager with some honey sweetness. Aftertaste is corn and a little metallic. Mouthfeel is bubbly, body is medium. Overall, a slightly sweet, slightly more tolerable macro lager. Better than anything BMC for sure, but nothing to write home about"
"The smell is almost not there, very faint. There is a mild sweetness and some flowery wafts of something. The taste is slightly tangy with a mild amount of hops. It is mainly fruity with hints of oranges and honey. The beer is mildly refreshing and very smooth, almost watery in the mouthfeel, especially the aftertaste."
"Drinkability - I usually take a long time drinking my beers. Giving me lots of little sips and lots of time to savor. I didn't do that here. I wanted to taste the honey and the revitalizing texture. Not that I chugged it, but I took it in quicker than usual. I could drink this with many meals, I could drink this again right now. At its reasonable price, this is a fairly good buy."
"Pours a pale not-at-all-brown with a decent head. Honey sweet and slightly malty smell. Buh, the sweetness is way too much. It's not a natural honey flavor, i.e. Dogfish Midas Touch, either. Just sickly sweet with barely any beer taste. Really horrible syrupy mouthfeel. I couldn't finish my pint."
"Beer is good. Happy Summer beering."
"Eeh, an ok beer. Looks...bown...with coca cola looking high lights. A little over carbonated, with little in the way of head retention. Smells caramelly, nutty, and molassas like, albe it light. Slight yeast flavors and earthiness in the nose. Tastes much the same in sweetness and a little souring from fermentation. May have a little diacityl. No hop aroma or flavor leaves this beer too sweet not to have a bigger body. The body is medium and slick to the palate. Finishes a bit too barley sweet and not bittering or drying in the finish. No definate alcohol flavors or warmth. An ok beer, but the lack of balance and depth keeps me from drinking more."
"Its not the best beer in the world ,but its ok on a hot summerday..and heck i just plain like it for the good memories it brings to mind."
"Looks really nice for a lager, an eye-catching golden, honeyish color. ""Honey Brown"" isn't a bad description of it. Starts with a big, soapy head, but that doesn't last long. After that, there's no lacing of which to speak. Definitely smells honeyish, but also floral and perfumey. Really smells like a honey-scented perfume. The only initial taste is malty, but there's a hint of honey on the finish that's nice. Mouthfeel is limpid; I'm not convinced that there's any carbon dioxide in this beer at all. I suppose this beer hits exactly what it aims for, which is a malty lager with a hint of honey. Any more honey and it would be sickeningly sweet, but that little bit of honey is the only real character this beer has."
"A cult classic and a decent stepping stone from macro lagers to perhaps craft beer one day."
"I've enjoyed Honey Brown for the past few weeks on a business trip to Chicago. It's a bit sweet now that I've acquired a taste for darker and heavier beers, but it's not too expensive and a decent beer if you plan on having *a few*. It's available in central Illinois grocery stores, so it should be available many places. WARNING: DON'T put it in the back of a super-cold fridge (or a freezer for a quick-cool) - the beer freezes in the bottle."
"I think this beer for the price is one of the top notch brews in that price range. The honey shines through, although it leaves a ""slick"" aftertaste that makes it tough to throw down more than 3 or so at a time. The aroma has a slight sweet honey and sugar fragarance. I like the taste. I can remember this being one of the better cheap beers available when I was in college."
"I notice the label now says ""Honey Flavored Lager."" Flavored? As in ""not actually brewed with?"" As in ""No bees went hungry so you can drink this stuff?"" Because theres very much of a honey ""flavor," almost an artificial one, and not much beer flavor. Odd little whiskey and honey note appears midway through, but the sickly honey smell is off-putting. Like I sometimes say, its not bad, its just not beer! I just can't figure out why this is so widely distributed. Seems to be available nationwide; or at least as far west as Illinois."
"This was a favorite of mine a while back. The appearance is light brown, some foam that is soon gone. Aroma contains some light malt, but not much else. Initial taste is that of the honey sweetness, some bread, some hops to balance out the sweet with a little bitterness. Fizzy carbonation may be a drawback for some. This is a decent session beer for summer  tasty but not too heavy."
"clean, filtered light gold color. small unimpressive head that quickly dissipated and practically no lacing. sweet nutty smell with no distinct notes or sense impressions cutting through to evoke a taste one could pick out. tastes overly sweet with honey notes on the tip of the tongue and a very slight bitter finish from a little grain quality but mostly malty. not too crisply carbonated and extremely smooth. maybe it's the ideal beer for some or a good crossover beer, but it's not for me. worth a try though if you're into sweetness."
"A nice beer. Poured out to a clear dark golden color with a nice head, although it wasn't very long lived.. Odors of sweetness were most noted, making me think this was gonna be overly sugary. Quite the contrary, this beer hand overtones of grain, cereal and hops, with a slightly sweet finish. Very drinkable. Recommended."
"Its smooth, even & balanced, but no real taste experiences to note, which effects its drinkability. Could I drink these one after another? Yes. Am I? No. I wouldn't buy any, but I would drink them if my choices were limited. Its not bad, just not good."
"Amber color with a thin lace for a head. Smells grainy with a strong a honey aroma. Sweet malts, grains, and honey come out in the flavor. Has a medium light mouthfeel with light carbonation. Basically an average lager with a honey taste. The only characteristic that makes this beer worthwhile is the honey."
"This looks like a pilsner and not a brown ale. Odd. Aroma is weak with a bit of sweetness but I couldn't tell if it was honey or not, just an abstract sweetness. Flavor is more like a thinner sweetened up light brown ale. Not bad. Smooth, decent body for a macro. Honey sweetness is more prevalent here. Quite a sweet beer actually, hops are nowhere to be seen. Finish lingers with more of a brown sugary taste in my mouth. I like it but this could get cloying after a few. Luckily I have a high cloying threshold (sweet tooth) so this could be a session beer for me. Solid"
"Weak in the mouthfeel. Drinkable but boring."
"An easy summer beer; nothing great but it's refreshing after being out in the sun."
"This is lightyears ahead of Genesee but JW Dundee's Pale Ale and Amber Lager are much better offerings."
"Light carmel color, much lighter than I would expect from something called Honey Brown. Small white head on pout, fades to a creamy island in the middle of the beer. Smells like grassy malts, a bit of roasted malt, and slight honey sweetness. Taste is very smooth, but subtle and somewhat underwhelming. Some grassiness, some sweetness, hops are definitely just a background whisper. Mouthfeel is pretty good. For the $5.50 an 8 pack I paid for this, it is a very drinkable beer for sessioning."
"Impulsively pulled it off the shelf when my wife got impatient in the beer store. Light brown in color. No head to speak of. The taste is okay and the sweetness makes it distinguishable from a light lager, but not enough to make me want to try it again. The hops are barely detectable and they were needed to blend in with the sweetness."
"This is a good session ale, no doubt. Easy drinking and cheap to boot. Nothing fancy, but nothing bad."
"This one pours a translucent orange color. It smells of of honey and light malt. The taste isn't o.k. but it's nothing to special. It tastes of honey and malt. It basically follows the nose. It has a decent mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. It's a drinkable beer. You could put down a few of these if you plan on drinking a lighter beer and were willing to settle for average."
"With the new direction that high falls seems to be going in this beer has lost some relevancy. i don't really see a need for this beer with their new amber lager but the memoriesss. Ahh. It pours a nice dark orange and smells sorta chemically. When i think brown ale i don't think of this. It isn't brown! But it isn't bad. The mouthfeel is light and watery but it does go down easy. A little weak but i like it."
"Smells sweet and tastes even sweeter. Who poured sugar in my beer? Yuk. This stuff is not my cup of tea. I couldn't even get through the first glass. I gave the last half to my Mom."
"this one is pretty drinkable if you can handle the sweetness of the honey. definitely worth a try, but then again nothing to outrageously special either."
"It's really not that bad. Very easy to drink and quite a bit malty and syrupy. Appears as light maple syrup and smells quite similar. this was the lowest scored of the five I tried, but definitely not terrible either."
"The beer pours a dark orange/red hue. It is about the same color as their new American Amber Lager. The head is thin but there is lacing. Smell is corn. Taste is not great, but not terrible either. The honey is faint and so are the hops. As far as drinkability, I could see this as a session brew. This is a pretty standard macro-tasting beer with some ""craft"" characteristics. Nothing great."
"Summary: Perhaps this is what keeps most from sampling the Pale Ale because they tried this HB once and never went back. The pale and amber have no adjuncty flavor like the HB. Steer clear of this and try the Pale."
"Drinkability strongest component---mildness enables further drinking."
"Not too bad, poured a clear light brown with a small white foam head  which fairly quickly dissipated. Nice taste, good amount of carbonation  you can taste light malts and a very subtle hint of the honey, no hops to speak of. Kinda sweet with a lite body, but would be appropriate for some outdoor summer sessions."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear, light amber hue with a white head. Has a sweet creamed corn smell. Light medium bodied with nice carbonation. Grainy, honey flavor followed with a nicely bitter taste to finish. Not too bad especially considering the good $4.00 a sixer price."
"Final Thought: Well worth the price, if you can overcome the overpowering sweet factor, it's a solid beer."
"At $5.14 a sixer, this isn't bad and if i'm strapped for cash and can't find anything but BMC, this would be my pick. Would probably be better in the summer months though."
"Drinkability: This beer is ok, just not knock your socks off great. I'd buy it again (have done so in the past), but not very often."
"I was feeling nostalgic tonight so I grabbed a sixer of this and swapped out some singles for J.W. Dundees other new beers. (Yeah, Im one of those guys sometimes). I have to say this was my favorite beer in my underaged days. I havent had it in years probably so Im a little worried. The body of this beer is nowhere near brown, it is darker than your average macro swill though, sort of like a ruddy, dirty straw color. Some head appears on the pour but recedes to a tiny off white film on top. Smells better than Id expected actually I do catch a nice honey smell, accompanied by a subtler note of sweet malt, no cheap cloying aromas. The flavor is really light across the front of my palate, astringent and a little hollow. I soft sweet honey flavor does come through about halfway through and a tiny taste of a smooth round malt, the finish is a minimal earthy crust drizzled every so lightly with lemon juice. To be honest, I guess my tastes werent all retarded because I think this is a decent little beer, and the price-point cant be beat!"
"Overall-I admit that honey isn't my most favorite flavor for beer, but for both the style and the beer itself, High Falls has really outdone themselves. This beer warrants its following and is the best of anything I've had from the brewery, if your remotely interested in Honey Lagers definitely give this brew a try."
"When poured, the color was a medium golden yellow with no foam or lace all. A mild aroma of hop's and malts filled the nose and you could tell that is was a mild ale. The taste of hop's and malts was mild, with a hint of honey. The hint of honey gave this ale a sling sweetness that made it pleasant to drink. This is one on the better honey ales's I've drank."
"Get a Pale Ale or an Amber Lager by these guys instead. They're decent beers for the money. This isn't quite as good."
"This macro/micro is above average. Pours a dark yellow/pale amber color, okay head retention, but not great. Smell... slight hop/corn aroma, kinda turned off by that. Taste is clean, slight bit of sweetness at the end. I really like the mouthfeel of this one though, it's thick for style, and I like that. I wouldn't mind a few of these on a night."
"12 ouncer with no freshness dating. Very light for a ""brown"" beer. Very clear. Medium bubble head that does leave some lacing. This is sweet, insipid stuff. Thin, watery brew. Light wiff of malt on the nose and the palate. Not enjoyable stuff, pass it by, alot of more worthwhile brew out there."
"The Honey Brown lager pours a medium-dark honey color. Scant white head disappears quickly. Aroma is pretty mild. Grainy with maybe a hint of honey. Taste is slightly sweet. malty, a bit nutty, with just the barest hint of hops perceptible. After taste is slightly sour. Light mouthfeel. pretty good drinkability. Just OK overall."
"An overall average beer that I have found good in the past to help ease people along from Macros to Crafts. Plus is better than the big three for about the same price."
"Pours a very clear ligh brown with a head that leaves quickly with barely any lacing. Smells like a MBC beer with a hint of sweetness. Tastes of malts and nuts but no honey. I personally think this beer tastes pretty rough with a very light, boring mouthfeel. It's a drinkable beer if nothing else is available, but is definitly nothing special at all. Skip this one if you can."
"Drinkability is quite good. As long as I didn't have something better, I could drink this all evening."
"This is a wonderful beer that you will enjoy. Get over the Honey thing, it's really not that sweet."
"One interesting thing to note: This stuff actually tastes pretty good, maybe even better, at or just below room temperature. This was confirmed to me by several friends (none of whom you'd think of as ""enlightened"" beer drinkers) during a long power outage when all the beer turned warm. Definitely a good beer to have around if chilling isn't a possibility."
"I drank this straight out of the bottle so I gave it a ""3" for both appearance and aroma. Other than that, I am pretty impressed with the smooth, refreshing taste that comes out of this fairly cheap beer goes. This is one of those beers that seem super exotic to some. If they like this, they will tell people, ""yeah, I like dark beers..."" All kidding aside, this has a very nice amount of honey taste, maybe a little too much, but nonetheless, pretty decent."
"(I just noticed that the underside of my bottlecap says 'sorry try again'. Make a better beer and I'll consider it)."
"Mouthfeel is thin, wispy. Some residual sweetness. Slightly more interesting than a Bud/Coors/Miller, but not enough."
"Overall: A very average beer at best. This beer is a step up for macro drinkers, but not much of one. This beer's biggest downfall is its sweetness and rather sickly ""honey"" character. Not a bad beer by any means, but certainly not recommended."
"Bought a 12 pack on sale for $8.15 at Spec's liquors. Found this to be a pretty decent beer, but after a few it seemed a little too sweet for my tastes. Appearance is a nice copper color, definently not very brown, but not bad at all. Smell is mildly sweet, alcohol is noted, smell is clean, but nothing great. Taste is very sweet of honey, maybe a little too sweet for my tastes. Not bad tasting, but sweetness became tiresome by the end of my second beer. Luckily the sweetness doesn't last very long after finishing a sip. Drinkability is pretty good, especially for those who prefer honey flavor. Dundee's Honey Brown seemed very filling for a lager though, but I think it might be just the sweetness bothering me. I probably won't buy this again, but it still is a fairly good beer."
"Pours a clear copper color with a decent head that was gone rather quickly. Little if any lace to speak of. Faint aroma of malt and hops. Taste is OK. Some malt flavors with corn and rice flavors coming through. Some honey sweetness and minimal hop flavors. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, and refreshing. A decent thirst quencher. I usually always have some in the fridge and offer it to my American Lager drinking friends. Its a step up from Bud (a small one), but sometimes thats all it takes to get them sarted down the BA road. A OK brew, that most people enjoy."
"This a drinkable beer and the price on this 6 pack is great. Not an amazing beer by any means, but enjoyable."
"The label says honey flavored lager, and sure enough the first flavor to hit my palate was a bit of honey that lingers throughout, with a crisp dry finish. A decent thirst quencher, but certainly not a world class beverage."
"Rather dull, with little redeeming qualities. Not horrible, but not good either."
"Haven't had one of these since high school, and now I know why. Pours a light amber color. A slight head that is fairly steady throughout, but almost no lacing. A faint aroma is present, somewhat minty, and a touch of honey. The taste is very disappointing. There's something not right with this beer and I can't put my finger on it. Almost tastes like cardboard. A very mild beer that is disappointing to say the least. A step up from Bud, Coors, etc. but not recommended."
"I'd take these over budmillercoors just about any day, it seems to go rather well with spicy foods."
"This stuff is pretty ubiquitous here on campus, the price was 1.25 per draft so i decided to try it. Received this beer in a clear plastic cup so to the best of my knowledge the pour was an amber color with a quickly disappating white head. Not really much smell to this one. Flavor was subdued but there was a little bit of malty sweetness present. This is a pretty light beer. It's nothing special but then again it's not god awful either."
"Hmmm. Just to note, there is a pervasive honey flavor throughout this beer and I wonder what they have added to the brew to get that flavor. Anyway, the rest is just a bland pale malt character. A bit too fizzy and not much character. Grassy and crisp. Light-bodied. Not a bad beer but does not distinguish itself either. If it had not been left in my fridge after a bunch of guys came over for cards, I probably would never have tried it and I sure can't see trying it again if given a choice."
"a macro looking head, white and fizzy. lace looks good. appearance is clear and barely a light copper amber. not brown. smell is mild and a bit sweet. smells like a macro. taste is smooth and perfectly sweet. i think that they use adjuncts in this beer. that is what the smell and taste is telling me. despite all of this it is a very drinkable beer."
"Seems to have spawned a host of imitators."
"I first had this beer at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo while wolfing down some wings. It tastes better on tap than from the bottle. This isn't an overly complex beer. The color is somewhere between amber and brown. The taste of it is just as it is advertised. You can definitely taste the honey in it but there is not so much of it where it is too sweet. Goes down easy and is better than just about any macrobrew you will find."
"Mouthfeel was very watery, and the drinkability was low, I had difficulty finishing the bomber."
"Drinkability  This is definitely not one that Id buy again, but it was just good enough to keep out of the sink."
"Picked this up at the convenience store down the street in a bomber. It poured a light copper colour with a moderate to thick head that didn't last all too long. The smell was semi-malty and sweet. I wouldn't say honey sweet, but it was sweet. The taste was also sweet, but it lacked that honey taste I was looking for. It also had a malty taste. I will drink this again. It is much beter than any of the other macros out there. It's good if all there else is Corona, Bud and JW Dundee's."
"I don't know about the marketing on this one - the fake ""Australian/British name", brown-lager etc.., but I found it to be a very acceptable beer. I could easily base a session around it, as long as I didn't have to very often."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light honey color with one finger of head. There is very little lacing on it. The smell is of sweet caramel and malt, a little light on the smell. The taste is also very malty, no hops in sight. Very sweet taste, and a little bland on some parts of the tongue. The mouthfeel is a little watery. The drinkability is fair though."
"This is an easy drinking, economical beer. Pours to a white head and gold-amber color. Head retention is poor. Aroma is of sweet malt (or is it unfermented honey?) and a bit of hops. Flavor is sweet and malty with a clean, pleasant finish. It is a bit on the sweet side but not too bad."
"This beer was lackluster at best. Average all around, it wasn't all that bad and was very drinkable considering the price. The mild honey flavor timidly reveals itself in the mid-to-after-taste, which complements the initial bitterness of the alcohol and hops. The alcoholic content seemed slightly lower than what I expected from the taste, but it still did the trick. Not thumbs down, but definitly not thumbs up. Somewhere in the middle is where this beer resides."
"Pours a orange color with a thin white head that dissapated within a few minutes. Plenty of carbonation is visible. The aroma is mostly a chalky malt smell with a macrobrew-like smell as well. The taste is not bad, very light and crisp, but rather lacking in complexity. It was a little thin and simple, but the price was the same as Bud or Coors and it still managed to bring a little bit more to the playing field. Not bad, I would recommend to anyone looking to get more from a macro while paying the same price."
"Poured from the tap a dark honey shade of golden with a foamy white head. This beer smelled and tasted sweet, with a nice richness and definite influence of honey in the flavor. It goes down easy, but like I said, it is pretty sweet. The finish is easy and soft, like it came out of a little plastic bear. Dundee's is very enjoyable, and very, very smooth. It's like the sweet tea of beers -- and that's a compliment."
"Tasty in its own way, but definately not something that I'd reach for if there were a number of other alternative brown ales available."
"While not anything outstanding, it is a serviceable brew in a pinch."
"The beer pours a light golden color with a slight reddish hue to it. The head is bone white and laces quite nicely. The aroma is decent, but nothing special. There is a bit of malt character in the nose along with that traditional lager smell. The taste is not bad, but not that great either. It contains a slight honey flavor along with the maltiness from the vienna malt used. It is a light beer with a low body. It's like most macros; quite popular and quite drinkable. I've never been a huge fan of this beer, but to be honest after giving it an objective review, I don't think it's too horrible after all."
"This brew poured a small short lived head of medium sized white bubbles with a carbonated light amber colored body. It has a mild malt/hop aroma a mild fizzy initial taste and flavors of mild spices while finishing very smoothly. I found it to be a very nice drinkable brew that went well with my dinner."
"well it's a light brown lager wiht a sweetish mouth feel and taste. It was a big beer in the late 90's but has faded fast.. No smell or nose to speak of with lots of caramel flavor. It is thin in body and strength but is drinkable due to this combination. A good beer to have for a session."
"12 oz bottle. Poured out an amber color, but it calls itself a dark lager. Little to no head even with a vigorous pour. Aroma is muted malt and hops. Taste is of malt with some hopiness, but is lacking in any honey flavor. This is a good smooth drinking beer, which I'd drink again. But it is just another lager. Nothing special."
"It's rather odd to me that this beer ranks 43rd out of the 47 with 5 or more reviews. At the same time, it has the 3rd most reviews applied to if for the style. Such a popular beer among the members here, all logging in to say how below average this is? Perhaps the same phenomenon exists with Bud, Miller, etc. Just thought it was interesting."
"This Lager poured a small white quick dissolving head into my glass. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. There was carbonation observed that was rising to the top. This was a smooth tasting brew without bitterness, but it definitely lacked character in my opinion."
"I find this beer not too special, but not bad either. I enjoy it on occasion. It's a sweet malty brew with zingy carbonation and some crispness. It's easy to down and definitely a good alternative for a session brew instead of drinking macros. It's not brown either, but whatever. Try it and just expect a solid brew for easy drinking without much thought or excitement."
"Poured a decent looking amber color with a small white that did not hang around too long. This beer did leave some ring lacing, but nothing great. The smell and taste are of malt and sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth but cloying. Overall acceptable, but I won't crave one of these, even if I'm feeling like a honey."
"The nose is a pleasant lagery smell with hints of grain. The front is sweet, lagery. The middle is thin, but there's some fresh malt in there. The finish is clean and gives a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, this is a decent don't-think-too-hard alternative to macros."
"Deep golden color with a shallow white head that doesn't last long at all. Aroma is of sweet honey/malt. Small hop smell in the background. The taste is all about sweetness....somewhat one dimensional. More hop character, and a touch of bitterness would go far. This is not a bad beer, but not really satisfying either.."
"Pours a very nice looking glass of beer with a crystal clear golden-amber body and a creamy white head. The retention is fairly good and it leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose delivers a honey-tinged sweetness. The body is light/medium and a fine-bubbled, median carbonation leaves it lightly crisp in the mouth. The crispness in the mouth is needed, however, to help balance the flavor which is also sweet and honeyish. There's a bit of malt character present, but overall it's more about simple sugary sweetness than grain flavor. It finishes less sweet than might be expected, but with a very distinct note of honey at the outset. It's definitely an interesting beer. Apart from the honey flavor, it's surprisingly drinkable - and yet it's not because it overwhelms the palate after more than two servings. And yet you could continue to drink it because there's nothing there to stop you. Probably worth trying if you've never had it before."
"The more I sample this brew, the less I like it!...Time to quit."
"Pours a clear light brownish amber color with a thin white head that fades into a wispy lace. Nose is sweet malts and grains with a touch of honey. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts followed by nutty yeasts and a bit of a cracker-like flavor. A honey-like flavor is also present in the taste, but it seems a bit artificial, almost like corn syrup. A pretty average brew for its style all the way around. Probably not something Ill buy again."
"Nice dark orange color with some light brown tint to it, little head really, just some small bubbles right on top. Smells light, crisp, and clean with a light malt caramel and honey sense. Taste is pretty even, very fresh and light with some caramel maltyness and a sweet honey tone. Very little hop presence. Was a good clean honey flavored beer, there's worse and there's better. This sits just above average for the style. Could be a bit thicker, bolder, and flavored, but pretty good non the less. Good for getting people to try new beer."
"F."
"Taste. It is a bit sweet. Nothing overwhelming, a slight hint of honey and maybe some hops for a slight bitter after taste. Nothing to impressive about this brew, it is average."
"In conclusion, I thought that this was an easy to drink beer that uses its honey flavor more effectively than Michelob's, but not something that I would keep in my fridge at all times. It's worth a try at least once, even if it leads to a drain pour."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a thin, off-white head that quickly recedes to a thin ring of faom around the glass. The aroma is a hint of malt and a hint of honey, but it is very faint. The taste has a nice malty sweetness and just a touch of honey. A slight harsh graininess appears mid taste. Something resembling hops is present in the finish with just a slight touch of bitterness. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is solid and smoother than many mass-produced lagers. The drinkability is better than average for me, but just by a bit, as the sweetness starts to wear on you rather quickly. Not too long ago, this was one of my favorite beers. I was prepared to be very disappointed when I bought this beer, believing there was a strong possibility my memory was enhancing this beer's qualities. But I was not disappointed. It's still a respectable brew, and may be worth considering as a cheap session beer for macro-loving friends, or those times when the beer budget is a little low."
"The drinkability of JW Dundee's Honey Brown Lager would have to be judged in the fact that most people would like it for it's honey flavor sweetness, but I find that I didn't enjoy this one nor would I enjoy it one right after another. Too sweet to be enjoyed in my opinion."
"Poured a tall white creamy head that reduced slowly and fizzed to almost half.Some amounts of lace are noted.The color presented a light gold or almost orange.I wasnt too impressed with the aroma.I couldnt detect any real aroma or taste of honey.The bottle says ""honey flavored lager"" which usually means there is a fake honey flavor awaiting.The mouthfeel was light,creamy,and crisp.The aroma had a nutty wheat smell that I usually associate with macrocrap.This was really bad.I wouldnt this again."
"Nice deep unclouded amber color on the pour, the head is modest in size, beige in color, texture frothy, and lace adequate to cover the glass. Carmel apple sweet at the front, malt and fresh, a decent nose, start cloyingly sweet, top skeletal, finish, minimally acidic, hops scarce, dry aftertaste, drinkable but barely average, another reach for me."
"This beer is ok. I like Honey beers, but this one is average. I would rather have the Michelob version. This isn't a very sweet beer, which is what I would expect from a honey beer. I had it once, and that was enough for me. Maybe somebody else diggs it."
"I think this is a great session type beer. Goes down great, but I have noticed differences by the case as others have mentioned. For the most part, though, its a tasty beer when drinking for an extended period of time."
"Aroma is of sweet malt, and the flavor upon sipping is malty as well, with some mild sweet honey flavor. Nothing overpowering and quite smooth. Could use a little more flavor, of anything really, but its enjoyable."
"This is an OK beer.  The only problem is that there is a taste difference between cases.  One case and this is a good beer.  Smooth, slight honey flavor, small head, but good color.  Refreshing.  The next case and it is hard to swallow.  Slight bite to it, no honey flavor and a non-existent head, and kind of hard to swallow.  But I can say that generally the experience has been good with this beer.  So I let a few bad batches slide by.   I do recommend this beer to friends that want to try to get awat from the norm."
"My freshman year of college we snuk in a half keg of this stuff into the dorms during our springfest to get loaded all day at a reasonable price.  We choose this for one reason:  Girls love honey brown.  Im not the biggest fan of honey brown though.  I like the occasional one here and there but the taste is just too sweet to enjoy more than one or two with out having something to eat.  It isn't a stand alone beer but in the facility of one maybe two beers its not all that bad.  The appearance supplies the drinker with almost no head at all, the only resemblance to a head is a foaming similiar to that of a well poured pepsi.  The color is a slightly dark yet a very transparent goldish amber.  The carbonation on this beer is very light with a medium body, the beer itself has a sliky relaxing feel with every swallow.  The flavor is just too sweet though for me to call this a good beer.  Its has a mellow feel to it nonetheless.  Overall this an average beer that Im sure has its audience who will think less of it and people like myself who may not dislike it but not exactly like this beer."
"Maybe worthwhile on a hot summer days or with some tangy BBQ.  But maybe not..."
"Pours a dark rusty/gold color with a small fades fast head.No lace at all. Very high on carbonation, almost soda-pop high.The smell is hoppy-sweet. Taste has hints of malt and honey to the point of almost caramel.Very smooth and drinkable.It might be liked by a non-beer drinker, its that sweet and carbonated."
"JW Dundees Original Honey Brown, a light honey flavored lager, would be good for barbecues or picnics or even a nice quencher for spicy foods."
"Clear amber color with a generous white head and suprisingly wonderful lace.Mildly sweet to the nose with a thin malt aroma. Finishes clean and crisp with some dryness. To me it tasted like watered down Sprite. A little overboard with the sweetness is and tastes processed. Not an enjoyable beer."
"This beer is very clear and light amber in color.  A small head vanishes in no time.  The aroma consists of malt and sweet honey.  There is a real nice crisp taste.  Honey is present.  A dryness is also present.  Some very slight chocolate and roasted malt undertones.  A nice drinkable brew here.  Nothing spectacular, but really not too bad."
"Certainly nothing outstanding here, but really this is better than I thought it would be....It is definitely sweet on the palate but I kind of like that with a honey beer.  The honey is evident and it has a pretty, smooth creamy texture...I'm rating this as a honey beer...as a Brown Ale it would score considerably lower as to me it doesn't resemble a brown ale at all...It is deep golden in color...pretty clear...not a complex beer, but for a honey beer it is better than most I've had included Leinie's and South Shore's..."
"Luckily I have never had one of the ""bad batches", which this beer seems to be notorious for. Pleasant aroma and nice color, and the honey aftertaste has the potential to linger, which can be either bad or good depending on your preference. One of my favorite American beers that is not from a micro-brew."
"a winner in my book. slightly dark, and very smooth and creamy. you get a hint of honey as it goes down with a little bitterness. i went back to this one many times, and it never let me down. it was easy to drink, and bery enjoyable"
"On tap tonight, I have had the bottles as well. Slighty darker than yellow to light brown color. Thin faint white head, sweet, honey smell, with some sourness as well. Tasted overly sweet, with a serious stale, sour finish. Didn't get much malt or, hop balance, just sourness. Thin feel, not much to keep you drinking more. I remember the bottles being much better. I may have had it from a stale keg. Not memorable, and I won't buy it again for a long time."
"Dark copper hue, clear and effervescent.  The head settles into a respectable layer that coats the glass.  Sweet caramel malt and cooked corn in aroma, and not much else.  Lightly bodied from the copious use of adjuncts.  There's a one - dimensional, non caramel malt derived sweetness in flavor that is quite offputting, and borderlines of being cloying.  Malt complexity is sorely lacking.  Hop bitterness is meager, and thus allows for the sugary sweetness.  Tastes like a typical macrobrew w/ sugar added.  Mild honey flavors emerge in the finish, then vanish quickly leaving an empty blandness.  Honey Brown is not an enjoyable beer.  The sweetness is cloying and tastes processed."
"This beer makes me sick. Maybe I just don't like honey beers.  It's light wood color with thick large bubbled head.  Smell is of a touch of sweetness with almost a bread smell.  Mouthfeel is fizzy and mouthcoating.  Not very sweet, but its the kind of sweet that makes you gag. I can never finish one of these."
"Copper color, very white head that's gone at about 25 seconds.  There might be a slight honey in the aroma, otherwise understated sweet smell.  Bottle says ""smooth"" and it surely is.  Smooth to the point of zero complexity.  I couldn't detect any hops anywhere in my mouth, primary impression is of light brown sugar.  Surprisingly thin mouthfeel while at the same time a little gagging in the throat after three sips or so.  I suppose this is drinkable for people who don't like beer but there was nothing of note to me.  A sweet ""Genny"" that made its way west from Lake Ontario to a liquor store south of Lake Superior..."
"I found it to be an average beer to drink. Something better to drink then the Budlights, etc. at a function. But there are better beers out there of this type. It poured a dark yellow color and formed pratically no head to speak of. The aroma was of malt and some hops. The flavor was of malt and hops. The body was very light and the finish hard to really figure out."
"Original: Another beer that should be considered the base-line for a regular drink. It smells of bread and honey. Slightly sweet with a bit of an after-taste. Another brew I only seem to see in college towns."
"This wasn't too bad. I was expecting the worst, figuring the honey would taste like an afterthought, but it seemed to blend in nicely with the beer. Not as sweet as I had anticipated either. Decent, and fairly cheap too."
"Take Newcastle and water it down and lower the quality just a bit and you've got Hone Brown. Not a bad beer, though."
"A very pleasant, drinkable beer.  Rather slight head, beautiful dark golden brown color, slightly sweet and very smooth and pleasant, no aftertaste at all.  Easy to drink, unremarkable, but nothing to offend, either."
"I really hate this beer.  The honey flavor puts me off right from the start.  I never understood why this beer was so popular when it first starting getting hit the shelves in PA.    If ICE cold it is still bad but gets way worse as it warms up.  I can barely choke one bottle down."
"The only thing brown about this beer is part of the name. The highly enjoyable honey flavour and ease of drinkability are the real highlights of this brew. An excellent session beer and perahps a nice baby-step beer for drinkers who can't let go of their mainstream lagers/pils."
"Those looking for the typical brown ale will likely be dissappointed. I don't think it's intended to be interpreted as such. However, as an honey brown lager it does well in a pinch and is a decent beer. A good introductory craft brew."
"Extremely mild - makes Newcastle look robust.  If you like a really mild brown - you will like this.  If you want something with a little backbone, look elsewhere."
