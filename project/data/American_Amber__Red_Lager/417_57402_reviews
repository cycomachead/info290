"Fairly bland, just a touch of sweetness. The ""dark"" beer for people want to drink quantity. I'd rather stick with Premium"
""
""
"Strong wheat-based beer that's crisp and light."

"Better than regular grain belt, that's for sure. More flavor, but still not a top tier beer."

"My old standby. Cheap but awesome. Almost no head even when poured hard, but what a robust, refreshing taste, and the color is something to admire. Almost as good room-temp from the bottle as it is cold from a glass."
""
""
"Overall: decent but pedestrian."
""
""
""

"For the price, a very solid beer and one that you can offer to more timid beer drinkers as a chance to have something with a bit of character.  I know a couple guys who won't drink anything darker than lemonade who love this stuff."
""
""
""
"Nothing really great or good with this beer other than it's ease of drink-ability."
""
""
"The quintessential amber beer."

"This beer is my go-to beer, especially for the price. It is great all year round, but especially refreshing in the summertime. I love it paired with a good grillout/tailgate experience. It is not one of the best beers I have had, but is a tasty, reliable beer for your money."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a glass. Nordeast isn't the best tasting beer in the market, but for the price it is very difficult to find beers that can compare in drinkability and refreshness. It's my go to beer both in the winter and summer and will continue to be my first choice for reasonable priced beer. Look is what one expects from amber lager. Smell is a good balance of malt and wheat and a sample of honey. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. This beer can be drank all day and should be the go to beer for any trip to Minnesota; especially on a budget."

"for the money i would generally choose somthing else."
"Pours a pretty dark amber with a thin off-white head that leaves a good amount of sticky lacing when sipped. Not much of a smell actually, just some malt and floral. The taste is lightly sweet upfront but isn't over done at all with a little dry finish from the malt. Just the right amount of carbonation and a very easy drinking brew. Has a clean crisp taste that is very enjoyable! Really like this one."

"O- Easily one of the best domestic beers of this style that I've ever had. This is not one of those craft beers so I see why people would not go nuts over something like this but at the same time I can see why it is so successful. Its a beer that can be enjoyed by all, no off putting flavors or bad aftertastes or anything like this. I've been told this is a beer that is indicative of the Schell lagers and if that is the case I will have to try some. This beer would satisfy most drinkers in my opinion but would be a real treat for someone like myself who typically drinks domestic beers like Miller or Yuengling. A terrific beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is well brewed beer. Definitely a step up from the big boring American Light Lagers. Original comes to mind. Refreshing and not over-filling, easy drinking beer. I could and have kicked back several liters on a summer evening."

"Note - I chuckled as I poured this into a glass. This is one of those beers where it is perfectly fine to drink out of bottle (*gasp*)"

"One of those beers where the total is greater than the sum of the parts (hence the higher overall rating)"

"Not really worth doing a full a review, but I'm just going say this is my preferred drinking beer. Being from Minnesota this is easily accessible and cheap, and my go to if I'm at the bar and not feeling adventurous or if you want a beer to give to guests without stooping to the bottom beers. Tastes decent and goes down easy, and if I had more then a couple I wouldn't feel bad about it. For what it is it's my ideal beer on a budget."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Merely mediocre. It's Grian Belt Premium plus a bit of flavor minus a bit of nostalgia."
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: I've had this beer before and didn't really think much of it. It's one of those beers that you have on hand once in a while but doesn't deserve to be on a regular rotation in your fridge. However, for the novice beer drinker Nordeast is a good starting point if you want to get into darker beers but fear that they might be overwhelming."
""
""
""
"O: Yum. Love this beer. Every time one of my friends to MN, I always tell them to get me some of this. It's in the same league as other macros, but the taste is far superior."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Like I said before, ""The Belt"" is an easy drinking, cheap alternative to all the macro choices out there. This is one for people who don't want to be like every body else. By far, not the best beer out there, but definitely worth a try sometime."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: You know… I, um… Probably won’t be buying this again unless I find myself at one of those frozen lake fishing contests where a handful of people fish and everyone else gets drunk. I love Minnesota, but Schell lagers are just not my thing."
""
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma doesn't have much going on other than a heavy dose of grain and sweet malt. The flavor is very similar, with grain and a little bit of fruit, which I can't really identify. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Fairly straightforward and not offensive, but something I cared too much for."

"It's OK. A lot of people love this beer, I just like it."
"A big shout out to cpolking for sending this beer. Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, caramel. Taste is very refreshing, crisp, bready, some malts and caramel, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while, but there are better beers in the style."

"Pours out a completely transparent standard amber color with a foam collar and no lacing. At first the aroma was strictly metallic, but as it warmed up it changed into a grassy hopping on top of raw grain aroma. Tastes of mostly raw grains (and a bit of wheat chaff) as well, the moniker ""grain belt"" was definitely well-chosen. The grassy hopping rises up and settles down without a fuss in the light bodied finish that definitely refreshes like a lawnmower beer. Not bad, not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall a decent brew for the price point, perhaps a step up from the run of the mill premium"
""

"amber in color with some garnet highlights that showed off the sides of the glass quite nicely. Small white head was short lived and left behind a broken crown and only minimal lacing. Aroma of bready malts, hints of caramel, candied sugar, a touch of spicy apple at times, but seemed to be a little light to me. Warming brought out a touch of a roasted note for me now as well. Clean feel, nicely carbonated albeit a touch thin for the style. Flavor did not hold up as well as the aroma did to be honest. I was really expecting a bit more from this one."

"O- Depends on how you look at it. It isn't even close to as good as most craft brews. But when you compare it to the BMCs of the world, it ain't so bad."
"Overall: A surprise winner! I got this from a neighbor who works at a distributor...he told me his favorite beer was Bud Light, and I was a bit concerned when he recommended the Grain Belt Nordeast...but man, I definitely trust him now!"
"Sweet malty smell, maple syrup and caramel, a touch grainy and sugary. Flavors are similar, sweet and malty, caramel and husky toasted grains blend with an odd fruity ""Hawaiian Punch"" note. Not too far off from cereals like Froot Loops or Fruity Pebbles, for what it's worth. Watery but fairly malty, it's merely average. Not terrible, sort of a macro version of a craft lager. Something I wouldn't refuse if offered, but probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Found this one in the bottle drawer of my doppelganger's fridge. Figured why not; a tick is a tick afterall... Served from bottle into a Greenville Beer Exchange shaker. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head to none quickly. There was no lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutmeg, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, grain, wheat, and subtle caramel hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing really too exciting going on here at all. I can tell that they were aiming for an Amber, but they fell short with the hop profiles on this one. Better than most adjunct lagers, but that isn't saying too much."
"Pours a clear darkish copper with a thin eggshell head. Aroma is cereal grain, light grassy and spicy hops, toast and a hint of corn sweetness, some caramel notes come out as it warms a bit. Flavor is cereal, a little toast, more corny sweetness, hay, some spicy hops and a touch of corn sileage. Palate is thin and has a neutral, watery feel throughout with a fairly heavy carbonation. Better than I expected, honestly."
"Overall: A solid and easy drinking red lager. Sweet and fairly balanced."
"Overall a solid dark lager and a nice easy- drinking Minnesota throw-back beer."
"This is a good lawn mower beer. Hot day, in the sun, lighter drinker with some flavor. Drink cold though that adjunct begins to show with time."
"Overall I enjoy this beer. I've had Grain Belt Premium and I think it tastes like blueberries, which grosses me out about halfway through my 2nd bottle. This however has a great balance of flavor, has just the right body for the heavier malt/yeast flavor. I recommend at least trying it."
"Overall- The quality of this beer does not match the local hype. While it is significantly better and differentiated from Grain Belt Premium, this is not much of a step up. The flavor is not present enough to call this a craft beer. It's a pseudo-craft beer. While it isn't something that need be poured down the drain, I would not recommend it to those who are looking for premium craft beer quality. Then again, it isn't sold at a craft beer price."
"Prosit!"
"I looked at the website description before sampling. It was served with a nice cream colored to very light tan, fine head, that slowly subsided to a ring around the top, a tiny bit of lace, some bubble streams. Color was a nice clear medium amber. Aroma was beery and a bit of malt. Flavor was mainly sweet with a little malt thrown in. Body and carbonation were ok. Finish was like flavor. Fairly shallow overall. The darker color, I think, predisposes one to think there's more malt in here than there is. Didn't really pick up on the advertised bitterness. Not planning on having more."
"D/O- I liked this one overall. Very easy drinking and smooth. May have liked it a tad more than Grain Belt Premium, slightly more flavorful. Would be a great one to share with a BMC person"
"These go down nice and smooth and easy. Leave the Negro Modelo to collect dust on the shelf. Chase yer burrito with this instead. Sans lime."
"Pours with a thin head that sticks around for less than a minute. Almost no discernible odor, what I can pick up is grassy or vegetable-like. The taste of toasted malts and sweet caramel is very pleasant...and very prominent, considering that it doesn't smell like anything. Nordeast seems thick for its style, it's not something I would feel like drinking quickly- it's more like a beer one would nurse."
"Overall-Amazing how much better Nordeast is vs Grain Belt's premium lager. The few times I've had this on tap it's been a little better (Cleaner taste with more robust mouthfeel) than in the bottle. A great alternative to the large scale lagers."
"Overall, better than premium"
"Not a whole lot else going on with this beer, but more appreciative than a beer from the big 3. or is it big 2 now????"
"I'll give it high praise from a Minnesotan: ""Not bad!"""
"Overall, there isn't a lot to say about this beer, but I kind of like it. It is really easy to drink and something I wouldn't mind having a few of in an evening."
"Good drinkability, solid beer. Nothing special at all, but pretty solid."
"D - This is an okay lager. I understand the historical love/nostalgia for Grain Belt and the Nordeast neighborhood of the TC, but this isn't something I'll be stocking up on during my annual trips to MN."
"D-its drinkable with a lower ABV..its great to knock back some of these while bowling in the winter..its really just average"
"This is a substantial improvement over Grain Belt Premium because it has more flavor and character. It is not a craft beer so don't expect the crafted experience. My take is that if you want a routine ""drinkin' beer", this is better than the rest."
"I never understood why this beer is popular, though I suppose I'll drink it in preference to other, shittier macro lagers. The low flavor, light body, and high carbonation make it easy to drink, but I have to knock it a bit on drinkability for that buttery aroma/aftertaste-it certainly does not make me want to drink more of it."
"Clear, clean, medium copper body. Pinkie finger of dirty off-white head. Some lacing. Sweetish honey malts mix with caramel and very mild grassy hops. Lightly toasted malts up front. Sweetish graham crackers and honeyed biscuit malts unfold. Doughy and clean, with a hint of adjunct-ness. Mostly clean finish with some residual sweetness. Moderate body with a crisp feel. Tasty and very easy drinking. I don't know if this beats the original though!"
"There are worse adjunct lagers out there, but regardless, this is a pretty unimpressive effort. Seeing a BA score of B for this beer gives me a much better understanding of the score Masala Mama gets on BA as well."
"But given the substandard bottling and the lack of response from Grain Belt about it, I will not be buying it again."
"Overall drinkability was fine. A decent beer to drink at a tailgating party but nothing I would seek out or probably drink again."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable would drink this again, and is relatively inexpensive"
"Drinkability: Maybe not much going on, but it is well constructed and easy to kick back. Better than the standard Grain Belt."
"Put down three of these with ease. A very nice session beer with a good amount of taste. If Premium and Schell's Dark had a child, this would be the outcome. Glad I finally tried it."
"Probably the best of the new retro-themed beers, aside from maybe the new/old Schlitz. It's an amazing session and for its price I really don't think it can be beaten. It's like Yuengling only better."
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is very manageable. Light sweetness is present, smooth, not overwhelming. Avoiding bitter flavors will appeal to the masses."
"Had a few bottles with friends and I have to say, this isn't much more that Grain Belt Amber. It had the same sweet roasted corn taste and grainy background, but with a touch more caramel malt and a little more hop bitterness. I guess it's still an improvement over Grain Belt (which isn't that bad), but for a cold and simple lager I'll stick to Full Sail Session."
"The good folks in New Ulm definitely took the 'belt of grain' out of this Grain Belt Nordeast release. Eventually another six pack of bottles will find their way into my fridge, after I get over the sticker shock, that is."
"Deep bronze/amber colors a crystal clear body, capped by foamy white head that dissipates to some light, bubbly lacing. Smell has a little bit of grassiness and something just a tiny tiny bit skunky, but supported by a lot of sweet caramel malt smell. Taste is smooth and very sweet, a sweetness like pure cane sugar. Yet, its not overly sweet and has a clean enough finish that the beer still has a bit of refreshing taste. Medium body and weight, moderately smooth mouthfeel. Easy drinking, unique tasting lager that's slightly sweeter than a Vienna style."
"Still, Nordeast is at least worth a try. I'd have it again."
"This beer pours a clear light amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of spicy hops with a solid caramel backbone. This beer smells a lot hoppier than I thought it would, and I like that. The taste is similar to the aroma. There are some nice hops up front than a bit of caramel and even toffee on the back end. The flavor disappears very quickly though leaving absolutely no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is also disappointing thin, and a little too highly carbonated. Overall, there are a number of good things going on in this beer. Unfortunately, there are a few bad things going on too, and they stand in the way of the good things becoming really good things. Such as shame. If only the taste and mouthfeel stood up to the aroma I would really be impressed. As is I'd rather be drinking Grain Belt Premium."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing for an amber beer. It goes down very well and refreshing. A solid late summer, early fall brew."
"Perfectly clear amber body. Thin and bubbly beige head. Lacing comes in sporadic rings. Sweet malty aroma. Clean and crisp lagered flavor. Malty and smooth. Not too overly sweet. Caramel maltiness forms the base of this beer. And the substance. Medium full body. Actively carbonated. This'll be a nice drinker this summer."
"D: This is right up there with the most ""drinkable"" American Adjunct Lagers, even though as far as I know it's all malt. I would say to me it's quite a bit more drinkable, but even regular Joe Six-pack BMC drinker should find it so."
"To answer the ultimate question, ""Do I want to have second one?"" Absolutely!"
"A winner and great addition to the lineup."
"definitely recommended. good stuff."
"Nothing special, not bad at all though. Haven't had regular Grain Belt in awhile, so I'm not sure if I prefer this to the original."
"Grain Belt Nordeast is surprisingly good. In fact, I'd choose it over every pale or amber lager of the old school sort... except for the outstanding Schlitz Gusto. When's the next cookout?"
" Light to medium bodied, has some lingering flavor. It's a drinkable beer, and good for a hot summer day while mowing the lawn. Not something I would drink on a daily basis, but overall decent."
"The taste is also sweet and bready malts with some hops. Starts mildly sweet, and there is a bit of bitter hops at the finish. Light to medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and a bit of a dry finish. Very drinkable, and very good."
"August Schell Grain Belt Nordeast pours a finger of creamy foam over a clear deep amber brew. Carbonation is strong and steady, and the nose is adjunct lager all the way- sweet corn, lager yeast, maybe a little fruitiness. Flavor is more of that corn sweetness, that fruit note again (apple skin maybe), and just a little bit of some kind of herbal hops off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This actually seems a lot like a darker version of another Schell product, their Lakemaid beer. They're both corn lagers with a taste of real hops, something like training wheels, almost..."
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Nordeast, but it is an easy drinking beer that I prefer over the standard Grain Belt. GB is a little too sweet/malt liquor tasting to me, Nordeast reminds me more of Sam Adams Light. Not super flavorful, but an easy drinker and good session beer."
"M/D - Another enjoyable brew from New Elm. Not quite a medium bodied brew, light and very easy to drink more than one. I recommend this brew if it is still around. I brought this brew to DarkLord day and had some good reviews from others outside of Minnesota"
"Great amber orange color with a trillion miniature carbonation bubbles zipping forever upward, no lacing, but surprisingly decent head retention. Ugh, this smell is awful. Smells like a dirty old penny, very metallic, with a touch of grainy notes in the background. Taste is incredibly light, barely anything going on there. There are some very soft flavors of caramel and bread, but not much, metallic, and the hops are non-existent. How dare they put the Grain Belt name on this beer?! Sorry Schell's, but this is not very good at all."
"Was expecting something a little different at first, but the more I thought about it, this is pretty much what I should have expected. Not bad, but nothing special."
"Have you ever thought Grain Belt was too sweet to enjoy, but you like everything else? This is your beer. Please forgive the short review. I'll review Grain Belt another time. When I do, just add ""not as sweet as Premium"" to the review, and you'll have my brilliant review for this."
"As is, this is one heck of a sessionable brew to have a bunch of when in the need of a good outside/grilling, BBQing, lawn mowing, fishing, yard working, sit back and enjoy the day away kind of beer."
"D- Easily drinkable. Great brew."
"Poured from a clear bottle. Clear amber color with one inch of white head that has very good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. Smells like a grain mill. Slightly musty and spoilled grain aroma. Also pick up some grass and mint. Just not crazy about the flavor. Too grainy for me. Some earthy and grassy hop flavor. Bitterness is very low. Much more substantial body than most lagers. Definately more than adjunct lagers which is the point. Not as drinkable as regular Grain Belt and combined with a flavor I was not crazy about, keeps drinkability around average."
"A good lawnmower beer. Painting the garage today, so it works perfectly for what I will be doing. Drinkability is pretty high, as the abv is low."
"D: I had several pours from the pitcher, and this beer did not begin to feel heavy. The sweetness of the malt did however compound somewhat with each drink, making later pours a little sweeter than I'd like."
"Drinkability: A good simple American Amber beer that will appeal to the casual beer drinker and to some craft beer drinkers as well. It probably won't win many awards (other than clever targeted marketing), but it's a decent beer that is a nice homage to my little NE Minneapolis neighborhood. I know I will probably be drinking plenty more of this in the future at local watering holes."
"D= Excellent brew. I think this is just a little step up from Premium without making it too much of a craft beer lovers only beer. This is a nice step from the ordinary. Nothing crazy or special just a good easy drinking Amber Lager for a hard working guy after the job is done; exactly what Grain Belt was trying to portrait. Excellent work."
