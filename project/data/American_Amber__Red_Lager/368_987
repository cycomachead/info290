The taste brings in more of the same, along with more brown sugar, some cinnamon, some light maple syrup, and a twinge of ginger. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish.

It's not a bad mix, but I'd enjoy the beer just as much without it. The malt gives a dry, crisp bready caramel with a hint of toffee. The lager feels a little off and lacks the fruity esters of a winter warmer. Though I guess if we're calling it an amber lager, it does alright. Worth a try.","tempest","Nov 14, 2011"

The aroma is of toffee, and caramel with a very faint hint of herbal hops. The taste is very sweet with a ton of caramel. The faint hop character that is noticeable in the aroma is not present in the taste, and I think that is a real shame as it might have helped things from becoming as cloying as they are. The mouthfeel is full bodied and sticky with low carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer that I'm sure a lot of people would really like, but I can't see myself drinking it again as it is just far too cloying for my tastes.","KarlHungus","Jan 08, 2011"

The aroma consists of caramel sweetness from toasted malt nicely balanced by spicy notes from the hops, clove perhaps. Sweet and grainy on the palate. The spice from the hops lingers a few seconds after the beer has been swallowed. The faintest indication of a metallic character also lingers. It is not strong enough to be off-putting but certainly exists. This light-bodied brew is good.

I purchased this one at my favorite liqour spot, when I was in Whitewater (for college), Corido's Liqour Locker. When I got home, I popped off the top and started to enjoy it. I was suprised at how sweet the beer, was seeing that Capital, to me, is more bitter than usual. After that it was surely enjoyable.

The flavor is caramel and some hints of toffee. Its like a Killians Red, but actually good. The feel is right at the interface between moderate and thick, with hints of a creamy texture in there.

It's distinctly malty in the aroma with only a hint of floral hops in the background. The body is decidedly medium, and combines with its moderate carbonation to leaves it silky smooth and creamy across the palate. Rich, grainy, Munich malt dominates the flavor. It's well-balanced by a firm bitterness and tempered by its mild, floral and spicy hop flavors. The alcohol never becomes apparent; and although it's not particularily complex, it never fails to satisfy.

3.73,1.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Somewhat of a dark copper color on the pour. A small white head that wants to take off early. Some lacing occuring. This is an interesting concoction. Reminded me of sam adams double bock on the first taste. Some caramel taste, slight hop bitterness. Theres no listing of the alcohol content, but it might be a little higher than some. I'll say this, next winter i will pick up another 6er of this.","Tballz420","Apr 17, 2003"
3.88,5.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Brilliantly clear ruddy bronze hue, topped by an ivory white uniformily thick, well retained head. Sparse lace remains. The aroma is dominated by a combination of grassy and pronounced spicy noble hops, underset by mellow toasty Munich and medium caramel malt sweetness. Snap of candyish sweetness is perceived upfront, then is tapered by mellow toast and mild, clean, functional hop bitterness. Hop bitterness is evanescent, allowing sweetness to quickly reemerge along with a mildly toffeeish caramel malt and melanoidin combination mid palate. Herbal hop flavor adds a mellow, chlorophyll tinged contrast. Moderately bodied overall, but a touch thin and fleeting in mouthfeel. Finishes lightly sweet and bready, but otherwise clean and crisp. Winter Skai is a unique, balanced brew. It seems to occupy a precarious niche between dunkels and hellesbocks, having elements of both. Tasty. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for sending the bottle!","marc77","Apr 12, 2003"
4.54,23.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Color is a clear amber with a thin off-white bubbly-foamy head that fizzed away after a minute and had some light patchy lace. Smell is very nice, its a sweet fruity delight of green grapes along with a bit of apple and peach and has a smoothing sweet malt backing. The smell and taste was very close to Hales Wee Heavy Winter but just a tad lighter. The taste is mild and light with a clean, sweet, smooth malt with a very slight and mildly bright hop thats citrusy/tangy, just a bit of green grapes and apple; all very subtle and smooth. Feel is light bodied and silky smooth, has a interesting light tang hold that reminds me of a wet wine and gets barely dry in the finish. This is very drinkable and is a very subtle, intesting beer. Yep, I liked it. Thank you, may I have another.","tavernjef","Apr 06, 2003"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The color on the pour a limpid deep copper, the head portly in size, frothy in texture and a nice light tan color, as it dissipates the lace left behind seals off the glass. Personally I think this a sign of a well-brewed beer, along with the bazillion tiny bubbles lifting from the bottom of the glass. Nose malt and lightly sweet, musty and a tad yeasty, fresh and pleasing the nose on this beer. Start sweet, lots of malt top moderate in its feel, finish has a delightful hop spicy presence, the carbonation tolerable and the aftertaste somewhat dry, quite a quaffable brew it is true.","Gusler","Mar 23, 2003"

Maybe it got better over the months, or maybe my mind and tastes have been altered, but it's better than I said. Much better. When the new batch comes out, I'll do a better one.","feloniousmonk","Mar 10, 2003"
4.08,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"What a great appearance this beer has, shiny amber and a rather large, creamy head that leaves a nice lace. Strong maltiness is in the aroma, nice caramel nature. The mouthfeel is nicely creamy, very smooth beer. Flavors of malt sweetness and caramelization hit first, and then some hops are evident through the finish. I'm very pleased with this beer. I bought it on a whim and got lucky, worth a try for sure.","AudioGilz","Jan 13, 2003"

3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Copper in color with a light beige head. Malty aroma smells too much like the spent grain we used to feed our dairy cows when I was growing up for my liking. Nice lightly roasted malt flavor that is well balanced by the hops. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. I had Capital's Summer Tour Pack and felt the beers were all good and a couple were very good. This peaked my interest in their Winter Skal which thanks to Bighuge I was able to obtain. This is a solid beer, but it didn't acheive that very good to exceptional score in my book that I was hoping for.","PhantomVodoo","Dec 22, 2002"
4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours amber with a malty spicy smell. The taste is big on caramel malt and the hops start to come through as it warms. I can see why others might call this a lager rather than an ale. Whatever it is, I enjoyed it and I'm sure I will enjoy the remaining three.","ethosx19","Nov 17, 2002"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a clear copper in color with an off - white head. Signs of carbonation present in 3 columns of small bubbles. Aroma primarily consists of malts and hops. Creamy mouthfeel with a mild carbonation tingle in the middle. Bready malt flavor with a touch of spiciness in the finish. Very reminiscent of an Oktoberfest. Not what I expected in a winter seasonal beer, but very good non-the-less.","Winter","Jun 28, 2002"
3.9,6.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Clear copper color, not much head to describe, just a trace in 45 seconds. Firm but not heavy sense of caramel to the malty aroma. Satiny mouthfeel, sense of brown sugar and good toast impressions. Hop sparkle close to the swallow. What's somewhat dissappointing is the mid-mouth flavor. The early malty tastes seem to vanish, giving this beer an awkward pause in the middle. This beer is good, and a step away from being truly solid.","ADR","Feb 08, 2002"
3.58,-2.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Capital Winter Skal:  Cripes, I know it’s the dead of summer, but they sold it to my wife last week, so its gotta be reviewed.  Hey, not bad!  Deep red beer, with a great big hops aroma (good sign in June) The taste was full of malt, with a pleasant spiciness, followed up with hops in the follow through and the aftertaste.  Not bad for an old beer (thank you hops). I’ll look for this next Dec. 21.","jackndan","Feb 02, 2002"
4.62,25.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lighter amber in color and clear.  Medium  and fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Aroma is very pleasant and complex with qualities of malt and hops, plus alcohol and an almost spicy quality.  Has the thinner quality of a lager, yet a heartiness to it.  Taste is complex too with the hop bitterness dominating, but the caramel malt helping to rounding it off and make it very smooth.  Pretty dry finish and that remains for a lingering aftertaste.  This is as complex a lager as I have tasted. It has the Vienna qualities of a lager with maltiness and smoothness of a California Common.","garymuchow","Beers"
4.83,31.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is just an outstanding lager.  It IS my favorite lager of all time.  It has a beautiful appearance and smell, delicious taste and a smooth clean finish.  Could drink a lot of these in one sitting.","Bighuge","0"
