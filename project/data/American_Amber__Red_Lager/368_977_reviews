"Basically an average at best beer. Nothing about it really stands out, and the funky aftertaste doesn't help matters. There are better beers out there."
""
"This is essentially an ""Amber lite", not bad but nothing special.  Has a light cherry smell to it,  watered down mouth feal , probably would be great if you enjoy amber type  beer but want something for a hot summer evening or out on the golf course.  Smooth malt with no noticeable  hop bite to it. Had a half inch of foam that dissipated in less than one minute."

"This seems like a basic amber brew with enough going for it to recommend, but not enough going for it to strike an emotional chord or otherwise stand out in one’s beer drinking memory. I warmed up to it more with repeated sips and I now appreciate this beer for what it is- an everyday amber beer that is non- pretentious and agreeable, even if not exceptional. Some may say it is underwhelming, but it does have enough going for it to recommend."

"Ok, but just doesn't have that much flavor or body. Fairly refreshing, however."

"In writing the review, I've noticed a repeating word. The label says that it is medium bodied, I'm thinking light bodied - but, I suppose that it is subjective. Anyway, if this is medium-bodied, it pushes towards the light interpretation of medium. It would have been a better brew if it had more body to it. As it is, it is a basic, easy-drinking amber lager. Decent for what it is."

"O: all around decent beer. True to the style but lacked any distinctive features."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinking Amber with a good malt forward profile. I've had Ambers that run the gammet of being so bitter they were basically an IPA to very sweet and malty. This was somewhere in between and being a lager made me want to drink another pint. Prost!"

"O. It's not going to win any awards, but for a low ABV amber-style lager, this ain't half bad. Toes the line dangerously close to the adjunct style with its spent grain bill and corn sweetness. Still, it succeeds in being light and refreshing, with just enough caramel and malt complexity to keep it interesting, as well. Reminds me a bit of Yuengling and I imagine this is a popular choice in Wisconsin for both the craft enthusiast caught in a non-craft setting and for the BA-in-training trying to graduate from the adjunct swill currently pedaled in Wisconsin. Happy to have had this very approachable beer from Capital."

"O - Another tasty brew that offers up the basics of the style without overwhelming the palette. Easy drinking and a session ale that I could easily take down a few pints at a time. Nothing mind blowing, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
"D - Average amber ale. Traditional crisp later feel and taste. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Moderate, off-white head, average retention, suddsy lacing. Aroma includes caramel malts, mild brown sugar, maybe a touch of butter (unfortunately). Taste also with a bit of mild sweetness, mainly caramel, very low bitterness. Pretty easy to drink, maybe just a touch of off flavor on the back end but not a bad beer, just not spectacular."
""

""

"Beer is medium-bodied, with mid-level carbonation that leads this to foam up substantially on the palate. The resulting mouthfeel is somewhat frothy and creamy, with a semi-dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can understand why this is one of Capital Brewery's flagship beers, it was very enjoyable. It goes down smooth and is refreshing. It is a great amber lager with character."
""
""
"D/O: This amber lager's harsh flavor and uninspiring texture seem to be out of agreement with the relatively appealing smell. While the style as a whole seems to be defined by unremarkable features, some amber lagers are still better than this. Look to Karl Strauss' flagship amber lager as a well-executed, but still conservative example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- The mouthfeel is between light and medium bodies with a good amount of carbonation. "
""
""

""

"had on tap at kellehers and got a free glass with it! a nice clear amber body with a fingers worth of head that has good staying power. nose is hoppy and sweet. taste is caramel and hops. mouthfeel feels a tad thin and watery, most lagers taste that way to me though. overall not a bad beer, but i dont usually go for lagers or reds, but enjoyed this one."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer worth drinking for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hoppier than most amber lagers. Goes flat rather quickly. Overall sweet and bitter with faint aromas."
""
"Pours a semi-cloudy amber color with about an inch of a frothy white head. Scent of toasted malts and caramel malts. The taste is mostly of toast malts that are slightly crisp and bitter mixed with some hints of citrus as well. Finishes with a slight dry after taste. Definitely much better than I was expecting. An overall great amber brew!"

"Has a semi-hazy golden amber appearance with a short-lived white foam collar, no lacing. Smells faintly of a mild biscuit malt, and that's about it. Tastes of the same mildly sweet biscuit malt, and that's about it. Hops are so far into the background as to be really close to no hopping at all...body is carbonated well and light in texture without feeling watery. But so far, this offering by Capital has been a disappointment for me. I would have liked to have tasted something a bit less... blandly one dimensional. I'd call this one a lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is much like the aroma. grains, biscuit malt, and a small hop presence. Nothing which really stands out. Light to medium bodied, average carbonation. Not much aftertaste. Overall. a rather ordinary unimpressive beer."

"O) This is an enjoyable brew. It is remarkably easy to drink. No rough edges. They're not taking any risks with the formula here, just making a good red lager, and I think that is the point."
"It has a little bit of a skunky off color taste, but it is well below the rest of the flavors. I may never get another opportunity to buy this, but I would consider it ifI did."
"Opening NFL Sunday!!! Starting with a can of Wisconsin Amber!!! Yeah baby!!! The beer is a cloudy red ale with thin white head. The smell has a slight sweet malt to it....not much else. The taste has a great malt character with touch of sweetness. The mouthfeel is great...very favorful decent abv and smooth. Definitely worth teh purchase!"
"So I have had this both in the can and on tap, and I actually preferred it in the can. Pours a dark amber with a 1 finger head. The smell is pretty straight forward, bready malty sweetness, a little bit of caramel, and a faint amount of citrus. Tastes mainly bready and malty, caramel, and a little copper/metallic flavor. The caramel sweetness really come out as the beer warms up, tastes much better at 50-60 degrees. This finishes rather clean, fairly standard bodied beer here. Refreshing on a warm day, otherwise nothing to write home about."
"D - A pretty solid, if somewhat unremarkable, amber ale. Lots of malt with more than enough hop character to balance; though it isn't a hoppy, west coast red ale by any stretch."
"Cheers!"
"D Superb."
"This one pours a healthy red amber color with a tiny head. Aroma is sweet caramel malts with a bit of graininess. Taste is a smooth, slightly earthy caramel maltiness with a bit of grains to liven it up. This one feels good going down, it's lighter bodied, but the carbonation smooths it out very well. The drinkability is also exceptional. Overall, it's a solid, drinkable Amber Lager. What else can I say?"
"O - Capital seems to be adept at making tasty straightfoward offerings; no exception here."
"EDIT-Had it immediatly after a Fat Tire and when I had this one, I almost tasted a medicine like bittnerness that was not pleasant. I won't lower the score too much but when compared to something else similar I did not like this."
"O: nice malty lager, a little sweet, good drinkability"
"D: Wouldnt choose it for the style, but would drink it to drink in the sun."
"""Beer for badgers"" is a tasty amber. Has a nicer amber color to it and a head that quickly dissolves to nothing. Smell matches the taste, nothing over powering or out of place. Overall it's a good beer, not the best amber I've ever tried but in no way bad. I would drink it again but I am bringing home 2 mixed cases of local Wisconsin beers that I've tried while here and this one didn't make the cut, only because it's nothing too special."
"I will probally get a pack of this over the summer and/or fall. It's really great, i would love to camp with this too."
"drinkability is not good - i will never buy this beer again and after i finish this 6 pack i highly doubt i will ever drink this again"
"D - This is one of those beers that you could stock your fridge with and drink all night. I think it would also bode well with those that haven't ensconced themselves in the world of craft brews. A good starter brew to get your macro drinking friends drinking good beer. Nicely done, a good red lager."
"D-Good for a couple-nothing special for this style"
"Pretty good beer. I had this one on new year's eve at Towne Inn in Jefferson, WI. Nice amber color, smelled pretty good. It was an average tasting amber beer. Good taste though, hint of orange peel, wouldn't mind trying it again sometime. It's an easy drinking beer."
"It blows my mind with the myriad of options before me that I've never reviewed this style of beer before, until now! This beer pours a decent deeper copper color with a good firm looking white foam head. This beer smells of orange citrus hops upfront which are quickly swallowed by a balance of caramel and clove, i also think I detected some egg and cinnamon. Though the picture I painted for the aroma may seem tasty, I just don't think it meshed well and seemed unbalanced. After smelling the aromas I was intrigued as to what this beer would taste like, the answer was ""not much"". That having been said there is a malty taste in the foreground that is washed away by what is seemingly no real flavor at all just vague light beer-ness, and it's all finished off with an off-putting bitterness that seems not really to be appropriate with the flavors involved. This beer is a little too watery for my liking as well though it does have some nice carbonation. As much as it may sound like I'm bashing this beer it's not really all that bad, it's just not really something I'm leaning towards getting in the future."
"I'm putting some of this beer in the cooler and we're headed to the lake for some skinny-dipping."
"Thanks to resi for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, some hops. Taste is good, hops up front, a bit of caramel and malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Taste, pretty smooth, don't be looking for some high hopped west coast amber. No surprises, mildly sweet, caramel, drinks almost like an Oktoberfest. Almost as good as the Sprecher Amber Lager. Same vein. Good hot n humid beer to relax with."
"Another brew taken down during the Man's Weekend. It pours a clear reddish-amber topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest and peel, hot cinnamon, and some smoky toffee. The taste holds notes of light orange zest and light caramel. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, not much exciting going on here, but a nice enough brew to relax with."
"A: Head is thick and tightly packed with good retention, lots of activity in the beer, deep gold to light amber in color - 4.00, S: Mild caramelly sweetness, a touch of nuttiness to the nose, faint fruit maybe some pear as well as some breadiness, light bubble gum - 3.50, Lots of malty caramels, mild hop bite, very light molasses or brown sugar, quite toasty, a solid amber ale - 3.50, M: Medium bodied, smooth finish - 3.50, D: A nice version of the style - pretty solid, quite drinkable - 3.50"
"The mouthfeel was not too thick, not too thin. I rather liked this beer. It would be in the rotation in my fridge if I lived in Wisconsin."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is sweet, malty, with a very slight hop note, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, very slight hop note, with some caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"Drinks fairly easy but lack of character makes this one boring & forgettable"
"Definitely a nice beer by capital. An easy drinker that strikes all the right notes."
"I had this beer from a bottle once and really didn't like it. I contributed this to the bottle being old. After having this on tap at Capital Brewery, I would like to think it was the bottle. This was a very enjoyable beer. It is a dark amber color, nice head. Very nice flavor, not too strong or light. Definitely a fairly easy beer to drink in my opinion."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a copper orange with a big fluffy white head that leaves no lacing whatsoever. The aroma of this beer is pretty malty. Sweet toffee, caramel, and toasty bread. Pretty solid. The flavor follows suit with caramel and toffee leading the way with toast and biscuits, earth and grassy hops all coming through. This is a really drinkable lager. Nice and malt with some subtle grassy hops. Really tasty stuff. The mouthfeel is light with a nice finishing dryness. Its really tasty. I wish this were available in the KC area, it could easily become a summer drinker."
"D - This was a pretty decent beer. It somehow made its way into my fridge, so I was more than happy to try it. I think I would go for something else by this brewery if I were at the store. However, I wouldn't pass it up if offered (or left in my fridge)."
"A decent enough Amber Lager. The overall flavor profile could probably be beefed up a little bit, but I have no other real complaints."
"D - Not very pleasant but straight from the can at a tale gate party, it would work. Better from a bottle it seems."
"They just got this on tap at my local drunkery. I dig it. I really like the look of a nice well made amber. This is pretty. Christal clear copper with about three inches of off white head that hangs around in the pint glass pretty much the whole time. The smell kind of reminds of biscuits or home made bread, with a good dose cf sweet caremel malts. You can tell there are a fair amount hops hanging around in there. It tases more or less how it smells. Dry, biscuity up front, sweetens up with a little roasty malt presence and then a little bitter after taste from the hops. This is good. It went down awesome with some hot buffalo wings."
"Living in Chicago it is not always so easy to find a wide variety of Wisconsin beers (I drive to Milwaukee to buy East Side Stein Beer from Lakefront Brewery and more than just the two offerings of Sprecher I can get here). But this one I have found here and I think it is a winner."
"Wisconsin Amber is a great session beer, a light-bodied brew with toasted malt up front to make things interesting."
"Pours a clear, golden / copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, yeast, slight grain, and slight metallic. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of hops, yeast, slight grain, and hints of sweet malt. Overall, a very hoppy lager with little else as far as flavor."
"D. A good session beer although I think it lacks character."
"It pours a brownish red color with a nice amount of tan head. The smell is malty with hints of hops. The taste is very nice. Malty with a bit of caramel and nice hop bite on the finish. The beer is very tame in the mouth. It's light and easy on the palate. I polished off a case of this in four days so if that's not a vote for good drinkabilty then I don't know what is."
"Picked up a single of this for old times sake - this and Sprecher were the first micros that got me into beer. Looks good poured into a pint glass amber/orange tight head a couple fingers, no lace though. Smells of grain and some toast malt. Tastes malty with not a lot of hops certainly not deep - finishes higher in the buds than more heavily hopped and more bitter beers - more dry and clean. Mouthfeel is decently carbed lighter body and very drinkable."
"D- The beer is fair it's a good one for a hot summer night. A step up from macros but not my first choice for an amber lager. It's pretty cheap too."
"One of the staples of Wisconsin, I've been drinking Cap Amber for years and haven't reviewed it until now. True to the name, it's a clear and spicy amber color with a thin tan head. The nose is very robust and malty with some nutty overtones. First taste is, you guessed it, robust and malty. The malt is about the only major player here, but it has a wonderful complex value to the malt that I don't think my palate is good enough to pick out. Anyways its very drinkable and full of flavor and relatively clean. A good choice for a regular drink, especially in the fall in Wisconsin."
"An average amber ale from Capital. Not bad, but it just fits into a large sea of like-products."
"Notes from: 1/15/06"
"D - This is a very easy-drinking beer and very sessionable."
"Not bad, but nothing special. Probably don't need to try this one again."
"I found this to be a very easy drinking and refreshing beer. Very nice."
"Very easy to drink, Extremely refreshing. Great beer."
"Easy drinking beer, would work well in the summer heat. Shipping to get a sixer down here may work against it."
"D - The butterscotch isn't too bad, but I wouldn't pick up another."
"D - Sort of average, but very drinkable. Would be a great beer to have with a burger....which I did."
"Lightly creamy and decently carbonated. Definitely not the most spectacular beer I've had recently, but a very tasty and easy-drinking sessionable lager."
"If you can find this in cans, please beermail me. I used to, but no longer can."
"Pours a clear light amber with a fluffy off-white head that showed good retention and lacing. Smell is mainly sweet malts with caramel as well as the lighter yeast aroma with hints of citrus hops. The taste has a quick hop bite up front before settling into the sweet caramel malt backbone with a handful of spices complimenting the flavors. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and fairly creamy for a lager. The drinkability is fantastic on this lager and I could drink this all night. I'd say this is one of the better amber lagers I've tasted."
"good job kirby"
"D: Very approachable, but not for me."
"Drinkability: There's not much to say except that it's a nice, easy-drinking lager."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby. The last few times I have tried a Capital brew, I wasn't that impressed, so I am pleasantly surprised at this beer. It is pretty tasty."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Pored a light amber, with a large foamy head. Smell was very faint, not much there, really. Taste was also mild, both the initial bitter and the sweet at the end. Just a straight average lager, nothing more, nothing less."
" ~ I had one before dinner and one with dinner. Had the crew I was with been willing to stick around for a while longer I would have enjoyed a few more. At least next time I know what I'll be having. I suggest the same to you."
"Drinkability - Nothing amazing, but a very drinkable beer of a very drinkable style."
"Pretty good amber. I like the balance of the hops and malt and the sweetness paired with the floral hops gives it a predominate flavor of clover honey."
"Quite drinkable, but didn't blow me away."
"Pretty regular looking amberlage. Medium amber, copper hue with very little head and bubbling. The aroma is a crisp biscuit and grain with some light humulus lupus. The taste has some minerally bitterness interlaced with a strong grain bill. Plenty of toasted malts to go around. The palate is smooth, refreshing but you can feel some grist in this lager. Very easy to drink for me."
"D- This beer is smooth and has a good malt flavor but it is a bit watery in the taste."
"Flavor is perfectly balanced between the big malts and the spicey earthy hops... drinkable .... sessionable definately.. just enough over everything including mouthfeel to make me wish I had another... Unfortunately, this is my last Capital brew I have in my possession... I am glad I saved these for a 6-bottle flight.... Tonight, will be for a long while one of my best beer drinking nights.... Capital is an incredible brewery for somebody who tries to appreciate the ins and outs of a fine lager.... plus as an added bonus, they are made right here in the States."
"A pleasant effort which has balanced flavor and aroma. This would be a good one to sip in their beer garden."
"It is a beautiful beer. A nice white head sitting on a clear amber body. Some lacing left behind as it is consumed. The rest of the beer is rather mediocre. Nothing great and nothing bad. The sweet malt profile is evident in the aroma and taste. The sweetness isn't my favorite but it isn't overpowering so it doesn't distract too much from the beer. It also has an almost creamy mouthfeel to it that I found a bit odd. Nicely carbonated and no aftertaste to finish it off."
"Wisconsin Amber pours a bright golden amber color. This is a very pretty looking beer. A rich, sweet grainy head rises above the brew. Your tongue is met a yeasty sweet/sour flavor, which then moves to the roof of your mouth as you begin to feel the medium body and rich malty sweetness take over. Just a slight dry fruity twinge lingers on the back of your tongue, and then you're left with the same sweet grainy flavor that you started with in the head. This is a relaxing, easy sipper and a really good place to start with Wisconsin micros."
"Medium-bodied, easy drinking and refreshing, it has a good amount of flavor without being heavy, a nice session beer. The same caramel notes, mildly roasted hints, some hops, lightly sweet. Quite pleasant, will not blow your socks off but is a great example of an amber lager."
"There used to be a rich lager called Eau Claire All Malt which blew the doors off this lager, but alas the brewery is no longer."
"drinkability is very good due to the mild nature of the brew. the brew overall is very basic in every approach. a good starter beer, as well as a good brew for the non-adventurous drinker. overall, i would recommend the octoberfest by Capital in place of this one, much better."
"and sweet bread good summer beer i like it will buy again. bought this at the brewery very nice people who work there."
"Pours clear copper with an orange tint and a 1/4 inch off white head with little to no lacing down the glass. It has a sweet malt and citrus scent. The taste is quite similar to the smell. I do get little hop flavor toward the end, which is nice. Mouthfeel is light and is carbonated decently. Honestly for the sweetness you get at the beginning it seems like it would almost be the fruitier type beer that I do not care for, but it comes together at the end and balances itself out to the point where I think I could even drink one or two more."
"overall this is a really nice enjoyable beer"
"Drinkability: Admittedly, not my style. Just not a lot going on here. Sugary sweetness quickly becomes cloying."
"The mouth feel is light, smooth & slightly creamy. A good lager."
"to more than 4 or 5% alcohol by volume. Really decent!"
"I'm not a big fan of Red Lagers, they seem a bit boring. This one certainly brings something to the table. However, overall I'm still bored."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"This is a decent amber with character and full flavor. A good session beer."
"A little on the light side for my taste, but good execution, and would make a good crossover beer."
"Capital Wisconsin Amber is orange amber in color with a thick white head. It had decent retention and left lacicing. The aroma was lightly hoppy with light malt. The taste was lightly malty with a hop backround and hops in the finish. The body was light to medium with medium carbonation. Pretty good, would work for a session beer."
"Tastes of hard toast, and sourdough english muffin, again toasted dark. Add a dollop of beer jelly, and a little ovaltine on the side. This has a superb mouthfeel that is straight down the middle: thin but full. Has a great cocoa flavored biscotti taste with a dab of apple jelly. There's some minerals in the aftertaste, part dark roasted grain, and perhaps some drier hops."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Almost clear amber color. Light carbonation and light=medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts balanced, some sweetness with hops mainly in background, dry finish, tolerable amber. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"Actually, I prefer Wisconsin Amber to Winter Skal and now consider it to be the best of the (now more than a) handful of amber lagers that I've had. I've never been blown away by this brewery, but they're beginning to impress me in a quietly competent sort of way. Wisconsin Amber might just be my favorite Capital beer to date."
"D- the skunkiness through me but not bad"
"Not a bad beer just kind of watery. Not much to it."
"Note: Considerably better canned or tapped than in a bottle."
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts. It's dry with a nice malty sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a very dry, malty flavor that has some breadlike notes and a light hop finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking red lager. It's nothing fancy, but it goes easy."
"Mouthfeel is pretty watery."
"I wouldn't refuse one if offered, but would enjoy other capital brews before this one. Not bad, however."
"Dark amber in color with a fairly bright head that fell nearly instantly. Smell is very citrusy and malty. After tasting I can confirm that this beer is a couple shakes of coriander away from a belgian witbier. A bit of bitter hops with the orange-peel flavors and some round malty sweetnees, plus a teeny tiny bit of yeast in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly thin and slick. Overall the drinkability is high."
"Orange amber. Clear. Small, dirty, off-white head. Good lacing. Aromas of sweet cookie dough malts with caramel notes, and spritzy, floral hop aromas. Modest, but nice. Sweet doughy malts. Lightly toasted caramel. Smooth. Good balance. Hops are spicy and herbally bitter. Medium-bodied, slightly syrupy on the palate."
"Mmmm-mmmm good."
"A nice, non-offensive amber. Easy to drink and smooth as can be."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable, good session"
"d-The taste balance makes it pretty drinkable, a good thrist quencher. Nice to know that there is more in the fridge."
"This brew pours a clear pale amber color with a small white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is the usual generic lager aroma. Sweet and crisp. The taste is more than I expected from my impressions of the aroma. It is clean, crisp, and mildly sweet...nothing spectacular. The mouthfeel is light bodied with too much carbonation. Overall, this is not a beer that I plan on drinking again. It is by no means a horrid brew, but there are better ones out there."
"Solid amber here. Bright amber color with a smaller off white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma was of caramel malts and floral and spicy hops. Taste was quite different though as a dry grain body seemed to really dominate. Sweetness was low and hoppiness was low too. Slick, smooth body, almost too much. Drawn out finish of spicy hops and grain astringency. Nice beer, easy to drink but not the best I have ever had."
"Pours amber with 2 fingers of foamy head, very slight retention and lacing. Looks normal enough. Smells are pretty standard, some hops in there, but no skunk. Taste was not expected from the normalcy of its look and smell. Very smooth, somewhat hoppy but not gross, not skunky at all, malts round out the finish. Very good drinkability, especially out of a can."
"This is actually better than I remember, but last time I was drinking it side-by-side with Lakefront's Riverwest Stein, which is quite good, so Wisconsin Amber ended up looking like the ugly stepsister. It's actually a solid lager, a good session beer, and, from what I hear, a popular BMC substitute--as it should be."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness date. Hazed copper body, head is never very much, just a little wisp on the top of the beer. Smell is very nice, sweet carmel malts, floral hops, which are both also reflected in the flavor. Swet and malty, bready, but the hop finish is above average for the style. Could use more carbonation, but still a good beer."
"On tap at Heaven on 7. Pours a nice golden-orange with one finger of foam. Sweet, highly malty aroma. Tasty, extra sweet slam of caramel maltiness. Slightly fruity as well. Minimal hop bitterness, oh well. Highly drinkable, this made for a quality session beer. Could have used a bit more bitterness, but it was a tasty lager in its own right."
"Opinion: This seems like it was a lot nicer beer in it's prime, but since it is such a light-flavored beer, it is showing the first signs of age. It tastes clean enough that I would keep an eye out for it to try again sometime...especially in Wisconsin."
"Sampled at Grant's Olde Stage Station in Egg Harbor, Wisconsin. Pours a deep copper, not quite amber as name would suggest. Topped with a full creamy white head with lace on glass. Nose is of malty sweetness. Flavor follows the malt lead and is big and sweet, overly cloyingly sweet. Finish is long and balances the beer out."
"Per CB website: Loosely based on Vienna style, Wisconsin Amber is a rich, malty lager balanced out with mild hop bittering and enticing hop flavor. Very fulfilling. Very drinkable."
"I'm not usually a big fan of Ambers, probably because there's a large variety of popular bad ones out there. This may be one of my favorites however (up there with Bell's). It looks meaty in the glass compared to more typical ambers; a good start. ""Malted caramel"" seems to be mentioned a lot in these reviews, and I certainly agree that is the overall defining characteristic of this tastey brew. A few intangibles don't seem quite perfect about this overall, but it's still high on my list of dependable ambers. Capital does a great job with so many beers, and this is one of them."
"The taste is very refreshing - a nice blend of hops, bready grains and sweet alcohol. It really cleans the palette."
"12 oz screw-top bottle obtained from Johns Grocery (Iowa City) in January 2005 and consumed the next evening. Pours almost no headjust a ring around the glass. Crystal clear light copper-orange. Smells of caramel and woody hop. Tastes sweet wet with caramel pear and just a hint of chocolate. Some hop bitter Im not familiar with, but which I will describe as dry and woody. There is fizz on my tongue and the caramel hangs on the roof of my mouth, persisting deep into the aftertaste. The flavors are quite mild, but then, the beer is quite cold. Medium-light body and carbonated well for the style."
"Overall, this is a darn good beer, very sessionable, and a darn good choice for conversion purposes. (It even comes in cans!)"
"I'd take one any time."
"Amber to orange in color with a nice head whitish head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with light flowery hops. Clean and sweet in flavor and it finishes very smooth. This beer is refreshing and goes down really easy. This is a good crossover beer for anybody new to craft brews."
"Nicely put together somewhat complex amber."
"With an average smooth as glass finish, and slight oily feel which disappeared quickly I could have it again if offered but I won't hunt it down anytime soon."
"Nice One Huge!!"
"I liked it a little bit more this time around. The orange didn't seem as sharp and this beer has a wonderful body - medium at least maybe bigger and incredibly smooth. Also, I don't know what it looked like before (I gave it a low score) but it is a brilliant dark orange in color with a gorgeous off-white head. I raised the overall score from 3.1 to 3.7, an unusually large increase for a re-review in my book."
"Pretty blah and average lager. The head was virtually absent and the color was pretty flat looking. The aroma wasn't too bad with wheat, grass and malt hints. The taste was pretty dry and uneventful with a sugary finish. Not the greatest brew from capital, but then again, not too many lagers blow me away."
"This brew poured a medium sized head of fine to large sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a fair lacing and a transparent carbonated light brown colored body. The aroma is a medium strength malt hop one with a smooth mouthfeel and a slight hop bite in the finish. The flavors in this brew contain elements of malt caramel and mild hops. A good beer."
"A pleasing little malty brew. Nice beery aroma when you crack the bottle. Pours like most bottled beer, with an even head that fades to a nice little lace. A roasty malt taste brings notes of caramel or molasses. Hops flavor very mild. Again, a fine representative of the style, and I hope Capital will sometime take the chance to do something a little more extreme."
"Even though my opinion of this beer is that it could use some character to it, it was indeed a good beer to drink and rate. It poured a small sized ivory creamy and smooth head. The body was carbonated and clear with an amber hue. The nose was malty, fruity and some caramel notes. The flavor was sweet along with a bitter taste. The mouthfeel was smooth, tingly, thin textured, watery and light bodied. It left a good lacing on the sides of my glass."
"Quite a nice blend of malt sweetness and hop bite. The hops were more up front as it was still cold, but as it warmed, the malts kicked in and balanced this one nicely indeed! So smooth and velvety on the tongue, it just got better as it went on. Perfect carbonation level, and quaffability is way up there. Find this and enjoy it! Recommended."
"This one is a amber colored liquid with about a half inch tan cream colored head on the top. The aroma is a malty caramel scent. As for the taste, it is a smooth malty taste with a nice hop bite. Citrusy flavors come out as well. This is a well balanced beer, and one that i will be getting again."
"Drinkability: This is a solid brew that would make a great session brew. It's also good for converting people to better beer."
"Pours amber in color with a good to medium head. Starts with a fruity, spicy flavor. But ends with an acidic burnt feel. At first this change in taste is desirable, but the acidic feel lingers on the back of the tongue and mouth. This lingering results in an overall disappointment in the beer."
"Amber-orange color with a tan head. Leaves good lace-work. The aroma is of caramel malts and dark fruits. Very clean smell. The flavor up front is caramel malts which then flows to a spicy, peppery than fruity hop flavor. The bitterness is at a medium level in the finish. This is a well-balanced brew; very smooth and easy drinking. Another great beer from Capital."
"Impressive."
"This is what I would expect out of an amber, solid red color with a battle between earthy hops and caramel malt on the nose. I'll call it a draw with the rematch in the flavor circle. Again it's solid toasted,caramel malts and erthy hop flavors duking out into extra rounds with no clear winner except maybe me, the drinker. It boasts a medium/light body and a crisp toasty finish. This one could keep you busy for a while. Just get the golf courses to carry this and I'm set."
"Taste sweet caramel upfront, with mild hops, biscuity yeast, and some mild fruit that is nice on the pallette. Medium-light body and light carbonation. Very clean and crisp body and finish. Very easy drinking."
"My favorite Capital so far. An absolutley clear bronze body capped by a huge gold-hued tan head that managed to stick around awhile and create some nice lacing. A full nose that gives off both caramel malt and hops aromas. The flavors are very nicely blended between the malty grain and the nicely integrated citrus-flavored hops. A very nice medium body feel that is smooth and has a crisp finish. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Slightly overly long aftertaste. A very nice representative of my favorite style."
"Overall, a good beer. I'm usually not a fan of amber lagers, but this one is pretty good."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. This is a very tasty beer from a brewery that seems to really have their house in order. One of the better ambers I have had!"
"Lucent bronze hue, off-white head, reached a fingers worth, fair retention, some spotty lace. Sweet malty nose, hints of fruit and caramel inviting. Pleasant palate, biscuity-malt with a whisper of fruit, spice, and bitterness. Very tasty; session brew material. Nice finish, crisp, clean, tasty with malty sweetness, some hops. The thinness and watery aspects of the mouthfeel do hamper this beer. It is drinkable good stuff, solid... worth a try, not worth seeking out."
"Solid offering of an Amber style. Color of an average amber, orangey glow with a nice light frothy head that fizzles to lay around the top. Good smell of malt with a spice lightness of fresh hops. Tastes pretty good, sure had me fooled, I was expecting a watery version but it was pretty solid. Well balanced hop and malt flavors that settle into a teriffic solid pine finish with out being to strong or bitter. Good body, had nice little tingle in the mouth. The malt was pleasing. Very drinkable solid offering."
"A welcoming place to come home to, day after day. Or hour after hour."
"Poured a bright amber in color with a luscious creamy white head. Aroma consisted of malt and a hint of caramel. Nothing else really stood out. Taste is on par for a Vienna-Style lager. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a tangy crispness. Flavors consist of toasted malt, touch of caramel, biscuit and hops. Hop bitterness balances well with the sweetness of the malt. The nose could be a little more interesting on this one."
"Clear medium amber color, head is a reserved 1/4 inch and leaves a few rings on gradual consumption (which is hard, as this is quaffable). Sweet and toasty aromas, cinnamon bread qualities. Light-medium bodied, flavor is very pleasant with a sense of roast to the malts and a trace of apple pie fruitiness. Hops balance well, not big but assert as hops. I've bypassed this one for a while, as Vienna Lagers tend toward middle of the road -- but this is tasty and drinkable and something I wouldn't turn down."
"Glowing amber color, foamy off white head. Sweet malty aroma, nice mild, balanced malt flavor, light on the hops, clean lasting finish, medium-light body, makes a great session brew. One of the better American Vienna style."
"Good representation of a Vienna, although nowhere near as good as Elliot Ness. Nice sweet malty flavor and aftertaste. Fairly full-bodied for an Amber, I would try this one again."
"Dark amber / copper hue w/ well lagered clarity.  Off white, head settles into a thin, dense layer that manages loose lace.  Lightly toasted Vienna malt, mild caramel, smooth graininess and an herbal Hallertauer hop nose.  Refined, somewhat understated aromawise.  Mild hop bitterness upfront yields to biscuit notes and light nuttiness.  Sweetness is of a light caramel malt nature and couples with the biscuit notes to form a pleasant mild toffee undertone.  Subdued herbal hop flavor.  Lightly bodied, but with sufficient dextrins to prevent overall weakness.  Finishes, dry, clean, and perhaps a touch bland.  Wisconsin Amber is a well balanced, very drinkable, but somewhat uninspired example of style. An enjoyable brew nonetheless that I could enjoy several of, though it would leave me craving ale fruitiness."
"This is an excellent Vienna...not quite in Elliot Ness territory but close...it is an extremely clean looking dark gold in color...it pours a frothy white head....nice malty biscuit aroma...the mouthfeel is outstanding...a great balance...you get virtually no hops on the nose but they are definitely present on the palate....german style flavor of hops...very thirst quenching...some nice toastiness on the buds..an excellent beer..."
"This brew has a nice light copper color and good off-white head.  The aromas are very biscuity and roasty.  The predominant flavors are sweet and roasted malt with a stale hop aftertaste.  The stale aftertaste overshadows the rest of the brew.  Quite disappointing."
"It poured a medium copper color and formed a nice, white bubbly head.  Left little lace.  An aroma of hops and citrus.  It had a flavor of hops and malt with some citrus.  It had a slightly hoppy finish.  Not a bad beer."
"Aroma predominantly malty with mild hop backing.  Medium sized head that dissapates rather quickly.  Clear with an orange-amber color.  Nice soft malt beginning that builds in complexity to the mild dry hop finish.  Some lingering of the hops.  Mouthfeel is good with a little creaminess and noticable carbonation.  This is fine for style, but I prefer others better."
"A very good amber.  Excellent malt presence with a lighter than expected finish.  I can see this being a session brew for folks in Wisconsin while watching Badger football games.  Reminded me of a lighter version of New Belgium's Fat Tire."
"Pours a perfectly clear amber with a decent white sticky head that has good retention.  A really nice deep sweet maltiness on the nose.  Very nice toasted quality.   A nice clean caramel malt presence.  Very little hop presence.  Medium body and very drinkable.   Definitely one of my favorite Amber Lagers.  Another great lager from Capital."
