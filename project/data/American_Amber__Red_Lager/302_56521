3.5,1.2,3,3,4,3,3.5,"Other: Very temperature sensitive. Had one that was just a bit too cold and it totally killed the flavor and aromas. The beer was very disappointing, the malt goes away and because there hops and other flavors are fairly mild, you're not left with much. Had a second a bit warmer (in the 50-55 degree range) and it was a night and day difference. It went form "boy, do I have to drink this whole thing" to "hey this is pretty tasty"","keethrax","Apr 30, 2011"

3.73,7.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Amber in body with big white foamy head that leaves lacing. Aroma of cereal, big malt sweetness, nutty, hazelnut comes to mind. Tastes is big on cereal grains, nuts, slight hop spice, echoes of apple skins, toasted bread, clean finish with just a lingering sweetness. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A session with a malt focus.","JRed","Apr 20, 2011"

3.63,4.9,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Pours more of an golden-orange color than a red. An off-white ring is there. Smell is mainly mineral, as well as some earthy malts. At first taste, I'm surprised how roasty and almost peaty one of the malts is - it's very nice. An overriding smoothness follows an almost smoky finish, yet still a bit bitter. Probably the most complex brew I've yet tried from Dundee, and I liked it.","sixerofelixir","Mar 24, 2011"
3.31,-4.3,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Dundee Irish Red Lager is a very clear amber beer. The thin, foamy, off white head thins to a film and leaves nice lacing. It has an aroma of funky Genesee yeast and some sweet caramel. It's pretty light bodied and a little watery with a slightly gritty finish. It tastes a little sweet and a little salty. It reminds me of Genny Bock. There's a touch of chocolate and a little toastiness, maybe nuttiness. There's a tiny hint of herbal bitterness at the finish. Is this Genny Bock?","yesyouam","Mar 08, 2011"
3.28,-5.2,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall: although not an expert opinion, if I had to choose between this and something like Yuengling's traditional lager, I would choose this beer. Yuengling's standard lager is definitely drinkable, but so is this. As well I feel 'Dundee Irish Red Lager' has a more full taste than the former.","Meisterlol","Mar 05, 2011"
3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a brilliant reddish-coffee and has similar aromas of light roast coffee, caramel and baked apricot. The palate is hugely malty and juicy with a tart presentation and a balancing but never overpowering hoppiness. More notes of espresso and papaya lead to the mouthwatering finish.","TheWhiskerReview","Mar 02, 2011"
2.28,-34.1,3,2.5,2,3,2,"this taste clean and fresh but unlike honey brown witch backs it up with it name and taste, this beer doesnt bring anything to the table , doesnt even look red, has no taste , skip it waste of time. but it cheap and if your a poor white boy looking to waste your money then buy this beer why is it call irish that an insult","wac9","Mar 02, 2011"
3.14,-9.2,4,2.5,3,4,3.5,"D- There's really nothing offensive about this beer, it's just not doing it for me. I could down several of these and they would go with just about anything, it's a nice, mild beer.","Franz4","Beers"
3.85,11.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: To be honest, I find Dundee gives a banal treatment to their range of brews, but I genuinely enjoyed this one and it's the only I'd consider purchasing again (don't hold me to it, though). Maybe I'm just getting soft and sweet in my old age.","ChainGangGuy","0"
3.92,13.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D - Bought this on a whim since it was only 2 dollars for the single and it was well worth the try. Kind of wish I had this in a variety pack with the winter and the honey brown. I would buy it since it would be under 30 for the variety.","DrDemento456","Oct 07, 2010"
3.65,5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: would drink a few of these and would be really good at a cookout, would go good with a smokey grilled taste.","nukem5","Aug 28, 2010"
3.42,-1.2,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Served chilled in a Sam Adams Lager class; decent foam; color was more of an amber than a red, but adequate. Although the label said something about extra malt, this reminded me of a watered-down version of Ale Asylum's Hopalicious. This would probably be a good beer to consume in quantities and with food, as it would neither fill you up nor fight the taste of foods...I still have one bottle left, which I will have to try with a meal.","dhannes","Jul 28, 2010"
3.9,12.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"As far as red lagers go, it finishes just a touch heavy, but I'd still recommend it over the macro-brewed attempt made by the Coors Empire, "Killian's Irish Red." At least Dundee's take on Irish Lager has some staying power, and for than, I commend them.","Lauthaha","Jul 18, 2010"
3.45,-0.3,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and caramel scent along with a dry yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a bone dry pale and crystal malt flavor. It has a mild caramel character as well as a pretty good hop component. It goes down smooth with some metallic off-flavors. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average red ale. I'm not exactly lovin' the taste. It's a little too dry for me.","WesWes","Jun 11, 2010"
3.1,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Dundee/Genesee beer ranges from slightly below average to slightly above average. Irish Red Lager is on the low end of that range and isn't something that I care to drink again. Even as a starter IRA, there are better options than this.","BuckeyeNation","May 03, 2010"
3.25,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"D - Not a bad offering from Dundee, it could use a little work but it's on the right track to becoming a good Irish red. I do like the cleanliness of the beer though. A bit harsh on the finish for a lager.","BeerFMAndy","Apr 04, 2010"
2.86,-17.3,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours with a thicket of light khaki tan head forms a nice doughnut shaped cloud of foam, scattered thin strips of lacing appear with each sip. Body is a nice amber red hue crystal clea definitely filtered. Label talks about painting sheep red as they do in Ireland, these Dundee brews crack me up. Aroma light toasted malt character mid nuttiness going on witha touch of caramel in the finish but really it's very light. Flavor is semi sweet mildly roasted malt character a bit of sour dough bread with light herbal malts. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation is ample not overdone body is just uninteresting. Drinkability overall is pretty weak due to the fact that the flavor good be much better and it's just not drinking as smooth as an Irish Red should. Do you remember Michael Shea's Irish Lager they used to brew, this is pretty close to that.","WVbeergeek","Apr 03, 2010"
