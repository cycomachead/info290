"Smooth, malty, wondrous drinkable session beer. Brilliant!"

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable with enough flavor + aroma that I could easily have a couple of these during a single afternoon. Alcohol is well hidden."

"Overall - A good beer, just not a real good one, and certainly not a ""session"" beer despite the product line. This is a pretty heavy feeling lager, and weighs a bit more than your average amber @ 6.2% ABV (the booze is detectable but actually pleasant). Good tasting, but could use more carbonation and a heavier hopping hand for more balance and bite: needs a body tweak for improved crispness. C'mon Full Sail, I know you could do this better!"

"First time having anything by full sail, but what caught my eye was the red lager on the bottle.  Poured into a glass almost no head despite being fairly carbonated. A dark amber you'd expect from an ale. Smelled sweet, first pull was different and not off putting . Enjoyed the carbonation and the body which was a little distracted by the tingling of the carb. Almost a light brown sugar after taste and almost no hop notes at all. Considering the high abv for a brew lager this is pretty great.  Sorry for the lack of descriptive language lost my sense if smell due to being sick, just now slowly getting it back.  Will  get again once full senses come back (olfactory). Would recommend if your wanting something different to enjoy. No risks here"

"First beer I can remember in the now popular ""session IPA"" mold. Fest does a great job of keeping a great flavor on a thin bodied, highly drinkable beer. Pours a surprisingly dark amber with a soupy head. Smell is floral, taste is a non bitter hoppyness with notes of butterscotch. Mouthfeel is smooth and buttery. Overall I great drinker and one to look forward to in the winter."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and I would have no problem knocking back of few of these in succession."
""
"O: nice red lager, full of flavor"
""
""
"O: A dark Lager, or mid-dark Czech style. Very original, very good, very good food beer. Must try, but a bit too sweet for me to make it a regular, or a, well, a session. I think it's a winter seasonal."
""
""
""
"O: At 6.2% abv, this is not a session beer in the British sense of the word, but true to the Session brand, it is very quaffable. No flaws and no frills, this is just an easy lager to put down and a fun beer to drink overall."
""

"Overall not my cup of tea too metallic and forgettable. Pass"
"Overall an OK beer, but not a favorite."

"Didn't know what to expect from this red lager but it reminds me of a Marzen. Good, pleasant beer that if offered I would accept . Not something I would aggressively seek out but a worthy choice."

"This is really, really nice. Easily the best lager I've had from the Western United States. It's like an Oktoberfest-light. The smooth malt and medium bitterness are balanced wonderfully (not as well as a Wisconsin lager, but this is not to discredit this brew), with a slight spiciness to it."

"Session beers provide a tasty, highly sessionable beer with a fairly low price point. Of course, their bottles are only 11oz. so you're not getting any particular bargain over a pack of Sam Adams or Sierra Nevada, but their lagers provice a more basic taste tailored for sessions. Our local store had 12 packs of these marked down to $6. Can't help but pick one up. This one is a little more robust than the classic or black lagers. Hops + carbonation have quite a bite. It's a good, if unremarkable taste. To me, it's not quite as sessionable as the others, but it's worth a shot, especially if you get it at the price I did. It'll go well with a lot of food too."
""
"Overall, a tasty amber lager and one that, as the name would suggest, is quite sessionable. One to pick up if you see it around."
"A well done red lager. Enjoyable flavor profile and easy drinking."
""
"Medium to full body. Very nice. Only complaint is the bottle of 11 ounces."
""
"Hugely drinkable rich lager. A cut way above so many over hopped Reds and over-strong winter brews. I am never disappointed by the numerous brews in the lager style that Full Sail is making. From the 11 oz bottle bought at the Utah Liquor Store in Sugar House."
"An excellent red lager."
"Overall: Nothing to extraordinary here. The bottle is fun, but is missing an ounce."
""
""
"O: not a huge fan of lagers but this is pretty good. A tad sweet for me but not cloying. All in all it is a good beer. I enjoy red ales and this stands pretty well as a red lager in my book."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""

"Very nice understated beer--which surprised me by its lack of spices, alcohol or other typical ""Christmas-beer"" elements. Smooth, super high quality, and I would bet, just what Czech ""Polotmavé"" (light/dark) beer is supposed to be--wonderful quality beer to share with friends. ANY beer drinker can enjoy this--though hop-heads will be discontent that it doesn't slap them in the throat--oh well, let them settle down. As I wrote above though--terrific that America's most serious brewers are finally paying attention to do first quality renditions of the Continent's most serious beers (instead of just following English or 20-something American tastes)."
"Sweet malts up front, toasted nuts, caramel, bright fruit, herbal hop finish. Body is medium, crisp, slight dry aftertaste, well carbonated."
""

"I like Session's Dark as much as this, Full Sail did a great job in this year's batch. I would reccomend this."
""
""

"The body was smooth and even, but a slightly sticky finish was a bit off-putting. Drinkability was very nice, I could easily knock back a few of these. Overall, I think this is my favorite of the Sessions brews (although I do like the Black fairly well). A nice brew that's worth a shot when you see it."
"This is a fairly good amber ale. The carbonation seems a bit too high, in my opinion. Kind of too frothy in the mouth. But the flavor tone is nice enough. Seems to be some spices on there (maybe it's just the mix of malts and hops?), but it's too muddled for me to be able to pick something out precisely. Either way, a pleasant enough ale."
"Medium bodied with a decent balance of sweet malt and earthy hop notes. Hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut followed by grassy, spilt hops. There's also a lactic diaceytl presence which is off-putting and slightly sour. Just really odd tasting."
""
""
"Overall a nice addition to the session lineup. Not as dramatic as the Session black but still pleasant. Great deal when a 12pack was 8bucks."
"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, once you get to the taste. But it seems to evade one a bit."
""
"O - I enjoyed this. Once again, Full Sail does a good job of giving you session beers that are drinkable but not boring."
"O: Very drinkable. Malty, good feel and balance."
"Not sure yet if I'll repeat this next holiday season. The other Session brethren knocked it out of the park in my opinion, but this one fell a little short of the high standard set."
""
""
"Strong, crisp aroma is mainly malty and has quite a bite to it. I got a mild skunky whiff, but that hardly put me off. It pours a nice clear, dark coppery amber with a thick and fluffy pale tan head that sticks around for a while. Flavor is fairly typical for a lager, except fairly strong and with nary a trace of the skunkiness I detected in the aroma. Maybe I was smelling things? ;) It does have a hoppy, somewhat bitter tone with a hint of something nasty, but it is still decidedly drinkable. Texture has average body and average fizziness. Overall, not great but worth a try. Maybe this sample was from not their best batch."
"I've had this stubby bottle in my fridge for a while, and I have been meaning to drink since Xmas 2011. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark amber body. Not much head, and no lacing. Not very impressive to look at. Smell had faint hints of holiday spices. Taste was only slightly above average. Some orange peel, ginger, toasted malt, and cherry. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin, and slightly bitter at the end. The abv of over 6% was not really noticeable. I wouldn't consider this a session beer, as I wouldn't see myself drinking multiple bottles of this."
""
"O: Very drinkable brew with pretty good ABV.... with looking for and a like the bottle says... Session Fest."
"Overall, I didn't really care for it. Some off notes and I don't care for toasted ambers like Fat Tire."
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby eleven-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression - an easy drinking beer with no shortage of pleasant subtleties."
"Otherwise, this gets the proverbial job done. If you're looking to put a few back, maybe tie one on with decent craft beer, this'll certainly suffice. It's not packed with a lot of flavor or a complex bouquet, but as I said, it'll do the job it's been tasked to do."
""
"Medium bodied with above medium semi-sharp carbonation. A refreshing mouthfeel and very drinkable. This is one of those beers that you will probably drink faster than you should given the 6.2% ABV. But hey, it's the holidays."
""
"Overall - another good offering from session"
"Overall: Remarkably drinkable."
"Overall: This is another beer from Full Sail that I have enjoyed in the past week. Will have to upgrade my selection and try some of their other stuff in the near future."
"I can see knocking back a few over a period of time. Another fine addition to Full Sail's Session beer family."

"O - Hmm, well there ain't much to this brew. It's an affordable/sessionable Lager that would probably go great with some pulled pork sandwiches. I liked the flavor profile, and it smelled clean and inviting to me. Overall though I thought this beer was just alright. I'd probably buy it again because it tastes good and it's on the cheaper side."
"Light, but not too light, low-medium carbonation. An alright beer at best."
""
"Poured from the Session pill-bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is an almost crystal-clear, brown-copper coloring with a slow, steady flow of bubbling and a filmy coating of head. Aromas are rich and malty, with a sweet caramel tang to the normal roasted cereal scents of a lager. Flavors are nutty and spicy, with a caramel backbone and a slight hopping at the end to clean everything from the palate. Tasty brew on a round, smooth, yet crisp body. The aftertaste is a bit resiny and bitter, with a roasted character. The finish dries nicely, leaving the palate clear for more. Very easy brew to drink, and the flavors are spiced and smooth enough to make a very sessionable holiday ale."
"This pours a burnt sienna color. Malty molasses aromas, lightly hopped. Light, bitter, but not really all that enjoyable. Thin finish. The malt profile is out of alignment. It doesn’t hold up to warming—the spices/flavoring goes out of balance and comes off harshly. At least the stubby bottle is cute."
"Pours a clear brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Chunky rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt/grains, bread/biscuit, and some caramel notes. Taste is of toasted malt, bread, caramel, and some spicy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good red lager and a good alternative to spiced Winter beers. This is probably my favorite Session beer from Full Sail to date."
"Dark copper-red, nearly a tawny brown. Thin, short-lasting bubbles show head retention just a tad more impressive than a soft drink. Polotmavé - never had, nor heard of the style. I'm guessing amber lager is a good enough descriptor. Some caramel, baking bread, and shortbread balance out a pleasant grassy and earthy hoppiness. Nicely brewed and clean, dryness is appreciated since this was meant to be an easy drinker. Surprisingly, Full Sail managed to capture some holiday elements in this seemingly basic red lager. It's nice to see a brewery go outside of the winter warmer/stout box for a winter seasonal. This definitely a beer that would please both craft drinkers and generic beer guzzlers alike. I think a box of 12 bottles will be making the trip to Thanksgiving dinner with me this year."
"Dark copper/amber. Not much for head but a good amount of foam clings around the sides of the glass. Every time I sip some more forms on the sides. Light German malty sweetness. Some hop spice as well. Biscuity malt flavor and just like the nose it finishes with some hoppy spice. Thinner side of a body but still a decent malt character."
""

"Of the three Session beers, this is my least favorite. It has a certain generic quality to it that left me a bit flat. However, it is a decent beer. It's just not for me."
""
"(Seriously, all I want is to see the Cowboys lose. I don't care to who. Is that too much to ask?)"
"This is just like the other FS Session beers; nothing spectacular, just clean, good drinking beers. And at a great price too."
"Solid beer. Not much to look at with its pale amberness and lack-o-foamy-head. Smells like malt liquor with a spicy cinnamon poke in the sniffer. Smells like flowers too. Tastes tingly and bock-like: surely a dichotomy. Mouth feel belies the light color.... a bit. Weightier than expected, but by no means a tongue carpet. I picked up a single in this instance, but I'll get the 12er next time."
"Appearance is a dark copper amber having a stable head and nice lace. Smell is light thats a little grainy, roasted malt and hops. taste of grainy roasted malt with a bitter hop lasting through the aftertaste. Can't taste much of the alchohol either. Mouthfeel is medium with a good spike of carbonation. No wow factor hear, but not to bad for a red."
" Bravo Full Sail!"
"The appearance turned out to be pretty good. The lacing was pretty patchy, but it followed me pretty much all the way down the glass. The body was kinda ugly, but that was only because of the colors. The head was...eh, not great. I'm kinda confused on how to grade this beer for appearance, maybe it deserves a 4 for the good lacing, but I'm pretty sure it's well short due to everything else."
"Overall, not a bad easy drinking beer. Flavors don't exactly 'wow' you with anything but it's still got enough going on to keep things interesting."
"I feel like this is what Fat Tire could be if it were a lager and a bit more robust. It's a well made beer and I like it, I just wish you really could call it a session lager. Recommended..."
"Tasty and straight forward offering. More dark bread notes, malty sweetness, a pinch of all spice, a rye note and light dryness in the finish. Ehh....decent litle sessioner...but doesnt really do much for me."
"O: I will definitely buy this again. Yet another very drinkable and enjoyable lager from Full Sail."
"A pretty kick ass edition to the Session line-up, I was a fan to begin with but to have an option even if it is seasonal is great. Bring on the lagers!!"
"Overall impression: Another drinkable offering in the Session line .. this is not the most exciting beer out there, but it's a solid amber that I wouldn't mind having a few of."
"O: A pretty good amber, nothing too complex. Paired well with a almond butter sandwich."
"M - Slight carbonation. Enjoyable to drink. Clean and smooth. Just as a lager should be."
"Thanks to elrogish & Quinn for breaking these bad boys out during our cabin barleywine trip. Solid beer."
"Overall a very nice and balanced beer, very drinkable and flavorful. I'd expect a good solid beer from Full Sail and they delivered."
"Overall: Now, that's a beer I've not had in a long time... a long time. Maybe it's just me, but this one reminds me of the first installment to the LTD series."
"The flavour was great. Slightly hoppy and nutty...a really unique characteristic. The higher than normal alcohol was noticeable, but enjoyable. This is probably up there as one of my favorite fest beers and I would buy this again."
"Pours a nice reddish brown with a frothy off white head that sticks around. Smell is mostly malt with some yeast and subtle spice notes. The taste starts with the malt and moves into the yeast, and has a nice subtle spice finish. The aftertaste has some of the malty notes with a subtle sweetness. A nice medium mouthfeel adds the the depth of the beer, giving a thicker style. Nice carbonation and an easy drinker. These session beers are solid beers, all with subtle nuances and great flavor. Nothing huge and over the top but done right."
"11 oz stubby from a 12 pack. Winco, S.Salem. $9.98 Dark red amber colured ale with a goodly sized, frothy off white head. Fine malty,hay,bready aromas slight hint of lemony hop Malty taste..hint of chocolate and spices..not sure were i get it from but there is a definate peppery spiceiness. OK on the palate..has a rather evident alcohol graininess right at the end..but its not that bad. Nice beer at a good price. Another fine ""Session"" offering"
"Not bad."
"i have only had a couple so i might change my tune, but this winter could be one of cases of Celebration and 12s of this... great beer."
"Overall, you can't go wrong with this beer. I think it's a great beer to have at parties. I love the bottles and they're so easy to put in the coolers to lug around."
"this sessions' is awesome, totally dig it. nice mix of a german strong lager, and a dry irish red ale. this is new, interesting, affordable, and best of all tastes really good. well done i'd say... thanks full sail, i'm starting to like your session series more than your regular one."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"A nice lager. I am a big fan of the other Full Sail ""sessions"" and this one is enjoyable. Though I think I like the other better. Still, no worries with putting these back. A very nice everyday drinker."
"- It's a solid drinker. A sessionable beer? Perhaps for the cool holiday's yes, but I can see this recipe as more of a marketing ploy. If it were bottled in 6-packs and sold for more, I doubt it would do as well as it is as a new session series. The flavor is very good, but the rest falls short. I am more keen to the likes of their latest imperial IPA, because that beer didn't taste like the rest of theirs. This one does."
"Would drink again. In fact I've had several already. But only won once at paper rock scissors."
