"Definitely on the sweeter side but not necessarily a bad thing. Malt aftertaste"
""
"This one is not for me"
"So overall would I recommend it? No, for a brown beer there is much better. I was a bit disappointing. I wish the beer would have more flavour but overall is it not a bad beer at all, it goes down dry smoothly but if you wanna drink a Sleeman get something else."

"A staple of mine in my younger days. Delivers on its namesake color and has a solid 4 finger head to show for itself. Nutty flavor with some sweet caramel. Decent and good though tame to be sure."

"341 ml bottle. Nice colour. Smooth. I liked it better after it warmed up a little."

"O: The one thing that's really off on this beer is the mouthfeel. Other than that, it's much better than I expected."

"I should probably credit Sleeman for helping me to graduate beyond Molson Pilsener, Saskatchewan boy elixir of choice, to a much wider world of beer styles and legit quality-focused breweries, but a) that doesn't mean one can't turn an ""objective"" eye towards these Canadian standbys now and b) do not presume that Sleeman is necessarily one of the latter breweries. Sleeman was a transitional step. I likely consumed a disturbing number of honey browns and cream ales during my grad school days, so this trip back into Sleemanland, Onterrible was tinged with some nostalgia. Oddly enough I used to think this was an ale despite the term ""lager"" being right there in the name ... I suppose the goal of drinking back then wasn't to pay close attention. Also, Woody's Tap House only has so many wares to sample. It was this or something from a clear glass bottle that rhymes with ""Borona"". In any event, Sleeman honey brown on tap is a very light burnished bronze color, looks quite watered-down, with traces of white foam skittering on the surface. Aroma is sweet boiled grains, ephemeral brown sugar or caramel, lemon rind, a sourish apple fruitiness, and perhaps a hemp seed nuttiness. Palate is a blend of different malt and hops-generated effects, I get sweet white bread, sour vines candy, play dough, dilute citrus iced tea, and interestingly enough some cooking molasses. More dark malt character than expected! Nice! Less optimistically, however, the whole watery package is flavor-anemic, everything interesting is ramped down in favor of enough gas and bubbles to launch a hot air balloon. Crisp and dry finish does include a pleasant hay-like sweetness. Not fantastic but there was enough interest here to make me masochistically wonder what the cream ale would taste like now ... Stay tuned!"

"An all-around weak flavoured ale, smells about as bad as it tastes"
""
""
""

"This poured a clear, dark amber colour finishing with a nice foamy two-finger head which lasted throughout with fairly good lacing. The aroma is mostly that of honey and grainy malts. This is a sweet beer with a faint hint of hop bitterness and a medium level of body."
""
""
""

"O- If you seek a very well rounded session beer that pleases the palate, don't hesitate; pick this one up and chances are you won't be disappointed."

"it's an average beer, but this is a tasty one."
"S- Ganja"
" The taste has a bready character with light honey sweetness up front and mild yeast in the taste with perhaps a slight diacetyl smoothness and caramel in the malt as it finishes with some grain and honey flavor but generally mild as far as overall taste goes. This is a pretty standard take with decent taste, yet not exceptional -just a ordinary vienna/red/amber lager easy to enjoy and smooth"

"Had this on a recent business trip to the Cambridge Ontario area. Really pretty good beer that goes well with most any food. Paired this time with schnitzel and braised cabbage."

"This beer looks and smells really great with a caramel honey brown bred smell. It is good. It is not amazing but really good in winter because I don't like it in summer. The mouthfeel isn't amazing but it isn't bad too. Overall it is ok but I don't like it that much too. In fact it is a very little over average but if you can't find it don't go crazy."
""
"over all: simply awesome, doesn't taste like lager (better). I usually drink micro brewery beers, but this one is fine by me and my wife. This is a must try if your in Canada."
"This is a joke. This beer is not worth buying, thankfully I was given it. I guess the color is alright, ruby and golden, but the head is nonexistent. Smells like bad cream soda left out in the sun that someone poured bud light into. Taste is watery, way to sweet, and then at the end there's a little taste of malt and hops that give you a slight clue that what you're drinking is supposed to be beer. Don't buy this, please."
""
""
"The liquid appears light brown, maybe a few shades tanner than that, the build looks light and the bubbles are big and off white with a semi tan look, dies down no lace. Smell is caramel forward and sweet smelling with some grainy background. Taste is grain up front with caramel backing with what I would call sweetners, that's all I really get. Feel is a step up from other sleeman beers and matches the style, a light crisp carb but smooth beer none the less. Drinkability is low because, well, it's pretty one sided."

"Overall, a pretty solid beer, not one I search for but often is the best thing on tap in a sea of molson/labatt."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas."

"In summary, unless you like overly sweet, overly carbonated honey lagers, avoid this."
"O - for a run of the mill mass consumption brand its decent, but a pretty average honey brown all told"
"Yeah, I love it. When I was younger the first beer I drank was probably Coors, and I was not impressed. SHB was the first beer I had that I thought was actually interesting, and I still have a soft spot for it. It's not boring but it's not pretentious either."
"O- A pretty bland and watery lager with an undesirable mouthfeel."
"T: It's drinkable, but I don't know it's something I would want to drink a ton of. Smooth malts and some honey on the finish. You're probably better trying something else."
"Final Grade: 3.05, a C+."
"Overall, it is quite drinkable due to a relatively low ABV, but there are much better beers out there to drink."
"O- I remember a time when this was among my favorite brews, but now it just doesn't hold that same pizzaz! I've moved on I guess to bigger and better beer...still, it was interesting to have one of these again and though I'd still drink this, it's not what I remember...I know I've had this on tap from time to time and think it's much better in that form....maybe that's what's wrong here! This is a good one for those who are just breaking into beer or new styles for that matter, but trust me, there are much better takes on this style."
"O: Not exactly a great beer, but certainly not an F like the Bros. say!"
"O: Either my palate has changed a lot or this is way better on tap. I don't remember this beer ever being so bland. Atleast it tastes better then any adjunct lager."
"Very easy to drink, and better than many other beers at the same price point. Not crazy, but I would rather this than a lot of other macro lagers."
"Drinkability. Pretty sweet without offering much else. Not a great drinker, but would pick over most mainstream lagers."
"Overall, not a bad dark beer. It is thick with lots of taste to go with it, a bit to sweet at times though. Would recommend over other sleeman beers."
"crisp, light/medium bodied mouthfeel. drink well; a good football-watching beer."
"473ml can. The beer pours a light amber color with with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee without too much else. The flavor is toffee with a light amount of bitterness and flavor from some grassy hops. Still, this is a very malt-forward beer, Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drink - Definitely the best beer in the Sleeman lineup. If there are no better beers available, this is a fairly decent choice. I'd drink it again."
"D- Not a very good beer. Drinkable id it's all there is, but other than that I won't seek it out."
"Was at an event and this was the best beer (Canadian and Coors Light were other choices) so decided to go for it since I haven't had a Sleeman Honey Brown in year or so. Pours an amber brown colour with thin off-white head without much lacing. Smells really sweet, like caramel and honey, without much else. Flavour is pretty muted, just sweetness comes through. No trace of any hops or bitterness. Carbonation is a bit aggressive, but wasn't bad. I had a couple, so drinkability can't be that bad, but I'll never get this unless I'm in a similar situation again."
"Creamy. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK. No major flaws in this nice fresh glass of draught, just not a lot to come back for."
"Not really a high mark, a bit too light for being a Euro Dark Lager."
"D - This one is easily drinkable, non-offensive, but not overly memorable. I would never turn one down, but there's plenty of other offerings within this style which offer more robust flavours."
"The name pretty much sums it up. Honey Brown. Expect a sweeter beer with it's share of malt."
"every no and then I sip a honey brown at a bar that has nothing better up for grabs, sadly this would be most bars here in Calgary"
"A brownish amber color pour with a small foamy offwhite head , short lasting , medium carbonation . Aroma of corn ,peanuts and and a hint of metallic hops . Flavor is lightly bitter with corn lager , nuts and very sweet honey , a bit too sweet for me . medium body, thin mouthfeel, with a short corny finish . Drinkable but not my cup of tea ."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is week and punctuated by the different flavors, all of which you want to choke down as fast as possible. This will be a hard one to get through, thus the low drinkability."
"Gotta love all the tallboys in the Great White North. Picked up a 16 oz at the local LCBO. Poured into a handy glass yields a well, honey brown, imagine that, color. Nice head at first but fades quickly. Taste is sweet as expected. It starts with honey sweetness upfront then moves into a brown sugar-like sweetness matched with very slight bitterness. The finish stays sweet but fades to a tarty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great, good carbonation then even a flavor fizzy finish. This is a very highly drinkable brew. Not sure about the style it is listed as, I don't think it is, but I like it. Goes great with many foods, Korean barbecue to name one.Better a little warmer than cold."
"Sleeman Honey Brown pours a light amber orange with a thing head. There is some sweetness in the aroma as well as some skunkiness. There is a hint of caramel toffee in the flavor and some sweetness, but it finishes dry and muddled. The body is on the heavier side. I would say this could be a slight step above your average macro, if it wasn't a bit skunked."
"Drinkability is OK. Nice beer on a hot day, but not something I'd serve if I wanted to impress. Just average."
"Overall - an average beer"
"It's sad to think that I use to like this stuff. The last time I had it was Thanksgiving and I had to pour it in the grass when no one was looking. Too sweet, awful mouthfeel and extremely overpriced. If you can, stay away, but if not, don't judge Canadian beers based off of this."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, orangey/red body with a thin and watery looking head. Aroma is sweet, and slightly hoppy, with a hint of honey. Taste is a little bit of honey, but could be more. More hops and water than honey to be honest. Smooth and refreshing."
"This is a fairly innocuous beer. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but would not hesitate to have it with dinner."
"Drinkability was pretty good to wash down food or as a session beer. Nothing great but not bad either."
"It's drinkable enough, I guess. I've shared pitchers of the stuff with friends before, and it's not terrible as an accompaniment to pub food. Don't pay too much attention and it goes down the hatch easily."
"It's not a bad beer for a Canadian macro. A bit one dimensional but a pleasant change from the typical blond Lagers."
"For being what it is, a mainstream Canadian mass produced beer, it fits the bill nicely, and it's not all that bad. I'd say worth a try if you've never had it."
"Notes: Skip this one, in the name of better beers with flavor that deserve your time and energy."
"A mediocre macro lager, not much to speak of. Its too sweet to be enjoyable, but it isnt undrinkable."
"Drinkability - not a great session beer due to the sweetness, waxiness, etc. Has some okay flavour but there are several better choices."
"Final Thoughts - Seriously, I just wish I could concentrate this beer slightly more. If the scent was a bit stronger, and the flavor more pronounced it would certainly get a better rating. That being said, I'd gladly pick up more of this stuff or order it at a restaurant with my meal."
"Taste: More sweet and maltiness. I can't really pick out the honey flavor. Little bitterness on the finish."
"A more or less innocuous, everyman example of the 'honey' beer phenomenon in Canada and parts farther removed. It's easy to put back a few of these, sure, but at some point one becomes aware of this particular sort of acquiescence to blandly-made universal offerings."
"Drinkability: Sweetness does become cloying half way through the glass. Not for hopheads, but if you're looking for an easy-drinking malt-focused beer, you could do a lot worse."
"Drinkable beer, good to pair with food when the beer is on tap. Overpriced though, and nothing to brag about."
"Pours a golden amber with a thin white head.Good retention,and a pretty decent lacing. Nose is of honey and malt. Body is medium with some carbonation.Taste is of honey up front with a bitter sweet fruity finish.Decent balance. Worth a try if you get a chance."
"Pretty light-tasting beer. Not very complex like a brown ale or usual dark lager, but I think the honey effect is present and noticeable. Overall, a good beer. If I saw it on a menu, I'd definitely have another."
"Not too bad..."
"D: A sweet toasted lager with slightly above average drinkability."
"Full palate. Inoffensive flavours, finishes sweet with spice. A bit fake. Perhaps a bit of honey. Not overly complex, that is for sure."
"D: Not drinkable. Unbelievably bad. Stay away...you have several thousand other beers that taste better to spend you money on. Don't be a fool like me."
"Overal I thought this OK, honey beers are becoming more common and this one was better than a few I've had the misfortune to try. I will have a few more if there are any left when I revisit the shop."
"Taste is sweet but not unbearably so. A suprisingly tasty well balanced lager. A pretty good hop level for a lager. It would be a good beer for someone who finds the bigger hop styles unpleasant."
"drinkability is good. this is an easy going brew with just enough honey. smooth and mildly complex. decent."
"Very drinkable, smooth with a bit of honey sweetness. Haven't been drinking it as much lately, because of cost. It's above average in my opinion, but lacks a bit of unique character. Sleeman definitely brews better beers than most bigger Canadian companies, but on a student's budget I haven't had the opportunity to try some of its other brews."
"cette bière a belle couleur ambre foncée, mousse blanche passablement fugace. elle possède un nez marqué par le miel, aussi de sucre et de malt, bouche ronde avec un petit coté de miel non pas désagréable. finale courte. pourrait finir par écuré à la longue."
"Medium mouthfeel that goes down not bad but leaves a musty aftertaste behind. Not to my liking."
"A friend went to Canada to visit family and brought me back one of these. I think it was suppose to be a testament to the quality of Canadian beer. The brown slightly bubble body with the weak head didn't impress me much, although I've seen worse. The smell was almost nonexistent, especially for a honey induced brew. The taste of a brown with a slight honey flavor was light but present. Very light, watery mouthfeel. Drinkable, yes. It goes down quite easily, but the lack of flavor and the wateriness would make me think twice and possibly choose something else if pressed to try another."
"Drinkability: Good enough on a hot day and goes great w/ BBQ. I couldn't see myself pounding these down...but good enough to enjoy"
"This beer actually fares better than most Sleeman products. Not that it's a great beer, but it avoids any critical errors that would kill the beer. Opens with a bright copper / oragne hue, highly carbonated, and leaves a decent foamstand with lacing. The aromas release a part-malt, part-grain flavor, that indicated lightness of both. Mild hops ride in the background, along with a light butter scent. Flavors show the balance of grain and malt that the aromas show, albeit light. Light, earthy, metalic hop flavors and bittering hardly offset the grains / sweetness. Feels light and partly scrubbed to the palate, leaving a light diacetyl on the toung. Finishes quite grainly, and lightly grain-astringent. Basically ordinary and un-eventful. I'll be happy to drink a free one in the future, but not likely pay for another."
"Pours a nice nutty brown/caramel color. The off-white head quickly foams up, then disappears. The smell is of honey, and is sweet. The taste is also sweet, with a little spice from the hops. The body is light, with a little carbonation. This is a good beer that is fairly drinkable, but it is nothing special."
"me, but on the other hand it's your good basic session or picnic brew."
"D - This wasn't bad. It just didn't grab me with a lot of flavor. Not the best offering from Sleeman."
"This is great tasting beer. It pours an orangy red colour with a slight head. The aroma is nice and malty with a hint of honey. It works well on the cheeks with mild carbonation (unlike Sleeman Cream Ale which is way too fizzy). The taste is crisp and clear with hints of fruit and honey. Goes down well and tastes great with barbecued ribs."
"Pours a medium copper brown, mostly translucent with a large frothy head. Moderate lacing. Smells pretty sweet, malty, and slightly floral. Taste is good, not much complexity, but the balance between the sweetness, malts, and hops is pretty good to provide a very easy drinker. I downed the first one rather quickly."
"Overall i enjoyed this one and for a honey lager its not too bad. I might pick it up again sometime, i dont think ill be going out of my way to get it though. If offered drink up!"
"D: Easily approachable, but too sweet for me to session."
"I've had this before - it comes in stylin' clear glass bottle with raised images of Canadian paraphanelia - beavers and maple leaves and all that. It didn't really have a head, the color was golden-brown. The smell was faintly like sweet malt but it's very faint. The taste isn't much of anything actually - just light and tasteless. It's not my first Sleeman's choice - I'd probably choose their Cream Ale over this one."
"BTWI I have no idea why the site would list this as a dunkel when it is so obviously trying to imitate(badly) a Vienna. Style dyslexia?"
"No mistaking it, this is macro and far from quality craft brewing - but I still prefer it to MolBatt."
"clear copper color from a can as I'm spooked by clear glass bottles. The head goes as fast as the local Maple Leafs leave the playoffs. Sweet malt smell. Nice smooth beer with a malt sweetness and a touch of bitterness that keeps it interesting. Very decent and very easy to drink."
"Overall - A decent lager... nothing groundbreaking but probably worth a try..."
"Drinkability is low due to skunking. Would have a much better from tap. Despite that, it still has something going for it."
"Color is an orangey-brown. Aroma is pretty macro-smelling, but the taste is really quite pleasant. It is a not very filling, lightly carbonated, rather sweet beer. Many beers have honey in their names, but this is the first where I can actually taste it. I won't be a regular purchaser of this brand (it's not sold in my neck of the woods anyhow), but it is decidedly not bad."
"jh"
"C'mon sleeman's, I really thought you had something here."
"Taste was OK, with some caramel, some smoke and a slight bitterness. All not very outspoken. It is a lager, so not very fruity or yeasty. Actually it was more like a dark lager and if I would have been blindfolded, I would probably not notice the difference between this one and a sweet lager."
"Not what comes to mind when discussing a Dark Lager, but I digress. Pours out to an amberish / brown color with a short lived head of foam. Some notes of lacing, and a medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of medium bodied malts, roasted adjuncts, some hops, a touch of buttery sweetness. Not bad. Taste is middle of the road, and goes down quite smooth. Honey maltiness blends with mild earth and grain, and a definite note of toastiness and sweetness toward the finish. Mouthfeel was unremarkable. Drinkability is average. Not bad, but far from exemplary."
"D - Not bad, not great. I've had worse. I've had better."
"Taste is very much as predicted, some roasted malts and a cloying caramel sweetness. There's a bit of hop bitterness in the back though. Not complex at all, mouthfeel is a bit bitey. Still though, I find the sweetness a bit too much, and the beer comes off as rather unbalanced toward the toothache-inducing. Some bitterness would have been very welcome. Drinkable, but boring and average to be sure."
"EDIT: Tried again May long weekend 07. Thanks to Mike & Jen for the brew. I stand by my statement that this is the best honey brown on the market, and the best Sleeman's brew."
"Nicely carbonated, not too thin mouthfeel. Pretty good ""just drinking"" beer."
"Drinkability: A good beer that is easily sessionable. I wouldn't mind having more of this."
"Drinkability- Not great, but it served it's purpose. Wen't decent with the shepards pie I had."
"Definatly my favourite Sleeman beer. Perhaps I'd even say my favourite honey lager or ale. I recommend this as a good, and not too expensive session beer."
"Sleeman Honey Brown Lager is my first Sleeman beer. I'm less than impressed. A brown lager (Euro dark lager?) flavored with honey sounds like a good idea, but this rendition leaves a lot to be desired. Rarely have I sampled a beer that tastes as artificially flavored as this one does. No thank you."
"The head never died and laced the glass all the way to the bottom"
"Draft, not comfortable with clear bottles. Amber colored, small white head, thin lace left on glass. Smell of floral and sweet honey, hops is there but not overpowering. Taste is well balanced between the sweetness of malt and honey, and hoppiness. Nice sweet/bitter combination. Continued carbonation gives a smooth finish and appropriate mouthfeel. Bit of a metalic aftertaste I find in all Sleeman products. Overall a pretty good beer. Personally prefer Big Rock Honey Brown for this style."
"I ended up having one of these while I was in Montreal, and the other choices at the place I was eating were such luminaries as Molson EX and Labatt...which I would take this over any day. That said, the best thing I can say about Sleeman's is that they saved Unibroue, my favourite brewer, though if this is any indication of the product bearing their own name, well, I certainly won't be seeking it out in the future."
"The beer decamps the clear 330ml bottle a luminous copper color with a medium sized head that frothy and light tan in color, the left over lace a thin veil upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean with the start sweet and nicely malted, top is light in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic and the hops apropos to the style, a crisp refreshing beer."
"The nose is straightfoward and gives small indications of both the malt and light hops. The flavor is a tad sweet with minor balance from the hops. There is a slightly astringent aftertaste noted. The body is medium and lacks crispness. Overall it is an average lager beer."
"Poured out a copper/bronze color with a nice amount of head that stays with you a while. Smell was quite weak. Very light with some caramel and buttery tones coming through but again, very light. Taste was so-so. A little bit of malts showing through but it was quite a bit on the sweet side. A little too much sweetness in this brew. Aftertaste was just plain watery with nothing going on afterwards. Has a very thin body to it, which would drive up drinkablility somewhat for having some flavors, but the sweetness is too much for me."
"Tasted sweet with a small amount of hop bitterness. Some graininess. An average tasting beer, nothing special. Crisp, light bodied. Very one dimensional."
"Very grainy and proud on the tongue. Perfect light golden color and strong ""beer"" taste. Smells like beer, tastes like beer. Nothing really stands out to make this a special drink, and unfortunately all styles are very similar. I include the cream ale, honey brown lager, silver creek lager and original dark into this review."
"Thx"
"pours out a perfect amber colour with an off white head about a quarter inch thick. the head leaves some slight rings of lace. there are some straight up malt aromas going on...ghost like grassiness too. there is nothing bad about the taste, but there isn't anything too the taste...some slightly sweetened maltiness...i think i can detect some bit 'o honey involved, but i'm not sure. smooth crisp mouthfeel and a medium light body. a bit of bitterness in the finish. while not a great beer...it's drinkable and i could find nothing terribly wrong with it besides the boring and bland flavour profile."
"I had a pint of this in a bar. It did not have much head, and what it had left after a little bit, leaving the beer just sitting there. A little honey in the smell, but nothing special there. The taste was sweet, with a light mouthfeel. Not much carbonation, just a slight honey taste in the beer. I did find it pretty easy to drink, although the name makes the beer sound better than it is."
"Drinkability LOW."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white lace head. The aroma is weak and skunky. It has a lager scent, but I cannot detect any honey or crystal malt smell. The taste average at best. It has a Budweiser type taste. It is skunky, but with a slight malt underlining. It is bitter and has a mild hop flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with massive carbonation. It drinks decent, but this is one that I'm sure to never buy again."
"Pours out to a dark yellowish brown in the glass with a decent head. The aroma is not good and gives off the skunk smell associated with light struck beer. However, once you get past the smell the taste is actually quite good. There is a malty sweetness with a light hop finish that in no way would you think present based on the aroma. Easy to drink."
"At least it goes down without a fight. Man. Is all this Sleeman stuff such junk? Three in a row!"
"Very drinkable... The taste was ok and the alcohol is low so it would be easy to drink more than one of these. However I don't think I would want to."
"I used to be able to drink a fair amount of these in a sitting, but it doesn't sit well on my palate anymore. It was the best of what Sleeman's put out in my opinion, and yet that doesn't seem to say much anymore. But it still far better than the honey brown lager that Big Rock recently concocted. That isn't saying much either."
"Typical tawny brown pour with smallish off white head. Much carbonation, as rivulets of bubbles incessantly make their way to the top. Aroma is only average, with some roasted malt and slight hop notes. Nothing exciting in the taste, some caramel malt, slight roasted flavor....decent mouthfeel. I guess you can do alot worse than this one, but for me, this is pretty pedestrian by comparison to what I usually go for."
"Medium brown lager with a subtle taste of honey. Regular head for that type of lager. Probably the best product from Sleeman but I still don't approve of the clear bottle. Lack of spice and aftertaste in this beer. The malt is also very sweet, almost like a light beer."
"Taste: The best of the sampler pack, imho, although it's still not far above average, if at all. The ""honey"" sweetness is a bit much, although it is balanced by a decent dryness. Finishes well, and doesn't set up camp in your mouth like the Original Dark did."
"Notes: Please beer god take be away from this beer  perhaps a good beer to cook with, a sweet dark beer to balance out a pot of chili or beef stew. As for drinking it  no thanks, never again."
" A little on the bland side, but sometimes you are not looking to get kicked in the head with bold flavours in the middle of the summer. The honey sweetness is well balanced here, making it a decent session candidate. The sweetness might start to infringe on the overall enjoyment of this beer after 4 or 5 – but 2 hit the spot perfectly."
"This one is surprise, surprise, and surprise! Bland. It has a standard lager taste, and what honey it has is notable only in the smoothness it imparts to the mouthfeel, and a hint in the aftertaste."
"Pours without much head leaving little lace. Clear amber with light carbonation. Nose is distinctly skunky which is disappointing, I'm expecting a little bit of honey. Taste does have some sweetness with a brief hoppy finish. FWIW it is better than a JW Dundee - has more body."
"F."
"The head is minimal and laces poorly. The smell is inviting, with a fresh lively character. The taste is smooth, with a very noticable honey note. Mouthfell is well rounded, and lingers nicely. Very drinkable, over several hours. NOTE: Beer is sold in clear glass bottles, so freshness is paramount. Beer suffers terribly with age/light."
"This beer might be more appealing to those drinkers who like Miller and Bud."
"It's clear and bronze in color. A small but sturdy head of fluffiness stays for a while. I found the aroma a bit skunky with a touch of caramel sweetness. Not much skunkiness in the taste though, and the sweetness sticks out. I found it rather refreshing and drinkable."
"Color is brownish golden yellow, some big bubbles for the head that fizz out fast. Smells of strong sweet honey and malts. Taste echoes the smell. Smooth with a honey hop tangyness thats a little rough at first and ends with a nice malt coating. Quite drinkable and flavored honey lager, better then most I've had. Has more solid body where as most others are kinda watery."
"The definition of swill is this beer. Their was neither taste nor smell that I could detect. Expecting a skunk smell due to the clear bottle, I practically snorted the bottle trying to detect any scent whatsoever. Nothing. Tasted like water. In shock, I kept looking at the bottle to see if I were drinking Aquafina by mistake. The appearance was alright. Attractive maple leaf gold. It's only winning attribute."
"Aroma was a tad skunky. The taste was of a nice light honey and non lingering...a little to sweet for me which cuts back on drinkability...."
"My only other run in with a 'honey beer' was JW dundee's honey brown and this is no comparison. Much better, mainly due to its milder honey flavors that are by no means overpowering."
"This beer is a clear bronze color.  A well retained beige head tops it off.  A little mustiness and graininess on the nose.  The taste is pretty bland.  No bad off flavors or anything, just plain ass bland.    It wouldn't be hard to throw some of these back, but water would work nicely as a substitute for this.  Maybe I pick up a little bit of honey and the crispness that goes along with it.  Some faint maltiness.  Buy something else.  There's a lot better than this out there."
"Clear pale brown color, billowy head that stays at 1/2 inch for a while.  Caramel aroma, a little hay smell.  Light and sweet, a little buttery with minimum hop impact.  Could really use some more overall oomph, its watery enough to be pretty much done by the back of the mouth.  A little impression of overcooked celery.  Drinkable, I suppose, its a little more subtle than some honey brews in heavy sweetness."
"Thin and muddy in appearance and taste.  There was sweetness, but none really seemed to come from the malt.  Not well balanced."
