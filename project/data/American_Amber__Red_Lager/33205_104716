3.69,14.2,3.25,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours a clear orange color with a large foam head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted grain malts, with a slight hint of floral and citrus. The lightly toasted grains come through really nicely along with some pleasant honey, and bready malts. Really easy to drink. Perfectly carbonated, and very refreshing. Honestly surprised to see as low of a rating on this one. It's not the best, but it's a super easy drinker, and tasted pretty good to boot. Easily sessionable.","majorbase2","Aug 31, 2014"
