"I actually like this beer a lot, but apparently I'm in the minority, as I don't see it around much any more.  Oh well."

"Taste, back to ordinary, no off flavors, no depth, but pretty standard crystal and caramel malt presence. Hopping is average and fair. Easy enough to drink, but not going to impress your hardcore beer nerd friends, this one is more geared towards others, maybe waiting to make the leap."

"Overall: Much better drink than my previous Tommyknocker beer....I definitely would drink this again but not my first choice considering what other lagers are available. Hope you all enjoy this one and cheers to all!"

"O: I think it's a pretty good little amber lager. A sweet malt flavor with some subtle hop. The only thing keeping from being better is the slight mineral flavor."
""
""
"*Paired with Turkey Burgers with sharp provolone and avocados."
"Over all this is a decent lager but there is nothing real distinctive on the flavor. I enjoyed the brew but there are better versions of the style."
"Overall this is a beer that is just a mess and smacks of having an identity crisis. I don't get this beers angle at all. Where is the basic malt presence, it smacks of both doppelbock and Irish red ale only to give no justice to those styles. Kind of a lost cause here not impressed."
"Overall: A good malty amber that is not too different from others I have but is balanced well. A solid amber that I could session."
"O - aroma borders on 4 but taste falls short."
"If you like ambers, this is something different to try."
"T: brown sugar, honey, malt, toasted grains; a much darker flavor than one expects in an amber, with a touch more hops, spice; I like the flavor quite a bit, but can see how those expecting a true amber would be disappointed."
"O- Well, there aren't too many in this style that impress me. This one didn't impress but I found it to be above average for the style. Probably wouldn't choose to drink again, but if it were given to me at a barbeque or something, I wouldn't mind."
"Overall the beer is okay, kind or plain without much depth."
"Overall I have three more and they are not that offensive but not that exciting either. Pretty standard amber lager."
"D: Overall a decent amber, nice mix of the flavors, maybe a bit too sweet for me, but it was decent nonetheless."
"O: This is a decent Amber Lager that goes down smooth and is enjoyable. The caramel malts, typical for this style, are roughly where they should be, and the citrus flavors balances things out. I bought this as a part of a 12-pack that has six different beers from TommyKnocker Brewery & Pub, LLC. So far, the two that I have sampled have been OK, but not exceptional, by any means. I like the two bottles per style consept versus 12-packs that have four different beers, three each. The third one seems to always end up lost somewhere in the fridge, since I like to drink my beers from a tall beer glass that can accomodate two 12oz. botlles at a time."
"On tap at Icelantic Skis party on a Santa Fe Drive art Friday in Denver."
"The pointless late sweetness is a drag but overall this is a little better than I expected, and slightly above average for the style."
"The mouthfeel is too thin, a light body that should be medium forming the base with too much carbonation, making it spritzy. Not heinously thin or light-bodied, but not better than average."
"I'm not really into this lager at all. It really is lacking in a lot. I won't be seeking this again. One big blahhhh..."
"Overall this was a ok amber. The caramel malts were about where they should be for this style but all in all they come off sweeter then I would like and that hurts the drinkablity. I like the fruitier notes of this beer and the orange peel flavor and aroma worked really well with this beer. I liked most things about this beer but in the end it is just to sweet for an amber. I don't think I would buy a six pack of this."
"D: Fruity and sweet, dare I say a girlie drink?, more suited for the beaches of cancun then on the seat of a bar. Ones fine, hold the seconds, way to sweet and wouldn't waste my time or money on a repurchase."
"Tommyknocker Ornery Amber was amber in color and hazy with some sediment floating about. It had a small white head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was sweet crystal malt with a bit of floral hops. The taste was crystal malt and hops with a dry finish. The mouthfeel was average with a medium-light body and medium-light carbonation. Drinkability was about average. This is a pretty basic amber lager."
"I though this was a pretty good amber lager, much more hop presence than I would expect from this style. Very easy to drink, I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Well, I'm glad I got this as part of a mix pack and not as a whole 6er. I will say that it looks great, but that's where the positives end. Cross this one off the list - not worth getting again."
"The taste is an improvement from the smell. It's creamy and more malty, but there's a modest level of hop bitterness. Decent body with a light level of carbonation. Leaves a sour taste in the mouth."
"D: Very. Not too cloying. Sweet but quaffable."
"Not a bad beer, but definitely not one of my favorites. I'd drink another one if it were free, but I won't be going out of my way to buy this one."
"Conclusion: The average rating for this beer is below a B-. Why? I am not sure, because this bottle is tasting quite nice for an Amber/Reg Lager. I don't expect anything mind blowing from this style, simply a brew that is easy to drink and tastes nice with an array of simple foods or by itself. This would go well with a cheap pizza or hamburger any day."
"Serving type - Bottle poured into glass"
"D - Overall, a tasty offering, but nothing outstanding. I've had better amber ales, and this one is not overly memorable. That all being said, it's still a worthy ale and I would never turn one down if offered."
"Pours a clear amber with a decently sized head. Aromas are predominately sweet, toffeeish; notes of sugary cereal are also present. Flavors aren't bad, but they're very unbalanced. The hops come nowhere close to balancing the sweet maltiness that dominates the flavors from beginning to end. It wouldn't be so bad if only the malts were more layered and interesting, but they're pretty much one note wonders here."
"This one is glowing with an orange clouded amber body. Off white orange tinted khaki head forms nicely with sporadic hit and miss specks of lacing. Aroma a nice mix of sublte bready malts and a chalky mineral yeast character going on, not much hop zing. Flavor pretty much a weird brew up front sweetness hits with caramelized sugars and fresh bread tones with some mineral slighly metallic edges. Really not a bad flavor just a bit one dimensional, backing cluster hops come out with each sip but nothing other than to balance out the bready sweentess. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied no a watery beer definitely has some girth to it, no off flavors to be had. Carbonation is smooth and slightly creamy in texture. Drinkability overall was solid. Makes me not as scared of a mixed 12 pack from them as I used to be."
"Decent but forgetable."
"Overall, I didn't hate this, and it served a secondary purpose of washing down food, but not a real great beer. Just ok, if that."
"Pretty hazy copper colored brew, small khaki head topping it off. Some lacing. Big sweet amber malt scent, touch of bitter hops mixed in there. The thinness immediately strikes me. The malt and hop tastes are kind of underwhelming, there are some fruit and yeast tones that are fairly pleasing though. Im not really a major amber guy to begin with, but this one seems like they forgot to put in half of the ingredients."
"D - Nothing too impressive going on here... The appearance is average at best and teeters on slightly off putting... The aroma and taste are an incoherent mix of scents and flavors... I hate to be overly harsh on craft offerings, but this one is sub par all the way around and drifted far from style guidelines... This was my first Tommy Knocker offering, and while I won't discriminate in the future, it won't be a brewery that I eagerly seek out..."
"D: Definitely a more flavorful incarnation of an American lager, and for that I'm grateful. The flavor and nose are a bit one note, but certainly not bad."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a small head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"Overall - One of my faves in the genre"
"Nothing special, but a pretty solid offering nonetheless."
"Sweet malt flavor, with some band-aid phenols and a bit of a green apple tang. Finishes with an odd watermelon fruitiness. Medium bodied, with mid-level carbonation. On the sweet side overall, with negligible hop presence. Finishes fairly dry. Nothing I'd want again, but I can finish a glass. Inoffensive."
"D- I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down. It goes down very smooth, I could drink several of them if that's what I had available."
"Beer smell is nothing special. As a matter of fact, I haven't been sick all year and I thought my nose was plugged. I could hardly smell any of the beers natural aromas. Taste of the beer is alright. Aftertaste of the beer is good, though. Not one of my favorite Ambers, but I would drink it again if someone bought it for me. Tommyknocker fell off on this one...Other products are better."
"D - easy to pound them back if you are just looking for fuel to get hammered, and not for flavor."
"This beer pours a hazy light amber color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is very faint. There are some clean malty caramel notes with no hop presence whatsoever. The taste is has more to it than the aroma. There are toffee and caramel notes. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied with appropriate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a weak example of an amber lager. I can't see myself drinking this again."
"Not exceptional, but a nice mid-road red lager which goes down easy and has an inviting malt quality not too overloaded with hops."
"D= if you don't care what beer you're drinking, you could probably drink a good few of these if you don't pay attention to it."
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark golden color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, slight hops, some fruity aromas, and some sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is very smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, some earthy malt comes through as well, a good hop background, some pine notes come through faintly, and a slight dryness is present in the finish. Overall, a pretty decent beer with a good blend of flavors; the appearance is lacking, though. Worth a try and definitely deserves a better rep than it has received so far."
"Taste was again bready malt and citrus, but the hops made their presence known as well."
"Fairly unassuming flavor, but well-rounded nonetheless. Not too much sweetness from the malt before the hops take over and finish dryly."
"Too be honest, I hope I'm not too tainted by the shitty service I got when I swung through there on my way up to Winter Park, when the waiters a) seemed totally disinterested in my business and then b) overcharged me when they finally got around to ringing me up."
"This poured a clear, dark copper with some tan head. It smelled like cultured yeast and whole wheat bread, with some brown sugar and apple butter. It tasted like fresh barley and wheat malt, with some brown sugar and sweet bready yeast, and a bit of copper hops. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a somewhat clean but basic taste, and the flavor elements seemed better on their own than mixed together in this beer. It had pretty good body, and was easy enough to drink. It wasn't offensive at all, but the beer didn't do anything to excite me. Just a very moderate and forgettable drink."
"D: Not exceptional on flavor, but nice balance gives is good drinkability."
"Overall, this is a very sessionable beer. There really wasn't anything to special about this beer, but it was worth a shot."
"Nikki"
"Drinkability? Who knows. It certainly drinks easy, but I would pass up on it for many others."
"Drinkability was easy, but maybe too easy? Overall, I'd rate this as ""nice"" ... like that nice girl you took on one date but didn't get around to calling again."
"This beer looked good in color. It poured with little to no head. The smell wasn't very prevalent. Everything else about this beer was bland and boring. The taste I was expecting was nonexistent. I think the packaging probably does more for this beer than the taste. I did buy 2 bottles to give it a fair chance."
"Finish: Fast and not surprising. I was kinda disappointed in this beer."
"this beer poured out with a decent look, macro type head similar to a masproduced American lager,but after that it was no big deal. If I had paid for it I would have been disapointed it just seemed to fall short of something?, rather ordinary. whith some really incredible offerings out there this was kind of dull!"
"D: OK as a session beer. Not terribly exciting, but not bad either."
"D: It's consumable but there's not a lot to suggest this TK offering."
"Drinkability: A decent, drinkable amber lager, but that's not really saying all that much. Still though, I'll take a generic brew over an overpriced bottle of something gack-inducing and horrendous any day of the week."
"I would not recommend this beer. I had this beer on-tap at the brewery in Idaho Springs."
"Out of the six Tommyknocker beers I tried this was one of the better ones along with the Pale Ale. A very appealing red color in the glass and has a nice caramel malty taste to it. It was very well balanced and refreshing as well. I would not mind trying this guy again in the future."
"overall, this i believe would be a solid/good beer if there was some balance to the flavor"
"A slightly amber color, maybe some orange tints mixed into the redness of the beer with a mountainous head that stayed a really long time. A good, heavy fruit smell with not just citric notes but some heavier, darker fruits and tropical fruits along with some malty sweetness (honey?). While there is a decent fruit taste to this beer it is not only dull but rather sour - overpowering if you will from hop bitterness or sour grapes or something. Fluffy from heavy carbonation, has a crisp, rather too sharp backbite that neutralized my taste buds. Just doesn't add up in the taste department; not my cup of beer."
"Overall- Dull and boring. I'll drink the other bottle from my variety 12 pack but I won't turn to this beer again."
"Amber colored ale with a slowly fading head.Aroma is mainly caramel.Taste is caramel with a slight fruity twist.All in all a decent ale,something that I would drink again but not actively seek out.I would recommend to my buddies to try at least one time."
"D - Eh. Not bad. Not good. Just an average amber lager really. This looks really nice and smells good too, but it falls short once you get the stuff into your mouth."
"A fairly unimpressive red ale flavor, whose saving grace is that there weren't any off flavors to it. Good to try, but not enough to be interesting."
"D - This is an okay beer. Not bad for the style and quite sessionable."
"This is an easy drinkin beer that has decent taste. The body was a bit lighter than I expected, but that actually helped make this a very drinkable brew."
"Light bronze color with a nice head that drops firm cap that trails some minor bubbly lacing. First smell gives you a nice fresh floral hop burst. This changes to some heavy caramel malt. Taste is mostly the malt but there are some off wet hay flavors. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. This one started off promising but on closer examination it is lacking. Just an average brew at best."
"d: blah. american ambers are either super hopped and delicious (lagunitas, nugget nectar, etc.) or they are good entry level crossover beers (fat tire) or they are boring wastes of my time. this amber belongs in the later category."
"Drinkability - Truly nothing to keep me interested here. Nothing (other than the cardboard taste) really turns me off, but nothing gets me excited at all. Will not get again."
"D- oneor maybe two of these is all i could put down in a week or month if that. Its alright but i have had better red's"
"Bottle says "" enjoy within 4 months of date notched "" and that is November 2007, so this is a slightly dated beer. Oh well... Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, amber-orange color with a minimal head that looks pretty dead. The smell is very minimal as well, maybe a hint of sweet caramel malt but that's about it. The taste also has the sweet crystal pressence, decently balanced with some earthy, not overly assertive hops. Very smooth from start to finish, no lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium in body and undercarbonated. Drinkablility of this beer isn't too bad. It could use some additional carbonation and maybe some more aroma hops but other than that, a solid beer."
"Taste is that of sweet butterscoth which suggests it may have been sitting too long on the shelf; bought it as part of the Trail Mix; other varieties lacking also; aroma was not impressive; finish was fair at best. Not a beer I would likely buy again."
"This lager is a clear amber color and has a decent beige head. The nose has some candy malts and is fairly light. The taste follows suit. Really faint malts and almost no presence of hops. A light body makes this a drinkable brew. Another average beer from Tommyknocker."
"An easy drinker that isnt overly complex or palate killing. But a decent enough beer."
"D - Drinkability is average. The beer is bland and not something I would seek out again."
"D - Not too shabby, I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered. If you like Yuengling, this isn't a bad comparison."
"Drinkability: First beer of the day after building a deck for 6 hours, so almost anything would be drinkable right now. But overall okay, I would drink another but wouldn't stock up."
"Drinkability is ok, but too sweet for the style."
"A very good beer, one that I could keep coming back to."
"I sound harsh. Keep in mind this sweet taste is actually pretty tasty. I just think it could use more complexity and balance."
"Pours cloudy tea-like color with just a thin lace of head. Smell is sweet with some very fruity aromas and some hints of wheat. Quite carbonated going down with the taste being very fruity (citrus-like) at first, but turns to a malty flavors in the end with slight hop edge in the after taste. This is an OK beer but nothing to get excited about."
"Overall is it was a average beer."
"Drinkability: A good beer, kinda like Fat Tire Light (although this is a lager). A decent beer that I would not turn one down, but I won't be rushing out to get a full six pack."
"Overall this was a decent little amber. I wont say anything really stood out to be fantastic about it but it was definitely decent and would say that it would probably be good in a pinch. Above average and you could definitely do worse then trying this one."
"-Oelergud"
"Not too shabby. This is one of the better TK brews I've had, which unfortunately doesn't say a whole lot. I could get blasted on this at a pub but wouldn't drink it for pleasure. The reality TV of beers...entertaining, but entirely forgettable."
"One of the easiest ambers to consume. A surprisingly enjoyable brew that I had the pleasure to pour for others at the Charlotte Oktoberfest as a volunteer. Right on par to the color and head retention, a bit on the malty side. Though nothing too exciting, it's qualities make it a popular choice at the o-fest for others, and myself."
"season's almost over..."
"Not paying any attention to the label, I did not realise until I opened it that it was a lager. A rather poor lager. Pour was condusive with the style. Clear orange red with a quickly vanishing head. I can sum this whole thing up by saying it lacked character, depth, flavour, and a whole host of other things. This was reddish brown carbonated water. This is hardly even a beer."
"D: Average. This could be a go-to amber or a sessioner for fans of the style. Worth trying."
"Overall, a pretty poor example of an amber lager. Hell, Yuengling is better than this. I bought a mixed sixer so luckily, I have only one of these to drink. Pass this one by going 70mph."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an amber color with a minimal fluffy head that does leave a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is very sweet and actually smells pretty decent, sweet malted barley in the nose. Taste is very bland does not have a real taste to it, maybe a bit of orange peel and just a slight taste of hop bitterness, heavy carbonation on the sides of my tongue. Overall not the best I have tasted but its a bit decent."
"Drinkability: could do two in a night, but not back-to-back; a little too sweet for that"
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer. Pretty standard for the style. It would go well with just about any meal."
"Not a bad beer for the night, but the amber ale has a watery mouthfeel and didn't go well on the first sip. After settling into the beer, it wasn't too bad. Light, spicy notes in the nose, and a little malt sweetness underneath. Taste follows very similar to the nose, malty, peppery spice, and a bit thin. Overall, ok but not going to drive out of may way to get it."
"Drinkability: Fair. I didnt really enjoy this one as much as I thought I would several off flavors that really kind of ruined it for me."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is good. Overall, a pretty basic amber lager. I wouldn't say it really stands out, but it's a decent drinkable beer that I could session if I couldn't find anything more interesting."
"Worth a try."
"The mouth is just thick enough with a bit of slickness. This is an easy drinking beer. I expect my reds to be sessionable, and this one is lives up to my expectations. This could easily work as a crossover beers for folks who have mastered the Killians and Amber Bocks of the world."
"I could enjoy a few of these back to back. Nothing offensive and plenty to enjoy and ponder. An ale that not only stimulates the palate but also the brewing lobe in all of us."
"Not your average lager! It was hard to ascertain the color since I drank it from a brown bottle, but the head is fairly thick and frothy. Aroma is strong and pleasant, much better than that of most lagers I have sampled. The taste is strong, not complex but pleasant, with some surprising hoppy overtones. Smooth and zesty, this is a good party brew."
"The mouthfeel is soft and overall I think the beer is balanced nicely. Solid drinkability level, but probably not a beer that I would seek out in the future. This one might be a tad underrated on BA."
"pours a very light amber color and will give you a three finger head with a forced pour that holds fairly well and a medium lacing. slight roasted malt and floral aromas but weak. taste, some caramel and toast but weak. needs more carbonation to pick up the taste buds. i would probably not go looking for this one but its not bad but i think there is better out there."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color, alright. Average head. Caramel aroma with a slight flowery hoppiness. Very bready character, almost milky. Bit dry. Very light maltiness and an even lighter hop mustiness. OK, but did nothing to really grab my attention. (#2664, 1/22/07)"
"From my variety pack. After the enjoyable Glacier and the downright tasty Butthead, I had high hopes for the amber. Unfortunately, it was my least favorite in the box. Light brown/gray color in the glass; no real smell (good or bad); thin, rather spritzy mouthfeel. Worst of all, the taste was like Coors (almost tasteless malt) with a buttery smooth blandness and a strange metallic aftertaste. I didn't even finish the glass (gasp) because it was just that bad. With so many fanatastic amber lagers out there among American craft brewers, this was a disappointment. The only caramel in the thing is the coloring."
"Pours a slightly hazed deep orangish amber color with a ring of lacing around the side of the glass. Sweet caramel and toasted malt make up the nose. The flavor is pretty straighforward with a slightly toasted malt background and a faint hop presence in the finish. It seems there is just not enough malt, or hops for that matter. Overall, this is a decent at best brew that is not something I will purchase again."
"Drinkability - these disappear fast. A most competent and sessionable beer from TK."
"This beer straddles the fine line between bland and offensive, with blandness (thankfully) winning out, albeit slightly. The yeast ain't good enough to be the star of the show, and nothing else comes to its rescue."
"It's not the sort of thing I'll choose to drink again."
"DI dont really care for it and would not have it again."
"Drinkability - Not terrible. I probably won't buy another pack of the Tommyknockers beer. This came in the 12 pack sample and is one of the better one's, but still not great."
"12 oz bottle, best within four months of July 2006, pours a slightly hazy copper with a finger of white head that quickly subsides to a thin ring of lace. Nose is a slightly toasty malt with a caramel note, rather light. Taste has a light malty sweetness overlaid with a slight grassy hops, the whole thing giving way to a bad sour fruit aftertaste. Thin bodied, watered down, this beer is a mess. Between the water-like body and the horrible aftertaste, this beer is a drainpour."
"The drinkability is good. I really like the toasty Carmel notes, I would buy this again. MK"
"Poured a bright orange color with moderate white puffy head. Smell is very light, with only a bit of sweet fruit to be found. Taste presents a firm sweet maltiness that is exceptionally pleasnt. Nice full creamy mouthfeel. Finish is light and very refreshing. Very drinkable, however the flavor begins to fade as more of the glass in consumed."
"Orange amber in color, with an off white head that lasts as a ring. Fruity aroma, like apple peels and white grapes, with fresh grains, a caramel malt, and a little musty hops. The taste is fruity as well, the apple peel and grapes are there, but also some ripe orange and a hint of grapefruit. A sloid caramel malt that is a bit grainy flavor, with a little yeasty flavor. Some grassy and musty hops come through a bit more in the finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little flat, it sticks the the mouth a bit, average carbonation, but nothing bad about it. The drinkability is actually pretty good. I wouldn't call it a premium beer, but well crafted none the less, I could easily have more than a couple."
"Dont drink this one too cold as it mutes a lot of the character. I was disappointed cold, but it was good a bit warmer."
"A boring average amber, wouldn't bother with this one in the future."
"Interesting malt profile makes this a decent amber. would make a good session beer. I found the mustiness interesting and unexpected. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light, leading to a more sessionable beverage. Finishes slightly sweet."
"D: I must have got a good bottle because I thought it wasn't bad. I wouldn't hunt it down but I'd certainly drink it again if presented to me."
"Hazy copper with golden highlights. Big bubbled, antique white head of steadily wilting foam that became a skim coat. No carbonation streams and no lacing. Light fresh grain with a soft spicy lemon zest component. Light grain notes up front that give way to the gentle spicy hops which carry through the finish. The finish is brief and the palate is clean. The carbonation is sufficient to lift the medium body. Passable, but still left room for improvement. Perhaps being one month past the brewery fresh taste date was the culprit."
"Pretty typical of Ambers. A good, safe beer. Quite clear medium amber color with initial promising retention, then went flat. Smells pretty malty with a citrus hop aroma. Tastes moderately malty and lightly syrupy. Strong hops remind me of an American Pale Ale. Body is moderate with a light tacky feel. Finishes a bit sweet and bite-ey, maybe from over stressed grain. I'd like to try it again, but I'm not in any hurry."
"Cetainly deserves to be tagged an ""American"" version of an amber. A surpisingly aggressive hops bite jumps out at the gate. Some rough hops-oil flavors add a slightly grating edge to the hops that is not unpleasant, so long as you like your hops on the rugged side. Nicely paired with a caramel malt, but the beer was weighted just a tad too much in favor of the hops. Finish was blunt with bittersweetness."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light tan head over the cloudy orangey amber brew. Head quickly depletes to a swirly film, with a group of big bubbles in one area, with average to good lacing. Aroma is grain pellet, with a touch of tart fruit. Taste is the same, well-balanced, sedate. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, maybe a bit chalky, and drinkability is very high. Didn't have too high of hopes for this brew, but was pleasantly surprised."
"Feel is fairly bold, clean, and well-rounded within a medium body. Again, the malts are what's making this amber worth anything and its not bad. I suppose a bit more hoppyness could help add some complexity and balance. Otherwise this is a fairly easy going amber thats easy enought to have a couple more of before boredom may set in. Thanks to Justin my 2nd Cuz on my wifes side for the samples!"
"Not bad, very smooth toffee and grain flavors. It is a wee bit on the thin side, but still tasty enough and reasonably drinkable. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is on the thin side. This is a very easy to drink beer. I wont be particularly upset if I never drink this one again."
"Last swigs: Tastes like an amber lager with an ale yeast."
"Bright transparent orange color, head of a little less than 1/2 an inch in a pint glass. Slipping ring laces. Brown sugar malt aroma, a bit of diacetyl, no real hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light and the carbonation is slightly higher than average. Very consistent taste front to back, malted milk, a bit of vanilla, pleasant residual sugars. Not much of a snap to it. That's the good part, while easily quaffable, the beer is pretty thin and average in most flavor and body categories. Might be a good introductory Lager for someone who is looking for a malty easy drinker and wants to try some different things."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful crystal malt scent along with some light hops and a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a crisp, yet dry caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent amber lager. The aroma is great, but the flavor falls short of expectations. Overall, a good drinker."
"12 oz. with an overdue freshness date. Damn you Mike's Mart! Anyway, it looks quite nice. Pours into the pilsner glass a hazy chestnut with lots of carbonation and a 1 finger tan head that leaves some lace. Lots of sediment in the bottle after the pour. Caramel and almost cloyingly sweet malts in the nose. Taste is.... sour, and very bad. I taste dill pickles. Seriously. It's bad. I tasted several gulps to make sure it was that bad. I could barely hold it in my mouth long enough to judge the mouthfeel, which was average I guess. This is the first time I've dumped a beer I'm reviewing down the drain. The other beers from the mixed 12 aren't bad... perhaps it was never good in the first place."
"To me, this is one avoidable brew. The sourness is just too much."
"All in all a good solid effort"
"I was a bit disappointed when the waitress brought me another one. It wasn't bad enough for me to ""trade it in"" but I won't be ordering it again."
"Well, the beer warmed a bit since I forgot about it and a fair amount of the carbonation is gone. It tastes much better, which still isn't stellar. The aftertaste now has some fruity flavors...strawberry and pear. There's also a tang that comes across as iron, but I'm thinking it originated from toasted grains."
"Appearance is translucent dark amber with beige foam and not much lace. Aroma is of brown sugar and malt, with leafy hops. Initial taste is bland: some grain, malt and bitter floral hops. Middle has caramel, but not too sweet. A light watery brew, slightly sweet, with a finish strong on yeast bread. I would not try again."
"Pours an orange/amber red with little or no head. Nose is pleasantly fruity, citrusy and hoppy. Taste is a thick sweet citrus, with creamy malts and a hop bite. More medium-bodied than I had expected for this red. Highly carbonated - makes it more drinkable. Could see myself putting a few of these back, though I don't know if I'm enough of a red fan to come back for more. Not a bad beer though. Refreshing on a hot day."
"SLightly hazed light maroon color, small ring of foam around the top of the glass. Smell is light maltiness, sweet with carmel, and a light grassiness. Taste is also slightly sweet and malty, hops are not that prominent, but there. This is pretty similar to the quality of the othr TK beers, slightly above average, but not outstanding."
"Ornery Amber isn't ornery in the least. Its flavor is anything but aggressive or challenging (although it is a minor chore to get through the entire bottle). The limp mouthfeel brings a few other adjectives to mind, but ornery surely isn't among them. This is my first Tommyknocker beer and I am something less than impressed."
" Drinkability is not great would look elsewhere if you desire a good amber. Thanks to merlin48 for this sample."
"Drinkability is good here. Taste is decent enough for a session amber, but there are many better choices."
"This is an unremarkable beer that is okay to drink because it has a pretty good flavor. What it lacks in appearrance and body, it makes up for in taste. It's just not enough to make it better than a slightly above average beer. Maybe it's better on tap."
"Pours a brown color with a small head that quickly dies away and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly citrus, but nothing too strong - some malt is there too. The flavor is somewhat bland, like the aroma. Slightly watered down. There is a small hop presence and it doesn't have the standard ""lager stank."" I probably won't have this one again."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a finger of headthat drops to a nice film over the top of the beer. The nose has a citrusy grapefruit and orange. The taste is just sort of flat, without anything that jumps up and grabs me. There's a metallic aftertaste taht sticks with you well after the beer is done. I'm not real impressed with this one. The mouthfeel is nice. There is a creamy texture that I haven't felt in other beers before. Its a nice feeling. There's not as much carbonation as I would expect. The beer is highly drinkable, but I think it comes as a sacrifice for flavor. The beer is worth trying, but another mediocre offering from Tommyknocker."
"Very drinkable but not for the right reasons. It's so smooth and flavorless it goes down easy."
"This beer wasn't terrible by any means, I was just expecting alot more. It is quite refreshing, but I personally wouldn't put it much above a good lawnmower beer."
"The flavor is sweet malt with virtually no bittering from hops. The feel is thin, watery, and lacks snap in the finish due to the lack of carbonation. Fairly poor actually and my numbers are generous. Lack of desirable drinkability due to the unimpressive feel and lackluster taste."
"The Ornery Amber poured a red-orange-copper color with a fizzy head that quickly dissipated to only a collar. Has a subtle malty nose with hints of caramel. It has a pretty mild taste to it - some maltiness with a slight metallic aftertaste. There is no hop taste to speak of here. As it warmed up, I noticed more caramel flavor and maybe some subtle fruitiness. It's a pretty smooth, drinkable beer. Overall, not a bad beer but nothing to write home about."
"Its clear, orangeish-copper body is capped by a thin, frothy head that drops readily to a big-bubble accented collar and leaves only spotty lace. The nose is mainly malty with a distinct note of caramel amidst its bready and lightly toasted Munich malt, with just a touch of background floral hops. The body is medium and it's fine, moderate carbonation leaves it gently crisp before warming to become slightly creamy and smooth across the palate. Everything suggested by the aroma is carried forth in the flavor with a round, gently toasted, nutty and caramelish malt that's accented by a slight floral hop flavor and a low-key bitterness. It finishes slightly sticky with malt sugars, but then dries quickly leaving the palate ready for another taste. Interestingly malty."
"12 oz bottle. Clever explanation of a tommyknocker on the label. Medium amber color, slightly copper. Thin white head. Not much aromas. Metallic mostly, maybe a tribute to the mining past of the area it is brewed ? Some sweet malty flavors, mostly metallic, with hints of buttery peas, yea peas. Oddly vegetable taste to finish. Slick and thin. Not much body. Not awful or undrinkable, but lots of faults show up. Maybe an bad bottle, or maybe I am becoming spoiled. That's probably it."
"Medium amber color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied amber. Slightly roasted sweetish malts. Hops are mild and slightly spicy. Good balance. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter."
"Since when is being Ornery a good thing? When I think ornery, I think of the smart-ass kids you find on network TV sitcoms. I hate those kids. Luckily I will not hold the adjective against this beer. Pours a dark orangish-brown with a medium thin bone white head. Aroma of malt, caramel and maple. Medium-bodied and kind of syrupy, with flavors of caramel, malt, honey and hops. More hops would have helped this beer, as it almost OD's on the sweet/syrupy aspect. The finish is sticky too. Another forgettable beer from Tommyknocker."
"This brew pours a small head of fine to medium sized off-white bubbles and a transparent slightly cloudy carbonated amber body. Its aroma is that of mild malts and caramel. This brew has a mild initial caramel flavor with a bit of acidic undertones. The spices also come out to play as along with the roasted caramel notes. All of the flavors are quite mild but still tied together in a slightly complex manner. If it was stronger I'd like it even more."
"When this brew was poured into my glass it had a small off-white creamy head with fine-small bubbles that quickly diminished. The body was cloudy, thin and watery and it was light orangish in hue. There was very little lacing with this brew. There was very little character to this brew. It was just plain flat and boring."
"Color is a dark orange amber (duh, it's name says what it is) Poured with very little almost non existent head that disappeared very quick. Smell is a caramel malt with a hint of raisin. It's flavor is a rich sweet malt, almost thick, with only a bit of hoppiness which you don't even taste until about 10 seconds after you swallow it. It's an ok beer, nothing special though. A good beer for those who don't like a great deal of hop in their brew."
"Pours a sort of funky dark orange-amber color, topped by a thin, off-white head. The head quickly fades to a thin ring of foam. The aroma has a similar funk to it, becuase it has a familiar smell to it, but I'd swear it is decomposing grass clippings or wet hay. Maybe it's that smell from a bottle of vitamins. Whatever it is, it's not disgusting, just out of place. Theres a decent malt component to the smell as well. Ok, the taste has a vitmain, medicinal, metallic note as well. Maybe this is Vita-Beer? I even get the vitamin aftertaste. After a few sips, the taste gets a bit sweeter, with a touch of bitterness at the end. Aftertatse is a touch of citrus. Grainy, gritty mouthfeel. Drinkability a little less than average. Most lagers have a lot less aftertaste and a cleaner nose. Glad there's only one."
"Crystal clear dark copper hue. Thin, spotty, soapy head manages muddled, loose lace. Light caramel and gently toasted malt in aroma, with a slight tinge of herbal hops. Clean, but prosaic aromawise. Non descript caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by grainy, mildly nutty Vienna malt and mild hop bitterness. Faintly floral hop flavor. Hints of toffee and toast emerge late, adding token depth. Hop bitterness is too understated to offset the prominent caramel malt presence, lending balance well skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied, passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes with a bready sweetness yielding to a slight tartness akin to an unhopped yeast starter. Ornery Amber is a decent brew without outright flaw, but without noteable character either. Quaff and move on."
"Hmmmmm.  A beer that pours no head.  Interesting.  Scarlet red in color.  Slightly chill hazed.  Some sweet malt on the nose and faint hops.  And a little mustiness as well.  Taste is more of the same.  Subtle sweet malt with traces of chocolate malt as well.  And the mustiness as well.  Body is decent. About medium-full.  Nothing horrible here, but on the flipside, nothing good either.  I thought I was getting an Ornery Amber ale and instead I got an Ordinary Amber ale."
"Should be called ""Ordinary"" Amber...Flavor isn't bad...has a sweet, malty taste and I get some caramel tones to it...the nose light but has some malt notes...body is flat and this holds this down from a very slightly above average beer to a slightly below average beer...also, just a tich too sweet on the finish....not much for hops on this one.."
"This Colorado mountain brew pours a light orange-amber color with almost no head retention.  The aroma is bready with a bit of malt and a hint of hop spice.  The body is light and the flavor is quite malty with a lingering hop spiciness.  In a bottle this is an average amber, it seems that the brewer is still playing with a melded flavor profile."
"it poured practically no head and has little aroma to excite the senses.  A  medium body with tamed roasted caramel malts and dry crisp finish left me thinking that this was brewed not to offend anyone.  not great, not bad."
