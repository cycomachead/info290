If you have a choice, definitely choose draught over bottle (the bottles have a weird metallic taste). Overall, I recommend this beer.","PorterPro125","Jul 26, 2014"

3.21,4.6,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Had a pint on tap at a Calgary neighborhood pub, following another pint of its white stable mate. Was considering an attempt at the whole Rickard's rainbow but perhaps fortunately there were only the two most common options. This red lager is an attractive amber red hue, more red than brown, and is highly carbonated. As is so often the case with decent but not earth-shatteringly good macrobrews, the aroma is not unpleasant but is faint and takes some work to discern: I get some caramel, red fruit, and some citrus hop notes against a toasty malt backbone but the whole thing is downplayed. Taste was astonishingly fruity in this example, a bright sweet cherry gum flavor along with another form of rounded corny sweetness, bramble fruits, and some subdued caramel that follows the nose. Some tangy spice accompanies a fairly watery body and a minimally bitter finish with metallic, cardboard, and sour apple notes, although frankly I have tasted worse faults in micro-brewed red/amber ales. Other examples I have tried had a dry nut character. There's some technical proficiency here but little true artistry unless one deems the emphasis on fruit and medicinal notes to be a unique feature of this particular exemplar. Personally, I'd like more caramel/crystal malt and hops to provide balance. Color me conservative.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 07, 2013"

Overall not something I'm likely to enjoy regularly, but any trip to a chain restaurant with limited beer selection here in Canada means that this becomes a viable option.","DenisKolkin","Nov 03, 2013"

3.48,13.4,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"a good standard easy drinking red beer. branded as an irish style, this seems distinctively Canadian to me. a lovely darker copper amber color with a tall lacing head that would get even higher marks if it lasted more than a minute or so. a pleasant mix of malts, less dry irish red than American style amber to me, with a touch of earthiness, a bit of smoke, some caramel sweetness, and a peculiar yet enjoyable nutty element. the carbonation is great, tons of little micro bubbles instantly refreshing me and getting my palate ready for a big afternoon and evening of beer consumption here. this is an all day beer at a lower abv and such a quick finish for the style. a much better than average brew here, impressive for a Molson coors offering, and one id be happy to drink again. a little adjunct and metallic on the finish, but its minor and doesn't deteriorate much from the overall experience.","StonedTrippin","Aug 19, 2013"

Poured into my camp cup (while camping in the Pisgah National Forest) a clear copper / red with a thin, effervescent head - looks refreshing at least! Smell: hmmm, what smell?! Just malty / sugar.

Hoppy bitterness was a little heavy handed and it didn't have enough malt to balance. Medium carbonation but the body was watery.

Big name aside, you do have to (reluctantly) give credit where credit is due - Rickard's Red is a solid, enjoyable brew. Better on draught, certainly, but still good bottled. Even bars that only tend to carry lowest-common denominator beer seem to have this one on tap, so it is - and will continue to be, as long I'm forced by friends to frequent those establishments - a brew I enjoy regularly.","headlessparrot","Beers"

Head sticks to the glass for most of the pint. Smell is faintly sweet, hoppy. Taste starts out a bit sweet, then goes on to a grapefruity sour. Alcohol is fairly prevalent, even though this isn't THAT strong of a beer. Finish is fairly clean but slightly bitter. This beer starts with a slight tangy carbonated feel, but weakens quite quickly and ends up being quite soft and smooth on the way down. I like this for a session beer, and for a macro, it's quite acceptable.","trevorwideman","Apr 28, 2005"

But more than ever, now that I'm at the bottom of my glass, is it apparent to me that it tastes just like a coppery version of Molson Canadian, perhaps with a bit more corn for that added sweetness.
