I happen to like all beers and depending on the mood I might want a cheap strong beer. That being said this beer is not expensive, so I will treat and rate it as so. Like other strong beers in its category, Malt liquors, High Gravity lagers, Ice beers... this beer is a cut above the rest. This kind of reminds me of a cross between Olde English and Leffe Blonde, of course it’s made at 1/4 the budget of Leffe Blonde so please don't bash it. If you want a better tasting strong beer/ale then go for something like a Leffe Blonde. If you want a six pack of strong beer for the price of two Leffe Blonde's than look no further!

Well, not much to look at. For a, albeit slightly, bigger beer there was nothing to the appearance, maybe a little more color than a typical Miller beer. Smell, well, pretty much the same, a little better than typical Miller. However, it was not bad. Reasonably tasty and easy to drink, a little better than Miller High Life which is not horrible. Plus, at almost 7% it gets a little bonus overall, especially if you can get if for 4 buck a six. I will be stopping back by to stock up on this, it is drinkable and I can fill the fridge with it for guests who do not like beer snob stuff, and if I have to end up drinking it, or if I am having a quantity day, giddy up.","JamieDuncan","Jul 21, 2014"

If Miller would only add some more hops this beer could be a 5.0 instead of 4.5 as it is a big malty brew with a good mouth feel but without the requisite hop nose and bittering hop level to balance it. I would call it's style as Maibock if I were to give it an international style description. Miller please rethink the inadequate hop level on this beer and add an adequate hop level and you will sell more. I would still be more inclined to drink this than any of the other American Pilsner lager beers available.","Stan47150","Jul 16, 2014"

Its a little more malty, given the higher abv, but most of the sweetness is from corn. Underwhelming taste with minimal hop presence. Mouthfeel is ok, and overall this is slightly below average for style. $7.49 for a sixer with 6.9% abv - I mean, I'll probably get it again but its definitely more about the buzz than the flavor with this one.","BoozySmurf","Jul 15, 2014"

It's ethanol taste is remarkably subtle, the liquid has a light crisp feel. It's light on spice and flavor, but it delivers what it promises which is a higher than mainstream ABV that is potable for the masses. I don't perceive it as insulting.

And with the 1.9% higher abv than most macros, it's okay for the masses. It's basically marketed to the "club" crowd in their early twenties. It's marketed as "classy" and has a higher abv that bars can charge 7-8 bucks a pint. All the while guys with way too much cologne and hair gel think they're drinking something great in their futile attempt of bringing home a girl drinking pina coladas.

It's a surprisingly deep amber color. Fingerprint clear through the glass. Fairly decent head retention - the lacing could be better for sure, as the spots that are left slide steadily down the glass before your eyes. The aroma is quite fruity and estery. Sweet malt is present as well, but also adjunct-like. Somewhat dextrinous in the mouth with a moderate carbonation that leaves it gently crisp. The flavor follows. Sweet with sugar and light malt flavors, some caramel but not much - adjunct-like overall. Pear, apple, and some dark skinned fruit... esters and alcohol... 6.9% shouldn't be so easily revealed, and I'm also finding what I think of as higher alcohols (in the way that it hits the back of my throat and then makes my face and ears turn red). Not much bitterness here, but balanced. It finishes drying with a bit of malt and a wash of alcohol to take it away. Some minor hop flavors may be appearing in the finish, leafy and floral. English in character, I'd think. And if I had to categorize this beer I'd probably classify it as some kind of English strong ale, but there's also a kind of malt liquor character to it that shoots that down. Brash. Alcoholic. Odd for a large brewery to allow that, especially in fancy packaging. I have to ding it on points for the flavor as it's got such a kind of "hot fermentation" aspect to it.","NeroFiddled","Mar 05, 2014"

Color was a deep-gold (SRM = 7) with NE-quality clarity and everyone in the car began to wish that we were in Lincoln, NE, cozying up to Val Midwest, rather than being at The Tao of Steve's mercy, rocketing through Noe Valley in CAN FranCANisco. I leaned in for a sniff and it hit me like a right cross from Ronda Rousey! I smelled better from Minhas products and this was awful! Plastics factory, chewed pink bubble gum, dry cleaning plant and gas station tarmac all came immediately to mind. I may have played my last hand. Mammon, Midas and Croesus, all of whom had shown up for a taste, began to back away, checking to ensure that no one had any spark-producing devices. Mouthfeel was thin, watery and exuding a melange of other-worldly flavors like bubble gum and solvent. I will never employ a drain pour and then count it towards The CANQuest (TM), but I was sorely tempted in this case. Was this someone's idea of a joke? I CAN do much better. After a while, I began to make some headway, just as Mad Max showed up on his bike and instructed me to stuff a bedsheet wick into the opening and set it alight.

My only gripe with Fortune is that I have a hard time finding any correlation to it's target market, bourbon whiskey, aside from the use of corn as an ingredient. Notes of vanilla, common to the spirit, emerge slightly in flavor but it's focus is primarily on the addition of caramel sweetness to the otherwise grainy pale malt base. The result is a slightly stronger lager that's relatively clean with more flavor than most Miller drinkers might be used to but nothing that will wow the seasoned craft drinker but again, this is not brewed for them anyway. With that said, aside from the noticeable adjunct flavor (still acceptable for it's style), Miller Fortune displays no bad traits.

That time is long gone. So here we are in the age of mega-brewers and their micro-brew attempts. So comes Miller to bat with its latest creation. Pours a faint reddish amber. Little head with faint lacing. Very active carbonation. Apples, alcohol, and malt aromas. Oaky barley front palate. Quick sting of alcohol. Faint hops and bread mid-palate. Very strong. Rough and sharp. A juxtaposition to typical high ABV brews. No hop notes on the back palate. This is malt and alcohol. I've heard comparisons to malt liquor and I can see why, but this is far smoother than malt liquor. There is a faint sweetness. Caramel corn. Some dry malt rows. A lingering oak and smoke. Miller is said to have based the taste structure around whiskey. I can see that. This is a sharp stinging beer with deep sugar flavors transposed over smoke and oak. It is a sipping beer. I can't imagine trying to session this without a headache ensuing the next day. Is it a grand achievement? No. But I will give Miller this-- they took a risk and there is no way you can say they were copying their big brewer brothers... this is something different. High end malt liquor?

Start with one of these and switch off to 5% or lower if you plan to last the evening. Holds its own with Batch 19, although the Coors is arguably the better brew when all is said and done. Should be interesting when matched against Black Crown and Becks Sapphire.","Rumpole","Feb 12, 2014"

Even though I have an appreciation for some of the less loved end of the beer aisle, anything with the actual Miller name on it has been a no-go for me for years. Well, this is the best product that says Miller on it I've ever had. After some consideration I'd say it sits on a fence between the ideal malt liquor & your typical red. Worth it if you're into both.","longbongsilver","Feb 11, 2014"

3.88,51.6,4,4,3.75,3.75,4,"I am shocked that Miller did such a good job brewing this beer. It has a nice 2 finger head on it, a awesome amber color that you wouldnt expect from a miller product. The taste and mouthfeel in my opinion is a full body beer backed up by a 6.9% abv. I would choose this over budweiser black crown or the bud light platinum any day of the week. Hands down for a american adjunct lager this is great!","MarkSmith86","Feb 10, 2014"

If you are looking for mostly good taste, I might look elsewhere - however.","jgm038","0"

The business reporting on this beer was hilariously ignorant: 'Miller Fortune is brewed with Cascade hops to give it its bourbon-like flavor. Bloomberg describes the taste as “resting somewhere between a craft beer and a light lager.” ' I got no bourbon or cascade hops(which obviously don't create a bourbon-like flavor). I would recommend this for 40oz drinkers who want something classier but don't actually want to drink craft beer or quality imports etc.","IPAnderson","Jan 29, 2014"
