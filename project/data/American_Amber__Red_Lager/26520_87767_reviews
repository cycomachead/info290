"good, sturdy and reliable lager."

"A very hoppy nice lager.  Very clean and crisp."
"O: [4.00] This beer reminds me of Eliot Ness (that is a good thing) but with some added zip in the spices and in the carbonation.  I am enjoying this and could drink more than 1 in a single sitting."

"Nice off white head. Beautiful Amber hazy color. Nose is biscuit, toasted, subtle malt and hop. Great malt bite right at first, very subtle hop bitterness with a super dry finish."
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/12/2014. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of spicy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy amber lager. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"outstanding all around Lager. nice hoppy taste & aroma"

"Pungent citrus smell. Sweet citrus taste with a hop bite. Very clean & not complex.aftertaste isn't overly pleasant. Prefer Troegs perpetual ipa which is similar although I do appreciate the flavor in a clear clean beer."
"Grabbed it a Wegmans to fill up a six pack. Nice lager"
"Solid beer, wouldnt go out of my way to look for it though, but thats just me i know my gf and others love this beer"

"Pouring a dark amber with a dense off white head that leaves sheets of lacing, this looks great. The nose is loaded with hop bitterness and flavor with pine, candied orange peel, mint, pine sap. Quite spicy. Bread like Munich malt character is present with toffee and burnt sugar. The palate opens mildly bitter with burnt sugar, toasted malt and spicy and fruity hops. Pine, pine sap, mint, green grass, candied oranges, a mild chalky bitterness, mildly gritty. The mid palate has flavors of toast and burnt sugar.  Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has a long finish with a blend of the Munich malt base and the hop melange. Not wholly harmonious, but still quite enjoyable."

"Too hoppy for my tongue, but only just. Teeters on the edge of being enjoyable before eventually falling the wrong way."

"Edit: after drinking an entire sixer of this beer over a week I'm less impressed. Something seems a little incongruous about the flavors. Definitely an original brew but im not sure the disparate elements stylistically hang together for me. I found myself liking each successive bottle less than the last."
""

"M- Low-medium carbonation.  A little watery in the middle but holds up to my expectations of the style."

"Overall - Just on the cusp of too heavy and malty. It turned out to be pretty good, despite not being what I expected at all."
""
""
"PS: Can still taste the toffee, grapefruit and salt half-hour after drinking. The aftertaste actually becomes more pleasant with time. Definitely love this aspect of this particular beer."
"Price Point - $2/12 oz single"

"as the amber take on a lager, for what it is, this is nice...but not a combo that appeals to me. i am blown away by jack's abby and the variations on a lager theme that they do...an amber just doesn't appeal to me."

"O - I do feel as though some Jack's Abby brews are too similar, this being one of them. It reminds me very much of Hoponius Union (although not as good). With that being said, it's a very solid hoppy Amber Lager, which to my knowledge, there aren't many of. Great hoppy taste and drinkability, my only complain is a weakish malt backbone. Highly recommend this beer to any hoppy beer fanatic, especially anyone who will appreciate the smoothness of a lager with the hoppiness of a Pale ale."

"Pushes towards a colder season lager. Nice and malty with an assertive yet not aggressive hop character. Solid, but under performs against the rest of the lineup."
"D/O- Well, the drinkability is there but given it's high ABV for an amber lager it shouldn't be viewed as a session beer. Thanks for this oft-overlooked style @mj0126"

"Overall I'm very impressed with this one and will certainly be headed back for more. I've always liked malt forward yet hoppy beers and this combines those with a lager base that is superb."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is interestingly bitter and solvent for a lager but worth trying if you get the chance. Thanks again Heath."
""
"O -- I really enjoy this for the late fall/winter months. Warms you up with a good alcohol content. Cheers!"

"O: A very nicely done brew with some nice minute complexities. Easy to drink, plus it now comes in 6-packs! Definitely recommended"
""
"Just fabulous. Hearty, rich, textured and full of flavor. The stone fruit in this is the surprise and the sensation. it softens the hop character to the point of luxury. It enhances the grain sweetness but doesn't overshadow it. It takes to the bit of hop spice and makes this beer dapper and a little bit sweet."

"Overall (4.25): This one doesn’t bowl you over in any one regard, but rather it shows a lot of subtlety that comes out here and there when you probe a little deeper. It’s easy to drink and really pleasing if you’re looking to just kick back and drink something immediately tasty and not too crazy, but it’s also great if you’re willing to sit down and look into its depth and complexity. This is really damn good. I’ve always expected good things from Jack’s Abby, but this is very pleasantly well-crafted—awesome beer. Great job, you guys."

"O- A very tasty brew, 10/10 would buy again. Would like more flavor on the hop side, the malts shine here."
""
"500ml bottle served in pilsner glass. Pours an amber hue with a translucent clarity and a creamy, two-inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a half-inch, rocky cap, leaving delicate strands of textured lacing as the brew recedes. Nose expresses cereal notes - sweet and biscuity, as well as a suggestion of citrus. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a slight caramel character and a light bitterness towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a touch of oiliness and citrus astringency. Overall, not my favorite from this brewer, but a decent offering for the style, nonetheless."

"Quite good overall."

"O: A really nice red lager. Reminds me a lot of their red tape lager but with a caramel malt instead of a bready malt. In either case, it's very smooth, balanced and easy drinking. Hops add just enough kick to make it stand out. Very drinkable."

"Full caramel malt flavor up front. Full-bodied. The hop comes along strongly--very peppery in the swallow. Long lasting aftertaste with a creamy finish. Decent carbonation."

"Overall a crisp refreshing beer, and a welcome change from stronger winter beers."
"This beer pours a nice reddish orange Color with a nice white head that slowly recedes lacing the glass beautifully. The smell is piney hops and a nice bready malt backbone. Taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Overall a great beer"

"A great beer, would have no idea if this was a lager if it didn't tell me. Just fantastic."
""

"O – This is a really tasty beer, but I almost definitely would not be able to call this a lager in a blind test. This has much more body and much more bitterness than I was expecting – very IPA-like. Now, I am not complaining about this in any way at all; I was just surprised to find all this in a lager. Jack’s Abby is not only putting out great lagers, they’re putting out great beers."
"O: Other then the aroma this is a really solid beer its not my style and I still quite enjoyed it plus the fact that it is dangerously drinkable makes it totally worth a try I would recommend it especially if this is your style of beer"
"Overall OK but not great. The malt profile is nice, but the hops don't seem to do as well as I expected in this beer. They're nice hops but bring too much of an American spicy soapy profile to mesh well with the lager and amber malt flavors. Could also have been a bit more crisp. Also, the booze comes through a bit hot, and would be very nice if this was supposed to be 9% instead of 7.2%. I do like that perfumey booze on a doppelbock, but this is a regular bock. That being said, it's still a nice beer with great malt profile, tasty and drinkable."

"Poured from half liter bottle into lager glass. Thick, foamy white head over golden bronze, clear liquid. Head persisted for a while then dwindled to foamy rafts, nice lacing. Aroma was slightly hoppy, trace citrus, swee malt underneath. The flavor is clean, a little piney, a little floral, nice grapefruit bitterness. Sweet malty flavors underneath. Pretty well balanced. Went nicely with spicy chicken and salsa I was eating. Nice brew. It is Refreshing and a great change from the heavy winter fare. Would be good for friends and food...not too extreme, yet flavorful and would hold its own with hearty grub."
"O/D-Balanced and pretty fun. Not my favorite Jack's offering. Two of their beers are probably somewhere in my top 10-15 all-time beers. This one is not in the same stratosphere but it is well worth the $2.75 half liter price. I will always give their beers a shot. Probably won't go back to this one but it is still better than 50-60% of the beers I will try this month."
"O: I'm not quite sure where they were trying to go with this one. The name would suggest a bock kicked up a notch with American hops. Not a bad attempt by any means, but I still find it a bit confusing on the palate. It dries out a bit too much toward the finish, presumably to showcase the hops more, but that kind of curtails the bock aspect of it. Unless my palate deceives me, it seems like there's some specialty malts at play here too. The malt base just doesn't taste as complex as a bock's should, and it makes for some odd flavors (maybe that bubblegum?). Having said all that, this is still a worthy beer at the end of the day."
""
"This beer is excellent. This is the second or third beer I've had from Jack's Abby that seems tough to categorize style-wise. They seem to bring something unique to the table with their take on each style the take a stab at. This is no exception. The ability to bring a great hop character and balance it this well seems to be something they have a touch for. Very well done once again."

"The name leaves me curious."
""
""
"O: Jack's Abby continues to take tasteless styles and give them a rebirth, putting the new American craft spin on them. Maybe some of the weaknesses of the style are hidden in the generous hop additions but regardless, it's another well-crafted beer! I rated according to style and it's really that good."
""
"O: Yet another hop forward Lager done right here from JA. Tastes alot more bitter than 50 IBU's to me though. Very hop assertive and compliments the noticeable sweetness, sure to please those looking for a quick hop fix."
""
""
"Very nice variation of a bock with an awesome taste of hops.Poured orange into a snifter, its head a nice 2 inches and lacing lasting until the end. Never one to like too many hops this IBU of 50 is just right with its amber color and maltiness, this is an exceptional lager, from the lager heads at Jack's Abby who know how to treat Munch malt to make this really, really good tasting beer - Thanks guys!"
"Pours a clear, deep, orange/amber color with a huge bubbly beige head that takes forever to recede. Smells of sweet bready caramel with a spicy, earthy, mineral edge to provide some balance. The flavor is quite sweet which threw me a bit until I noticed that the beer is named hopbock not hopback. Sweet caramel toffee and bready with a spicy earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This is a nice hoppy bock style beer I really enjoyed it."

"O: this is a nice ipa for a cold night, with just enough malt heft to balance out the hops... Another nice brew from jacks Abby."
"O: I really like this beer. Great hop aroma and flavor, rich malt backbone that holds its own, yet not palate dominating. Would make an excellent session beer. One of Jack's best offerings. This was pretty tough to classify, Rate beer says imperial pilsner, with Munich malts though I definitely consider this an amber or red. Maybe an India Red Lager? Sounds crazy but its awesome, highly recommended."
