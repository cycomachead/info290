The caramel malts, typical for this style, are roughly where they should be, and the citrus flavors balances things out. I bought this as a part of a 12-pack that has six different beers from TommyKnocker Brewery & Pub, LLC. So far, the two that I have sampled have been OK, but not exceptional, by any means. I like the two bottles per style consept versus 12-packs that have four different beers, three each. The third one seems to always end up lost somewhere in the fridge, since I like to drink my beers from a tall beer glass that can accomodate two 12oz. botlles at a time.","SouthFLBeerLover","Apr 29, 2011"

3.06,-2.9,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear amber with a decently sized head. Aromas are predominately sweet, toffeeish; notes of sugary cereal are also present. Flavors aren't bad, but they're very unbalanced. The hops come nowhere close to balancing the sweet maltiness that dominates the flavors from beginning to end. It wouldn't be so bad if only the malts were more layered and interesting, but they're pretty much one note wonders here.","droomyster","Jun 04, 2010"

Aroma a nice mix of sublte bready malts and a chalky mineral yeast character going on, not much hop zing. Flavor pretty much a weird brew up front sweetness hits with caramelized sugars and fresh bread tones with some mineral slighly metallic edges. Really not a bad flavor just a bit one dimensional, backing cluster hops come out with each sip but nothing other than to balance out the bready sweentess. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied no a watery beer definitely has some girth to it, no off flavors to be had. Carbonation is smooth and slightly creamy in texture. Drinkability overall was solid.

Mouth feel is very smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, some earthy malt comes through as well, a good hop background, some pine notes come through faintly, and a slight dryness is present in the finish.

Overall this had a somewhat clean but basic taste, and the flavor elements seemed better on their own than mixed together in this beer. It had pretty good body, and was easy enough to drink.

2.51,-20.3,3,2,2,3.5,3.5,"Very drinkable but not for the right reasons. It's so smooth and flavorless it goes down easy.","masterbruewer","Dec 23, 2003"
2.61,-17.1,4,3,2,2.5,3,"This beer wasn't terrible by any means, I was just expecting alot more. It is quite refreshing, but I personally wouldn't put it much above a good lawnmower beer.","coasterfreak75","Dec 04, 2003"
2.98,-5.4,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"The flavor is sweet malt with virtually no bittering from hops. The feel is thin, watery, and lacks snap in the finish due to the lack of carbonation. Fairly poor actually and my numbers are generous. Lack of desirable drinkability due to the unimpressive feel and lackluster taste.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 20, 2003"
3.6,14.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The Ornery Amber poured a red-orange-copper color with a fizzy head that quickly dissipated to only a collar. Has a subtle malty nose with hints of caramel. It has a pretty mild taste to it - some maltiness with a slight metallic aftertaste. There is no hop taste to speak of here. As it warmed up, I noticed more caramel flavor and maybe some subtle fruitiness. It's a pretty smooth, drinkable beer. Overall, not a bad beer but nothing to write home about.","Beaver13","Oct 01, 2003"
3.89,23.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Its clear, orangeish-copper body is capped by a thin, frothy head that drops readily to a big-bubble accented collar and leaves only spotty lace. The nose is mainly malty with a distinct note of caramel amidst its bready and lightly toasted Munich malt, with just a touch of background floral hops. The body is medium and it's fine, moderate carbonation leaves it gently crisp before warming to become slightly creamy and smooth across the palate. Everything suggested by the aroma is carried forth in the flavor with a round, gently toasted, nutty and caramelish malt that's accented by a slight floral hop flavor and a low-key bitterness. It finishes slightly sticky with malt sugars, but then dries quickly leaving the palate ready for another taste. Interestingly malty.","NeroFiddled","Sep 28, 2003"
3,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"12 oz bottle. Clever explanation of a tommyknocker on the label. Medium amber color, slightly copper. Thin white head. Not much aromas. Metallic mostly, maybe a tribute to the mining past of the area it is brewed ? Some sweet malty flavors, mostly metallic, with hints of buttery peas, yea peas. Oddly vegetable taste to finish. Slick and thin. Not much body. Not awful or undrinkable, but lots of faults show up. Maybe an bad bottle, or maybe I am becoming spoiled. That's probably it.","StevieW","Jun 30, 2003"
2.94,-6.7,4,2.5,3,3,3,"Medium amber color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied amber. Slightly roasted sweetish malts. Hops are mild and slightly spicy. Good balance. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 20, 2003"
2.75,-12.7,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Since when is being Ornery a good thing? When I think ornery, I think of the smart-ass kids you find on network TV sitcoms. I hate those kids. Luckily I will not hold the adjective against this beer. Pours a dark orangish-brown with a medium thin bone white head. Aroma of malt, caramel and maple. Medium-bodied and kind of syrupy, with flavors of caramel, malt, honey and hops. More hops would have helped this beer, as it almost OD's on the sweet/syrupy aspect. The finish is sticky too. Another forgettable beer from Tommyknocker.","Dogbrick","Jun 20, 2003"
3.4,7.9,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This brew pours a small head of fine to medium sized off-white bubbles and a transparent slightly cloudy carbonated amber body. Its aroma is that of mild malts and caramel. This brew has a mild initial caramel flavor with a bit of acidic undertones. The spices also come out to play as along with the roasted caramel notes. All of the flavors are quite mild but still tied together in a slightly complex manner. If it was stronger I'd like it even more.","TheDM","May 22, 2003"
2.67,-15.2,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"When this brew was poured into my glass it had a small off-white creamy head with fine-small bubbles that quickly diminished. The body was cloudy, thin and watery and it was light orangish in hue. There was very little lacing with this brew. There was very little character to this brew. It was just plain flat and boring.","hotstuff","May 05, 2003"
2.63,-16.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Color is a dark orange amber (duh, it's name says what it is) Poured with very little almost non existent head that disappeared very quick. Smell is a caramel malt with a hint of raisin. It's flavor is a rich sweet malt, almost thick, with only a bit of hoppiness which you don't even taste until about 10 seconds after you swallow it. It's an ok beer, nothing special though. A good beer for those who don't like a great deal of hop in their brew.","sabrills70","Apr 20, 2003"
2.68,-14.9,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a sort of funky dark orange-amber color, topped by a thin, off-white head. The head quickly fades to a thin ring of foam. The aroma has a similar funk to it, becuase it has a familiar smell to it, but I'd swear it is decomposing grass clippings or wet hay. Maybe it's that smell from a bottle of vitamins. Whatever it is, it's not disgusting, just out of place. Theres a decent malt component to the smell as well. Ok, the taste has a vitmain, medicinal, metallic note as well. Maybe this is Vita-Beer? I even get the vitamin aftertaste. After a few sips, the taste gets a bit sweeter, with a touch of bitterness at the end. Aftertatse is a touch of citrus. Grainy, gritty mouthfeel. Drinkability a little less than average. Most lagers have a lot less aftertaste and a cleaner nose. Glad there's only one.","aaronh","Nov 01, 2002"
3.03,-3.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Crystal clear dark copper hue. Thin, spotty, soapy head manages muddled, loose lace. Light caramel and gently toasted malt in aroma, with a slight tinge of herbal hops. Clean, but prosaic aromawise. Non descript caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by grainy, mildly nutty Vienna malt and mild hop bitterness. Faintly floral hop flavor. Hints of toffee and toast emerge late, adding token depth. Hop bitterness is too understated to offset the prominent caramel malt presence, lending balance well skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied, passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes with a bready sweetness yielding to a slight tartness akin to an unhopped yeast starter. Ornery Amber is a decent brew without outright flaw, but without noteable character either. Quaff and move on.","marc77","Oct 17, 2002"
2.82,-10.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Hmmmmm.  A beer that pours no head.  Interesting.  Scarlet red in color.  Slightly chill hazed.  Some sweet malt on the nose and faint hops.  And a little mustiness as well.  Taste is more of the same.  Subtle sweet malt with traces of chocolate malt as well.  And the mustiness as well.  Body is decent. About medium-full.  Nothing horrible here, but on the flipside, nothing good either.  I thought I was getting an Ornery Amber ale and instead I got an Ordinary Amber ale.","Bighuge","Aug 30, 2002"
3.1,-1.6,3,3,3.5,2,3,"Should be called ""Ordinary"" Amber...Flavor isn't bad...has a sweet, malty taste and I get some caramel tones to it...the nose light but has some malt notes...body is flat and this holds this down from a very slightly above average beer to a slightly below average beer...also, just a tich too sweet on the finish....not much for hops on this one..","ZAP","Dec 16, 2001"
3.13,-0.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This Colorado mountain brew pours a light orange-amber color with almost no head retention.  The aroma is bready with a bit of malt and a hint of hop spice.  The body is light and the flavor is quite malty with a lingering hop spiciness.  In a bottle this is an average amber, it seems that the brewer is still playing with a melded flavor profile.","beernut7","Beers"
2.86,-9.2,3,2,3,4,3,"it poured practically no head and has little aroma to excite the senses.  A  medium body with tamed roasted caramel malts and dry crisp finish left me thinking that this was brewed not to offend anyone.  not great, not bad.","budgood1","0"
