3.8,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Sampled on tap at an Irish pub in Calgary. This brew arrived in a pint glass, a really nice russet bronze color, veering towards red, fizzy and with billowing white foam that retained its form quite well. Aroma all ""grape and grain", some nice floral aromatics, sweet malts, hints of toast and sour fruit. Palate amazingly complex and well-rounded, with malts and hops synching up near-perfectly, with neither component running the show nor hiding in the shadows. Mellow biscuit and caramel malts backstop a tobacco and iris perfume, melon rind (German hops!), rhubarb, baby aspirin, a little red berry and a healthy dose of bitter citrus pith to fuel a crisp dry finish. Grainy and toasty but manages to retain some sweet and tangy complexity as well. Difficult to find flaws in this well-crafted brew and this could be a top amber/red lager choice for me in the future. Are we sure this is brewed in Ontario??? I kid, I kid. Creemore is a top-tier lager brewery and this is their flagship for a reason. Was good enough to distract me from the fights.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 17, 2013"

It's hard to describe, but there's an 'off' emptiness in the flavour that takes this beer down a notch from Brooklyn Lager (the natural comparison).

Maybe some faint malt. I could be lieing though. Now, on to the taste. Ok, some toasty malt, not much, and it dissapears quickly, but it was there. Has a slight bitter hoppy finish as well. Light bodies with medium carbonation. Very clean finish. Nothing great here, but nothing offensive.","dherling","Apr 17, 2007"

Nose is grains and corn, not the best but it smells like a lager. Taste is similar to the nose, a musty grain/corn blend with slight hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is average or just below.

3.11,-18.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Taste is just plain awkward. I think I know what they're trying to do with this one, and the hop presence scores it some points, but the malt is nearly non-existent, unless that sour adjuncty soapiness is supposed to be it. Mouth is sticky with a zippy carbonation, dry. This is drinkable and more unique than a lot of lagers out there, but in my opinion it's pretty poorly executed. Unfortunate.","trevorwideman","Jul 03, 2006"

Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of rich roasted caramel malts and wheaty grains mixed with a touch of wood. Nice. Taste is well rounded and very enjoyable; caramel malts, light wood notes, smooth rich grain, a touch of earth, the slightest nip of hops. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but not overly carbonated (almost not enough carbonation, honestly). Drinkability is north of average. A well made lager. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Jul 02, 2006"

Taste is malty with some nice bready notes and some husky frito-lay grain notes as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and semi-dry. Finish is corny, and adjunct flavored. If this is all malt, i'm a bit confused. Drinkability remains decent. A Canadian standard if nothing else, but to me it tastes like an American macro...","francisweizen","Jul 22, 2005"

Taste is a little sweet, malty, bitterness in the finish, a little spicy as well. Very smooth beer, not as carbonated as most lagers so it goes down easily. One of the best beers made in Ontario, if not Canada, very good lager and takes away the bite of a hot summer day.","Viggo","May 29, 2005"

4.07,6.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours out of its 500 ml brown bottle a deep ruddy golden colour, very little carbonation, and only a splash of fizz for a head. So this is what it actually looks like! (I wouldn't know from past experience...) The aroma possesses a clean sweet and biscuity malt profile, with light floral and herbal hops. I can even pick up slight caramel as well. Well-balanced and rounded flavour, the malt and hops act in unison, mild grains and some toasted malt cheek-to-cheek with the crisp flowery hops. Very refreshing stuff. The mouthfeel is light to sip, but has a decent body when rolled across the palate. If I lived in Ontario this stuff would be my old reliable, there would always be at least one bottle of this stuff in my fridge. I used to look back fondly about this stuff, and it is good to know that it's still the great beer I remember it as. My favorite Canadian lager along with Yukon Brewing's Chilkoot.","IronDjinn","Aug 11, 2004"

Mix of juicy fruit, floral hops, and a touch of malty sweetness. Flavor is up-front sweet and is mixed nicely by hoppy influence. Finish is dry. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. I was quite pleasantly surprised at this, given my recent run-ins with the Molson offerings that I'd tried whilst in Canada. Great summer beer. I'd gladly drink more of this.","OldFrothingSlosh","Aug 01, 2004"

Crisp, clean mouthfeel that is very suitable for this beer. Light bodied and simple. Drinkable, yeah. It's got enough taste to be drinkable, without the complexity to make it amazing.

4.58,19.9,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"so the review- the color of this beer is exceptional, wonderful amber bronze color a clarity and wispy full white head that speaks of good clear canadian water. Even in a bottle a bit aged, the head stands up well. Aroma strongly of fresh-baked bread with a hint of alchohol. this fresh-baked bread taste permeates the drinkability. Straightforward, strong flavor of malt, flavor starts clear and strong and finshes with a full mouthfeel with a hint of sweetness. the fresh falvor asserts itself but fades gradually through the sip(or gulp), leaving a a clean sensation at the finish. Pure, unadulturated Canadian quality in a glass. highly recommended for all levels of beer drinking appreciation. worth hunting for if you can find some, best recommendation is to visit T.O. Ontario. either way its win-win for me, as your loss is my gain and my pleasure again and again. This is truly a sublime beer.","sublimesipping","May 04, 2004"

This is possibly the best lager Ive tried yet.","CAMRAhardliner","May 01, 2004"
