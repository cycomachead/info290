Anyway, if this is medium-bodied, it pushes towards the light interpretation of medium. It would have been a better brew if it had more body to it. As it is, it is a basic, easy-drinking amber lager.

Toes the line dangerously close to the adjunct style with its spent grain bill and corn sweetness. Still, it succeeds in being light and refreshing, with just enough caramel and malt complexity to keep it interesting, as well. Reminds me a bit of Yuengling and I imagine this is a popular choice in Wisconsin for both the craft enthusiast caught in a non-craft setting and for the BA-in-training trying to graduate from the adjunct swill currently pedaled in Wisconsin.

The smell is pretty straight forward, bready malty sweetness, a little bit of caramel, and a faint amount of citrus. Tastes mainly bready and malty, caramel, and a little copper/metallic flavor. The caramel sweetness really come out as the beer warms up, tastes much better at 50-60 degrees. This finishes rather clean, fairly standard bodied beer here.

This beer pours a decent deeper copper color with a good firm looking white foam head. This beer smells of orange citrus hops upfront which are quickly swallowed by a balance of caramel and clove, i also think I detected some egg and cinnamon. Though the picture I painted for the aroma may seem tasty, I just don't think it meshed well and seemed unbalanced. After smelling the aromas I was intrigued as to what this beer would taste like, the answer was "not much". That having been said there is a malty taste in the foreground that is washed away by what is seemingly no real flavor at all just vague light beer-ness, and it's all finished off with an off-putting bitterness that seems not really to be appropriate with the flavors involved. This beer is a little too watery for my liking as well though it does have some nice carbonation.

Christal clear copper with about three inches of off white head that hangs around in the pint glass pretty much the whole time. The smell kind of reminds of biscuits or home made bread, with a good dose cf sweet caremel malts. You can tell there are a fair amount hops hanging around in there. It tases more or less how it smells. Dry, biscuity up front, sweetens up with a little roasty malt presence and then a little bitter after taste from the hops. This is good.

The malt is about the only major player here, but it has a wonderful complex value to the malt that I don't think my palate is good enough to pick out.

"Malted caramel" seems to be mentioned a lot in these reviews, and I certainly agree that is the overall defining characteristic of this tastey brew.

Some hop bitter Im not familiar with, but which I will describe as dry and woody. There is fizz on my tongue and the caramel hangs on the roof of my mouth, persisting deep into the aftertaste.

Lightly toasted Vienna malt, mild caramel, smooth graininess and an herbal Hallertauer hop nose.  Refined, somewhat understated aromawise.  Mild hop bitterness upfront yields to biscuit notes and light nuttiness.  Sweetness is of a light caramel malt nature and couples with the biscuit notes to form a pleasant mild toffee undertone.  Subdued herbal hop flavor.  Lightly bodied, but with sufficient dextrins to prevent overall weakness.  Finishes, dry, clean, and perhaps a touch bland.  Wisconsin Amber is a well balanced, very drinkable, but somewhat uninspired example of style.
