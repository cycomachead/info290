"Brown coloration medium carbonation.  Taste and smells of artificial caramel flavoring. Doesn't blow me away"
"Schell's Dark pours a clear amber color with a nice size lacing head.  There is a weak aroma, some roasted malts.  The taste is light, nice noticeable roasted malt flavor.  Weak body, a little flat.  Overall its not great, nothing special, but it is a decent beer."

"Pours a reddish-mahogany in color with about a 1-finger foamy off-white head that settles down to a thin layering on top. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of yeast and sweet caramel malts. Pretty much is the same for the taste with a slightly sour finish but didn't last. Lighter to medium bodied. Overall, it wasn't a bad brew."

"Overall - this is a good beer. I would order it in a pub and drink it again if Nordeast was not available. Not quite as good as a Nordeast but a good 2nd. Schell has done another great job!"

"I usually steer clear of dark beers and resisted trying Schell's Dark. I often associated dark beers with being bitter and filling. This was not the case. I loved there was very little bitterness. A very refreshing beer, light malt with a great aftertaste. Not a lot of carbonation though. With some types beers I have one and I am done. I will usually have one after work and one with dinner. Goes great with meat and potatoes."

"This beer seems to be a bit light tasting for a dark, was hoping it would have more and richer tastes, although the taste that it has isn't bad, just lighter than I was thinking I would get with a Dark."

"O- A nice alternative to american adjunct lagers, but really nothing special, there is very little to recommend or criticize with this beer. Probably could use a bit more body and head."
"Thanks to fLax for this one!"

"Final Thoughts: Even though there's not much in the aroma or taste departments, this isn't a bad beer. It's highly drinkable and there are no off flavors."

"Unremarkable, definitely not my favorite Schell's."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while, but there are better beers in the style."

"Overall nice beer to grab a 6 pack of for a fishing trip. It wouldn't make it to one of my beer parties though."

"Overall - At first I didn't think I was going to like this beer because it's dark, but I was mistaken. It's pretty good."

"Part One of my six-part intro to Schell's regular boys. It pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises light caramel, light grass, and a touch of rather mild roast. The taste brings in more of the same, though things are a bit stronger all-around, and a small bit o' coffee finds its way in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice little brew, one that was somehow surprisingly enjoyable (something about a MDL in a clear bottle just advertizes itself in the wrong way to me...), something I could see drinking plenty of if presented with the proper circumstance."

"brown with a smallish off white head, that slowly faded to reveal a decent layer of lace left on the top, as well as a good amount left down the sides of the glass. Some visible carbonation was evident through the chains of bubbles streaming up through the very clear beer. Smell was very unique. It had a nice burnt sort of smell with a definate hint of caramel and coffe, which really suprised me. It was so pronounced, almost like a porter type of hint in there. The taste was very similar, lots of coffee and caramel flavors, mixed in with a nice earthy grain and a slightly bitter hopped back"

"Light to medium bodied, smooth, with average carbonation. This is a dark lager done right. I have had this before many times. Not sure why it took so long for me to review."
"Serving type: bottle"

"O - This is not a life changing Munich Dunkel, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. It manages to balance out some richer flavors with a solid quaff-ability, at a decent price."
"Overall: A decent lighter lager. Flavors are very subtle but this brew isn't watery at all."
"Overall impression: It isn't bad .. it is sort of a generic beer with a bit more flavor than your average macro .. sort of like a Yuengling. Nothing to write home about, but it's drinkable enough."
"Looks deep brown, reddish around the fringes, small head that doesn't last, vague smell of semi-toasted caramel malt, taste is pretty much exactly the same, slightly too thin a body for my liking, but other than that, it's pretty good. Sadly lacking in complexity, yes, but it is certainly not 'bad', either."
"Another from the sampler, though I've had plenty of this on tap this summer as my teammates love this stuff. I'm not as big a fan of it, but it is a solid dunkel lager and a good changeup from lighter lagers."
"Nothing spectacular here, but it beats the hell out of any of the grainbelt line. If stuck in airport waiting for a delayed SWA flight, I'd probably order this again."
"O- It looks great but it only tastes so-so. Easy enough drinking but otherwise it's a pass for me."
"Overall: A great looking beer that is sadly lacking in smell and taste. Would not recommend to try. Go for Schell's pils instead."
"Taste of honey. Very sweet. Too sweet to be a session beer but perfectly willing to enjoy one if handed to me."
"O: this is a great starter beer. made by a great brewery."
"Overall: Good for hydration. Not unpleasant, but what flavor there is, is very, very mild. Watery."
"Sustained Taste: A beer you can rely on for comfort at the end of a grueling day. Extremely consistent from first-taste to swallow to after-taste. A genuine pleasure from start to finish."
"O - Schell's brews many better beers than Dark, but it is a decent lager."
"This brew is quite quaffable as it is tasty and medium bodied. Great alternative brew to session with. If only the taste was a tad richer, we'd have a real winner."
"Poured to a big 3 fingered head with big bubbles. Head was a light brown in color. Left a little lacing but not much. Brew itself was a dark brown in color. Smelled slightly sweet. Also of burnt malt. Nothing was really over whelming as far as smell goes. Very light in odor. Taste was light also. Slightly sweet with caramel and malt. Not a lot of flavor going on either. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was good. I guess im not use to having a dark beer this light in flavor and odor. Overall I dont think Id buy again. Maybe at 4.8 alcohol this is going to be a light dark beer. No pun intended."
"Smooth, rich and somewhat complex, I found this Munich Dunkel Lager particularly refreshing. Excellent drinkability."
"Overall- Not a bad beer, but certainly not my favorite from this wonderful Minnesota brewery."
"Schell's Dark was dark amber in color with good clarity. It had a rocky beige head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was toasted malt. The taste was toasted malt with a touch of hop flavor, some fruitiness and dry finish. The mouthfeel was average with a medium-light body and medium carbonation. The drinkability was just above aveage. This is an average Dunkel Lager."
"Pours from a clear bottle, labeling and bottle together bring out a retro feel to the product. Pours a dark copper ruby brown hue with a nice creamy tan head quickly dwindling. Aroma has hints of grainy malts, a touch of caramel and tart fruit in there as well. Flavor wise roasty malts/husky graininess/fruits with apple/raisin coming through with a touch of a grassy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit rough around the edges but a light to medium bodied lager from New Alt Minnesota is a welcome addition to the beers I've tried. This is nowhere near Penn Dark was it's hayday, but it's a decent drinkable beer."
"Altogether no Schell's best product but still very quaffable. Looking forward to reviewing more Schell's in the future (i.e. Hopfenmalz, Shmaltz's Alt, Caramel Bock, Firebrick, etc.)"
"D: Very drinkable, i enjoy the malts in this one, it makes it creamy and smooth. It is a lager, so the flavors aren't strong or bold, but they are still there (not saying EVERY lager is mild). This is one of my favorite go-to beers, an excellent session beer."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is husky and sweet with equal amounts of roasted and chocolate maltiness. Light hopping comes in to clean up the finish. It is unfortunate there are not many American brewed dunkels, as it makes for a flavorful session beer that is easy and fun to drink. This one is a little thin on the palate and lacks a certain smoothness found in the best of the style. Still though, I enjoyed this beer and would happily buy a sixer every now and again."
"From a sampler pack. Since Miller and Anheuser still control the distributors and retailers here this good stuff has to fight for space. I could drink a lot of this. I am pretty new here and very unprofessional. That said, what I do not understand is the biases of other reviewers. Rules are... do not criticize your fellow reviewers. But, I gotta say .. Art is in the eye of the beholder. I rated this beer high BEFORE I read anybody elses reviews and after I rated it high and reviewed the balance of the thread, I had second thoughts until I started reading comparisons to some beers that would be skipped if I had some of this stuff around. I do every much like this beer. Anyway..this is above average..darn good beer leaving a fresh after taste. Slightly fruity I guess. You certainly aren't even tempted to add a lemon."
"From a six-pack sampler bought in Minnesota. Appearance is a dark shade of amber, somewhat small head and very little lacing. Smell of grain and caramel while the taste is similar with an interesting sweetness at the end that entices another sip. Mouthfeel is not quite chewy but not thin either. Kind of wish I had more than just this bottle. Very good beer that can't be found out here."
"Not too bad. I kind of like it actually. Nothing outstanding but worth more than the low scores I see here."
"D: Could put a few of these down but the offputting flavors are a little too prominent for prolonged drinking."
"Not sure what the logic is, but it comes in a clear bottle. Clear cola-colored body, small cream colored head. Some lace. Scent is a mild lagered-caramel malt. Same idea with the taste, caramel and chocolate tones, lagered smooth taste. Just a touch of hop bitterness, but its blended enough that its hard to notice. Somewhat acidic, but finishes with a creamy feel. Nothing particularly wrong or anything with this one, but its not overwhelming. Not bad"
"SkÅL!"
"This is the first beer from Schell that really disappointed me, but having this after their stout is a tough act to follow."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of grain, yeast, slight sweet malt, pale malt, hint of hop, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, yeast, slight pale malt, slight hop, slight sweet malt, and slight roasted malt. Overall, a good blend, body, and aroma."
"Purchased from 3 Corners Liquor in Medford, MN. Pours a dark amber body with lots of rising bubbles, which makes it look like Coca Cola. Aroma is of sweet malts and no hops at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavors of toasted malt and toffee sweetness. There's a very faint hop flavor in the overall sweet finish. There's nothing special here."
"A very underrated beer, though not aesthetically pleasing enough for a huge rating. For those of you that rated this poorly, take another look, with an open mind and warmed slightly."
"Maybe this is Schell's answer to Shiner Bock, a limp and light beer that's a teeny bit more flavorful than your usual macro flagships. People can drink it and feel fancy, since it's a dark. Well, regardless, it's not bad, certainly, and it's actually probably a step up from Shiner and other bland attempts at craft beer."
"Light-to-medium bodied with a lager smoothness, this is an ""easy-drinking"" brew with a fair amount of complexity for the style. A nice caramel/nutty/roasty balance. A fine choice for a dark ""sessionable"" lager!"
"M/D - A pretty decent brew. A liked the smoothness and the pretty sessionable quality. Nothing too strong, very enjoyable. I recommend at least trying this brew. I will purchase again!"
"D - Very drinkable - flavors are very light. ABV is very light. Overall, just not an ""in your face"" beer. Not filling."
"This beer is decent, but I probably wouldn't ever get it again."
"Poured from the clear bottle (scary) into a pint glass, beer is deep amber brown with a nice cap of cream colored head. The nose is sweet with lightly toasted malt and almost takes on a sweet fruitiness that I wasn't expecting. The flavor touts a similar fruitiness but it is subdued compared to the nose, other than that caramel, molasses and just a touch of hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is on the watery side with the carbonation not helping matters in that it is almost non-existent. Overall, drinkable but drinkable like BMC beer... Not what I would think of a Munich Dunkel Lager to be like. I suppose given the choice between this and BMC, this would win but not by much."
"Light, yet the flavours keep it fairly interesting. Decent beer, yet nothing to seek out."
"#4 of 6 from the sampler pack. I have not been disappointed so far. Schell's may become a regular member of my fridge."
"this beer finishes out with a soft sweetness and med-light body. i must say it was better than i had expected/remebered and is something that goes down pretty easy but nothing too special over all."
"D - This jumped way up in quality with the first sip. The nose is almost absent and the head is a bit lacking but it's a delish beer overall that I could put a few, if not more, down of. The clear bottle needs to go though."
"If you are a malt head you could drink this all day long, period."
"D= good. I was scared of the clear bottle and the fact that it was just called dark.... but it wasn't that bad. Really sort of deceptive in color and smell. Tasted plain and somewhat boring but not bad at all."
"I just wanted so bad to rate this beer higher, but just can't. I love Schell's beers and a trip to the brewery is a treat unto itself. But for some reason this one just doesn't make it. The color is weak, the aroma just ain't there, the flavor leaves something to be desired. Good thing this was a $8.00/12pk"
"D: Easily the worst of the 6 options from this sampler due to its sweet corn graininess and artificial caramel type of flavor."
"i would never buy this beer again - god thing it came in a sample sixer"
"Schell should make a real Dunkel, this is an American Dark Lager."
"D-A decent, sessionable brew. Tasty, but I guess it's not a better-than-average brew. I've always enjoyed Schell's Dark, and this brew has been the forefront of a recent (last several years) re-branding of some of the Schell's brang and beers, probably due to its ease of drinking and accessibility."
"Conclusion: So-so...nothing special"
"Solid brew for a clear bottle. Very much the sessionable beer at 4.8%"
"D: The light body and low ABV make this an easy beer to consume. It's not terribly complex, but still decent."
"This is a very easy drinking beer, but I'm left wanting more during the entire glass-- more aroma, more flavor, more body."
"Pours a dark copper color with a large off-white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick, dense cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of rich malt, slightly earthy. Hints of noble hops as well. Nice flavor of Munich malt, slightly toasted and musty. The sweetness of the malt is nicely kept in check by the hops. Bitterness is moderate for the style. The body comes off as a little thin considering the richness of the malt. A little overcarbonated as well. A nice dunkel lager that is very drinkable. As good as many of the German imports."
"Drinkability - Surprisingly light and refreshing for a dark beer with dark roasted barley. Easy to drink, would definitely have another if it was around."
"Not sure how this beer is rated so low, it's a very good Dunkel. Like everything else I've had from Schell's, it's very good."
"Overall, a very easy drinking 'dark' lager. Looks dark, tastes fairly light. I could have a few of these during a session."
"This is a drinkable brew and worth the try. Sessionable."
"Would be a great one for craft beer nubies I think. Not overpowering in any way."
"Mouthfeel: Light and smooth. A real easy drinking beer. Not a great beer, but it's something I would suggest to a new craft beer drinker."
"Overall this beer is pretty good. It's not great in any aspect, but it's easy drinking and has some decent flavor. My wife loves this stuff and is not a beer drinker. It's very similar to a Newcastle in my opinion. More of a nut brown than a dunkel."
"Not bad, not bad at all. The aroma reminds me of their newest Snowstorm recipe (the taste does not however). I most likely wont go out of my way to buy this again, but if I have no other options, this would definitely be a winner."
"D - I rated this based on the Dark American Lager style, as I believe this was the brewery's intent based on the packaging. For BA purposes, this would probably fall into the Dark Euro Lager category. Nonetheless, it is extremely well crafted and should be recognized as such (I think). It's a very clean lager and extremely 'quaffable'. It kind of reminds me of my memories of Lowenbrau back in the day."
"Overall it was fine for a cheap $2 on-tap drink but I can't see myself ever seeking it out to but. It's crisp with a decent amount of carbonation but the lack of flavor didn't make me care if I finished my drink or not."
"Dark brown color, cream colored head of an inch of foam. Smell of toasted caramel, nice aroma. Solid flavor, dark malt, a bit nutty, nice floral hop finish. Good body, not too heavy, smooth, great sessional. Doesn't get super high marks, but was one of my favorites on the day. I would definatley have another if it was available."
"This isn't a porter or stout. This is just a darker beer done right. Who cares what it smells like, or what flower it tastes like....Let's be honest...this is a good tasting beer that happens to come from the 2nd oldest family brewerys in the USA. Please don't get all girly on us. If you want a good tasting beer that will go down smooth and would make a great addition to deer hunting camp, then this it the beer for you. HELLO!!!"
"The beer's classification on this site is Munich Dunkel, while the bottle proclaims it an American dark lager. I suspect it would not hold up well at all if reviews held it to the standard of either of these styles."
"D- This beer surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect so it really impressed me. the sweetness can sometime be a little cloying making it a bit less sessionable."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is two inches in height, frothy, and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, nuts, and roasted malt. The taste is considerably lighter than the aroma. There are is still some nutty caramel, but it is rather faint. The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, this would be a very good beer if the taste lived up to the aroma. As it is an average beer."
"D - Not terrible, but a sub-average brew. I don't like this very much, and it's a bad example of an already uninteresting style."
"M/D - A little weak on the feel. Not a bad beer but nothing spectacular either."
"Yeah, it's not a great dunkel, but it's a nice, standard American interpretation for the most part. It appears a dark brown with light tan lacing. The aroma has a hint of DMS with sweet grains. The flavor is pretty subtle with an initial sweet bready rush followed by a gentle chocolate note. The DMS is distracting, but not surprising. Not a bad beer."
"After drinking mainly dark beers and stouts since I started throwing down and subsequently enjoying the brew, I wanted to find a dark beer that was satisfying but not filling. I found this in Schell Dark. When I bought my first case of Schell Dark, it was in a colorful package calling to mind the region it was born, but not in an overtly exploitative manner. The bottle is clear with a colorful wrap, the contents are a dark caramel color. The smell is sweet, with a nice barley aroma. For a dark beer, I was expecting more of a bite, but there was very little bitterness. There was a medium amount of carbonation. The beer went down smooth and it would be good as a session beverage."
"The clear bottle scared me...the previous two Schell's I've had didn't psych me up...the label reminded me way too much of a Hamm's or Schlitz thing. All that hesitation doesn't help what is basically your average brown ale...err, I mean Munich Dunkel Lager. Whatever you call it, it's severely average."
"overall this beer isnt too bad actually it was very enjoyable"
"D - This is a pretty good beer. Not the best from August Schell, but it makes for a decent session beer."
"Originally reviewed on September 24, 2005. Poured from a 12 Oz Bottle on the Beer Train. Deep reddish pour. Dusty malt aroma, with no character. Flavor continues, Im detecting a pattern here with these guys. Definately some corn flavor. Watery. Blah. Admitting you use corn to build a dunkel is a horrible, horrible thing to do. On par with swill."
"Amber/brown in color with a low medium head. The smell is generic caramel malt. Taste is caramel and roasted malts, with a distinct absense of hops, and kinda funky sulphury aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the high side of medium and carbonation is average. Overall, I can't really say I was a fan."
"Poured a reddish-brown color with slightly off-white head. Smell is very attractive with strong roasted malt notes combined with nice caramel. Taste fails to live up to the smell, buth is still rather enjoyable. Finished a bit thin, but refreshing. Could be a pleasant session beer."
"D- This beer didn't have a lot of flavor and the flavors it did have were a little off. It would be nice to taste some other malt flavors like maybe some Munich malt or other lightly toasted malts."
"Opens with a malty, earth smell. Pours a nice amber with a fluffy. Taste has a malty richness and is nice and bubbly, but there were some distracting off-flavors. A bit of oxidation and a medicinal phenol character overwhelms the light hop profile. I think if I had another sample, it should turn out pretty good."
"Clear brown-amber with a small, off-white head. Cereal sweet malts. Toasted, caramel, and nuts. Minor adjunct taste. Sweetish toasted malts. Not that bad though. Slight vegetal hop finish, but more adjuncty malt sweetness in the end. Light bodied, mass lager feel. A better choice than Michelob Amberbock"
"The body is really lacking. Overall this is very limited beer with not much to it."
"Drinkability and Overall: Although this was a completely average beer for the most part, it's drinkability is very high I think. It left me wanting another, even though the first one wasn't all that enjoyable..."
"I found an interesting quote on the Schell website regarding Dark: ""The perfect beer for people who want a specialty craft beer, but may not want all the flavor and heaviness"". Playing into the 'flavor is a bad thing' mindset is inexcusable for a brewery that expects to be taken seriously. Schell Dark is light years away from Schell Pale Ale. So much so that it's hard to believe that the same brewery is responsible for both beers."
"Drinkability is about the same as any American Macro, you could drink it on a hot day, but would never go out of your way to get it."
"Not a great brew here, best to stick with Schell's Craft selections. But if this was on tap at some pizza parlor, I'd go for it."
"Think root beer in appearance. That's exactly what it looked like when poured. Head, color -- Root beer. It didn't smell like root beer, though - -it didn't smell much as all. Just a light musty aroma. When it came to the mouthfeel, however, we were back to root beer again -- the consistency, carbonation -- it all had me rechecking the bottle to make sure that I didn't accidentally grab a (say it with me) root beer. The taste (thankfully) wasn't root beer -- it was more of a watery nothing that quickly disappeared altogether. All of this makes for a brew that you could easily throw back a lot of, if you had nothing better to drink or were interested in being neither offended nor impressed. The whole experience left me kind of -- ho hum, whatever."
"A distaser."
"And Gramps would be proud of me."
"Color is a clear orangish cherrywood color, it could be darker with more brown, pours out to a medium beige head that fades quickly, no real lace sticking. Aroma is quite sweet and fruity with dullish apple and pear, a malty nose, touches of dry nuttyness, but it has a bit of a souring smell and reminds of flat white wine or something. Interestingly off. Taste comes across quite thin and far to sweet, malts are in flavorful amounts but not in a good way by any means, very light and twingy with a watery mix of white wine fruityness and dulled crispness. Feel is watery and thin, characterless and boring. Boy, a disappointing beer at best. I so want to support Schell's other brews other then the FireBrick and Pale, but it just ain't happening."
"Is a light burgundy color, with a little pure-white head. Smells malty and a little roasted. Tastes like a dark lager should. It has the smooth flavor of a lager, with a little bit of carmel and nut flavor. This was not expected in the sampler pack, I was expecting the Schmaltz's Alt, but this will do."
"Almost undrinkable. Sorry, Schell."
"Drinkability??? Sorry, the very watered down flavor and mouthfeel has me dissapointed....Not a real good dunkel....usually this brewery is very good but this must be one of their ""dumbed down"" beers for the masses...."
"This beer is a dark lager, but is the color of an IPA, not a dark beer such as a porter. Nice head with some retention. Nose contains hints of malt, slight chocoate and caramel. The taste is smooth. Some roasted notes mingle here and there with the clean maltiness. Overall, not too bad. A little thin, but highly drinkable. I'd take this anyday over Michelob Dark. This is the kind of dark beer you could suck a case down all day say if you're in an Ice Shack or something."
"Pours out to an amber, not necessarily dark color in the glass. As with the other Schell offerings, this one has a very slight head. Little to no aroma other than fairly light malt. Taste is predominantly that of malt with a slight sweetness. Comparible to Michelob Amber bock crossed with a Killian's Red. Average at best."
"clear medium brown in color. little head and no lace. aroma of the slightest dark roasted malt with a bit of earthy hops. tastes pretty crisp; like a regular lager but with dark malts. a nice hop finish. this beer is pretty boring but the fact it's clean, crisp and refreshing redeems itself. a nice change up from the regular macro-crap that's out there. i would buy and drink more of this if it were readily available in my area. a quality beer from a small regional brewery that is well-known for their german-style lagers."
"Clear dark tea-like brown, OK head that's down to a rim-clinging rim in 40 seconds. Slightly chocolate aroma. Mostly malty but pretty non-descript. A little bit of a nut flavor but not much. Some light brown sugar predominates, very little sense of hops at the finish. This is really ordinary in all aspects, not a beer I would choose to purchase on my own. Maybe a starter for people who like Michelob Dark. The bottle was a part of a sampler pack I got in order to try this year's Snow Storm rendition."
"I'd score it real high compared to my choices, but this is the best I can do."
