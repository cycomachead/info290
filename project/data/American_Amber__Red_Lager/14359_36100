Aroma was mild with some malt notes. Taste had caramel and toffee notes with a smoky and slightly bitter finish. Medium mouth feel with a dry and mild / bitter aftertaste.","Huffs","Nov 02, 2013"

3.17,-11.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"O- Overall a good beer, not a great beer. It has strong points but one glaring week point which is the carbonation. I've had this beer a number of times and I'm always perplexed how it's a bit flat. I got my growler filled and brought it back because I thought I got a bad batch. The bartender poured it out, took a taste and said ""Tastes right to me."" He then filled up another growler and gave it to me, which I quickly took home...same thing, I just can't understand it.","patriot76","Aug 14, 2012"

4.13,15.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - I really enjoyed this beer, not sure why it got a B, but it definitely deserves a higher mark; maybe this beer should only be tasted from a tap or growler, but its really good","ferrari29","Aug 11, 2011"
3.31,-7.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O: The beer isnâ€™t overly difficult to drink, but could use more malts and hops to create stronger aromas and flavors.","metter98","Apr 15, 2011"
3.41,-4.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting tasting Lager. Not a huge fan of Lager's anymore -- it's weird considering, Yuengling Lager and Miller Lite are the beers that got me into beer. Muddy Creek is certainly not horrible. I think this would be a good gateway for someone trying to get into beer, in general.","9InchNails","Mar 12, 2011"

3.68,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Had a pint at the Hop Devil Grill in NYC for $6.50. It appeared clear light brown with a short off-white head. This beer immediately reminded me of Sam Adam's Boston Lager, but it's a bit lighter. There's a mix of herbal and citrus hop flavors while the malts bring a mild chocolate cookie taste. All in all, it's a pretty tasty session beer. I wouldn't mind having a few.","tempest","Jun 23, 2009"

3.63,1.4,3.5,3,4,3,4,"This poured a very dark brown out of my growler; ironically enough, like a muddy creek! It had a small white head with fast retention and decent lacing, nothing too overwhelming. The smell was very malty and earthy, almost like old beer. While this may seem unappetizing, it had me intrigued since I respect and admire the reputation adn brewing style of this brewery. The taste did not disappoint; again, an earthy, ""muddy"" taste was very evident. The mouthfeel was not typical of this brewery, which kind of caught me by surprise. It was alittle thinner than what I've been accustomed too from Defiant. Overall, a nice and smooth, easy going beer that's easy to drink.","maddogruss","Beers"
2.62,-26.8,4,2,3,3,2,"I received a corked and caged bottle from a trade with a ratebeerian. This thing had a lot of carbonation! The head took a while to settle down. The color was a ruddy brown. The smell was stinky, like a muddy creek. The taste was a standard lager taste to me. Decent beer but i couldn't get past the smell.","ArrogantB","0"
