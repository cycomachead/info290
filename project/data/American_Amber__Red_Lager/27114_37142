3.49,-4.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice fruity presence but the mouthfeel is a bit too flat for my liking.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 07, 2013"

Standard lager nose. Palate was malt galore, toasty bread sticks and some citrus pith. Nice hops to balance the malt with little discernable sweetness. Hops are a bit peppery, vegetal/herbal, perhaps a hint of rhubarb sourness. A metallic ting in the finish. I am an ale drinker by preference but this sort of malty, hoppy lager makes a nice change of pace. Could be a bit sweeter.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 26, 2013"

The beer has some hoppy character to it, I can smell it all over the nose. its very aromatic imo. The taste was mirror to the smell and I felt a rush of hops about halfway and up to the finish. Also I get some toasty bread in the their up front and continues in the background of the mouthful. I feel like I'm drinking a pale ale, which obviously this is an amber ale. I'd give the hop character similar or a little stronger to that of a sierra nevada. It definetly stays on my pallet for a while. This isn't to take away from the beer, although I think I prefer the hops taste to take a more conservative role in a beer.

And it tasted more like a pale ale or IPA. When I looked at the list of ingredients online, I understood better - they've thrown a wild variety of malts and yeast into this one. Here's yet another beer where the artwork let's you know what you're in for - a flavor carnival. Classic? Maybe not - perhaps there's a little too much going on here, but the mix of full body, moderate sweetness, and the hopped-up finish makes it enjoyable.

The aroma is very weak but some wheaty malt floats out that is pleasant. The flavor comes on with lots more creamy malt and a nice little herbal/pine hop kiss. Surprisingly tastey, medium bodied for the style, finely carbonated and very drinkable. It's smooth and a bit creamy for a lager. Sweet malt is the theme here, and what a nice version of a lager.

4.08,11.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Aroma is strong and malty with just a whisper of fruit - banana on second examination. Color is a dark honey-amber, not like your typical lager, and with a nice thick off-white head that sticks around for a bit. Flavor is smooth, malty with a fair amount of hoppy bitterness and a trace of fruit. Hop flavor dominates the aftertaste. This is rather different from what I expect when drinking a lager.","Cyberkedi","Jun 18, 2008"
3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pilsener glass. Light amber with lots of bubble columns. The aroma showcases an unusual hoppiness for a lager; sweeter citrus fruit comes through alongside the more classic earthy Saaz. The flavor has a nice maltiness that is part caramel and part cookie. The hops are mostly leafy and herbal but some of the citrus from the smell is detectable. Body is heftier than expected for the style, but this is still a very drinkable beer.","illidurit","Jun 18, 2008"

There was a very nice balance of caramel malts and American hops, along with a certain spiciness to the flavor. It was a smooth beer for the type. Most of these Lagers just have so much bitterness and bit like other Lagers that I avoid them. This one put the L in lager.","barleywinefiend","Apr 27, 2008"

Caramel and toffee sweetness come out followed by a slight buttery smell. There is also just a slight hint of grapefruit. The taste is sweet but has a descent hop bitterness at the finish. Caramel is pretty prevalent up front. There is grapefruit and other citrus that comes out from the hop presence. Brown sugar and molasses definitely come out also. The mouthfeel is good. Its medium bodied with just a slight carbonation. While this is my first experience with a Red Lager, it really isn't what I expected it to be.

The Beer came out orange amber in color with some chill haze. Carbonation was fine and gentle, which made me wonder if this was bottle conditioned. The aroma was very toasty and caramelized and was layered with a follow up smell of spicy noble hops. The taste was well balanced between the simple bready sweetness of caramel malts and surprisingly bitter hops. Not watery like most Vienna lagers, this was a flavorful and caressing treat. Went fabulously with a plate of Indian cashews and Marcona almonds.","rajendra82","Feb 23, 2008"

This beer had that je ne sais quois that just made you want more and more. Maybe it was the hypnotic stare of the clown on the bottle.
