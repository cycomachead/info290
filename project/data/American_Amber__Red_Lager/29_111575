Poured in a Weizen Glass it produces a large head but provides little to no retention of the carbonation in the brew. Meaning this sucker goes flat faster than you can drink it. Lines of froth on on the glass do not stick as with other lagers.

Horrible flavor almost a caramelized nutty character that hits with a cooked veggie adjunct sweetness, almost like vomit coming up in the back of the gullet hard to stomach each sip...wonderfully horrible. It's cloying the mouthfeel is pretty overcarbonated completely off putting in every sense of the word beer.

And for $1.10 cents a can/25 ounce, I can pretty much step out on the limb and say it will hang with the more expensive darker amber brews.","MarkSmith86","Feb 23, 2014"
4,28.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty reddish-copper in color with a 1-finger slightly off-white foamy head that settles down to just the top and sides. Some lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is of sweet corn, grain and caramel malts. The taste is the same with the caramel malts coming out for the finish. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter finish at all. Is this a 'Bud' product???","BeerWithMike","Feb 22, 2014"
4.1,31.4,3,3.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The thing about this beer is, it's a one trick pony. It's not a brilliant craft lager, but it's the first time I feel Budweiser has produced a lager that's actually worth my time and money. It's tasty, affordable, and there's truly nothing offensive about it. Plus, that 5.7% is a lot more suitable to a craft beer veteran than a Yuengling Amber clocking in at 4.4%. Honestly, in my book it's like a better Yuengling. If you enjoy some cheaper lagers from time to time, or are already a fan of Yuengling Amber, you owe yourself to try this. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I plan to smash about twelve of these with a buddy tonight.","GloryToTheHops","Feb 18, 2014"

I thought ABInBev was going out on a limb by dramatically upping the SRM color for one of it's flagship brands but this is a pleasant surprise and one that both I can see myself drinking in the future and one that will stick around and not be a ""flash-in-the-pan"".","Duff27","Feb 16, 2014"
3.39,8.7,3.75,2.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Read that we were in a ""test market area"" in an article, so I picked up a 6 of pounders for $7 in the name of science. Pours as advertised in color. Smells like most adjunct lagers - not much of anything. I'll be damned, it actually tastes pretty good. Considerably better than Budweiser. No fizzy metallic aftertaste. A little bready, carmel maltiness going on. I actually think it is almost as good as Yuengling. Based on the ABV and price point, it may be one of the better options when you are ready to throw down on a summer night while playing cornhole or looking for a tall boy at the gas station.","WesMantooth","Feb 16, 2014"

4.06,30.1,4,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Busch Signature Copper is not your average Busch Beer. This is a a lot darker in color. This brew pours out a rich, deep amber color with a nice white head. Not a light amber as other Busch Beers. Being 5.7 abv witch is high than Busch being 4.6% ABV and Busch Ice at 5.9%. The smell is rich with grins and malts.  The taste is bold with flavor. The mouth feel is nice and clean. This brew has a lot going on in it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  This is one Busch Beer that I would write home about. Great Brew for the Money. I would buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5.","nicholas2121","Feb 05, 2014"

3.28,5.1,3,3,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Overall, this is surprisingly similar to Budweiser. Darker malt flavors, along with the light, crisp, easy drinking qualities of a light beer. I know it's not a world class beer, but when you combine the fact that this beer is sold at Busch prices, is 5.7% ABV, and has just a touch of darker flavors, it's a winning combo.","boilermakerbrew","0"
