"Having read most of the reviews, and being brand new to this, there isn't anything I can add that hasn't been said. Copper/orange color, quick to fade head, little to no lacing. Nice easy to consume lager. Not fancy, just ""reasonably good""."

"Unfortunately, it appears as though the Lion Brewery has decided to halt it's production of their Amber Lager, quite possibly for good. From what I've heard from numerous distributors around Northeast Pa, Amber has always been a good seller. Aside from their Oktoberfest, Amber is the only thing the entire Lion franchise has going for it. Advertisment is practically non-existent for their products. I just recently tried Susquehanna Brewing's Goldencold Lager, and the Lion would be wise to revive their Amber."
"Pours a light copper color, off white head recedes away to a wisp with little lace. Very light aroma of bready malts and a whiff of hop. In the flavor, mild unoffensive pale malts, lager yeast strain, unoffensive adjunct (corn) flavor, small hop and a slight metallic twang to go with a mild but perceivable bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium/light, well carbonated, semi crisp. Overall, not too bad of beer that could be drank in mass quantities."

"mber color and a smooth even head of white across the top. Aroma is of light grains, hints of mild hops and a touch of a bready note, pretty standard here. Nice even flavor, again mostly a bready, grain malt flavor with only a touch of hops to serve to try and even and balance it out. nice carbonation though and it went down smooth and easy with a crisp, clean finish and a nice bite at the end."
"Poured a simply amber color with a white head that receded to a thin layer with just a bit of spotty lacing. Toasty malts in the aroma, nutty, with hints of caramel. Toasty caramel malts in the taste, and not much else; some hop bitterness becomes apparent near the end, providing some balance. Sweet and pretty smooth, medium mouthfeel; nothing spectacular going on here, but I'd have no problem downing a few."
"Pours not red, but more of a ""dirty gold""/orange. A head recedes to almost nothing. Carb trailers look nice. Smell is a sweet, dark-pastry, kinda fruity even. Taste is nice and full of malts. A bit of mineral. Tasty. Finishes sweet. A good drinker, very hearty.. not too sure I could drink this all night, but for $5.99/six-pack I'd definitely pick it up again."
"Clear amber hue with a thin slighly off white head with thin speckled lacing. Aroma slightly metallic tone with a hint of caramel amber bready malts, going on. Flavor has a slightly sweet bready tone with hints of light caramel. Mouthfeel is thin bodied even carbonation not bad as a whole, the type of beer I will drink if desperate or if on sale for 10 bucks a 12 pack."
"Overall: Many compare this with Yuengling, but there are certainly different taste profiles here IMO. Stands up well to its Pottsville brethren. Can be used in a session quite nicely."
"Overall, just an OK beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. But it's worth a try. The price was a little high for the quality I thought though ($32 for the variety case)."
"Cheers!"
"D: A pleasant, no-frills amber lager. Not really well-known or popular, but this is a better amber than a certain ubiquitous Pennsylvania beer that enjoys a near-cult following. A worthy, accessible brew."
"I got this in a mixed Stegmaier 12-pack, and this was my least favorite (most of the others were quite good). This smells and tastes like a mass-market adjunct lager, much like beers produced by Dundee (of Honey Brown lager fame). Sweetness overwhelms most of the other flavors--there's only a very slight element of the roastiness typical of amber lagers, and hops are fortunately present but underwhelming. For better examples of the style, try GLB's Elliot Ness, Dos Equis Amber or even Trader Joe's Mexican Dark Lager."
"12 oz single from Grocery Outlet, Salem Oregon Average clear see-through amber colour nice creamy head to top it off. Aroma is pleasant enough caramel malts. taste is semi-bitter caramel, with a touch of grassiness, a little taste of iron in the back perhaps from the water used. Pretty OK on the palate . Fine for the style. Overall a simple drinkable amber lager. No real off tastes. Does the job intended for a cheap price."
"Pouring this red-brown beer into a pint glass leaves very little head that quickly fades away. The odor is not powerful but seems to be citrus and leaves. Tastes leafy and of fruit and tea. Stegmaier Amber has decent body and is pretty enjoyable to drink."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a very basic caramel malt sweetness with a dry lager yeast aroma. It has a light metallic aroma as well as little to no hop character. The taste is average as well. It has a weak and watery caramel malt sweetness along with a bone dry finish. It's very bland and lacking in hop character. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a forgettable amber lager. It's lacking flavor and aroma. I'll pass on this one in the future."
"Poured into a stein a deep amber/bronze color with a thinner quick to fade white head,good clarity and color but a very small head.Mainly sweet caramel malt in the nosennot any toastiness and or spicy hop wich I like in a good Vienna lager.Big malty sweet flavors,caramel and sweet dough are the main flavor components,nut really any hop profile to be had.One sided in its sweetness,pretty ho hum but not horrible."
"After enjoying their IPA & Pale Ale previous to this, I was expecting some good things here but this ultimately just didn't impress me at all. Off-notes, muddled balance, and a lighter feel all left me wanting much more from this. Oh well, I guess you can't win them all."
"Good for what it is, however laggers all more or less taste the same for me give or take a little sweetness at the end of the sip. Smell is remarkable for a lager though with notes of caramel, cherries and other fruits, too bad it doesn't hit the taste bud with such force. This one ends in a medium malty sweetness. I don't find it desirable to go look for, but it certainly is drinkable enough to drink if lager is the only option (which it so often is in this day and age)."
"Drinkability: Really disappointed with the off flavors in this one; not recommended"
"Part of the Stegmaier mixed 12 pack. Pours a reddish brown color, not much head or aroma to it. Taste is light bodied, has a slight tinge of hops to it, decent malt backbone. Flavors don't totally mesh well together with me, just average drinkability in my opinion. Amber ales tend to be a boring style, but this one's lack of hops make it even more boring. I'd have one if given to me, but I would in no way seek this one out... rest of the mixed 12 pack is quite good though."
"A dandy gift from Rubby..thank ye. First of all, I had Steg 150, not the stuff pictured here as Amber Lager. From all accounts I could find on line this stuff is a Vienna ""Marzen / Lager. This beauty shows a dark orange amber color, hazy with a fair off-white/light oatmeal colored head that disappates quickly with good lacing. The aroma says rye malt with a slightly minty edge, sort of an odd hint of alcohol, but interesting, not bad. The flavor comes on with a nicer version of that same rye malt, very grainy with an almost resinous feel and proper carbonation for a refreshing and tasty lager. There's some orange/lemon citrus going on but it just adds some tasteful highlights to the solid grain pleasure of this neat brew. There's a little Tootsie Roll sweetness with a fairly clean tingly feel in a medium bodied brew. Very nice lager, one of the better ones for me and one to be quaffed freely!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and hops, a bit of sweetness. Taste is also a good balance of malts and hops, just a bit of sweetness to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"D - I could seriously have a sixer in a sitting no problem. Really enjoyed it."
"D: No a bad little beer, the ABV is good so you could drink a few... The bitterness made it a one session beer for me.... I was a little surprised by the all malt claim.... There has to be some hops in here..."
"D:Very drinkable i can easly drink more of these than i plan to.Good first impression of stegmaier i would buy agian and will try the porter for sure."
"Drinkability - are you kidding me? At $5.99 with this much taste this is the strongest part of the beer."
"If there's any problem with this beer I can't find it. I clearly get the Lion's house character, but I can't fault them for that. And although I think it would be a real winner with just a little bit more malt and body, I can't argue against it as it is. I find it quite pleasant and charming. It would be the perfect beer for parties or get-togethers where a mix of drinkers are present. There's enough here for the initiated, and yet it's not too much for the newbie. Nicely done!"
"Pops the top but didn't need to, I see its a twist-off, good sign or bad we will see. Smells like a macro red but it does have a bit more maltiness behind it. Pours to a reddish-gold with a big bubble head that recedes quickly. Taste is malty at the start with a very twangy hop kicking in, in the middle then lingering while the sweetness fades. I don't know what hop this is but I'm not sure if I like it. With the beer warming up a bit the twang isn't there so much and the god malty backbone transitions to a sweet dry hoppiness that then finishes dry. Has got to be the lagering. I guess I blew the call expecting a red ale but this is much crisper with a much drier finish. For the style a tasty brew. More an Ale man myself but this works in a pinch."
"Not the worst beer I've ever had, but pretty close to it. It looked good when I poured it into the glass, but dang what a weak offering. Thumbs down to BOTM."
"This is a drinkable brew in hot weather. The price for 6 pack is $5.99 in the Toledo, OH area, making this an affordable session beer."
"Hmm, somehow I forgot to rate this when I had it earlier. No matter, as it is quite a memorable beer (and not in a good way). Pours orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet artificial malt. Flavor of the same awful sweet malt, corn, and adjunct flavor. This is an awful beer, too sweet and artificial tasting. There are much better lagers out there (no wonder it was cheaper than Bud...you know that can't be a good thing!)"
"An amazing lager. I don't say that much!"
"Very smooth amber lager with a taste that leans more to the malty side than the hoppy. Light carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. A little light on the hops but still a nice easy drinking amber lager that's pretty quality for the price."
"I found this beer to be way too grainy, really undrinkable, not clean at all I was surprised it received such high marks. The best part of it was the appearance, but really who cares about that. The smell was pretty bad too, dirty water comes to mind rough on the senses Just a cheap lager IMO."
"D - This is very good for the style. A malty sweet lager with a touch of bitter hops."
"Even with easy access, I can't see myself drinking Amber Lager very often (okay, ever again). On the other hand, it does what it was brewed to do, which ought to count for something. Who needs bell and whistles every time they crack the crown?"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, there isn't anything too outstanding about this beer but it's a solid sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Picked up a case from Liberty Bell Beverages for about $22. Poured a clear amber with a short head. Funny, this beer is basically like a well-made Yuengling. It tastes like a sweet, caramel and multi-grain bread with a bit of toasty toffee roast at the end. There's also a bit of apple juice fruit flavor and overall this is an affordable and tasty lager."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. The lager appears a crystal clear copper color with about an inch of creamy bone white foam. Nose and flavor are of nicely toasted grain, a good dose of sweet caramel malts, a bit fruity, grassy bitter hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. A tasty all malt lager. Can't complain about the price either."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a light copper with a massive white head. The aroma is faint, slightly bready. The flavor has sweet grain notes with a slightly bitter finish. The brew is light bodied highly carbonated and is smooth drinking. A decent summertime brew."
"Overall- Light and tasty. Very easy to drink and an excellent sessionable BBQ or tailgatig beer!"
"D: Better than I expected."
"Overall-an ok stab at an Amber, I've seen far worse, and like all Lion beers it's cheap!"
"Better than my expectations."
"Overall a tasty lager that would be very good with a bit more hops."
"The beer, much like the Gold Metal Beer, thins out and whisps away, giving the impression of emptiness despite the bottle's claim of all-malt. Again, an ok beer that struggles for mediocracy."
"Copper hue with a light head. dissipates into minimal lacing and a thin film of white on top. smell is caramel with some biscuit. taste follows smell with caramel being up front. some butterscotch in there too. slight hop bitterness at first taste that fades. good level of carbonation. overall a pretty decent beer, especially for the $20 price point."
"Beer Its Not Just A Beverage Beer Is Food"
"Amazing drinkability and I think this truly one lager that I would truly recommend for sessioning without compromising flavor."
"I had been reading about Steg 150 and emailed the Lion to see if they were selling a Stegmaier variety pack for the holidays. They werent. So after looking for it at my local distributors and not finding it I finally had to ask a for it. They really didnt sell much from the Lion other than Lionsead. Anyway it cost me about 23 bucks in So.Chester County(later found it for under 18 at BeerMart in Reading, not close too me but I stop in while in the area now and then). The beer from the cold bottle was a slightly hazy amber color. It smelled of sweet malt. I would put the taste between Yuengling (more there) and Sam Adams (less than SA).It had a sort of sweet stickiness which reminded me of a Sam. Overall, I thought it was an impressive beer from the Lion.It seems like all of the PA breweries are moving to more richer lagers ala Yuengling. On the downside, I had a hard time finding this beer in Lancaster and Chester counties."
"I am not much of a lager fan, but this beer was really enjoyable."
"Taste is very crisp, dry but with a hint of malt sweetness. Not a whole lot, there, might have not let it warm up long enough, but it is smooth, drinkable, and very refreshing, especially nice and cold. An above average and enjoyable, albeit simple, beer."
"Amber color with a light tan head. Smells like Vienna/ caramel malt and a little metal. Some caramelized malt flavor with some light oxidized notes of cardboard and metal. Solid medium bodied mouth feel with a slightly bitter hoppy finish. This is not a bad beer, but would probably taste much better on tap in its hometown. I would be glad to try it again under those conditions. A solid, reliable amber lager."
"Received as a trade extra from Psycohops, the 12 oz long neck bottle was conservatively adorned with a simple but elegant front label, and a very informational back label. The beer itself was clear and effervescent deep gold (rather than copper as indicated on the packaging), and the head was one finger thick. The aroma was clean and malty with some spice also present. The taste indicated spicy floral hops and double concoction sweet and toasty German malts. Although malty, the start and end was each sip felt quite dry. Very smooth and softly textured mouthfeel. Simple of construction, but more complex in character than first suggested. No ABV listed, but I suspect this was a bit heavier than a typical Vienna Lager."
"Exceptional drinkability, definitely a session beer that could take the place of yuengling if it was more available. A great take on this style, not as malty as sam adams and a little more interesting than yuengling."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 3/4"" beige head over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Thick head fades slowly, with dwelling lace. Aroma is balanced and lightly fruity. Taste follows the nose, sedate and approachable. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinking is easy. Nothing earth-shattering, but just an average plus brew."
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with a white head. Aromas that consist of a sweet lager malt. In the taste, watery, a very small malt, but not much flavor at all. A watery mouthfeel with a small lager-ish aftertaste that ends up to no aftertaste at all. I was expecting a bit more flavor, and very watery."
"Pours a rich copper, clear and with an ample head. Aroma is of subtle malt and hop notes. Taste is sweet, malty, no adjuncts here. There's just enough hop presence to balance the sweet. There's also the Steggy house metallic twang which always seems to be appropriate by the second bottle. This is crisp, medium-bodied and finishes lightly sweet. Drinkability is good. I rate it slightly below SABL and slightly above Negra Modelo for style."
"Pours a translucent amber color with a decent-sized light tan head that sticks around for a good bit. Some stickage, but little lacing. A few slow moving streamers of carbonation. Aromas of lightly toasted malts, mild hops and a slight mineral quality. Predominantly malty and sweet with very little bitterness to counterbalance other than some light astringency in the finish. Carbonation seems a bit low, as if it was all blown off by the pour. What's left after the lower carbonation is a medium bodied lager that feels a bit thicker than it should with an average carbonation level. Overall, a pretty decent all-malt lager that is fairly drinkable. Personally, I like it better than Yuengling, it tastes smoother, contains no adjuncts, and is more affordable. It's worth trying out, but won't knock your socks off or anything..."
"i think this beer was made to compete with yeungling lager. if so i'd buy this over yuengling if it came down to it."
"Folks, as you probably already know, this is not the Summer Stock. It looks pretty good in the glass. It's amber, reddish in color with a foamy head that dissapates in a bit. I'm not getting a lot of aroma, just a whiff of clean malt. The stuff tastes pretty good. Kind of on the amber, Vienna side of things, with a more complex malt bill. Like the all the Steg varietal products, I don't think this is any lawnmower beer. It might be a little spritzy but that adds to the refreshment. I think it's a very drinkable beer and I bet it's pretty good on tap, if available."
"Light to almost medium mouthfeel, a pleasing juicy feel. Goes down very nice. One of the Steg beers i've had I hope they keep this one around Give this beer a try I think you'll be pleasingly suprized."
"Skoal"
"I am continually impressed by Lion's new Stegmaier offerings. This one is another winner. I'd compare it to Yunegling but with more flavor, smoother and cleaner, and obviously no adjuncts. At $20 a case I could see this converting Yuengling drinkers. Pick it up if you see it."
