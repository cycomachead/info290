The taste is caramel and grains with minimal bitterness.  The finish is slightly sweet.  Mouth feel is very smooth and the carbonation quite subtle.

It goes very well with food (LaRosa's pizza in this case) and quenches nicely and doesn't get in the way of the food. It's like this beer was designed to be had with food - complimenting what is there but not getting in the way or clashing. So I could easily have another...but with food.

Aroma is bready and sweet malt, along with a little bit of caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like bready and caramel malt, and a bit of hops are noticable, too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and goes down very easy. It wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. For the style of beer this is, it's good.","bluejacket74","Dec 26, 2010"
