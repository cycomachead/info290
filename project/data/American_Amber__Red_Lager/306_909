3.27,7.9,3.25,3,3.5,3,3.25,"I usually drink these straight from the bottle, but what the hell. Pours in to a Craft Beer Exchange pint glass with a nice amber color and a high degree of transparency. 2 fingers of light beige foam disappear quickly, leaving only a thin film and a small collar. The aroma is pretty clean. Just some sweet malty aromas. Perhaps a little hint of ripened fruits. Not much there, but pleasant. The flavor of Killians is unmistakable. Of course there are the typical sweet caramel-like malt flavors that are common for the style. But there's also something more. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'd say it's reminiscent of a vanilla extract flavor. It's a bit earthy, and reminds me of Jordanian almonds with that hard vanilla candy shell. I've picked this up in ""vanilla"" beers such as Snowdrift and Breckenridge, so it's odd to find it here, but it seems to work. The body of the beer is medium and easy. Quite unintimidating. It's simple and accessible. Despite some of the flavors being a bit disjointed, and a notion that the product may be on the ""cheap"" side, it comes together pretty well in the end. This is a classic that helped launch my love of craft beer. It was one of the first brews that I sampled that dared to stray from the fizzy, yellow water recipe, and I for that I am probably a bit a partial.","JohnnyI","Mar 08, 2015"

4.75,56.8,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"I have consumed copious amounts of various foreign and domestic brewery products in my lifetime; especially during my career in the US Air Force from 1968-1972, the Canadian Forces (Reserve) 1980-1984, and the US Army from 1984-1998. I have spent twelve years in Canada, five years in Germany, two years in Korea, and a year in Viet-Nam, in addition to my years in the continental US, sampling beer. I do not usually drink more than two bottles or cans at one sitting. (No, that's not because I have to empty my bladder after every two beers and change seats at the bar upon returning.) I have not been thoroughly intoxicated since I had an OD on rum and cola in 1969. I view drinking alcoholic beverages as relaxing, pleasant, and even enjoyable. George Killian's Irish Red is my first choice, and if an establishment does not stock it I frequently order tonic water or I go elsewhere.","michaelleepemberton","Jun 28, 2014"

Pours a pretty copper/bronze color with a very tiny head with just a little lacing when sipped. The aroma was of nothing special, just a light sweet malt smell. The taste was pretty much the same though it wasn't bad at all. Not a real harsh aftertaste either. Overall it was just ok.","BeerWithMike","Aug 14, 2013"

APPEARANCE: handsome black and tan split-level body; thin white head that staggers on its reddish-brown base--looks inviting... AROMA: fragrant caramel malts breath a bready blast; sugary suggestions as well... PALATE: medium-to-light bodied with a swift, soft aftertaste--a red in the pattern of the many during its mid-90s deluge that we came of drinking age to at college...TASTE: strongly malted base forms the brunt of this old-time Hess Tavern offering; rather flat, rounded ops that profile as an ESB, though not enough hops surface to make an ale; a bit buttery too--but more in the feel than in the taste; the after drag is slightly warm and rough... OVERALL: a lagered, emasculated ESB that fulfills its March Ides duty but cannot demand much more on a cool summer night such as this...recently I toasted the anniversary of my wife and I by romantically recalling this beer set next to mine (a Honey Brown) on a college bar basement table; out of context, Killians looks nice in that oddly-necked bottle, but now under Coors' auspices, one can see what is and is not present in this beer...","dacrza1","Aug 03, 2013"

But the head it pours is amazing, thick and with a touch of red as well, it has good staying power and the best lacing I've seen in awhile. The smell is nothing to terribly to right about - I smell some floral mixture of some sort. Just the right amount of carbonation for the mouthfeel, but a bit watery for such as strong tasting beer. I did notice hints of cinnamon and orange (strangely enough). Overall, a good beer to have around, especially if you've got folks over who are a bit nervous to try unknown craft brews.","jjamadorphd","Apr 07, 2013"

I don't know why this beer was changed, the original brew was really pretty good, but its become another factory beer casualty. better body than most though, and the carbonation is agreeable.

It tasted very stale and it didn't appeal to me. It isn't horrible by any means, Just not very good. I believe there were tons of these leftover the day after.

Faint caramel and light grain along with a bit of metallic tinge in the nose. The taste is very much like the smell the with just a touch of the light and toasted caramel malt which is balanced by a faint bit of hop. No real hop character or flavors are there just the bitterness. The overall character is dry and relatively light, a bit slick and some of that metallic slipperiness is in there as well. This is an ok beer obviously it isnt a true Irish Red but it's clear that somebody at coors thought about what an Irish Red should be before making the same light lager with a darker color. Probably good at a picnic, but definitely not a go to beer.","fank2788","May 25, 2012"

Now that my beer knowledge and tastes have expanded, I wondered how the Killians would fare. The Killians is leather brown in color, which most people would call red. A nice head forms on top. There is a pleasing malty aroma. The flavor is very much in the English Ale style, lots of malt and very mild in the hop department. My memories were correct, and I have not been completely jaded by big “statement” beers I have tasted lately. The Killians was easy drinking and quite flavorful. One of the better Molson Coors products.","iSip","Feb 09, 2012"

The taste is alright though, it goes down fairly watery with a bit of a caramel malt finish that's rather pleasant. The mouthfeel is smooth, and the drinkability is pretty good.

The first thing that went through my mind was, “An Irish red in a six pack for 6 bucks, may as well give it a try!” The beer really has no smell to speak of maybe a small hint of malt. The taste isn’t bad because there really is no taste. It’s very light and slightly fruity and crisp almost like a very, very light Wee Heavy. Feel in the mouth was like water. I later found out that the name Killian was purchased by Coors back in the 1980’s. I’m not sure how close this beer is to the original Lett’s Irish Red it’s based off of but it really isn’t a very good beer, not worthy of the title Irish Red anyway.","greenborn","Nov 13, 2011"

It tasted yeasty, malty, and nutty. I did not detect much in the way of hops. The mouthfeel was close to that of carbonated water. The whole roof of my mouth felt the carbonation. There was a mildly sweet finish with a metalic hint and a lingering mild bitterness. This was the only Irish Red I've had and so can't compare with others of the style.

The head, in the blink of an eye, dissipated into nothing. The beer gave off a light malt aroma and not much else. The taste of the beer followed suit, a slightly sweet roasted malts, but it seemed watered down. No aftertaste to mention, but make sure that you drink it while it is cold. I let it sit for a few minutes while grilling and it got a bit warm and I could not finish it, dumped it straight into the yard. The beer was light bodied and seemed over carbonated. Not exactly easy to drink, but easier than some. Overall, I remember it being better in my college days, but then again, I really didn't drink good beer than.

However, when I was just starting out I was just taking what ever I could get. Killian's pours out as an attractive amber color with a big rising tan colored head on it. The head settles into some random sudsy patterns on top of the brew for a little while. The smell of the beer is a bit earthy with a lots of caramel on the nose. The taste of the been is mostly caramel too in my opinion, not much in way of hops, but I still find it to be a tasty brew. The mouthfeel isn't bad, it's got a decent bubbly feel and it's a little thick too. Overall I had so much Killian's when I started drinking beers that I thought I'd had enough of it.

Flavor is typical american amber lager up-front but resolves to a very pleasant lingering fresh and crisp maltiness that stays around a long time. This beer is better than I remember it being way back about 8 years ago. It has a very malt-oriented profile. The only drawback is the thin, harsh macro-lager mouthfeel. The hops only serve to balance the sweetness. As good as Amber Bock if not a touch better in the malt profile. There are better Irish Reds out there.","EagleTalon","Apr 23, 2011"

3.22,6.3,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Well on the appearance, it pours a small half finger head, it looks very nice though, a little creamy perhaps, and I can tell it's leaving ok lacing, considering it's made by Coors. The body is a little lame it's slightly transparent, and there is probably more carbonation than there should be. The body is a dark reddish brown, so it looks like a red should look like. The head is now gone, meh, it looks ok, the lacing is it's only redeeming factor, and we'll see if that lasts the whole way down. Well, the smell is a little interesting, the main smell is malt, and the average irish red smell, which is good, it's good that it actually has an irish red smell too it. The only thing weird is there is a distant smell, I can't make out what it is, it's not a Coors smell, it's just different, who knows maybe it wont be a bad flavor. Overall the aroma actually isn't that bad, pretty standard. Wow, well this one is hard to grade on taste. At first you get that Coorsy taste (so I guess I was wrong, it was a Coors smell), just that generic beer, adjunct taste. Then comes the more genuine irish red taste, malty and what not. Then in the finish you get a huge sweetness, it's not a malt sweetness, and it's not brown sugar or molasses or maple or anything like that. Frankly it tastes like they just poured table sugar in here, I know that sounds bad, but it finishes things off nicely. It would be different if it was SUPER overpowering, but it's not. It helps me forget about that Coors taste too. Overall, I mean, table sugar is no great micro brew ingredient, so I can't really give it points for that, but I will say that the taste isn't bad overall. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, which is what I was expecting, irish reds are supposed to be somewhat thin, but this is pretty fing thin, so nothing special there. The drinkability is pretty nice, the sugar tatse probably helps with that a lot, and the fact that it's light. Overall, not a bad beer, one of the better Coors brews out there, there is still that Coors taste, but oh well.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 15, 2011"

Red in color, clear, the head was there and gone in a flash and could not be resurrected. The aroma was caramel and malty with a hint of what seemed to be strawberry ice cream.

The taste on the other hand was quite nice. It is one of the smoothest Irish Reds but that isn't necessarily a compliment. Smoothness is often indicative of a low quality and simple beer.

Pretty high on the drinkability scale, it's medium-bodied but not too heavy compared to a lager.

I can see why I liked this beer more than most of the macros at the time, but I was slightly disappointed at this beer. A Bud American Ale is a better choice if you can make it, but Killian's Irish Red may be the best on tap when you go out sometimes. It poured decently enough: an average sized head with minimal lacing and a clear red color. The smell was weak, but nothing unpleasant. Largely based off a light caramel smell with alcoholic aromas in the background. The taste isn't much more. It's a very weak beer with a sweetness to it. It is also overcarbonated and quite watery. It's quite drinkable due to its low alcohol content (and the fact that there is nothing bad about this beer), but it still lacks the quality factor many are looking for.

Off the tap at a Boston airport it was a deep amber color with some ruby hues. The one-finger, tan head retained decently but left almost no lacing. The aroma was of roasted and caramel malt with some faint hops in the background. The flavors were well balanced, toasted malt and hints of caramel malt with a nutty, bitter finish from the hops. The mouthfeel was rather slick, the carbonation medium/low and the body medium. I can see now why I did purchase it in bulk.

This is worth trying especially if you are looking towards average prices for a better macro than the rest. It has a good mouthfeel and it is easy to drink.

However, I get left with an aftertaste that I can do without, espescially after about three or four. I also have to drink this extra cold.

The taste is really nice with an awesome over-roasted caramel malt that sends smoky caramel up into my nose on the swallow. The malt also contains elements of oak and mushrooms. This sweet malt is balanced with a light citrus sour and an understated hop dryness. This is a great blend of flavors. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with a nice prominent, but unobtrusive carbonation. I found this to be a great brew considering that its mass produced and so widely available.

In my earlier days I remember this beer having a bold flavor compared to what I was mostly drinking (college party beers). The color of this beer is always consistent - a clear amber-red with a light to very little head and very little lacing. It has a good malty smell that is a bit deep but clean. I swear that I can detect some corn adjuncts in the smell however. The taste is still not bad, it's a sweet-to-bitter carmalized maltly flavor. Mouthfeel is thin however. It's a standard red lager, not near as good as a Yuengling but it's still a very drinkable beer.

Smell is pleasant too, mostly of carmalized malt. Taste is pretty good. Sweet malts up front, but the hops are very bland. That's not all bad, at least the hops aren't nasty, but even I think they need a stronger hop presence. Mouthfeel is ok. Not too thick or too thin, but carbonation could be a little weaker. Drinkability is good, Killian's always goes down easy. Its not great because the taste isn't so good that I still really want more after I've had 2. Not that drinking another one would be an effort either. Anyway, for your use instead of mine, the good things that can be said for Killian's are that it can be had anywhere, its never objectionable and pretty easy to drink, and the malts are pretty good. The down side is that its expensive and there are more flavorful beers out there for less. For me, its best attribute now is that its available so widely.","casualbeerman","Jan 03, 2006"

Cooked grains readily apparent in the aroma. Taste... well, its basically Coors Original with red food coloring. Really no complexity to speak of. Somewhat bitter, but not from hops. Very bland, tastes like it was probably made with a strain of Coors' lager yeast. Unremarkable, I wouldn't waste your time. I have a hard time believing that this is brewed according to the same recipe as the Euro counterpart, though I've never had that.

To please more people, the hops flavor and aroma are almost nonexistant. A bit of hop flavor is there, but hidden under a malty blanket. This beer is a bit sweet and so not well balanced.

Not bad, but more average than anything. There is no hint of hop, which makes the beer suffer. There is a ery prominent grain flavor in the beer, more than I would want. There are no hops to speak of, so the beer again fails in what I would like. There is a decently thick mouthfeel on the beer, and there is also not as much carbonation as I would want as well. I just don't like the flavor of this beer. Its not a bad offering from the brewery, but still not my favorite out of a bottle.

Not to say that the flavor is watery, because there are definitely some good qualities about it. It finishes with some bitterness and the remains of too much carbonation. Mouthfeel is too thin (carbonation) for my tastes. I remember loving this beer during my college years. I see now that my tastes have matured significantly.

Good for serving to macro friends or just killing a few cheap beers without sacrficing all the taste you enjoy.","aaronh","Dec 08, 2002"
3.06,1,4,3,3,3,3,"This stuff is comparable to Michelob Amber Bock, as both are probably some of the best offerings of their respective companies, and share similar traits. I still feel the ""macroness"" about this beer, even though its probably a good gateway beer for swillers. Killian's offers nothing extraordinary, but is a decent drinkable beer.","Beastdog75","Dec 02, 2002"
3.41,12.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,4,"As far as the taste of this beer goes. It kind of ""gets you there"" and leaves you hanging. It has a lot of malt taste but it kind of just evaporates to nothing as you finish a gulp. This beer is perfect for a mildly chilly Saturday of Football watching, goes down super easy and is great for extended periods of drinking which I have come to enjoy. Like I said before, if taste is what you want it leaves a lot to be desired...","alittlehazy","Nov 24, 2002"

However, the nice looks only go so far, the beer has minimal aroma a sugary caramely sweetness with a sharp note in the finish. The taste is rather bland and sugary, but there are more caramel or roasted notes than a typical macro-red. The body is way too light, but I guess that is what makes this beer easy to drink.","brakspear","Nov 16, 2002"

The smell offers a mild confection of powdered sugar, roasted red-skin peanuts and alcohol. The flavors are nice and dry, supported by a medium-body and finish with a fine dust of cellulose. Peanut M&Ms never got me so buzzed.","putnam","Oct 07, 2002"

Overall, an above average beer, but nothing great.","ryanocerus","Sep 18, 2002"

I'll give this brew this, it has respectable balance, a Karo syrup malt flavor is counteracted by a hop crispness at the finish.  Utterly ordinary beer, not repulsive but a formula no better or worse than other macros.  The darker color may lure beer ""posers"".","ADR","Jul 19, 2002"
2.68,-11.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Although the beer is brewed by Coors, it does have some distinguishing characteristics, and if not served too cold (as it usually is) is not half bad.

Not the greatest flavor, but I have had much, much worse.","goindownsouth","Jun 27, 2002"

3.23,6.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"I used to think this was the best beer out there, until I started to look around. I still think it better than average. Nice amber color, poured properly and little wrist into it, produces a big fluffy reddish head. Sweet, very sweet roasted malt and barley to it, not alot of hops to notice at all. Syrupy feel to it, and an puzzling bitter, smelly aftertaste that keeps it from being better. However, IMO the best the big macros have to offer. Cheers to Coors for this and Blue Moon Belgian White. I think they at least try. I was surprised to see this listed with Anchor Steam and Boston Lager. Believe or not, Killians with a little chopped garlic, makes a great steak marinade.","StevieW","Jun 07, 2002"
3.2,5.6,3,3,3,4,3.5,"Medium amber with little head but decent retention.  The hop bitterness hits you and lingers through the finish (and beyond).  This is an interesting bitterness that is difficult to explain.  It is not citrusy, not flowery, but at the same time not just straight bitter.  Perhaps it is bittersweet but more on the bitter side.","canoehornpoint","Jun 06, 2002"

Very highly carbonated and lightly bodied.  Smoother in flavor profile with less 6 - row graininess than the typical macrobrew, but the lack of distinctive malt character or hop flavor make this an uninteresting brew.  There's a bit of corn sweetness there as well-- there's no way this brew is all barley malt.  Finishes dry, clean and boring.  I had to try this again.  After the first few sips I was sorely craving a brew with real flavor.","marc77","May 09, 2002"
