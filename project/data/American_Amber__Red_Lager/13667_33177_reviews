"Another pleasant offering from Starr Hill. Nothing spectacular, but well rounded and tasty. I would be happy to try it again."

"O- not terrible, but not overwhelming, either. Middle of the road."

"O- average lager. I think yuengling is a better bang for your buck here but this is better than BMC brews."
""
"O: Not great, not awful. A decent easy drinking beer but you could definitely do better."
"O- Wow, this will likely be going down the drain. I don't normally like Vienna lagers but this is a real disaster. Easily the worst offering I've had from Starr Hill."

"Poured from a bottle into a cheap glass stein. Nice medium amber color with a good head. Very little lacing. Not overly hoppy - nice balance between hop and malt. Hints if citrus. Nice, refreshing beer. Need to make a trip to the mountains to try this on tap."

"This is a nice diminutive amber lager with a light hop presence that I like. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall some hops, little sweetness, drinks more like a hoppy lager then an vienna. Drinkable, but hardly impressionable or near style demands. A 3.25 seems to nail every catagory here, not quite good, but a hair above average in most regards."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a orange straw color with a fluffy white head, very nice looking for a Vienna lager. Smells of sweet grain, very balanced, but a tad bland. Tastes of barley lightly roasted and very slight hops, nice for a lager with some great taste. Beer is carbonated a little on the heavy side but is very refreshing and goes down well. Overall, an above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, some malts. Taste is the same, mild, some grains and malts, a touch of sweetness, a hint of bitterness at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a dark amber tan color with no head at all. Ugly for sure. The beer smelled like beer nothing special. However I liked the taste. It was a sock knocker, but it was decent. For no head I thought it tasted fresh. I will try this again maybe on tap would be good."
"Flavor is refreshing and relatively balanced but simply not that tasty. A bit of skunk or sour or something colors the taste throughout and into the finish and aftertaste. The texture is a bit heavy, which limits its use as a lawnmower beer. Something just not right here. Not doing it for me."
""
""
""
"Overall: I didnt like this one very much. It isnt very balanced and is too sour for my liking."
""
"Part of a mixed 12 pack, last one left to review. Pours a semi see-thru golden color, smallish head to it. Not much at all in the nose. Taste is light to medium bodied, pretty good mouthfeel. Nice lager taste; good balance with the hops/malts not outweighing each other. Finishes clean and smooth. A nice, solid beer.. no outstanding flavors but goes down easy and is very drinkable."
""
"Overall – Easy to drink, but again nothing to special. Good flavors, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"Served in pint glass, this beer has a darker gold color and hoppier aftertaste than the average lager. I am a fan of a slightly maltier brew than this, but did order a second glass. Jomo Lager would be a good complement to a basic pub-food menu, but it is not a beer I would go searching after."

"Overall, this is not a bad lager. I've had many craft lagers worse than this, to say nothing of BMC offerings."

"O - This is not a particularly bold or interesting style, and this beer stays too close to the low expectations for a macro-brewery lager excepting the extra spicy and bitter hops. The semi-dry and relatively full mouthfeel also elevate this beer. Still, I found it not flawed, perhaps, but not good or interesting enough to recommend to anyone except fans of this style."
"The beer is a golden slight copper color that is a little hazy.  The head is about 1/2 a finger thick and the carbonation is visually present. The aroma is odd at first. There an earthy bread-like smell that reminds me of a basement. There is also a faint hops scent and a malty tone. The flavor is sweet with hints of honey, caramel, and wheat bread. A very mild sense of hops while in the mouth. It's slightly tart, has a light body and a clean dry finish. "
"It's decent - I don't dislike it. But I'm more of an ale guy."
"O: I would buy this over any macro lager any day, that being said.. I'm disappointed with this beer a lot. I paid like 15 dollars for a 12 pack and didn't get an enjoyable experience from it. This is one of the local brewery's in Va near me and I was hoping for better."
"A very middle-of-the-road lager. Nothing outstanding to note but solid and delicious all around."
"overall this is a pretty good beer, worth a try and glad I could try it on vacation"
"Finish is crisp and bitter with a medium body. Carbonation is between moderate and high. Overall an OK beer, but not one I would readily seek out again."
"Poured a murky orange in color with a small white fizzy head that was fully diminishing and had poor lacing. The aroma was of sweet malts with a light citrus hop scent. It tasted bitter and rather malty at first and finished with a nice biter-sweet hoppy flavor that stuck around on the taste buds for and average amount of time. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body with and creamy yet dry texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a great lager with a nice mix of maltiness and bitterness."
"Pours a moderately hazy red-copper color with a half-finger white head that sticks around for a bit and exhibits some small white bubbles. A bit of lacing afterward. The nose brings forward a bit of bready malt plus a touch of toast. Some mild earthy hops there as well. The taste has a very pour showing--slight infection has set in and there is a bit of an acetic presence. Very unfortunate. Other than that, there's a mild cherry-skin presence along with some breadiness in the background. Slight bitterness in the finish, but the coming vinegar takes over. Another infected bottle; quite a shame."
"Clear, copper color, a bit of off-white head. A slight fruit aroma, maybe citrus and berry, but otherwise no aroma at all. Light malt flavor, mild, with a touch of floral and fruity hops. Very light but smooth. Light bodied, thin mouthfeel. Good drinkability but this beer is pretty un-noteworthy in every sense."
"Overall - I don't understand how this is classified as a lager. Not very impressed with this one from Starr Hill"
"The beer pours a medium amber color, with a very mild off-white head that quickly becomes only a memory. The nose shows a character that makes the beer seem more like an east coast Amber Ale than a Vienna lager; although I suppose there isn't a world of difference between the two styles. Fairly subtle notes of medium to medium-high crystal malt. The palate does indeed carry the malt-forward character of a Vienna lager. German malt notes greet the palate, followed by a mild bitterness, and a clean slightly malty finish. Overall, the beer is not poorly made, but lacks any really differentiating character. Average."
"This beer is just flat out weird, bizarre and off putting. How can anyone drink this is beyond me."
"Mighty fine beer folks - Give it a shot if you can get your hands on it in VA or elsewhere."
"Nice looking lager to start, lighter amber color with 1 1/2 inch head that recedes fairly quickly. Lot's of honey in the first sniff of this one, slightly piney scent in the nose as well as some overcooked veggie smell that I can't quite put my finger on...Tastes pretty good, still noticing that strong honey-like resemblence in each sip, nice balance of malts and piney/earthy hops in this one. Slight buttery and nutty aftertaste, with a medium body and matching carbonation, a solid lager for sure."
"D: A very drinkable beer. As I mentioned it's not overly complex, and the fairly low ABV makes it appealing as a session beer. Assertive compared to many lagers, but pretty tame overall."
"A decent, drinkable beer but not worth actively seeking out."
"The Jomo pours a cloudy golden orange color with a white cloud-like foam head. The nose is mostly of oranges and a mixture of malt and corn syrup. There is some other aroma that I would say is almost akin to oregano, it was off putting. The palate is a bit of wheat flavor mixed with some sour citrus notes. The sour flavors somewhat ruin the malty goodness that should be there. The feel is a bit flat on the tongue, nothing too bad, but still not great. The beer is fairly drinkable. Overall, it just wasn't that great of a beer."
"Carbonation is spot on despite the deadness in the glass. Mouthfeel seems full bodied but so disapointing in that finish. Although I'm not a huge fan of this amber lager it still drinks really well and refreshing the way it should be."
"Value: Not terribly exciting for the $9.99 a sixer price tag. I'd pass on that."
"Maybe not a session beer, but certainly goes down easy. Smooth and refreshing, but with a nice beery aftertaste. I am a fan."
"Probably refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability is good, not much of a light lager drinker but would be much better choice then those mass produced lagers out there. Want to thank merlin48 for this sample."
"M/D - medium bodied with good carbonation, not really my first choice in what to drink, nothing horrible tasting just nothing noteworthy"
"I don't know about the vienna lager label, I though this was a great all-malt American lager, or an American amber lager. It's a simple and delicious pairing of mild citrusy hops with clean lightly toasted barley. It seems like it could have mass appeal while still satisfying beer geeks like myself (yes, I was satisfied). Overall this is a solid lager worth checking out."
"D - Where this beer shines. Picked it up at a gas station where it was the only non-BMC 6-pack and I daresay it's far more drinkable than its shelfmates whose sole virtue is drinkability."
"D- All in all, not my favorite style, but this is a very drinkable beer that was pretty refreshing. Not bad at all."
"Pours a pale golden amber with a bit more than a finger of white foamy head that lingers for a good while and leaves a good amount of lacing behind as well. The smell has a general farmhouse-style funk behind it, with some wheat, coriander, and lemongrass up front. The taste also has a lemony wheatiness to it, the coriander weaving its way through, and a somewhat blunt funky tartness cutting across it all. The body is fairly light, finishes mostly dry, and has a healthy dose of carbonation, but the drinkability is hampered by the somewhat off funkiness that just doesn't fit."
"Yummy after opening this beer I decided I needed a turkey sandwich...why? Well this one has sorta a dill pickle attack to it. Once you get past this, Starr Hill did a good job, it is just an odd first attack. Not the first beer I have had with that as an attack. The Jomo has a clean refreshing taste to it, that is quite complex, but east to drink. This is defiantly a good beer to have with a picnic. In fact, grab your picnic basket, some of this beer, a sandwich or two, and a SEXY woman...Good beer"
"D= slightly specialized craft-beer that might catch on with someone in-session but not one that I would plan a session around."
"Beer is pretty filling and only angers me because it seems incomplete. I would switch beers after drinking this."
"Had this while at a party at a hippie commune in Louisa, VA. A copper colour dominates, while the taste and smell screams of bready malts, with a little bit of candy apple and even honey thrown in. Mouthfeel is very smooth, yet crisp, and this is a beer I would have again."
"Pours coppery/amber with a decent but very short-lived head. The aroma is slightly grainy with a hint of honey, which strengthens as the beer warms. The flavor is solidly grainy, witha nice, crisp honeyish bite. The mouthfeel is quite smooth with little carbonation, and there is a slight hop bitterness on the finish, but it transitions to a slight stale sourness, unfortunately."
"Buy Again? No."
"I was originally scared to pick this up off the shelf. But I was impressed in the end. Pours a clear copper color Aroma is of malts and has a slight fruity character, a little citrusy. There is some fruitiness in the flavor. Also there is a slight barley, or malt sweetness that shines through."
"poured into one of the few clear glasses that my parents have. premier. a golden peach in the glass! lovely, little white head, constant slow motion circus of bubbles rising from the depths. smells of clean yeast and german malt, faint earthy hops. delicious dry and sweet malt presence (a bit loafy), a slight bitterness and a smooth delivery make this an easy quaffer. the malts clutch the tongue for seconds afterwards, eventually relinquishing their hold. a fridge full of this would be hardly disappointing."
"Pours a clear, copper/gold color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, slight citrus, metal, and some grain. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, grain, slight citrus, some cider-like flavor, and slight hops. Overall, fairly acidic with a tang when cold but mellows when warmed. This beer is much much better at 45-50 degrees than fresh out of the refrigerator."
"their IPA is acceptable.... the stout is fine.... this, however, awful."
"drinkability: overall decent lager, not my style. But if I had to have lager this a decent selection"
"Poured into Unibroue tulip. Head quickly fades away. Some sudsy lacing slides down the glass. Aroma is bready, biscuity, and lager yeasty. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Mild hops and moderate malt bill. Nothing too terribly exciting but certainly a solid offering."
"Nice clean taste, in the best way possible. This is clean but with flavor. Lots of beers taste clean in that they have little flavor, but this is flavorful, with a nice crisp finish, very refreshing."
"Overall better then I thought it would be. This was actually fairly decent and i would not turn it down if offered."
"D- Overall, not a bad lager but nothing I would purchase again. "
"I definitely enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Has a different aroma than the typical Vienna Lager and that comes from the hops used. They give some citrus notes to go along with the pale malt. The flavor is a bit unusual as well. The hops give citrus and fruity flavors instead of the grassy and spicy flavors from the typical Noble hops used in this style. I personally do not care much for the flavor in this beer. Nice body and carbonation makes this easy enough to consume and session."
"Drinkability: A decent Vienna lager. Not the best, not the worst, but still pretty good. A decent session beer."
"Drinkability: this one can be consumed all day long as the flavor profile is enjoyable."
"Pour is a translucent light amber/orange color with a large fluffy white head that leaves some broken rings of lacing. Very little aroma, grain and some caramel malt, nothing complex or strong. Lighter side of medium body with some weak carbonation. Finish is fairly dry and brief. Flavor has nice, slightly sweet caramel, biscuit malt body. Slight grain flavor lingers in finish. A nice lager, but not the best vienna lager, finish is a little to watery and body is lacking any strong character."
"Had this on a warm summer evening outside at a bar on a deck. Had nice color to it, a deep amber color. Poured a lite colored head with some lacing. to it. It was tough to tell the clarity of the beer, since it was outside they gave it too me in a plastic cup, but from what I could tell I think the clarity would have been good. Smelled fairly balanced not too hoppy. It tasted pretty good. I again not overly hoppy, could tast some roasted malts to it. Went down pretty smooth, was very drinkable, I'd get it again, or try more from this brewery if I had the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Fairly high, but not very flavorful nor memorable unfortunately. It's hard to rate this much higher comparing it to others I've had in this style."
"D: Not bad, just boring and lifeless. I don't see myself seeking this out again."
"Drinkability: A great lager that could be enjoyed in sessions. The creaminess comes out as the beer warms. A very pleasant surprise of a beer. I would certainly revisit."
"Overall, not a bad brew at all and I could see this as a macro-drinking friend converter."
"This beer sort of reminds of a somewhat hoppier, more flavorful version of Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Not bad at all."
"This one came highly recommended by the new clerk at the counter at Carrolltown Liquors. Not disappointing. Poured crystal gold to amber in the glass with a nice, cream-colored head that laced the glass nicely. Caramel malt with a hint of citrus hops in the nose, taste was a touch sweet but rich malt with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Nothing too complex, nothing too simple... Just a very nicely balanced lager with somewhat more carbonation than expected (a nice surprise). This one is a keeper. Can't wait to try the other Starr Hill varieties (new to our area)."
"Drinkibility: Well balanced. Nothing outstanding."
"D: A very nice Vienna Lager from Starr Hill. Finely balanced and extremely quaffable. Sessionable for sure. This is an underrated style, in my opinion, and beers like this one only make me more sure of that."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker glass. The lager appears a clear medium copper color with about an inch of bone white foam. Nose and flavor are of lightly toasted grains and bread, grassy, somewhat bitter hops, sweet malt. Inviting mouthfeel, easy to drink, good amount of carbonation for the style. Not bad."
"This beer is solid, but definitely not the best Vienna lager I've had."
"D: Nice, drinkable session beer. Not overly flavorful, but pleasant and holds its own in this style category."
"I've got this beer on tap right now in a 1/6 keg in my kegerator. It is a surprising departure from the bottled version. While i do enjoy this VA brew in the bottles, it was much fuller and drinkable from the tap. The carbonation, or lack there of, is an issue that i have noticed for a number of Starhill beers. But overall this beer has proven to be a good choice to enjoy after work, or whenever."
"I want to thank Starr Hill for coming in to the Mountain State!"
"Drinkability? Every sip I take demands another so I'd say very good. What a nice and solid all around Vienna Lager!"
"Mouthfeel-great tasting, good body almost ale-ish. Medium hops and this reminds me of Blue Point's rosated lager. A great tasting lager from the south, alright! Very drinkable."
"Not as bready as expected, and not too sweet despite its fruity character. Something here left me wanting--maybe a breadier/maltier foundation would've improved it, but overall a pleasant enough lager."
"More flavor here than I gave it credit for at first, and the body seemed to grow a little as I got into it. A very tasty beer, and I'd like to try more from Starr Hill."
"could drink this all night definitely enjoyed this while it was nothing spectacular it was a nice lager offering from a good small brewery."
"I wasn't too impressed by this brew. Has good appearance and auroma but not really a fan of the flavor."
"Jomo Lager comes served in a pint glass with a bone white head that dissipates to barely a glaze of white on the top of a slightly cloudy light amber body. The aromas are malt up front with a floral nose from the hallartau and tettnang hops. The flavors start out with toast mlat character then the hops add a nice earthy floral quality which balance pretty well. The body is closer to medium than most vienna lagers and helped out by just enough carbonation and no more. It almost has a creaminess to it. The website claims 4.6% and I could imagine they certainly pack alot of flavor into that 4.6."
"A quite drinkable VL, a beer that rivals Sam Adams Boston Lager. If you like to support locals, you should probably grab a 6'er of this over a 6'er of Boston Lager. I took a sip out of the bottle and it's pretty good from there as well. A good beer to bring to a party. Just barely sessionable. Recommended."
"Solid beer that I would recommend to anyone just looking for a good, simple brew."
"Drinkability: A good, drinkable brew, not too complex, not too high in alcohol - just a good lawnmower beer. I've had a few skunky or skunky-esque bottles, so be careful of freshness on this one - fresh though, I'd recommend it."
"I've really come to like the brews from this ""local"" brewery. This one is no exception. Great beer that I recommend you give a go."
"Very drinkable. Nicely constructed, with no glaring flaws. A fine lager!"
"D: Very drinlable in any quantity, any occassion."
"Poured lighter than your normal vienna lager,more of medium golden with a slight tinger of burnt orange,a nice almost creamy-like head atop that never completely settled.Wow the aromas a very metallic and iron-like, honestly I dont think I have had a beer come close to that before.To go along with the iron quality there is a pleasant floral hop not and a bit of caramel.Flavors are as crisp as a cracker and quite dry with just a hint of sweet dough,a honest to goodness peppery hop snap in the finish.This could be drank all day,the aromas are one sided but the beer is quite good,I love a good vienna lager."
"I haven't taken the time to really explore this line given their AB/InBev association and lack of singles, but I've been pleased with the two sampled so far...single bottle from Whole Foods Reston, notched as best by January"
"Perfect carbonation and a reall easy drinker. I am not too familiar with the style but I really dig this beer. I had never heard of Starr Hill until a week ago but so far, all four of the beers I have had are solid beers. This was no exception. Crisp and dry in the finish with more grass in the aftertaste. I could honestly drink this all day and not get tired of it. Another winner!"
"D = This is an enjoyable beer that I can easily imagine serving at a party. Not really special enough to go out of my way for a special event though."
"Poured into a pint glass and received a cider-orange body with a thick, two-finger head that died slowly and left some nice lacings. While I would say some malts come through in the smell, I was impressed with the spring-like, herbal hops aroma and some minor spices like pepper or clove. Not a complex beer, but a medium-bodied beer that goes down smooth and has some minor sweetness on the sides from caramel malt and really packs a hoppy punch. A dry backbite, more akin to a coffee stout or an IPA finish than a regular lager complemented this beer."
"Nice light amber color with a average head in a pint glass. A subtle malty aroma was present and malt was the primary flavor with a balance of hop bitterness. Very drikable-we had several over a couple of hours with dinner. Hope they expand their range to my hometown."
"Drinkability is very good. This works as a session beer, lawnmower beer or with food. I would like to see this as a choice in Virginia resturants. It's up there with SA, SNPA and Yeungling as an everyday beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, honestly I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this beer but I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a very solid and enjoyable beer."
"-Oelergud"
"I originally had this at the Norfolk Tides stadium (Triple A Baltimore team). It was a nice choice in contrast with the other options that were available. It certainly wasn't bad for washing down a hot dog with all the fixins!"
"Drinkability is decidedly average."
"D - Mediocre at best. This one wasn't very impressive, and I probably won't revisit. Stick to their Amber."
"Pours brilliantly clear orange-amber with a big, dense off-white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass. Aroma is bready, malty with some toast character and noble hops. Flavor is a nice toasty-malty character with a counterpoint of sharp noble hops to balance it out. Finish is toasty malt and bread crusts, with some pleasant hop background. Body is on the low side of medium. A little hoppy for a Vienna, but a real nice beer with lots of Vienna toastiness."
"The drinkability is ok, Not a beer I would seek out. MK"
"The body is light with limited flavor. This is where the beers falls with good flavor but limited body. Overall the beer could use more hops and body but a good foundation."
"D: Low ABV and clean, full, balanced flavor makes this a local favorite. My favorite Starr Hill offering."
"Amber to copper clear pour, with a quickly dissipating head. Not an overly aromatic lager surprisingly. Palate gives a slight caramel and citrus taste, although a bit on the bitter side. The hop content seems to be right on with this lager, just enough, and not too much. First Starr Hill beer I've ever had. Not too bad."
"I can't recall a beer of this style that impressed me more than Jomo (Capital's Wisconsin Amber and Winter Skal are good as well). It delivers an impressive amount of flavor, a surprising hoppy kick and a wonderful mouthfeel in a low-ABV package that is ideal for sessioning. I can't wait to see what the rest of the Starr Hill lineup has in store."
"Toasted grains with a nice sweet caramel backbone. Malt backone is slick across the palate leaving a bitterness in the finish and a malty sweetness in the finish. Carbonation is almost too much taking away from the sweet malt profile. Spicy hop notes are subtle but make their way into the flavor. A middle of the road amber/red. Not sure why Starr Hill titled this ""jomo lager"". Low abv=sessionable."
"Overall, this is a flavorful and very drinkable lager."
"This was formerly Mojo Lager, but after a legal battle, they changed the name to Jomo but did not change the beer (Vienna-style lager, brewed with German yeast, 4.4% abw). 12 oz. bottle, best by Feb. '07, served in a pilsner glass. It pours an unfiltered orange/gold with medium carbonation and an inch of tan head that leaves pits as it recedes and deposits lots of lace on the glass. It smells of diacetyl, caramel/toasted/nutty? malts, and some green/herbal hops. The flavor is similar, with a big malt backbone and leafy/green, piney/spicy, floral/perfumy hops that are almost raw, leaving a medium bitterness. I also detect a Simcoe-esque fruitiness, but the website tells me they used all noble hops: Perle, Hallertau, and Tettnang. The body is medium, with matching carbonation and a medium to long finish. Overall a pretty tasty lager but this bottle seems much more American than the first five. No matter, it's a well-crafted Vienna either way you look at it."
"I got this 23 oz. at Malones in Lexington Va. It poured a light brown color and had a lot of head, about 2.5 fingers worth. The head was very fluggy and so was the abundant lace. The retention was nice and slow. The smell was sweet but a little weak. The taste was wonderfully blended. The mouthfeel was very very smooth. This was a solid brew."
"D: Great local find; not the most knock-your-socks-off brew, but a great sessioner with some character."
"Pours a dark golden color with a one finger width head. Smells like sweet malt. The vienna malt is prevalent in the taste of this beer and there is some subtle hop flavors as well. Taste is clean with no noticable off-flavors. Good mouthfeel. A very drinkable vienna lager from one of my favorite brewerys."
"Drinkability: The combination of the sweet and bitter flavors makes for an interesting lager"
"OG. 1.048"
"On tap at the brewpub. It could be slightly maltier. It has little in common with other Vienna Lagers, but that was the style stated at the brewpub."
