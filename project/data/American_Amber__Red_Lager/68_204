3.68,7.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 11/26/2013. Pours crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light fruitiness, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malts, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber lager style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2014"

Old scratch is a medium to dark caramel color. It smells sweet and taste accordingly. It is noticeably more hopped than your average amber lager keeping that sweetness in check. The beer is crisp and perfectly carbonated. The finish is short and hoppy. Easy drinking and delicious check it out.","Theheroguy","Dec 27, 2013"

It pours a deep copper with not much head and poor retention of that, and no observable lacing. Smell is bread, malt, citrus, and roasted nuts. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Taste is very mild with the expected sweetness up front followed by a mild bitter on the finish. The bottle says that the IBU rating is 19.5. It is not all that bitter, but it seems like a little more than that. Still an enjoyable beer, one that would make an excellent session beer.","Mojo","Sep 20, 2012"

The flavor is likewise lightly sweet, with a thin caramel character and a dry breadiness, and maybe some light lemony hops creeping into the finish.

3.62,5.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint at 50 degrees. Pours a hazy burnt red with a bubbly band around the shoulders and a soapy slick across the surface. Band eventually settles into a tight circle with no other foam across the surface - no lacing on this one. Nose is quite malty with hints of caramel/toffee and figs or prunes. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a faint earthy/spicy character that cuts across the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. All and all, a pretty drinkable brew with more character than I anticipated. Well worth a try.","Jwale73","Jun 07, 2011"

The aroma really has a strong malt presence, caramel and slightly grainy - also there seems to be something there that is not overly present but gives a slight stale scent ... as I think about it more it becomes a little more offensive. Too bad because the 12 pack looked to have a sticker that said it was fresh till April of this year. The flavor seems to be pretty good, caramel but maybe a little too sweet? The hops make a quick appearance at the end and then disappears. The carbonation is nice and adds a nice mix with the hops at the end.

I find that we beergeeks are quick to judge all beers based on more complex-smelling and -tasting styles, but we shouldn't forget to judge lagers against other lagers. This is a good example.

It's also somewhat overwhelmed by the maltiness of this beer, leaving my mouth dry.

Nice carbonation bubbles rippling up through from the bottom of the glass. The smell was very nice, lots of grains and cerals, with a hint of some caramel and a touch of bittering pine hops mixed in. A very light off fruit aroma could also be detected after a few minutes. The taste was very well crafted. A good malted back with a good deal of a hop character mixed in. I did not really detect much of a citrus taste at first, but subsequent sips showed this to be more pronounced then I had thought earlier. Very well balanced beer as no particular taste won out over another. Great feel, decent carbonation, but the feel was very smooth and effortless. A little slick, but not distractingly so, rather easy drinking. I could throw down a six pack of these with no time. Definatly a chugger.

Taste is quite malty at first, with grain and grass clippings along with the caramel hints and fruity notes, and a little hop bite in the finish.

Slightly drying american hop aftertaste, with a mild fruity ester and diacetyl character as it warms. The carbonation is low, and the body light to medium. The dryness produced by the hops keeps the ester in check and prevents any noticable slickness. This also provides a fruity/malty finish that will fade and allow a session caliber drinkability.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation with a light body, fizzy on the tongue, leaves some bitterness in the aftertaste.

Nice penetrating caramel with some toffee (remniscent of tamarind) and some faint hop. Taste caramel sweet. Fruity, despite being a lager. The frutis are mild and consist of orange playing off of tangerine. A very sutle Vienna malt (maybe even Biscuit) flavor. Good carbonation, which allows the malt sweet to hang around a bit.

Sweet malt on the next pass, with an odd sourness as well that doesn't quite detract, ripe fruit, and then leafy hops. It smells like Autumn damnit! In the flavour is an odd balance of sweet caramel malts and citric hops, and a curious sourness from the hops as well in the form of a lemon rind tartness. Perhaps the latter is influenced by the yeast. Full mouthfeel that blankets the palate, rich texture. It's definitely not the best sample of the Flying Dog line I've been able to try yet, but the scotch/fall equinox nose and seductive mouthfeel make this a curiosity that I'll probably revisit again, just to see if those two show up to the next party.

The nose combines a delicately sweet and subtly caramelish, toasty maltiness with a nice touch of yeasty fruitiness. It's lightly crisp and then smooth in the mouth with a medium body and carbonation. The flavor reveals a richer maltiness than the nose suggests with some Munich or Vienna malts, and probably a good dose of crystal/caramel as well. Grassy and leafy hops become apparent towards the swallow along with a very nice fruitiness (strawberries, sweet apple, pear); and it finishes lightly sweet and lingering but never cloying - there's just enough bitterness there to keep it from going out of bounds.

Smell is faint of sweet malts, a touch of dulled citrus, melon husk and grape skins. Taste has a grainy, somewhat raw and strangly textured malts, semi sweet, dulled citrus, and lightly roasted, dry, crispy, mildly flavored, not in a watery way, more of weakened effort then anyhthing. Feel is about medium with a very average drinkability. Plain, a bit boring, an average amber.","tavernjef","Nov 03, 2003"

Slightly malty, less hops, a tad of fruit and citrus. Its taste is malty with slight fruit, and light hops. Could stand to be a bit more hoppy, but not too much. This is a medium bodied lager, not very complex but tasty and very drinkable. A card playing kind of a brew. This would be a good choice to introduce to a AB drinker to try and show them the world of beer beyond Bud.","sabrills70","Oct 29, 2003"

It's basically your typical dark lager flavors with just a little more character, probably coming from the steam-style brewing. Of course, that's why Anchor Steam is good for a lager, so it's no surprise.","aracauna","Sep 16, 2003"

Aroma has some zesty lemony tones along with a mild sweetness and caramel malt tones to it very nice aroma pleasant and appeasing to the senses. Flavor has a bit of an alcohol edge to it then a wave of hop bitterness blended with a sharp sweetness created from the malt and mild fruit tones also arise in the finish. Crisp with a nice hop profile that does compare to Anchor Steam on tap however the bottles never seem to travel well from San Fran but I can compare this to the draught version. Mouthfeel from a light to medium bodied beer is slightly syrupy texture with a sharp carbonation to tickle the palate nice. Drinkability not dying for another could easily consume this amber lager purely due to the fact that it does have a really nice flavor profile.","WVbeergeek","Aug 05, 2003"

Mild aroma is lightly sweet with some grassy undertones. Taste is fruity and rather light, with a mild amount of caramel being swept up by some lemon grass hop flavors. Fairly clean finish, but there is a lingering battle between sweetness and bitterness on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, as with over 5% I'd expect a bit of body. Drinkability is OK, but the dichotomy of flavor in the aftertaste wears on me a bit. Almost poured 2 bottles into my larger 1L glass. Glad I didn't, as 12 ounces is enough of this for one night.","aaronh","Jul 31, 2003"

The aroma was mostly malt and some caramel tones are noted. Nothing overpowering with the aroma. The taste was very nice, a straight shot of malt with the caramel notes mixed in giving it a bit of sweetness to the flavor but the hops came in at the end to give it a slightly bitter finish. Over all a nice brew, light body and very drinkable this is the first from the flying dog that I enjoyed!","Stubbie1","Jun 28, 2003"
3.88,13.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours just as it's name calls for, "amber". There is little head, but a nice thin lace. The aroma is of a traditional lager, but with the addition of caramel malts giving it a amber color and aroma. I'm not a particular fan of lager beer due to the fact that most are so simplistic in make up. They hardly ever meander from the regular. The taste is good. I like the amber lagers better than a plain. I guess it must be that there is some malt character although it's still not much. The mouthfeel is good; a low bodied beer. A real booser's beer. A clean finish marks the end of this beer. Not bad, as far as lagers are concerned.","WesWes","Jun 20, 2003"

Lager body, with some of the tartness and bitterness of an ale. I'm not quite sure how the brewer is calling this a "Steam Style" beer. Nothing about this reminds me of a steam beer. I'm guessing that the label art sells the beer. The art is quite good, but the beer is mediocre.","Boto","Apr 30, 2003"

The flavor had the sweet caramel maltiness with a fruity hop flavor. It was light-medium bodied beer, with a medium level of carbonation. It finished semi-dry and bitter.

3.38,-1.2,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"This brew pours a nice, clear burnt-orange amber with an off-white head that reduces to a cap but leaves lace rings nevertheless. The smell is of buttery toffee and tea-like hops. Light-medium bodied mouthfeel. The taste is of caramel malt with a nice dose of herbal/tea and mildly citrus hops and some fruity esters in the background. Unfortunately, a fair amount of diacetyl comes through in mid-palate. I guess this was done on purpose, but it seems wholely out of place...even for a California Common style brew. Fruitiness transforms into a somewhat dry/crisp finish which gives away its "steam" ale/lager heritage.","johnrobe","Feb 14, 2003"

Odd palate. Slightly sticky, yet bitter finish, not very dry. I cant tell if Old Scratch is attempting to expand the realm of what is an Amber-Lager or they have failed miserably at brewing an Amber-Lager. I tilt towards the latter.

Definitely amber, approaching dark side of the spectrum, so they got that right. Head fizzled out and mouthfeel is flat but at the beginning I remember it being fine. Strong piney hops which are the appeal of this beer, giving it a unique character balanced by forceful caramel, buttery malts. Like others have noticed, some ale flavors. This is a good beer, filling and crisp, and it's changed my opinion of Flying Dog after I sampled their unpleasant yogurt-tasting Scotch ale a couple years back.","Thrasher","Sep 03, 2002"
3.18,-7,4,3.5,3.5,2,2.5,"Dark copper in hue w/ brilliant clarity, topped by a one fingered persistent off white head.  Attractive lace is left.  The aroma is a combination of medium caramel malt and resiny citrusy hops, with a hint of sweet fruity esters. Biscuit notes become discernible as the brew warms.  The flavor profile is clean overall and consists of dominant caramel sweetess and bready malt, with mild hop bitterness providing adequate contrast.  Lightly bodied, but with a mouthfeel that's oddly slick and oily (See Portland Woodstock IPA) Finishes with caramel sweetness and more of the oily, tongue coating sensation lingering.  Flavorwise, this is an enjoyable California Common / Steam (lager yeast fermented at ale temps) but the oily mouthfeel and finish was a bit offputting.","marc77","Sep 02, 2002"

Nice copper color, big fluffy head with tiny hop bubbles coming through. Lots of hop smells and some slight sweetness. The taste is pleasantly hoppy, with an equal balance of malty sweetness. Unbelievably pleasant and drinkable, just the right body, balance, hops, and carmel sweetness. I must have got the best of the batch, this stuff was really tasty. Despite my doubts, this brewery is 3 for 3 with me. Just goes to show how many great beers are available, if you just look a little.  I will buy it again.","StevieW","Jun 10, 2002"
