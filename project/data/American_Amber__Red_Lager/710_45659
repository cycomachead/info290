The taste is rather malty with some spices as well. Finishes slightly crisp and I actually think this delivers a better spice flavor than their Oktoberfest.

Pretty Awesome wish I could still do that. I thought it was the best back then but only now recognize it as a gateway beer to better beers. So thanks. Classic Amber is a great looking golden caramel. Pours with a great head that dissipates quickly. Tones of grains and apple. Taste water down but I guess you could make this a hot summer day light session beer.

I don't quite get the artificial citrus element that some seemed to complain about, but I can kind of get a sense of why people describe it this way. It certainly is not the strong, obvious (to me) artificial citrus of things like Leinenkugel's own Sunset Wheat or Lost Coast's Great White. Compared to some other basic, American amber/red lagers (like Dundee's Honey Brown, which I find far inferior to this), this is pretty good but like the others it really is little more than a more caramelly pale lager in character.","Offa","Apr 25, 2009"

3.25,4.8,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Purchased at Bruno's at the Summit in Birmingham. Nice amber color to this one with a slight off-white head. Smells malty with very little hops coming through. The taste is exactly the same. While malty and decently flavored, there are not many hops present at all. I would not be quite as harsh in my review if the label hadn't proclaimed 4 kind of hops inside. I just can't find them. On a brighter note, this beer is drinkable and sessionable. Still better than most big macro brews.","BeerMark","Mar 12, 2009"

3.13,1,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"I'm not going to detail every aspect of this new "flavor" of Leinies. It's been reported that this beer is being "slotted" (by Leinies) as competition against Sam Adams on the national scale. I found it to be very 'generic' for a "micro" or "niche" brew. Flavor's OK, nothing outstanding. Drinkable. To me though, it's just "beer", nothing that justifies the price point it's being marketed at. I'm willing to pay a premium for some of their specialties (Oktoberfest, Creamy Dark), but IMO, this isn't "special", and shouldn't be priced as such.","Bloodfury","Mar 07, 2009"

2.9,-6.5,4,1.5,3,3,4,"D - Easy to drink, ABV is manageable and the flavors are light. Carbonation is a downside here as I feel it becoming very filling and bothersome to the mouth.","katan","Mar 06, 2009"
3.13,1,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a pale crystal clear amber with a large off white head bubbles form quickly and collar of lace is left in thin uneven formations. Aromatics offer up a mildly sweet light toasted malt character with just a kiss of citrus hops. Flavor is quite disappointing same Leinenkugel generic "craft" brew flavor. Some sweet malts divide with a touch of herbal and citrus hops, 100 percent malt with actual hop character let's kick this up a few notches and do away with the Leine yeast strain. Defnitely unoffensive in every way, body is extremely light and somewhat fizzy but not cloyingly so. Goes down smooth pretty effortlessly, it just hits as more of the same.","WVbeergeek","Mar 06, 2009"

2.81,-9.4,1.5,3,3,3,2.5,"This beer pours a clear gold color. I guess Leinenkugel wants me to believe "classic amber" is actually gold. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing quickly. The aroma is of the same generic caramel malt that is present in most of Leinies beers. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, this beer tastes very similar to Leinies other beers. Dull would be a good word to describe it. I can't see myself drinking this one again.","KarlHungus","0"

I really like Liene beers they are pretty good, the summer brew is one of the great beers that I have had. I really would like to try the different beers that are offered by Lieni. I am sure It would be one of the best beers ever.","skeetermoses","Beers"
