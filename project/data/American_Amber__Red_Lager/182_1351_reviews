"Pours a nice copper color off white head very bready smell light malty taste with a little bit of bitterness not over powering though overall I pretty good beer for the price"

"Best cheap beer around ever."

"Overall, Yuengling is a class-act American style beer. I have graded this beer on what its purpose is, as I think is only fair. It's a damn-sight better than budweiser, and it should be recognized as such. If I ever get some foreign friends together I'm taking them to Quaker-Steak & Lube and we're getting a Lube-Tube of Yuengling. THAT is what this beer is to me. Of course it's for easy drinking. It has an easy-open cap for crying out loud. No bottle-opener required, and that's for a good reason."
"This is a Open bar beer."

""
"This beer along with Moosehead Lager are my two top session beers."
""
"An Above average beer good for sessioning, best out of can"
""
"Average everyday beer, good for drinking casually at a bar when others are not available."
""
"O - Very familiar but hadn't had one in years. It was refreshing. Not bad for a sessionable, cheap beer."
"If you are drinking bud you may want to reevaluate your beer buying and give Yuengling a go."

"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a clear dark copper/brown color with a cream-colored sudsy head that dissipates rather quickly.  Minimal lacing detected.  Good looking pour.  Nothing too strong on the nose with some caramel and roasted corn, a little bit of barley husk.  Taste is surprisingly complex given the weak nose.  Immediately picked up the sweetness of the beer with caramel and nuttiness.  This gave way to floral notes of apple and pear followed by some pleasant bitterness that gave it a clean, crisp finish.  Flavors are well crafted.  Great bang for the buck."
"Tried it in Alabama, feels weird in mouth, but decent flavor, not high hops"
"12 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 12/11/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, apple, pear, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly clean for a lager, there is some fruitiness present, but not too much. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice Vienna lager style. All around good robustness and balance of dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"This is my basic go-to beer. Nice body, solid taste. A great lager."
"My go to Beer. Outstanding"
""
""
""
""
"Look is a rich amber color. Smells of a sweet roasted caramel malt. Well balanced taste of a old-style larger. Feel is medium-bodied and quite drinkable. Overall, this is my go-to beer at most eateries if they don't have any better medium-bodied import (it seems to be available everywhere except pool-halls for some reason) and one of the few mainstream American Largers I'll drink (along with Sam Adams)."
""
"If you are into adjuncts this one os no better or worse than most"
"I'm not sure if this tasted amazing because I had just finished 4 months of basic training in the Army or what, but I have a soft spot for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't know why people think this is good. It tastes bad, even for a lager."
""
""
""
""
"An East Coast classic/northern Midwest classic"
""
""
"Don't bother trying this beer."
"It's better than Bud or Miller."
""
"My go-to bargain beer.  A golden tanned color, with a light hoppy taste makes this beer go down smooth.  Definitely a great beer I would recommend to anyone."
""
""
"Nice clear amber color.  The head is foamy and fleeting with some lacing.  Grains along with some adjuncts in both the flavor and smell.  Minimal hopping noted.  Very smooth mouth feel although just a bit an the watery side.  Very good carbonation level makes for easy drinking.  For an expensive adjunct lager this is a pretty decent beer that is great after a day working outside or while working the BBQ."
""
"If your palate has not been manipulated at this point, then this standard lager is pretty much as good as it gets in the Macro world. Drinks must better than most American lagers."
""
""
""
"Seems to be the beer of choice for other fellas to pick up during hockey tournaments, or at least for the last few. Sitting at the hotel, BS'ing about the days events isnt' the best time to crack open a ton of crafty brew. So instead I'll join in on this limp nosed yet grainy on the malt lager. Mouthfeel is a little to think to be considered crisp in my opinion and works as a governor for drinking far better than light beers."
""
""
"I have to give a review because my rating was too low. I mean, it's better than your Bud, Coors or Miller....but not by much. It's the go to beer, when you don't want to drink good beer."
""
""
"Great lager with strong beer flavor. Very smooth with a clean finish."
""
""
""
""
"I know this beer has a long, storied history, but it just is not great."
""
""
""
""
"Dark gold/copper color with thin white head and good clarity; floral notes; lite floral and bread with sweet malt finish; very drinkable lager."
""
"Old faithful.  When you want a beer, but don't want to get craft twisted."
"Since I live about 45 min. from where it's made, every bar around has Yuengling Lager on tap,and at a good price. It's normally referred to as ""Lager"" I.E.(I'll have a Lager please.) I'ts a really good overall beer, lots of flavor, goes well with most food. Definitely a good go to beer!"
""
""
"Overall, for some reason, people love this beer.  At least amongst more commercial drinkers, and especially those hailing from any corner of Pennsylvania, people can’t seem to get enough.  I guess you’ve gotta root for the home-team, right?!  Ehh.  For your more craft-tilted consumer, you will find little to hang your hat from in either major area, from aroma to taste.  This is your classic, basic, simple adjuncty beer, with a slightly danker and toasty twinge due to its “amber” background.  Thinking honestly here, most of you reading this have probably had a Yuengling or two in your day, as it is certainly a stepping stone into the craft realm.  Having rated everything else available at our hotel bar in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, we took this as a rating nightcap, as we’d realized we hadn’t yet written it up yet.  We’ll probably grab this at a wedding if there is nothing better to drink, be it either malted beverages or spirits, but it otherwise won’t soon meet our palate."

""
""
"Shared a pitcher while bowling. This really isn't a bad beer at all, considering the style. I'm not going to go into depth describing this one, but it's way better than BMC options. It's a great choice when the options are very limited."
"Taste is practically non-existent. Background lager flavor at best."
""
"My goto beer when I don't have any craft brews or homemade. Better than cheap miller or bud any day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great lager. One of my favorites."
""
"Pours clear, amber color.  Almost no head.  Smoky-citrus aroma.  Malty flavor that's not too heavy.  Slight lacing.  This beer is good, and I drink it often since it's widely available in my area.  However there's a malty aftertaste which I find undesirable, so I can't rate this one too highly."
"Only if dehydration is beginning to be life threatening."
""
"Decent lager that has a more substantial character than Budweiser but still trashy.  Not enjoyable for me."
""
""
""
""
"Cheap, tastes good. Very drinkable. Good alternative to the big three breweries."
"Was always my beer of choice, until I started experimenting with craft beer (good beer)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as cheaper beers go this one could be worse. Its the best option when drinking with less seasoned beer drinkers."
""
""
"Old faithful here. Used to be my ""everyday"" beer and were it not for a more curious beer appetite, probably still would be. Easy to drink, tastes much better than anything coming out of St. Louis or Milwaukee."
""
" there are not a ton of different flavors to decipher as you drink this one it is just a good simple smooth drinking beer that can be bought most places for pretty close to the cost of cheaper light beers."
""
""
""
""
"Looks like America but it feels, tastes, and smells like college. Overall I have the feels."
"Classic Amber lager, proud from PA"
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is an decent beer, one that I enjoy, with decent, non-offensive, but not great either flavors of toasted malt, corn and caramel-like sweetness.  It’s a good gateway into craft beer, beer, a good golf course beer, a good tailgate beer, and a good non-BMC restaurant beer.  I’ll never turn one down, but I’m not picking up a six to bring home either."
""
""
"Good beer, not great. Save this for friends who do not appreciate a decent craft beer!"
"It's a great beer, I don't care what you say"
""
"Overall, this is a simple but tasty lager that's available damn near everywhere for the same price you'd pay for something like Budweiser or Miller Lite (or even less, in some cases) without the ""I'm giving money to a soulless worldwide megacorporation"" guilt you might feel from buying one of those beers.  Even if it's not one of your favorites, you have  to appreciate that there's decent beer available at a great price.  I was a little afraid I wouldn't like this one as much after trying some of the great beers I've stumbled across in the past month or so, but it turns out I had nothing to worry about--if  anything, I might actually appreciate Yuengling's traditional lager a little more now than I did back before I'd tried more exotic beers like Belgian dubbels and IPAs.  The only thing I'd ever change about this one is the smell, because... yeah, that's a bit funky.  Now, off to finish the rest of this huge can!"
""
""
""
"It is a middle of the road macro lager for me."
"O: nice and easy sessionable American Amber lager that's relatively affordable and always easy to get. I really can't hate on it."
"Sadly, I can't find it as much here in far West TX"
""
""
""
"This used to be my go-to beer in college, but now that I've moved from Georgia to Missouri, I can no longer get Yuengling easily. After a few years not drinking this, I found trying it again refreshing. It is smooth but not bland, making it the type of beer I would want when I am not in the mood for anything in particular."
""
""
""
""
""
"one of my first beers outside of miller lite, thanks for helping me change!"
"Great drinkable every day beer. Especially good on tap"
""
"Just the best all around lager when balancing taste, refreshingness, heaviness, and cost."

"Really good beer from pa"
""
"Always smell and taste skunked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer was pretty good."
"This smelled and tasted like a skunks ass.  Not sure if that is normal or not, either way I don't care because I would never have another. I can't think of any reason why anyone would choose this beer with so many better options out there."
""
""
"Great nutty flavor that goes down smooth."
""
"Very basic average lager.  Not very flavorful."
""
""
"I am basing this beer off other macro lighter lagers out there. Had this on tap and it was very drinkable, didnt have that skunk/piss flavor that most of these lagers carry. Being from CA I dont have access to this so Im glad I got to try it"
"I'll never stop liking Yuengling as a good, inexpensive beer. It was my go-to in college before I started discovering craft beer, and it remains a beer I'll drink when it's available."
""

""

"O: a nice example of the style;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Thin head, no lacing. Light amber color. Aroma of a slightly skunky grain. Sweet tasting, slight hops and strong carbonation with a grainy & malty taste. Light bodied. Finishes sweet & easy."

"Overall: Well, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't really good either.  The oldest brewery in America Yuengling might be, but in my humble opinion, there are so many better brews out there.  I might try one again in a few years when I've mostly forgotten how mediocre it was, but I won't be coming back anytime soon.  Well, unless I have no better choices, like I didn't have tonight."

""

"Similar to the other comments here, I used to drink this one a lot in my youth and before I got into craft beer. This is my first time drinking it since I've been rating on BA. A nice and refreshing beer. Very clean taste and crisp on the tongue. Not much via aroma; perhaps a slight malt. However the taste has a good deal of character. A very pleasant change of pace beer."

"I give it a 4.25 because even though it is my favorite, I still reserve higher listings for truly perfect beers, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - the current dominant American Craft Masterpiece."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Will always get a 4 in my book because its the best beer for your price that money can buy. The bar I frequently go to and watch the Eagles play on Sundays sells $2 domestic beers, so my choices are Bud, Bud Lite, Miller Lite and Yuengling, its not even a question i take Yuengling. Always has that dark amber appearance, great smell, great taste and drinkablity where u can drink them all day long. Any time i complain about living in the NJ/PA area i always remember i have access to cheap Lager!"

"I'm very grateful that this beer has become a year-round delicacy in my state. A beer that's suitable for any season and is perfect when paired with a burger or a summertime cookout smorgasbord. A quality beer for $6 a sixer? You can't beat that."
""
"Yuengling beer is not meant to be a get drunk beer. Its meant to taste great. I go to department stores and can't always find something good in a case. Its always a 12 pack or 6 pack. I got a case of Samuel Adams, and the beer was to strong for me to like. Then there's the 36 packs for 20 dollars that don't have a good taste. Its like I have to force myself to drink. I like Yuengling because its in the middle. Kind of disappointed that there's not a lot of alcohol in it, but hey, for everything else, its good"
"Dark orange amber color. Smell is a little hoppy. Sweetish malts. Medium carbonation. Taste is malty yet strong bold hop but not bitter. Have had many and will have many more in the future"
"Great beer if you're looking for a better taste than Coors, Miller, and Bud Light. I keep a stock of it in my fridge for grilling or just to watch football games."
""
"Overall (3.91) : If Yuengling traditional was sold over here in South Dakota, I'd probably be buying this regularly. It still doesn't beat out Grain Belt Nordeast, as it's a little more watery, less creamy. However, for what it is, it's a pretty darn good amber lager."
""
""
"This is my ""go to"" cheaper beer.  Easy to drink and great taste for the price."
"Good cheap beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally found a beer that I can actually drink, enjoy."
"Yuengling is simply the best domestic beer available, regardless of can,  bottle, or keg. Yuengling is a standby for all those that just want a good lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good cold and wet kinda beer, and can't really beat it at $17-$18 p/case after taxes."
"Perfect session beer. Enough flavor to make it worth drinking. But cheap and easy to pound. I always try to keep Yuengling's in the fridge at all times, good beer for when guests come over. Nobody doesn't like Yuengling and it's cheap."

"I can't get ""Lager"" where I live so when I'm in a region where I can, I drink it like it's my job."
"Floral, slightly caramelly sweet malt aroma, with notes of toasted bread. There's a metallic note, along with light green apple. Flavor reveals that metallic note, acetaldehyde, and banana, underlying throughout. Toasted notes dominate the finish. Upfront, there's a light caramel sweetness. Lots of off flavors, but more characterful than most macros."

"In the areas it's available, this is an excellent alternative to the BMC lagers. It's cheap, easy to find, and pleasant enough to make for a good drinkable go-to in that region."

"My go-to beer when I stand in the beer isle and can't decide what to buy. The best thing about it is that it's America's oldest family owned and operated brewery that's still going strong after all these years. Taste is overall really good in that you can actually taste this beer when you compare it to something like Bud Light or Miller."

"Great low cost straight up lager beer. Like Budweiser only actually good. They still sell it at a super low price in coal country in Pennsylvania because that's who supported them their first 160 years (it was basically a local brew in that area - didn't even make it down to Philly until they came out with Black and Tan).  Awesome no bs session beer."
""
""
"But it is certainly refreshing."

"Always a go to for me, local guy,enjoying a local favorite"
""
""
""
"Pours an orange/ dark yellow with a very fizzy head. The smell was pretty subtle with mostly toasted malt coming through, but also some citrus. The taste was pretty bland to be honest with the malt coming through at the end and not much to say about the beginning and middle. Soon coming to CT and everyone is amped for it, but I just can't seem to understand the hype."

"Overall: This was absolutely unfamiliar to me a few years ago and now it is my guilty pleasure anytime I visit Pennsylvania. Although it has been said before, Ill say that this is the crappiest beer a craft drinker can enjoy and the nicest beer a macro drinker can enjoy. This to me is the perfect american adjunct lager. When I visited the tour in Pottsville they proudly boasted of using American corn grits in the malt bill. This is cheap beer done right, it is full of flavor and has a beautiful appearance. The clean, crisp finish makes you beg for another. After having it in many forms I personally prefer it best just straight from the can."
""
""
"When confronted with these choices (Bud Lite; Coors Lite, Budweiser; Yuengling Traditional Lager) at a recent going-away party for a new sailor, I chose the Yuengling Traditional Lager.  It was the best choice by far. I had never had it before and thought that it might be worth sampling. I was so surprised. This beer is a very nice American lager. It has none of the drawbacks of either light beers, with their insipid, weak so-called flavor, nor the nasty after-taste of Budweiser's King of Beers. I would definitely buy this beer to have a good, standard American Lager on hand. It tastes great, has a nice full feel and a wonderfully clean finish. (Secret: It's a lot better than PBR.)"
"Appearance is a reddish copper. The nose and flavor profile contain the blend of malts with a touch of corny sweetness. The aftertaste lingers a bit too long and is a touch unpleasant."

"PA pride and a damn good beer! one of the first few beers I had. one which I think anyone from pa was probably introduced to early. nothing bad about it...looks, smells and taste great. definitely one of my favorites. in pa, all you have to do is say lager and this is what you get. to most, this is the one."
"The beer looks better than it smells, feels, or tastes."

"One of the first beers I remember Actually Enjoying. These days, on my trips back to PA, I find myself drinking Yuengling out of a can. I grew up drinking Yuengling in a bottle, but the can seems to have a better taste. It may be time for Yuengling to switch to a Brown Bottle. Summer in a Can."

"O: For what it is, it's good. It kicks the tar out of Budweiser and competes at the same price point. One of the better adjunct lagers on the market. Craft beer geeks will never be wow'ed by the style, but it gives you a better option when you're out at the dive bar down the street."

"Yuengling is a good beer in comparison to mass produced beers like coors or bud. It tastes weak compared to good craft beers. It's really all in comparison as to how good you think it is. If you are used to drinking 10 dollar a six pack craft beer, it's going to be bland. If you drink run of the mill beers, it is going to be a joy to drink and have a lot of flavor. Over all, better than nothing."

"O: Like I said before, this one is a go-to for a cheap beer when you have to beer and can't find something interesting. Leagues behind other basic craft beer staples like Fat Tire, Boston Lager or maybe even Magic Hat (though I'm not a big fan of that beer's fruit flavors - but I digress) while being a thousand times better than your average macrolager. I'd even pick this one over some macro imports like Newcastle, Beck's, Stella or Carlsberg."

"Yuengling Lager is my goto beer when I want something good, but not special. I found this beer after moving to Florida. They have a brewery in Tampa, yet many local bars still charge import price for it. Worlds better than BudMillerCoors. It is a bit skunky, likely due to the green bottles, with a taste that reminds me of cardboard (only in a good way). There is a bit of hop but the primary taste is malt. I found it makes a mean black-and-tan with Guinness Draft."

"Got a case of this on a recent trip to PA, I sure remember it being better than this. This lager poured a clear amber color with a small off white head that left almost no lacing. The nose was overly sweet just like its other mass produced contemporaries. Flavor was sweet and simple. No complexity just your average big brewery lager flavor. Mouthfeel was light and easy to drink. These aren't bad beers and can definitely be enjoyed on a hot day but after having dived deep into the world of craft beer, they just don't deliver the flavor and complexity that I crave."

"O: It's all about expectations: if you're looking for a bright, bold lager bursting with flavor and full of intrigue, you're going to be profoundly disappointed. If you think that Yuengling is just another bland, fizzy, watery American lager then you're likely to be pleasantly surprised. This is a beer with just enough going for it to make it appealing to thirsty craft beer lovers who somehow find themselves stuck in a BMC bar; it's an unpretentious brew that won't sweep you off your feet, but definitely holds its own and then some against the majority of macros out there. Yuengling is a good, economical choice if you're throwing a shindig and want to introduce BMC drinkers to Something Else."

"Yuengling Traditional Lager brewed by Yuengling Brewery. This brew has an ABV of 4.4 and it pours out a dark amber color. Also this brew has a small white head. This is a filtered brew with some carbonation. You can see right though it. I like the look of this brew. Yuengling is a amber/red lager, not an American style lager. The smell is ok, you pick up aromas of grasses, grains and richness. There is little to no lacing on the glass. The taste is smooth and rich with flavor. The Aftertaste is bold with flavor, but it is smooth and rich. There is nothing bad to say about this brew. Yuengling Traditional Lager has a nice balance to it. Mouthfeel is nice smooth with a clean finish. This brew is also crisp and clean. Over ll I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"Overall, the taste doesn't live up to the appearance but a pretty good simple lager that compares well to the big guys. Best to drink this one cold with food like hamburgers, hot dogs, etc."

"I have to give this beer tops all the way. My virgin tastebuds thought it was chinese (because before i knew better i thought it was) and tasted outside of the (now awful) usual bud-light 97% of the losers surrounding me drank. I found it on tap at my favorite watering-hole for $3/pint back in 2012. Maybe it was the price but we began a relationship that brought me to new highs. I visited the tampa brewery back then and really like the fact it was a family that just grew with the demand. It wasn't a corporate brand and to me it seemed like a good thing that did it the right way. I could go on about why I love Yuengling but to me this beer has a place in my heart. It will always be my go-to beer and thats why it deserves 5/5 all the way. It has a slight toasted and subtle caramel flavor. you could drink it all day and not go overboard. it puts you in the right place. The story behind it and the ever expanding dreams of production make it taste better. On tap, in the bottle, or poured into my 180 year anniversary commemorative glass, it all tastes good. Its more American than any beer out there. Its the oldest beer and its quintessentially ( whatever that means) the life-blood of patriots who know a good time. To me theres beers I'll like, new tastes I'll enjoy but they'll always be Yuengling."

"This has become my go to beer as it goes down easy and doesn't have a high ABV. It has a beautiful head that doesn't last. It smells like it tastes which is a good balance between malt and hops, bitter and sweet with an amber ale finish. There are better beers but they're not nearby, they're prohibitively expensive for daily consumption or their alcohol content makes for an early evening. So, while I enjoy the Belgians and Germans etc. Yuengling can be found almost everywhere and I like it after a long day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuengling stands out from other big American lagers with its maltier smell and taste. It also seems to have somewhat more of a slight bitter/funky kick. That's all well and good, but personally I don't find this beer that tasty or even that refreshing (as other lagers can be). It's just meh all around, and the fact that I only see it served in ice cold bottles doesn't really do it any favors either."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – pretty much what I expected. Nice brew to have on a really hot summer day, nice session lager for a BBQ or outdoors event. Nothing too special."
""
"Overall, this beer has become my go to. While trying to balance taste, availability, and cost, yuengling traditional lager finds its way into my fridge quit often. For the money this beer is hard to beat."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, amber color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is mild with grains that puts off a little bit of a cheap musty beer smell. The taste is pretty bold with grains but not the most appealing to the taste buds. There is a little bit of a sour twang flavor in the middle that doesn’t appeal to me but gives Yuengling that distinct flavor that differs it from Bud and Miller products at generally the same price in the market place."
""
""
"pours a rich amber color about a one finger head that faded quickly and not any lace to speak of. light fresh smell of roasted malt. taste of roasted malt with a touch of caramel also very dry. mouthfeel light, crisp lots of carbonation. heard a lot of talk about this beer and this is my first time and i will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really did enjoy this beer! It's taste is very appealing and would drink a lot more. It smells like a good beer and tastes like a good beer! I really suck at this review stuff but honestly, it's a damn good beer and I would much rather drink this over Bud Light any day."

"I would classify this beer as a great family gathering beer. Though it sports a sparse diminishing head, the medium amber color is very appealing. Yuengling's light body and smooth mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer for light beer enthusiasts while the unique lightly toasted grain flavor could satisfy many in the craft beer crowd. The fact that this beer is not yet distributed in Michigan only adds to it's allure."
"My older brother and father love this beer, every time we get together my brother brings my dad a six pack. I finally had to try it for myself and I must say I do enjoy it. Nothing really spectacular stands out but overall its just a pretty decent beer. It's relatively inexpensive and for the price I think its a good enough light beer to purchase."
""
"Overall: A great ’go between’ beer to serve from a keg at get-togethers. It is mainstream enough for the light beer crowd, but substantial enough to satisfy all but the most extreme beer snobs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was given a few bottles of this, but research says this in an inexpensive beer. Assuming that to be true, for the price, this is a decent beer. Nothing that is going to outdo the really nice craft beers, but an easy drinking, and fairly flavorful beer. It just tries to be a decent easy to drink beer at a good price, and it succeeds in meeting that goal."
""
""
"Overall: Very clean and tasty. Had this on tap and it was a lot better than I remembered. I will try it from a bottle or can and if it still holds up, I may have this as a regular affordable beer."
""
""
"O-a personal favorite a definite go to affordable beer doesnt get much better for the price"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuengling is my favorite Marco brewed larger so far. I've had in both in the bottle and poured into glasses. It only produces a small head when poured. The appearance is light in color, and it has a good mouthfeel and taste. This is the beer you will see me drink most often. A winner in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew is great, for what it is. It's the best tasting adjunct brew to date. When Yuengling first started distributing in OH I was all over it. A great cheap brew that makes A-B and M-C taste like rice and corn. I buy it all the time, my favorite mass produced domestic brew so to speak. Are there better beers? YES. but not for this price. A-B and M-C six packs go for $6.29 in my area. Easy decision."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I should say that American adjunct lagers are not my style of beer. Having said that I think that this beer was less offensive than most. I could see how this could be thirst quenching on a hot summers day, but there is not much flavor or complexity here."

"O: a bit more hoppy than the standard AB/Miller/Coors lager but, despite the darker color, lacking in malts."
"My go to any time beer. A truly attractive lager."
"Overall: An American classic, and a beer I've really been looking forward to trying. If this was distro'd in my area, I would definitely use it as my go-to cheap beer or party beer. This has much more flavor than BMC macros, but is competitively priced with those sorts of beers. A beer everyone should have at least once, if just for the history of it."

""

"Decent Amber Lager that straddles the line between the adjunct macros and higher quality craft lager offerings. Slight off characters from the yeast but the higher emphasis on malts and hops brings this above poorly crafted lagers. I would still take any of the lighter Jacks Abby lagers over this any day of the week."

My motto is, every beer has it's place. This beer does have a place. In my fridge! Next to my Belgian Strong Darks. This brew is worthy!"
""
""
"Overall: This tastes like a watered down Elliot Ness to me, but that's not at all a bad thing. I could have this as my every day go to ""cheap"" beer and be okay with it. This beats the hell out of anything around its price range (BMC) and is great for what it is. For $16 a case, this is by far my favorite ""cheap"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Along with Samuel Adams and New Belgium's Fat Tire, I think this Lager is the benchmark for macro lagers. Very drinkable and refreshing. Also quite fascinating as it pre-dates the civil war. In my humble ""Craft Newbie"" opinion, It's as close to a craft as a mass-produced lager can get."

"Once again, this isn't a world beater. It isn't going to hold its own against a huge Russian Imperial Stout or some other monster of a brew, but that's not what it's designed to do anyway. This is an adjunct American lager, and if one compares it to others of that style, this comes off looking quite good. I would say it's my absolute favorite of the style, being everything it should be -- easy to drink, tasty, palate-cleansing, refreshing, inoffensive -- and nothing it shouldn't -- sour, so carbonated it bites back, gassy, etc. There are times when a big, heavy brew just isn't what you want, when you feel more like an easy to drink lager that will satisfy you without having to deal with a taste that turns your stomach. In my opinion, this really can't be beat for those times. It's a style that gets no respect among craft drinkers and beer geeks, especially new ones who feel that now that they've discovered ""real"" beers they have to denigrate ""that nasty cheap stuff", and for the most part, the style deserves a bit of that. This brew stands out from that crowd in a great way. Not world class, but best of its class."

""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"O: Well, its not bad. I still prefer my 'Gansett Lager or Schlitz as a go to cheap session type brew. But I understand why people living in PA have a regional fondness of this beer. In the end however its really just an average beer but definitely a step above a macro lager. Like any beer though it has its place and time. Cheers."

"Granted, it's not mind blowing or life changing, but if I'm going to have a non-macro offering that's closer in flavor profile to beers belonging to macro companies rather than one belonging to the recent wave of delicious lagers that have flooded the craft market as of late, this will be the one I will in indulge in. Simple, yet well built in sweetness, graininess, and even bitterness, I do wish we got this beer out west whenever I had the craving for a beer of its type."

"Overall: Having moved to PA I feel like I now must appreciate Yuengling by default, though I enjoyed plenty of Yuengling before moving to the state. A cut above BMC in my book."
""
""
"Overall, it's OK for an amber lager, but certainly better than comparably priced BMC swill. It has some character, albeit mild character. It can grow a little sweet after one or two bottles, but I think the same can be said about most lagers, particularly ambers."
"Appears a very light amber color, clear with a thin head. Smells bready with hints of alcohol. Taste is light malt forward with a slight metallic aftertaste, light mouthfeel. Very simple and very little hop character. This used to be a novelty beer for me, when you couldn't get it around here and my Pennsylvanian friends would import it. Now that it's in every drug store, it's just a decent cheap beer to put in the fridge when my brother in law is coming over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful amber with good clarity and a head of loose but creamy foam that falls fast. Nose is enticing with a light sweet grain , a touch herbal and grass, plus a bit of light citrus faintly in the background. The taste is darn good. This beer has a mouthfeel that is light and thin but a flavor that is very full. The citrus stays int he background and the bitterness from the grass is light. The sweet grain comes close to caramel but stops appropriately and stays a crisp and very clean lager. Sweet, grassy and light with plenty of flavor. You could drink this all day."

"		 “You know – Yuengling”"
"Amber brown in color with quarter inch thick white head. Light caramel and pale malt is what I get from the aroma. The mouth is somewhat creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. The front of the palate is caramel and light malt with just a bit of buttering hops and the creamy smooth lagered finish."

"Yuengling is a beer for all seasons. Robust enough for the cold months, and refreshing enough for the heatwaves. Beautiful crispness and bite with each swig, and a nice amber color to complement a beautiful pour. But forget that man, this is enjoyed right from the bottle. When its ice cold it is delicious and dangerously drinkable. As it warms you get more of the hop bite which is pretty cool. Definitely a beer you can drink 12 of or enjoy with a meal. Yuengling is a terrific beer, in my opinion a perfect beer. I could drink this year round. Living in the northeast, the scarcity and mystique of it only adds to its legend. My favorite beer."

"I appreciate what is considered to be Americas's oldest brew. There is a bit of nostalgia in it for me as I experienced a Yuengling on a spring break trip with an uncle that is no longer living. Smooth taste that leaves no bad after taste and the tradition keeps me coming back for more. I look for it and when I find it I usually get a sixer."

"One of the first beers I had that wasn't a BMC. This is my go-to beer when I'm low on funds but still need to drink something with flavor. I realize it's not comparable to any craft brew but it's light years ahead of a typical AAL. The flavor is there but it almost disappears before you realize it was there. The flavor is almost smokey but still smooth. I feel like this beer is what you would get if you added a few ounces of water to a Sam Adams Boston Lager. Overall, a good buy and worth trying if you have the opportunity."

"DATE TASTED: August 24, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. pilsner glass... OCCASION: last revisiting the old classic...had too much at cousin Missy's wedding last night--cheers...APPEARANCE: uneven, variably sized bubbles lodge and flutter in a brown-orange body; two-finger head settles to an off-white iced tea head that does not lace... AROMA: scents of peanut and toasted bread in the malty profile; hops provide little other than some funky undertones...PALATE: like medium-bodied, this begins with some strength but ends oily in the throat; aftertaste more than lingers...TASTE: definite bread amid vegetable elements; a bit of bubblegum too... OVERALL: a Northeastern PA sessions staple--one can order by simply saying ""lager"" in most establishments; this profiles as a beer with a strong odd-tasting dimension; relatively easy-drinking and very affordable, the lager ranks above mass-marketed faux pilsners but below many craft lager offerings; the label reminds us this beer was pioneered when colors (amber, in this case) were the distinguishing aspect of the industry..."
"Overall, this is the beer you chose when you're parched after a day in the yard and need to chug a few to quench the thirst. It's by no means a thinking beer. It's far better than the BMC crowd, but can't hold a candle to most ""craft"" offerings. If you happen to like this, enjoy it, and know the brewery is a family owned operation, good people, and does a lot for their community."

"I used to travel to the coast and down to Florida to get a draft Yuengling. It was worth the trip. The beer pours a good amber, the taste is very nice with food and it feels good holding it in my mouth for a short swallow. I don't drink American beer as a rule, but there are a couple of regionals that I always enjoyed and this is one. I hope mass producing it doesn't ruin it. This is a drinkable beer, not great, but for a buck during Happy Hour you can eat some good seafood along A1A at Melbourne Beach, FL."
""
"Had this one back in Florida many times, both in the bottle and on tap. Hard to find here in the Mid-West as I haven't seen it in 5 states. Did find a 6-pack while in Jackson, Tennessee a few weeks back. Sampled 8/29/13 for this review. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Pours in a pool-ball pislner glass (#13). From American's oldest brewery, 1829. Contains 4.4% alcohol (not on label). Pours a pretty copper/bronze color with a small creamy tan head that leaves some lacing when sipped. Lots of bubbles streaming up from the bottle of the glass, but perfect carbonation actually. The aroma is of grains and corn. The taste is pretty much the same with a hint of caramel and very easy to drink. No harsh aftertaste."
""

"Yuengling is my go-to beer of choice. It is a great all-around lager. In fact, where I grew up (in eastern PA) the words ""Yuengling"" and ""lager"" are pretty much interchangeable. I'm happy that it is now brewed in Florida as well, though I have concerns that the taste will be different - possibly due to the water used. Will have to see."

"All this gave these guys a huge sense of Pride,and Yuengling Brewery has that same kind of Pride when it comes to making their Beers,there is not one other American Macro brewed Beer that taste anything like a Yuengling,it is VERY Distinctive,and taste more like a Euro Lager then a standard American brewed Macro Lager,and IMHO,it is more or less Impossible to beat flavor wise in it's price range,Dollar for Dollar,you get a very well crafted Macro Lager for your money with Yuengling,and I have to give this Brewery a LOT of Respect,a lot of Respect Indeed,because I think Yuengling is in a league all it's own~Cheers!"
"As much as I love to expand my beer horizons with craft beers at times, Yuengling Traditional Lager is always my go-to beer. Where I live, if you ask for a lager, you get a Yuengling by default. It has a great combination of taste and smell, and it is a relatively smooth beer to drink, which makes for an easily drinkable beer without sacrificing flavor. Every time I meet people that do not yet have Yuengling in their part of the country, they always want to bring some home."

"I know that larger breweries tend to get very negative reviews, but this beer, in my opinion, is by far the best beer for the money. What more can you ask for in a beer that costs the same as Bud Light. It is also easily found in stores, at least here in Tampa, where they have their second brewery. I am not affiliated with the company, but sincerely think this is the best beer to drink on a regular basis. The color, smell, taste and carbonation is near perfect, and is a very drinkable beer. Sometimes I drink it out of a glass, and other times I drink it out of the bottle. When I go to a restaurant that has it on tap, I get it on tap, and it is awesome. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy local brews and micro-breweries, but this is my ""go to"" beer. Cheers!"

"Miles ahead of BMC, still well behind good craft beers. It is excellent at what it is, an alternative to mass produced American light beer swill.

"Mostly sweet caramel and malt on the nose, with a tinge of banana and cheap beer smell. Maybe a tiny hint of roast as well. Fairly layered and “complex” for a beer in the cheap-ass lager category. The flavor here seems somewhat lacking compared to what the nose offers. There is only a small bit of that sweet caramel up front, but that flavor soon turns to a slightly sour cardboard impression that lasts throughout the lengthy finish."

"Yuengling is a beer you gotta pour a little hard to get a decent head but it will pour bubbley white head that dies down to thin ring. Its very brown copper color, also clear see thru. It smells carmal, grains, citrus. Moslty a grain smell though. The taste is very smooth a roasted malt with a hint of carmal and more grain. I used to be able to tatse more corn grits in this but not so much now. A little more bitter then ur nomal adjunt with a little carbantion bite and a tade of the citrus throuh the swallow. I think if u can get yuengling there's really no need for any other cheap adjunt beer. This beer tatse awsome is easy to drink, light but more body then the norm, and very cheap. I seen it cheaper then miller lite most of the time. Draft, cans, bottles pour it in a glass or drink it straight out of the can or bottle its good ethier way."

"When you first crack open a can of yeungling traditional lager you hear the hiss of the carbonation escaping into fresh air. The tightly sealed sacred nectar awaiting. The thick foamy lager is a must for any season. Upon taking your first sip you can feel the carbonation tart your tounge in sourness. Overall it's a great beer. While not a summer craft or seasonal Sam Adams it tops my list as #3 of my all time favorite summer beers."

"O: Not sure why others have rated it so low. I believe that anyone that is west of the lucky states that get it, see it as such a rarity that it is a delicacy. Well, I'm here to tell you I have been having it for about three years now... and it is one of my favorites."

"O: Being from Pennsylvania, if you go to bar (namely one that doesn't specialize in craft brews) and ask for a lager, a cold Yuengling is what you'll get. I'll be the first to admit that I am 100% okay with drinking this one. Most of my buddies don't go to craft bars, so Yuengling is typically my savior from the BMC light beers. Take Yuengling for what it is: a basic lager that is light years ahead of most macros in quality and drinkability."

"If your from Pa and go to a bar and say you want a ""lager"" expect to get Yuengling Traditional."
"Anyways when poured it comes out in my glass with an amber brownish color. Following a nice head. Even the head tastes good without it being overpowering in the glass. But it definitely lets you know its there. The smell is reminiscent of a good lager. Hints of barley, malts, and something I can't really put my finger on. Tastewise...I may get some ball busting for this but to me it tastes like if Sam Adams Boston Lager had a baby with Miller Genuine Draft. Very well brewed with some bite to it. Through the bottles there isn't too much carbonation so it works well in the mouth. Overall Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager is one of the best beers out there. There aren't any other beers I would drive 200mi+ there and back to buy or pay extra for someone else to get for me. Easily one of the best lagers I've ever drank. If given the chance I do recommend trying Yuengling Lager. You won't regret it."

"Poured from a bottle into a mug. Ill try and keep my PA and bias out of this review. I used to drink this throughout college and growing up. Now as a real review, the beer is pretty average and good overall brew to have for a party. One finger head that quickly expires after a few minutes. Almost zero head retention. No real noticeable smell, a little malt, some floral notes I guess. Almost a chemical type nose and mouthfeel. I get large carbonation feel and aftertaste. Almost seems to transition to a watery taste. Maybe my tolerance is now sky high but it tastes more like 2%. I get a little bit of sweetness and some dryness. It's very drinkable, like I said, a good party beer. Decent and inexpensive, brings me back to my college years."

"Yuengling Traditional could be accurately characterized as a Vienna style beer, I think - an amber hue, a bit heavier than a lager, but still refreshing and suitable for my own house beer. It was once available only within a limited area from Pottsville, PA. Now, I am finding it all over the country. Where you find this beer at normal premium beer prices like Bud and other typical American lagers, it is an excellent bargain. I find it selling at import prices in some parts of the country, but it is considered ""local beer"" around Baltimore, making it pretty irresistable as an all-rounder daily brew."

"Great everyday go-to beer. The new but old Budweiser! At least they didn't sell out to a foreign company. It has a full bodied taste without being over powering. Goes down smooth, and clean. We used to be Bud light folks, but now we are true blue Yuengling fans."

"Pours a dark amber/gold color with a frothy white head. Smells mostly of grain. Not much else. Taste is what you'd expect from a beer like this. Mostly a grainy type flavor with a bit of sweetness. A bit of maltyness as well. Not much else. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's light and crisp and easy to drink. Not my favorite cheap go-to beer, but not bad."

""
"This is the beer I ""grew up on", having went to college in PA. It's been 18 years since I was in college, and I still have this beer constantly in my beer fridge. It's a really fantastic lager that can beat or match any other lager out there, including Sam Adams, New Albion, and any others. Really a nice, albeit cheap, lager. But then, there's a reason why they're the oldest continuous brewery in the U.S."

"A Yuengling is what you get if you just order a ""lager"" in Philadelphia. It's the standard, here, and it's definitely not a bad one. The had could be more stable, but besides that, there is simply nothing wrong with that beer. It's well-balanced, lightly (but not impalpably) hopped, with a beautiful amber color. It's not made for beer-snobs that only judge a beer by the amount of hops, but it's an unobtrusive, characterful companion that can be drunk ""every day""."

"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Samuel Adams glass. Pours a nice clear deep amber with a decent creamy white head. The head lingered on throughout and even left a little bit of lacing. Aroma is malty, with hints of caramel and fruit. Taste is about the same, with just a hint of hop bitterness on the finish. There is a little carbonation and the mouthfeel is slightly thin, but not bad and certainly not watery. A solid go-to on the East Coast when not in a craft beer establishment."

"Yuengling Traditional Lager is one of the first beers that I've ever had that got me into ""craft"" or full-bodied American Lagers. As a college student it was tasty and cheap compared to the more premium imported beers. This beer deserves a lot of the credit of bringing me along the way to becoming a craft beer enthusiast."
"I was wondering how an adjunct lager could be so amazing and now I know: it's not one. It's an amber lager, of course. Still, it's quite delicious. Hits the spot impeccably if you're craving a real good lager-style taste. Perfect maltiness, sweetness, and mild bitterness. It even has a kiss of fruitiness to it. This is really great stuff in my opinion. Just the absolute perfect middle-of-the-road mix of lager flavours. You'd be hard-pressed to make something more delicious while remaining so incredibly refreshing. I am getting more and more jealous of the east coast."
""
""

"Poured bottle into pint glass. Nice amber color, big bubble carbonation that reduces to small ring around the glass. No stickyness on the glass. Metalic smell. mild hops. Price is right and you can find this on tap most places. Good staple of a beer to have on hand for parties and picnics."
""
""
""
""
"12oz green bottle, pours light-amber in color and is topped with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are toasted grain, lager yeast, caramel, grassy, metallic. Tastes are rather bland with some caramel, toasted grain, grassy hop. Mouth-feel is thin and watery; metallic but clean finish. Overall, average to say the least."

That's all well and good but, based on this offering, I'll be in no great hurry to try any of their other beers.

"Nothing at all wrong with this, nothing crazy complex, but drinkable and tasty."
"It has a gold, amber color. It has a smooth malt flavor and mouth feel. There's a good carbonation and creamy feel to the beer, but still the finish is lacking and has a bit of a cheap macro flavor."

"Okay, this is not an outstanding beer compared to some in the craft beer world, but this one has sentimental value to me me. It was one of the first ""micro"" brews you could that was not outrageous in price while I was in college. Anyway, the color when poured from the can (I have had this in the bottle and on draft many times but this time its cans, and I do prefer it in cans better) amber not too much lacing but a some head that dissipates quickly. The smell is sweet with some hop character but not a lot, not as much as in bottles but a little skunk in there as well. The taste is over all well balanced for a lager, much better than many in its category and is very sessionable, and I can attest to the many sessions I have had with this one over the years. All in all people may look down on this one but it really is a good beer, it has a great lager flavor and you can drink several without any trouble. Once again this is one of my standby beers if I plan on drinking a several in a night."

"Poured into a pint glass, probably about the 1000th one of these I've had over the years. A nice light head developed and dissipated quickly with little lacing that endured. Appearance was clear and amber with a malty, sweet nose. Taste was malty with toffee hints and a slight hop bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was slightly creamy with a high carbonation effect."

"It's a great slightly heavier alternative to other traditional style lagers. Great rich red/amber color. The smell was a little grainy, but not bad.

"O: Overall, I love it. I'm biased as this is my parents favorite drink and I feel like I subsequently inherited in college and after moving to Philadelphia. It retains a unique taste of care and quality despite prices on par/below local breweries. That and I had the opportunity to meet Dick Yuengling, hes friggin' awesome."

"Why do brewer's still use green bottles? I don't know how much of the off taste was due to the bottle's transparency to UV light. To me the taste of this beer is reminiscent of the skunkiness that I associate with all green bottled beer. Bad. Please use brown bottles! Brown bottles may hurt this beer in that then there would not be an excuse for skunky taste. The mouthfeel, whatever that is, felt like beer. At least this beer did not give me a headache like other cheap beers tend to do."

"Overall: I have always been a fan of Yeungling, always have to go out of my way to get it, but always worth it. Good brew to have with friends, and always better than Bud or Miller."

"This Northeast beer is a well kept secret. Only available in certain states (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida), this is beer comes from the oldest still active brewery in the United States. This Pottsville, PA masterpiece is so good that many of us Vermonters stock up on it every time we go across Lake Champlain to NY. Crisp, dark, versatile lager to be enjoyed all year long. Must try if in the fore mentioned states."

""

""
""
""

"Pours a hazy orange-red with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some skunky aromas that fade out as the beer warms up, bringing out a sweet caramel aroma. Taste is of malt, grain, and a slight caramel flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer for the style but it's drinkable for what it is."
""

"Although it is regional, I will search it out again, (and it's fun to say)."

""
""
"Overall - to be honest this is my go to drinking beer when I'm watching football or going to house parties. I love the price, and although the flavor isn't tremendous, I still enjoy it."
"Overall - This beer is highly recommended, for a variety of reasons. It is good, it is relatively cheap, and it stays close it the microbrew roots, rather than selling out and tasting like pisswater. It is a good introductory beer for the macro crowd, nothing too extreme or offensive, but yet like nothing they have likely every had. Although I cannot get it where I am, every chance I get I have a Yuengling. Love it."

"Beautiful dark color with a bright white head. The beer feels light in the mouth but full bodied in taste. I've tried this both in the bottle and on tap and it simply doesn't disappoint. It has a distant caramel smell masking the hops. This beer is smooth and has a great little to no after taste."

"If you're going to drink for the sake of getting drunk, this would be a good go-to beer. It's relatively inexpensive and easy to drink. I hate the thought of giving money to macro's and Yuengling is THE name in lager in Pennsylvania. It may be more of a craft brew now than a micro brew but it's good and sticks to its roots quite well."

"This was a free beer that was given to me by someone I know. so I thought I'd review a beer from America's oldest brewery. Poured the beer out of the can and got a light reddish amber color beer with a thin head and hardly any lacing or retention, but quite carbonated. The smell had some sweet candy like aroma along with a grass and grain smell. The tatse starts out with some sweet malts followed by some citrus hops and finishing off with some graininess. The sweetness and the bitter hops stay throughout and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and smooth. This is not too bad of a beer, I'd drink it again if it was offered to me or maybe buy a 6 pack if I see it in a store, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."

"I would consider this beer a couple notches above the typical ""American adjunct lager"""
"A beer you could throw down a bunch of, but with a little more flavor and body than the BMCs... for whatever that's worth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Taste is a subdued mix of mild grassy, citrus hops and some wet bready malts. Finish brings a bit of a sweeter malt flavor into play. A very crisp mouthfeel without feeling too light. Very, very drinkable."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: This beer holds a special place in my heart because for a long time and in a great many places, this was the only option with even any flavor. Though I never choose this when better beers are available, it helped me get through the dark ages of beer. Glad the world is starting to catch up with us beer geeks."

"Over the last several months Yuengling Traditional Lager has become my go to beer. Pours a beautiful amber color with about a one finger white head that leaves a nice lacing. Smells somewhat nutty and toasted but nothing too great. Very drinkable and somewhat sweet taste. One thing of note about Yuengling Lager (or pretty much any Yuengling I've tried) is the high carbonation. This makes it a rather filling beer and difficult to drink a large quantity, which can be good or bad depending on the situation. Overall, while Yuengling Traditional Lager isn't anything particularly special, it is very good for what it is. I would easily take a Yuengling over any other domestic macro-brew."
""
""
"This poured with two fingers of white head with a yellowish-red colored body. There was some pretty active carbonation on this brew. The head dissipated quickly and left some lacing on the glass. On the nose, I got a bit of malt and some bready-ness. On the taste, I notice that this was way too cold. What I can get is a mild nuttiness and some malts and no real bitterness to speak of. The carbonation is plentiful and pleasant. The finish was very quick with a hint of sweetness. This is definitely better than any macro and because it’s so widely distributed (at least on the East Coast), it’s at almost every bar. This brew was simple, but satisfying. There isn’t really much more that I can say about this beer, because the success of it lies in it’s simplicity. There’s just not much going on, which is why it can go down so easily. This isn’t a beer that you have to search out, but if your choices are Coors, Bud and Miller and Yuengling, grab a bottle of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This really seems like a quarter step above a standard macro lager. It's about half the price of a cheap craft brew but even at that price you'd be better off buying malt liquor... but only if you're homeless.... Serisouly, don't buy it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This to me, is more like a Euro pale lager.. Not an amber lager. It is good though, and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is all about the refreshing taste, better than any other American adjunct lager. There is a malty sweetness with a lingering finish of freshly grilled corn that makes it extremely sessionable. Plus, the low ABV is commendable for a U.S. craft beer, too many are excessively high in alcohol. This is a beer designed for a baseball game. Makes me glad I live in Pennsylvania."

"i dont get the hype at all here. even though its not hype from beer drinkers, its hype from scrantonian natural light drinkers, i still dont enjoy this much. pours a funny muddy light red amber color with a soda head. smells like stinky malts and a musty basement. the flavor is more robust than all the standard adjunct stuff, but its not totally apealing. it has a wet noodle sort of taste that is just off the mark for me without really being able to be much more specific. the mouthfeel is my biggest issue though. it is way way over carbonated which makes it a tough session beer even though it would otherwise meet that criteria. its just too fizzy to really enjoy, especially from the bottle. overall a beer to skip, despite how popular this has become over the past five or so years. the other yuengling beers are pretty good on the other hand."
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a pretty good beer, especially as far as mass-produced lagers go. Tasty, refreshing, and inexpensive. There’s nothing particularly special here, but you can’t go wrong with Yuengling when it comes to cheap lagers."

""
""
"Pale amber-blonde colour, a modest cap of white head, light lace. Smell is grainy and malty, lightly fruity but mostly apple, some light floral hopping as well. Taste upfront is a clean biscuity malt, lightly sweet and lightly bitter, smooth quick finish, pleasant lingering malt aftertaste. Medium carbonation, light-medium body, pretty good feel. For what this is and what this costs its pretty solid, not something I will pick up by the case or anything but certainly something I would pick up a can or two of in the middle of nowhere when stateside."

"I live in Omaha, and the two times I've been able to sample this beer was courtesy of neighbors returning from Pennsylvania. The first time I was given 4 cans to try, and they made a very favorable impression on me. The second time I was ""given"" two cases, which happened to come in green bottles. The bottled beer was not as good, having the same skunky smell as other green bottled beers (Heineken, Stella Artois, etc.). The cost to me for the two cases was $20 each, which makes this beer a great value when compered to other ""grocery store"" beers."

"I think one of the previous posters summed it up pretty well. The brew has a pretty good following because it is a good solid brew. It is not a fancy limited edition craft brew. It's just solid. And there is nothing wrong with that."
"Overall: A good lager, and at least its American."
"overall yuengling isn't a world beater and will never be confused with one; that said, it's actually not half-bad, drinkable and inoffensive - even moderately tasty... factor the price point and it gets my approval."
"Poured from a can into a lager glass. Pours amber in color with a quickly receding one finger of bubbly white head. Leaves no lacing anywhere. The smell is of caramel malt, sweet candy, And very mild hops. The taste somewhat follows the smell. Slight hops, slight malt, and some adjunct. Slight caramel malt as well. But that's about it for flavor. The mouthfeel is very adjunct like, But with an ever so slight presence of burnt malt in the finish. Overall, Compared to many other mass produced beers, This one is pretty damn good."

"Overall, I think the hype hurts this beer. Many reviewers here don't take the style into consideration: it's like they're reviewing a Mustang and expecting it to perform well off-road. It's a great, simple lager that is a nice change of pace from the over-hoppy IPAs and over-roasted Porters that we're all used to reviewing."

""
"Overall - I've been curious to try this one for a while.. it's not bad at all. It's just a small notch above macro but still quite drinkable. And you can't beat the price. Probably wouldn't pick this up again, but it was worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well well well. This beer is not available in MA and I've always heard great things about it so I finally got a chance. Unfortunately it's pretty plain. Very plain. It's about as average a beer as you can get. Very little smell and flavor. I can see the appeal in this, it's better than the typical BMC swill but it's not flavorful enough to be offensive to your typical BMC drinker. So perhaps a good gateway beer? Honestly I'd take any Sam Adams brew over this for a gateway beer, but at the same time I can see the appeal. It's a session brew that you could probably drink a million of, no problem."
""
""
"Very watery, and very unremarkable. I can't see what all of the fuss is about. It's better than a Bud Light, which is how some of my friends have described it to me, but that isn't saying much. Not a terrible beer, but not something that I will be picking up in the store."

"Maybe it's better when it's fresher? I'm several states away from where it's normally available, so maybe that's it, but otherwise there's nothing very special about Yuengling. Certainly nothing that would make me go out of my way for it, no matter how cheap it was."

"Yuengling is one of the best bang for your buck out there. There are much better beers, but Yuengling has a great taste, color and smell and it is a very affordable beer. I often purchase large quantities of Yuengling when I am having get togethers as it seems to be pleasing to both beer snobs as well as the Bud Light drinkers."
""
"Yuengling is a completely average beer. Very drinkable and smooth, but certainly not extraordinary. I'd have it again if it was given to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice enough beer to enjoy on warm days when one is the mood for a session of uncritical beer consumption. Not something I'd go looking for, but I wouldn't hesitate to pour myself a glass after an afternoon of chores outside in the summer, or if I was waiting for a delayed flight at the airport."

"Decent but unexciting lager, certainly better and tastier than many of the big macro choices. 12 dollar (or whatever) case price makes this one an easy choice when we entertain the non-craft drinkers. Easy drinking, medium-light bodied, amply carbonated, crisp and refreshing. Mild malty aroma; taste is lightly sweet; caramel, pale malt, hints of floral hops. A bit grainy, low, restrained bitterness. You could do worse and probably have."

"Never had this Lager till I got stationed in Johnstown, PA and it has been my choice of beer since. It has a 1-finger head from tap that is quite pleasant and moderately thick. Great from tap, good from the bottle. Must be poured into a glass from can but is definitely among the best for me"
""
""
""
"Final thoughts - Not sure the cost a very low abv, but a great taste and very, very nice"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably one of the better mass production beers and likely what I would choose at a largely BMC place or a venue like a wedding/conference where there is little craft beer available. Definitely a sessionable beer."

""
""
""
""

"Its a very easy drinking beer. Ill drink this for parties and such. Certainly more taste and better appearance than other large US lagers. Green bottles don't tend to be an issue. Especially in PA where you by most your stuff by the case anyway. It dont last long on the shelves. Very consistent beer that is always available for a good price. My go to lager for sure. This is the type of beer you fill up your largest glass with and see how quick you can get it down. Cheap, but tasty!"

"O: What can I say, I have a soft spot for Yuengling, which has been my  go to beer since long before I discovered the world of craft beer.  It's tasty, highly drinkable, cheap and available everywhere.  It's far and away the best of the American Macros, and is actually my favorite beer in certain situation (tailgates, cook outs, paired with the hottest chicken wings you can find).  I'll probably drink this beer til the day I die.  "
""
"Overall: Great lager for everyday drinking. I have drank this lager in many placed and both in bottles and on-tap, and it has been consistently good. I enjoy porters and stout more, but this is a great and consistent alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hands down the best beer ever. I've had countless microbrews and domestics and there is no contest; Yuengling has the best drinkability and flavor of any beer available in the United States. If anyone rates this beer less than a 5 they're a beer snob and you should dismiss their opinion and try it for yourself."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good Red Lager, it had some good simple flavors while keeping the clean flavors and high drinkability of an AAL. This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth, it was also crisp and refreshing, I could see drinking more then a few of these while doing some grilling in the summer, a very drinkable beer, as any good lager should be. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer were pretty on par for a Red Lager. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher amount of sweetness and that it came in a green bottle, but those two things weren't really a big deal and hardly affect my overall score. I would buy this beer pretty often if it was available in Michigan, but since it isn't I can only get some when I or someone I know takes a trip down south. I highly recommend this to just about anyone, just a good drinkable Lager. Yuengling makes a pretty good Lager, now I see why this beer is so popular, I know that if I could buy this in MI I would probably have this in the fridge at all times, especially in the summer. I would really like to see Yuengling come to MI and I am pretty interested in trying their other beers, I hope to drink some more soon, this is one solid Lager."

It takes the parts of each that it likes and makes a unique brew that packs a surprisingly deep character not often found in mass marketed beers."

"Tried and true, the boys from Pottsville put out a simple, sturdy lager than blows the pants off of any of the BMC offerings. One characteristic of note, only visible over a long longitudinal study of this beer, is that there is an element of biscuitiness that ebbs and flows from case to case. Could be due to faster and slower turnover in different geographic markets, but something to look for. If you catch an especially biscuity batch, rejoice- it's a huge upgrade!"

My beer palate has expanded drastically since then but I have never grown tired of the taste of lager, as I have with so many other beers. It is one of the best session beers while watching a game as it goes down easy, tastes good, and costs the same as BMC products. It isn't world class, or even great, but all things considered it is pretty good, especially for the cost."

"I'm a bit biased for this beer as it was probably the first beer I ever actually liked. It's a good go to simple beer. Gets the job done. Sometimes I just get a craving for this beer and it's a reliable choice when the draft selection isn't that great as you find pretty much find this beer anywhere. I'll always have a special place for The old Traditional."

"Light bodied with good carbonation, this beer is very drinkable and surely thirst-quenching. The body is light enough to assist the drinker in avoiding the full effects of the flavors of this beer. The carbonation is very prickly, which really helps to make this beer a gulper."

"This beer will always remind of North Carolina, where my friends introduced it to me on Spring Break, since it was the only palatable beer at the local Piggly Wiggly. For the price, it's hard to touch the smell and flavor that this beer offers. I think I always used to drink it out of the bottle, so I never noted the lackluster appearance before. A simple easy drinking beer that puts the big three and practically all other macros to shame."

"A local standard. Paying respect to America's oldest brewery almost weekly."

"Surprisingly good for what you'd think would just be another macro. It is a macro but it shows what they could do in the macro space if they wanted to. It's not trying to be craft, just a solid, no frills lager. It's a respectable, tasty, and perfectly good session beer."
""
""
"Overall: An above average lager would drink again"

""

"Poured on tap to a clear amber color, some off-white head, some lacing. Smelled roasted malts, biscuity, a tad yeasty; not much. Taste is good; moderate biscuit/malty flavour, a little yeast taste, some sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth, moderate body with some carbonation. Overall a solid beer. I enjoy it when I'm looking for something decent for a good price."

"I bought a 12-pack of this when I was in NY two years ago. I somehow lost track of this one bottle that I reviewed. If the flavor changed over time, it got better. Seriously, this holds up. Regardless, this is not an amazing beer, but it's definitely worth a try. It's very drinkable, especially considering the price."

"O: Yuengling is definitely a refreshing beer but other than that does not really stand out in any one category. It hints at some hoppiness but otherwise not too interesting...Usually a decent choice if you want a more straight-forward beer."

""
""

"O: Not a bad beer. Much better than the BMC's, that's for sure. This is a beer that can be had alone, with a meal, with soft cheese, etc...it is very versatile, again, probably because it is not very strong, and the flavors are kind of generic. This is a good quality though, not a bad one. If you are used to big beers, or IPAs etc...you will find this one on the weaker side. A nice break from my normal routine of Belgians and IPAs."

"Although detractors might say it's no more than a step above your basic macro, where I'm from, it's special. The true magic of this beer is its ability to accompany anything; it's great with your staples like pizza and wings, but it also excels with Chinese and Thai, a steak, barbecue, or anything you can throw at it. Everybody who lives east should know it; west, you should seek it out and taste an American legend."
"Overall: a respectable American lager, but nothing overly exceptional"

"Yuengling, a classic. Pours amber with gold tinge, decent head. A little bit of lacing but not much. Smells just watery, alcoholic and sweet. Not much taste either, typical adjunct grain flavor, but with a little more quality. Smooth but watery feel. This is decent, better than most mass produced lagers"
""
"Overall: Amazing for the cheap price, my beer of choice if I want to get drunk on something a bit lighter but tasty."

"Bought 24 oz can from local shop for $1.50. Trying it out of a pilsner glass as opposed to a regular pint glass. Pours redish gold, shiny, bit watery looking. Very sweet bready smell with hints of malt and grain. Surprisingly crisp feel noticed off the bat. Citrusy notes, sweet maltiness and hops to round it out. Very well balanced. Not complex. I like this beer, it is brewed with more integrity than beers like bud, while still being really cheap. Glad to have it available here in jersey."

"Overall this is a decent beer, better than most available macros but never to be confused for a pure craft beer. It's clearly dominated by adjuncts but it has enough malt to push it into ""not bad"" territory. Worth picking up if short on funds or for enjoying with several friends."
""
""
"Light amber body, no head and no lacing. Aroma of grass and sweet corn. No hoppiness noted. Watery, slight fizz with a mouth swish. Not at all balanced. Crisp though. Must be drunk ice cold, taste flatens and worsens as it warms!"

"Taste-Lightly toasted malt, faintly sweet caramel note, barely there hop presence. Thin-bodied and best not allowed to warm too much. A step above most macros. A decent ""please the masses"" brew for a large gathering."
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable session beer, but nothing all that special."
""
""
"Pours out into a pint glass a standard reddish amber in color, translucent and fizzy, a half finger soda bubbled head that dissolved in about a minute, smells of sweet corn and faint caramel malt, tastes exactly as the nose would have you expect, but there is a vague whisper of earthy hop, body is on the thinner side of medium thick, overall this comes across as serviceable workhorse, better than a BMC but not quite by much."
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty much just good. I can't say it's great but there's also not much to complain about. Head was nice, good looking clear color. The taste was bitter enough, nice hop and grassy flavor, a little citrusy. It felt good, though, again not too distinct. I'd have this any day. Very drinkable, I'd easily have a couple."
""
"Overall, as hyped as this beer was expanding west, and never having had it before, I was slightly disappointed. Still, this a good alternative to drinking the macros because of the superior flavor and comparable price. I look for this to replace the macros in the new Ohio markets."
""
""
""
"O- Yuengling was a beer to look forward to when heading to the east coast. Now that we get it in Ohio its great addition (its all I've been buying), however it's also not quite as good as you think it was when only drinking it on occasion"

""
"O: Yuenging is new to Ohio and I first had it on-tap. Tonight was a 6pack bottle. Overall it's a very crisp clean and drinkable beer with more flavor than other mass produced beers. It's not super hoppy or malty like other lagers, just right IMO."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O – This was my first interaction with Yuengling, and I know now what all the hype is about. This beer really is good and I would prefer this over other mass produced lagers, but this doesn’t make it to CA, ever."
""
""
"Smooth and refreshing are terms that come to mind as I gulp this one. Easy drinker here. Nice mellow flavors of grains, light bitter bite, and a sweet finish. This beer itches me where I scratch time and again. Whether it's draft, can, or bottle, this is a beer I will continue to revisit. Simple. Refreshing. Tasty."
""
""
"O: A great session beer if you every want to hang out and have a casual brew. It's a hometown favorite, so I'll grab one whenever I'm out at a dive bar with a poor beer selection and it definitely does the trick. Knowing the type of beer you're ordering, you'll be very satisfied with your choice."

"Overall if you looking for a session beer thats a bit better than MCB, then check this out. Its not availible in the west yet, but I suspect it will get there soon enough."
"OK, NOT BAD!"
"O – In my opinion this is the best of the commercials beers. It is good – but not great by any means – but I would take this over a bud light any day."
"O-I do not have any desire to have a yuengling on tap again. I will have it in the summer to quench thirst but that really is it. No idea why everyone is so gaga over this beer in ohio. I would rather have a bud light. Even in regard to style, this beer really has no defining qualities to separate it from the swill besides its color."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - This beer is insanely easy to session through the entire night if you don't necessarily care about what you are tasting. As I said, I'd rather encounter this brew out and about when compared to many of its rivals. Still, the beer scores fairly low in its category. I was more impressed with Yuengling's Black and Tan offering."
"Dry yet a bit sweet from the malt. It's ok. Better than other ""macros""."
"I poured from a bottle into a small cone shaped glass. The head was about a finger and faded fast. I held the glass up to the light to reveal a nice clear amber color to the beer. The aroma had a nice caramel malt smell with little to no hint of hops. Taste was smooth with the malt being the main feature, nice caramel quality fading to some of the yeasty/bready character. Mouth feel is full with the generous but not overly done carbonation. I've had a few mass produced lagers like Budweiser and Michelob, and This beer tops even the Michelob. It's not exactly a craft beer nor an uber mass produced one like Budweiser.... It's just a good solid lager"
"corrections and feedback are WANTED!!! Thanks"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a nice deep amber color with 1"" head. Not much aroma here. Mild biscuit and caramel aroma. Tastes like a clean lager. Not sure why yuengling gets a bad wrap. I’d much rather have one of these over your standard BMC product."
"O: Better than most American Lagers, yet clearly in that simple easy to drink style. I enjoyed it just as much out of the can as pouring it into a glass."
"O: I've never really understood the appeal of Yuengling (I have friends who think that it is the best beer ever made). To me, it's a very mediocre, very ""white bread"" beer. If it gets you away from macros, it is doing its job, but please don't stop here."
"Overall: A very easy drinking, reasonably priced and readily available lager. This is a ""benchmark session beer"" in my opinion. For some reason, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it in a bottle, as I think Yuengling tastes much better from the tap. Several 1/4 kegs of Yuengling will make its way to my kegerator throughout the year when I need to keep a good ""session beer"" on hand."
"Like many have already mentioned, part of the allure of this beer is its history and relevance to the region. Honestly, there was always something unique about being able to just ask for a lager and be handed a Yuengling."
"The best thing is around here you can just order a lager and they bring you a Yuengling."
" No better. Lager."
"Overall - Honestly, it's like drinking seltzer water with some malt infused. It's unoffensive and drinkable, but bland as anything."
"O: This is an old standby around here, it's a step above any of the big three companies with a great price and great drinkability. It won't turn any heads, but I'm always happy that this is always on tap at bars around here at a great price. I mean, really a 12 pack for $11? Thank you!"
"Mouthfeel is watery and easy drinking. Could drink many of these in one sitting."
"Yep, this is definitely my favorite beer for those times when I don't feel like spending a lot of money. And I don't foresee anything changing that. Cheers!"
"A solid, no frills beer that can be enjoyed without thinking about it. Not bad at all."
"I used to drink this beer in Western Pa.,where I grew up.I moved away nine years ago and now live in south Louisiana.This beer is not available here ,and only get it when I travel to see family in Florida, or go to the beach in Alabama.Far too many people on here miss the point of this beer.Yuengling is not meant to be compared to micro brew ,or specialty beers.When compared to mass brewed beers by Coors, Budwieser,Miller,or any other large produced beer it more than holds its own.I have not met anyone down here that doesn't love this beer.I would use Coors light or bud,bud light to wash the floors at the Yuengling Brewery. This is an every day workingman's beer.Kind of like that dependable truck you drive to work every day.The high priced beers that I also love,are like that nice convertible you only take out on sunny weekends.Love this beer.Bring it to Louisiana !"
"poured from the can into a plastic cup. it looks like a reddish orange color from the top. what little head there was didnt last long. smells of caramel malts and bread. taste is similiar to the nose with a surprise thrown in there, hops, theres a little bite to it. mouthfeel is smooth and easy with good carbonation and a mediun light body to it. overall this is a easy drinking beer anytime of year, but especially this time of year with a bowl of chili."
"O- Yuengling is just an easy drinking reasnonably good tasting lager. Not a bad choice."
"Overall: to be fair i did have an Old Rasputin a few minutes before so that may have an effect on my judging of this beer but that said, this beer was just ok, kinda bland didn't really wow me at all. Not sure why Yuengling beers get all this hype, I mean their ok and the price is low but... meh."
"12oz green bottle. Pours a amber-red body with little head. Slightly roasty caramel malt comprises the aroma. Bready sweet caramel comprises the flavor. Just the slightest hop presence to speak of. Medium to light in body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Fairly simple and light. Serves its purpose - pleasant and drinkable without challenging the palate too much. Glad I had a chance to try it, seeing as though it's not distributed in New England."
"Average in just about every way for me. I can't quite appreciate the fanatic devotion many have for this beer, but then again I wasn't rooting for the Iggles, either."
"Offers a lightly creamy flavor with a light but present maltiness and finishes with a touch of citrus hop. Feel matches the general delivery of the beer; smooth and lightly malty for the style and with a pleasant carbonation. Overall a light take on the Amber Lager style, in color and flavor alike. As a result there isn't a great deal of depth to the pour, yet it does fairly well for what it is, and is easy drinking as a result and never cloying by any means."
"You smell a ton of the noble hop off the top. It tastes the same. It was a very typical lager flavored, but the flavors are much stronger than the BMC. It is a step up from Bud... and maybe it can be used as a gateway beer for BMC's to move on to craft. It just doesn't work for me at this point."
"O- I never understood why people drove out of state to get this beer with all great beers available in Ohio. It is a great value for the price though. It is a beer that you would say tastes like beer."
"Yuengling is my favorite ""regular"" beer. It may be because the only time I get it regularly is when I am on vacation. Either way, it is better than most mass produced lagers as it at least has some tast to it. This is my go to lawnmower beer."
"This is another beer that I find great to drink while watching football or any other sporting event. It is cheap in price and good in taste. This beer is very drinkable and quite easy to drink more than intended as they start going down pretty smooth."
"Good beer at a great price. I just wish they were able to distribute closer to home."
"This was my ""good"" beer in college....and now it is available everywhere in NYC!! A very easy-drinking amber lager with a nice flavor, light mouthfeel and a very clean finish, this beer is a solid mid-shelf beer that is a staple of Steeler games!"
"Pours a clear, filtered amber color with a small white head. Like many lagers this doesn't retain much of a head at all or leave any lacing, it looks sort of boring but that may be the style. Really sweet malts, caramel and grains come through in the aroma. Taste is similar with an overall sweetness to it. Very easy drinking, cheap and always available. When you're in a pinch, you can count on Yuengling to be there to pull you out."
"O - A fairly nice beer. Was shocked to find this at a golf course of all places as I didnt think the brewery even distributed to MA. Was worth the $3.75 I paid for the 16 ounce can."
"A basic but tasty lager, and definitely a cut above the BMC offerings. A go-to beer when I'm at a non-beer bar or restaurant."
"Overall: Had this beer for the first time on the way down to Pitt in June. This is the last of my bottles and would drink it again if possible, whether bottle or draft."
"Never again ..."
"O - Why, why, why do idiots insist on sacrificing a beer's integrity for LOOK of packaging? At any rate, this is a very plain beer further marred by light-struck skunkiness issues, for which I have no compassion."
"O: it's a good 'get-together' beer that, in my opinion, beats most of the macro offerings in pretty much each category."
"Pours a clear amber with a white head, varying in size with the pour, with not much to speak of in regards to retention or lacing. Grainy aroma, with hints of caramel malts. Bready taste, caramel malts, easy-going floral hops. Can be a bit metallic, varying depending on freshness and the source from whence you acquired it. Light bodied and fairly drinkable, but only if there's nothing else available (not including the typical macros)."
"Pretty light from beginning to end."
"Overall Drinkability - Better on draft than bottle. maybe. My opinion on that flipped a couple times before I finished. In style it's good. Beats BMC at least, I guess. Not sure what the hype is about it though."
"The mouthfeel was medium in body, impressive heft for a lager. Prickly carbonation that wakes up the taste buds. Enjoyable, I see why this beer has such a following."
"CHEERS"
"D: a mid-atlantic staple. however, when dissecting the flavor some flaws are evident. like i said above, maybe it's the can, maybe i just have a soft-spot for yuengling lager, but this is always a moderately priced go-to where im from."
"Overall: Not bad at all! Of course its too bland and boring, but it isn't nasty, and that is more than I can say for most mass-produced American lagers. This is a beer that has a bit of history and it doesn't disgrace that history. A solid lager from classic American brewery."
"O: A step up in every way from BMC beers, but nothing special. Just a solid, drinkable beer. Pretty cheap, and its restriction the the east coast makes it feel somehow exclusive. As I mentioned, this has been my family beer forever, so it holds a special place in my heart and my palate."
"I might be biased because of how close I am to the brewery but this is essentially a staple in my area. If you're out at any bar without a craft beer selection, you can always count on Yuengling being available - a beer I'd gladly take any day."
"(O) This is the best golf beer ever, in my opinion. It goes down super easy and it's an old style beer. No frills, nothing fancy. I actually happen to love this beer, but as far as how it stacks up to other brews and the overall craft, it's nothing out of this world. It's one of those not-so-great beers that I can't get enough of."
"(D)- Not very much flavor, but it sure goes down pretty easy. Crisp and refreshing. It is what it is."
"Serving type: Poured from a bottle into a wide mouthed glass."
"Overall a decent brew, if I had to go cheap this would be it."
"Easy drinking beer that goes great with those hot days and the post lawn mowing thing. Unfortunately this beer is not availble here in the Northeast for what ever reason. Big thanks to Mr. Apac for this fine 12 pack."
"O: Not something I feel the need to try again, but I am glad I finally got a chance to. All in all better than most basic lagers of his style."
"$12.79 for a 12pak cans."
"If I was getting these for free, I would enjoy them. However, I would not pay more than $10 for a twelve pack of these."
"O-The best macro out there and at a great price."
"Maybe the best macro lager."
"I ordered this on tap at a restaurant, so I had no control over the pour, but there was no head at all. Color was amber with a slight reddish hue. No lacing left on the glass at all. The smell was unimpressive - a vague malty smell with a slight skunkiness. My wife was complaining about the smell from across the table. Taste was nothing special, but not offensive - a grainy flavor mostly, nothing complex. Thin and uninspiring mouthfeel. Better than most mainstream lagers, but I'd not get it again."
"I grew up on this stuff 30 years ago before it was cool to like it. On par with Gibbons, Reading etc, a local brew that went mainstream in NC with great publicity. A little wierd funky flavor, a little too oaky which I don't like with a lighter lager style. Better than the big 3, but not as drinkable as PBR or Schlitz. Not even a really great outdoors style beer in the heat where brew in this catagory shine. Call it what they will but it's still an AAL."
"Overall- I would buy again, without a doubt. Great thirst quenching lager."
"Overall -- Pretty good. Overall, I think I actually prefer Premium to Traditional, but this is still pretty nice. Definitely a cut above it's macro contenders."
"D - Superb drinkability. This is my go to session beer as it's extremely affordable in large quantities and has good flavor. Overall it's an above average lager that beats most of the macro brews easily, taste wise. Its widespread availability, at least in the Eastern U.S., is also a huge plus."
"I purchased a 12 pack of these while they were on sale and I'm hooked. Brew has a nice amber color and a smooth taste. This brew reminds me of a craft style beer plus it's less expensive. Usually a 12 pack is under $10. For the money this is the best Amber Lager on the market. My go to brew"
"Overall - I good lager choice for the price. Otherwise quite boring to me and I don't like the dry finish it leaves on the pallet. Still a good option if BMC is other options."
"Yuengling Lager is a slight step up from BMC products. The beer actually pours slightly darker than expected, w/ little head or lacing. The smell is that of malt, and some slight hops.. There's a skunky smell in there as well. The taste profile is the same as the nose- not very good. Not complex at all. Not very tasty. Mouthfeel is very one dimensional, and has no redeeming qualities. Overall, I would not voluntarily drink this brew. Not recommended."
"So I'm in a restaurant in Western PA and my choices are Bud Miller Coors or Yuengling. My decision made itself. Pours a deepreddish amber color with a thinnish white head. Surprisingly dark color for a macro. Earthy grainy aroma with hints of corn and skunk. Slight earthy hop aroma was a surprise. Taste is earthy with hops grainy with malts and slighly corny. Medium to high level of carbonation, light body with a thin watery mouthfeel. Better than the macros but nothing special on its own."
"Not a great beer, but better than any BMC mass-produced lager. Easily drinkable and cheap, it's my go to tailgate beer."
"O - This beer is usually no more than $10 for a 12 pack and it is just downright awesome. I love this and it will always have a place in my fridge. Though I am sure I am giving a bit of a hometown advantage, I urge you all to try it; no way you'll be sorry."
"O: A decent representation of what an Amercian lager should be. I first had this beer sitting in a bar across from fenway park, the first time i was ever there."
"o - Overall a pretty average beer; not bad, but nothing really stands out in it. I'd much rather drink one of these than most BMC beers, but it's nothing special. Have had it many times and I'm sure I will again; a good alternative to BMC beers at most bars on the East Coast."
"I am drinking this beer right after a High Life, and the distinctions between the two are clear. I have become a fan of Yuengling, as it is a much richer, more complex Lager than any of the American adjuncts. The High Life almost tastes like water compared to this beer. I prefer Sam Adams Boston Lager over this beer, but I can't think of many other Lagers that I have had that top it for the price. I think it deserves a good rating for it's unique qualities and original taste. It's a real good Lager."
"Hey say what you will, for the price this ain't bad. Went down good and just enough flavor to make it interesting. Nothing to write your friends about but really not a bad beer by any means."
"O: A traditional lager, but much better than your usual adjunct lager. I'm still trying to figure out why it's categorized as an amber/red lager."
"Light in color, golden amber I would say, with little to no head. Smells pretty bad to be honest just like most lagers. I can taste corn and maybe some hints of nuts in the brew, pretty metallic flavored and not much else going on, but it’s definitely better than most of the mainstream lagers. I only drink this when there is nothing better at hand, drinkable but I’d rather have something else."
"Overall: I was hoping for a bit more then bud here. It's a little maltier version of budweiser."
"What this beer lacks in style it makes for in substance. Lager is a great go to beer to have on hand. Tasty, drinkable and pure Pennsylvania. E very now and then, the lager craving hits and I just have to have it."
"This is an OK, unpretentious offering. Decent for the price. Nothing great, but nothing horrible."
"M - The carbonation is high, and it goes down smooth. Feels lager-y..."
"O: I like Yuengling Lager pretty well and is my beer of choice when at an establishment with no craft options. It also does a pretty good job of putting out the fire that is Prince's Hot Chicken."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A beer that my money won't be spent on unless I'm purchasing it for someone else. Not a bad summer beer though."
"O: I usually don't like lagers all that much, but this is actually a good example of an amber lager. It has some nice flavors aside from watered down beer or lager yeast, and is pretty easy to drink"
"O: I love the story behind this beer: seriously, America’s oldest brewery? How can you not like that? But the quality of the brew just doesn’t cut it. Though this seems to be in the big brewery style, I would certainly drink this over a BMC any day. I know that’s not saying much, but it’s all I can really say for this one. It’s a pretty average beer."
"O - Because of the PA ties and the sentimental value this one has, it gets the score it does for this category. THE go to beer in PA and in my household."
"O: Overall, not a good beer by any means. However, it is refreshing and is better than anything by BMC."
"Overall, it's an okay beer. It's not my favorite, but it isn't bad. Personally, I would give it a lower rating. But because of the quality it presents for being the price it is, it's not a bad beer. When it comes to macro lagers, I prefer Coors Light or Coors, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and then Natural Ice, in that order. I'm not opposed to darker beers at all. In fact, I prefer mostly dark beers. However, I'm just not a real big fan of Yuengling Original Lager anymore. I used to be, but for whatever reason things have changed. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is light and slightly bitter at the end. This one's a thirst quencher but really can make do for any occasion. If I'm stuck for choices, I can fall back on this one with no question. Here in PA, this one defines ""lager"". Seriously, you can walk into any beer, say ""lager", and the bartender will pull you one of these daddys."
"Ok, this is certainly a beer to consider when throwing a party on the cheap. I believe the Yuengling organization is extremely frugal, and it certainly shows in the quality and price of this beer. I would maybe place the Traditional Lager just slightly above a BMC. As far as I’m concerned, the only quality that sets this beer apart from other mass produced beer would be the color – and the fact that Yuengling claims it's the oldest brewery in America."
"O ~ a decent ""everyday"" beer, table beer, pool beer, or pop a 12 pack in the cooler to go fishing beer... While it is not spectacular, it is economical w/ flavor :)"
"Seek out and try if your looking for a smooth tasting moderately flavored beer that's easy on the palate and just as easy on the wallet."
"D- Easy to drink and with no overly offending off characters this beer is a passable everyday beer. There is nothing too exciting here but for a simple cheap lager it does the trick."
"O: This beer is a party pleaser as it is inexpensive to purchase and many people like it. I find I order it often when meeting places that serve Miller/Bud products and Yuengling, which seems to be a lot of places."
"If you havent had this before then your missing out."
"O (D) - I dont really like it, but its not that bad."
"I usually cannot get this beer in Texas but my sister brought me some when she visited this time. I have had it numerous times during my travels for work though. I think part of the allure for me is that I cannot get this all the time. When people ask me about it, I have trouble telling them why I like it so much. To me there is nothing above and beyond about this beer. That being said I really do like it though. I think it is a great everyday drinkable beer. Sometimes I want something with more hops, other times more malt, but this is one that no matter what I could sit back and enjoy in a bottle or on tap with friends and good conversation. If you have not tried it do not expect to be blown away intricate tastes and aromas, but do expect it to be a great taste and an extremely easy drink."
"Overall not worthy of the hype/passion some people have for this beer."
"O- It is drinkable. I always enjoy returning to the east coast for the upgrade in lager. This is easily in my top two for American lagers. Hiccups be darned, I will always pick this up for a party or a really hot day."
"Grabbed a bottle from the 19th hole as I was heading to my golf cart....I have had this beer many times in the past, trying it for the first time many years ago in Wilkes Barre, when you could rarely find it outside of central PA. Always enjoyed it, and still do. it was refreshing and crisp...and very drinkable. I wasn't imbibing with the intent of reviewing, but here I am; giving it a decent grade. Wouldn't be my first choice, but you really can't go wrong here."
"This stuff isn't too bad. Smooth, even flavors. Would make a good session beer."
"Yuengling's traditional lagers pours a light amber color with a small white head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves a little lacing. Smell is underwhelming, kind of bready, malty, but not very strong. Taste is malty, slightly biscuit, finish is smooth. A slightly heavy brew, but still easy to drink. Overall, it's a pretty good amber lager, and a great value as it can be had for prices similar to Budweiser. A go to cheap beer."
"Great beer from an old brewery in Pottsville, PA. Smooth, good flavor without being bitter. Does not taste carbinated like many American beers. My daughter mails me a case every Fathers Day. Even my German friends love it! Yuenglings Light beer version is also better than most light beers."
"Overall - Like mentioned earlier, it is probably the best of the widely available beers and my choice if I am just hanging out with friends or at a local (normal) bar. The fact that you can actually taste some malt when you drink it shows they have at least spent some time and care brewing this beer."
"overall: cheap, functional. one can drink a lot of it for sure. but...i don't ""get"" this beer. its not great, but at the same price point as a budcoorsmiller, its a prince.... so i don't ""get"" it, but i get it....on draft....frequently."
"D - Average beer; better than most of the macro lagers out there; sets a historic precedence for lagers served in this country; easy to drink; couldn't have more than one in a single sitting though"
"-JH-"
"i dont know if you're supposed to do a review of a beer you drank straight from the bottle, but here is one anyway. the appearance is a slight brown with a white head. nothing to write home about. the smell is borderline metallic, with just that typical adjunct lager smell. it tastes like blood to me. and it's thin and watery. drink when drunk."
"Yuengling traditional lager is a favorite around my house. Provides consistently good taste, with an affordable price tag. I rated the smell a little low, but that's simply because I am not drinking one right now and I can't recall exactly the smell. So this review is subject to change once I have another. While I won't go crazy over it, I do highly suggest it if you have not tried it. I can't imagine you will be disappointed."
"O: This beer is okay. I am from Pennsylvania and this beer has a ridiculous following. I'm glad that it does. It is nice to support local business, especially because the other big beer companies aren't American owned anymore. When I am buying something other than craft beer it is often this one. It has a special place in my heart since it is one I grew up with all around as a kid."
"Overall-I knew what I was drinking, and this beer is not horrible. If the stomach is feeling good I can drink 3 of these out by the pool again, and probably will. Happy Memorial Day."
"O - Lager, so it is nice and light, refreshing and very sessionable."
"Overall - this is not a great beer but when reevaluated based on its dollar value it is a steal. Plus on tap it isn't half bad."
"D - Very drinkable. Not much else to say. There isn't a ton of flavor, but at the same time it is not too empty or watery. Solid beer at the price."
"This beeer is a win/win."
"On tap, served in pint tumbler. Color is a light brown, good clarity and minimal head. Aromas are faint. Clean bready malt and gingersnap. Flavor is very crisp and clean, good weight and body, but light and sessionable. A staple in my college drinking, been a long time since I've revisited this one."
"One of my favorite beers, and definitely one to get on tap if they offer it at your local pub!"
"Easy drinking with flavor. An american classic. love it."
"Overall, Yuengling Lager is what the NFL draft gurus would call a ""tweener"". It's definitely above the BMC light beer swill that's so prevalent, but it's not near the level of so many quality craft beers available. When the beer selection is limited (large restaurant chains, sporting events, etc.), this is my go to beer. However, if I can find anything better (which is often), this is an afterthought."
"Good for: gift offerings at BBQs"
"Overall: a step above macro lagers but woefully inadequate for an American amber lager. When better options exist that are easy to find, like Boston Lager, Brooklyn Lager or Blue Point Toasted Lager, I can't see myself ever choosing this over them. Cheers!"
"Where I live, in the Washington DC area, this is THE go-to lager for events whose hosts want to culturally signify that their taste is a step above the national norm for backyard barbeques. And indeed, Yuengling is better than your average, nationally distributed macro brew. It's not great by connoisseurship standards, but it's far better than the usual offerings at a casual neighborhood gathering. Pours a clear copper with one finger of off-white head with good retention. Aromas are chalk full of graininess and the smell of a countryside breeze, but has little in the way of hops. Flavor was clearly considered by the brewers, who vested this brew with light malts balanced by light notes of English Breakfast Tea. Medium light body finishes mostly clean with a bit of woodiness on the finish. A beer that I would gladly offer to my less discerning friends, but not one that I would generally consider for myself."
"I like this on tap better than from bottle. I could drink a bunch of these watching a baseball game."
"Overall it's alright. Could be better, could be worse. The more I drink it, the better it tastes. I guess it's growing on me a little bit. Not a beer I would buy, but I would drink it again."
"mouthfeel: cant complain, goes down smooth and doesnt leave anything lingering in the mouth or back of throat."
"Pours a deep yellow/orange color. the light tan head is nearly an inch and falls slower than I predicted to a mottled layer. On the nose there is some malt sweetness, some grain, a touch of caramel. The beer has the same flavors as the smell with a dry hop thing going on at the end. The Yuengling beer is light/medium in body with an active carbonation which gives a bit of a prickle. Overall like most people say...it's a hell of a lot better than the macros but certainly not a great beer."
" chain resturant that only has A few choices."
"o: this is the first beer in a multiple step program to getting yourself away from macro crap. and for the price, you can't beat it. it's funny when you talk to people about how you like ""good beer"" and they say, ""yeah me too! i only buy yuengling!", but at least they're staying away from bud light aluminums. anyway, definitely a great everyday run of the mill lager."
"Its a solid American Red Lager....nothing fancy....nothing bad. The color is a clear amber with thin white head that has some lace. The nose is nothing to write home about....smell like a plain American Amber ale. The taste is very solid a very drinkable beer. There is grain and malt that can be found on the pallete. The mouthfeel is easy and could session all day long."
"Anyway, drink Yuengling, it's good, affordable, and deserves to be help more prominently than the big three that dominate the world of featherweight beer."
"Overall, it's a fantastic beer to pick up when you've got a bunch of friends coming over or just to have in the fridge as a backup. I pity those of you outside the distribution area."
"O: You know what you are getting with this beer. It has a purpose and fills it well. It is an inexpensive session beer that is superior to BMC products. Good for a long day, hanging outside at a BBQ or at the beach."
"Overall, it is what it is, and it's damn good for what it is."
"The pour is light to amber color, with an acceptable head. Not paticularly fragrant, but that's OK with me. I enjoyed the taste, not to hoppy or filling for a multiple dose everyday beer. Minimal after taste. Definitely my BBQ, game day, or post mow refresher choice!"
"O: So-so beer with some major weaknesses when compared to the better examples of the style. Still, it's light and easy enough to drink with a serviceable flavor that would make it session-worthy I s'pose... should you choose to go the route of fairly bland and macro-ish lagers."
"I picked up a 24oz can at a gas station in Florida for $1.99. It was right next to the BMC 40's. It pours a watery and crystal clear orangeish amber in color with a billowing two finger soft and spongy off white head. It smells of sweet carmel malts, bread crumbs, and has that BMC aluminum can smell. It actually tastes pretty sweet. It has this sweet maltyness which isn't too shabby and it is sweeter out of the can than from the bottle. I'm actually surprised at how much better this one tastes out of the can. There is zero hop presence but I didn't expect any. It's a little watery but it's actually pretty drinkable and I'd much rather drink this than anything else with the same price tag."
"O: An easy going easy to drink beer with enough flavor to stand on its own but not bold enough to distract from a meal. Thanks again woody for hooking it up!"
"I have been drinking this beer since before Uncle Sam thinks it appropriate. Before ever stepping foot in the beer store, I had assumed that people were paying $5-10 per case for this beer than others. Even to an untrained pallet this beer had special characteristics that the other lagers didn't. This is a good session beer for a damn cheap price. In PA, it's only $20 and some change for 24 bottles. Great beer to support if you can't afford cases of beer upwards of $35."
"I recommend it."
"if you can get it don't see why anyone would Drink bud or miller over it"
"Good feel here, this is a decent body with good carbonation. Overall this isn't the worst beer I've ever had. Not a fan, but I'm glad I tried it. Just seems to have off flavors and aromas."
"Pours to a 1-inch white head and amber-gold color. Aroma is grassy hops and sweet malt and maybe some other grains. It has a whiff of white grape juice. Flavor is crisp and balanced: grassy hops and a bit of butteriness mixed into the malty grainy backbone. Mouthfeel is just right with light body and moderate CO2. Overall, I like this beer for everyday (that is, if they started distributing to my area. I had to go to the Memphis Airport to have this. That is about as far west as this stuff goes.) Nothing extreme, balanced, no weird flavors (or no weird flavors I dislike). A solid citizen."
"Overall - I guess this is just your average amber. Nothing too impressive here other than the fact that it's pretty balanced and that's pretty affordable. I would still drink it over most other affordable brews."
"Whenever I'm out and the bar doesn't have what I want this beer usually comes into play. This is always a beer that I can fall back on most of the time. This lager pours out as a reddish brown color, not typical of most lagers out there. The head fades very fast on this beer unfortunately. The smell of this beer kind of stands on it own. The mix of malts, some possible wood aromas come through and just a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is a bit watery on this beer but it's still drinkable."
"Would that other big-name US lagers taste as good as this. A beer I would certainly be happy having around the fridge for casual patio and backyard drinking. Certainly a few cuts above your standard BMC fare, that's for damned sure."
"My local beer, being a Philadelphian, I have spent many a night drinking Mr. Yuengling's brew. I really feel that there are very few beers that have the great appearance that ""Lager", as we call it in Philly, does. The taste can be a bit strong for a lager, but it is very easy to drink throughout the night. There are very few negatives with this beer, but still just a bit of taste away from in the elite class."
"Overall- A good beer, deffiantly get a case, a perfect lagar to have in all seasons. I'm glad to live in PA where it flows like mud. Thank you"
"Anyways, on its own it doesn't hold a candle to some of my favorite beers but it is still good."
"Overall not very exciting, it's a good old American Lager."
"O: I don't drink a ton of lagers. The first beer that I ever liked was a Guinness, so I'm definitely more interested in ales, porters, and stouts. But this beer was really refreshing. In terms of lagers, it can't get much better. In terms of beer, this is nothing to write home about."
"O - Drinkable, but nothing here but a checkmark on your ""I've had a beer from the oldest brewer in America"" box 3"
"Nothing overly special, but a worthy, easy drinking lager."
"Simple light amber color without much head. Smells hoppy and bit grassy. Very clean and crisp taste without much complexity. Hoppy with some mild orange rind. Lingering bitterness is very mild. Not a bad choice for a refereshing cold one, certainly better than most macros, but not in the discussion of true great crafts."
"D: Good drinkability for a cheaper beer. If I were on a budget I could settle for this, but it would be settling."
"D- Very easy to drink and a go-to if a restaurant has a mainly BMC selection as this one did"
"Not a big fan of the A,S,T,M,O ratings, just want to know if it is a good beer or not. This is a good beer. A beer drinkers beer. If I could I would move back to the east coast just to have it all the time."
"Nice head, good lace, clear amber with lots of carbonation. Malt aroma leaning toward the sweet side with a hint of earthy hops. Medium carbonation mouthfeel with body on the thin side, particularly toward the back end. Lightly roasted malt taste, light earthy hops middle, cooked corn finish."
"D- This a good beer with modrate drinkablity, if I go to a bar and Yuengling is the only thing on tap I order it. Great brew anytime."
"Drinkability - Well, this beer is ok I guess. It is a step above any ""macro", but it's still nothing outstanding in my opinion. It's drinkable, however after one or two I would probably be searching for something else to sip on. It could be a decent gateway beer."
"An incredibly popular beer in the Pennsylvania area. Poured out of the bottle it has a deep coppery color. Smells very sweet with a slight malt character revealing itself. Tastes very sweet and toasty with just a touch of skunk which actually gives the beer some of its best character. Medium bodied beer that can be as others have said kind of watery. Altogether its a wonderful beer at a very reasonable price here. Picked up a case for under $20."
"Served in a mug, the beer pours a caramel-copper coloring with a thin, big bubbled, white head. Toasted malt and oats in the aroma. The beer has a nutty-toffee-sweet malt taste, with roasted flavors into the aftertaste. The beer is light and creamy in mouth, and it carries the flavor well. The finish is quick to the roasted sweet flavors, but blends out to nothing rapidly. It's an easy drinker with strong flavors for the style."
"This is pretty easy beer for drinking you could do a lot worse, but the wetness of it real doesn't sit well with me. At least this is drinkable I will give it that."
"Has a light-bodied mouthfeel, and is highly drinkable. This is a great alternative to a BMC, and costs the same as Bud Light where I live, so it is decently cheap too. A decent ""simple"" beer, would probably be better on-tap."
"Earlier today I enjoyed another amber lager, Full Sail LTD 5. Comparing these two beers doesn't feel right. This yuengling pours a transparent tan/amber hue with a 1/2"" white head that quickly dissipated to nothing. Smell was of sweet malt and grain, but it was very light. Taste was only slightly more impressive. Starts with a light and sweet malt, then you get with a bit of alcohol and the slight hops. Moughfeel is pretty light. Overall, relatively unimpressive as an amber lager. If I lived in it's distribution area, I'd keep some on hand to give my BMC friends as it would be a good stepping stone."
"Pours with a good-size head that slowly dissipates. Sporadic lacing remains as the lager is drunk. The primary aroma seems to be toasted grains; a faint sweetness is also present. A grainy, earthy profile is also present upon tasting. In addition, I detect bitter tea and a sweet caramel flavor. There's a reason Yuengling is much sought after by people outside its distribution area and a reason it's my lager of choice-this stuff is extremely drinkable and tastes great and it's affordable."
"D - It is what it is, one of the light beers but disguised with a deeper color. I could easily drink 4 or 5 or 6, whatever, we'll see where the night takes me."
"The CPJ"
"D: not a whole lot of greatness happening here. The beer is fairly drinkable... but would I want to drink this over and over? No."
"Poured from the can, the orange-amber color and modest creamy head are pleasant enough. The aroma is less impressive, with only a thin malt sweetness coming through. The flavor is more pronounced, with a bready, sweet light caramel maltiness that is contrasted by a subtle grassy hop character. The body is thin, even against the light flavors, and the carbonation is a bit prickly. Overall, this is not a world class beer by most standards, but I prefer it over a majority of the American macro lagers out there today."
"D: Easy to handle in large quantities."
"Pours a pale amber with light head fading quickly. Very mild aroma releases grassy hops and a slightly malty carbonation. Smooth and enjoyable for a low calorie brew (at 128 cals/12oz). It's flavor underwhelms, however, as the very sacrifices that keep it low in calories have impacted the richness and complexity of the malts. I look at it as a slightly more flavorful miller lite or similar mass commercial brew, but probably not worth the 22 additional calories."
"Poured fine, decent color and the foam was dense looking, but as it decayed it was strange. Smelled of corn and soap. Tasted of corn and soap. Drinkable brew and I would take it over some ""light"" beers but this doesn't seem to me as decent as some others feel."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink but I wouldn't consider it as being sessionable because the taste isn't interesting enough for me to want more than one of these in a sitting."
"Had this both in bottle and on tap. On tap seems to be my favorite. Nice cold mug. This is not an overbearing tasting beer and can drink alot of it on tap without the full feeling most beers can give. Not very foamy. Better on tap then the bottle if your going to drink several."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light amber color with a thin head. Moderate lacing. Aroma is slightly skunky with some malts and breadiness. Some caramel aroma as well. Flavor doesn't have any of the skunky qualities that the smell did. Nice smooth caramel flavor with some malt. What it lacks in the mouthfeel department it makes up for in the drinkability. This is an inexpensive, well made lager that has a good amount of flavor. Worthy of having a surplus of it in the beer fridge."
"D: I'll buy this before any BMC but will pass it up for a moderately priced micro or craft. This beer holds a special place in my heart."
"very drinkable and dependable"
"D- Amazing drinkability, hey you have choice. this is a cheap beer, but a good cheap beer. It doesnt leave you gagging after 3 beers, no, you can breeze through alot of these. Damn good beer."
"Regardless, this is a wonderful session brew for a large American brewery and a domestic lager, particularly in the cold longneck bottle on a warm summer day."
"Straw yellow and clear with average head that disappears quickly. Light malt smell, fresh and clean with very light hop must. Very light malt flavor with light hop bitterness, slightly metallic and no pine cloy at all. High carbonation but goes down fast and easy. Solid brew that you could enjoy all night."
"Amber pour with lively carbonation and nice sized white frothy head. Aroma is Slightly grainy with some caramel malt, and grassy hops. Flavor is a nice balance of sweet malt and hop bittering. Flavors are not overly pronounced and graininess is a bit too prevalent, but this brew is great for the style. Take this over any other American macro-swill any day."
"- A great dry lager.. with flavor and zing. I bet an ice cold bottle of this is even better. Good stuff!"
"You could do worse for a readily available beer. When you're not feeling adventurous and just want a comfortable, familiar flavor and feeling, Lager is a great beer to drink."
"A real easy drinking beer"
"This is easy to drink, but not really a beer I would want to drink. It is a step above most BMC offerings-- but no where near the level I've become accustomed to."
"Haven't had a Yuengling Lager in a loong time. Buddy left a few bwhind after a card game last night and figured I'd crack into one. Reminds me of my days as a college student in PA when I drank many a pint of this brew. Nothing special, but an easy one to knock back."
"Thanks to my lovely wife for smuggling some of this back from a trip to D.C. My perfect pour glass was filled with a light copper-color beer capped with a fingers of bubble foam. The aroma was lightly malted with some yeast, not much there. The flavor was much better than others of the style I've have before. The taste is the aroma plus a tiny hint of citrus. The body is good and it goes down with just a bit of twinge on the tongue. Overall it's okay for the style but doesn't pack the punch of my regular beer lineup. If your looking for an easy beer to enjoy at a BBQ or bowling, this will fit the bill."
" So in short, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life you can put money on Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager. I mean for Crist sate Yuengling is the oldest brewery in America, they must know what the hell they are doing."
"After a partial can of Clear Creek ICE, this is a very relieving brew to drink!"
"Nicely priced too."
"D- The ABV on this beer is lower and makes it perfect for drinker many of. This beer has a better taste than most adjunct lagers. Clean and crisp tasting this beer would go well in the summer after mowing the lawn."
"Yuengling is sort of a go-to party beer because it's easy to get and it's quite cheap, and it's an easy choice in bars that don't have much selection. It's much better on tap than in the bottle or can, for what it's worth."
"A pretty standard lager but pretty tasty as well. A nice, simple session beer. Nothing complex, but not bad."
"1/11/11"
"This is my first time that I test this beer and for me it taste a little like a high class budweiser at the end,the head last longer than an averege lager,love the color is dark amber,a bit of hob/malty flavor and a far sweetnes at the end.What I like about this beer is when it gets about 58 degrees the the aroma become a bit more intense bit the flavor still the same not like the some lagers that become undrinkable."
"Drinkability- Beer is easy to drink for anyone, but in St. Louis, our version is Budweiser.While being very excited to try this beer for the first time since they don't sell in Missouri, I was let down... Being the oldest Brewery in America, I expected more from them. I will be looking for more of their beers to try though."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, small caramel like notes and somewhat standard lager smells. In the taste, small caramel sweet to dry, an abrasive hop bite, and all the standard lager flavors as well. A bitter and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small caramel like aftertaste. A bit abrasive, but nice caramel like notes."
"D- This is my 'budwesier' Exceptional drinkablity, if I go to a bar and Yuengling is the only thing on tap I order it. Great brew anytime."
"D: although I rated everything else rather poorly, it does well as a regular session beer"
"Yuengling is a traditionally inexpensive very availible beer that all in all is the common man's champion of good wholesome brew. Above par appearence from the usual mass market brews its rich and amber with little head. Smeel is rather paltry but the taste comes in above par as stated before. Nothing too strong a bit bitter but all in all just a fantastic smooth brew. Nothing out of the ball park but all in all good."
"Americas most overrated beer. It isnt bad, but cmon, its not one of the best beers out there! It has an ok malt taste, but not that strong of one, kinda weak. The hop flavor/aroma is mild at best. I will say that it is easy to drink and leaves no harsh afertaste."
"This is quite a popular beer in the PA area in which I live. Really a classic and is enjoyed by all sorts of people. Pours a pleasant copper-amber body with, initially, a robust head which dwindles down to small traces of foam sitting on top of the body. Smell is slightly metallic with hints of corn husk and sweet-slightly molasses-y. Tastes of light carmel/molasses with a husky feeling in the nose. A slight pinch of hops at the end balances out the malty sweetness. It is really a pretty good beer, however, it may leave you with the feeling that there is more to be desired as this beer may seem somewhat watery."
"Can drink these all day and wish that they were available in Indiana--Way better than the regular swill."
"Verdict: intense flavors lacking, this lager is still a decent buy and could be as likely a good party beer as a comfort drinker for one. Better than most macro brews. C (3)"
"The oldest brewery in North American still makes one of the most drinkable lagers. Beautiful amber, nicely balanced malty sweetness, but with enough taste to justify being a decent session ale. Definitely not a lager that needs to advertise ""cold"" as a flavour! Increasing demand bodes well for the increasing expectations of American beer consumers... there is hope!"
"Good to be back on the east coast enjoying one of the finer US lagers. An old favorite. A nice orange lager, pleasant carbonation. It is slightly sweet, a little toasty, a dry and slightly spicy finish. Slight bitterness balancing the malty sweetness of the lager. Nice round booty body. enjoyable and easy drinking."
"My pour created a finger of eggshell-white head with low retention, fizzing its way out of existence. Color was a deep coppery-orangish amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like pure, unadulterated lager - slightly sweet with a mild maltiness that was pleasant to take in. Mouthfeel was medium with a lager sweetness on the tongue. It seems pretty unobtrusive to me these days, having been a self-avowed hophead and then getting on The CANQuest (TM) kick, which led to a LOT of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lager consumption. This struck me as a nice, easy-drinking beer that I could easily use to fill a cooler for a picnic or a barbecue. The ABV is reasonable and the taste is not going to put anybody off. The finish was slightly dry and nicely pleasant."
"D- this is where this beer shines, this is my go to and as a macro I believe it is the best for the quality."
"I really had high hopes for this beer, I can't get it in IL but picked up a can in TN specifically to review because of it's reputation. i hope it's just a mishandled can because if all Yuengling tastes like rubber then I can't trust any more east coasters BA opinions anymore."
"The beer pours a crisp amber color with small head and decent lacing. Light taste of some dark fruits and overall a crisp, refreshing beer. PA born and raised, this is my go to at bars as it can be found everywhere. A great session beer and overall, a very well done brew."
"Not a bad beer but absolutely unworthy of its reputation. Better macro beers than Yuengling: Coors Original, Straub."
"D: I could easily drink a lot of this if it were on hand. Great flavors, but not overwhelming in any way. This one would be a great beer for drinking while doing something else, golfing, bowling, backyard bbq. Very nice. Glad to actually try it."
"Bought 12 oz. bottle at Longwood gardens. The other choices there were Heineken and Amstel Light. Pours amber with a white foamy head. Looks good actually. Aroma of piney hops, grass and some grain. Watery on the palate, but somewhat tangy. In terms of flavor, well, I did not notice any. Definitely some earthy hops kick in the finish."
"Beats any other macro lager for me."
"Great drinkability! Probably the best macro lager on the market!"
"Would be an outstanding laying around the beach type beer."
"Yuengling Traditional Lager has a light amber colour and a head that dies away quickly and is replaced by a decent amount of lacing. The smell is unimpressive... very grainy. The taste is slightly malty and sweet with a crisp and pleasant aftertaste. It has a reasonable medium body and is very drinkable. This is the best beer you will find in shitty pubs."
"When it comes to American-style lagers, you can do a lot worse than this. I can see the appeal."
"Very clean and malty dark beer."
"Not sold in Ohio, unfortunately. I have to go to Pennsylvania to drink this beer. It's a good example of a regular American lager, and much tastier than many of its counterparts. I enjoy this beer, and I could drink it all night long, and I wish the nights were longer."
"Session beer with enough taste to keep it interesting. Not bad at all."
"Pours an amber color with some chestnut brown hues. Nice full head with a little lace sticking to the glass. Smell is lager all the way. Malt forward with some light grassy hop aroma. Palate is clean and flavorful. Bready caramel malts are balanced nicely with a mild hop flavour. Medium body with a clean finish. Overall, a classic blue collar lager that get's the job done."
"No Yuengling in Ohio, so cases were bought in PA as well as having had plenty of the same w/friends who brought back from PA. Smell is VERY mild kind of a funky skunk but NOT strong for green glass. Nice strong amber color helps as does the case which keeps it dark. Very drinkable compared to Lord Chesterfield Ale. Finishes w/a malty skunk back lash that tells ya' to keep 'em COLD. For me, much like Molson Canadian this is a good middle of the road lager that's great w/a meal and for drinking all night if need be...You can get a good buzz with good flavor w/o goin' cheap and feeling total bloat and no buzz. Wish Yuengling would sell in Ohio I enjoyed their porter as well. Good middle of the road go to"
"Bottle courtesy of mikeg67. Pours a clear amber with a small white head. Aroma of light malt, a bit of fruitiness some light hops, and grassy notes. Taste is similar to aroma. Palate is light bodied, light carbonation. Finish is sweet malt and very light hops. Overall not as bad as I thought, but best served while still very cold."
"D"
"Cheers!"
"1/4 finger head, no dissipation head just disappeared, some lacing retained. Clear medium amber body, some carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Taste is malt forward, roast, bready caramel, some grassy hops towards end leading to a slightly bitter finish. Medium-full mouthfeel, decent effervescence, just a bit sticky. Good drinkability. I'm glad I was able to try this historic beer, but won't be going out of my way to have it again."
"The beer is amber in color and appears clear. The head is an inch thick and leaves a nice sheet of lacing on the glass - noticeably different than the draft version I reviewed. The aroma is sweet malts and typical American lager scents. The beer tastes simple and plain with a slight sweetness that grows as the beer warms. This is a decent offering and sometimes the best beer available, as is the case tonight."
"This beer continues to be a maintainable in my life for its good quality, low price and decent availableness. Pours a nice brownish amber with a nice creamy white head. Has all the qualities a good lager should have. Over all the high point to this beer is the fusion of good quality brew with great drinkablity and good prices. I commend Yuengling on all of their beers for all of these qualities."
"Feels a little light in the mouth, but very drinkable. It's been a session beer in prior years."
"Overall a lager I wish were available in my area. My neighbor hit PA a couple times a year and says this stuff runs aprox. $20/cs. I believe I'll have him snatch an extra one for me next time."
"D- Easily an all night drink if it's what you're looking for. In a college town it's probably going to be one of the best things that'll be on most restaurant menus. Great for gameday."
"d- a quality beer for getting hammered on but not just for tasting purposes"
"D- Refreshing. Drinkable since its so watery. Skunkiness is strong. I wouldn't buy one."
"D: I personally consider this a very drinkable brew, smooth and tasty,but not excessively filling. Its a nice sessionable beer."
"Wanted this tick forever, not worth the wait though."
"Bottle. Thank you so much, Justin. Pours a clear amber with scant lacing. Nose is grain, maybe bitter corn. More grains in the mouth, slight ethanol, fairly bitter. Little balance or pleasant qualities, there is a reason I never liked this. Drinkable I suppose, I've had a few today."
"D: This is easy to drink Lager. This is a 'go to' beer if there not much out there but BMC. While I don't search it out, I do enjoy this beer and will continue to enjoy it in the future."
"D-very high, this is a good sessioning beer for most anything. Given the price and expanded distribution of the last few years, most anyone in the Northeast should be able to get this and at under $20 for a case/thirty pack you can't go wrong"
"Grabbed this while down on LI and brought a few 30s back to CT with me. Can't get Yuengling in CT--bizarre. Nice brown color--makes me want to drink it. Smelled a little skunked. Not terrible--may have to re-review after I try a fresh batch. Tastes really good though. Nice full mouthfeel too--very drinkable beer."
"Wish I could get it around here."
"The mouthfeel was watery, thus helping to make this lager easy to drink. A good session beer. It's too bad they don't sell Yuengling in Kentucky. This would be a regular part of the rotation in the fridge. A very good beer for the money as well."
"Drinkability? Light, refreshing and tasty, this is a very easy quaffer. I admit, I have a soft spot for Yuengling Traditional Lager and I have had them in the green bottles and now, in cans. I prefer the cans."
"Lighter body, plenty of carbonation, and a little dry, without too much lingering feel. Very easy to drink, especially in copious amounts. One of my favorite cheaper lagers which still has a bit of actual flavor."
"D: Yuengling's lager is sessionable but not necessarily enjoyable, and for better or worse, tastes just like Corn Pops. You know, the little yellow balls of sweet corn cereal. Seriously. I could close my eyes and convince myself that I'm eating breakfast."
"This is probably my favorite Commercially made lager. It's usually the best thing on at most restaurants."
"I tried my best to rate this beer as fairly as possible because it's my favorite beer. Everyone has their go-to beer and this one is mine. I tried my best to not give a bias opinion."
"Pours a dark red brown color with a thick white soapy/rocky head with tons of lacing. Smells really boozy with some hops in the background. Tastes sweet and a little bitter from a little hops in there but mostly malty and sweet. Kinda one note. Hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel and drinkability both are pretty good."
"Yet this beer is nothing if not drinkable and perfect for grilling and for the occasional financially lean month."
"D- Not as drinkable as a light beer, but very drinkable compared to most other kinds of beer. Has an an original and defining taste to it that makes it great."
"Good drinkability, this would be a great session beer."
"Pours a light brown color, with a small head. Smells of malts, and tastes like malts as well, with a small bit of hops. Light mouthfeel, goes down easily and quickly. Definitely much, much better than your standard cheap lager, I wouldn't mind sipping on this at most mainstream bars that don't stock finer beer."
"D: An easy drinking and good little lager; a good, cheap, go-to sessionable beer"
"gose down smooth this is served every where in pa"
" It has a bready/yeasty taste with a short burst of subtle citrus hop that kind of has a bitterness that is a bit sharp. It also has a caramel graininess that I find to be pleasant tasting. Very crisp and refreshing beer... which is definitely its best quality overall. Its so drinkable that its very easy to go through faster than you would your average craft beer. Light beer but not TOO light. Its pretty good... I'll definitely pick this any day over the standard 3."
"D - Very drinkable, seeing as this is a medium lager with lower alcohol I can drink a lot of these."
"This is a pretty good beer to drink if you're throwing a party or casually drinking. It's not too challenging and goes well with anything, and it's not very alcoholic. It's not one of my absolute favourites by any measure, but it serves a very good purpose and there's always some in my fridge for when I just want a beer, plain and simple."
"D- Better than most lagers, decent balance, decent flavors and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is really quite good. The alcohol is almost completely undetectable. Coupled with the pleasant taste and crisp character, Yuengling Lager is a way, way better option than the BMC dross that is out there. Luckily for me, places around here usually carry it along with all the adjunct lagers, so this is my go-to beer for bar hopping and social drinking. Solid, solid brew."
"I would say beer is drinkable but most lagers are. Not much going on to make me want to have another. Next time will have the barkeep rug in the SA lager instead."
"I do not think this is all that similar to each other. My brother in a law is a Miller Light drinker who love Yuengling on vacation. I'm not surprised he liked Leinenkugels more, it is more like Miller Light to me."
"You know, this is one beer that I can have and still enjoy. Its better than most of the generic crud at an average bar. The one thing these folks need to do is ditch the green glass bottles."
"Solid carbonation, and very drinkable. For a beer that rivals BL/Coors/Miller on price for a 6 pack with this much flavor has to be a go to beer, if there such a thing."
"I like to drink this beer when I'm low on cash but want a decent tasting beer. Its proclaimed as ""Americas Oldest Brewery"" so you gotta show it some respect. Good beer at a fair price. I drink mostly from the can but probably prefer it from the tap at a local tavern."
"Has average drinkability. I was not a huge fan of this beer but I will definitely get one when I get the chance."
"great drinkability, way better than any macro option. and the price is about the same as most macro beers. overall, yuengling brews a quality product and you have to give them props."
"I can't believe I missed out on trying this beer years ago. It gets overlooked and pushed to the side for bigger and more advertised brews. I picked it up not too long ago and found that this is a well hidden secret. I was truly set to my Budlights and New Belgium beers. Not anymore, this is my new go-to beer everyday of the week. It is very affordable at IGA, roughly $4 for a 6 pack. Pretty good buzz compared to any other Lager. The tatse is exceptional, however the labeling can be deceiving. I think they need a make-over, new labeling, few commercials, keep the same ingredients and your golden! If I had the money, I would try to buy some shares from the owners in this company. I'm on my 5th beer this afternoon and I wish I had another 6. Very good beer, defies the green bottle skuny theory, lol."
"This is a drinkable beer but not overly so because the taste is lousy, more processed tasting than characteristic of all the ingredients. Would never buy this beer and would only drink again if I'm desparate and it's free."
"Drinkability: By itself I really don't care for this beer. It's got a flavor profile that just leaves me cold - I'm not caring for it. With food it becomes much better in washing a meal down and I think then the flavors compliment things more. Overall a ""meh"" experience."
"Big thanks to BA woodychandler for this one : )"
"Drinkability: Nice and refreshing, these go back very easily, and are great during the summer. A decent offering from PA, especially for something to drink every day, if the generic macros aren't your thing."
"At any rate, this is a crappy adjunct lager, nothing more."
"Better than macros, but definitely nothing outstanding. Definitely will beat your ordinary macro any day of the week however. I feel as if I can drink this when I want something simple and cheap and not have to turn in my ""craft drinker"" card."
"You could do worse."
"Don't ever mind buying Yuengling even though it isn't one of my favorites. Never a bad thing to support a legacy of family owned and operated business."
"The best by far in the Yuengling family. No real color, No bitterness though either. Beer maintains taste though through out the length of the first gulp to the last every time. Good with all foods in my opinion. Reminds me of the first beer I ever tasted in a plesant way, A MGD."
"I highly recommend this beer, as it's great for a session and Yuengling is still a family owned brewery that made it through prohibition and has thankfully not sold out to Anheuser-Busch. As you enjoy this drinkable lager, you can also feel good about supporting a family owned and operated brewery that takes pride in its heritage and serves a purpose higher than the almighty dollar."
"Not a lot going on in this brew, but that goes for the bad things as well. I would imagine that the flavor would get lost if these guys weren't great brewers and had some off flavors in there or didn't use decent ingredients. All the 'bad' beer should be this good."
"Smells of metal, mouthfeel of water, but there still remains a bite that can not be denied. You can drink them all day, as long as boredom doesn't sit in, although getting buzzed is impossible with this eagle of 4.4 abv. Is it a snob thing to downplay the great American lager? Maybe, but I am not excited to drink this."
"D - It's okay, but not super enjoyable."
"Drinks easy for what it is, could do a few in a pinch"
"D: A tasty and drinkable brew. This beer is really impressive when compared to similarly priced beers."
"There really isn't much to say about this one, other than that I drink it quite a bit (i.e. not worth going down the ASTMD analysis like I would for a craft). Like many of you, I avoid Budweiser and other macros like the plague and can hardly stand most mainstream lagers, preferring to drink water than that swill. But Yuengling lager is an exception. To me, this beer is genuinely good, to the point that I'll often buy a 12-pack and down it in a little over a week's time. If your in an area where crafts are hard to come by, or you need a beer for a party, or your a little short on cash, I highly recommend picking this one up if you've never tried it before."
"This is one of my favorite everyday beers that I can easily drink several in one sitting. It has a dark amber color and a light ring of foam that follows it through the beer. It has a light but indistinguishable hop aroma which is neutral and pairable with foods such as pizza, burgers, and fried foods. The low alcohol content makes it easy drinking through the evening."
"D: I can (and do) drink this beer as much as possible. I always start with a fine craft or import beer and move to this as the night goes on."
"D-A very,very drinkable beer. the tastes stays, even if it were binge session. high volumes can be consumed while constantly appreciating the taste."
"I could have a bunch of these. Easy drinking taste kinda holds it back a bit but overall not bad."
"Good pour into chilled (45F) mug, resulting in a nice white fluffy head. Head dissipates down to a light covering with good clinging lacing. Dark reddish amber color with a 16 on the SRM chart. Light smell of lightly roasted malt with just a hint of hop. It smells stronger than the taste, which is pleasant but nothing notable. Just a little bit of bite from the hops, but nothing else overpowering. Some sweetness from the malt, which seems to be responsible for the lingering aftertaste. Feels great on the tongue and upper pallet, nice carbonation. Not a heavy beer by no means, but a good, pleasant flavor. Good availability, I can find this in the bottle all over, at a reasonable price. Will spread it to my friends at our next gathering."
"D - This is one you could have a few of."
"D - Real easy to drink. Goes down smooth."
"D- Fairly high, considering the price point this beer is a clear winner over its peers. Worth seeking out. Not the best amber/red lager but the best for the price by a long shot."
"Nice beer, and I can see why people try so hard to find it."
"D-Pretty drinkable. Probably wouldn't buy a sixpack of it but was farily suprised when I tried it. Not bad."
"Yuengling Lager, the best all around brew, period. No matter where you go in NC, if you are looking for a decent, solid tasty beer, it is highly likely that the corner store will carry it, the grocery store will have 24 packs of cans for less than 15 bucks, and the bars will have it on tap at the same price as budlight, miller, coors, etc. It is a go-to beer as many have stated and it has become my staple beer of choice over the years."
"D- I would drink this beer again because it's great drinkability. I think that's the best quality of this beer. It's not amazing but it will do for a nice night of relaxing or a game with the guys."
"D-Pretty high considering the style. Meant to be enjoyed, not rushed, for sure but is sessionable. The lager everyone reverts to when in trouble. Great overall beer. No downsides."
"D- Not a bad beer, but I would only buy it if I was at a bar with only BMC. This is drinkable and does go down fairly easily."
"Good amber tones, very copper and a beautiful transparency. A fast fleeting head. A decent smell with a sent of pen ink to my sense, which I find cool. Not a bad amber. A good little malt taste clouds about the back of the mouth. Pretty average as far as craft beers go. Nothing special that jumps out at you but nothing that takes away from it either. A watery feel that almost evaporates across the tongue. Could have a session with this, easily."
"Overall not bad. The drying finish improves the drinkability score by a ton. A little more hop bitterness and a more clean profile would send it through the roof."
"Reasonably priced and one of my favorite beer so far"
"Overall: Sometimes I think there is a Jekyll & Hyde skit going on with Yuengling. Sometimes I try it and get a crisp lager with sulfury yeast driven flavors. Other times, I get this boring too sweet caramel flavor. This time is the latter. This is a step up from the Budweiser but nothing to seek out."
"This is a massively drinkable, clean, little beer, with just enough character to keep one's interest."
"drinkability: refreshing and palatable, the quality of Yuengling speaks for itself. Definitely a beer that can be enjoyed regularly."
"A solid session beer for even the budget-conscious, and one that comes through with a lot more character than the rest."
"Poured into a pint glass a light amber-orange with a 2 finger light foamy head. Low retention. Smells of sweet roasted almonds. Cider-like in taste with a subtle hint of caramel. Moderately carbonated with a dry finish that is pleasant and refreshing. This beer is quite flavorful and has great personality along with being very well priced (the same price as Budweiser but better in quality by leaps and bounds). A great go-to beer when you are strapped for cash."
"This beer bites sharply on the tip of your tongue and the lips, but it isn't any reason to dislike it. I enjoy the carbonation that hits you. The nice alcohol feeling that hits you is also very inviting, surprising for such a low ABV beer. However, 12 of these are easy enough to drink and have a good time."
"D: I would drink this anytime anywhere. It is good at the bar, good with my dinner, and good at the game. It is a magical beer."
"Drinkability: Far from an outstanding beer, this is pretty average overall. However, it is usually priced about the same as BMC beers and is much more flavorful while remaining just as sessionable. A superb standby if all else fails."
"M/D - Watery feel and taste but with 4.4% ABV your not going to get a lot of body and it feels appropriate anyway. Intelligent folk around here will pick this up rather than a BMC and gives hope there is desire to taste beer out there, A Good brew at a good price."
"First had this beer at bachelor party for my brother in law. Smells wonderful and the taste is unique, but a taste that makes you want more. This is a mans beer for sure. Was a little intimidated by the green bottle, but the green bottle is just a small price for a good beer such as this."
"Pretty easy drinking beer. If it was available here I would probably keep some in the fridge during the summer months."
"Amber colored clear beer that pours a fine 1"" head that disspates really quickly. Fine carbonation bubbles rise quickly to the top. Smell is average at best. Not very much there to smell. Taste is malty and sweet with a quick bitter end. It's a good lager but doesn't standout. Carbonation leaves quickly so taste gets worse as you drink. Light bodied and light carbonation. Good to drink for price."
"D- It's an easy drinker, but sort of lacking a ""wow"" factor. It becomes a little bland in the middle of a session (like drinking 3-4 pints while watching soccer with your brother-in-law). It's a nice option when looking for a something straight forward on the East Coast."
"D: I can drink this any time. its one of my favorites and one of the best. High Recommended!"
" A nice light amber color with a small head & a sweet natural earthy smell. The taste is a nice light, crisp sweet beer with a malty/hoppy taste. This is a very drinkable beer due to it's lightness."
"Pours a clear amber with a two-finger off-white head which dissapted quickly, No lace to speak of. Nose is lemon, faint spice, corn and some bready malt. Taste is lemon, grain (corn), presence of sweet malt and the tiniest hop tinge. The mouthfeel is medium or lighter. There is decent carbonation but it gives the beer only a tiny edge. No aftertaste to speak of. This beer is the only macro I can still tolerate - not fantastic, but no awful either."
"D- this is where this beer shines. This is a standard where I come from and it is for a reason. Its so good for a bbq and a long day of pounding. God bless."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink on a hot day although there isn't enough in the taste department to be anything special. An inoffensive thirst quencher."
"Drinkability: A go to if you find yourself in a dive bar anywhere near the state of PA. Has a decent malt profile that doesn't really get in the way of anything else. While you won't find me picking this up at my local, you might find me going for this with a basket of hot wings."
"Overall, this must have been a fresh keg because it was the best Yuengling I have ever had. It had none of the musty notes I have noticed from other bottles, cans, and pints on draft I have had before. I drank it to celebrate the US beating Algeria and it didn't let me down."
"Notes: A couple of notches above the awful macro mainstream but little else."
"Pours a dark amber. A lot of sweetness and malt up front in this lager. Refreshing taste. Hints of caramel flavor. Very smooth mouthfeel in this American Amber Lager. Doesn't have huge flavor, but a well done subtlety exists. High drinkability despite the lack of flavor."
"This is definitely one of my favorites to have around to make the real good stuff go farther, and is good for quenching your thirst after a long day."
"A thin beer, and perhaps a very good session beer. It has a lot of the qualities of macro with a little more flavoring. The hop is less pronounced on the tongue. Easy to drink and perhaps very nice after a long hot day."
"Went great with my chopped pork sandwich, one of the best meals I have ever had!"
"D - Very drinkable, perhaps the best choice if you just want something refreshing and nothing to sit and talk about with your friend. This isn't a conversational beer, just a beer to quench your thirst."
"Not something I'd seek out but it did go down quickly and it was $1 for a pint on tap. Good value for the money here. Especially when compared to its competition."
"Amber but not very reddish, more copper. This beer has a pleasant slight maltiness. Overall taste is clean, balanced, unadventurous, with the bit of maltiness being the defining character like this style should. The mouth is a bit thin and prickly like most macro lagers, and carbonation is rather high. While nothing stands out, this is a decent and easily available lager if you like slight maltiness. I think Creemore Springs is a far more delicious beer of this type, but it's unfortunately not widely available."
"RJT"
"Not bad, but really nothing stands out. Probably goes best with plain traditional food ""meat and potatoes""."
"This would be a go-to party beer if it were available in New England. Thankfully, we have 'Gansett to fill that void, but man, would I love some choices within the low price point category."
"Overall so glad I finally got the chance to try this beer. Not my favorite style but it make a great thirst quencher on a hot day. Thanks gar."
"O: A great example to style. Only recommendation is for more of the darker malt presence in aroma and taste."
"This is my all time favorite and the one that is always available in my home. (Thus the lofty ratings). Many others are in a rotation of the brews I love to try, to bring in some variety, or to enjoy as seasonals are released. In bottle or on tap, this is hands-down my benchmark for comparisons."
"The beer pours a clear yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is corn, wheat and earthy hops. The flavor is a lot of corn and bready malts with some very light hopping. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not terrible but not something would like to try again."
"D: Easy to drink red lager/am lager. I would order another one."
"As far as this style is concerned, I'm damn happy we get Brooklyn and not this one."
"D: If this is selling for the same price as Bud back east then they are getting a true deal. This is good stuff, I'm glad I finally got to try a beer from the oldest brewery in the US."
"Final Thoughts: Well, as I commented about Molson earlier, this beer seems to be very similar to Molson Canadian, in that it is a marker beer. When you think, what an average generic beer should taste like, this one fits the bill. It's not bad, it's just...well what it is. I'd pickup a six pack for the right price of course, but it's not going to knock your socks off."
"I'd say the flavor is one of the best that America has to offer. I prefer it over the major 'domestic' three. The color is more brilliant, the head is nice, and you can drink [way] more than one."
"Orangey amber with a short-lived head. The aroma is pretty grainy with some honey and caramel notes. Similar taste with some orange zest and red apple skin toward the finish. Crisp and dry, this makes for a nice after work beer to have with dinner to prime the palate for the good stuff."
"Pours a dark golden color or light amber. Head was slightly foamy and bubbly, went to ring rather quick though. Aroma was malty and wheaty with slight hints of sweetness to it. However, the wheat dominated the taste with slight bits of malts to it and minimal bitterness if any. Body was a little bit watery. Overall I can see why people would drink this as an any occasion beer, but I'm not a huge fan."
"I've had this beer so many times in so many contexts, I guess I've never really sat down & seriously critiqued it. So much history with this that it's almost unfair to review it -- I've had this pulling all-nighters, moving, at weddings, watching bands, playing in bands, & just hanging out. Not the greatest, but reliable & never disappointing. Definitely a workhorse beer, wide available, inexpensive, & always a welcome alternative to macros. I don't mean to make this review sound like an ad, but it's got a special place in my heart. And it's really easy drinking."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is faint..maybe a little grainy.Taste is a little bready and toasty.A pretty refreshing beer that probably is the perfect summer outing beer.If you haven't tried one I would recommend to give at least one shot.I have always drank this and will continue to do so in the future."
"As an Oregonian for most of my life, I have only recently had a chance to try Yuengling, and I must say it's not bad. Its amber hue is better looking than most general lager, and the taste follows suit. The nose is fairly normal, and the mouthfeel isn't anything to write home about. Nevertheless, this is an easy drinking lager that's easy to find, and a welcomed alternative to BMC & Co."
"Mouthfeel was thin and well carbonated. Nice enough for the style. Easy to drink beer that is much better than your average BMC, but still more like those beers than like craft beer."
"Notes: This is definitely above the level of BMC. However, since it is listed as an amber lager I was expecting more out of it. It lived up to that expectation, but it didn't surpass, which is why I feel it deserves the ""average"" rating. I would much rather have this than BMC when I want a cheaper beer, however I wouldn't consider this a volume beer. It fits what it is trying to be very nicely."
"Taste is very crisp an light there is some malt but not too much the hops are crisp and light it's a really easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability is average, I could put a few of these down, but I really dont want to."
"This beer isn't going to wow you, but it's inexpensive, unoffensive, and better than the other mass-produced American lagers."
"Huzzah to the nightcap."
"Overall, as a cheap lager this isn't half bad and if you're on a budget, go for it. However, if you're looking for a delicious world-class lager, look elsewhere."
"Overall, this is a beer you would want to drink if you don't want to spend a lot. Some bars that serve it, in my experiences, have it as a weekly or daily special, so you'll likely get a great deal on a draft or pitcher."
"Good beer. This is what Bud Light should have been. This is the kind of beer that after working on the car, or while mowing the grass, you crave like a slice of pizza. Every time you think of it it tastes different in order to accommodate your craving. Basically, it's a great, light, and slightly different beer that is wonderful for drinking throughout the day. If I could get a day off to just sit around the house, this would be one of the beers I would be nursing, all day long."
"Highly decent and very easy to slam."
"I remember the first time I had a Yuengling and I can never refuse one ever since. It has a good amalgam of everything you want in a beer."
"Drinkability as always for this beer is quite impeccable."
"Pours a nice medium amber color with about a one finger head that leaves quickly and doesnt leave any lacing. The color is very nice. The nose is very grainy, citrusy, and a little malty. The taste is light bodied and citrusy as well as very grainy. Kindof bitter, but not from the hops. A little watery, but not over the top like a bud or miller. Average mouthfeel but the awkward bitterness doesnt make it an extremely drinkable beer."
"Beer is a light shade of amber with a decent head that fades. The smell is a nice grain aroma. Taste is a bit sweet with citrus and a slightly bitter finish. It has a medium feel with crispness and a dry finish. Goes down easy and is an excellent session brew."
"A slight nutty malt flavor in the mouth, very smooth. Not bad for a ""big"" brewer beer, will try again"
"Medium copper body with lighter edges. Pinkie finger of dirty beige head. Some lacing. Muted nose with hints of. honeyish malts. Some toasted grains. Light fruitiness. Taste starts off with mild grain astringency, some cardboard, and a little caramel. A little more caramel comes through along with a dash of fruit and a pinch of earthy tobacco. Mild, vague hop bitterness and some cooked vegetables in the finish. Moderate body, easy drinking, very quaffable, if not the tastiest beer I've had."
"This is a great beer for people to try, cheap and great tasting, and I enjoy it every time I have one."
"Overall, a very decent example of the style, worth trying if you never have."
"A classic american brew to be enjoyed all times, but especially on those hot summer days."
"Overall: Good session beer. Hot too harsh and very palatable."
"Ah, Yuengling Lager. An old friend that I discovered many years ago working in a liquor store. Have to agree---cans are way to go with this brew. Less chance of skunk and really do taste better. So, at 4.75 a six pack locally, a real no brainer. Tastes good, drinks easy, locally brewed and real old school. My go to all arounder for under 20 a case."
"watching football and drinking all day though."
"Color is golden with thick head when poured. My rating may be biased since I am partial to IPAs and don't particuarly care for American Lager, but Yuengling is in my opinion one of the better mass produce American Lagers. Though not spectacular, it has a good taste and the price is extremely right."
"D: Muted flavors enhance the drinkability for some, if the purpose is to session this one. For me personally, it's okay for that reason, however, the smell of this beer is difficult to ignore. Drinking this one from the bottle will minimize contact with it's strange (or awful?) scent."
"D - This is my go to beer when buying for the masses. You can really put down a bunch of these no problem."
"D: easy to drink, probably the best cheap american lager."
"Overall- A good representation of the american lager style. One of the best I have tried but being an Ale guy I am more apt to pick up something else."
"I like this lager! It has a nice amber appearance that has leaves a decent lace on the glass. Though the smell is not to strong it has a nice hint of hops. The taste is good with a balance amount of ingredients from the malts and hops neither overpowering. The mouthfeel is nice and full bodied with a smooth drinkability. Good beer just not very much on abv%."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Fabulous everyday beer, and at under $20/case, you can afford to do so. Not too heavy, not to light. The bottles always have a smell that's not off, but not wholesome like on draft. The beer still pairs well with almost anything you're eating or is fine by itself on an evening out or home watching sports"
"Yuengling Traditional Lager poures a darker brown color, with a good size head. It has a kinda of stale smell, and same thing with the taste. Overall its not a really bad taste, but its nothing too speical. Even though this beer wasnt too heavy, I feel its hard to drink more then one, it is filling, and the more you drink the more the stale tastes become present. Overall this beer is pretty average at best, it is better then some other beers out there, but defently not a first round choice."
"D: session-worthy levels of lagered bliss. So darned good."
"Taste, smooth, no hop presence, lighter than its appearance. Mouthfeel, there is less and less to pick up on further down the bottle. Drinkable sure, but I look at this as one of those introductory beers into craft brewing like anything by SA. I dunno, I guess this is the stuff, its everywhere in Philly, NJ & NY when I'm out there."
"Clear copper with a decent two finger eggshell head of dense foam that leaves scraps of lace behind on the glass. The nose is sweet corny grits and a whiff of floral hops. The flavors are mildly sweet and adjuncty with minimal hop flavors to balance. Light bodied with seltzery carbonation. A good,easy drinking,every day kind of brew."
"Thin, watery, and quite crisp on the tongue. Not bad, there's just nothing to go on really; I will say it is refreshing for sure. This is the go-to lager for easy, everyday drinking purposes. Great on a summer day. It is miles ahead of the competition."
"D: Goes down very easy, I finish one and immediately want to reach for another one. An excellent summer beer. More character than a typical american lager. Serve this to your BMC loving fans as a great starter beer on the way to IPAs and RISs. Well worth trying, I loved in in grad school in FL and wish I could get this in KY."
"This beer has a really nice ruby-amber color to it. An excellent Red Lager, heavily influenced by the German and Irish immigrants whom lived in Pennsylvania. This is a really good authentic American beer, and being that it is from America's oldest brewery at the same time makes this beer a staple in American Beer history, and in small brew legacies. This beer is sweeter than I thought it was going to be, small but decent head, ok retention, and kicks Anheuser Busch out of the park, Yuengling vs Budweiser ""The American Lager," Yuengling wins that fight by far. I highly suggest this beer."
"It is a good drinkable beer and reliable and just as tasty as it has always been."
"Yuengling is by far the best beer for the money. I hope all of you that can't get it yet will someday be able to."
"Best on tap (I think that about most beers...). Better if not too cold as well- tell the bartender to skip the frosty mug on this one. Think I'll stop out tonight for one!"
"Overall, I think this is a good beer. Not as good as a craft brewed amber but certainly way ahead of the other U.S. macro brewing companies. Tough to beat in the summer and easy on the wallet."
"Pours a light, mostly clear amber straw with about a finger of goldenrod-white head that produces some average lacing. The nose contains some grapefruit, some orange peel, and a little bit of subtle pine. The taste is primarily a bland maltiness with a steady kick of bitterness and a sort of light wheaty quality behind it all. The body is on the high end of the light spectrum, has a kind of watery quality, punctuated by a healthy dose of carbonation, producing a pretty drinkable, if not altogether favorable brew."
"Excellent brew. Even my very picky wife loves this lager. It is simply a great tasting lager with a perfect finish with no aftertaste. Availability is limited geographically, so you may need to drive to find it. I can see why people around here drive 3.5 hours to Tennessee to buy it and bring it back!"
"Food Pairings - If you use beer in your chili, this would be a good one to try, and a good beer to drink with it as well. Other then that, think pub food and anything with a little bit of fat that needs something to cut through that flavor (most stews, steaks, oily fish, etc)"
"F: Finishes crisp and slightly dry. The tons of bubbles seem to leave their mark on the mouth with a little tingly feeling. Some lingering sweet syrupy tastes and feel that turns a little unpleasant. Slight bitterness. A little juicy flavor comes through the center of the finish just after the swallow."
"I have drank hundreds of these bad-boys and would have no problem drinking hundreds more. I first had this beer about 6-7 years ago and was blown away by the price/flavor ratio. Yuengling is cheaper than Budweiser and tastes infinitely better. This is a solid choice any time and won't lead to disappointment."
"For me this beer is Just OK I can taste plenty of Malt but almost no Hops.."
"At last got to try this historic brew on a recent trip to Florida. Pours a nice amber with a head that quickly leaves. Not much aroma, a litel malt. Taste is nice, malty crisp with a little citrus hint. Super drinkable and easy to enjoy on a nice hot day. This a great choice when all else is nothing but Bud, Miller or Coors. Or if you just want a simple nice clean amber lager. I enjoyed it."
"If you haven't, give it a try..."
"D-goes down easy and has a good amount of flavor. the tastes are somewhat off; but not bad for america's oldest brewery."
"Value: Excellent!"
"D and Notes - This is my session beer of choice. I find myself spending Saturday afternoons when there are no obligations working on some Yuengling's. They always sit nice and light. The beer is actually always stored with the ""better beer"" section in all my grocery stores. I'll see it sit next to Saranac and/or Sierra Nevada. The price is always right too."
"You'll find this next to the Budweiser in most grocery stores on the eastern seaboard. It costs about the same. It's a much better beer. Don't expect this to top any all-time great lists, but it's hard to beat when you're looking to pick up a six pack to bring to the game."
"They flow very easily. As for the beer, the color is god, has a bit of an aftertaste I am not wild about and a bit of a bitter flavor. Not a beer I would want one or two of if I had the choice but for all day drinking this is top notch. All in all if you compare this to any of the craft brews it will get smoked, but it kicks the crap out of any mass produced beers on the market and I'd take it any day over those for the price. Super Value."
"Overall: A refreshing lager that allows enough flavor and character through to give you something to ponder while drinking this beer. This is anything but a resemblance to the Light American Lagers of AB-InBev or Miller Coors. The bottle states ""Original Amber Beer", and while one should not expect the mouthfeel or body of a craft Amber Ale, the malt character certainly defines this beer as a clean and refreshing lager with well balanced flavor and bitterness. A light lager with definition and clarity is refreshing and enlightening. Though, the carbonation could be backed off a bit to allow more malt richness to surround the tongue."
"One general warning though. Having gone to college outside Philadelphia, but also having family in Florida, I have to say, the discrepancy between the lots brewed in PA and FL seems to be large. I've always loved it in PA, and it's been hit or miss in FL."
"D – The best of a bad style. Cheap, very drinkable, tastes good; a winner."
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: High. How do I know? I've had a ton of this in my day. It was one of the two beers that I drank regularly after I weaned myself off college beer and before I discovered craft beer. There's a lot of flavor compared to just about any macro offering, and I personally think it stacks up quite well against some of the better Amber lagers out there, as well (though I'll be the first to admit that my judgment might be clouded by geography and nostalgia). Simple, sturdy and tasty...everyone should be fortunate enough to have a beer like this available to ""switch things up"" a bit from our typical high-gravity, palate-crushing fare when such a beer is called for and one would prefer not to support worldwide, mass-producing brewing conglomerates."
"d: First I've had in many years, I liked it more than I thought I would."
"Found myself making the choice to get a six pack of this while in WV where the pickings are slightly slim. This is a good brew for a 4.4 abv - and relatively enjoyable overall . I would say this one is a go to if your choices are limited. Highly recommended over some of the other low abv readily available ABC brews available."
"Compared to an adjunct lager, this is pretty choice. Compared to a craft brewed amber lager, this is the bottom of the barrel and my score reflects the latter."
"Not the best but not the worst either by a long shot. If I was in the mood for something smooth, cold, and refreshing I'd take this over a large majority of the other BMC selections out there any day."
"Drinkability: A decent macro-brew. Certainly nothing special but, for the price, it's one of the best macro-brews you can get."
"Notes - Decent carbonation along with a balanced mouthfeel. All that and being very drinkable make this beer a winner."
"D: Somewhat bland, but still pretty tasty for a macro. Much better than your typical BMC. I can't get this is CT, but certainly enjoy a few Yuenglings when I have a chance."
"D - Nothing special, but pretty good on the scale of traditional American lagers."
"While the flavor & aroma aren't particularly strong, they are more pronounced than any BMC offerings. Very refreshing. I also prefer this to their Black & Tan. Not bad at all for <$6/6-pack"
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a pilsner glass. It is light copper in color with a head made of white bubbles. There is lots of carbonation rising in the glass. The aroma is full of floral and bitter hops with a bit of earthy yeast. All I wrote about the taste is sweet malt & fruity hops, but I gave it a 4 rating, so I must have liked it. It has a medium body and lots of carbonation. I find this beer to be very drinkable, although the high carbonation levels may be a limiting factor."
"D: Quite Quaffable."
"D: Again, hometown brew...perfect drinkability. Just light enough to be a session lager."
"D- Pretty good macro, very drinkable, you could easily go through a good amount of these"
"D: A pretty easy drinking beer whose quality boarders between a macro and a micro. Could definitely session a bunch of these and I'll drink a few on occasion when the only alternative is American Adjuncts."
"Definitely drinkable, and at 4.4% good for a session."
"This beer made a good first impression but then seemed to fade away quickly. The head evaporated. The beer went flat. In short, this beer, if you like crisp-ish lagers with a citrus background, is probably for you. But it is not for me. It was a little sweet or yellow-beer tasting. Overall, I was disappointed with quality since I am a fan of Yuengling's Black and Tan. I was expecting something softer and more complex."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a good beer that is fairly unique in flavor, scent and feel. Definitely a brew I will have to try again"
"D: I could drink about a million of these, and have tried several times during college. A great beer for slugging down some wings or a burger, or just to enjoy on a hot summer day. Cheers!"
"Great beer for all kinds of situations. And it comes in cans!"
"D-Goes down pretty easy. I remember it being quite a bit better and the corn was not as dominant in my memory. I guess my palate has developed. This is still a nice, cheap everyday drinker."
"Just ask for a lager. Everyone in PA knows what you want. If you need to clarify, it is pronounced YING-LING."
"Drinkablity: Tasty and accessible brew. A very good regional brew."
"First off, thanks RustyDiamond for the beer, i've been craving this stuff for a year. This is an American standard that needs to make it our here on the west coast. It may seem a bit watered down from what most people are saying they drink everyday, but compared to it's own style, this beer is the goods. Malty overtones with a clean light finish. Simple but solid, I may need to set up another trade to get some more."
"(bottle into pint glass) I may be very biased as this has always been a staple, but I love this one! Pours a beautiful deep amber color with a creamy head and good lacing. Nose is of a slight toffee sweetness, and a slight hop mixed in. Drinks very smooth with a slight sharp bite of the hops at the end. A little heavier than most macrobrewed lagers (as Yuengling is hardly small anymore) but not as overbearingly in your face as some micros. A great middle of the road choice. Excellent compliment to a chargrilled burger!"
"It is more flavorful and fuller bodied than it's macro counterparts, so I give it a little bump in drinkability. Overall, this is a decent alternative to the macro mainstays."
"D - I could have a couple of these on a hot day. Pretty drinkable brew wish it was available in CT just so maybe it would be at more picnics that I go to."
"D: Extremely drinkable. In my opinion, this is the best of the uninspired macros."
"Reasonably priced and readily available in a good portion of the eastern US, this is a great alternative to other mass produced American lagers. It's a no frills utilitarian brew, but tasty nonetheless and a mainstay in my fridge."
"D - Always a nice find among the crowd of usual suspects at a bar or party, definitely a beer that I have more than one of when I'm drinking it."
"D- This is an easy drinking beer, maybe the best lager out there."
"a very malty almost biscuit sweet flavour most defines this beer. decent colour and a lacking nose are made up for by the sessionable nature of the beer. good head colour and pleasing dark body. very easy drinking with a low level of carbonation."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into a 23 ounce glass. Golden amber in appearance with about an inch of foamy head. Medium carbonation that bubbles to the top of the glass. Not an overly strong scent but I can detect some roasted malts. The taste is smooth and balanced. Malts and hops seem about balanced not real after taste. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Very drinkable to me. One of my stand by beers because over the years it has been very thirst quenching and a pleasure to drink. Today it is providing a nice change up from the heavier seasonal beers."
"Side note; if you have the chance take the brewery tour, its free and well worth it."
"D- Like I said earlier, I could drink these all day. On a warm summer day after work I can sit out on the back deck and drink these all day."
"This is nowhere near my favorite beer, but there are a lot of times when I'll order a ""lager"" when I'm back east just on principle or for nostalgic reasons."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and tasty. Great alternative to BMC products. Great refreshing beer. Way better than a lot of macros out there."
"This is a personal favorite of mine. Being from PA, its almost ingrained in me to enjoy this beer. I love the taste, I love the price, and I love the idea of the history of this beer. Great beer for ""discerning"" college beer aficianados; it isn't quite on the level of other craft beers, but it blows AB and other mass beers out of the water."
"D- Really drinkable. Great session lager."
"Pour samber with two fingers of head. The head dissapears almost immediately though. The smell is about half and half lager Flavor does no tliv eup to the malt smell at all. There is a much more obvious malt taste than a macro lager, but it's still a very plain and slightly watery tasting beer. Not heavily carbonated at all. Reminds me of a less-flavorful amber bock more than anything. Very drinkable, but nt particularly special. Still an old dfavorite."
"D- Again very good. It's a little filling, but if you're a pro you can drink it all night. It also pairs well with just about any kind of food. I know this from experience, I'm a Pennsylvania native so I drink it with just about every dinner. A great brew all around. The only down side is it a non-union American brewery, oh well."
"From the oldest brewery in the US, and growing faster than any brewer this size. My only regret is I can't get in LA."
"Draft: Poured a deep amber color lager with a medium foray head with OK retention. Aroma of nice creamy caramel malt with light sweet notes. Taste is refreshing and easily drinkable with creamy texture and some well balanced caramel malt. Body is fuller then average with great carbonation and a nice creamy texture. Nothing earth shattering but very well done nonetheless."
"D: A pretty decent lager; good for a nice, reliable and refreshing drink when no better beers are present. Personally I feel that the on-tap version of this beer is much better than what you get from the bottle."
"Decent drinking, we look to this beer as a filler to switch things up. All in all, at least a step or two above most mass-produced lagers."
"Overall, Yuengling is a good beer for a good price. In any general bar setting with little drink variety, I'll take this in a pinch over the standard brand-name beers. It's nearly everywhere you go in PA, so I usually have this to fall back on."
"Got turned on to this when I was in Harrisburg 2 1/2 years ago. It is definately a worth while regular drinking beer that puts any Budweiser or Miller product to shame. If I could get this in Michigan or Ohio, it would be my regular drinking beer instead of Labatt Blue. About twice a year, I will make a road trip to PA (3 hour drive) from Toledo, OH area and get a couple of cases to have on hand."
"Drinkable and I suppose I could get used to it if it was around. It's better than Rolling Rock, but I think there are better lagers around my neck of the woods (Longboard), and definately a lot better beer in the pale ale category."
"Thin in the mouth, not a lot of flavor, some back of the mouth flavor, nothing offensive just nothing there. Some cereal, maybe corn like flavor at the back, beer is wet and cold. Nothing special here."
"*Originally reviewed on September 8, 2009."
"Had never ever heard of this beer. But was on vacation in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. My wife and I went to dinner at a local restuarant on the beach and they had this stuff on tap. I was curious--wife got the usual and I tried one of these beers. Could not believe it! May have been the most flavorful beer I have ever had. I am lobbying the Indiana State alcohol board to allow this beer to come into Indiana. Hopefully it happen."
"There's really nothing profound to say about Yuengling. It's priced like the big 3 macro lagers but has much more flavor and is very drinkable. There are better lagers out there, sure, but this is always a great go to beer that I'm happy to keep in my fridge."
"sadly i live in Western CT and have to take a short ride down the ol' road to pick up a case but damn, it's worth it!"
"I grew up in PA and this is the beer of choice at the pub, especially when bud and coors are next to it on the tap. It has a nice color in the glass with a thin layer of foam (i hate when they don't leave enough to capture the aroma). It has a nice carbonated feel in the mouth with the taste of mostly hops with a little hops."
"From the cold can, this amber lager tastes very refreshing and light, with a bit of nutty malt sweetness. Some huskiness though. The mouthfeel is light with soft, but high carbonation. Aftertaste is not particularly inspiring, a little off and indicative of adjuncts (?). Drink it cold, and don't think about it too much. Like I said, I enjoy this beer for what it is: easy and cheap."
"This is far from a complex beer you would mull over. It is too carbonated and a little too light in flavor. However, it is a fine quaffer with enough flavor to keep it interesting. It is also from ""America's Oldest Brewery."" As mentioned before, it is a quality beer for the price."
"At the very least, one must acknowledge the great significance the Yuengling Brewery has in the American history of craft beer. I went to a tour of the brewery this past weekend and now look at this brewery in a much different and positive light."
"Overall, an easy drinker, but I think this one is alot of hype for those outside of a distribution area. A refreshing beer, but a bit too light in flavor for me to seek this out again."
" This is pretty nice on tap."
"Review from notes taken on: 9/28/09"
"Clear light amber/golden pour. Not much of a head. What little there was disappeared quickly. Sweet cereal smell with a hint of vinegar. I was kind of expecting this to taste fairly awful, but that wasn't the case. Taste was sweet with some metallic notes as well. I wouldn't neccesarily say it's good, but it's far from bad. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't sit and session it all day."
"Pours a clear, golden/amber color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale hops, yeast, slight sweet malt, and some pale malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hops, yeast, pale malt, and some sweet malt in the finish. Overall, a decent lager that has no outstanding feature."
"This is better than pretty much any of the BMCs out there."
"Drinkability is fantastic! A very decent brew that would make a great session beer! I feel it would be a good beer to introduce someone to a lager! This is one of my favorite beers!"
"Yuengling pours a predictable amber to dark copper with a small white head that dissipated quickly and totally, leaving no lace behind. Aromas are ... Not a whole lot to talk about! Musty grains, a sweet malt background, and metallic. Flavors are similar, but luckily I don't taste much metallic/skunk. It's just a really mellow, crisp, easy drinking lager that both reminds me of BMC and also sets itself apart from the rest. It's a damn good pizza beer, for sure."
"D - When i was young, we always thought Yuengling Lager (just ""Lager"" to most of us in Southeast PA) was a premium brew. My palate has changed but felt good to crack one open and review. An all around decent beer thats better than most BMC products."
"D- Definitely a drinkable lager. Much better than most BMC macros, and this is definitely my go-to in college, especially for beer-pong and keggers. Go Tigers!"
"While at a crowded bar in NYC, this was the only beer not readily available in MA, so this was my beer of the evening. I have heard so much about the history of this brewery, but never tried their product. Poured a copper red color, very little head. Sort of a musty smell. Taste was a bit metallic and bitter. Very light and mellow mouthfeel though. While not insanely flavorful, it was not repulsive. Lower in alcohol than I expected. Goes down smoothly, so I could handle a few pints at a time. Pretty average overall."
"This beer should really be compared to American Macro Lagers since this is the segment of the market that it really competes with since a case of bottles in the Mid-Atlantic is usually around ~18, much like BMC. A much better beer than the competitors, price-wise at least and a beer that even BA's can find value in"
"The dark gold to light brown beer with a small head looked fairly regular to me in my glass, but the aroma of wheat was very much there. I liked the first taste as the crisp lager stood up with a little bit of hops in a light malty base. I found drinking it to be easy and good pairing with a stuffed roast beef hero."
"Overall: Readily available in stores in these parts and makes for a decent choice for a lager on a budget."
"D- Highly drinkable beer. Easily a beer you'd have no problem knocking down a few. Overall a solid beer albeit slightly overrated."
"Poured from a pint bottle into a beer glass. Brilliant reddish amber colour with plenty activity going on. Settles with a thin head and no lacing at all. It has a flower hop smell with vinegary sourness. It has a stinging taste, firm with plenty of bitterness. Good beer to have when you are not looking for anything too heavy or fancy."
"D: This is a beer that I will drink again"
"D - very drinkable, a great goto beer when you are not in the mood for something fancy. Comes in cans!"
"D. A good drinkable lager, Not like the popular lagers. I believe this beer is better on tap. especialy if it is shipped long distanses. PA to FL."
"I think this is better drank from the bottle, cold, or on draft. Pooring from the bottle tended to release flavors that I didn't like in the beer."
"Drinkability- Finally got to try this beer. About what I expected..easy to drink and fairly tasty."
"Goes down very easy, I can always session Yuengling."
"I was amazed to see this in my fridge. My roommate is in the National Guard and found this at the duty free shop. I had thought it impossible to find in MA."
" Pours a medium brown color. Very bubbly, with a vanishing but healthy head. This beer is like taking a Bud heavy or a Coors or a MGD and saying I want better than this. Yuengling is a traditional American (fuck yeah) lager that lives up to its colonial roots. Not only is it cheap, it also beats every stupid macro in the northern US and want to drink a good beer that you can only find in the south...yuengling. The taste is hardy and the drinkability is beyond comparison. If your one of those people who chooses to get drunk, and chooses to get drunk off beer, screw all the others, yuengling is your go to fuckbuddy."
"Drinkability is super high. I could, and have drank these all day. Just enough taste to satisfy but still keep it highly sessionable, the benchmark American lager in my opinion. Also, one of the only beers I prefer out of a can."
"Drinkability> Okay, so my dear friend Thadd LaRue (who never steers me wrong) is right once again... If this was as available in SF as PBR I would never touch the blue ribbon again. Good stuff, for whatever the hell style you want to call it."
"Cheers!!!"
"D - this is a rock solid brew. very consistent, and very refreshing. noting off at all. all aspects of this beer are above par. it does lack complexity, but thats not quite what they're going for. i think it hits it's target, and deserves credit for that. Great choice among macros. I'll have another!"
"D- Always smooth and refreshing"
"Drinkability- This is an old standard of mine. It's the kind of beer that doesn't knock your socks of but it's always good in a pinch. Really nice on a summer day and just as pleasant in a bottle as it is on draft. No bar or party should be without it. It's easy enough for the masses but has enough taste and body to please a legit beer drinker."
"Thin, watery mouthfeel. Overall I wasn't expecting much from this beer and it was better than I though it would be."
"Personally: I grew up with Yuengling, but yet again who has not in the last 15 years around greater Philly? I admire the company a great deal and their commitment to the local beer industry and the town of Pottsville is admirable. As for the beer, like anything as you get older the novelty wears and taste buds grow and change...still, there are plenty of good memories associated with it and for that it deserves a thumbs up."
"An American classic. It's decent, doable, and I could go for it again if I'm at an event when Miller Lite and Corona are the other only options. This was the beer of choice at the wedding rehersal dinner and afterparty I attended."
"D- Very easy to drink, usually my go to when the only other options are BMC."
"Pours an amber color with a very slight head to it. The smell is of malt and a very faint hop aroma on the back end. The overall taste is very smooth, there is a malt presence up front that is a majority of the beer, with an ever so slight hop backbone. Mouthfeel is a lower carbonation level. The drinkability is slightly above average, it is an easy beer to drink, not very complex but nothing to run from."
"Not my absolute favorite, but one of the best valued quality lagers available."
"just because i think Nugget Nectar and DFH Squall and Smuttynose IPA and other superb craft brews are among the best brews out there doesn't take away one iota the pleasure i get from the unflappable Yuengling Lager!"
"D: A high quality brew steeped in deep tradition, a legend in my home area. I'm probably a bit biased as it's my first beer love, but who cares, if these rankings aren't about passion what else are they based upon? This is a must try for all beer lovers, one of the original greats!"
"I don't really see what so many people seem to enjoy about Yuengling so much.. It seems to be a beer where it's typical drinkers realize that Bud and Coors are garbage, but they aren't really in the know about any good craft breweries.. While it certainly does deserve respect above bud and coors and such, I don't find it to be THAT much better really.. its quite bland overall with little to enjoy. Sure, it doesn't just taste like corn adjunt, but theres not much malt or hop to the flavor, either. I suppose its the type of thing people want to have a party where you can drink a lot of it and there is still not too much flavor.. There are certainly better options out there and I find it hard to believe anyone could prefer this beer over any other. but again, it is still better than being stuck with BMC, I guess."
"D: This is one of my all time favorites. Perfect paired with food and can consumed in quantity. Very nice and is good every season."
"Future outlook: Decent, unadventurous beer that delivers on being a nicely sessionable beer. A PA beer that doesn't get distributed here, so I don't envision buying....though my father often has it, so I will gladly have it again."
"I like to think of it this way. I am at the ball game and I get a choice of Bud, Coors, Miller, or Yuengling. There is no competition I go with Yuengling every time."
"Obviously this is one that splits the obvious -you've got some serious Yuengling devotees out there. Overall, I think it's a solid lager, substantially better than BMC, but not even close to the quality of a craft ale (or even lager, for that matter). Pour is fine - amber color with a ton of busy bubbles seen through the crystal clear beer. Small slighty off-white head that dissolves quickly. Nose is grainy malt - some sweet corn in there. Nothing much else going on. Flavor is similar. Corny water in the back of the mouth, then stronger dirty candy malt with that graininess still. A little waterier than I'd expect. Gotta rank it high, cause I do seem to drink a lot of these, although I'd prefer literally any craft. Nonetheless, it is what it is (half the price of the cheapest craft at most places in DC)."
"I really wanted to like this beer since alot of people i know really like it. Honestly for some reason it reminds me of like a rich mans PBR. Its not a horrible beer, it just isn't very good, and not nearly as good as all the macro drinkers make it sound. the taste did remind me of PBR some. i don't think i'll drink this again unless its free."
"Pours clear amber with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing. Smells of faint amber malt and that strange, typical adjunct taste, without much else to report. The taste is somehow even more characterless and underwhelming. Feel is light and fizzy. Not offensive, just worthless."
"M-On tap this is very smooth and creamy, less so in the can or bottle. Light carbonation. We say that in the coal region beer is like water, and this is usually the one that comes to mind. The other night I showed up an hour before last call, had 5 pints, and left wanting more of the same."
"Overall, if this beer is readily accessible and cheap in your region, certainly superior to most comparable beers. Would I go out of my way to get it however? Probably not."
"This is a great beer for the price."
"Well, its better than the aroma would imply.. Tastier than most lagers... Maltiness balanced with the hops.. Not earth shattering but a nice easy session lager"
"Here in Central PA, we order these just by saying ""lager"". The bartender knows. Slight reddish tint from the can into my pint glass. Smelled of grain but not of the nasty corn in other macros. Taste was best described as basic. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability is high due to the smoothness and tight carbonation. A good go-to for picnics and barbecues."
"This is one of my favorite lighter beers during the summer. I always get some when I travel east. Something I would recommend."
"D - This is okay. I tried it back to back with Stegmaier Amber Lager and would have to give the edge to Stegmaier."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a rich amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very malty, slightly sweet. Taste is of malts, a bit sweet and lightly hopped, pretty tasty. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"BUT.... I don't get it... I have never been a huge fan of this beer... I guess that I am happy that my BMC friends drink this now... just cause their money is going a small brewery and not one of those Micro-eating conglomerates!"
"It is very drinkable and tastes good on a hot day."
"d- one of the best beers in this price range. very clean very crisp but not overly watered down and light body leave me thinking that i have found my new fall back beer. this beer i could drink everyday (and will!)"
"Had this at the Philly airport. Poured a nice copper color with thin white head that dissipated quickly. Smelled of malt with a hint of hops. Tasted similar with caramel tones. Had a very smooth feel, finished clean. Overall, quite a drinkable, sessionable beer."
"A nice lager with decent flavor. Much better than many macros. I love drinking this beer when i have the chance. The ultimate session beer, a legend."
"Taste wise it doesn't really follow through either: it's refreshing but there's something not quite right (adjuncts ?) about it. The balance between hops and malt is more on the malty side but it is very drinkable having said all that."
"d- very drinkable, goes down easy, not too carbonated, nice local offering."
"Pours an amber color without any head but plenty of film and lacing. Smells of pungent thin hollow malt and hops, but crisp and clean nonetheless. There is nothing impressive about the smell, but there is absolutely no fault in it. I am a big ale drinker, and I have no idea why lagers have such a mass appeal when ales get hardly any credit, but I digress. The taste is thin, a tiny hint of malt and another tiny hint of hops. Mouthfeel is fine its just very thin and lacks any body but then again it is a lager. Drinkability is exceptional because there is no real fault in this beer.... clean, crisp, just enough taste to keep me going. Not a bad beer."
"Yuengling has always been one of the more popular offerings at my campfires and for good reason."
"D-Easy enough to drink I would say a very good lawn mowing or outdoor summer beer."
"Taste is more palatable than aroma. Some balancing bitter hops, some not too vegetable-y, bready malt to it, but basically it's a fairly standard lager. A cut above the normal swill, and satisfying enough, but nothing memorable. I'd certainly over it above quite a few commonly available brews, but not ahead of just about any decent micro I can think of. Mouthfeel is actually pretty decent."
"Drinkability: Great macrobrew. Easily drinkable with good balance. Old standby."
"Drinkability- Pretty great for a lager. If only this were available in Ohio..."
"Overall - It's nothing spectacular at all, but it's still perfectly drinkable. Sometimes I just want something simple to recover from all the other heavy hefes and stouts I drink any other day."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is easy on the buds, with good overall drinkablity.."
"Best of the American lawn mower beers! Keep these in the beer fridge in the garage and hit them on hot days."
"Perfect mouthfeel for a lager, surprised to see this as an amber. I doubt I would seek this out again. Really seems to be BMC in disguise. I like a good craft lager but this is too close to macro for me."
"this brew pours up a golden amber color with a small white head. the nose is dry and pale malty. the taste is pretty basic. pale malts and dry with low hops. the brew is not too dry though. medium to light bodied, subtle carbo. Pretty easy drinkin. Its not about the money!"
"Clean mouthfeel and awesome drinkability make this just another micro that is really a Macro!."
"Crisp easy drinking mellow lager great for a hot afternoon or a drinking session."
"Mouthfeel is very well done. Crisp, efficient, light. Supremely refreshing here, and certainly drinkable."
"D- An easy going brew that tastes pretty good and is really affordable. Highly drinkable and sessionable. My new go-to for session beers."
"M/D: a rather light and soft beer and easy to drink brew probably why it is so popular."
"D - Great to have as a regular or just sessions. I could have a few of these without becoming overwhelmed with the taste. Definitely recommended."
"This beer was born out of the American spirit of drinking, we took what the Germans knew about beer and made it better. It may have not won any awards but this beer is great. In fact this is my favorite beer, most German beers give off a bitter taste. The taste of this beer reminds me of marijuana, and that's not a bad thing."
"Bottom line, I've never met anyone that didn't think Yuengling was at least decent. It's an old standby."
"Pours from the 32oz. bottle an attractive copper color with a foamy one-finger head that quickly disappeared into a modest collar. Surprisingly little carbonation...hardly any bubbles. The aroma is light & subded...a trace of malt & no detectable hops. Taste is sweet and malty, with a hint of caramel & toast. The mouthfeel is that of your average macro lager. High marks for drinkability...it goes down light, crisp & smooth. Overall, a cut above the standard macro lager, but not quite craft worthy."
"Had this on tap at Blarney's in Philly for $1. Never reviewed it before so seems like the time. Poured a golden, same color of wheat with a thick white head. Good retention on the head. Smell was grainy with light hops. Taste was similar, not too complex, not as light as I was expecting, with some real flavor and a nice hop balance in the finish. Good session beer."
"Overall, it's a nice beer for the price. If I'm at a bar with a limited selection, I'll usually go for a Yuengling as it's a solid beer that seems to taste well no matter where I have it."
"Where I live I get a case for around $18, can't beat that."
"Overall, this is a pretty good brew to make a regular and as sessionable as it gets."
"Drinkability: This is a reasonably drinkable and refreshing beer. With its low ABV it would be fine for an afternoon BBQ or an evening on the beach.. Its price won't break the bank if you want to fill a cooler for a party."
"Drinkability- highly drinkable enjoyable session beer, amazing choice for the summertime and a hot nite, you drink them and never ever have a problem having hard time for another time for another, so much better then your average american macro lager, and when you throw in just how good the price is this is a must buy for any average man, i spent 13.99 for 24 pack!!! a classic for me now and i look forward to this summer of enjoying my new find"
"The saving grace of the beer is that it's a tasty little session beer that won't drain your pocket. Although you shouldn't expect greatness, this beer is much more flavorful than the standard industrial beers and may cost less."
"I can, and have, drank a bunch of these in a row. With an ABV that low, it's a great session beer."
"D - Very drinkable and often the best option in the many craft-desert bars in FL. The malt character is light, but much more robust than its competition and makes for a very sessionable beer."
"High drinkability, this is cheap and better than other American macros."
"Pours a clear amber color with not much of a head or lacing. Smell is generally corn and grains with. Taste is relatively similar in that there is some corn and grain characteristics with a slight malt backbone. Little bit low on taste but not too bad. Moderate carbonation. Good drinkability. Overall, not a bad beer. Just not the best."
"Considering, this is not a bad brew. A little light on flavor but drinkable and enjoyable. In a pinch, this will more than do."
"Very clean body, very refreshing. I can see why this is considered a classic."
"12 ounce bottle, one of my friends from work was nice enough to get me a case of this on a recent trip to PA. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber/copper color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like sweet malt, grain, and some bread. No offensive aromas at all, it's a nice smelling traditional American lager aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's sweet and malty. It tastes like sweet malt, bread/grain, and a little bit of caramel. Mouthfeel/body is light, with good carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's pretty easy to drink and quite sessionable. I admit that I haven't had this in a couple years, but it's as good as I remember. It's a good, solid lager. If it was available in Ohio I'd pick it up quite a bit. For the style it's a pretty good beer, much better than the typical BMC American lagers."
"D: I'm torn in a couple of different directions here. As an amber lager, it's unabashedly a macro - corny, slightly metallic, and sweet. However, as a cheap, no-frills macro, this is at or near the head of the pack. Quite quaffable and enjoyable for what it is."
"12 ounce can poured into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a slightly hazed amber color with about an inch of creamy light ecru colored foam. Smells and tastes of bready, biscuity malts, grassy hops, sweet corn. Medium in both body and carbonation. It is what it is, a super easy to drink, accessible, quenching amber lager."
"D - This beer is easy sipping. Not too heavy nor too light on flavor. A straightforward brew without any complexity. The best ""macro"" I've had by far."
"D= Very high. Glad I got to try this beer. very basic but it does it right. I could drink a million."
"Goes down smooth."
"D: This is pretty much my beer of last resort, meaning that it's as low as I'll go as far as beers I'll willingly pay for. It's not going out of your way for by any means, but if you're in a typical bar on the Eastern Seaboard, you can do a lot worse."
"A nice, cheap beer for your out-of-town friends to enjoy."
"Of all of the macros, the big Y never fails to please, and on a hot summer day, at 4.4 AVB, you can drink these like water."
"D-Compliments and doesn't overpower the food your eating it with."
"I think if this were available I would probably pick some up for a hot day BBQ. I am glad to see that this lager has a body to it. Thanks to TIA for grabbing this."
"A great american beer. the oldest brewery in America and it's safe to say it's safe to say a really great beer for it's traditional lager. Has a really good mouthfeel, not abrasive at all. Feels good going down and it highly drinkable. One of the better lagers I've had."
"The drinkability is good, due to the lack of offensive (or any) flavors, this beer goes down pretty smoothly."
"The pour was a surprising amber. I think I expected a pale yellow so I was quite happy with the tone as well as the foamy, beige head. The smell has elements of vague hops and bread. Medium mouthfeel. The taste has some distant hops and a little grainy and sweet. It is a pretty decent beer and I wish it was available in my state."
"D - This is the highest part of this. Definately co9uld have a few of these and have in the past"
"D: You will wonder where it has all gone off to."
"Overall, a step up from the macro-alternative. Widely available in PA on tap and in bottles. It is nice to know there is a safety net walking into an unknown bar. If no other crafts are around, Yuengling always serves as the security blanket. However, in a good beer bar, Yuengling is always the bride's maid, never the bride..."
"Before expanding my palate Yuengling used to be my favorite beer. I gre up in the DC area so we had plenty of it around. I still consider this a great beer for a night full of drinking, but not one that I would drink because I want to enjoy a beer. I still love you yuengling and I can't wait to have you again...stupid yuengling doesn't ship to CA. : ("
"Mouthfeel: Light carbonation. A very, very easy-drinking beer. One of my personal favorites, it holds a special place in my heart, although not an out-of-this-world brew... there'll always be a spot in my fridge for a Lager."
"Notes: I don't really ever see myself drinking one of these beers again unless it is free or it is the only beer around and I'm at a party. I say this because this beer just doesn't really do anything for me. It doesn't refresh like a good wheat beer or Belgian does and it doesn't have the flavor that a good stout does. A disappointment."
"Pours a clear light orange/amber, almost golden, thin white head forms, drops to a thin ring, no real lacing on the glass, looks average. Smell is nice, toasty malt, light caramel, lightly fruity like apricot, biscuits, nicely malty, some light hoppiness. Taste is similar, toasty malt, some caramel, light fruit, grains, very full flavoured, lightly bitter in the finish but well balanced. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very easy drinking. Solid lager, I'd drink this watching the game if I had access to it."
"Yuengling is a great beer for the price. It has a solid taste, and is great served cold. I enjoyed it from the 12 oz can but prefer it after pouring it into a tall glass. My favorite quality of this beer is its excellent taste and drinkability balance. This is a beer I will buy again."
"Good solid drinkablity, I have filled lots of recycle bins with bottles of Lager. Very good solid beer. Nothing incredible, but to me lagers arent my favorite. But if you are going to have a lager this is a great representative."
"drinkability: very easy but horrible dirty aftertaste. beer than a bud but not better than much other."
"D= The fact that this was not as good from a green bottle as it was from a tap was no shocker. Still, this is a great tasting, cheap, no frills beer that I could see myself drinking a hell of a lot of were it available in my part of the country."
"Overall: You can see yourself driking a lot of these and I have, A simple cheap beer that is a thousand times better then the price suggests, why drink a big 3 again? Drink, enjoy, repeat!"
" ~ I've had one at every establishment I've ventured into here in Fort Myer's Beach. I look forward to more."
" This beer is very good for the price. Miller lite was the same price for a 12 pack which was $9.99. Why buy a cheap crud beer like Miller lite for 9.99 when Yuengling is a few steps above."
"Pours a copper color with a short white head. No lacing. The smell is not much--yeast & some sourness. Taste is grainy, some sweet malts, earthy, sour yeast. Mouthfeel is crisp. This is a fairly drinkable lager. It's a much better option than the adjuct lager macros."
"Overall this is a solid beer that is what it is. No one is going to call you out for drinking Yuengling, but it's not what you'd bring out to impress anyone either."
"Yuengling is a good beer for what it is. It is not my first choice, but I do not turn it down. It brings back good memories of college where my friends and I would drive from WV to PA to pick up a case or two."
"D: Much, much better than the American lagers put out by BMC, and a nice beer to sit back with if you're going to have more than a few, or simply want to sit back lazily with something comfortable."
"D - Effortless to drink. Great balance for a session beer, and would be perfect with a meal."
"I have five more of these gems. Raymond, you have betrayed me."
"After much anticipation to try a Yuengling, I found it to be average at best. Maybe it'll grow on me. Purchased six pack for $6.79 at BP on Wilma Rudolph Blvd in Clarksville, TN where the beer selection was quite good for a gas mart with New Belgium Fat Fire, Michelob DunkelWeisse and Hoegaarden among the Macros in the cooler. There was even Yuengling's Black & Tan (maybe I'll try that next). Pour into my Sam Adams Sensory Glass created a nice foamy head and thousands of tiny beer bubbles in my glass. Smell was not distinguishable (really, just couldn't get a read on this beer by smell), though I found the beer to have a clean, crisp taste. Mouthful was decent and low ABV makes the drinkability better than average. Still, the jury might be out on this American made brew. I think I'll have another."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- After a brief sizzle on the tongue, the texture thins out completely and goes down like water. This not only diminishes the overall enjoyment of the sip, but it further brings out the less-than average components of the beer itself. Aside from slugging a real cold one from the bottle on a hot summer day, I'd suggest passing on this one completely. I had better expectations for it."
"If you've got the opportunity to try a traditional lager, I highly recommend you do so!"
"It looks a nice dark amber color and I have gotten different results with the foam when pouring it differently but when done right it seems to stay nicely. There is a strong hoppy-ness to me. Feels good when drinking, when I first had this a few years ago and I saw how cheap it was here I thought it would be another cheap beer but not grainy-ness at all; smooth."
"FYI: buy this beer in a can over a bottle..."
"Notes: first taste of this brewery. yuengling is not available in michigan and yet many people ask if we carry it. i dont get the hype. there are plenty of subs. i guess its just a cult thing where someone will get to brag to his friends for a week that he brought a case back from some other state, like hes bootlegging yuenglings or something."
"At 4.40 ABV, of course, extremely drinkable. I could slump over a scarred up old bar & drink these all night. Doggone decent beer for $2.95 a pour!"
"Drinkability: Very basic and simple; cheap cheap cheap; better choice than bud or coors at a bar"
"D - I've had this beer a couple of times now, and I can say now that I see why it is a cult beer. It's not really that good, but better than the BMC's, around the same price, and has local appeal. That being said, it's just not a very impressive beer. It does do some things right (I love how some ambers pick up anise notes), but does so many things wrong (body, finish, lack of flavor...) Honestly, I'd rather have the new Schlitz (surprisingly good beer...)"
"Drinkability is exceptional, the very textbook definition of a session beer for me. They fix that smell and this could stand up above it's regional macro reputation."
"Just to toss in my two cents on this one, this has become my new 'cheap' beer, I do like it and the price is good and available pretty much everywhere in the south (originally from Michigan where it didn't exist). Pretty standard, middle of the road lager, easy to drink, easy on the wallet, not a bad choice when you don't want to spend a fortune on beer, but want to at least be a step above some of the more traditional big breweries."
"D - A good fallback beer. I bring this as a postgame beer for hockey nights. It's better than the Molson that others show up with."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a light amber with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is a bit metallic and grassy. The flavor is sweet with little hoppy bitterness. The finish is crisp and clean. A light bodied beer that is made for quaffing. A long time favorite and a great session beer."
"excellent drinkability. i see yuengling as a very versatile beer. its always a pleasant surprise to find this beer at a party as opposed to usual macros like bud and miller. being from pa too, yuengling often brings a sense of pride and i love seeing it when i go other places. however, as my palate has expanded, i must say it doesnt hold a candle to many of the greater beers i have experienced. nonetheless, yuengling will always be one of favorites and reliable."
"FYI - Living in Southeastern PA, If you ask for 'Lager' at any local bar, this is what they give you."
"I heard a lot of rave reviews about this beer, but simply put I was very disappointed. The beer looks good out of the bottle with a nice amber glow and a good foamy head but thats were the good ends. IMO the beer just lacks any real flavor and tastes very watered down."
"Clean and refreshing is what you are gonna get with this beer. An excellent thirst quencher. One of my go to beers when I am looking for something light. A great session beer that doesn't get offensive with a lot of foods. The taste is on the sweeter side and the hop flavor is subdued. I prefer it on draft, but it is decent from the bottle too."
"Overall, I've never been fond of Yuenling Lager. The porter is okay, and to a lesser extent the black and tan, but the lager is something I really have to choke down."
"You basically get what you pay for with this beer. I would say that it's far better than Budweiser, Miller, Coors, etc."
"This beer pours a vey clear amber with a light white head. The snell is feint but you get some malt in the nose. The taste is nice and smooth, not overpowering by any means, no bad aftertastes like other lagers and a slight hop flavor. The mouthfeel seems nice and the carbonation level may be a little low. A highly drinkable brew with no bad aftertaste."
"D - Nothing beats slugging a few of these after some hard work outside on a hot summer day. Otherwise, one or 2 is plenty."
"Again, if you want to rid yourself of the BMC fare, Yuengling is really for you."
"UPDATE - This one has grown on me in some respects. Still nothing great here, but compared to your other common macro brews, this one is a step ahead. It has become my go to beer when I'm on a budget and the bar special is something like dollar domestics."
"Easy to drink more than one, although I'm rarely in the mood for this style of lager. Clearly better than BMC."
"D - Compared to those other ""beers"" this is the one that I'm always coming back to...sure glad I'm from PA"
"Overall, a pretty good beer to kick back with if you aren't looking to spend much and just want a basic lager. It fits the mold of the the American macros but it's a step above the others like Coors, Bud and Miller. If you're drinking American macro lager, drink this instead."
"Ok, as an Eastern Pennsylvanian I am biased in favor of this beer, but it has a great amber color, excellent drink ability and the flavor is home to me. It is simply the best utility beer on the market. Sure, it won't win many contests, but I love it."
"Crisp, refreshing, light-medium in body, well-carbonated, and highly drinkable. A good alternative to BMC if cans are your thing."
"There are much worse beers out there and this is actually fairly drinkable."
"D - Very light beer. The power of Yuengling is that it is easy drinking and can be used when you want to stretch out the session with minimal impact."
"D- holy hell yea"
"6/4/6/3/12 (3.1/5)"
"Pours a beautiful amber color with a white heading. Smells of caramel mostly and very dank hops. Excellent carbonation and almost no lacing. Goes down very smoothly and isn't too gassy. To me the best american lager I've tasted and really does own the name Lager. Another thing if you can try this on tap it just seems to be much different in a keg rather than bottled."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby for a micro. Would try again when out east and the only choices are macros."
"Good for a ""chilling time"" beer or a party standard. Of course, I'd rather have a Samuel Smith Taddy Porter or a Nut Brown instead as a ""chilling"" beer..."
"Pours a nice amber in the glass. Little head that disappears quickly. No lace. Good carbonation and a tad more hops than you'd expect from an American lager at this price. Has a nice ""bite"". At about a buck more a six pack than the big three corn and rice brewers , it's well worth looking for. Actually, it's now in a lot of supermarkets."
"Appearance: A golden yellow with amber tinting. The nose is sweet malt a hint of yeast and hops. The taste is slightly malty with a good balance of hops and notes of yeast. The finish is clean and quick with a simple mouthfeel. A good beer to drink while watching the game."
"D- a low abv and a nice mouthfeel makes yuengling very drinkable. i could put back quite a few of these at a bar or gathering with ease but the taste gets old after a few. a great summertime beer with some BBQ and friends. A great choice if you need to bring a case to a party because everybody seems to recognize and love it."
" drinkability: way to good in this catagory once you drink one it easly turns into a half of case or more"
"Yet another beer that I have to rate off the tap to get by the stinky green bottle. Nasty..."
"Notes from Aug/2008.Pours a light brown with a small white head that dissipates rapidly. Aromas of caramel malt, faint hops, and apple cider. Taste is like caramel apple cider- not sure how to better describe it. Somewhat buttery mouthfeel. Hops are in wanting. Good clean and sweet finish. My pick out of the macro American lagers."
"Pours a nice dark golden brown, a resemblance of a much more expensive beer. Aroma is very malty with little hops and a slight sweetness. The head is decent/average but not much lacing on the glass. Tastes of your average lager with a subtle sweetness at the end, very refreshing if you ask me. Extremely drinkable....especially for the price (about $9 for a 12 pack where I live). My choice for a ""quantity above quality"" beer."
"D: Very drinkable. For an fairly light American lager with some flavor; a solid choice."
"The best part about this beer is its drinkability. It is not too complex, but it is good with a barbeque and easy to drink."
"The best macro lager! For the price you cant beat it. It has more flavor and body than the other macros. Because of the price and its quality I give it a high rating."
"Note: fresh in bottle, its better. Quite malty and balanced well. A very sessionable beer. - 2.21.14"
"Typical American macro lager, with a tiny bit more taste, color, and aroma than the big boys. Pours dark golden with a head that fades immediately. The smell is light and tangy with lager yeast and smells of adjuncts. Extremely light and even a bit washed-out tasting Slightlt sweet and corny. Smooth enough and about as easy to drink as water- with the same interest level."
"A pretty decent beer, especially for the price and in comparison to the BMC competition. Great session beer or party beer when you still want to taste something good."
"I've had this a good amount, so I won't go out of my way to buy it, but it's an American classic."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's not a super impressive beer, but it is certainly sessionable and not as offensive as the big 3 IMO."
"Drinkability - While the flavor isn't the best, it's far from overwhelming in either direction. Plus, the beer is pretty refreshing. I think this is where Yuengling really shines. Would I want to drink this every day? No. But it's fine for what it is -- a decent alternative to one of the big three."
"D - a great beer for washing the car, cutting grass, etc. very light and tasty, better than the other stuff on the market (Bud, Coors, and Miller) for the price, BUT beware, do not pour into a glass! I don't know what chemistry affects the beer from the bottle to the glass, but it spoils the beer. I would drink it from the bottle, but I haven't had it on tap."
"Poured a 1"" head of white foam that quickly broke down to a thin layer. Appearance was a light brown/red color, and clear. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, and crisp with carbonation. I've really enjoyed the Amber/Red microbrews that I tried, and Yuengling is not as deeply flavorful as those. Overall this is a very drinkable beer."
"(bottle - 12 oz) Pours a deep golden brown with very few bubbles and not a lot of head. Looks like a beer and not apple juice like many other lagers. Very faint malty aroma with an even fainter hint of fruit. Smooth tasting with little aftertaste. Not very bitter, definitely tastes like a beer. Nice smooth finish. On the whole, one of the best beers I've ever had. Not too overpowering in taste, aroma or carbonation. Makes for smooth drinking. Doubly good for coming out of a green bottle. Most other green bottled beers are very iffy, but not this one."
"This is a great session lager. It's cheap and it tastes good. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A fine, balanced, sessionable lager that fares better than most macro lagers available, like a basic lager deluxe."
"A nice change of pace in my travels away from New England as they do not distribute up here."
"$4-5 a case more then the cans, that's a box of Apple Jacks right there!"
"I drink this beer regularly when I go out and watch the UFC pay per view events. It's about the only non BMC brew offered on tap. It's easy to drink and a pretty good thirst quencher. Goes well with the honey mustard wings."
"I was very happy to find this beer at the Orlando Airport while waiting for my plane. Review from notes: Unfortunately, the happiness didn't last long as I took my first sniff. Pours a light amber color with a small, off-white head and no lacing in the pint glass. Aroma of skunk and some sweet caramel malts. Taste was pretty much the same. Some skunkiness, some toasty malts and a bit of caramel, slightly sweet and a dry crisp finish. I could see this beer being pretty good if it were super fresh, but the green bottles might have done this one in quicker than normal. Watery and light-bodied. Honestly, I don't know what the fuss is all about and can't see why East Coast folks wish it were around here when they can get much better brews from America's second oldest brewery here in the Midwest. August Schell's reigns supreme in that contest."
"I would definitely take Yuengling's own Lord Chesterfiedl over this anyway, as I find it both more easily drinkable and also more flavourful and interesting."
"Delighted that Georgia has been added to Yuengling area of distribution."
"Always been a fan of Yuengling and will continue to be. I cant rate it as good as most micorbrews that i have had but this is the eiptomy for BMC drinkers."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer finishes dry and is a bit to light on the palate for my liking, too watery. The beer is light in body and is an easy drinker, but why would you want to pay for this? Well probably because you're one of the millions of people that are tired of BMC and are looking for a ""better beer."" This beer is just as flavorless as Bud, except for the fact that its a different color. Sure there's more flavor than in bud, but I don't think that you could possibly brew anything in this style that had less flavor. If you're looking to step up from bud to a beer that has a bit more flavor but is still flavorless then this is for you. Bud drinkers like this because it makes them feel ""high class."" They're drinking something that actually has color (albeit only a few shades darker than bud itself) and has a slightly different but equally bland taste as Bud. Fucking rediculous..."
"Oh, I've heard about this, so Let's give it a try. Golden brown color body, very bubbly. No head. Lagery, malty aroma, and nutiness. Somewhat nutty, refreshing. Not too shabby, now I can see what the talk is about."
"D: Great. I want more! An easy drinker that is a great session beer."
"A nice offering from the oldest continuously operating brewery in the United States, and one that's family-run to boot."
"not a bad beer, nothing great though, pretty cheap....easy to find beer in the DC area"
"I find this to be very drinkable."
"this is a very drinkable beer. I am by no means a huge lager fan, but this is one of the better examples of the style!"
"The taste is quite watery, tastes much like the smell, weak, but very drinkable."
"Probably the best beer for the money in my opinion, $6 or less will usually get me a six pack. Great pour, rich full bodied flavor, a bit of an after taste and malty flavor that I'm not too fond of, but for the price it is by far the best beer out there."
"Drinkability- One of the best macros in america. No doubt."
"D- Good drinkability, the light version has better drinkability (obviously)."
"This pours a light amber color. Nothing special in the appearance. The head does not last long. The taste is ok but does have a slight cold medicine taste to it. But compared to other Macro beers out there that cost the same this at least has taste. This is a nothing special beer that is affordable. I would drink it again but only as an alternative to other Macros."
"What a great value. More body than most in it's class. Unfortunately they don't sell it in Ohio so it's only on rare occasion that i get to have this treat. Nice darker color but this beer, as great as it is, is focused more on taste than looks. I keep this one in the can/bottle but enjoy every last drop."
"I just bought a 24 pack of this for $18 at the distributer just down the road, and I have to say I am happy with it! The price is a little high, but after living in Maine where beer is cheaper I will get over it. The appearance is normal for a traditional lager. The smell is the only weakness for this beer, I suppose it is due to the can... the taste is surprisingly good! I always used to think Yuengling was strong, but this was pleasant with out a ton of carbonation. I recommend trying this to others, however I am still trying to find MY beer, and so far nothing has beaten Molson Canadian, so I will keep searching!"
"Easy drinking, good for what it is, better than most macros, but not very worth seeking out unless only BMC is around."
"Pours a perfectly clear light amber-copper color with about a half finger of off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is fairly clean, some soft grain, a tad earthy and mere hints of sulfur. Taste is pretty good. There is a subdued malty sweetness, a solid though not overwhelming bitterness, some very light hoppiness, and an omnipresent mineral, every so slightly metallic, flavor. Good mouthfeel, light-medium body, with tingly carbonation. Drinkability is good. This is a fairly simple and straight-forward amber lager but its unpretentious, quaffable and enjoyable."
"Notes: I would not go out of my way for this but it is a fine brew."
"This isn't usually available in my area but my uncle brought some u for a party. Nothing too special about it but I would rather have this over any of the other big beer companies offerings. Good taste all the way though with a nice body and mouthfeel. Would like to try this again, although a tad low in ABV though."
"D: Very drinkable and beats the big boys in that price point but still nothing to get too excited about"
"I enjoy this beer anytime I can. These go down like Water after a workout. MUCH better than any other macro lager. Enjoy!"
"If it's available where you are, it's a surefire bet to bring to a party, or to work through during a weekend. Choose it over BMC. You won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Due to its crisp mouth feel, and the fact that its on the lighter side, I'd say this is its best feature. I can probably go through a 6-pack of these if I wanted to."
" As others have said, if I lived on the east coast I can't see ever picking up any BMC when this is on the shelf next to it. Pleasure to get to try this."
"D: This a good cheap beer that's readily available anywhere that sells beer in Pennsylvania. This the staple of my weekends and I don't know why people would consider the big macro-lagers when this sits right next to them."
"This was a decent brew. I didn't have high expectations for it and was honestly a little surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Given the choice between this and the typical American macro brews, I'd take this one first any day."
"I had several of these last night without noticing much difference, but tonight I am having another to compare against my frequent visits with Yuengling in both the bottle and on tap. Hands down, the canned version is the best. It doesn't suffer the lack of carbonation from the tap lines, and I suppose the other differences deal with this version not being light stuck at all. It's much creamier, sweeter, and devoid of the sometimes-pleasant-but-sometimes-annoying earthy character that has defined Yuengling (for me) for so long."
"D: Its a decent drinkable lager for a session style of beer. Low ABV and light body make it a good beer for an all day binge in the summertime."
"Overall: Not a bad mass produced beer. A fall back is somewhere you are has nothing else."
"Pours a clear amber with an ample amount of carbonation. The white head doesn't linger for very long. Some oxidation in the aroma. Smells like wet cardboard. Medium in body with a seltzer-like carbonation. Taste seems a little off... it has a malty seltzer quality to it. Cardboard that I detected in the nose returns and there's a slight buttery note toward the back. Perhaps, I got a bad bottle of this?"
"It was was either Yuengling or Coors Light at the restaurant last night so I opted for the Yuengling, I've had it before in bottles and liked it. This was WAY different...the color seemed right, the carbonation seeemed a little overdone but something happened to the taste. The first sip had nothing to it, very bland so I took a whiff and ""Whoa?!? My beer has no smell!!"" Very little hops smell, no malt or anything else. I don't know if the restaurant (Speers Street Grill in Speers PA)had a problem with their draft equipment but this was ridiculous, my water and lemon had more flavor."
"Finally tried this a few times while in Pittsburgh. Caramel-brown in appearance. Semi-sweet caramel smell and taste with a lot more flavor than most of the mass-produced beers on tap alongside it at the bar I was at. Not strong at all and drinkable enough."
"D - better than average tasting beer at a good price, great for gatherings of 4 or more people where a constant rate of intake would be common."
"D-4.0 A solid lager indeed for a old time macro, has body and malt, but somewhat watery as compared to most microbrews."
"Could drink this all day, the fall back beer, usually can be got on domestic prices round here, so that's pretty cool."
"Has a macro-esque high carbonation feel to it. Does have some discernable hop presence in the flavor, this combines with bready malts to create something resembling balance. All in all, not too shabby. I can see why they sell alot of this in Florida's tropical climate. Fairly refreshing and has more flavor than most of the BMC offerings."
"This is definitely a beer that you could drink a lot of if you don't care much for taste. It goes down easily and isn't reprehensible. It's a party beer that's better than Bud Light."
" although thick it tastes good and goes down smooth and clean, definitely could session on the porch on a hot summer day."
"Overall I would consider this a very good macro brew. I bought it because it was the only thing available at a gas station that was still open, but it could have been much worse."
"This a subpar beer at best. I won't seek it out again."
"Cheap, tasty, and low ABV = fantastic session beer."
"This has started to become my inexpensive go to beer and I've been drinking it quite a bit lately. This has got to be one of the best beers for the price. It's not going to overpower with flavor or anything but it's solid. Sweet with some caramel malt some earthy hops, some grain notes and sure yeah, a little watery thin. There's a lot more flavor than your standard swill Lager though, that's for sure."
"Overall, a pretty good lager that I would take over a macro any day."
"Drinkability - Good drinkability due to its light character. Goes down like water."
"Not offensive, not exceptional, very drinkable. I think light and heavy beer drinkers can respect this beer."
"Nice cheap lager that has never disappointed me."
"HV"
"D: High, with its price and light body, this makes for an idea session beer for us college folk"
"Pours a burnt amber color into a pint glass. Thicker head than I expected, but dissipates quickly leaving a bit of lacing. Strong aroma of yeast and malt, a hint of lemon, lemon drops. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation and a light body. Taste is yeasty and sweet, lemon? Finishes with a little sourness. Overall this beer has an unobtrusive, pleasant flavor, and the price is right. Fortunately, one doesn't have to sacrifice too much flavor for the low price."
"Its a simple and unassuming beer--not trying to be anything it isn't."
"Pours a very light amber color with just a bit of (rapidly diminishing) head and no real lacing to speak of. Nice scent, hints of malt and a little sourness, but nothing really strong or really great. Good taste, it's refreshing and clean, but there's not a lot there to stimulate the taste buds; mostly just a little hoppier than usual lager with some maltiness and a little sour aftertaste. Goes down fine, but nothing great there, either. A very average beer, but it isn't expensive and can be easy to find in many states, so that's a plus."
"This is by far not my favorite beer. However, with that said let us continue. The color of a lager as they are known in these parts is quite nice. Rich amber color with a decent head. There isn't much of a smell to it as I see. When you take your first sip you find yourself in a traditional American lager. Nothing special but I just find myself liking it. I will take it over an American macro any day. It goes down easy so many restaurants in the area promote Yuengs and wings. I think also it has an appeal because it is a local brew for me. Nevertheless, give this one a try."
"A must."
"I was a bit taken off guard to see some bottles of these sitting on the singles rack at Winchester Wine and Spirits. As far as I knew, Yuengling didn't distribute to this state. Oh well, I guess they did in this case. Pours clear orange, with a bit of white heading, and a good looking dosage of carbonation. Aroma is very clean, with some roasted grain, pizza dough, hints of caramel. Taste is slightly more bitter, with a roasted edge that makes the carbonation seem all the more apparent. Body is light and crisp on the palate, with just enough hop bitterness to keep it interesting. This would make an ideal session lager for a warm day. My first brew from Yuengling did not disappoint."
"D. I gave this a high drinkability due to the price, ABV and all around decentness of this beer. An excellent macro lager, possibly the best."
"D : It's not the best beer out there but it's not bad. Real easy to session and is great on a hot day with some good New York style pizza."
"Light-bodied mouthfeel with a fairly good level of drinkability..."
"Also, I would reccommend to buy Yuengling in either cans or 12/24 packs; the green bottles tend to be skunked by the time you get them home in the sixers."
"Lots of flavor for a traditional old school American lager."
"D: Quite drinkable, particularly on hot lazy summer afternoons (like this one). This is not a complex beer, but one that will quench the thirst. Low enough ABV to have several over the course of the afternoon and not get too tipsy."
"I'm not really a fan of American Lagers but if I have to choose one this is the one I go with. To me it seems much more complex than the traditional American lager. It has some body and color and it doesn't taste half bad either. I usually end up drinking a few after a softball game and the taste never grows old. You can always be sure that you'll get a decent tasting beer. Yeungling claims to be America's oldest brewery, I'd love to go on a brewery tour one of these days, now if I can only convince my wife;-)"
"Recently found it being used in a Black n Tan in a bar outside of Pittsburgh, it adds a little change to the Traditional Harp or Bass tans."
"(G&M)"
"Nice summer time beer. Good session ale. Also may be a good alternative when you can't find something better or a good cross-over beer."
"Definitely a no-frills lager. This would make for a great session brew, but you'll likely find something a little more interesting to gravitate towards."
"I can't believe it has been so long that I've been on this site yet never reviewed Yuengling. Being back with a Pittsburgher who had some made me nostalgic and I finally got down to it. Poured a auburnish brown with a two-finger head that died slowly. A faint hop smell with some graininess to it. A good drying taste from the hops and a smooth body complement this refreshing medium-bodied beer that also contains some citric and earth notes. Form wise not that great of a beer, but it will always be one of my favorites by itself or with a Primanti Bros. sandwich."
"I first tried this beer on a trip to South Carolina. Apparently it is very difficult to get any sort of a selection down there. It was pretty much Miller, Bud, or Yuengling. I went with the Yuengling, not to be dissapointed. It was way better than the other options. I surprisingly drank quite a bit of this stuff over a 4 day period. Good fun no beer poops."
"D: Average drinkability, could drink this in a pinch but wont woo or wow me during. Does taste better deeper into the drink but still is a little rough around the edges mouthful and enjoyment wise."
"D - A very drinkable beer. Wish I could get it in Texas."
"pours a fairly dark amber with a thin head that fades quickly. there's a light malt aroma rounded out with the typical lager scent. the bottom feeders continue to show there stuff in the taste, but the hops do become noticeable in the finish. with the malty finish the high carbonation helps out again. definitely a good beer to grab when the tap selection is limited."
"""Beer Its Not Just A Beverage Its Food"""
"But this is a great tasting lager, do not be afraid to try it because you won't regret it."
"This is one I've enjoyed quite a few times on a hot day. One of the greatest attributes is the price. Around here(southern virginia) it usually costs the same as bud(which i won't even compare). There's no flash in the taste, or appearance, or smell for all that it matters. However; if you're looking for a good thirst quincher during those hot summer days in the mid-atlantic, and you don't have stacks of money, this is your best bet."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Val-Dieu goblet. This beer pours a amber red with a very small amount of head. After a few sips I found that this beer leaves absolutely no lacing. The aroma is green bottle funk up front with just a bit of cereal grain aroma. The taste once again has the green bottle funk going on. Biscuity flavors come out next with just a mellow sweetness that finishes on the tongue. The mouthfeel is thin, with just a slight dryness. A roommate brought me back a sixer of this a couple years before I got into great beer and I remember loving it. It's a bit disappointing that now I just find it ok. I would drink it if someone gave it to me or if I was in a bar with nothing better."
"D: It's very easy to put down because the flavor isn't offensive and the body is so light and watery. Still, the smell is so off-putting that I found it quite difficult to actually take that first sip. Once I did get that first gulp down, however, things improved a little bit. Yuengling Lager would be a good choice for an inexpensive, sessionable beer for camping or a sporting event."
"Drinkability: A nice, refreshing session and/or lawnmower beer."
"Tried a can of this after hearing so much about it. Decanted into a pint glass. Pours a clear yellow-orange. Thin white head that mostly dissipates into a thin ring. Smells and tastes pretty simple - mostly a light, malty flavor. Not overly sweet, but not much dynamic hops to it. Smooth mouthfeel. Better when it's a little cold. Overall, it's super drinkable. A step up from bland American macros - it has some decent character and is pretty refreshing. I would gladly pick up one of these at a summer party."
"Drinkability is good."
"D- Pretty easy to drink."
"Decent feel to this amber lager, carbonation is nice and there is some body to it. I could hit this beer all day long and not get tired of it. I would recommend it to anyone as a step up from the BMC offerings."
"Overall its not anywhere close to a good micro craft brew but it way better than you average macro and is certainly far from flavorless."
"Yuengling certainly has its place. I wouldn't bother to buy it for myself unless there were few options available, but its availability means that this is a common scenario. Overall, not a bad option, just not a great one either."
"Yuengling lager is a no frills lager thats great as a session beer."
"D: Session beer all the way."
"T/M/D: Soft and smooth... a slightly sweet malt profile, with a little dash of hops. Pretty straight forward, but that's sometimes the way things should be. Finishes wet and refreshing... this is one that I might have to go back to over the summer, along with the ""season-suitable"" pilseners and hefeweizens."
"This is an all-around good and highly drinkable beer. Is it anything out of this world? No. But it is a very enjoyable beer for what it is, and is far better than anything in its price range. This is an old-school American amber lager with flavor. This is the perfect beer for those hot summer days, when you just want something cold and refreshing."
"D: I love strong barleywines, RIS's, IPA's and all those big beers, but when I want a beer to session on I have been looking to this stuff for years, especially with such a low pricetag."
"As American Macro's go, this is the best. Inexpensive (it's the same price as most macro's on tap at most bars) but with exceptional taste. Absolutely more flavor than most macros, it is up there with the best lagers that I've had. Thicker mouth feel than almost all other beers you get at ""regular"" bars, it's what I get when I'm at a bar."
"The bottom line: Yuengling is not a beer that is worth seeking out. However, if you're in PA and visiting the hockey arena or the ballpark...or even the ""standard bar," then this is a great option in lieu of the big macros. It's not going to knock your socks off, but I tend to drink a lot of this when I'm in PA."
"This is my favorite American Lager out there. Light and easy to drink but still quite tasty. Little low on the carbonation but it's not too bad. The absolute best beer in the world to have with a plate of chicken wings. Also pretty good after mowing the lawn. Both the on-tap and bottled versions are great, but I think I prefer to drink this out of a bottle."
"Note: I think there might have been a problem with this can or something because I've had this beer before and liked it more. I will re-review at some point."
"D - A very, very drinkable brew. It's not gonna floor you with complexity or anything, but if you like apples as much as I do, you will really like this. I really can't believe how much this tastes EXACTLY like red apple skin."
"D-this is a step in the right direction as far as Macros go,very enjoyable"
"Poured a reddish amber with a decent white head, no real nose on the pour and some. Taste is light on malt, light on hops and light on TLC in general.Taste was a bit astringent, weak on the malt, no real character or backbone. There is nothing exciting about this beer other than Pennsylvanians love it because its from Penn. Not the best but not the worse either."
"Urine."
"This is the beer that got be drinking beer. A smooth drinkability goes with this beer. Also, it just looks pretty in a glass, just a beautiful amber color. It's odd, because as much as I've had this beer I still can't quite describe the flavor but I can always taste it in my mind. It's a very unique flavor to me, I can pick this drink out of almost any beer out of the just tons of different ones I've had. It is my standard issue beer for me, if I don't want to try something new, then I always default to my friend Yuengling."
"Poured from a bottle from Yuengling's Xmas variety pack (Lager, Ale, black & tan). Nice dark amber color with a one finger head. Grainy smell, nothing overwhelming in terms of malt or hops. The taste is similar. No dominant taste, I suppose it is malt cut by corn then the bitter taste of the hops. Crisp carbonation and a clean finish. I have noticed sometimes lager has a sweet taste and some times it doesnt. I am not sure if it is the beer or its my taste. Overall drinkability is high. In my area, this a beer to look for if you are out a bar. Lager is available everywhere. Hands down winner over BMC which is really is competition based on pricing. I suppose Bud is now noticing the growth of Yuengling Lager with their Bud-The Great American Lager campaign as Yuengling Lager is often know simply as Lager. I often find this in MD for about $14.00 a case, which you cant beat."
"D - Yuengling Traditional Lager is my beer of choice when I need to buy a plethora of alcohol for a social gathering. Its great flavor coupled with its lightness allows for plentiful consumption and is an excellent addition to a meal, especially a BBQ."
"Much better than pounding a macro lager all night, now, if they would just distribute in St. Louis."
"I didn't think it possible that an American ""commercial"" non-craft beer would become a staple in my beer fridge. Yuengling proved me wrong..."
"ok, i had this in a can and drank it out of a can. smell is a faint sweetness in the malt. taste is a lot different that i thought it would be. a buddy of mine was like ""dude you gotta try yuengling lager out of the can man"" he was telling me that in the can its like a totally different beer. the light doesn't hit it at all. its got a good sweet amber malt taste to it. not like a s strong as a sturdy amber ale but, i kind of like it. it's a lot better than i thought it would be. mouth feel is a bit carbonated for my likings (macro'ish). it's not bad. would be a great session beer for when you hang out with the friends that only like macro's in an attempt to persuade them to partake in something better. oh and, if you haven't tried it. give their porter a try."
"Not a lot to this beer, but drinkability is very good. Nice combination of taste and balance to drink all day."
"The taste is mild and a little bitter at times, but very drinkable. Living in SE PA, I certainly pick it up/order before even beginning to consider other mass brews (of which I don't consider this beer a macro brew). If you have not tried it before, I would defiantly recommend it. It seems to work well for the occasional BBQ or other outdoor summer events."
"all in all, a decent beer for a friday night after taking in countless hours in a surgery ward."
"Drinkability: When this beer is cold, it's enjoyable. The sweetness is a tad cloying for my taste, however, and detracts a bit from the drinkability. Overall, a nice beer, which I usually take for granted since it's the ""bud"" of pennsylvania. Worth a try, especially in warm weather."
"I was very thirsty after mowing the lawn so I went for a cold yugy. Beer pours a deep amber with a non-existent head. Grainy nose, beery malt accented flavor that my Dad would have loved. Aftertaste is sweet malt with just a hint of hops and a smooth aftertaste. Great pizza or barbecue beer."
"I will always come back to this beer, especially when the cash is low. The best cheaper beer out there."
"Final Thought: Yeah if your a college student pretending to be a beer nut then you might raise a few eyebrows with this brew. If your a beer tyrant, your'll probably throw this beer to the dungeon. I personally think this beer as average and nothing special or anything to write home about. So to those who haven't tasted this yet then it's worth a try. Cheers mate"
"A perfectly respectable lager that is an inexpensive, readily available alternative (depending on where you live) to macro lagers."
"If you're beering on a budget, and it's available, then it's worth a look, and always useful to have in the fridge when ""less worthy"" friends come over for a brew."
"This is pretty much my standby beer of choice- I can't believe it's taken me so long to review it. Pours clear copper with a medium sized head that dissipates very quickly and leaves some lacing on the surface. Smell is almost all malt with just a touch of herbal hops. Taste has a very light sweetness. Nice malty flavor with a toasted note. A touch of hops in the finish. Smooth. Light to medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Very drinkable."
"Typical Amber Lager flavor, with a bit of corn mixed in. This is an okay session ale, but it's nothing that I would rush to buy."
"I wouldn't say I crave this like I've heard easterners gush about it, but if it's this or mainstream lagers, this isn't a bad option at all."
"Drinkability: You can put a few of these down quite easily. It won't really contribute much to a meal, but it won't really detract from many foods, either."
"my cousin brought this over for me, i've never had it before, just heard about them. supposed to be great... but this is far from it. i dont know if this one is skunked, but it is not impressive. it looks really good out of the bottle, has a nice copper color to it, head is big but dies down quickly. the smell is nearly unbearable , extremely skunky, more than even your czech pils. it is really really bad. pungent skunkiness.. taste is somewhat bitter, but very watery. little to no malt flavor, just tastes bland. mouthfeel is watery and with a little carbonation. drinkability is low. i think this one is skunked, but who knows, maybe this is how the beer is, i'm not impressed at all."
"Drinkability- Good overall American Lager, good tasting, looking, and decently priced."
"Dark gold to light amber pour. Smell is of tart malt, and lager yeast. Taste was mild malt sweetness, an almost cooked rice component and a touch of some kind of chemical taste for a while there, but not really offensive. Overall, for a pale lager, this is pretty nice and a decent, easy drinking simple beer. Thanks Ty!"
"On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. That is not to say it's the most complex or most likely to knock your socks off, but it is drinkable. However, Yuengling needs to ditch the green bottles in the worst way."
"That being said, I can't really understand why people get all horny over this beer. It's certainly not a bad choice for Getting Drunk, but for the price, I believe it's no better or worse than the immediate competition. If it were available in Boston bars in 16 oz. bottles for the same price as Brubaker ($2-2.50), I'd probably have already thrown more than a few back by now (how much does a pint go for out in PA/NJ, anyway?). As a 12-pack selection however, this one just doesn't wet my whistle. I'd rather pay slightly less and go for the PBR, or pay slightly more and actually enjoy the flavor of my beer."
"This beer is better than I remember, maybe it's best on-tap. The beer arrived with a small white head that dissipated quickly and a pleasing deep amber color. It tasted well balanced with a decent amount of hop flavor and a pleasing light malt character. A good beer to buy a pitcher of with your buddies."
"Recommended (but then again, you've probably already tried it at least once, especially if you're on the East coast)..."
"Drinkability - easy drinking, I grew kind of fond of this one bottle I had, I'd buy it again if it became available in my area"
"For the price, not to mention the memories for all of you PA dwellers out there, the drinkability here is rather good."
"Overall this is a bit above average, and definitely a good choice in its prices range. A nice, cheap beer that's good for session drinking, or even getting people a bit more interested in beer with more flavor."
"Pours a golden color. Smell is grainy, sweet malt, and taste is more of the same. I also pick up a distinct metallic twang in the taste, with no hop flavor coming through. I would prefer this to the standard typical BMC offerings, but would not seek this one out. Having said that, it would be a good tailgating/BBQ beer."
"An easy to drink beer that straddles the line between light lager and Vienna with a few of its own quirks. Not bad, not great."
"D: This is a great tasting, easy drinking beer as well as cheap. One of my favorite everyday drinkers."
"While this is not the best beer in the world it is a nice beer. It is better than most commonly availble american beers from large companies. It is not a beer that I would go out of my way to buy, or a beer that I would buy if there were nice imports or craft beers at the bar. On a nice summer evening sitting on the deck this would be a good beer to have beside you. It is not available in many places but if you come across it for the first time pick up a six pack and enjoy."
"This beer goes down easy and can be had in quantity. Better than the macro beers out there. Try it with a burger and fries."
"D - Extremely drinkable, great social/party beer. Nothing spectacular, but for what it is it's a very nice brew."
"This is a great everyday beer. Cheeper than most craft beers but ten times better than your average macro lager. Appearance light amber in color head was a bit of a disapointment. Smell sweet malt and caramel. Taste again sweet malt and caramel and just a hin of hops to balance it. Mouthfeel lite body mediem carbonation nothing profound. Drinkability very good keep a six pack in the back of the fridge for emergencies."
"This is my go-to beer. Pours a nice amber with a nice, big head that dissapates quickly. Very sweet and malty in the nose. Tastes sweet with a tad of bitterness and a tiny bit metallic (only experienced metallic on tap). The perfect sit-on-your-ass-and-watch-tv beer. When buying cases of bottles you will occassionally get a ""bad batch"" that just tastes aweful. Best on tap. On thing to keep in mind: When consumed in large quantities, this beer will give you what is commonly known as ""The Yueng Farts", which may turn in to ""The Yueng Shits"". If you're out at the bar and plan on drinking a lot of Yuenging, make sure that the next day is free of any formal events (weddings, job interview, church, etc.)."
"Overall this is a pretty solid beer, somewhat of an ""old reliable""."
"I love this beer, for just lounging around and drinking. It's a much better beer then miller or Budweiser, and not that much more expensive. This is a good American Lager, that is good for any occasion. It's not a heavy beer, but just a good all around beer. Coming from the oldest Brewery in America, they must be continuing to do something right."
"All around good beer."
"Not quite a summer lager, but a refeshing drinkable beer that I love with any flavorful food. It's simple and cheap, but it blows the bud-brothers and miller-motha's out of the wort. Drink one by the grill, or by the camp fire, or two while you're grilling on the camp fire. If you want a six+/- dollar six pack Yuengling is my choice every time."
"I feel like everyone I went to college with is obsessed with this beer. It is good, but not amazing. A definite session beer. I think it is one that all should try at some point."
"This beer is very easy to drink if you want something uncomplicated but not lacking in all flavor. I get this quite a bit, actually, when I go to non-beer restaurants because it's often the best beer they have."
"Color is light brown or amber with a thin, off white head. Smell is slightly musty, can't pick up much else. Taste is a light sweet malt, can't detect much else. Mouthfeel is light and smooth with prickly carbonation. Very easy to drink. Although not too impressive when compared to most beers, this is one of my favorites to drink at a bar, party, or barbeque. It is a very popular beer in the Philly/S. Jersey area and usually order by requesting ""a lager""."
"Nice light amber apearence, thin light head a little lacing on the glass. Slight bready, slight hop aroma, A little malt in the flavor, a little hops in the taste. Over all an easy drinking beer that I would not mind on a hot summer day. From the U.S. oldest brewery I like this beer. A perfect session beer to drink on warm days with your mates..."
"Very clear, light amber with a thin, off-white cap. Bubbles were fairly coarse and soapy, fair retention with a bit of lace. Floral hop aroma with a bit of caramelized malt, brown sugar. Same in the flavour with light bitterness and lemony hops at the end. Light bodied with strong carbonation. Not bad for an inexpensive lager. Flavours stayed palatable as it warmed."
"Citrus start with a good toasted bread finish. Soft mouthfeel. A relaxed easy drinking beer."
"BK"
"I first had this beer in the poconos in Pennsylvania on tap. It is a red colored beer and has a pretty good head. Leaves some when finished on the glass. This beer is a premeire beer for Pennsylvanians. It is a good beer for any type of day or not and whatever type of season. It goes down very smooth and finishes very well."
"Pours a deep, hazy ruby/amber. Great looking head, tan and thick, lots of lace. Aroma is earthy and malty, some grain, not much evidence of hops. Earthy and malty. Lots of grain, with a hint of sweet malt. A little bit of hop dryness at the end. Mouthfeel is slick and full. This a pretty refreshing lager, though not my first choice. More grainy (reminds me of a Pilsner flavor) than I would like out of a darker lager. I usually lean towards Sam Adams Boston Lager, but being from the Philly area, you have to take pride in Americas oldest brewery."
"D= very drinkable in single or in-session."
"Overall I find Yuengling Traditional Lager to be very drinkable, although it has a slightly odd aftertaste. Its a truly a present whenever I get a chance to drink it. Based on its price, it would probably be a standard in my fridge."
"Overall: This beer is an institution in PA and can be found on-tap at virtually every corner bar. Beats the pants off of the BMC brands and has a character all its own. A reliable and tasty lager. Don't change, Yuengling!"
"D: While this isn't an exceptional beer, is very easy to drink and has a very distinct flavor (at least to me) and is very enjoyable. Given low abv and pleasing aftertaste this is very easy to drink and enjoy. I add an extra .5 in this category for it's price and availability where I'm from as I would happily drink this over any BMC product. Also, it's America's oldest operating brewery or whatever, that counts for something, right??"
"Body is between light and medium, with average mouthfeel and drinakbility. Better than your standard macro crap, but realy doesn't taste like much to me."
"D - This was introduced to me years ago by a friend of mine. He had bought a 12 pack of it out of state. It is seldom that I buy a U.S. Macro, but when I do, it is usually Yuengling."
"D--I would have this beer in the face of macro brew but wouldn't look to buy this in bulk."
"D- ive had this many times ice cold from a green bottle- no pint glass- and it was excellent. in fact, 4th of july wouldn't be the same without it. neither would memorial day. out of this brown 22oz with a new contemporary non-paper logo, it leans heavy toward the malt side and feels funny overall. maybe i should review again when i get some more of the stuff i'm used to..."
"Light bodied and refreshing, it has a bit more maltiness and sweetness than I expected, but in a pleasant way. Not complex, but i will go back to this one when my options are few. Around Leinenkugel's quality, a bit above most ""macros""."
"Poured into a large mug straight from the bottle. A thick puffy head of foam appeared and transformed into a thin lace in about 15 minutes. It was a orange/copper color with a medium body.The after taste was pretty grainy but not overpowering. This in general is a medium beer. It is medium in body, carbonation, and taste. It is a great beer to have if you are tired of hoppy or heavy beers. Yuengling is a beer that would work with the typical macro drinker, or the beer enthusiast."
"Pours amber color with decent head. Smells lightly of malts but much. Tastes kind of bready, sweet malts, some hop spice...pretty good for a macro lager. It is what it is and I would say it's definitely Top3 as far as the best American Macro Lager genre is concerned. Light and carbonated mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable."
"This stuff is not sold where I am so this is the first time I've had it and I believe it rivals heine as an everyday-boring lager. I'll buy more when I can."
"Overall: Very Anti-Climatic. Other than the appearance there is almost nothing else going on."
"We call em dingers around here. The best macro on the market. Easy on the pallet, nothing offensive not great. Good beer for an all nighter or a week long binge in myrtle beach or pinehurst. I like this beer alot when i am broke and cant afford my usuals."
"D: It gets some extra points for being Yuengling because I grew up on it and know that I have drunk it all night before."
"Nice golden amber color with minimal head. Smells a bit grainy, with mild hops and carbonation, and finishes with a hint of diacetyl. Very drinkable, it has a quality/price ratio that is vastly superior to typical American macro lagers. Makes a great comfort beer."
"Thin head that disappears quickly. No lacing present. Magnificent amber body. Good light crisp fragrance. Very sweet and a little creamy. Good carbination. Dry finish... not much there in the end. This is a good beer to take out golfing or on a fishing trip but nothing I would bring out for company."
"Drank it from a pint glass. Very clear without hurting its amber appearance, but the head is quite thin and disappears quick. Nice sweet, hoppy taste for a macro brew, but feels watery on the palate. Carbonation might be a little strong going down. But once again, quite good for a macro."
"D: Easy to drink. Hell, at this point in my career, most beers are easy to drink. Some may call it a macro with caramel coloring, but this beer has more body and taste than most for nine dollars a twelver."
"A pretty drinkable beer, especially for a macro. If I could find it in the midwest I would drink this all the time. The beer pours a dark gold, almost amber color. It has a pretty good taste, fairly malty and hoppy. The taste finishes crisp and clean. A decent beer."
"D: One of the best session beers out there. Great for tailgating and golfing, and one of the starter beers."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer this was my session beer of choice when I lived in NY and I think it was the first pitcher of beer that I ever had so I have a special spot for it"
"Where Yuengling does things right is in the drinkability. This is head-and-shoulders above the macro lagers, and even has an edge on a number of crafts. It's an every-day beer, a beer that you don't have to be in a mood to drink. I've had days where I don't feel like drinking a porter, or a stout, or an ale, or even a craft lager. But I've never had a day where I didn't feel like having a Yuengling. It's just a solid brew for any time, any place."
"This is not the greatest lager in the world but definitely not the worst. For it's price, it's an excellent value and a much better product than the other American mega-pales out there."
"A vendor that works for me went to penn. for the Osu game. He gave me and a co worker a twelve pack to split. Wow this beer in a sense is amazing. It has a big brew taste but a little more complex. Huge malt flavor and some yeast> I didn't detect much hop flavor but I do not have a great palate. Great color and mouth feel. I wish they sold the whole line here in Ohio, I would really like to try the porter. I would suggest this beer to anyone to at least try. A peice of history that uses tradition that big brewers have left behind."
"Solid. No frills, not bad."
"Again not the best flavor, smell, or appearance I have had. But there is just something about it that keeps it at the top of my favorites list."
"Overall: A very good lager, one of my favorites, and for the money you can't beat it. Not to heavy, not to light. A beer you can have several of and not feel full, yet it's not like drinking water."
"It's an amber lager by color, but close your eyes and it might be Coors Banquet beer. This is not bad beer, but not good either. It is boutique macro lager with a darker color and a wee bit more body and flavor - or so your eyes tell you when you see it in your glass. I like the brewery's history and longevity, but I'm not fond of the way it has positioned itself in the market as virtual craft beer (in the eyes of the college boys who think they're going upmarket on this one). Around my neck of the woods it is the same price as Coors Banquet, so I'll just stay honest and drink the Coors. It's a good beer though if you find yourself in a dismal bar that only has Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light, and Corona. It tastes of faint crystal malt and some corn, and often wet cardboard. I had it fresh once and it had the diacetyl thing going on, which was weird, but at least it masked the adjunct flavor. Still though, I wouldn't want to see this brewery go changing or nuthin'."
"Cans, get the cans! I recommend it."
"Pours a golden brown color with no head...I really didn't notice much to the smell. The taste seemed a bit watered down...if you could really call it a taste. I was definitely unimpressed with this beer and am confused as to why so many people rate it better."
"This is just an average beer. Nothing complex about it but also nothing offensive either although it is very watery."
"Had a cold pint of one of my old favorites at the Sherwood Golf Club in Titusvill, Florida. It poured a light copper color with nearly no head and very little evidence of any lacing. The aroma was light but pleasant blending brown sugar and malt. The taste is a sweet wheat/cereal with a touch of maple in there. It's very sprite and refreshing, evenly carbonated but generally kind of thin bodied. Easy to drink if you like a sweeter lager with not much guts. It's always an acceptable brew especially after 18 holes with a couple of pals. Nothing too memorable but OK and better than any macros I can think of."
"I just don't see what everyone in this area gets excited about when drinking this beer."
"Way way way overcarbonated... almost undrinkable to me for that reason. This might be the most overrated beer on the market."
"Clear copper with a rich, off white head. White dies down quickly to a film. Light-to-moderate lacing. Light and clean smell. Only a touch of sweetness and a hint of hops. Taste was mild-mannered and clean, but not light; a pleasant mixture of hops and light malty sweetness (like light brown sugar). Mouthfeel has a rich creaminess to it and modest carbonation. This is a nice, 4-4, go to alternative to the BMC crew. The price ($5.49 at the local grocery) is also hard to beat."
"D- Very drinkable if you want to drink a 12 pack. Light enough on your stomach that you could do so. Too commercialized for me and my interests, but if you want to get drunk on something besides Bud Light or Miller Lite, it will work."
"Very much of a session beer; a step above the BMC class but still nothing special."
"Perfect amount of hops and grain and the right amount of carbonation for a lager makes it one of the best full bodied lagers around."
"Overall, just not my style, but still a fine beer. I know I already said it twice, but it really taste alot like a Heine. If you are about taste and not a label snob, and you are a Heine lover, give this beer a shot. For your money, you can buy twice as many!"
"Ok, this isn't going to compare to a cask ale or a Belgian, but for $8/12 pack it simply can't be beat!!! The taste is very light and easily palatable. I've told people before I'd almost describe it as ""newcastle light."" It has the similar nutty taste as newcastle with a lighter character."
"Beer pours a golden amber with a very light lacey head. Smell is of a light malt, smells ""beery"". The taste is of a light amber lager, nothing really special about it. I could put down quite a few in a night given the chance. At the price this sells at, you can't beat it; around here though, there are better options."
"Basically, you could do far, far worse than Yuengling. It's not the best beer out there, but for $5.50 a pitcher at Wings and Ale, it's a far cry better than the other brews on tap. After a long day at work, it tastes a whole lot better too..."
"Hard not to give this a high drinkability. At 4.9% and with a non-offensive taste you should be able to drink this all night. That is if you wanted to. Not outstanding, but still a good lager"
"Drinkability - Incredibly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. It's very smooth and highly drinkable. I really could session this all night. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. For anyone near PA or the east coast, give it a try. It's not a great beer, but it is surprisingly pretty good."
"The appearance is still quite a nice amber with a decent head and a good amount of carbonation-- but the flavor profile just seems weaker than before. I hope I'm not becoming a beer snob on this because I used to reallly enjoy yuengling. It is possible that I prefer the draft or other styles by these guys to this but I really dont think its good for much other than having it on a hot beach or some other Summer outdoor activity."
"Drinkability - a fairly plain, brew with very average sessionability. There are cheaper options with as much or more flavor."
"Overall, this is a good macro-lager. It's refreshing on a hot day with enough flavor to keep interest. It has a simple appeal, but is not flavorless."
"Drinkability- For me this is a great beer. This is my session beer!! I love having this in my fridge as my everday brew. Wish I could get it here in LA."
"Amber pour with little head that dissipates quickly. Next to no lacing on glass. Not a whole lot of hop character to this one. Much better than macro pale lagers and not over-carbonated. Very smooth and easy to drink. Aroma is fairly benign with hints of caramel malt."
"This is one of the first ""dark"" beers I ever had when I was a young kid! Needless to say, I knew nothing at the time about beer."
"A highly drinkable beer. Nothing really offensive about it. Pours a decent head without lacing. The smell is slightly skunky and also pours an oft-red color. Taste is pretty grainy and smooth, not well balanced as there are really not any hops to speak of. But nonetheless, a decent highly drinkable beer."
"The pour is a nice copper color with an off white head of medium size. Head disipates somewhat quickly. Nose is grainy but not excessive, some sweetness from the malt is present. Flavor is slightly sweet in the intro but balances out nicely. Finish is crisp and aftertaste screams for another drink. This is a wonderful step up in body and flavor from the traditional macros but not cloying like many of the ambers out there. good stuff."
"Yuengling beer is very popular in Hilton Head, SC presumably due to all the transplanted Pennyslvanians. It is a smooth amber brew, somewhat rather bland in flavor. It has a taste that goes down easy and can sneak up on you. I would be nice if a Distributer would pick it up in Georgia so I don't have to travel across state lines."
"Appropriately amber colored with an average amount of head with an average-to-short lifespan. Nose is grainy with a decent malt presence and a bit of hops. The taste is unexpectedly sweet but not offensively so, with some balance from the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, making this one quite drinkable--something the taste itself can't do. Earlier in the day I had an Iron City lager, and this one is preferable for certain."
"This isnt bad bad beer but when I drank religiously.I swear it never tasted like this and now it taste sorda crappy.I guess my palate changed alot in the past two years."
"This is a very average beer in all ways. The head is okay but dissipates quickly, there is little if any lacing, and the smell is metallic and has macro written all over it. The taste is on the dry side, decently carbonated, and I detect some maltiness that is bordering on a carmel flavor. The aftertaste is a bit hoppy. The beer is light bodied although the amber color does raise expectations a bit. This isn't a bad beer, only average. On a summer's picnic, what the heck, drink a few, you could do a lot worse. You could also do much better, but in the antiquity stakes, one has to try Yuengling for its historical value if nothing else."
"A gifted one quart bottle from a Yuengling fanatic...interested to give it a try after all the talk....Pours a clear amber with intense carbonation, a two finger white head held by bubbles. Aroma is hoppier than your average 'macro'...faint hop smell, but it is present, mixed with yeasty aromas and a bit of that adjunct smell...reminds me of the budweiser brewery to be honest. Not ultra psyched at this point. Taste is a letdown...it's very bud like, it's clean but watery, and nonthreatening. I don't mind it...but its not an amazing taste. Less aftertaste than bud, i'd say, and that is an improvement. Warmed up, its more of the same. On the whole, the more I drank the less I liked, much like when I drink a macro. One is plenty...the rest of the bottle ended up getting sampled by friends and drain-poured in one way or another. Better than bud, I guess. Overall, its a cheap beer (price), and if I were local and the kind of person that felt like this was the kind of beer to turn to when hot and sweaty, I'd choose this over others. But I'm not. So the bottom line for me is, it has adjuncts that do not enhance the flavor, and it is very noticeable, and I I like the flavor of beer so I don't want it tamed down or muted by flavorless adjuncts...so give me a malty pale ale or a good pils instead."
"M/D: crisp carbonation and thin body make this very easy to drink, but not enjoyable to drink."
"A nice summer treat. Though, hard to come by in these parts. Snagged this batch in NY."
"I got this out of a keg at a major gathering. It pours a rich dark amber or honey color, rather inviting. Aroma is strong and quite malty, not complex but pleasant. Flavor is full, malty, rather pleasing. It fills the mouth and is not at all watery. Plain, but drinkable and good for parties."
"I have since had it in the bottle and find it better than the can but still not as good as on tap. Has anyone else experienced this with Yuengling?"
"Drinkability: If you're looking to pound back a lot of beer, this is a good one to do it with. It's a step above your typical draft domestics, but still not a top-shelf type of beer. Good taste, but nothing that's going to blow you out of the water."
""
"12oz green bottle. Tap version also sampled. Have always loved the label of an American bald eagle with its talon resting on a beer cask. Makes me feel patriotic as I enjoy a fresh sample from America's oldest brewery. Pours amber with a quickly disappearing head and has macro style, almost soda-pop sized bubbles.Smells of corn like a macro beer concentrated times three. Subtle bittering hop nose of fresh mown hay. Taste is a very light and subtle balance of sweet-corn/malt and bittering hops. Carbonation makes this a crisp, light and refreshing beer. No surprises as far as taste; it's just a simple light refresher that's a few notches better than Bud/Miller/Coors. A bit better than Killian's because of the slight edge in hop flavor. I would advise buying by the case to protect this green bottle beer from getting light-struck and skunky."
"This beer is all the rage in Ohio. A ton of people talk about it and I think it is just because it is not distributed in Ohio. Overall it is a decent beer. It has a nice hop flavor but is a little light for the style of beer. It is much better than some other attempts at this beer from some of the big breweries. Overall a good beer but I think it is somewhat overrated."
"Overall an easy drinking lager. Very servicable."
"Not a bad effort and I have wanted to review Yuengling since I first had it 3 years ago."
"D- If the taste of this beer was somehow transfered into a slightly better smelling and feeling brew I might enjoy it. As it was I have to disagree with the enjoyableness of Yuengling Lager."
"Given some proper distribution this beer could give PBR a run for its money in my opinion. I'm sure it will remain Pennsylvania's dirty little secret but it would be nice to see a beer like this come along and break up the macro lager monotony. Not great, but it's something a little unique amongst its peers."
"D- Since it's so thin, it's pretty drinkable, but the skunk killed it for me. Drink this in a can. It's not great, but it's much better. Or better yet, don't drink this at all, unless the only option is BMC. Go get some JW Dundee's if you want an excellent cheap lager."
"Pours a light amber color. Somewhat of a thin head but decent carbonation. Pretty average. Smell is nothing special to me, just some lagerness to it. Some malts but not overly so. Taste definitely isn't too complex but very refreshing. Good balance and about as good as many other lagers I've tried. Mouthfeel is light and crisp but not watered down. Not bad. Drinkability is ultra high as I enjoy the taste of this beer and it's so light and easy to consume. No way I can give it a 5 because overall this beer doesn't stack up to a 5 in any category. Definitely one of the most drinkable beers out there, though. The most affordable and still pretty good beer that you could possibly buy...that's for sure."
"Not bad...but not one I would seek out."
"Drink it on tap. Drink it from the bottle. This beer is satisfying, and if you're in a pinch for cash, there is no reason why you should punish yourself with other watered down options for the same price, when you can get so much more with this baby."
" Most places that serve this stuff on tap serve it ice cold in a frosted glass. I hate that. Frosted glasses a pet peeve of mine. I prefer this beer cold, but not so cold that it kills the flavor."
"D: This is a great gas-station beer in SC when you're with the family, grilling ribs and drinking from the bottle. Not bad, especially at $9 a 12 pack."
"Drunk from the bottle, showed a rich amber colour. I was at first put off by the green bottle, but the beer did not taste at all lightstruck. It had a watery mouthfeel, but tasted decent with a medium amount of hops. Not a lot of complexity, but I was still generally pleased with this beer."
"Pours a mid amber color with a smallish thin white head. Malty with a hop subtleness that balances the sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but overall, this seems to be a well crafted lager and one that would be easy to session. Goes great with a good pizza."
"If you can't get a good glass outta this one it's because you got a bad keg."
"Well, this is certainly a staple beer for those who want something with a little more flavor than the macros. It's darker in color, has more of a malty flavor and less bitterness and skunk, and is very drinkable. It's certainly one of the ""gateway beers"" out there, along with others like Sam Adams and Killians. Take it for what it's worth."
"D - I used to drink this particular beer by the pitcher when checking out local bands at basement clubs. Since it was available everywhere it was a good social, shareable brew. Back then It was convenient and I hadn't yet adopted the motto "" drink better, drink less"" I realised Yuengling Lager gave me headaches even if I had only two or three. I found them to be drinkable when choices are limited, but this was the first taste I have had of a Yuengling product in years."
"an over all good beer, especially for a social gathering or some pizza and a game."
"Definitely a pleasant tasting, reasonably priced session beer, and one substantialy better than many of its competitors. But I think that all things considered, regional bias goes a long way. Still, it's an old stand-by, and a taste of home when on the road."
"Pours a beautiful, crystal clear dark amber with golden highlights. Little to no head. Slightly dusty Vienna-style malt aroma with a sweet cooked corn character underneath. Not too pleasant. The taste is on the malty/corny side, with the malts hitting first but being quickly overtaken by a lightly sweet-and-sour taste. Hop bitterness is quite low and the finish is surprisingly thick. Mouthfeel is standard for the style -- light and fairly fizzy. Overall, this is nothing to write home about, but it does make a good ""safety beer"" when times are tough."
"Pours a very clear pale amber color, with a nice tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The smell is not very good, smells grainy, corn, very similar to Bud. The taste is that of a more malty Budweiser. It tastes like they use adjuncts though I am not sure. Has an artifical sweetner taste. I feel the taste gets worse as it warms. The feel is light and watery and leaves an unpleasant dry aftertaste. I thought this would have been labeled as an American macro, which would have probably helped its review but as an American amber lager, this is not very good. Drinks easy as most American macros do."
"D- I still consume more Yuengling than any other beer. I can session this all night and not be sick of it. I do, however, strongly prefer the draft version of this. If you want to try a good yeungling get it on tap."
"The aftertaste is smooth and with a slight kick, very clean. Overall, a good well rounded beer. Although tends to be a bit light, it is refreshing and highly drinkable."
"Not a bad lager, as I'm not a lager guy. I have one more bottle I'll keep until summer and try it then."
"And if you are ever in Northeastern Pennsylvania, I highly recomend stopping by for a tour of the historic brewery. You might even meet one of the Yuengling daughters there."
"Poured from a bottle into a mug. The head was thick at first, but quickly dissipated. Wonderful amber color. Pleasant aroma, but nothing incredible. I think I may have chilled it to too cold a temperature, so I didn't taste it fully, but it was quite palatable and tasty despite this. Overall, not my favorite for savoring, but good for a barbecue or party where you don't want to insult your guests with Bud. I'm currently living in PA, so this is currently my local brew of choice for relaxing with friends. A great choice that won't drain your cash flow."
"This reminds me of JW Dundee's Honey Brown, it's a sweet beer with a bit of caramel malted barley flavor thats dominated by sweetness. The aroma hinted strongly at the use of adjucts, I'd guess corn on this one, but I could be wrong. Still, there's a bit of decent malt that makes this an amber. This is a beer I'd accept from a friend and drink, but never pay for."
"It is also great to have on hand at parties for every one loves a beer from Pottsville. For people who dont care what beer they drink and morally just go to Bud, this is a great beer to get them hooked on."
"All in all a very tasty mass-produced local (for me) beer."
"Clear golden, with an amber tint. Thin white head disappears rather quickly. Pale malty aroma, grainy, with a bit of floral hops at the end. Some sweetness, pale malt flavors, grainy, astringent. There is a decent body for the stlye. Not overly carbonated. Pretty easy to drink, but not much is going on here. Not bad in a pinch, but not really worth seeking out."
"Found this amber macro on vacation and couldn't pass up the price. Pours out a mild amber color with fizzy rather than foamy head, just when I began to fear this would be a good giveaway beer I smelled the rich hoppy aroma. Intrigued, I tasted a solid and flavorful amber at a reasonable price. Wish this was in my area,"
"This one's not totally lifeless or unappealing, but still average overall. There are better domestic macro lagers for the same (or less, where I live) money."
"D: I would drink this and keep this in the fridge. But will not be the first i grab."
"D - This beer does the job...its exactly what I expected, and there's nothing wrong with it at all. I'm not about to bash it because of the size of the brewery...personally, I don't care for these lighter lagers, but as far as being a good representation of the style, this fits like a glove."
"This one is definitely a couple of shades darker than your average macro-lager....a nice deep gold. It sports a sudsy head that shrinks rapidly but never disappears. The smell is faint but there's some good bready malt and toasted grain mixed in with citrus and tea-like hops...a nice balance going on there. In the taste there's more hops here than in your typical macro-lager and the toasted grain comes through as well. Adjuncts seem to have been used sparingly. This brew's main failing is in mouthfeel. It comes across as watery making that nice flavor all too shortlived. I don't expect it to be ""thick"" and palate-coating like an IPA but even for a lager this one is too watery. Even so, this is what BudMilCoors should be."
"Overall: A pretty average brew overall, which is to say better than virtually any other macro-lager. A good alternative at your local watering hole."
"Ok my last one for now. These macro reviews are killing my tastebuds, well not really giving them a workout would be more accurate ;) Well I guess Yuengling isn't really a macro, but still a light lager so I went ahead and added them into my tasting. Poured a decent amber with a small white head. Lots of visible carbonation and very clear consistency. At least the tone has a decent reddish tint. Smell was full of grains and not really much else, slight hint at a caramel or sugar sweetness but very slight and only as it warmed. The taste was a little musty. Grain, corn, and grass flavors were the big players here, slight amount of caramel trying to come through but never really made it. The feel was very smooth, decent body, not as light as some others. Overall it had a bit more of a flavor profile then some of the others did, but still needs a little work. I could see myself having one at a ball game if it were between this and BMC."
"A very drinkable lager, one of my favorites when im out at a bar with a less-than-impressive selection of beers, or when money is an issue. Of course, being on tap always helps as well."
"went well with my chicken quesadilla."
"Poured from the tap to an amber color with small off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left okay lacing. Som ehops in the aroma, but nothing dominant. Likewise with the taste. At only 4.9%, the alcohol never made itself known, and the finish was okay, but nothing special. I can see how this could make a decent, low-priced session beer, but for quality rating, it left something to be desired."
"This is nicer than most macros, but still a pretty thin brew."
"Overall this brew isn't too bad for what I'd consider an American Macro Lager. This was served to me on tap in a pint glass, and it didn't really have much head, acually no head. The body was a reddish amber and crystal clear. I couldn't really detect much aroma, but a slight light straw or hay aroma. Tastes pretty smooth, a little bit of a sweeter lager, but nothing too exciting. Even though the taste isn't really impressive, this brew does flow down nicely and is a bit refreshing."
"If you like Pizza and Beer, try Yuengling and the pizza from a local pizza parlor (not a chain--i.e. any hole-in-the-wall with an owner born in Chicago or New York). That is the perfect American meal."
"D - In spite of this beer's history, I was not impressed. I tried and tried, but could get almost no hops influence from this beer. I don't feel left out that I cannot get this in Colorado."
"I had a friend bring this beer back to IL last summer, I had never seen it. I had heard the name before that's it. I do enjoy it. coming from Chicago and the land of bud light and Miller lite it was nice to see a beer that in my opinion is just a basic beer, but with taste. I just got home from PA and did stop in Pottsville and bought some of the traditional Lager. So I will give some to my Neighbor and enjoy the rest myself. I just wish it was available outside the east coast."
"It is a better choice than macros and I can get it around here for the same price."
"Without a doubt you need to try. You will not be disappointed."
"Yuengling pours a clear red/gold with a thin foamy head. Smell is sweet and grainy. Taste is a grainy malt flavor, very little hops, only a very slight bitterness. Yuengling is better than some, but nothing special, really just a good macro. I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"*Drinkability may be the biggest selling point for this beer. Whether Im looking for a quality 6-pack to chill out to during a game or Im buying a few cases for a huge party Im going with Yuengling Traditional Lager."
"I didn't buy this bottle (no, I didn't steal it either)...and I would never buy this. Life's too short to drink average beer."
"D- This beer is very light but the malt flavors are very nice. It would be nice to have some hop flavors to balance them or cover the sulfury notes a bit."
"Love this beer for its price, can't go wrong with this one. Better than any of the macros out there. Too bad you can't have it in LA. Hope they market this beer all over the country, a lot of beer lover is missing a lot. First time I tried this beer was when I had to picked up my cousin who attended Penn State and even went to the brewerey in Pottsville. Great beer for the price."
"D: Yuengling Lager has a permanent special place in my beer pantheon. It was the first non-macro that I'd ever had and it got me through 4.5 years at Dear Old State."
"Drinkability: This is clearly a marketed beer for those who want something unassuming and affordable. It is so BLAH that I don't feel like I am drinking anything. Wouldn't bother paying for it."
"D: The best part of this beer -- oddly enough given that none of its other scores are all that high -- is that it's pretty drinkable, especially on a hot summer day. It's got a little more flavor and body than the average American Macro Lager, and it's dirt cheap compared to craft brews. A great post-lawnmowing beer or to be used as I'm using it now -- drinking some of it, pouring some of it into the chili I'm making. . . ."
"Pretty good session beer, but nothing remarkable flavor wise."
"Dark amber with minimal head on the pour. Smells of corn and taste is the same. No lingering aftertaste to speak of. From the bottle I prefer Yeunglings Black and Tan. This is one of those beers that is far better on tap. I buy this every few months as it's my beer from home and I'll always have a soft spot for ""a lager"". Used it to wash down some perogies. Seemed appropriate."
"Not a good day for kegged beer. It still poured a nice, red color with an off-white, thick head. Smelled ok and malty, like Yuengling normally does. The taste was barely existent; kind of bitter. The mouthfeel was very watery. The beer was still pretty drinkable, but I had to switch to the bottle afterwards in order to get the better Yuengling taste that I'm used to."
"The main thing to know about this brew is that it is much better out of the bottle and can than it is out of the keg. Out of the keg, it is way to sweet. I got this bottle at Prime Time Sports Grill and enjoyed it. It was dark in color but not out of the lager category. It was malty but not to malty. If I had to critisize this I would say that there was nothing special about it. In an ironic way that makes it even the more special. Good Brew. Don't drink and review."
"not bad. screw top green bottle. nice amber color,not much head retention and lite lacing down the side of the glass.feels good on the pallet.real easy beer to drink and finishs smooth. i first heard of this beer on the history channel. it is cheap enough at eight bucks a half case so it was worth a try. ill buy some more soon."
"D: Goes down very easily and not very filling, but not much flavor at all. I was on vacation and this was the only beer in Wal-Mart that wasn’t made by AB, Miller, Coors, Heiniken or Corona. Since I knew I couldn’t get this one at home, I tried, but wasn’t very impressed."
"Overall not very good. Drinkable, because it has very little constitution about it. Maybe with something subtle like sushi in lieu of Sapporo or Kirin Ichiban? The age of the brewery (oldest in the US) is by far the most impressive thing about this beer, sadly."
"Drink-Ability: What can I say its and old school lager that will never go away. Good Beer."
"Was interested to try this beer as it is advertised as ""America's original"" or ""oldest"" lager. Not terribly impressed however. And I think the green bottle adds to a slight skunking of the beer. Tasted like a typical American Macro Lager, not much now to add. I think I'd order a Bud over this in the future though."
"D: Pretty drinkable, especially if you are a little short on cash."
"I have beer born and raised in Wilkes-Barre PA, about 45 minutes from the yuengilng brewery in Pottsville, but tonight was the first time I actually tried it. And I have to say, Im impressed. Being in college, I mostly drink the decent, locally brewed Lionshead for $10 a case, but tonight for some reason I decided to get a sixer of this at the local pizza store. Pours a gorgeus amber color though has a less than impressive smell. I would expect a richer smell because of the color but i didnt give up on it yet. It pours a good 2"" head at first and dissipates to about a half a centimeter in a few minutes. I swirled it around and found the lacing to be more than average but not extraordinary. Has a malty taste but finishes very clean all over the pallet. Not as wattery as BMC, but just a little thicker. It is a very refreshing brew, utterly drinkable and i eagerly look forward to buying a case of this and enjoying it. I'll still bust out the L-head for partys, but yuenging is just for me. I absolutly love this beer."
"Notes--This is not a beer to choose if you are looking for a really complex or high-quality, hand-crafted brew. If you just want something to drink while you are watching a favorite team play--I think it's hard to go wrong with this beer. It always makes me laugh when I see this one in a prepackaged ""Microbrew"" assortment."
"This beer suddenly got popular in the Northeast about three years or so ago. Even in townie bars, you can usually find it. This is really considered the best of the best for some non-BAs. I used to think it was the top of the line, but frankly that was before I knew anything about good beer. Not to cast aspersions in any direction; it's a decent brew. Relatively smooth and easy to drink, but it's like the top of the low-tier of beers."
"My go-to ""I-can't-afford-microbrews-right-now"" session beer."
"D: Solid lager. Hadn't been able to get it being in New England. Happy that my buddy brought me back a six pack. Easy drinking."
"Opinion: This is a really clean beer. It is pretty good, and I like the balance. You get a bit of sweetness, but for the most part the beer is just really drinkable. If it was local, I would drink it quite frequently, but since it is so hard to obtain I will just partake in it whenever it is convenient."
"Drinkabiility is pretty good. This is quite quaffable."
"The carbonation is light. Light to medium bodied. Usually leaves a slight tangy aftertaste. This is an easy-drinking every-day choice that is quality in a can for fishing trips. Not bad in the green bottle, but I stick away from the draft"
"This is the first serious beer I drank while attending college, and it certainly has influenced my taste in beers since then. It's starting to be found very commonly in the mid-atlantic and I find it goes great with any heavier meal. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but it's a solid choice that can be easily found."
"D- I'll only drink this from the bottle if I have one at all now. Drinking from a pint glass just fills my senses with bad noise."
"This is by far my favorite beer. I love the taste and I love the look of it. It is a lager and it shows. The color is great, the head is always there and the taste is exceptional. I highly recommend this beer to anyone in the area, I just wish it was available other places I travel to."
"drinkability: Not nearly as flavorless as other macro lagers, it actually has a little character to it. Quite drinkable."
"Unremarkable yellowish-brown with huge bubbles in the off-white head and moderate carbonation. Too-strong caramel, malts, and a bit of sulphur define the smell and taste, with a bit of hoppiness adding to the latter. Lacks depth and doesn't make up for it with pleasant flavors. I wonder if this bottle's gone bad because I don't remember Yuengling beiing this unpleasant back in college."
"Pours a deep copper breadcrust mixed nicely with volcanic bubbles ascending to the surface. About one and a half finger head with a thick foam. A slightly placid malt aroma and light bitterness seeping around at the end of my nostrils. The malts really permeates my sinus even. Light amber malts give a hint of bittersweet mixed with pellets of undesdinguishable pellets of hops."
"Pours a light brownish color with little head, retention, or lacing(from a bottle into a mug). Smells like a lager...malty, sharp, crisp. The light malt taste matches the smell, and is followed by a slight hoppy bitterness. This beer has a lighter body to it, with a fairly good amount of carbonation...crisp. Overall a good beer, and can be found at a very good price."
"Meh...hard to beat for the price and serves its purpose as a utility beer. Still, I don't really see what all the fuss is about. Simple, easy drinkin' beer."
"This is the first beer I've bought myself (at a grocery store no less) since I've moved from Mass to North Carolina. Now to visit the real beer stores and kick it up a notch."
"America's oldest brewery makes a great offering. Poured out a nice light brownish amber color from the emerald green bottle. Nice clean white head which lasted for a while. No real lacing present. Smells sharp with sweet maltness. Light sweet maltness in the taste as well. Hints of caramel or slight roastiness. Soft hop finish. Smooth all around. Nice mouthfeel and good drinkability. Great summertime brew. Get it for any cookout especially a clam bake! Makes for a great dish of steamers. Substitue for the water. Tasty inexpensive beer that I enjoy everytime I hit the lower states of the East coast. I wish it was easier to find around New England. Good overall qualities and enjoyable."
"When it's not fresh, the hops seem to loose out to sweet cardboard flavours."
"It pours a golden but not quite amber color, clear, with good head formation. Smell is of malt grains and corny DMS. Taste is similar and no hop bitterness is detected. Its light-bodied and crisp. The finish is mildly astringent, but otherwise there's no complaints with this one and at this point I'm used to it anyway. Am I biased? Hell yeah! Drinkability is out-freakin'-standing."
"M&D - drinkable, as a party beer, wouldnt make a good session beer, IMO"
"A very simple, very drinkable and pleasant lager. Nice light amber color. Nothing particularly remarkable about the flavor - enjoyable, but mild; very beer tasting. Miles above American macrobrews but still a few clicks below the more famous American craft beers. With a little more character this could go from average to excellent."
"."
"Smell - Bring the beer to your nose. Note the"
"I can't get Yuengling locally, but stock up thanks to the kindness of family members. This is a solid lager beer with a long and storied history. I think the fact that it is still family owned warrants patronage. It has enough body and character to distinguish itself from macros for we beer snobs. It's not going to set the world on fire when scrutinized at a tasting, but damn it, it's a very affordable, good lager beer, that is American owned and operated. Drink 1 or 2 when it's available and bask in your patriotism"
"This is my first Yuengling, and I must admit, I was quite excited to try it. It poured an orange bronze colour with a white foamy head that faded away in a few seconds leaving only a haze of white. Several streams of bubble consistently streamed upwards, keeping the foam blanket alive. Looks pretty good. Smell was sugary sweet malts and grainy corn. That's just what I got from it. I was a bit displeased with this, as the grainy corn smell is generally to be expected in brews of lower quality, IMO; I was hoping for more from this one I suppose. Taste was malty with little hops. Sweet with a bit of a sourness on this finish if you're looking for it. Mouthfeel is decent with a bit more weight than I was expecting. Overall, I was not impressed with this. This may be the nation's oldest brewery with some fantastic history behind it, but it just isn't for me. I'd drink it again if offered by some one, but really I didn't care for it."
"C-"
"While nothing in particular stood out to wow me, it was clean and refreshing and had some body to it. It was a good thirst-quencher if nothing else. At five bucks for a six-pack, it's a good value for a ""session"" choice. It's better cold - when it warms it has a bit of an odd aftertaste."
"Drinkability: A decent quaffer; not much flavor but refreshing the same way water is refreshing"
"This has been much appreciated when the only alternatives are BMC -- I'm surprised I hadn't reviewed it yet."
"Tailgate burgers in hand, my brother-in-law and I went through a six pack before a Ravens game before we knew it. Truly a one-of-a-kind hybrid between a drinkable macro and a complex, full bodied micro. Like on the Utz potato chips ad, people who can't get Yuengling are probably screaming, ""Why? Why?"" That is, if they know what they're missing."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very thin bodied. The beer is loaded with fizzy carbonation. The beer is highly quaffable and easy to drink. This beer is very inoffensive and could be a fairly boring session beer."
"Drinkablity is high on price exceptional in bottles. I did say at the bottle price, I thought it was too much, but now, I got a case of 15 22oz bombers for 18.99 and it's now my cheapie of choice for macro lagers."
"This is the BEST domestic lager in my opinion"
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I thought it would be just another macro's attempt at getting into the micro market with a bland beer that has a cool name, like Killians. Nope, not even close. The flavors, while not too complex, were excellent. If you ever find yourself in a market devoid of craft brew, search this one out."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a descent off-white head that retains well. The aroma is malt driven with notes of caramel and biscuit, there is also a slight floral hops presence. The flavor is similar with malty notes of caramel and biscuit, along with some floral and mineraly hops, and some slight fruity esters that are a bit uncharacteristic for a lager. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. A solid amber lager, drinkable and moderately complex."
"I've probably had more Yuengling than any other beer. Always a good backup beer or just to save some money"
"I've had it both straight from the bottle and also poured into a stein and neither impressed me much. It's an average looking lager if looks are important to you. A moderate amount of head, about a half inch, but it dissipates quickly with very little lacing. The nose is nice but nothing amazing. A bit sweet. The flavor is not my favorite. I understand American amber lagers aren't supposed to be bitter, but this just did not appeal to me at all. It's a sweet beer with a bit of hop flavor mixed in. It's like drinking a strange vegetable. A definite hoppy aftertaste. I'll finish the sixpack but I won't buy another. Not impressed."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink like a traditional beer should be and easy enough on the wallet. Reminds me of my college days in PSU."
"Drinkablity- good i would have had another but ran out of time...like i said before not my favorite or the best ive had but id drink it"
"Overall a tasty beer. Seems it could go well with lots of food, or used for a session. Not an incredible beer, but quite enjoyable."
"I remember when this first came out in Pennsylvania, I thought this was very good beer. Nõw lets transport to today and this beer really isn't that good. Far better than than the BMC macro swill but other than running to the Mobil Mart late at night for beer, I can think of a reason to buy this, but don't get me wrong I drink this on occasion and I'm not bothered by that."
"Compared to the competition, this beer is wonderful."
"This has become my fall back beer in Huntsville."
"D: Nice, light, and easy to drink. Prefered over BMC for esoteric reasons and for slightly bulked up taste."
"Picked up a six pack when I was in North Carolina. This is a solid amber lager - nothing to write home about, but not bad either. I put this on par with something like Shiner. Cheap if you are in the area, widely available, and a hell of a lot better than the BMC offerings it is usually surrounded by."
"A light copper color with hints of a golden hue. The aroma of bread and some spicy hops are the most prevalent scents. The taste starts with the malt, which give it a mild flavor, then a nice hop finish comes in, that lasts for some time. In the mouth it feels watery at the beginning and gain some weoght as it reaches the back of the palate. There is also a strong sensation of carbonation in every swallow. Drinkability, it is very easy to drink and is very refreshing. For me though, it is not something I would grab consistantly."
"What this beer really has going for it is its drinkability... definitely a solid session beer at a cheap price."
"This is a pretty nice beer. Even with a bigger than average for style feel it goes down quickly and smoothly. I'd easily drink this again if I'm ever in Pennsylvania."
"Like I said, it isn't a super amazing beer, but I can count on it to be an enjoyable beer and like all things in life sometimes tradition and pride are more important than the details."
"More on the beer: It looks good and smells good and can be used to compliment a meal, or in a game of beer pong. Really, this beer works as a good beer with friends, and a good beer to share."
"Pours a clear golden color. >1/2 inch head of medium to small bubbles. Aroma is grassy and earthy. Taste is clean and light. Flavor is somewhat sweet and then fades into a lightly bitter finish. For an American Macro Lager, Ill take it any day of the week. Very easy to drink. A good every day beer. A staple in my fridge in the summer. Very good for what it is. Much better than your average BMC."
"Not a strong taste, but enough there to appreciate its quality. I salute PA for making a pretty darn good beer."
"I was interested to drink this cause its very hard to acquire where I live. That turned out to be a good thing. This counts as a fizzy yellow beer. Bitter grain and slender amber malt. A little bitterness washed down with a kind of skunk sweetness. Not a whole lot to say about the lager. After looking and the meek color I already had a good feel for what it will taste like. The nose didnt give off much but a wiff of steel, almost like I had poured it out of a can, odd. You would think this being the oldest brewery in the nation, they would have picked up a few good ideas over the years."
"When you want a good tasting cheap beer this works. I prefer the Black & Tan to this. So I agree this is a beer to take out fishing, mowing the lawn, or washing your car. There's not a strong hop taste or smell. Amber coloring. A bit on the sweet side. Being from PA I have this fairly often and will continue to."
"Clear copper color, head fades fast. Smell is grainy and a little sweet. Taste is not that great. Too sweet, not enough hops (or much at all). A bland lager, one not worth the hype that most people get it. I prefer the second oldest brewery any day of the week."
"Pours an orange-tinged amber with a one finger head with little lacing. Little in the way of smell that I can detect... Flavor is a welcome change from the usual macro offerings. A little too sweet in the flavor department. Crisp lager finish. Mouthfeel is better than most macro lagers, but still a little thin. Leaves me wishing for more substance. That said, this is a good standby beer, especially in Florida where it's the same price as Bud."
"D - well, it's a step above your standard American macro lagers. Actually has a bit of body, malt presence. Tastes like the beer your grandaddy let you sip when you were a kid. Very much a 'lawnmower' beer. It's all over the Northeast US and deserves some credit for its longevity and body."
"Seems like a fairly typical AML, no real average qualities. Darn."
"I attend college in NY, so this stuff is everywhere on campus. Automatic points are given because this is the US's oldest brewery. When poured into a glass it looks alot like other US macro lagers, only a bit darker. There the smell hints towards citrusy hops and an apple like smell. flavor backs this up. Very flavorful for a US macro lager. leaves alittle bit of residue on the lips and teeth, not as clean as better brews. This beer is very affordable and is nice for a long night of drinking."
"Nice, slightly darker golden sort of color. Decent enough head at first pour. Ok aroma-sort of sulfury and just ""beer like"". Good malty flavor with a great hop bite to it. I am a huge Bud fan and this has the same great ""snap"" that I find in a Bud. Theres a nice grainy flavor going on as well. Good body for style. Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Seems to have a bit more ""umph"" then your standard US macro. I like it."
"Being from PA, Yuengling is my beer of choice when I'm out at the bar or if I just want to enjoy a nice lager at home. The color is amber/copper and the head was about average size and consistancy. The smell is a little bit creamy and hoppy with a nice malt aroma. The taste is similar with a slight creaminess with a normal amount of bitterness. For a lager the taste is full-bodied and finishes strong to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and not overly fizzy. I find Yuengling lager to be quite drinkable if you're in the mood for a well-brewed lager. If available in your area, this should be your first choice for a very reasonably priced lager."
"I'm a big fan of the Yuengling bros. Brewery so I drink what they got anytime I find my self in the situation. Nice fresh beer, maybe a half inch head that dissipated fairly quickly but did not entirely leave. beautiful medium color with not a lot of carbonation. the smell is bitter with no sign of sweetness. Tastes like it curled up on my tongue and gave me a hug. Smells like it looks."
"Poured a clear , golden-amber with a quarter inch head of off white foam that stayed. Smell is clean and mainly of the malt , hint of adjunct , slight metallic character. Taste is of the slightly sweet malt at first , kinda creamy , some grassy-citrus hop tinge , also a hint of metal. Mouthfeel is light but slightly creamy. One of my stand-by brews , sold at every convience store around my area , much better than most of the other macros in my opinion. A very drinkable American red/amber lager."
"from the tap at Parrot Key in Fort Meyers. poured a golden copper with a off white head. aroma, hard to tell had the aroma of the water coming in since this retaurant was near a marina that was near the gulf of mexico, malts, hops some sugar, grains. flavor the malts, came out pretty goodat first than dropped off as it warmed got some sourness, and a bite of hops at the finish. but did go well with my FRESH FLORIDA MAHI-MAHI sandwich I had"
"On a recent visit to Tampa every bar I went to had this on draft. I was told that Yuengling had a brewery in Tampa. Is this the only beer they brew? Anyway, it was an amber color with a thick white head and good lacing. It had a sweet, fresh corn odor, but not much taste. There was a little hops, but that was about it. Pretty average."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a small head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma was sweet and malty on the nose with a hint of corn adjunct. Taste was also sweet with a slight hop flavor. The beer was very smooth in the finish, but had that adjunct flavor that macros tend to have. I thought this beer was supposed to be all malt? It's a refreshing beer with a tad more flavor than BMC, but not much else. I don't understand all the hoopla behind this beer. I'm not gonna go out of my way to seek this out again. I'll stick with Yuengling porter instead."
"Cheers!"
"Had a pint on tap, this beer had a nice color for a lager, almost a copper color. The smell was typical for a macro type lager, tastes pretty decent, I'd rather drink this than most macros. It does have a little more sweetness than I'm used to though. Not bad for a lager, definitely worth a try."
"This is a good macro-brew. Not on the level of Sam Adams but the flavor may be more appealing to mainstream America than Sam as well. Although I prefer Sam Adams, this isn't a bad one to fall back on."
" Taste is not impressive. Decent amount of flavor, but I think I detect corn, or some other adjunct. Mouthfeel is smooth, moderate carbonation. I'll pass on having another one."
"Got a 12pk of these for $9.99. Appearance is copper in color with an OK head & no lacing to speak off. Smell is not the best -- a little sour and hints of fruit. The taste, however, is pretty good - has a little fruit coming out with some maltiness as well. It's a crisp beer, but not that bitter. Basically, for someone who feels Bud is a beer w/o a lot of flavor -- I'd recommend trying this instead. Drinkability is good, as I could easily spend a night drinking just these."
"It's certainly not BAD, just certainly not good either. The look is completely average. It has almost no smell, and tastes watered down and too bready."
"Pours a copper color with decent head. Not a very pleasent smell, mostly consists of citrus fruits and sour malts. The slight citrus scent carries over to the flavor where the citrus flavors mingle with the typical lager maltiness and finishes up with a bit of crisp hop bitterness. Not at all a bad brew, this is a good brew to have when you have a few friends over that are afriad to venture to far from macro brews."
"Drinkability-Its drinkable but so is water. Another hot summer day beer served very cold with a Salami sandwich and a White Owl cigar. That might work."
"Yuengling is a beer ill choose if im out and the other taps are all BMC. Thanks too a market blitz by yuengling in the last 3 years this stuff is everywhere in my area. Highly carbonated, with a golden-amber color, perfectly clear, decent head retention. Thin flavor, almost surprising, given the color, you might expect a little more body from this beer , too bad. Nothing really wrong with yuengling, it could just be better."
"This is a real easy-drinking beer and very refreshing when you need one. Yuengling Traditional Lager will always be my ""default beer."""
"Drinkability: Well, this is basically my fall back beer, so I have to give it high marks for that. But experience has shown me that having too many Yuengs can really fill you up, like no other beer I've ever had."
"This should have a huge drinkability score, but I just can't bring myself to it. Yeah, for a while I drank lots of this, but the last time I had some it just struck me as unpleasant to drink."
"Unimpressive head to start out and doesn't last but a few seconds. Probably leads to the lack of a convincing boquet, which sweeter and strangely echoes scents of mushrooms. Color is a solid golden amber color, which is probably its best feature. Carbonation is moderately tight. Taste is very grainy but worth your while. Leaves a warm morning-breath like feel in your mouth which is unpleasant, but little aftertaste. A good beer for relaxing with friends."
"Nice light amber color, but the head rapidly dissipated. The aroma is clean with a faint hint of caramel and graininess. The flavor is a bit subdued, featuring a touch of maltiness and some balancing hop bitterness but very little else in the way of flavor. The overall impression is dryness and a crisp blend of light malt and hops. Overall this is definitely a step up from the usual macroswill but its got a long way to go to deserve 'premium' or at least what I expect from 'premium'."
"This is my first review because this is my favorite beer. At this point, I know about where the quality of this brew is, which is good, but not superlative. (It does pass the only two quality tests I know of though. If you serve it warm, it still tastes fine, and there's not a beer I've ever tried that will make the taste of Yuengling Traditional suffer if you try them head to head) The reason why it still stands up as my favorite is because I've got moderate taste, and because this is my go-to beer. It is pretty good at everything in my opinion. You can use this as a session beer, you can drink it with food, you can drink it on a hot day. There's no time I can think of where you might want a beer where you could go wrong with Yuengling Traditional Lager. That said, I think its hard to beat the appearance in the green bottle (no problem with skunking for me since I live less than a day's drive from the brewery). The contrast of green bottle and dark lager is pleasing. Its head is not reliable, but reaches a respectable size when it does form and it does usually leave a bit of lacing. The smell is about what a beer should smell like. Yeasty and malty with some tang from the hops. Taste is more of the same. Malt and some noticable yeast. It tends more towards sweet than bitter, but there is little bitter there for balance. The most consistent ""notes"" I detect is a little grass and maybe a really faint bit of citrus. One of my favorite things about Yuengling Traditional Lager are the hops they use. I don't know the variety, but they are one of my favorites because they add an interesting and fairly complex flavor without excessive bitterness (something few beers do). For some reason the taste seems to be more pronounced in the bottle. The aroma and more suble taste aspects of the hops can dissapate in a pint glass sometimes Also, I notice at least one person ahead of me said this has no ""adjunct"" ingredients. I'm not sure this is true. If there are added ""adjuncts", sure they're low on the list, and definately there's no rice, but I suspect there may be some corn in here. Though that may just be the yeast and hops messing with me because the corn is another thing I can only seem to get from the bottle. Anyway, the mouthfeel... pretty medium (surprise!). This is also a plus for me. Its heavy enough so that I know I'm drinking a real beer, but it still slides down easy. For this reason drinkability gets a really high rating. Between the consistently pleasant taste, and the not too heavy feel, Yuengling Traditional Lager goes down really easy. As I try new beers, the chances I'll order one of these has decreased some, I do like variety. But in the end this is still my favorite. And I think its a testament to the good taste of the area I live in that Yuengling Traditional is almost as common around here as Bud/Miller/Coors. Its about the same price besides. Its certainly hard to beat in that respect."
"A great bargain as well, compared to other American Lagers."
"....i've been informed by one of the more aggressive beer nerds that beer in cans do not skunk. yeah, ok. but it does lose its flavor fairly quickly in my experience after short term storage and becomes very corona-like, despite it not coming into contact with any light. dont age it is the point."
"It pours a light amber color with almost no head. The aroma has that distinct American lager yeasty aroma with notes of malt in the background. The flavor is mild matliness with a slight caramel accent and mild noble hops balancing things out reasonably well. The mouthfeel is pretty good and the carbonation is fine and tight. Served cold, this beer makes a good thirst quencher."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly but on the watery, thin side. Quite drinkable I'd say- doesn't taste horrible, warms up alright, light and simple. A good brew for a hot day."
"Poured into an american pint glass. It poured a dark copper that was bright and inviting. The head was about and inch but it was gone rather quickly. The aroma carried strong maltiness to it and some smokiness that was very inviting. It was a very full beer without being too dry and when it left the mouth it left a nice malty taste but it wasnt overwhelming. Over all better than i expected and i beer i would definatley try from now on."
"This beer was low end for the style. I had it on tap at Ham's yesterday. The color was a dark red. The smell was kindly spicey. The taste was not what I was expecting. It had the taste of a macro but something was just wrong. The mouthfeel was pretty harsh. It had quite a bit of bite. Not a beer I would order often. Not even when they are $1.50 a pint."
"Clear and golden in color. Slight head that doesnt stick around long. Good carbonation. Sweet yet crisp smell. Well balanced. Light and easy drinking. A good, standard, inexpensive lager. Easily able to drink a couple at a time. I must say that I prefer draft over bottle. I consider the Yuengling Lager a baseline beer. It is my average beer."
"Yuengling is brewing some good stuff here. Poured out to a deep golden amber color with a short lived head. Medium level of carbonation. Minor notes of lace. Aroma was very weak, but hints of hops and grain were present. Taste was a full step up from anything BMC could ever kick out; flavors of mild malt, salty grains, corn and hops were very enjoyable. Mouthfeel was decent, with the carbonation again making the brew brisk and refreshing. Good drinkability; I can now see why many are die-hards when it comes to this breweries beers. Recommended. Special thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the sample."
"Pours a Dark Honey color with good clarity. One finger of dense head with decent retention that will leave light lacing. Clean nose, just some light pale malt aromas. Toasted pilsener malt flavor, balanced nicely with some grassy hops that will remain throughout the aftertaste. High carbonation and a light body smooth the mouthfeel, which is rather crisp. The finish is hoppy bitter and slightly dry, but nothing that would hinder the drinkability."
"Cheers."
"A very nice local brew. Has a good amber color. Has nice foamy head and a lot of carbonation, a little too much if you ask me. Yet a very nice, smooth and drinkable beer. The taste varies depending on how you have it. The cans hav a little aluminum taste. The draft has a darker color, yet smoother taste than the bottles. The bottled beer gets warm kinda quick and warm Yuengling Lager is not a pleasing taste. The draft doesn't warm as fast as bottles, but it warms it is not that bad. Still a pleasing taste. Overall a very good beer. In my experience, as well as some of my friends, some bars have difficulties chilling the bottles. Every now and then one of us will get a skunked bottle."
"-UF"
"This brew pours to a light amber color with a nice sized head that breaks down quickly leaving a faint amount of lacing at the top of the glass and then nothing the rest of the way. Looks to have a lot of carbonation in it and the aromas seem to be slightly skunky but not overly with some malt like characteristics. I do not notice any real definable hop scents. The taste is pretty basic, which is not really a bad thing. Mostly malt flavor, somewhat bready with a slight hop taste. Very carbonated brew, I would think it would be a fair lawn mowing brew."
"Reviewed a bottle of this and found it slightly more interesting. The bottled version had a bit of complexity to the smell, but was pretty average, otherwise. On-tap, it seemed 100% macrobrewed, despite the fact that it is a small town brewery with low-medium production level. I'll choose it over the true macro brews out of respect for the smalltown tradition, but will avoid if I have a decent choice of micros."
"I can drink about three of these at a sitting, but that's about it. A very good beer, perfect with pizza or a burger."
"I moved from Minnesota to Philly and all I hear was wait till you try Yuengling! I had some pretty high hopes for this one. Boy, was I disappointed. It was no better than Leinenkugel Lager, or Schells Lager. Its a bit better than the slew of American macro brews, but not by much. Theres more nostalgia here than quality. It pours a nice golden color and has a flat head that sticks around for a while. But the taste is pretty lifeless. Its clearly corny with an awkward sourness that's followed up by a dirty dryness. I get the impression that it's catering to the lowest common denominator of beer drinkers. I guess I shouldn't be too suprised. It isnt really bad, but nothing really stands up and asserts itself here. The mouth feel was all right and. Boring!"
"Enjoyable, inexpensive, and increasingly available outside of PA."
"Poured a copper color with a 1 inch head of white foam and plenty of carbonation bubbles raising to the top of the glass. The best way I can describe the smell is, malt wrapped around the aroma of burnt hair. Maybe not burnt hair, but something to do with hair. Not pleasant. The taste was nothing too special, but it is more flavorful than the average macro. This is another one that the mouthfeel was too light and watery for me. This beer would make an excellent choice for a nice affordable easy to drink session beer. It's too bad they don't sell this beer in Ohio because I might like another one."
"Overall: If you're looking for outstanding style and regal elegance, look elsewhere, if you're looking for a great beer to drink at your block party grab a few cases."
"Notes: below average brew"
"Drinkability... although I don't like lagers in general, this one was above par. Not striking, but a good solid 3.5. I'd have this again as a session beer if it were offered."
"May pick up a few more this afternoon."
"Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head and OK lace. Aroma of light malt with light hops. Smells light and clean. Taste is good for a macro. A clean and crisp light malt with a slight hop flavor and bitterness - leans more towards the malt side. Not the typical rice flavor that you get from other macros. Overall a good macro, much better than BMC and I usually keep a twelve pack in the fridge. Not a great beer but still decent quality enough for most BA's."
"Yuengling Traditional Lager is one of my favorites. At home, I usually alternate between this, Sam Adams Boston Lager and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It is available at most bars in Tidewater Virginia, sometimes priced the same as Bud and Coors. Yuengling has a great amber color, with a small, off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Leaves a little lacing on the glass. Smell is good. Taste is nicely balanced, not too sweet, good flavor and not a whole lot of bitterness. There is no unusual aftertaste. Drinkability is very good. I would not belt it down as fast as Bud or Coors Light, since I enjoy the flavor too much. But it is a good session beer as well as a good beer to savor and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Easy on the palate without being bland. Excellent session beer."
"Poured from a can into a straight sided pint. Grainy with a bit of floral hop aroma. That may be a strech. No problems with the appearance. Exactly as it should be pale/straw with a thin cap of snow white head. No real hop flavor or bitterness at all. Not much bitterness to speak of either. Just grainy. Med bodied with lively CO2 rolls through the mouth. Very drying. Pretty much exactly what youd expect from the style. Id chose Yuengling any day over the big boys."
"Yuengling Traditional Lager's drinkability is solid and reliablye good. As I said above, a good standby beer for barbecues or just chillin at home."
"Always my fall-back beer when I'm not in the mood for a micro, I can, with a clear conscience, enjoy a Lager and know that I am not in the grasp of the ""evil"" macro-brewers."
"Pours an interesting amber color, slight head that vanishes soon. Aroma is slightly hoppy and bready. Taste is carmelly sweet up front, with hops in the mid to finish taste. Good for an American macrotype lager. Mouthfeel is actually kinda harsh. Perhaps overcarbonated to my tastes. Very drinkable and enjoyable on a hot day."
"I'm sure I'm biased on this beer, being that I'm from philly, but I've never seen a more beautiful beer in my ridiculously experienced 20 years. Everything about this beer says traditional american lager to me. It's basically pre prohibition american lager. This is before Satan peed in our beer and left us with that feminized swill we call coors, budweiser, or miller, or any other ""American Lager."" The Yuengling brewrey has the longest history of any brewrey still in buisiness and is still centered in a Pennsylavania coal town. This beer is so awsome I want to cry. And right now, i'm so full of yuengling that my tears would taste like it!!! DELAWARE VALLEY PRIDE! center of the universe."
"Some nice floral hops in the nose with traces of biscuit malt. A little darker than a typical macro with a rocky white head. Taste is clean and includes a nice balaance of biscuity malt and floral hops with some fruity highlights. Drinkable on a hot day? Yup!"
"Drinkability: I guess this is up there with the beers that I could drink a lot of, but I wouldn't pay for it, and I wouldn't go out of my way for it. This used to be my go to beer, but I have drank a lot of beer since then and learned quite a bit."
"Drinkability - Would go well with a lot of foods. Not too powerful, leaving the option for another wide open. The acidic nature makes me want a nice porter though, not another yuengling."
"I'm a big fan of Yuengling. I moved to the mid-Atlantic in 1998, never having tried it before, and have been a fan ever since. Plus, it's such a solid alternative to so many of the bland and mass-produced American-style lagers out there. It's not a great beer, and there's no real aroma worth writing home about, but it is crisp and often refreshing. It won't impress too many knowledgeable beer drinkers, but I don't think it's trying to. It reminds me, in a sense, of Shiner Bock, which I used to drink lots of in Texas, although they don't taste a lot alike. They do, however, present themselves in an unpretentious and dependable manner. It isn't fancy, but it is credible."
"copper-reddish color with an initially sizable head that fell fast and disappeared. smelled musty, sort of like old leather. tasted mildy sweet with mellow malt and a faint metallic hop note that crept into the finish. crisp light-bodied mouthfeel. a solid, balanced lager that could be consumed for a whole night. nothing sticks out in particular but this brew isn't trying to be anything it's not. a decent utility beer for a palate that needs a break or just feels lazy."
"I wouldn't want to drink this all day long. It's not very interesting, nor is it thirst quenching. It's not a bad beer, there's just not much going on here."
"Thanks to Brent for hand-carrying this bottle from Washington DC to Moscow. The beer pours a clear light copper hue under a one finger light beige head that settles disappointingly quickly. The nose is full of sweet malt, with a hint of raspberry syrup. The mouth is quite light and very prickly. The tastebuds are met by mild malt, with minimal malt balance. There is a touch of tartness, which converts to a metallic finish that lingers into the aftertaste. Globetrotterette was so unimpressed that she let me finish her portion. Can't say I was any more smitten of this bland brew."
"Pours a clear golden amber body with a decent white head. Nice full malty aroma with a light sweetness to it. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, very refreshing. Good malty taste, with a only a hint of hops, just enough to make it balanced. For a mass produced lager, this is pretty good stuff, which is good because it's easy to find at most bars in the mid-atlantic region."
"Drink one if they're around, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"This is one of those beers to gateway individuals into craft brews. the amber tone and big head give this a nice appearance for starters. As you taste it you realize that its pretty good lager. Smooth mouthfeel; the flavor is not much to right home about but, I fine that's the case with most lagers compared with ales. It works well as a session beer."
" The taste, not strong but a sweet malted grian with a hint of citric hop to crisp things up. This classic combo makes for a very drinkable brew anytime with a meal. A real treat indeed when temps raise for summer stuff."
"I asked my dad to bring me back a Pennsylvania beer when he went to Philly, and this is what he gave me. Initially, I was disappointed because, though I knew this was America's oldest brewery, I guess I associated it with Iron City--a shitty micro-macro. This notion was dispelled when I poured it, as I was greeted by a gorgeous reddish-golden beer with dynamic bubble action. It smells slightly of chemically-coated plastic, but no matter. It tastes great, ridiculously smooth, very refreshing. Nothing especially interesting in the taste, nothing groundbreaking, just a very solid beer, very drinkable beer. I can see why this brewery stuck around."
"Maybe."
"It's ok, dog."
"This is one of the few beers I have every actually not finished (I drank 75% of the glass). I'm certainly not going to order this one again unless I get a taste of one that is better for some reason."
"Seeing the only place you can buy this beer is in PA( it can be bought in NJ & NY also as far as i know), a buddy brought up a 6-pack. This is by far the poor mans Sam Adams and a rich mans Bud.. It has a pale golden hue to it. The head is a sea-foam white. It goes down quick and smooth, with no hint of a after taste. You can drink a 6-pack and not even know it. It will give you a good, quick buzz so be careful. But this is a good beer to have in the summer time when you are firing up the grill. Smooth and refreshing!"
"Had this from a bottle at a restaurant which was lacking in selection. Golden amber with a thin head that disappeared quickly, no lacing, and lots of carbonation bubbles. Nose is almost non-existant, with just the fatest trace of malts coming through. Taste is more of the same, a washed out maltiness, maybe a little caramel, nasty astringent aftertaste. Body is thin and the beer is overcarbonated. It's been a long time since I've had one of these, and now I can see why."
"Generally overrated, I feel, but not a bad beer."
"I had this beer in Altoona,PA and it was one of the biggest seller in the PA beer market. Now I understand why. I had it on tap, then in bottle. On tap, it pours a beautiful golden honey brown colour with a white foamy head changing very quickly to laces. It lacks smell, but its taste buys back for the lack of smell. It got lot of savour. It tastes like sort of honey beer. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but it is fun enough to be enjoyed. Overall, it was a pretty good beer on tap. In bottle, it was more average as product. I don't know why, but at least, it was much better than BMC macros."
"Surprisingly quaffable, for a macro lager, especially at the end of a hot day, with few beer choices at an official function. Assertive carbonation, medium mouthfeel. A tad of hops, more malt, and sweet and dry finish. Bit of yeast flavour translated as lemon."
"Beer pours a nice amber color with a good amount bubbles and head. IT has a little of that Euro-Sewer smell but not too bad. Not too much to talk about inteh flavor department but it is a little sweet. The mouthfeel is watery and bubbly yet smooth. Considering it is a macro it isn't that bad though. It does what a beer in this price range should do; go down easy and refresh."
"Beer pours a dark straw color with lots of head and lots of effervescent bubbling going on. Due to the green glass bottle instead of a brown bottle, I think maybe so light reactions occur with this beer, giving it a slight skunk odor/ taste. These smells and odors are not bad though. There are definitely worse offenders out there. With that being said, this is still a good, light, refreshing beer with some nice hop aroma and malt balance. I think it is a good beer for the price, and in my experiences, a much better beer in the bottle than on draft."
"Not the most complex of beers, but definitely head and shoulders above a lot of the mass produced American Lagers that Yuengling sits next to in your groceries beer aisle."
"Fairly light body that relies on carbonation to make it feel fuller. Not a beer I'd ever seek out. Still this is a step above the major macros. Why the hell do they have to use a green bottle?? Thanks to kmpitz2 for hooking me up with this one."
"And I can think of nothing more to say."
"I drink this a lot, I have to admit. Being in Richmond, there are porch days when craft beers don't fit the bill, and this is one of the classics I always go to. I know Yuengling can get a lot of flack, but for a beer on the cheaper side that isn't necessarily yellow swill, this is what I look to."
"Pours a very clear medium gold color. Hardly any head, but a ring of white bubbles persists. Carbonation level is good. No malt aroma. Slight hop aroma. Sweet corn aroma. Favor is crisp, ""bready", and finishes a bit sweet. Beer is well balanced, but tips the scales slightly on the bitter side. I'd say this beer fits better in the Premium American Lager category competing against the likes of Michelob. This is a decent beer, and would be refreshing on a hot day after mowing the lawn."
"Beautiful amber/red color with a decent white head... instantly recognizable in these parts. Malty aroma with some sweetness and earthiness. Sweet, yeasty taste with ample carbonation and almost no hops. Good body and mouthfeel... syrupy, but not heavy. Amazingly drinkable with almost no aftertaste, especially when tapped. Overall, a superior product and one of the biggest benefits of living in eastern PA."
"Taste is crisp and smooth, with no bitterness. The malts are high-quality, and the taste reflects that. A bit more body then a macro, and that lager flavor is perfectly balanced in the beer. Not a whole lot of depth, though, but I guess that cannot be expected in an American lager. A good beer to drink during a summer barbeque with friends. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and smooth. Very easy to drink. Especially to one like myself who is used to Arrogant Bastard and Raison D'etre."
"This is a truly classic American beer. An obvious interpretation of the classic European pre-pilsner lager style beers(Yuengling has been in business since 1829, 13 years before the pilsner style first appeared), it has a feel that the big megabrewers simply have been unable to capture. My only disappointment with Yuengling is that it's not available in Illinois."
"Drinkability: I can put these down. I will say this though, after a couple of them they start to taste boring, but that's never stopped me"
"The upside is that the bottle is easy to drain and the strong carbonation makes for a refreshing feel. If the flavour were more interesting I would have been happy to drink many more..."
"What can you say. Its a good straightforward drink with a sandwich or buddy beer. Nice slightly orange-gold color, crisp & light from start to finish with a hint of hops and some sweetness. Perhaps a little lacking/flat in the body department, but it is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. This has got to be one of the higher end larger volume lagers available, and if you get a chance to try it, while it won't blow you away, you won't be disappointed...especially under $20/case for longnecks."
"Can't believe it's taken me this long to try my first Yuengling brew. Pours a light amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma seems to be a mix of corn and caramel malt. The flavor is very clean. Sweet caramel that finishes smoothly. Much more flavor than most lagers in the family. Nice beer here."
"A nice enjoyable lager here!"
"Clear amber colored with a thin lace white head. Smells clean with a grainy corn aroma. Has a meduim to thin mouthfeel with active carbonation that kind of sizzles on the tongue. Taste sweet with some malts and little cooked corn. Lighty hopped clean aftertaste. Over all I think this is a tasty lager. Nothing big just a great session drinker at a very reasonable price."
"Nice amber color on this beer with a medium white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is citric and corny. Taste comes off that way as well. It's on the sweet side with a corn syrup like sweetness and nice base of grains and yeast flavor. Hops are very mild but finish off the beer nicely. This really reminds me of High Life expect with a creamier, more substantial body. A great cheap drinking beer."
"The beer pours a nice solid copper color with a 2 finger head that doesn't seen to want to leave. The nose is slightly honey touched caramel. This smells really nice. The flavor is rather full, with a sweet honey caramel mix that moves to a really crisp just ever so slightly grainey finish. The feel is moderate to thick, with a really nice carbonation. This beer is very nice. Refreshing and full of flavor. How nice."
"Pours out amber with a big frothy white head that leaves a surprising amount of lace. Smell is sort of understated; there's some malt in there and a little off note that's somewhat metallic. Tastes like ""lager!"" Sweet malt hits you pretty hard, but it gives way to a very faint hop bitterness and a sort of nutty finish. My only real complaint is that the mouthfeel is a little thin even for the style. Overall, you really can't beat this one for the money; it's way too cheap to be this good and blows everything else at comparable prices flat out of the water. One of my favorite things about living in Philly is that you can always just ask for a lager and get a cheap, decent pint."
"Well, I must confess this is the first time I've ever had Yuengling, and I know very little about it. So I was delightfully surprised when I poured this into the glass and it was a light amber color with a solid white head. The aroma was nice sweet caramel, and nutty as it warmed, with a bready yeast aroma that bordered on a bock yeast aroma. The flavor was clean, not overly bitter, with caramel malt and toasted bread giving way to a yeasty aftertaste. The beer had plenty of body for the style, and it was clearly the best beer I had on this little trip to Florida."
"Pours nicely with a thin lace and beautiful amber color. The smell is fairly non-descript and the flavour is too, almost a doughy taste with metallic tinges, although unoffensive. It is a solid beer and hence very drinkable. Around here this is about as cheap as water so there's no decision to be made when you want an refreshing and lazy summer day brew."
"Amber with a faint white head. The nose is slightly sweet, perhaps a bit cherryish, but otherwise not really distinctive. A slight hoppiness works to tone down the sweetness of the flavor, which is also not especially noteworthy. A crisp mouthfeel makes this beer drinkable."
"Drinkability - One could definitely drink this all night long. It's also cheap as hell for a 12 pack, somewhere in the $8 range. Choosing this over similarly priced beer is a no-brainer. Probably the best bang for your buck beer you can get. Definitely buy and consume many of these brews."
"Notes: This has always been a popular one with my family. I can see why: it's cheap, and non-offensive. This beer is simple goodness, but by no means a standout."
"Besides Sam Adams, this is the best session beer you can find available in most places in the area. Will always beat BMC, Heineken, or Newcastle. Great balance of hops, refreshing taste, and one of the easiest to drink."
"This lager is a medium-dark copper color with a white, foamy, fully-diminishing head and some light lacing. Aroma is very mild, light hops, a hint of malts and little bit of yeast. Taste is a little bland, slightly bitter with a short-lived, bready finish. Easy to drink because theres nothing much to it, but it sure is better than anything else offered on tap at Olive Garden (Bud, Bud Light and Coors Light). Dont get me wrong. It is a good beer when you match quality with cost, and its a great beer to start your friends out on when you trying to get them away from the aforementioned macros. And its good for when you come in from mowing the lawn when its ninety degrees and humid out, and all you want to do it pound a really cold one."
"I'm too poor to afford cheap micros and imports as everyday beers, so this is my everyday beer. Really, if I were a richer man, I'd probably still be drinking Yuengling, for BBQ's, lawn mowing, fishing, or just watching movies with friends, it's perfect for all those."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. Pours an amber/orange color with a 1 finger head and almost no lacing. Has a metallic scent accompanied by grains and hops in the background. It has a crisp carbonation and the taste is malt and grains with a slight hop twang. Mouthfeel is good, and goes down smooth. Has a high drinkability - you can almost pound it like you would a light macro lager. The only reason it loses points on drinkability is that it fills you up quickly. The thing about Yuengling is sometimes you get a skunked batch (light-strunk green bottles is my guess), which I think was the case in this review. Go for the 12-pack or a 22 oz. (which has brown glass) rather than the 6-pack to avoid this. The unskunked has more hop flavor and better mouthfeel. Regardless, it always has been one of my favorite lagers, and for the price (as cheap or cheaper than Budweiser bottles) you won't find much better of any style. Great session beer."
"Living in PA is a plus since most batches delivered are bottled the same day."
"Taste is again very lightly fruity mixed with the grassy malt. Biscuity with perceptable hops in the finish. Lightly sweet and a tad sticky in the mouth. Creamy and smooth. An easy drinking, sit-back-and-watch-the-game beer. An old favorite and standby."
"I like the light amber appearance of this lager. Lightly carbonated but still many bubbles floating to the top of the glass. OK mouthfeel with small laces clinging to the sides of the glass. It looks very good for a cheap american lager. The taste is a bit on the strange side. I think it is a little sweet and could use a little more hops for my taste. Because of the sweetness, I can't drink too many of these at one session. It's better than Miller or Bud, but not on my list if I have Microbrews or Homebrews around. The girls love it, probably due to sweetness. So, there is some real value to have it around at parties!"
"A light to medium amber colored beer with a thin white head. Everything about the beer is very safe and comfortable to me. Part of it is because I grew up drinking it in large quantities, but part of it is because it is a verstile, well rounded, smooth mouthfeel beer suitable for summer days while mowing the lawn or for winter nights while hanging out with freinds and playing poker. Sometimes I get bottles that have a skunky taste but not tonight. Sweet maltiness, light fruitness, and a dry, clean finish."
"I have ran into Yuengling Traditional Lager many times in my days. Poured a nice rich amber color with decent head that fell within minutes. The smell is somewhat sweet and a little bit malty. You can taste the grains in this one with a nice hoppy bite at the finish. Crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is decent, with a nice carbonation and medium body. As for the drinkability, as I have previously stated, I have ran into this beer many times, and predict that I will do so many more times in the future."
"First sip reveals average carbonation and average body, maybe even a little lite. Flavor is clean and crisp with some grainy malt providing a bit of caramel sweetness as well. The beer is amazingly easy to drink and goes down very smooth. Not very interesting but certainly nice on a hot day or when just drinkin brews while watchin football. Definitely better than big 3 lagers."
"The good points about this beer is that it is cheap, easily found in the extended Philadelphia area, and drinkable if needed."
"Pours light amber, almost watery. Smells like old hops and alcohol, a little skunky. Taste was a little hoppy with some wheat notes. Surprisingly light and almost refreshing. I'd drink it at a BBQ or something."
"Overall-a fine American lager, not that many amber characteristics but it's smooth and crisp. Definitely would be refreshing on a hot summer day. Just below Sam Adams for me but it's above a great many other beers in it's category, give it a try."
"This is a very smooth lighter lager. A nice crisp taste that goes down very easy. I enjoyed drinking this beer for a first time. I would defenitely try it again. It has a light amber color with a perfect amount of carbonation. This is one of the better beers to sit around and relax with friends."
"I do enjoy this and will drink it again, most likely when options are thin"
"I'm just not wild about lagers but this is one of the best I've had. Plenty of taste with no ""off"" or harsh flavors."
"A solid brew....Pours a light yellow amber with a head that dissipates quickly. Smell is a decent malty nose with some light hop elements. Taste is mainly sweet and malty, with a light hop finish. Mouthfeel is chewy, medium with a slickness that finishes in a dryness. Easy enough on the drinkability scale."
"This is a very sought after beer here. The store owners always complain that it is in such high demand, yet they are unable to have it distributed to them. I agree that it is a good beer, but like the gentleman before me suggests, it is in limbo between macro and micro beers. It does have a very pleasant taste, and virtually no aftertaste. It is reasonable priced as well. I do wish it was available around me, as it is a treat to get when I can."
"Amber bodied with a beige-ish head. Smells like malts and hops but a bit of yeast. Personally, I think this beer tastes pretty awful. Granted, it's not as bad MBC beers, but I think this beer out of the bottle tastes below average. Couldn't tell you why but I think it tastes much better out of a can. I seem to be the only person around here who doesn't like it. Mouthfeel is dry and light. And for me, this is just not a drinkable beer based on the fact that I don't enjoy the flavor. My advice - go grab a Yuengling Porter, not this."
"Poured lighter than I thought it would quite a bit of carbonation that settled down fairly quickly leaving a nice bit of lacework. Toasted malts in the nose. Pleasant aroma. Just slightly malty to start, before striking a perfect balance between malt and hops. A light bodied beer with a smooth mouthfeel that is very easy to drink. The finish is nice and dry for a cheaper lager. Too many cheap lagers finish slick and sweet. A pleasant tartness also surfaces after the finish. A light, very easy drinkin' and pleasant lager."
"I was suprised that I had not ever heard of this beer before I went to college. At one point one of my roomates showed up with a 18 pack of cans. Neither I nor any of my friends had ever tried this stuff, but Im not one to turn down a beer so I went for it. When poured it was a nice reddish orange color. Had a somewhat caramel color head which dissappared rather quickly. Excellent flavor, best American beer that I have had thus far. Price was pretty good also, which supprised me for the flavor that it had."
"Edit: I hadn't had Yuengling in a while. It is a good beer, still my fall back, but after trying so many others it doesn't compare as well. I wish for taste there was a 3.75 option, because some of my 4's are significantly better and some 3.5s are worse than this."
"Bottomline: I've virtually always had it on tap from pitchers, and its been pretty constant. If you want a dirt-cheap beer that's not offensive, get this. It's oh-so drinkable; the quintessence of what a session beer should be when you're hitting the bars (or playing quizzo in Phillie)"
"Pours the colour of Iced Tea. Minimal head. Aroma is not much maybe a bit of caramel bread, but thats pushing it. Taste is smooth. More malty than most Macros. Sweet taste with just a tough of dryness at the finish.. Very easy drinking. Not very carbonated. Sweetnes cuts the drinkability, However for a macro its the same price as BUD and so much better!!"
"Now I ask you, I'm supposed to be impressed by Yuengling because of what?"
"I was raised in the town this beer is brewed and ever since they started making this Lager, their production has increased by more than 10 times. This is an excellent lager with a great taste. A little heavy - don't want to drink this on a full stomach, but very refreshing on a hot day. If on the East Coast, you got to give this one a try. Take the brewery tour if local - get free samples of all their brands! This truly is a world class beer!"
"This has become a very popular beer around here. So every bar and restaraunt has it. Pours a nice amber color with a small off white head that disappears quickly. Smell is sweet malt. Taste is good. Malty and slightly sweet with not nuch else going on. Very drinkable in that it tastes good and goes down easy. Great beer for the all day picnic. It is also nice to know that it is always there for you, even in those bar that only carry macro crap beers."
"Presented in a huge 24oz? Shaker glass. Beige 1/4"" head, which had little retention and laced okay, over a copper brew. Aroma a somewhat generic pale malt/hops aroma. Taste is reasonably well-balanced, with good mouthfeel. Drinkability was very good, with high sessionability. A pleasant and enjoyable lager."
"This beer is nice to have when youre on a diet of primarily busch and coors light. But given that typical diet, its also hard to review this beer with a pallate that is so out of shape, as it were, but here goes anwyay. Its appearnce is a rather muted brown color, with very little lustre to it. The carbonation bubbles are huge, and the head is almost non existant, leaving no lace or ring. The smell is all that typical lager yeast and wheat smell. Reminds me alot of the saranac lager actually. The taste is not offensive, but theres not a whole lot to it either. Definatley the wheats again with a hint of yeasts but not much hops to be had. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. I guess Im predisposed against lagers, because Im a huge hop-head, but all in all, this isnt actually that bad."
"Since Yuengling is still unavailable in Massachusetts, I make sure to get my fill of it when i visit my friends and family in New Jersey. Whether you find this beer average or highly enjoyable, it is still one of the best bangs for your buck in the tri-state area. 16 bucks for a case at the local liquor store here in Fair Lawn, NJ. I'm bringing back at least 2 cases of it for me and my roommates in Boston."
"What do you drink when you go to a restaurant, and there's not much choice other than the same old, same old. This was an amber/red beer. Tiny head. Disapated before I could drink it. More carbonation than I think it needed. Nothing that I could really smell, but what do I know? I prefer dark and stout. This was neither, and they had neither. It tasted a lot like beer. Hoppy, grainy, and slightly bitter. Did I think it was drinkable? Yeah, it was beer. I would have rather enjoyed a good craft brew, but this is what my choice was. It was just as it was scored, average, and I wasn't impressed."
"Final Thought: This is one of my favorite mini-macro beers in America, especially for the price-to-quality ratio!"
"Thanx to Katie for providing the goods."
"I didn't have high hopes for Yuengling Traditional Lager, but I was sort of curious to see what 'America's Oldest Brewery' has to offer. If anyone offers this beer to me in the future, I'll politely decline."
"On draught at the Rex Theatre in Pittsburgh. Not a bad concert beer. Copper colored with a thin white head, very little lacing. Light aroma of hops with a hint of malt, but I really had to bury my nose to get it. Light-bodied and just as drinkable and smooth as the bottled version. Flavors of hops and malt are muted, and the finish is smooth and lightly bitter. Not a lot going on but I can see why this is featured so much in the region."
"A great beer. Goes down smooth and tastes great. For the price you'll be hard pressed to find a better lager for hangin' with the guys. One of the best American lagers on the market that you don't have to go out of your way to get. I can't think of a better beer to get if I have nine bucks to my name and a night of poker with the guys to kill."
"D&N: For a macro, this one's not bad at all. I picked up a twelve pack to take to my skydiving pals, and this seems to be a good choice for that. Relatively cheap, widely available, and way better than Bud. Perfect picnic fodder when you just want to have a beer without having to scribble down notes for a review."
"A bomber with a twist-off cap? Orangey amber color with columns of bubbles rising quickly to the top. A light beige, thick head rises up 2 inches high and drops down quickly. Aroma is malty, a bit grapey, slightly pungent with some lemon undertones. Mouthfeel is light and tingly, crisp and dry, giving way to flavors of malt, with hints of pear and honey. Not much more complex than that, and I might be dreaming the pear and honey."
"A 22 OZ bottle. A fine looking slightly deep looking amber: nice coloration. The head was white and plentiful on the initial pouring. The head did not last long. The taste is slightly on the sweet side. There is a crsip finish-justs as desrribed by the brewer. This is an easy to find beer and highly drinkable."
"This beer, like most lagers that I have experienced, is much better on draft than it is in the bottle. This beer was a rich/amber color with a thin white head. The smell was a nice mix of malts and hops with nothing really standing out either way. The taste was extremely sweet but, as with the aroma, nothing really stands out. The malt sweetness was a tad bit overwhelming as there really was little, if any, trace of the hops bitterness. The moderate carbonation made this pleasing to the mouth and the drinkability high. Unfortunately, as a whole, this beer is just about average and there was nothing really drawing about it."
"On to the review. The appearance was good in my opinion. Dark amber, clear, nice foamy white head that clung to the glass. I admit it looked good. The smell was grainy/herby, slightly big macro like. Although I did detect a bit of hops in there, overall not bad. The taste was grainy as well. This is not my favorite type of beer taste at all. Big emphases on the grains, not too much happening in the hop department. Again, like the smell, there was an herby earthy quality in there. The mouthfeel was ok, a bit thin for my taste, but again overall not horrible. I gave it a 4 on drinkability as it was very easy drinking. Although it may seem like I panned this brew, overall it was not bad. I would certainly take it over any macro (except maybe Sam Adams), and it certainly is on par with beers like Bass Ale. A good session brew at a price you can't beat. Certainly in the upper quality echelon of domestic macro's."
"This beer offers a good taste, nothing super but nice. The aroma is lacking, not very hoppy. Very drinkable IMO. And cheap too, only $9-10 bucks a twelve pack, depending on where you live."
"rich amber with a quickly disappearing head. nice grainy lager smell not skunky at all. the taste is grainy with a little bit of hops to round things out. close to medium mouthfeel, no complaints. i think this is an A+ for it's american lager style. i can safely say i haven't had better as far as that's concerned. it blows bud out of the water, but at the same time it is just an american lager."
"Pours a clear, amber gold, with a five second head that leaves a slim ring of light lace. Aroma is subdued, with sweet caramel malt and a hint of grassy hops. Mouthfeel is all about the carbonation. Light to medium bodied, and feels like an American mainsteam lager. Taste is somewhat grainy, sweet malt, and a hint of grassy hops. A solid American lager, smooth and very drinkable. I'm impressed that this does not taste watered down, at all. Excellent alternative to anything by the big macros."
"Lager has become the beer most found in the local pubs around Philadelphia, except of course for the Bud family. It is an acceptable beer for almost everyone. A very safe alternative to take with you anywhere. It pours a really nice amber, slightly hazy with a thin head and a little lacing. The flavor is straight forward malt and other grains with a hint of the alcohol present. It is nicely carbonated without having the bubbles of a soda pop. I like the simple taste of a lager. It is very good cold, okay a little warmer, and even okay ice cold. The taste is one of grain, hops, and alcohol with a good, slightly thick mouthfeel. It is really easy to drink a lot of these. The alcohol content is low enough to not penalize knocking back more than a couple."
"The lager poured a light gold with a thin white head. It smelled of malt and hops with a light spicieness. This beer had a nice bright taste with plenty of hops and traces of spice. It felt light and somewhat dry in the mouth. As American mass produced beers go Yuengling is one of the best. This is a beer that I'm glad to see available in bars, so that I'm not forced into drinking some of the more popular yet lest palatable brews."
"The beer pours out a light coppery color with decent head. The smell is nothing to write home about but if you are in most local bars, this is the beer to get. I drink this beer just about every week when I go to the bar around my house. Its a lot better than the other ""popular"" macros like Bud, Coors, or Miller. This beer goes down very smooth and is a great beer to have with some friends while watching a game at your local sports bar and having some buffalo wings. A ""gourmet"" beer it is not, but it certainly serves its purpose, being a good drinkable beer when you go out with some friends."
"This one is my current standby for dirt cheap, easily available American beer. Quite drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a spotty lace head. The aroma is decent. It is full of pale lager, and light crystal malts. The taste is good. It is a malty lager with a dry finish. It has a simple goodness to it. Yuengling likes to keep it basic, but it seems to work for them. Their whole line of beers are good, but most are very simple recipes. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks very well; a fine lager from America's Oldest Brewery."
"Pours a very pretty dark gold, moderate carbonation and head. Smell is actually somewhat funky to me, almost like stale beer, but also hoppy. A sweet beer, this brew is all right but nothing to write home about. A respectable lager, but by no means an outstanding one. I will drink this if given to me but I won't buy it."
"this beer is revered here in PA, and i guess it's because it is a local and distinguishes itself from a sea of macro clones. for what its worth, it is a a notch above the national swill, but not much more. i'll only drink it if there are absolutely no other choices."
"Cabbadgy nose, light amber in color. Minimal malt, minimal hops, watery. Prickly on the tongue in the finish. Not much to offer here. I'd put this a notch above the Macros, but not up to the level of the comparable brew in the Saranac line."
"Overall, not a bad cheapo beer. Probably your best amongst the miller, bud, coors, catagory."
"This was easily the beer I drank the most in college (at PSU), and with $4 pitchers of a beer which tastes millions of times better than any macro, it's easy to see why. It pours a good copper color, with a head that doesn't linger too long at all. There isn't much hop nose at all, however there is a slight malt/corn aroma. The taste is fairly light (do to the addition of the corn into the mash--which also makes this beer easy to drink). Overall it's a decent beer, and is my traditional back-up beer if the rest of the stuff they have on tap ends in Light."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light amber color with two fingers of head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is a good mix of malt and hops, with a grassy aroma as well. The taste is malty at first, a little bready in the middle, has a good bit of hops on the finish. A very well balanced taste. The mouthfeel is just a little light, but the drinkability is fantastic. A good well-rounded lager."
"(Green long neck twist off bottle)"
"I heard so much about this beer and finally decided to try it at a local pub. Light yellow in color. Not much of a head. I was disappointed with the taste. Very little hops. Not very complex. Seemed bland to me. The flavor was simply weak. I was expecting a lot more considering all the hype I had hear about this beer. Very drinkable though. I think this beer would be A LOT better consumed with food."
"Char"
"But it's still a lawnmower/Camden Yards-only beer."
"An appealing dark amber color does not disappoint on taste. Presents as caramel more so than butterscotch. Meduim carbonation lends itself to a very drinkable beer. This lager sets itself apart from many other mass-produced offerings. Body is medium and the hops are present but not over-stated. It offers a satisfying flavor that lasts all night long."
"The taste is fairly well balanced with no clear winner. I get hints of caramel then citrus with limited linger."
"Yes, the big strength is drinkability. It's light enough for several, should you be so inclined, and has enough flavor to let you know its a conscientious beer, brewed to go down smooth and well. Not the finest, of course, but a year-round staple, and safe for almost all palates. It's more enjoyable than any single quality on its own might suggest. It's a handy green bottle to have on hand. Drink it cold, drink it proud."
"Discovered this beer while on vacation last summer on the NC coast. Great German name and a cool label. Excellent appearance, with a thin head and maltly aroma. Outstanding beer at a price which is on par with the macobrew swill that everyone else drinks. Look forward to distribution in my area soon."
"Bottom line, when you reach for the cheap sixer--reach for this."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but not all that exciting. Enjoyable, but no need for me to seek this one out."
"This beer is just a lighweight, no nonsense lager that is consistently clean and clear.I tend to find a lot of girls like this beer and that's why I keep it stocked in my fridge."
"My mother often has Yuengling in bottles and I can remember trying it and not liking it. Tasted too bready for me from what I can recall. However, recently I was out at someone's house who had a keg of 'Lager', and unfortunately it was either that, Milwaukee's Best, or Seagram's 7, so I chose the Yuengling. It wasn't bready this time to me, but it tasted like it was artificially sweetened. I know it's a popular beer in this area but I don't drink it so I don't know if this is what it's supposed to taste like or if it's more like the bready taste out of the bottle that I remember. Anyway, It seemed a little flat, and almost too thick for the flavor, if that makes sense. I can see how it's popular though, given the alternatives of bud and the likes, because it does have flavor. It's just not my favorite flavor."
"Yuengling now has TV commercials complete with girls in bikinis, at least in the Philadelphia area, which doesn't seem quite necessary. A trip to the brewery is Pottsville is definitely worth the trip, although they're a little bit chinsy on the free samples I'd say."
"Experience must count for something, because ""America's Oldest Brewery"" could definitely teach the big three a few things about making a quality lager. It's darker than most, almost an amber. It's richer and fuller as well. Definitely a lager, but I don't think its as crisp as some...its just really smooth. I've had it each of the past four weeks for tailgating...great session brew."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 10SEP03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"The nose is light and quite lager-like with a nice malt sense being present. The flavor is full and quite enjoyable. A very session brew a nice crisp finish."
"Yuengling Traditional Lager tastes absolutely great. I had tasted Black and Tan before, but never the traditional lager. I must say it tastes great. There isn't a strong aftertaste, and it goes down very smoothly. It also has a great mouthfeel. I recommend Yuengling Traditional Lager to anybody."
"Overall Impression: Not bad. Wouldn’t drive the 2,000+ miles to go get some, but would buy some if it was local, just to keep a part of our beer history alive."
"This lager was light amber in color with a thin white head. Not much aroma was present, as some slight sweetness was barely noticeable. The flavor leans towards the malts, as the hop level is on the lighter side. The sweetness rides the tongue, but then does develop into a slight bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable as it is relatively light bodied and flavors are not overpowering."
"Best of luck against the bigger macros."
"This is a beer I forgot to try while in Virginia, but a coworker brought back his last visit to his hometown area near the Pennnsylvania border. It poured a nice reddish amber color and formed a foamy white head that disappeared fairly quickly and left some trace circular lace. A very small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and some malt with a very mild hint of caramel. The flavor was of malt and a hint of caramel and the body was fairly thin with a slight bittness and astrigency in the finish. As far as lager goes, for it's price, you can't go wrong with this beer."
"""America's oldest brewery"" suprisingly has resisted the urge to lighten up their flagship so it looks and taste more like megabrewed crap. Color is certainly amber, kicks up a frothy head. Sweet malty taste, almost roasty caramel, and trace of flavoring hops. Surprising yeast taste, may turn off some people. Could the big bottle have been old? Still, an interesting catch. Had the whole quart and 3 Lord Chesterfields and didn't feel a thing. A ""not great-not terrible"" beer."
"Sam Adams likes to say their Boston Lager returned America to flavorful beer, but these guys have been doing it for way longer. Being from Maryland, I have always been around Yuengling and I hope I always will be in the future. Talk about a session beer! Not only is this stuff cheap by comparison even to Macro-Swill, it is actually good! Pours a nice amber. Definite maple-sugar/syrup flavor to the beer, but its only a hint, not a defining characteristic. A bit of hops in the finish. Very good mouthfeel for a lager, leaves your mouth feeling full of beer, not water. I know people who say this is their favorite beer.... its not THAT good. But, I can't afford to keep the fridge stocked with Rochefort 6 and St. Bernardus, and this beer is an incredible bang for the buck. I frequently find it for $13.99 a case (bottles) in my area and I've heard its cheaper in PA."
"I popped the cap and was hit with a sweet aroma, nicely carbonated. I poured this darkish lager and watched the strong head form as I've done before. medium body not to dark, not to heavy a nice looking lager. The finish was a little sweet (for my taste), butt the aftertaste was the slightest bit bitter. Nice finish kind of balance the whole thing out. One of the best American lagers!!!"
"this is no longer the beer that i remember. not that is was ever anythign extravegant, yuengling seemingly used to be a fuller, more flavourful beer. now it's really just a step above the buds and coors' of the world, though i must add that yuengling's drinkability is tenfold better than any of those brews. it pours a slightly watery looking light amber with a nice amount of carbonation for a lager. taste, as i said, is a bit thinner than i remember, mostly standard malt and hop flavours here. nothing daring. there's a bit of earthiness as well. it can usually be found rather cheaply on tap and in stores, so if the money's tight, it's not a horrible choice, but for maybe a buck more for a 6 pack, there are tons of better brews to choose from."
"The beer is a little thin but has an obvious malt sweetness and an unexpected hop presence, although this is far from a hoppy beer. The mouthfeel is quite thin, nothing special here. However, the drinkability is very good. I can see having a few Yuengling's in one sitting but I wouldn't think it would be good with food. At the end of the day, it's a beer for drankin'...not savoring."
"Nice clear amber in color. Decent foamy head that hangs around for a bit before retreating to a thin ring around the glass. Malty aroma with a good hop balance. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side with this one and the flavors are all a bit subdued. Theres a slight sweet malt taste that is fairly well balanced with restrained hop bitterness. The sweetness comes out more as the beer warms. Theres a slight bitter finish. Carbonation is moderate. This one is definitely crisp, clean, and uncomplicated."
"As a side note, I've never enjoyed this on-tap -- too little head retention, mouthfeel suffers, and the carbonation goes out the window. Ends up looking like cider. Could just be personal preference."
"It's not a classic but much better with, say pizza, than the insipid American pale lagers of the mass producers."
"This is a bitter, sour, horribly sharp, thin, skunky beer. It makes my tongue want to hide."
"Also, if you ever have the chance to check out the brewer up on Rte. 61, it is not to be missed. It is definately the Oldest Brewery in America..."
"John"
"A heavy-handed lager with macro leanings. A bit grassy and husky with some tannins evident. Somewhat sweet which took the edge of what would otherwise have been a harsh malt profile, but the flavor was not engaging and it was a chore to work through the glass."
"After all that thid is just a basic lager, nothing really jumped out at me. It did finish crisp and clean. Certainly worth a try but only once."
"The taste is watery but well balanced. Very lean texture with slatey, minerally extracts rising through the illusion of rich baked goods. No palate presence, no finish. Not unpleasant. Well crafted."
"I aquired a single bottle of this fabled beer. It poured a golden yellow, with a nice head that quickly diappated into a thin lacy white color. The taste, ah the taste. I was shocked at first by what I felt was a sharp acid subtle bitter taste. But after a few more sips, it mellowed into a dull enjoyable sensation. I wish I had more than the one, but alas, I must wait until opportunity arises again."
"As anyone from PA knows, Yuengling is the hometown hero. It can be found in evey distributor across the state, and in most every bar. Known as simply ""lager"" (its not going to change either, so quit bitching), the beer has a huge following, and one that is not entirely unfounded. I realize that there are a plethora of more complex, more refined, more expressive and more challenging beers out there. Of course. But taken for what it is, lager is hard to beat. On tap, the beer pours a nice reddish brown color, with a very thin head that quickly disappears. Taste is balanced well, with a foundation of malt that is given some life by a blend of hops. It does not exude any particular hopfeel, and the bitterness is very refrained. It exhibits much more character than any other macro lager out there. Medium-dark, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, and refreshing. I've bought more cases and pitchers of this than any other beer as it goes down easily and tastes great. I know I'm biased, I know there's better, but I know I feel bad for people who are out of the distribution area, as they are missing out on America's best everyday beer."
"A fairly deep amber colored body is capped by a loose off-white head that drops readily to a thin surface covering and leaves only minor transient lace about the glass. In the nose, a sweetish malt dominates with a light hint of fruitiness from the Christian Schmidt yeast. It's light to medium bodied, and gently crisp in the mouth with a fine carbonation that allows it to become slightly creamy as it warms. The flavor delivers a gently sweet malt that's well-infused with a mildly floral hop flavor and low-level bitterness along with the Yuengling house-flavor. It finishes quickly, but leaves a mild residue of sweet malt that continues to build on the palate. An easy drinking beer that's balanced towards sweetness, but still remains enjoyable for a few."
"Many guys on here grow up in there high school and college years drinking beers like Budweiser, MGD, and Coors, but around here in northeast PA Yuengling is king. At first pour you will notice this beer has a very nice chesnut color to it with a decent head which does provide some lacing. As you inhale the aroma you can sense a sort of pungentness found in many euro mass brewed lagers like Becks. As far as taste goes, unlike many american lagers out there Yuengling actually has some, its quite nutty with a little bit of a hop flavor towards the end. The only real problem i have with this beer is that it has a tendancy to go flat a bit quicker than others. If you were looking for a highly drinkable beer for a bbq or camping trip yuengling lager would absolutely be a great pickup, especially at 16 dollars a case. One other note another local brew made by the lion brewery is called pocono lager, that beer and yuengling are almost carbon copies of one another."
"Poured an amber brown. Unknown head behavior as I got this on draught at a restaurant and it was gone by the time I got the beer. Minimal lacing. Aroma was slightly nutty, good malt presence. Mouthful was good. Medium to high carbonation but not distracting. Taste was malty with some frutiness, and a good hop balance. Not entirely pleasing, though. Dry bitter finish. I had it with grilled chicken, and it actually tasted worse WITH the food. A good looking brew that had a taste closer to fizzy yellow stuff."
"This brew pours an amber color topped off with a fairly decent off white head. The head fades at a good rate leaving little lace. The aroma is mainly malt. The taste is also malt with a bit of sweetness and no noticeable hops. Drinkability is a hard one to rate. Im sure you could pound a few of these but with not much flavor..why bother."
"Whats up with the green bottles though?"
"This was incredibly cheap and it shows. It was a so so beer, but definitely of the mega-macro variety. The pour was nice with a light copper color and there was a small white head that didn't stick around too long. There was no lace to speak of just some film on top of the beer. The smell was pretty swilly with a lot of adjuncts and not even a very distinct malt characteristic. The taste reminded me of an overly qualified genesee red. It had a lot of corn flavor without a hint of any hops and not even the sweetness I was expecting. I can imagine that the entire line of Yeungling was something much better pre-prohibition, but I had to give a nod the the oldest brewery in the U.S."
"OK, that was silly - rating a Yuengling like it was some sort of grand cru... it's just a good blue-collar, everyday beer. This over a Bud anyday."
"-F"
"I really don't like the public's perception of this beer. Around here, all you have to say is you want a lager and they bring you a yuengling like it's the only kind in existence. I have to restrain myself from telling people it's just an average beer made using corn grits as an ingredient and that lager does not mean amber colored beer. That's only about the beer's image though. The beer itself is quite good. It pours with that famous amber color with a head that diminishes as quickly as it forms. The taste has a malty sweetness and the hops lend a slight citrusy dryness. It's very well balanced which makes this way better than any other macro. I'd call this an all purpose beer. This beer is cheap, widely available and It can be paired with virtually any food. That's what makes it a great fallback beer. It's the kind of beer that's worth keeping a case in the fridge at all times even though you usually crave something better."
" A seltzery effervescence and head fizz away in a hurry. Zzzzz!"
" There is absolutely nothing exciting about this beer at all. It's a plain jane lager and it's a shitload better than bud, miller, junk, etc. A little sweetness comes through and just a touch of hops. A dry finish combines with no aftertaste. And there you have it. A perfect alternative to macros. If I know I will be consuming large amounts of beer for certain occasions, this will always be my choice if it is available where I am. Never dissappointing, never exciting, always pleasing in it's own simple way. Maybe I'm biased but who cares? I love this stuff and so does my non-aching head the next day."
"I had been waiting a long time to try this one. I have heard so many good things from so many people about the quality of this beer. Unfortunately I was far from impressed. I was hoping for a great flavorful excursion into the land of pilsners, but was greated by a slighlty darker version of regular old Bud. Left a stale taste in my mouth and in my soul."
"the taste has very mellow malts, some hops but not a lot. i seem to always detect a slight lemony aftertaste and then something slightly metallic. it's not a big deal, though. i would drink this over macro-swill any day. this beer has a very good drinkability in all seasons and with all kinds of different beer drinkers."
"A decent session beer and a good everyday choice."
"I rate it next to Pabst Blue Ribbon if you're in the market for an economy lager. It has become quite popular in many NJ dining establishments recently making it a good alternative to BudMillerCoors."
"I had this on tap and I was quite pleased. Nice amber color with a nice white head that seemed to stay throughout the drink. Not much aroma- but taste was crisp and well balanced with a little bit hop assertivness going on. Reminded me am English style lager- sort of bready, but in nice way. As for drinkability, this beer probably goes with just about everything."
"I hate to give straight three's, but that's how this beer hits me. When up against Bud, Miller, and Pabst, it is clearly superior - tasting almost like halfway to a Sierra Nevada. Some hoppines, a little fruitiness, and a cleaner quality. But, when tried against the Sierra, it's significantly inferior, with that American lager smell and taste. (makes the Sierra taste unbelievably good!). Nice amber color, small head, very little retention. Clean, goes down real easy. If you like American mainstream lagers, definitely seek this out, as it is the best (that I've tried) of the lot. But, in comparison to any of the great beers, fuggedabouddit!"
"This beer poured a nice clear woodsy/amber color. The head was a thin white color and consistency and no lace seemed to be present. The aroma was fairly crisp, hints of malt, hops, and some flowers seemed to be present. The taste was OK, sub-typical lager, nothing to write home about. Tastes of some sweet malt, fruit and bitter hops were present. Decently carbonated. To me this beer is very generic for this style. I have drank this before and try to stay away from it d/t it makes me feel nauseous the next morning. I like lagers but for some reason this beer does not impress me. I will have 1 when there is no other choice or just drink ice tea. They must know something since they have been brewing for such along time, just not my mug of beer."
"The oldest American continously running brewery, just that alone I think I have to pay my respects. This was the beer that in the Northern Panhandle of WV, still in high school we would cross the border into PA to get our hands on the good stuff. Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager was a beer we all yearned for, considering most days we drank mostly Coors Light and Busch. She pours with an amber brown hue, with heavily carbonated white colored head. The aroma consists pimarily of sweet malt possibly caramel, and there is a weak but present hop like aroma. I would like to the thank the Yuengling family for keeping up a better product than the macros out there and keeping their beers moderately priced. The lighter bodied beer has a rather thin texture, and it does annoy me that most of the time this beer gets way to much credit as being the good stuff. When in reality it is a mediocre beer that is great for getting people away from the fizzy yelllow brews this country mainly has to offer. A relatively sweet, but mostly bitter crisp finish forms a classic taste that I cherish. Yes, I cannot lie I can drink my fair share of it, but it really isn't a beer that I should spend much time on."
"I love the price for a six-pack of this $4.99 a six pack!Your drinking a well-made beer and it is cheaper then AB products!Very good on tap is a staple of mine when I go out and dont have alot of money.Good to see the little breweries get recognized so Ab and the rest dont have control over everything in the supermarkets."
"Overall, I think of this beer as a step above the macros but certainly aimed at the mass-market. I've had it on tap at many bars in PA and it's a little better than out of the bottle."
"This is one of the best of the ""Big Boys"" in American brewerys. I couldn't get it down in SC, so I would bring cases of it down. It's cheap and it's really good for the price. Has a nice light, but not too light taste to it and finishes smoother than a babies a**! Go get some!"
"For a Bud priced beer, this one is a real winner. Definitely not swill. It ain't Hop Devil, but it's not supposed to be. It's nice to see this brewery make its way up and down the eastern seaboard. Go Yuengling go!"
"Pours a nice, clear amber body with a quickly dissipating head. Leaves some trails of lace. Smell is a bit grainy, but not too bad. Taste is fairly well-balanced with some metallic elements. Nice overall. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability-wise, this scores highly. A very quaffable, clean American lager that makes for an excellent session brew."
"Growing up near Pottsville, PA, Yuengling's my hometown brewery, and their Lager is the first beer I began drinking reguarly. While I am admittedly biased, increased tasting experience has led me to recognize it as a good overall American amber. I'm not sure if its reputation among devotees or perhaps less serious beer drinkers as a ""nectar of the gods"" is completely justified, however. Nonetheless, I do enjoy this beer greatly. For this review, the bottle poured a nice clear, amber color, with a thin head and very little lacing. Only a few carbonation bubbles rose to the surface, giving the beer a slightly flat apperance. I noted some traces of corn in the aroma, with a slight malt smell, too. There was also a small, indecipherable metallic odor, but nothing overpowering. The taste had a good hop/malt balance with a very pleasing hop bitterness in the aftertaste. There was also a slight corn taste (I believe it's used as an adjunct in brewing), but the Lager gets away with it. This beer felt very creamy and the medium body had a smooth mouthfeel. Yuengling Traditional Lager remains an eminently drinkable beer, and will always be a welcome fall-back brew for me."
"head it pours is light, fluffy, and small....evaporates quickly...leaves no noticeable lace...typical amber brown...average appearance...taste is mellow with no noticeable hopiness and primarily mellow malts, strong element of sweetness and some alchohol taste to it as well...carbonation is also very light but body of beer does have a substance to it.  An average beer with a slightly above average taste and drinkability"
"It's a local fave, so my opinion is obviously tainted..."
"This is the beer I fall back on if nothing else is available.  Nice copper color is pleasing to the eye.  I has some flavor with a very clean finish and goes down easy.  This is the beer I give to my macro friends when they come over because everyhting else is ""too bitter"" or ""too heavy",  or I order it with dinner if the establishment has no appreciation for good beer.  Seems that several years ago it was harder to find, but now it is about as common as bud here in Pa, but not as ""common""."
"I'm not sure if there is a better value on the market.  It taste's great, and if you're lucky enough to have it sold near you, it should only cost about $5 -$6 per six-pack.  The head is almost soapy in appearence and mouthfeel.  The hops are up front, and quickly yeild to a whole host of other flavors, too many to name.  It isn't very sweet, but it still goes down smooth.  One of the most unique flavors I've ever had.  I've never met anyone who didn't like it.  Although the alcohol isn't listed, it can't be all that much, as I can drink this stuff all day.  There are better beers availiable, but none that give you this much for the money.  A really great beer."
"Notes: A very basic, old-school lager. Simple, sturdy and tasty ..."
"Middle of the road.  The beer has a copper color and a medium head.  Faint, sweet malty smell.  Very light on the hops, with a respectable malt slant.  Finish is clean, with little hop bitterness. I thought it was a little bland and ordinary.  Still, it's probably better than 90% of the beers in its price range."
"This is my go-to beer when I have buddies over. It's cheap and they'll like it. I like it too; it's got good, sweet malts and healthy clean hops, tastes great cold and fine a bit warmer, and it's far superior than anything the Big Three put out. It's no Mona Lisa, for sure, but it's at least the ""Have a Nice Day"" smiley face. Ubiquitous, unassuming, and it'll put you in a good mood. Take a sip of history from America's oldest brewery."
"a little bitter and skunky, but it is better than a heine. it tastes very similar to me, but it has much less carbonation which makes it go down much easier. this is nothing special at all, but it sure beats a few mediocre beers out there"
"Success story: The local golf course where I play put this on tap and took Budweiser off. How sweet is that?"
"Copper/Amber color with a white head that dissipated quickly.  Sweet, malt and hop smell.  Smooth, slighty sweet.  Nice balanced between malt and hops.  Nice, slighty bitter hops finish.  Dry, fairly long lasting, slighty sweet, slightly off center aftertaste.  Local supermarkets are now carring this one in Florida and at a great price.  This to me is a simple, not complex lager that goes with most foods and great on those hot days."

"Living in Eastern Pennsylvania, Yuengling Lager is available in quite a few places. It is my default brew if the rest are all macros. While it might not be the best of its kind, it certainly is good enough for a night's drinking. Recommended."
"Pours a nice amber in color. Slight malt and hop aroma on the nose. The same on the palate, with a very tiny sweetness. Really refreshing brew. Like I said before, it's  simple but very good beer. Has to be one of the best beers in it's price range."
"After going to college here in Pennsylvania, and going to some of the pubs in that area, I am really spent on this beer.  That is all anyone drinks, so understandably, I was not so high on it.  Now, after graduation, I have really grown to accept it.  The color is good, and it pours a nice head.  The first sip is a bit pungent, but it grows on you.  Towards the bottom of the glass, you are much more comfortable with this lager.  Not bad overall, although it borders on lawnmower beer.  Nothing fantastic, but drinkable."
"Being from Pittsburgh, I love this beer. When I go back I cannot wait to have one. Great deep copper color, nice foamy head, great relaxing beer. A bit sweet but it has a different taste from most lagers. Hard to explain. Great beer."
"Yuengling Lager:  for those of us not from Pa., it is pronounced “ying-ling” and when you want one you just ask for “a lager.”  Creamy white, dense head, with a little stickiness. It has a light pleasant aroma of malt.  The color is deep amber; all in all, this beer has a very nice appearance.  The taste is frankly unusual, not unpleasant, but almost a light soap taste, and the balance seems a little bit off.  This is world’s better than the macro-lagers, but falls far short of Sam’s Boston lager, in my book."
"A well balanced, easy drinking amber. Nothing jumps out, but no obvious flaws either. A little thinness is only indicator to me of adjunct presence. A good everyman, everyday beer. Unsubstantiated accounts say it outsells Bud in Philly. Good for Philly."
"I think these are fresher in Florida, they also have a brewery in Tampa, FL. Readily available, quality, and inexspensive beer. Nice clear amber color, thin white head. Sometimes a harsh bitter smell, but the sweet flavors and drinkability get you past that. Always available on tap and bottles. Nice feel to it, especially on tap. Some of the bottles get a funky, skunky taste to them pretty quickly, probably the green bottles.  I think it stands up to the other beers listed in it's class. Very tasty. Just a little inconsistent quality wise. A nice choice against the buds, millers, and others on tap. Very easy to drink several of these at once."
"Bit on the sweet side with no astringent flavours. Hops are light on the palate and barely round out the brew. A no frills amber lager. It actually does not taste bad as it warms up either. A good beer to grab on a lazy summer afternoon and let your mind go blank."
"Poured a deep amber with moderate carbonation and no nead.  Nose is a bit skunky but not unpleasant.  Crisp and clean at first, leading to a moderate hop bite up to the finish, then a crisp an clean finish.  This is growing in popularity.  That's a good sign.  Are the masses coming around and giving up the beerwater of the 80'?"
"Pours with a fluffy white head, topping amber liquid. Taste is light on malt, light on hops...but done very nicely, you can discern both in this easy-drinking lager. A good outdoor Summer brew, and the price is right!"
"Deep amber in color. Fresh smell with strong malt character. Taste is nice blend of hops and malt, with more sweet malt character than hops.  Very slight adjunct flavor.  Goes down smoothly, but fills you up quickly.  A meal in a glass!!"
"The beer of Pennsylvania. Not really something I'd be too proud of, considering we've got Victory, Stoudts, and Yards, but decent. Its got a nice dark color for a semi-mass produced lager, and a decent smell and taste. One thing I dont like about it is the use of corn. It definitely gives it a distinctive taste and mouthfeel. When this gets warmer it quickly loses drinkability, and the mouthfeel suffers as well. However, this is still a much better beer than macrobrews, and is incredibly cheap in PA. $1.75 to $3 pitchers of Lager (the only thing its ever named as) are common here in State College, which makes this one of my staples. Try it if you can, but dont go out of your way."
"A bitter lager. They are cheap in this area though, and still taste better than the Coors' of the world."
"Having lived in the Delaware Valley most of my life, this beer has been readily available. On all counts, this is an average beer, at best. I have heard the hype (""oldest brewery in America, etc.), but who cares? This is, I'm afraid, as average a beer as you are going to find. I have tried many, many times to appreciate this beer, but every time I drink it (as I did tonight when there was nothing, and I mean nothing, else available), I am less impressed. Average. And that's all."
"There is never a time when I do not feel like drinking a Yuengling.  This beer is a wonderful all-around beer.  Not too light, not too powerful, and always delicious."
"This is proof that an American lager can appeal to a wide range of beer drinkers. Medium in malt and hop character and clean in the finish. A decent, if not over-rated, American Lager."
"A staple of mine.  Affordable and crafted for the masses.  Beautiful bright amber color.  Not much nose, good head retention, smooth malty feel with a neutral aftertaste.  This is out tap beer at the shore very drinkable (Sea Isle , NJ).  It is the only beer we (my entire family) can agree on.  And, have I said its a great value....;)"
" This may sound blasphemous, but I think I prefer this from the can and not the bottle.  Don't ask me why, I can't explain it."
"Yuengling is one of those beers that never disappoints.  Maybe it's not the most profound beer, but it's certainly enjoyable (and cheap) to have a pint, whether at a nice restaurant or your favorite local dive bar.  Add to that the Yuengling brewery's history (oldest in America), and it's a winning combo."
"I really enjoy this beer.  If it were available in Michigan, it would be my everyday-type of quaffer.  I have friends who bring it back from Pennsylvania quite often.  A nice light amber color with a decent amount of malt in the taste.  Light hops, but enough to let you know they are there.  What a nice beer and inexpensive too.  I wish it were distributed to the whole country instead of the east and Florida."
"An average beer in general but far superior to it's peers in price (A-B, Miller, etc.).  For your money a good beer.  Much better on draft than in the bottle.  More hops would definitely be a good thing for this beer."
"Yuengling Lager can rescue the true beer lover stopping at the average Pennsylvania bar serving only pedestrian beers - they'll usually have lager on tap.  A solid beer and a true tribute to the power of advertising as this beer had no respect till they began an aggressive ad compaign years ago."
"Very smooth with a bit of malt sweetness and a faint hop finish. One of the most flavorful American lagers."
