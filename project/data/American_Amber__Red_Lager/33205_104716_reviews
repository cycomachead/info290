"Pours a clear orange color with a large foam head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted grain malts, with a slight hint of floral and citrus. The lightly toasted grains come through really nicely along with some pleasant honey, and bready malts. Really easy to drink. Perfectly carbonated, and very refreshing. Honestly surprised to see as low of a rating on this one. It's not the best, but it's a super easy drinker, and tasted pretty good to boot. Easily sessionable."

"Overall: Great offering here from Wisconsin Brewing Co. The mouthfeel isn't much like a lager but the taste comes through for the style. A touch sweet but I really enjoy it in this brew."

"A very nice, well-balanced American Amber Lager. Nice hop touch in the finish."

"The WI Brewing web site calls this a ""Classic Bavarian Lager."" Well... I never had anything like this on my visits to Bavaria, but marketing doesn't make it any less enjoyable."

"It took me a while to get around to this, but if you're having a brat fry this is the beer you wanna have on hand. Great for everyone from Cicerones to Budmillercoors crowds."

" All in all, very good in my books. Way to go Wisconsin!"

"Overall not bad. I think it's a good beer to have in the house in case I have people who aren't into the high end beers like I am and just need something easy drinking."
"O=A strong offering and one that could draw followers. I'd definitely choose this one over Wisconsin Amber, but would still choose my favorite, Lakefront Riverwest Stein, over the WBC offering if sold at the same point-of-purchase."
