"Very sad, beer smelled like dried apricots, was obviously bad. Big waste of $$$"
""
""
""
"The beer is boozy, bitter, and lacks roast and balance. One of the worst imperial stouts I've had as it is near undrinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall is a good coffee stout. Nothing that I would buy again I don't think."
""

"Very well done coffee flavored Russian imperial stout."

"O: a sbetter ubstitute for cold coffee than for a fine Imperial Stout."
""
"Poured into a teku and created a nice foam head.  Unfortunately, compared to some of the other big stouts, this has a very boozy taste @ 13%.  You pick up the alcohol on the nose and lacks the coffee and chocolate flavor to balance and counteract the booze. Another average job by Mikkeller."

"O: An enjoyable experience, quite possibly one which could be used to draw a wine geek into the world of beer appreciation. I might have liked a little more body to the brew itself, but the flavor profile is spot on for a sweetness-loving malthead."

"Great brew. Would and did buy again"

"-Bottled- Pours an oily, inky black color with a light gathering of slick, dark bubbles that dies off quickly. Looks flat after. Aroma is heavy on dark fruit, coffee and alcohol. Deeply roasted barley. Smells like port, too. Flavor is rich, sweetness and roast. Potent, sweetened coffee and burnt oats. Raisins and plums and port. Vanilla extract. Big, oily, slick, lingering feel. Unfortunately, this bottle is completely flat. It enhances the port/sherry feel. The alcohol is still present but you can tell the couple years of sitting has mellowed it out a bit. I wish the carbonation hadn't flees this one because it's pretty yummy otherwise. It has aged well and I'm not going to crucify this beer for going flat."

"Opened with little to no aging. Purchased at Jester King two weeks prior. Dark and malty with a bit of acidity on the finish. Dried fruit and coffee aroma. Surprisingly smooth for the ABV. Lighter body than expected. A bit of the alcohol shows up at the finish and as the beer warms."

"Good beer with great looks and smells, very lactic and a tad overly sweet though. While it was cold, citrus and piney hops was refreshing its bold and complex flavors and it was really pleasant. Still I enjoyed trying it."

"I love a stout but this took sweetness and alcohol way too far."

"A little overly sweet, but a good nightcap. Like the rich chocolate notes."

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours pitch black with a massive dark brown head that goes up 3/4 of the glass. The head turns more creamy and khaki colored as it dissipates. Big sweet and roasty aroma, definite bitter roast on the smell, some brown sugar and chocolate and a bit of dark fruit. Big sweet malts up front that fades into a super smokey roasty flavor that envelopes the palate. Lots of dark sugars and a hint of chocolate, but mainly roasty malts all over. Thinner than expected, a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. This came off on the cloying side somehow behind the roast, and a bit alcoholic. Meh."
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit of a disappointment due to the extreme sweetness and booze that shines through a little too much. But it's complex in flavor no doubt and the mouth feel is pleasant."
""
"Not a bad example of a coffee stout, just a little weak in flavor. The 13.1% ABV is well hidden – I don’t even have an alcohol afterglow in my stomach."

"O- This is much different than I expected. Not a super thick, rib-sticking brew, but a very good offering. I was impressed that at 13.1%, the alcohol was barely noticeable. Not too shabby."
""
"O - okay, so I am bit let down by the dud bottle, and while the 2nd bottle seemed fine I really can't see this as a special imperial stout at the price paid for it. Sure, it has some quality, but this just wasn't all that special as I thought it would be when I found it. I'm not sure I'd spend money on it again, but it was worth the 1 time experience. It's class is in the brewer's creative thought process when creating Black Hole. I'm just now sure it delivered the price paid. Still, if you can find it and have the extra cash to spend give it a try."

"Mikkeller Black Hole ---4.5/5"
""
""
"O: Over the top and rather sweet for me, just too much in the way of adjuncts. It doesn't derail the drinking experience, but it does hamper it. I can picture some of the barrel aged versions being quite good, as this might provide the balance needed to take the edge off of the sweetness. I will commend them for hiding 13+% abv so well, the alcohol has no bite at all. Of course, time in the cellar probably had something to do with that too."

"All in all a surprisingly great beer, that I recommend, even if you don't like coffee stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Mikkiller refused to disappoint with this rich barrel aged beer. It lives up to it's name, especially in appearance. It is pitch black with a thick coffee-colored head. Upon drinking the beer my mouth is filled with a rich but smooth texture that gives a burst of coffee, caramel, and especially licorice. It makes even Deschute's Abyss seem light. This is just my style but more of a special occasion sipping drink to share and not something I would hog the entire bottle for myself. Of course I would purchase it again."
""
""
"Recommended, even though this one is pretty damn expensive."
"Strikingly different from any coffee stout I've had. Well named, this is quite boozy and full of the darkest coffee flavor I've had in a beer. Quite interesting, complex, and unique."
""
""
""
""
"Big and important beer, strong alcohol, to sip. But, after all, balanced and pleasant."

"This poured out as a very dark black brew. The head was very thin and didn't leave much lacing or retention. The smell of the beer is pretty strong, some deep herbal roasted malt aromas and boozy chocolate on the nose. The taste of the beer has a nice complex roasted malt flavor with licorice flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is sticky, syrupy and smooth. It's thick and dense also. Overall this beer was pretty good. I think it is a little underrated on here but to each their own."
""
""
"Much like the aroma, so much going on with the flavor. Strong red wine, roasted malt, a medley of dried currants, a strong alcohol burn and a faint touch of coffee. Not a bad combo but the problem is that the flavors aren't separated. It ends up being muddled and frankly it just doesn't handle the ABV well. It is closer to a mead or port than a stout. Not necessarily bad if that's your thing."
""
""
"D - Nicely balanced big imperial Stout. Nice body and mouthfeel."
""
"Overall. Great tastes and quite smooth for such a high abv. The body could be fuller and I wish there was some carbonation, again, my bad probably."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer has a wonderful taste. Superb. Will have again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Im not sure if its worth the heafty price of the 11.2 or 12oz bottle - whatever it comes in, but its delicious nonetheless...and worth the $ for a special night."
""
""
""
""
"Overpriced beer and really not all that great."
""
"O - Very sweet for a stout, but it is honey sweetness instead of sugary sweetness. The coffee is in the background throughout. The nice scotch note in the background makes me hope that Mikkel ages this in Speyside casks next time he does a barrel aging series of Black Hole."
""
"O: Definitely not worth the price of admission by any stretch, but I am okay with having given this a try -- a big, big beer with a reasonably good balance of sweetness, hoppiness, and acidity for an RIS. Not my favorite by a long stretch, but unique. nonetheless"
""
"Syrupy body suits the beer. Could use a bit more carbonation."
""
""
""
"Certainly a decent beer, I disagree with all the harshly negative reviews I've read. On the other hand, it's certainly not ground breaking, and would probably taste much better in the future at a lower price point. Try it if you have the opportunity, but not necessarily worth the price that Mikkeller brews typically demand"
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, its a pretty big coffee stout. Minus points for being thin and a little simple, added points for really executing pretty well on the coffee element. Perhaps too coffee centric for me, but thats just personal taste. A pretty good beer that I'm glad to have tried."
""
"Black Hole pours a black color with no head at all. There is a strong chocolate coffee aroma, very boozy as well. There is a very bold complex taste. Coffee comes out, hints of chocolates and vanilla as well, strong alcohol tastes well. A nice full taste, but burns and fells like a liquor opposed to a beer. Overall a very interesting beer, might not be for everyone but worth a try."
""
"o - well, i took a chance and fell flat. i feel like this may have been a great beer at one time, but this bottle is clearly over the hill. if i come across a certifiably fresh bottle and feel like blowing $9 again, i'll update this review."

"Overall, I really enjoy this beer, especially for the abv. I wish the carb would have come up a tad - its like angels share all over. I did have this on tap at Monks Cafe in Philly about two years ago and remember it being more carbed and way smoother - like chocolate shakey."
""
"O: After reading the other reviews of this beer and reviewing my notes, I'm convinced that this bottle had to be extremely old and/or botched. It seems that all of the beer's complexities have disappeared. I'll have to try this one again in the future, and when I get around to it, I hope that I have a better experience because this one was plain awful."
""
"Overall I found this beer pretty enjoyable. The fruitiness was very pleasant to experience- and it was more of the fruitiness you'd expect in a pale ale rather than the dark fruits you'd perhaps find in an Imperial Stout. Interesting and complex beer."
"Overall, an unusual beer. I like the flavour, but there are elements to it that sit a little strangely and are hard to put a finger on."
""
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark black with a nice dark brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves light lacing. Coffee and dark malt aroma. Alcohol forward with a strong coffee flavor; dark malts and dark fruits. Finishes dry and sharp, probably from the coffee. Tastes more like a coffee dry English stout. Not well balanced, the ABV shows. Decent, but not remarkable and pricey."
"Light carbonation and a full body, the alcohol isn't present at all in the taste, but you can feel it almost immediately. Overall, not bad."
"O: A massive, hairy chested RIS that's a steel fist in a velvet glove - smooth and easy to sip (not easy to drink), yet immensely flavorful. I can't wait to try some of the BA versions of this, to see how they transform the raw character of this one. Pricey, but well worth it for a special occasion."
""

"Overall: While Black hole is a pretty tasty beer, it really needs to be a little bigger in every aspect. I would have no issues in having this one again if it was freely available, however I would not seek it out."
"Received in trade from MeadMe, thanks for the opportunity. After wrestling the cork out, I poured the darkest of black liquid into my glass with a smattering of small tan bubbles that dissipates almost instantly. Smells of coffee first and foremost with a vinous, smokey, earthy and chocolate aroma providing support. Some caramel and dark dried fruit and a touch of ethanol round out the edges. The flavor is sweet with a healthy dose of coffee. Chocolate, earthy hop flavor, dark cherries, and caramel all play their parts. Medium body with barely any carbonation and a watery chocolate syrup kind of mouthfeel. Smells great, tastes good, but the mouthfeel really could use some more bubbles to make this beer great."
"O - I will drink these for the rest of my short life...one of the best stouts around. Now I'm off to try the Black."
""
""
"The hop bitterness and high ABV were too much for my wife. But I feel like I've died and gone to heaven. The 13% alcohol is entirely well-hidden. The hop bitterness balances the sweet so well it creates the mirage of sweet french-roast coffee w/ cream."
""
""
"This one's a winner. Not terribly formidable given the strength. Definitely on the sweet side for an RIS but really tasty, maybe skewing to the barleywine side of things."
"Not what I was hoping for. Interesting beer. Worth buying once, but I don't need to get it again."
""
""
"how many big imperial coffee stouts can one guy make? apparently a great many, all very good. this one pours pretty dark, but not like the brunch, not nearly as thick in appearance. short filmy head, mocha colored, and reviving itself with every rattle of the glass. smells like coffee rather strongly, roasty malt, booze. flavor is way less coffee than i expected from the nose, more notes of vanilla and wood, but not sweet for an imperial. the alcohol doesnt really come out too much until it warms up. i love the feel of this beer, its best asset. very round and expansively velvet in the mouth. leaves a nice layer of semisweet complexity on the tongue, and fades very very slowly. carbonation is almost a cross between nitro and cask, creamy and smooth, but not overly bubbly. full bodied, leaves a hefty buzz, i like this one better than the breakfast but not as much as the brunch."
""
"Love the fact i get this on growler these days and pours a dark black as night hue which leaves a coffee laced two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is ever so sweet wih aromas of roasted barley,dark Belgian chocolate,milky bittersweet coffee and ripe cherries,the mouthfeel is silky smooth and full bodied with tastes of milky coffee,dark Belgian chocolate,roasted barley,brown sugar,toasted malts and finished with a ripe fruity chocolate bitter sweetness and overall its very easy to drink for a brew of this high ABV and even better off tap this fresh and i have to take my hat off to Cellarbrations as this growler is done perfectly and if they have it on tap again ill buy it just like RIS's should be done cheers."
"375 ml bottle with silver foil into snifter, best by 1/14/2014. Pours pitch black color, with pretty much no head; with a thin lacing cap that sticks around. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, caramel, coffee, dark roasted malt, raisin, biscuit, oak, molasses, earth, slight herbal, and a bit of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas, but are a bit unbalanced. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, black malt, caramel, earth, vanilla, raisin, toffee, molasses, honey, and slight herbal hops. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, earth, biscuit, vanilla, toffee, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Very robust flavors, with good balance. Big malty flavors that are minimally cloying. Very light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden for 13.1%, with only a warming after the finish noticed. Definitely a sipper, but is fairly smooth. Overall this is a nice and fairly complex imperial stout. Huge robust flavors, and quite smooth to sip on."
"Notes: I can't help to remember GI's Night Stalker… It is not so extreme in the resinous profile, but it is close in the range. Here maybe the coffee and all else make it flow a bit less assertively. Still… this is geared to someone who can enjoy a rather hoppy Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's interesting and big surprise from the nose, but it also doesn't really even tasty like coffee, or have much of a good coffee stout taste to it. Odd."
""
""
"I love this example. I would probably buy another bottle to age as there are flavors that will come out with a bit of time, 13% and all."
"Tried this after trying the barrel aged versions. Still a very good beer without the aging but the true genius of it comes after it goes into the barrel. Russian Imperial? Not so sure about that. Kind of its own class."

"It's kind of a jumble of flavors but this one really worked for me."
""
""
""
""
"D - It's got good flavors working for it, but it's not built too well and it doesn't drink too well. Disappointing offering from a good brewer."
"Dr: Drinkable for the ABV, but nevertheless difficult to handle. It doesn't have any masking overtones (e.g. those that are present in the barrel aged versions), but it's okay as a foundation. Feels like a shell intended for better things. I enjoy it okay for what it is, but I wouldn't have it again. The mouthfeel is disastrous coupled with the strong alcohol. Flavours never come in to save it as they do with the aged versions. Fans of Mikkeller (like meself) are best of pursuing the aged versions - particularly the red wine edition. This pales in comparison."
""

"When you hold this beer up to the light you just see black. The light does not penetrate this beer in the slightest - not even around the edges. It truly is as solid a black as a beer can get. A thin half finger of beige and creamy head developed on the beer and quickly receded to a thin collar. There was no lacing from this. As I drank the beer there was plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this beer is aggressive - as soon as you pour this behemoth it seems to charge from the glass and seek out the nearest nostrils to assault. I was pleased these happened to be my nostrils. There is an intense coffee aroma that smells as good as the ritziest of coffee shops. There is also burnt toast, roasted malts, and unsweetened chocolate present. All these are very strong but they balance each other beautifully. None of them are overshadowing the rest. The taste is complex and world class. You get a very high quality coffee flavor that almost seems a bit like a mocha as it blends with the bittersweet chocolate. As these fade I get caramel, vanilla, and a bit of woody taste. Somewhere in there I got the dark fruits typical of belgian dubbels. The finish has that nice warming alcohol sensation. The taste of the 13.1% alcohol is well hidden. The flavors in Black Hole are intense and highly enjoyable. I have a thing for good coffee beers and this once again has impressed me greatly. The mouthfeel is rich, smooth and almost a bit silky. No excuses - go try this beer."
""
"Overall, this beer is interesting...not great, but not necessarily bad. It's just that whatever hops are used in combination with the chocolate/roasted malts just isn't balancing well. A big beer in terms of ABV, indeed...but when it comes to flavor, this one falls a bit flat."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's ok. The extremely low carbonation and pruniness throws me off. Almost like I'm drinking a glass of wine instead of an Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black Hole is not among MIkkeller’s finest moments. It’s rough and needs work. Its biggest problems are its thin body, lack of carbonation, and excessive alcohol. Frankly, it’s not good. Addressing some of these issues would probably go a long way to getting on the right track. My advice – skip it for now."

"O: Well, that was a successful experiment. I have enjoyed exactly 0 Black Holes so far. At least I'm padding my low scores to bring my overall reviewing average down. And it only costs $14 at a time."
"I'm really disappointed with this. In fact, it gets worse with each sip. I toyed with the idea of just pouring the rest down the drain but decided to stick with it to see if it got any better...it never did. Really, a poor choice."
"O: Mikkeller's Black Hole was a middle of the road RIS. I wouldn't go out of my way for this, as there are better options on the market."
"O - Rich, complex and something I would certainly go for again. I enjoyed it even more as I let it warm up in my hands."
"Mouthfeel is thick and boozy. Overall pretty mediocre"
"O-better than what other ppl say. Don't know if I can drink a whole lot of it."
"Very good Barrel Aged Imp Stout that I was pleasantly surprised with. Recommmended."
"This beer is very nice overall. Big notes and flavors with big depth. Just enough alcohol blend and cover up but there enough to let you know it's a strong beer. The only possible know here could be there carbonation. But I don't even see it as a teal negative because it just makes it seems like a ten year aged beer."
"Overall, not bad, probably won't buy it again. After coming off a weekend of Double Black and Bourbon County Coffee, this doesn't hold up."
"Done."
"O - Just a big, nasty RIS that clobbers you over the head with dark flavors. A bit too one-dimensional for my liking, I'm a bit worried about all the barrel-aged versions I'm sitting on."
"Appears black with a tiny light brown head. Head vanishes quickly, leaves tons of lacing. Smells like roasted malts and grains, burnt coffee, smoke, cocoa, and vanilla. Taste follows the nose but everything seems subdued. The alcohol is very well masked. Thin, watery yet creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation. Drying spicy alcohol finish with lingering coffee bitterness."
"O: One of the best Imperial Stouts of all time. Absolutely f-ing recommended and desirable. I went back the next day for another bottle. I can't understand the mediocre scores here."
"I was given thie beer as a wedding present with many other beers. At first glance, the fancy foil top and cork like cap is nice and all but...once you pour the beer the immediate noticibility is no head what so ever. Ok cool..no biggie. But ther beer taster old and smokey. Usually different tastes from 10%+ stout style beers, but to cut it short not a fan. Been brewing beers for a very long time on a weekly basis and this one taste like a beer that I have made that had gone horribly wrong. No appeal...no taste...no GOOD!"
"For the ABV, this is a really smooth brew. Well done!"
"O - A great RIS and worth every penny IMO. A beer I would definitely like to revisit."
"Overall this is a brilliantly brewed beer that is most unlike anything I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's really not that pleasant to drink; the flavors, though complex, unique, balanced, and special, in the end just add up to an interesting experiment that isn't really worth repeating. I would be curious to see how it ages, but at $17/bottle (in Boston), I'm not sure it's worth the price."
"Mikkeller says their goal has been to push the limit and they feel with this ""warming, intense imperial stout"" that they've done that. Yea, they've pushed it too far - about 4.1% too far to be exact. Is the point of pushing the limit just to push the limit? Apparently so because, despite the promise of the recipe, little care has been given to flavour, balance, drinkability (or cost) in this cacophonous, brutish example of an imperial stout. Pass on it."
"Pours a black color. 1/5 inch head of a tan color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight dark citrus, alcohol, coffee, and hint of hop. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, slight acidity, coffee, hint of citrus hops, and alcohol. Overall, poor appearance, but good aroma, body, and blend."
"Just a little too big to be exceptionally drinkable, but really, at over 13% this isn't a tough one to sip on. This would be appropriate for a winter occasion or with a chocolaty dessert."
"D-Needs a year or two to mellow out. Too hot when fresh."
"Drinkability - You could pop this for breakfast it goes down so well. It's very big yet highly quaffable."
"I tried to stay away from it, but I was pulled into the Black Hole. What a fun libation. 13% alcohol doesn't go down much smoother, and if you're willing to pay the premium this beer commands ($11.99 for 375 ml), you too will let the Black Hole suck you in."
"D - one or two... but the alcohol flavor and feel would get old."
"drinkability: we had a rare sout party is this was one of the selectons. This was good, but not one of the best."
"D: definitely a sipper due to how rich and boozey it was. The only thing it lacked was a bit of carbonation."
"I think that if you are yet to throw yourself into Imperial Stout or just something different and over the top - give this a go."
"Pours brings a black beer with a nice mocha head and a bit of lacing. Thin collar around the edges throughout. The nose has a bit of dark chocolate along with a lot of roasted malt. There's also a bit of oxidation and cardboard. Along with the excessive roast, the nose on this isn't really for me. The taste scales it back, but this is still pretty one dimensional. The body is medium and a bit too boozy. Not a bad stout, but not really something I'd seek out again."
"Verdict: Try if you must, but it's way over the top, like White Wizzard...not my fave..."
"Very light feeling for 13%. Low carbonation, with the body of a porter. Rich roasty char, dark bakers chocolate, moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. Burnt pumpernickel toast. Scorched chocolate syrup, but not really all that sweet. Finishes dry, with a long bitter aftertaste of charred black malt. Slightly prickly. This is more strange than anything, due to the light body and slickness, with little in the way of substantial carbonation. Not really something i'd reach for again."
"Treating myself to a very high ABV beer in a Cheers (yes the 90's TV series) mug at my desk in Santa Cruz California. Though what compelled my to purchase this beer was the ABV but now that I've tasted it and it is being digested (I'm about half way done with the bottle) I realize that I should probably be sharing this beer. Fire is very present in the aroma as well as the smoky porter and coffee smell. The taste is, albeit too easy a diagnosis, a bit watery and bitter for a dessert beer. The after taste is definately an acquired one and nothing to boast about, yet any unique beer is A game in my book. As with most Mikkeller beers the appearance is exceptional (opaque with a very small head of coffee with cream) Bottomline, your ten bucks is better spent on the Beer Geek by Mikkeller, if one has the option, and share this one with a friend because your taste buds will diminish as you get more drunk."
"D - Silly drinkable if you're a fan of the darker stout flavors. Hides the 12% abv like it's its job."
"I bought this one not knowing about the beer in particular, just that Mikkeller is typically something special. I got home and looked it up, and found it had a 3.8 avg, which is really not so hot, as you know, on this site, as most of us tend to overrate. And a friend told me he was quite underwhelmed by it. I'm going to politely disagree with the avg, and my new (generous) friend alctradamus and score this one a good bit higher than its avg. I think this is at least very good, if not a bit better. It may not be one of the elite of the elite imperial stouts (I had a Kentucky Breakfast Stout last night), but it's in the ballpark if my opinion counts."
"Well, the alcohol is present here, not a surprise at over 13%, it's quite strong in the roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors are right up front, mouthfeel is a bit lacking and light but overall given it's high abv it's fairly drinkable although I'd advise splitting it."
"The de-corking was followed by no pop. Hardly carbonated. Heavy but empty."
"I find this to be a disappointing offering from Mikkeller. Would love to try the barrel aged version(s)."
"I figured I'd start with the normal version before venturing into the various barrel-aged iterations. That said, it pours a sraight bleak obsidian topped by a bit more than a half-finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malts. Nicely simple and effective. The taste is equally effective, though the roast takes central standing, and a slight alcohol burn runs down the back of my throat. The body is lightly heavy, with a light carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, another lovely stout from Mikkeller. I look forward to seeing what the barrels do to this thing."
"The appearance of this beer is black hole like in nature, as the name would suggest, but there isn't much in the realm of head on the top, even though there is some tan foam. The smell consists of some caramel, roast, coffee, chocolate and a hint of smoke mixed with booze. The taste has some smokey properties to it along with the roasty characters that can be associated with chocolate or coffee there is a light fruity almost raspberry like flavor in the back as well. The mouthfeel is rather kind and smooth considering the ABV here. This however is still as strong beer and must be sipped."
"the major downfall of this beer is the lack of carbonation. i understand it's a stout, but atleast have enough carbonation to have a decent head. drinkability is okay, the flavor is great just a bit more carbonation would take this from average to extraordinary."
"Drink is average for this type of stout"
"Not good... seriously like an alcohol-infused oil-slick. The flavor is quite bad, it doesn't go down well, and it doesn't look appetizing."
"It left me wanting a coffee stout."
"The drinkability was severely hurt by the lack of carbonation. It didn't drink like a beer at all. The flavors seemed pretty decent, it's unfortunate the mouthfeel and appearance pretty much ruin this beer for me. The alcohol also a little too apparent. Not enjoyable at all for me and won't buy again. I hope all the barrel aged versions I have are better."
"Tough to drink but an enjoyable experience for me and a few others at the tasting. However, I will say, many people did not care for this, nor any of the other Black Holes."
"Pours black into my tulip with a bubbly mocha head that sits about two fingers tall that shrinks down to thin layer of foam. The smell is rich with caramel and chocolate up front with hints of coffee lingering. The aroma is also slightly boozy. Smells like rum cake or maybe sherry or something to that nature. Vanilla is also noticeable on the finish as well as dark fruits. Probably cherries. The taste is almost reverse for me than what I would want. Mostly alcohol up front with hints of cocoa, dark fruit a bit of vanilla and sherry but mostly, this is a booze bomb. When I popped the cork on this I didn't hear anything. It's not entirely flat but it is really lacking carbonation. With that and the body seems a bit light for the style I'm a bit under impressed. Honestly, I don't know if I'll finish this bottle. It's not terrible but certainly an aggressive brew."
"Drinkability? Would be tough to finish a bottle on your own. It is interesting to try for sure but not for me. Perhaps, it is just too complex for me but I don't get this beer. Sure it has intense flavours but it is not pleasant to drink."
"D- I'm torn on this. The fact that my bottle was uncarbonated really ruined a lot, and I'd like to try a better bottle...but the fact that the bottle is green, and the fact that the cork is a hybrid material (no idea if it has any impact or not, but its not made out of cork) puts me off on buying it again...the huge price point is a turnoff as well"
"One of the best RIS's I've ever had. Simply wonderful and for a 13 percent beer, drinks quite well. I definitely want this one again!"
"Not a big fan of the whole ""zero carbonation"" thing that I've experienced with this series. Part of mouthfeel for me is having texture and texture is provided by bubbles. Good taste, weak mouthfeel."
"Cheers..."
"much preferred over the barrel aged series of Black Hole."
"OK, I get what they're going for I think. A sweet and wet example of a stout with some coffee flavors to balance things a hair. The problem is this is awful. Yeah it's a fruity (and more complex than I described) aroma. The beer is way to freaking sweet and unlike so a great English barely wine that does this in a way that makes you savor it. This beer doesn't even get close. The ""sale"" price I got this beer at of 8.49 makes it all the more awful . At nearly 50 bucks for a 6 pack (and I understand the high cost of distribution and taxes) it's just unacceptable for this to be a bad beer. It is."
"D: A delicious treat with bold roasted flavor. More than one would take away from the enjoyment... plus, ABV would ruin my palate for the rest of the night. A good beer, but not great."
"I may get another one to lay down for a few years."
"D- This, Lack of carbonation is really a downer, Although this beer has some great qualities I'm pretty disappointed that a glass cost 13 bucks! This beer is a must try still if not for the inspiration of flavors and sweetness."
"D: Middle of the road. Lots of alcohol means I'll be feeling it at the bottom of this glass. It's also just too sweet for me. I generally enjoy coffee stouts, but this one isn't tops in my book. Tastes more like chocolate milk than coffee...perhaps because I like my coffee black."
"D - This is a good coffee imperial stout. However, the flavor did not match the great aroma."
"375mL bottle with a best-before date of 1/07/12. Pours black with very little head. Aroma has chocolate, coffee, alcohol, bitter hops, and dark fruits. The taste is strong and very boozy with burnt coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Drinkability isn't great, this was difficult to finish. This beer was a bit of a let-down after trying Beer Geek Breakfast. It's a bit too hot right now.. I'll cellar my other bottle for a while before drinking it."
"Overall impression: needs more malt. Roasty, chocolatey goodness and the heft more malt would provide would make this a better beer, IMHO. It's a decent beer as is, but certainly not other-worldly."
"The beer is extremely dark brown in color with a brown head that is almost non-existent but this is fairly typically of a Russian Imperial Stout. It has a very light scent of chocolate but that is it. The flavor profile is complex with strong coffee and vanilla flavors and some definite pitted fruit aftertaste. The heat is not well hidden, this definitely screams high alcohol but not enough to affect the nose. The body is thin but smooth with the right amount of carbonation for this style. Overall it is a decent imperial stout but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, I have barely ever to be this disappointed with a beer, but this is crap as a really crappy thing. All this talk of prunes and crap is probably the best kind of pairing I can think of for Black Hole, and shame on Mikkeller for allowing such a devious fall from the pinnacle of grace that is Beer Geek Breakfast to be unleashed on all of us. It was such hell I poured it out halfway through."
"D-- My issue is that it is really sweet and to me under carbonated. Still, it is unforgiving and beats you down pretty big. One is all you can do and a 375 still may be too much. More due to sweetness than the ABV. ABV is well hidden but gets to you after a while. More like a liqueur than anything else. Good idea to let this cellar for 6 months before drinking. Not the best RIS I have had and my Black Damnations are far more complex than this is."
"This is a very big stout. Flavor is rich and intense. Not for the uninitiated."
"Its ok, but nothing spectacular, I don't mind a hoppy stout, but find this a bit lacking in complexity compared to your more traditional Imperial Stouts."
"Big beer with little carbonation that to my mind marries the mouthfeel and sweetness of a young barleywine with lots of coffee and chocolate found in an Imperial Stout. This is a well made beer that uses some sweetness to balance the huge hoppy coffee notes in the midbody. Could do with some aging but it contrasts nicely with the more lively Beer Geeks Breakfest"
"D- While the alcohol is hidden quite well in the flavor its effects are felt suddenly."
"D - I don't know if I got a bad bottle but this is inferior to the Black Albert"
"Overall, I was quite disappointed. I've had phenomenal coffee stouts, and I don't even know if I would have called this a stout brewed with coffee! I have a few more offerings from Mikkeller waiting downstairs, so hopefully they turn my frown upside-down!"
"I still appreciate what these Danes are attempting and support them wholeheartedly. Keep it up guys! Nothing's rotten in the state of Denmark as far as I can tell."
"d - An ok RIS, but too hot for me. Would give another shot if it had some more time on it."
"D: Blech, no thanks, Mikkeller. Not very much in terms of redeeming qualities about this beer."
"D: An immensely drinkable beer."
"Nice, smooth mouthfeel without being to cloying or thick. The only down side is the ABV."
"One finger brown head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation. Pretty complex nose, coffee forward, a bit of chocolate, quite a bit of roast malt, with some sweetness (the honey?) for balance. Taste mirrors the nose, leading to a pretty bitter finish. Mouthfeel is quite full, not a lot of effervescence. One of the more aggressive stouts I've had in a while, need to be careful re drinkability at this ABV, this shit will kick your ass, alcohol very prominent. A very powerful, and complex, RIS."
"Sweet coffee binge on the initial flavor...like mixing a half and half of Nestle Quick and wickedly strong coffee. Alcohol level is high and almost tastes more like a liqueur than a beer. Dark fruit is more evident as it warms, but is not as big as in the nose. This beast of a beer borders on going over the top, but never quite crosses the line. Lack of carbonation is a bit of a bummer, but it is not as missed as it would be in most other beers. Dont think I would buy it again at such a steep price point, but glad I got to try it."
"It's rare that I don't finish a beer unless I spill it on myself or pass out without drinking it (in which case I'll finish it the next morning). But the two of us were grimacing with every sip. I'm still looking forward to trying their other stuff, and I know they are sought-after for their challenging and experimental beers. I'll just have to concede this particular challenge."
"Hm, I love it when this happens - Pours with at first only a few soap bubbles with evolves to a very fined thin tan ehad and some lace. Color is an opaque black with hints of brown ( duh, head) and some bits of tan sediment in suspension. Aroma is dark ripe fruit, old leather, black loamy earth, fecundity, an stuff ya ain't supposed to know about. Taste is quite different - rich, dark malts with coffees from europe and asia, vanillas from got knows where, and sinful sweetness with just enough bitterness to offset it. Body is velvety, full, round, and waiting to be enjoyed like a dangerous fruit I have in mind heh heh. Finish is a fascinating contrast between exquisite and coarse, not too long and proly not a session unless ur into gettin hauled off. Although it's all I can do to not slurp the bitch."
"D-not a bad imperial stout, huge but lots of roasted coffee and bitterness. definitely some heat in the finish, not fusel at all just heat."
"The palate opens with a big burnt malt character with a robust bitterness, with a moderately fruity character, with raisins and plums. Coffee and cocoa appear mid-palate, working surprisingly well with the fruity oxidation. The oxidation does add a lot to this beer. Full in body and low in carbonation, the finish on this beer is long, long, LONG. Lingering bitterness, fruity oxidation and coffee are all present. Alcohol is fairly well hidden too. This tastes a lot better than it smells, and I'm rather surprised by the fact. There isn't enough flavor to make up for the ABV that's a lot higher than it needs to be. Also, as I drink the rest of my bottle, I find the soy sauce character growing, and an increasing sulfur/phosphor-like acidity on the finish growing, reminding me of what it's like to inhale a just-extinguished matchstick."
"A solid effort, though certainly not among the elite of the imperial stout nobility."
"D- Well, I was already getting tipsy after going through most of the bottle. It's a big beer and not something you would probably be consuming profuse amounts of. It took some work to finish this bottle."
"The citrus component of this beer makes it the most unusual RIS that I have ever encountered. However, this is not the weirdest aspect of this offering - at 13.1% ABV, one would expect at least a modicum of alcohol astringency. Nope. At first, I thought it was the citrus hops' obfuscation, but further on, it was plainly apparent that the big booze was just very well and ably integrated. Or, maybe the eponymous 'Black Hole' refers to its whereabouts. Once again, well played, Milkkeller. My first thought was for a long ageing process for such a beast, but it seems that it can be approached both ways..."
"worth a try with out doubt, they must have put a fair bit of coffee in this because I can feel it perking me up as the booze tries to slow me down, a strange sensation mixing uppers and downers. all that aside I will be putting a pair of these away for awhile to see if the booze mellows out a bit"
"It definitely tests your mettle and intestinal fortitude, intense is the word, intense malt, alcohol and coffee. Don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to take the trip, this is not for the faint-hearted."
"Pours a pitch black with a giant tan/brown head. Looks delicious. Smell at first is espresso and bakers chocolate. As it warms more alcohol is present and becomes the most notable. Taste is dominated by coffee/espresso flavors and dark chocolate. Somewhat hot intermittently based on temperature. Mouthfeel is a tad thin but not as distracting on my palate as some other reviews have mentioned. Finish is really dry considering how big the malts are. Overall a nice beer, would have again on tap."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, syrupy, with light astringency making it's presence known."
"Beer is medium bodied and sweet up front. Strong acrid bitterness at the back. Lots of coffee flavor. Very dry. Lingering flavors and bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is OK but its not my favorite RIS or Mikkeller. I would like to try the barrel aged versions."
"This probably has more in common with Utopias and other beers like that than it does with other coffee stouts. Big beer. Would be an amazing dessert beer."
"wow need to buy another one of these and keep it for a while, really enjoyable."
"D- This is a very rich and complex beer and takes some work to consume. It is rewarding and worth trying."
"SkÅL!"
"D: Well, it's big, bold, and sweet. Not very drinkable, even for this style. Maybe this one was best drank at its youngest. This bottle has at least a year and a half on it."
"I think Pappat44 sent me this bottle? Thanks!"
"Overall this wasn't quite as flavorful as I was expecting given the body of the beer and the allowance for a multitude of flavors in such a big beer. I could see this one coming along nicely with some age on it, but even as it is it's still worth a shot."
"Drinkability is good. It went down pretty easy considering the abv, although this is a beer for slow drinking for sure. A brew for every once in a while. This beer was on my list to find for quite some time and while its not the best I've had, its still a nice brew from the style. Down the road I wouldn't mind having it again."
"Mikkeller is one of the most hit and miss breweries I have ever come across. This is a big miss for me. I would not recommend this at all."
"Wow, very sweet. I was expecting more of a roasted coffee flavor. Picking up some slight fruits, like raisins or dates. Medium to full body but not too complex. Barely any carbonation...not sure if that's normal. Roasted malts, for 13% ABV, it's somewhat hidden. The booze flavor, maybe bourbon...is detectable on the palate, but the booze mouthfeel is minor. Then again, there's definitely a booze warming down the throat and into the stomache. Overall, a pretty tasty stout from Mikkeller!"
"An odd one, but I like it being a fan of RIS. Still, I like a beer to have at least a little carbonation. This has zero. Its on the strong side to drink a lot of. Definitely a sipper."
"Overall, I've had this in the cellar for over a year, and I'm curious what a fresh one would taste like. I'll definitely be buying more when I find them."
"The beer pours black with a very small brown head. The aroma is coffee with some spice and also some trash components. The flavor is coffee, alcohol, spices, pepper, tobacco and chocolate. Complex, but not that great. Thick, slimy, oily mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Have I mentioned I LOVE this beer??"
"This beer is a beast, and I am impressed with the fact that I don't have to slow down that much between sips. It keeps me coming back for more."
"I bought this bottle at Osheas brewing co. in orange county. When i poured this inky, darker than dark, bottle conditioned beer directly into a shaker glass i barely got 1 fingers worth of a dark, coffee colored head. There was a discernible amount of alcohol aroma on the first whaff i took. The 13.1% ABV definately shows on the aroma. The aroma sets you up for the first sip well which has a strong coffee flavor with a strong alcohol undertone and a slight warming sensation as its going down. Black Hole has a great mouthfeel for the style of beer, very thick and full bodied, coating the inside of my mouth with a very sweet aftertaste. Overall this is a strong, thick beer for someone who enjoys the flavor of coffee."
"D: I recommend splitting a bottle. After a few ounces, I was ready for something else."
"Pours a very dark brown, near black in color, viscous with a very small (forced) bubbly brown head. Very sweet malts, grainy, coffee grounds and alcohol in the nose. Creamy in the mouth, very sweet, this beer taste strong but not quite 13%, the ABV is pretty well hidden. Smooth going down, wonderful burnt malt aftertaste, a few ounces of this and im good. A great bottle to split with friends, dessert beer possibly?"
"CHEERS!!"
"Drank this on Valentine's Day, thought it was fitting. Never even noticed this was a green bottle til I took the foil off. Cork comes off with a very weak fizzle. Pours the blackest of blacks, a thick tan ring of head turns into nothing after a few sips, understandable because of the alcohol I suppose. Smell is coffee, honey/sweetness, plenty of booze. Taste..ugh. Major disappointment here. Kind of just tastes like cold black coffee, dark malts, a bit of sweetness, tons of booze. The malts + alcohol are EXTREME, to the point where I had to stick it in the fridge for about an hour to continue drinking it. Once it was chilled it was much easier to drink and I enjoyed it a little, but it was hard. Mouthfeel is very smooth and malty but I prefer more chewy thickness, and a little bit of carbonation wouldn't hurt. High price on top of this doesn't help the drinkability either. By far the harshest beer I have drank. Drinking it chilled definitely helps. I'm sure some age would've done this beer some good."
"This is good beer for big beer lovers, but isn't as special as some of what Mikkeller brews. While the name and the ABV point to an Imperial stout that reaches critical mass, Black Hole is too thin and too sweet to make a major impact."
"OVERALL: A great beer. Certainly one of the tastiest Imperial Stouts I've ever had, but it needs a bit more longevity on the look and feel to make it world class. Still, this one is definitely worth the price tag, and I'll be picking up another one for sure if I see it. One worth seeking out if you can't get it in your area."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Everything that I could have hoped for and more. A truly unique beer drinking experience."
"""this is a crazy amazing beer""! by far one of the best of its style."
"Very pleasant, if sweetness were toned down this would be an absolute killer."
"Thick and rich on the palate, the nose follows through. With this high of an ABV, this is a beer for sharing. Do not drink alone."
"If anything, the level of sweetness, while providing a solid canvas for the raging complexities of the brew, comes across slightly too heavily after more than half a glass. It somewhat hurts the drinkability in a way that the surprisingly high ABV does not. Still, it's an impressive beer - one of the sweetest and hence most unique Imperial Stouts I've had the pleasure to try. Serve it with a heady chocolate dessert that can stand up to it, or some citric fruit salad that can cut through it."
"Let it open up for at least an hour, the warmer the better. Split it, it took me almost three hours to finish a bottle."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full and mostly flat. Definitely needs some bubbles. This beer is very odd to me....when taking a look at each component of the smell and taste individually I would think it would add up to a fantastic beer. But for some unexplainable reason it just doesn't come together for my palate. In fact, it was kind of odd to drink. The whole is definitely not equal to the sum of its parts."
"Overall, another quality RIS that I'm happy to have tried.  Not the best RIS I've had, but one that is still worth seeking out in my opinion.  There are only two downsides that cross my mind and cause me to give pause before considering this beer's score: 1) some people might not like Black Hole because the sweetness is borderline ""cloying"" but it does not bother me so long as I enjoy this beer slowly; and 2) Black Hole is quite pricey given the serving size - north of $10 for a corked-and-caged 12.7oz bottle vs. most other RIS that come in 22oz bombers."
"All in all I'd recommend this only to someone who likes their beer to double as a lollipop."
"A corked 375ml bottle purchased around late 2007/early 2008. Poured from the bottle into a standard shaker glass. The stout appears a very dark brown color with about a finger of quickly fading ecru colored foam. Nose and flavors consist of bittersweet chocolate, dark molasses, acrid, roasted low end coffee beans, quite a bit of boozy alcohol heat lingering about yet, some more roast and a bit of char. Yay, heartburn after every swallow. Oily, medium to full bodied with just about enough carbonation and an oily boozy finish."
"D - This rates pretty well for me, a Stout done right is something to be treasured, and they got this one close to perfect"
"salud!"
"this beer poured a pitch black with a thick dark espresso tan head. the smell was a fresh and clean roasted barley followed by notes of chocolate and rich coffee. the taste was amazing in my book, a heavy rich molasses and cocoa with bold dark roast coffee. there were also hints of a more bitter bakers chocolate, vanilla and posibly anaise. the finish was a strong full bodied beer with a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. i loved this beer and am a big fan of strong stouts like this. i would jump at the chance to drink another!"
"M/D- I didn't finish this. I had a hard time pushing it down. I really need to revisit someday. I either have a bad bottle or I have different taste than everyone else."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Drinkability: A high ABV stout with a good level of drinkability. There is a bit of alcohol in the finish but that is it. The flavours are slightly to sweet at the start but they balance out later on. Nice imperial stout. 4"
"This beer seems like it would have around 1000 calories, it is one of those beers that you can't possibly down more than 1 of. It is good but could be better and a bit less astringent."
"D: I am a fan of stouts. While I do love the experience of trying this one I'm not sure if I'd add it to my favorites list. It is a little higher alcohol content that I'd like (granted it is an Imperial) and a little too sweet for me. I could see this pared with something... Vanilla ice cream would be good. But, on its own, I feel as if it is a little too much. I cannot fault it because it fits the style of Imperial Coffee Stout well."
"MF&D - the feel is very slick and almost oily. this does not work very well with that cloying sweetness, whenever it chooses to come out: it makes the drinking experience a bit unpleasant. there is a serious lack of carbonation, it is at the bare minimum. but the way that they mask all of that booze is amazing, and despite the odd sweetness at times, I would have another if it werent 13 bucks."
"Mikkeller Black Hole is a solid black beer with a dense, brown sugar colored head that leaves excellent lacing. It has a smokey aroma that's slightly sweet. It kind of smells like a barbeque. It's full bodied; smooth, with a clean finish. The flavor has notes of smoke, barbeque, roast, vegemite, something a little spicy and something a little sweet. This thing is like a complete meal-- very unique!"
"A bit of age would be fun on this one as it may integrate and mellow and even soften and richen these bold flavors. I like this to sip after dinner in lieu of coffee or with a rich flavorful dessert or bold cheese. A very distinctive stout, all about huge coffee and chocolate."
"In short, not worth the $14 price tag."
"2006 vintage (""Best by 14/08/11""). This poured opaque dark mahogany with nearly no head. It smelled very complex like muted coffee and sweet raisins and bitter dark chocolate, with some molasses and licorice and dark cherry, along with a bit of alcohol and plastic (from aging). It tasted like smooth coffee and bitter dark chocolate, with some smokiness and sour cherry and tobacco, and a bit of plastic. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer had tons of depth and complexity, with so many scents and flavors that all played off each other nicely. The body was thin for my taste, but the alcohol was fairly well hidden (probably due to aging). But this is certainly a beer to sip and contemplate and enjoy. I'm curious how this beer is fresh, but it's very nice after 3 years."
"D: I may or may not be able to finish half of this 12.7 oz bottle (fortunately, I'm splitting it with my brother). Interesting and enjoyable to taste, but not for gulping or lengthy drinking sessions."
"Well, go for it...go all the way...oh wow..."
"This is a decent ""extreme"" coffee stout, though it is straightforward as a brew, something this big needs a little more complexity to it."
"Saying all this I will buy it one more time and cellar it for a while. I can see how this beer could change completely with some ageing."
"a year or two may bring some heat down"
"Pours an extremely dark color body, maybe brown, with a tan brown colored head, very small. Strong sweet aroma, dark fruit, molasses. Enticing though, not offputting. Some coffee too, coffee grounds. Some bitterness from the coffee. Coffee taste, followed by some dark fruit, with a sweet coffee aftertaste. Not alcoholy, very tasty. Hides the alcohol extremely well. Somewhat of a dry aftertaste. Damn, this is good! Not a lot of variety of flavor, but this is really tasty. Sweet coffee and only a slight alcohol burn. Soft mouthfeel, somewhat thick tasting."
"Pours a dark black color with a small head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is almost all coffee. Some hints of dark fruit, chocolate. The flavor is very intense with the roast malts. This is extremely sweet, almost too sweet. Hints of cocoa, but almost all coffee in there. Touch of alcohol. The body is very thick and coating. The drinkability didn't do so well with me on this one as the sweetness was too much for me."
"D - An intense beer indeed. Something worth trying and I'll possibly buy more to cellar but not something I'll be drinking with regularity."
"D: over 13% ABV and chock full of intense flavors -- this is not going to be your new session beer. But considering what they were aiming for, the drinkability is commendable. No reservation polishing off a bottle, and can't wait to buy another (though I'll save it for a special occasion)."
"D - This beer doesn't fit the definition of drinkability. High in ABV, and the palette grabbing coffee bite making this beer a one off. Combine it with a little bit of a filling nature, and I have to dock this beer in this category."
"D- Goes down smooth for 13% alcohol, a bit too sweet for my taste but still an overall killer flavor"
"Well the main bad thing to say about this beer is it didn't seem like an imperial stout: it seemed more like a Baltic porter to me. With this much alcohol, it definitely made me sip the beer. It had the more subtle lager type profile that I associate Baltic porters with vs a well balanced stout with a hop kick. It also seemed to have that semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor that I associate with a good Baltic porter. For those that like to curl up with a big dessert stout...this is definitely an A: it's a good beer, but not what I think of as a Russian imperial stout."
"A medium body to this big brew was surprising, as well I didn't find the alcohol very pronounced in any way for 12.1% ABV. A little astringent in the finish but overall drinkability is quite good. I really like this brew and definetely want too try it with some age on it."
"Poured super black with absolutely no head whatsoever. I got vigorous on it at the end but it didn't help. Al i could smell was alcohol in the aroma. That flavor is that of strong coffee and alcohol. I found the overbearing sweetness mixed with the 13% abv to be way too much. Very unbalanced. The feel was moderately thin and slick. Dissapointing."
"Pours opaque black with a cascading tan/brown head comprised of tiny bubbles. Sticky brown lacing. Nose of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream, anise, and a truckload of roasted malt. The big aroma made me want a heavier mouthfeel, but it didn't deliver. Slick, smooth feel with lower viscosity. The taste more than makes up for it. Bittersweet chocolate with a coffee bite rounded out with the roasted malt. Creamy with some sweet vanilla highlights. The alcohol is not well masked, but it only adds to the overall beast of this beer. Wouldn't have wanted it any other way."
"D: A damn solid RIS. Easy to sip and well worth the price tag."
"Strong alcohol presence is the first impression I get from the initial sip. Very sweet taste, considering the aroma. I detect a lot more coffee here...coffee with lots of sugar. Thick and oily with a surprisingly low amount of carbonation. This is certainly a beer that would be difficult to have more than one because of the alcohol content and the richness. It's closer to a dessert beer."
"Very sweet and seeming cloying at times. Very sticky and candied. The milk sugars may be a bit overdone but gives a nice reprieve from the bone-dry Stouts that dominate the market today. Risky with the sweetness, alcohol content, and fruity flavors; this is a needed variant to the beer world."
"D - While I found Black Hole to be a bit too hot and intense, you can't really deny its bold flavor profile."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. It's billed as a coffee stout, but the overwhelming sweetness really hides the roast and bitterness that you'd expect from coffee and makes this feel more like a candy chocolate stout. An interesting beer for sure, but probably not something I'd seek out."
"taste is thick, yet creamy, very strong (maybe too strong), dark chocolate, roasted nuts, licorice, alcohol is present in the back, and slight sour malt, ends dry and very bitter."
"This stout pours a opaque black with a small, chocolate head. It smells mostly of dark fruits, coffee, and a hint of alcohol. The alcohol lingers in the taste, but it is not too sweet. Also there is a sugary coffee flavor that dominates the taste. It would be great without the alcohol though. It's slightly bitter as an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty solid. I enjoy the thickness of the beer and the carbonation. This beer is nice to drink, but at the ABV 1 is plenty, if not a bit much."
"Thanks again d0b!"
"I could sip on this one all night or even a little colder during the summer as an iced sweet coffee."
"The aroma is great with espresso, chocolate, heavily toasted malt, and dark fruit. The appearance is black with a tan head. The flavor is not good. It's like the aroma but too sweet with a burnt coffee finish. The palate is average for the style. Overall it's not one I would buy again."
"This would be a nice warmer in the winter, but it isn't bad on a warm spring night. The 13.1% ABV definitely hit me before I even finished this review. However, the price seems kind of steep for the end result. I will probably not buy it again, but I won't refuse a glass if offered."
"D: Certainly tasty, if not a little sweet and heavy. Hey, its 13%, so I expect this."
"Drinkability I can't even comment on. I finished maybe half of the 375 ml bottle."
"cork reads 01/07/12, drank on 3/15/09 from a bottle in a Duvel snifter."
"Notes - A unique flavor that differs from the aroma in such a way as to remind me of another Mikkeller offering, It's Alright!."
"Very well balanced complex stout. This is a standout beer and maybe number 4 for style."
"D: This is a one and done. I think it would make a great nightcap. But no session should start with this one."
"As far as sippers go, I like this a bit more than the closest thing I can compare it to, a lower-bourbon version of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout."
"Drinkability- One is enough, glad this didn't come in a bigger bottle."
"As another reviewer said, maybe it is meant to be aged. If so, I think it needs at least 5 or 10 years."
"D - Never again, unless it is the only thing available."
"Aroma is absolutely heavenly, at least to me as a porter/stout fanatic: rich, strongly of dark coffee and unsweetened chocolate, with an undertone of molasses. Pours just as black as its namesake with a thick, fine-bubbled, dark tan head. Flavor lives up to the aroma and appearance, like a rick mocha made from fine, dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate. There is even a hint of orange in the flavor. Texture is delightfully smooth and thick as cream. Strongly recommended, especially to my fellow stout nuts."
"Definitely a sipping beer. The alcohol in the flavor is just too overwhelming to take big gulps of this one. Maybe this one is meant to be aged for a long time. At least the bottle is in an appropriate 375 ml size, although a 330 or 210 would be even more appropriate."
"Mouthfeel is fill bodied, heavy, and very smooth."
"Drinkability: A bit brash and a bit hot, but at 13.1% ABV, what do you expect? However, bottles I've had early in it's time line were exponentially harsher, so age has mellowed it some."
"Drinkability: I love Russian Imperial Stouts, but this is a borderline drain-pour for me. Taste is mouth-puckering, and ABV puts a fire in your tummy. Got better as I drank it, but probably just because I had developed a buzz. Too much sugar for me to handle. Proceed with caution."
"D: The Belgian flavors just kill this one for me. It will be a struggle to get through this $11.99 12.7 oz bottle. Maybe it sat on the shelf too long? Not tasty, not horrible, but not appealing. Disappointing. It should get a lower rating than what my numbers reflect. But I've had a few, so it's getting the benefit of the doubt."
"This beer was fairly drinkable, considering its alcohol prowess. A year of aging likely mellowed it out a bit. I definitely would not mind revisiting another bottle with a few more years on it."
"There is very little carbonation in this beer, and with the vicsosity and big alcohol taste, it's a one or two timer for an evening. Especially with the cost. A great beer, but I will lay the next one down for a couple of years, and drink it then. Good entry, but not quite ready yet."
"Pours a crazy black- can't see much through this one with a light mocha head and thin ring of lacing. Nose- big black licorce smell, molasses and dark roast. Taste- licorce, fairly high carbonation, dry roasty finish, medium sweetness,dark fruits and chocolate. Actually not that boozy for the strength."
"2007, 12-oz bottle. Hoo boy. This beer was a hot, hoppy mess. But a good mess. The aroma reeked of booze, so much so that I refrained from standing around open flame for an hour or so after tasting it for fear my breath would catch fire. Sure, 14% isn't all that bad when compared to some of the more extreme beers out there (I'm looking at you, Raison d'Extra), but this is an extraordinarily unrefined 14%. In two years this beer will be phenomenal with the dark molasses-chocolate-caramel-maltiness mellowing out and eating up a bit of the heat, but for now it's just not drinkable in any of practical sense of the word. I'll come back in a couple of years and tell you all how it turned out."
"7/3/7/3/15 (3.5/5)"
"Black, but dark brown around the edges. Quickly receding head. Very roasty and full of booze in the aroma. This seems like it needs some time to mellow, but beyond the booze there is some charcoal, hops, and licorice. Taste is a little green, needs some time on it. Taste is also roasty, with some bitter chocolate and a boozy finish. This may be worth aging, but I won't be loading up on this one."
"Drinkability is ok, this isn't too bad, and the high ABV is well hidden, but it's just not that exciting. For the price, in spite of the heft, not worth it."
"12.7 ounce corked and caged bottle, cork says 01/07/12 on it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention is good, lacing is excellent. It smells like roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I can also taste licorice and dark fruit along with charred/burnt malt. There's also a bitter coffee and hop finish, but it's a bit acidic, too. Mouthfeel/body is full and rich, silky and smooth. Drinkability is good, the alcohol isn't noticable when drinking it but does hit you later. Overall I think this is a good all around RIS. I'd pick one up every once in a while, although the price would prevent me from buying this often."
"a surprisingly big head that dissipates quickly. spots of chocolate lace. black and thick pour. smoky coffee and booze. taste is boozy. goes down quite warm. coffee bitter, hop bitter but not onion. light metal. very minimal light dark chocolate. bit too much for how dense. nice winter drink. smoky quality and alcohol blend well. strong point of the beer."
"Good candidate for a lay-down to mellow out."
"D- the sweetness is hard to get over. its probably the oddest stout ive ever had. not bad, just strange for an RIS. the alcohol is not tasteable, which would make more than one quite dangerous. enjoyable, but not worth the cost."
"Listed at 13.1% abv, so must be a newer version of the beer. Pours black and viscous with very little head. Smells of dark chocolate and brewed coffee with some definite heat to it, but in this case that comes off as a sort of coffee with spirits. The taste is similar, but perhaps a bit more complex. Quite well integrated despite being a bit hot in the taste as well. More coffee and chocolate, clean and pure. Very smooth, but not really all that creamy- this is more like black coffee, dark chocolate, and a good clear brandy- perhaps an aquavit with a clean taste of caraway added. Interesting, and extremely dry. A nice winter warmer in an entirely different vein than most RIS."
"Interesting brew that just didn't come together for me. Not bad, but probably won't get it again."
"D: Very nice drinkability and hardly a trace of its 13.1%abv could make this a dangerous drink. A silky smooth flavor and comes highly recommended. Recently discontinued and a definite must buy if you see it."
"A sipper for sure - this is boozy - wow. Too bad that the acidity and booziness cut through so much that the aftertaste doesn't linger. This has potential, but the raw sharpness and acidity make it very tough to drink, even for a ""sipper"". If it wasn't so acidic, oily/thick and raw, this could be a more enjoyable brew."
"D: One is more than enough. This is a huge beer, tons of body and tons character. This is a true one and done beer, but very enjoyable."
"Unfortunately I was a little buzzed at this point and I spilled the remaining amount of Black Hole from my glass onto Onslow's white carpet...."
"Pours a dark brown/almost black with very little burnt tan head and little lacing. Smells of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, leather, smoke, and red wine. Tastes of chocolate, raisins, cherries, leather, and smoke, with coffee and lots of red wine booze in the finish. Medium-full in body and low in carbonation. Smooth and fruity with some nice roasty notes, but with lots of heat that throw off the flavor and feel. A good brew, but too boozy to really appreciate the other flavors."
"I really liked what was going on with this in both the aroma and flavor departments, as it is quite unique for a RIS, but that nearly 13% ABV is all over this guy. To the point of being overly stinging and distracting from the beer's other qualities. I can take some heat in my beer but this just got to be too much. Tis a shame. Maybe a decade or so in the cellar could help temper the flames somewhat."
"Overall, this brew is fantastic. I wish I had more than one."
"As a side note, someone reviewed this as ""past its prime"". I think that to be absolutely ludacris. It is a stout that has been aged, and matures with more aging."
"Caged and ruber corked 12.7oz bottle. Pours like 3000 mile used motor oil black body hosts an almost three finger rocky chocolate brown head that has nice retention. Leaves scattered lace. Nose has a lot of up front alchol with smokey meaty notes, hints of dill, pine and leathery chocolate. Enters the mouth with a big zesty meaty body with some smoke and chocolate liquer. Alchol really warms the belly well. For an Imperial stout it is very unique with a distinctive hoppy profile that is woodsy and spicey leading to a distinct bitter feel to the mouthfeel. Showing such hops at 13.1% is very cool. The more you drink the more you realize this is super interesting stout, nicely drinkable."
"Think my bottle was past it's peak. Wish I had it in it's prime. Glad I had the oppurtunity though. Not my bag baby."
"the drinkability is decent. it's got some good flavor and complexity in there, but it just doesn't hit the mark. it seems like it needs to be refined a bit."
"D- Its ok, but as far as RIS there are smoother."
"first mikkeller and part1 nightcap for the 1st Stumelagram social ,...wow, very complex..with tar, and chocolate bombs .. enjoyable as a roll in the hay ... very roasty and black .... don't chew the foil ... is truly great tasting stuff... i hope the rest are this good .."
"Is this brew really retired? I just picked up a bottle ($10) at Bruisin' Ales in Asheville, NC last week. Whatever the case, this brew pours a pitch-black color with very little head. The aroma is somewhat complex and fruity, but also smells of some sort of barrel-aging. The taste is quite malty and rich, but I'm also getting a hint of something else. Again, there's an extra hint of something in the flavor which I would normally attribute to barrel aging. I haven't heard that this brew is barrel-aged, yet it has a slight flavor profile like a hint of bourbon barrel and/or wine barrel. There's a fruity character as well which might be attributed to the high-alcohol in this brew. In the end, I like this brew better than the Beer Geek Breakfast, but I still don't like it (and ultimately poured most of it down the drain). Argh! I hate wasting my money!"
"Poured from a 12.7 ounce, caged and corked bottle, the brew pours a jet black with a tan head that settles to a thin mass atop. Upon the nose is coffee, chocolate, and toasted bread. Beginning with the flavor of a fresh brewed dark roast, the flavors of bittersweet chocolate and warming bread shine through. The beer is not as big as I would have thought, even with it's 13.1% ABV. It is very drinkable, and I enjoy every sip as I take it. The guys at Mikkeller have yet to dissappoint me. This one has got to be one of my favorites."
"Pours jet black with a thin mocha head. I wish there was more head and slightly more carbonation. Aroma is filled with coffee and chocolate. The flavor matches the aroma and is blasting with coffee and chocolate. Very rich flavor with decent bitterness from the chocolate. Good thick body. Good cold weather drink but not as good in the hot summer."
"there was on overwhelming bitterness to it, almost sour like. the 13.1% shows big time. all this made for a pretty nasty combination. i like to think some aging could help it out"
"An acrid flavor in the finish really makes this one a below average beer. I had it once and that will be enough. I didnt enjoy this one and with so many awesome Impy Stouts out there, I will pass on this one in the future."
"A very interesting stout. I don't know if I'd classify this as an RIS. It's different than any beer I've ever had. A bit expensive (~$10), but it's worth a try."
"This beer is more drinkable than black, but only just. really, sorry for all the comparisons, but that's the only beer I have to compare it to. This is a must-try if you're near a place that still has it. Good luck."
"Drinkability is low here because of the 12.5% abv."
"this beer is a sipper for sure. it's good for a split and i doubt i could handle more than one of these by myself."
"Drinks pretty much like a 12.5% RIS, if you can stand the booze hotness up front, you have a nice nightcap, Let this warm up a bunch, got better as this did. Pricey; not a bad; a nice take on the style, coffee fiends might appreciate this quite a bit. Would go great with brownies or chocolate chip cookies"
"Foiled artificially corked caged zipped locked welded bottle. No pop or smoke upon opening (shudder) Pours opaque black with decent tan head that leaves pretty good lacing. Nose is mostly burnt coffee and alcohol. Taste is pretty good with some coffee, not as much as I thought there would be. Some chocolate, but I would like much more in here. roasted malt, a bit of vanilla, some good hop bitterness on the finish. There is some dark fruit in here. quite hot yet. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side for the style, and drinkability is limited by the alcohol heat. A good brew certainly, but needs a couple years in the cellar to cool the F*$@ down. I am liking mikkeller more and more, but I'll take a beer geek breakfast over this any day of the week! Good brew though."
"D: A good example of an imperial stout; Mikkeller should be proud iof what they've accomplished with this one. Huge coffee bitterness and a mouthfeel that's so rich; very few RISs will be able to compete with this richness. Still, it's so big that drinkability can't be more than 'good' and a heated alcohol; slow sipping over an 90 minutes +/- is all I can muster. If you find it, grab some for a try."
"Overall, this is a tasty brew, but a bit harsh...it *might* improve with a year or two of aging, but I have a feeling the alcohol might be even more prevalent later down the road. A bold stout from Mikkeller, but the alcohol could be taken down a notch to smooth things out."
"I really didn't enjoy this beer, but it was spared the drain."
"D: It packed a massive coffee flavor that was somewhat over the top. It could use a tad more balance to make it a more sessionalble brew. As is it is a one and one beer. Interesting but not one I'll lust for."
"Buy it and try it!"
"Pours dark black with some light brown tones during the pour. Medium but quite short lived tan head for an Imperial Stout. Smell is quite obviously nicely hopped for the style, with a nice dry roastiness coming in as well. Some alcohol in the nose as well as a bit of aspirin. Taste is dark and roasty, somewhat dry chocolate like and hoppy as well. The alcohol is slightly noticeable but it comes off more like a minty freshness in the mouth and warming in the chest than hot alcohol. Quite pleasant for 14% and very drinkable. Carbonated a bit more than average for the style aiding in drinkability. As it warms, I definitely get a bit of the aspirin like chalky medicinal bitterness too from the hops. That definitely detracted a bit and kept it from being a fantastic beer, yet it is still good."
"This beer impresses from the start: the color is pitch black with a thick, 2-inch, cocoa head. The smell is all hops, no coffee. But the taste is where the coffee jumps out at you: it tastes of a coarse grind dark roast with a gritty, dark chocolate aftertaste. The brew is smooth and rich, and its drinkability changes little through warming up; it stays solid all throughout."
"The mouth is fairly full, very warm, smooth. Right now, I'm lovin it, big time."
"D- First sip I wasn't blown away, but the more I drink of it the more it grows on me. I think it's a nice solid IRS that has a really complex flavor and a burnt malt body."
"I find this to be very drinkable, due to the intriguing and not overly intense taste, as well as the well controlled feel. I think I really like this beer a lot. Too bad I likely won't get more. ABV is nicely disguised but worth noting."
"Drinkability: Suffers a bit from the big ABV. Definitely a sipper. Not bad overall, but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion."
"Poured into a tulip a dark brown/blackish color, minimal carbonation, very nice creamy one-finger plus tannish head, which does leave some nice sticky lacing around. The nose is malty, soury/tangy, slight coffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, sour/tangy, some coffee going on with some caramel. The sourness is really making a big presence in this one. The alcohol is present, not too well hidden. Full body. Drinkable, not bad, but I was expecting alot more, since all of the hype earlier on. Recommended though."
"This turned into a drain pour, just couldn't finish the last of it Reading thru the reviews its almost like there is two different brews here. hard to believe there is such a swing in the opinions on this one"
"Been wanting to try this after hearing all the hype about it and it was a good RIS but not one of the best I have had, especially at its price, strong coffee presence almost made it seem like a porter, would drink again if I got the chance, recommended"
"On the good days, it's a great nightcap, if only because it bludgeons the mouth and anesthetizes the head."
"Drinkability - I'm usually a sucker for a coffee brew. This is okay, but given the dated flavor of the coffee, cellar time may make that worse as coffee wouldn't really improve with age."
"Pours beautifully and with a nice fizzy dark brown head. Coffee aroma hits you right away. Can also sense the alcohol in the scent. That's the killer with this brew: the 13% ABV. It's way too much and it's not covered up by the taste and depth. If they were to rachet the ABV back down to 8-9%, it would make this an outstanding Russian stout. As it is, the burn comes through in the aroma and taste and overwhelms all the other good attributes."
"Drinkability - Use this brew to start up your lawnmower. This beer has no need to be passed through the human body."
"Drinkability/Overall: A fine RIS, though I didn't pick up the coffee behind all the bitter malts and booze. A bit bigger than it needs to be, but a well-constructed beer nonetheless."
"Bottle: Pours with a pitch black body and a tan head. Fair lacing is precnt. Nose of coffee, dark fruit and roasted malt . Flavour is of coffee, chocolate, roasted, malt and liqourice. The texture is oily. Full bodied. It has a slightly bitter finish with some alcohol."
"Ok, I just can't finish my glass...the flavours here are a real mess, imho, and the alc is just *too* much. Other notes: The body is on the thin side, the carbonation is light and it finishes on the sour(not in a good way) side. This will definitely be a one of for me."
"Not a fan. Seems like Mikkeller tried to do too much with this one. I do not see how this is a coffee stout. Unfortunately dashed some pretty high expectations."
"D- Sorry there is too much going on in here for me to want much more than what I am currently drinking. I think they should really try to focus this beer a bit more."
"The initial pour was good and I was anxious for a drink, it was downhill after that. This is my second beer from Mikkeller. The first being Beer Geek Breakfast. I thought that was underwhelming and was hesitant to try another Mikkeller brew. Unfortunately, I bit the bullet and bought Black Hole. It not only left me wanting something different but put a dent in my wallet as well!"
"Definitely a sipper; as it warms it becomes tougher to drink because of the strong alcohol vapors."
"Mikkeller is no exception."
"Overall, this was a tremendously good beer. I was not sure what I was getting into when I tried it, but it was remarkable how good it was. I would have loved to have had another and will do my best to get some more. If this is around you seek it out, it is definitely worth it!"
"This beer was the last one on the shelf.And have not seen one since? Big tan head with good lacing. The nose had fresh ground coco powder and dark roast coffee. The taste: Rich espresso,fresh toasted bread, soft caramel and a mild hop bite.Also I get a roasted nutty flavor that fades into a smoky dry finish.This bottle cost me $10.99 and worth every penny!!"
"Pours a deep opaque black, thin tan head forms, leaves behind some solid lace, settles to a nice layer. Smell is wacky, alcohol, chocolate, piney resin, spices hops, roast, sherry, dark fruits, crazy intense. Taste is raw and insane, raw hops, pine, spicy alchol, chocolate, roasted malt, alcohol, dark fruits, rough but you can tell this will hold up for many years. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost syrupy feeling, low carbonation, warm, pretty crazy stuff."
"Drinkability: Great. This drinks like a sessional beer. This puppy is dangerous in the extreme. One bottle and I feel the booze but I'm not put off by too much sugar or body and would love another body."
"M/D: Full bodied, low carbonation. Low drinkability. I don't know if I picked up a bad bottle or what, but this one is just so off to me. The alcohol is not tasted, but it is so harsh it burns my sinuses, something I have never experienced from any alcoholic beverage. I admit, I had high expectations for this one, but man, it is nearly undrinkable at times. Hopefully, just a bad bottle. I have another that I will hang on to, but I'm not expecting much from it. If it tastes much different, I will revise this review. I am really shocked on how much I do not like this considering how much I had convinced myself I was going to love it."
"I retried this beer on 12/25/2010 and pretty much everything above still stands, even the flatness and strong alcohol presence, almost three years of extra age on it did very little to improve it."
"This is a heady, yet enjoyable stout. The 13.1% is evident but not overpowering. I was pleased with the high hop profile. Try this beer."
"Not too thick, which was nice, enough carbonation to keep it from feeling still. Pretty hard to drink because of all the alcohol (both real and perceived). Glad my friend bought it because it wouldn't have been worth the price tag. If you have it, cellar it. If you see it, pass for something better and cheaper. There are many RIS readily available that fit both characteristics."
"Did not enjoy this one."
"D: Excellent melding of the flavors and nose. Flaming hot alcohol comes on very strong the longer it stays in the glass and warms the nostrils, tongue, throat, esophagus, and stomach. Awesome!"
"Smell is a bit of chocolate, and some bittering hops. The hops seem to dominate the show and not let the other flavors come through. Mouthfeel is pretty nice and creamy. Plenty of beer in the states here that our at least comparable in the style. Glad I got to try, but not my cup of tea."
"This is my second beer from Mikkeler the first being Beer Geek Breakfast. The beer poured a dark black with a huge, frothy tan head. The head stuck around for a while and the lacing was great. The aroma was coffee and roasted malts. The taste was again of coffee with surprising tastes of vanilla, chocolate and a almost winter green hint in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was heavy with little carbonation and I could barely make out the alcohol despite the high ABV. Overall a fantastic beer. Much better than beer geek breakfast!!"
"Reviewed my second bottle I bought a year later, wow,--complex,smooth, alcohol had settled down to produced a completly smooth Imperial stout. I wish Mikkeller was more readily avaliable"
"Label has the ABV at 13.1%."
"Pours syrupy pitch black. Little head, carbonation, or lace at this strength. Rich espresso, sweet chocolate, and dark-fruit aroma with big heady alcohol vapors. The flavor lacks the chocolate sweetness, features dark-roasted coffee and charred bread notes instead. These meld into a very strong medicinal prune alcohol finish that somewhat numbs the mouth and burns the throat. Thick and weighty in the mouth; rather creamy with spare carbonation. Somewhat undone by its high strength, but remains a nice beer to linger over on a very long winter night."
"Tasted with 5 other imperial stouts. Pours deep black with a small brown head. The aroma is sweet with caramel, chocolate and some mild coffee. The taste has all those plus a bit of wood and a definate alcohol presence. The aftertaste lingers with a bit of bitterness. First tried in a small american style pint glass. This got better poured in to a Duvel glass. The only thing keeping this from being perfect was the fact I had already had 5 strong stouts. I am going to try this on its own for a final rating. Definately on of the best beers I have ever had."
"14/08/11 was printed on the cork. It poured a very dark brown with mahogany edges and a fine, brown cap of foam that thinned to a ring and skim of bubbles. Decent head retention, some spotty lacing. The aroma was quite hoppy, with some powdery grapefruit character. Caramel and roast, with a bit of chocolate, were hiding in the background. Moderate bitterness with lots of sweet, malty caramel. Grapefruit hops and chocolate filled out the flavour with a mellow alcohol finish. Heavy body with fine, well-integrated carbonation. Carbonation was a bit low and it had a creamy texture. Plenty of warmth and a bit of dryness from the dark malts. Tasty stuff! Great texture and easy drinking considering the abv. Alcohol was pronounced, but was short of being hot. Still, some time might do this one a bit of good."
"Bottle courtesy of fonefan: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium foamy dark brown color head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma is vinous with some raisins and sweet malt. Taste is quite intensely sweet with notes of raisins and alcohol notes are also discernable. Full body with some medium carbonation with an oily texture. While I think I understand the intent of the brewer I found that this beer was way too sweet and too much alcohol was apparent."
"I would highly recommend this beer. A big thanks to SurlySober for sharing the bottle he received from LiquidSolutions."
"Roasted bitter flavors up front. Coffee and dark chocolate. Smoky, kind of peaty flavor follows. Then the palate explodes into rich, sticky coffee/espresso and moderately hot alcohol. Coffee bitterness and alcohol sweep away the finish. Very warming. A bit like a coffee liqueur. This one's a sipper! Full, oily, thick feel. Dry in the finish. Glad I got to try this, but I would only buy this again to share with others as one bottle is a lot for one (this) person!"
"Hell of a strong coffee beer here but drinkability is limited. Not going to be downing a liter mug of this anytime soon. It is good but one bottle will trash your taste buds."
"Booze is not apparent in the flavor but it really warms the whole body. A pleasant brew for winter nights."
"drinkable?: not really.. cook a chickenable?: VERY!"
"Alcohol: It's there but I think that they did a great job blending it in with the beer. Label states 13.1% and the info. above says 12.5%, hmm."
"375 ml bottle.Do they even make a 750ml?Aroma like Jaegermeister meets Starbucks, but in a good way. A decent head for a stout, but not a huge one from an absolute point of view. Damn tasty, but, if youre in California, the North Coast Old Rasputin Imperial Stout is probably better value for money. Elsewhere, this is a fine alternative."
"The drinkability is very nice but gets even better as it warms, Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: I so very glad I was able to get a few more bottles. I can't wait to see what a year or more does to the carbonation and alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is a dark, creamy, and slightly oily. Very smooth and enjoyable. Great evening sipper"
"Classic jet black. The orginal, the eternal black hole. I absorbs all light, with only a little a little beige ring o' foam to offset the black hole. Fresh , yet cool coffee with toastd and roasted malts. Smells bitter, but because of the deep roast. Smells dark, and inviting. The taste starts with the dark roast of malts, that then turn to French roast of coffee almost like espreso. ints of smoke as well. Ver thick palate. Perfect for an fter dinner, or nightcap. You can taste and feel the alcohol, but thats a good thing."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"A big beer for sure, but the coffee is a bit harsh, and leaves the beer tasting like a coffee stout rather than an Imperial with coffee."
"Pours pitch black. Nice tan head that never comes close to getting out of control. mild, but slightly noticeable roasted aroma with some chocolate there as well. Flavor makes this extremely drinkable. Goes down smooth as can be. The alcohol seems to be hitting me very quickly here. A higher tone of sweetness than I would have figured. Nice thick malty edge, but not as much coffee as I would have thought coming through. Molasses seems to really peek out as time goes on. Alcohol might be interfering a bit here. Slick on the tongue with a low carbonation. This is a hearty imperial stout. I just dont feel like it has as much character as I was expecting."
"Pours black with a small reddish caramel head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma is a nice dry roasty and nutty coffee bean scent along with an acidic tanginess. There is also a nose hair scorching bourbony alcohol in the aroma, and very mild hints of chocolate. Taste is dry and smoky roastiness and bitter coffee followed by a tanginess that mixes with strong anise and pine flavors. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy in body although any sweet malts are kept in check by the huge roasted flavors and the very large drying, burnt bitterness in the finish, alcohol warms the throat in the finish as well. A good beer, maybe a touch on the bigger side for how I would like a coffee beer to be, the roasty tanginess is quite powerful. Will be interested to try this again with some age on it."
"Had again 1.5 years later and the coffee was prominent, rich aged. Bittersweet."
"EDIT: This is really the only Mikkeller brew I've had thus far that seems to take a Belgian approach to a US style. The others mirror our own offerings with minor tweaks only. I find those suit my tastes a lot more than this one."
"Overall impression: A big, alcoholic Russian Imperial Stout. I didn't get much coffee but I think it was masked behind the esters. I could easily see laying this down 1-3 years. Dangerously close to being unbalanced but very good. My lips and palate are numb. Almost like a black barleywine."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Pours a pitch black motor oil with a chocolate head that is sticky and lacy. Smells like chocolate covered fruit with some expresso. Taste is hot, lots of chocolate, dark fruit and a bitter hop finish. Thick in the mouth with a nice smooth finish. A sipper and needs some age. This has a bite that will tame with a year and generous flavors that need some time to mingle."
"Big thanks to Zack for busting out the goods."
"Pours a thick, slow oil like black color with a creamy rich dark brown head. Leaves a little lacing, but mostly dies down to leave a black liquid in my glass. Smell is very strong with molasses, toasted malt, some Strong coffee and a little dark chocolate. The flavor on this one is Bitter with a capital B. Mouthfeeling reminds me of eating some coffee beans as it feels dry and heavy with plenty of carbonation. This one is extremely hot, and I want to see if a little aging can improve this one."
"Overall: A unique brew from a unique brewer. I enjoy what Mikkeller does an it's a good thing that I can now get their beers locally. Search this one out, it's like no other stout I have ever tasted before."
"Drinkability is superb for a beer this size. Alcohol is noticable but doesn't interfere at all. Good stuff here. Just needs more aroma. Would be nice if the coffee showed up a bit more, too."
"A very interesting stout but overly bitter and a bit hot. Some age might help this one."
"12.7 oz bottle (green bottle). Pours pitch black with a 1 cm head that is mostly diminishing, bubbly, and brown. Aroma of coffee, licorice, and a hint of caramel and maybe plums. Initial flavors include dark fruits, coffee, and a little brown sugar. Flavor ends with hops and alcohol along with lesser amounts of the initial flavors. Medium body, light carbination, with a lasting aftertaste. Well hidden alcohol content, would guess around 8%. Glad I tried it, but I think it may be a little over rated. Looks and smells better than it tastes. And what is with the green bottle?"
"Well balanced and very drinkable for a 13.1% stout. Pretty expensive at $10 a bottle. It's hard to pick this up when I can get a bottle of Abyss or two bottles of Stone's RIS for the same price."
"This is a great beer. Again very very hoppy but the thick saturated roasty quality comes through two fold on the mid palate and finish which is tannic from the roast and bitter from the hop. Citrusy dark fruits, with hints of coffee and a touch of mollasses. Mouth has a very lively spritz to it that I don't really like for this style of beer. Sit on this for six months to a year and it will only get better."
"overall, this is an excellent beer for its category. would be killer after a large meal. great nightcapper."
"drinkability is ok. the alcohol is a bit hot and the hops are pretty strong, making it a bit out of balance, but this will probably be excellent with some time for it to all mellow and mesh together. still, a great beer that was quite nice fresh."
"Best when slightly chilled but before reaching room temperature."
"Overall, this one is not very well balanced - too much harsh tarry alcohol, and not enough coffee (I didn't get any in the flavor). It's a bit over-priced for me at $10 for 12.7 oz."

"Bottle. (79/100)(thx to Henrik P.) It pours jet black, with a small brown head. Chocolate, coffee, burnt malt, a little fruityness and hops in both aroma and flavor. Theres some alcohol as well in the flavor. Full, sweet body. Theres alcohol, chocolate, some coffee, fruits and hops in the finish. It is one hell of a beer, but it lacks a little bit to reach the level of x-imperial stout 2006, hence the slightly lower rating. Lovely. Seriously hope they do another batch of this. (070510)"
"Really hoppy, especially after the mid-palate. In fact, Id say that the hops play the dominant role in this beer after that point. The finish, along with being really hoppy, also shows some nice malt as well and overall, the finish is quite nice and seems to be last a long time."
