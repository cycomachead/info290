"DATE TASTED: April 7, 2015... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter.. OCCASION: celebrating the O’s opening day win while watching the NCAA finals... APPEARANCE: ominous black body that allows a swiftly simmering brown head to halo at the glass ... AROMA: powerful rum, vinous port, strong Spaltz and chocolate make for an inviting complexity--not to mention the roasted malts that provide a wicked balance... PALATE: smooth, slick, a bit dry, yet full-bodied--a paradox resolved only through a beautifully lingering aftertaste... TASTE: chocolate, roasted cracker, slight alcohol in a whiskey-like allure; the components make for a rich, dark, strong stout that is sweet and rewarding; some nut, raisin and cask wood further the experience...OVERALL: Once more, another brewery that does so little wrong--this beer commands the taste buds with strength and subtlety, rewarding the drinker with a sweet, powerful sip..."

"O -  A great drink with ample flavour and clearly a winner for those who like big taste."

"I like the head, the lace, and most certainly the body--very solid. However, the taste has a tangy finish. I wasn't crazy about this one."
"Drink this beer with your mouth hole. Appearance is black in the natural light. Lovely fuggle aroma and light hop bittering. Tastes and feels like a smooth cold coffee."
""
"Overall: This stout has the typical hallmarks of imperial stouts - sweet roasty chocolatey maltiness and a dark fruity acidity with a moderate bitterness.  What is most different from american imperial stouts I've had is that it's not as thick and sweet. Also, accounting for the lower ABV, it is less boozy. The flavor balance is really remarkable - proof that you don't need a crazy high ABV to achieve an exceptional imperial stout."

"Overall-  A 7% percent imperial stout is a unique thing to see, but regardless as a stout this is a great beer.  The orange/cherry aspect gives this a really nice flavor dynamic with the roasted malt, espcially as it warms.  Overall, this is very flavorful and easy to drink, and its definitely worth revisiting."

"Bottle.  This was a great beer.  Appearance dark brown.  Wish the aroma had a little more oomph.  I did not get the fruits many document.  Maybe it was just me that day but otherwise this stout packed a lot of well balanced flavor.  Coffee rose above chocolate and malts.  A great blend.  Creamy and delicious.  Can't wait to see if the next one lives up to the first!"

"Had a cellared version and a fresh one side by side. Okay for a imperial stout. Nothing special."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic.  Dark, rich in flavor, and smooth going down, it's what a stout should be.  Perfect balance of bitterness and coffee/chocolate tastes.  Superb."
""
""
""
"Aroma of dark malts, chocolate, toffee, dark fruit. Taste dark chocolate, roasted malt, faint coffee & smokeyness, licorice."
"Pitch black pour with a one finger caramel-colored head with minimal retention and decent lacing.  The nose is roasty with a subtle sweetness along with hints of licorice, espresso, toffee, molasses, and a touch of dark fruits.  The taste follows suit with hints of roasted malt, dark chocolate, molasses, espresso, dark fruits, licorice, and leather.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a nice bittersweet finish and great drinkability.  Overall, another solid offering from Samuel Smith's."
"Heck yes!  This is one outstanding real Russian style beer!  Amazing!"
""
"O – Fairly complex and enjoyable flavor profile, would like a little more bitterness for balance."

"Looks like a great stout. Smell is chocolate, raisins, must, and feet. Taste is cleaner but fairly plain and one dimensional. Mouthfeel is the strong suit, silky smooth and very chewy."
""
""
"Overall: very good imperial stout, a complex blend of flavors that make it a good winter sipper, with less alcohol than other beers within this genre. I enjoyed it, though there are several great American RIS that I’d prefer (at a more reasonable price point!) My current fave is the Yeti imperial Stout – very similar in complexity with a sweeter profile, cleaner palate and a bit higher ABV."
""
""
"A bit pricey, but definitely worth it.  T: toasty malt with a hint of coffee. S: burnt chocolate and alcohol. M: full flavored malt profile. Very tasty.  I will definitely get more next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: I have to say that this is one of the more impressive beers that I have had.  Many RISs try to be so over the top with ABV and flavors that they become a bit overwhelming.  Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout combines perfect ABV, flavor, and mouthfeel to make a must try beer!  Classified as a Russian Imperial Stout @ 7% ABV.  Consumed 1/8/2014."
""
"This is excellent. It has a nice creamy if not oily feel to it. Tastes like it'd have a bigger ABV. Overall, I'm very impressed and will certainly get it again."
""
""
"Overall solid, but not feeling the love entirely.  Interesting but probably not something I will re-visit again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this one a few times now and I just can't behind those flavors. I think its the yeast, which comes off as a bit Belgian to me. I think it needs less yeast and more roast."
"Finish is subtle but long; classic stout flavors"
"I have to say, this was not at all what I was expecting from a very classic imperial stout. Maybe it's because I'm used to the amped up American versions here in the states. I'm going to have to try to get a hold of some more classic English examples of this style to see if this is what it's supposed to be. I have another bottle that I'm going to try in a few months. Lets see if I can find a Courage RIS to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm honestly a little disappointed in my first entry from Samuel Smith. Although they completely nail the sweet, milky chocolate in the taste, I wasn't moved by any other aspects of the taste. Still a good Stout, but not what I had hoped."
""
""
"Overall a truly excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer by samuel smith. Alot of raisin  and grape. pretty good."
"Pours a fine looking opaque black and viscous looking liquid. The head's color is even more intriguing; a frothy and bubbly tan head retains well as a sticky lace that reminds me of cappuccino foam. The aroma is unbelievable! Espresso, chocolate, banana or raisin bread and roasted malty sweetness. Taste has elements of sweet roasted malts, creamy coffee, and balanced by a slightly dry and very subtle bitter finish. Carbonation is lively on the tongue and settles as drink,gets warm. A full bodied drink; excellent to warm up to in cold weather and to eat with chocolates. I have been equally impressed with all of Samuel Smith's products, and this one might be my favorite thus far."
""
""
""
""
"†The “R” is short for “Russian” comrade."
"Overall - The alcohol in this beer, for some reason, is very prominent (more prominent than the 7% content would suggest). Because the alcohol is so prominent, this stout lacks the creamy smoothness that the genre is known for. I'm aware of the fact that the word ""Imperial"" suggests a high alcohol content but this beer taste more like a barley wine than a stout. This beer is not bad but it's not what I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An absolute stunner - I'm fortunate enough to live about 5 miles from the Sam Smiths brewery so this is fairly easy for me to get and a regular on my Beer Shelf. It's not really something you could have a session on, but the flavours and feel are such that it's extremely easy to knock a few of these back and get absolutely plastered in the process. It may only be a small bottle, but it manages to pack in a monstrous amount of flavour."

"Overall - This beer is raising the bar on beer like your loser brother raises his consciousness when he drops acid. This is probably the most amazing imperial stout I have ever had, it is so balanced, drinakable, and smooth. No amount of superlative speech can describe this brew. You need to try this one immediately if you like stouts or dark beer at all. Game changer."

"Pours a pitch black in color with a good 3-finger beige head that settles finally down to a 2mm head after about 20 mins of sipping on it. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen that clings all the way up the sides of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, dark fruit (plums?) with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. The taste has even more going on that starts out with the roasted malts at first, with a slight sweet raisin-like taste than ends with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Actually very smooth and goes down easy. Medium+ bodied but a tad below average for carbonation that is good for this style of brew. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I have tasted."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 13F). Bottle 36cl - Batch L14023. AROMA: roasted aromas mixed with port-like vinous notes. chocolate aromas and dried fruits (figs). APPEARANCE: black and opaque with a Brown head with average retention. slight legging. TASTE: roasted malt, chocolate, strong coffe and slight dried dark fruits. faint hop flavours and some vinous like notes. medium-low bitterness with a relatively sweet finish. low alcohol warmth. PALATE: medium body with low alcohol warmth. medium carbonation. OVERALL: an intense and complex imperial stout with a good range of aromas and flavours. lacks a bit of body and alcohol presence."

"O- Looked good, smelled good, but did not deliver on the tongue. I was somewhat disappointed, maybe if I had not drank it chilled it would have been better. Oh well, next time I will not refrigerate it and try again (3.5)"
""
"This was very good. Some interesting toffee notes, etc on the nose, however the deep, full flavors and dark roasty nightmares I expect in an RIS were a bit lacking. That said, this is a really nice beer, and I would definitely drink again (esp. if I were out of my homebrewed RIS!)."
""
""
"I would gladly have this again, but I'd say think of this as a bigger single porter or a smaller imp stout..."
""
""
"Second time I have bought this. English ""bomber"" sized bottle. Raisin to the extreme, even prune juice. That sounds horrid, but this is indeed a great beer. Definitely works.  The Brits know what they are doing I suppose, after all those years.  I'm an IPA guy and still like this one. Like a Guinness Stout that has some extreme flavors going on. Intense.  Complex. Nuff said."

"Overall: A little let down by the flavor. and I must say, the flavor is the biggest factor in a beer to me. But, just because I was a little let down does not mean this is not a good beer. I always get excited about an RIS and always expect the world. RIS's always score big with me, and this is no exception."
""
""
"O: Nose is weak for an Imerial Stout. The mouthfeel is watery for an I.S. I prefer a coffee or chocolate forward I.S."
""
""
"O: A very nice, well-balanced stout bursting with chocolate and dark fruit."
""
""
"This was not a typical imperial stout. It has a good look, but the smell and taste is overwhelmingly choclately, with little of the hoppy roastiness that typical RIS boasts. Some of this may be the result of the unusually low ABV of 7%. It is still a very good beer, but anyone looking to buy this would be well-advised to purchase a single first if he can. I bought an entire 4-pack for $10 at Total Wine, and it just hasn't really panned out for me."

"335 ml. bottle. Pours an opaque black clour, with a tan head that lasts forever and leaves a ring all around the glass. Smell is impressive: chocolate is predominant, but there's caramel, dark fruits, port wine, vanilla, liquorice, and ome coffee. Taste is more or less the same, chocolate everywhere, with coffeemore noticeable than in the nose, caramel, dark fruits and vanilla. The only that doesn´t do it justice, IMO is the medium body and thin palate. Anyway, a great beer."

"O - very good, the coffee and roasted malts are very warming, and the mouthfeel is perfect for a stout. The smell put me off, as I am not an aniseed fan. Stay clear if its hot summer months, this is the winter warmer!"
"d: in my opinion, this beer has improved and mellowed with age and as it last lost some of those burnt notes, it has gained some great fruity notes and really found a warm spicy balance."

"Overall: As with most English beers, I find this light compared to American examples that I'm use to. However, it is extremely balanced and I'll grab this again when I'm in the mood for a drinkable yet balanced and flavorful Imperial Stout. Not to mention affordable at $5 a ""bomber"". Can't go wrong!"
""
""
""
"This is a classic and very accessible beer, and perhaps the best beer available in my area (and actually kinda cheap!). It is very unique and complex, and should be savored. I gotta remember to load up on this at Christmastime. Cheerio!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very nice beer, can taste cherry malt, hints of light and dark chocolate. really creamy feel, aroma is sweet subtle chocolate, very nice to smell and taste simultaneously. medium bodied so not a huge viscous stout. reminds me more of an ""export stout"" like Guinness export"
""
""
""
""
"overall this is an excellent stout. i have no real complaints, however decoding that date in the store could be a problem. and if it was old i would take it back, being an inconvenience. a great imperial stout being more towards the light side, ABV wise."
"Overall, a fantastic beer from an English brewery that I just love. Proof positive that a Russian Imperial Stout doesn't need loads of alcohol content to have tons of flavor and interest-generating potential. And this one is great in that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's a wonderful thing that you can just go to most respectable beer stores and grab this one off the shelf. In fact, you should do it if you haven't."

"Pours a dark brown with a creamy brown head. It dissipates fairly quickly leaving a bit of lacing. Smells of chocolate, dark fruits and bit of coffee. Those same things follow to taste with some alcohol. A touch of bitterness that increases a bit as it warms. Nice oily mouth. This has everything you want in a stout."

"Overall, this is an exceptional, affordable, delicious imperial stout. Doesn't kill you with too many heavy flavors or too much booze. This is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown to black, opaque. When you pour it, the carbonation cascades. Head is ample. Smells like fermented raisins and fruit - magnificent. The taste comes out best at warmer temperatures: the full roasted flavor can overpower the palate if swilled. When sipped and tasted first from the tip of the tongue, you get the full effect. The hops balance the roasted fruit flavor. Very pleasant feel. The drinking experience matches the beer's reputation as a classic - love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome, awesome, awesome. Nice complexity and balance. The smokiness and vanilla make this different. Also, more affordable than some of the other imperial stouts."

"A beautiful complex imperial stout, really good."

"Poured from a classic Samuel Smith's bottle into a goblet. I am a major advocate of this brewery, appreciating the unique yeast and diacetyl character of their brews as well as the malt complexity. This is probably one of the top Russian imperial stouts in the world, providing a supreme balance of deep, rich malt flavors, sweetness, and perhaps surprisingly prominent hop flavors, hitting all these targets without going out of balance. Pours a Stygian opaque black with a few reddish highlights here and there, with ample rich tan foam. Releases an assertive admixture of buttery, chocolate, coffee, roast barley, and toasty aroma notes, roughly in that order. Tastes of chocolate brownie, caramel sauce, freeze-dried coffee crystals, plums, smoked corn husk, light rum, wood, Samuel Smith house yeast and earthy, grassy hops with maybe a hint of citrus rind. Incredible complexity of flavor with the expected heavy, thick body and low to moderate carbonation. The alcohol burn is there but less harsh and astringent than some American examples of the style. I appreciate the refined and measured approach to a ""big beer"" and this epitomizes that ideal."
""
""
""
"Overall: Bow down to this classic. I put one in the cellar, plan on trying with a year on it, but this one is remarkable fresh. The great balance and fullness of flavor make this one stand out from the other Imperials."
""
""
"O:Incredibly complex and very well blended in an unusual way. I want another quaff to see what else I can find in it. Smiles. Very robust. Complex. Well rounded. Balanced. Very Unique. Unusually well constructed to be able to put all of this into one beer. I would recommend this to anyone as an incredible execution of style. Not for the faint of tongue. Definitely an acquired taste and not a way to introduce ANYONE to craft beer!!!"
"This is a very good beer."
"Smooth mouthfeel, the alcohol is hidden very well by the flavours and overall it's a great beer with few equals in it's style."

"As this style has become so popular in the U.S., I have been purchasing it more and more to compare this classic to its competitors in the States. With few exceptions, I would say this is the superior choice, with its lovely, oily texture; frothy head; and complex flavor profile, with notes of toasted malts, raisins, plums, and a hint of chocolate. Only examples from Founder's and Goose Island's Bourbon County line can match this classic, in my opinion."
"Black as night. Minimal head retention,but what remains is a light brown in color. Aroma of plums, fig,and black licorice. Creamy and silky mouthfeel. I get loads of roasted barley with a sweetness of plums and figs. You get a warmth of alcohol and a lingering bitterness in the end."
""
"O: Not very pleased with this beer, granted it was only round 1. I enjoyed the Oatmeal Stout and Taddy Porter much much more than I did this, which isn't what I was expecting. Perhaps I drank the only tainted bottle in the pack, or perhaps I just don't have the taste buds for the product they produced."
""
""
""
"O - This is an excellent stout and has become one of my favorites. I am a fan of stouts and this is by far one of my favorites in this style."
"Overall: mouthfeel is the highlight for me. ill have to try and find a fresher bottle to see if the metallic taste in uncharacteristic. but otherwise a very good and tasty RIS that is very well balanced"

"Imperial Stout pours a black color with very little head. There is a strong aroma with lots of creamy notes, and a strong roasted and coffee notes.

"The price is kind of steep on this beer, but it's pretty exceptional. For my preferences, this may be the best Russian Imperial Stout that I've ever had. At the same time, I'd probably pick other options more often just because this one's (fairly significantly) more expensive. Must try."
""
""
""
"O - For a Russian Imperial Stout this is pretty one-dimensional. A lot of red wine flavor but not much of anything else. Maybe I'm just spoiled here in the US with Stone RIS and Old Raspy but I wouldn't buy this again."

"overall: A great example of an English Stout. However, i'm not a huge fan of English beer. I studied there for 3 months with hopes of getting into their style of beer, but it never grew on me. WHile a great stout I can drink all day, and will buy again, it in no way compares to it's US counterparts such as Stone IRS, Bells Expedition or Black Note, Founders KBS, BS, CBS, and many more. It's a great brew that I can respect, just not my style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a fan. The off flavors really ruin this beer. I hope it's just a bad bottle, but who knows. I will try this again sometime down the road, but will prefer to seek this out on draft."
"O- A solid imperial stout, it's tasty, and although the flavor isn't massive and the body is a bit thin, it's still a great beer for the price point."
""
""
"On the positive side, it's quite a creamy carbonation with a substantial mouthfeel. From the 500 ml bottle bought at a random liquor store."

"a fantastic rendition of an English version Russian imperial stout. textbook really. the pour is thicker and darker, but some light can still enter, and the head is sudsy and lasting, just off white. the nose is bittersweet, with plenty of chocolate malt and pushing burnt bitterness. in terms of flavor, the first sip or two are by far the best. vanilla and cocoa together, but not as intense as some American versions. the malt is really allowed to shine here, and glorious woody bitter notes come through thick and creamy. it gets a little thinner and washed out as it moves along, but its still damn good. chocolate and light bittering hops kick in on the back end. plenty drinkable, at a lower abv for the style and a really smooth texture. not nearly as full bodied as they come on this side of the pond, this is a brew I could have several or more of, and could easily be a regular in my refrigerator. I have no complaints other than a slightly underwhelming carbonation presence and it getting a little watery as it warms, but that's me being annoying. one of the best sam smith beers, which is definitely saying something."
""
""
"must've eluded me in the past. Either that, or I got an odd bottle. Great malt character, though. Not overly bitter, by any stretch, nor overly sweet. Well balanced. But that acetone character is offputting. Minus that, it's an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall my favorite Samuel Smith beer and a real winner, especially for the price!"
""
"Poured 500mL bottle into 34oz mug. Pitch black with dark, dark brown on the edges in light, with a thin dark brown head that doesn't stick around. Smell is similar to the oatmeal stout; mostly yeast, but with a hint of chocolate. Taste is very clear, coffee and chocolate malt with a pretty clean finish. Mouthfeel is full yet fizzy. Delicious."
""
""
"O: A brew fit for a king. This RIS is exceptional and comes with a price tag that won’t offend the common folk. Samuel Smith’s continues to prove its world-class status. This is a must have for winter months or as an after dinner treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer, perfect balance. One to be savored slowly, feasting on every sip."

"I'm a big fan of Sam Smith's chocolate stout, the imperial did not disappoint either. Unlike most imperials, this is very dry, and more bitter. Lots of roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and cappuccino. Just a touch of brown sugar sweetness. My only real qualm is is a bit light and watery for an Imperial, and has almost no head. Overall very good, and a nice reprieve from the usual diabetes bombs that are most imperial stouts."
"Overall: Really enjoyable beer. It's just plain good"
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium to thick bodied. Moderate carbonation. Drinks better with a little warmth. No alcohol presence. Astringency is mainly due to bitterness of dark roasted malts. Excellent character."
""
""
""
""
"Like I said, this beer is not for all beer drinkers. It is bitter, but not enough to turn me away. Although drinking two of these in a row might be a challenge for me. Really, the only way to know it to take that leap and check it out! If you know the style is not to your liking already, so be it. You can always convince your publican to give you a taster. Just get out there. Try new beer! You don't want to be on your death bed regretting that you didn't taste a piece of history when you could have do you?"

"Truly a Hardcore Stout Lovers Manly Beer and not made for wimpy Milk and Oatmeal Stout Lovers like myself. As they would say in the south, this will put hair on your chest."
"O: Nice solid RIS. Not mind blowing but very very good for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A quality beer, but I don't think I can consider it ""Imperial."" A moderate ABV, and a mild flavor base makes it just seem like a stout. If it were any drier, I would even consider it dry irish."
""
""
""
""
""
"For an Russian Imperial Stout , this is really drinkable as it cuts off at the end. I would recommend it as an entry into the style. However, I do love it as someone who has had a few, so it's for all. Just maybe not those heavy heads into the deep deep rich flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - To me it's just an average RIS. Great value tho."
""
""
"After drinking a lot of barrel-aged monster-stouts from the West side of the Atlantic, it's interesting coming back to this classic. Nothing tastes like it, and it has a lot of the creamy, chewy qualities that their American brethren only pick up from the aging process. This always hits the spot...it's nice that it's pretty easy to pick up."

"Damn good beer and should be drank with one of Coltranes incredible versions of the modal composition - Impressions or maybe LL Cool J Momma Said Knock You Out! if thats more of your flavor flav."
"550 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/10/2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big apple, raisin, dark chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, light char, and herbal earthiness. Decent aromas with some good complexity; but the fruity aromas are a bit too overpowering, something went wrong with this bottle. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, toffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted malt flavors; with a good amount of balanced fruity complexity; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, lightly slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial stout style. Good balance and robustness of roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering; despite the obvious flaws with this particular bottle."

"It s one of the best stout I ever tried, even if I am not a fun of imperial stout."

"Absolutely delicious - I love the fact that the sweetness is so restrained - it doesn't have to be an after-dinner beer. Best Samuel Smith offering I've had so far - I'd rate this higher than the Oatmeal Stout, which I also greatly enjoyed - I found that this has greater depths of flavour."

"Samuel Smith Imperial Stout is not a great RIS, but it's still a great stout. Flavorful and light enough to be paired with food without being overwhelming."
"O-One of my favorite RIS. Not as complex as the new takes in the style but an old standby that holds its own"
""
""
""
"A nice RIS from Samuel Smith's but not amongst my favorites. A bit shallow IMO."
""
""
""
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout ---4.5/5"
"O: As I said, my favorite example of an Imperial Stout with a flavor profile exceeding it's price tag. A no-brainer selection if you find yourself indecisive at your beer retailer of choice."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I'd say this was closer to a regular stout than an RIS. I'm simply not a fan of this brewery. It was pretty average."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Great, complex stout. There's so much going on, but the flavors don't fight with each other, but work together. Lemon rind in espresso, soy sauce, typical stout flavors. They all compliment. Really a beer worth seeking out."

"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Great looking motor oil black pour with an inviting 1+ finger of mocca head. Retention was nice and decent lacing . Smell was true to RIS form. Deep/dark fruits (raisins, figs, molasses) with a bit of chocolate and coffee on the end. Not very strong on the nose, but adequate. Taste was very smooth with the blend of the fruits that faded into the coffee characters. A little burnt wood, earthy note to close out. Nice subtle hop aftertaste to keep you coming back for more. Feel was a bit light for a RIS. A bit on the watery side, but this improved as the beer warmed. Overall- I had heard great things about Samuel Smith and it didn't disappoint. I found this to be a very spot on RIS. Loved the combination of big dark fruits and hints of coffee and chocolate. Complex and tasty. A definite must try and perfect for a cold December evening-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: A great, rich, flavorful stout. Loses a little bit on the body/mouthfeel but otherwise this is just all around tasty. A lot of these Samuel Smith beers have a similar flavor profile, and with that in mind I'd probably go for the Oatmeal Stout or Taddy Porter over this, but it's still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is black with an inch of oily beige head. Lasting retention and plenty of lacing. The aroma offers molasses, malt, roast, dark chocolate. The flavor is chocolaty and rich with molasses and hints of dark fruit. The feel is velvety smooth and creamy with some light bitterness in the finish. Overall, this was solid and tasty. I would buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is much too dry and muted, and the Sam Smith house yeast character almost totally eclipses the malt. Probably my least favorite Samuel Smith beer so far."

"Imperial Stout A very well made, tasty and very rich, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice complex imperial stout with good balance. The plum and black cherry gives a distinct character to the beer. Very drinkable."
"O: This is pretty solid, and I got it for cheap at my local Central Market. This might have to be a go-to stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into tulip glass. Looks black with rocky tannish-brown head. Smells roasty with notes of molasses, coffee, vanilla, cocoa & dark cherries. Tastes great with waves of chocolate and vanilla. Nice lucious mouthfeel - tastes like a grown up milkshake. Just superb. Nice sharp hop bite which evens out malt sweetness. Does have an odd smell that's appealing in the same regard. Maybe treacle or old dusty wood. Seems to have some wood character but I'm not even sure if this was aged in barrels or not. A great brew nonetheless. Glad to have finally tried this one."
""
"Trying not to compare this to the absurd American Imperial Stout/American RIS is hard. This drinks thinner than most standard American stouts and the British water and yeast are distracting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This brew looks great, smell has a good complexity to it. Taste was very straight forward and typical of an Imperial Stout, it hit every tenet of the style. Full bodied but not over the top. Great representation of the style that I appreciate to be able to find easily."

"One of the better stouts that I have tried. Obviously not as strong as the Brooklyn Double Chocolate but it did remind me of it a little. Creamy, rich and warming together with good drinkability and and a nice depth to it. Towards the end it seemed a little stronger than the 7% abv. suggested but it was a very nice drink and one that I would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This thing is drinkable, and feels slick and sweet."
"Overall. Damn fine stout I was glad to try. Creamy, roasty and chocolaty with a nice English yeast makes it tasty."
""
""
""
"Price Point - $9.99/4pk 12oz bottles"
""
"Really good beer. Pretty big fan of stouts and this was one of the better ones I have had. Nice strong flavour with a great aftertaste. Would recommend this to any looking to try a good stout. Nice alcohol content, nothing too strong, but enough for you to know that its not a non-alcoholic."
"Overall this is a good example of an English style Imperical Stout. It was not very robust and would not stand up against some of the other heavyweights in its style. However, I feel it does have a nice place there as a good ""sessionable"" RIS. By no means Samuel Smith's best offering (seek out Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown over this for sure)."
""
""
""
""
"With a 4.18 average, almost certainly overrated."
""
"smell is very roasty-y; it's a good stout. surprised at the 7% abv from samuel smith's. ive had this before many years ago. taste is dark roasted malts and the mouthfeel is thick and chewy(?). overall, it's a great brew. a tribute to britain's decent beers. they really have come out with some funky products.... after a thick porterhouse i expected this to be too heavy, but despite the thickness it's very satisfying...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real approachable yet delicious stout. Certainly could have a couple of these in a row. Samuel Smith's knows what they are doing when it comes to stouts."
""
"O: More complex than rich. It’s a classic English stout that is notably different than most American takes on the style. Give me this with a nice stew or bowl of chili and I’ll be fine."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not a bad beer, but for me it's on the lower end against other good imperial shouts that I've had. I was especially disappointed because I consider Sam Smith oatmeal stout to be world class."
""
"O: Very nice, different than previous RIS's that I've had but very easy drinking. Can see why this is so highly rated. Maybe not my favorite imperial stout, but well crafted."
""
""
""
"Pair it with some Jethro Tull in particular A New Day Yesterday. You'll get the idea son."
""
""
"Overall - Don't know what all the fuss is about."
""
""
"Much stronger stouts might bring more alcohol or more ""edge"" (read: coffee, barrel aged), but this is just pure smoothness and quality taste from solid beer-making skills. You can't front on that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A different flavor than most RIS's, very good."
""
""
""
""
"This is sweet for an RIS, but not in a boozy way. The sweet flavors are interesting, and they work well with the burnt malts. This is definitely not an American-style RIS, but it's great for what it is."
"Pours a very dark brown translucent, nearly black with a gorgeous, rich, dark taupe colored foamy head. Head retains well, but eventually subsides to a persistent 1/8"" cap. The aroma consists of banana, honey, sorghum, chocolate, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, thick, but not viscous, and compliments the beer very nicely. Flavors of honey and banana up front. Sorghum appears second and never dissipates. Rather, it bitters with the expression of the hop alpha acid. Some sweetness still occurs as the beer cascades down the sides of the tongue. There's just the least little bit of that liquid medicine flavor that keeps this beer from being perfect. It is a great beer though. Very British."
""
""
"Taste: Starts out sweet malty and fruity and then changes into a slight bitterness but not overwhelming. Finishes off with just a mild mix of both of those flavors."
""
""
"O - Very good stout, could drink this anytime. Especially nice winter beer."
"O: a very refined stout, and much to my personal liking, being a fan of well-balanced RISs - more toward the dry end than the sweet, richly flavored without being too filling or heavy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Hands down one of the best beers I've ever tried."
"This is one of those beers that after you finally have it, you wonder where it’s been the whole time! This was just a really nice take on an English Imperial Stout with a well balanced complexity to it and a solid chewy feel in the mouth that feels bitter than its only 7% ABV. I will be returning to this down the road."
"Pro-tip: drink this beer with creme brulee. It is one of the finest food pairings you will ever have."
""
""
"O - This is not only a great stout, but a great beer in general. I plan on drinking more of these in the future and would highly recommend this to all beer enthusiasts."
"I hate to not write a glowing review for this beer, but for me it's just not as rich, full-bodied or aromatic as the best imperial stouts I've had. I mean, it's still a smooth, tasty beer. I like it. It's just that when I compare it to Old Rasputin or Stone, this one just doesn't bring as much to the table. It's all the same basic components, just not as strong and not as full. A fantastic introductory Russian Imperial, and perhaps I'll try it again sometime and realize all I'm missing. But today, it's just a really solid brew."
""
""
"This is one of my all-time favorite beers. While it is on the light side for an Imperial Stout, it packs tons of flavor and is incredibly drinkable. I could really have a couple of these in a sitting without tiring of the flavor. A world-class beer."
"Overall: It didn't really have the depth I wanted. It's good, but I feel like it's trying to mimic to the flavor palette of oak-aged stouts too much. It's too sweet, not really balanced out by anything except a touch of alcohol."
"O - Overall an OK imperial stout, but not one I will be looking for in the future. Pretty disappointed by this average beer."

"355ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice, jet black, opaque, no head, tanned lacing around the edges which hung around. Smelled coffee beans and slightly of fruits. Tasted malt, coffee, bourbon, dark chocolate, raisins and cream. Booze well hidden. Long espresso finish. Minimal carbonation, very smooth, medium body. Liked the feel of the beer and the way it hid the booze, but I wasn't blown away. Guinness on steroids."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a stupendous beer, one of my favorites by Samuel Smith's. Definitely recommend it"
""
"O: This is a very interesting beer. Like I said when explaining the taste, it's almost like three separate beers. I'm generally not a fan of the yeast Samuel Smith's uses (and I'd still like to try this beer with a different yeast), but I like this beer quite a bit. Very complex, very tasty."
""
""
"This is different from most of the other RIS's I've had. The dark fruit flavors are very forward with an old ale or barleywine characteristic. The usual RIS notes are present but more subdued than I'm used to. It wasn't a bad beer, but there are better RIS's out there."

"Full bodied, smooth like silk across the tongue. Light effervescence. This beer is well deserving of its high rating."
"Excellent big beer, but doesn't push drinkability boundaries. I suspect would do well with a year in my cellar."
""
""
"I feel for the money this is one of the best Stouts available in the U.S. There are better imperial stouts out there, but the price is very reasonable for the quality of beer you're getting."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma, especially when it started to warm. The sweetness really started to flourish at that point, emphasizing the rather complex grain bill. In the end, however, we couldn’t escape the standard souring malty twinge of any classic Sam Smith beer, which made it seem a little generic. That aside, the flavoring was executed nicely, and the beer was delicious, but we were just hoping for a little more variety, and something a bit more memorable, from such a great brewery."
""
"500ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on oct´11. Pitch black color. Beige , medium bubbled, close froth. Brief head. Intense caramel malt aroma, hints of toffee & hues of raisin too. Taste is toasted malts, smooth sweetness & toffee candies. Subtle warming alcohol. Medium body & medium carbonation. No roughness is shown, no astringency either. Dry bitter finish while underlying sugar resolves in a sweet velvet aftertaste. Full flavor & pleasant drinkability. Who said a big Imperial has to be above 7% ?"

"O- Great Stout overall. It may be my American ignorance, but this is not quite as bold with the smell and appearance as I would like, but the taste is world-class."
""
"Having now had several tastes of true imperial stout greatness (Peruvian Morning, Mikkeller Black Hole, Mokha), I have to downgrade even further. I'd place this in the league of Founders Breakfast Stout; the two seem very similar, though this is a much smaller beer, of course."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours almost black with a creamy tan head. The beer is completely opaque and the head retains very well, dissipating slowly. The aroma is of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruits. The taste follows the nose and is very rich. There are flavors of dark roasted barley malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, molasses, anise, and dark fruits. It has a mild sweetness that is not too cloying. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. It is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is very high for a style that lends it self more to sipping. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a classic example of a RIS. With the wide availability of this beer, you shouldn't have problems finding this in bottle shops."
"Overall - A beer worthy of it's acclaim. Lots of different flavours going on, but none that are too overpowering. There is the perfect amount of bitterness during the aftertaste as well. It's well crafted and it's a beer that I'm sure I'll pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was great!"
""
"O: A fantastic example of British beer. Possibly the best Sam Smith, and they're all pretty good."
""
""
"One of this years best and obviously one to get again. RIS at it's best. Out frigging standing."
"O: It's not like the typical imperial stout I'm used to, but its vinous characteristics combined with some of the flavors the dark malts provide (such as chocolate) make this such an enjoyable sipper (but it's not a chugger by any means, even if it's only 7%!) It's a world class imperial stout I can get for $4 a bottle. Enough said."

"I liked this imperial stout. It is a very good offering. It probably isn't in my top 5 imperial stouts... but we've been blessed to have many great offerings from this style out there. AND, they are readily available."
""
""
"O: Very balanced Stout. Extremely drinkable due to relatively low ABV and balanced flavors. This is what you expect from British breweries. The roastedness you find in American RIS's is not as forward in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: You are crazy to leave this on the shelf, well rounded beer that reminds you what real beer is. Salud!"
"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is chocolate, roasted malts, molasses. Taste is good, chocolate, malts, a touch of coffee, just a hint of bitterness, complex and tasty. Feels full bodied, a bit creamy in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
""
""
"Samuel Smith again comes through with a good beer, but maybe blasé by today’s standards especially in regards to a RIS."
""
""
"Overall: Highly recommended for a lower ABV Russian Imperial."
""
"O: Good imperial stout. Not a huge beer at 7% - but the alcohol is strong in every sip. A little too syrupy for me – but a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
""
""
"O- This may legitimately be my favorite beer I've reviewed on this site, and possibly the best one I've had. Drinkability is through the roof, smell is exquisite, the taste is wonderful and the mouthfeel is like a massage for your tongue. ...no but really this is great."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable and very drinkable stout. The beer has a nice complexity of flavor and aroma while still keeping a relatively low ABV. Not exactly sessionable but definitely easy to approach and not a beer that requires a lengthy time sipping. No noticeable alcohol present."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not having had an Imperial Stout for a long time, I was pleasantly surprised by this 'blind' choice. It wasn't as heavy as I expected, but was quite drinkable. It did taste a little bit 'hollow', as after the first few mouthfuls it was definitely not as complex as I had hoped. By the end of the bottle, my overall rating had gone from a 4 down to a 3, as the bitterness seemed to overtake any other flavours. Slightly disappointing considering its overall rating here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An entirely drinkable Imperial Stout, nearly to a detriment; I've had oatmeal stouts with more potency than this. Certainly a weak Imperial Stout by today's standards. That said, it's pretty tasty, and respect for being a long standing classic."
"O - Really impressed by this one. Wasn't expecting a lot when I saw it, but it really surprised me. 7% RIS? It works. I'm used to seeing 9+% RISs, but other than a slightly thin mouthfeel for the style, it is extremely delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid oatmeal stout, very well balanced, delicious and palatable, perfect for drawing newbies into the stout fold. Its American cousins take the ball from there and elevate the robustness and complexity, but this is still a nice one to drink. I'm a little sad that it doesn't deliver as well now that I've expanded my stout palate, but I'll keep my nostalgic soft spot for it."
""
""
"O - Still one of the better ""simple"" stouts out there. It has a good amount of flavor and the lower than average ABV makes it easy to drink. A great entry level beer into the world of Imperial Stouts."
""
""
"RJT"
"Mouth feel and the look of the beer go hand in hand. Both lighter than most Imp stouts I am used to. I prefer a thicker body, but this is still a nice beer."
""
"O: Just beautiful. A meal in a glass."
""
"Nice black pour with a solid tan colored head. Aroma was strong with malt, chocolate and coffee scents. With a deeper inhale I picked up alcohol and cherries as well. First tatse was very smooth and left a sweet impression of choclate and dark ripe cherries on my pallate. The aftertaste was slightly bitter and dry leaving a burnt coffee taste. Nice smooth mouthfeel with just enough creamieness. What a great warming stout on a cold rainy night."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nearly perfect stout! I think it was much better than its Stone counterpart, but that's just my opinion. I would have expected more chocolate flavor but, again, that's just me. Can't complain though, this was one of the best stouts I've had. Highly recommended."
"O: Not bad. Pretty good drinkability. Wish it was fresher though."
""
""
""
""

"This was a wonderful Imperial Stout. Although I’ve heard reports of how the Samuel Smith organization has mistreated the people of Tadcaster in one way or another, they can certainly brew a phenomenal stout."

"It's a classic, and a great brew. Not my favorite take on the style, but they practically invented it. A complex and satisfying version that would work wonders as an entry-point to a novice beer enthusiast to the magical world of Russian Imperials."

"Full-flavored without being too heavy; nicely balanced and easy-drinking."
"Overall, this is a beer that goes great after a long day working in the cold and wet, taking big gulps out of an english pint. It may not be my favorite stout, or even my favorite from Sam Smith's (I love you Oatmeal Stout), but it is a hell of great way to finish the day."
""
"Overall- I bought this on a whim and I am glad I did. This is an enjoyable imperial stout."

"O- A very approachable and easy drinking Imperial stout. Classy and elegant. I would have liked a touch more complexity on the nose, but overall very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O- Great Imperial Stout for the price. It met my expectations. Looking forward to trying more from Samuel Smiths. Also, would like to put some of these in the cellar and age them."
""
"Giving this beer slightly above average. I was expecting better. I think what brought it down slightly overall for me was the balance, or lack there of. It's still very drinkable and has a lot of flavor, you just have to like what's there."

"550ml bottle. Pours pitch black with two full fingers of frothy tan head. Smells ""dark"" - molasses, chocolate, slight roasty notes, and an undercurrent of alcohol. It's thin bodied, well carbonated, and slides right over the tongue. The taste is chocolate, molasses, hints of roasted coffee, licorice, and a hint of alcohol. Compared to the 10%+ IRS that are more common on the west coast, this is a light example of the style, well-balanced and better suited to beer drinkers who don't have the taste buds or stomach for stronger renditions."

"An ok RIS but could use a bit heavier flavor and a bit too dry in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours black with a fluffy, brown head that doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Aromas and tastes are similar: dark cocoa, chocolate, slightly boozy (even for 7%), and slightly bitter on the finish from the roasted barley presence. Mouth-feel is velvety, smooth, and full bodied. Overall, even though this isn't over-the-top in alcohol % or boldness, its delicacy makes it a great example of the style."

"Impressive - a sweet melange of preserved fruit flavours. Rich and thick, perfect for sipping. A bit cloying; would probably only want one of these in a sitting. Quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 5/5 - In the end, my interest in Samuel Smith has been greatly revived! I'm looking forward to re-trying all of their non-fruit brews. And of course, more Imperial Stout is in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O- you have to take value and how easily available into account here- and it deserves a high overall rating. For 3.50 for a 22, it is an excellent deal, when many lesser imperial stouts go for 2 to 3x as much"
""
""
"O-This is a great looking brew, but the taste and mouthfeel fall just a little bit short for me when compared to other RIS I've had."
""
""
""
"O: Really good Russian Imperial Stout. I like that it's a lower ABV than most. Plus, the nose and flavor are phenomenal. One of my new favorites."
"I wasn't expecting much from this considering all of the chatter about roastiness and my less that stellar experiences with other stouts and porters. I was pleasantly surprised! Not sure how often I'll buy it as I'm not sure if the style is for me - roasty character doesn't seem to be one of my favorites, though it's not as bad as excessive bitterness or hoppiness - but not sorry I got it either."
""
""
"O: This was a very good RIS, but just not my favorite. I prefer more roastiness and darker flavors with less sweetness (Old Rasputin). Nice work but the decaf flavor limits me to one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It has all the huge flavor of a good RIS, but somehow comes in as a more ""delicate"" beer if that can be said of a RIS. Fantastic stuff."
""
""
""
"amazing drinkable for such a big beer. Grape like sweetness contends with the big hop presence extremely well making for a greatly balanced beer. Alot going on here. I had a lot more written but my browser crashed twice while reviewing this beer. I loved it though."
""
"Black with ruby red at the edges when held to some light, a great amount of lacing and some solid retention. Nose has chocolate with a great dark fruit character, sweet and rich dark malts with a dry and lightly toasty grain character. A touch of licorice as well. Taste has some dried dark fruits lightly coated in chocolate, some brown sugar and caramel. Light roastiness in the finish. A bit of the Samuel Smith hard water character too. Drying, creamy and great mouthfeel for the style - real bang on for what I dig. Low carbonation. An excellent imperial stout. My only point of contention? I wish this was bigger, maybe a few percent higher in the ABV category. Sam Smith does dark ales well."
"o - pretty damn good, but imho other brewers have outdone this one stylewise. very drinkable for a bigger beer. can't go wrong picking up a 4 pack of these though."
""
""
""
""
"settles in the glass a pitch black with half a finger of sand colored head. within a minute the head is gone, leaving no lacing and a still glass of motoroil. nose and taste are both pleased with the typical aromas of stouts. roasted malts provide coffee and chocolate for the senses, a little alochol on the back end of both is nice, not over done. the biggest draw back to this beer is the mouthfeel. i think it should be thicker and sticky, like a syrup. this one is thinner, like a porter. other than that this is a good imperial stout for the money."
""
""
""
"A lovely beer. A reminder that the day i spent in Tadcaster was not nearly long enough. Wish i had drunk more of this in the UK. Might get some to cellar and hope that the booze drops out. A big stout and i have had worse with some other limited or brewery release RIS's. A very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Notes: Been drinking this one at Holidays for over a decade but just reviewing this now. Easy drinking, well made, without flaws."
""
""
"A pleasant RIS, a bit different than the American versions I have tried in that there is a bit less of an emphasis on the bold, roast, coffee and chocolate flavors."
""
""
"B+"
""
""
"Overall - I'm a bit disappointed here, let me explain. The nose is wonderful, and by the smell of this ""Imperial Stout"" I thought this was going to be a big, flavorful, mouthcoating beer, but it absolutely is not. The flavors are nice, but feels a bit watered down. I like the beer, but have a hard time thinking of this as Imperial. This feels and tastes far more like a regular stout or porter. See what you think."
"O-readily available, decent price, great beer whats not to love with this one"
""

"This beer is as dark as night with a thick, fluffy tan head- perfect! the head does not recede for a while... The aroma is fruitier than one might expect - plum and raisin can be detected, and in the background, a touch of coffee and roasted malt. Seems sharp and crisp. After a sip the actual taste is revealed to be just as interesting and complex as the nose. The initial splash of flavor is the fruit/raisin followed by, a roasted, smoked touch and a dry finish. Very crisp on the tongue. As I drink the head sticks tightly to the glass - this is a nice frothy brew. This has a relatively light mouth feel and I can hardly put the glass down even for a second. There's just enough of a warming sensation from the alcohol. A very classy staple in the Imperial Stout world."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a good Imperial Stout, the flavor/aroma isn't really impressive. More like a strong flavorful regular stout. ABV doesn't hit the requirement here or by the BJCP, but I knew that ahead of time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer, it is a great example of a nice well balanced stout. It is also quite well served by the distinctive hard water taste that all Samuel Smith's beers have giving it a unique flavor that you can't find anywhere else. Plus at $4.00 a bottle and 7% abv this is one I can see my self drinking quite a bit."
""
"Overall a good stout but not a great one. Won't be seeking this one out again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very flavourful and drinkable porter. I appreciate also its comparatively low ABV."
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent imperial stout. It has long been a personal favorite of mine. If you're a fan of the bitter, explosive American double/imperial stouts, then this beer may be too restrained for you, but if you're a fan of traditional stouts, then you'll probably love this one."

"A good imperial stout. Not such high alcohol compared to some of it's American counterparts, but it still packs a good punch. Very pleasant to drink."

"O: this is one of my all time favorites.... packed with flavor... cheap as hell..."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you have not had this one already please wait no longer. There are still easily available beers out there that are more than worth your time and money."
""
""
""
"Light roasty malty nose. Black creamy head drops to lace. Poured into a dimple mug. Full flavor, not to syrupy like most ris's. Not too sweet, roasty but not too roasty, dry, but mouthwater juiciness. Perfect hop profile for the malt. Sam smiths has this wonderful mineralness that I'm not sure if its from the water, stone or yeast, or all of the above, but it sure is delicious. I've said it before, Sam Smiths can do no wrong. This is the most solid, most drinkable and most affordable RIS available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first imperial stout which I really liked (and I mean I REALLY liked it!), not overly-sweet or overly-hopped like several I've tasted before. I can't wait to get another of these, to share with a good friend. After 3 other beers by Samuel Smith, and now this one, I have to say that the guys at Budweiser are lying: Samuel Smith is the king of beer!"
""

""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, light for this style by the standards of 2011. Slightly creamy and sticky but well short of cloying or viscous. Lingering finish is bitter and roasty."
"Overall: A great beer from the guys at Samuel Smith. A solid one that sure be a favorite in any beer lover's list."
""
"O: Great RIS. Not usually a fan but this one is incredibly smooth with a good taste."
"It's very malty but yet the hops and yeast make themselves known. The nasty roasty, sweet taste is all a part of what every imperial should shoot for. Yet it is slightly less enjoyable than some american imitations."
""
""
""
""
"Just very good and solid overall...very drinkable. Paired incredibly with milk chocolate...unbelievable. I drizzled a bit over vanilla ice cream too...very good."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - I got into this having preconceived notions of what it would be like. Damn, i was wrong, surprised in a good way. Seek it out if you are sick of americanized imperial stouts( i can never be ) and want to try something new from across the pond. Really good stuff."
""
""
""
""

"O: A fantastic RIS. Always one I will drink if I find it. It is not as available as some other Samuel Smith brews. Would highly recommend this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Beautiful and balanced. Not very complex, but it serves this beer very well. This is my first Samuel Smith brew, compared to the Old Rasputin, which is the only other RIS I’ve had, and it holds up very well, though of course profoundly different in its UK vs. American styling. I'm a big fan, and can't wait to try more from SS."

"The bottle tells me it is brewed with well water from a well first used in 1758. It tastes as if they forgot to filter the mud out from the water!! Too bitter, burnt coffee. I am going to pour out the rest. (My sink is becoming an alchoholic!). I am giving up on Russian Imperial's!!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a coffee black. The head is a pillow of dark cream, awesome head retention -- it doesn't dissipate at all. Nice sticky lacing. The aroma is that of bitter chocolate, raisins, and burnt malts. The taste is wonderful as it mimics the aroma: bitter chocolate, a hint of sweet raisins, mellow roasted malts, and a nice dry finish. The mouthfeel is just light enough and it's very drinkable at 7% ABV. Overall, and exceptional brew. It's delicious, looks good, and is very smooth. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"This was yet another beer recommended to me by a brewer friend of mine that knew I was into English Ales. This was a pretty good beer. Much more flavorful than the Fullers ESB or Belhaven Wee Heavy but just as good but not as smooth. The flavor was more complex than most of the English ales I have had but more malty and less hoppy. The color was dark and rich just as its flavor. I found this beer to be great with a white/milk chocolate and/or cheese- oddly. Good to drink- better with food."
"Cost: $3.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"Big frothy pour, almost black. Huge thick head dark tan in the middle fading to darker brown on the edge. Nose is faint. I pick up alcohol, coffee. On to the taste. Can't get here quick enough. This is so good, every time. Coffee and dark, charred mocha and sweet toffee are blended perfectly. Finishes with bitter smoke. Mouth is very creamy and dense with just the right amount of carbonation. This is such a classic. It is different than any imperial by U.S. Just... done right and consistently great. The standard in my opinion, as is many from this brewer. Long live the Tadcaster!"
"Body-Full, heavy, creamy. Don’t like this beer at all, the flavors are not for me."
"Overall a superb Imperial Stout, very easy to drink and very enjoyable on the taste buds."
"O: Just a notch below the best I've had, but much more attainable. A wonderful find for me on International Stout Day. I'll definitely be coming back to this one!"
"This was really disappointing (because I had such high expectations). While this is gorgeous and quite aromatic, it just doesn't do it for me in either the taste or mouthfeel departments. While certainly a decent big stout, I won't feel like I'm missing out if I don't ever have this again--which is too bad, because I was hoping I'd love this stuff--it's so inexpensive!"
"O - Quite a nice little drinker this is. Well balanced, not excessively heavy, and it isn't too demanding."
"O: Not my favorite flavor profile...decent, but I prefer more roast, coffee, hop/earthiness, etc."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a unique take on this now ubiquitous style. Although it may not be as intense as many of the monster stouts brewed today, it it impressive nonetheless. All in all, I found this beer to be refreshing both literally and figuratively."
"D - Sam Smith boys know about beer. They deliver once again, in a refreshing smooth beer that is both filling and hearty and at the same time light and playful. Could drink this until my feet give out from under me."
"American RIS's might be more rich than their European counterparts. This isn't a bad beer, just not what I expected. Re-surprised with every sip at how light bodied, and crisply carbonated it is."
"O/D-This is a pretty decent beer. I didn't love Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, but this one is pretty legit. Easy drinking, mellow, and sweet. Not excellent but good for a four pack that is easy to get."
"Another good selection from Sam Smith."
"O- Very drinkable for the style: of course the 7%ABV helps, but despite low ABV the beer still feels as rich and complex as an imperial stout should feel"
"American brewers take note of the thick maltiness and creaminess packed into a 7% ABV beer. Not to mention the chocolate, chicory, anise, and freshly roasted coffee beans. Great fruitiness from the yeast and caramel and toffee tops it all off. Great beer here."
"-Overall 4.0: This must be one of, if not the, best stouts in the world. There is a level of carbonation present here that will turn off fans of ""draught only Guinness," but if you are like me and are accustomed to other stouts, you will find an infinity of tastes to enjoy in this excellent British stout. If you can find it, BUY IT."
"Simply an excellent imperial stout and a masterpiece in brewing from Samuel Smith. A little less intense than most examples of the style. Still very complex with lots of flavor to make me go back for another sip over and over again."
"Pours dull black with a huge, densely packed light brown head (maybe a salmon tint, I can't tell if it's the light in here). Very good retention and pretty good lacing. Smells like rich roasted malt and a hint of vanilla and cream and fruity notes. Taste is rich but restrained roasted malt and a little minerally (spot on, I totally see the well water) no hops/chocolate/coffee to speak of, finishing with a bit of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation which is not particularly smooth. Overall, the light touch of roasted malt makes this pretty drinkable. The minerally taste is an interesting angle."
"Overall: A very good stout. The dark fruits add a nice touch and this is the smoothest imperial stout I've had."
"D - Fantastic drink; great dessert beer or enjoyable with a few sweets; great balance of roasted coffee flavors and chocolate; not too over bearing, but memorable; I'll make this a staple in my fridge"
"O: Overall, a decently good beer. However, with the subdued flavors, lighter body, and over carbonation, it doesn’t really come off as an RIS to me. I would drink it again, particularly since the price is relatively low, but its not something I’d go out of my way to have again. I prefer the bolder American RIS’s. However, I do think it is much better than the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, and certainly worth a try if you've never had it. Afterall, it is one of the standards of the style which others have built off of."
"O: A very nice drink. Not my favorite Imperial Stout, but timeless, nonetheless. Just another reason to love Samuel Smith."
"Overall-I remember enjoying this beer alot more a while back. Going to have to try another bottle soon. Still a good beer, but an Imperial Stout it's just to thin, I'd consider it more of a Stout."
"O: An all-around great imperial stout. I love it for what it is, but the jaded American beer geek in me wanted something a little bolder. Still, guaranteed to please any lover of the dark stuff."
"Overall: Great imperial stout and one I would recommend and hope to have this again."
"Overall: A decent example of an IRS; rich, regal. Let it warm and the smoothness dominates."
"If you are going with a Samuel Smith then the Oatmeal Stout is a far better stout than this one in my opinion."
"O: I can't quite give a ""5" to any of these categories. The beer didn't seem to have the same depth as some other RIS. I don't think it really compares to many other RIS, in that it falls a little short in that respect, but as a beer, it is great! I do like the other Samuel Smith's stuff, and this one did not disappoint."
"O - A bit different from the American versions. Although this is lower in alcohol than most American RIS's its got some pretty pronounced alcohol notes in the nose and taste. This is perfect for a winter setting. Top notch brew."
"drank 2 550ml bottles good stuff."
"O: This beer is, again, not superlative in any sense, but a great beer nonetheless. There are no risks here. It's thick without being too thick. The ABV is higher than a stout, but still low for the style. There are no crazy flavors present. This a beer that will not let you down, but also will not shock in any way."
"Body is thin for an imp. Still a fine brew."
"Overall: Bold flavorful taste, velvety smooth, and a very good beer overall."
"O: Overall I'd say that it's a decent Imperial Stout. Im a big fan of their nut brown and porter but this left me wanting more out of the beer. You can't beat the price and I'm I'll return to this some time in the future."
"O-a decent tasting stout that seems to have a lot of loose ends. the tastes are alright, but not very drinkable. the burnt taste seemed to be over dominating. it just isn't something i want a lot of."
"o: This was a really nice change of pace from the over-the-top American stouts I love so much."
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a thick, fluffy light brown head. The scent is great with bold roasted malts, carmel, burnt sugar, and cocoa. It rather thick and creamy in taste. Very robust malts mixed nicely with carmal malts and sugar with just a little spice to it. A great thick creamy stout that is great for sipping with lots of great flavor. Another great beer from Samuel Smith!"
"Pours a black color with a dark khaki head that left lots of foamy lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, it's a little smoky and has some herbal hops. Tastes of bitter dark chocolate and coffee grinds with a slightly metallic tang. This beer is nice and thick, very smooth and it's extra dry. Very good stout, it's very drinkable I would never guess the abv was that high."
"Anyways this pours a pitch black and semi thick flow with a mocha head which doesn't last long and goes down to a thin layer on the top. The smell is of roasted coffee and malts, also some sweet smells perhaps molasses. Feel is thick and creamy, one of the better feeling beers I can remember, very nice. Taste is good, I get the dark roasted malts, come dark chocolate and the little bit of sweetness, molasses or something, overall this is a very good beer, I've had better RIS, but this is one I'd gladly pick up again and again. Good stuff."
"O - Lots of character. Great with a dessert, possibly a slice of cheesecake."
"Overall my favorite stout, so many flavors going on with this brew. Everything is balanced and is virtually flawless."
"Not a session beer but one could enjoy two before acclimation."
"I bought a bottle of this for a friend's dad who swears by Guinness and he was blown away. I have to say this is one of very few imperial stouts I have had, but every time now I have a guinness or regular stout it is just not enough. Will continue to buy (this is the third time I've gotten it)"
"O: Very nice brew. Totally stumped me. Not sure what to call the smell or the flavor, but both are spot on. It must be the well water they use in the brewing, or something, but very nice."
"Overall, enjoyable but somewhat disappointing. Obviously not every RIS has to be over the top in strength, but I found this beer to be somewhat underwhelming. While I tend to like imperial stouts, I prefer Sam Smith's Oatmeal to this offering. A good beer, but not the gem I was hoping for."
"Overall I really like this beer, the ABV is not as high as other RIS but that is a welcome change. The taste could be a bit richer but that is my only complaint"
"O - A superb RIS. I really am fond of this style of brew. I've had many different ones, and they all seem to please in their own way. This is a winner for sure. World class, and one of the less alc % ones out there, so it's one of the best ones to get if you arent used to this style of stout. It's also great tasting to those who are. I buy at least a single bottle almost everytime I see it. A real deal winner here."
"This was my first R.I.S. and from what I've read, one of the best. Poured from the foil sealed bottle into my Duvel tulip. Nearly pitch black, maybe a touch of ruby color. Tan head diminished to a wisp of foam here and there. Roasty smell, quite inviting actually. The taste was smooth and balanced. Roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, etc. Malt and hops in balance. Mouthfeel was actually thinner than I expected but nice nonetheless. A solid brew, can't wait to try more Russian Imperial Stouts to compare."
"Pours with a large creamy light brown head. The beer is pitch black even on the corners. Smells of carmel mainly with hints of coffee and toffee and somewhat faint. The is much like the smell but much stronger the mouthfeel is like whole milk. Overall this is a top notch stout and o e of my favorites"
"Color is nearly pitch black, with some dark burgundy around the edges when held to light. Head is a light brown or dark tan color, which initiall leaves some nice lacing but fades quickly. Scents of chocolate, raisin, and alcohol are pleasant if a bit weak. The taste is sweet, but not overly sweet - it is a nice plum or fig sweetness, with a slight floral twinge from the hops. Thin mouthfeel is keeping this good beer from a higher score."
"The thinness is really my only complaint, it really makes this beer only just above average in my opinion."
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is chocolate with some roasted malt. I also get a little bit of mint in the aroma. The flavor is chocolate and roasted malt with some coffee mixed in. There is also some cream and oat notes in the flavor. Thick mouthfeel and low, soft carbonation. A very nice traditional imperial stout."
"Hardly stands up to some of the monsters that this style has produced. However, it is a nice well made stout and definitely worth a try."
"Really smooth. Nothing too overpowering like you get in many other example of the style. Quite an easy drinker for an imperial."
"Pours deep mahogany / black with a nice brown lasting head and good lacing. Cacao, espresso and caramel malt fill the nose, with nice distinctive dark fruitiness. Taste is deep roasted caramel malt, chocolate and some roasted espresso. Palate is a nice full body with a rich and creamy mouth feel. Finish is caramel malts, roasted espresso ending with a slight bitterness and lingering chocolate aftertaste. Overall a very nice tasty and enjoyable brew."
"O-very refreshing, kind of taste like black olives...weird i know...for its price and availability its just ok...definitely have had better but this is just an average stout in my opinion"
"500mL bottle. Pours black with frothy tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells predominantly of black licorice and deep fruits (raisins and plums come to mind). Overall, the aroma is a bit on the tart, fruity side... maybe a slight hint of chocolate and roasted malts in there, but predominantly black licorice. The taste is similar to the aroma: starts out with fruit and black licorice, then finishes a little more smokey and chocolatey. Malts and alcohol are also in the mix. A pretty complex beer, let it warm up a bit and the notes are easier to distinguish. Beautiful pour and very thick on the tongue; it’s a pretty heavy brew, but still quite drinkable. Samuel Smiths continues to impress!"
"Amazingly drinkable for 7% ABV. As far as I've tried, this is the definitive English imperial stout."
"O: A decent RIS. I would probably classify it as an entry level RIS. Not gonna smack you down your first drink. Definitely not what I think of or want in a RIS."
"O: I'm not familiar with England brews in any form or fashion. They probably view Sam Smith's as we view our big domestics. But this beer definitely has it's place on the shelf."
"O - I got this beer on a whim. I'm so glad I did now. Excellent quality for the price. One of the better imperial stouts I've had."
"Overall, this was quite an enjoyable beer. My first from Samuel Smith's but certainly not my last!"
"As it warms, the alcohol becomes more readily present, yet it become more enjoyable as coffee beans and roasted chocolate flavors (with caramel!) appeared to explode on my palate. For its price, this may be greatest stout on the planet that happens to be pretty accessible. I found it to be more delicious than Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, and is ultimately a real treat to be appreciated in every sip."
"An impressive pour, resulting in two thick fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was midnight black with deep-brown highlights at the edges. Nose was rich with coffee, dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, smoke and even some alcohol heat. Whew! Mouthfeel was a little thin for the style, but still bigger and chewier than many other beers. The taste was very bitter, coffee-like, which was perfect since I was having this with and for breakfast. Take that, Catherine the Great! Finish was smoky, bitter, dry, a big Wow!, but without the often overpowering alcohol of its modern American iterations. Nice, plus it is accessible year-'round without having to stand in line to score some."
"O: For this price, who could complain!"
"O - It's a nice Imperial Stout, but nothing out of the ordinary. I would say it's spot on and true to style, but that doesn't make it stand out in anyway. After reading other reviews, I think I might purchase another bottle and hold onto it for a few years before trying it again."
"Very drinkable and greatly crafted, like everything else from this brewery!"
"This is a really nice, affordable imperial stout that goes down easy and one that I could drink often."
"550ml bottle for $3.99. What a steal! This is right next to GDBC Espresso OA Yeti Imp Stout to most bang for your $$$. Will be frequenting this brew many times to come."
"One of my all time favorites. Moat will want bigger and wilder and,more eccentric. I prefer this beer for being on Que with style guidelines, but acting in moderation. Make sure your bottle has some age to it, that is the secret ingredient. ;-)"
"Pours a dark cola brown-black with bronzed tints, and a pillowy beige head. Roasty malt aroma, sugary, with coffee notes. More dark roasted malts in the taste, molasses, licorice, coffee bitterness. Not quite full-bodied, but quite rich and tasty, and a very drinkable stout."
"Don’t expect a true, strong imperial experience with this one, just take it for what it is. And that is a good, smooth beer. With gold foil. Shiny, gold foil."
"Cheers!"
"I got this bottle at a bar, and I would guess that it spent 8-12 months in the fridge. Just like everything from Samuel Smith, this is a solid beer."
"A solid beer, but just doesn't stand up to the top versions of this style."
"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery does a great job with the old style Russian Imperial Stout. The beer pours a dark, deep brown nearly opaque, and has a slight head at one finger, that dissipates quickly and laces slightly. Smell is generally coffee malts with some chocolate and a slight bit of hops, primarily floral in nature, mostly for bitterness. Taste is very much chocolate-coffee in nature, with little hop flavoring. Maybe a hair of floral hops. Anyway, feel is smooth, with a slight carbonation, some oiliness, and a generally full body. Overall, Samuel Smith's has done a great one with a style that they probably have been doing for nearly a century. I enjoyed it and will have it again."
"A good beer, but I felt it was either too sweet for the amount of bitterness or too bitter for the amount of sweetness."
"The beer is good. I would buy it again, mainly because they are cheap. Cheaper than most beers in a bottle this size. I actually like their brown more than this. But it’s thick and black, and would go well with a nice cigar or meat based meal. Man… I wanted it to be so much more. As we move along 1001 bottles… I am sure I will be let down time and time again! Bottoms up people!"
"Overall a very tasty brew which I would have again."
"It has been a while since I drank a bottle of this classic beer. It's better than I remember it and I should go back to this more often. So should you."
"O- Pretty great beer here. If it was ever on tap I would jump at the chance when I saw it."
"Overall: Forgive me for my sentimentality, but I may have just found my soul mate. Thank you, beer gods."
"Overall the beer looks and tastes great. A full-bodied stout with a good taste and smell that isn't watered down."
"Overall a wonderful beer. I really wish I could find this at every grocery store like all the other Samuel Smith offerings."
"A good stout. Very bitter. Not too complex."
"Overall: This is a great little impy stout. It is eclipsed by larger, more flavourful American counterparts, but it is still a great example of the style."
"O- Very easy to drink, maybe a little to easy. A solid beer, this is the first Russian Imperial stout I've ever had, glad I got the chance to try it. I would definitely drink this again, I'd love to have it on tap."
"Poured this into a beer mug. Very dark with a decent sized carmel colored head on it. Smelled notes of chocolate and maybe just a little bit of coffee. Taste was very light compared to many of the other Imperial Stouts I've tried. Tastes of chocolate and malt, but kind of watery to me, however did have a very nice lingering coffee aftertaste. Ahhhh there's the coffee! At 3.99, this is something I would drink if I wanted an Imperial Stout, but didn't have the money to get anything else"
"O- Overall a very solid brew but doesn't have quite the muscle that some of the other russian imperial stouts flex."
"Overall. A good strong stout. A little heavy on the molasses in the taste, but drinks pretty good."
"You cannot possibly go wrong with this one and it will be a staple of mine for the foreseeable future."
"However, overall this is a nice drinkable brew that would do anyone good. Cheers!!!"
"O: Really nice, the dark fruit flavors were a bit unexpected, but this one came together well. Had it once before and remember it differently, but that was a few years ago. Need to get it one more time."
"Mouth feel was excellent for this style. Very smooth. Not too thick, not too thin."
"For whatever reason, mostly just the huge variety of options with beer, Samuel Smith's well regarded brews just never found their way into my cart. Thats changed. 5 years into my beer rebirth, and I'm having a lot of fun getting to know this ""old Master"" brewery."
"Overall: Great beer that I will come back to time and again I think."
"D: i was expecting a little more from this beer being on the 'beers of fame' list. i guess a 7%'er should be this light, but as far as RIS's are concerned there are a lot ahead of this one on my list."
"O - a very good example of the style."
"The more Samuel Smith beers I drink, the more I'm coming to realize how careful they work to make such intricate and subtly complex beers, and yet I'm drawn to their simplicity. This is, simply put, an awesome beer."
"O: This is fantastic. The get more flavor from a 7% RIS than most brewers get from 10%."
"Pours out a black body with a thick creamy tan head that slowly disappears. It has good retention and decent lacing and moderate carbonation. The smell is a nice blend of molasses, coffee, chocolate, and a dark rum like aroma. Would love to have a candle or air freshener that smelled like this beer. The taste starts out with some molasses, followed by hints of coffee, raisins, plums and has a sweet taste in the background. Finishes off with some chocolate and even though I don't notice it so much when drinking it that in the aftertaste I get the floral and citrus taste from the hops. This beer has a nice creamy medium to full body taste that is nice and smooth. Overall this is a terrific Imperial Stout that I will gladly drink again."
"The flavors in Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout may not be quite as bold and in your face as many American versions, but they are still strong and complex. The 7% ABV allows for great drinkability considering the style."
"This was quite a surprise. I knew the beer would be dark when I bought it but I hadn't noticed that it was in a clear bottle! When I picked it up I thought it was black or brown glass. It wasn't till I starting pour this that I noticed it was a clear bottle. So with that the color of the beer is very dark black. The head is tiny and its a brown color, it fades very fast. The aroma is of burnt sugar and malts, also heavily roasted. The flavor of this beer is reflective of the aromas. There is abig roasted malt kick and settles into a sweeter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a little light I think, but overall this a pretty good brew."
"Unbeatable."
"O: For its style, this beer is very easy to drink because it's relatively light bodied and the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Samuel Smith continues to impress me. This is a great brew to pick up if you are looking for under $5. Fans of the style will not regret it."
"O - Really this was a lot less enjoyable than I imagined it would be, very very milky, lots of lactose and slight acidity."
"Overall, very impressed. A damn good Imperial Stout, and I'm looking forward to getting more."
"This brew was wondefully rich. Its a great brew. Something I could never turn down. Its has a great feel, but isn't so strong that you have to worry about the ABV. It has a great drinkability."
"D - tasty and very smooth, the alcohol is well hidden, definitely worth a try"
"D-This beer isn't disgusting by any means, but it's far below my expectation of what an RIS is. The mouthfeel is especially disappointing."
"O - Overall a very tasty imperial stout and highly recommended to any fan of the style. The higher ABV goes completely undetected and the flavours were well balanced and delicious."
"Pours jet black with a tan colored head. In the aroma, a mellow sweet roast. In the taste, a sweet roasty malt and hints on chocolate. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry to sweet licorice like aftertaste. Hides the alcohol, a nice roast but a bit sweet. Nice, but just above average."
"I had just one, and I was ready for the second, even if, I suspect, the alchool would hit me too much."
"D: Very drinkable, and a bargain at the price (£2). Certainly recommended. Will drink again."
"D: Good stout. Can't say it's my fav but the drinkability of this one is high based on how much you could do in a session."
"The mouthfeel is good, if unremarkable. It's a bit sharp at first, but mellows out to a nice creaminess. On the lighter-side of full-bodied. The drinkability? Off the charts for the style. My snifter disappeared in 20 minutes, which is crazy for a RIS. This might be helped by the lower ABV than is typical for the style, but this is quite drinkable no matter what you call it. This is the rarity - an Imperial Stout that I could work into a beer rotation! This is an immensely drinkable RIS that I absolutely love. It's a classic for good reason. Highly recommended."
"O - A bit easier to drink than I expect for an RIS. Not necessarily a ""bad"" thing, but I expected more from the beer."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thin pale tan head. No lacing is left on the glass and the head seems to dissipate fairly quickly. Smells of roasted malt, with a faint hint of chocolate and cherries. Some tartness is in the flavour, but it works nicely with the roast. Silky mouthfeel. This is much simpler than many imperial stouts I've had, but I really enjoy it."
"D: Very drinkable, paticularly for an impy stout (at ABV 7%, I would dispute this). As a stout, outstanding, as an impy stout, okay."
"Will I drink this beer again, YES!"
"D: An easy and enjoyable one to drink; this doesn't go down in a hurry, but I never have to try to remember to take sips."
"Cheers!"
"From the 550 ml. bottle stamped SL15J1. Sampled on March 3, 2011. Rich, ultra-dark brown to nearly black pour. Opaque with a full, foamy head. The aroma is of a good, dark malt character but also a tad boozy. It seemed boozier in aroma than the 7% ABV would imply. The body is nice and bold. The taste is a fine balance of coffee, yeast, and a wonderfully dry finish. This is an excellent choice for Imperial Stout fans because it is enjoyable and more widely available than other Imperial Stouts."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, although watery in the middle as I mentioned, but very well aided by the carbonation and is reasonably well-bodied for the beginning and end of each sip. Drinkability is great, as this beer doesn't assault you with flavors, but rather allows them to come out softly of their own accord. Amount of flavor for the 7% abv is admirable as well considering the style. Finish could be a little bit better, as it is only kind of bitter and a tad watery, while I'd prefer it to be either neutral or heavily bitter, but it is good nonetheless. Really good, affordable, and common RIS; I'd buy this again for sure."
"330cl brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's. Pours a completely opaque black body with a good inch of tan head. Dark chocolate and toffee comprise the better part of the aroma with slight espresso and nutty notes. Deep roasty espresso and dark chocolate dominate the flavor with slight herbal and toffee notes make up the flavor with just hints of herbal hops. Fairly dry finish. Medium to full in body with medium carbonation. One sip definitely invites another. Roasty and fairly dry. A bit of a sipper though one sip invites another. Wow. Another slam-dunk for Samuel Smiths. A malt-forward traditional example of the style. Awesome."
"This beer will be making another appearance in my home in the future."
"A nice introductory RIS, although I personally prefer a bigger and bolder example. Very easy to drink and it is very affordable and easy to find which makes this a nice choice."
"Final notes: Not bad, not great. I would consider drinking this again if it weren't for the price. However, there are better Imperial Stouts to be had."
"Drinkability is fantastic. Full flavor, so enjoyable. Very nice."
"This is lightly carbonated, medium to full in body; however, very wetting to the palate though for a slightly warm finish. This is one of the most pleasant Imperial Stouts I've had."
"Quite interesting to have the dark fruit play a role in this after having more run of the mill imperial stouts as well. That being said, my personal preferences were probably better off without it. Still a good drink."
"Drinkability was decent. Lots of ester and raisin. Even splitting the bottle, 1 was enough."
"D: Low abv in terms of imperial stouts go, I'd love to make this one a session beer. Like most SS beers, there's not much complexity to it, but it is damn good"
"This is a good imperial stout. It's full of flavor with roasted coffee dominating and then chocolate and coffee bitterness balancing it out. It feels more carbonated than recent imperial stouts I've had but is still smooth. I'd like it to be more syrupy but this is still worth a buy. Try it with steak!"
"D - Still great after all these years. Geez, I remember 10-15 years ago, I actually thought this stuff tasted like soy sauce!"
"This is very drinkable and a nice change of pace from the big stouts I've been drinking lately. Putting a few of these away wouldn't be a problem."
"Pours pitch black with just the slightest tinges of dark brown when held up to the light. Head was 1 inch that fades to a small cap. Lacing is spotty and random on the glass. Smell is of roasted malt, overripe dark fruit, and soy sauce. Taste is of bitter chocolate, burnt coffee, and slight dark fruit essence. There is a lingering roasty taste on the tongue after each sip. Good carbonation and rich mouthfeel. Not too thick or thin. Drinkability is good and the price point on this beer will lend itself to an easy buy again."
"Stupidly drinkable. I could drink these all night. A nice change from the roast / hop fail bombs from the American brewers."
"poured a dark brown coffee color with 3 finger collar of copper foam. not the typical imperial stout, this one was quite sweet, which i didnt mind too much because i felt like it blended well with the other characteristics of the beer. had a nice bite to towards the end and it left me wanting more. overall good beer."
"An interesting flavor but a bit put off by an almost lager feel. Roasted malts start to take over about halfway through. This one's definitely better near room temperature"
"Poured a massive 3"" mocha colored head which took a long time to dissipate to 1/4"". Dark as coffee. Smell is roasted grains and coffee with the slightest hint of chocolate. Taste is a little sour, like a sourdough rye bread but with the sweetness and some tartness like fig. Body is only medium, not as thick as other Imperials. Still, a really nice quality product and at a competitive price especially for an import."
"D- Very smooth, a little too caramely for my taste. Good beer would recommend everyone trying it at least once."
"Very drinkable. A very pleasant earthy taste with alcohol well hidden. Just an extremely well crafted beer."
"D - a great treat after a long workweek, and for like $3, you could easily do much worse"
"Drinkability: This gets high marks for drinkability because of the wonderful taste, especially compared to the ABV. Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a classic."
"I would not hesitate to serve this Imperial Stout to fellow beer aficionados."
"I like this as I am exploring this style."
"Overall this beer is offers great enjoyment and is a good accompaniment for food or just watching a game."
"The mouth is creamy and smooth. Much more so than expected with the thin pour. The chocolate comes through in the flavor, but is much sweeter like milk choc., rather than dark choc. Licorice and butter toffee round this out. Easy-drinking ""big"" stout. With the lower ABV compared to its contemporaries in the style, this would be a great one to sit back and enjoy most any evening."
"A solid R.I.S. I must say easily available in all areas and a must trying for veterans and beginner's of the style."
"Poured into a etched imperial pint glass. Pours a very dark color with a medium brown head that just stays forever. Smells of plump dark fruits, and crusts of brown bread. Some bourbon on the nose as well. Tastes of dark rye bread, some licorice as well, and some vanilla and some expresso bitterness at the end. Smooths and evens out as you drink, smooth mouthfeel, not as thick as i would have thought. This is a very drinkable RIS. Not my favorite but a damn good beer."
"D: Gorgeous beer. Helps it is a low ABV RIS, so you don't feel bad about drinking one on your own."
"D: Drinkability is very high with this stout due to the great taste and low abv. Every stout lover needs to give this one a try, you won't be disappointed."
"I'd have another. I like that it's a little less alcoholic than other RISes, because then I can definitely have a few. This is a great winter beer, according to my taste buds."
"Pours a deep dark black with great cap of brown dense bubbles, good retention. Strong scent of roasted grain with molasses, dark fruit, licorice, bitter chocolate and hints of char, soy sauce. Bitter burnt grain taste, strong char with the bite of molasses, chicory and licorice on top of bitter chocolate, dark fruit faint hints of soy, very little sweetness. Medium bodied, suprisingly and disapointingly light for the style, very dry finnish. Slightly disapointed in the lack of complexity or firm body."
"Overall, this was an interesting Russian imperial. I think that on most days I wouldn't be fond of the overwhelming licorice, but this was actually quite nice and well rounded."
"This beer poured a dark, dark brown to black in color with a three finger medium, soft and spongy moderate khaki head. The aromas are very surprising. Oddly enough, the first aroma that hits the nose is of bacon fat. It has slight smoked notes that are driving me nuts. At this point in the evening, I'm totally digging it. Aside from that you get some roasted and dark malts with a subtle sweetness. The flavors are pretty solid too. It begins with silky smooth chocolate before going into light coffee and roasted malts. It's an excellent mix! Everything is blended so well together. I can't believe I waited so long to finally try this one. It drinks medium bodied and is very smooth going down. The mouthfeel is on point. It's perfect. I honestly cannot believe I'm enjoying this so much. I never expected a beer of this caliber from Sam Smith. This is one of the most drinkable RIS around. It's crazy really."
"D - anyone can easily drink this, I enjoyed this beer alot."
"D- A splendidly drinkable RIS. Low abv for style makes it even more drinkable. While I may like the flavors of something like Stone IRS more, this was just so smooth and easy drinking."
"Sometimes Russian Imperials are too sweet for me, but this one is very well balanced. Great beer."
"D - The sourness of British ales has always been a little bit of a turn off for me. I enjoy them, but not in quantity. I tend to prefer the crisp hoppy bite of American ales, rather than the smooth, sour creaminess of British beers. Still this beer brought me back to the time I spent in the UK and was enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer that seems to be readily available -- excellent flavors and scents that aren't so massive that they wreck your palate or anything; body isn't too thick or heavy either, so it's not as if it weighs you down. Really, a great choice and I can see what it has the ratings it does."
"D: One of the best. Ever. Really."
"D: Great straight forward clean flavor. Not the most rich, potent or flavorful of the style, but it doesn't have to be. This is a great easy drinking RIS, and while I may not prefer it to Old Rasputin or Ten FIDY, I can see how this is considered one of the best."
"Purchased at Piccolo's Wine Shop."
"Overall, I'd consider this a world class beer. Very very good. I'll definitely have this one again."
"Creamy mouthfeel that is lighter than the most prominent American craft stouts. But, the lower comparative abv makes it more drinkable. Superb brew."
"The taste is dominated by the roast. It's pleasant and not astringent. The beer isn't overwhelming in any way, but it's very solid. This isn't what I expect from a RIS, but maybe that's my American palate. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but the carbonation makes up for that. It's extremely drinkable and I'm enjoying this quite a bit. It's not an ""Oh my God"" experience, but I'd definitely drink one again. The price is pretty good, too."
"D - 100% yes. This is a damn smooth stout. Relatively low ABV at 7% makes it highly drinkable. This is a winner."
"A very sold Stout. This is always very enjoyable beer. It's a comfort beer that I could drink any time of the year. There's a certain delicacy about it that makes you want to savor every sip."
"This might not be the biggest, most robust, most extreme stout out there, but for 7% ABV, it's hard to beat. My favorite beer from Samuel Smith so far."
"Glass: Snifter"
"Flavor follows suit with chocolate up front and offering a somewhat dry finish overall with a touch of fruit in the background. A nice and drinkable RIS that doesn't tackle the senses. Not far from a Baltic Porter in many respects...."
"The CPJ"
"For the inexpensive price and pocket size go to feel of the bottle, this is a great go to stout which just makes drinkability a little better than good. This is a very good place to start for this style."
"D- This is a good beer overall-I guess it can take partial credit for making imperial stouts a popular style. I'm actually surprised at the roasted character of this one. Its a good, readily availabe option for an Imp stout-at nearly 1/3 the alcohol of Black Tuesday!"
"Overall an awesome beer. They should cange their marketing because it sucks I never had their beers before. Needless to say I will be having them again."
"This rich looking dark-brown-almost-black offering is a force to be reckoned with. Dark chocolate and molasses flavors blend almost seamlessly with a raisiny sweetness and a smoky malt finish. Medium bodied and very well balanced. Regal old world labeling complements the style effectively. Not as in your face as many other Imperials, but can go toe-to-toe in understated style with most of them."
"Value: Priced reasonably and oh so good. Go get some."
"Other comments: Delightfully more balanced than the typical American Imperial Stout."
"mouhfeel and drinkability were hurt by the tangy flavor as it left an odd after taste, will give the beer another chance in the future and if necessary re review"
"Final Thoughts: Well, it seems to me instead of coming across as burnt, this beer has ample smoke taste and sensations to it. Now I do like a good cigar every now and then, so I really did appreciate it, but I could see it putting some people off. That being said, it certainly didn't put me off and I would certainly buy it again even though I had to pay ten bucks for it. Thumbs up."
"Very good beer!"
"Skal!!!"
"Poured from bottle into dimple glass. It pours a deep black with a copper head that disappears quickly. Looks like a typical stout, lacking the show-stopping head of a Guiness. This beer smells absolutely beatiful. Lots of fruit in the aroma, which surprised me for a stout, but it almost smelled like wine. Also smells of malt, chocolate and coffee. Palate is full, thick and velvety smooth as a stout should be. The flavor is coffee, malt, chocolate with a fruity tang. Has a bit of a winey alcohol flavor as it warms. It's extremely complex, yet very drinkable."
"Solid. Not amazing, not great. Solid beer."
"overall, a great transition from aroma to aftertaste, with a unique, win-like aroma, burnt aftertaste, and a steady, but not overwhelming presence of chocolate. a fine beer indeed."
"Cheers!"
"D: One of the more drinkable imperial stouts I have had. Could easliy drink a few pints of it. Nice smooth silky mouthfeel, seems thinner than it should be."
"Drinkability - This is a great beer. Would have to be careful with the 7.0% ABV. Easily drinkable on this cold, cold, windy night. It fit perfectly. This would probably just be a Winter beer for me, however."
"Drinkability: I'm a little underwhelmed by this beer. I really want to like it, but it ultimately falls flat on it's taste and mouthfeel. I prefer the Oatmeal Stout and Taddy Porter to this hands down."
"D: Quite drinkable, definitely glad I purchased the four pack for this one. Very, very good."
" For an imperial stout this has great drinkability. Alc is low enough so that one could enjoy several bottles on a cold afternoon/night. Never gets too sweet like many American stouts and that's what I really enjoy about this, that is is very...well, stout."
"D - If you can fathom the 7% abv flavor I guess it makes a nice sipper. I deff wouldnt crack a second one the same day. would be dissapointed if this were a dessert beer or night cap.."
"One of the first high quality brews I ever had. Loved it then, love it now."
"All-in-all, a phenomenal Imperial Stout. The ABV could be a tad higher, but it might offset the wondrous taste that this already has. If I was on an empty stomach, I could use these as a viable meal. Amazing!"
"Overall I'm still undecided on the Impy's. A little too much alcohol, but still very good and complex flavor patterns. This one's good, but too much for 1 person and not enough to split (only 550ml.) Probably not going to buy again but a very good Imperial. Great beer Samuel Smith Old Brewery!!"
"D: Probably not a session beer but a darn good Impy."
"Drink- So far every Samuel Smith I have had has been excellent. Very easy to drink with a great flavor. And for 2.49 for a 12oz. Not bad."
"Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured pitch black with a two finger tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and vanilla. The flave was of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, dark chocolate, vanilla, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice RIS. The flavors were excellently blended and well balanced. The vanilla aspect was also a pretty nice touch as well. The aroma was pretty good too with lots of nice notes shining through. This brew is a definite must try if you have not done so already. I can see why it is in the Top 100 at the time of this review."
"Definitely one of the better stouts and another solid offering from Samuel Smith's. Highly recommended."
"M- Full side of medium bodied, creamy & velvety - but with a firm level of fine-textured CO2. Very drinkable for a big roasty classic brew."
"D: Low ABV for a stout of my liking, price is right, decent bang for your buck stout."
"Pours a dark black with a large tan head. Scent is roasted coffee and dark fruits. There is also a bit of chocolate, molasses, and alcohol aroma. Taste is initially dark fruits, quickly followed by chocolate, vanilla, and nuttiness. It finishes with a delightful roasted coffee/espresso flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied. Ours very thick, but doesn't feel as thick as it looks. Slightly velvety. Drinkability is high, and with this beer being so affordable (2.99 for 550ml bottle), I could drink it all the time!"
"I'll definitely be getting this again. Great, readily accessible brew."
"Very full creamy mouthfeel, with plenty of small gentle carbonation to really emphasize the chewiness of the beer. Very easy to drink beer with the alcohol hidden, but not quite the imperial stout I was expecting."
"Notes: A classic. Taste is delightfully complex. Quality craftsmanship is very evident here. My only criticism is that it isn't quite as big and bold as I would like, but sometimes I feel that my palate is jaded after having all these overblown American versions of the style."
"Drinkability was I had one it that was enough. the dark fruit was just not getting it done with my palate."
"Overall, a good RIS but far from the top of the list of my favorite RIS's. Just didn't grab me and seemed way too reliant on the dark fruit aroma and taste. Missing the complexity of the better RIS out there. No dating info so maybe I got a bad one but this seems to match other review descriptions. Avail here in TX. Rotation - worth trying once but that's enough for me. [N;O]"
"D: This was the first imperial stout i've ever had so I wasn't exactly sure what to get. After having this again I appreciated this beer a lot more."
"D: What's not to like? Sure, it is widely available and not a cult beer. O.K., it wasn't aged in a bourbon barrel or brewed with cocoa nibs or chicory. If you want a good stout at a good price, it is hard to beat."
"D- Very drinkable. Good complexity and flavors. Delicious"
"D - solid all around, yet a good treat helped nicely by its availability and price point ($2.50!). a great nightcap or dessert beer, with a lot of beauty hidden in its simplicity."
"Medium to medium high carbonation with a superb mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden, but you get a great warming sensation as you drink. A great choice for a winter's night."
"M: Medium to full body with a slight feeling of carbonation."
"Pours a nice black with decent tan head. pretty good lacing. Smell is of roasted coffee, some raisins and plums, and can pick up some smoke. The flavor is about the same as the nose but with a kind of a stronger graininess about it, smoky, and sort of astringent. Mouthfeel was thinner than expected and medium dryness. Easy enough to drink but I'd rather have the oatmeal stout from them."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is black in colour and has an excellent light tan coloured head. The smell is of sweet malty raisins with some alcohol as well. The taste is of nice smokey malt with no bitterness at the end. Delicious. The texture is nice and creamy. This is an very nice Russian Imperial stout."
"D: Sort of disappointing since I really like their Oatmeal Stout. I'm fine with not having this one again."
"I don't know -- it's pretty hard to find fault with this one. Just a fantastic brew overall."
"I enjoy this beer and will be buying it again in partially because I like the 550ml size and its a fair price."
"My first Sam Smith. Pours a dark brown color with a caramel colored soapy head. Has an aroma of molasses and dark fruit with a hint of chocolate. Very creamy and malty. Sweet up front and nice subtle bitters on the back end. It is missing something, a tad bland. But a decent IS."
"I just had this beer with Thanksgiving Dinner and it was wonderful. The best I've had from the Samual Smith's line. Great black appearance with a wonderful light brown head about 2 fingers thick. Very drinkable with only a very minor touch of hop aftertaste. This Sam Smith was my first Imperial Stout and I now know why this style of beer is so highly regarded amongst the BA crowd. I will definitely buy this again and also try other Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Drinkability: Pretty good overall, good flavor and a good feeling make this stout quite a nice drink."
"I poured into a pint glass to a mountain of mocha head. The body of the beer is dark brown with ruby highlights. The are all kinds of aromas wafting from this beer. I smell plums, black cherries, chocolate, and coffee. The taste begins with the dark fruit flavors and fades into dark chocolate and roasted coffee. The roasted malt lingers just enough to leave me wanting another taste. It has a creamy mouthfeel. This is another solid offering from Sam Smith's. I have really enjoyed everything that I have sampled so far."
"Overall good beer, certainly don't have a lot of experience with this style and seems to be from the style guidelines on the lighter end of the style."
"4.5 D: This is a lot like the oatmeal stout, though paradoxically, less flavorful. There was some time between finishing the oatmeal and starting this (including some non-spicy food) so I think I'm not too desensitized. Anyway, this is good too and very drinkable. I could go for another one of these as well. Finally, in a world where ""imperial"" has been designated for massively huge beers, it's good to see a beer like this use the title."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter, jet black, medium tannish head, light lacing. Big notes of mollasses, and dark fruit, light notes of chocolate and coffee. Taste better than it smells, lots of dates, and plums dipped in mollasses. It finishes with a lingering coffee finish, sweeter than other RIS. Full in body, creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Really good beer, better than expected."
"D - Although this is not a heavy RIS it has some real qualities that make this beer a very good example of the style."
"Tastes of so many things: coffee, chocolate, prunes, plums, slight smoke, malt, some hops, caramel, molasses. Excellent all around. I had this with a rare steak seasoned only with salt - fantastic pairing!"
"D: Fairly easy to take down."
"The mouthfeel is nice, somewhat creamy, really enjoyable. Surprisingly I really enjoyed this one over the other Sammy Imperials that I've tried which makes me want to try this stout again."
"Drinkability: I could see people getting full off of a stout beer but as for this one, it seems a little on the light side of stouts. Definitely a good beer for being outdoors, camping, or fishing with the guys."
"This is a nice Imperial Stout. However, so many beers in this style provide incredible depth of flavor, and really take it to another level. I appreciate the craft, but I'd rather have their oatmeal stout any day of the week."
"D - Good. Usually can't drink multiple imperial stouts but this one is an exception."
"D: Very good."
"The body is full, as expected, pretty easy to drink though. The carbonation was mild but ample. Ultimately, it was very creamy with a dryish finish. Damn Good, and surprisingly easy to drink."
"Second try, quite unpleasant taste, didn't finish bottle"
"This is the first imperial stout that I have had the pleasure of drinking in quite some time, and this offering wastes no time in reminding me why the RIS is one of my favorite styles. An absolutely fantastic beer."
"D this is really great. but not to be guzzled, more like savored VERY rich and creamy."
"D : Quite quaffable, almost session-able, solid low ABV sout.,"
"A beautiful near pitch black beer with an good tan head. The head slowly retreats, leaving thick and creamy lacing, so nice and sticky. I can almost smell a sweet bourbon and some black licorice. Really a toasted malt to almost smokey flavor but then some brown sugar sweetness too. Aftertaste is smooth and bitter in a creamy way, reminds me of quality dark chocolate, not sweet at all. A little bit of alcohol is present when one slurps the beer from the glass, instead of pouring it in the mouth, pretty damn good to say the least. The mouthfeel is loose yet thick and creamy, really complex, one could probably write a poem about it. This is an almost perfect beer and the lower alcohol content makes it more drinkable than of others of this style. Slightly heavy with a roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste, complex yet strong and makes it less drinkable, but only by a bit. Who wants a beer that is drinkable like water any way though? Certainly not me, I like a meal in a glass."
"D: a tasty beer. nothing spectacular but a solid choice for a stout example"
"Overall, its a good beer but not as good as I was expecting, I like SS Oatmeal Stout a little bit more."
"Poured this brew on a snifter it casts a very dark brown brew with a beige, creamy and rich full crown that has a good retention. Full body with nice carbonation. The aromas are of strong roasted coffe, dark malts and dark cocoa, no alcohol perceived on the nose. The first sip brings the dark malts out followed by the roasted coffe and closing in with a nice touch of dark cocoa that gives it a great finish, with no lingering notes. Nothing overpowering. More drinker friendly than Old Ras but its an exceptional example of the style."
"The mouthfeel is thinner than the pinnacle of the style, but the light carb makes it feel creamy. There's some lingering roast and slight bitterness in the finish. A fine beer, and it paired very well with the English cheeses and sausage plate that welcomed us to this wonderful tasting."
"I'm not interested in another beer. Unlike my last few beers of the night I won't be pour out the remainder to avoid getting too buzzed (drunk?). That's mostly because this is my last beer of the night. It's not a drinker or sipper. I don't get what these oatmeal stouts that aren't overly strong are going for. I don't want to sip it on a cold night. I don't feel I should grab a cigar to go with. I don't want to drink quickly and I don't see this going with any food I'd eat. So what's left?"
"D= A very drinkable Imperial stout, with a lovely alcohol warmth and lots of toffee and fruit sweetness. Not my favorite RIS, but certainly one of my favorite English RIS' and one of the better offerings from Samuel Smith's."
"Cheers!"
"Really creamy mouthfeel, medium body but silky smooth."
"Pours a deep brownish black color with some minor red highlights. Looks very classic and produces a massive light tan head with some lacing. The aroma is strong toffee, chocolate, a touch of espresso and rich roasted malts. Really inviting. The flavor is very nice with lots of roasty malts and a big dark chocolate bitterness on the finish. Great toffee and even burnt coffee flavors meld nicely with it's sweetness. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink, though it's Thinner than most RIS out there. Great off dry finish with a bitter kick to level the sweetness. This is the most drinkable RIS I have had so far. Really nice."
"D- very heavy...could only have about 1 or 2 of these in a night..hits the taste buds hard"
"Drinkable? Very much, but what sense does knocking back a few make when one doesn't get the Russian Imperial Stout experience? Between this and other common examples, I would rather have my senses assaulted than experiencing the English kind that gets exported to the Americas."
"Drinkabilty- Easy to drink. I really enjoy this one. I probably could not drink more than 1 in a ""sitting""."
"D: Ehh, It was nice to try, but there are too many better options out there for me to go looking for this one again."
"Drinkability -- This is a very pleasant RIS. Glad I finally pulled the trigger on this one."
"Drinkabilty - Beening a imperial stout, this is way to easy to drink. I want a whole case so i can drink this beer weekly. Sammy smith proves, you dont need to be the hoppiest, the strongest or maltest to be the best, this is unmatched in taste, the best!"
"D - Obviously this is a heavier beer. Great with hearty stews and spicy foods."
"This was the first imperial stout I ever tasted and it probably doesn't stand up to some of the bigger stouts out there, but it's damn drinkable and very tasty."
"It is a little weird that at 7% the booze in this one is not very well-hidden. What's weirder is that I think it works for the beer in that alcohol flavors are pretty normal for other popular big ABV guys in the style."
"This is one of my go to RIS. It is quite drinkable and is beer that emphasizes malt characteristics. It pours a dark brown much like coffee, and has a foamy tan head. Dark fruit flavours are at the for front, with just enough hop bitterness to balance it out. This beer is also excellent to use in cooking desserts like chocolate cake, I tried it also in a pot roast, but found the fruity, molasses, and well ""Christmas"" flavours did not work as well. A fine example of the style."
"Overall, this is a damn good beer that changes in flavor and aroma as it warms, but the complexity remains constant. If you see this around, pick it up, as it's a good example of the style and it's actually pretty drinkable for a RIS at only 7%. Good stuff yet again from Sammy Smith."
"D-Good for a RIS, but not great. I like this and always want more when I finish a single 12 oz. bottle, but it doesn't achieve the rich complexity it aspires to. Not quite on par with other offerings from Samuel Smith."
"D - Well balanced flavors, and not too strong. A very drinkable RIS."
"D: A classic for sure. Balanced flavors and a refined profile makes this a pleasant sipper that doesn't try to punish the palate."
"D- Easy drinking, nothing to complex here taste wise.. but its easy to have a few due to the thin/medium body and smooth flavors."
"Overall it was an unimpressive beer, kind of a watered down version of a Yeti, de Molen or Hercule. I will try to have it again in order to see if my beer was wrong."
"Drinkability: At 7.0% ABV, much more drinkable than other RIS. Also, the value on this beer is incredible. Very reasonably priced."
" a solid beer and it worked well with this chilly summer evening, I'll be taking a refresher course in Sam Smith this week"
"D: Highly drinkable. Lower ABV and lighter than the American incarnations of the style I've mostly been trying, but still having enough... ponderability?. Great for when you want an RIS but its 105f in Texas. Will definitely pick up again."
"For the price, I did not expect to get this high of quality. Very happily surprised."
"Poured into a strange(stick) glass..It's very dark and has quite a big head..It smells like dark chocolate with a bit of roastiness..The taste is very balanced, with a dark chocolate being the prominent flavor..It feels very smooth in the mouth and somewhere between light and heavy..I feel like I can drink a couple pints of this and enjoy it the whole time...A very good beer, and one I will go to time and time again.."
"D: I love ISs, but hate feeling wasted after half a bomber. I could probably knock back a couple of these in a night and not regret it. Yet another wonderful brew from what may be my favorite brewery."
"Thanks again to Platinum Liquor Sydney."
"The mouthfeel is average thickness for the style but it has a very nice creaminess to it. Drinkability is very good, it's a very well made and classic beer. It had a lot of interesting and different flavors from a lot of the Imperial Stouts that I've had, and thankfully they were also pretty good flavors. Very nice beer to sip on this evening."
"Black pour with a tall, frothy, tan head. The aroma has lots of roasted malt, with light notes of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. There's a slight off sour note in there too. The flavor has gentle notes of roast and coffee with a little more milk chocolate than in the aroma. Over all the flavor has a bit of metallic dullness though. The body is creamy with soft carbonation but a tad thin for an imperial stout."
"Bottle via TheJester. Aroma is a mix of dark chocolate and red fruits such as cherries and rasberries. There is also vanilla, blueberry and grapes. Very nice. Flavor is on the sweet side with caramel, toffee and cherries with a nice bittersweet chocolate finish. Very enjoyable light oily palate."
"A flavorful, strong stout which would make for a great dessert beer."
"D = Excellent. This is an extraordinary beer. Maybe not as strong as other examples of the style. Particularly milder than american interpretations, but still a damn good beer. Balance is great and it is one fine sippin' beer. At 7%ABV it is not one of the strongest out there for the style, so very drinkable. I would rather enjoy this one slowly, but if pressed, I'm sure I could down a four pack with ease."
"Good but not a standout in this style."
"Taste is like a Guinness on stereoids. It's more toasty and boozy but not too bad. Quite tasty, I'm looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"Nothing special here."
"M- Very dry, full bodied but nothing insane. Carbonation is a bit high."
"d - A pretty good imperial stout that is heavy on the dark fruits in both the smell and taste. Would try again."
"A good, rather modest but not so sweet, imperial stout. Feels genuine. Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"Medium to thin body, not an overly complex brew but a pleasant quaff and with the low ABV (for style) you can imagine drinking this one often."
"Ruby-black, lots of tan head, only a little retention, but plenty of lace. The perfect stout would have better head retention. Slightly fruity profile from the British yeast, pleasant sweet roastyness. Bittersweet; very well balanced. Dark caramel malt, mocha, raisins, smooth hop/roasted malt bitterness. Slight fruity tang in the aftertaste. Not much alcohol taste, but it does become more warming as it warms up. Very nice flavour, but lacking the depth of some. Moderate to full body, a little chalky. Moderate carbonation."
"drinks ok. flavor, aroma, and body are dominated a bit too much by molasses. complexity is lacking though its a decent brew."
"I wouldn't drink a whole bunch of these in a night personally, but that's just because I'm a Witbier man. As Stouts go, this is pretty darn good."
"Drinkability: This has to be the lowest ABV RIS beer I've ever had, but after awhile I can note the alcohol. Still - even though this is a one beer a night for me, it's a fantastic beer. Good with a meal (balsamic chicken and rice pilaf), good for sipping and savoring afterwards, and still appealing that now I want dessert. I think if you have a sweet tooth, this beer is for you, but I think it's a damn good stand alone beer in it's own right."
"A well-made beer that's rich enough to challenge you a bit. One to try every once in a while."
"Notes: This would be a session RIS if such a thing existed, while its nice for breaking noobs into big stouts, it is not a monster RIS in anyway."
"stout beers are by far my favorite beers and this is an exceptional brew. Smooth on the palat with minimal aftertaste and a nice arome, this is a great beer for beginners or expert stout entusiasts. This is a good beer with decent head and smoothe drinkability."
"D- I'd definitely drink it again. Really good flavor makes me want to check this out again come cooler weather. It drinks a little bigger than the 7% ABV would suggest. The alcoholic qualities definitely add to the enjoyment rather than detracting from it."
"This is a great example of an Imperial Stout, and probably now one of my favorite Samuel Smith beers."
"Drinkability is alright, not great couldn't have too many in a night."
"Need to pour carefully or you'll end fill half the glass with deep tan foam, good mixture of bubble sizes, uneven surface, dissolves noticeably slow with an unusually large amount of thick lacing. Dark brown color, closer to mahogany than black, clear liquid, not going for the easy ""totally opaque"" out. Big time banana, bubblegum in the nose, sweet without needing much from the caramel, café au lait, raisin bread, bread pudding or plum to cherry fruit scents, very low on the roast, quite unusual and unexpected, satisfying at face value. Full-bodied, fairly smooth and fluid without too much weight. Much more roast here in the coffee, dark chocolate, this along with a mineral water aspect gives it cut and definition. Still, no lack of coconut, banana, toffee to join the plum, apricot, cherry flavors. The carbonation not light, more subtle, if no less effective. As it warms you get more pork rinds and bacon notes through the finish. Familiar but individual enough to stand itself off to the side of the pack."
"The label on the stout 55cl bottle is a tad tacky, trying to look olde timey too much. When you open it, you're immediately slammed with fruity smells. This is only intensified as the coffee-black beer pours, leaving a dark tan head. In the goblet the lesser odour of yeast, and something faintly peppery peeks through. You definitely taste the peppery notes of the beer, a complex flavour almost like the offspring of coffee and banana. There are definitely bitter chocolates mixed into this mix. The carbonation is moderate, giving the beer a bit of a sparkling quality in the mouth. It's very reminiscent of Obsidian Stout by Deschutes, in a way, but with a sweet middle. In all, a pleasant though heady beer."
"d: good beer! I'd like a little less caramel flavor and more chocolate/espresso, but all in all not bad."
"D: Great beer however its a nightcap. The alcohol weighs a bit and along with that its a rather rich beer."
"Overall: Excellent stout overall. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I've had. It's not overly complex but it doesn't try to be. I would highly recommend this."
"A bit subtle for an imperial stout IMO, but hits all the buttons regardless. Nice one..."
"Delightfully complex but restrained. An occasional night cap."
"All in all, not bad, I'll try a few other brands so I can choose my favorite to age, this one was a little too heavy on the dark fruits, but pretty darn good for not being aged."
"D- I'm only going to give this a 4 here, because while there isn't any real booziness to it...the fruitiness puts me off. I'm not a huge fan of stouts that have the dark fruit in them as a rule, so yeah"
"This one I certainly recommend. Sooner or later I'll get to the Nut Brown Ale..."
"Another classic from the old Tadcaster Brewery."
"D - Overall I don't know why I can't find this in more places but would totally drive to Monroeville for another bottle and maybe one of their fruit beers I have been meaning to try."
"Impressions: Lovely and flavorful. Great after-dinner drink."
"D - no weaknesses, loads of well balanced flavors, and not too strong = a very drinkable RIS."
"D- One or two is enough, recommended with strong cheese, and smoked ""jamón Serrano""."
"Drinkability: Not too strong of a beer so you don't get much of a taste of alcohol. All the combined flavors make the drinkability high and enjoyable."
"An almost perfect example of bold goodness in a bottle. Black body with a thick, dark tan head. Smell and taste such a harmonious blend of coffee and chocolate sweet malts & bitters. Perfectly smooth and totally complex. I tell you when I opened it, I heard the sound of an English stream.."
"I'm torn. I like this beer, but frankly it isn't an imperial stout. Perhaps strong porter is more apt."
"Can't wait to compare to the bottle I have aging in the cellar."
"So, when you want something bolder than your average brew, but aren't in the mood for the overly aggressive or sweet malty mess of most big stouts, I'd say give this classic a shout."
"This is one of those wonderful ""meal in a bottle"" brews that I find so enjoyable. The flavors cover a wide range of the palate. The initial sip can be surprising for its variety and it maintains its interesting appeal throughout. The aftertaste is also quite pleasant; not bitter or overpowering. While not as sweet as some Russian Imperial Stouts that I have encountered, its balance makes it one that I have often heartily recommended to someone who is becoming more adventurous with their beer choices."
"D: It's easy to forget this is a great sipping beverage, to savor all the complexities going on. This looks like the standard to compare all other Imperial Stouts against."
"D-An extremely drinkable stout that is readily available. I normally like my stouts strong, powereful, dark and thick, but this is such a satisfying brew at a lower octane. I'm usually not a big fan of Samuel Smiths or English beers in general as they seem tepid in comparison to the wonderful availabilities here in the States, but this is one to keep on the list. I'm not abandoning my Ten Fidy, my Raspy or my Stone RIS, but this is very worthy."
"D: I thought this might be a delicately-flavored imperial stout considering the 7% abv, but this is very refined and extremely flavorful. Also a great alternative to all the smoky, insanely hopped American RISes flooding the market. Drinkability is very easy."
"D: while enjoyable, this was slightly less appealing. I would certainly try it again, as this was my first introduction to an Imperial. Can't see this being a go-to beer for me, but I'm happy to be proven wrong."
"Notes: A nice stout, but nothing that particularly blew me away. Features plenty of classical RIS tastes, but was a touch thin. I would gladly get this again, although I prefer the Oatmeal Stout more."
"D - I could drink this all night."
"Overall a finely tuned and masterfully balanced R.I.S. In a time where this style is all over the place, this stout is in perfect pitch. Very restrained and soft-spoken, but has a lot to say if you listen closely. When you're done with the chalice next to your ear, position it a quarter way around your head and tilt slowly and enjoy!"
"O: High drinkability. Perfect English Stout. Absolutely recommended"
"D - 550 mL isn't enough. Never enough. 5.0"
"Drinkability - love the complexity and balance of flavors and textures, but very filling, not a ""session"" beer at all"
"Pours a dark brown color with red and brown highlights around the edges. Produces less than a finger of tanned head without much retension. Sweet aroma of dark fruit and a bit of yeast. Tastes include burnt grain, bitter chocolate and a lingering taste of coffee is left in the mouth. Moderately carbonated and a very smooth medium feel. The type of smoothness I have now come to expect but is yet seemingly distinct about this brewery. For 7% the alcohol is fairly well hidden. The alcohol starts to come through in the finish as it warms."
"Beer is really smooth and tastes great. Full bodied, carbonation in the mouth is minimal. Leads with a sweetness followed by a slight bitterness of the roast. There is no aftertaste, good palate connectivity. I would recommend this beer and drink it as a repeat."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is good."
"Quite drinkable, low abv comparative to style with lots of flavor I didn't expect."
"D- very smooth, very complex, no flavor dominates another."
"D - I am pretty bummed by this, I usually really like Samuel Smith's beer but this is bad stuff. Definitely will not be drinking or buying this again."
"F: Semi bitter with more English hops, and lingering hot roast and dark malts. Some sweetness on the finish as well with more caramel and brown sugar."
"D: As it barely crosses over into imperial territory, the alcohol content is just right. If it didn't finish so dry, I would drink it all night long. Next to Old Raspy, this is my standby."
"The flavor is bigger on the roasted malt, which tastes like charred bread or meat, you k now the black caramelized parts. In addition a kind of mellow creaminess pervades allowing the raisins and cocoa to complement, not dominate, the roasted malt character. There's also a slight cola taste, which is really just caramel that seems to pick up towards the end. Over all the texture on this is very thick and authentic feeling. I can see how this inspired what American brewers are doing with stouts and to compare it to those ImpStoudts would be unfair as it helped give birth to the idea of bigger and bolder stouts. An excellent and simply traditional Stout, very tasty."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable IMO. An unexpected experience at 7.0%. I'm impressed. I've been drinking this for quite some time but never reviewed it until now. Certainly a more sessional beer as far as Imperial Stouts go. Pretty smooth. Good work SS."
"D: My favorite RIS as of this date. Very smooth and easy going RIS that warms the body and soul on a winter eve and does not incapacitate you with an alcoholic gut punch."
"Drinkability: Overall, a much milder RIS than the American-made ones I am used to. However, it is very easy drinking (at least by RIS standards) and it has a nice full and smooth body."
"F'ing OUTSTANDING BEER!!!..Beautiful black stout with an incredible tan head and nice lacing. Nose of sweet malt, light alcohol, & cocoa. Taste of sweet malt, cocoa, bitter espresso, with a bitter hop finish to counter the sweetness. Mouth feel is a bit thin for an imperial stout; not surprising, since at 7% ABV this is more a session stout than an imperial, but I was damn impressed. Very nicely done from a world class brewery."
"Drinkability- Fantastic considering the darkness and complexity of this brew. Perhaps it can get overwhelming after a few glasses."
"D - Might be a little on the low side with the complexity and teh ABV."
"This is a very easy beer to drink. It's actually a beer I would love to see my local English Pub put on tap. I could see myself ordering one of these after a rough day at work. The 7% Alcohol By Volume is barely noticeable in the taste, you almost have to be looking for it to find it. This is an excellent example of an n Imperial Stout;"
"D-- A 7% RIS??? Oh yeah, quite good and worth drinking. Biggest thing is how drinkable it is. Can be done all year. Not like other RIS' that really are fall/ winter beers due to the overcomplexity and high ABV %. This makes up for the smaller ABV by the flavor. Rich and full, yet drinkable. A real versatile beer. Can be sessionable and can be sipped and savored."
"I had good feelings about Samuel Smith's beers before, but the imperial stout has raised them to a higher level IMO."
"D - Very drinkable RIS. The ABV isn't too crazy either which makes this a great one to throw back. Will DEFINITELY be enjoying this brew over and over again."
"Drinkability- this stout is very easy to session but I think its because its almost extremely simplistic for what we have now come to expect from a good imperial stout, now I am not saying this is not a decent beer in its own right cuz its certainly enjoyable and easy to session through but its just not a game changer, short finish for sure and rather one dimensional, that said its worth trying and its certainly one you could easily session down with glee"
"A real pleasure.Pitch black with lots of chocolate and sweet roasted notes. A kind of burt molasses character on the palate with some serious choco malt, really cool. Full bodied with perfectly smooth carbonation. Not as strong or aggressive as some of the modern RIS styles but holds it's own no problem. The Barry White of beers."
"Smell, too much alcohol in the nose, especially for only 7%. Taste, nice, coffee, choco licorice. Mouthfeel, gets rid of the alcohol smell blast, some toffee or something along for the ride. Drinkable, but a little pricey. Too much dark fruit notes, alcohol for my tastes these days."
"pours a fairly viscous black, but not as stouty as i remembered. you always remember things as bigger than they actually are. One finger light tan head, minimal lacing. smells burnt coffee, peanuts, fruit, caramel. not as intense and bold as i like for an imperial. high carbonation with a tart, slight sour finish. the taste is light, but still wonderful."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable. Rich, but not too rich. Very delicious. Very Alcoholic."
"Full mouthfeel, foamy carbonation, a little sharp from alcohol. I like it -- not knocking my socks off, but a really nicely done representation &, I'm assuming, one of the most authentic examples of the style around."
"D: The aromas given off by this beer are a lot more complex than what I can describe. The ABV seems a little low for an IMPERIAL stout but this may make it even more enjoyable. I have never had their oatmeal stout because I do not generally enjoy low ABV drinks but if the taste is similar than I would most definitely want to try that as well, this one is fantastic!"
"Poured an almost perfect black the light could not pierce, into a sturdy mug. A finger thick dark tan head appeared atop, reminds me of a root-beer float, receeding slowly into the depths of this dark liquid, with little broken lace down the glass. The aroma i inhale is strong roast malt, coffee, and az it warms slightly, raisin. I raise the glass to lips in anticipation, and down the hatch.. cold coffee, bitter chocolate throughout, hops, dark fruit-prune/raisin. Medium-full body almost oily, feels lighter than its appearance might have you believe, with small/close, almost 'biting' bubbles on the tongue. Not a 'beginner' stout if there is such a thing, however very drinkable and enjoyable. Very tasty, a slight warmth is felt gradually with this 7% brew. If fate will have it i will drink this again, i recommend it to those looking for a quality stout, its a real treat. I feel very good/relaxed rite now, but dont want another glass, i am content, i am pleased. Cheers!"
"Overall/notes: Excellent beer, really. I drank this on a quiet night, and it was really relaxing, in a strange way. I still haven't had many imperial stouts, but I really am enjoying them. It also gave me an intense craving for chocolate. Go for it if you like imperial stouts."
"I'm not quite sure how to feel about this one. It feels just a bit away from being fantastic, but something about the sweet and sour aspect puts me off just a tad. Its not a deal breaker, but it just sits a bit uneasy. Sam Smith's always has amazing body and smoothness to their beer though, and this is a fine example of that."
"Overall this for me was my first Imperial Stout and it has not lost any of its luster of mystique throughout the years. Highly Recommended."
"Overall- i'm not usually a stout fan but i'm on a kick cuz of the weather. this brew is pretty good. if you're a stout fan and haven't tried this i don't know what you are doing. grab a bottle!!"
"Fairly complex but mild aroma of chocolate, coffee, licorice and roasted malt. Pure black in color with a thick and creamy espresso head. Tastes slightly sweet, mostly licorice, with mild bitterness at the end. Full bodied with creamy carbonation and a lingering sweet licorice finish. Well crafted and enjoyable but too heavy on the licorice to become a favorite."
"so very highly recommended. i recommend just about anything from this brewery. my oh my i am impressed."
"Pours opaque black with a big creamy light brown head. Sweet malty aroma with a licorice smell. Flavors of roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, and licorice. Alcohol is slightly noticable even though this is only 7%. Full bodied and creamy with a dry finish. I prefer Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout over this, but this one is very good too!"
"Into a pint glass: poured black with one finger of khaki head that laced spottily. Smelled of chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. Tasted of chocolate, toffee, and butterscotch, with a sweet'ish finish, and a slight roasted aftertaste. Medium-bodied and smooth on the palate. A nicely sessionable imperial stout, which is rare, but I'd much rather sip a stout with more robust flavor and mouthfeel."
"Overall it's a decent and distinctive stout. Not a bad beer but not a great one for me either, at least not in the Imperial stout style which is full of world class beers."
"D-very tasty and just a smoothness and creaminess that is awesome! nothing huge but a solid drink!"
"Notes: At 7%, labeling this an imperial stout is a slightly misleading, but that's of little consequence, since it's so good. Think of it as a stout of comparable quality to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, just without the oatmeal, and you've got yourself a winner. Another great offering from Samuel Smith."
"One of the great classics and I believe the lowest abv RIS ever to touch these lips. Darkest chocolate body with a dark caramel head. Nice lacing and the head retains well. Powerful notes of roasted barley in the nose. Maybe the most roasted barley I have seen in a beer since the Dogfish head WWS. This is also very fruity for the style. Sweet molasses to back up the barley presence, plum and prunes in the aroma as well. The taste is complex to say the least, molasses, birch syrup, jammy plums and blackberry preserves, nice rich toffee notes, fig, dark sour cherries and a raisin wine richness. Like a complex, fine port wine-a true treat, I'm so happy it can be found regularly in my parts. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and silky on the tongue. Moderately chewy and very rich, enjoy with chocolate or vanilla ice cream to bring out the many intricacies."
"A classic example of the British end of the style. Not aggressively hopped or knockout big like some American classics in the same vein. So it's a lot more drinkable."
"Might be the greatest imperial stout ever. How it remains imperial at 7% i don't know that intrigues me, usually imperials i see around go around 8 percent and up, molson xxx is 7 percent. but the color is great and black, the smell is nice and malty, chocolaty, and creamy. the taste is the previous description creamy of some sorts, not like stone russian imperial. real smooth, light thickness. what ever brewery that can hide the alcohol levels and not taste it has a good skill level. if i want to taste alcohol to bad i'll drink some vodka or others. ya dig."
"Taste/Mouthfeel - Defenitely A feel of heavy molasses around my palate with chocolate aftertaste and the alcohol to smooth it out... Very pleasant. Found myself sipping and sipping and did not even notice my snifter glass had gone dry. Very drinkable Imperial Stout."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin and light, but fairly smooth. Drinkable, especially for a RIS."
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby edges, half inch tan head. Considering this one started foaming before the pour, surprised at the staid head. Smell: You can smell this one from a few feet away, but it's not really what I want in an RIS. Buttery, earthy, burnt sugar, sweet. Taste: lightly roasted, hops are mostly earthy and a tad leafy, diacetyl, toffee. A mineral-ly, hard water thing going on, but fairly smooth and active carbonation. There's a chance that this is closer to the original intent of the style than the US craft interpretation, but I prefer the latter by a wide margin. This was pretty disappointing."
"D: A really nice imperial stout, that is very enjoyable. I think this is a very good take on the style and would love to session this...the abv is very well hidden."
"D- Tasty, economical, and a good ABV will keep me coming back for seconds... or 55ths."
"D: At only 7% ABV, it's the not the heaviest stout out there, but it is excellent. A great balance of flavors and a rich, creamy body make this a wonderful experience."
"D: This is a very approachable imperial stout. I wish this was one of my introductions to the style as there are no flavors that really overwhelm the palate. This is also a little lower in alcohol for the style, but it allows this beer to be highly drinkable."
"D) Great! 7% ABV is reasonable for an imperial stout and is really not noticeable. This is a smooth and tasty drink."
"M/D - nice body, hard to describe. Not thin, not chewy. Easy to drink, clean and tasty."
"D: Smooth and creamy, tasty and easy to drink. This is what I would give to someone who wants to try this style for the first time."
"Notes: Samuel Smith, brewer of some of the most classic beers (Oatmeal Stout, Nut Brown Ale) disappointed me with this one. As suggested, my palate is spoiled by other, much more engaging American craft RIS's."
"Pours pitch black with a huge tan three finger head that retains better than almost any beer I have seen, nice and creamy as well. No lacing at all but it might be my glass. Smells of roasted malts and a metallic scent, not liking this metal thing at all. Also some dark sweet fruits in the nose. The taste is out of whack to me. It has nice roasted malts but also has a huge metallic taste, more than any beer I can think of. It kind of throws the balance off and ruins it. After reading other reviews I definitely get soy sauce, yuck. The extremely sweet fruity taste in this beer also does not belong in an imperial stout. Some hops compliment the finish but the sweetness of this beer is way too overwhelming. Also some cocoa behind the metallic sweetness. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice and creamy with good carbonation and a coat of that sweetness. No warming really at all. The drinkability here is not good, the sweet/metallic taste is hardly tolerable. The roasted malts save it but I can hardly finish the bottle. The price was very good but I will only try this one again if I really, really don't trust this bottle. The worst part is the appearance was so good I thought I was in for a super cheap Imperial treat."
"Only the stomach and this beer's cost impedes its drinkability."
"D- This is an excellent representation of a stout, and I believe this is my first imperial version. I very much enjoyed drinking this beer, and I think it would be a very good compliment to an aged cheddar or similar type of cheese. It would be good with a rich beef dinner as well. I don't think I'd have another bottle after the first however, as it's so rich and full that it's almost a meal in itself. Great job overall!"
"A great RIS, that shows you can create a hugely flavorful beer without a similarly huge ABV."
"D - Good overall. I am enjoying the beers of Samuel Smith. Great English brewery."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink for the style."
"Great example of a drinkable stout. Reminds me why I like this company. Sadly I haven't seen it here where I live, but glad I got to try it. Would have to agree with fishbrew decent stout to introduce someone to the style I think."
"Overall, a phenomenal RIS, and I imagine a great beer for introducing someone to the style. I could live on this beer."
"Will without a doubt be drinking this one again."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Since the ABV is so low (compared to others in the style) this could be a pretty good ""session"" Imperial Stout. It's just not for me. I'm a fan of big, thick and chewy, sticky and slimey stouts. This isn't one of those."
"(D)- A great stout that tastes great and is easy on the stomach. Among all of the usually massive abv imp. stout out there, Sam Smith's is a no nonsense, less alcoholic, easily drinkable stout that maintains everything a stout should be like."

"550ml bottle and I feel sorry for you poor bastards with the 355's. Dang it. It just looks the part. The bottle looks straight out of the Victorian era. It is oily coal black with a deep tan head that yields neither for man nor beast. Smells of fruit soaked in rum in a barrel. With a cocoa powder sprinkled on top. Yes, I filled a barrel with fruit, rum, and cocoa just to confirm that so you can believe me. Taste starts with prunes, then moves to a surpisingly mellow coffee/dark chocolate mix that melts to a pleasantly dry chalkiness. WOW! This is the subtlest stout I've ever had and it is just off the charts. Mouthfeel is soft if a bit undercarbonated but its English so it comes by it honestly. Drinkability is fantastic for a stout. Not bitter or over-roasted at all. Not what I expected, the style is not my favorite but this is just phenol-menal, if you'll forgive me. I bow to the altar of Samuel Smith's on this one."
"This brew is very good; smooth and very tasty. Very much a stellar Russian Imperial Stout."
"Drinkability is only hindered by the rather surprising smell and interesting taste, which is to say, not really very much. A solid example of an RIS. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst."
"Pours and nice black with a nice frothy creamy One inch head in a pint glass..Nice coffe chocolate aroma..Good mouthfeel and very drinkable...I would rate this right up there with Smiths oatmeal stout also..But it has a little more of a bite than the oatmeal stout. Good beer to go slow and take your time with and enjoy, be great with spicy food."
"Drinkability is very good. I believe this is the lowest abv of any of the RIS that I've had so I could see this a a possible session beer for the style. Maybe a few in one evening. Goes down very smooth and is quite enjoyable."
"This is a very good beer that I wish I could buy at home. Until then there is always Oatmeal Stout."
"This was great - one of those beers you drink and immediately want another bottle of, my favorite Samuel Smith's."
"cheers!"
"Classic big Sammy bottle into tulip glass. Pours a dark black with a half inch creamy head. This is a good looking beer. Smell of roasted malts, and hints of licorice, chocolate, and coffee. Taste follows suit... well balanced. Roasty, malty backbone with chocolate and coffee hints. Nothing coming through too strong. Finishes pretty dry. A little bit thin on the mouthfeel for a RIS, but very drinkable, and quite tasty. Great beer."
"Final word: try me."
"D: A great dessert drink, but one is enough."
"Great beer, but too bitter for more than a couple."
"- Overall this is a fantastic strong stout... but yet tastes like a standard American stout.... but better. Top of its class for sure, and one many need to try... and not so expensive! (Not affecting the judging)."
"Overall, I give this an A-. The look and bouquet are both excellent, but regarding the taste my verdict is out. Some of what I am tasting is almost a little stale, so I am not sure how old this version is. However, it's still pleasant, just nowhere near as intense as many American versions."
"D: This IS is very drinkable, top of the line"
"I could drink a few no problem, but would need a ride home"
"D- Very good. Being a lighter-than-most stout lends itself to more drinkability, so higher marks for sippability."
"Cheers."
"Pours a dark black, with a hint of ruby/brown at the edges. Thin tan head. Smell is of liquorice, and sweet malt. Taste is chocolaty and coffee up front, thick malt middle, and a roasted, earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Much lower alcohol than the average RIS, makes this easy to drink the entire 550ml bottle. An excellent example of a RIS, not as *extreme* as some US varieties, but still very tasty and holds its own."
"Drinkability: this is very drinkable. I will have no problem finishing this bottle, and at only 7%, it's downright sessionable for a Russian imperial stout. Kudos!"
"This is a cool beer. Not sure if it's my first choice among the imperial stouts.. more just like a British stout but still very good."
"Full bodied, very rich and smooth. Enjoyable RIS overall, great to sip on. I doubt I'd have more than one at a time, but I'm sure I'll try this again in the future."
"I love stouts, and this is certainly a front runner for my favorite."
"(Given the choice, I'd opt for the Taddy Porter instead)"
"overall a great brew..i remember drinking this when i first got into craft and i seem to have lost it in the shuffle somewhere...glad i sat down and enjoyed this tonight..."
"D - It took me about 50 min to finish (not that i had to take that long, but i wanted to take that long). It was delectable. I loved every second of my indulgence. It was smooth, well-rounded, and a big task, all at the same time. One of my favorite stouts tasted to date. My first RIS. lovin' the style... i will have many more in the future!"
"Great! IS is still my favorite style and this fits nicely into the lineup. A little too potent to drink a lot of but not as strong as others in the style."
"D - Moderate to high, even @ 7%."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: Meh, I could do it, but I don't think I would want to drink too much of this."
"drinkabilty drink it slow and savor the flavor. would drink this any day of the week. Try this Beer"
"Flavor is big and roasty. This beer emphasizes the unique character of a stout-- the roasted barley-- so much so that the flavor is smoky and peaty. Pretty fantastic if you ask me. Not overly sweet or boozy like so many other imperial stouts. Roastiness begets a dry tanginess. Mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as some other examples of the style. Could use a little more creaminess. At 7 percent, this imperial is probably the most drinkable I've had. Excellent stout."
"Overall: This is surely one of the best imperial stouts out there. If only this one would be a ""limited production"" or ""very rare", it would likely be voted in the top three at BA. This because many people seem to be biased by the hype of limited productions....Hail the czar of Russian imperial stouts! Highly recommendable!!"
"I could drink the entire four pack. An extremely enjoyable imperial stout that should be taken seriously."
"D - I would love to find a better imperial stout than Samuel Smith's but as of yet I have not and to be quite honest I don't know what more I could expect. Samuel Smith beers are know the world over and rightfully so. PLEASE TRY THIS BEER!!!"
"This beer pours a jet black non see thru colour with avid carbonation that leaves a nice frothy two finger cappicino laced head with really vivid lacing all down the sides an absolutely beautiful looking RIS,it has bittersweet aromas of rich roasted sweet chocolate and some strong bitter coffee,it has a full mouthfeel that is perfectly balanced out by the roasted choc malts and stiff strong bittersweet coffeish hop notes,definately an outstanding beer and so far the benchmark of this style for me."
"Pours a dark, nearly opaque brown with garnet hues around the edges against light. Massive, fluffy deep tan head with a light crimson hue. Aroma is complex balance of dark fruits and toffee/caramel malts. This almost smells like a red wine at first. Full bodied with light carbonation results in a very creamy, soft feel on the tongue. Flavors are similar to the aroma, body is initially fruity sweet, before the malt and chocolate flavors take over with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Malt and bitter fruitiness lingers long into the finish. I had purchased two bottles of this and drank one fresh. For some reason that night this seemed too overpowering for me, but tonight this tastes well balanced and very drinkable."
"mouthfeel is nice as far as thickness goes, but it is over-carbonated, and the aftertaste is too sweet on the palate."
"Overall a great IS.Def up there on my list for this style. Would def. buy again."
"I'm no patriot, but fuck bless the USA for making such awesome Imperial Stouts."
"Overall, a very refreshing imperial stout. I like English beers for the basic fact that the ABV is lower and makes the beer much more enjoyable. Very subtle and smooth"
"Pours opaque dark brown-to-black with a thick tan two-finger head, after an impressive brown reverse cascade. The smell is a hit of alcohol, with a dark-roasted grain mellowness and lots of dried fruit -- date, mostly. The taste is more rich dried fruit, with a taste like good African coffee smells but rarely delivers, passing into some lemon-rind astringency and a pleasant mineral, charcoal-smoke finish. It's mildly carbonated, very full-bodied, quite luxuriant. It's a tad boozy to gulp, but I do anyway. The quintessence of the style."
"this beer will not disapoint."
"Poured from big pint+ bottle into a wine glass (lesson: when packing your apartment, pack the pint glasses last, not first.) Pours an apparent black - when held up to the light, it's actually a very dark nut brown. Just a small amount of blown foam quickly recedes away, leaving no lace and just a bit of residual froth. The usual imperial stout scent is obvious from the bottle, and also from the glass - I'd put it at a little sweeter than most with a certain fruity character to the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy - I notice that even before the flavor, which is quite mild for the type. I taste nuts and maple syrup, with the alcohol becoming more assertive in the aftertaste. More carbonation than you can see in the small head. 7% ABV isn't extreme for the style, but given the smoothness this could be extraordinarily dangerous - I find myself going through this a lot faster than other imperial stouts. Quite good, in keeping with what Samuel Smith's usually puts out. Expect a much smoother ride than you get with a lot of imperial stouts, although I think there is a slight sacrifice in terms of the intensity and complexity of flavor."
"Never been blown away by this brewery, though I remain reverent. This might as well be considered an example of the original intent of a Russian Imperial Stout. I just like what American brewers have brought to the style, by a longshot."
"this was my first imperial stout, and one i'll always come back to. besides the great flavor, the price- at four bucks a bottle, combined with it's ubiquitous distribution make this a solid imperial no matter how you look at it."
"Pours opaque in body topped by off white head. Nuts, alcohol, chocolate cream in the nose. Creamy, subtle chocolate, slight mocha, tangy finish. Medium bodied and a bit watery on the palate. A fine example of English stouts and very drinkable. I feel like I've been transported to an dank English bar in the 19 century, nothing beats a beer that makes you feel out of the time."
"This beer is thin for a RIS. I expect a thick, chewy, bad ass brew but got the beer body of a brown ale. I think this one could use a little more time during the boil to condense the wort further and caramelize the sugars just a bit further. This is the thinnest RIS I've ever had but it is tasty. It could be a fuller body but still a nice beer that is easy to drink."
"Pours solid black with a leathery brown head. Smells strongly of dark roasted malt, chocolate, and maybe a little alcohol. Tastes incredibly strongly of those roasted flavors, but with enough hop characteristics to stand out a bit. Earthy hops, and a moderate bitterness. I guess if I had to choose between this and Old Rasputin or something like that I'd take the American version, but it's a close second."
"Overall a very nice beer. I have had it both on tap in London and out of a bottle in the US. Unlike many of its imported stout counterparts, it travels well."
"Between the wet paint milk sugars and the plaster brown sugars I though about Home Depot for the entire beer."
"As it warms, I get a strong semblance of boozy hot chocolate, which would make it, I imagine, a lovely après-whatever sipper, be it with dessert, or more robust cold weather activity. I'm sure the tsarina had experience with both, in spades."
"4.5 M&4.5 D: velvety smooth yet full-bodied for a 7%abv. Imperial Stout, without falling thick or hard on alc.; the softly carbonated body is ideal, which, along with a constant sour-fruitiness, keeps the thicker malty elements in check, so as to ensure a balanced palate. Slightly on the weak side for a preferably heavier roasted-malt input and also aromatic hoppy presence. But if one places this beer alongside Harvey's Imperial Russian Stout, there's an idea how a genuine English ""RIS"" might have tasted some hundred years ago... For me this Imperial Stout is utterly easy-drinking in this category--really worth seeking out this one! (Yet I still don't get why SS can't make it bottle-conditioned?)"
"Very smooth mouthfeel. Good beer, that goes down easy."
"D - Very nice high test stout. Definitely would drink again."
"Like the Bros say, ""All hail to the King"". Pours an opaque black color with thin, light brown head that remains through the tasting and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and alcohol. The taste profile contains much of the same. Less body and a less noticeable alcohol presence than other most RIS. Very approachable, should be the benchmark to which all others are compared."
"A well made imp stout that is easy to drink, complex yet not overpowering. Nice tasty beer!"
"I thought this was a solid beer that seems almost categorically mismatched in this day and age of microbrews by the shelfload. Nevertheless, I've never had a bad beer from Samuel Smith and it's nice to enjoy something as timless as this. Those looking for an RIS that will knock them into next week will be disappointed but for true beer connoisseurs, this is a pleasant surprise and a joy to drink. It's easy to see why this has been brewed for as long as it has."
"D. Overall a very enjoyable stout. I would rate this second only to Stone Russian Imperial. This is a very available stout year round."
"D: Close to a regular stout at this ABV, but the flavor and mouthfeel are essentially style-defining. A classic beer, and one of the better stouts available nationwide. Craft brewers have made imperial stouts that are incredibly complex now, but this one is still a pillar of the style. A great starter imperial stout and a widely available and relatively inexpensive beer to revisit whenever the mood strikes."
"incredible mouthfeel for an imp stout. very drinkable for its style. probably the most drinkable one i've had."
"At 7% this is a milder RIS than I've become accustomed to but it really doesn't give anything up other than mouthfeel. Rich, delicious and very easy to drink."
"The taste is similarly strong and rich, yet smooth. The alcohol is clearly present, but not harsh, simply giving a noticeabler alcoholic warmth and bite which somewhat balances the sweetness, along with a light bitterness. The taste has chocolate, earth, leaves, stewed caramellised prunes and other fruit, along with spices and a faint coffee element in the finish. It has a light smokiness without actually tasting burnt. Though very strong and rich, its elements are smooth, restrained and balanced for an imperial stout."
"Overall, a good Imperial Stout with some complexity to the brew. the flavor is not overpowering and makes it ideal for starting a night of drinking."
"Drinkability: its smooth and a great treat but probably a bit too intense to drink quickly. Not something that I could personally drink all day, but would make after meal treat. Overall a wonderful experience and great imperial stout."
"D - this was the first imperial stout I tried and still has a special place in my heart; while I personally don't prefer this beer to SS Oatmeal Stout, it is a wonderful offering in the style and definitely worth your time"
"Pours black with a thick, dense beige head. Sweet coffee, roasted chocolate aromas. There were hop aromas way in the background. Molasses and sweet coffee flavors up front with a dark chocolate flavor and bitterness in the finish. The finish also reveals a slight tangy flavor. Great creamy smooth mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. As it warmed up a little, the alcohol flavors and aromas became more apparent."
"D - For the ABV and style this is quite drinkable. It is a very good beer and it would be more drinkable if it went down slightly more smoothly but the mouthfeel issue is making it hard to see lots of this going down. Otherwise and impressive and drinkable brew."
"d: very good, you could drink more than one for a big beer."
"Very drinkable. Really sneaky when at colder temperatures, making it dangerously quaffable. Somewhat expensive, but not too bad compared to many imperial stouts. This is a classic beer worthy of it's reputation. Would love to try a really fresh one another time."
"D- I could really pound this beer back because you cant feel the abv. Its smooth and silky creamy as well which makes it go down the throat easily."
"Drinkability: This really filled me up. I understand that this is not a session type of brew but after just one I didn't want anymore (different compared to Brooklyn's Chocolate Stout, and Stone's Imperial Russian Stout)."
"Beer poured into a Guinness imperial pint glass and forms a 3 cm beige head with some spotty lacing. Smell is quite intoxicating with strong scents of caramel, cocoa, molasses, and biscuits. Taste is so smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Caramel flavors and malts dominate the sweet tasting brew but enough hops are present to balance the beer in a sublime way. The finish has a touch of alcohol accompanied by a bit a of malts and hops fracas. Dark chocolate notes in the background as well. I could barely put this beer down and forced myself to do so only in order to examine the lingering finish. I can't wait to stock up on this one. Well done SS!"
"Notes: Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is definitely a classic beer, and it's hard to fault something that's been winning gold medals since 1896 and that comes from as respected a brewery as Samuel Smith's. Unfortunately, however, I must do exactly that, and in my opinion this beer is no where near the level of Stone's IRS, North Coast's Old Rasputin, Founder's RIS, or countless other Russian Imperial Stouts. For a category of beer that is absolutely bursting forth with quality, Samuel Smith's version just isn't quite what I'm looking for. Judging by the other ratings for this beer it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but it's more likely that this beer just isn't quite up to snuff. I'll be buying this beer again to see if this was just a bad bottle, so look for possible changes coming up."
"It took a while for me to remember what this reminded me of, then it hit me, SA Triple Bock, my lowest score on BA. Maple just doesn't belong in beer, I feel."
"While that won't mean anything to most folks, it's high praise where I'm from."
"Very thick and cream, with some alcholic heat."
"I'm really impressed with this beer. I am a big fan of stouts, but this is my first ever Russian Imperial Stout and I tried the Samuel Smith based on what reviews I had read from BA. Definitely a good choice and I will seek out this beer any time I get the chance."
"probably won't be buying any more but was fun to experience."
"Drinkability - An excellent beer. Very drinkable, I like this a lot."
"Bottle sample- pours jet black with frothy tan head. Nose- dark fruit and chocolate. Taste- very fruity, plums, raisins, chocolate and slight alcohol taste. Medium to low carbonation. Finish is bitter chocolate, maybe a touch of hops, but not much. Mostly a roast free, fruit forward stout. I prefer less fruity notes, so drinkability suffers somewhat. Quite light bodied for style."
"Drinkability- Good for an imperial stout. Alcohol isn't overwhelming."
"D - I think its creamy smooth mouthfeel compliments the rich, fuller bodied aspect of this beer but after one I think I'd make it switch to something lighter."
"Drinkability: A very subtle RIS. A very good example of the style, which hides the alcohol well. I would drink several of these if not for the high ABV. I will have this again."
"D- Any more than a couple of these might overwhelm my taste, but I could see having a few, very interesting and nice alcohol note, reminds me of the warming character of a nice scotch, deep, toasty, and very good."
"Extremely drinkable, despite the darkness. Just creamy, rich, sweet, and slick. A superbly balanced and extremely well made brew. This beer cements Samuel Smith's reputation for me."
"Overall this is a nice, drinkable drop, but it doesn't command too much of my respect."
"the mouthfeel was medium to heavy bodied. medium carbonation. it seems a little light for the style, but it is still full of all the RIS taste. this and the somewhat low ABV makes the drinkability awesome. i definately recommend this to anyone, but definately to someone wanting to get into big stouts without the alcohol."
"D: Don't think I am going to hop on board with this one. It is good, but not good enough to get a sixer."
"M&D- Sticky, light and refreshing"
"D: Flavorful but second tier due to the lack of depth of flavor and thinner than expected body and feel."
"Bottle. Pours a dark black with a hint of red. Nice, tall, dark tan head. Big caramel and coffee aromas. Smells sweet. Mild, fine carbonation. Some fig, roasted malt, caramel, a touch of alcohol, and a hint of chocolate on the palate. Nice bitterness and a rich mouthfeel. Finishes very clean. This is a really good stout but not as big as some you might see these days. That being said, I would actually have more than one of these!"
"the appearence is great. It poured with a big, sustained head. The bubbles were very fine and it is an attractive looking beer in my lion chalice. It smells very good too, smells like a ton of sweet, rich flavors. It smells very sweet, like caramel or toffee, or even a sweet chocolate. The taste is very clean and smooth. It tastes like it smells: very sweet. Again, a little bit of chocolate, and some sweet, caramel like malts. Not very dry or hoppy like some of the bigger imperials I have had recently, but more juicy and sweet. Definately a good offering from samuel smiths, which I never try, even though I see it all the time. (I might start after this one.)the mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, I'm not used to such a smooth and drinkable imperial stout. I would reccommend this stout to those that have a problem with this type of beer. It is sweet, malty, and very drinkable for a stout, let alone an imperial."
"A 7% Imperial Stout. Alcohol was so far in the background that I did not even consider it until I got to this point in the review. Nothing hard about drinking this one. It has probably been 15+ years since I've had this, and wow have I been missing out on this year-round treat. Bought the 12 oz and it was just right. If you haven't had this one, and are a stout lover (all types), you need to give this one a try. Great balance, structure, and complexity."
"Cheers"
"I love stouts, and imperial stouts are one of my favorite types of stouts. I've been meaning to pick this beer up for quite some time now and was excited to try it. Poured into a pint glass it pours a black opaque color with a tanish colored head, looks great! The aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, a little bit of coffee? Either way the smell is wonderful, though the taste is quite better. With a somewhat thick and creamy mouthfeel with a taste of coffee and chocolate that is pretty sweet it's a great tasting beer. Easily drinkable. There are some imperial stouts I could only drink a few of in one night but this one I could easily do more of no problem. Not a high alcohol content and a great taste this is one I will be picking up again for sure."
"D: One of the best stouts I've had. A pretty toned-down version of an RIS, but still an absolutely brilliant take. I can't wait to grab another of these!"
"Overall, this might be the most drinkable RIS I've tated."
"Very drinkable, pleasant, tasty experience for sure."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could definitely find myself enjoying more that a few of these. Probably 3-4 even, I love how robust and full flavored this beer is, although I admit that I do enjoy other stouts more. This is a great example of a stout, I think I would have appreciated more of a creamy, thick body. Still very good, I recommend you give this a try. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is ridiculous, I just can't believe how good this beer is right now. This is truly one of the best out there, so much flavor for being only 7%, it's really all you need. I should say I don't like RIS's overly roasty, bitter or hoppy, so if you do, this may not work for you. But if you're a fan of the sweeter strong ales on the other side of the pond, quit tripping over yourselves for the next big thing and go back to the roots, Samuel Smith's knows what it's all about."
"D: Sam Smith deserves props for helping to revive the style and providing a template for other brewers to build on. But nowadays, it comes across like a retro video game; it's great nostalgic fun for those who were there at the time, but for younger enthusiasts, it's kind of hard to see what the fuss was all about. It's still worth a try, if only as a historical artifact. But I can't recommend it as an exemplar of the style. Honestly, it's not even the best beer in the Sam Smith portfolio."
"D: Given the low ABV for the style, this is quite a bit more drinkable than is typical. The is one of the first imperial stouts I've had where I could imagine having a couple throughout an evening."
"D: Very drinkable, it seems to be at a lower ABV than many RIS's that I see. Great beer, and I will purchase again."
"Another winner by sam smith."
"D: This is probably the easiest drinking Imperial Stout I've ever had. While still not a session brew, this beer's comparatively low alcohol makes it a possibility to have more than one or two."
"One thing I love about this stout is that the alcohol isn't so assertive. Some Russian Imperial Stouts, Stone's in particular, scared me off by being overly boozy. All in all, this a phenomenal stout."
"Pretty good beer! I'm impressed."
"D-Fine enough, but not really a great brew. I think the flavor profile was relatively thin, with a body that left me wanting."
"Overall a slight disappointment, considering I love Sam Smith and Imperial Stouts. I was hoping for a bigger Taddy Porter, but I miss the roasted malts that make it so delicious. Overall good, but not my go-to RIS."
"Notes: 355 ml bottle poured into a Imperial Pint Glass. BBE DEC 09."
"Solid appearance, nice complexity in the nose. Flavor is a bit more simple than the nose lets on, but very well balanced and full. Nice, albeit heavy, feel. This is a high quality quaff."
"drinkability is great, and to add to that it's a RIS that won't knock you on your ass at 7%. this seems like the ""big brother"" to their oatmeal stout. a little bigger, a little richer, and a little darker. it's really that beer turned up a notch, and i think it benefits from it - more depth, a little more intensity. just better all around. while i'm just as gaga over the latest big american stout, i'd be very happy to have a steady supply of this excellent english offering. a great stout that i will certainly not be waiting long to pick up more of."
"Delicious. Perfect dessert beer."
"Brilliant beer."
"This beer goes down pretty quick (atleast in my case) for an RIS, but isn't to strong and is pretty smooth so its really no wonder why. Grab a few bottles if you see some."
"Pours an inky black color, big foamy tan head. Dry chocolately aroma, some sugars and malty aromas. Not much coffee aroma. Not heavy body, watery almost mouthfeel. Some coffee aftertaste, not much chocolate taste. Almost skunky taste. A good stout."
"Taste is very smooth with a little bit of roasted malt. There a hint of the same sweet fruit in the taste. Mouthfeel is very creamy and wonders through the mouth nicely. Highly drinkable beer going down as smooth as it does."
"Pours a thick black color with a thin tan head that fades. Smells of roasted malts, some chocolate. Tastes decent, a typical stout. Roasted malts with a faint chocolate background. Not the best mouthfeel but nothing to complain about, smooth. Drinkability is ok, as it got warmer it became harder to put down."
"D - this wasn't a bad RIS, but it lacked the beefiness that I'm used to with an RIS."
"English take on the RIS. Black pour, nice light brown head. More chocolately than coffee, nice amount of carbonation. Flavor similar, quite sweet with molasses, malt and chocolate. Not as astringent as some imperial stouts. Balanced, full bodied yet very drinkable. An excellent stout that is not too tough to find."
"D: If persuaded to, I could drink another pint of this. It isn't bad by any means, but its more of a one and done type of beer. An excellent glimpse into the past of the Imperial Stout. Not a bad beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone that was curious."
"J"
"D: This is an incredibly refined stout. There are no rough edges on this one, as all of the flavors balance perfectly against one another. Despite the beer's strength, the alcohol is almost completely hidden by the complex flavors. Definitely worth a revisit down the road."
"A dark black color pour with a finger of light tan head that hung around for quite a while.Aroma of chocolate,burnt barly,and some earthy,musty,maybe slightly oxidized but still a good aroma. Flavor of cask wood,charcoal,licorice,tobacco,and a touch of alcohol.Full body,with a somewhat oily texture,and a suprise bitter finish. A pretty darn good stout,fun to try,and quite drinkable."
"Poured black as night with small off-white head. The nose smelled of dark burnt chocolate. The mouthfeel was incredible, very chewy and delicious. Lots of coffee/chocolate in the taste. This is the first stout I really like. Excellent."
"D-I am becoming a big fan of this style of beer,and this is the lightest bodied one I have tried so far it is still very tasty and still worth checking out."
"Well this beer tastes great and doesn't punch overly hard. That said the flavor wasn't quite as big as I'd hoped for. What can I say? I like it a lot. It's very pleasant and doesn't try to bomb you as hard as possible as a lot of impy stouts do. Very enjoyable."
"pretty good drinkability!"
"Good."
"Samuel Smith's Russian Imperial is a classic, no doubt. Very solid beer all around (with the small exception of it's anorexic body). However, this is a style that has really been improved with pushing the envelope a little. This one does not quite measure up in that regard. Nonetheless, it is a legend that every BA needs to try."
"Decently full mouthfeel, quite viscous and oily. Acidic finish, leaves it a little dry. Good drinking for style, but still a little work to do."
"MF&D - not much carbonation, and is not as thick/syrupy as expected. A most enjoyable drink."
"Ordered at bottle at the Washington Sq Tavern this past weekend for $6. Poured into a glass. Very dark black color. Slight brownish white head. Some lacing. Smell was a bit lacking. Taste was what I expected from a British RIS. Lots of roasted barley. Slight coffee overtones. The problem with this beer is that I have always found Sam Smith beers to be a bit in the thin side, and this does not help a RIS. Tasty beer, easy to drink, but a bit watery for a stout. Might be worth picking up for $3-4 in a beer store, but for $6 in a pub, not quite worth it."
"Drinks well, easy and smooth, perfect serving size bottle as an imperial pint, more would be overdoing it. One to keep around for sure, not overpoweringly good, but nice."
"to me, Guinness has always had a bit of a lingering bitterness about it. THIS, does not. I would gladly take SSIS over Guinness any day."
"Poured a twelve ounce bottle into my Samuel Smith's pint glass. It is very black with a nice two inch tan head. The nose is nothing overpowering, but it smells like chocolate and espresso. It tastes of rich dark chocolate and some espresso notes. There is also a touch of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is amazing. It is thick, rich, and creamy almost like a milkshake. This has a very high drinkability and it is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout to date. Simply an amazing beer."
"D: I am very impressed with this beer, it feels like Cognac in your mouth ( I meant it as a compliment). This Imperial Stout is very drinkable, and again, I think it could suit a lot of paladates. Balance!"
"This was my first foray into Russian Imperial Stouts, and I enjoyed it immensely."
"D: Could have a couple of these, alcohol is definitely present."
"Ok drinkability."
"Good quality beer. Carbonation held it back from being a great beer. Not too bitter, not too heavy, great price. More drinkable than alot of RIS. Would buy again"
"D-the flavors are not countered by anything and make this, in my opinion, an unbalanced beer. if i were talking to sam smith, i would tell him to bump up the ABV to take some focus from the coffee chocolate. im not gonna run to the store for this anytime soon"
"Black, BLACK its freaking dark. Maybe a little red/brown at the bottom of the glass. This thing smells like malt and sugar and over ripe fruit. Taste fooking GREAT. I really like this beer, and after walking home in the windy -4F weather this is exactly what I needed. Its smooth and thick, looks a bit like motor oil. Taste sweet and the carbonation is perfect. Smooth and wonderful, creamy. I cant say enough good stuff about this beer, Ive had a few tonight and I wish I would have started with this so I could enjoy it more, but its still GREAT."
"The drinkability really takes a hit from the metallic smell. It is a good beer, and at 7% would almost be sessionable for the stout lover, but I didn't enjoy the bottle enough to want another. If I see it somewhere and I know it is fresh I will probably give it another try. I may have gotten a bad bottle or just one that was past its time, but without a freshness date it is hard to say."
"OVERALL: A good RIS for sure, but nothing spectacular and a little too boozy for 7%. I've had others in the style that I've enjoyed more, and I find this to be a slight disappointment considering how good their Oatmeal Stout and Porter are."
"(rated Jul 8, 2008)"
"A thin, somewhat disappointing Russian Imperial Stout with a flavor profile that is not bad but merely average for the category. I was really expecting more from Samuel Smith with this one. The Taddy Porter knocked my socks off and their other beers are generally, at least, excellent values. This offering is basically RIS light. It lacks the depth and complexity of flavor that is nearly commonplace amongst its competition. The feel is somewhat watery and really fails to bring the required breadth. That said, it's not bad, at all. This beer's rating is very much a product of its place relative to some truly great competition, and with Old Rasputin sharing its shelf space, it's not even a very good value in this neck of the woods (I imagine other areas have better Imp Stouts and RIS's as well). At any rate, the beer pours opaquely black with good lacing from a nice beige-mocha head. There are notes of toasted malt and English, minerally hops. The flavors just aren't big and strong enough. Also, while I usually like a thick, viscous feel on my Imperial Stouts, this one manages it while still being too watery, which turns out to be not altogether pleasant. Not a bad beer but far below the heights of the style."
"A easy drinking Russian Imperial as far as I'm concerned."
"I have always been disappointed with beer from Samuel Smith, so I was reluctant to try this one. However, when I realized the bottle was clear, and the dark brown was the beer, I was intrigued. Aroma is tobacco and roasted chocolate malts. The taste is very, very good. Understated for an Imperial, this is dominated by roasted malts, with a solid backing of bittersweet chocolate and light coffee. Ended sweet. If only the rest of Samuel Smith's beers could be this good."
"A very impressive brew, great to sip from in the evening."
"The bottom line is this beer is damn good."
"D - I honestly cant say I would have more than one, and I would not buy this again. The alcohol flavor was just to upfront, and as strong as the chocolate was, it was not enough. I guess I must like the 5-6 ABV range, this just took something away from the beer for me. I did let it warm for a time before opening."
"Smells of sweet alcoholic coffee. Pours deep black with a huge, thick, foamy brown head. WOW, lots of dark fruitiness for a stout, not just a toasted pitch black beer. Along with a sweet caramel and a bit of chocolate, each sip is a blast of prune, dark grape, plum. All malt. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Superb, I'll be drinking this again- love the fruity notes in here. The only thing bad I have to say is that it could have used a higher ABV."
"Drinkability: Still a fine, decent RIS, even with those dirty nickels. But, if I had my druthers, I'd reach for a Taddy Porter instead."
"D: Ehh."
"taste is thick and creamy, dark and milk chocolate, espresso, touch of vanilla, touch of licorice, and some roasted nuts, a bit tangy in the end, with an aftertaste that is dry, slightly bitter, and chocolaty."
"Drinkability is pretty good for the style, but the Oatmeal Stout is Sam Smith's greatest accomplishment. There are fresher American brewed Russian Imperials that I would take over this one."
"Medium bodied and actually rather light for an Imperial Stout. The malts overwhelm, and the lack of hops creates a sour rather than bitter taste. The yeast and malts make this taste of sourdough bread. There is a slight taste of chocolate on the back end that helps clear out the taste of dough. A change of pace as far as stouts go, and not altogether bad. However, I felt like it was missing something, whether its that extra kick of alcohol, or some hops, but I was left with a feeling like this was a very good beer that was missing something that would make it great."
"A delicious, very creamy stout. Provides a great finish and a great aftertaste. Very, very drinkable. Has a great balance between bitter and sweet."
"Overall the beer has a smooth mouth feel and very drinkable. one of my favorite Imperial Stouts."
"D_Low ABV contributes to good drinkability, however this beer is very filling, not that you can blame it. The bitter taste is very enjoyable but prohibitive"
"On a critical note, I was less than impressed with the aftertaste. Inorganic, for lack of a better word."
"This pours into the pint glass a pretty black brown color with a fuzzy medium light brown head and solid lacing throughout. The aroma is a mild charcoal coffee blend, fairly bitter on the coffee side. The first taste brings out a sweet orange overtone on the charcoal base. Very nice on the taste buds. I pick up some gin-like qualities in the mild alcohol presence. As it warms I pick up more of a chocolate malt in the sweetness. It's quite drinkable for this style, midland body feel. Boy this goes good with cheese and hot pepper rings. I don't know that much more description is necessary, it's very solid, and not exactly like every other stout out there. This is consistent with the other Sam Smith mainstays I have enjoyed, a pleasure to drink on most any occasion."
"Mouthfeel is full, but a little light."
"D - Heavy beer, but a strong Stout that can be enjoyed many again and again"
"Pours a great dark color with nice tan head (that rapidly diminishes) and almost no lacing. Excellent scent, very deep and dark with a great burnt grain and coffee aroma. Wonderful flavor, exceedingly dark and deep, wonderful coffee and chocolate flavors with a great coffee burst finish, and it as a nice slight bourbon barrel/alcohol tinge that is slightly warming. It goes down very smoothly for such a slightly higher gravity beer. This is one of my new favorite stouts."
"The beer pours a thick ruby black color almost impenetrable to light. The beer has a luscious creamy brown head that laces and retains. The nose on this beer is just maximally complex. Chocolates, coffee, mocha, caramel, molasses, sweet malts, and brown sugar. The taste is even more complicated. There are waves of flavor coming over the palate. There is a strong mocha, cocoa chocolatey flavor first. There are liqueur flavors popping through, lots of warming alchol, raisin and raspberry in the deep recesses. There are sweet malts, caramels, molasses flavors, and some spices. The mouthfeel is very creamy but subtantial. The aftertaste has warming alcohol notes, and leaves a dark cherry chocolate residue. There is just a touch more ABV in the finish than I would have perferred. But, this beer is truly amazing. Its complexity is a pleasure to experience, and I may never speak ill of a RIS again. L'Chaim."
"Give me a Surly, Bells, Schells, Summit, Left Hand, or Sierra Nevada any day."
"I can tell where the style came from, but I also now know that I prefer our over the top American RIS offerings."
"Pours a dark black color with a thick coffee-colored head. Aroma of malty chocolate, roasted coffee and toast. Flavor is similar to aroma with lots of roasted chocolate maltiness, caramel, coffe, toffe and oatmeal. A bit watered down though with a dry finish."
"This has to be the most balanced stout that I've ever tasted. The bitterness is bold, and enjoyable, and lasts long on the finish, but it does not overpower the palate. It is very easy drinking, almost sessionable. The alcohol is evident and warming, but not prominent. This beer could really sneak up on you and lay you out."
"opaque without much head. becomes just ring of lighter chocolate around glass. smell is grape sour, american porter like, earth apple malt. taste is smoked. grape, apple, leather, light sour, tobacco. a light hop with clay like quality. onion and chalk. some say its soy sauce. not metallic whatsoever. wonderful and quite easy to find. a must have for to get a ""truer"" english take."
"The appearance is a dark brown with a bit of an amber hue. The smell is reminiscent of a mixture between a bitter and a irish dry stout, but the taste and mouthfeel point to the dryness of the stout as the dominant characteristic of the beer. The dryness also keys into the light chocolate overtones, with a light nuttyness and an even less noticeable 7% ABV. The subtlety of the characteristics of this beer prompts the question - must a beer with a stronger ABV render the alcohol a prominent taste component of the beer? I would argue that this is not necessarily so. If you agree, feel free to give sam smith's imperial stout a try."
"A gold-standard for the style certainly."
"Pretty costy, but still would drink this again"
"It's also worth noting that this beer is generally a bit cheaper than the other members of this style, which is always a plus."
"Well done by a top-notch brewery!."
"d: This was probably my first RIS back in the day and what a fine RIS it is. Oatmeal stout may get the fame and fortune, but I think this is my favorite Sammy Smith beer. It is rich and delicious, yet still easy drinking, light bodied and dangerously inviting."
"A Samuel Smith's classic and really earns the name of this exceptional brewery. Deep black brown in the glass with a light brown head that foamed quickly and then settled to lace the glass throughout. Rich roasted malt in the nose and in the initial taste, with a rich nutty taste and somewhat unique (and welcome) hint of bitterness (hops?) in the aftertaste that helps drinkability. The slightly higher ABV renders the beer somewhat less drinkable than others, but the whole glass went down smoothly with no perceptible alcohol taste. Really well done."
"Nice dark pour with a roasted aroma. Not as full bodied as I had thought it would be however very drinkable. The bottle I poured had been sitting in my fridge for about a month or so; not sure if this affected the flavor as this is the only one I have ever had."
"Very good for a RIS, I will be having this many more times."
"D: This is a costlier beer, but I'd drink several if I could, and I hope to get some more on occasion. Its ABV is not overwhelming, and it's definitely flavorful."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth cream with just the right amount of carbonation. Do yourself a favour and grab this one if you see it in the stores."
"Ifinately more drinkable then most American RIS with their high ABVs, heavy bodies, and boozy qualities."
"Not too strong abv, but my dislike of coffee keeps it from being any higher."
"A thick syrupy mouthfeel, overall very good stout."
"Many of the great Imperial Stouts are considered such because of their heavy, rich and decadent profiles. Although robust, the Sam Smith is certainly far more modest than has become commonplace with the style. Still, it is a classic rendition of a more traditional, old-world example and should appreciated as such (...which is a very easy thing to do!)"
"I nice addition to the LCBO line-up. It would be nice if this one stuck around for a bit."
"There are better RIS out there."
"D: Hides the alcohol well. It's wonderful to sip on a cold, wet day."
"D: Initially, I felt like the flavor could be have been bolder and hold longer. It felt a little weak at times. I also felt like the aftertaste could be less acidic. Having said that, as the drink progressed, both points were lessened because the beer settled and felt like a good, well balanced brew. It isn't a show-off - it's quite understated, It doesn't blow my mind but I would recommend it."
"D: One of the first craft beers that I've had that I might make a constant in the collection. Great for a treat at night to unwind but without an overpowering ABV. Sweet and thick enough that it's great after a light dinner."
"This has vaulted into my favourite imperial stouts, in part because there seems to be a lot that isn't imperial about it. The ABV is far more restrained and makes it easy to drink at the pace of a regular beer, while the alcohol heat is also lacking. The flavours are also in a delightfully harmony, and its far less aggressive and boozy than other examples. I'd almost consider this a regular stout, but the label says otherwise."
"D: Drinkability was great. A cant miss beer and you cant go wrong here that comes highly recommended."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent. Thankful to have purchased a 4 pack instead of a single."
"i cant wait to get more! this is a must buy!"
"D - This would be dynamite with any variety of stews, ribs, and meat pie. Yum."
"Poured a mocha head that disspitated rather quickly and a dark brown almost black color. The smell was of mocha latte, chocolate with toffee notes. The alchohol was also present in the smell. The taste was of espresso and of sweet malt followed by a little bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth with some carbonation and some lacing. Definitly very drinkable and would recommend this RIS to everybody to try."
"This is probably my favorite example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"A masterful brew that you can savour once in a while, and somewhat of a desert beer."
"I know others have said it before, but this beer is just incredibly tasty without trying to knock you over the head with alcohol and various flavors. Definitely not the most complex in style, but it's the most enjoyable RIS I've had so far. I continued to be impressed by Samuel Smith's!"
"Nice, big stout that is so easy to drink. This is big in flavor and did I mention it's incredibly smooth?"
"Drinkability: This is not your typical American RIS, nor should it be I suppose. The abv% is wonderfully low for the style, making this one far more drinkable than many of its American cousins, too. Regardless, it's very nice to find a flavorful, drinkable, light, and fruity RIS, and the price was definitely right on this one - 550 mL for $3.99 is one you can't really beat."
"Drinkability - yes, but in a nice slow, sit by the fire kind of way. Just as the weather is turning cooler, this beer has a nice warming feel and seems just right."
"This beer poured a dark almost inky black with a single-finger tan head and a ton of lacing. The scent is fruity with some prunes and maybe raisins with some hints of milk chocolate and coffee. This beer is a goddamn knockout in the taste department. It starts off with some roasted chocolately sweet malts that cut by some slight coffee bitterness that hits at about the same time as some slightly-floral hops. Towards the end there is some prune and almost rum flavor that gives way to some smokiness in the end that almost reminds me of smoking a cigar. A very complex and enjoyable brew. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and almost creamy, with enough carbonation to keep it light. This beer is more drinkable than most porters, probably due to keeping the alcohol content down a little bit. A fantastic beer, that is at the top of many people's lists for good reason."
"Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Deep ebony pour, with a spongy head that fades too quickly. No lacing. A lively aroma that jumps right out at you. Rich molasses, dark chocolate, dark fruits, maybe even some licorice. Unbelievably tasty. Chewy roasted malt goodness that encompasses dark fruit, molasses and coffee in its complexity. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and possibly too thin for this Imperial. But then again, the abv is only 7% so there is really nothing to hide. Overall, very smooth. The taste and the low abv make this the most drinkable RIS I've found yet."
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured just shy of black with zero light penetration. Half inch khaki-colored cap comprised of tight tiny bubbles. Head lost half its volume in under a minute before settling into a thin, soapy skim. No lacing on this one. Nose is molasses, brown sugar and dark fruit. Cocoa character dominates the taste, followed by toffee; however, sweetness revealed in the nose is cut slightly and dark fruit is present closer to the finish. Body does not quite approach medium. Carbonation is minimal and no alcohol heat detected. Balanced flavor and body makes this an easy drinking goto RIS."
"D/MF: The body is full, rich, thick, and silky. The aftertaste is one of sweet malts and dark fruit. Leaves the mouth a little sticky, but that can be expected from a beer of this stature."
"Entertaining Victorian-style label proclaims Samuel Smith's to be ""Contractors to Her Majesty's Forcces"" - very appropriate for an IMPERIAL stout! Pours a deep, dark brown - bordering on black - with two fingers of chocolately brown head. Scent of sweet coffee and roasted barley greets the nose as you lift the glass for the first sip. Taste is first of coffee and dark chocolate, with hops in the background. Hop flavor becomes somewhat more pronounced later in the taste before giving over to a finish of sweet cream. Alcohol is rather light for an imperial stout, and flavors are perhaps less pronounced than in other examples of the style. However, the end result is a serious stout with interesting and enjoyable complexities that complement one another instead of battling to dominate your palate. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a virtually opaque espresso brown with a textbook mocha colored head. Nose of roasted cocoa beans, vanillin, egg yolk, custard and English toffee predominate. Velvety smooth in the mouth, with massive flavors of bittersweet dark chocolate, along with generous hop bittering keep things in check here from the rich malting and generous flavors. Mid-weight in texture, this brew has a wonderful presence in the mouth; is well balanced and highly drinkable. This is a slightly more tame Imperial for the rest of us."
"D: It was a nice RIS but a bit flat and dry compared to others. The low ABV and medium body, however, makes this more of a candidate for multiple drinks in a single session then others in this style."
"D: High ratings and easy as hell to drink. For the style, one you can have a few of and not feel completely grogged out. Not bad and worth the effot."
"D- Easy to drink, not too happy with the overly burnt taste though."
"Samual Smith's Imperial Stout pours a dense opaque black with a short stiff tan head. The smell is good and moderately strong of sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is absolutely fantastic from the get go. It's very robust of chocolate and malt. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a moderate abount of tightly wound carbonation. This tighness gives the liquid an ultimate dense like feel. Drinkability is great from the start and finishes progressively smoother lightening up a bit from its initial density. Overall a this is a great imperial stout, great buy for the price and taste. A real winner of a brew from Samual Smith's."
"Drinkability: Kind of a weird flavor, but not necessarily bad. Not hard to drink at all, but this one had kind of a novelty feel to it. Will probably try again in the future."
"Overall this is a great deal. It's not as robust as other RIS's - it's all about the subtlety, but everything works perfectly together. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Well constructed, I would like to enjoy this brew any time"
"D- very interesting beer thats easy to drink. other than the thin mouthfeel, this is a great beer. very possible to have a couple of the 550ml bottles in a sitting."
"There's an immediate, sharp carbonation bite on the tongue, accented by fruity late-hops and big almost belgian esters. The next think you notice is the creamy chocolatey-smooth texture and the usual (but subdued) accompaniment of roasted grain flavours, and a nice grainy bitterness without any astringency. You'll notice lots of fruit notes; cherry, apple, etc. It finishes with dark grainy bitterness and hops, with a slight alcohol warmth. This is an absolutely stunning stout. I'll buy more of these."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Flavor is fine, and alcohol is easily manageable. It's a good beer but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable brew, but ought to be respected, delicious. A classic."
"OK, I know in my 2nd and last review of a S.S. brew I formally said goodbye due to overpriced let-downs but.... a) I scored this for $2.69, b) I grabbed it within the first week it hit the shelves, and c) I love stouts. So with that being said this is a solid stout although my rating is likely lower than my overall enjoyment of this beer but I have to put it up against other Imperials. Aroma is enjoyable, very roasty and bitter. Good dark pour with an easily attainable head with little to no lacing. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and the finish is smoooth, but it's rather thin for an Impy. Impressive taste, roasted malts-a-plenty, some light coffee and chocolate. Easy to drink for an Impy and the alcohol makes a quick appearance. Overall a solid stout."
"Black color, moderate brown head and some lacing. Alcohol obvious in the aroma with some roasted malt. Sharp, tart, alcoholic mouthfeel with some roasted malt and chocolate flavors. Dark chocolate aftertaste which was pretty nice. The more I drink it the better it gets, but in all honesty that just could be the alcohol doing it's job."
"D- Good beer, but with its similarity to the oatmeal stout, think Id rather drink that and be able to have a few"
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured black with a thick tan head. The smell was of alcohol and roasted malts. I also picked up a hint of coffe in the scent. The taste was more coffee, with a hint of roasted malt coming through in the after taste. The mouthfeel is heavy with a touch of carbination. This is a very enjoyable beer, and is widely available. I would recomend this to anyone who is a fan of the RIS style."
"Sorry, don't know what else to say. I bought this because it was on the BA Top 100 and I expected more. It's not bad by any means but I expected KaPow! This is the same week that I had Stone IRS and Speedway Stout for the first time so maybe I have the bar set too high for this little guy. Even as such, this is still a solid brew and Sammy Smith continues to make quality products (only let me down once - India Ale)."
"Pitch black colored stout with a creamy head that fades to about a half an inch.Aroma is a mix of cocoa and coffee.Taste is chocolate,coffee and alcohol.I personally think this is a much better brew than their nut brown ale.I would buy again and recommend to my buddies."
"Drinkability: This has to be one of or the very first Russian Imperial Stouts made available. Unless I'm mistaken and those award on the label from 1896 do not belong to this beer. If you like your R.I.S., then you should try one of the first ones made available."
"Out of the bottle this is the darkest beer I have yet seen. Even up to sunlight you cannot see through it! Nice aroma like molasses with earthy notes. Not much head and it faded quickly. Great mouthfeel, full body and medium/light carbonation. Flavor is more robust and less sweet than the smell. Coffee, nearly burnt malt (heavily toasted) with a slightly bitter finish. This is totally varietly appropriate and as hearty and packed with gumption as I would want out of a beer. Classic."
"D- Pretty solid brew I just think there are others that are better."
"Full mouth feel but very smooth and creamy. Quite enjoyable to drink."
"I am transferring my notes from some time ago so I'm not sure if I remember how drinkable it was but as I recall it was absolutely excellent"
"M,D: The mouthfeel is rather thick, with a little lack of carbonation on this one. Overall, decent brew, but not one of my favorite SS."
"D- I split the bomber, but I feel like I could easily drink the whole thing and maybe finish a second one."
"I believe this must be the most drinkable imperial stout I have had to date."
"Fruity upfront, not too heavy - good consistency - with bits of chocolate and rum notes carrying through into the middle. Finishes with a warm, smoky espresso wave to help warm the throat and tummy. Can definitely taste and feel the alcohol in this one. No doubt there. You know... I think I'm going to scrap the rest of this review and just enjoy my drink, here. Cheers!"
"Purchased at Kokoman Fine Wines and Liquors in New Mexico."
"D: Differnet than most RIS' but good in a unique sort of way."
"Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Smells of licorice and coffee. Taste is a nice combination of tobacco, coffee, bourbon, but none of them are overly strong. Didn't really detect much chocolate in there. Overall, the flavor is middle of the road as far as intensity goes, but it's a fine beer."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat thick, as is expected, but it's very smooth and creamy, and it may be the most drinkable RIS I've had so far."
"MF&D - Not overly thick, but very enjoyable. Very smooth and creamy. Top Notch!"
"This one does not do it for me...I will gladly take a Rasputin or a Storm King over this any day."
"overall this is one of the best imperial stouts i have had."
"This was a really nice imperial stout. Very well balanced and was very enjoyable. It looked nice and thick and creamy. Smelled very rich and complex. Tasted great and went down real smooth with a fruity after taste. Mouthfeel was thick yet rich and creamy. Real easy to drink."
"still quite decent, but not my favorite in today's competitive field. needs more distinctiveness between all the flavors, plus maybe more malt character."
"This beer took me by surprise, i expected a harsher taste but it went down smooth, maybe too smooth. The flavor was like a light smokey stout. It was one of the better stouts that I could drink a few bottle all night and not get tired of it. Not as harsh as a lot of other strong stouts."
"Overall, a very English take on the RIS. A good choice for something different."
"I could drink one of these in a sitting, and you need to drink this on a cold day."
"This is a very drinkable brew, but not an everyday brew. A well deserved end-of-the-week draught for sure."
"Most Samuel Smith offerings have pleased me and I knew this one would too. I swear the aroma reminds me of the best chocolate chip cookie dough. Flavors are so complex here. I just want to take another sip right after I put the glass down. Excellent stuff."
"Im not gonna review this beer as i normally do, im gonna say it pours with all the same charecteristics of a stout and thats where it stops being typical, very rich/comnplex flavor that can only really be appreciated by drinking it, exceptionally smooth and creamy. I've heard it said that people would feel spoiled if they were allowed to drink something on a normal basis and its exacly how i feel about this."
"D: Another great beer from Samuel Smith's Brewery. This is actually rather drinkable for a RIS. The alcohol content is on the low side, and the body isn't like motor oil, making it easier to sip on."
"M&D: A little light for the style, I was expecting something a little more viscous. At 7% ABV, I could drink plenty of these, but it would be best served as a sipper after dinner. Very good example. Skal."
"I was not as impressed with this as I thought I might be. It was fairly heavy and flavors were muted. Still worth a try, but not among my favorites."
"I will gladly throw this down with anyone and recommend this beer to my non-beer geek friends as that rare beer that is not expensive yet close to perfect."
"D: This one is definitely a sipper, or a nice beer to have with desert. I usually don't pay this much for a four pack but I was absolutely not dissapointed. I will keep this around more often"
"D - Looks and smells like a great stout, but tast and feel are average... A nice brew, but I expect more from Samuel Smith brews... I'll take a Taddy Porter over this in a heartbeat..."
"I'm glad I let this one warm up. Picked up 12 oz bottle from World of Beer in Tampa, FL. Pours a near opaque black with a dark tan head the recedes rather quickly. Aroma is great. Not to burnt or powerful on the malt side and the hops do shine through with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Could benefit from more hopping but still.... Yummy."
"Nose is of maple syrup, molasses, prunes and a slight burnt malt hints of black patent. This brew is a monster but balanced all at once, more molasses with coffee and bittersweet chocolate mingles with strong but flirting herbal hop tinges. Sweet malts blend with plums, raisins, and prunes. Slight leather note that finishes to a round sweet malt note that fades to a slight soy sauce and then back to herbal hops and yet again back to sweet malts. MAN, what a finish on this beer. Mouthfeel is thinner than I remember but at the same time this beers' finish is just one of the best I can recall."
"Flavour starts off heavily herbal with anise and fennel coming right to the front, then that heavily roasted coffee bitterness that immediately gets set off by a lactic acidity that cleans the palate nicely. Not much in the way of sweetness, but what there is is demerara sugar mixed with a dark fruity note. This is a very well balanced Impy stout, mannered but very flavourful. Not overwhelming, just a great sipper. Carbonation is medium-low, and the palate dries well with the bitterness and acidity, begging for another sip. Drinkable as the 7% lets you finish a big bottle and not feel too bad."
"Overall, this is a drinkable ale, but it's biggest defect is it's odd flavor combination. Don't get me wrong, its good, but at the same time, I feel it could be a lot better. To be honest, it tastes like it was fermented too hot and a few off flavors developed."
"Pours beautiful black with a thick black head. Wonderful aroma of chocolate and toffee. Taste of dark chocolate and toffee that slides into a slightly bitter finish, which has a roasted quality. Beer is faily well balanced. Not quite as big as an American Imperial Stout, but has an impressive taste profile."
"Cheers..."
"Overall, a very solid stout. Flavors are potent, but not cloying or overbearing, yet still solid. Not my favorite in the style, but still deserves a lot of respect and is one i would definitely get again."
"Overall - The first Imperial Stout I have tried, and a very good one too."
"The flavour as well is not complex, but hits home all the same. Rich sweet molasses, balanced out with robust roasted malt on the finish. Lightly bitter cocoa/coffee in the aftertaste, although pleasingly balanced with some sweet brewer's licorice. Combine it with the full, yet smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and this has got to be one of the most beautifully crafted stouts I've ever tried, Imperial or otherwise. I can easily see how Catherine The Great and her court (or cohorts) could have fallen in love with something akin to this as well and kept a steady supply ordered and imported from England, Yum! Can't say I share her intense love of horses however...."
"very smooth and pretty drinkable. smells like chocolate. it has a sweeter malty flavor with a quick sharp bitterness tucked in."
"D - Very good."
"Poured similar to a Guinness with a frothy brown head taking up half the glass in all its creamy foamy glory. This brew is for all purposes black but when held up to the light you can make out some brown color. The head stuck around for a long time. The aroma is sweet and fruit-like with the presence of alcohol. At first sip it is confusing but afterwards the flavors come out. This sweet brew is rich in awesome bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The feel is surprisingly thin but smooth and slick. Towards the end of the pint my mouth is fairly dry. One pint is enough. Different than any imperial stout I have ever had!"
"Overall, this is an okay beer. IDK if its worth a top 100 spot BUT its still decent."
"Probably the best Stout I've had to date and the price is right for a heady import."
"Beer poured black as night with a two fingered tan head. Nose is roasted malts, coffee, and English hops. Taste is a very good medley of roasted chocolate malts, coffee and cream, hints of molasses all balanced quite nicely by those English hops. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy but is a bit thinner than most in this style. Drinkability is quite good. Although this is quite a bit lighter than most in this class this is a beer that is definitely worth another go around for me as it offers a lot of great characteristics in one 355ml bottle."
"This brew pours opaque black with thick medium brown head that sticks around and eventually fades to thick pad, lacing the glass with broken sticky blotches. The nose is strong with rich maltiness, dark chocolate, molasses and dark fruits. Very big brew on the palate. Fills out with rich sweet malt and dark chocolate. Very round mouthfeel... complex flavors are quite overwhelming. Fruit tones and toffee/roast character present as well. Sweetness helps round the mouthfeel out yet isn't overbearing and is reminiscent of molasses or sorghum. Brew lingers on the palate with complex series of flavors. Abundant strong flavors supported with good hop bitterness. Decent quaffibility considering style, although it is quite filling. Definately meant to be savored, yet finishing the 550ml bottle is not challenging at all."
"Black in color with a medium head. Aromas were of molasses, brown sugar, bitter chocolate and a touch of coffee. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with plenty of carbonation to keep it seeming fresh. Hops are noticable on the finish keeping it bitter."
"D = Good drinkability. A very nice RIS."
"One of my favorite stouts. I will be definitely be buying more."
"D- Very impressive. I have had this numerous times in the past and didn't think too much of it. I guess my palate has evolved a bit."
"D - I couldn't drink more than one, maybe two of these; not because it doesn't taste good, but because of the heaviness and intensity of this brew."
"What's that you say? There's more in the bottle? Done."
"M & D: Rich and very well-rounded. It's got a big and full flavour, but doesn't go overboard. Rather, it's a bit more subdued with nice complexities to make out of it. An excellent representation of the style, and one I will be making a point of coming back to regularly."
"Very, very drinkable, rich and light.... Sam smiths has done it again, the alcohol is barely apparent.... a joy to drink. I expected more of a punch in the face from the ""Imperial"" aspect of this beer... but was very pleased with the balance of intensity. This beer will not disappoint."
"I can drink this all night long if I could afford it and if it was available to me in Alabama. Love this beer and highly recommend."
"This is one of my all time favorite breweries. They make some fabulous beers and this is a prime example. I enjoyed this slightly chilled in my Warsteiner mug. Dark, opaque brown in appearance. Nose had an aroma of bittersweet chocolate with a hint of molasses and a touch of candied sugar. Taste was superbly balanced with enough hop bitterness to not makeit overly sweet with some baker's chocolate notes and a kiss of molasses. Very good stuff."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is low which makes it go down easy for an Imperial Stout. There is a smooth character overall that I enjoy and would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Overall pretty nice, but not the best Imperial."
""
"Drinkability: This is one I'll definitely come back to. My palate had to adjust to the hugeness of the beer, but once I did, it was pretty much heaven. The heaviness of the beer pretty much limited me to one bottle."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. A nice combination of a great taste and a smooth mouthfeel made it an excellent beer. The alcohol is not too high for an ""Imperial"" by extreme beer standards, but it did well to compliment the mouthfeel and taste. An excellent brew overall."
"This I could drink everyday, if I could afford it."
"It pours black as night with a small, tan head. Smells of sweet chocolate and a touch of toffee. The taste is very good. Semi-sweet chocolate up front, followed by a burnt toffee taste with coffee tones at the very end. It is very creamy and goes down nicely. This was not as over-the-top and a bit more balanced compared to some other Imperials I have tried."
"Edit: This beer hardly qualifies as a RIS at just 7% abv - but in the English tradition it delivers more flavour than would seem possible for the strength. Brilliant stuff!"
"I can't say I dislike the fruitiness, but it is a little much for my taste. While this is a certainly a fine English example of the style, my personal preference is more towards a cleaner, roastier, and more agressive beer."
"Drinkability: This is unlike any RIS you've ever had and well worth trying. It's subtle and enjoyable."
"D- a benchmark indeed, that goes without saying, and though our american brewers make some great RIS, this one takes the cake for me. Old Rasputin might give it a run for its money, but sammy wins in the long run cuz of the mysterious D factor. in this case it's not so mysterious- the 7% abv. yeah and the incredible flavors and smells and everything else, but with that 2-4% lower alcohol come less knock you out of your chair intensity, allowing this one to drink as good as their oatmeal stout. this is unquestionable perfection. i could easily (if i wanted to wind up with my face on the concrete) sit and enjoy pint after imperial pint of this magical elixir."
"Drinkability: Well balanced and delicious. It isn't as full-bodied as some of the imperial stouts I've had, but it comes off as a very nice package. Everything is toned down to just the right frequency to experience all the complex flavors, in just the right amount. Don't get me wrong, a lot of flavor and feel in this beer, but it's not pumped up to the level where I have to be 100% focused on the beer in order to fully experience it."
"Very drinkable with a medium-light mouthfeel."
"For a stout, this is the easiest one to drink yet. I don't drink a lot of stout, but this one is amazingly smooth and not as heavy as others I have taken in."
"This beer pours a jet black color with a tall and medium bodied tan head that fades to just a rim around the glass. It laces the glass pretty well on the way down. It has a very deep roasted malt smell with a chocolatey aroma and a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is excellent for an RIS. It has a very deep roasted malt base followed by nice chocolatey and caramel flavors and then a bit of rasiny taste and then a short but perfect hoppy bitterness that rounds out the ber very well. It has a very creamy, velvety, and warming mouthfeel that doesn't really hit you in the face with alcohol, but it is strong enough to warm. The drinkability is very good and I would definately have more than one of these. Definatly worth a try."
"Decided to pick up a 4 pack of Sam Smith's Imperial stout on a recent beer run. I haven't had this in a while, but it was as good as I remember it. Doesn't smack you around like some other imp. stouts but still plenty of flavor."
"This poured an opaque black with a little dark tan head. It smelled like roast malt with prunes and alcohol. It tasted like licorice and bitter coffee with some roast malt for balance. It was watery and smooth with just a little carbonation and a strong malt aftertaste. Overall this was not quite what I expected - good but not super. In fact, I think I've been disappointed with just about all the Sam Smiths."
"This beer had a very dark and clean appearance, while supporting a decent one-finger head. The smell and taste supplied my mouth with hints of coffee and roasted like flavors. The mouthfeel was above average and left my a bit dry after. This Imperial Stout was exceptionally easy to drink and I would recommend it to any beer lover."
"A solid black beer you can not see through held up to the light. Poured a nice 1-2 finger dark tan head that disappeared quickly leaving very little lacing. The slightest hint of alcohol at first but then a wave of smokey goodness with a slight dark-fruit malt backing. Mouthfeel comes on a bit creamy but just like the head, thins out leaving little behind. Left the roof of my mouth a bit dry but I didn't mind. Definitely a beer I could drink again and again with no end in sight."
"D: This is a pretty heavy beer, but I can see myself finishing the four pack in one session because it's so damn good. Just like all of the other Sam Smith brands, an excellent representation of the style."
"This has long been my favorite stout, and for nostalgia's sake I somewhat regret not making it my first review on BA. Better late than never, I suppose."
"D: Nice easy drinker for a RIS, well balanced enough and nice active mouthfeel, but may have been sitting on the shelf for just a bit too long."
"drinkability - Very good stout that has been on for many years. A must try for any stout lover."
"This Imperial Stout leaves me craving another sample. It continues to encourage you to keep drinking it and searching for new flavors. Excellent beer! I could imbibe quite a few of these on an empty stomach."
"D: Drinkability is outstanding, especially considering its style as a RIS. I could definitely do a few of these at a time, proposing they not be $8 a beer. I would definitely recommend a Samuel Smith Imperial Stout. One of the finer brews I've had."
"I haven't had one of these in probably a year... instead been sampling and enjoying the bigger badder cousins in the style. The Samuel Smith RIS should be considered more as a founder or the father of the style in my opinion. Nothing is over the top and that adds immensely to the overall experience."
"D - Really one of the best Imperial stouts. If the price as a little lower, I could drink this every day."
"A slight sweetness with a creamy aftertaste. A mild burnt coffee/chocolate taste. Top Notch."
"D - overall an average RIS that doesn't really seems to have the complexities of some of the other RISs that I have had. It is huge on the smoky characters and does not taste bad but has nothing beyond that that makes this beer stick out. Plus as noted in the MF section it is so thick in the mouth and the body and maybe even mixed in with the smoky taste that makes this hard to have more than one in my opinion."
"D-this is a very special beer(period)"
"Poured into a pint glass. Mainly black in color with some reddish highlights. Mocha colored head leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is distinctly English, with less chocolate/coffee and more fruit/molasses. Taste echos the nose, with supple dark fruits, berry, sharp molasses, wood, coffee beans. Great complexity and yet so smooth. Easy to drink and well-balanced."
"Overall another great offering from Sam Smith. Very complex!"
"This Smithy takes a slight step back in the flavor department, but is still really good. Not quite as outstanding as some of the versions I have had, but still deep once it warms a bit, and more drinkable than most."
"D: It almost makes me wish it were colder outside (instead it's sunny and windy). A perfect brew for a cold's winters night. It makes me miss Brooklyn. I will definitely be hitting this again for the next holiday season."
"What a super-exceptional beer! Pours a nice black thick body with a creamy delicious head that just stays. It just stays. The taste is immediately chocolate and bold. There are carmel and bits of molasses undertones but the main theme here is chocolatey goodness. This one stands strong amongst the best. One of my favorite stouts ever. Highly recommended."
"Here comes the roasted malt that was hiding in the nose...so smooth. Anise is still there. The taste is complex. Dark fruit show up mostly at the beginning and give way to the roasted tastes. Maybe some apples somewhere in the taste as well. It all blends together surprisingly well. I couldn't drink too much of this though."
"D - Good for a cold night after a warm meal, but not an everyday drink."
"bottle on sale at Whole Foods Raleigh, $2.99"
"Overall, a pretty decent brew. Aside from having a little too much fruit in the taste, a pretty good example of the style."
"Poured a deep dark almost black with a toffee colored head, which reduced to a lace of bubbles clinging to the glass. Strong scent of alcohol mixed liberally with toffee and roasted accents. Tastes of chocolate and alcohol, but not astringent. Very pleasant tasting Russian Imperial Stout. The body seemed a little thin as compared to others I have sampled recently. Overall good beer very true to style."
"This is my first experience with an RIS. Enjoyed it very much and thought it was a good one to sart with. I won't pretend to know what I'm talking about as far as picking out tastes, smells, etc... Though, in my first sip I thought I tasted a bit of light smoke on the front end. Maybe the roasted malt many others say they taste in this beer. I'm looking forward to tasting more strong beers like this and will have to taste this one again in the future so I can actually give it some scores..."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. The 550 mL bottle may be a bit big for some RIS, but I'd prefer a full 650mL/22 oz of this brew!"
"I prefer a RIS with a little more alcohol, but this is a great example of the style. I would definitely buy again."
"There are many reasons why this one has become a benchmark of the style and stuck around for so long, because it is very good. Look for this on a winter day, or anytime you want a meal in a bottle."
"D: Honestly I'm a little disappointed. But, I think I may have a bad bottle (or at least I hope so), and I only have this one. I think I will get another bottle, and revamp this if necessary."
"It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a beer geek's ascension into manhood."
"2013 Update: Old Rasputin still superior."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, the high ABV is hidden very nicely, the drinkability is also very good. I will be seeing this beer again very soon."
"Drinkability- A solid, solid IMPY stout. Not the heaviest out there, a great beer to sit back and relax with."
"D: A very balanced beer. I imagine several over a game of gin rummy would be quite on par there, Jeeves, yes indeed!"
"Let me preface by saying that I am not a big Stout drinker. That said, I think this stuff is pretty good, much better than the common Guiness. It is extremely dark and poors with an extremely small brown head that soon disappears. There is a bit of dried fruit in the aroma and taste. The aroma almost has a Apple/cider hint to it on top of the dark chocolate. The taste is good and full with a slightly sweet finish."
"An amazingly black beer with thick froth head, Smell is that of expresso. The taste is that of strong bitter coffee and maybe the tinniest hint of cocoa and orange. Has a syrupy feel on the tongue initially followed by a crisp taste like that of a grapefruit. Goes down the throat quite easily. A pretty heavy beer, not one I'd want to drink more then one of at a time"
"I like this beer a lot and will definitely buy it again."
"Not really my favorite stout or a stout I would buy again. I think I'll stick with their Oatmeal Stout."
"Pours black with a nice rich light toffee colored head. Smells of sweet caramel and soy sauce. Taste is rich, creamy, definite smokiness, and a roasty and caramel and soy sauce flavor with a hint of dry sourness. Fairly light carbonation gives it a decent oily thick mouthfeel. Definitely a different stout than those I've had before. Tastes almost like what I would imagine a very subtle rauchbier might be like, even though I've never had one. Unique lingering smoky tart soy flavor. Not a stout I'd ever drink again"
"This beer is black with a beautiful brownish head. Chocolate and dark fruits dominate the inviting aroma of this beer. Very smooth, almost creamy on the palate. The flavor is a mix of chocolate and espresso nicely balanced with bitterness. The beer ends appropriately with a lasting bitterness. This is a nicely balanced and drinkable beer, great with chocolate. This is a standard of the style."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are the high lights of this brew. Creamy, but yet still fairly thin. Definitely the thinnest RIS I've had. At only 7.0% this is probably one of the more drinkable imperial stouts out there. Overall, not too impressed with this one, probabaly won't buy it again."
"Like Fish113d, I find that I've moved on from SS Oatmeal Stout to the Imperial, having discovered it on the beer shelf. It's fuller, more powerful and yet still well rounded. Strong roasted malt flavours with hints of coffee in the finish - a finish which lasts a very long time. The nose could be a little stronger but I'm not going to mark it down too much for that. I'd prefer more in the way of hops too, but that's just personal preference - this is still a world-class stout which leaves very little to be desired."
"The feel was a bit oily. Carbonation, however, seemed perfect. Just enough to give your mouth that feeling that it's ready for the next sip without going over the top."
"I can hardly contain myself for this one. It's the apex of British beer, and dare I say most beer around the world. The velvety chocolate and espresso flavors work the palate over while the dark and rich earthiness nestle in the taste buds. There's no explosion of flavor here; everything is in proportion and classy. Mouthfel is rich, smooth, and creamy. I could drink this all day. Stout heaven, folks."
"Poured inot a Guinness pint glass, the appearance is black with brownish hues on the edges and a thick tan head on top the body. The aroma has a pinch of alcohol, then followed by smoked chocolate and coffee. The taste begins sweet and smokey like tobacco and cocoa. There's some roasted characeter as well in the form of sweet malt. Alcohol is a little heavier than expectations, which makes things a little fruity. There's some chocolate fudge cake that appears briefly before being knocked down. The ABV is on the low-end for RIS's, but this beer has a full bodied taste that should be respected with slow sips."
"D: A very drinkable Imperial Stout, on the light side of this category, but is probably more reminiscent of the actual historical style of this beer, very good."
"Very drinkable tasty brew. I really enjoy their oatmeal stout, but this has taken over as my favorite of their offerings. I'm sure a few would warm me up on such a cold night in PA."
"Quite nice, worth waiting for. Goes down very easily."
"Complex and packed with flavour...you don't want to run out of this stuff. A bit pricy but worth it...stout lover's fantasy and a true treat."
"Nice smoothness considering the relatively high alcohol content. I like how the taste lingers on the palate for a very long time, but as it does, it seems to shift character. An earthy start slowly shifts to a mild bitterness after a half minute or so. The smell is a bit too caramelly, and reminds me a bit of the over the top smell and taste of the Saranac Caramel Porter, but nowhere near as cloyingly sweet. While I generally am one to not reach for a stout or porter first, I find that this is consistently one I have around the house. (When a store in town actually stocks it or most often when I specifically order it.) This is a beer that makes me want to attempt to brew an Imperial Stout! (Only to be dissapointed when it tastes bad after 6 months of waiting...)"
"The beer pours a wonderful black with a thick tan head. Lots of malt sweetness on teh aroma. The tast is sweet with a hint of fruit. The body is medium and there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. This is very drinkable for an imperial stout and is a great introduction to the syle."
"D - On outstanding brew! And at 7% ABV, this stands to be a quite drinkable RIS. It's ridiculously complex and subtle in ways that many American RIS are not. Those heavy hitting American brews may be stunning and flashy, but this has true complexity like an old single malt scotch."
"Notes: Bow down to the true Czar of Imperial Stouts! Absolutely tops in my book for this style. As usual, it's always refreshing to try Sammy Smith's British spin on great beer styles such as this one. Being a hop lover yet not a full-fledged hophead, I tend to favor this type of take on the Imperial versus the often over-zealously hopped American examples."
"Would put this at one end of a session. First thing I opened after getting home from work, but would also make the perfect nightcap."
"Everything they do is good."
"Another terrific brew from Samuel Smith... their Imperial Stout really hits home with flavor, substance, and style... Pours a jet-black color with minimal tan head... smell is dominated by dark chocolate and strong black espresso... taste has a strong black-coffee, mocha, espresso flavor that really pulls through and delivers... very elegant and refined flavor that packs a punch with a 7% ABV... goes down smooth and crisp with minimal bitterness present, more on the sweet-side than anything else... full of character and flavor... good mouthfeel and easy drinkability for a relatively high ABV... don't taste the alcohol, just the sweet, sugarey, malty taste... one of the better stouts I've had... Definitely recommended..."
"D - This is a highly drinkable brew..though with it being an Imperial Stout not one you would drink multiples in a night..the overall taste and flavor made this for a great end of the evening night cap and good for the colder weather..no wonder the Czar Peter loved these things.."
"Before this, the only Samuel Smith's I'd had was the Nut Brown. I was impressed with this one. The appearance was dark - very dark - with a little bit of head on it. It had a nutty smell common with many of Samuel Smith's beers. The taste was excellent, with coffee, barley and a nutty flavor coming through. It does leave a strong aftertaste. There was a nice, subtle carbonation related to the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, though it is pretty heavy."
"Very good drinkable Imperial Stout. Not as extreme as most RIS's, but very satisfying. I really like the clean, crisp, hoppy dry after taste. The burnt malts don't linger as much as most RIS's."
"D: Excellent drinkability! This has a lot of the flavors of bigger RIS but without the crushing abv."
"this is a damn fine beer and on of my favorite from samuel smith's."
"D: Excellent example of the style. Very drinkable for the style as well."
"I bought this from Cracked Kettle and man do I love the bottle itself. The bottle itself is a nice slim and tall design with the top nicely wrapped in gold foil and a unique looking label. This beer yields a jet black pour with a nicely creamy looking tan head that moderately settles to a thin layer and finally a nice clingy lacing. On the nose I pick up roasted malts, chocolates, coffee and subtle dashes of dark fruits; some lactic milkiness also peaks out of the creamy head. The smell was not very strong and the various elements in the smell were nicely balanced out. The taste starts off with an immediately suggestion of coffee followed by roasted malts and light notes of chocolates here and there with a nice smooth milky backing. There were also dashes of dark fruits towards the finish and a good amount of roasted malts on the nose. Sweetness was probably very very subtle on this one and a slighty below moderate level of bitterness can be detected towards and during the finish. Taste was fairly rich though not very rich and it was very well balanced; without too much of anything. 7 ABV makes it a really light drink as well and it practically feels below 5. The lingering after taste had coffee, roasted malts and subtle dark fruits and a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is close to full bodied and is smooth and creamy with low carbonation and goes down very smooth. This is my first imperial stout and I feel that it is highly drinkable. I was expecting something pretty heavy. I prefer the Guinness Special Export Stout to this but the strength of this one is a nice, well balanced blend of many different flavours but not overly rich and yet very enjoyable and drinkable."
"D- Fantastic, couldnt and wouldnt want to drink more than 2,one to savour!"
"Did i mention that this beer was smooth and very drinkable, there is no negative aftertaste like bitterness, bad alcohol (although its not that high of abv), or burnt malt sourness."
"This is an intence brew. It controls you. I can never finish a whole bottle, but then again, I always come back and try!"
"This beer pours blacker than a witches cat on a moonless night. The head is a strong light tan foam with good lace. The nose is kind of strange. It has typical roasted malt and chocolate/coffee bean hints, yet also has a bit of scotch ale smell (very slight). The taste starts out very malty with the chocolate, burnt coffee bean, and small vanilla taste. Through the middle I realize that what i thought was scotch ale on the nose was actually the sammy smith yeastish malt funk(good funk) that you can find in almost all of their brews. There is slight hop flavor and bite here as well, just before the finish. The finish falls back into the more familiar imperial flavors. The mouthfeel is where this beer struggles. it is very thin for an imperial stout, but goes down smooth. I suspect that this can be closely linked to the brews weak 7% abv. Drinkability is very high. still a good brew overall and a great beginners imperial stout. A good buy, and another great sammy smiths beer."
"Poured this from a clear bottle (though I only found out it was clear AFTER pouring). Opaque black with a two-fingered dark khaki head, which later settled to become a rather thick layer of froth that lay on top. Thick lacing, though it doesn't stick very long. Wonderful smell. Nice and strong. One can detect dark fruits, roasted coffee, caramel, and brown sugar. Very sweet smelling. Taste was a little fainter than the smell indicated, though still complex and still delicious. The darker fruits make themselves a little more known as it warms. Mouthfeel is creamy, though a little on the thin side. This is very drinkable, especially for an imperial stout. Low ABV for the style, though still very warming."
"D: Tasty, I could have another pint."
"Drinkability- This isnt as explosive as some other Imperial Stouts but its really solid and all the flavors meld really well. I love a well balanced brew and this really embodies that. This was a really good beer and I can now say I officially like a Samuel Smith beer. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a good Imperial Stout. A nice heavy drinkable beer. This beer weighs in at 7% abv, and is a perfect winter warmer for a cold December night."
"Drinkability: A very good and classic stout. A nice, complete package."
"Drinkability: A great Imperial Stout, although a stronger brew is preferred. Very good over a rich meal and a cold night. Certainly looking forward to the next pint."
"Drinkability: Very nice. A great tasting imperial stout that isn't high in alcohol. Certainly gains drinkability because of that. This is a good beer that I would revisit, but not in the company of other Imperial Stouts. Worth a try."
"D - A very nice & interesting Imperial Stout. Something that I'd highly recommend. The strong flavours limit the drinkability. Two would be about it I think."
"Notes - A very approachable Russian Imperial Stout - it's warming but not overly heavy or bitter, and it still has plenty of character. That said, I'd take Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout over this any day."
"The lower ABV for this style of beer makes it possible to enjoy more than one (or two or three). Even with the lower ABV, I don't think any of the taste has been compromised."
"palate. Highly enjoyable."
"Flavor is plummy, with an earthy roast that creeps out halfway through. Some carob or chocolate syrup, not exactly pure. Low astringency, medium level of carbonation. Not especially sweet or bitter, it's fairly mild feeling. It's easily drinkable and enjoyable, but overall not that remarkable."
"drinkability is alright. this is a huge brew that is very bold and thick on the palate. the high alcohol is not present until warming, which helps a bit."
"d - this was delicious and i enjoyed every drop."
"D - Yes, this will be on the plate in the future."
"Mouthfeel was on the thin side for an RIS. A bit fizzy. Goes down pretty quick. NOt bad, but there are much better RIS out there."
"D: I enjoy this fine example of an RIS even with the ABV being so low. It allows you to enjoy more of the fine flavors."
"D- pretty good but bear republic is still my taste/$ choice"
"Had this delightful beverage in a pint glass. The color is an impressive midnight black. The smell is of smoke and chocolate in great balance. The taste is very much what the smell would indicate, more smoke and chocolate. The mouthfeel to me is a bit overcarbonated, but the beer is growing on me. I had an amazing Oak aged Yeti Imperial stout last night, and I recall enjoying it a bit more, and there being slightly less carbonation. The beer is as drinkable as an imperial stout can be, much like nipples, one is too few and three is too many."
"Poured a 350 ml bottle into a larger then imperial pint glass. Poured a thin black with probably the largest head I've seen poured on a beer. The head was a light, billowy brown. Aroma is molasses, dark chocolate, heavy cream and raisins. Taste is creamier then most RIS's Ive had. Lots of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, with a hint of alcohol at the end. The taste isnt as over powering as many other RIS's. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is the best for the style Ive had."
"Good."
"18.7 oz bottle poured into a Samuel Smith IP glass. Nice, dark, coffee appearance with thick head. Smells good. There is some buttery notes along with coffee and chocolate, with small amount of hop finish. This is a smooth Imperial Stout though I am not as impressed with it as the ratings would indicate. I really like Samuel Smith products and would buy this again if no Rogue or Great Divide were available."
"The flavor was a bit buttery, but mostly chocolate notes prevailed. Some slight caramels and a choco-liquor rounded out the taste, and some bittering hops finished. The body was medium-thick, exceptionally smooth, and somewhat creamy. This isn't something I could drink every day, but the complexity, great taste, and overall classiness of the Sam Smith's Imperial Stout make it a truly drinkable ale."
"A very good RIS. Sam Smith continues to produce somewhat controversial beers. They are all good and traditional, but with a twist, and the sweetness of this beer is not exception. A fine example of the style"
"Wow! This is my first experience with an Imperial Stout and I was not disappointed at all! This poured a beautiful inky black with a nice foamy head and I couldn't see through this thing at all. It smelled wonderfully rich and I knew before I had ever taken my first sip that I was in for a wonderful experience. This was the most complex beer that I have had up to this point, it was wonderful. I smelt and tasted roasted coffee and dark chocolate while I enjoyed this beer. I was expecting it to be a bit thicker than it was from the appearance but it's not a complaint. I was wondering how the 7% ABV would affect that taste but I have to say, while I did taste the alcohol, it added to the whole experience. This is a beer that seems fairly available in my area, unlike a lot of other Imperial Stouts, and I see myself keeping this around a lot this winter. Excellent!"
"Notes: finally, a beer whose beauty is paralleled by the beauty of its bottle"
"I could drink these all day until the abv catches up with me."
"This is a remarkable beer. It pours a deep black with a copper head that disappears quickly. Looks like a typical stout, lacking the show-stopping head of a Guiness. This beer smells absolutely beatiful. I almost wish I could drink it through my nose. Lots of fruit in the aroma, which surprised me for a stout, but it almost smelled like wine. Also smells of malt, chocolate and coffee. Palate is full, thick and velvety smooth as a stout should be. The flavor is coffee, malt, chocolate with a fruity tang. Has a bit of a winey alcohol flavor as it warms. Its extremely complex, yet very drinkable."
"It's a very smooth, easily consumable beverage, one that I will surely not wait another two years to try again."
"T&M: This is a very good beer and in my opinion and one of the smoothest imperial stouts around. A nice full body is well blended with sweet malts and roasted espresso. More sweet flavors of caramel, chocolate, and dried berries come out as it warms. Everyting is brought together by a light hop presence and warming alcohols."
"Wow. I knew this was a good beer, but I'm shocked at how much I enjoyed this. There is no fault in this beer at all. I guess I'll need to make sure I have this more than once a year in the future."
"I've been saving this brew since I picked up in August. It had a sour smell, a little like soy sauce, odd. I thought maybe it had gone bad, but the taste had no sour notes. Maybe the smell I picked up was just a variety of malts. Poured out with a thing head, and looked a bit lighter in terms of density compared to other stouts. Tasted of the coffee and chocolate that most stouts had, but had incredibly earthy hints, possibly of nuts or some spices. Overall, great tasting beer and I was pleased that it did not disappoint."
"Sampled from 550 mL bottle. Poured into chalice and wow is it dark, I really cant see any color other than black, nice mocha colored head however very little of it. I was expecting a thicker head but for whatever reason very little on glass #1 and none on glass #2. Smell was initally as alcohol, another sniff revealed what seemed to be raisin. As it warmed it took on a slightly coffee-like smell. Taste was incredible, the first smell wasnt too impressive but boy was the taste. Very creamy and smooth texture to the drink. I can taste chocolate, coffee, raisin, a bit of the ""typical"" stout tastes (for me at least) but something about this one was incredible. I like the fact that it is lower in alcohol, that made it a little more drinkable and enjoyable in my book. Overall a great beer and seems worthy of its high reviews."
"Review updated 2012."
"American breweries have been pushing the alcohol content on their Imp Stouts higher and higher at the expense of drinkability. I'll take the refined smoothness of Sam Smith's anyday."
"I don't like the soy sauce flavor, and the alcohol makes this hard to drink and enjoy. I just finished an Old Rasputin, which is a great RIS. This is not."
"Poured from the bottle it had the typically good dark stout appearance with a brownish-white head. Its aroma was to die for: a great syrupy roast with hints of chocolate. However, I was blown away with how radically different but awesome its taste was. It was heavy, but it had a sourish sip with a great, sweet aftertaste. It was lighter comparatively with other stouts with a thin texture, allowing one to enjoy large sips. Overall this was an awesome imperial stout!"
"The taste meets the expectations that my nose has led me to. Lots of molasses, dark fruits, a bit of espresso and some toasted malt. A great brew and one I would recommend to any serious stout drinkers."
"Good, but not as good as I remember. Pours a deep dark chocolate brown, but not quite black, with a small light brown creamy head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and quite a bit of alcohol, along with some sour fruit notes (dates?). Taste is malty and quite bitter, with the sweetness mostly contained within the aftertaste. Slightly thinner mouthfeel than I remember from before -- last time I had this was way back at the beginning of my craft beer days (way back being about 2-3 years). There are many RISs that I'd prefer now that I've tried a few more."
"This beer seemed a bit of a mystery to me. I love stouts, but have never had an Imperial stout. This was my first. The beer pours almost jet black, with a brown head. The smell of this beer is very sweet, and wonderful. However, the taste in my opinion didn't match the smell. The sweetness is only brief in the front, but then turns bitter, and finishes a bit smoky. Mouthfeel was think, and ok. Drinkability is ok, but at the end of the glass it was getting hard to finish. Overall, I can see why people like this, its flavorful, and has a lot going on. For me however, I guess I don't like overly bitter stouts. I was disappointed because I am a huge fan of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. I will give this beer another chance, but for the price, I'll take their Oatmeal Stout over this one."
"that tastes fuckin good. rich but not heavy (i would go velvety). hops are for balance only. a hint of coffee, but otherwise...wait, was that apple juice? a touch of hazelnut or something sneaks in, as well. there is a touch of bitterness, but it really is a simple rearjaw sensation...minor"
"D: A very drinkable brew - especially for the style. This is on my buy list."
"D: Body makes it drink very easy and it's a very tasty brew. Not a behemoth of a RIS but very good nonetheless."
"When you drink past the big head, you find a robust flavor, coffee, burnt toast, and a malty smoothness. Up front a bit sour, but overwhelmed by those sweet and dark flavors that linger. Very nice mouthfeel, very nice aftertaste. Quite drinkable, although 550ml is a lot."
"Easily the most drinkable RID I've had. The best part is that it does not sacrifice flavor for drinkability. A must try."
"D - Like black magic, it weaves a spell and tells a story w/ its magnitude, a fantastic example -The premier of it's style. I truly enjoy this quality stout sip by pleasure filled sip."
"Great drinkability, wish I had more right now because it's gonna be gone before my Coronado Double Toro."
"M/D: this is a robust beer, relatively strong, compared to an avg days beer, but because of that its more complex, more tasty, more delicious. i wouldn't mind ordering this beer on the menu at any point, its very good and worth any ones try"
"Another nice sample from Samuel Smith's. Has a beautiful pillowy head and lacing down the glass. Nice toffee notes on the nose and very buttery. A classic of the style, to say the least. Some chocolatey notes as well. Some plumbyness as well. A nice offering from a great brewery!"
"Dark, with only the slightest of ruby accents hidden away. Very aromatic with nice notes of sweet soy & roast. Well-carbonated, this will lend itself to easy drinking coupled with a relatively thin body & well concealed alcohol. Nutty, mildly hoppy, and not nearly as dense as I would have hoped for, or expected. Recommended."
"I've never had an Imperial Stout before (showing my relative ignorance here), but judging on the score, this is a good one. This was probably one of the more drinkable stouts I've encountered, although the same can be said of all of the Samuel Smith stouts that I've had. The taste and mouthfeel is quite heavy and complex, but that's kind of the idea with a stout. One might even feel compelled to refer to this as a ""manly brew," which it most certainly is. The taste is hard to describe in layman's terms, but there are strong malt, licorice and coffee notes (I think a coffee drinker that dabbles into beer would especially like this). There's a good amount of sweetness to it as well, but nothing that overpowers the flavor of the beer. The term ""well-balanced"" is a good way to describe this one."
"Excellent Imperial Stout if there ever was one! Smooth pour with an almost red tint through the light. Dark brown head that is tasty but disappeares very quickly. It almost reminds me more of a porter than a stout. Drinks very easily and is very smooth going down. I'm not sure if I would want more than two or three at a time though."
"Pours opaque black with a slight ruby if you try hard enough on a bright light. Soapy 2 finger chocolate milk head that dies and laces. Smells complex. Roasted malt, ground coffee and some plum/jammy smell. Taste is complex as well. Starts a little sweet, coffee grounds, bakers chocolate, fig, then finishes with a raisony wood like smokey finish with some licorice. Longest finish Ive tasted. Interesting to say the least. Medium mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Very drinkable, especially for an RIS. A different but great twist on a timeless style. Definitly worth a try, then another."
"Good beer for the money"
"The Imperial pours a dark ebony. Very little carbonation as the foam head take off pretty quickly. The smell is malt roasty and sensations of alcohol up the nose. The taste initially reminds me of drinking a deep dark red wine. I tend to wondering if this brew is oak aged. It is burned maltiness and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is soft and stays in the upper and lower portion of the back of the mouth. Very good beer probably best enjoyed during the cold winter months in front of the fire."
"Pours a pitch black color with a brown head that is modest. As it warms up, aroma is nice and roasty. There are definitely hints of chocolate and coffee. Smells creamy as well. Taste starts off with a nice roasty blast of malt and coffee up front. Roasted characteristics dance upon my tongue. As corny as this may sound, I'm a sucker for a good imperial stout. However, I will say that it's not the best of the style I've had but still pretty damn good for what it is."
"Found this for $2.99, less than the regular products from Smith sitting beside it. Quite a deal, I say!"
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that goes slowly and leaves traces of lace. Black as the ace spades. Moderate carbonation. Molasses/malty nose. Starts malty with sweet licorice, finishes malty. Sweeter than a Guinness. Medium to heavy bodied, very good imperial stout. $3.89 for a 550ml bottle. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience."
"Sam Smiths makes some wonderful beers, and this is certainly a respectable RIS, but I think there are a good number of other superior examples of this style out there."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark tan with 1.5 cm tan head that is mostly diminishing head. Aroma is sweet with caramel dominating. Initial flavor is sweet, almost cola-like and ends with the warmth of alcohol and slightly bitter chocolate finish. Medium body with light carbonation and lasting after taste. Very drinkable, especially since it comes in the four pack."
"A very smooth and drinkable beer. As I said, very well balanced for lots of flavor but no one taste overpowers the rest."
"Dark, dark brown pour with light brown head that was long-lasting. I was kind of disappointed because I am a big fan of the Oatmeal Stout and Taddy Porter. Alright but to me not great. The taste was just a bit metallic and I just didnt think it was that good. I will try again because I'm a big fan of their other beers."
"edit: taste improved once the beer warmed. do not drink it cold."
"Pours two inched of tan head that never seem to go away, over a solid dark brown near black with red highlights. Looks great. Nose is high on bananas, chocolate, and roasted malt. Strong and inviting, with a little bitterness too. Taste is very good: roasted malt up front, then spices, dried fruit (prunes) come through subtly. The bananas show up again as in the smell, some chocolate and a fair bit of breadiness. Feel is fairly good, full bodied with solid carbonation. This is a very good beer. It might actually be my least favorite RIS because the banana flavor sits there the whole drink and I wasn't really feeling it that much. However, at the price ($4 for an 18.7 oz) this is an incredible value. While likely be having it again soon."
"Excellent brew!!!!"
"D - A very easy drinking, complex RIS."
"Very tasty, and pretty drinkable at only 7% ABV. Not really a beer for having all the time, though."
"Pours a dark brown, light black. Not much head at all. Roasted coffee/chocoalate smell. Smells like roasted malt. Smooth mouthfeel, nice bitter aftertaste, not overwhelming.A very good brew and I highly reccommend it.Samuel Smith truly knows what they are doing."
"D: This is an excellent stout, very well balanced. The alcohol is well hidden, this could be a 3.5% beer, which seems to be unusual for an imperial stout. So many come across as 'hot'. Again, the only thing missing is a little more texture/body to fill things out. Highly recommended."
"D- highly drinkable Imp. stout, tasty and as sessionable as this style can be, mellow, recommended"
"D: I'm sure this will be easier to drink than most Russian Imperials for most people, but for me, I'll take I'll take the others (Storm King, Old Rasputin, Yeti, etc). That said, I really enjoyed it."
"M & D: Nice body, viscosity, and light carbonation to help it go down smooth. Have one with a meal or more than one among friends. Like with their other brews, Samuel Smith is a force to be reckoned with."
"Her taste is so around her smell actually, the sweetness of the beer get present with her rich malt complex flavours followed by a malty chocolate flavours that ends with small bruits berry like flavours. Butterscotch presence is prominent that finishes with a warm alcohol touch."
"While pouring this Imperial stout, I was very surprised that the bottle was of clear glass! Very black color with reddish-brown shades and quick wanishing beige foam. I'm new of this style, and the smell is another surprise. For sure someting very dense, thick, caramel, molasses, toasted coffee. Low carbonation, the beer warms and the taste comes out. Dry up front, I can imagine of smoke, bitter chocolate, coffe again, all rounding in the end leaving a bitter-sweet end. I repeat, I'm new to Imperials, I'm trying Samuel with bitter and milk chocolate (bitter is better, milk leaves your mouth too mixed up), and walnuts (as suggested on the bottle), but for the next I will stick with stilton and walnuts ""gnocchi", ending with a good italian espresso."
"Awesome brew. Feel like I should be in a hunting lodge, sipping this in a snifter with all the other gents and such. Other RIS's will be stronger, but you'll never find a more drinkable one. Cheers."
"A big stout, but not as ""Imperial"" as most out there. That's fine by me, this is incredibly tasty. Worth savoring. Raw, rich and pretty balls-y. NICE."
"As much as I have loved other Samuel Smith beers and want to like this one, I doubt I give it another shot."
"Overall a great beer. A little overwhelming on the molasses, and not very complex, the sweetness really stands out. It's the first Imp. stout I've had in awhile, I've been drinking a lot of wine lately, and the sweetness really stands out, making this a little hard to finish off."
"welcome."
"Wow, this is a truly great beer. Pours a thick dark oil brown with a tan two finger head. A fair amount of lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate first then coffee and burnt toast later. Taste is very similar with a dark chocolate bitterness to the long finish. Wonderfully oily mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect. A winner."
"D- A good example of the style, a true classic."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head which went away very quickly. Lacing is good. It smells like coffee, chocolate, caramel, dark fruit and some alcohol. The beer tastes the same way to me, but with some licorice, wood and acidic twangs to it too. Taste is sweet and bitter at the same time, it's a bit sweeter than I expected. Mouthfeel is medium, it's also creamy, smooth and a bit slick. There's a little too much carbonation for my liking. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent stout. I'd drink it again."
"Black in appearance with no light showing through. Head is minimal as is lacing. Very nice smell suprisingly light and fragrant for an imperial with no alcohol smell. Excellent taste with hops noticeable and a slight coffee, chocolate finish. Not as heavy as one might expect from a Russian Imperial Stout but flavor is exceptional. Mouthfeel was a little acidic on top of the tongue, but not an alcohol bite. Drinkability was the best of all Imperial Stouts for me, as it was the first time I could drink two at a single sitting."
"Overall Sam Smith's Imperial Stout is alright, and I would give it another chance sometime."
"The mouthfeel was great, smooth fullness as I poured it on my tongue and the taste was true to style. Chocolate and biscuit notes with a slight coolness form alchohol from the finish"
"Pours a dark black color with a nice brown head with good retention, that leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is of dark fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is full of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, a little nutty, a bit of smoke and alcohol, and rounds out with a bit of hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. This is a very easy drinker for the style."
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin in the body, and smooth in the texture."
"D - Overall this was a very nice, and very sessionable Impy Stout. It was not very robust, and would not stand up against some of the other heavyweights in its style. However, I feel it does have a nice place there as a good sessionable, not so outragously high ABV stout is always a welcome treat."
"Bottle into snifter. A: Very dark, nearly black, very thick head. S: Very malty with a lot of dark fruit coming through. Molasses and a hint of pineapple. T: Roasted malts giving way to some citrus, raisins, chocolate. M: Creamy, light. D: Really surprising and enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appears to be pitch black, but when held up to the light it's more of a dark brown. There is a nice tan head that slowly leaves a ton of lacing. Smell is big on roasted coffee and chocolate, but it's a more nuanced smell and is very nice. Taste is sweet and chocolatey up front with a nice bitter/dry coffee finish. This tastes very much like a good chocolate bar. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy - there is slight carbonation, which functions well. This is a very drinkable stout - perfect as a dessert. Highly Recommended."
"Another fabulous beer from Tadcaster. A little more dense and a bit less drinkable that the Oatmeal or Taddy Porter, but still a top notch beer that ranks as easily one of the best Stouts out there. I don't know why I don't drink Samuel Smith more often."
"The beautiful sable color and moderate head are attractive, and the decidedly stouty aroma with a strong caramel overtone cries ""You will drink me, and you will enjoy me!"" Flavor is rich and malty, and has caramel hints and a touch of smokiness. It goes down with a smooth, pleasant finish that has only a whisper of bitterness. Very satisfying, this is a must for all porter and stout fans!"
"From a 16.9oz brown bottle. Pours a deep black in the glass, but small amounts of the liquid show it to be a clear reddish brown. The head is a light tan, frothy, thin, and dissipates pretty quickly. The smell and taste are both heavily roasted and I don't get much out of it other than that. A little too one dimensional for me."
"D:Not a session beer.I could drink 2 or 3 at a time.I will definitely purchase a case to hoard for myself during winter.I will let this warm up a bit prior to consuming the next bottle.The mouth feel is more velvety and smoother as it warms up.My first impression after the 1st taste was pairing this beer with a heavy,slightly sweet hickory pork barbeque.I'd love to find this on tap.This one is a ""gooder""."
"This beer fell short on many counts. Head flew away with no lacing. I imagine this one is artificaially carbonated as well. It was overwhelming. I pulled some perfume and herb scents out of this, and almost didnt drink it past the first sip. It grew a bit on me. Just a bit, though. medium to full body, and quite velvety for being so, let this beer afect various areas of the palate. Their oatmeal stout is better, and I would prefer it to this anytime."
"Highly drinkable, though."
"Appearance is a rich dark brown that has a creamy brown head that sticks around awhile. A primary smell of chocolate then coffee, dark fruits and sweet roasted malts. Taste is sweet with the same characteristics as the aroma with good hop flavor and carbonation. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, overall it's a rich, smooth imperial stout that will definately be on my list of brews for the cellar."
"Final Statement: Definately a winner. A good & sweet RIS from a very respectable brewery. This is my favorite of the their brews, and will definately seek out regularly."
"Pours a nice deep black color with a dark brown head. Hints of ruby red shine through at the edges when held up to the light. A pretty beer, but nothing spectacular for a stout. Very little head retention or lace. The bouquet here is special, though. Rich aroma of both dark fruits (plum, prune, raisins) and apples and bananas. Makes me think of a few weizenbocks I've had, but it's a sweeter aroma than most stouts out there, imperial or not. The taste is also a bit sweet with the aforementioned fruits. Sweet and tangy up front, with a smooth mellow middle, and a remarkably sweet (tart?) and bitter finish. Presents a smoky aftertaste, which I was not expecting but really like. Very sturdy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an imperial stout done right. But then again, this beer was winning gold medal awards at competitions back in 1896, so it's not like the lads at Sam Smiths are new at this. Keep up the good work, and thanks for this beer."
"i've drinken this from snifters, pint glasses, and (gasp!) straight from the bottle -- it's always fantastic. an obsession."
"Drinkability: A wonderful stout. I need more."
"Been meaning to review this for ages, finally have... brilliant bottled"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poures a deep brown, forming no head with very little carbonation, leaving a few spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is a mix of roasted malts, and light raisins. The taste is light coffee, a little roasted malt, and a good amount of, what tastes like raisins. Thick mouthfeel, with a smooth finish. Overall, I wasnt really impressed with this stout. I've tried a few other RIS, but this one just didnt measure up. Its not a bad beer, but for the style, It was a let down, but then again, maybe I just got a bad batch. I will have to try it again in the future."
"RERATE: Went back to this with more imperial stout experience under my belt. The apparearance is still outstanding, especially the head size, retention, and lacing. Smellwise, I'm not sure what the hell I was talking about (""buttery/funky/yeasty note""), I was probably talking about the vanilla character, which is pretty strong. The taste is smokier than most imps I've tasted, but production of this is too high for it to be barrel-aged; it must be the malts. This is really a pretty damned good imperial stout."
"Pours black with a fairly nice head that settles but sticks around as a thin lid. Lacing is slight. The smell is of chocolate, prunes,cherries, wine, and a slight roastiness.Very pleasant. The flavor is similar, with an overlay of vanilla and sweet cherries that are more predominant as it warms. Very creamy and with nice chocolate notes on the finish. Beautufully creamy body, and not all that heavy. Very drinkable,and nice to have a RIS with some delicious flavors and low abv."
"D: A tasty treat that has all of the flavor of the bigger Imperial stouts that I have tried but without the huge alcohol presence. A dangerously drinkable stout that can be enjoyed anytime of the year."
"Pours a very dark black, with a tiny amount of ruby when held to the light. Couldn't even tell the bottle was clear until after it was emptied. A nice very light tannish-brown head, hangs around for a bit. Lacing is very minimal. Smells very sweet, apples, figs, raisins and a bit of roasted coffee, overall very sweet smelling. The taste on this stout is excellent. very sweet early and as it moves further back on the tongue the malts really start to show, then it recedes to a sweet finish that leaves a nice bitter coffee aftertaste, that lingers. Has a nice full bodied feel in the mouth, good carbonation. I could definetely get used to drinking this one."
"Very drinkable, a nice slow sipper."
"I find I am grateful that this is a 7% ABV beer. It is difficult to sip this great beer - put this taste on one of those 11% ABV monsters and we'd be in trouble!"
"Drinkability: For a stout this has a smooth finish that is almost unequaled. Add that to the magnetic flavor and in my opinion you have one of the only imperial stouts you could gulp if wanted. Anyway, I find this one hard to get tired of."
"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout is a very darkens seems almost black and only when you hold it up to a bright light can you even see a hint of color, even including its head which is a light cork board color and pretty thick. It has a strong dry chocolate smell that reminds me of those whisky chocolate candies and it has a crisp taste thats kind of sweet and just a little bit bitter, but when it hits the back of your throat you can really taste the flavor in it."
"Pours black with a nice-looking three-finger head that leaves significant lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with chocolate and coffee undertones. The taste is quite sweet with chocolate and a little dark fruit dominating the palate with a bitter roasted flavor on the back end. Not an unpleasant taste, just not my favorite. Good mouthfeel and drinkability as well. This is a solid brew but not my style."
"This beer poured a thick black color with a nice tan head. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste is sweet and malty. There is a definite coffee taste in this brew. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a very drinkable beer, but perhaps a bit heavy for several in a row. I would like to say one thing  delicious!"
"A world-class beer. The best stout I've ever had."
"Drank from bottle warmed beside a campfire on a 18 degree night camping along the Blackwater River in Southeastern Virginia. Beer smelled toffee coffee like and whe I took the first hit I was glad it was in 550 ml bottle and was wishing it was a 750 ml. Beer was delicious with dark malty roasted toffee taste that when you breathed out your nose you could even tast the goodness. Goodness I will buy again."
"Another Samuel Smith treat, will be having more of this."
"Picked up a single bottle to taste test and my wife ended drinking the whole brew. So, on her behalf I will write her review of this wonderful beer. The appearance was a dark brown hue with a 4 inch frothy mocha head. The head fully lasted and left a great amount of lacing. The scent of roasted malt, caramel and mild coffee added to its complexity. Found it to start moderately sweet with a coffee and chocolate aftertaste that was right on. The medium to full body added a creamy yet slightly syrupy feel on the palate. The soft carbonation and light alcohol feel rounded out the taste and feel just perfectly. Overall, she would drink a six pack easily, although I think they come in a four pack. I do have to admit that I got a few sips in, but that was it. In the end this brew rocks and more will be coming home soon."
"Drinkability- More drinkable than most RISs. Certainly not sessionable, but hey...it ain't supposed to be. Why the heck do you think Czarist Russia fell to begin with?"
"Pours as near black as possible, a nice mocha head that left some lacing as it dissipated. The aroma is of semi-sweet chocolate. The taste is of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and prunes. The stout is lightly carbonated, smooth, and creamy. A nice sample of the style, enjoyable."
"As disappointing as all the times I've had this beer before. It's just a weak example of the style, notwithstanding Samuel Smith's historical pedigree. I might give it a try again in a year or two, but certainly won't go out of my way to seek it out."
"D- It is good just not a really big imperial stout. It is a decent brew though."
"As far as imperial stouts go this is not as strong as some others but is a very quaffable brew nonetheless."
"I thought the mouthfeel was a tad bit thin and aroma a bit weak. However, for a VERY tasty Impy stout you can't go wrong with a Sammy Smiths."
"Final - 3.35"
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout pours an opaque black with a thick tan head from a clear, foiled neck, twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is kind of fruity. The flavor is also kind of fruity, also some chocolate and roasted notes. This is an excellent beer, recommended."
"Drinkability - The beer is definitely drinkable, but its an expensive brew. I wouldn't get bored of the brew for awhile, but I would take other beers over it if money was not a factor."
"Poured into nonic, nice almost completely opaque, pitch-black body except for ruby high lights behind a lamp, with tan like off white head that lingers about a centimeter off the surface. Smells of nutty chocolate, slightly buttery, toasted malt, notes of coffee, berries, slight sweet raison, plum mix and a tiny little hint of vanilla buried under every thing else. Flavor is very complex some bitter coffee with a subtle yet enduring sweetness, rich coffee, chocolate finish not cloying, some sherried raisins and fruit. Slightly milky and oily, flavor all around, not too thick tasty stout to be savored. I find that with most RIS they demand attention to their subtlety, in order to be properly enjoyed and this is no exception. Delicious, maybe not my favorite, but absolutely worth enjoying."
"A flavorful big but not overpowering stout. Fruity and complex, but possibly not at its peak of freshness (clear bottle can't help!) Alcohol is well controlled, allowing the malt and yeast by products to shine through. Would be easy to curl up and down a few of these on a cool evening."
"PS: This is the first RIS my wife has tried that she liked as much as I did."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, small creamy tan head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, slight hops, some chocolate/toffee. The taste is sweet malty, nice chocolate/toffee, slight alcohol. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice stout, but a Imperial, not quite."
"Hell of an RIS, and easy to see why this is viewed as a benchmark for the style."
"A highly drinkable RIS, especially since it clocks in at only 7% ABV which is much less than many in this style. Good stuff."
"Looks great, smells good, and then doesnt taste like much."
"A nice brew. Strong chocolate malt profile with some decent hop balance. I could drink this beer all night. The alcohol isn't too strong and overbearing. The chocolate malts really come out. A very smooth brew that I suggest. I think that it is a little over rated on this site, but it's good nevertheless."
"Drinkability- Barely a hint of booze anywhere definately helps."
"Overall, not one of my favorite representations of the style. I realize these guys have been doing this a long time and they obviously know what they're doing but i thought this beer was just average at best. Definitley worth a try but I won't be stockpiling the cellar with it."
"Completly opaque, dark chocolatey black. Light brown whipped looking had. Pours with a lot of fizz. Aromas of charred wood, dark roasted coffee, alcohol, and some oxidation. The flavor is chocolatey and roasty and really pretty bitter. The oxidation is all threw this beer though. Really thin and watery. Compared to the its American counterpart, lifeless."
"D: Excellent drinking stout, the alcohol is covered nicely. Wonderful combonation of sweet, smokey and bitter."
"D - As I near the 1/3 point of this beer, I can't seem to get away from the plastic and soy qualities. It's not that they're monstrous, it's just that they distract from all the good points about the beer. If not for this point, the drinkability would be much greater, especially in light of the easy-to-handle 7% ABV. I've had many simply amazing Russian Imperial Stouts, and this isn't one of them."
"This was an enjoyable imperial stout that was strong enough without being overpowering as I find some IS's to be. The appearance was a nice viscous dark ebony with a frothy brown head. A strong earthy herbal quality to nose complimented the carbonation levels. The taste contained aspects of herbal cough drop flavors, mildly sweet with malts and licorice dominating the coffee undertones. A distinct alcohol kick at the end rounded out the flavors rather than trumping them. An enjoyable IS for sure, as I continue to introduce my palate to the style."
"As I poured this stout, I noticed the uniform color with a quality head. I enjoyed the robust flavor. I tasted coffee, licorice, ginger, and a hint of chocolate. I tried this on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. The finish was fairly clean. I would not recommend more than one at a sitting, as I found it filling. A quality brew from a quality brewery."
"A sweet, rich, meal-in-itself (or more appropriately, dessert-in-itself) stout. Not as roasted and coffee-dominated as some others. Definitely a once-in-a-while, after-dinner sort of thing for me. Utlimately just a little cloying for my tastes."
"Poured beer out of bottle into a pint glass, beer is very dark with a faint ruby tint, an excellent three finger head and good lacing. The smell is complex; of chocolate, rasins, and only very slightly of alcohol. The taste is equally complex, starting with a malty chocolate start that finishes hoppy and leaves a slight taste of alcohol on the palate. The mouthfeel is exceptional, a full bodied beer that is creamy with carbonation. Overall, I would have to say despite the somewhat high alcohol content this is a very drinkable beer. A must try!"
"Notes: This is a fine imperial stout, definitely one of the best. I could drink this just about every day, I think. Top notch."
"Dark, dark, opaque black-brown. Very full-bodied feel and taste. Very nice sweet roasted flavors, and very slightly sweet/tart aftertaste. I'm loving this. Expensive, but I'll probably buy it again. I really wish I had another to follow this one with."
"A good stout. I think it lacked some richness of flavor in the middle or the taste, but it is still quite good. It has a pleasant warming alcohol character that is perfect on those chilly evenings. Recommended."
"I'm no expert, but I love this beer. It's like a national treasure that you know will always be there - like the tomb of Lord Nelson (he is buried in a tomb, isn't he?). I think anyone who loves a good stout or IPA can be considered a true beer lover, even if they can't articulate why in a precise or artistic fashion. Does one have to be an art major to appreciate great scuplture or brushstrokes? Trust your senses. Sorry, this is not an ad for BA..."
"Notes: What the hell are you still doing reading this go bye the damn beer!!!"
"D: I could probably drink this morning, noon and night but I am afraid that it would loose it's luster if I had more than 2 in a row. It might be to sweet and rich for me to drink..and drink..and drink...and drink..repeat."
"D - what can I say when every sip makes you want to take another it makes it hard drink only one. This is a real treat."
"This is classic and a true legend among beers. I would suggest this to anyone. Great stuff!"
"This imperial stout doesn't rock the abv scales at a mere 7.0% which means more sessionable for me. This is one of the most drinkable Impy Stouts I have ever had the pleasure of savoring."
"The pour into my snifter raises a half-finger head (spread over a very wide surface, mind you) that quickly dissipates to a lot of light tan surface bubbles and a thin glass ring. The lacing manages to be pretty thick and entrenched. The body is truly opaque. I'd allow less head retention, if the ABV were comparable to most impys. The aroma is filled with an intense burnt caramel and molasses scent, accompanied by a blast of sweetness. The fruity vinousness is reminiscent slightly of shiraz, but also of the flavors found in chocolate over 70 percent. The taste, which I didn't get to until the glass spent some time warming, is vinous, molasses-filled, very roasted, and excellent. Sweet in the start, but leaves a coffee aftertaste, very dry. The mouth is quite thick, and the carbonation is low, but still noticeable. An easy drinking and rich impy."
"Very drinkable but not my favorite taste. I prefer the sweeter Americans. Very well done and quite complex."
"All in all, this is a British classic that shouldn't be missed. There are other styles emulated by the Americans that I feel have gone a step above this pioneer of Imperial Stouts but consider this the ""Old Guard"" of the style that should be revisited every now and again out of respect, if not for the delicious aromas and flavors."
"Poured into a stein it's easily as black as Victory's Storm King. Even held to the light it's impenetrable, like bottled tar. The nose is somewhat deceptive, as it's just fairly mild roasted malt. The palate, however, is much bolder than the nose. It's not a complex beer, with predominantly heavily roasted malt and a touch of bitter coffee shining through. The very definition of an Imperial Stout. The mouthfeel is suitably thick to match it's opaque appearance. No beer this black could be as thin as a lager. Thankfully, all the best parts of the flavor stick around as a result. It's quite an exceptional stout. Flavorful, yet no one aspect overpowers the brew. If only it weren't so filling, it would easily be a session beer based on the merits of it's flavor. Highly recommended."
"Slainte!"
"D: Great for the style. Tasty and filling, just like a good stout should be."
"D- something to savor and enjoy, very rich, excellent beer"
"Very drinkable, although the alcohol gets to be a little much or something. All around great beer, will buy this again throughout the winter."
"Overall, a very good beer. If you are a stout fan then this is one of the best."
"Another excellent showing from Samuel Smiths -- I think this is even better than their oatmeal stout."
"Already being a fan of Sam Smith products, I may be a bit biased. But this is my first encounter with the Imperial Stout and I'm greatly delighted by the discovery. I can't say enough good things about this beer. With a bit of intriguing complexity in regards to the hops, it doesn't stray too far in balancing the taste with a deep toasted malt side and this makes for an awesome combination, without sitting too heavily on the stomach. Great beer. Period."
"I walked into this bar and asked for a victory storm king stout and they didnt have it (amongst their collection of over 200 beers) so I asked for their dirtiest stout and they handed me this."
"Pours black with a nice thick head which leaves a little lace. Smell is sweet, dark roasted malts, perhaps a bit of chocolate as well. Taste is heavy roasted sweetness, coffee note, plenty of english hops. Very nice and balanced with big flavor. Simultaneously leaves a nice lingering sweetness and bitterness. Pretty thick in the mouth, creamy. A very solid stout."
"This is aggressive, yet balanced and very enjoyable (unless you're a lactic acid hater). Good beer."
"Flavor is sublime. Tastes super authentically English, and actually a less subtle version of their Oatmeal Stout. Still, this is a very subtle beer, much subtler than any I've had from this style. Very smooth in texture, yet with a surprising degree of carbonation. Round, slightly sweet malt, along with chocolate flavors. This fades to a slightly bitter burnt flavor, a bit of mineral flavor and it ends fairly dry. Impeccable. I wasn't expecting this beer to live up to its hype but it really did."
"A very enjoyable beer, especially for the winter. I like to treat this style like a brandy, tasting it in a snifter and letting it warm and swirl in my hand, which enhances the volatiles. Very well rounded and complex. Recommended."
"Huge body, very smooth and definitely drinkable. Wow."
"Drinkability is crazy...You'd never know you were drinking a 7% brew untill you feel it. It's amazingly smooth. Yeah, I belive I'll have another!"
"The head is light brown and the beer is dark black (ironic). The smell is metallic like all the other beers from this place. The first one of these I had the smell was wonderful with roasted and chocolate malts making it unbelievably good. Taste is metallic. Sadly metallic. I am sad to give this beer such a bad review."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for the type of beer it is. Superb brew in every way."
"Overall, a great complex English version of an Imperial Stout that is only somewhat disappointing in its mouhfeel"
"A top notch beer. A fantastic blend of sweet and bitter flavors with just the right amount of balancing alcohol taste. A perfect dessert beer. Enjoy it with a nice chocolate or berry dessert, or as a stand alone beer after a nice meal."
":yes:"
"Pours pitch black with a 2 finger pillowy brown head and nice lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts and molasses. Taste is excellent. First there is a mere hint of bitterness before the molasses comes through. Molasses is the dominant flavor although roasted malts are also prevalent. Dark chocolate and coffee notes are also present. Great mouthfeel. Great thick body while not being chewy. Drinkability is excellent. This is one of my favorites."
"A good sipping beer with rich flavors. One of my favorite sipping brews for those long winter sessions."
"D: The stout is very drinkable with a mid-range abv. This is a good stout for those who don't like the American over-hopped types."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is black in color with a hint red when held to a light. Its tan head was 3 fingers thick with good retention and some lacing. It smelled of roasted grain with a hint of alcohol. The taste was fantastic with rosted grain lots of malt flavor and that hint of alcohol. This medium-full bodied beer disapeared rather quickly out my glass. This is an excellent beer."
"Pours pitch black with a huge tan head that sticks all over the glass. Aroma is sweet with dark fruits, molasses and a rum like alchohol smell. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy that lets you know from the beginning that it is going to be a superb beer. Taste is roasty with coffee and bitter chocolate that finishes with a nice firm hop bitterness. Wow, this is a wonderfully crafted brew from an exceptional brewery! A masterpiece without a doubt!"
"D - It is a very good Russian Imperial. Fortunately, it isn't as strong as some others in terms of ABV."
"D - Very, very tasty brew. Filling also. A couple of these and i'm happy."
"Excellent beer to drink one at a sitting, because they are quite filling."
"Samuel Smith Imperial stout poured into a snifter, a nice dark black color with a carmel colored 1 inch head that leaves nice fat sticky lacing. Smell is of sweet dark chocloate with hints of roasted nuts. Taste is of a smooth mellow malted barley with hints of roasted nuts, very well balanced not bitterness with a hint of alchohol burn. I could drink this fine offering all day long very well balanced and goes with a nice meal, one of my favorites."
"Didn't realize the bottle was clear until I popped the cap. This is a good thing. Smell is fairly bitter and chocolaty. Poured into a glass I found at the thrift store, wide hollow stemmed wine glass type thing, 3 inches of dark brown head, subsided to about a half inch. Taste to me is incredibly complex. Red wine depths, with chocolate and coffee overtones. Little bit of hops at the back. This one is a bit syrupy for me, though, I imagine a draft might smooth her out a bit. I can't see drinking more than one of these at a time, but I really do seem to enjoy the imperials."
"One of my favorites."
"Pours jet black, with the slightest hints of deep red around the base of the glass, and builds a much larger deep tan head than I had expected, which dissipates and leaves almost no lacing fairly quickly. Smell is a bit light, with chocolate and dark fruits apparent, but a bit of an off note too, likely due to the clear bottle. How a brewery of Samuel Smith's tradition and repute could even think about clear glass is beyond me, but I digress. Taste gets back on track. Rich and full, with a heavy fruitiness containing notes of cherry, plum, and raisin coming alongside burnt chocolate and a lovely hint of brandy and port wine. The roasted bitterness in the finish goes on forever, thanks in great measure to the thick, rounded body. Drinkability is great. Top notch, without a doubt."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable stout, though a bit surprising! Best i've had so far (still many good ones to go, though!)"
"D: so so. i didn't like it so i wouldn't drink it again."
"Large clear bottle. Poured to a dark black color, with thick, pillowy tan head. Good lacing. Try as I might, I got very little aroma of any sort. Taste of a malty chocolate, with hints of caramel. Early on, the finish was slightly watery. However, this became much smoother and good at mid-bottle, and at the end, the 7.0% had kicked in just enough to make for a very good finish. While not my favorite beer, it is my favorite Samuel Smith, to date."
"I have loved this beer in the past and I wil continue to enjoy it in the future. Highly recommended."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Great finish as well. Could drink this stout all day."
"Drinkabilty: I could down a ton of this stuff and I would like to have this in my fridge always.."
"I'll definitely have this again."
"The first Imperial Stout I ever had was one of these bad boys. I have come a long way since then but this is still a beer I will revisit. Pours dark as dark can be with a slight tan head that goes rather quick. The smell is of roasted malt sweetness with just a hint fo hops. The alcohol is so hidden it might as well not exsist, but the beer is a lovely soft roastedness mocha cocoa. Very smooth and drinkable."
"Drinkability - Ha! Well, while writing this review and not paying attention to my sips, I have drank the better part of a 335 ml. It is so drinkable you have to make sure you don't suck it all down in one gulp!"
"""Imperial Stout"" was the kind of beer which was shipped to the russian nobility some 100+ years ago ... it seems that russian taste tends to go for strong bodied drinks with a certain sweetness .... most ""imperial stouts"" I know tend to accentuate the sweetness, sometimes with a ""sticky tendency"" ... compared to those this brew is ""ultra brut"" and with a medium to ""slim"" body ... but it's lack in corpulence is more than compensated with it's elegant smoothness ... to give you an image: this is like spotting a mysterious dark-haired beauty disguised in a porcelaine mask on the Carnival of Venice ... to die for"
"I still had my thick stout but there was extra flavor with the hops that gave me the blend of a fruity chocolate. This is a very well balanced imperial stout that I highly reccomend for any stout lover."
"This is one of the most interesting imperial stouts I have had. The pour is dark brown, to black with a little mocha head. Aroma is of coffee and burnt chocolate, perhaps some roasted amalt and a hint of fruitiness. The taste is sweet, hints of coffee and caramel come thorugh. Little bitter aftertaste is perfectly balanced in this brew. First impression I got when tasting this beer is that it resembled the taste of wine, with the fruity taste that is present in this beer. Quite complex. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. I would definitely recommend anyone to try this."
"Overall, this was a very nice Imperial Stout. I'm not even a fan of stouts but I could definitely drink more of these. Recommended."
"Eric"
"DA:"
"When poured, it was a very dark brown, on the verge of black, with a nice firm tan foam and very little lace. The smell of roasted malts and chocolate filled the nose on first sniff. Then when tasted, the roasted malts really came to life along with a hint of bitter chocolate. A well balance stout, not over powering on the bitterness or tartness or sweetness. Just one of the best well balanced stouts on the market!"
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout exceeded my expectations significantly. It tasted fresh, the flavors transition made my taste buds happy, and it was surprisingly easy to drink for the style. I still have about half of it left am I'm already starting to buzz a bit, but not wanting to get too faded is the only thing stopping me from gulping the rest down in the next 2 minutes."
"D = Very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"D: Overall, I don't think that this one is as quite as good as many other big stouts (Stone, Rogue, Victory, etc.), but this one is utterly enjoyable and earns points with me because of its uniqueness. Absolutely a must try."
"Drink up Johny! MK"
"pours fine. looks dark and not all that thick, but then its not all that heavy as RIS's go so i wasn't expecting a sludgy pour. nice solid head. Odor is quite fruity with plums and not-well-hidden alcohol. not a fantastic nose. Taste is fairly complex. Fruity up front with that pluminess, then it becomes more of a sweet, slightly roasted chocolate taste, followed by ... uh oh .... that peaty sourness that i dont like and i alwasys get from S.Smith. This kind of gets lost late as the drinking progresses, but its hard to ignore at first. Mouthfeel is a little thin for this type of beer i thought too. I'm a bit dissapointed overall considering the high BA rating, but oh well. maybe i just don't like the original brit version of the Russian Imperial Stout."
"Black in colout with a bit of a red tint. Medium carbonation. Aromas of stewed fruits (especially plums), licorice, and a bit of chocolate. More stewed fruit in the mouth, with some caramel and faint roasted notes becoming apparent closer to the finish. A bit of a boozy note at the end as well. Not nearly as roasty (coffee), chocolaty, or hoppy as the other Imperial stouts that Ive sampled, which is kind of a drag. I guess I prefer the North American interpretation of this style."
"Smooth easy drinking. Very rich"
"This beer is exceptionally drinkable. It's silky smooth with a slight alcohol finish. It's characteristics are god-like. Well worth the price for this one!"
"The roast tones are prominent and show thru the rich, essentially opaque color. Heads up quickly but settles just as fast (checked at about 57 degrees) Drink this at a distance from meals - each will significantly alter the taste the other. On a clean palate, the flavor is consistent and richly aromatic; the coffee hits you almost immediately, although it bitters up a bit too much for my fancy. Interestingly, I would take their oatmeal stout over this one (again, I'm a sugar hound) but the difference between the two is admittedly meager. I'd love to try it on tap!"
"Yes, I love this stuff."
"Overall: A great stout, heartily recommended."
"Never again will I go for the Guinness if this Imperial Stout is available. Very enjoyable all around, especially for a relatively low price."
"D - Im sure if this is fresh it is probably unbelieveable, but maybe this bottle is old."
"Poured an opaque black with just a bit of ruby redness peeking in. Very well carbonated with a thick, long-lasting brown head. Nose was molasses, brown sugar, and fruit with an underlying roastiness. Had a bit of alcohol as well. Full body; rich and syrupy. Molasses and roasted malts up front with a very firm bitterness below. Whiff of vanilla as well. Really, really flavorful but not for the weak-hearted! Mouthfeel was quite pleasant and all an imperial stout should be. Drinkability as well; not something that you'd drink a gallon of, but one of the tastier beers you'll find anywhere."
"Pours pitch black with a nice tan head. The lacing is incredible. Smells like dark cocoa and roasted espresso. This tastes amazing. So rich and sweet. Definitely a lactose type taste is coming through, like a milk stout. Still has the coffee and chocolate flavors, and there is also a hint of soy sauce. Carbonation is on the low side. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, yet so smooth. This would be the perfect Imperial Stout if the ABV was a little higher. Another great beer from Sam Smith!"
"Very easy drinking here...honestly, the first time I have had this one...will pickup more in the near future."
"Nose leaps out. Toss a cup of sugar onto a skillet, turn up the heat and as it burns, there's your smell. Taste is a collage of brown sugar, molasses, chocolate syrup, and cough syrup like alcohol. That cough syrup taste is what keeps this from being a 5 for taste, but that's a minor hindrance. This is a tasty brew. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. I could certainly have a couple of these, a sixer is a wise purchase!"
"I like this beer. Its creamy but light mouthfeel make it a pretty easy beer to drink. It is not overwhelming like the majority of American Russian Imperial Stouts, and I appreciate the simplicity. There is a good deal of coffee and a bit of raisins in the malt, and it is enjoyable from the front of the toungue to the back of the throat."
"Notes: An excellent stout"
"This is a highly drinkable beer."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I now see why this beer, style and company has received so much praise."
"I can't wait to sample the remaining 3 bottles from my 4-pack."
"With a medium plus body, it has a creamy as well as a tangy mouthfeel, with a pleasant warming of the alcohol ending each quaff. This stout fits the bill and it's definitely worth tasting."
"This is a typical english stout with a type of yeast I can't stand. I wouldn't reccomend this compared to the other wonderful stouts out there. Maybe on tap this is better or maybe the bottle I bought was old not sure but very dissapointed."
"I think this beer would be an excelent session beer. It is only 7% ABV, so that wouldnt be much of a problem. Also, the flavor is quite mild. I think this beer is a winner."
"Let this one warm up a bit once you pull it from the fridge. Drinking it too cold will not allow you to fully appreciate the flavors."
"Flavor tastes quite vanilla-ey, chocolate and coffee. Has hints of oak aged flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, but drinkability is high."
"Nice big, tan, foamy head. Aroma was quite sweet, malty. Taste is different than any other RIS I've had. The typical chocolate, molasses, and malt flavors. However, the flavors are more subdued that, let's say Stone RIS. This is what I'd expect from Samuel Smith's. Drinkability is prettyhigh since it's only 7% abv."
"D - high, this is a great brew, I might have a new favorite beer of ALL time, try this beer, it is awesome!"
"Drinkable in terms of not wanting this to end !"
"Pores dark mahogany with a thich tan head. Average retention with good lacing. Has the distinctive ""soy sauce"" undertone that has been brought up on the discussion board recently. Roasted amlts and Caramel aromas. Warming to drink. Fine example of an Imperial Stout."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light, prickly, and active enough to tantalize the palate for the next go-around. It works extraordinarily well with the character of the beer, and I love the fact that it's only a 7% ABV... a relatively mild RIS. Drinkability soars because of this, and points shall be awarded. Clear bottle my ass, this is great."
"This beer is worth all of the hype. Pick this one up if you get the chance."
"Maybe an older bottle, but I don't think so. I just think I don't care for the aftertaste and prefer a more complex flavor to my stouts."
"Mouthfeel- Liquid beer oil. But very smooth, just like the real thing. Although the carbonation can't be seen in this black hole of beer, you can definetly feel it on the back and sides of your tongue."
"A very nice imperial stout. Small in alcoholic strength, but has an unmatched flavor profile. Perfect for nights where you don't want to have to commit to a 22 oz. of 10%+ ABV. Samuel Smith wins again."
"All of the Imperial Stouts I've had have been American, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that an honest English version isn't as in-your-face."
"Good Stuff. Pours out to a black as night color with a strong head of about 1/4 inch. Lots of lace inside the glass, and a medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of licorice, full roasted malts, dry grains, some sweet molasses. Taste; full and robust. Flavors of cold coffee, burned malt, some hop notes are present, but pushed to the back of the flavor palate, as more malt and maple elements take control. Wow. Good mouthfeel, very rich and creamy. Like having a sweetened beer brick in your mouth. Very heavy. Pretty darn good drinkability. I'm gonna be back soon. Highly Recommended. My favorite Russian Imperial Stout."
"Well for my limited experience in Imp Stouts, I would still have to say this is very drinkable. Lots of flavor and a beautiful looking beer."
"D- So delicious you can down it like a champ, but why would you want to? One to savor and sip for a while. Alcohol does make its presence known well into the drink."
"Super dark black in color, with a huge three finger creamy tan head. The head lasts forever, leaving tons of clingy lacing. Awesome looking!!!! Smells of dark fruits, mostly prunes, roasted malts, and some rum like alcohol aroma. Complex taste of both roasted malt and hops, dark fruits, molasses. A slight smokey background, with some faint chocolate flavors. A full bodied brew, that is creamy smooth. This stout has a kinda chalky feel to it. A great example of an Imperial stout that is not overly alcoholic, and a pleasure to drink. A must try!!!"
"Drinkability: I wasn't sure about this being too overhyped, but no, it's not. Awesome drinkability, price, balance, flavor, complexity. If you like the style and haven't had this yet (and I consider myself in this camp also), then you should consider yourself silly and go get a bottle. Can't wait to stock up on this."
"mouthfeel is creamy and drinkabiliy is great. good robust stout."
"M/D - Lighter than desired of this style. Not really as chewy as it could be. The dryness and almost souring finish tend to pull this one down a bit."
"This beer was very dark with an almost reddish head. Really, I couldn't imagine a darker liquid. You can smell dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla coffee. It had a smokey bitter taste, and the dark chocolate comes back in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was great, with a nice even body; a happy mouthfeel to the end. Good drinkability too. Great stout."
"Quite drinkable."
"drinkability - very good. stays amazingly consistant throughout. starts solid and remains solid over time and temperature changes. in fact it become richer as you go along. abv is a perfect %, enough to feel a hint of warming but not enough to get you sloshed. almost a 5 for sure."
"This stout is well worth the hype and with 7% ABV you wont have to spend the night in after enjoying one."
"Note: The Samuel Smith collection of Beers is really good, but this beer has to be the best."
"I liked this beer. It was a good stout, seemed a bit too sweet towards the end but this would go good after a meal, like a dessert. While certainly not my favorite stout I would not hesitate to buy this again for a change."
"Fairly aggresive pour into my chalice produced a half inch dirty brown head that recedes to a bubbly thin covering. Minimal tracing. Oak, dried fruits, and a bit of chocolate at the end in the aroma. Flavors of bitter coffee, baker's chocolate, and raisin. Pretty bitter for a stout, sweetness isn't present at all. Bitterness gives a little tinge on the tongue at the end. The roasted maltiness dominates with little hops detected. A beautiful beer for a cold winter night, and fulfills my stout craving most definitely."
"Pours a very dark brown to black color. Thick beige head, with good retention. Some patchwork lace clings to the sides of the glass. Dark chocolate and coffee aroma, also suggestions of dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. Dark roasty flavor, and vinous. Fruityness is balanced by just enough hop bitterness. Alcohol is somewhat noticable. Medium to full body, with low carbonation. This beer is very well balanced and probably the best example of the style. Top notch!"
"This is a very drinkable beer, smooth and delicious -- the 7% ABV can catch up to you very quickly. The sweetness isn't cloying, and the bitterness and overall texture make this a pleasure to drink. Very good beer."
"It's only major flaw is that it doesn't carry a strong smell, but beyond that it's nearly perfect."
"This is the best balanced stout that I have ever had. i used to drink this beer regularly, but then was lured away by many stouts that have bolder flavors. Recently revisiting this brew makes me wonder why I have been away for so long. The stout has a very bold roasted quality with a light bitterness due to the black malts and light hopping. Has a layered cocoa, coffee, and milk flavors for added complexity. The beer, though bold and strong, is never intimidating, domineering, or aggressive. Moderately sweet with a rich and complex robustness. Properly brewed and well aged. Full and rich to the texture with a silky, creamy flow. Finishes extremely clean for such sweetness, texture, and roastedness. A slight hint of lactose sugars and a minty note adds a delicacy to the finish. A beautiful beer."
"This brew poured a jet black color with a small 1/4 inch head that lingered throughout. The aroma was of roasted malts and coffee. Taste was delicious with notes of espresso, currants, cocoa, port and Madeira. This beer is quite rich and complex for only 7% abv and it exhibits many of the qualities of much stronger Imperial Stouts. I believe this was the first RIS to be imported to the U.S. and it has always been one of my favorites. The character of this brew is still the same as when I first tried it back in the early 90's. The only criticism I've got is those damn clear bottles that Sam Smith uses. If you're going to cellar this beer, make sure you keep it away from any light source."
"Im really enjoying drinking this beer. Theres no carbonation to speak of and no head either but thats not getting me down. Im smelling rich bourbon, which I usually detest in beers, but this scent is laced with blackberries, plums, and vinous currants. Im loving it. Bitter chocolate then fills out the rich, sweet dark fruits nicely. The mouthfeel is as chewy as the color is opaqued plum. A long lingering oak barrel bitterness rounds out the thick beer nicely along with hits of chocolate and roasted, no burnt currants. Great beer and very complex. Im going to have to drink a few more bottles to search this one for all of its elements."
"Overall I would not recommend this beer. If you are looking for a good Imperial Stout, try the North Coast Brewing Co. Old Rasputin (one of my favorite all time beers) or Terrapin Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout."
"Pours black with a big creamy tan head, mostly lasting. Aroma is chocolate and hops, some alcohol as well. Flavor is sweet and mostly chocolate, kind of a robust version of youngs double chocolate stout. Low amount a bittering makes this pretty unbalanced. Body is a little light for the style. More of a sweet stout than an imperial stout."
"Poured into a pint , color is opaque black with thick tawny brown head that dissipated to a thin layer in a few minutes. Taken to the nose, complex odors of sweet dark fruit come first( hint of raisin ,plum, prune) ,dark roasted barley , some coffee , also some alcohol spirits. Great smell . Whoa! This is exellent. Taste is a complex blend of dark fruit ,roasty malt flavors of coffee , a little smokey chocolate , and some nice light hoppy notes in the finish. Very , very good! Mouthfeel is light and slick. This Russian Imperial Stout went down so easy , and a little to fast as im wishing i had some more now. It really is a top notch brew."
"Drinkability - easy, very easy to drink. A most sessionable impy by my standards."
"This stout pours a dark black with a light tan head...not as frothy as most stouts I have had. Has slight lacing as you drink it down. The smells are definitely different as aside from the coffee and chocolate one can sense a bit of vanilla and banana. The taste wasn't what I expecting as the hop bitterness seems to overpower the taste. Also not as creamy as I would like my stout to be. Overall decent but for the money one can do better."
"This is a very good beer. It has a nice creamy head on it. It is deep black. The smell is a sweet amell. The taste is kindly bitter. It also has some smokey notes to it. The moutheel is high for the style. This is the most drinkable Imperial that I have had. I really like how the alcohol is concealed. Not as up front as some other offerings of the style. Next time I want an Imperial Stout, I will reach for the Samuel Smiths."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout pours a nearly opaque black with a dark brown head. Aroma is an awesome blend of coffee and dark chocolate, after a couple swirls of the glass to remove a slight skunkiness (damn clear bottles). Taste is dark roast coffee, with some very dark chocolate and some sour fruit as well. Just a great blending of flavors. Off-dry finish with hoppy bitterness evident, but nowhere near the hop level of some new-school versions. Mouthfeel is heavy and slick but carbonation is still evident. Very drinkable, and the fact that this beer is only 7% makes it reasonable to have a couple. Just a great, classic beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve ounce clear glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The IS to which all others should be measured."
"This pours a jet black with a large foamy tan head. The smell is very fruity,prunes or raisins? The fruit smell is so strong you can miss the other more subtle aromas,coffee,vanilla,and some chocolate.The taste is a rich creamy.fruity beer.The taste of coffee or chocolate is less in this compared to other Imperials. The m/f is heavy and well balanced with a nice alcohol warmth finish. This is one of the best beers you can find,if you see it,buy it."
"D - Well, it was not difficult to finish the entire 18.7 oz. But this beer is too strong to session and it isn't refreshing enough to complement a meal properly. So it is not that drinkable in practical terms. However, it is tasty! So it is drinkable, because I want another."
"I really suggest trying this and the S.S. Oatmeal Stout side by side. They're both excellent beers, for some slightly different reasons, but with enough of the same charms (those exquisite malts) to complement one another."
"Drinkability: Perhaps the most drinkable imperial stout I've had, well balanced and with an alcohol content of only 7%. Superb."
"A smooth drink, with a substantial but not over the top body, I was more inclined to sip than gulp. I would have to say that this is now my favourite stout."
"Drinkability: A very well-balanced stout that has a defined presence that would make me choose this beer over other stouts if given a choice. Larger (550ml) serving size makes for an excellent ""sipping"" beer. I poured this beer cold from storage, however allowed it to warm to almost room temp. before sampling. In my opinion, this allowed for a more realistic environment for drinking."
"Drinkability: i couldn't down very many of these in a day, but for a casual sipping beer, this is the one i would choose. stays enticing and the complexity keeps it from getting boring, this is one of my favorite beers"
"Pours basically black. Nice and creamy medium-sized light brown head. Smells of baker's chocolate and freshly roasted malts. Mouthfeel is smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Tastes of roasted malts, baker's chocolate, and some coffee notes."
"Easily the most drinkable stout I've ever had. Lower alcohol (for the style) actually adds to the drinkability, I think. More alcohol could overpower some of the flavor and throw off the balance. As it is now, this is an exceptionally well-balanced beer."
"Beer pours a dark blackish color with a one finger tan head. Smells are roasted malt and sweet. Not overly sweet though. Hint of coffee on the back. Taste is very similar to smell. Alcohol is present but not overpowering like some other imperial stouts. Really a good beer. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I thought it would have been. Drinkability is excellent. Could definitely drink a bunch of these which is surprising for an imperial stout. Really enjoyed this beer and will definitely have it again before the winter is over. Now I will go enjoy the USC - Texas football game and drink a Harpoon IPA."
"The beer pours jet opaque black with hints of auburn. It has a foamy head that holds well and laces well. There is a subtle roasted malt smell with hints of hop bitterness. The taste is good with roasted malts balanced nicely with hops. There is excellent thickness with an even carbonation. This is overall a fantastic beer."
"Overall: Another winner from Sam Smith. Yummy."
"Slàinte!"
"Malty, malty. Chocolate, caramel and an obvious alcohol taste meets your tongue. The aftertaste is dry and chocolaty. The bottle is dated June 2004, and I picked it up in West Australia, so who knows what sort of conditions it endured during the past year and a half. Having said that, the alcohol is not hidden well at all. At ""only"" 7-percentalcohol, it tastes awfully harsh. I can think of a few 7+ percent stouts that hide the alcohol much better. It's a good beer, but not as good as I'd hoped. I'm a huge fan of Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout and hoped to be equally impressed."
"The alcohol seems to die down a bit as the beer warms. Overall, this is a superior stout."
"poured a dark black with some brown highlights and a 1in tan head that hangs around and leaves nice lacing all the way down the glass. Roasted malts in the nose with some mild chocolate. The taste is somewhat sweet..cofee...slight bitterness. A very nice full bodied mouthfeel. For a Imperial Stout this has a high drinkablility for me the alcohol isn't overpowering at all"
"Easy drinking for an impy stout and feels nice. Its a good RIS, but I find this, like I've found some of the other Sam Smith beers, to be overrated. A good beer, but one of the last RIS's I'd choose if I had a good number of choices. There is better, bolder stuff to be found at America's own craft breweries."
"my only gripe is the mouthfeel is a bit light. well, quite a bit light, like bordering on watery. otherwise, very happy with it."
"An excellent beer. Sweeter than Old Rasputin with a nice, clean finish. A nice balance of hops and malts."
" Wow, I can see why this beer is so highly rated:complex, delicious, and easy drinking."
"Black with a tan head,that did not disappear. Smell is of roasted malt with a hint of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Taste is malt and chocolate.Very smooth. Finish is rich with flavor,with just a hint of the alchol. This is a well balanced beer! Excellent!"
"One is plenty for a sitting."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very thick pouring stout, very black, with not much head that dissipates into a caramel colored ring around the glass. The smell is rich and malty, though not overpowering. It starts out with a divine sweetness yielding to a nice bitter finish. It feels very thick but has a rich smoothness and just the right amount of carbonation for a stout. Overall a good balance here. This one is a slow drinker though, very filling. Probably best with dessert."
"Full creamy mouth that retains a little oil and is very pleasant. One of the most drinkable impy stouts available in these parts. I highly recommend this one."
"Great for a beer, good for the style. I picked this one up at a nice local beer pub in Belmont, NC post-Pop the Cap. The alcohol was not noticeable and the appearnce was very typical -- very dark, creamy with no head or carbonation. The Stone one I had of this style just seemed to be a above and beyond this one. Not overpowering and a nice one for those new to the style. A biton the pricey side ($5.25 a bottle)."
"Quite a nice stout. Pours to a deep black with a tan puffy head. Smell has hints of essence of wine, fading to hints of caramel and smoke. Taste is excellent, the roasted malts make their presence known in this fine creation with strong caramel presence. This is slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it makes it difficult to drink, in fact it's quite smooth. Very drinkable. I hope there are more of these at the local liquor store next time I visit."
"Wow - what a great Imperial Stout this is. Pours a black-as-night body with a tan, foamy head that's as thick as shaving cream. Smell is of raisins, currants, and a slight note of alcohol, which is actually well-hidden. Taste is deep and sweet but not overpoweringly so. Finishes sourly, which is standard with Imperial Stouts. With a low ABV of 7.0 and the fantastic smoothness, this is more than your typical ""one-and-done"" Imperial Stouts..."
"D: Highly flavorful and complex with deep, dark secrets. A beer that I'd only venture once a night, but that is worthy of drinking during many winter nights."
"Drinkability: After one of these I'm done for the night--too full for more."
"The appearance of this imperial stout is one of the best I've seen. The color is pitch black. Head is large, creamy, and dark tan. Retention is great. The aroma has an inviting mixture of toffee, chocolate, and dark fruit smells. I just wish the aroma was a bit stronger. The taste starts with a strong chocolate flavor with edges of toffee. Dark fruit flavors mix in nicely along with a bit of alcohol flavor. A slight butteriness is noted, especially near the finish. The sweet finish is especially long-lasting. Without a doubt this beer has a excellent mix of flavors that are layered nicely, but when compared to the bigger American imperial stouts, this falls a little short of exceptional. Still, this is highly recommended."
"This poured very dark, almost black and somewhat watery. It had a very small head which went away almost immediately. The aroma was unmistakably stout-sih; very roasted hints of malt and coffee, possibly chocolate, dark fruits. It immediately hit me with bitterness in the taste, with plenty of maltiness and caramel flavor. It had a lasting chocolate/coffee bean aftertaste which was pleasant, but left something ot be desired. It had a bitter and watery mouthfeel. I'm going to go against the grain on this one and disagree with the monumental praise this had gotten. A good beer, but not outstanding."
"Cheers!"
"Well... the bottle didn't last me very long. Goes down a little too easy maybe... :P"
"550 mL clear bottle. Black with faint chocolate highlights. Creamy, finely attenuated tan head that soon becomes a mere cap. Aromas of chocolate, fruity cough syrup, smoky raisins and toffee. Taste is of hops, at first, then smooth chocolate and coffee bliss. Surprising bit of boozines for only 7%. Cherry cordials. Slightly buttery but mostly spicy bitter finish. Mineral aftertaste. Not bad at all. As it warms, the flavors balance out more. Definitely a standard-bearer of taste, but not quite the heaven in a bottle I was expecting. Incredible mouthfeel, however: tingly, slick and oily and an eminently downable medium-to-thin body. Low ABV (for the style) + totally mesmerizing sipping = super high drinkability. Absolute pioneer for the style and deserves much credit for that alone."
"Overall its a good brew, not great for a RIS, but very drinkable."
"I thoroughly recommend this beer!"
"D- This beer has nice big dark flavors but the secondary flavors were a bit strange with banana and bread seemed to take over. I would have liked some more malt complexity and maybe a bit more alcohol or hops to balance out this big beer."
"D: In terms of a Russian Imperial Stout, this is where it's at."
"Go. Now..and enjoi"
"This beer pours pitch black, and leaves a thick tan head that stick to the sides of the glass. The smell is chocolate, toffee, alcohal but not overpowering, and a very faint plum essence. The taste is very smooth....it has a great hoppy finish and starts with a bittersweet chocolate vinos taste on the palate. This beer is very good one that I will frequent for many times to come."
"Smooth, easy to drink, and hearty. Anyone who likes Imperial Stouts must try this one. Recommended."
"A fantastic offering from the brewers across the pond. A nice sipper on a late fall New England evening."
"Being a lover of all stouts I was excited to try this offering, considered one of the best. Upon pouring I wasn't dissapointed... a deep brown bordering on black with a thick healthy looking head which I had to take action on before it overflowed. Head stuck around nicely, very thick and heavy head with a chewy texture. Smell was delightful with all the traditional coffee and chocolate notes one could ask for. smooth mouthfeel with flavors that change every second on your toungue, transitioning from chocolate milk to mocha to coffee and leaving your mouth with a great nutty aftertaste which invites you to drink more. The only real detractor for me was the mouthfeel which struck me as a little watery with a bit too much carbonation than I would like in my perfect stout, nonetheless one of my favorites."
"A decent imp stout, and that's about it."
"I feel this a classic example of a no frills double stout. There aren't any additional flavors to distract from the experience. I will definitely drink more of this brew."
"Probably gets less respect these days becuase of much more potent Imperial Stouts & doubles out there, but pretty dang tasty to me."
"Yuck. I tried drinking this slowly to pick out all of the flavors. I tried gulping it and also I tried letting my mind wander so I could surprise myself with a sip. Either way, this was just not an enjoyable beer. Ive found a lot of British stouts to be a bit sour, but this is down right un-pleasant. This tastes more like a porter or brown ale, so based off of rating by style, this beer misses the mark."
"I love Stouts and this is exceptional. A few of these could sneak up on you. Proceed with caution and thirst. Better than Guinnes but I rate Guinnes higher due to bloodlines and possible visit from dead Grandmother."
"I actually tried this beer only because it had a high rating on Beer Advocate. Massive props to BA for steering me towards this amazing brew!"
"This brew pours a magnificent black color. The two finger head is creamy and light tan in color. The lacing is thorough. The aroma screams of chocolate and cream. The taste is light for a imperial stout, but still great. Chocolate, cream, and more chocolate. The mouthfeel is slighly lighter than full bodied, and the carbonation is ample. Overall, this is a great brew."
"This one was a very good beer, but I prefer it too be a little more sweet and more burned."
"This is just outstanding. Wonderful special occasion beer, I'd say. Don't pass it up."
"I could drink quite a few of these at once, this beer is so delicious and not over-powering. This is one of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever had."
"poured beautifully with a 3 finger head that left an awesome lace across the top of the beer. it is darker than dark with no light coming through. it smells of chocolate and a bit of plum aromas. the taste is lightly sweet and almost some qualities of a good red wine with notions of an earthy taste that also leaves a nice feeling on the pallet. i thoroughly enjoyed this beer. i would recommend to everyone. A+"
"Appearance is more or less totally black, with rather dark head like coffee with just a little cream. Initially I got a lot of chocolate out of the nose, but it expanded into dark fruits and slight alcohol scents. The taste definitely has some fruit in it, with raisins mostly, and also complex and bitter roasted malts. It has a rich and velvety feel, with just enough carbonation to keep it from being oily. This has a high drinkablity, with only 7%, but is certainly flavorful enough to be satisfying."
"Overall: What a great beer. Definitely falls into the ""great"" category for me. Every aspect of this stout is so smooth and well crafted and rich in flavor it's easy to get lost in. From opening the bottle to finishing the pint flavors and aromas change some as well making the experience even better."
"I've updated this review as I have had more of this wonderful beer: rather strange that I now don't think it goes well with chocolate [like most stouts]. When I had it last night I was yearning for a really good hamburger. Strange."
"Very drinkable for an impy stout... only 7% and you can certainly enjoy a few of these before you start embarrassing yourself."
"Opinion: Now this is different among Imperial Stoutsespecially coming in at a paltry 7% ABV. You cant put this beer beside Great Divides Yeti, or Stones Russian Imperial, and expect the same beer, even though all three are on the top 100 at this time. This one depends almost entirely on its depth of malt to give it flavor, while the American varieties have a lot of hops to obscure the actual effect of the roast malts. This is a fabulous beer, but is a little different than its American cousins."
"Drinkability was very good... but I think the flavor was so strong it would limit me in how much of this I could consume before being burnt out. One bottle was enough at one sitting, I was ready for lighter fare."
"I didn't realize that the bottle was clear until I poured it. Pours straight black with a good tan head that leaves a good lacing. Smell is somewhat sweet with roasted chocolate and coffee. Taste is incredible. Strong roasted creaminess with bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol taste is very well hidden and has a sweetness to it. Slightly woody finish. Creamy and rich feel and I loved drinking it and wanted more. Perhaps this is my favorite stout."
"Considering this beer is is an imperial stout its very well balanced and hides its 7 % alcohol content almost too well. Its incredibley smooth, creamy, and has a very rich sweet nutty taste up front. A slight chocolate flavor is also present. The aftertaste is just barely less creamy with a warming character. Mouthfeel is heavy and slightly sticky and fits the rest of its characteristics. Great beer."
"The beer poured a straight black with a thick, 1"" of tan colored head. The aroma was of coffee, chocalate and some dark, hinting fruitiness. The flavor began with roasted flavors and finishes with a very nice hop bitterness along with the alcohol bite there as well. Sammy's Imperial Stout is a full bodied brew with a creamy texture, but it's incredibly drinkable with a very nice, complex taste. This is one beer whose reputation has well preceded its drinking. Highly drinkable and a true pleasure."
"overall: i've had this once before and didn't like it very much. at least not nearly as much as others. i've never had it since thinkin' i'd try it again later when my palate's more experienced, and what can i say? i'm still not a fan. i don't like wine very much and the very first flavor i get is wine. it's also a tad thin, even coming from england. a must try as this is a classic, but i'm one of the few who won't be rating this very high."
"Always a good choice. One I have had many times. Worth it, in case you were wondering about the price. It was my introduction to imperial stouts and is a high benchmark. I think of it as a sophisticate in the company of its brash American counterparts (Thirsty Dog, Stone, Bells ... brash is good). Quality, quality, quality. Try some."
"The bit of alcohol warmth makes this a great cool weather drink. No wonder the Russians liked this stuff."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam! I have drank many stouts over the last several days. This is not the most expensive or the most elusive stout on the market. It is simply the best of the bunch I have had the pleasure of drinking. Very drinkable very smooth."
"Tastes like strong chewy molasses with alcohol and chocolate raisins. I like this one a lot, it's up there with the Porter but not quite."
"This brew is pitch black. The head is a creamy tan color and is very sticky. There is a rich chocolate and coffee aroma. Hints of fruit and alcohol. The flavor is rich and intense. Dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, and leafy hops. Full bodied and a sweet finish with some coffee flavors lingering on the tongue. Hands down one of the best stouts I have ever had. $3.99 a bottle but well worth the price."
"Pours black, and totally opaque. A light brown one finger head shows some decent retention but the lacing is pretty lame. Burnt chocolate nose, some alcohol vapors present, and background hops. Huge roasted flavor, nicely blended with bakers chocolate, and a mild vinous character. The bitter and sweet flavors are prduced by the malt, and there is some residual sweeteness, but the drying hop aftertaste helps keep the taste somewhat balanced. A thick, chewy body rounds out the mouthfeel, and the full malt profile hides the alcohol while accentuating the flavors making this beer strong, but very drinkable."
"d - not as good as the oatmeal stout. that's probablly the most important thing to note. if you've never had either go with the other one first then try this. it's definately a good winter beer. went great with some chocolate chip cookies!"
"Opaque black color with huge, fluffy, coffee-colored head, creamy-looking. Smell is lots of coffee, also chocolate, dark fruit, some booze if you get real close, raisins, plum, prunes. Taste is super bitter, with bitter chocolate (roasty!) and earthy hops. Smooth and light on the palate, with a quick dry finish. Bitter, but appetizing. Yum. Good with chocolate."
"This a fine stout. A rich and flavorful beer that isn't as brash as it's American counterparts, but doesn't lack complexity. As far as the aroma, I know I sense skunky esters in lower levels than most people do. It did affect my rating, but didn't detract from my enjoyment. (much) This is still a beer worth experiencing."
"The finish is long and satisfying, and the unusual and seemingly disparate flavors combine into a lovely package."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start, and mildly crisp at the finish. Finish is also rather short in the aftertaste, as the flavors disappear from the tongue quickly. Superb drinkability."
"Pours midnight black with a creamy caramel head. Nose is strong on the Juan Valdez up front with a backbone of porter grain and blackberry yogurt. Taste stays with the roasted coffee ground, bittersweet Hershey's and dark sour berries. Mouthfeel of carbonated crude oil, thick and syrupy. This is a meal of an RIS. The flavors don't always mesh - the sour fruit gets a little cloying at times - but overall a tasty stout. On the light side as far as abv for the style, but has plenty of flavor to compensate."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a brew that had always been the epitome of beers before the craft beer revolution took hold. Cervino's in Ridgewood NJ carried it and it was so pricey that I was at first reluctant to buy it. Today many craft brews are more expensive and some are tastier, but Sam's was always there. The beer is gorgeous midnite black, it is fruity, roasty and has a rich creamy head. Notes of cocoa and cider and coffee. A rich and tasty brew that is perfect to end the day on. Cheers."
"A deep, dark, delicious stout. Damn thats a good beer."
"Overall, I was dissapointed. I had high expectations, maybe too high. A very good beer though."
"My first experience with this one, it's an instant classic. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is that it appears to be very difficult to find in the big bottles, as well as generally harder to find than the rest of Sam Smith's line. Never fear, I will make the necessary trip to the stores that I know carry it."
"As a teacher, I would give this an A+."
"Give me more."
"D - Goes down nice and easy. Definitely a sipper, but one I could enjoy a few of after a long day."
"$2.99 for a 550ml bottle"
"Taste is malts at first, followed by chocolate and coffee, and finishes just a little bit bitter. Mouthfeel was kind of oily, which seemed to throw of the flavor some. Not sure if it was just this bottle, but it was still good enough that I'll give it another try sometime."
"Was I ever wrong!!! This is an amazing beer. No wonder the top ratings it has received. It reminded me how much I missed drinking stouts and this was far and away the best stout I have ever had. Excellent flavor. Easy to to drink and I nice level of alcohol. I am not surprise it did not spoil in my fridge. I'll be stocking up on more for the winter."
"poured a very deep copper-brown, almost black color with an attractive tannish head that fell to a beautiful tan collar around the top of the beer. Smell is magnificiently complex with a mixture of coffee, dark fruits (prunes, plums, raisins, figs), molasses, maple syrup, and toasted malts noted. First taste is a bit overpowering, with strong notes of alcohol present. Subsequent sips bring forth strong chocolate notes mixed with a nice bitterness.The aroma a each sip is truly fantastic. Finished nice and creamy with a strong bitter note present. I enjoyed the beer, but to me it is something to try on special occasions. The strong aroma and taste can begin to get a bit overpowering."
"Pours a dark black that is only slightly transluscent, with a thick tan head that retains very well, imposing looking stout. Aroma is dominated by sweet and roasty scents; chocolate, coffee, vanilla, heavy cream, and some roasted scents. Taste has big chocolate and roasted flavors, with some coffee, cream, plum, floral hops, blackstrap molasses and some alcohol notes. The hops really help to balance out the sweetness and help make this stout very drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and a lightly bitter, astringent finish. Drinkability is very good and the alcohol is only slightly noticeable. Enjoyable imperial stout that you could actually drink more than one of and not be falling out of your chair."
"As far as Imperial Stouts go, this has got to be one of the most drinkable. Every aroma is matched in taste and everything is so well balanced so as to accent everything else. The moderate alcohol content makes it easy to finish and despite its body, still very easy to drink. The perfect end to any meal, and one I will not keep my fridge without."
"Wow this brew is awesome.... I neglected english brews for years because of one bad experience and it was a huge mistake. pours a beautiful alley night black. charcoal head that retains and fades to a half finger chunk. syrupy mouthfeel with just a touch of zing that balances it out and leaves the mouth perfect for another drink (to me this is rare in a big imperial). yeasty chocolate/caramel/ doubled up....I love this beer."
"Pours almost black, though somewhat lucid. Nice tan head which reduces to a color with some slightly lacing. Smell is of butterscotch and chocolate. Taste upfront is sweet diacetyl butterscotch and chocolate, then some light roastiness kicks in and then fades to a slight hop, chocolate finish. Overall the body is medium at best and carbonation too. The overall effect is nice, but i'd prefer this to be a little stiffer. Overall very enjoyable. Alcohol is nonexistent."
"Tried pairing part of the bottle with a chocolate hazelnut ice cream, as others suggested that chocolate would go well with this. The sweetness of the desert overwhelmed some of spicy flavors. While the pairing did not offend, I think the brew did better on it's own."
"Taste is a little sharp - a bit astringent. Lots of bitter malts, chocolate, charcoal, and maybe some figs in the back. Drinkability was fine - the alcohol was hidden well and the carbonation was perfect. Excellent beer from Samuel Smith."
"Taste is incredible. Very smooth... chocolate, dark fruits, just the right amount of maltiness. Carbonated just right. Feels full-bodied. I can't get over how drinkable this one was. Very little could be done to improve. Give me more."
"Poured deep black almost opaque. Aroma of berries. Taste is sharp, tart, and fruity right off the bat. The beer has hints of cherries, chocolate, and vanilla. Lighter on the palate than most of the American stouts I have tasted lately. This beer drinks easy and smooth with a long pleasant finish. A good brew from Sammy Smith."
"Complex. Rich. A masterpiece."
"This is an amazingly drinkable imperial stout. I haven't had this beer in a very long time and I find it even better than I remember it. All-around goodness. Low alcohol so you can have a few in one sitting, and it's as complex and satisfying as just about any 9%+ imperial stout."
"drinkability: goes down easy"
"Notes: Sole US distributor - Merchant du Vin"
" The finish is dry. The mouthfeel is huge, and there is an uncanny perfect amount of carbonation here. It holds the stout together and provides vast drinkability. Any less carbonation would change the whole texture, any more would contradict the style. As for this huge beer, there is still supreme drinkability, and even if Imperial Stouts are not on your menu- this is a must try. I wouldnt pair this with any weak foods, no mild cheese and crackers or fish and chips. This one deserves a porterhouse, or rather, a steak and kidney pie?"
"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) and consumed about a week later (July 2005). Pours a one-finger almond brown head over a pitch black liquid. A little bit of dark rbuy red edging when held to light. Smells cherry sour, roast, and underlying caramel. Tastes delicious...oh my! Chocolate, roast, sour, caramel, currant, raisin, blueberry, prune. Imagine a dense chocolate raisin rum cake, the weight of which has a buttery brown sugar syrup almost tearing out the sides, but nothing quite collects on the plate. Some beers flash a certain flavor before it bows and leaves the stage for some other flavor to shine in the spotlight. Not this beer...this beer holds each flavor throughout the taste. Each rising and mixing with other flavors and never quite going away before merging with some other flavor. A delight to pull each draw and ponder each aftertaste. No gulp is a repeat of a previous..there's alot going on and I seem to focus on different wonderful qualities during each taste. Plus, a wonderfully thick smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is mild and tinkers the thick hanging on my tongue. I think this helps some flavors remain fruity and pleasant so that the beer isn't overly heavy. Lacing on the inside of the glass defines the level the liquid sat after each gulp. There is still a thinlayer of head on top of the beer. What an amazing selection."
"Mouthfeel is decent, but actually a slight bit on the thin side."
"500 mL bottle with no freshness date - served slightly chilled in a goblet. Pours an inky black with slight red tinges when held to the light and it's topped with a 1/4"" brown head that is fizzy and leaves little lacing but never completely goes away. The aroma consists of green apples that are sour/tart, chocolate, coffee, anise, some dark fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is identical but with some green hops and a nice bitterness from the hops and roasted malts. The body is medium to full with a medium carbonation and the drinkability is high for an imperial stout. Delicious. Paired well with chocolate cream oreos."
"Appearance is absolute black, with a massive head of coffee colored foam that clings to the glass forever. Aroma has a smorgasbord of fruits, lactose, molasses, chocolate, black coffee and ethanol. Initial taste is incredibly complex! There is so much going on! It tastes like the best Starbucks macchiato with caramel; plus citrus/floral hops, smoke, chocolate, dried fruit, and Lord knows what else! I think I will just savor the experience."
"Others have gone into great detail as to all that can be found in this bubbly black nectar so I'll just chime in with- if you are jonesing for a stout this will set you at ease and leave you with a smile on your face."
"I'm not sure I've rated a beer a 2.0 before but ""not impressed"" is exactly how I'd describe my experience. I'm a big fan of Samuel Smith's brewery and adore their oatmeal stout so I'm very surprised at how unexciting this brew is. It's heavy bodied and high in alcohol but I was hoping for something more..."
"12 ounce bottle. I purchased this one at George & Sid's in Bristol, VA."
"Overall  Another excellent brew from Samuel Smith a fine imperial stout.."
"Sam Smith's I.S. is smooth and creamy with a nice mellow, long, sweet aftertaste. A fine English Imperial Stout."
"12 ounce clear bottle, Pours deepest of mahogony, ruby highlights at the edges. Active expresso froth colored head, showing good retentive powers. This one leaves blotchy thick and sticky lacing. Nose is coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol and dark malts. Heady, strong, flavorful Impy stout. Notes of more chocolate, lots of burnt coffee, vanilla, burnt fruits and grains, smoke. Bold flavors, but still somewhat subdued and subtle, basically this is still British style and its not over the top. World class sipper. A must for stout lovers"
"Drinkability is very good on one of the truly great stouts out there."
"Drinkability: A very good stout. Probably the best offering from Samuel Smith and one of the best Imperial Stouts available. I look forward to this beer in all types of weather summer or winter."
"Entry is quiet, with barely perceptable carbonation and an instantanious roasted malt chewiness. Midtaste drops an earthy malt bomb on the back of the tongue along with plenty of carmalized sugar. The finish begins at the peak of malt flavor and is escorted by some bery nice hops. Roasted malts play tag with the yeast during the fade, which is long and slow."
"This is a heavy brew. Not something I want to sip or drink all night. But an enjoyable sample. I have to admit I like a lighter stout."
"This beer pours a cola brown color with a thick, tan head. It smells of honey and burnt chocolate with syrup and something that reminds me of...tree bark. All of these smells are revealed in a very complex taste. I also found something spicy in the taste. It fades nicely into a brown sugar taste. This is a VERY good beer. I'd definitely recommend it!"
"A pleasure to drink and a great and classic example of the style."
"What do I got to do to inspire all my fellow BAs to try this fabulous beer ?? Please ??"
"I hope I can find this beer on tap someday."
"Thank you Merchant du Vin."
"Man, this company makes some great brews. Seems as though I discover a brewery and then have to try each of their beers. Sammy Smith has been that brewery recently, along with Fantome. Both great in different ways. This is one of the beers (among several) in their lineup that will now be a permanent part of my ""beer rotation."" Appears a staunch black color, letting in no light. Smells and tastes are super complex. Lots of different angles coming at me here. First there's a dark fruity component, dried cherries and currants. There's also a nice roasted malt in there and actually a bit of spicy hops that I can definately taste. More odd stuff: milky tones, dust, and a leathery character, like sticking your face in a baseball glove that's been sitting in the sun all day. This beer is almost ""funky"" in the way that a farmhouse ale might be described, though with out the sour. Really amazing tastes here, very complex once again. Slick warm mouthfeel and the surprises behind every sip make this one a real pleasure to drink. Cheers to Sammy, whoever he may be."
"Overall Impression: This is one of my standby favorites. Rich yet drinkable, dark yet refreshing, a great session beer, but the 7% will make it a lively or short session. I think this stands up better in the old Imperial Stout category rather than the Russian Imperial Stout category. It is a bit more refined, a bit less charred or tarred. Im surprised I hadnt reviewed this yet. I think I was saving it for a special occasion. It turned out it was a Early Monday Morning occasion (1am)."
"Certainly a worthy representation of the style, but my money's on Stone's version, thank you."
"Drinkability. Drank two 18 oz.ers tonight. DAMN."
"Quite drinkable, despite the 7% abv. I could have two or three of these as a dessert if I could get them easily."
"Pours a clear brown that is so dark that is nearly black, with mahogany tinges at its edges. Two finger tall brown head that smells of pure milk chocolate, some black licorice. Sharp taste is more of bitter dark chocolate, roasted nuts and dark fruits. Full bodied, finishes dry, with lingering flavor of bitter roasted coffee and alcohol. Light carbonation lends a certain smoothness and elegance its heavy weight. A nearly perfect classic that I hope they never alter."
"I poured this single into a Stone Imperial Stout snifter. The dark dark brown mass of liquid supported a one inch tan colored head. It smelled sweet and dark malts, dark chocolate and a bit of ground coffee, but overall the aroma wasn't on par with some of the other double/imperial stouts I've tried. Tasted malty, again on the sweet side. Chocolate and coffee flavors are present backed by some hop bitterness, and it all concludes with a warm finish (the 7% right there). It is medium bodied and on the lower than average on the carbonation scale. Overall a very nice beer that stout lovers will go back to time and time again."
"What a nice beer."
"The complexity and fun of drinking this pulled my mind from taking notes. I must revisit this Imperial greatness."
"Drinkability and Overall: While this is a wonderful tasting beer, 1 or 2 and you're done. The flavor is too strong and too potent to make it a very drinkable beer. This is a solid, fun to drink stout, but I'd recommend Bell's Expidition Stout over this one."
"Tried it again, and yeah, now I understand the Impys. Great brew that would go well on a cool evening, while watching football."
"Excellent imperial stout, one of the best Ive ever had."
"wow this tastes foul. it tastes like a suitcase that was left in the basement for years. then the basement was flooded, and the leather buckled and grew mildew in the cracks. i hate to say it, but this is going right down ye olde tadcaster draine."
"355 ml bottle. This beer pours out an impenetrable black color with a dark brown head. The aroma in incredibly complex: toffee, molasses, grapes, chocolate, plums, and more. Bitter chocolate flavor. Slightly tangy raison flavor. Noticable alcohol. This beer has a great, complex flavor. Be sure to let it warm up some if you're drinking this refrigerated, because some of the flavors really start coming out as it warms. Highly recommended"
"All in all a delicious stout that is worth the price of admission. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Great, uniquely made imperial stout. Well crafted."
"Pours a nice black. Rather clear, not too thick. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Tastes sweet, not too sweet, but just right. Chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some hints of fig make for a delightful beer. Overall this is a tasty brew. I have had some imperial stouts where I couldnt finish the last couple sips. I enjoyed this beer to the last sip."
"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a benchmark beer for me, the one I compare all other I S's to. Say thankya!"
"I enjoyed this Imperial Stout, but I don't think I will revisit as long as I have access to the Rogue Imperial Stout, which IMO is no contest with this. I've heard this is more subdued than its American counterparts, but on behalf of the smoked flavor, I would beg to differ that the Stone RIS or Rogue Imperial Stout are a little less complex in flavor though richer in character and body. Definitely worth a try though."
"Bottle: Poured a opaque black beer with a medium dark brown head with minimal retention. Aroma is quite incredible and consists of pure black chocolate, roasted malt and some coffee. Taste is also quite a treat with the chocolate hitting first (without too much sweetness) and followed by the roasted malt and coffee to finish the whole thing. Very well balance with limited bitterness, which probably makes it one truly good dessert beer. Wow!!!"
"i was really disapointed in this beer until it was room temp."
"Drinkability: I've come around to this one over time and have re-reviewed this while maintaining the original review date; I now appreciate the complexity and restraint in this version compared to the production of some of the American craft brewers"
"This is one fine, fine, brew."
"Deep black in color. Respectable tan head on top. Huge roasted aroma-a mix of burnt currants and a slight sherry aroma. Very vinuous. You can almost smell the velvety feel it has to it. Great big roasted malt flavor. Wonderful flavors all rolled into one-coffee,anise,dark chocolate. Theres an ""ink"" flavor that I find in some imperials and just love-this is full of that. Good body-not as full as some of the others but it plays well considering the overall flavor and texture of the beer. A highly drinkable brew-at an easy going 7% this could go on all night. A truely classic example."
"Note: This beer tastes much better as it warms. The flavors become more balanced at higher temperatures."
"I'm not a big stout drinker, but I have to admire the artistry that went into this superb beer. Beautiful and incredibly toothsome."
"Sam Smith products tend not to impress me much, but this beer is very good. However, I get a sense of polish on this brew that somehow comes across as being ""over-produced"" like a pop album. Perhaps it is because no flavors stick out much - there are no rough edges. When I want an imperial stout, I want the beer to take chances and be a little bolder. This is a nice, smooth brew that I will remember as a stronger sweet stout with very blended, subtle flavors."
"I had this stout with porc ribs + ""see dick burn"" hot sauce. (hotsaucezone.com) Good match but a little harsh on the heartburn front."
"Pours out a nice dark beer with tan head,very nice.Aroma of licorice slight alcohol smell not bad.Taste up front is nice ,balanced ,but the lingering bitter afterwards sucks. I had high hopes for this beer and other sam smith beers but now im not quite sure.Nice slick mouthfeel though the taste killed the drinkability of this beer."
"Pours pitch black, with a dense brown head, and sticky lacing. Aroma of prunes, cocoa, burnt coffee, wood and alcohol. Taste is tremendously complex. Roasted, coffee, chocolate notes, raisins, bitterness, touch of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Definitely one to be sipped and enjoyed after a meal."
"This might be the best deal at my local store: $2.99 for a 550ml bottle. WOW."
"Mouthfeel is slick and oily with this young sample, but not at all motor-oil viscous like the modern wave of Imperial stouts. Softly chewable. Addictive. Destructive. Art in a bottle."
"One of the most beautiful beers seen. Pure, dark black colour. Even when shone through the light, it's black. No hints of other colours whatsoever. Only other thing darker than this is my ex girlfriends soul. But this is a thing of beauty, hers is a thing of disgust. Two finger, fluffy head the colour of Bailey's irish cream. Very little lace. Smells of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, coffee beans, lactose sweetness, and dark fruits. Taste is roasty and bittersweet. First sip is burnt malt, bitter chocolate and bitter hops. Then, after awhile, it mellows out to a nice sweet flavour. Bread, milk, tobacco and fruits, with an almost smokey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy. I like it. I'll be buying this again. A lovely sipping beer. Not a quaffer. Guzzling this beer is a crime."
"Drinkability- I need to try this one again. I drank it right after an extra hoppy barleywine and my buds may have been off. But for what I did taste it was better than average and I am looking forward to trying it again."
"This beer pours a nice dark black with a half-inch glorious tan head. Aroma was the same as the taste. To me, the alcohol was present but pleasant. It also offered a sweet flavor upfront, finishing with deep flavors of chocolate. The mouthfeel was desirable and because of the subdued alcohol it was surprisingly easy to drink. In its drinkability it differed from most other Imperials, as I could definitely drink a few. Samuel Smith's second best beer. It is second only to the Oatmeal Stoudt."
"Pours out a thick, black color with a nice fluffy almond colored head. Head retention was decent, settling to a thin layer across the top within a few minutes. Little to no lacing left behind. The aroma is that of extremely sweet honey and/or molasses, roasted barley, and hints of chocolate and coffee. Also present is the smell of warming alcohol. The flavors mimic the scents as expected: sweet malts and syrups with a nice warming alcohol kick. On top of this, there is a slight carbonation that thins the mix just enough for easy consumption. An easy bitterness finishes off all the sweetness leaving a semi-dry finish. Overall, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect from the style: thick and full bodied. Drinkability of this excellent offering is quite high in my book. A definite winner from a well respected brewery... give it a shot!"
"Goes down smooth."
"Was really looking forward to trying this one. Poured from a 550 ml bottle, very black with a light beige head and minimal lacing. Smells very sweet and malty with a heavy alcohol presence. Tastes like it smells, heavy, thick and sweet with alcohol and a bitter finish. Very thick and chewy. I enjoyed this one, but I found it very sweet so the drinkability was knocked down some. Recommended though."
"Drinkability is great. Alcoholic and warming punch is much greater than the 7.0 ABV listed. I spent a year in England in college and by the end of that year SS Imp was on my top 2 beers. This brought some crazy memories and great taste."
"A very, very good beer. I think a little too heavy and flavorful to be very drinkable, but I think I'll keep one of these in my frig from now on."
"Poured an almost black with a foamy tan head. Smell was huge, with roasted malt, burnt toast, dark chocolate, hints of alcohol, I could smell this all day. Taste was almost unbeliveable, with black licorice, dark fruit, dark chocolate, roated malts, very complex, so many flavours, a little over-whelming though. Mouthfeel was like velvet. I had no idea a stout could be this good."
"1/2 liter clear bottle: poured in beautiful black color with garnet hues when held to a light...marvelous 2 finger mocha frothy meringue head. aromas of coffee-cocoa-dates-sweet anise...the anticipation is running wild at this point. Taste...where to start?...very complex start without a sharp edge ...near complex layered stout perfection...molassass-licorice-espresso-cocoa-burnt treacle all these flavors in a milk body that slowly give way to a slight hop drying in the long finish. One of the best Imp-stouts Ive tasted ...needs little finishing in a cellar. its very mellow and complex and flavourful when fresh. Highly recommended....I will be cellaring a case this winter for sure."
"Clear 550 mL bottle with best before date stamped on the foil on the bottle neck."
"Notes: Not heavy in alcohol content or body which makes it an easy stout to drink."
"The beer pours a rich extremely dark brown that gives off hints of ruby, it developed a fine camel head. The aroma was a tantilizing mix of tanin, malt, and yeast. There were two main tastes up front was a tart malt then it develops to a toasted malt finish. All with an undercurrent of black cherry. The feel was medium and creamy. This stout was a pleasure to drink. The taste built throughout the pint. Another great beer from Samuel Smith."
"Head retention to the fullest! For an imperial stout that is. High above the rim of my glass. Smell is huge, lots of cherries and stuff. Taste runs deep into my soul. Dates, currants and all that jazz. What ever the heck's going on its bad ass. Like a mouth full of tar. Thanks to the low, for an imperial stout, ABV this can be drunk in excess."
"A personal favorite beer and one of the best Imperial stouts out there. Recommended."
"Roasted malt, dark fruits, coffee and chocolate eminate, smells sweet and creamy. Tastes of roasted malt lightly burnt but smooth creamy chocolate moving to a slightly bitter coffee flavor with molasses covered fruit coming up in the mix enhanced by very light hops. A smooth and very drinkable Imperial Stout. This brew is creamy sweet with just the right amount of roasted flavors to make a perfectly balanced taste, perfection. Mouthfeel couldn't get any better. Drinkability is great. This may not be the strongest Imperial Stout but it is still damn near the best one. I use to have these more in the past but on my quest to try new stuff they have fallen to the way side. I say never again."
"The beer poures a jet black color with a finger of tan head that falls to coat over the beer. The nose is really chocolatey, almost like a candy bar. I like the nose. The flavor is all about the chocolate. Wow. It stays with me a long time as well. The feel is thick and a little creamy. Drinkability is good. I like this beer."
"This is a very strong Imperial in terms of flavor and aromatics, but where the hell is the alcohol? An imperial stout at 7% abv? That's probably my biggest (only?) knock to this beer. A staple for Russian Imperials and something all collectors should possess at least a bottle of."
"Pours a glossy black with a creamy, rocky tan head which settles to a thin sheen and leaves persistent lacing. Strong roasted coffee and malt aromas, with vinous, nutty, slightly earthy tones. Rich, creamy toasted coffee initial flavor, which develops into a nutty, woodsy middle and finishes with a strong sweetness. Very nicely rounded in the mouth, with a perfect smooth and creamy texture. Easy to drink, though the sweetness can become overbearing by the end of a pint."
"This beer pours black. Completely opaque. No light is getting through this one. It has a light brown head. The head is creamy with larger bubbles scattered throughout it. The smell is exceptional. Its chocolatey, malty, and there is a presence of some fruit-like aroma. Maybe plum or cherry aroma. The taste is very good. Chocolatey and malty. Perfect amount of bitter on the back of the palate. Good mouthfeel. the carbonation is right on and the body is full. Coats the mouth nicely. This is a really good Imperial Stout and I would urge anyone who hasn't tried it to definately do so."
"Drinkabilty: A good stout, but the price tag and lack of flavor won't have me running out to buy a 6-pack every weekend, that's for sure. It's hard enough putting down 2-3 of these bottles in succession. It's meant to enjoy slowly after a big dinner, not to drink watching a football game. Personally, I liked the Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale a little better, as this is one of the weaker Imperial Stouts I've had."
"A classic Imperial Stout if I have ever had one. This one poured a opaque black color with a small brownish head that soon setlled into a fine pillow of a head on top of my beer. The smell was great with a slight plum scent breeaking through the coffee and chocolate layers. The taste was decidedly Sam Smith with its great light mouthfeel and perfect carbonation levels and the flavors of dark chocolate, carmel and coffee were so perfectly combined that this has to be the most balanced and drinkable Imperial Stout that I have had to date! This one especially hit the spot on this unusually rainy and cold San Diego evening. A top shelf brew for sure, highly recommended!"
"To be fair, I'm certain that this is a very ""correct," traditional example of this style. But... I'll put it this way: An all-original, ""correct"" '57 Chevy Bel-Aire is a classic, a great car. But a '57 Bel-Aire with a 502 c.i. crate motor, six-speed, disc brakes and a 1200-watt sound sytem is a HELL of a lot more fun to drive. So while it's good, I'll take Rogue's or Stone's monster stouts any day over this."
"The Beer God cometh. Simply a spectacular beer and the kingpin of the style in my opinion. Pours jet black with a nice viscosity. Smell is kinda wine-like with perhaps some blackberrys? Taste is wonderfully complex. Bittersweet chocolate, raisins, espresso, slight port wine perhaps in the finish. Super-drinkable at 7%. Enjoy."
"Comes in a custom bottle which I assumed to be brown, but after pouring I discovered it was clear, sigh. Pours a very nice, pure black, with moderate brown head. Smell is quite potent, very malty and quite attractive. Taste is good. Very deep, burnt flavor dominates here, much more so than most American imperial stouts. Almost coffee-like, but with a sharp sweet and sour flavor backing it up, the beer is surprisingly tangy. A good try, and I will certainly buy this again if I am in the mood for it, but I would almost NEED to be in the mood for this to drink it. Unusual to say the least."
"Pours an opaque deepest mahogany color with a tan head. Charred, roasty malt character with loads of butterscotch/toffee notes. Gripping sweet roasty flavors with ample carbonation to keep each sip lively on the palate, and the bittersweet finish invites another sip. Very nice and drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, altough it almost seems a bit lacking in body to me personally. The drinkability factor is very good. This one goes down easily and tastes great. A couple of these and I'd be a happy camper for the night. If you enjoy stouts, and have yet to try this one, get off yer ass and do it already!"
"What a nice beer. The abv is lower and makes this beer that much more apealing. This is one I will definately buy again."
"very good stout overall."
"Overall: This is the first imperial stout I've tried and I don't see how they could get any better than this! This is easily the best stout (imperial or otherwise) I've ever had. This beer would make a good winter warmer."
"Drinkability: I don't feel like this beer has much to offer that would bring me back."
"Drinkability: A great beer to herald in the change of the seasons. This is a nice beer to sip, and though I think multiple bottles coudl be consumed in one sitting, I'd rather sit and reflect over one."
"This was the first imperial stout I ever tried years ago and I made it a point to have a pint of it on a regular occassion. An excellent example of the style with a warm, rich taste, and a low amount of hop aroma. The color is a deep black and the head was significant."
"The beer pours pure black with a big tan head and good lacing. The aroma is of sweet cocoa powder, with the expected coffee and roasted barley notes as well. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. The coffee flavors are so well defined. There is a diversity of chocolatey flavors. The hops very evident. Theres also a smokey faintly acidity (from the roasted barley?). The carbonation is light in this thick brew making for a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is eminently drinkable because it is so well balanced and alcohol flavors are completely concealed behind a wall of richness. An excellent Imperial Stout."
"I havent had a bottle of this in years, basically the last time I had it I was still drinking craft brew from the bottle. So seeing how it is right behind on of my favorites in Stone Russian imperial stout I had to pick it up to review it. Pours out used oil black that looked a little thinner than other RIS I have had but great nonetheless. A full dark tan head formed atop the oily liquid and left no much in the way of lace as it faded away. There seems to be a strong smell of chocolate liquor coming from this with fruits and a bit of alcohol as well. Sweet chocolate covered fruit came to mind when I first sipped this. Chocolate and a touch of coffee were also present as well as a bittersweet finish. There was an odd sour taste that hit me a few times that was very unpleasant, not sure what this is from. Mouthfeel was good but not as thick as other Imperial Stouts but creamy still. Drinkability was lower than I would have though with that odd taste really putting me off. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but I plan on revisiting this in the future and giving it another chance."
"Everything is perfectly balanced for style. Dessert, slow sipper or multi-purpose beer. Excellent."
"A truly beautiful appearance. Pitch black with the darkest tan head I have ever seen. Awesome! The only reason this didn't get a 5 for appearance is because it left virtually no lacing on the glass. Great aroma as well. Very crisp and fresh for something with such a dark and roasted smell. Full bodied beer that contains flavors of caramel, roasted malts, and coffee, but it has a touch of sweetness to it. Very creamy mouthfeel. The drinkability takes a hit due to the high alcohol content and the thickness of this beer."
"Poured black as tar with about a 15cm thick dirty off-white head. The smell is absolutely fantastic, if you like this style of course. Roasted malt, chocolately, a little fig like, some caramel. The taste, too, is very chocolatey with that burnt malt taste I do love so about this style. Very smooth. Very easy to drink. Quite heavy, however, and three or less in a single sitting would be plenty. Excellent."
"The beer came in a 550 ml. sturdy looking clear (why?) bottle that released an a dark brown liquid with red highlights. This beer does not have the inky black look of other imperial stouts. The head was coffee-colored and formed at about 1½ inches thick initially, but then quickly dissipated to a thin layer of foam and some decent lace. The aroma was roasted coffer and dark chocolate goodness, with a dollop of dark skinned fruits thrown in the mix. The taste was a delightfully intense balance between the sweet flavors of raisins, figs, toffee, and apples; and bitter notes of old coffee and unsweetened chocolate. The alcohol warmth was pretty tepid for an imperial stout, and is clearly not the draw in this beer. The mouthfeel was also quite a bit lighter that the big boys, but was satisfying nonetheless. An easy drinking stout that is clearly a step above the ordinary, but remains very approachable still. A sessionable imperial stout if you will."
"Final Words: Bought a 4-pack of this for $10, can't wait to finish the rest. The best of their beers I have had so far. It is hard to say how this compares to the American Double Stouts, they seem so very much different."
"I have found the stout to end all stouts. Pours a deathly crude oil black with streaks of ruby, the mocha/tan head is wickedly awesome and the lacing will leave gobs on the glass. The smell is of espresso and mocha chocolate raisins. A slight nut smell as well, alcohol is detectable. The taste is pure glory, the sweetness of the roasted chocolate invites you for more, a graham cracker marshmellow sweetness is icing on the cake. Hints of fruit, dried raisins detected. Alcohol is detected as well. Medium bodied for a stout, not to thick but perfect to invite more and more, a very drinkable stout and will become the staple for me. Awesome."
"Overall: I'd definitely recommend trying it once. Maybe this is closer to the true style of an RIS and maybe the only ones I've tried have deviated from this standard. So maybe I'm the one that's screwed up. Also, with all the review I read, expectations were pretty high. Who knows..."
"The mouthfeel is incredibly round, very smooth, but not really creamy, with a thick dark chocolate grassy bitterness. The alcohol progressively warms the throat, but this brew is still almost as drinkable as water. Very nice."
"Final Thought: Another winner from Sam Smith's collection, this is the way a stout should be, ideally."
"Wow! This had a nice deep, rich, chocolate/dark fruit taste to it. Was very thick and chewy, just like I like 'em. The head was super thick and pillowy in the beginning, but then died out to a laceing. I would reccommend this brew to anyone who hasn't had it yet. I thought it was a little better when it was colder, but that's just me. All in all a great imperial and a top notch example of the style."
"Pitch black with thick beige head that decided to stick around for the entire time. Sweet matly, nutty and mollasses aroma off the head. The alcohol produces a sweet and warming taste in the mouth. Very thick lacing as the glass got emptier. Finish is very bold and not for the beginning stout drinker, but damn, does it taste good. Thumbs up!"
"This is a great stout straight from England. Great color and aroma. Smooth stout I really enjoy drinking this beer a little below room temp. The flavors come out and are remarkable on my tounge. Hint of coffee and a nice after taste. Samuel Smith deffinately gets a great vote of approval from me."
"I will buy this one again for sure. It would have gotten all 5's and probably deserves it but in comparison this one just didn't quite have the heartiness of storm king almost too smooth. get it and taste it. you won't be disappointed"
"When this baby was poured out of her clear glass dwelling, it was of a deep dark blackish-brown color with a thick inch or so of head. You stick your nose into this beer before that first tasting, and it revs up your senses for a malted wonderland. The taste going down is nicely complimented by its buttered rye bread aftertaste. Each sip brings the aroma of nutty malted goodness before this masterpiece rolls over your palette. The head follows the beer down the side of the glass until the last sip. This is stout worthy of more tastings in the future."
"Rich and oily, this is a beer to be consumed slowly. Strong chicory coffee flavors. Unlike pale ales, the hop is used strictly as a spice. The aftertaste is long lasting and bitter in an espresso way (the hop is quietly present as a touch of counterbalance) . This is a big beer in every way."
"Poured a dark brown, not opaque color with a large tan. It left some lacing on the glass. Had an aroma of chocolate malt, and fruits, most notably raisins. Taste of coffee, chocolate malt and some hops as well. It finished with a quick oily taste. The best session Imperial Stout I had tonight, if there ever was one."
"Bought a 4 pack for my girlfriend for our anniversary (that's true romance). Poured from a 12 oz. clear glass bottle into a Samuel Smith Tulip. Black, opaque beer, appears almost as soy sauce. Smell was rich in coffee, bill gates-rich, even. The bitter aroms coreesponded with the bitter flavors, the flavor was off the charts. Not a session brew, that's for sure. It makes you pause after every sip and try to recover, almost as the challenge of drinking hot sauce. A good, huge beer. May or may not get it again. I almost prefer a smoother sipping stout."
"Black as night. So dark, it makes it impossible to tell whether the bottle is, in fact, clear or not until you pour (it is). A nice thick, creamy, dark tan head forms, making for an impressive looking beer sitting in my goblet. A beautiful sweet dark malt aroma tantalizes your nose, waiting for the promise of the taste. There is definitely some dark chocolate in the background of the aroma. The taste is simply wonderful! The smoothest imperial stout I've ever had the privilege to drink. Dark chocolate, plums, and even a nutty presence all make themselve known. All riding a great malt background. Truly a great tasting stout! I get none of the typical off flavors common to stouts. The mouthfeel is thick and full, as an imperial stout should be. It is dangerously drinkable due to the smoothness. The 7% ABV is hidden. It goes down very easily! I love this beer and wish it could be had more readily to me. Another great stout from Samuel Smith."
"In particular the beauty of this beer (and one of the greatest things about all imperial stouts) is the great mouthfeel. As this thick syrup slides down my throat and sticks to the sides of my mouth I can hardly believe that this substance can even be called by the same name as what most people gulp down by the can all over this country, I really feel the calling to spread the word to the ends of the earth that a veil has been drawn over the eyes of the public and this dark slosh is just the substance to wash away ignorance and replace it with a knowledge of thick, full, roasted goodness!!!"
"I have yet to have a Samuel Smith beer that wasn't near perfection, regardless of style. This is no exception. This is not the highest-alcohol imperial stout you will find, but it is high quality. One of the smoothest stouts...as dark as one can find..I've often wondered why it would be in a clear bottle. Definitely a sipping beer...worthwhile to seek out, as all of this brewer's treasures are."
"Full feel, acrid, with a bit of an alcohol bite, but still smooth."
"This would make a great sipping beer to sit around with friends and discuss the merits of life with. I have one extra bottle, I think I'll put it away for about a year and revisit this one."
"Very dark brown body with a finely laced beige head, short-lasting. Aroma is very malty, full of dark chocolate, very roasty with coffee notes. A good hops mariage complement it all. I don't get much fruitiness in the aroma, but in mouth, there's plenty of them, lots of blackberries and plums. Mouthfeel is full, more carbonation than most. This possesses one of the most balanced roastiness I've met in the dry, almost smokey finish. Alcohol appears more and more as it warms, I'd have thought this is higher than 7%, I guess they sure didn't want to make it weak, it worked. Very full-flavoured and pleasant. Refined and less acid than most american renditions. Cheers to Matta for sending this a few decades ago!"
"Pours a deep black color that is topped by a creamy head. Thick aromas of molasses, coffee, chocolate, and dense dark malts all are found in the nose. Surprisingly any roast malt character is pretty subdued. This beer has a light creamy mouthfeel, with a finish of roast malts. The taste is reminiscent of malt balls, with molasses notes up front. The finish is sweet but it is balanced by a burnt acidity, the combination of the two is quite good. I also get notes of espresso and burnt raisins. This is pretty good, I haven't had one of these in years, and hopefully I will revisit this one sooner rather than later."
"If you've never had a stout before, have this one."
"This is my first imperial stout and it is nothing short of awesome. My only concern is this is as good as it gets."
"Wow, I love this beer! This is what made me a Sam Smith fan for life. It pours a gorgeous jet black color with a tan head. Smell is full of dark fruit and roasted malt. There's a lot of taste to this beer. Some raisins, roasted malts, and coffee. It goes down smooth and creamy but i love to take my time with this one making sure it is at room temp before the last drop hits the back of my tongue. This is definately one of my favorite imperial stouts."
"This is an excellent beer."
"The pour on this brew presents an essentially black liquid topped with a brownish, frothy head. The aroma is an experience unto itself: Roasted barley, toasted malts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, ethanol, caramelizing sugar, and ripe plums. Its simply a phenomenal smell!! Taste is solidly roasted barley with a heavy hoppiness and syrupy sweetness. Coffee-like bitterness, considerable heft (and almost chewy-ness), low carbonation contribute to the character of the beer. Bitterness and sweetness are very well balanced. Alcohol is mildly present in the aroma, but not predominant in the taste. This ones a classic."
" I wish I were one of ""Her Majesty's Forces"" just to drink this for free on a daily basis. In 1896 this was awarded a gold medal (according to the label). Yep, this is good stuff."
"I am not usually a big fan of stouts (they tend to be bitter or heavy), but after trying this for the first time, I have to say wow! This beer is so incredibly smooth and drinkable, and has a wonderfully soft mouthfeel. There are so many complex flavors and yet this brew is velvety smooth going down. The smell is intoxicating even before your mouth touches that chocolatey dark goodness. I will be keeping a few of these around, this is the best Stout I have ever had."
"Had another bottle 21 months later and now I very much appreciate its smoothness. A bit acidic and oily, a perfect roast and brown colour. Fresh batch."
"An outstanding Imperial worthy of the hype!"
"Sorry Sam Smith fans ( I honestly like the oatmeal stout, and organic lager) this is one beer ""Her Majesty's Forces"" can keep!!"
"The appearance of this Imperial was exceptional in my opinion. Not only was it an opaque opal color, but, it also had a nice 2 finger dark tan head that just lingered. It looked so darn good. Even when the head did start to go down it left a curtain of lace that would then form perfect rings around my glass. This was a visual 5, no doubt about it. The smell was excellent as well. A caramel nuttiness, with plenty of roasted malts and coffee notes. To me it's a similar smell to the Taddy Porter. The taste was of burned caramel, roasted espresso beans and roasted sweet malts. It also had the sweetness of burned fruits, raisons, and dates. The mouthfeel, although very good, was a bit thinner than I expected. Again, not bad at all, but from the richness of the rest of the experience I expected a bit more body. Very drinkable, the exceptional taste of this Imperial makes you wish winter would last a bit longer so you could squeeze a few more sessions in around the fire place."
"ASn exceptionally drinkable Imperial Stout..maybe lower in alcohol than many others nowadays..but its big on taste and character."
"Pours a shade of black as dark as a starless night. Nice 2 fingered tan head that lasts for a good long while and laces well. The aromas are of a bit of bitter chocolate, strong coffee and a bit of brandied dried fruits. Taste is echoed.. Nice espresso roasted coffee notes in the taste with the chocolate and dried fruits adding some depth. This is one tasty treat. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with only a bit of the alcohol showing through. Drinkability is high for a stout of this stature and magnitude. One of the best you can find. One can only imagine the number of foods this beauty could pair with. Have one of these with dessert instead of coffee."
"Pours a pitch black with a huge tan head. Very fluffy head that leaves a beautiful lace. Aroma is of espresso and roasted malts. Initial tastes of chocolate and coffee with blends of fruits and a nice velvet body that soothes the throat. This is extremely thick and has hints of plums. Outstanding silky feel and an overall great beer. The aftertaste is of an almost wine character. The flavors only become stronger as this brew warms. As the bottle states this is truly a drink for Her Majesty's Forces."
"One of my favorites."
"Mouthfeel definitely has some body while drinkability on this is about par for the course with imperials, good for people used to drinking them, not at all good for less adventurous taste buds :-)"
"Enjoy, just make sure you don't get a skunked one!"
"Very drinkable to me, but will probably kill a Budweiser fan. A Master brew unlike the ""Hop Monsters"" that just overplay a single aspect. GREAT brews have 10-20-30+ Different dimensions of excellence, not just one. I like this companys Oatmeal stout a bit better than this one, but this is a world class brew none the less."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick brown head. The aroma is great. It boasts of crystal, chocolate, and black barley. The taste is good. It is a smooth and rich dark beer with real flavor. There are a lot of chocolate and crystal malts here with some black barley for color and crisp roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine drinking stout. It's not much of a sessions ale, but it's one to enjoy. That's for sure."
"Drinkability: I'd say that, judging solely by the brewery, that this is a very traditional Imperial Stout. Nice and tasty, but I like more coffee and chocolate flavors."
"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout was served from a 550 ml clear bottle. When the beer was poured into an imperial pint glass, a thick and rich rocky tan head formed, then settled after a minute into a thinner but darker brown blanket, leaving thick lacing. The beer itself was impervious to light, except at the thinner bottom, where some deep ruby was seen to shine through. The nose was loaded with notes of ripe plantain, dark chocolate, sweet banana, and molasses... an intersting contrast to the nose of many of the top American imperial stouts. The taste was highly influenced by the nose. A mellow roasted malt base holds up flavors of molasses and dark chocolate, with subtle suggestions of banana coming through in the lingering semi-dry and well-bittered finish. The body was a little thin for an imperial stout, but wasnt too detrimental to the overall experience. As this was a toned down imperial stout, not in flavor but in body and alcohol content, it was very drinkable. Overall a solid and fine tuned piece of work, sure to please most stout lovers, but may dissapoint junkies of Expedition, Speedway, or Storm King Stout."
"I'll admit it's sweeter than I expected, but as just a piece of this tasty puzzle, that's an asset. One of the more truly balanced Imperial Stouts, it's big, but not humongous; full, but not bloated; dense, but far from over-complicated. The rather moderate ABV and fetching features make this emminently drinkable and enjoyable. It's a fine taste of England, and if it's even better on that side of the pond, then maybe I should be buying a plane ticket first thing."
"This is my first Imperial stout and I'm impressed. The temperature is currently in the single digits and it's overcast and spitting snow. Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is warming me nicely and I may just have to follow it with another."
"Tasted blind at the Saint Louis BA tasting 12/14/03"
"Wow! What a fantastic beer. I have to say that I was blown away with it. Pours to a midnight black color with creamy light brown head. The smell is marvelous, chocolate and a spicy rum smell. They go well together. The first sip and I was shocked, holy cow this is a great beer! The taste is thick and heavy with hints of chocolate, raisins and is out of this world. It has a very smooth feel to it with good carbonation. I feel I could drink this beer night or at least until my face meet the floor!"
"Pours an oily black with a creamy tan head. Very nice. Smells of chocolate pudding, raisins, and roasted rum. Mmmmm. If the nose is a little reserved, the taste makes up for it. Very rich, whiskey-sweet malts. Notes of chocolate and raisins. Followed and balanced nicely by a dose of hops. Finish is bitter, slightly roasty, with noticeable, warming alcohol. Not as thick or strong as many other imp. stouts I know and love, but still great."
"I might need more time to figure this beer out. I can certainly see myself coming back to it."
"Can't say I'd go for this again, there are many more beers to try, but it was a worthwhile experience."
"Dark cocoa colored head that is thick and foamy. The head held solid and left a lot of lace as the beer dissapeared. The beer was coffee black in color, almost light abosorbing. The aroma was of creamy chocolate, dark malt, and alcoholic raisins. The flavor was rich and creamy, some burnt malt and a little cocoa. A great beer with rich flavor and a smooth finish."
"My favorite thing about Sam Smith Imperial Stout is the look on the people around me's faces when I pour it and they realize that the bottle is clear. Most of them cringe and make some annoying comment about cough syrup. This beer is black with no chance of light getting through it. (even if you hold it directly in front of the light) It pours up a nice frothy brown head that lingers a bit before fading back to the drink. The aroma is interesting. Imagine what thick and dark might smell like and then have one of these and see if you were close. The flavor build straight through the after taste and lingers a bit. This guy Sam Smith must have beed a pretty cool cat!"
"I know I couldn't drink this all night, for fear of passing out on someone's lap, but oh, is it so good."
"Yummy!! Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout reminds me of two great brews put together. Apperance reminds me of Victory's Storm King Imperial Stout. Looks jet black with excellent amount of carbonation. Smell consists of chocolate and prunes mostly. Taste is what it's all about. It reminds me of Victory's Storm King and Sam Adam's Cream Stout put together. It's got that creamy aftertaste which makes it complex. And at 7.0%ABV, you wouldn't even know it's that much (the taste that is), although it does warm your throat and stomach which is a nice feel. Truly one of the best beers money can buy. I would recommend this beer just about to anyone."
"I do not know, but I love this ripe fruit smelling, chocolate coffee tasting goodness."
"Definately a good stout. It pours the typical deep-tinted brown of most stouts with a thick coffee head and lovely sticking lace. There are sharp smells of chocolate and coffe, but it also has a heavy spiced meat smell, and malt hops are evident. The taste is definately spicy meats and coffee, with lots of toasted malts, and a slight burnt flavor. The head gives its own very spicy taste. The mouthfeel is charmingly thick, bordering on too thick, but still within the limits of being good. The strength and thickness of the flavor of this beer make it seem more alcoholic than it is. Drinking it made me very warm."
"Re-rate: 9/28/04 - Finally secured a non-lightstruck bottle, and I must say that there is a world of difference. No skunk in site. The aroma had notes of chocolate, spices and licorice. All of the flavors that I mentioned were in ""low quantities"" above were now quite pronounced and delicious. The posted score now reflects this sample. (The original ratings were: apperance - 4.5, smell - 2.5, taste - 3.5, mouthfeel - 4.0, drinkability - 3.5 for an overall rating of 3.55)"
"03.17.05: After re-reading some of my reviews I came across this one. I admit it. I was naive when I tried this. I'm currently drinking a glass of Czar Jack from Town Hall. By no means is Sam Smith's Imperial stout thick in comparison. While still a fine beer. I don't think that I can really compare it to some of the American Double Stouts that have been gracing my glasses as of late. My rating still stands. I just thought I needed to clarify this a bit more"
"This stuff is wonderful. I would gladly imbide this over the finest champagnes."
"Taste is big dark malt. Bitter chocolate and sweet malt. A nice roundness in the flavor. Lightly nutty and smoky. Mostly big malty flavors but smooth too. Very full-bodied and big. sticky mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for big robust beer. Very flavorful for a 7.0 ABV, I've had stronger stouts that weren't near this complex."
"Its a dark, strong stout that is right nice on a winter night."
"Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. This was perhaps the most conspicuous victim of the blind tasting format. This bottle certainly did not live up to the lofty reputation of the beer, yet nothing indicated a bad or mistreated bottle to me."
"I enjoyed this Imperial but I surely have had some that I enjoyed more. Not a very robust Imperial Stout and a little too sweet. But it was still pretty damn swell!"
"I've been working my way through the Top 50, and IMHO this beer sets the standard for Imperial Stouts. It pours pitch black, with a huge tan head. Aromas of roast malt, chocolate, espresso, and currant tickle my happy nose. My mouth soon joins in the ecstasy, with chocolate, currant, espresso, malt, caramel, charcoal, and grapefruit doing the Dance of the 7 Veils on my tongue. Silky smooth caressing mouthfeel. Finally, it finishes with chocolate and grapefruit alternating little butterfly kisses on my sated palate. A truly sensual delight, if beers were girlfriends, this is the one you'd marry."
"Mouthfeel improved as it warmed...you know the alcohol is there and it's nice, especially on a cold snowy New England day. Definitely packs a puch..I can feel the warming effect already. Initially I gave it a 4.0 for drinkability, but as it warmed, once again, it had a great sipping, drinkability. Definitely woth its top 50 rating."
"Personally, I would give Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout a slight edge over the Imperial, but keep in mind I'm an oatmeal nut."
"It feels as good in the mouth as it tastes. It is thick in the mouth with no oiliness that you get from some cheaper stouts. This is the real deal. This is a beer that I will return when I want to have a stout. It is nectar."
"Drinkability: A stunning imperial stout. My personal preference for the slightly fuller American-style mouthfeel in no way detracts from how incredible this example is..."
"Mouthfeel is deep and heavy. There is a slight chalkiness which is just a bit unfriendly. A very full bodied stout. This is one I will return to. Just a well made old school stout."
"Pours a nice heavy weight motor oil color with a large pillow like head and superior lace and stick. Sweet black licorice, malt and coffee on the nose. Same on the palate with a touch of Albert Coq soy sauce as well. Sweet and savory in the mouth. Velvet texture. Touch of dark chocolate on the finish. Damn solid beer, especially for the 2.99 I layed down."
"This beer's appearance included a small sized tan head with fine-small bubbles that completely dissipated.The body was uncarbonated and opaque with a black hue.The nose of this beer was that of sweaty feet (oh yum) with a very mild coffee flavor.It had a smooth, watery and thin mouthfeel and it was light bodied.The lacing was very sparse."
"This one poured up with nice rich dark chocolaty color and had a thin caramel tinted head. Just looking at it, I couldn't wait for that first sip. The smell was pleasing; it had a good 'beer' smell - nice and hoppy - a smell that just invited me to take a taste. The flavor is bold but smooth at the same time. It had sort of a smoky and syrupy taste at the same time, which was a nice blend. The rich maltiness was consistent from start to finish and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this beer didn't have that after bite that a lot of stronger beers I tried tend to have. Over all, it's a pleasant beer. I would almost call it a desert beer. The kind of drink you finish off a good meat n' potatoes kind of dinner with but it might be just a little too sweet for me to drink a lot of it. But I tend toward the more bitter tastes."
"All in all a great imperial stout. Glad it's always available."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."

"Incredibly drinkable beer for an Imperial Stout. Not just for manly men. A great choice for review #50."
"Pitch black pour, dark brown head; incredible retention and lacing until the last drop. Eager, highly anticipative aroma of burnt malts, plums, raisins, heavy notes of alcohol. Up front this bad boy is thick, yet smooth and creamy. Velvety slick, with a port feel to it; roasted malts, the alcohol is quite noticeable, yet it is in the background and does not offend. Character notes are many, to include nuts, raisins, port, burnt malts, coffee beans and chocolate; absolutely incredible flavoring and taste. Savoring, enjoyable, a warming brew, immensely drinkable, quite complex, worth a novel; clearly one of the best brews out there."
"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a dark brown with a big mocha colored head that hung around for a while. Notes of coffee, dark chocolate and dark fruit in the nose. Taste starts out like bitter dark chocolate, then a little bit of a fruity, cherry-like taste slips in, before ending on a tiny, crisp citrusy note. The mouthfeel of this is not too thin, not too thick, just about right. This is very drinkable for a stout lover such as myself. For others not so enamored of the style, this might be too heavy, too ""bitter tasting."" They know not what they spurn."
"The feel is very substantive and rich, smooth yet clean, with light carbonation and a clean finish. This is a truly drinkable stout that has limited drinkability only because of its fullness and ABV. Very nise stuff, to be sure."
"Backwash: I haven’t had this in some time, and more’s the shame! A recent article in the Times led me to buy some and try it again. Boy, was I impressed. Not the darkest, not the hoppiest, not the highest ABV; but still the archetype of Imperial Stout. You can have all the Storm King you want, I’ll be happy with this! They haven’t forgotten that malt is at least as important as hops when it comes to stouts. And, what are you guys who mention the price talking about? It’s beautifully made and shipped over here, for less than what a lot of US microcraft brewers charge for inferior beers, and worth every cent! This beer clearly proves what Mies van de Rohe said, “Less is more.”"
"Samuel Smith makes some awesome beers. This is definitely no exception."
"Its been a very long time since Ive had an Imperial Stout. Ill be sure not to let this happen again. This is a great brew that is SO easy to drink. Not really a session beer simply by its nature, however, I dont think it would be too difficult to finish off a few of these."
"Appearance: Great same massive sized head as most Samuel Smith's brews out there, but this one has a deep brown amber black dark chocolate hue to it allows minimal light to pass through with a streak of prune hue purple deepness, lacing nice thickets of tan lacing clinging to my imperial pint. Aroma: Once again deep chocolate and coffee tones are present with fruit edges there fermented prunes or figs with chocolate sauce englazoned uone them how wonderful every dark roasted stout should smell this magnifcant. Minimal hopping in the aroma for the fruit and deep flavoful roasts mean to steal the show. Tase: Alcohol infused deep roasted malts with fruit remaninsce leaving their mark upon this heavenly dark ale, I really think this is one of the best imperial stouts on the market maybe not extreme or over the top but most flavorful and consistent the Sam Smith's reportoire get's the gold. Mouhfeel: A bit fuller than most Sammy Smith's this one packs quite the body keeping each sip not only flavorful but chewy. Drinkability: Is incredible for the amount of alcohol and flavor coming through I can't believe they allow this type of beer out there in this semi prohibitional state this country sometimes seems to be stuck in."
"Overall, I'm going to give Samuel Smith's the benefit of the doubt and chock this one up to a storage problem affecting this particular bottle, not a problem with the beer itself. I intend on getting this again (soon), hopefully on tap, and re-reviewing. But for now, I've had better imperial stouts."
"Eclipse Black color. Nice big frothing foamy head. Its alive..Its alive..Its alive... Aroma is chocolate and plums. A full-bodied stout. Deeply roasted chocolate malts. Deep and rich chocolate flavor. Very flavorful and complex. Chocolate, coffee, caramel and fruit. Some hop bite. Nice beer. Worth trying. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"There's a little deception with the bottle with the gold foil over the top so you're tricked into thinking you have a dark brown bottle, but as you pour it the bottle empties and it becomes a clear bottle. It pours out blubbing from its longer, thinner neck to a super thick dark brown used motor oil color, much like that of what it looks like in the bottle, a finger high head of cocoa brown, very dense whipped cream froth appears with a momentary rocky top then settles slowly down to a thin haze and the lace is in thick sticky sheets with some moth holes in it. Smell has a bunch of licorice and a touch of cherry with notes of sweet chocolate, dark toffee, and french silk pie, sweet tangy roastyness is there but modestly soft. Taste is a mild mellow mix of sweet chocolate, soft tangy roasted malts, and some fruit cake or breads, cherry mostly with some raisin and fig notions. Smooth and lasting medium body feel with some light coffeeish like drying and muffled, dulled fruity roasted tangyness in the finish which lingers for a shortened minute. Goes down easy with some carbonation that lends a somewhat flat soda pop. I just wonder if the light getting through the clear bottle is doing something to it? A solid well balanced Imperial Stout but not all that intriguing or complex really. The nose got a bit more lively as it warmed which was nice, as for the taste the warmth only brought out a flatter roastyness and lost the fruity notions that I did like at first. A great start for any would-be beer lover that wishes to aspire to better beer."
"A superb stout. Also one of the most expensive in the store I bought it at. It proves that sometimes, you really do get what you pay for. Pay top dollar, get a top stout. Good job, Smith!"
"Drinkabliity: quite drink abt but if a drank to many i would surely fall down."
"A great dessert beer. Easily one of my favorite imperial stouts. Incredibly easy drinking for it's power of flavor. Top shelf."
"Thick almost creamy head sits with no sign of dissipating and leaving slight amount of belgian lace. Aroma is very nice as it is sweet yet dark with a hint of roastiness. The taste of this beer is so good i could drink it for the rest of my life and still find new flavors. Rich in malt sweetness and a creamy roast character with a phenomenal balance of hop bitterness and flavor. It is so refreshing and clean that i can easily drink large gulps of this and never have to worry about a bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied yet filling and definetly a bit alcoholic. Very drinkable by itself, as a session beer (if you want to get toasted), or paired with foods that would not be so bold as to overpower the depth of this brew."
"Appearance wis is is a fairly typical black brew with a very nice brown head leaving a good lace. The high gravity of the stout adds to the aroma with a whiff of alcohol. The only real downside to the brew was a fairly light to medium body which seemed out of character for the style out of a bottle. Still it has a great finish which is good because you probably wouldn't too many of these in a session. In my database I rate this in my top five stout with a rating of 8.9 out of 10."
"Comes in a tall, clear bottle with gold foil covering the cap and bottle neck. Pours a wonderful BLACK with a tan, frothy, one finger thick and very long lasting head which sticks to the glass wherever it touches. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Scents of plumes are also present. Wonderful rich deep and complex flavor. The taste of chocolate and fruit (plumes) really comes forth. Very smooth and sweet, this full-bodied beer is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
"A very nice, very roasted imperial stout. Almost no carbonation. A beautiful roasted malt flavor with a slight hop balance. Roasted malt flavor persists throughout the finish. slightly heavy but the flavor picks up the alcholol warmth leaves off. a top notch imperial stout"
"As a top 10 beer, I've been wanting to try this one for a long time, and it was surely worth the wait. Though it's a lower ABV than the monster American Imperial stouts, it still stands up with them, and at 7% ABV, I can drink a lot more of em!"
"This RIP does well as a stand-alone, but other prominent examples were so much bigger and more flavorful that this seemed like a lightweight. Sam Smiths strong point is its smoothness and creamy mouthfeel, but a lot of the big boys were able to attain the same or even better feel with superior flavors."
"Poured a dark cola like color,a head that looked and smelled like a chocolate soda, aroma seemed soft and disappeared quickly. Initial taste was cocoa and sweet port, with a roasted malt aftertaste. Mouthfeel started off crisp with tingly bubbles, and then melted into a creamy smoothness.A little bitterness showed up at the end. Will try to always keep one in stock."
"I had been told that this was the grandfather of all imperial stouts, and I concur. A must-try."
"Pours a pitch black with a real nice creamy head,aroma is of dried fruit and some nuttiness.The taste is a little spicey and nutty with some chocolate undertones a real nice warming beer to drink before bed.This and the Taddy are my favorite Samual Smith ales."
"Every sip I take makes me like this beer more and more. I had 4.0's across the board until I began to realize how good this beer really is. The nose on this beer has a rare and enticing blend of smoky caramel and robust alcohol, it makes me want to dive right in. The expected taste, however, does not fully portray it's smell. It is a surprisingly easy beer to drink, with complexities of mild yet rich maltiness with a perfect mix of subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel is like silk on the tongue, and it lingers there for a great duration before exiting with a desirable sweetness. It is simply outstanding. I have to sample other quality Imperial's before I move this one into the 5.0 range, but right now, I am feeling a bit guilty that I haven't already done so."
"Whoa!...This is one delicious brew. The bottle had the typical gold wrapping around the top like the other Sam Smith's I've had, and a hypnotizing white label. Poured nice and smooth and appeared jet black in the glass like most good imperials. Very little head on this one. Smelled of coffee and perhaps a hint of chocolate, though neither was overwhelming. Perfect milky smooth mouthfeel, I wanted to 'swish' it around in my mouth before drinking! A lot of flavor and very, very smooth. That Samuel Smith smoothness that I love only complimented the imperial style 'bite' that comes with some of the stronger imperials. I had to go with a 5 on the drinkability on this one, and I rarely give 5s. I did not want to put this one down. Did I mention that it was smooth??!! Alcohol not noticeable until the finish when an ever so slight alcohol warmth caps off a fine, no, very fine brew from Samuel Smith."
"This was a very good beer however the ability to have more than one in a sitting would almost be impossible. I guess that is the only problem with Imperial Stouts."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany red, almost black with a nice tan head. This is one good looking brew. Smell is of a strong english bitter, with tons of british style hopping, and coffee, chocolate smell that is more in the background. taset is good & delicate, with a very buttery mild coffee taste. Creamy butter dominates this brew. It's got a fairly light mouthfeel for a stout that lets the taste linger forever, and believe me this is a good thing. Very drinkable, I could quaff this all night."
"This pours black with little head, but good lacing. Smells wonderful. Taste is of strong roasted malt, with chocolate and coffee present. This is very full bodied, a good ""sipping beer"". Distinct in the aftertaste is alcohol mixed with sweet burnt coffee. This is an excellent stout, although not in my price range. One word sums it up; WOW."
"This has a good overall taste to it and many flavors. But it doesn't knock my socks off like some other imperial's have. Lots of very sweet flavors. Chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, plums and a little bit of malt bitterness (but not enough). Great array of flavors that mix well. Finishes dry and roasted. The body is too thin for this to be an imperial. Don't get me wrong this is a great tasting beer, but it just seems a little weak to be an imperial stout."
"I did not chill this much. Probably 55F. Pours absolutely dark with a nice thin head. Pretty tan head about a quarter of an inch thick. More carbonated bite than I expected. Not very dry. Very intense roasted malt flavor. Chocolate and coffee also. Some hops make it through all that in the finish. Believe me there is a lot to taste here, but smooth is the word. Don't pass this up"
"Originally sampled on 24 June 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Opaque black w/ a frothy head that settles down quickly, this Imperial Stout has more of the 'coffee' taste than other I.S.'s I've tried. I didn't think that the overall taste was that strong. Also, the alcohol wasn't well hidden. A decent imperial stout, but I prefer others."
"12oz. clear (blah) bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a jet black color with 1 thick finger of light tan foam. There is a slight bit of lacing. The smell is sweet and nutty, full of burnt malt too. The taste is heavy roasted malt with coffee and caramel lingering in the background. There is just a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue for balance. The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth. The drinkability is pretty nice for 7%. The benchmark for all imperials!"
"To my thinking, this is the standard against which other Imperial Stouts should be rated. Nice sustained head with a lovely chocolate-brown color. Smell is of malt and chocolate, with a little coffee overtone. Taste is velvety smooth, starts with malt at the front, then the waves of chocolate, molasses, and roasted espresso kick in. Just superb!!"
"I now know why this is the quintessence of Imperial Stouts. It is finely balanced, sweet and bitter all at the same time. A real treat to drink.It poured jet black except the very bottem where there was a thin sliver of scarlet light. There was a thin, tan, rocky head pearched on top and the lace clung to the sides. Upon smelling my nose immediatly picked up huge, roasty malts and extreme smoked bitterness. The Imperial Stout slunk down my throat coating it with an abundance of flavors. The tip of my tongue was tickled by hop bitterness, which rolled into a heavy dose of sweet chocolate malts balanced with caramel. The taste was rounded out at the end with a chalky, dry aftertaste and a warming alcohol feeling in the back of my throat. The mouthfeel was not extremely heavy as I would have expected and had a tiny bubble carbonation, which delighted my tongue. One question though, why the clear bottle?"
"Magnificent! This imperial stout is luscious and smooth and complex. It pours an unfathomable deep brown, but it is neither oily nor viscous. The dark tan head lofts it way upwards tantalizingly and then recedes deliberately into a fine buckskin blanket over the insides of the entire glass. The smell is slightly sweet, molasses and dark cherry balancing the mossy darkness of the stout. But the mouthfeel--it's like a down comforter on a cold, crisp night. And a taste to match--smoked toffee from start to finish with the subtle sweetness emerging from time to time as I savour every sip."
"It pours out pitch dark, and has a very nice (and potent) taste. The smell didn't rouse me much, but the beer has a perfect mouthfeel.I was also impressed by the smooth aftertaste. It's much more drinkable than most other bears with this strong of a smokey flavor. I'm not a big fan of this type of beers, but won't hesitate to have another."
"Pours a dark black with a nice sized tan head. Nice coffee/roasted malt smell. The taste is the shit. Light coffee flavours with a little chocolate, roasted malt, toffee and alcohol added in the mix. Also a bit metallic. Rich medium texture, not too heavy, creamy and just right. the drinkability is awesome since it isn't too strong to put you off flavour wise, and that it has a nice balance of alcohol, enough to warm you up but not so much you have troube finishing your 4 pack. delicious."
"Sweet toffee and molasses dominate the bready, Brit-malt nose. Some grapes show up in the slightly sweet front. The middle is thick, thick, buttery and thick. Toffee sticks around throughout. The finish dries, but it's a little cloying and a little astringent. This is a very good, unique beer that's really a lot better at room temp, where it evens out and becomes the delicious treat it's meant to be."
"I've had this before several years ago and haven't tried it again until now. Very impressive stout and a sweet surprise. Poured very dark almost black with short but tight tan head. Smell of roasted malt and usual english hop nose. Feels like velvet on my tongue and one of the smoothest stouts in recent memory. Taste is malty and rich with chocolate and roasted malt prevailing. Great to the finish."
"Wow, what a great Imperial Stout. I mean this is what I've always imagined. Amazingly dark body with brown head. Sweet malty base is balanced with chocolate, coffee, and hopped up undertones. This is both sweet and crisp. The lower alcohol percent gives you a chance to drink the entire four-pack without same effects of a 10% Imperial Stout."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a dark medium head. The aroma is full of scents of alcohol as well as some chocolaty malts. The taste is of burned malts and licorice and the alcohol is not extremely well masked as well as very dry tasting. The dry and burned malt stick around in the aftertaste. This beer is fairly easy to drink for an imperial stout, but not being a fan of imperial stouts, I would not have more than one."
"I have a new favorite brew and Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout be thy name!"
"This brew is completely black with some slight brown hues coming through when held to the light. Large, creamy brown head maintains its shape for quite some time. Thick sheets of lace line the glass. Roasted and sweet chocolate malt nose. Sweet chocolate malts dominate, some roasted characteristics, alcohol well hidden, virtually unnoticeable. Chewy soft mouth. Excellent stout."
"If I was an old man, I'd want Samuel Smith to marry my daughter."
"Does not in any way need food to complete the experience, but my initials: Would unquestionably dance a tango with sharp cheese or brie. Must be that oily sensation. I don't eat chocolate, but I can assume that German chocolate cake with dark cherries would also run with this."
"This is the beer that got me writing beer notes about 8 years ago. This excellent Imperial Stout is ebony in color with a thick, foamy tan head that leaves behind a shroud of lace. The complex aroma gives pleasing smells of coffee, chocolate, hops and alcohol. The heavy and rich malt provides a luscious, velvety texture. Abundantly hopped with citrus, metallic and tea-like bitterness. Coffee and chocolate press forward as does some molasses sweetness. Noticeable alcohol, but not overdone. Wow!"
"It's pitch ass black, defining the word opaque. A large two inch tan head forms and reduces to a thick coating which laces well. It presents itself like a perfect stout, and a perfect stout it is damn close to. The aroma is a strong concoction of roasted malts, vanilla, and chocolate. I get some dark fruits coming through as well, but vanilla stuck out the most. I love it! Super-smooth creaminess is the mouthfeel of this medium to full bodied brew. Strong flavors of burnt coffee and chocolate treat your palate, and then some hops come by for a quick stay in the finish. Warming alcohol is prevalent in the finish, a reminder of the strength of this brew. This is one heluva stout, simply put."
"My perspective of Russian imperial stouts must me skewed a little bit since I'm used to drinking Storm King Stout and Old Rasputin, but this was still a wonderful beer. Black in color with a head that is about an eighth of an inch and diminishes to a very thin layer. Aroma of chocolate and coffee and the sweet taste of raisins come through in the taste."
"F."
"Pours out pitch black with a medium dark tan head that stays that way till the last drop. Lots of aromas to this, picked up some coffee, chocolate some raison and a smoke or roasted aroma in there as well. Tastes of some coffee, chocolate, little bit of raison and some malt. Mouthfeel with smooth and creamy with not much bitterness to it. This is a good beer but my favorite Sam Smith is still Oatmeal Stout."
"While many American made Imperial Stouts are made by upping the hops or adding chocolate or doing whatever to make the beer as aggressive as possible, this beer is more straightforward and doesn't try too hard to be extreme or innovative. In other words solid in a good and classical feeling way. Leave it to Sammy Smith to show us how it can be done."
"I was looking for a special drink with a kick for this wednesday evening and I think I found it. Presented in a 1pt. 2 oz. bottle, clear glass. Poured a jet black with a frothy tan head that stayed and stayed. Aroma was remiscent of dark fruit lik raisons or figs, and also included coffee, smoke, cocoa, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth, going down just like silk and low in carbonation. It tasted very bittersweet, toffee and roasted malts as well as cocoa and a smokey-charcoal taste. Excellent choice. The overall character is very complex, and this plus the heavy body make this a great beer."
"This was the first Imperial Stout that Id ever sampled and its still my favorite one of the style. Pours a deep, deep black color with a creamy tan head, which seems to stick around for the duration. A thick, sticky beige lace is left on the glass. Nose is full of malt, caramel, chocolate, and alcohol. The taste will give you a swift sucker-punch in the mouth. There are so many flavors, all mixed together. Chocolate, coffee, malt, and malt all seem to blend together perfectly. This is a highly enjoyable imperial stout."
"stout with Rogue's Shakespeare Stout coming very close."
"Amazingly drinkable. There are certainly imperials that are higher in abv. But this one HAS to be rated high on its drinkability -- great taste and a slightly low alcohol content means you can drink all the more of it before you have to stop."
"But, I can't help liking it. Great stout, delicicious,delightful, but a bit weak, at a ""mere"" 7%, compared to similar brews from ""the colonies"". Quite tasty, but I'd love it if they'd ever stretch out some."
"Twilight zone stout. A pretty shiny black color with a light brown top. Aroma was a subdued roasted malt with a hint of chocolate, much lighter than the Imperials I've been drinking. The flavor leaned toward chocolate and a little acidity,there was also a red wine flavor that seemed out of place (maybe a little oxidized?). It had a nice medium body that made it nice drinking and hid the alcohol well, but the finish was also shorter than others of the same ilk.Not overly impressed with this sample- I may have to revisit it soon."
"This was my first time with this beer. It was okay and had some very nice qualities, but the flavor just wasn't my thing."
"Pours completely black with a light brown head with good lacing. The aroma is alcoholic, chocolatey, raisiny, and malty. The flavors are roasty malt and chocolate with hints of coffee. The mouthfeel is amazing on this brew. It is smooth, creamy, and silky, like their Oatmeal Stout. This is an excellent full-bodied brew; a definite favorite."
"Poured a deep brown if not black with a two finger tan head that didn't stick around long. The nose was dominated by fruit, alcohol, and a little maltiness The taste was extremely sweet, almost like a sour sweet. It also had sort of an astringent taste but it wasn't good. The mouthfeel was medium, but I didn't like how it sat on the palate. I'm not sure what the word is maybe tannic? I was disappointed with this brew especially after all the good reviews. Maybe it was skunked. I've never had a skunked beer."
"An opaque black body is capped by a foamy tan head that holds exceptionally well. It eventually drops, but maintains a creamy collar & thin surface covering throughout the glass. Some very nice Brussel's lace adds to the appearance. The aroma expresses dark fruit (currant, plum), dark chocolate, roastiness, and molasses. The medium/full body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation to give a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The exceptionally rich, sweet malt expresses chocolate, toffee, roast, and coffee that's backed by a firm hop bitterness. It starts fruity (raisin, prune), developing sweetness and chocolate, but most of the flavors appear after the swallow when the tastebuds are no longer being overwhelmed. Fruit bursts forth followed by chocolate and rich caramel/molasses, then some floral hop flavor, and finally its roastiness appears - coffee-like and still somewhat chocolatey - with a borderline smokiness. The long and complex finish is what makes this beer... it's meant to be savored! It may at first seem more restrained than other examples of the style (and essentially it is), but a closer look reveals an immensely drinkable and exceptionally complex stout. Quite well done and well worth seeking out."

"Oily black brew with just a wisp of brown at the edges...forms a 1/4"" dark tan head which thins but always leaves an insulating layer. Carbonation is mild to moderate with small bubbles. Aroma is raisins, prunes, toffee, semisweet chocolate, and dark maple syrup. Despite the clear bottle, there are no noticeable off aromas...smells great. Mouthfeel is slick and chewy. Taste is initially black licorice, dark molasses, prunes, dates and figs, fading into a somewhat unpleasant metallic tinge, followed by wine-ish notes, ending in a long, pleasant caramelized sugar sweetness. Hops are restrained, letting the complexities of the malts shine through. An enjoyable brew...incredibly easy to drink for an imperial stout (easy to put 3-4 of these away in one sitting), and a good source of calories when shoveling the snow out of your driveway on a windy winter night."
"I would drink this everyday if it weren't so expensive. A must have if you've never tried it!!!"
"Pours out very dark with a nice fluffy brown head. This is a nice beer. Dry and the taste blows one away. Me for one. Goes down smooth with no notable aftertaste. This is my first imperial stout and I am very impressed. This is certainly not the last of these to test my belly. More will follow; the sooner, the better."
"This stout is very dark brown (almost black, with there are hints of red if held to the light). It pours to give very little foam head. There is only a trace of an aroma (not unusual for a stout). The taste was full with the flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee coming through the dark malt. Not much hop character. The mouthfeel is sweet and smooth, and the body is medium. The drinkability is good for this strong stout."
"Drinkability: How many can you buy? Not as assertive as the other stout I've tried (Victory Storm King), but I think that is a good thing. I've only recently started to try the stouts and this is a beer I could consume forever."
"This is a solid beer worth every point in my rating."
"I've been able to try several terrific Imperial stouts, and Samuel Smith remains one of my favorites. I believe that it is one of the best balanced beers of the style (that I have tried). Goes down quite easy for a thick-bodied, 7% alcohol beer. Not too hoppy or malty. Pours extremely dark, good- sized head, some remains throughout. Notes of chocolate (but not overly so), and not too dry (as are some of the other highly regarded imperials). Most times I've had this beer, I've enjoyed it completely, however it may be adversely affected by the clear bottle."
"The jet-black typical stout color is so pleasant a site sitting in its chalice, with the portly head perched atop the black beauty. Creamy in its texture, chocolate brown in color and as it evaporates, leaves a magnificent sheet of lace to smother the glass. The aromas of a truly great Imperial Stout are unmistakable, rich roasted grain, bittersweet chocolate, fresh roasted coffee beans, lightly sweet, and an absolute treat to the senses. Ambrosial malt start, the top thick and creamy rich the finish has a nice crisp acidic bite, hops purposeful in their spiciness. Aftertaste is chocolate malt dry, and quite long lasting, and in my opinion, still one of the best ""Stouts"" on the ""Beer market"" today, as it was yesterday and as it will be tomorrow. This is one brewery that still loves its beer and the drinkers who buy their products."
"Here is one good solid stout. Any stout lover will love this one. The maltiness and hopps are blended to perfection to offer a stout with a crisp clean finish. A little light on the nose but exceptional in quality. This is a highly quaffable stout and can go down so fasts you will be left wanting - more that is. Exceptional if you can find it on tap as well."
"OLD Review This beer just didn't do it for me, and the problem was the taste. It is deep brown, almost black with a thin tan head and low carbonation. The smell is malt with some caramel sweet tones. The taste is just average, nothing complex or interesting and even a little watery in my mind. This is my favorite style (so far) but this beer lacked the in your face flavor and complexities of other Imperials that I love (Rogue, Storm King). I do like the color and the mouthfeel was good, but as far as taste (the most important factor in my book) it just didn't pack it."
"A commanding nose of chocolate syrup liberally poured over baked berries, anisette wafer cookies and a spoon of vanilla ice cream. A predominate roastiness oversees a mélange of fantastical flavors that meld perfectly with a smooth, oaty mouthfeel. A masterful creation out of the old brewery. Like having your own personal flavor harem stroking your buds whilst you lay back in a state of exquisite wonderment. Drinkable? Please! How can you keep your lips off it? Elegant *and* accessible."
"Nice pour. Looks like an Imperial should, Black as coal with a nice tan head that holds firm. Chocolate & alcohol dominate the nose. Nice roasted malts that are heavy on the chocolate with a slight coffee finish. Very drinkable. Lighter in body than I was expecting. A fine example of the Imperial Stout."
"Cheers"
"Oelergud - Cheers!"
"What an exceptional brew. I am surprised that I have never tried it before- or maybe I did years ago but do not remember. Anyway, this beer is insanely delicious. Jet black with a nice tan head, this is possibly the smoothest of imperial stouts. Rich and malty with roasted chocolate and coffee like flavor, it also reminded me of port, with sort of plum flavors. This beer is so smooth, with a velt texture, it just goes down easily. Of course you want to savor and enjoy this masterpiece in front of a nice fire with good conversation."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet. Pours out to a dark, yet not completely black color in the glass. Aroma is that of caramel and malt. The taste is where this beer really shines. Molasses, toffee, coffee, caramel and plums are present. The 7% ABV is hidden well with little alcohol presence. The swallow is very good and invites you to drink it again. Not as complex as Bell's Expedition, but a wonderful beer in its own right."
"12 oz clear bottle...yea yea.... Black as midnight in the middle of nowhere. Loud pour....glug glug glug, produces a creamy, pillow soft tan head. Bubbly, small drops of hop oil, dance on top. Great smell of roasted plums, raisans and other fruit. Molasses. Taste is silky smooth, roasted plums, subtle bitter chocolate malt. Quick hint of port wine. Bitter snap starts, then sweet slippery port finish. Great beer, and well worth the praise it receives."
"This was a real treat to taste and I will be buying more soon..."
"Ink black liquid overtakes the glass the way an octopus overtakes its prey's senses with a jettison of black liquid. Pours to create a great creamy head that laces all of the way to the bottom. A winter welcoming aroma of coffee and roasted malt. Flavorful, not demanding on the taste buds rather soothing. A noticeable, but complementing hop presence, attentive not astringent. Smooth light body and sleek finish earn this one a, ""best overall."""
"Samuel Smith, kicking serious ass as always, and throwing me the constant reminder of why I love beer so much."
"This is one of the best beers I've had. Pours pitch black and tastes like coffee, dark fruit, chocolate, roasted malt, and about a million other flavors that form a deliciously complex brew that goes down smooth as silk. This beer is soooo good and complex. Right now I'm having a bit of a crisis because I think I might like this better than the SS Oatmeal Stout. This one is definitely more complex, but I'd need an O-Stout here for comparison before I make such a big decision. I wanted to try this so bad that I paid 5 bucks for a single bottle. I know I got totally ripped off, but in Lancaster PA, my only alternative was driving to Philly or Maryland, or spending fifty bucks for a case. Had I known I'd like it this much, I might have gotten a case. Well, at least it was a kick-ass beer. Do yourself a favor and check it out."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel made this a real pleasure to drink. After drinking this I was very unsure why I don't drink Sam Smith's Imperial Stout more often."
"it hits the tongue a little thinner than i had expected. i thought i was going to be loaded with dark malts coffee and chocolate, but it was a little bit light. very smooth and absolutely delicious."
"Pours black as night, nice creamy tan head.Smells of dark roasted malts and coffee, thick creamy full mouthfeel, sweet malty and awesome, the flavors and aroma get even better as it warms."
"Pours very dark with only the faintest (still awfully dark) hints of color at the fringes. A substantial head of bronze/tan foam that lingers and creeps down the side of the glass as you drink. Sweet, even fruity, nose with lesser hints of chocolate, though more muted than I would like. Taste is a wonderful balance of smoothness and slightly hoppy bitterness with the typical roasted tastes coming through. Clean mouthfeel and good drinkability complete this great stout."
"Imperial Stout Blind Tasting (11-16-02): Not reall dark for style. Ruby flashes. Head is a little thin, but pretty average for style. The aroma is big alcohol, sweet chocolate and roasty malts. The flavor is less heavy on the alcohol and is more sweet chocolate. Nice roasty malt underneath, hay-like almost. Really nice fruitiness. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin for style. Really sweet."
"Contractors to Her Majestys Forces can be found on the bottle label along with gold and sliver medals from the 18 and 19 hundreds."
"And at $5.99 for a four pack, worth every cent."
"Nice Stout, very dark, deep aroma and taste.Pours black with a great tan head that holds well. Chocolate and coffee/toffee throughout. Nice carbonation, smooth tongue feel. Slight hop, great finish. Good drinking Stout, with a mellow finish that leaves you wanting more."
"Great brew!  Pours a beautiful deep thick black with garnet high-lights with a medium tan head.  Smells VERY nice with hints of roasted malts and chocolate.  The taste is has the same as the smell along with the addition of a very slight hint of coffee and very nice well balanced hops.  It has a medium bodied mouthfeel and is quite refreshing!  Again, very good stuff!  Cheers!"
"A virtually black beer with chestnut highlights around the rim of the glass.  Pours with a dark tan head which quickly dissipates but leaves a small ring around the glass.  The aroma is faint and difficult to place.  The taste, however, is astounding.  Sweetness, hops bitterness, chocolate, a little vanilla, fruit, and nuts all in a creamy mouthfeel.  I keep envisioning chocolate covered cherries as I drink this beer.  It also drinks very easy.  This is truly a top notch beer."
"A ""High Borne"" Aristocratic Sovereign amongst Stouts."
"Dark but not opaque with Burgundy highlights and a wisp of foam on top. The aromas are of milk, blueberries, prunes and old-fashioned licorice with a dusting of cocoa and sweet spices. Velvety, peptol-bismol-like texture and even a little medicine-box nuance, like old bandages, kicking in. Delicious sweet milk, walnuts, vanilla bean and burnt sugar. No obtrusive hop herbalness at all. Brilliant, satisfying, and amazingly drinkable for an Imperial Stout. A beer with class and poise."
"It's jet black with the tan head we've come to expect of Imperials.  The head fades rather quickly, leaving a beer that is appropriately low in carbonation.  The smell has notes of roasted malt and just a hint of sweetness.  The flavor is also heavy on roasted malt, and I found it to be dryer than expected.  It's pretty good but nothing spectacular.  I've never gotten the fascination with Samuel Smith beers, and this one did little to change my mind."
"Thick ""imperial pour", brown head of 1/2 inch...no light transmission, absolutely black as night. Cherry aromas with a chocolate coating -- very similar to the box of candy. Dark and sharp flavor with a sense of some smokiness. Just lays in your mouth like a chocolatey cough syrup with a swell of deepness close to the swallow. The essence of this beer is a whopping presence and overall agreeability. Slightly less interesting than some other bigger Imperials, but a solid (and stolid) presence. If you like the profile, this brew is deceptively drinkable. One of the most delicious beers overall in existence."
"Once again Samuel Smith has made a flawless beer."
"One of the great beers of the world."
"One of the best I've ever tasted, extremely drinkable, I wish I had bought more than one."
"Dark as midnight, thick and chewy, caramel, coffee, chocolate, intense flavors. Hands down my favorite stout.(until I tried storm king) Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is everything a beer should be. This is the first Imperial Stout I ever tried and I love it."
"Nevertheless, this is a good, medium-full bodied, generally very smooth imperial stout, and the fruit/chocolate combination in the flavor is really quite luxurious.  A very fine beer."
"Wow, just when I thought I had tried Samuel Smith's best beer, this beer comes into my life. At $2.25 a bottle I can't think of a better choice. Wonderfully rich aroma, roasted coffee and smooth chocolate flavor. Medium thick tan head and really nice lacing. This is a new favorite, I can't wait to try it again."
"Black and opaque with a fine head that is coffee colored that leaves wonderful lace all the way down. Coffee, rum, and plum aroma. Mouthfeel is thick and oily. Sweet with a very long complex aftertaste (bitter, fruity, molasses, chocolate); hard to think it's only 7% - a wonderful beer !"
"This near opaque brew throws out a thin creamy brown head that retains nicely.  This Imperial has a sweet toffee-like aroma mixed in with the usual roasted and burnt tones.  The body of this beer is a little light for an Imperial Stout in my opinion (as is the a/v which is a mere 7%).  The body is medium at best.  However, this lends to a very easily drinkable Imperial Stout.  There are no hints of alcohol in the taste.  And the taste is very pleasant.  Nice chocolate tones.  Nice bittersweet tones.  Nice subdued burnt malt flavor.  And some bitterness to boot.  Dark fruits surface halfway through and molasses seems to be mixing things up a bit too.  A highly drinkable and flavorful Imperial Stout.  Things could get messy if you lined up a few 4 packs of this for me."
"Pours with a billowing tan head settling over barely opaque liquid. Nose is a bit of dark fruits, followed by malt...the classic Sam Smith dark beer nose. Taste is smooth and sublime, with notes of raisins, burnt malts and yeast fruitiness apparent. Silky-smooth on the palate despite it's 7% alcohol content. A refreshing change of pace for the style, as most Imp.stouts feature an upfront hoppiness...this one emphasizes the malts quite nicely."
"Excellent stout. Rich carmel dark brown with tawyny tan head.  Creamy head lasts impressively long.  Slight sweet alcohol aroma nose and is also first taste.  Roasted malts follow and persist throughout.  Slightly bitter toward the end, but warm finishes warm."
"Thick caramel head on top of a jet-black appearing beer.  The malty aroma was a little on the heavy side.  The first drink offered very nice lacing and a heavy chocolate flavor.  This beer is a little too stout for my taste, but it is a well crafted beer and I would put it against any stout."
"This is what one expects in an exceptional beer. This beer has a beautiful deep black color and a rich foamy head. It has a wonderful molasses cookies character to the aroma. It's the complex tastes that make me want to keep coming back to this beer. It has a coffee-like robustness and just a hint of sweet. Even the finish is complex and develops into roasty sweetness. While this beer leaves you wanting more, with it's strength and fullness you probably won't drink these all night. This is truly a great beer."
"This stuff is excellent. Lots of chocolate, coffee and roastiness, my only complaint was the slight sweetness at the start, otherwise, world class brew, very black, with a tinge of brown, nice foamy head. Oh yaeh, and i got a bit of licorice in their aswell, interesting brew."
"Virtually jet - black in color-- you have to hold this one to a bright light to notice the deep, clear ruby edges. The dark tan head settles quickly into a thin but persistant layer. The aroma is outstanding, complex, and highly appetizing. Sweet, highly caramelized malt, vanilla notes, and sugary milk- chocolate hit the nose at first. They are followed by delectable smooth roasted unmalted barley coffee notes, mellow diacetyl butterscotch, and a hint of pruneish esters. The flavor is a superlative balance of roasted barley bitterness, perfectly calculated hop bitterness, chocolate malt, and malt deeply caramelized, anise laced sweetness from both the dark lovibond crystal malt and residual unfermented sugars. The body is dextrinous and full, but not overly rich. Finishes robustly bittersweet with lingering but pleasant diacetyl. I've forgotten how great this brew is. Although not as strong as other imperial stouts, the myriad of flavors make this brew an absolute delight. Superlatively drinkable."
"A beer for extremists - if the brewers / maltsters had roasted the malt more, we'd be talking about cremation! An excellent after dinner beer, could stand in for a cup of espresso. Aftertaste lasts forever. One bottle is enough for the evening."
"This rich, powerful, and flavorful stout has a deep chocolate color with a roasted barley nose and a noticeable burnt currant character. Serve with rich cheeses, caviar, oysters, or double-dark chocolate cookies in a brandy sniffer at 60°."
"This beer poured a very dark black color with very little light getting through it. An aroma of malt, hops and coffee. A flavor of malt, hops and coffee. The body of it is lighter than some imperials and the finish has some bitterness to itAs I probably have said before, I am a big fan of Samuel Smith, just suffer sticker shock from the price. When I was over in England and saw it in a local pub for the price of a local pint here, I jumped on it. That being said, I love stouts so my opinion may be biased. The look and taste of this is great! I rate the imperial over the oatmeal, even though both are excellant."
"You'd think you were about to drink used motor oil. Thick, nice tan head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, nuts, and hints of caramel. Not harsh at all considering the ABV. Wonderful stout."
"Believe the hype.  This is it."
"Wow!!  What a great stout.  Not for the faint of heart though.  Very dark, in fact I thought it was in a dark brown or black bottle until I poured it in a glass and saw the bottle was clear.  Sweet with traces of coffee and chocolate with a hint of alcohol but balanced mostly by the malt, tannish white head and very thick.  ""Brewed especially for Her Majesty's Forces"" the label says, maybe they leave it laying around for the unsuspecting enemy to find and then pounce on them as they search for more."
"A fantastic brew. Rich, black color with a cafe au lait head that fades to a magical ring around the liquid. A slightly spicy, chocolatey, burnt fruit taste that gives way to a smooth sweetness, finishing just a tad dry and bitter. Man oh man, is this complex. And balanced. Truly an imperial treat!"
"oh baby....pours black as molasses with a thin tan head.  fruitcake, molasses, chocolate in the nose.  huge malty mouthfeel fills your tastebuds full of sweet goodies.  there is some hop bitterness that dances on your tongue in the finish and lingers afterward.  alcohol is present but only adds to the wonderfully balanced profile.  wow is this stuff great!"
"I tasted this side by side with Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, and the two brews are very similar. I will comment on the differences. This is the denser, thicker, more lustrous of the two, and the more alcoholic which is definitely noticeable right off the bat. In fact, it dispenses with the fruity, creamy, sweet character of the milder Taddy Porter for a spicier, more solid, and ultimately more satisfying experience. Because of its strength, it stands up better to the brewery's trademark clear glass bottle. (Why, Sam, why?) This beer will definitely weigh you down and is good for the end of the night."
"Impressive black appearance with a rocky dark tan head that stays. Essence of chocolate malt and ripe prune in the nose. Feels a little grainy on the palate. Very drinkable brew that varies in taste profile from beginning to end. Excellent semi-sweet, roasted chocolate malt aftertaste. This brew is chock full of goodness. One of the best."
"Opaque black color with a huge foamy brown head and lace all the way to the bottom of the glass. Huge roasted malt aroma with coffee, bread, fruit, chocolate, and oak.  Medium to full body, slighty sweet, huge rich flavor of espresso, bitter chocolate, dark fruits (prunes, raisins, figs), and molasses.  Great hops sharpness at first, then the sweetness comes though. Followed with the roasted flavor and malts to add to the complexity. A complex brew that is well balanced. A long lasting, outstanding aftertaste that reflects the complexity of this beer. A very warming beer.  Enjoy.  Cheers."
"Top notch brew, some the best stuff on this planet. Worth the price ... a cold weather beer for me paired with a cigar."
"Truly an exceptional beer.  Smoked chocolate coffee notes, slighly bitter yet sweet.  Creamy & rich.  Pitch black like most stouts against a medium brown head.  The head slowly dissipates down to about an 1/8 inch and stays there.  Goes down like a glass of milk.  Are you worthy?"
"Liquid dark bread. Dense with lots of roasted caramel flavor. Not as creamy as some but drink it with a fork. This is the gold standard for the traditional version of the Russian Imperial Stout - there are others I like better, but this is the measure."
"Thanks to Merchant Du Vin for the fresh sample."
