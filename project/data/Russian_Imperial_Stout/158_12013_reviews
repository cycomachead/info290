"A little hoppy for my tastes for a stout. But definitely drinkable."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is pretty good and I highly recommend it. It may not be one of the strongest Imperial Stouts but it comes close."
""
""
""
"Solid beer, much more bitter than your traditional RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was BITTER. It grew on me but it was not something I would necessarily come back to."
""
""
""
""
""

"Outstanding RIS, one of my favorites and has been for years now. Runs a bit expensive though here in Jacksonville, FL unfortunately."

"O: Nice beer, but not my first choice. I'm a sucker for a nice thick and smooth stout and this provided an extra bite that might give me rabies but I doubt anyone will believe the story later. A nice way to experience something different without leaving the house."

"Great Impreial Stout, really growing to love this style of beer, especially in the winter."

"at first i thought damn this is too bitter of an ending. I continued to drink and the complexity of this beer hit me. Its a well balanced and with personality, with taste. Before  I knew it i finished and i wanted a bit more so I could unpack all the flavors in here. Overall a very good, strong beer. I can smell the chocolate now and i have a few more sips left."
"Pours a thick, opaque brownish black with a dark mocha head that lingers.  Strong chocolaty aroma.  Malty yet bitter taste with notes of chocolate.  Not much boozy taste for 9.5%.  Smooth feel. Residual bitter aftertaste.  Overall a great imperial stout."
"To hoppy for a stout.  I like hoppy beers, but it takes away from the malt complexity this could have."
"This stout is outstanding! Creamy mouth feel! Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee.. Top notch!"
""
""
""
""
"Great for this -4 day"
""
"Not a huge stout drinker but Great Divide knows what they are doing."
"This was more bitter than I had rememberes"
""
""
"Quality stout. A perfect beer on a cold night. This offers a strong, bold chocolate taste and very smooth. Great Divide is a quality brewery and this certainly lives up to their standards."
""
""
"Hoppy up front, good taste but a little sweeter than I prefer but still a very enjoyable beer"
""
""
""
"Long, strong finish of coffee and bitter licorice. The finish is just... intense. More than I love, really; and my scoring reflects that. This is a super high quality beverage that I don't personally love."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was more boozy than flavorful for me.  Tastes like vodka flavored with chocolate & some roasted barley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Wow, what another damn excellent imperial stout!  Big, bold flavors all wrapped up in a very creamy beer.  Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"Excellent stout. Light chocolate and malt aroma. Creamy, full body. Cocoa, chocolate, roasty malt, light sweetness. Bitterness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quality beer, bit too bitter for my taste."
"Glass- Snifter"
"Outstanding appearance, beautiful dark color, nice full brown head that does not dissipate quickly.  The lacing is awesome, grabs the glass and does not let go.  Exactly what you want a stout to look like.  You pick up the roast, there is a chocolate and some coffee.  You do not get the coffee and the roast in the taste but there is limited sweet malt and a touch of lingering bitter, but by no means to much.  Maybe, maybe, slightly out of balance but that is picking.  Age it and I bet that it is perfect.  Feel is a little light for a stout, I prefer them to be a little more chewy.  Overall this is an outstanding beer that I would gladly have any day."
""
""
""
"Poured from a slightly chilled 12ox bottle into a cheap Miller Lite pint glass.  Pours sort dark chocolate brown with less than a half a finger of head.  Lingered for a bit.  Decent lacing throughout.  Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and sugar..maybe molasses?  First taste is really good.  I do think it is molasses. Roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee.  Really smooth and tasty.  Hides the abv well. Aftertaste is much the same. Outstanding beer.  Definitely buying more of this."

"A tasty and complex slow-sipper."
""
""
"I'm a fan of the variants but for some reason I just didn't enjoy this one much. Harsh bitterness and somewhat thin mouthfeel. Pretty hoppy for a stout as well"
"O - A damned good stout, would be excellent on a cold winter day."

"Worth seeking out...a very enjoyable stout. My first experience was out if a bottle...looking forward to sampling out if the tap!"
""
""
""
"2012 Vintage--aged quite nicely, still had awesome carbonation, lots of chocolate, caramel, and toffee flavors"
""
""
"Pours absolutely beautiful, the looks may have overshadowed the taste, but only because of its beauty. Wonderful beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Smooth tasting stout. A little boozy on the back end. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Has a good bit of flavor and some depth.  Carries the variety well and mouthfeel fits the flavor profile. looking forward to the oak aged version I've been aging for 2 years"

"Liquid Heaven Best Stoudt Going"
""
""
""
"Drink it!!"
""
"Pours black like oil with the same viscosity, and khaki colored head. Chocolate, roasted malt, a little coffee, and some booze on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with roasted malt and raw cocoa."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In a world overpopulated with coffee/chocolate/vanilla/cream etc stouts, a traditionally brewed stout that evokes all of those flavors with nothing but barley, hops, and yeast is a breath of fresh air. The Yeti exudes a regal, ancient quality, one that really evokes the halls of czarist Russia that gave the style its name. The generous allotment of American hops counteracts the overpowering sweetness that so many Impy Stouts have, and what results is a complex, sophisticated offering perfectly represents the style while pushing it in a new, more evolved direction."
""
""
""
"It's difficult to formulate a concrete opinion of this beer. There is enough to enjoy that it must be said that it is undeniably good, but the roastiness and the sweetness seem to be in so much competition (there is a general sense of tasting a burnt espresso with too much added sugar), that they both end up becoming a tad annoying. More harmony is needed in this concoction. And as an Imperial Stout, it would be acceptable, and in this case advisable, to let the fruit and spice shine through a bit more."

"Another week, another excellent American brewed imperial stout. This one is like Larry Holmes trying to follow Muhammed Ali, while this one is very good in its own right it has a ridiculously hard act to follow in the shape of last weeks Bourbon County Stout. Despite this one not being quite in the same league as the bottle of Bourbon County that I tried last week this one is still an excellent beer & one that I'd consider picking up again were it a little more reasonably priced. The taste was definitely a good one, perhaps a little heavy on the alcohol with this one surprisingly seeming stronger than the 15% Bourbon County. I enjoyed this one & I'm anxious to get my hands on a bottle of the Oak Aged version at some point to see how it compares  to this one"

"Overall: An excellent imperial stout, complex and thoroughly enjoyable. The perfect winter warmer, to be sipped by the fire with a mild cheese (mozzarella)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this comes off as an imperial stout for IPA connoisseurs.  The presentation is gorgeous and the malt profile is fine, but the abundance of hops takes it outside of my comfort zone.  Admirable boldness notwithstanding, this isnâ€™t a stout I would gravitate toward as a course of habit."

"O -A smooth easy drinking RIS"
""
"O- Overall this was pretty good. I'm surprised that it took me so long to finally try this. I picked up one 12 oz. bottle from my local beverage center. I wish I had tried this two years ago when I was on an imperial stout kick. For some reason I haven't been impressed with the style lately and I really no longer have the desire to try new beers in the style. I guess my palette has changed as Brooklyn Black Chocolate was once my favorite beer. I now have no desire to drink it. I'd rather have a good porter in the 5-7% range. Although I've maintained the desire to drink a good, strong barley wine the rich, bold flavors of imperial stouts are a bit much for my palette at this time...I suppose it could change though as I used to like IPA's and DIPA's but about a year ago I really couldn't take the happiness for about a whole year, now, recently I've been drinking a lot of IPA's. I guess I have an ever-changing palette!"

"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of roasted malt, toast, dark fruit, alcohol and cacao.  Body is full, creamy and smooth.  Taste is of nutty, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops.  Finish is long and bitter. Great RIS."
""
""
""
"This is the standard against which all imperial stouts shall be judged! Are there better well yes. But this is an easily obtainable gem that can be found in almost any serious craft beer section.. it pours motor oil with heavy lacing and tastes of smoky complexity this stout is best enjoyed on the warm side of chilled.. This is a go to imperial stout that shouldn't be overlooked and at 9.5%abv it'll do the trick quite nicely"

"Was able to snag a couple on a trip. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a thin khaki head. Has deep scents of coffee and espresso as well as dark chocolate. The taste had these great highlights although it also had a nice clean finish as well as a deep nutty flavor. One of my all time favorites."
""
"Epitome of what a stout should be!"
"Overall - This is an outstanding beer, nonetheless, deserving of its place on the Beers of Fame. Highly recommended, a good mix for lovers of stouts and the hoppier beers. Best offering I have ever had from GDBC."

"O. Overall the Yeti is like  making love to a seasoned cougar. A night with this fine dark beautifully aged women will ruin you for any future experience to come. When I die put a bottle of this in my coffin too usher me into the afterlife. What else do I have to say, denounce your God and worship the Yeti. Slightly above average buzz for 9.5% ABV"
""
"Extremely rich and flavorful. It may have a bit too much going on, but I definitely prefer this to sweeter RIS's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The color is ink black. The thin head is a light brown mocha color. Smells roast and toasty. Vanilla, coffee, chocolate,  slight hop presence, and a little booze. The taste is fantanstic. Thick,  creamy,  sweet. It has a burnt flavor like roasted marshmallows that I enjoy very much. Maybe too much hop flavor, but that's the only flaw, and really not that bad of a thing. I might want to age it to mellow out the alcohol flavor and the hop presence."

"One of my favorite beers"
"Overall: Excellently balanced stout, roastiness and bitterness from charred malts seemlessly blends with sweet chocolates and creamy caramel notes. More subtle flavors such as coffee, vanilla, and hops compliment as well. Truly a beautiful visual in the glass as well, this beer hits on all style points."

"I really like this one.  One of the better Imperials I've had.  I see what the fuss is all about."
""
"This is an outstanding brew."
"Ah yes, the classic imperial stout.  Great Divide makes a fine version of this one, no doubt.  They have a few different takes on it, but this is the original version, and it'll do when you want a solid, heavy beer.  Goes great with beef or other hearty dishes.  This is another very popular offering from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Overall with everything said and done it is very good. I would recommend this to anyone as a go-to RIS if that's the flavor of the night. I have had the Espresso variant and prefer it to this one without a doubt."

"Overall a delightful imperial stout, heavy and delicious."

"BOD 6/17/14.  Pours dark as a starless night.  Very good head with exceptional lacing and very good retention. Rich nose of dark chocolate, very little roast character, over a nice citrus hop background with only a hint of coffee.  As it warms, light vanilla notes are noticed.  Rich full body with a creamy texture.  Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is complex, but the alcohol is not well hidden.  It begins with rich dark chocolate that flows into notes of coffee coupled with vanilla over a rich malt sweetness.  Roast is noted in the middle over a citric hop flavor and mild bitterness.  The smooth finish is dominated by alcohol and leaves a warm back of throat burn and a burnt sugar lingering aftertaste.  Dial the alcohol back a bit and this one becomes outstanding."
"coffee, malty, dark....I would like to start my day with this beer."
""
""
""
"I have a soft spot for cryptozoology, so its name piqued immediately. This was my first sampling from the Great Divide Brewing Company. A pretty good test to how tall this company stands. Yeti provides an excellent serving of hops to its Imperial Stout tradition. A dark, frothy ale best served cold and as soon as purchased. Personally, I enjoy it right before a movie in bed."
"Drank this from the cask at Falling Rock Ale House in Denver.  Perfect temp brought out the many layers of this exceptional Imperial Stout.  This is a treat!"

"Big,big, big  imperial stout.  Love the chocolate layering. Milk and dark.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big beer with a huge load of dark malts and plenty of hops as well. Enough coffee in the flavor to suggest there's actually some in here.  Rich, very dark roast flavor."
"Very roasty, full and flavoursome. Some choc but doesn't get near the roasts. Reasonably bitter finish. Carbonation low and smooth body."

"O: This is a very good example of an Imperial stout that makes no false claims. It's big, bold and huge on the roasted malt character. There is just enough bitterness and alcohol to clean up the malty body. It has notes of coffee and chocolate and is very well balanced, but lacks significant amounts of specialized textures and flavors that you might find in another imperial stout. It's very good, easy to drink and is consistent with its flavors throughout its temperature range. Solid A."

"O: I see this around A LOT and I've recently been trying to stop myself from IPA binging, so I decided to grab something different that seems to be a crowd favorite. Two sips in, I understand the praise. This is one serious stout! It's nothing overly complex, but when you execute flavors THIS well, who needs off-the-wall recipes? I tip my hat to the folks at Great Divide, for they've hit it out of the park with this imperial stout."

"This was a great imperial stout. Everything I wanted it to be, but nothing more. No surprises. Nice smooth silky mouthfeel and light carbonation. Earthy, chewy, sweet, and bitter. Hazelnut coffee with a weird hint of mint? I like it. Served a little too cold though."

"o: I aged this bottle for about eight months, no way to know for sure what that did for it or to it, but it's a very tasty imperial stout treat now. Strong flavors and aftertastes. Probably would go well with a good cigar and/or a sharp cheese. Mellows out beautifully to the end."
""
""
""
"My database indicates that I have only previously had the oak-aged Yeti in bottles in 2010 and that I was unimpressed. Obviously there have been some changes in my palate since then. Yeti seems to be a lower priced version of TenFidy, but nearly as good, sort of like Ford and Mercury."

"dark black pour with a creamy brown head. smell of chocolate and roasty malts and quite in your face and big. real rich. taste of burnt bittersweet chocolate and a lot of roasty notes. very true to style and drinkable. body is almost full and carbonation is very on point. its definitely a great beer. recommended."
""

""
""

"Overall a killer brew, with an ABV to match! Would pick up again."
""

"Overall - I wouldn't call this an RIS. To me it's more along the lines of an American Impy... And I'll be honest, I really like this beer, but I don't love it. I'm a sucker for brutality in my Impies, and this thing just doesn't have it. It's incredibly smooth, balanced and delicious, but it lacks that kick-in-the-teeth depth of flavor and bitterness that makes Impys so damn delicious. In summary: if you like smooth, well-balanced stouts, you can't go wrong with this one. If you like 'em rough and punchy and you're looking for a fight tonight, move along."
"Yeti pours a black color with a nice tan head. There is a strong alcohol aroma, good notes of chocolates, subtle notes of black licorice. Taste is very similar, good notes of black licorice, chocolate notes, very creamy, and a nice but noticeable alcohol finish. Good full flavors, nice feel, good warmth from the alcohol. Overall a very good flavorful stout."
""
"Overall: this is a great example of the style. unfortunately for me I am not the biggest fan of the espresso and hoppy stout flavors. next bottle I get is spending years in the cellar before i return to this one. Overall I would highly recommend this beer"
""
"O- This beer is insane. Decadent is the only word I can pull out at the moment. Every aspect being rated is superb on its own, but when you mix them all together, things just stop making sense. I'm going to go order some Yeti merch now."
""
""
""
"Very solid imperial stout that I would highly recommend for anyone that likes intense dark flavors and a thick, full mouthfeel. Not as good as the Espresso Oak Aged version but excellent nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't the world's biggest stout. But it is one of the nicest. Excellent."
""
""
""
"O- I love this beer, despite thinking it wouldn't be as good as the Oak-aged, the taste really impressed me. I loved the sensation that seemed to be from the lactose. My only complaint was a slight acidity and bitterness. Still good though."
""
""
""
"O - not disappointed. Only knock would be its slight booziness... But it's an imperial, so what do you expect, right? Great imp stout."

"Overall this is a nice try but it is not as refined as other Imperial Stouts. The bitterness and alcohol dominate to the point of detracting from the chocolate and coffee tastes. Maybe it will mellow out if stored for a while."
""
""

"Pours a slick, motor oil black with a fine tannish film which recedes quickly to a collar. Aroma is roasted malt, roasted malt, roasted malt. Some dark chocolate and black molasses provide a bit of balancing, but this is mostly just a big, malty beer. Taste is again big roasted malt, though a firm undercurrent of hops provides some bitterness, along with slight molasses and chocolate on the end, with a long finish featuring more hoppy bitterness. Full bodied, medium carbonation, slick on the tongue. This is tasty but a bit one-dimensional, and my personal preference is against roasty/hoppy RISs."
"O: A meal unto itself. I don't think that drinking more than one of these is much of an option. Well balanced, loads of flavor. A solid imperial stout."

"Pours as black as motor oil and the head is a very dark brown, very wicked looking. Smell is a mix of coffee, milk chocolate, macadamia nuts and brownies. Much the same in the flavor but has more of a bitter coffee & dark chocolate overtone. Thick and rich, it easily coasts the mouth with a real long feel. An excellent RIS at an excellent price."

"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Deep dark color. Not much of a head at all. Lots of tiny bubbles and more carbonation than the average stout. Not much retention or lacing. On the nose, chocolate/vanilla/bourbon scents are evident. Smells more boozy than it tastes. On the palate, dark chocolate and coffee roast are strong. Malt and alcohol are subdued. Mouthfeel is ample, more full and lingering than most. Alcohol burn becomes more evident on the backside. My hunch is that this would benefit greatly from some aging -- would soften the bite, smooth out the flavor profile, and allow sweeter chocolates to emerge. Will definitely revisit this one after some time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall interesting, def need to try it again fresh and review notes, but a nice aged feel to it and still very tasty."
""
"Overall: This beer had A LOT of flavor, but lacked the complexity I seek in a RIS. Glad I tried it, but won't repeat. Will be trying the oak aged and chocolate oak versions though soon."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the best imperial stout, nor the best non-barrel aged imperial stout, but a damn good one, and it really makes me want to try the barrel aged yeti. I'd say it's better than the belgian yeti, not as good as the espresso, oatmeal or chocolate yetis."

"Pours a very dark reddish brown. Creamy milk chocolate head that hangs around a bit. Heavy lacing. Chocolate, coffee and malt aroma. Dark chocolate, coffee and alcohol explode. Nice, nice bitterness. Coats the tongue. This is nearly a perfect stout. It's complex, but everything comes together so well."
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall: After so many years of lugging this bottle around I expected a mess. Instead, big notes of smooth chocolate malts. Stick one in your closet and wait. This is a solid stout fresh, but with some time it's basically a chocolate desert."

"Poured on-tap and served in a stemmed vase, the beer is a jet black coloring, oil-like. Dark tan head, clingy all over the glass, with a great lacing left behind as you drink. Nose of roasted grains, smoke, bittersweet chocolate, bitter coffee, booze, and molasses. Great aromas! Flavors are huge, with cocoa nibs, coffee, and booze all over the palate, with earthy highlights. Rich, heavy, velvety body, with a bitter, smoked, roasted aftertaste. The finish is bitter and smooth, with enough linger to remind you what you're missing in between sips. Fantastic!"

"Appearance and the beer is pitch black with a one finger head. The head is one of the nicest ive seen with a mahogany color. The aroma is a pretty strong consisting of hops and coffee, and very little chocolate. The taste matches the scent pretty well as this is a hoppier stout with a tiny bit of citrus in the taste. The chocolate presence is very low, but at the same time this isnt a strong coffee brew. The mouthfeel isnt too thick or syrupy which lends to a nice drinkability. Overall this is a well balanced and unique beer. One of the most pleasant surprises is the lack of an alcohol presence, which is something that I had seen in reviews was present. At only two months old there was only a slight bit of alcohol when cold, but when warm there was no trace. Definitely a top tier beer that demands at least a try. (93/100)"

"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute--it pours thick and dark, and reminds me of grandma pouring nasty medicine into a spoon. Lovely finger and a half tan head, then beautiful lacing. Held up to an intense xenon kitchen track light--pure black, no light penetrates. Aroma is thick and sank--coffee, a bit of molasses, and I think dome alfalfa hay from the barn--a unique and intriguing aroma. Flavor is coffe, toffee, a bit of molasses, a bit of fruit, and the hops bitterness comes afterward and wafts up into your nose. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. Overall this is an outstanding stout, one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""

"The feel is not nearly as creamy as the appearance would have suggested but it's dry, easy and full. There's absolutely no evidence of 9 plus ABV which held make this truly special."

"There is a lot of hype surrounding the Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout and now I know why. In full disclosure, my sample had aged for about 18 months. The Yeti poured a deep opaque brown with minimal dark tan head. The aroma was straight up semi-sweet chocolate, just like the Nestle morsels. The initial tastes were a bit bitter as it was still cold, but as it warmed the Yeti turned into a deep semi-sweet chocolate wonderland. This brew definitely benefited from a warming drinking temperature. Underneath the chocolate notes were hints of a roasted coffee and a smokey nuttiness that finished with a caramel and toffee sweetness. I believe the hype! The Yeti is an incredible stout and a fantastic drinking experience."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was creamy and stuck to your mouth, in a good way. Very thick, and made me want more. The finish was deep, instilling a roasted coffee flavor. The alcohol was extremely well hidden."

"I honestly love this simple, drinkable, rich Imperial Stout. A solid, ageable beer, need more."
"I bought this last year- was not impressed and left a few in the fridge. Now I know this carries spectacular ratings and I wanted to give this some time before I dissed it. I felt when young, this was very chalky and way too bitter. Exactly one year has passed and this still has enough hop strength carrying over to balance with the malt sweetness to make just short of a perfect Imperial Stout. I have an Oak Aged raring to go on one year also. This is a brew for me that keeps it interesting and teaches me not to be too judgmental when it comes to Imperial Stouts. Bottom line, age this, experiment, and enjoy! Chewy enough to say 'Bon Appetite'!"

"O: Real pumped to have found this on tap locally. And to have it served in a pint glass for $6.95 isn't bad either. Perfect balance of flavor for the style and a winner in my book."

"When the weather starts to cool and/or I get in the mood for some stout, I will definitely be going back to this one. A really good brew, and though the 9.5% ABV is ever-present, it's never overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"This was an extraordinary stout that realized each of it's many flavors to a deep fullness and harmonious complexity. The hop character made it boisterous. You linger over a stout and this one kept intensifying. Generous and evocative."

"Remarks: I didn't score A, S, T, M at that time, so please disregard those scores"
""
""
"Full body, thick and creamy, coating your mouth with a sip."
""
""
"A very nice stout. For me, if the bitterness were toned way down, it would almost be perfect, as it is in most areas. I'm just not a fan of too much metallic hop bitterness in my stouts. But this is definitely a very solid beer."

"Pours a jet black with nice full thick tan head that lingers and clings quite a bit to the sides of the snifter sides. Smells of roast, caramel and toffee. Earthy hop aroma with wades of cocoa. Starts off sweet with waves of chocolate, roast, some vanilla, and some light oak like flavors. Feels luscious with creamy feel and ample bitterness. One of my favorite brews. I love the other Yeti brews to a T. This one is great. Just seems a little substandard compared with the the specialty Yeti beers."

"Iâ€™ve had the Oak Aged, Chocolate OA, and Espresso OA Yetis. This isnâ€™t far from it. For me, Oak Aged and Chocolate hid that strange bitterness on the end much better than this or Espresso. The bitterness stands out in this and sort of messes up the beer for me. Not my kind of beer. Itâ€™s not poorly made, but not really for me."

"Really great RIS. Lots of great stuff going on here. There's plenty of chocolate, toffee and sweet milk notes, as well as notes of port wine and leather. Great mouthfeel, nice and smooth while still having a small bite at the end (for an RIS). I actually almost prefer this more than the Espresso Oak aged version which I tried side by side with this for the first time. This really is an awesome beer, but not my favorite of the style. It's really good, but it didn't WOW me (I was expecting it to be good anyway.) Due to the fact that it's impossible to get in my area I probably wont be going out of my way to seek this out again seeing as though there are just so many other things I want to try out there. All in all good beer though."

"Yeti has a magnificent obsidian color with a voluminous mocha colored head. Tons of lacing left on the glass. The aroma draws comparisons to bakers chocolate, new leather, port wine, and creamy milk. To my delight, the flavor is very chocolatey, along with some earthy wood and tobacco notes. Surprisingly a fair amount of hops are included in the mixture. The finish is tart and bitter. I appreciate the heavy, velvety mouthfeel, and the warming sensation of the high ABV. Definitely a must try when in the mood for a bold RIS."

Suggests food pairings, lists the IBUs, has a clear bottling date, nice texture, and a spot on description of what you're getting yourself into.

"Final Thoughts: Yet another enjoyable brew by Great Divide. The brewers obviously know how to make a good Imperial Stout. I'd recommend this beer to anyone who has not tried this style and is looking for a jumping off point. Yeti Imperial Stout is a good example of an Imperial Stout can be great without any extra bells and whistles. Have it with or without a meal as it can serve as one on its own. Would I drink it again? Yes, cellaring a few to see how it ages."
""
""
"O-This is another great Yeti. I don't think I like this Yeti as much as the Oaked version, but I slot this ahead of the Espresso version. For me, the hop presence in this Yeti adds balance, if a little bit of bitterness, to a nice malt profile. Extra points here for style as this is a great looking beer. I enjoyed drinking this on a cold (it is 13 friggin degrees outside) April night and will certainly drink this brew again."

""
"This bottle was aged for a year and went down super easy; I need to get some more and try it fresh to maximize the hop flavor. Well balanced, but yet very powerful, this was incredibly tasty and enjoyable like the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti Stout. Great Divide makes some great beers and I highly recommend trying this."

"D- I thought the ""real"" yeti would be lighter colored to blend in with the snow? Apparently not this time. Ominous and black, seeping and angry, and absorbing all whiteness from anything in both appearance and flavor, this a bad ass and fun brew that I'm glad to keep in my roster however it's psycho hoppiness can become tiresome I mean, burps taste like a DIPA and that's just absurd. The barrel aged version has some serious tits tho."
"O: This is a good stout. I think stouts might be falling out of favor with me though. Overall, the taste and flavor is quite good, but I am still new to stouts; so, I am less knowledgeable about the nuances. It does smell delicious though."
"Overall I think this is one of the most bitter RIS's I have had, but you still get plenty of malt, chocolate, and coffee. Very interesting and delicious."
""

""
""

"O - One of my favorite RIS's. So much flavor, so many variations. May be the most well balanced RIS out there. I've had the oak version and it beats the base for me, but what a base beer. I believe in the Yeti."

""
""
""

"O: One of the best easily available year-round RISes. Pretty much a staple of any RIS lover, along with Old Raspy and Ten Fidy (in my opinion). If I'm honest I prefer the oak and chocolate versions a lot more but it's hard to ignore this one. Good complexity, good balance of flavor and goes down easily. All at a good price point and easy availability. Can't ask for much more."
"This beer is very good. I like it a lot. I'm very surprised I haven't reviewed it before."

"Overall: A really great stout. Very bold with the dark malts and a bigger hop presence than what is typical for a stout. Hops are very big when this is fresh."

"O - If it were not called a RIS I might be more receptive, drinks more like an English ale/Stout hybrid. Stouts are my favorite styles right now and this one is on the lower end of my tastes. I much prefer the oak aged version of Yeti, but I'm still not excited by either version."

"Overall- I fell in love with this brewery when I visited and this brew when I tasted. I'll admit I'm partial to the imperial stout."

"Definitely a tasty and impressively massive Imperial Stout, and an experience to savor."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - compared to a lot of other imperial stouts this has a very smooth flavor and the 1.5 years aging has made it quite exquisite. Considerably smooth given it was once 75 IBUs and overloaded with hops."

"Poured into a Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark, opaque brown, appearing black in the glass. Thin brown head with good retention and light lacing. Good Russian imperial stout aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, dark dried fruit and a hint of coffee. Flavor follows aroma, with well integrated dark toasted malt, chocolate and light brown sugar and dark dried fruit. Finishes with toasted malt and a perfect hop kick. Medium bodied with creaminess. A very nicely integrated, flavorfull RIS that has been a long time favorite. I was surprised to see that I had never reviewed this before. A standby, favorite stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well I've got a new favorite stout, it's been far to long since I've enjoyed a bottle of this world class stout. This beer has layers of rich flavor from dark grains giving chocolate and coffee with some sweetness the balanced by a firm hops bitterness. this beer just brings ton of flavor sip after delightful sip."
""

""
""
""
""
"As an aside, I always laugh when people say ""A good beer, but not as good as other RIS's."" I call bullshit on that one. Notice that nobody ever actually NAMES the other RIS's that are supposedly superior. For me, the closest peer to Yeti is Founders Imperial Stout, but it's just about a tie. Slightly different, but equally high in quality. Don't listen to anyone that uses B.S. to justify their rating. Show your experience or shut the hell up."
""
"Carbonation is milder with the 2011 release, but this beer honestly could age for far longer. I'm not sure it would improve this brew, it's not a giant stout that's too boozy or too hoppy. Great Divide hit this one on the head."

"O â€“ This beer is just a comedy of contrasts, and a dream of an imperial stout. Itâ€™s for someone who loves outrageous stouts that are loaded with not only malt but hops as well. It is one of the best things that I have ever had, and one of my favorite all time beers. I look forward to many, many more of these."
"O: Really good Russian Imperial stout. I slightly creamier mouthfeel would have made it even better, but not a complaint."
"Edit1: I have now had much better stouts but interms of a readily available year round stout and a great base beer for varieties this is a really quality beer, but I did have it regarded too high in terms of numbers so I lowered some of my rankings."

""
""
""
"O-good RIS. Not a category leader but a solid choice"
""
""
""
""
"O-a solid RIS but not as good a some others in this category"
"O - Me and this beer will meet again. Pleasant, strong, interesting and enjoyably drinkable, this beer is about as reliable a stout as you could hope for."
"Yeti is big. Yeti is strong. Yeti could live in cave, get old, be wise."
"This is a good RIS, but compared to others in the style, it's not exceptional. Very burnt, very roasty, but not much else. Worth a try, but there are better, similarly accessible standards."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. The aromatics were bold, sweet, warming, and inviting all in one. The froth and stickiness to the mouth was equally as pleasant, adding to the tactile portion of the experience. It is easy to see why this is the base for such a fantastic Russian Imperial series, as the flavors follow nicely. It does lean towards the bitter side, but completely within the stylistic guidelines, making for a tasty, winter treat."
"D - In some ways this stout is simple and straightforward, without a great deal of complexity or depth to the profile (although given the style it's naturally quite complex still). But it's the unique resinous earthy flavor that still sets this apart from most other stouts, which to me fits perfectly with the concept behind the brew (Yeti) and the geographic location of the brewery. Altogether this makes for a superb stout that I hope to seek out again."

"Opaque black color with a finger or so of frothy mocha head; decent retention and lacing. Typical stout qualities in the nose, dark roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and additionally, some definite hops notes. More of the same in the taste, roast, sweet malts, coffee and bakers' chocolate, caramel, resinous hop notes contributing a lasting bitterness, with a somewhat mineral aftertaste. Body is on the fuller side of medium. It's not an out-of-this-world stout, but it's a solid brew and quite drinkable overall. It makes a good base beer for some of GD's more adventurous selections."
"Pours a opaque black with a fluffy dark beige two finger head. Fantastic retention and a considerable amount of lacing coats the inside of the glass. Dark fruit, wood, chocolate and booze on the nose. Opens with overripe black cherry and plum joined by vanilla, dark chocolate and roastiness midpalate. Finishes with dark roast malted and espresso-accented bitterness. Full bodied, well carbonated, slick and creamy. An exceptional Russian Imperial Stout that delivers everything a brew in the style should."

"Overall: I love the nose and the upfront chocolatey taste, I just wish the hops that it boasts on the side shined through a bit more."
"Overall a really good imperial stout. I will definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer when Iâ€™m in the mood for it, and I enjoy the Chocolate and Espresso variations even more."
"Overall - This is an excellent Imperial Stout, even with it's minor flaws which are easy to overlook. I'm very eager to get my hands on the other Yeti offerings from Great Divide, because I know if they are anything like this, then I know I'm in for a treat."
""
""
"O: I had heard rave reviews about this beer from some of my friends and it is definitely near the top of my list for an imperial stout. While many other similar beers will have similar attributes, not all are as well put together as this beer."
""
""
"O: This beer's a beast, but a subtle one. Nuanced and delicious. Powerful, but strangely tender. Yeti wants to love you, but will crush you if you're not careful."
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes of rich, heavy black roasted malt and coffee, molasses, tobacco, and an abundance of herbal / earthy hopping and medium amounts of dark fruits (plums, figs) and cocoa powder. A light amount of ABV booziness is present but it doesn't detract so much as it amplifies the dark fruits that are present. As it warms up, the hopping does become a tiny bit detracting from the coffee and char malts, but it's not a very big issue on my account. Also, the tobacco elements amplify with temperature gain in a linear fashion that helps to keep the sweetness levels in check."
""
""
"This beer caught me by surprise with it's bitter after taste that was so good that my wife, which has never had a stout, really liked it. What a great brew from the near black hole color to the cocoa toffee caramel flavor with a bit of almost burnt malts that hits all the senses: great for a cool night by the fire!"

"Black pour with nice light brown head. Smells a bit smokey with hints of toasted almonds. Nice malty backbone that balances out the hops. Pretty decent mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated, but not super rich and creamy. Really solid base that works well with all sorts of variations. The oak aged version is still my favorite though."
""
""
""
"O: I have been having a lot of IPAs recently and it is good to get back to a good stout as a change of pace. I'll be looking to have this one again."
"A world class brew no doubt and I think a beer of this caliber would pair nicely with Frampton's live recording of Do you feel like I do."

"Pours black with a brown head. A good looking RIS. Smells roasted and earthy. A little bit of espresso on the nose as well as some wood. Tastes roasty. Coffee and bitter chocolate are there. A lot of hop bitterness too. A warm alcohol finish. Body is thick and carbonation is light."
""
"O - My first review of the Yeti series and I was impressed (seemed like the only logical place to start). I look forward to trying the variants. Good combination of sweet and smokey, which I look for in an RIS. Alcohol is well hidden and drinks easily. Hard to come by when I was living in PA, but I will definitely get this one regularly in DE."

"Overall, I have to say was a bit of a disappointment. Not that it was bad, but I expected more from this highly hyped beer. That being said, though, I can not find anything wrong with it. I suppose it's almost in the higher end of it's genre, but still lacking somewhat in complexity. Would try again."

"Thanks are due to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. This was bottled on February 21, 2012, so this is still very young. Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a two-finger length dark brown head that retains well. The head dissipates very slowly. Lacing is left down the glass as the head dissipates. There are big aromas of dark roasted barley malt and chocolate. It has a bready and slightly earthy smell. I can't detect the alcohol in the aroma, which is a plus for such a high ABV beer. The flavor follows the nose. The roasted malt flavor is very prominent and there is creamy chocolate in there as well. There's bitterness on the back end as well as roastiness. It's mildly sweet as well. I can pick up some of the alcohol, but it's masked very well. The body is full with adequate carbonation. It is creamy and smooth. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and yet another great RIS. For someone just getting into this style, this is one that should be recommended."
"This is a legendary beer that is well-known to fans of big, roasty stouts. As with any huge RIS, I would not suggest this to someone new to the craft beer scene. Fans of the style should (and do) seek this out. I'll probably get another 4-pack for the cellar."

"Yeti, what is there to say? Pours jet black, can't see any light coming through, and has a nice brown head on top. Looks thick! Aroma of big chocolate, lots of roast, and still a definite hop presence. A slight roast-hop combination bitterness up front on the tongue that mellows into chocolate sweetness on the way down. A bit of roasted grain and sweet chocolate lingers on the palate. Finishes with some more bitterness. Big thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Oh yeah. Well done."
""
""
"OVERALL: Exceptional is a good word for this beer. While all the other flavors of the Yeti are delicious as well, this is a classic that is worth returning to again and again. It should age quite nicely as well. This is a complex beer that should be sipped slowly and savored. Each and every sip will reveal something different if you take the time to pay attention."
""
"DOA"
""
""
"Overall - Like a lot of RIS's I'm always very impressed until the finish, which is usually a bit hot, as it is in the case. This might be amazing aged another 6 months (it's only been about 3 according to the bottle date.) Still, a very good RIS."
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't get why this is so well regarded. I can think of quite a few readily available RIS's that are much better than this. I'm interested to see how the various treatments of this taste."
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty unique imperial stout. At first glance and sniff, it seems like itâ€™s going to be par for the course. However, upon tasting this thing, you realize that itâ€™s not like most other imperial stouts. Thereâ€™s a tremendous amount of hop bitterness for the style. After thinking about it, those plums and raisins that I caught in the aroma may have actually been fruity and floral hop aromas. Normally, Iâ€™m a total hop head, but it just doesnâ€™t seem to fit here. This is a still a good stout that looks great and has a great mouthfeel. Definitely worth a try. Iâ€™ll have to get around to trying all of the variations of this beer that Great Divide puts out."

"the famous and acclaimed yeti! not a cheap 4pack. pours a very thick syrupy almost black brown with a surprisingly large mocha bubbly head a few inches high. smells like espresso and molasses right up front, bittersweet with a touch of spice. also the high alcohol content is obvious. flavor is large and complex, melted dark chocolate runs into licorice notes and a strong coffee finish. the beer is also rather sweet, especially as it gets warmer in the glass. its almost too sweet as it goes on. booze presents itself too. feel is very full bodied, and a little syrupy. the carbonation is very tame, which is stypical of the style. overall i like this a lot, and even better than some of the specialty yeti beers. this is an excellent imperial stout if you dont mind the sweeter finish."

"O: a good impy stout overall. Lots of nice roasted characters, though could use more complexity."

"Wanted very much to enjoy this beer more than I did. But I feel like I've had better stouts. Maybe the 72% cacao w/ expresso nibs chocolate bar I accompanied withh the brew wasn't the right choice (too sweet)? Or I was just thinking about the review too much... All in all, maybe I just need to try and enjoy this beer more than once."

"A dark brown appearance, bordering on black, with a thumbs width brown head. Nice lacing. A rich aroma of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasted barley, and a touch of alcohol hiding in there. Flavor wise, off the bat you get the roasted barley paired with some sweetness from some liquorice, chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit, towards the end a nice healthy hit of hoppy bitterness introduces itself and carries though into the finish. The alcohol hides itself pretty well but not completely. Medium bodied to this with a creamy feel though not the most impressive mouthfeel for the style. Overall, this is a big beer and a sipper. It's definitely the best beer I have tried from Great Divide. I'm going to have to give their Oak Aged Yeti a 2nd shot after this, I liked the Oaked when I initially tried it but I am sure a second go of it will be even better. Also going to have to try their Chocolate Yeti. Also...LET THIS BEER WARM."

"12oz bottled on 1/30/2012. Pours opaque black with a milk chocolatey colored, foamy head that is quick to dissipate but leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are rich and sweet with dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, and somewhat boozy. Tastes are also rich and bold with notes of rich dark chocolate and creamed dark coffee, while finishing peppery with a load of piny, bitter hops. Mouth-feel is medium-to-full bodied, while being creamy yet oily on the palate. The real treat in this one is when it warms to room temperature; fruity esters reveal flavors of dark fruits, plum, and cherry. Balance is extraordinary as all the complexities battle on the palate. Alcohol is warming. Overall, great example of the style and definitely recommendable."
"O: A superior sipper. Goes head to head with Old Rasputin. Even better near room temperature. Try with a nib of Nestle's chocolate."
"Overall, wow, this is delicious - one of the best Imperial Stouts out there. The flavors work incredible together. This is a A+ brew. This must be insane on tap. I'm going to try to get my hands on some of the different variations of the Yeti's."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 2/18/2011. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense tan head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some great soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa powder, caramel, roasted coffee, biscuit, molasses, roasted malt, nuttiness, and light herbal hops. Incredible aromas here with great balance and complexity. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, biscuit, caramel, toast, molasses, dark coffee, herbal spiciness, and nuttiness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, coffee, herbal spiciness, and toast on the finish for a while. Great flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a huge creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9.5% with only a faint warming after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial stout; and has lived up to the expectations of the last time I had it as well. I need to buy more of this just to keep around and age."
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though it is fairly fresh there is nothing really offputting. Maybe some age would take off some of the bitterness and I could see rating it higher. A very well made Imperial. Paired it with some dark chocolate(albeit Hersheys) towards the end of the bottle, and it doesnâ€™t really meld all that well. Oh well."

"From the 22 oz. bottle marked Bottled on Oct. 03 2011. Sampled on February 29, 2012 - Leap Day. A special beer for a special day I guess. It pours black as a moonless night with loads of fluffy, mocha head that slowly simmers down but never disappears totally. Chocolate malts and coffee take center stage with the aroma as well as a bit of yeast and a drip of forest green pine hops. The body is bold yet also very smooth. The taste is much like the aroma with a notable chocolate presence but an incredibly bitter and dry hop finale. Nicely balanced."

This is one of those beers that all Imperial Stout lovers have to try, knowing all along that itâ€™s a slow sipping and highly enjoyable, Imperial Stout. The 9.5% ABV is so well hidden. Great Divide knows how to brew some of the tastiest Imperial Stouts Iâ€™ve ever had. Well done!!!"

"O- this is a great brew. like the rest of the Great Divide brews ive had the pleasure to try everything is blended so well. ive enjoyed this fairly fresh (within a month or two of bottling date) and also have had some that was aged a year. with aging i noticed the carbonation was more subtle and the chocolate seemed to come through a lot more. Yeti is a delicious, dependable RIS that wont let you down."
"Picked up a bottle from world market. Pours a deep dark black color with a mocha head. No light whatsoever gets through this one, and that is what I expect from an imperial stout. The smell is amazing, a nice milk chocolate character, some nice resinous hops in the aroma, and also a slight nuttiness. The taste is assertively bitter with a mix of chocolately roasted malts and piny hops, there is a nice thick body to this beer which I enjoy. But Cigar City Marshal Zhukov's still has one up on this beer in my opinion. Still a very solid imperial stout for those who like there stouts with some hop bitterness."

"The Yeti Imperial Stout is brewed in Colorado at the Great Divide Brewing Co, and is like its namesake, a big hairy beast. At first glance I thought that it was going to be a little fatter than I was ready for, but it grows on you quick. This drink pours thick, dark and heavy, and foams like a science experiment gone awry. It smells heady and rich â€“ a cocoa, toffee, coffee. Initially, upon appearance, I thought that this beverage would be too malty and cloying. And while a mouthful is dense and lingering it is not overpowering or intrusive. Itâ€™s a good example of a full, well balanced Russian Imperial Stout, and with a 9.5% alcohol itâ€™ll warm you up on a cold winterâ€™s night."

"This is probably the best example of a regular imperial stout in tne world. This is the style that this brewery is known for. Its absolultely dynamite. Tons of coffee flavors fighting woth deep dark chocolate. The flavors are dominating and take over your mout. This is a great afters dinner drink or pair it up with a chcoclate death dessert. I love this beer and the whole series. Great job great divide. You hit alot of homeruns with me."
""
"O- Not many ""everyday"" stouts are better than this IMHO! Hell, this is better than most once a year, limited Imperial Stouts! I really wish this was available in NY where I live! It used to be... Please come back Great Divide... I miss you!!!"
"Overall - Will be purchasing this again. Great flavor!"
""

"T: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, charred wood, espresso, a faint trace of hops and a touch of sweetness near the finish. Pretty great stuff."

"O: a favorite and go to of mine when im in the mood for a good stout, also try the bourbon ages yeti."

"As expected, this beer poured a deep black color. The alcohol come through in both smell and taste, but is complemented nicely by the heavy malt tones. Incredibly drinkable for the 9.5 ABV. Perfect cold weather beer, my only qualm is that it does not do much to separate itself from its Imperial Stout siblings."

"The beer is opaque and dark brown with a thin layer of beige head that fades rapidly. The aroma offers dark roast, licorice, hints of chocolate. Tasty beer, well balanced. Delicious roast character, though I prefer Oak Aged Yeti, which offers a bolder flavor and more complexity. Again, not as smooth as the oaked version, but still very enjoyable. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, a solid beer."

"o - untamed? not so much. imposing? absolutely. definitely one of the biggest flavors i have ever had in a ris. so rich i don't think i could have more than one bottle in a night. delicious and enjoyable though."
""
""
"Overall: it's brilliant. I'll be back for more. I should also note that I like the simplicity of this one compared to it's oak aged brother."
"One of the better readily available imperial stouts around. Very smooth and chocolately."
""
""
""
""
"A good stout. The RIS-style is quite new to me but I like this one. Unfortunatly Great Divide will be the next American brewer on the long list of breweries that have stopped exporting to Europe, or atleast The Netherlands."
""
""
""
"O - RIS are my favorite style and this one is one of the best I've had. Not something I'd drink a lot of, but would be wonderful to enjoy after a good meal. A real treat to come across and I look forward to the chance to have one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very enjoyable beer w/ a nice flavor profile and big hop character. Really an excellent RIS, but im still left wanting something more. Having said that it will still be in my fridge during stout season. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this beer is a treat. Great dessert beer, great special occasion beer. It is to be sipped and enjoyed. I look forward to trying some of the other Great Divide Yeti concoctions."
""
"O: I admit, I'm biased toward big-ass RIS beers, but holy bajeezus. Worst I can say is that it's not particularly easy to digest its qualities (as it should be) and that the smell isn't amazing. Otherwise, this is a devastating combination of boldness and refinement that puts it high on the list of my favorite beers ever. Would I have it often? No, I'd have to be in the right mood to enjoy this. But those 3 or 4 times a year where I am in said mood? I'll be all over this like a fat kid on a Hershey bar."

"For readers of my reviews, you know that I am working my way through porters and stouts. Â At first, these dark and heavy beers were a bit much, Â but they have grown on me. Â My journey through the dark underworld of beer has lead me to the Yeti Imperial Stout. Â With some trepidation I poured this dark elixir into a shaker glass. Â Black as night, head like espresso, my hand shook as I lifted the glass to my lips. Â A huge aroma came to greet me, and not just roasted malt, but flowery hops and spice, very inviting. The favor is big, but smooth and complex: toffee, vanilla and lots of fruity hops. Â I have found other stouts abrasive, but not here. Â The Yeti Imperial Stout is a milestone achievement in brewing. Â Not for the faint of heart, but if you have some experience with stouts, this the Yeti is at the next level."
""
""
"Overall - This is a fantastic beer. I was not much on imperial stouts at all. I often steered clear of them then somethin told me to try this one and now I am a closet stout lover and can not get enough of them."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit astringent and not as smooth as I'd hoped for. The malts get overpowered by the intensity of the roast and excessive hop bitterness. Overall not a bad RIS, but I've certainly had others that were more enjoyable."
""
""
"O-good easy to get ahold of (I assume based on the number of reviews although it isn't available here in Iowa) imperial stout"
""
"O-As a Wisconsinite i don't get Yeti often. I've had all the variations so it's about time i review the original. This is an everyday imperial stout for the stout lover. Not over the top in flavor, but somewhat approachable for an imperial stout, if that makes sense. Iconically american with big hops and mild chocolate notes. Yum."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Highly recommended!"

"Overall a stout to try. I hope to add the belgian style soon (maybe tonight :D)."
""
""
"O- This is my first time having the original Yeti and it certainly lives up to the legend."
""
""
"Overall: A very good RIS. Not the most complex or brawny, but damn good, and I like the 12 oz bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I will be looking for more brews from Great Divide"
"Not as refined as Old Rasputin but it also seems a bit larger as well."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"A nice offering from GDBC. For my money, Old Rasputin from North Coast still rules."
"O: a great imp stout, so glad I finally got my hands on a bottle of this. Its quite the beer and I won't be passing it up again."
"Overall this is a really great regular year-round imperial stout, one that I'll start stocking regularly in 12oz bottles."
"Great Divide makes some damn fine beers in my opinion, this one being up there as one of their best."
""
""
""
""
""

"One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts out there, and a fantastic brew by Great Divide. I would certainly advise aging this stout. Very highly recommended and a must try for all RIS lovers. Cheers!!!"

"Completely black in color. Poured with a brief caramel brown foam that dissiaptated quickly leaving behind a light wisps of foam. Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee with hints dark fruits and vanilla. Thick, viscous, incredibly smooth, almost chewable feel. Deep roasted malt, dark coffee and dark chocolate flavors up front transitioning to a steadily intensifying hop bitterness through the finish. Finishes with a boozy, pine hop bitterness that lingers for quite some time."
""
""
"o - overall...i believe."

"I also picked up the Oak Aged Yeti, but I can only deal with 1 beast per night. I must rest up before I take on the next one."

"thanks once again go out to beerhan! 12oz. bottled on march 11 2011. there is no way one could improve the appearance of this beer. a thick black body that sounds like used motor oil slapping into the tulip. a huge georgeous three finger mocha colored head that leaves tons of thick sticky lacing as it settles to a thin cap. smell is unique and interesting. coffee, chocolate, citrus hps and wood. taste is roasty malts, chocolate, caramel, hops and toffee, there is also a finishing touch i'm not fond of and can't quite place it. mouthfeel is excellent with a full body, great carbonation and an overall sticky feel. this is an interesting stout to say the least. i don't think i've had one with such a hop profile before, definatly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Oh my, this one is very tasty. Way too drinkable at 9.5%. Wish I could get this in Iowa, but Nebraska's not that far away. Will be bringing back more the next time I make a beer run to the West. Delicious."
"O: A very drinkable stout with good flavor. This is one of my go-to stouts for a reason."
"Overall: Wow. I accidentally bought an older bottle. I haven't had the chance to play much with aging beers, but I will now. I'll have to pick up a fresh bottle and compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavors are abundant and complex and leave you craving another sip each time you drink to find more hidden beauty within the beer."
""
""
"O: A really well done RIS, not my favorite, but considering its availability very nice. With the last little bit, I put in a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and that was fantastic."
""
"Overall: This beer is excellent, right up there with a Stone IRS and Old Rasputin! The best part is that is available in four packs. This would be great to have around for when you want to have a good Imperial Stout beer but do not want to break out a vintage or a whale of a beer."
""
"This is a really good RIS. A pity that Great Divide will no longer distribute in Tidewater VA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer. As it warms, more varied flavors are starting to come through, as is the alcohol. This is definitely something i'd get again if i see it locally."
""
"D-O- Perhaps the best widely-available imperial stout, at least around these parts. Has everything you'd look for...chocolate, coffee, roastiness. Thanks coylefoto."
""
""
""
""
"O: Yeti is a really well made beer that pleases all senses. It's well balanced with no flavor dominating another and again, no alcohol presence. Wonderfully drinkable."
""

"Serving type: bottle"

"Final Thoughts: Pretty nice. This ones a slow sipper."
""
""

"Wow, this will definitely become one of my go-to beers in the future, itâ€™s easy to find and nicely priced. Canâ€™t wait to try all the Yeti variations now!"
""
""
"ABV is high to be sessionable. But tasty."
""
"O: Excellent R.I.S., I think this beats out Storm King as my new favorite. And I like seeing that Great Divide makes multiple small batch versions of this beer as well!"
"I have had a few of the variants of this beer and enjoyed them but I assume they had some age. I can see this beer aging very well but I wouldn't drink such a fresh bottle again."

"A very well-wrought RIS - big all around, and solid in all respects - the hops overdose a somewhat unexpected, but still enjoyable foil to the base nature of this particular beast."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - nice find in South Chicago! someone had some idea about something good!! Age has done wonders for this RIS! I have 3 more I found and cannot wait to find any reason to pop one open"

"O: Impressive; an imperial stout with a complex bitter body that proves undeniably drinkable. Iâ€™ve had beers of this style that were more to my liking, but this was a very nice representation of RIS flavor. A barrel would do this a world of good to this beer â€“ Oak-Aged Yeti, here I come."

"D - sure to satisfy fans of GD and imperial stouts alike. Not the best out there but very good. I'm excited to try the aged version."
"I like the aggressiveness of this beer. Very bold and imposing (as it says on the bottle). Like the complementing hops. A little too dry and bitter for a stout I think, but an otherwise delicious beer."
"O - An excellent RIS, worth trying."
"Overall: For a year-round beer, this is a beast and one worthy of it's big accolades. Seek out the Yeti and you shall be rewarded."
"O - I've loved this beer since the first time I had it. This was the first tap experience with it and I still love it as mucbh as ever."
"O - Extremely drinkable offering up some bold flavours. A well formulated Imperial Stout that will please your palette."
"Overall this exceeds the reputation. Balance, complexity and a wonderful interaction of all the flavours makes this a really top beer. I believe!"
"One of the best Imperial Stouts I've had to date. Simply wonderful!"
"O- Good imperial stout, but bitter coffee is a bit much! Will enjoy more though."
"O: Very good. I actually prefer just this, Yeti, to all the variants. Good stuff."
"This is a real quality imperial stout. Not full bodied, but really smooth, rich and balanced"
"All around probably the best every day available stout. I pass this beer all the time but always enjoy it. Viscous, great taste, great aroma... All around solid beer."
"O: My first beer from Great Divide, and I was not disappointed. Yum!"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It is a reasonable example of the class while adding that interesting punch courtesy of the hops. Tastey and easy to drink, with a reasonably covered ABV."
"O- solid Imperial Stout, but is VERY overpriced. At this price I would be expecting one of the top Imperial Stouts and it's only above average, but not amazing. I'd look elsewhere for a top notch Imperial Stout. Was a good beer, but disappointed me after reading rave reviews."
"I'm suffering from a pretty good cold right now, so I know my sense of smell and taste is affected. Even with that being said, this is an awesome beer. I'll be adding it into my normal rotation at home and I can't wait to taste it once this cold is gone."
"Creamy smooth chocolate hits hard first, followed by a big note of coffee, definitely mocha-like. Coffee or hop bitterness balances it all out with ease, making sure that the chocolate doesn't ever become cloying. A taste of vanilla sneaks in to help with the process of keeping a seriously smooth beer. Where's that 9.5% alcohol? Hidden almost completely behind that same balancing bitterness perfectly. There is a breath of alcohol in the very end, but nothing that ever becomes distracting. The texture is creamy as well, creating a very smooth mouthfeel and setting the tone for the whole bottle. And the whole bottle is delicious through and through. Some how every sip seems to be just as good, if not better than the last one. One of the best RIS's I've had and I will definitely buy more, as well as all the other cool variations. Great beer."
"This is an amazing beer. The flavors are intense and well balanced, the alcohol is noticeable but doesn't overpower and is actually welcomed when it shows up, and the mouthfeel is so rich, smooth and pleasing. This is definitely one of the better stouts on the market. I love it! I'll be back for more, and I'll even check out the other varieties of Yeti now."
"(330 ml bottle, BB date reads 09-01-2011, consumed 08-12-2011. )"
"O: an overall good stout, I was expecting this to be a bit more sweet but nevertheless is a good option in its style."
"4.0's all the way across. I'll grab a few more of these next time I head south. I also need to get ahold of some of the variations."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The only thing keeping this baby from being a ""5" in the taste category is the bitterness. I'd love to age one of these for a couple of years to see if it would mellow a bit. But this is an elite Stout in my eyes. If you've been hesitating to try this,...it's time to right the ship!"
"This pours a pitch black, motor oil consistency with a nice mocha head which leaves a lacing, absolutely no light gets through the black color. The smells are of dark chocolate, roasted malts, a little of hops. The feel is very thick completely coats the mouth, among the best I've had. The taste is beautiful, dark chocolate, bitter malts and bitter hops. A wonderful IRS."
"Liked this beer a lot. I tried it on a recommendation of a server and it didnâ€™t disappoint. Lots of good flavors that work well together. It would be hard to stick to this the whole night, but definitely give it a try."
"Overall - A solid, but not outstanding imperial stout. I thought it brought some nice complexities, but they could be somewhat muddled. I'm not sure what was with the iron taste on the finish, but it sort of took away from the overall taste."
"Overall, amazing imperial stout, world class brew in my humble opinion. This will be my go to imp stout!"
"O- Very nice, complex, big stout. Lots of sweet malts, but a nice hop presence and bitterness. Very, very drinkable for 9.5%."
"O - This was a big hit with others at the tasting at which my notes for this review were taken. Just too much coffee for me."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer. The hoppiness is distinct and welcomed. I will be drinking all winter."
"This is a great beer and perfect for the first day of sub-50 degree weather here. It makes me want to get the fireplace going and have a cigar. A must-try for anyone who likes big stouts."
"Overall: incredibly drinkable for an imperial stout. Very good beer with excellent transition between flavors."
"Appearance is dark black with a tan head, looks nice. The nose on Yeti has chocolate, espresso, roasted malts and toffee. Upon sipping this beauty, I taste coffee, oak, chocolate, hops and more of those malts. Mouthfeel is full bodied, a rich texture to this ris. All in all, this is a very good beer; a fantastic beer to pair with a dessert."
"Taste is chocolate, caramel, coffee, pine the flavors dance. It has a smooth subtle kick that none-the-less hits home finishing dry with the bitterness of an ipa."
"Many other stouts I would reach for before this one. However, I do plan on trying the rest of their Yeti line up, hoping for the best."
"I've been drinking Yeti for a while now...for my money and availability, it's hard to beat."
"Pours a pitch black oily body with a big lasting creamy chocolate head. Aroma is sweet and light roasted with some dark fruits, coffee, mocha and hints of burned toast. Really nice aroma! Really full-bodied, softly carbonated and has a fantastic creamy and oily mouthfeeling. Sweet but still quite bitter on the flavors. Oaky and there is much stronger roasted flavors then the aroma would suggest. Burned toast and some nice sweet alcohol thatâ€™s leaving a lava-like warming sensation."
"O: Overall, a very good RIS. I think it could really be fantastic if it was allowed to cellar for awhile to let some of the hop bitterness subdue. I will say that this, it is much better than the Oak Aged Yeti that I tried a couple months ago, which was just completely dominated by an alcohol presence that masked all the other flavors (although now I'm thinking I may have just got a bad batch). Because of that I have been shying away from trying the regular Yeti, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise and a damn good RIS."
"O: As a reviewer, it's my nature to try and find the thing or things that I don't like about a beer so as not to appear like a fanboy. Trouble is, I can't find anything I don't like about this beer. It's damn tasty, and quite powerful. Great with red meat, which I prefer medium rare. Cheers."
"Though the beer initially seemed to strong, I got more used to it with every sip. By the last sip, I really enjoyed it. And, at 10% ABV, this beer is not for the lightweights. In all, I will try this style and this beer again. For a first time drinker of this style, just give it a chance to get used to it."
"Overall - Excellent stout - rich and complex. Bitter hop aftertaste that hung around is the only aspect I wasn't too fond of, but that is a characteristic that some enjoy."
"I'd give it to somebody on a cold CO night, whether for camping, cabins or breaking in the living room, quite a positive drink for a mature tongue"
"O: Classic RIS. Worth multiple purchases."
"Overall, this beer is pretty on point. Thick, rich, complex, very good array of flavors. I still prefer the Oak out of this series."
"Dark but not sweet, and, man, there's some bitterness. This needs some time. There's clearly an epic beer in here, but it's too hot and edgy when it's new. Still, a chewy, dark, hoppy monster."
"Wonderful stuff. Boozy, but what is present really works in this one. Lots of flavor. I will have this again."
"The aftertaste was something of a combination of roasty malts a hop bitterness that reminds me the hop bill from Two-Hearted."
"O: Finish is a bit awkward, but Ill take that over the normally hoppy finish. I would guess that although Yeti has held up decently for 21 months, I don't see it improving all that much in the long run."
"Pours a dark thick black appearance with a two finger dark brown head. Aroma of smokey roasted malts, hops and chocolate. Taste follows the nose. Wow is this hoppy, a little two hoppy for a stout in my opinion. Bitter with an aftertaste that hangs around. Pretty good but not in my top five impy stouts"
"THis is a fine example of an imperial stout.I may not be an expert but this is a full bodied and aromatic imperial stout. Appearance is very undoubtley black with dark tan head.Smell has fine dark sugary esspresso smoky mocha aroma. Taste has a sweetly bitter smoked feel with strong taste and bold imperial alcohol content to give you that warm feeling about half way through a pint. Overall I could be gratefuly yeti to enjoy another one."
"Poured 22 oz bottle into my 16 oz snifter, bottle 5/12/11. Pours just amazing. Black as black, with a wonderful looking mocha creamy head. A inch worth, with plenty of lacing. Smell is huge chocolate, coffee, with some tobacco & smoke. A little booze. Taste all those, with a nice herbal hops finish. Mouthfeel is great, big.but approachable. Lots of life. This is my favorite non oaked or barrel aged stout. Great Divide makes some of the best stouts on planet earth, thanks."
"O- One of my new favorites for the style. I really enjoyed how they let the big flavors of roasted malt and hops play off each other. Really really spot on."
"O- I like it. Not something to drink too much of at 9.5 % plus the ""liquid bread"" effect with the stout style."
"Delicious."
"Overall - Yeti is a perfect name for this one. This guy is really the Sasquatch of beers! 22oz is just right and leaves me satisfied enough that I won't need another beer for at least six hours. To fully enjoy this mammoth, be sure to eat bland tasting food leading up to it and come on a light stomach. It'll kick you in the balls. High marks!"
"D - This is a big, big beer. Worth trying. Up there with the best imperials I've tried, though it does not necessarily stick out between any of them. Nevertheless, this is a great, great beer, worth all the praise it gets, and I'd encourage everyone to try it. It's actually a great starter beer for beer drinkers new to imperial stouts. If that's you, check it out!"
"O: in a store 15$ for a 4pk. Not worth the money considering beers that i compare it to, like plead the 5th are only 13$. Not worth the money but definately a well made imperial centering around coffee worth trying. I cant wait to try and review the 22 of the expresso version but wont be buying another half case."
"O- This is just a quality stout, very easy drinkability, perfect to drink on a cold winter day."
"O - Excellent. 8 dollars well spent."
"Right on the edge of totally repulsive and totally loveable, this is a damn fine brew."
"The thickness almost gave it a syrup type texture at times, but the feeling it left behind was sweet and delicious. Rich."
"Well worth the try, and again, just be careful, Yeti sightings are always easier to prove when one doesnâ€™t wake up with a pounding head ache the next day."
"O - Overall, this is a great dessert beer or nightcap. Now that I've finally introduced myself to the Yeti series, I'll have to try the other ones out."
"M - Big, thick and heavy. A really good imperial stout. Not the kind of beer to have a number of, but it would definitely be nice by a fire in the winter. And at 9.5%, you might not need much more."
"Overall, I am very impressed with this beer.A wonderfully crafted imperial stout. I would have to say it is my favorite so far. Very good drinkability despite its daunting smell and look. Everyone should go out and try this one."
"Overall this is a solid imperial stout worth seeking out and drinking"
"This is truly a beverage to be dealt with, in other words, and not only because of the 9.5% ABV. I have no doubt that many will find Yeti overpowering and unapproachable because of its sheer audacity, much like the bespectacled and braces-ridden high school chess-club champion who wants to ask the head cheerleader to the prom. As for me, I've just placed this beer in my top ten. Let the pom-pom swaying begin."
"D - Quite rich and delicious."
"D - Overall a decent beer. Not the best, not the worst. Probably a good beer to judge other in the style against."
"D: definitely not a let-down stout. deliciously flavorful and a great way to wind down. wish i had one every night."
"Creamy mouthfeel, slightly burnt taste, nice hoppiness that compliments the burnt aroma, maybe too much, if this were my homebrew, I would probably drop the roastiness and see what happened. Very pleasant, a nice strong-tasting, thick stout to write this research journal article over. I like this...but I think Old Rasputin is better, more widely available, and cheaper."
"O - The superb integration of all elements is a key to my appreciation here; this is a great beer. Overall, this is one of the better aged stouts I've had. Time serves this one very very well. It is also worth noting that this brew is immensely superior to the 3 year-old Expedition Stout I had quite recently."
"Nose mature large. No oxidation. Mocha, chocolate and pure arabica coffee black nose. Drink very smooth and heavy body. In the mouth, a mixture of pure chocolate Black invade the palace comes to bitterness and to the saturation of the cacao beans on the tongue. The power is amazing and there are many flavors in the drink. In addition, it offers a balance between simply amazing sweet creamy bitterness and roasting. A beer that wears its name perfectly."
"Final thought - Upwards of 9% abv and only $4 a bottle, why not try this stout? You should!"
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I liked the extra hop kick, and how it didn't over power the rich malty profile. An almost balanced beer I'd say. I think the price is too high but it is a really delicious brew. Definitely give this beer a try, if your into RIS, it's got me wanting to try the Espresso aged one and the Chocolate aged one! Cheers!"
"o: There's nothing subtle here, just a big in-your face RIS packed with over-the-top amounts of hops and malts that destroy your pallete and numb the senses."
" Big beer with dark roasted malt toffee/coffee flavor balanced with good hops. Would definitely buy again and try to keep on hand."
"Overall it's a very drinkable and enjoyable RIS, highly recommended."
"Overall: This is a very good imperial stout, and its availability should make it a regular in my cellar."
"5/4/2011"
"I'm surprised it took me so long to try this beer, although I did have to cross state lines to obtain it. I look forward to trying the other variations now that I've enjoyed the original."
"cheers!"
"O-An above average imperial stout for sure. I wish I had regular access to this, as it distinguishes itself from the average RIS."
"Decadent sipper."
"Thick but smooth mouthfeel that makes for easy drinking. High abv, but very little notice of the alcohol in this bottle. I've already had the Chocolate and Oak Aged versions so was glad to compare. This one is superb, and much better to me than the chocolate version with the pepper, but only slightly less than the oak-aged version. Highly recommended."
"All I can say is WOW! A wonderfully balanced and drinkable RIS. Probably my favourite that I've tried to date. I have always been partial to balanced and highly drinkable beers rather than big smashmouth tastes. The alcohol does become a little heavy handed, but that's a minor point compared to the body of work. A must buy if you have an opportunity!"
"The best thing about this beer is the mouth feel. It's sticky and coats the entire mouth. It also has the ability to make your mouth tingle. Its a weird sensation but interesting. Not sure what that is from. The hops? The bitterness from the roasted grains? Or the espresso? Whatever the culprit, its wonderful."
"Overall. Awesome imperial stout. I have a few other variations of this which I'm really excited to try after this one."
"O - At 9.5% this imperial stout has aged nicely, slight warmth and a full body and mouth of flavor. All youd want from this style of beer. A great stout."
"O: This stout is a heavy hitter stout, it's extremely dark with tons of different flavor but balanced well. High ABV content but you cannot taste it really. I would pick this up again if I saw it and was in the mood for an imperial stout."
"Super frothy brew with a head that is long lasting and thick. Super dark fluid and rich brown head. Sweet burnt molasses smell with big coffee and charcoal notes. Taste is the same with the most charcoal you can enjoy. Rich strong coffee and burnt molasses body with firm bitter finish. Feel is thick and rich with a touch of creaminess, A big sticky strong beer that has no trace of abv on the mouth. lots of refreshing bitterness."
"o-great stout from a great brewery. This beer has a lot of flavors going on in it. I think they have a hell of a platform for all of their Yeti tweeking that they do. Great to have this beer out year round."
"D - great choice for an after dinner Friday night beer. skip dessert and just drink this instead."
"Overall a nice imperial stout, though it is a bit hoppier than I'd expect and I'd like to see the mouthfeel a bit creamier."
"Overall â€“ This is one of the best RIS's I've had to date. The chocolate taste is fantastic and the mouthfeel is near perfect. I'll be sure to have a few of these on hand for after dinner drinks with friends."
"this beer pours pitch black with a two finger mocha colored head that lingers. the smell is roasty bitter chocolate with some coffee notes and a hint of booze. the taste follows suit with the dark chocolate flavors coming up front followed by the hint of coffee and a warm slighlty alcohol finish. the mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbed. a very good example of the style"
"O: My favorite available RIS. Love the roastiness and dark chocolate."
"dark bitter chocolate, dark roast coffee grinds with espresso finish. It has a little alcohol taste at the end, I think if I taste it again I will age it for a year or two. I actually buzzed a bit after drinking this beer. Price wise I don't think it's as good as a Old stock ale by north coast brewery or Rasputin for that matter as some other reviewers mentioned."
"O: I definitely liked this better than Old Rasputin. This was what I envisioned an Imperial Stout should taste like. A nice balance, not so bitter and hoppy. Leaves a warm tingly feeling in the stomach."
"Not all imperial stouts have the courage to go beyond black. This one does. And excels at it. If the brewery could only save the flavoring hops for their IPA..."
"The ladu ordered a whole case of these and in Holland these might not sell too fast. I so hope that other people will try this and love it as well. This is a beer that very stout lover needs to try because it's just damn good."
"O - I really like the balance in this beer. The Vanilla is a nice touch that is complimented by an array of other flavours."
"The mouthful is full and rich, but the roast takes it back a step. Overall, it's a good beer, bit I've definitely had more satisfying."
"I had a 2011 bottle of this and it pours a very dark black with a dark brown finger's worth of foam into a tulip glass. The smell is of chocolate and coffee, but leans more towards the chocolate side with little to no hop presence notable. Alcohol is well hidden, and the taste is thick, and has more of a bitter/roasted malt taste than the chocolate aroma would make you expect. Overall I liked this, but prefer Founders Imperial for a 'regular' RIS."
"O- Unlike a lot of Russian Imp Stouts. This has high drinkability. Due to the perfect amount of hop bite, it has a nice clean finish for this style. No real lingering residue left on the tongue. Although still a sipper, the bomber didn't last long. If it wasnt for that pesky rule againstbeginning at work, I could drink this instead of my morning coffee."
"Had this one a while ago, it poured out very thick black with a dark brown head. The lacing was good here. The smell is a deep roasted chocolate malts with a rich nose of toast and coffee. The taste is rather complex going some a semi sweet to a dry burnt bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick making this one a sipper. I'd like to re-visit this one again one day. I feel it's worthy."
"This beer pours very black, glugs from the bottle like motor oil. The head on this beer is an incredible dark espresso color. This beer just looks awesome. The smell is very much like a dessert. German chocolate cake comes to mind, truffles, creme brulee, roasted nuts, and a nice rich espresso note. The aroma is world class. The taste does not fall short. Big rich creamy chocolate notes up front, cake like flavors, I also get a creamy like flavor that does remind me of creme brulee. This beer is just great, one of my favorite stouts, seriously good stuff."
"O: This beer is outstanding. I don't believe the adjusted variations I've had so far are as good as the original."
"O- It's good. I will say that. But there are alot of other Impy's to try and I am not going to pay 4.50 for a bottle of this. Sorry"
"This brew pours a nice dark as cola hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a half finger head and little lacing,the smell upfront is all about roasty,roasty malts and piney hops,it has a medium bodied averagely carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of caramel,dark roasted coffee,dark begian chocolate and is finished with a piney hop bitterness that really reminds you that this is not a desert brew but indeed a very nice nightcap and overall a very nice drop but have had better RIS's cheers."
"Pours black with a huge dark brown head. Good retention and leaves decent lace. Nose is full of bitter chocolate, burnt sugar, caramel, roasted malt, toffee. Taste follows. Full body with low/medium carbonation. Lightly dry mouthfeel. Great impy and one of my favorites... Great Divide please don't leave Michigan!"
"Overall I really like this beer. There is an excellent balance of flavor and it has great body, and did I mention the head retention!? We got a pitcher on tap at Great Divide, and I had to step out for a work phone call, and when I came back 20 minutes later, there was still 2 fingers of dark, creamy head. Amazing!!"
"Easily one of the best beer drinking experiences you can have."
"O: Wow. I have had this a few times but I forgot how good it is. Dark, creamy, burnt sweetness, bitter. I drank the entire bomber no issue. Gonna find more and cellar it. My description sounds like it could be a milk stout but its not. Get this beer and drink it."
"Pours black, reasonably thick, with a small dissipating head which recedes to leave just a ring around the glass. Nose is full of dark fruit and roasted malts, nice. Taste is complex... this has aged nicely. Well integrated roast, chocolate, raisin. Not overly sweet, a decent bitterness... pretty well balanced for a big stout. Mouthfeel is thick with moderate carbonation, almost spot on. Overall, I've had this beer a number of times from fresh to this 2 year old version. Both are good, but I think a year to two years in the cellar turns this beer from good to great. Not quite as good as its Oak'd brethren, but still very nice."
"O: There may be a lot of hard to get, seasonal stouts out there that get rave reviews. But I would shed far more tears if beers like Yeti and Old Rasputin were expensive and hard to find. Thankfully, they are not. This is a first rate Imperial Stout and I love the price."
"Overall: Yeti is such a solid Imperial stout without anytime spent in a barrel! Just a well made beer with a great mouthfeel and great example of the style. Man this is a treat, but if you really want to spoil yourself go for the Oak aged, chocolate oak aged or Expresso Oak aged yeti; can't go wrong with any of these beers!"
"O/D - There's a reason this beer is known as one of the more famous examples in the U.S. It's a really solid Impy stout with nothing to really complain about. Well done."
"O-I was always turned off by the $14 price tag. Glad I finally made the purchase. Will be buying more in the future."
"O: This is a great stout with many flavors that I will be more than happy to try again, hopefully soon."
"all around a very enjoyable beer."
"All in all a great beer with a lot to offer."
"O- Really glad I picked this up. I've had the oak and espresso versions of this stout and the base beer did not disappoint."
"Overall- A great imperial stout. Definitely one worth buying again."
"D - Very drinkable. Amazing that the 9.5% abv stays as well hidden as it does. The flavors are really fairly potent and very well balanced. The hop addition is quite nice here."
"Black as the abyss with a dark sticky head. The smell is roasty and a lot hoppier than I had anticipated. The taste is huge and complex like an Imperial Stout should be! Bittersweet chocolate, caramel and toffee, then finally a big, musty, dry, woody finish. It doesn't have that currant flavor that a lot of RISs do. Velvety texture and so drinkable you need to be careful that the Yeti's 9.5% ABV doesn't unleash your untamed side. Superior lacing, as well. Every sip is a little different. The hops are more noticeable as it warms."
"It's a great drinking beer and I'm glad this is available for most of th year. Definitely worth picking up"
"Pours a midnight black with an immense 4 inch tan head. The head forms towards the middle of the glass and bubbles rush towards the surface. Nice thick globs and rings on lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, subdued coffee, and citrus zest. Slight alcohol notes as the beer warms. Taste is of dark malts, roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, and slight soy sauce. There is a mild hop/coffee/chocolate bitterness on the palate after each sip. Low carbonation with a very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer. It's nice to try the base for all the other Yeti beers in it's original form. I am glad this is available year-round where I live."
"O: Liked it. It's a good RIS that doesn't try to do too much. I liked the hop presence but I can see how it turns some people off."
"O: A fantastic stout. This one is a bit smokier than most stouts are, despite it not being oak aged or espresso oak aged, but I still really like Great Divide's stouts. It's bold, complex, and truly an enjoyable brew."
"O: Wonderful stuff. I've enjoyed most of the various incarnations of this one, and it was totally nice to taste the base beer once again."
"O- A good RIS overall. Nothing really stands out other then the intense bittersweet choc qualities. Solid, but many others have it beat. Maybe some age would help to intensify the subdued choc notes past the bittersweet domination. Quite easy to drink quickly considering the semi-rough bitterness."
"O: I really like this one. Very much similar to Old Raspy. I'll be having this regularly."
"Overall: an excellent imperial stout. I definitely want to buy some more of this stuff."
"This is one great representation of the style. To be enjoyed over and over just like the tale of the Yeti."
"Pours a very dark brown black color with no head and no lacing persent. The aroma is big and full a nice big milk chocolate presnece alobg with some dark fruits. The taste has a chocolate and molasses backbone. In the middle is a big bitter hop nite presence. The hops are earthy. The malts don't completely balance out the bitterness. On the back end the is a coffee and dark fruit taste. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a slight alcohol burn. Overall it was an okay beer the hop bite isn't as balanced as I thought it would be and ditracts from the malts."
"Overall: I can only chalk me liking this beer up to it having a year on it. Any of these that I have had from under a year old I simply do not like and my rating would likely fall in the B- range. However, this beer really surprised me today and it is a lot better than I remember. No fusel alcohol flavors. Honestly, get this beer and toss it away for a year if you want to spend the $14 a four pack."
"A really big, delicious, and interesting stout from Great Divide. It does some things exceptionally well. The aroma is particularly special and picking out individual flavors is a fun exercise, as there's tons to find! But for some reason, it just doesn't seem quite to blend into the world-class beer it seems like it should be. That being said, I'm certainly a fan."
"O: A well done Imperial Stout in my books that strikes a great balance between big flavors and ease of drinking. It does not stress the palate like some other bold Imperial Stouts tend to do but it really makes its statement known that this isn't a beer lacking in malty, roasty character."
"The beer pours like oil, it's black with a thick frothy brown head that hugged the glass. I smell aromas of roasted chocolate and toffee with some dark fruit. The taste is bitter with dark chocolate, molasses, maybe a hint of bourbon and a bitter black coffee flavor, the aftertaste is of piney hops. The beer is heavy with perfect carbontaion and a long, dry and bitter finish. This is an excellent imperial stout, it is an explosion of flavor."
"Overall: An excellent RIS that is well worth picking up and trying. I can't wait for the next 12 months to roll by to see how it continues to develop -- I feel there is still a lot of potential in this one. The weight and ABV of the style in general prevents one from considering drinking too much of it, so one is plenty."
"A very solid, powerfully roasty beer. would sip on this just about any night of the week. looking forward to cellaring a few and revisiting in a year or so."
"A good priced, well made beer. Great beer! Get it now."
"Overall yeah man it's another yeti winner this flagship and it's variations just can't seem to do wrong."
"Wonderful smokey flavorings and hop aroma, not boozy at all, perfect balance between malts, chocolates and hop bite at the end but perfect in every way."
"OVERALL: A/A+"
"o - yeah ill buy it again. id much rather go with the oak aged or espresso oak aged but what are you gonna do when you dont have those extra couple of bucks to your name? nice one."
"O: Very good. Very rich. It's a sipper."
"Overall - Decent beer. I've had some better Imperial Stouts, but it brings another dimension that I really like. If you hadn't had it yet, I suggest you get it and experience it for yourself."
"A great Imperial Stout a a fair price. Great Divide once again proves itself to be a superb brewery with this tasty beer."
"The mouthfeel is full and viscous, and the drinkability is quite good for the mouthfeel. This is a well-done RIS that's inexpensive (this bottle was 3.50) and a joy to drink, but doesn't do too much to stand out from it's peers. Nevertheless, recommended."
"Poured this pitch black Imperial Stout a little on the agressive side finding little to no head, but left subtle brown sticky lacing, go figure, maybe the temp wasn't just right. Aromas of expresso, carmel with a touch of pine. This heavy bodied brew coats the tongue with a carpet bomb of flavors ranging from burnt carmel coffee,semi sweet chocolate, raw almonds. and tart black cherries which hide the alcohol. Quite the stay at home stout. Cheers!"
"A pretty decent stout here... I liked the Oak Aged version better but this is still pretty good"
"I just wish I had some smoked cheese to enjoy with this one. A real rich, enjoyable and yet drinkable Russian imperial."
"Beautiful. Thick. Delicious. Boozy. A great beer!"
"12oz bottle. Bottled on Date of March 25 2010, so just about a year old. Pours a brackish dark brown with very little head. Aromas of dark bittersweet chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Flavor is sweeter than it smelled. Coffee and dark chocolate taste. Chocolate malty aftertaste. Not very boozey tasting for being almost 10%. Heavy but really easy to drink. One of the better Russian imperial stouts around. Im going to miss this beer."
"overall- very drinkable full bodied w/o being overbearing , alcohol is hidden nicely"
"Overall, this beer is like melted chocolate bars with a kick ass twist. I am in love and cant wait to taste the barrel aged chocolate version. With all the dessert characteristics in this basic Yeti, the chocolate must be very intense in it's older cousin. BOOM"
"This is a rock solid example of an Imperial Stout. Nose includes chocolate, coffee and burnt malt. Chocolate, coffee, smoky malts, mild hops and a lot of alcohol dominate the taste. It is smooth, with a nice thick mouth feel. rock solid. Highly recommend for fans of this genre."
"D-Nicely balanced super drinkable RIS for the hophead in all of us. I hear there is a barrel aged version. Bring it on."
" Overall, this is a brew that I will reccomend highly to my fellow enlightened beer drinkers. I think I need to stop by the distributor I went to and releive him of the rest of his stock. I'll race ya!!!!"
"I get the hype but this stout seems to be more about being bold then balance. Benchmark imperial stout, rather affordable and readily available."
"Going to keep my review numbers as the fresh Yeti, as that's how Great Divide intended it. I'd be interested to see other people's inputs on the sweet spot for this one!"
"D: Amazing drinkability for an RIS, complex and invigorating while being balanced and layered in flavor. Recommended-"
"great beer, can't wait to try the oak-aged yeti."
"Overall this is fantastic and world class Imperial Stout. A must for your pallet!! Buy it if you get the chance!!"
"D: Considering its strength, the beer is quite drinkable for the style."
"Pours a really deep mahogany brown. Huge brown head with a reddish hue to it. Nice lacing and retention for the style. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate, dark fruits and a bit of hops. Awesome chocolate notes to start, really good creamy sweetness. Roasted coffee beans follow. Big dark fruit and really crisp hop bitterness round out the beer. Really nice big, but well-balanced flavor profile. Wickedly creamy mouthfeel and awesome drinkability for a RIS."
"D: drank mine & my friends bottle when he said that he didn't want to finish it & I wanted more. I definitely, absolutely loved this one."
"D: Drink it slow for all the bitterness. Drink it fast to get drunk! What are you waiting for drink up!"
"This is a great beer to drink with something, I had chili, as the dry taste is a little off. i could see how aging would improve this beer. Last note is that this beer is all over the place I appreciate where this beer goes but i don't think i will follow"
"D: It is a little rougher around the edges than its oak-aged sibling but this is still a great stout."
"If my original review was lost, I am happy. It caused me to pause and ponder this wonderful beer again. Cheers to the Yeti!!"
"Scores: 5, 4, 4, 4.5, 4.5"
"This bomber should do me!!! Good stuff here."
"D- This is a very nice RIS, I can see why it's the base beer for so many other variations, it seems like it's flavor profile would hold up well under many circumstances. This could become one of my favorite stouts, everything came together very nicely for a pleasurable experience."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit chewy with a smooth slightly dry feel. Overall, I'm really enjoying thous stout right now. Nothing mind blowing here but nothing to complain about either."
"Had this when GD first came to SoCal in late Summer '10, and got some to age. So glad I did, and can't wait to keep trying it at different stages. For the price of this beer locally, it's an insane bargain!!!"
"O - Man, I really dig this beer. I really enjoy a smokey flavor in stouts and porters. THis one was right up my alley."
"M/D) Full, thick mouthfeel. Smooth, creamy beer with some slight carbonation. Easy to drink, but not really sessionable. More of a one-and-done dessert beer."
"D-Overall this is a good beer. But at times i felt like i was drinking a stout beer while i was smoking a cigarette. The tabacco flavor came through too much sometimes but still a good beer!"
"Jet black with no visible light passing through when back lit. Beautify tan head with plenty of staying power and lots of lace. Earthy, vanilla ice cream aroma. A bit of a bite up front. Some of the alcohol appears in the middle, but is well hidden. Subtle earthy flavor middle to end, almost peppery. Bittersweet back end, dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Rich body."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours jet black with a 2 finger, creamy, mocha head that has excellent retention. Aroma is roast, dark caramel, milk chocolate, smoke, mild coffee, nutty toffee, light pine and surprising floral hops. Flavor is roast, sweet chocolate, sweet toffee, toasted pine nuts, dark caramel, earth, leather, espresso and a nice array of pine, citrus and floral hops to the finish. Odd lingering aftertaste of smoked meat, char and licorice, not bad, but seems to last forever. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, creamy on entry and a little oily, but with an extremely sharp, but light carbonation throughout."
"Pours black and syrupy, with a one-finger coffee-colored head (one of the darkest I've seen) that slowly relaxes to a film. Smell is all roasted malts, chocolate and coffee with some sweetness. Taste starts out very malty, but rolls into a strong hop-bitter finish. Much hoppier than most stouts, which adds complexity to the beer, but isn't my favorite. Mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and heavy, as expected. Good beer, just a little more bitter than I like."
"Prost!!!"
"Drinkability: Just like any Imperial Stout, it shouldn't be drank for refreshment. It should only be drank when you really feel like a savory beer."
"Overall: Exceptional. Gives me a bit of that Black IPA feel, but kicked up a couple notches into stout territory. Would like to try the other Yeti variations, but likely won't if they're much more than a bottle of the regular Yeti."
"Maybe 2 years is the sweet spot for this beer, because it's my favorite from Great Divide - even if not near my favorite in this category."
"D: One is enough for me, I definitely wouldn't drink two or more."
"I find it odd that I've had the wood-aged varieties of this beer before the base version. Go figure. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, and some light coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, though the spotlight is definitely on the roasted malts, the coffee (slightly more intense), and the (now dark) chocolate. The body is on the lighter side of heavy, with a very light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, a standout of the style, especially in terms of cost and availability."
"This beer has improved dramatically with 1 year on it and has mellowed out compared to drinking it with only a month after the bottled on date. This is by far the best Russian Imperial Stout i've ever had in my life."
"Pours an oily black color with a two finger head wirth great retention and lacing. Lots of coffee and espresso in the aroma, with some milk chocolate and roasted malt. Roasted malt pops up in the taste as well, with some coffee and faint chocolate.Silky mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Drinkability- This is a great beer, goes down really smoothly."
"D - did they use Kent Goldings as the bittering on these? I keep getting that vibe more and more as it warms. Anyway, drinkability is very good and I am glad this comes in a bomber because more and more flavors present themselves as temperatures change."
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, sweet coffee and chocolate. In the taste, dry coffee, chocolate, and roasty malt. A smooth and a medium too big bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee taste in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol and great flavor."
"Full soft body, decent carbonation, smooth and pleasant on the palate. Great drinking and flavor, alcohol is almost invisible even at 9.5%. This is one of those beers that I forget about on occasion, but am reminded every once in a while of how delicious it really is."
"Although I prefer the oak-aged Yeti, I do enjoy this stout quite a lot. Upon first taste, the beer is very hardy, but as you drink it becomes excessively palatable. I could definitely drink a couple of pints of this beer, even with it being a year old."
"Overall this beer is definitely a solid, classic flavored imperial stout. Nothing really makes it stand out and I prefer its oaked variations though."
"Enjoyed at the Black Dog in Urbana, IL: a great place for BBQ and beer. See my Beerfly review."
"The CPJ"
"Overlall its a decent stout but not my favorite."
"D: Great drinkability. Its a big bruiser and very rich, but I could have a few no problem."
"This beer pours an oily midnight black with a ever so light dark, dark khaki head that quickly dissipates and laces the glass. It smells of sweet milk chocolate and dark roasted malts. It tastes very sweet. The flavors include milk chocolate, light coffee, possibly some oak and some vanilla. It is a little too sweet for my liking. The mouthfeel is the best aspect. Like a lot of Great Divide's beers, this one has a thick, soapy mouthfeel to it that coats the mouth. It goes down smoothly but is just too sweet to drink multiples of at once. Solid beer, not great."
"This is one fine beer. Not often do stouts get this hoppy, and it is very becoming of the brew. I'm not huge on stouts but fortunately my roommate turned me on to this one. Drinkability is not so high due to thickness, but that's ok!"
"D - This is one tasty stout...I tried this the day after having a TenFIDY and I must say I prefer this one...huge roasted characteristic through out the entire beer plus lots of chocolate...a very nicely done imperial stout...I'd like to try aged versions"
"OVERALL: Yeti is, without a doubt, the best readily available imperial stout in the USA. In fact, it is better than at least 90% of the limited release stouts out there as well. Wonderful, bold flavor profile, and a look worthy of top prize. This is the imperial stout I compare all others to, and up to this point, very few can even hold a candle to this fine example of the brewing art. Cheers to Great Divide for making such a gem, and cheers again for making it easily available to a large portion of the beer drinking world."
"D - A very bold, hoppy stout that that is expressly bitter. A good one to split with someone else; very good but I wouldn't recommend more than one at a single sitting. One of the better beers I've had, but there's other stouts I would reach for first."
"Feel free to travel across the country, shell out for rare barrel-aged variations, spend hours in line-ups, cram like sardines into limited release parties or blow hundreds of dollars on Ebay but you're not likely to find anything better than the Yeti (or any of its spin-offs for that matter). This is one of the unrivaled series in the whole of American craft brewing."
"D- Easy to drink and just a solid and great example of an Imperial Stout. Really opens up as it warms."
"D: This beer is way to drinkable for the abv. One of the best ive had and shouldve grabbed sooner,This might be one of my favorite beers ever."
"D - A delicious RIS that doesn't disappoint and worthy of the high ranking it has. For the high ABV, i'm finding this very easy to enjoy."
"D - Exceptional for the style, I drank a bomber with a NY strip and could easily drink more. About as ""sessionable"" as a big stout gets."
"Glass: Snifter."
"Has a full mouthfeel that would make it tough to drink more than 2, but this is definitely a nice stout that has a complex flavor."
"This is one of the very best Imperial Stouts I've had to date. I find that chocolate flavors derived from malts turn out better than those from actual chocolate in beers, and this is a prime example of that. This is wonderfully graceful for its abv."
"Yeti is definitely the hoppiest stout I've come across. I've been a fan of this one, although it's not my top stout. Well crafted, recommended."
"Drinkabilty - This is a bold stout beer. Not so much as sweet and smooth, more alcohol and malt influenced stout. Not for the week. Its 9.5% so i wouldnt recommend drinking more then 2. Its not as smooth and easy drinking as alot of stouts. Very good brew, espically if you enjoy strong russian stouts."
"Very Dark like motor oil with a slight light brown head. laces the glass nicely. The ABV is nicely masked with a creamy chocolate taste. Will definitely be coming back to this beer."
"Pleasant enough beer, but has a deficiency in some areas where it needs reinforcing. A bit weak on the body that allows the booze to blaze through a bit too much. Good, just not great."
"D: A sipper due to its strength; however, something about the flavor (while still very enjoyable) didn't keep me coming back to it with as much desire as I have done with many other imperial stouts. I liked this glass, but probably won't be having another for a while."
"The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is impressive, with coffee grounds, dark chocolate, licorise, and some noticeable underlying hoppy bitterness. As a result, there's a very impressive sweet and bitter aroma profile going on. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this complex beer, though I thought it was dominated by flavors of licorise, dark chocolate and cherry vanilla. Still, what's really striking is the underlying hoppy bitterness in this beer, which counters the considerable sweetness in this beer rather well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a long sweet and bitter finish. Drinkability isn't bad, though the obvious high alcohol, sweetness and licorise detract just a bit. Still, while this beer is very much a sipper, it's nevertheless quite impressive and delicious.... a very easy to appreciate and enjoy beer from Great Divide. Excellent!"
" I also have had the oaked version of this brew and prefer it to the original. It is more smooth. I have nothing against this brew at all. In fact, it is great but I prefer others."
"This is an intense imperial stout in all respects. It is a good beer in small amounts."
"I loved this beer. This is a fantastic American Imperial Stout. I'm surprised that side-by-side I preferred this to the oak-aged version, which blends better but doesn't have the raw power and robustness of this one. That's what I'm looking for in the style."
"D: Delicious and drinkable. As a fan of stouts, this is a treat. All my notes said: ""love it love it love it"" which I think sums it up perfectly."
"DB- For the style, this one goes down smooth and easily. It has the rough edge I love for the style but is silky smooth. Kind of like Racer 5, this is a true staple of a beer style. It baffles me that someone could not like this beer but I guess that would be full proof of everyone having unique palates."
"This beer is called Yeti because it is a beast! It's black color is only matched by the abyss of space and the dark cocoa head on the surface makes me want to lick it off the top. The smell is extraordinarily interesting. There are the normal RIS smells: the caramel, cocoa, coffee, malt, and booze. There is a hop note that is just as potent as the others which is a floral citrusy pine note from the hops used to make this beer. The hops do also carry on into the taste of the beer. The beer tastes of dark roast whether it be by the darkest of chocolate or some rich roasted coffee, but only the pine flavor comes through. The hop flavor is however weaker in the taste than it is on the nose. The mouthfeel has roast that has a bitterness that cuts through the what would normally be a smooth mouthfeel, and the alcohol doesn't help it strive to perfection either. This is a pretty delicious beer overall and I wouldn't mind having more of it."
"Overall, I imagine myself sitting in some cold Colorado mountain, hanging out in the snow and drinking this very tasty beer."
"I found this bottle at granite liquors in weymouth with a bottled date of april 22, 2009. So good"
"D - A fun Imperial Stout, definitely drinkable. Would taste it again, for sure."
"The beer is milkshake thick and I think I've only had a beer or two ever with this much viscosity. The only superior beer that comes to mind in New Holland Night Tripper, so, given that I've had over 300 RIS in my life, this is truly exceptional. The carbonation is creamy and delicious and roast and only a hint of booze linger. This beer is smooth and enjoyable. A great stout that everyone should try!"
"No doubt about it, Yeti is one seriously hefty brew. A case could be made that it is more of a Black IPA than a Russian Imperial Stout. If you don't have a serious threshold for both roasted barley and hop bitterness, you may want to try something else."
"A very good, big stout. Complex and a pleasure to drink. A sipper."
"D: Very easy to drink imperial stout. Great character and balance make this a really good value beer that is far tastier than I imagined."
"D- Very tasty, but high in alcohol and price. This might be a beer for a special occasion and one at a time."
"D--A very drinkable Imperial Stout. Not an overwhelming alcohol flavor. Only a slight bitterness at the end. A very good brew to work on for a while."
"Would not hesitate for a second to pick a second (or third, or fourth) Yeti up if I am lucky enough to see it again any time soon."
"D: yeah, this is a good beer. Flavors and alcohol are too strong to be a session beer, but it is very tasty and goes down smooth despite the high alcohol."
"D - Delicious and scary! This is a beer that you are shocked how high the ABV is because the flavor masks it so well. I could see myself sharing a few of these with friends and turning into a YETI!"
"Full feel has enough hop bite and roasted texture to keep the malts from being cloying. Yet, at the same time this is a meal in a glass which keeps one from consuming too much too fast. Would be nice to split about 5 ways with some mixed chocolates for a decadent dessert. Yeti, consider yourself redeemed!"
"I love my malty beers and thouroughly enjoyed this one...my other half is more of a balanced ale drinker and didn't really care for this. To each his own right!"
"This goes down nicely for the alcohol content. Creamy smooth."
"This is already one of my favorite beers. It's hard to explain why since really it is just a sweet, heavy stout. However, it's so well done and balanced that you can't help but love it."
"For the way the beer poured, it's nicely carbonated and not too thick or chewy. It's a sipper, but I could sit and sip this with no complaints."
"D: Very easy to drink."
"D: Not a fan. Way too roasty. The smokey flavor was very overwhelming. Finished about half and gave the rest to my girlfriend (who seemed to like it)"
"D-definitely a sipper, but a good variation on the style from folks who clearly have a handle on what they are doing"
"Thanks to a buddy of mine I am finally trying this one. Pours and opaque black with a 1/2 inch tan frothy head that simmers down to a ring. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, wood and coffee. Yeti tastes of dark roasted malt, mocha and wood. Yeti has a creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. I find drinkability to be high due to my shear respect for the brew. Love it."
"aroma is typical of the style, with notes of bitter chocolate and coffee. taste follows with the same flavors. the beer is thick, coats the mouth, good for sipping. I didn't notice any alcohol burn. good to balance a rich dinner."
"The alcohol comes out quite a bit as it warms, giving you a very big warmth. With that in mind, along with the heavy hop presence, it would be best to mellow for at least a year. Also best to limit yourself to one."
"drinkability - price brings drinkability down on this one and at 9.5%, this is a sipper, there may be some better value out there in the category of Russian Imeprial Stouts, but this was no doubt an enjoyable beer"
"9.5% puts severe hindrance on consumption amounts. But I'll be feeling quite good at the end of this bomber. There was a lot of hype around this beer, but I daresay Yeti has lived up to it."
"the great divide imperial stout is a good cold weather drink. the taste is ripe with chocolate barley which gives this beer a great blackened flavor. strong bitterness and a hearty aroma come through. on top of the great flovor, there is a yeti on the label- which really goes well with the taste and strength of this beer."
"Verdict: Delicious, enormous and like Satan - only right for some."
"D: With most russian imperails that I have tried I find them to be too overbearing, with too much complexitiy and no real balance... this beer is complex but balanced you can pick out the flavors that make it great. I am glad I finaly tried it and this is a beer I will try ove rand over again. Bravo!"
"Decadent and luxurious. Mmmmm."
"I will certainly try Yeti again, but I might age my next bottle for awhile. This particular bottle had roughly seven months on it and it still felt raw and aggressive on my palate. I generally prefer slightly more mellow Imperial Stouts and I imagine this would turn into that with a little more bottle time."
"I can't say enough good things about this beer. It blew me away."
"D- This beer was a nice drinker. ABV was nicely shown and not over the top. The hops in this was a little faded I thought."
"D - Drinkability is high. The alcohol is masked incredibly well, and there isn't one taste that dominates or hurts the flavor. I would like to try this fresh to see how the hops add to it, but I would gladly enjoy one this age or older as well."
"What a brew. Poured into a Guinness Pint Glass. Great two finger head, brownish colored. Black as night, could not see through it even when held up to the light! Smeel was of Coffe and Booze. Tasted like dark chocolate at the beg, with a coffee aftertaste. Smooth as silk. At almost 10% ABV drinking one is all you need to get you through a cold winters night. Will def. be buying more of these."
"Cheers!"
"D: My experience with the style is limited so I'm still getting the hang of typical tastes, feels, etc. Overall I like this beer. Great for a cold night watching football."
"O - Very damn drinkable. While I can certainly taste the 9.5% ABV, it didn't stop me from finishing this in record time. This will always be a favorite of mine."
"Heavy/thick mouthfeel. Very good drinkability for the 9.5%"
"Drinkability: very pleasant; not overpowering but rather smooth with subtle aftertaste. Would definitely purchase again"
"Drink- I want all the other ones now. I've created a monster."
"I have had this beer many times and thought I would put a little something on 'paper'. I make a point to keep my cellar stocked with all versions of Yeti. This black as night beer gives you a very nice mocha brown head that accompanies you through the rest of your glass. Roasted chocolate, coffee, sweet sugars are the smell. The taste follows the nose, delicious. The sweetness isn't too overbearing and is perfectly balanced with the hops, just enough bitterness to notice but not in your face. This heavy beer is super creamy and so easy to drink. The only bad part is that you'll want to drink as much as possible, which, with an ABV pushing 10%, might not be a great idea! Amazing beer."
"This beer is exceptional no more needed to say"
"D-Great beer overall. A shinning example of the style. Classic stout with some hope character.ABV is hidden expertly."
"D - I really like Yeti. It is a great intro into the world of big flavored stouts. I was hoping the nitro-tap would make the feel a bit better but it may have actually dulled it a bit."
"Drinkability- too powerful for me to have more than one or two."
"O: Well, this kind of hoppiness is really not to my liking, so I can't drink much of this. Amazingly, the hops seem to overwhelm both the alcohol, the roastedness, and the maltiness!"
"D - The Yeti has a certain richness in the coffee/chocolate flavors to it that I thoroughly enjoyed, balanced well with strong hops. Wonderful job masking the alcohol, I didn't notice it a bit. This is one I will be picking up again."
"My dessert brew for thanksgiving!"
"Great tasting brew, but this is a heavy hitter. 1 was satisfying."
"Pours a very thick black body, with a thin brown head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee hit the nose. The beer has a grainy feel to it. Tastes of bitter and chocolate up front, with a taste of coffee in the finish. Creamy thick on the palate. Nice stout. Nice balance."
"Drinkability - the nice balance and the lack of the aforementioned heavy sweetness in the aftertaste makes me think that, apart from the alcohol being up there, I could drink a couple of these."
"D: Overall, an enjoyable RIS but it isn't the first one I would reach for."
"Overall, i thought this beer was ok. I like hoppy finishes in my beer but im used to it with an IPA/DIPA not with a stout. I like my stouts creamy, sweet, and lightly hopped. Also, i wasn't a big fan of this tangy taste i was getting on the finish. it was weird."
"decent tasting but doubt I'd drink a bomber by myself. One glass is perfect although I doubt I'll be seeking this out again. i will however try some of the other yeti's like espresso and oak aged yeti."
"What a smooth drinking stout, everything about it is creamy, the flavors are more creamy but not syrupy milk chocolate with a bit of dark coco powder and espresso. the bottle says tons of hops, but im not noticing them here much."
"I'd also like to see how ageing one of these would turn out. The chocolate would come more pronounced and I'd hope that some sweetness would come through a bit more to make this a stellar beer."
"Overall: A great beer that really aged well. A very intense beer! Great job Great Divide!"
"This beers seems to come out in layers. Each sip unveils another amazing layer and I wish I could keep sipping throughout the night. Everything blends together so well. Amazing"
"Good stuff. So much happening in your mouth. Love it."
"I this is a great beer that I hope to revisit someday!"
"Looks great, tastes ok. The earthy, bitter, dry, roastiness is just too much for me. Not my favorite."
"One of the best imperial stouts out there. It does lack a little complexity though. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed the potent hop mix in this stout, the balance is masterful."
"This is truly a treat of a stout, only complaint I can think of is huge price ($15 4-pack) and it could use a bit more complexity I suppose. (Eh, that's what the Oak Aged Yeti is for.) But it is what it is and that is...excellent."
"Drinkability is near exceptional for the abv and depth of this beer. A hoppy imperial stout that can stand toe to toe with many a whale and harder to find RIS. Well done, Great Divide."
"D: though I'm usually a fan of stouts that trend more toward the roasty side of things rather than the hoppy side, this Yeti worked for me. The strong hops combined with a striking and distinct roastiness to create new, unintended flavors that reminded me of a walk through a forest -- much like the elusive beast this beer's named for. Only the barrel-aged yeti remains..."
"I wouldn't count this amongst my favorites for style. It's a personal preference I'm sure, but I don't think the floral quality helps in this beer...I really just would prefer less hoppiness...and it just seems a little thin in general."
"Overall yeti is a beast a delicious and powerful beast. An amazing imperial stout. It has a great balance of hops and malt yet is still remains very stout like in flavor."
"This stout is far better than I expected from the bottle and better than the examples I'd previously tasted. This one is worthy of a place high in the stout rankings."
"A really heavy stout, nothing for the weak!"
"/end review."
"D- The flavors were a little more mellow that the nose would have led me to believe. The alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms but doesn't deter. A pretty good beer to warm you up on a chilly fall night in Wisconsin."
"Just recently started getting Great Divide down in San Diego so I figured I should try this one out before moving on to the oak aged Yeti. I enjoyed this beer in a tulip glass. The pour was very thick and dark with some slight mocha colored head. The smell was of heavy roasted malts with some underlying dark fruit. On my initial taste of this beer, I noticed heavy roasted coffee flavors and some slight chocolate with a slight alcohol burn. The heavy coffee put me off at first, but by my third taste it had grown on me. The carbonation was just about right for this beer and as a result it was rather easy to drink for 9.5%. I very much enjoyed this beer and could easily drink too much of it very quickly and I am looking forward to trying some more of Great Divide's beers."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I would highly recommend Yeti to anyone."
"D: This is really nice. You can enjoy a bottle for a very long time - it takes it's time!"
"Very nice stout. Much better imo than the chocolate version, which I, for some reason, had before I had the base brew."
"Drinkability - While the beer hides its alcoholic content surprisingly well, I'm glad I picked up a 12oz single of this rather than a bomber. I am pretty sure it would have been a chore to finish off a bomber, but 12oz was easy enough. While not my favorite RIS to be honest, not bad at all."
"No negatives to this beast aside from a semi-high price tag,that's acceptable for an elite stout."
"Very smooth and classy alcohol wise but leaves you with a nice palate kicking bitterness in the finish."
"D: This is a heavy-duty RIS, and one 12 oz. bottle will definitely do it for me, but whoo baby is it a good one."
"black color with a solid brown head. head doesn't retain for very long, but wonderful lacing follows this brew from start to finish. the smell is of delicious malt chocolate. the flavor is also very sweet, very pleasant chocolate. no bitterness and very smooth. thick mouthfeel, almost feels like a hot cocoa (but cold). extremely drinkable for the ABV. a tremendous imperial stout. awesome!"
"D: This is certainly a dessert beer, like the other Yeti, but without the oak aging, it is interesting that the vanilla flavors are still present."
"In all, this is a great go-to stout when you're looking for what it provides: a solid, roasty, bitter, and ultimately tasty stout. Definitely worth picking up, but if you're in an area that has its brothers, I'd say pick them up and complete the family. Thumbs up, Great Divide, and thanks Stone for picking them up for CA distribution!"
"D - very smooth and easy to drink. Has a bit of dryness on the back end that makes you want to drink more of this beer. Defiantly a sipping beer because of the ABV"
"Cheers..."
"Bottled Dec. 21, 2009. My first Yeti experience! Pours a jet black that doesn't even turn red or brown around the edges when held up to light. Medium sized brown head. Looks beautiful! Scent is quite roasty with light hints of hoppiness and fruit. Nice coffee/chocolate aroma. Taste is very delightful. Not as burnt tasting as was expected. The hop profile is not as strong as I thought it would be either (probably due to being almost 10 months old). This is sweeter than a lot of IRSs I've had in the past. The alcohol is somewhat present at the end. Strong sugar and vanilla flavors. Mouthfeel is OH SO CREAMY and full bodied. Drinkability is quite high."
"The mouthfeel is very full and coating with a pretty long finish and a bit of a lingering hopiness. This is an ok example for infront of the fireplace. Although i'm not a man of a thousand hops."
"A very medium-heavy body with a delightful nature, hides the 9.5%ABV very well. Smooth and light carbonation that fits this beer well. Very drinkable and enjoyable on a nice rainy day."
"This is a great stout, excellent rendition of the style and unfortunately I think gets lost and ignored in favor of its buffed up (oak/barrel/double chocolate) yeti cousins."
" stout. Certainly warms the chest."
"I've had other Great Divide beers before, and ons I've tried are good quality. Chalk Yeti in there too. In fact, I prefer this regular version over the oak aged variety (heresy!). Welcome to Cali, Yeti."
"This is my least favorite yeti, it's good don't get me wrong but after having the others it seems just so tame. Chocolate and coffee are there, but it's a bit too sharp for me adding the barrl makes it all mellow and the coffee/chocolate versions add more smooth complexity to me."
"D - If you like imperial stouts that this is definitely a beer worth trying. It's very good, I am sure better aged, and also comes in some other variations that I am anxious to try."
"Very drinkable. Looking forward to my second bottle calling me from the fridge..."
"Solid offering from Great Divide, new in SoCal!"
"Overall quite good. The earthiness is a little much and there seems like there's some oxidation. A bit more sweetness would be welcomed."
"stepped up. Had the basic qualities that you would expect from a brew like this but obviously you can tell they added a lot of hops to the process which I found very enjoyable similar to Night Stalker. With that said I would really like to try the barrel aged versions and expresso/coffee ones as well"
"D - Moderate to low. Big alcohol and malt profile make this a sipper for me. For the style however, this brew is on the higher side of drinkability."
"Drinkability: This beer hides it's alcohol pretty well, I'd say. It's a full-bodied beer, but still quite drinkable."
"D- Very good and will revisit. Oak-aged seems intriguing as the woody roastedness is already apparent"
"d - A very solid stout. It was a lot hoppier than I expected overall. I thought the nose was better than the taste; I just wish the taste had a little less coffee. None the less, a very good RIS. I think I like the barrel aged and oak aged yeti better than this one, but I like it more than the chocolate and espresso versions. Would definitely have again."
"Overall, a nice stout where the bitterness too often dominates and the backing flavors aren;t allowed to shine. I prefer the Chocolate and Espresso versions of this much more than the base beer. Certainly worth a try and a good candidate for cellaring in my opinion."
"D: Overall, the differences between a bottle with a half a year of age versus a bottle with two and a half years of age wasn't substantial. I would say the biggest difference is that the 08 bottle had almost no bitterness to it, which made it a little more pleasant to drink. I was surprised at how much bitterness the 2010 bottle actually had. Also the coffee acidity had died down. Flavor wise they were pretty close though, and they both looked and pretty much smelled the same. All in all, this beer definitely ages well, and as far as I can tell, the longer you wait to drink it the better. Scores based on the 08 bottle."
"D- On the hoppy side for a stout, but brought a new balance than what I'm used to with this style."
"D: This is definitely a slow-sipping brew, and the longer you spend with it the better the payoff. I wouldn't think of pairing this stout with a dessert: it IS a dessert."
"Huge body and thick mouthfeel. Sticky and resinous at first, becomes creamy as the beer warms and the tongue gets acclimatized."
"ISO - more '08 Great Divide Yeti"
"Not a bad beer, slightly hoppier then I like in an imperial stout. The label boasts 75 IBU's, the hops may be slightly out of balance with the malt. This is not something I can get without much trouble. If I could find this beer locally I would go for round two."
"D - It doesnt get much better than this!!! This is a great example of the style and IMO one of the best. Flavor is huge and robust, and the body is exactly as it should be."
"D - This is super easy to drink for how heavy of a beer it is. I don't want to know how many calories is in one because I could down a few..."
"D - For a RIS this is very high. ABV is not too crazy and the beer is delicious."
"D-- Excellent drinkability. Can do 2-3 of these, thank you. Best beer Great Divide makes. If you like malt and chocolate this has to be at the top of the list. Does nto feel like a 9.5 ABV at all. Well done. 4.5 A 4.35"
"I love this style and this is another great contribution. Very well done."
"Plenty of roasted malts - make no mistake about it, this is a big beer. Starts off pretty sweet, with an almost milk stout-like taste. The bitterness follows quickly, with plenty of dark-roasted coffee notes (think Sumatra x5). Finishes pretty sweet, with just a dash of citrusy hops. Leaves a sticky chocolate coating on my lips. Once again, the fruity characters run amok but only n the background, like little Oompa Loompas. Mouthfeel is thick but not viscous. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, although by the end of the bottle I'm made well aware of its presence. It's a sipper for sure, but I'm sipping dangerously fast."
"The flavor of this beer is amazing, but the texture really stands out. Wonderfully layered and balanced. This is a go to RIS."
"Price = $7.97 at Whole Foods (Bowery)"
"This is a stout. It is heavy and has bold, roasty flavors."
"Overall it looks amazing, smells great, and taste is great, but it's a situational beer for me. Cold weather, late in the evening, after a steak dinner, etc."
"Overall a very complex and delicious beer that I would have again, it's my third review of great divide Yetis and all of them share the same traits but the coffeness (if you can say that way) it whats differentiates them."
"Drinkability: I had to be really, really careful not to down this brew in one, long, and impressively delicious pull. This is a big beer. The bottom of the glass came way, way too quickly. Very well done."
"wow, this is a really fantastic beer. I've had this beer sitting around for a while and hopefully these will be available to me for years to come. The beer pours pitch black with a beautiful deep, rich, tan head. Smooooth, so smooth. If you see this on the shelf and have never had it. BUY it."
"5 oz sample at the Mondial. Pours pitch black with good looking mocha head. Aroma is mostly chocolate with some roasted grain and coffee. The roastiness and coffee are more present in the taste. The bitter hop bite is also a nice addition. This one is pretty heavy but could use more compelxity. I prefered the oak aged Yeti. Maybe not the best place to drink such a sipper."
"Overall: Delicious. Why did I wait so long to try this beer?"
"Atmosphere pretty much rocks. Tall, dark, and handsome appearance. Nose is very prominent with great balance of tones. Flavor is not complex, but very full, and very flavorful (kinda' redundant). Overall, this is a great quaff."
"not a hard one to drink. a few harsh qualities keep this from being smooth, but it is definitely tasty."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable, nice mellow finish adds to this"
"This is a very drinkable imperial stout, another very good beer from Great Divide."
"Taste is malty, lots of coffee, which adds some bitterness.I'd say it has some fruity profile as well, prunes are noticeable. Alcohol is coming through but it is not overwhelming and on rather warming side. Very thick, reach stout, fairly drinkable. Very well brewed."
"Overall, this is such a well-crafted beer. This tastes nothing like other imperial stouts I've had and ages phenomenally."
"Very nice beer. Will seek it and its variations out again."
"Full bodied incredibly drinkable impy stout and definitely one of my favorite straight up imperial stouts."
"The flavors, though complex when aggressively researched, are for the most part disappointing. If I could enjoy everything in every sip, it would have been a great beer. For this alone I can only feel it out as a good beer. Even the nose was on the whole a overly simplistic presence. Good for trying, not my top choice for this style."
"Can't drink a lot of these due to the high abv, but easy to sip. Easier than other beers of the style. Delicious on so many levels, tastes different every 5 minutes as it warms. If you drink this one quickly you are really losing out."
"D: Regardless of the season I could and would drink this all day long!"
"Warming all over. Light effervescence. Full-bodied, creamy and chewy. An awesome brew. Have two, slowly."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were on point. The chocolate was pronounced and smooth. This thick bodied stout is no backseat driver. This is a kick ass stout. Big on flavor. Go home if you like coors light this is no Guiness. Ata boy Jeets."
"Drinkability - this is an awesome offering from Great Divide - 9.5% ABV yet it doesn't taste like it should be that strong. However, I consider it a 'night and day' beer - almost guinness-like smoothness combined with a nice but not overpowering IPA kick mashed together with a good variety of flavors we tend to like in our stouts. This one's a winner and if I had ever wanted to enjoy a beer in milkshake form, this would be that selection."
"I had to pour the rest of a GBP12.50 bottle and that hurt my soul deep down where it really hurts whenever you have to pour away abeer even though you may not like it or even be able to finish it."
"T/M: Bitter chocolate flavor coats the tongue. Not much carbonation; beer feels a bit syrupy and thick. Slight prune/date fruitiness follows the chocolate. No alcohol burn while the beer is colder, but as it warms it becomes much more complex; chocolate, coffee, hoppy fruitiness mingle and dance on the tongue. Alcohol becomes more noticeable, but the beer remains sip-able the entire time."
"O: If yetis drank beer, this is likely the one they would choose. Monstrously hefty, the label is correct is describing it as ""an onslaught of the senses."" This is not a caveat, but a recommendation! An imperial stout which fulfils my cravings for strong, dark, bitter, stout beer. Highly recommended, praised, even, but not obviously drinkable. I could not -- and would not want to -- drink more than one of these in an evening. However, I will definitely buy many more of these."
"A dark drink, with a mouthful of dark fruits hops. The color is just great to admire in a glass lacing is thick. Taste recommendable to anyone. You can taste the burnt caramel, fruits and hops, masking the high alcohol contents of course not in a extreme way though. Smooth down to the last sip."
"It's very good."
"pours your usual RIS dark, almost black color with a finger and a half, maybe 2 of a tan head with sort of burgundy notes to it. very good looking beer. smell is of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate... also common of the style. IMO taste exceeds the nose with more hops, stronger dark chocolate and bold coffee flavors interwoven; alcohol present but not by much. mouthfeel is extraordinary: big, full, and luxurious. this guy is a winner. drinkability is a bit of a dilemma... i will definitely have another - i can't wait to do so - just not tonight; i'm already full."
"Notes: I have tried the Oak Aged Yeti before having this one. I really enjoyed the heavier mouthfeel and bolder flavors of the Oak Aged; I would recommend the regular version before this one, especially if you are not use to large beers. This is a fantastic Imperial Stout that would be great to try after being cellared for a year or two longer. I paired this bottle with some dark chocolate, that complemented this beer."
"I have an Espresso Oak Aged bomber in the cellar, which I'll be saving for a special occasion. This is an excellent beer without a doubt, and I'll be sure to grab a few more the next time the opportunity presents."
"bought a bottle and drank it out of a snifter. It had the appearance of a little carbonation, very dark body with a thin,dark caramel head. An expresso smell was the first thing my nose picked up along with dark malts. the taste was typicial of stout but this one was very robust and went down smooth. It was very drinkable and would highly recommend this to anyone."
"This is my first Great Divide beer and I think I picked a winner. These guys know how to make a stout, I'll give them that. Now I need to try some of their other stuff. This is the first beer I've drank in the past couple of days that has made me want to seek out more from the brewery."
"D: Great nightcap or dessert beer. Equally good on a cold night. Kinda too thick and heavy to drink to many, but very smooth and easy because of the flavor."
"D- its reeeally powerful, so make sure to treat this like a sipper. But DAMN is it good. Fantastic beer"
"Medium to full body, slightly hot strong roast in the back. There is no aftertaste but the roasted malt flavors linger for a while on the palate. I don't feel the rarity in this beer like I felt in the barrel aged version but I may like this one better. Don't believe the hype. I prefer this to the other versions by a lot."
"Poured a deep dark brown with maroon highlights with a finger of head that left good blotchy lacing on the glass. I got roasted malts and chocolate aromas with hints of coffee and faint hop notes. Up front the taste was chocolaty with a roasted malts and a nice hop bite that had coffee and earthy woody accents. The beer was full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a silky slight sweet but bitter finish. Pretty decent RIS from great divide that drank quite well. I would definitely want to try out the other variations of this brew."
"This is a great example of the style, with all of the features that make a great Russian Imperial Stout: pitch black in color, roasty and rich aroma, slightly sweet taste balanced with coffee and chocolate, chewy and luxurious mouthfeel, a smooth finish. This is a great beer with the excellent flavor profile from the complex malts and yeasts, but still finishes dry and with enough bitterness to make this drinkable."
"D - Man what a brew, I'll be looking out for more Great Divide."
"M = Heavy body, great mouthcoating, luscious feel, perhaps just a bit hot and biting from a combination of alcohol and carbonation."
"D - Overall, this is a good representation of a Russian Imperial Stout. However, the hops seem over the top even for that style. Perhaps it's a West Coast take on the style and I prefer a more traditional take, but this beer left me wishing for more balance."
"D - Its a RIS so it isn't what I'd call easy drinking but it doesn't have anything making it more difficult to drink than your normal RIS. Not as delicious as the Oak Aged or Chocolate Yeti but still a real good RIS. I would drink this one again. One more thing is this comes in 12oz bottles so it is good if I just want a smaller serving size than your normal RIS."
"This was pretty close to a perfect brew for me! Can't wait till they get to SD!"
"M/D - Full bodied but not overly viscous. Very easy drinking for such a large beer."
"being my first experience with GDBC I am very pleased and will continue to try everything I can from them"
"D: Very, Very, Very, drinkable, but at 9.5 you may want to show some respect for the Yeti and induldge at a slow and careful pace."
"Well this is right up there with the very best RIS 's IMO. Simply all around great beer that is very drinkable and does sneek up on you a bit."
"pretty drinkable beer, good RIS, look forward to trying the oak aged version"
"A very good imperial stout that's transformed into something special when its thrown into a barrel. I always knew there was a quality beer underneath all that oak, and it was a pleasure to try it at Mondial!"
"Overall, this beer is a good example of the style and a well crafted brew. With over a year of cellaring, the hops are still well defined and I feel that this beer could still go for another 3 years. The complexity is decent, but it leaves you wanting just a bit more. However, this is an easy beer to obtain and is reasonably priced, so I will definitely be picking more up for the cellar sometime in the near future. I also can't wait to try the oak-aged and the barrel-aged at some point. This beer can definitely improve from some wood aging."
"D: Good drinkability for a 9.5% Imp. Stout. Very comforting beer to relax with. I could use a little more complexity on the flavor profile but other than that this is a very solid brew."
"I enjoyed this beer with neighbors on a warm spring night. The beer poured a nice dark rich color, with a nice foamy head. A nice lacing was present throughout the drink. The beer was smooth with excellent malty flavors. The hops rounded this beer out beautifully, excellent flavor without the bitterness."
"I can't wait till the day when I line up the Yeti's and drink 'em side by side."
"Moderate carbonation, but still more than expected. Nice full mouthfeel and a nicely complex taste make this one a pleasure to sip."
"Review must be over 250 characters and less than 5,000. Apparently we shouldn't be snobs, but shouldn't not be snobs, either."
"D- This is a heavy beer. The alcohol is hidden very well, the taste is remarkable but the overall weight of the beer would make it a good sipper after dinner. Would last me a good hour."
"Overall this is an incredible beer. It would probably make it into my top 10 list of best beers I have ever had and definitely one of the best imperial stouts I have had. I am anxious to try the other versions of the Yeti."
"D - A very good RIS. The hops become more prevalent as I continue to drink this & it is a little hoppier than I like for a RIS, but otherwise an excellent beer."
"D: The drying effect of this beer makes it quite a sipper, would certainly play a game of poker while enjoying one or two of these. Fantastic beer, just needs time to be enjoyed."
"Great brew! Highly recommend!"
"D. This ranks up with Old Rasputin, one of my favorite imperial stouts. I'm glad I finally got around to trying it; I'll need to hunt down some of the aged versions of this as well as a six pack to cellar."
"Poured into a New Belgium chalice deep black with a two finger dark tan head with good retention and great lacing all the way down. The smell is of rich carmel and chocolate notes. There is a slight alchol presence in the nose. The taste is of rich carmelized malts. There's also some cocoa in there just like the nose. No noticable alcohol burn for this high of a abv. The mouthfeel is smooth and finishs slightly dry."
"D: Very much a sipping beer, and I can see this on a cold winter's night. But the coffee flavor was dominant for me, and maybe a bit too much for my particular taste to enjoy this on a regular basis. I even asked the bartender if by chance this was the expresso oak-aged version of Yeti, but as far as we could tell, it was not. Still a wonderful full flavored imperial stout."
"D: Definitley a sipper, but a flavorful beer. Well worth experiencing."
"Taste hits just like nose, bitter chocolate, like baking cocoa, and some coffee notes that taste slightly unfresh. I also pick up a little bit of soy sauce, which is quite off-putting. It actually really hurts the taste in my opinion, because after 2 sips when I narrowed in that soy sauce flavor, it has become all I can focus on. Very tough to pick up on the other nuances of the beer when all I can think about is how much I hate soy sauce. If it wasn't in there, then this could be much higher in taste and in drinkability. I just can't see myself drinking this one very much. The mouthfeel is spot on, with great carbonation and a nice full thick robust body."
"It's a shame the closest I can find this one is Houston, but I'll be sure to look for it next time I'm there to get some more."
"Drink-ability- One bomber is more than enough for me. I'm new to RIS's and I would not want drink a lot of this."
"Just had a January of '09 12 oz. bottle of this that I found ""hiding"" at a local market. The colour was ebony with a thick khaki head. The aroma was tangy with brown sugar, molasses and Caramello. On the palate, a coating, viscous body with a smidge of hops, roasty malt, booze, a creamy cafe au lait character, and a long bitter cream and salt caramel finish. Yowza!"
"D - A total pleasure."
"I highly recommend trying it if you come across one!"
"A very good beer, but doesn't quite stand up to something like AleSmith Speedway Stout. A very solid (but not standout) imperial stout overall."
"Fantastic! Definitely recommend this for Imperial Stout-lovers"
"I was happy to find this so soon after trying the disappointing (to me- overpowering coffee) espresso version. As I suspected, the base beer is pretty damned good. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and a bit sticky, allowing the bitter sting of hops and burnt malts to linger in all the right places. Excellent balance between roasted and sweet flavors. Molasses, toasted wood, a touch of sherry. A bit boozy and citrusy in the finish. It's a little raw, but tasty, and I bet it gets even better with age. Picking up a few bottles to cellar is certainly tempting considering the very reasonable price point."
"D: A pleasure to drink, ABV is so well hidden. It's hard not to drink it fast, but slow it down a bit and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Because it is so thick it might not be as drinkable as others. My senses would go numb if I were to drink a few more."
"Drinkability: Fits the style. Alcohol well hidden. Interesting, relatively unique and tasty."
"Mouthfeel is full and has a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Great brew. Can't wait to re-visit soon!"
"Pours a deep, dark, almost opaque black color, with some beautiful mocha colored head. Aromas of roasted malt, dark chocolate, alcohol and earthy hops. On the palate, deep, dark roasted chocolate, alcohol and a bit of fresh brewed coffee. A wonderfully balanced, easy to drink imperial stout."
"Notes: Nice beer that is a good, hoppy stout. Not one that particularly blew me away, but a solid offering. Does have a lot of strong roasted flavor (most of the flavor components have a roasted taste to them). I would try it again if it were a reasonable price, but I won't really be searching for it."
"Drinkability: Well I can't have anything this rich more than once in an evening, but it's pretty damn good. The hoppiness threw me a bit, but overall quite nice. The mouthfeel and taste combined really make the beer outstanding."
"You can see that this is brown when pouring, but once it's in the glass it's black as night. Two solid fingers of thick, rich dark tan head. Odd for the style, but the first scent I noticed was hops. Then alcohol, chocolate, and espresso. The taste is phenomenal. Bitter chocolate, alcohol, ashes, espresso, piney hops, molasses, and plum. Pretty good viscosity, but I'd like it to be a hair thicker if I had to get nitpicky. I'm not a big stout fan, but this is the best tasting stout I've had. I liked it better than the highly regarded KBS I recently had. Fantastic."
"D - Great. It's not absolutely amazing, but I'm gonna try to trade for it again someday. Maybe the oak aged version ;)"
"I really like this beer, just is a step or two away from being ""great""."
"D: This is definitely my favorite of the 4 variants. I'll definitely seek it out again. I wouldn't call it world-class against many other imperial stouts, but to say it's upper-tier would be appropriate."
"Very good drinkability. It's a sipper, and as that it's an excellent beer."
"This beer is definitely recommended."
"Drinks well here- very tough beer-not for the faint of heart- but very little bite from its gravity."
"I had aged this beer for 4 months and was drunk with only 8 days remaining before its BBE date. How long the shop had this in stock for before I purchased it I am unaware. I could easily sip a few of these during the course of an afternoon and evening. A well crafted, complex stout that definitely needs seeking out if you have never had it before."
"D - I think that I have to try a fresh one to really compare being the first imperial stout that I have heard of with a shelf life. I wouldn't buy another blue label but that may be different fresh."
"(On-tap at Sonka's Irish Pub). Pours a great deep dark black with fantastic head, and just a bit of lacing. Excellent scent, a deep malty aroma with some roasted grains and a little bit of thick plum. Huge deep malty scent; hints of prune and plum, some roasted grains and slight coffee twinge, with a decent hop ending. Goes down quite good, thick with a hint of alcohol. An excellent impy stout."
"The alcohol seemed a little hotter than I expected for 9.5 ABV. I'd love to give this some time to mellow the bitterness and tame the booze. The chocolate and coffee hang out for a while, keeping me company while I watch BSG. I can't wait to revisit my cellared bottle in a year or two."
"The body is smooth and ever-so-creamy. Great sipper. Alcohol presence is not known in the flavor. Masked well by great bitter coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Slight sour bite on the backend, but nothing offputting. I really enjoyed this one. I've had a few of the various ""aged"" versions, but never had the original. Well done."
"D- one hell of a sipper"
"This is an amazing beer in a bottle and it's an amazing beer on draft. It was raining today and this beer was the perfect way to warm up. Unbelievable and great dark color, great malty smokey aroma, strong at 9.5 alcohol by volume but not too hot to enjoy a whole glass. I love this beer and get it ever time I see it."
"D: A pretty easy stout to take down, which could be trouble given that the 9.5% is very well hidden."
"I love Barley wines and I love RIS's; this beer is like a meeting of the two styles offering the best of what both styles have to offer. This is a must have."
"This is as easy as a 9.5% stout is going to drink. I like."
"Pours black with a brown head. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, rum and dark fruit. The flavor is roasted/burnt malt with chocolate. There is a nice amount of hop bitterness at the end. The aftertaste is highly roasted almost burnt malt. Thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation."
"D - I appreciate the art of brewing in bourbon barrels and this is true to this but I really can't ever get used to strong bourbon flavor in a beer. I really need to find the oak aged version..."
"These glasses always disappear way to quick. Distribute to CA, Great Divide!!"
"D: I could easily have three or four pints in one sitting. It goes really well with a juicy grilled hamburger."
"D- goes down easy. Easier than a lot of beers like it. Its just not living up to its oak aged brother."
"D: This is definitely a sipping beer, but a rather enjoyable one at that. That being said, I really couldn't have more than a couple of them in a row, even if the alcohol was much lower."
"22oz Bottle . A very dark black pour with a huge lasting faomy brown head , leaving sheeting and lace all down the glass , good amount of carbonation . Aroma is big and roasty , sweet caramel, toffee , rasins , char , nuts , and some spicy hops ( nice) . Flavor is huge roastyness , quite sweet , lots of dark caramel , bitter coffee and dark chocolate, and tea ,a nice level of bitterness in the roast and with the noticable hops . Creamy mouthfeel , full body , long roasty sweet finish with a hint of alcohol in the tail end , very drinkable , i could not put it down and drained the bomber quite quickly . This was very good in every aspect , top notch Stout for sure ."
"D: The beer is smooth and delicious. The 9.5% ABV is masked quite well, makes drinking it a little dangerous since it goes down so easily."
"D - Gets a little too bitter to drink a lot of, but goes down pretty easy."
"I am really looking forward to trying the other permutations on this basic Yeti RIS. I was tempted to give 5's to this bottle, but I want to try the oaked, aged, and coffee versions first. Otherwise, assuming they are better, what would I give them?"
"D- I really liked this one a lot. I think I could def drink a few throughout the night. However, the alcohol is masked so well that it would be easy to forget the 9 plus ABV."
"Bomber courtesy daknole, thanks dude. According to the label this was bottled exactly 13 months ago. Appears black in the glass but you can clearly see through to its brownness while it's pouring. Nice thick creamy head, pretty dark too. Like hot cocoa-colored almost. Frothy lacing all over the place. Aroma is chocolatey but also very bready, which I wasn't expecting really. Like smelling a loaf of dark wheat bread. Maybe a teensy little bit of orangey hops. Flavor is less bready with a lot more of the standard coffee/chocolate dynamic going on. I was expecting more hoppiness in the aroma but it comes through in the taste. Hops lend a piney, almost minty character that marries nicely with the chocolate. Finishes dry but a little too astringent. Solid hoppy bitterness on the back of the tongue, the 75 IBUs boasted on the label seems just about right. Chewy full body and very drinkable. Better than the oaked one if you ask me."
"D - for a thick stout of it's sature it's very drinkable I would have scored it higher but the abv is to high for that. It also paired amazingly well with my gfs double chocolate cup cakes :)"
"Rich, dark, black with a cap of stiff brown foam. Good retention & lacing. Smell of dark roasted malts, molasses, tar, dark dried fruit. Taste begins with a molasses and tar like quality, mellowing out to reveal an underlying brown sugar and dried fruit sweetness. Hints of black licorice, chicory, cocoa, italian coffee, earth and pine round out the finish. Full bodied, smooth, but slight grainy and chalky finnish. Very nice tasting beer with a great ingredient profile. A little bolder than a stout, but not as fruity and boozy as other RIS's."
"The bottle went so quickly I haven't had enough time to properly review this. I will buy another in the next couple days, to finish."
"D: A fine offering from Great Divide. The citrus and bitterness seem to dominate after sitting with it for a while--I think I would prefer this aged a bit to mellow out the hops. Nice complexity of mlats and hops, just not exactly in the proportions I prefer."
"This is my second offering from Great Divide, I had the Titan IPA, which was great, and I have a Hercules waiting in the fridge."
"D= 4.0 I could drink this beer for a while. Another great beer from great divide. Nice job"
"D-very good RIS, nice body and good flavor. good balance, could use just a touch more sweetness; but altogether one of the better yearly RIS'"
"D - Pretty easy to drink. I can drink a full bomber of this no problem as alcohol is hidden very well and this is an enjoyable stout!"
"Thick and robust with lots of roasty, bitter chocolate, wood, the alcohol is present but doesn't dominate, and the finish and dry and very bitter from the massive hop character. Classy, right along with the entire Yeti series."
"D: I could put down a few. this a awesome drinking beer and is way better aged a bit, as I had one on draft a few weeks ago, this one is far superior. the balance is perfect."
"D - I would only go for one of these and then move on to something else... or just go with something else from the start."
"I am really impressed how this beer is packed with roasted malt flavor without becoming too sweet. It's very enjoyable & is certainly a sipper. I've yet to try anything from the Yeti family that disappoints. Great Divide sure knows how to make 'em."
"D - Good, but I was hoping for a lot mroe from an Imperial stout. Lacks complexity of smell and flavor. No 5's here sadly."
"I can't believe I've waited so long to try this beer. I love a hoppy RIS and this fits the bill. At it's price, I would venture to call this a bargain beer. All around awesome and I look forward to having it many more times!"
"Poured from a bottle dated July 2007. This beast of a stout has been sitting, waiting for its consumption for 2 and 1 half years. And oh is it ripe! The appearance is spectacular. The bubbles are so tight it looks more like coffee whipped-cream than a typical head. The froth is rebellious in its submittal to gravity, finally giving its way to a highly decorated, multiple ring of lace. When tilted from side to side the cascading effects are that of a marching band; every member hitting its own note to cause a harmony unparalleled. I smell dark caramel chocolate, vanilla, Godiva liquor and raisin plum with hints of dated pear and a touch of tobacco. The taste is nothing short of perfection. It has bourbon and a wood backbone. Lots of vanilla caramel chocolate, also dates with the slightest alcohol finish. The feel is smooth. Not thick or thin but perfect for this beer. The feel is satin on the palate not demanding too much and going down smooth. I have paramount beer in my cellar: Abyss, Life and Limb, Peche Mortel and others. This is the beer I want most right now."
"Overall: On the whole a great tasting beer but the strong and lasting flavors combined with the high ABV keep it from being enjoyable on a regular basis. While slowing sipping my one glass kept me impressed throughout, about half way through I realized I wouldn't care for another glass of this anytime soon... one was good but it'll do for a while."
" This is my first Great Divide beer, and I can tell by the taste and complexity of the mighty Yeti that this brewery has awesome things for my palate."
"D: A great beer for about two pints, but the alcohol and sweetness may get intense after that."
"D - This is one damn fine brew, though no one should be surprised coming from the fine folks at Great Divide... This is my favorite of all the Yeti offerings... Loaded with flavor and an out of this world mouthfeel, this one is an all around winner... There aren't enough superlatives to go around for this one..."
"This is the best American made stout that I've had I think, except for the Snow Plow Milk Stout from Widmer which I don't think they make anymore. The big alcohol flavor that's characteristic of the style is well under control in this beer."
"Value: Man, if you're into Russian Imp Stouts, I guess this one is a good deal. Just too hoppy and salty for me."
"D: surprisingly drinkable. Excellent but would be limited, it is an imp stout."
"Cheers!"
"A: Extremely dense almost cottony head that lingers, the color reminds me of a dark brown espresso froth, the beer is pitch black and with some obvious viscosity, significant lacing - 5.00, S: Strong aroma of dark fruits such as dates and plums/prunes, heavy on the coffee and baker's chocolate, given that the beer is 9.5% ABV it is remarkably well masked, some slight toffee, though the nose is quite noticeable it is not overwhelming - 4.25,T: Flavors of dark molasses, chocolate covered espresso beans, fudge brownies, malty sweetness is very prevalent and nicely balanced with a solid hop bite which provides pine and citrus - 4.75, M: Extremely heavy body and creamy mouth feel - 4.50, D: Wonderfully drinkable and great mix of malts and hops - 4.25"
"Drinkability: To much hop in the aroma and the beginning of the taste for me."
"Overall, a big, brawny beer with a soft side. The experience begins with the pour. It's, in my opinion, perfect. The cocoa aromas are rich in this one and can appease any chocolate lover. The flavor is also good as the roasted malts don't take center stage and the northwest hops are given a chance to come through. The mouthfeel is good and greasy, just like a RIS should be. Great Brew, even after 2 years from bottle date!"
"I need more bottles of this to age. I'm going to get a hold of the coffee and barrel aged versions as well."
"D- Amazing beer in every way, can not wait to crack open a Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti to see how this compares."
"D- It's pretty good with some tang to it, not the best but not bad"
"On the palate, you get that punch of espresso I was expecting, along with tobacco and paper on the finish. There is a definite, measurable bitterness here, which seems to be a combo of both the hops and the roasted malts. This is a wonderfully balanced, interesting brew that for me, should be one of THE Imperial Stouts you try if you are setting out to understand the American style."
"Always willing to give beers another try so maybe I'll change my mind at the end of the bottle. Hoping the other variations of the Yeti are better."
"Drinkable, but I could not handle more than one per setting."
"This is one excellent stout. Has all of the robust characteristics of a rich imperial, with a huge, silky mouthfeel to boot. Flavor is a complex mixture of the following: dark figs, chocolate, sweet coffee, molasses syrup and anise. Alcohol is not nearly as noticeable in the drink as it is in the aroma. Outstanding stuff, a great example of the style."
"An excellent stout. Very well crafted and balanced!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. it has a very nice mouthfeel to it, like I expect in an imperial stout. Drinkability is very good, it's very well balanced and delicious and drinking this one was a pleasure. Looking forward to the Yeti variants."
"the bitter dark chocolate up front w/ a subtle hoppy finish- i can see why this gets such high ratings. its going to be in the low twenties tonight in orlando and im just glad to have this one chillin in my glass."
"One of the best beers I've had."
"I have never met a Yeti I did not like. The granddaddy of em all is no exception. Easy to drink and enjoy. The booziness in the nose and warming qualities do not become overwhelming and obstructive. Wonderful choice any day of the year, although much more appropriate on an ugly cold miserably snowing kinda day."
"Good carbonation - very drinkable - I have seen this many times in bombers but I am very glad the first time I had it , it was off a freshly tapped keg - Definitely will be keeping a few of these around in the future."
"Overall this is certainly an icon for me in the Imperial Stout style. One of the first real craft beers that I enjoyed in college and one that I revisit often, along with its oak-aged brethren. Highly Recommended."
"Pours a pitch black with big dense medium brown head, clinging thick lacing. Smell: dark chocolate, chocolate graham cracker, dark brown sugar, coffee beans, big leafy and citrus hops. Taste: dark chocolate, dark brown sugar, hint of raisin, leafy, piney, citrus rind. Rich feel, near syrupy with a nice dose of carbonation. Really exceptional. Bottled 7/10/09."
"This is definitely a sipper and more than 1 may be gratuitous but this is in keeping with style, and in no way subtracts from a top notch imperial stout."
"D: I could see this being a very drinkable RIS for some people, but not for me. The roastedness is too much for me."
"Incredible beer. I will be sure to add this to my usual rotation."
"In retrospect, this is definitely one of the best, even with the dry finish it seems to work very well. This is the best dry-finish Imperial Stout I think I've ever had."
"Drinkability is moderate as any large ris should be."
"D - Definitely a sipping beer. Definitely would love to have more in the future."
"I dont think Ive ever had a better Imperial Stout, and I doubt I ever will. Very large beer in many mays; big roasted malts, big American hops! Not smooth, hell yeah. Great when fresh, great when aged. Unbelievably easy to drink. Rich and bitter in the finish, yet supprisingly dry (for and Imperial Stout). A true masterpiece. My hat goes off to Great Divide for this phenominal beer."
"D: this is extremely rich and is best enjoyed sipping over a long period of time as it warms. I was happy to see this beer in a 12oz/4pk vs. the bombers I have always seen in the past. This is an incredible imperial stout and among the best."
"Had again, aged 2 years this time, hops faded but still bitter from the chocolate malt. Aroma is incredibly chocolaty, mouthfeel very mellow and smooth like cask, more earthy character this time."
"D= Amazing beer... This beer reminds me of my favorite beer Darkness in many many ways. This baby is everything I want in a beer and lives up to any occasion. No matter weather I'm craving a hop bomb or a malty sipper this beer is both. Solid brew and I'm happy it's so available."
"D- One of the most drinkable Imperial stouts I have had, definetely can have a few pints, but probably wouldn't be able to drive home afterwards. Overall a KILLER beer"
"This is a full bodied beer, very chewy and viscous. The carbonation is appropriate. This is a nicely drinkable beer, in spite of the fact that the alcohol is not well hidden."
"For a nearly 10% abv beer this one is easy to drink, well balanced and loaded with flavor. The thick head and lace patterns gives the beer a pleasing appearance."
"4.5/4/4/4/3.5"
"D: A very nice RIS. One of the better ones out there."
"MF/D: Very smooth, delicious tasting Imperial Stout. After trying and enjoying this one so much, I am headed back to the store to buy one of their cellared editions."
"Overall, this is a great imperial stout. I would highly recommend it to fans of the style. I will say it was one of the more unique imperial stouts that I have had due to the overwhelming taste of cream. It is also the most hoppy imperial stout I have had by far which surprised me due to it being roughly a year old. I can't imagine what it was like when first released. I just purchased a 2009 oak yeti imperial stout which I think I will try to age for about two years so the hops can calm down."
"As far as drinkability, I would say I like this one more than I like most stouts I've tried, though that list is very short. I will buy more of this one, but mostly because I want to drink it with friends and share its uniqueness with them."
"Being so fresh, it really needs a year or two to age. Or an oak barrel - either would help it to mellow out some, and allow the flavors to meld better than what's respresented here - it's a good thing that's an option. Given that addition, I'd give it a full grade higher."
"The RIS category allows a lot of variability with dryness and bitterness. This is on the dryer and more bitter end of the spectrum."
"Excellent brew. While I prefer the Yetis that have been tampered with in some way, they wouldn't be nearly as impressive if this weren't a very good base beer."
"I would say this yeti is still a bit hot; although I don't like aging many beers, with a little bit of time under its belt to mellow out the hops and heat, this one would probably improve. As it, it is still a pretty good beer though."
"A great beer."
"O: Glorious. I know BA is developing a stigma as a haven for hopheads and big stout drinkers, but with beer like this who can blame us?"
"Overall- This is hot chocolate with a touch of alc. Very tasty very sweet. This is so good! 1 of the best RIS I've tasted."
"D - A good imperial stout that has an interesting hoppiness to it. Splitting the bomber was a good idea. A bit much of this beer isn't so good for me."
"Dangerously easy to drink. Well put together RIS. I will be on the look out for more Yeti's in my area."
"D- I'd have another and love it, i'd have another and regret it, i'd have another and forget I'd had another."
"D: The higher ABV and alcohol spiciness make it hard to have more than a couple of these at a time. Still, as far as Imperial stouts go, this is as drinkable as they come."
"This is the second bottle I 've had in a week. Both times I was turned off by the after taste. All other aspects of the beer are great."
"This is such an easy to drink Imperial stout. I would not have a problem knocking back several of these in short order. Of course, I'd pay for it, but it might just be worth it. Delicious, wonderful stout."
"Vintage - This bottle rolled off the lines in January of 2009."
"D - a great stout...not flashy like its oak aged brothers, just something to sip on again and again. very pleasant all around and every sip begs for more."
"The Yeti is an amazing beer. Whether it's aged w/ oak chips, chocolate, espresso, in whiskey barrels or on it's own, you can't beat it. Fantastic beer. Highly recommended."
"22oz bomber pours a dark black with two fingers of caramal brown foam that disappears quickly. Smell is of roasted dark malts as most typical RIS do. This tastes a little too watery to me, with the burnt coffee taste as well. Its ok, but I was expecting something more from this. Its easy to drink, and you don't notice the abv%. However, was expecting something bigger and better from this Yeti. Not a bad beer though. That being said, I don't think I will pick this one up again."
"I poured this monster beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as tar, no light filtering through the dark thick slather. The head did not last very long. However the lacing was very tenacious. The taste was big coffee with a nutty/slightly chocolate hit afterward. I would buy again."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It goes down pretty easy but I don't think I'd have more than one bottle at a time. Its fairly rich and I think it be better in moderation. Overall a tasty brew."
"Okay, so the 9.50%abv will definitely do you in, over time. I could still down three or four of these before it incapacitates me though, and I consider that to be a good thing. Throw the creamy body and smooth taste into the mix and this is one damn fine brew."
"The mouthfeel is thick and a bit rough around the edges, which I don't mind. Drinkability is pretty good since I much prefer a thicker RIS. I find thinner versions are actually more difficult to drink in any quantity. All around a very good beer."
"Overall the beer is ok. I would drink it again but I wouldn't actively search it out or pick over any number of RIS I've had."
"Wow, the flavor really jumps out at you and has good layers. The alcohol is up front and maybe a touch too strong at first, overpowering the other flavors a little. Once that settles down I get the expected sweetness, with chocolate and a bit if coffee. Mouthfeel is pleasing, not too thick nor thin. Drinkability suffers a bit from the strong alcohol taste (and content). Overall very nice though."
"Summary: Second thickest beer I have had. Very good taste, very thick, but would have been rated higher if it had hid the alcohol a little better."
"Overall, an awesome Imperial Stout and a great beer."
"wow i love this big hairy imp. it's delicious, and i dont even mind the alcohol presence. i only wish i'd aged this baby a bit more than i did to reduce some of the astringency. would and will drink again. this time though, i'm buying a case and aging a few."
"The texture was a nice, thick, oily creaminess and it poured with a hefty head. My brother said it looked like used motor oil. Pretty much hit that nail on the head. So to speak."
"Drinkability: I had 2 from the 4 pack in about 2 hours. Smooth and easy to drink, i found this beer sessionable, but not overly so. But also don't get a 4 pack of these on a full stomach, you'll regret it later."
"I'd probably prefer a fresher bottle of this specific imperial stout but what I had was pretty good. Based on this bottle I don't get the numerous reviews of 'A' or higher. It doesn't do anything exceptional. Its a solid impy stout for the price."
"I wish I had a steak to go with this. The bottle suggests it, and I agree with this bottle."
" Badass beer , must try"
"D - This is an excellent RIS. It is very in-your-face with flavor and walks the line of being overpowering. However, it is balanced with its malt profiles and has some decent hop characteristics to it."
"Notes: This is a great Russian Imperial perfect for the coldest of days or nights. Cheers."
"Drinkability- good, very drinkable and enjoyable"
"Yet, is a big dark beer full of mystery but there is no mystic of hype here. This is just a big high quality Russian Imperial Stout quite possibly the equal to my current favorite, Bell's Expediton. Despite the high ABV this beer is very drinkable but is best enjoyed one delicious slurp of mouthbursting flavor at a time."
"(D)- At first I was concerned buying this with 10 months of age on it, but I was quickly relieved once I took my first sip. A superb stout that has aged superbly. Really smooth with all of the right nuances and flavors. I am curious how it would have continued to age even further. . . ."
"Mouthfeel is very silky and creamy, especially when let sit and warmed for a bit. Just enough carbonation but not to a bubbly champagne feel. Highly drinkable and tasty -Â suitable to nurse and sip especially in this coming cold weather."
"Drinkability is good, tempered by the big and thick mouthfeel and the alcohol content. Something that you'll sip and enjoy over the course of a couple of hours or more. It's something I'd definitely try again, so I can only imagine what the Oak Aged variety of this will taste like."
"Drinkability: This is a nice complex RIS that has had most of the hop bitterness fade away leaving the dark roasted malt character to dominate the flavor. Its intense flavor is powerful enough that I'd not want more than one a night. But I'll be happy to have this one again someday. However the almost burnt character of the malt ensures it will be a while before I do."
"Was not disapointed with my first Great Divide, and I can't wait to get my hands on the other varietals. A very well done RIS that I will be visiting again soon."
"Drinkability:Very drinkable. Creamy and smooth. Far too easy to drink for the ABV, this thing would sneak up in no time,"
"D: Given the ABV, not a sessionable brew, but a well done beer worthy of sitting down to one or two."
"Overall, a very, very good beer and well worth the price, luckily I can get singles. Probably more of an American Stout due to the amount of hops present. I'll be sure to grab this one again!"
"Black pour with a dense tan head that lasts and lasts. Rich coffee, chocolate, and molasses aroma with a pronounced citrus hop note. Big roasted malts up front, strong flavor of brown sugar and a pronounced roasted hop finish. Thick full creamy mouthfeel. This just might be one of my new favorites. Good stuff!"
"taste is creamy and thick, bitter, chocolate, sour malt, some coffee, nuts, a touch of vanilla, and some licorice, end is slightly bitter and thick."
"I've liked many stouts, and this is one I would definitely revisit."
"MF&D - a good heavy body with medium intense carbonation. the body feels pretty good, but the drinkability will suffer along with the taste"
"Notes: Will certainly purchase this beer again and I suggest that anyone who loves stouts to try it as well."
"Wow a very nice example of the style that lives up to the hype. Definitely worth what I paid for it nearly 2 years ago. Perfect for this cold fall night."
"Thick and viscous on the palate, oily and mouthcoating. A pleasure to drink."
"Overall, a nice BIS. The hop presence grows on me as I drink the beer, but doesn't seem to match the creamy-ness of the beer. Excited to move on and taste the variations."
"D - I'd be afraid to drink a bomber of this by myself - thankfully my wife is helping me tonight. The taste is good, but not complex enough to warrant consuming 22oz. Alcohol is well hidden, and only a slight warming hints to the mounting intoxication. The thick body makes it slow going, but thankfully it goes down smooth and easy."
"D. Very smooth and easy drinking imperial stout. Smoother than other imperials. Delicous."
"I split the bottle with a friend and that was still more than enough for me. This beer is so aggressive you need a nap afterwards."
"Great sample of a dry russian imperial stout."
"D- This is a great brew. Solid flavor and feel with a nice balance. Going to have to try some of the other versions now (espresso, chocolate, and oak aged yeti)."
"A very good Russian Imperial Stout. Pours thick and black with a thick dark brown chocolate milk colored head. The frothy head was very interesting, it was thick and would slide down the glass, but it didn't stick to it. The head itself stuck around for most of the session. The smell was good, not quite as strong as I expected. Smells of sweet and bitter chocolate with roasted/burned malts, and maybe some coffee, but more like a coffee milk smell. Had an excellent taste. Tasted smooth chocolate and some coffee taste followed by some roasted malts. Fairly sweet followed by a slight taste of alcohol at the end, not very strong though. Mouthfeel was very smooth, creamy and sweet. Pretty drinkable for such a thick beer, I'd certainly like to pick up a bottle and let it age for a bit and break it out later."
"D: This was a very fresh sample. A little rough around the edges, but still quite nice. A good candidate for cellaring, and a great example of the style."
"Overall I liked this a tad bit less than the oak aged version but more than the chocolate and espresso versions. Worth a shot."
"D - A rich full bodied imperial stout. Definitely a one-at-a-time kinda drink, the richness is far too intense to drink too many."
"D - Great overall. Would enjoy this quaff again if I get my hands on a bottle."
"D- immediately bombs the stomach after very little."
"Possibly the best RIS I've had. Of the ""Big 3 Common RIS's"" up here (Stormking, Old Rasputin and Yeti) this is easily my favorite. Kudos Great Divide, on another excellent brew."
"Yeti is delicious but still isn't much more drinkable than any other RIS. Regardless this is an absolute beast of a beer and one of, if not, my favorite brews."
"This is a great beer and it's hard not to rate it higher. But the RIS forest is teeming with beasts and I have to put this one below the other Yetis. Still, gotta love that this one is available in 4-packs of 12 ozs."
"pours black with a thin brown lacing, smells of coffee and malt, tastes like the bottle says, it has a strong roast malt flavor that flows into an alcoholic bite. I don't taste the caramel or toffee notes. mouthfeel is good, pretty light on the tongue and it tingles a bit. i could probably have a couple pints of this before i moved on to something else."
"Overall, I really am enjoying this beer. I am trying to sip on it as I only have a 12 oz bottle. Very drinkable at the abv it has. I think this is one of the better big stouts I have had lately."
"D-Depends upon where you are and the time of year. I will wait to go back for this one until the winter or the restaurant starts serving Irish Stew."
"D) A good stout. I'd have another. True to form."
"M&D: full-bodied, superbly soft on the carbonation, and mellow, with all flavours to offer but not OTT on the overall balance. The alc. does catch up, after all, but not in an intrusive manner. As this ale is tasted right after (F), I can't help thinking this is a more potent version of RIS, endowed with a bolder hop profile and more assertive roastiness from the malts. Hops are big and juicy but firmly in the parameter of the malty influence. All in all, this is a fantastic RIS that I'd love to savour just once in several months..."
"Well, I figured I might enjoy this one, given how much I've enjoyed the other iterations, and I was not surprised at all. It's one of the better impy stouts out there and, given it's wide distribution, should be a go-to stout for most folks out there. Big, dark and damn tasty."
"The original Yeti, still delicious even without the added complexities of barrel aging or infusions of chocolate and espresso. Nice to finally try the beast that started them all."
"Drinkability: this is a hard one to score. It might be eminently drinkable as imperial stouts go, but it isn't really a session beer. Actually, *one* of these is a session."
"This beer pours a very dark brown almost black color, with a dark tan head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a thin ring around the edge. Nice hops smell and then a hint of chocolate and sweet. A bitter taste comes next, which combines hops, dark chocolate and of course malt. This is a thick beer and quite tasty. I had it in a 22 oz. bomber and that did me quite well."
"This beer pours a very dark midnight black with a dark almost brown colored thick head. Very great smelling beer, tons of aromas great the nose. Chocolate, caramel, toffee and hops. Tons of retention, this beer looks like motor oil. Very complex flavor, some caramel toffee flavor with a hoppy finish. This beer tastes like a delcious desert treat. Smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable. The alcohol is hard to detect, but at 9.5% it will hit you by the end of the bomber. If you like RIS definitely give this beer a try!"
"D: Fairly drinkable, especially for style. Even so, hard to give this high marks here. 12 oz is more than enough for me in one sitting."
"I enjoyed this beer and have had its Espresso version which is just as good. This is a good Russian Imperial Stout and because I have this available to me on a regular basis I would certainly get this again. I was in the mood for a good solid RIS and decided to pick this up and I was not disappointed."
"This beer is loaded with lots of rich, intense flavors. My only knock against it was that the hops and the booze became a bit much by the drink's end. This is definitely a sipping beer, perfect for savoring on a cold night."
"A pour man's AleSmith Speedway (sorry about the pun, couldn't resist). But that's what it reminded me off. Strong coffee, a lot of hops. Heavy aroma. Dark, dark, thick pour with little head. I was satisfied with Yeti, but I would rather have a Speedway stout."
"Had it from ""distant"" tap, so no pour observations other than the lovely tan head and healthy lacing. Good clean clear black color, medium viscosity from what this amateur dark beer drinker would expect. I thought it was very balanced with a very good flavor profile, burnt malts, etc., creamy mouthfeel, clean finish for a 'meal in itself' brew. I seldom can sample these brews and I enjoyed this very much. Looking forward to sampling all the GD's products at the wellhead."
"So, if a 9.5% RIS can go down as silkily smooth as a sweet milk stout, that means it's a drinkable beer. I'm probably spoiled by all the good stouts coming out of North Carolina, but this isn't one to which I'll repeatedly run. It's good and all but, in salute to true beer snobbery, it's not a very special Russian Imperial Stout."
"taste is creamy and thick, bitter, chocolate, sour malt, some coffee, nuts, a touch of vanilla, and some licorice, end is slightly bitter and thick."
"From the bottle into a pint glass. The bottle says brewed in February 2009 so this one has about half a year on it. Pours pretty thick and pours black with an ok sized dark tan/brown head. The head fairly quickly reduces to almost nothing, leaves little to no lacing down the glass. Smell is pretty good but wasn't incredibly strong or anything. Typical smells were there, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Not much else there or at least I didn't pick much else up, I guess this one might be hoppier than most stouts but it's not overpowering. Taste is similar. Chocolate mainly at first followed by coffee. I though the aftertaste was very coffee like. Really good stuff. Mouthfeel was thick, just as I would want and expect from this style. A pretty high ABV but not noticeable at all, the glass was done pretty quickly and went down so easily. A great beer. I think this one is up there for sure for this style. I've got some more I'm gonna put some age on but in the mean time I'm picking up some more just to drink while I wait."
"The Dude abides"
"Looking forward to seeing what else Great Divide has to offer."
"The hops are what probably give it that drier taste. Very drinkible for an Imperial."
"Very dark and very thick, kind of like used motor oil. So far my favorite imperial stout, had a nice strong flavor in the beginning with a smooth aftertaste. I tried it the first time straight from the bottle and it was OK. Tried the next time pouring into a glass to release the flavor and it was definitely much better."
"D - Despite the full-body and relatively high abv on the Yeti, it is a very drinkable beer. Has a great, complex flavor and is balanced almost perfectly. I love the hop kick they added into this style. Great brew."
"Pours a smooth dense black with a creamy mocha colored head that very slowly dissolves into a good layer around the glass. The aroma is mostly coffee bean with some roasted malts. The flavor is sweet chocolate upfront accompanied by some coffee, toffee, caramel and finishes with a soft slightly dry bitterness. Its a full bodied beer and has a velvet-like creaminess. Very nicely balanced Imperial Stout that isn't too bitter and isn't too sweet. Nice complex palate, delicious beer."
"A great RIS that I will have on a fairly regular basis."
"D: I'm going to go ahead and say that this is a notch below the oak aged version. The components are there, but it needs some time to age for it to all come together."
"D- ABV aside, it is a very drinkable beer. Because of the higher ABV, it would have to be a slow sipper for me to drink more than one."
"Drinkable? Does a Yeti poop in the woods!?"
"On whole, a very good RIS that will probably stay in my rotation. Will seek the Oaked version for comparison. I imagine it's a big one."
"D: very solid rendition all around. A little pricey for a domestic, but this one is worth it."
"I definitely prefer the Oak Aged Yeti to this, but this certainly is no slouch. A solid beer I will pick up again."
"D) Great. Split a bomber of this 9.5% ABV which was a good idea, but I could have had the entire thing by myself, and enjoyed it. Not overly filling."
"Drinkability: I will only be having one due to high abv, but this is very good. I will get this again. This is easily in the top 1/4 of the style that I have had."
"drinkability will only improve with age. but don't get me wrong, I could drink 2 12oz servings fresh! great beer to rely on"
"When I cracked this open and took a whiff, I knew I was in for a treat. The smell is a very bold, almost chocolate coffee smell. It poured opaque with a brown head that dissipated fairly quickly. I was amazed by the complexity of the taste, it started off all malt - tasting almost like very chocolately milk. That taste gave way over time to an absolute onslaught of hops. It had a very smooth, creamy mouthfeel that made for a very pleasurable drinking experience. The taste definitely stayed on the tongue awhile, I put almost half an hour between this and my second beer and still felt like I was washing the Yeti down with the second beer. An excellent choice for anyone who likes stouts."
"Fairly drinkable, but the bitter hops, dark chocolate and cofee flavor is all too much. There needs to be a mellow malt backbone here and there isn't."
"Aroma of this beer is pure delight - thick and oily, strongly of fine coffee with hints of molasses, miso and unsweetened chocolate. It pours a deep, rich, warm, opaque sable with a very thick and fairly persistent tan head. Flavor does not disappoint - it is strongly chocolaty with coffee and malty tones and hints of toffee plus a bit of a hoppy bitter bite. Texture is thick and smooth, and fairly tingly so you know that you're drinking a fine beer. Almost perfection, this one!"
"This is a great stout, smooth and strong and worth trying by anyone who likes the style."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black as motor oil on the pour and has a deep mocha colored head. The nose is a nice mixture of deeply roasted malts - black licorice, milk chocolate and smokey burnt coffee, as well as an assertive west coast citrusy hop pressence. The taste begins with the citrusy, piney hops and transitions into the burnt malty flavors and has a little alcohol bite. The finish is rather smooth and leaves a nice combo of the hops and roasted malt on the palate and just a hint of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is very viscous, chewy and has little carbonation, just like a RIS should be. Drinkability is high for such a big beer with such huge flavor but I wouldn't recommend chugging this one!"
"Pours an interesting black with almost violet head. Earthy with hefty amounts of tobacco hops complementing the roasted character. There are some sweet unfermentables really hitting the palate. Alcohol qualities are minimal. Soy and licorice are evident in the nose, the soy is prevalent in the finish. The feel continues to be smooth and coating. A great beer. I followed the 1.5 year old Yeti with a 1 year old Old Rasputin and there was no comparison -- GD Yeti is substantially more complex and flavorful. I will be picking up some 2010s to put down for a good long while as I bet the sweetness of the unfermentables will calm with time."
"Highly recommended."
"The ABV might hold you back from having too much of this, but you've got to try it."
"Poored from 12 oz bottle in to standard pint glass. Looks good solid black small tan head. Smells like cold been in the fridge for a day coffee with slight vanilla creeping in. Taste is a little more of the same but with more chockolate and spicy hops. Feel is smooth and I mean smooth verry nice. Drinkability suffered slightly do to the wrong style to drink on a warm day, it would be higher if it were cold and snowy that is when this beer would shine I am sure."
"Overall: This is good. The ""bottled on"" date reads Mach 9, 2009...so this is pretty young yet. It was a bottle of this from early in 2008 (which I recently drank) that turned me on to this beer. That one was wonderful, complex, full of vanilla, chocolate, and wood notes...I'm hoping that, with a year on this on, it will do the same."
"Poured a gushing 3-finger brown head that died medium-paced on top of a black body. An interesting smell of grape and other fruits (berries, citric) mixed with some roasted and coffee malts (hints of cocoa, toffee, molasses). Smooth, creamy, full-bodied and slightly bready, this beer passes over the tongue easily with a balance of roasted and coffee malts that have a drying sensation and also residual sticky sweetness from cocoa, caramel and something akin to molasses/maple syrup. The dryness is helped by a good ol' helping of hop bitterness on the backend, although the hops don't really have much of their own taste; they are overpowered. A good sippin' stout to have after a meal."
"Would love to try with some age on it."
"bottled on christmas eve, 2008. Blacker than coal... really, really dark with a caramel colored head that pours thick and sticks around forever. lacing up and down the insides of the glass. in the nose, first thing that hits is the booze. there are some hints of dark fruit and cocoa. some tobacco in there too. taste is booze and hot in the beginning, then comes bitter espresso, then even more bitterness as the hops close out the taste. mouthfeel is damn perfection in the glass. chewey, creamy, viscous. it's thick like motor oil. this beer needs a bit of aging and it would be absolutely amazing."
"overall not as good as the oak and espresso yeti but the only one sold in 12oz bottles"
"D: absolutely a unique beer. As far as Imperial stouts go it charts some new territories with such a huge hop presence. Lest we not forget the burly malt flavors and the snooping amount of alcohol"
"D: i could easily go for a second after finishing the first"
"Drinkability: A very nicely done RIS. I think I may even like it better than the oak-aged version. If it were available in my area, Yeti would be a staple in the fridge. This one didn't knock my socks off, but it was definitely solid. I could drink this anytime."
"Hard to put to many away kinda sits heavy and has a high abv but still a very nice beer."
"D: Such an easy beer to drink, but full of flavor...supremely enjoyable! This may become my new stand-by for a great, high-quality stout when I feel like picking up a bomber at the store."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV, style, and mouthfeel. Delicious beer and one that I would definitely have again. IMO, this definitely competes with Old Rasputin and FBS."
"355ml bottle from Systembolaget. Black. Brown head with lots of lace that sticks like glue to the glass. Aroma is intensely hoppy with some chocolate underneath it. Flavor has lots of hops, grapefruit, licorice. There is some roasted malt down there, but the hops almost completely trample it. The body is thick with low carbonation, and an astringent finish. Overall just really bitter and hoppy, not really going for balance I guess. I can live with that, but it doesn't blow me aw"
"D: A very robust, hearty, and bitter imperial stout with an unusual west coast hopping that actually works really well here. Lives up to its billing and name starting strong, and finishes even stronger. A bomber is enough to fill one up and is like a meal in every bottle, sure to satisfy malt and hop wise making this a sure repeater in the future and great standard to measure up to."
"4.5 D: This is basically the same review as the one for the oaked version. Only difference is the lack of oak flavor, which is to be expected."
"Drinkability... where the hell was the alcohol? Deceptively hidden, to be sure. A great drinking beer. but keep watch of how much you consume."
"Pours thick and opaque black, like opening a can of oil. Smell is full of rich coffee with some vanilla extract and smokey wood. Full-bodied and heavy in the mouth throughout the tasting. Roasted caramel malt flavor is present up front along with flavors of baking chocolate followed by a little smoke and bitter grapefruity hops, leaving a rather dry finish. The high alcohol level is very well hidden. Drinkability is fair, I would be good after probably two. Good stuff."
"Conclusion: This is a great beer, much better (IMHO) than their Oak Aged Yeti (I truly hated that beer)...this is wonderfully balanced, but packs a punch as well."
"D- Very drinkable huge beer. Hardly notice the 9.5 abv. And like I said to begin with, the beer is so good. I highly recommend everyone seeks this out."
"I think I'm used to RIS's having that dark ""motor-oil""-like attribute to them and resembling fermented dark chocolate. That's not the case here. Yes, this has a lot of alcohol and it's bold but a beer with 9.50% ABV isn't bad when there are lots of flavors and a solid backbone to tie them together. Not the best beer I've had but one that certainly lived up to the hype and well worth going out of the way for."
"big heavy body. chewy, meaty mouthfeel, almost sticky. about as drinkable as any big RIS. i enjoyed this one very much and look forward to trying some of the other versions of this. not for the beginer beer drinker, but if stout are your thing, a must have."
"One of my favorites to pick up when visiting Texas. Love all of the citrus hops. Makes me want to go down into the cellar and crack open the oak aged Yeti."
"For an imperial stout, I could drink this all day long...very impressive. I cannot believe how well this beer melds together, it has restored my interest in the style."
"I need to try the Oak Aged Yeti now!"
"D=Good, given the style, sweetness and thickness don't lend to sessionability."
"Delicious beer that goes down much easier than you'd think at that ABV."
"Overall pretty easy to drink, the long finish keeps me from going back for more too quickly but only because the taste on the palate is so pleasant."
"Drinkability is extremely dangerous for a brew of this power. I warn against the amazing drinkability of this luscious stout."
"Black in color with a foamy brown head. There is some prickle but you can't really see it because the beer is so dark. Strong and rich malty nose. The attack and the mouthfeel are both creamy and extremely pleasant. The beer explodes with hoppiness at the finish and in the aftertaste. The creamy texture is incredible and it would give any beer a run for its money for the ""best mouthfeel."" This beer was so good I went back to the store and bought more while I knew it would still be in stock. The hoppiness of this stout is definitely enough to make it stand out amongst its peers, but when you add in that texture and mouthfeel. . . great!"
"Pours out very syrupy, jet black in color. About two fingers of brown sugar colored head top it, excellent lacing and head retention. Smells are of roasted coffee, caramel malts, toffee and even a hint of hops. Pretty well balanced smell and taste. Plenty of roasted flavors right off the bat followed by a bit of toffee-like sweetness finished off with a slight bite of bitterness from the hops. Not much alcohol is detected surprisingly, given that it's 9.5%. The beer goes down very smooth with little carbonation, not quite a chewy mouthfeel like other IS's I've had, but very thick nonetheless. I kept wanting to drink more of this beer but one or two would probably do it for me."
"D - Very easy to drink. While you can take your time to savor it, you feel that afterwards you can have another. It is big on flavor but doesn't feel heavy. Excellent."
"Overall a great beer and one of the many reasons why Great Divide is such a solid brewery."
"Black colored beer with a rich ,thick creamy head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is roasted malts,cocoa,chocolate,sweet cream and alcohol on the back end.One of the best beers I've had in years.A no brainer that I will purchase again.If your a stout fan you're missing something great."
"An excellent beer that I'll look for again. I love the fact that the bitterness clings to the back of your tongue. A very well done beer indeed. Now I see why it made this month's issue of BA."
"This beer never fails to impress me. I love everything about it. It pours jet black, with a beautiful chocolate head. It smells of malty goodness and it tastes exactly like it should. It is very rich in taste and more chocolately than bitter. I think it is one of the best Imperial Stouts I have tasted so far. Just wish they sold it in a six pack, I hate 4 packs."
"It's been over a year since I had a sample of the Oak Aged Yeti at a tasting, and I have been craving it ever since. I was disappointed when I couldn't find it in Dallas, but I ""settled"" for the ""plain"" Yeti. There aint a damn thing wrong with this version, and there is a whole lot that is right. I love that the hops stay the hell out of the way in the flavour dept, preferring to make their presence felt in the aroma and finish, yet still integrating with the roasted malt. A couple hoppy imperial stouts I have tried seem to tone down the roast too much, which makes me think I'm drinking an Imperial Porter moreso than an Imperial Stout, but this mistake has not been repeated in the Yeti. The size and body of this beer are a perfect match, as are the hops and malt; all are quite big, yet not overdone, and perfectly intergrated. This beer is every bit as good as I remember the Oaked version was. Superb!"
"pour me another!"
"Feel and Drinkability: Perfect amount of light and delicate carbonation, just enough to let you know that it is carbonated and enough to partially cleanse the palate letting different/renewed flavors come out in the finish. A drier finish definitely works well with this beer, it compliments the roasted grain bitterness. Body if full and feels heavy on the palate, no mixed feelings here as with the Peg Leg. This is one I'd drink again, and I'll definitely take it over Peg Leg, yet for $13 and change I'd rather drink Old Rasputin, one of my favorite RIS and so right for the price. This is one that I'll enjoy drinking the rest of, however I'm at a debate as whether to finish this one first or finish the 1/2 glass of Peg Leg first. Prolly go with the Peg Leg first then finish with this one...bad news before good is always best. This is a real nice beer definitely check it out."
"Drinkability- Some odd aftertaste and high ABV cut down on the drinkability. Born on date is only two months old so off flavors might be due to relative youngness of this beer. I'm going to cellar the rest of the four pack and revisit."
"Overall an awesome beer that I would trade for to get my hands on some more."
"Drinkability - Suffers slightly compared to the EAO version, but still is fantastically easy for a 9.5% beer. The alcohol being slightly more present is the deciding factor here."
"11-1-09"
"Must have this if you like imperial stouts."
"D-Smooth, big, complex, and enjoyable. Yes, yes, yes this is a good beer. Surprisingly drinkable, despite how big it is."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 750 mL bottle. Head is incredible. Thick, creamy, and dense, looks like that weird foam that foams up when waves pound really hard on a beach. Smells chocolatey, malty, and with that slight bit of green olive smell that I detect in some of these RIS's. Taste is good - espresso, chocolate, malt, and some slight hoppiness. Mouthfeel is deep, rich, and creamy."
"Yeti Imperial Stout is very impressive. I was expecting it to be good, but not quite this good. I really like the strong hoppy character of this beer. It's unusual in beers of this style, but works amazingly well. The only small complaint here is that the news is just a little weak. Aside from that small qualm, Yeti is very impressive. Highly recommended."
"Beer pours black as night with a strong brown head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is roasted coffee and mocha. Taste is roasted coffee, hints of dark fruit, chocolate all blending nicely with a generous portion of northwest hops. Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with a full body that gracefully glides across the palate. Drinkability is near perfect as the abv is well hidden. This is a must try for imperial stout fans as this is an outstanding representation of the style."
"D: Fantastic beer and very easy to drink! Would gladly go looking for this again."
"D- overall, the oak aged is better and can usually be found sitting right next to this one on the shelf. the potency makes more than one a bad decision, and the fact that its better tasting and more enjoyable brother can be found just about every time makes this one a hard sell to ever buy again."
"One of the best Stouts I have ever had Highly recommend"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Purchased at Cambridge Wine and Spirits. Dark in color - almost black - and very opaque with an unusually dark brown head. Taste has tones of chocolate and coffee. I thought the mouthfeel was a bit syrupy, but that was my only complaint. 12 oz. was about the most I could handle, but that's ok - not a session beer (for me, at least)."
"Notes: one of the better imperial stouts ive had. simply awesome. truly is ""imposing"". been passing up the hercules, but im hoping its just as good of a rep for its style."
"D - I won't lie, I prefer the Oak-aged version over this one. This beer is slightly off-balance. I like bitterness in my IPAs/DIPAs, but I prefer some balance in my RIS's. It's a very good beer, but I found myself wishing that the bitterness wasn't so strong in it. The heaviness of it doesn't help either. I'd drink it again, but I can honestly say that I've had better beers of this style."
"Taste: Lots of caramel and buttery toffee in the taste. Bitter and sweet chocolate. Finishes with some roastiness and hops."
"Overall, this is a great Imperial. Nice job."
"Had 1/5/2007"
"D - A delicious beer, but its heavy nature and high ABV would prevent me from having several."
"D: Feels like 9.5% abv but I dig it. Best if you let it warm up a bit."
" A well made brew, flavors are well integrated, aroma betrays little of the complex malt profile, very tasty."
"D - this is one of the best RISs out there. try it, now."
"Poured black with milk chocolate colored head. Self described with rich caramel and toffee notes. I can't help but pick up strong notes of chocolate. Also claiming 75 IBUs. I'm not picking up on that due to the strong malt flavor, except in the finish. Very pleasant surprise. I had no idea what I was getting when I picked this up. Must try for all stout lovers!"
"Pours pitch black with a ton of beautiful red highlights. A thick frothy one inch dark caramel color head (with hints of pink) majestically crowns the beer. Smells of deep roasted malts, dark chocolate, and dark fruits dominate the nose. Heavy, thick lacing covers the inside of the glass like a 1970's shag carpet. First sip is burnt malts, tobacco, and dark chocolate. The bitterness is from start to finish. Mouthfeel is super creamy milkshake like adding to a wonderful experience. World Class."
"Mouthfeel has just a bit of carbonation bite, thick, but not quite as viscous as i would have liked."
"D_A very drinkable stout but not one that grabs me."
"Appearance is a dark rich almost black with a thin head and lace. Smell of big roasted malts, molassas and maybe some light chocolate. Taste of sweet roasted malt, bitter coffee and definate alchohol, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is chewy, slick with a good bite of carbonation as it's going down. A good sipper brew with a good hop bite, a good one to try among Imperial stouts."
"Overall a solid brew, I can't wait for the espresso version to come out."
"D- The creaminess and milk chocolate within yeti is my favorite aspect of the taste, which came out more on tap. At 9.5% this is nowhere near sessionable but I would drink a few if i had enough courage. A very nice RIS from great divide."
"A winner of an Imperial Stout and definitely one of the better easier to find versions of the style out there. This doesn't go quite as deep as some of the tops in the style but is still an extremely solid look for those needing a Stout fix."
"It's certainly got big flavor. Medium coffee profile with just a bit of chocolate. But the two most prevalent aspects are an absolutely huge presence of dark burnt malt, and a prominent bitterness at the end from hops. I prefer my Imp Stouts to be on the sweeter side rather than being more burnt, and this is a little overly hopped for me. It's still very good, but that just makes it more of a sipper for me than something I can quaff endlessly (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Decent mouthfeel, a little less carbonated by the end than it seems. Coffee and roastiness just sits on the palate, tantalizing you. I might actually need to take some water halfway through this alone just to get a fresh cleanse. It does a decent job at hiding the ABV, but it still tastes a little boozey. Overall, not a bad impression of a RIS. It's plenty flavorful, just not quite as accessible as I like, nor as focused on the coffee & chocolate flavors. A very solid sipper, but not among my all time favorites."
"Nice, but didn't do a great deal for me..."
"This is by far the most smooth imperial stout I have ever drank. Hard to find, but worth the effort to acquire."
"Wow! This was a meal for me. I honestly shouldn't have eaten anything before drinking this beer because it filled me up considerably. I should have known it was filling by the pour, which was almost like a melted chocolate. Considering how much this beer tastes like coffee and chocolate (and some toffee) I'm surprised it's not yet available at Starbucks. With all that being said, this is kind of a tossup for me, somewhat of a hophead. I did enjoy the taste, but it became more and more difficult to drink the more I had. Wouldn't get it again, but I wouldn't turn down a free one either."
"Drinkability is very good. I don't see this around too much, but will be sure to pick it up. I look forward to trying the oaked yeti in my cellar next."
"Picked this brew up the other day and thought that I would give it a try last evening. Brew poured to a pitch black color with a thick frothy dark tan head that head great retention and left chinky lacing down the side of the glass, nice looking brew. The aroma really showed of the hops, I was expecting this based on some research but it was a little more than I even expected. The other aromas where roasted to burn malt (charcoal?) , coffee (slight expresso like), and alcohol. The flavor follows the aromas as the big hop flavor really seems to dominate for me. Also in the background the malt comes out that seems astringent and that mixed with the hops seems a little to much for me. Also expresso/coffee favors really show. As it warms the alcohol comes out more and more giving a slightly burning feel. The feel of the brew is good, thick with a slight slick feel, creamy. For me the hopping of this brew is a little to much, I am not a hop head and would love to see what this brew would be like with that hop presence muted a bit. Still a good brew, but (at least for me) not a great one in my book."
"This beer has excellent reviews, so I was shocked to be dissappointed with this beer. It may have been served too cold. I may give it a try out of a bottle sometime."
"Is this drinkable? Clearly. Could I have a few more? Well, I'm not the kind of person to turn down 22oz. of beautiful beer, but my second right might be something a bit mellower."
"Pours deep black with a thick, dense off color head. The aroma is rich and woody. The flavor is smokey and chocolaty, with a rich, round mouthful of sweetish malt and a satisfying bitterness. The alcohol sneaks up on you, with a bite in the back end that is reminiscent of a rich black rum. The mouthfeel is surprisingly fluid for such a thick beer, almost more like a porter than a stout. It clings around the back of the mouth, emphasizing a smokey bitterness. This is a highly drinkable imperial."
"The mouthfeel is great, taste is very smooth and it goes down just smooth. The beer is balanced very nicely and was a great roasty aroma."
"M:"
"Inky jet black, looks like a pint glass of espresso, the one finger head foamy with big bubbles, strong lacing. In the nose the coffee and chocolate actually more restrained than you'd think by looking at it, strong blackberry, plum, raisin cake notes, molasses, the lower malt roast allows more hops to surface and refresh, never unloads on you as you expect. Full-bodied, here you get the full onslaught with Kahlua and cream infused coffee, bitter dark chocolate, molasses, a strong bitter roast and some curry spice keeps it agile on the tongue. Good carbonation but hard to register with a beer of this density. Less fruity here but there are discernible mixed black fruits. The hops more present through a grainy bite and drying texture than primary presence. Releases credibly through the finish, allowing for the palate to relax before the next sip."
"Notes: While the Yeti is not the best RIS I've ever had, it definitely belongs on the top shelf for sure. A great, hoppy, Russian Imperial that will quench any stout lovers' thirst for a big, bold, beer. Highly recommended"
"D: Solid drinkability for the style. One is enough, but puting that one down isn't very difficult. A very tasty RIS."
"Pours a blackish color, tan frothy head, average, somewhat diminishing. Hoppy aroma, some coffee. Alcoholy taste, some coffee. Strong flavor. A milky smooth taste. Coffee. Too much for me, maybe aging will do this on better."
"D: Well, it's 9.5%, so I'm not going to drink a six-pack, but a bomber is about perfect. A highly enjoyable RIS, one of my favorites. I think the few months of age on it really helped it out and it makes me look forward to my bottle of 2006 Oak Aged Yeti I have in the cellar."
" Get some!!!"
"While not my absolute style, a great example of the style. Next time I will buy and age."
"D - Good brew that is in the best class."
"Drinkability: An amazing beer that, while I wish I tried it earlier, i can't wait to sample the 3+ year old one i have in my cellar. I am really finding my likes in the dark,malty beers."
"Full bodied goodness!"
"D - Very smooth and enjoyable stout. The bitterness and levels of flavor make this an easy drinker for me."
"Overall impression: I've had this both fresh and aged - it is good either way, but bordering on great with some age on it. Nice blending of complex flavors, and highly drinkable despite the ABV"
"D - 9.5% plus expensive compared to other great RIS...no. Try the Oak Aged Yeti...much better. That review next."
"It pours out dark and black with a dark tan head. The head is pretty thick, and there's some decent retention, maybe a little lacing. The look is on par. The smell was my favorite part. You get loads of roasted malts first. Then there's a bit of alcohol backed by this molasses sweetness. It really makes me exited to taste the beer. I've ad this twice, once fresh, and one was kept for a few months before consuming. I remember the fresh one being very harsh. The other was decent, but nothing to rave about. There were really two main flavors for me - A bit of fruity alcohol and quite a bit of the roasted barley taste. You could describe both of them in different ways, but that's mainly what you're hitting on. I didn't notice much sweetness, and I don't prefer these to be overly sweet, but naturally it seems that having loads of malt, particularly darker malts, is going to lend plenty of unfermentable sugar. As you drink it, you get a decent amount of carbonation, and there's a bit of harshness that mellows after the first taste. This one, in terms of drinkability is about average for an imperial stout, it was a long, long drink for me, and I would recommend it to someone looking for something new, but I probably won't buy this again (though I may try to oak aged one, I don't know how much different it will be)."
"Drinkability: Wow, this stout is great. I enjoyed it the day before Christmas Eve and I can't wait to go to the store and get a few more. I am actually planning on brewing an imperial stout that will require aging for 9-12 months. I can only hope it is and smooth and delectible. The Yeti connotation implies a brew only enjoyable during the winter. I totally disagree, I would drink this beer year round!!!"
"D= A fairly balanced and subtle RIS with a lot going on in the flavor and aroma department. Good beer that I will definitely drink again."
"This isn't my favorite Imperial stout, but still an excellent beer."
"Inky black with a thick tan head. Smells of alcohol, chocolate, coffee and tastes of the same with some licorice thrown in. Surprisingly heavily hopped for such a heavy stout, but the hops aren't intrusive and acutally add much to the overall enjoyment level. Absolutely love this one."
"Overall this is a very smooth beer, and very drinkable."
"22 with a chocolate interlude is about all I can handle though."
"D: A pretty decent mouthfeel and taste combination that was good for an Imperial Stout. The alcohol was fairly warming, but not overwhelming in the taste of the beer. A nice drinking beer overall."
"Dry roasts come right out to bite the tongue. A very dry and woody taste is apparent in addition to all the aforementioned. Both sweet dark and bitter chocolate. There is a slight bit of heat that takes away from the overall complexity. Not as creamy as I'd like."
"Good to go as the R.I.S.'s get. Flat body, head lil earlier disappeared. Smells of smashed dates, sweet, molasses, brown sugar. Possibly fresher fruits in the aroma, cherry and grape. Body hits at a complex fermented dark fruit orgy, chocolate then raspberry. Booze is gone behind a flavorful, roasty, chocolate curtain. Lil grainy after several sips, and a hard hitter. I dig but can't get in a habit, they'd be my ruin."
"The blackest sea this side of Ol' Rasputin fills my glass and I love the cinnamon head that that rests on top. An aroma that permeates through the room, one of wood, charcoal, coffee, and chocolate. Wow, that is one of the richest beers I have ever had, creamy Godiva chocolate on top of malty coffee and whip cream. An unbelievable smoothness stands out among the heavy body of Willy Wonka goodness. This is a chocolate milkshake of a brew but could be enjoyed any time of day accompanying a croissant breakfast or as an after dinner dessert. This brew is one of the heartiest and I'm begging for the winter to come get me."
"Overall a good beer and I'm quite fond of it."
"Mouthfeel is very thick, and drinkability is good. This is one tasty beer."
"Too much booziness in this one really keeps the flavor profile and dirnkability down. Tastes better as it warms."
"Solid black pour with large dark tan head. Heavy roast, coffee, mocha, port aromas. Tastes similarly with power in each flavor, alcohol is lingering the whole time. Full bodied to say the least. I was a little surprised by the hop bitterness later on. In your face with the espresso and bitter staying with you a while. Barrel does mellow it out, but it has it's drawbacks also, so I like them about equally. Both are definetely agers."
"D- Drinkability really suffers on this because of the alcohol heat in the nose,taste, and mouthfeel."
"This beer is monstrous. Don't doubt its potency... it's in the top few RIS's I've ever had. I'd rather drink this than Darkness."
"D - Goes down smooth, but strong."
"I was starting to despair about not finding Stouts that I truly enjoyed but, I have broken my cold spell - this is my new go-to IRS."
"Imperial Stouts are quickly becoming one of my favorite brews, especially as the temperatures drop. Yeti pours a midnight black liquid with a thin splotchy head that quickly vacates. Insane lacing. Gobs of it. Smell is a little light; but bitter chocolate, black coffee and some dark sweet fruits come through. Taste is huge and complex. A sharp alcoholic hop blast hits right away when the beer is still a bit chilled. As it warms this is balanced by a huge sweet malt bill that comes off with notes of cherry vanilla, sweet chocolate, and some harsh smokey tones. Mouthfeel is intense and satisfying. This beer will knock your socks off, but remains a highly drinkable, very enjoyable stout."
"One of the thickest beers I've ever come across. Pours is midnight black, viscous, with no head. Roasted malts, chocolate, and toffee dominate the nose. Very thick mouthfeel with the same flavors. Light smokiness and caramel come through with it. The end is a nice bitter hop, which is different end for such a heavy beer. Don't plan on having a heavy meal within 24 hours of this one."
"Once this entered my mouth the whole thing just set off an explosion of the taste buds and the alcohol sent it straight to my nose. So much malt in here, but the hops just balance it so well. There's a monstrous amount of both! Bitter chocolate and herbal licorice off the top, then astringent citric hops, coffee beans, vanilla, light brown sugar/molasses. Mouthfeel is so massive, near syrupy but I wouldn't expect anything less from a monster like this. Medium-low carbonation. I will not have a problem finishing this bomber by myself, and I'll be looking for more next time I hit the States."
"This is a beer lover's beer. This is not for the meek. If you are a true stout enthusiast, you will love this one. When I first poured this into my glass, I wanted to take a picture it was so beautiful. Jet black with a wonderful, rich, mocha-colored head. You know a stout is going to be good when the head is so thick and creamy is looks like it could fit on top of a meringue pie! Sticking my nose into the glass I got a rich dose of hops plus a dark, roasty, raisiny aroma from the malts. This is a beer that bulges out of its seams on both ends. Not only does it have all the richness you would expect from such a heavy roast on the malts, but it also delivers a HUGE hop wallop. Nothing faint here. This one gives it to ya straight up. Body is huge! - as full as full gets. Flavor is packed with tons of dark-roasted malt, with dried black fruit, bittersweet chocolate, anise, tobacco, and burnt sugar. The noble dose of hops balances out the big malt attack, leaving you completely and utterly satiated. If this beer doesn't satisfy even the biggest of beer cravings, I don't know what would. An awesome product of craftmanship. I've had some other beers from this brewery that I remember liking quite a lot but haven't had in some time. After drinking this one tonight, I'm going to revisit this brewery. What a beer!! Two thumbs up!"
"Reviewed on 4/19/08. Bottle (probably was sitting around for awhile). Pours dark black with a beautiful thick light brown head. Aroma of chocolate, hops. I loved the hop profile of this beer! Flavor of hops, roasted malt. Mouthfeel was a little less rich and dense compared to the Oaked Yeti. Yum! 8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Had this beer on tap as part of a Beer fest at Union Jack' @ the Matawney Inn. The pour was a deep black almost molasses like with a one finger dark tan head. The smells were very strong of bitter chocolate and sweet like brown sugar, it smelled delicious. The taste was just as good as it smells with hints of coffee and oak/smokey flavors as well as chocolate. The drinkability was down just a bit since it is high in alcohol. It is more like a sipping beer. This Beer is a must try !"
"Pours adark black with a nthick coffee colored head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and sugar. Tastes of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee and smoe dark berries. Has a very smooth taste in which the high alcohol content is nicely masked."
"Darkest black with a milky, frothy tan top. Excellent retention. Smells of dark, roasted chocolate. Milky chocolate taste with some expresso. Roasted malts. A slight bitter bite in the finish. Thick and chewy with some slightly acidic tones - not sure if it's the alcohol or what. Aftertaste of coffee and roasted malts."
"Drinkability: for a heavy beer they are easy to drink but only can have a couple but great on a cold day"
"A good RIS - I'd put it in the same vein with the Rogue Imperial Stout. Love to have it, but not my favorite in the style."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth with a full body, not too heavy either."
"Future outlook: Might get again to sock away for a long time...."
"A very high quality product, another winner from Great Divide, and not as expensive as many RISs. A sipper, not a quaffer. Highly recommended."
"WOW!! just poured some of this 22oz into a wine glass, swished it around to take in the aroma, although I didn't need to because I could smell it from two feet away. It poured a thick khaki head that went to the way side with light lacing fairly quickly. The nose is a dark chocolate, coffee, and hop wallup! The taste is very well balanced with everything I smelled and a bit of raspberry. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and exceptionally drinkable. I put this stout on the short list of the greats, including Dark Lord and Bourbon County. This really kicks you in the ass! This weekend I am having some friends over for Yeti, Oak Aged Yeti, and Southern Tier Choklat. I may look for a couple more stouts as well to rate. KILLER!"
"Drinkability: Never again. Over-hopped and over-hyped. No balance."
"For some reason this was widely available in the Netherlands for a very short while but I managed to get my hands on quite a lot. It's an impressive Imperial Stout for sure. Very well balanced, stable and rubust. It has all you could probably imagine it should have. However there's one thing that's just not perfect. I think it's a bit one demensional. Loads of roasted coffee and chocolate but it lacks some complexity and subtile flavors like licorice, blackcurrant or even honey. But as said, wonderful beer."
"this brew pours up an absent of all colors black with a nice dark brown head. nice lacing as well. the nose is sweet and roasted malts, subtle earth, subtle marshmallow, hints of sweet vanilla. very rich taste. I get sweet malts, coffee, yeast, a lot of roasted malts, nice hop bitterness, a little vanilla bean in the finish, full bodied, high carbo. A very nice beer..."
"This is a sipper, but man could I enjoy a couple in one sitting. It's just so good, you crave another."
"All in all, I have to rate this as my favourite beer - for home drinking at least. For an evening in the pub I might prefer Timmy Taylor's Landlord but for quiet appreciation, this is the one."
"D: Very good. I really enjoyed sitting in the tap room watching the brewers at work while sipping this gem."
"D: fair. This one bomber is enough for me. I enjoy it but there are some better examples out there."
"Yeti, Yeti, Yeti....this is definitely one hairy giant of a stout! Think this is from '04 can't be sure though. Aroma is silky smooth lots of mellow chocolate, raisins, plums, and tons of roasted malt with a touch of hops. Black pour with an ample head and some lacing what a great surprise for an imperial, for that I give it the tops. Mouthfeel is well blended and exceptionally smooth, just the right burn from the abv to round out another top score. Awesome flavor, I believe that this has been sitting for at least a couple of years. Incredibly mellow and well blended. Heavy thick malts with a complimenting sweetness matched by a trace of bittering hops. Great stout, great label, and well priced This is a must try."
"Notes: I usually dislike the aggressively hoppy stouts and porters but this beer shows me that it _is_ possible to brew a hoppy stout that I like. Exceptional stuff. This makes me even more intrigued to try Darkness. Time to ISO?"
"D: Very smooth, keeps my attention and wanting more because each sip is something new."
"Pours a very dark brown in color, we'll just call it black. A very nice inch of brown head forms on the pour. Smell is heavily roasted malts and some nice coffee. I was expecting a ton of hops in the nose, but thankfully they're not there. More of the hops show up in the taste, but still, for the better, not as much as was aniticipated. This is much better than I remember it being. I think with some age this would be a very good beer. Comparable to, dare I say it, Bells Expedition. Full on the mouthfeel and nice."
"This won't make me forget Abyss anytime soon, but still a very tasty Impy stout, and I'm happy to toast EWU for a great halftime turnaround against Montana State. I'll be drinking this again."
"D: I was very partial to this beer because of the hops. This couples nicely with game 7 of the ALCS which is being played over the radio. I plan on picking up quite a few bombers for both drinking and aging."
"Very complicated beer that is a sipping delight."
"Drinkability is pretty good, even for what I assume is a pretty young beer, just judging by the big hop presence - I just grabbed from my local store's cooler this afternoon. Lots of flavors, they could use rounding out for sure, but it is nice to taste them so overtly. Nevertheless, it's a long commitment to finish the bomber unless your forcing yourself."
"D: Whatever the mouthfeel lacks, the complexity and sheer tastiness of the beer more than makes up for the slight disappointment in the mouthfeel. A beer deserving of its accolades."
"Drinkability: A damn good RIS with a lot of very good complex notes, a reasonable abv% (9.5% is up there, but by no means near the ceiling for the style), and a very nice balance with everything - sweet and dry malt notes, alcohol, hop bitterness and notes, etc. Stylistically, this is one of the most ""drinkable"" RISs I've ever had the pleasure of. It's definitely one to try, and another great brew from Great Divide. I don't have access to any of their products here in VA, but they're available in pretty much every surrounding state (damndest thing), so I never really got around to trying all of them until recently - I've been missing out!"
"Tonight was an Imperial Stout night, so I decided I would visit one that I do not partake in often, Yeti Stout from Great Divide. I poured this one in to a Rapscallion snifter glass. Color was motor oil black, with a large dark tanned head show. Bitter chocolate, caramel, earth, faint mint, and booze come through in the nose. Dark and milk chocolate meet quite nicely in the flavor, with a breath of hops, and acrid bitter finish. Very robust in body, one to sip for sure. For some reason this one has always given me a very heavy buzz that other Imperial Stouts have not. That being said, this is one to be wary of as far as strength. On the flip side, this is one of the best stouts out there IMO. A true beast of a beer that I should go for more than I do. Beautiful drinking here, Cheers"
"D - high abv is the only thing holding this one back from being rated higher."
" Overall this is a very drinkable imperial stout. I would say it tops my list of overall favorite dark beers. Would highly recommend to anyone with a flair for dark beer."
"Notes: I am not a fan of stouts but this is an excellent one. I have had 5 to 10 stouts but this is my favorite."
"Delicious beer. I could easily make this my house RIS if it was more readily availablee. Delicious."
"The head on this beer is awsome as is the thick clumps of lace. IMHO its the beers greatest attribute. But the beer is damn fine as well. This is not ment as a stab, but just a highlight of how great the retention, head and lace are."
"first, let me just suggest that if you have the opportunity to try this beer and it's oak-aged counterpart, try this one first. It's definitely not bad at all, but the oak-aged is better. Much smoother with greater drinkability. But back to this one here. A lot about it seemed like just a bit above avg imperial stout affair. Pours a super dark ebony with dark head. Smells and tastes very, very roasted. Lots of roasted malt and some dark chocolate, but with a nice presence of hops as well that is particularly detecable in the back of themouth and aftertaste. Again in reference to the oak aged, this ones drinkability ranks a little lower as it seems a lot thicker and more syrupy with real weight and gravity to it. It makes the prospect of having another beer after it questionable. But I'm sure a lot of people would see that as a reason to rank it higher. So have this one and enjoy it, but certainly make your way to the oak-aged to experience its superiority."
"I opened both this and the oak-aged version together. As good as this one is, the oak is clearly better. If I needed an everyday RIS, it would be between this and Ten Fidy. For something a bit more special, the oak aged yeti is the one."
"ours a soupy blac with leather brown highlights. There was a quick brownie brown head. Can't see any bubbles and there is no lacing. Marshmellowed brownies made wth dark chocolate, thanks to this beers hopping. With a slight creamy booze warmth that you can feel in the nostrils throughout. Bitter roasted chocolate malts and hops mix to give the taste buds the gift of marshmellowy, vanilla-ey, brownies. The finish is a bitter cream and heavily milked coffee. Liquid dessert in a 22 oz. bottle. Great to slowly sip on a cool night before you retire for the evening."
"This beer pours very dark/opaque with a beautiful 2 fingered head, with very nice lacing. The smell is of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lovely malts. The taste... as my wife put it is very complex. You get some vanilla, lots of chocolate and some coffee, a great selection of malts in this beer! The mouthfeel is nice, the carbonation level is good. I could see myself drinking one or two of these bombers pretty easily but I would go on stout overload after that."
"D: Solid."
"Overall: good stout, should trade places with Old Rasputin on the BA Top 100"
"Pours a deep dark black, with a cocoa brown head that settles fairly slowly leaving some light lacing. Aroma is amazing! Notes of oak, coffee, vanilla, chocolate. Flavor is extremely well balance for such a big stout. Just enough of a chocolate flavor , but not so much as to be a ""chocolate stout", a bit of rosted coffee flavor as well. Flavors hide the 9.5% abv very well, as it is nowhere to be found. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Not harsh at all. I am very impressed with this RIS. I would definitely advise you to seek this one out."
"Overall: A hybrid between the ""Old Rasputin"" and ""Storm King Stout"". I enjoyed this beer a lot, but I would give the edge to Old Rasputin. I would definitely buy this again; you won't be disappointed. Worthy of the top 100 of BA."
"Well I really enjoyed this beer. Super dark and you can taste the coffee and chocolate.. I was very surprised to find out this was made here in America. Its no doubt the best stout here in the USA we have. Enjoy it with friends as its strong and tasty."
"Overall I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It's also a good thing that it's cheaper than a bottle of Stone RIS, but just about as good."
"Overall, a very, very good brew. Very drinkable. It hides the alcohol well. Great sipping beer at day's end."
"Not quite as much going on as with the oak-aged version, from what I can recall, but damn this is good. And getting better as it warms."
"Drinkability: A sipping brew for sure, and so far of the two RIS I've had, the Old Rasputin was better."
"Their is a light creaminess to it with low carbonation. The alcohol is not well hidden in this one and lowers its drinkability."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is very, very thick and the alcohol is definitely there. I may try aging one to calm it down some!"
"Overall, a respectable RIS but I've had a good number of others I liked better."
"Drinkability takes a slight hit, but only because it demands so much respect. This is strictly post-meal, preferably one involving hunks of pork ripped off the carcass like you think you're Henry the 8th or something. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing though, so the overall is a plus to me."
"Flavor is bliss at first sip. The alcohol, as noted by other BA users is very dominant, but spikes the beer thoughout drinking. The mouthfeel is thick, yet light. Flavor is bitter chocolates, loads of maltiness, coffee, rum, caramelized toffee, yet balance by spicy hops and alcohol. The finish is warm, but very smooth. This was suprisingl good, I highly reccommend and will purchase again"
"this is a great beer, of of the best i have ever had, much better than the oa version."
"Over hopped and to much alcohol for me. I am no expert on Imperial Stouts, but if this typical, then they obviously aren't my cup of tea."
"This is a great beer."
"Tasted on 6/5/08."
"D- This is always damn tasty. There are better stouts out there, but this is really impressive."
"This is a quality beer. I can't say that it necessarily distinguishes itself from many of the other quality RISs out there. Pretty nice, but if were up to me, I'd cut back on the hops a bit."
"It is smooth as anything, but the bitterness lingers, and it's not all too great when trying to get through such a heavy and full bodied brew. I couldn't have more then one of these, and I reckon there are better stouts out there that balance flavour with drinkability."
"$4.99/22oz'er. Pours like year old motor oil; thick,black and viscous. Dark brown tight head prevails. Moderate aromas of dark chocolate, espresso and roasted malt emmanate from the snifter. Mouthfeel replicates the visual on the pour, thick and oily. Overwhelming blast of bitter-sweet black malts, coffee, and chocolate assault the palate, immediately sliding into a crisp, dry hoppy bitterness which very successfully balances this delicious brew out quite nicely. Admirably well done!!"
"A great stout!"
"D - Not to me, the taste made me keep wishing the glass was already empty."
"Big bodied, thick and creamy in the mouth. Enjoyable even on a hot summer day for sure."
"While I wouldn't buy this again, I will try to cellar this and age it at least a year and try the oak aged version..."
"Drinkability: If you couldn't tell from my description of its taste, this is a formidable beer. I for one wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting, but that's only because my taste buds would need some sort of break after being punished (in a good way) by one of these. Yet, if someone was already handing me another one...."
"Damn! This is the third Imperial Stout I've had in a week, and it's the first to hit the spot. Such a beautiful combination of malt, hops, water and yeast. A superb ale."
"D: Sip away... the flavour almost builds up as it goes, and holds on for longer and longer on the palate. The finish is a particularly intriguing part of this drink, and allows for several minutes to ponder over the lasting flavour in the mouth."
"D: With so many other RIS choices, I wouldn't spend the $$ on this again."
"A+ for uniqueness...this isn't like any other Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had...I don't even remember the Oak Aged Yeti offering such boisterous hops. But uniqueness isn't everything, and while I very much enjoyed this, I was kind of wanting a textbook-definition big-ass ultra-creamy rich-as-hell stout. This bottle was relatively young (bottled Jan. '08, drank 6 months later). Cellaring would probably bring down the bitterness to a more RIS-like level, but that's probably not the idea here. It's certainly more than good enough, no room for any real complaint. Take it for what it is."
"D: I liked this beer as it had alot of flavor for only 6.5% alcohol. Really drinkable. Excellent beer."
"Served from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass."
"Overall - A world class Impy Stout... one of the best (if not the best) examples i've ever had... highly recommended..."
"A beautifull looking stout. It is a rich black color with a creamy espresso head that settles to silky cover. Nice lacing down the glass. The nose has a roasted malt structure with molasses, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and nice bitter hops. The taste is rich and roasty with a good balance of piney hops. Again hints of coffee, molasses, coffee and ripe plums. The body is full and silky with perfecly quiet carbonation. Could a few years to mellow out."
" smooth very black carbonated concoction with chocolate and licorice lingering on the tongue. gets better as it warms. nice thick mouth feel and drinkabilty is high, forgive the pun. nice stuff."
"overall-a great representation of an imperial stout"
"D: A complex set of flavors, mixes well, but not something I could drink a lot of in one sitting."
"D: Great RIS, but it is a RIS. It is meant to be savored and sipped, but I could savor and sip one of these every night if my wallet allowed for it. Very tasty."
"Poured an amazing pitch black color and formed a nice huge foamy dark head that stuck around and left me thinking of some decedant float experiment gone wrong. It finally decided to diminish, leaving a lactice of lace etched on the side of the glass. The aroma was malt, coffee, chocolate and a touch of raisin. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate with a body a touch light for this style. Great finish and the oak aged was even better."
"Definitely a slow sipper. I'd recommend splitting with a friend or two."
"Black in color with a brown head that left a thin layer. Aromas were sweet with scents of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. On the other hand, in the mouth it showed hoppy bitterness throughout along with sweet roasted malt in the backgroud. It had solid weight but it did not come off as heavy. There was a touch of alcohol noticable on the finish but it was not obtrusive."
"Superb and absolutely drinkable. So many flavors reveal themselves as the brew's temperature changes... experiment with service temps for some very interesting results!"
"D: This is a drinkable beer, especially if you like the style. This is a great example of an imperial stout, but like its brethren, it's very heavy. Not exactly a beer you can drink a lot of, but still a great brew."
"The dry bitter hop aftertaste is its strong point. This imperial stout may make for a decent capper to reawaken the nasal passages. However, I don't see myself indulging in another right away."
"Really good. Unique."
"i tried this 1 (bot. date 3/07) side-by-side w/ my staple RIS, Storm King ; pours like used motor oil, viscous black w/ a non-existent brown head leaving a cap of iridescent bubbles and little lacing in my nonic ; a piney citrus hop and dark roast malt and a coffee-like aroma w/ dark fruits and vanilla note, a hint of wood and hot alcohol present as well ; a sweet, robust burgundian malt flavor blends w/ a ""twangy"" grapefruit hop initially followed by choc. and dark fruit, a woody, brandy-like flavor, coffee, caramel, nuts, clove(?), finishes making you wonder what's in the next sip ; a full bodied, low carbonated number, rich w/o being cloying ; drinks exceptionally well for a 9.5% ABV, on the downside, i'd prob. drive my truck thru a conv. store wall before i figure all the nuances of this one out..."
"as a side note, i tried this beer side by side with the oak aged yeti and thought the original was the tastier of the two!"
"Pours pitch black with a thick dark tan head, sticky lace, and lingering iridescent bubbles. The smell is chocolate, coffee, sugar, cherries, and bananas. None of the harsh roast you might expect from such a dark, dark beast. The taste is sweet, but with a biting edge that balances it nicely. The aftertaste is slightly bitter for my taste, but then again this isn't my favorite style, so to come that close to delicious in my jaded opinion is a real testament. The mouthfeel is soft, almost chewy, but very, very smooth. The drinkability is good, but just a bit too bitter to sit & drink it all night. That being said....the rest of the bottle's not going to waste!"
"D - Good brew that is in the middle of the pack in my opinion but is a good example of the style."
"I poured this one hard, probably too hard because I got about a 3 inch head on it. Beer is black as night. Head is dark brown and sturdy. This is one solid looking brew. Aromas I am picking up: spices (not sure which), sweet, dark fruit, alcohol, pine. I am loving smelling this. Little bit of chocolate flavor, strong alcohol, but in a good way, wow. Sweet alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel, with a bit of zing at the end. Good warming. Strong and flavorful. Great beer. Definitely suggested, just watch yourself, it's a doozy."
"Fantastic in every sense of the word."
"Side note: I had the Oak Aged Yeti and it, too, was equally fantastic. As expected, it was a little softer and smoother, with nice hints of oak and vanilla. I actually liked the regular Yeti more simply for it's assertiveness and personality though."
"Drinkability: This beer was filling and warming. The Imperial and thick alcohol personality nature of this twenty-two ouncer hit me well and left me pleasant. Two of these bottles would definitely disqualify one from complex tasks, but leave a person entirely content with the experience that has just transpired."
"This poured with slightly darker and thinner head than the Old Rasputin. It had the scent of malt and coffee, and a bit of alcohol, but not too much chocolate. The flavor matched the scent with malt and coffee up front, followed by a hops and alcohol finish. It had a heavy and smooth texture, again as expected. I would describe this overall as a powerful beer, good for sipping but not outstanding."
"I enjoyed this beer very much"
"Great beer from the Divide."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and complex, something to savor and ponder slowly."
"A brutally dark and intense stout. Flavors of coffee and bittersweet chocolate entice the back of your tongue whilst the bitterness of hops sweep across your pallet and stick to your taste buds. I felt that the hops dominated the flavor profile a wee much."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled January 2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours very dark brown/black with an inch and a half frothy brown head. Head retention and lacing is excellent. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and dark/bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's licorice noticable and also a lot of citrusy and pine hops in the finish. The hoppiness overpowers the roasted malt character of the beer somewhat. It's still good, but I prefer more malt than hops in my stouts. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's viscous, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is good too, it is pretty easy to drink. I think it's a good stout, but I prefer the oak aged version. I'll age a couple bottles of this and see if it improves with time."
"D: I think its better than the Oak Aged version."
"D: This has got to be one of the easiest drinking RIS's out there! Dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and hops blended together so expertly, totally complimenting each other. And it's a year-rounder! There should be one of these in your beer fridge at all times."
"D-Very drinkable imperial stout that has amazing aroma and a balanced flavor."
"Served a deep opaque black with a creamy tan head that was slow to diminish and left great lacing. The aroma was roasted malts and coffee with some cocoa. The taste was espresso and roasted malts, great complexity. The beer is medium bodied and smooth with warming alcohol. This one was very enjoyable."
"One of my all time favorites. This beer is as nuanced as almost any you will find; but that doesnt stop it from kicking you in the teeth with flavor. Booya."
"A nice big beer. This one is great for drinking on that cold march nights when the late snows are falling. Go ahead, drink the whole bottle and cross your fingers for a freeze so you can go to work late."
"A fine example of what a good RIS should be. A real pleasure to drink."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Notes - Quality stuff for sure. A no-frills RIS with plenty of complexity to keep it interesting."
"Smooth! A very good RIS. Drinkable, which I rarely say about this style. I love a good RIS, but rarely find them as drinkable as this one."
"Got this one from Whole Foods in DC. Nice surprise there. $7.99 for a bomber, which I could deal with. Pours a deep black color with a maroon-brown head that dissolves pretty quickly down. Nice looking. Nose is surprisingly mild, a little too quiet for my taste, although still quite good. Lots of dried fruit, chocolate and caramel malt. Taste was similar, although crazy strong. Tons of dried fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. A good bit of citrus spice too, that shows up as the hop profile kicks in at the end of the beer. Very mild alcohol presence, although its not biting at all. Feel is creamy and thick and very full. Perfect mild carbonation. Thought this one was incredible, although I'm not sure if it's quite as good as the Oak-Aged version (although I really can't remember what I rated that one, so who knows). A really perfect example of the style."
"The Yeti is a splendid beast raised in the Rocky Mountains with love and compassion by a wonderful brewery - and what a balance that is."
"the Yeti imperial stout poured pitch black. not a trace of light can be seen through the glass when held to light. an amazing dark creamy coffee looking head. loads of lacing is left on the glass. smell is chocolatey and the smell of smokey malts. taste is thick, flavors of sweet caramel, toffee, and chocolate. this beer also has a nice hoppy bitterness to it and i think it matches well with the sweetness. mouthfeel is thick and heavy. the drinkablity is good on a cold day. and of course with the ABV it warms you and keeps you warm for a while."
"Nothing short of incredible, Yeti is my favorite from Great Divide, which has moved into the cluster of genius breweries atop my favorites list. Their wares are outstanding, and those who have yet to try them will thank themselves when they finally do."
"D: One is enough for now but I'm sure I'll try more of this."
"Another great beer by Great Divide!"
"Overall, Yeti tastes great and leaves you begging for more. Each sip brings more complexity and new flavors."
"Overall a great beer - I'd recommend it, and certainly will be drinking it again. A great beer for hopheads looking for an imperial stout."
"Notes: No freshness dating, so I'm not sure of the age of this one -- it's been in my cellar for awhile, possibly a year or even a little more. If that's the case, the aging certainly didn't seem to hurt. . . . I shared this bomber with a friend and wished I hadn't . . . . Nice flavors, nice buzz. Well done. I would definitely get this again. And again. . . ."
"Amazing bang for the buck. Not sure I'd call this world class. I found Great Divide's Barlwey Wine to be more impressive."
"Actually the drinkability is not bad provided the decently high ABV. I, myself, actually prefer to sit back, sip this one, and take in all that wonderfully roasty goodness. Also if I inhale it like I would like to, I'll be kicked in the ass sooner than I'd like to be."
"D- overall, it's a good stout to drink. If not for the harsh alcohol which tended to come thru more than I'd like, this would rate as one of the better american imperial stouts I've had. Sweet, but not too sweet, bitter, but not insanely so, a good balance and overall, very drinkable."
"still, a very tasty stout."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable despite the noticeable alcohol content. This one will warm you up on a cold day."
"D - I could have one more and be very happy but that would be about it. This is alot of beer. Definite meal in a glass. I enjoyed it overall and would definitly buy it again. I would love to try the oaked version."
"D - overall a good RIS that is relatively easy to find and easy to drink as well. A big beer without being hugely overpowering as well. It is good in its simplicity and not overly complex which in a way is somewhat expected from an RIS. Definitely in the upper half of the RIS category and one that I wouldn't mind having on a cold winter's night. Who would have thought that I'd run to a yeti to keep me warm when it's cold outside."
"Overall, A big, bold beer. You'll need to take your time and sip it slowly. I definitely enjoyed it, and I'll drink more."
"This beer easily lends itself to pairing with dark chocolate and it may be the best match for a cigar of any beer I have yet encountered."
"Pours an ultra dark blackness with a tan head that leaves a good deal of lace around the tulip. Creamed, milk chocolate nose that is eager to engage the lips. Roasted malts, charred caramel, dark fruits all come out in full force. I need to try this oak aged version soon as I am definitely digging this one. Mouthfeel was average for an RIS. Overall...definitely a tasty treat when you can find it."
"D: A near-world class RIS, this is a bruiser of a beer. Big on all fronts, the bittersweet, heavy malts can be too much after awhile, but this is an awesome sipper. A bitch of a beer!"
"Pours like pitch black syrup. By far the darkest brew I have ever had, cannot see anything when held up to a light. Pours with an average size dark-brown head that mostly disappears. Lacing is excellent. The smell is almost nothing like the taste. Both moderate amounts of Malty and Hoppy aromas surface. I detected lime, pine, a nutty toasty smell, grain, and a little bit of chocolate and maple syrup. The taste and feel are both heavenly. This medium boddied brew goes down cream smooth with just a faint hint of carbonation and alcohol. The intial flavor is heavly sweet and over the long duration finishes ever so slightly bitter. Tastes of freshly roasted coffee. . .with some chocolate, so a mocha? Amazing beer, and this is comming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of stouts. Best beer I have had in a while!"
"D: Overall a bit dry for my taste, but it's well-balanced and a nice example of the style. Highly recommended."
"I must say the appearance to this was nearly perfect. Beautifully dark with a huge dark head and just unable to see through at all. Very sharp aromas, almost to the point of them being stingy, were sensed. These included sweet malts, barley, caramel and chocolate flavors. It had a bittersweet taste to it, explicit with its caramel and hop overtones. This one was smooth and creamy but surprisingly crisp too. Overall this was a pretty exceptional beer."
"22 oz. bomb into a mug. Wow. Deep and dark, almost black with nice frothy head. Chocolate caramel malt explodes on the nose. Burnt caramel malt coats the palate with just enough hops to even it out. Nice viscous feel to it. Could drink way more of this than one probably should."
"Pours a pitch black color with an average brown head that dissipated into a slight ring around the glass. The smell is heavily roasted malt, chocolate, charcoal, and resiny hops. The taste is a blast of roasted malt and resiny hops; really attacks the palate. There are notes of dark chocolate and prunes as well. The feel is moderate with slightly fizzy carbonation, finishes quite bitter with an alcohol burn. Between the malt and the hops this is a bitter bomb."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, and palate inviting for a big tasty brew."
"blind tasting of this and the oak aged. The beer pours wonderfully black with a nice tan head that lingered for the whole drink. The Aroma is of chocolate and strong roasted malt. The flavor (chocolate, coffee) just goes on and on. This is a big beer full of flavor and lots of bitterness. If not for the oak aged comparison I would have rated it higher."
"Black bour with a thick rich, sticky caramel brown head that lasted the entire time. Thick creamy lacing. Smells delicious. Coffee, chocolate, roasty sweetness. Taste is rich, thick, and coats the entire tongue with a powdery bitterness, similar to bitter cocoa powder. Long lasting finish with a good mouthfeel. From the pour, look, and smell, I was very excited, and the flavor didn't let me down, either. The high alcohol content was hidden well in my opinion. A great imperial stout."
"Wow. It's been a while since I've had a Yeti, so I expected good things, but not like this. This is absolutely fantastic. If you ever need to explain to someone what a Russian Imperial Stout is, give them a Yeti."
"Notes: This is a HUGE beer. Not for rookies. I found it to be a lot less abrasive than the oaked version. Definitely a treat that I hope to have again and again."
"Yeti pours impenetrable black. The head is good for an impy with good lace. The nose has more vanilla than the oaked version suprisingly. The taste is of vanilla, dark malt, and some slight fruit flavor. Nice subtle hop bitterness on the finish. Good kind of stoneish creamy flavor. Mouthfeel is a little bit thinner than i would like for an impy, but thick enough. drinkability is real high for an impy. Good brew, should age well."
"D - Damn the ABV! I'd drink this all night...it would be an early night though. This is a great winter sipping beer. Just about the best stout I've ever had."
"Exellent beer, scare your bud drinking brother in law and give him one for a wedding anniversary."
"This is one hell of a stout..WOW! Pours a craggy, tan head about 2 fingers. Smells of caramel, chocolate, vanilla, toffee..lots of scents. Pours also an opaque black color. Very heavy mouthfeel, very malty and chewy. Has some nice hop kickback, but the rich malt rounds it out beautifully. One of the best beers you can find in this country."
"only had one 12oz. to try so don't know if three or four or more would be to much but i would like to try."
"This is an interesting beer. One of the most bitter stouts I think I have had. Interesting and worth a try. Though there are other stouts I will reach for first."
"Drinkability: just a little too bitter for my taste.... still a quality RIS.... I just favor the sweeter ones."
"Pours a dark dark brown with a tan head. Smells of licorice, chocolate and a bit of sweet coffee. Tastes as it smells, with just a bit too much coffee flavor for me. I thought Speedway was overwhelmed with coffee, and didn't care for it that much. This was much better, though a notch less coffee would have been preferred. Not a huge falw, though. Very drinkable, and could have had a second bottle if I'd had one. Recommended."
"A solid imperial stout, nice to see it in 12oz bottles though this tasting was from a 22oz. Quite tasty and not overwhelming like some stouts."
"a great RIS. the perfect 1st beer for new years eve on a very cold northern minnesota night."
"Now this is a proper imperial stout. Full of taste and a solid mouthfeel makes this one a winner. Higly recommended if you can stand the bitterness :)"
"Pours slow and thick with a pitch black color. One inch dark tan head. Nose is smooth and creamed. Not very strong or overpowering. Flavor is thick with an even roasted malt edge. Very sweet tone to it, and the alcohol peeks out a bit with it. Seems a bit too sweet, but it is still even and good. Feel is very good. Creamy and smooth, even though the liquid is thick like most anything else. Drinkable? Well. It is almost TOO thick and almost TOO sweet. Between this and the Oaked Yeti, IÂ’ll take the Oak. Even without going back to read my review of the latter, I can still remember the awesome complexities and how overall it kicked ass. This one is good, but when youÂ’ve got a bigger brother whoÂ’s more accomplished, it is harder to compete."
"What a beer, a feast for noise and tongue!"
"Bottle poured black with a creamy tan head Aromas of alcohol, roasted malt and chocolate .Creamy full mouth feel. The flavor starts off sweat and roasted malts but finishes up with the strong hops bitter. almost to bitter for me I have an oaked age one of these in the cellar IÂ’m waiting to get up the courage to give it a try"
"D: This is a good RIS, but not like the Oak-Aged version, which was great. This one is kind of rough around the edges, tasty and solid as a beer, and of this style, but I have to go with the Oak if I'm comparing the 2."
"D - Very tasty RIS. High ABV% is fairly well hidden. Something to savour over an hour or so."
"If one wants to brew a powerful Russian Imperial Stout, there are lots of unwanted flavours that could spoil the palette. But Great Divide knows exactly what they want and how to get it. Brilliant!"
"Poured black and smelling citirc with yeast, coffee and chocolate notes. Alcohol too. The taste was of bitter chocolate, coffee, ashes, sweet fruits and alcohol. It's a well-crafted beer but a little to strong for my palate. Yeti is very sensitive to temperature and should not be consumed too cold since it will make the alcohol dominate the taste."
"A great Imperial stout. Wished they made a third version ..Smoked AND espresso induced. It may be all fives!"
"Very complex, very good. Lots of hops."
"I'm a nut for Russian Imperial Stouts; they're probably my favorite style. Yeti just became one of my favorite RIS's."
"Poured an attractive pitch black color that lets no light through. Had a brown head that it retained for a while before dissipating. Has malty aromas of chocolate and of coffee. Flavor is also of chocolate, coffee, but there is also hop flavor that sneaks through on the finish. Hides the 9.5% alcohol content extremely well. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability for the ABV is good. This is an excellent beer."
"Pours nice and velvety with an almond colored head, not too thick but remains throughout the entire glass. The color is dense black, like a good stout should be. The initial smell that you get is a mixture of malt, coffee, and a little of the alcohol hits the nose almost like a wine. In the taste you get more malt, good amount of hops for an imperial, and the sweetness of chocolate/caramel. It coats the inside of the mouth very nicely with a sweet aftertaste and the alcohol warming, but doesn't linger too long which is key. Suprisingly drinkable for 9.5%, although i couldn't see polishing off a whole sixer in one sitting (which is not as suprising). Definitely one of the best imperial stouts out there."
"Pours absolutely black; I couldn't get any light through at all. The head is reasonably thick, falls quickly and chocolatey, coffee colored brown. Leaves some interesting traces on the glass. The nose is extremely dense. Vanilla, light roast coffee, lots of malts, very heavy. The palate is equally dense and complex. Lots of roast malts, coffee, chocolate, nutty lots of alcohol warming. Bittering is very minimal. I can tell there are some hops characteristics, but I can't pick them out. Heavy mouthfeel, very minimal carbonation and an added lightness from high alcohol. Yeti follows the style of stout, but is absolutely immense, it feels big even for a sipper. Huge alcohol presence and dark, complex flavors limits this considerably."
"Thick, creamy, and smooth. Nice and slick, not sticky or cloying. Finishes dry. Full in body. Good drinkability - subtle yet complex flavors with alcohol that sneaks up on you."
"Cannot wait to try the Oak Aged version sometime soon after seeing how good this was, highly recommend, especially for the low price, luckily they also have this at Walnut Liquorette near me if I need some more bottles in the future"
"Pours black with a tan head that dissipates quickly leaving lace all the way down the glass. Smell is spicy floral hops, roast, some coffee and chocolate. Taste is a balance between hops and roast, like they are both fighting to be the dominant taste. Thick mouthfeel with a coffee aftertaste. A decent impy stout, and I'm sure it would be fantastic in a year or so, but I think the hop taste and aroma are to up front right now. I prefer my stouts less hoppy."
"The bottom line: A tasty take on the style by the folks at Great Divide. While I prefer the oak version of the beer, the standard Yeti holds its own and is also worthy of a rebuy."
"Feels thick and coarse. Not at all smooth, not in the least. This baby is a heavy-hitter. It's really strong. Which isn't to say it isn't good, it's just frickin' harsh."
"Drinkability: Very big and bold. A pleasure to consume."
"Jet black with a gorgeous milky coffee colored head with good retention. Heavy lacing on the glass. Chocolate and coffee nose with hints of vanilla ice cream. Big coffee taste upfront with chocolate and a very sweet malt taste. Alcohol is faint but present. If you don't taste it, you'll definitely feel it 22 ounces later. Wonderful feel that's smooth and very creamy. Almost orgasmic. Very dry roasted malt tasting finish. This is a great beer. Thank you Beer Gods."
"Pours an opaque darkness with better than a full finger fluffy dark tan head that fades slowly to sheets of lacing. The smell is awesome rich cocoa, roasted java over syrupy vanilla notes. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is thick and rich without being syrupy. Full flavored, the chocolaty taste over just the right amount of roasted malt and coffee characters. Really opens up as is warms. The chocolate-caramel complexity lingers appropriately. The 9.5% ABV can be detected in the nose and with the swallowing breath. Nicely done by a great bunch of people!! Happy Thanksgiving. Peace."
"D: Took me a while to drink half the 22. A nice sipping beer on a cool evening. Not that this beer ever would be an easy drinker. A good beer but there are better cheaper alternatives."
"22oz bomber into tulip glass. A: Very, very dark, thick as oil, moderate amount of dark brown head that goes down after a couple minutes. S: Really dark malts, coffee, caramel, with dark fruit and maybe even some citrus notes. T: Up front there's a lot of dark fruit and cocoa, giving way to a really intense bitter chocolate favor on the finish. Lots of stuff going on here. M: Very, very thick, coarse. D: A very intense beer, I couldn't drink much more than the 22oz bomber in front of me. But a great beer all around. I'll definitely pick it up again."
"This bottle had a few years on it. Cracked it open to celebrate the arrival of our first nice cold front. Beautiful jet black pour into the trusty Duvel leaves a mountainous 2 inch frothy dark beige head. Smell is all chocolate and roasted coffee - appropriate as I am watching ""O Lucky Man"" while I enjoy this wonderful beer. Taste - bye bye hops. If you were ever in there, the smooth chocolate and roasted malts have sent you packing. But then, after several long sips, the funniest thing happened. There, in the aftertaste, at the base of my tongue, some bitterness vainly hung on, a nice counter to the sweet onslaught. Very nice. This has held up wonderfully. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Alcohol is not noticeable. Drinkability? I killed this in under 30 minutes without even trying."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Presented with a dark brown/black opaque color. Virtually non-existent head that dissipated almost immediately. Very little lacing adhered to the glass during the sampling. Smell of malt and roasted coffee. Strong taste of coffee and chocolate with a subtle taste of toffee (it took me a few minutes to detect the flavor). Smooth milky consistency with a slight tingle of carbonation and alcohol on the tongue. Taste of coffee and chocolate lingers on the back of the tongue at the finish. A nice imperial very representative of the style. You won't be disappointed with the flavor; however a little pricey at $7.99 for a 22oz. bottle."
"Part of me wishes they brewed this in 12 ounce bottles because, without sharing it, the 22 ounces can be just a little too much of a good thing."
"Drinkability- This is a good beer. Again like the oak aged it is something nice to drink during winter."
"The drinkability really depends on your tastes and what you like. I could drink a couple of these but the high abv might slow some down a bit. I don't really taste the 9.5% abv but I can sure feel it :-)."
"This is an excellent example of balance, and is tehrefore a great sipping beer. Kudos to GD."
"It starts well, but the alcohol and excessive burnt notes get overwhelming quite fast. Disappointing."
"Definitely above average RIS, but I was expecting to be more impressed from the Yeti."
"D: The alcohol presence cuts into the drinkability a bit, but it's so good you won't care. Big beer fans will love this."
"This is certainly one of the best widely available stouts out there. I'm very impressed with the complexity of this brew."
"Bitterness is high, but not out of balance and the hops are giving the beer a great bitterness, although this is a bit subdued by the big body. With it's 9,5% alcohol I still get a warming feeling with every sip and my lips are a little sticky. This is truly a big beer with every aspect of the beer has been blown up to taste explosion proportions."
"New review and I'm gonna give this one another chance. Pours out a thick, inky black with a full burnt sugar head that sticks to the glass, leaving chunky and raised lacing. Aroma is chocolate ganache, medium roast coffee, orange/grapefruit oils, and subtle alcohol. Flavor starts off with intense roasted character that carries on throughout, along with a sweet underlying chocolate. Through the middle, there appears an out-of-place fruitiness from hops and the yeast. Some piney notes come out too and just don't sit well with me. Big bitterness from hops and highly-kilned malts in the finish in conjunction with lactic acid. There are some good things going on in the flavor, but it's all over the place and is something of a mess. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and viscous, but I'd really like the carbonation to be a touch more subdued. With some wild-ass flavors and super thick mouthfeel, drinkability is a little rough. I'd really like to try this with a few years on it. I'd take the oak aged version over this any day, even considering the price."
"Split a 22 oz. bottle of the Yeti with my brother, served in pint glasses. No freshness date to be seen on the bottle. Poured a pitch black, like motor oil. Very thick. Small brown head on it. A few bits of lacing. Aromas of dark roast coffee, hoppy bitterness, chocolate. Taste begins with a fizzy alcohol at the front of the mouth. Mellows a bit in the middle - strong flavors there of very dark chocolate. Very appealling. Ends with bitter notes. We sipped this as the beer returned to room temperature, which brought out an oaty, dark malty taste. Very interesting to see how the flavor transforms through the temperature change. Light carbonation; fairly creamy complexion. Overall, one of the best stouts I have ever tasted - really gets me back into this style again. Outstanding selection - highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is very full bodied, but has a dry finish. A pleasantly mild carbonation. Very, very drinkable. I had two bottles and I was done for the night. I am getting more soon."
"Pours an oily, pitch black. The head is almost non existent, and dark brown in color. The smell is earthy, and of roasted malts. Exceptionally smooth tasting, the hops wonderfully balance out the rich malt flavor. Hints of coffee, brown sugar, and an ever so slight citrus character. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, carbonation is just right. I was surprised at how carbonated it was, especially after the pour. A world class beer."
"Mouthfeel is good. Obviously, it was low in carbonation. It fits this beer well. Dangerously smooth which makes it go down fast. I've never given a high ABV beer a 5 in my reviews, but I'm giving it to this one. I could have easily had another pint of this, but I new better and opted for a Titan. Not sure that was the best option for lowering the ABV."
"This 12oz model had a freshness date of Apr 2006. The Yeti(sweet name) pours as dark as can be with a soft pillowy head that dissipates slowly. There is a cool little carbonation ring in between the head. The smell is good and has deep tones of roasted malt and coffee. The taste hits you with the 9.5 on the richter scale. You get the solid flavor of the roasted malt with a toffee undertone. It leaves the palate similar to after swallowing a piece of dark chocolate. The Yeti Stout is definitely imperial. This would be a great beer during the winter months or as a night cap."
"Different is often good, but not this time."
"This is one hell of an RIS. I will definetly see that this beer makes it into my fridge consistenly."
"Bottom line: An excellent example of the style and I highly recommend it!"
"D - This is a serious beer and should be taken seriously. This is the last beer of my session and with the high grav I don't think I'd have more than one of these in an evening at a time but I sure would be waiting for the next time I could break open a bottle of this."
"What I'd say is one kick ass RIS is sitting in front of me. A slight RS of caramel and toffee really bring the mid palate forth before the long hop induced finish, and alcohol burning in the chest. Roasty dark chocolate is very well integrated. Hints of vanilla and marshmallow with the same plethora of dark fruits noticed in the nose. More of a black currant, black truffle, black raspberry though. Creamy mouthfeel is only slightly thin but just barely missing A beer I shall buy and buy again."
"Great Divide does it again! Great Divide will unite us all someday."
"I think this one smelled a bit better than it tasted but it is still pretty good. Will drink it again but not as a staple."
"OK in the drinkability but I really expected more, especially since I like the oak-aged version so much. This is just OK, what it lacks is subtle flavors and layers."
"Overall, a great example of an RIS. Big in almost every way, but with balance. Recommended."
"Pours opaque black with a chocolate milk head that goes nowhere. Smell is chocolate, sweet molasses, some hops and some alcohol. Taste matches the smell. Chocolate notes, sweets, some hops some warming from the alcohol though itÂ’s not as present as the abv indicates. Full in the mouth yet not filling. Finishes a little dry. This is an amazing brew with amazing flavors all over the place. Could, and will try this again and again. DonÂ’t miss out on the opportunity to try this one."
"Overall a solid Stout. Not my favorite, but certainly unique and worthwhile."
"First pour is black as night with a very thin tan head. Subsequent pours gave a much thicker and heavier head. Smell is of coffee and chocolate. Taste is coffee and chocolate with a alcohol finish. Goes down much smoother than I expected. Polished off the bottle with dinner and loved every sip."
"Everything the nose picked up is on the palate. Coffee, molasses, chocolate, hops the alcohol is very warming. The coffee flavour seems to linger on and on. Amazing! I can sip this all night long."
"Overall, an extremely tasty brew. I think I like the orig. better than the oak-aged version. Either way, Great Divide is doing a fantastic job!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours black with a small, brown head that is fully diminishing. The aroma of chocolate dominates. Coffee and caramel were the two flavors that stood out to me. The chocolate flavor was more on the back end for me along with some nice hoppiness. Great mouthfeel with a medium/full body that is creamy smooth. I look forward to more of these in the future."
"Overall a very good and suprisingly clean RIS. Very drinkable."
"Creamy and smooth, just shy of the chewiest thick Imperial Stouts. Rather dry, with plenty of roast character in the finish. Big brew, very tasty and admirable effort."
"D: Definitely too much for session drinking, but one a day would make me a very, very happy man. Score big for Great Divide."
"Had this back to back to Old Rasputin and the czar is a touch better. I'm first hit by a clean grainy, pale malts aroma back up by cocoa. Definitely less bitterness and smoother than OR, but that's not necessarily good or bad. There a little citrus rind from hops hidden in the back. Flavor grows as the beer warms, but like OR I never found a fantastic complexity. It drinks smooth for the strength, but it's still thick and a bit tough to finish."
"D: Decent beer but no idea why its reviewed so high."
"I can only imagine what the Oak Aged is like in comparison to this, great beer, highly recommended."
"Overall, biggest surprise of my vacation, paied with a serving of Chimay Grand Cru cheese from the local cheesemonger. I would buy a case of his in a heartbeat, and it can be had in any season, IMO."
"Very impressive, thoroughly enjoyed this beer as the evening went on. Slowly sipped with a tiramisu dessert."
"Overall impression: Quite nice. Yeti is high drinkable with the velvety smooth sweetness that morphs into a dry bitterness. It is a good Imperial Stout and a good beer overall. A dark ale for a dark night. Oh yes."
"Big, tasty, and gets a lot right as far as I'm concerned. I would, however, definitely consider this a food beer. The first time I had it (from a bottle, not on tap), it was with barbecued spare ribs, and it was just about the best beer/food combination ever. On its own, it's a little harder to down, especially because it's not as much of a dessert beer as something like Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout."
"Thanks again for the bottle brentk56!"
"D- One of the better examples of the style."
"Drinkability: A very solid, powerfully roasty beer."
"Overall, this is a fantastic Russian Imperial Stout. I'll certainly be getting this again."
"Pours very thick and dark (two shades from black) with a thick toasted brown head that sticks to the glass and the beer's surface. Aromas of sweet, caramelly chocolate, doughy yeast and a burnt fruitiness. Highly roasted quality. On the palate, rather tight and winey compared to the aroma; there's also a green hop taste throughout the palate. Rather hot alcohol note crops up at the mid-palate and lasts through the finish, which is a touch thin. Mouthfeel is marked by surprisingly thinness, big carbonation the style, some hop oils felt on the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a decent imperial stout, but it's a bit non-cohesive and doesn't stand among the leaders of the genre."
"Richness and alcohol make this one a very slow sipper, but an enjoyable one. I had the oak-aged version a few months ago. I remember it being a bit better, but it would be interesting to compare them head-to-head."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, the beer was black with a thumbnail worth of head with some lacing. The smell was pleasant yet plain. Based on this beer being classified as a Russian Imperial, I was dissapointed in the taste. I'd classify more like a standard stout and question the rated ABV. If it was in fact 9.5% then it was the smoothest Imperial Stout I've tasted, but lacked any real character. A little hop finish was nice and I'm not criticizing the overal flavor. Mouthfull was medium and nice on the tongue without the expected bite. This is definitely a drinkable beer just not a great Imperial Stout."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Highly recommend."
"This one pours an inky black with one of the darkest brown heads I've ever seen on a beer, too bad it doesn't stick around much. When cold the smell is dominated by american citrus hops as it warms the malts move to the foreground led by chocolate and other roasted malts, the smell stays a bit on the weak side. The taste starts out bitter both from hops and bitter roasted malts, there is also a good deal of dark chocolate like flavor from the malt along with caramels, black coffee and a touch of alcohol spice. Mouthfeel is good nice and full low levels of carbonation however it is noticable the finish is fairly dry but there is a somewhat strong bitter aftertaste with some warming from the alcohol. Drinkability is above average I tend to be a bigger fan of the english style RIS's where the malt is in the forefront with little to no hop contribution this is good but I think I have had better."
"This one's fresher than I prefer, but this is still a damn fine beer. And I know it'll get better - it's a good thing, or I'd never be able to resist drinking the rest of these."
"A very big beer, a bit much for a late nightcap in fact. I wish you could grab it in four-packs."
"Drinkability - OK, not bad, but would not have converted me if it was the first Imperial Stout I ever tried."
"The first sip reveals a strong, almost tastebud overwhelming flavor of hops railing against the traditional coffee and roasted malt. Alcohol is present and accounted for and layers heavily on every sip. Mouthfeel is thick and oily and the aftertaste lasts forever. A rea nice beer bbut I could stand a touch less on the boozeometer and just let the taste shine through on it's own..."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as drinkable as other RIS but is still enjoyable once in awhile. I bet it ages well, and would consider cellaring it for a awhile."
"Taste is an incredible malt explosion. Tasty chocolate and creamy toffee malt caress the palate and never let go. They hang on from the first sip and hang to the palate with strong viscosity. The malts in this beer are incredible, they mend and meld perfectly and achieve a perfect balance throughout the sip. Piney hops join the flavor board midway through works well to produce a nice balanced flavor. Toned and refined, Yeti Stout is a fierce and dangerously drinkable RIS. A malt bomb that is nearly flawless. Definitely recommended."
"This is a great beer. Try it if you haven't, but, I prefer the oaked version over this one. The oaked version has smoother edges when compared to the original. This is still a great beer, let alone a great RIS. Yummy."
"D- Great smell and flavor, once again the bitterness was a degrading factor for me, along with the alcohol not being very well covered up."
"This is an awesome, awesome stout-- I can't wait to rerate."
"Drinkability: Poor, I really found this to be a great beer however I could only enjoy it in small pours, maybe 4-5oz. at a time."
"The mouthfeel is thick and chewy along with some fabulous tanginess. This is an excellent beer, matched by only a few."
"The taste is both subtle and direct at the same time. Bitter coffee and chocolate malts command the flavor at the front of the palate, while hop notes discreetly work the rest. Absolutely no hint of alcohol here, which can be good or bad, depending on who you are. For this beer, however, it definately works. The mouthfeel is the epitome of ""velvety", as an amazingly smooth, thick body coats the tongue and inside of the mouth. Semi-sweet bitterness kisses the back of the throat on the finish. Even though I love most brews from Great Divide, I hadn't yet found a RIS that truly hit the spot. Consider the position filled. This beer has it all: taste, complexity, smoothness, a 9.5% ABV that only reveals itself halfway through the bottle (or by checking it on BA). Job well done, Great Divide."
"22oz bottle purchased from Total Wine in Clearwater FL. My first imperial stout! As such, I should mention that I'm not much of a stout drinker. More of a hop fan. So I figured an imperial stout with a lot of hops could be up my alley. Pours black with some head depending on the pour. Smells very very much like a stout. All strong malts. Tastes pretty much like a stout too - in fact, somewhat surprisingly so. Lots of roasted malts and some hints of coffee. There are some hops in the aftertaste, but it's not as substantially different from some other stouts as I was expecting. But it's definitely a very full flavoured stout - I would drink more stouts if they were like this one. Can't say I particularly tasted the alcohol - though I felt it!"
"A good big stout, but I like some others better."
"D: A complex stout that has alittle more hop flavor than most for the style. Each sip leaves you wanting another. I enjoyed this brew with a nice steak and it was a good pairing. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Too alcoholic and bitter to go down smooth. Overall a disapointment to me. Lacks balance"
"Pours very dark, lightly carbonated, only a hint of a head/lacing. The smell is a dark chocolate/ raisin nose, almost a port-like, very nice. Taste/mouthfeel comes across ""thick"" feeling, coats the mouth like a rich stout should. It is obvious there is a lot a alcohol here, but it does not come across as overly hot. This is difinitely a sipping beer, I think this bomber is going to knock me over. I would recommend finding a friend to share this. If you are a stout fan, this is worth checking out. I will almost certainly give this a try again."
"Pours black as night, absolutely opaque. It has a thick pancake head that is tan and disappears pretty quickly but leaves great lacing. The smell is of rum soaked raisins, dark chocolate, prunes, licorice, port wine and a finish of cocoa. The alcohol is definitely noticeable, but its more in the nose than the taste. The taste is wonderful. A perfect blend of roasty flavors, creamy mouthfeel, and chocolate and dark fruit with brandyish overtones. Wonderful flavors very well balanced, and with a big finish. Big but smooth and creamy mouthfeel. For the high abv and big flavors,its still quite drinkable."
"Drinkability- Right up there with my favorite stouts (Stone and Alesmith). Worth trying for sure."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is obvious but not overpowering. balance is a little off, but not bad. very enjoyable, even at 9.5%abv."
"D - not highly quaffable due to the gravity, but luscious and intense to say the least. One to sip and savor for all of it fullness and depth"
"Beer pours very dark, relatively thick, beautiful thick cocoa colored head. Beer itself is jet black, with the barest hints of ruby at the edges when held to light. Smell is dark, velvety. Cocoa, coffee, toffee, some hop bitterness. Taste is very similar to smell. Rich, luscious flavor, like cold cocoa with coffee beans and dark toffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth and luxurious. Again, the word that comes to mind most thinking about his beer is ""velvety"". Drinkability is good, though it goes down smooth enough that the relatively high ABV (9.5) can sneak up on you. I certainly don't think I could drink this all night (though there aren't many beers that I could), but putting this bomber away will be no problem. Very nice beer."
"I had this beer on-tap at Landmark 1850 Inn in Milwaukee. I have some doubts as to the sanitation of their tap-lines; nothing I drink there seems to taste as good as it should."
"Dark, dark, and more dark. Thick and impossible to see through. Huge head with strong aromas. I got a 22 and it was tougher and tougher as the sips continued. Smells of roasted malts with hints of vanilla/chocolate. Taste is not bad and has some character but not balance. Nice roasted malts, some chocolate and vanilla. More hops that I expected in the taste, moreso than Storm King even. Alcohol was very noticeable towards the end. Medium to full mouthfeel but overly bitter, still not bad. Drinkability is average, it's a RIS. They're high in alcohol but it's also easier to pick up the alcohol here, so I don't know what to say. Great Divide is great...this one, though, more average."
"Alcohol is slow to warm you after you swallow making this a very dangerous brew."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber picked up from Nikki's liquors in N. Providence, RI. Nice frothy tanish offwhite head. Massive lacing down the pint. Smell is of roast and chocolate malts with a nice hoppy porfile in the background. Certainly smelled like an Imperial Stout. Had a rather strong alcohol tone throughout. Taste was of roasted malts with a nice flavor of hop bitterness. It was pretty smooth and enjoyable. Masive hop flavor for an Imperial Stout. Had a rather nice full body with massive roasted and chocolate flavor balance out with the hop profile. Overall a good tasting beer I would certainly drink it again. You can tell it is 9.5% but it is well rounded and drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This bad-boy poured a jet black with a large, thick head that was off-white. It tends to stick to the glass a bit before dripping back down into the body. Very creamy and solid. The smell was roasted throughout: coffee, chocolate, malts, with a bit of a burnt character. The taste was exceptionally rich with a light burn on the finish as the roasted nuttiness fills the mouth. Very thick and creamy in the mouth as if a generous portion of whipped cream was added to the mix. Warms the body as it goes down. For an exceptionally rich taste and character, it still remains quite drinkable. Good, well-crafted stuff here."
"Last night session evolved around several RIS and Yeti was on that list. Poured a thick motor oil black with a 4 inch mocha coffee head that cascade to 2 inches. Left an excellent amount of sticky lacing an the glass. The aroma was harsh, roasted almost burnt malt, strong coffee witn a hint of vanilla. The flavor was intense but a tab harsh. Started of the way it ended, strong long bitter chocolate and dark coffee, that left a tart residue on my lips. Was surprise by the mouthfeel, medium to full body, softly carbonated with a small bite of alcohol and watery. The appearance led to to believe that this would be a thick even syrupy brew. One think I did notice was the hops shined through when consumed cold as oppose to warm when the harsh elements came out. Overall, I like this brew. Although, I enjoyed the Oaked Yeti more. Yeti has alot to offer in boldness and complexity."
"Pours out the expected pitch black. Creamy milk chocolate head with quite a lot of lacing. Aroma is sweet chocolate malt. Flavour backs up the aroma- chocolate, some licorice, sweet toffee, finished off by a hoppy dry finish. Thick and luxurious. Less hoppy than expected, although I have been sitting on this bottle for over six months. The roasted malts were actually subdued. I enjoyed the oak aged version slightly more as it has more complexity and I enjoy the vanilla notes in it. Still this is an excellent impy stout from one of my favourite breweries."
"This beer is black. It has a thick brown head that is persistent. The smell is heavy of malt and some big caramel tones. The taste is malty and caramel. There are some roast flavors as well. This is a big beer with lots of character Â– spiciness and alcohol are noticeable. The mouthfeel is heavy, but fits well with the flavor. As for drinkablity, while it is deliciousÂ…..I think that it is a bit rich for more than a few."
"D - One of the more drinkable Imperial Stouts I've tried. The alcohol is hidden incredibly well, which attributes to the great taste. I really can't say enough about Yeti and Great Divide. They seem to exhibit every passion possible involved in brewing."
"Not a beer I would drink all the time but on special occasions or with a large dinner. It does go down smooth but this beer is to rich to enjoy in mass quantities."
"An outstanding example of an imperial stout. Highly recommended."
"9.5% alcohol is pretty nice. I probably wonÂ’t buy it again Â– for the price I can get nearly three times as much from Berkshire Brewing Company, an arguably equivalent (or better) beer."
"This is the thickest, blackest, gooiest oil looking looking liquid I have ever had the pleasure of sipping on! Hue big creamy frothy head, colored dark brown that would not fade on me, had to stay around and hang out. Black as night with big lace, looked perfect for an Imperial Stout, had to give it a 5! Smell was complex, albeit not as strong as I would have liked, but Chocolate, caramel, and coffee all were able to come through for me. Hint of alchol, which is to be expected at over 9%abv. The taste was ...yummy! Totally coffee and chocolate duking it out to predominate this one. Alcohol definatly there s well, but not bad at all, just enough to let you know to watch out. Hint of chocolate came through as it warmed, big dry hoppy finish, very nice! This is a very thick drink, like a chocolate milkshake, very warming a it goes down, very creamy and great late at night before bed! Overall I really enjoyed this and it is a toss up between this and the oaked yeti, I love them both, but definatly distinct and I could see why they chose to experiment with it, though it can definatly hold its own with any Imperial Stout!"
"Mouthfeel has firmed up, nice aromas, no doughy flavor this time, roasty with a bitterness that lasts, I bet this can age awhile longer."
"A beauty of a thick pour. If you love stout and coffee this is for you. Deep, delicious and well balanced. Big start and long finish. The depth of rich flavor dominates this stout which is another big, bold and beautifully crafted beer. from Great Divide.Well done !"
"D - Good. I think I prefer the oak aged, but this isn't far behind. I will certainly have one of them again sometime."
"4-6 month old bottle picked up a while ago at City Wide. Decided last night to drink it finally. Pours big and black tar colored with foamy, cream-topped khaki head. looks impressive. Hoppy, chocolate odor, full of fruit and treacle, fudge and cream. The odor of a good imperial stout makes it for me almost as much as the taste does and this one really makes the grade. Taste is great...a massive beer full of drity, leafy hops, roast chocolate malts, anc clingy boozy fruits. Hoip character bitters the beer throughout, especially on the finish. Thick and sticky mouthfeel. glug glug. A great beer. my only question is why this doesn't cost more? Holy crap, i'm rich! i can buy tons of this decious elixir"
"Definitely a sipper, and not as ""in your face"" as say a Storm King or a Rogue IS. But it holds it's own and is right there with the front running Imperial Stouts in complexity and drinkability."
"I'll buy it again and again. It does the job. Don't jack with the price."
"very good"
"Wowza, Yeti Imperial Stout is one very pleasant beast. It pours from the bottle a nice dark color (not pitch black but almost there). There is a beastly proportioned coffee colored head which sticks around for some time. The smell is a very nice aroma of malt, coffee, and floral hops. The taste is both a sweet and bitter smack to the senses, with a hearty coffee kick to to teeth. There is a chewy coating to the lingual side of the teeth, the tongue and the palate. This is a true delight. I certainly recommend searching for this beast!"
"It really is amazing how weather can affect one's affectations for a particular beer. Its 34 degrees and snowy, and the perfect compliment on my day off is to revisit a nice RIS like Yeti. My first review was during much warmer climes. A: Deep dark, opaque black. Impervious to light. Blacker than my ex-fiance's heart. (Not to sound jaded, I actually called the wedding off), with a dark brown head and nice residual lacing. S: Too much to note: toffee, carob bean, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate. Very complex. T: Sweet out of the blocks with a strong, hearty, malted presence that transitions into an alcohol soaked hoppy bitterness. In a word: Delicious. M: Substantial, thick, viscous and chewy. Perfect for the style. D: Given the cold temps I find sessionability limted due only to knowing the ABV, but for sheer enjoyment, I could drink this all night. I am glad I revisited this beer during the winter months. I'll be in Denver in 3 weeks and I will indulge in all the Great Divide beers ad nauseum. Great Divide and Conquer!"
"Ginormous body, silky and luscious. Very strong, yet so silky smooth, that I could drink two of these. Awesome and clean. A very good brew."
"Have Another?: Definitely."
"I haven't had an Imperial Stout this good in a while. In my opinion, it is one of the best out there, second only to Victory Storm King."
"Unfortunately for me this is outside of my beer market so outside of trades or trips south this one will go down as a definite wish it was in my area."
"A very nice ale. one of the better Imperial Stouts there is."
"Very nice sipping stout. Rich and complex. Things only seem to get better as it warms. I'm looking forward to aging a few."
"This is a great RIS and I will purchase this again, even though I have to go out of my way to do so."
"D - Great for a snowy day with chilly winds and freezing feet."
"This is a great Imperial Stout. Very robust and full flavored, a little less (or no) soy sauce would make it perfect."
"Poured into a nonic, an inky opaque coffee black, with rich brown head that dissipates to a centimeter or two. Nice sticky lacing all over the glass. Smells surpassingly of hoppy fruit, up against a toasted malt, black patent, dry roasted coffee beans, chocolate and yeast. Taste is medium bittersweet roast, balanced through out with a dark chocolate style bitterness. Some fruit comes out toward the mid section and on the swallow there is a battle between the fruitiness and the toasted coffee character. This is a tasty RIS, but it is strange to me, because of the their hop choice, not that it is bad by any means it is just very different than I am used to in RIS. I except all the toasted stuff, coffee and dark chocolate bitterness, but not so much the fruity hop stuff. I like this, how ever I think I prefer the my RIS with out the fruit, but this is still damn good. So worth having. I can't wait to try the the oak aged yeti."
"Rich thick viscous syrup that is sweet with flavors of redolant ripe cherries dipped in chocolate, coupled with fresh mochachino. Hands down the best RIS I've ever encountered. I'm so glad that Great Divide is available locally now, though my liver is somewhat alarmed."
"Drinkability is high here if you like this heavy dark brew."
"Served in a snifter @ 59 degrees. Pours the color of HersheyÂ’s chocolate syrup, with a creamy head the resembles an over cooked flan. Completley opaque, and dense. Truck loads of Americn hop aroma. Grapefruit, and evergreen to be precise. Burnt sugar, carmel, dried fruits are apparent. Each drink is bliss. The hop character starts with Â’shock and aweÂ’ type attack, then a big slap of rich dark chocolate takes the middle, and finishes like a bitter cup of gas station joe with chocolate flavoring. Top that off with a mouthfilling body, and a slight alcohol burn, and you have a staple beer for any stout lover."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle purchased this past August in Fort Collins Co. Not ink, but pretty darn close. Has amber hue in the head that stays low with super fine bubble detail and lacing that hasn't changed from initial pour. Deep carmel, toffee and chocolate smell tastes exactly that til the strong taste of hops and alcohol finishes with some cigar and chocolate. This brew is very rich with oily mouth feel which I like. The alcohol is strong but seems to be separate from the overall taste which reduces my ""taste"" score somewhat. The lacing and carbonation have not changed in the 20 minutes I have tasted. This is an excellent version of Imperial Stout that needs to hide the alcohol somewhat."
"Poured a dark black color with rich, thick, dark brown head. Aroma was a magnificent carmel-toffee, with hints of chocolate. The flavor was a continuation of this toffee-caramel-chocolate, and the alcohol crept in as the beer warmed to be a perfect complement to the malty-sweet-candy shop flavors. Left an excellent sweet-dry palate. This is the best Impy Stout IÂ’ve ever had."
"Pours pitch black with hints of amber around the edges when held to the light and a nice dark brown 2 finger head and decent lacing. Smells of dark roasted malts with some dark fruits and coffee also present. Taste is of roasted malts, followed by somewhat citrusy hops. Also present are caramel, toffee, espresso, and some molasses. It was a bit more hoppy than I had expected but the flavors were well balanced. Good mouthfeel, thick in body but smooth. The high ABV is well hidden behind the nicely balanced malt and hop flavors. Very drinkable."
"D: A very nice RIS, one that I'm sure I'll have again. The balance and flavor are quite good; my wife tried a couple sips and declared it to be the first of this style that she would drink. That's saying something. Recommended."
"D - Unbelievable. I've never found a RIS that I didn't like but this may be the best."
"Overall, a nice bitter hopsy strong stout, great looking and enjoyable. Paired with steak and potatoes, this was a real winner for me. Cheerfully recommended."
"D - Not a bad beer, interesting you might say. however, i don't think i'll be having this again - i like a little more bittersweetness in my impy stouts, and this one is just too savory."
"Too rich to have more than one, this beer is thick and coats the throat well. Leaves a bit of alcoholic taste. Nice imperial stout made wery well for tasting, but def. not a session beer."
"D- good brew, no complaints to register here, pretty drinkable as well."
"A wonderful libation. I can't wait to have a few more of these over the winter. Thanks a bunch, Great Divide!"
"D- This is right up there with Victory strom king stout. Bold, black, rough and strong. I like."
"A simply amazing stout! This is a MUST have beer. You won't believe how smooth it is."
"Side note: It is more well rounded in flavors and mouthfeel than its oak-aged counterpart, but this brew is as good as it gets flavorwise, whereas aging the oak-aged version would soften it and propel it over the regular version."
"D- I think this is an amazing stout. It just has a great blend of flavors. I think this could easily be one of my favorite RIS that you could drink every night (unlike something like the Dark Lord where it's more for a special occasion)."
"M - A nice thick, full body here really coats the mouth. Very nice."
"A fine Imperial Stout."
"Quite smooth palate... velvety. A great beer."
"Pours a jet black, no light thru this beer, with a huge chocolate/milk like foamy head. Absolutely beautiful. Great head retention and lacing make this a classic beer. The smell is chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malt, making this a nice sweet aroma. The taste is sweet with chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and dark fruit. A great tasting stout, more sweet with chocolate than dark fruit makes this a heavy m/f and very drinkable for a high octane beer. A classic that should not be missed. Cheers."
"Poured from it's 22oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a thick pitch black with a tannish brown head. Aroma consists of a vast array of flavors that range from dark fruit, coffee, chocolate, molasses and alcohol. Taste is dark and almost burnt malt and chocolate that make way for the long roasty bitter finish in which the hops peak their head out to say hello. This is a big complex beer that should be treated as one especially considered it's high ABV. Overall, this is a wonderful Imperial Stout that is strongly recommended."
"Pours black with hints of brown and red. Almost no head and lacing. The aroma is cascade hops (?) and a little maltiness and roasted grains. The first sip is intense; total hops on the palate followed by roasted grains and maltiness. The hops uses pair extremely well with the maltiness and roasted flavors of the brew. It finishes with some residual sweetness that leaves you wanting more. This is a sipper beer but very delicious. I'll definnitly get this one again when I'm craving a hoppy beer but not necessarily an IPA. Great for a cool, autumn night."
"Bottle. Pours black with a one finger head which is maintained for an appreciable amount of time. A bit of a syrupy feel, but to be expected for the high abv of 9.5%. Starts out a little bitter but then hits a chocolate note and then hardens too a nice coffee finish. One bottle put me in a good frame of mind. Would I have a second, most definately yes, but not tonight."
"IÂ’m really liking this RIS, the high alcohol may limit my intake to one bomber for the night (hey, home alone on Friday, donÂ’t ask)"
"Drinkability: Its a damn fine beer but a 22 oz bomber (even by itself) is probably enough for me. This one began to feel a bit rough around the edges as I finished off my second glass. I was stupid enough to have it with an Oaked Yeti bomber."
"The drinkability is great, no defects in this robust RIS offering. A huge and magnificent brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl! MK"
"The high ABV is hidden well, making for a very drinkable beer that could possibly lead to trouble if you have a few. Great beer that's making me reallly look forward to the oak aged Yeti I have on storage."
"This brew is completely black, with essentially no light penetration at all. The head is thick, dense, and intricate, leaving a very agreeable lace. Nice smell: chocolate and coffee, highly roasted grain, a bit of roasted malt, and a hint of dark and meaty fruit. Chocolate malt is maybe the preeminent characteristic. ThereÂ’s a creeping background of alcohol as well, becoming notably present as the beer warms. Nice flavor. Lots of roastiness and bitterness. Heavy, thick, full, creamy, and strong. More bitterness than many beers, which fits the flavor perfectly. This is an extremely satisfying and very luxurious stout."
"Drinkability: Nice slow sipper and a great tasting RIS. I won't hesitate to buy this one over and over again."
"12 oz bottle. Purchased in Oregon, not available in CA. Pours motor oil black with a big creamy head. Sweet, rich, dark as hell with a creamy nitro texture. Aftertaste lasts forever, full of rich roasted malts and some bitter hops along for the ride. Really drinkable, quite a fine example of the style. Loads of extreme flavors are totally working together to make one fine sipping beer. This would age great. Cheers!"
"DA: 9.5% ABV and you can really taste the alcohol! This one is wcked tasty and heady but beware...the ABV!!!"
"D - Very drinkable. This is an exceptional RIS from GD."
"Very well rounded beer. Strong alcohol that doesn't mask the flavors. Great Divide makes a fine example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Be sure to introduce this one to your friends."
"d - Very nice, but a little hot and heavy for summer drinking."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black stout with a medium off-white foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and vanilla is very enjoyable. Taste start with some bitterness from the roasted malt and hops but then fades away to leave a strong vanilla finish. Body is about medium full and could have been fuller and alcohol is well hidden. A bit more sweet then the oak-aged version but as enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Like the Yeti, this beer is a monster and I mean that in a good way. This beer is very flavorful with almost every dark flavor out there. A must try RIS that's widely available. I'm glad I got to try this beer."
"Drinkability: This wasn't a favorite when I shared it with the neighbors - ""too bitter!"" went the refrain. I liked it, but that said I drank it slowly, and probably a little bit more than I would have prefered. ""Intense"" is the word."
"The smell is very good, with tons of roasted malt and a soft hop flavor with some wood and alcohol. The taste is rich and creamy, with more roasted malt joining chocolate up front, and big hops clearing out the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat light but still nice, and drinkability is good."
"Ever since having a Titan IPA a few years ago, I continue to be impressed with Great Divide's lineup of beers. They are always consistently good and as the years go by, increasingly more available. The Yeti RIS is excellent and ranks and the top of the American-style Russian imperial stouts. Of course, if you can get a hold of the oaked Yeti, that's even more of a treat."
"DÂ—a sipper for the colder months I think, ItÂ’s very good and I will return to this again in the winter."
"Taste is full, bold coffee and cocoa. A really smooth overall taste with a pleasant, clean aftertaste. Not much alcohol in the taste, either. ItÂ’s hidden behind walls of malty goodness. Mouthfeel is also big and full. But low carbonation helps it go down smooth. ItÂ’s hard to find fault in this brew. Perhaps the only downside is the bigness and chewyness of this beer and the fact that its 9.5% will kick you in the ass."
"This is a fun beer, but very heavy-handed."
"Poured motor oil black from a big ol' 22oz bottle. Not much medium brown head with some lacing as it went down. The aroma was what I call the typical ""dark roasted stout smell"" along with alcohol. I wanted to find more but couldn't. The taste was similar, but I detected notes of bourbon and dark chocolate. The high alcohol was notable but not overpowering. Overall, it felt creamy, had a somewhat lingering bitter aftertaste, and went down relatively easy. There are other stouts that I like better, but this was a good one."
"Overall: Rich, bold and strong, but incredibly mellow and smooth in some respects. The flavors blend very well creating a nice balance."
"D- Absolutely love this one. Wish we had it in our top 10 tasting recently. So creamy and smooth it is hugely drinkable. I'll have a few more!"
"D: This ale is quite good, I much prefer it to the oak-aged version. A very good West Coast hopped stout, although the abv is limiting."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer and is damn delicious. I like this way better than the oaked version. This is a good example in the theory that not every beer needs to be oak aged. This is definately worth picking up if you see it...actually its worth trying to find someone to send it to you in a trade. The effort will pay off once its in your glass."
"Pours almost black. Very thin tan head. Not much retention, but very nice lacing. Smell is strangely wine like, with a bit of roasted malt. Body is medium, with not much carbionation. Taste is again wine like,with roasted coffee, malt, nut, very complex, but...WOW. You must try this beer! Excellent."
"For anyone looking into this style, this is a great introduction to Russian Imperial Stouts."
"This beer is very chewy and thick. It coats the tongue and the bitterness hangs with you for a while. The overall drinkability is good and it is one of my favorite RISs."
"To sum up... one great 'big' beer packed with flavour and richness."
"Pours a Dark muddy brown with a sticky 2 inch carmel colored head that stayed throughout the whole drink. Smell is of raosted carmel nuts with a hint of warm apples. Taste of of chocolate coffee with hints of espresso and roasted almonds, alcohol is masked very well, I was really feeling this one after it was over. I could sip this one all night it went very well with the pizza I was eating and wished that it wasn't over, damn fine stout from the good ole Great Divide."
"-Oelergud"
"Out of the 12oz bottle into my handy Lion-branded ""stout"" glass.. Poured well, with a small head. Dark as can be - nothing was showing through it even when held up to a window. After a sip, a tan-brown lacey head slowly crept back down into the glass. Some hints of carbonation in the mouth, along with definite roasted malt and wood flavors. Perhaps a hint of an un-sugared chocolate? Quite drinkable, this is a good beer!"
"d - incredible from beginning to end. creates a warming sensation as you drink it from it's heaviness and higher alcohol content. a great beer on a winter's night."
"overall a fantastic beer. a great start to many reviews to come"
"Yeti reafirms everything I love about stouts and everything I am learning about imperial versions. An absolutely terrific beer."
"This beer has an awesome look to it. A pitch black beer with a darker tan head that leaves solid rings of lace down the glass. The smell is quite complex with roasted malt, chocolate, and a sweet maltiness. The taste is very similar to the smell though in reversed order. The first thing noticed is the sweetness of the malt, followed by chocolate and then a coffee like bitterness from the roasted malt in the finish. I may even be picking up on a hint of hop bitterness as well, but that may just be the coffee like bitterness from the roasted malt. The mouthfeel is quite thick and sticky. For drinkability, it's not too bad. I could grab a 22 oz. of this sip it over an evening."
"For its style this is quite drinkable, in that the alcohol is largely hidden..though it does tend to heat the belly after a while."
"from the bottle. poured black with a huge brown head that left a lot of lacing. aroma roasted malts, coffee, dark sweet chocolate, raisins, brown sugar, alcohol comes ot nicely along with some sweet oranges. flavor wow this beer is packed with roasted flavor from the coffee, malts to a nuttyness, got some dark cherries and a hint of citrus. very good beer."
"Yeti Imperial Stout pours a virtually pitch black color with only the slightest amount of brown head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. This is a very aromatic beer, good strong chocolatey malt stands out, with a little bit of hops in the background. Big taste too, chocolate malts are noticeable, alcohol is fairly well hidden, though I suspect that drinking this bomber is going to put me in bed for the night. Overall this is truly an excellent beer. Well worth seeking out and even hoarding! LOL, well, seeking out and drinking anyway. I'm trying to stop hoarding, no room left in the fridge for food. Enjoy!"
"This beer poured black as night into a 16oz pint glass with a half inch head that lingered. Aroma was of espresso coffee, licorice and hops. Taste was of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and some brandyish/liquor flavors. A nice hop bitterness added to the mix of flavors. Mouthfeel was very rich and thick. This is not a stout for the faint of heart and is better suited for a cold, cloudy day in December than a warm muggy day in June. But hey, I drink whatever I'm in the mood for. I plan on cellaring some bottles of this beer for the upcoming fall and winter."
"Alcohol never really shows itself in this one. Quite easy drinking, in fact. To drink more than two of these would be pushing it though."
"Drinkability - rich, hearty, and satisfying, the only thing here is the high abv."
"Taste is hoppy at first, where it tickles your palate then followed by a floral touch which ends with a distintive roasted coffee taste. A very complex beer that drinks itself in three stages, Hops, malt- chocolate and coffee."
"This is a great Impy. Probably one of my favorites so far. I would like to try this on a colder day to see if the tastes and aromas and overall feelings and interpretations are the same. A great beer in my opinion."
"Oh baby, this brew pours like oil. Dark, dark brown with a brown chocolate foamy head. It's got a nose like a cafe mocha, rich dark toffee chocolate aromas. Very very inviting. Fantastic taste, this brew is all roast. Follows up with a nice chocolatey after taste. The mouthfeel has slight carbonation with a strong alcoholic tone. Smooth and delicious, highly recommended."
"This beer pours jet black with a creamy tan head that holds nicely and laces well. The smell is rich roasted and chocolate malts. The taste is rich roasted chocolate malts again. This beer is if nothing else, extreamly smooth. Just a great mouthfeel. Overall highly drinkable, just a fantastic brew."
"Great Divides big beers are out this world good, and this beer is no exception. Big, creamy, full bodied, just enough bite and just enough bitterness to be both in your face and yet never overpowering. Almost the session beer of big beers."
" Looked incredible, smelled like heaven on earth. I just really had trouble getting past the heavily perfumed after-taste. I could not drink this regularly. Sorry guys."
"Bottle Pours a murky black with a good brown red head. The head lasts very well and produces good lacing. Has a very nice aroma of roasted malts with hints of toffie and carmel chocolate. The taste is blended excellently. Has a good amount of hops to produce a smooth sweetness with its malt backbone. Has a medium body and a good amount of carbination. This is real good. A nice bold stout with soft touches to produce an excellent brew."
"Thick and chewy with the 9.5 ABV coming on slow and warm makes this great sipping brew that I will definitely have again."
"Careful, once you start, you can't stop. It's a good thing I only have this one 22oz bottle, or I'd be in real trouble. The ABV WILL get you eventually, though, so pace yourself."
"The taste is dominated by chocolate and hops, with a burning alcohol presence. Pretty good stuff."
"Taste: Nice sweet express flavor also complements by a large amount of bittering hops. The astringency is balance nicely by the sweetness making this brew very drinkable. Over all a good brew."
"Nope, no desire to buy this again when I need a stout fix. There are far better stouts on the market, many of them far cheaper. Great Divide, you're a kick ass brewery but you dropped the ball here."
"Black with a tan head, leaves no lacing, but the head forms a creamy swirl in the glass. Mostly toffee and caramel in the nose with a hint of coffee. Starts out toffee with coffee and piney hops bursting through in the finish; dark chocolate in there as well. Full bodied with not very much carbonation, heavy in the mouth, fits great. It was a joy drinking this, and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"Taste; the piney hops, roasted malts and coffee really play well together. Dark chocolate and fruits flow through in the middle, and a nice sweetness counters a strong alcohol presence in the finish. Muhfeel is full bodied and silky smooth, but with the high abv the drinability takes a bit of a hit."
"I've been enjoying this at my local beer bar this last month or so. The beer is a rich, full stout. Lots of cream and foam in the head. The beer is black. I really appreciate the chocolate and espresso notes because they are barely noticeable through the roasted malt presence. Hops are big but not too big. This beer is a great imperial stout that all should sample. Beware of the ABV."
"A black as ink beer no highlights from light save one, IT's Black. Has a big creamy brown head with good lace. The aromas of coffee and chocolate just pour over the sides of the glass with maybe a hint of cherry deep in the background. The taste starts with a bittersweet and alcohol combo snap. That quickly slides into a creamy choclatey mouthfeel and some nice coffee notes on the finish."
"Easy drinking once you get used to it. Looks thicker than it tastes, drink at cellar temp."
"I can see why people recommend drinking this bomber over an entire day. Wow. It takes a while to drink, but I savoured every sip."
"Poured up jet black with a bit of a rocky, caramel coloured foamy head that hung around for several minutes before subsiding to a layer of khaki coloured frost. Very sticky lacing looks like cake batter stuck to the sides of my glass. Beautiful!! I get only two fragrances from this monster: hops & chocolate. Nothing else. Smells delicious! Taste is big, bitter hops up front, with a heavy malty middle. Finish leaves powerful dry chocolate malt with a touch of coffee beans in your mouth. Fantastic!! Mouth feel is boldly heavy while still smooth and pleasant to drink. Drinkability is good for one bomber. As heavy as this is, I'd be hesitant to open a second one of these. Absolutely smashing!"
"I will definetly look forward to my next bottle. I'll let it warm up further before drinking it."
"This is a very well-crafted brew, and one of the best Russian Imperials on the market. It meets my expectation of a full body with a roast maltiness without being overwhelimgly cloying. The coffee, chocolate, and raisin flavors are all present, and they are balanced with a touch of hops. This is a wonderfully drinkable beer, that is good enough to be considered a special-occasion beer."
"Pretty decent drinkability if you are careful!"
"D: Seeing that I didnt like the taste or the mouthfeel, this baby was not exactly asking me to drink more. Its a shame, I was really looking forward to enjoying this one. Heard lots of good reviews. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. Who knows."
"D - It along the BJCP guidelines of a Russian Imperial Stout, but it needs a stronger flavor profile."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very tasty well crafted stout. Very full flavored and balanced creating a satisfying experience."
"Overall a good solid big stout. Has so much more bitterness and stoutyness than its Oaked version. The difference between the 2 is striking."
"Da: High. A pleasure for the die hard stout lover. I very much enjoyed having another bomber of the Yeti. But at 9% ABV I strongly recommed sensible portions."
"D - medium-high a good brew slightly too alcohol flavor for me"
"Most places in this area carry the Oaked Yeti which I intend to try to compare the two. However I found this a just little bit north of RI and jumped at the chance to try it. I've had the Fresh Hop & Hercules Double from Great Divide and wasn't as impressed as most, but I wanted to make sure I sampled the full spectrum of styles for this brewery to make sure my judgment is fair. I definitely think this beer is better in its style those beers are in theirs and I can taste the same signature that I did in the other two. So I guess this beer has salvaged my opinion of Great Divide. Even though I lean more towards beers that I can put away en masse, this was a good beer."
"This beer really shocked me. It tasted just like the Hickory Stick Stout but in a higher alcohol form. Served in a Chimay Chalice. A dark black with a tan colored head. The smell was roasted grain and a bitterness. The taste was very similar to the stout offered by the house. As noted before there was a alcohol presence. Not over the top enough to affect the mouthfeel though. The drinkability is good but you would have to be carefull with this one. It would be easy to over do it. A good beer that I will drink again."
"This is a seriously dark beer, absolutely no light getting through this one. There was a 1"" creamy tan head on top of the black body. The smell was great, very complex, earthy, piney and floral hops with some dark chocolate and roasted malt. The taste starts off bitter, like dark chocolate, then the bitter piney hops, then some plum flavors sweeten it up and it leave a bitter aftertaste. It has a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Very filling so it is a sipper, but that is good, as it warmed up the smells and flavors were amplified."
"Smooth, slick mouthfeel....coats as it goes down. Medium to full bodied...maybe a little too burnt for my taste...so, for me it's probably the type of beer that is limited to one in a sitting."
"A big beer in every way (Roastiness, ABV, and unfortunately price). Certainly deserves the name Yeti!"
"Yeti Came in an amber 1pint, 6 ounce standard bottle. Poured with a real thick dark copper colored small bubble head that rose high and almost looked red as I poured which remained throughout the review, dark on the Lovibond scale. I dont see a date on the bottle but im opening it on 3/21/06. Smells relatively hoppy for a stout. Strong malt flavour coating the mouth with a thin alcoholic flavour profile. No noticeable hop bitterness over the malt profile which is rather deep. Relatively smooth as it goes down, no noticeable alcoholic bite. This is a nice example of an Imperial Stout."
"Without question a marvelous and enjoyable double stout. This beer presents depth, complexity and drinkability in one package. Highly recommended."
"All in all, this could be the best beer I have ever (or will ever) have. Thank you to Great Divide for brewing such an excellent beer!"
"Drinkability: nice drinkability, more than one bottle can be enjoyed in an evening. Must buy this one."
"drinkability - this is way too big a beer to have very much of. it looks smells and tastes amazing, but only in small doses. it is extremely , incredibly sweet."
"Very close to fives across the board."
"pours out black with a nice brown fluffy 1in head that leaves nice lacing and has some nice retention.... Rich coffee and chocolate smells first hit me along with a slight hoppy and fruity scent...A very complex taste...Roasted malts..somewhat hoppy and of course a little bit of an alcohol punch....Very full bodied mouthfeel and definatley a sipper for me ...Bomber was the perfect size don't know if i could of had a couple more and truly enjoyed them...Still a very tasty brew"
"Nice cocklewarmer. Another winner from great divide. Spring is fast approaching here, will soon be too warm for these monsters. Catch em before he retreats to the highground! Can't wait to try the oakaged version"
"Poured a very opaque, yeti-fur black with a thick tan head of about a quarter inch. Spotty lacing was left on the glass as it went down. Smell is a creamy-milky blend of chocolate , light coffee , slight dark fruit and alcohol. Taste is smooth, rich, hearty roasted malt sweetness , bitter chocolate and esspresso , some hop bite , and warming alcohol. Slighty viscous and creamy-chewy mouthfeel. Overall this seems to be a very drinkable Double Stout , im glad i have 1 Pint 6 fl. OZ."
"This beer is fricking Stout Gold!!!"
"drinkability: its syrupy, its got some bitterness, its rich, its loaded with alcohol, but its tasty!"
"Overall a great beer. Drink it up!"
"Normally I am not the biggest on stouts but this one is pretty tasty. Pours with medium to heavy head and good lacing throughout. Colors is a deep black and tan with amber hues. Taste is strong with coffee and roasted malts. Quite bitter but I actually like it and normally doesn't usually equal me liking it. The hops are phenomenal. Also goes down very smooth and is pleasing to the palette from a texture stanpoint."
"All in all, a real winner. Now to decide which I like more... this brew, or its oaky brother =)"
"Yeti is pitch black with a large, light brown head. The body of the head is very thick and creamy. Retention is good, but not as high as expected. Aroma is of very pungent hop atop a very rich malt smell. Chocolate is the most noted of the malt aromas. Taste is similar to the aroma: very rich and very hoppy. A thick, oily hop flavor combines piney and citrussy elements nicely and is first noted in a sip. Bitterness is high. Dark, rich malt flavors soon roll in with flavors of espresso, chocolate, and roast. An overall creamy sweetness is noted as well. Throughout a sip strong hop flavors compete with and usually beat out the malts for domination. The layers of flavor are amazing. Finish is sweet and creamy with a touch of alcohol. This is a big, badass double stout and is easily the hoppiest that I've sampled. Highly recommended!"
"This is a tail-kicking monster of a beer. You will want some more. I know I do."
"beer is very drinkable and very enjoyable on a cold night."
"D: This beer doesn't have any qualities unique from its contemporaries, but is definitely worth trying and perhaps drinking on a regular basis."
"Overall, i think this beer is quite incredible. This beer can be enjoyed right after being bottled, or after time cellared and be great either way (havent tried the aging, but i'm sure it would be). So full and complex, but still so very drinkable. What a great beer! Can't wait to try the oak aged tomorrow...."
"Pours very heavy, dark brown color, and is opaque. It has a nice caramel head that laces nicely. The aroma is very strong, and can be smelled several feet away, strong hop aroma and hints of the dark malt. The taste, the hops just come right up there and attack your tastebuds, folowed by this sweet chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, much like whole milk. This is sipping beer, with big flavor. Sit back and enjoy this one."
"As this beer starts to pour it looks as thick as motor oil, and is very black. Head develops slowly and although it's short it's still remarkable. The foam is a reddish brown/burnt orange color, very dark and inviting. Smells like coffee, chocolate and strong grassy hops. The taste is huge... chocolate, coffee, nuts, both sweet and sour flavors. I'm smiling and puckering at the same time. Good strong hop flavors also. This one is amazingly bitter. This beer feels as thick as whole milk, and is pretty darn chewy. With its rich fullness and intense taste it's like a delicacy so drink it slow and enjoy..."
"No problems consuming the bomber. I think that with some age, this will become even better as the flavors have more time to mesh. I look forward to trying the Oak Aged version."
"Pours a very dark black with a light coffee colored head. The aroma is sweet, smelling of brown sugar, roasted malts, and some coffee, with just a hint of hops. The flavor is rich and malty. Lots of chocolate, some toast, a slight smokiness, and a coffee flavor that lasts into the background. There is a nice piney hop balance. A full, chewy mouthfeel with nice carbonation. This is pretty well balance and hides the alcohol amazingly well."
"This beer is not for the faint of heart - almost too much for me but i still enjoy it."
"Mouth feel is full bodied and mildly carbonated."
"I may get it again just to watch it settle, but the alcohol is not well hidden. 9.5% i'll give it a break, but alcohol... man..."
"Black-as-all-get-up with a light brown head that stays and sticks. Smell is oooh mocha, leafy dirt, and dark chocolate. Real nice. Flavor is a pleasant mix of roast with molasses to stick it together. Thick, low carbonation, clean finish. Pleasant and happy. Great! Piney chocolate perfectly melded. Finish could use a hint more complexity, but the fudginess of this beer is very nice and it is something that I hope to have often."
"This poured a viscous black with faint brown highlights. It had a thin tan head that produced fine lace. Giant maltiness in the aroma, with lots of caramel, molasses, and a bit of roast. Hop character was quite restrained. The bitterness was quite high and there was a lot of grapefruit hop flavour mixed with a bit of pine resin to start. Sweetness kicked in at the mid, followed by a lingering roasted bitterness and lower levels of hop flavour. Full, thick body with a smooth texture and a bit of slickness from the residual sugar. Pretty good balance for such a big beer. Great flavour and aroma. Thanks Zithal!"
"My first Great Divide beer, 22 oz bomber with no date, although I'm assuming 2005 since they just started distributing in MD. Pours an opaque oil black with two fingers of dense brown head, good retention, nice thick lacing---this is one good looking stout. Smell is pretty big floral hops over a nice chocolaty espresso and some brown sugar sweetness. Taste is awesome, a big roasty chocolate caramel coffee burst of dark goodness followed by an explosion of green leafy floral hops. Reminds me of the Black Sun by Three Flloyd's I just had although the hops are less dominating and the wonderful stout flavors come through better. Fulll bodied with a somewhat oily feel due to the hops, this is a fairly easy drinker for it's strength. This is a really suberb double stout, I'm glad I can finally get my hands on it, looking forward to trying the oak-aged one in my fridge."
"Pours midnight black, very opaque, no light getting through this fucker, big tan head forms, some nice lacing. Smell is roast coffee, chocolate, carmael, dates, floral/pine hops, some alcohol. Taste is roasty, with caramel, then chocolate middle, super pine and floral hops, and then a chocolate/coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with low carbonation, very smooth. Good stout but I liked the oak-aged better. This one seems a little unbalanced with the bitterness."
"Aroma was as expected: roasted, coffee, but not very strong. Nice creamy, light-brown head. Excellent lacing and a fully lasting head. Color=black. Initial flavor was moderately sweet with a similar, long finish. Medium to full body with a syrupy texture. There was a heavy alcohol finish. I was a bit underimpressed with this one, as I really love the Oak-Aged version. I think this one needs a year with respect to the alcohol feel."
"From the 22oz bottle this poured a super black with a good size, brownish head. Smells of nuts and alcohol are easily detected. As this beer warmed the alcohol taste and smell increased while there was a good amount of lacing on the pint glass. This is a very good beer and for the price to ounce ratio this is a great beer. I believe I paid around $5.99 for the 22oz and let this sit around for 2-3 months, no freshness or born on date on this one but this had no effect as this was great from start to finish."
"Notes: definitely take this one out of the fridge before opening. once it hits that 50-55F it opens up nicely."
"Yeti Imperial Stout is a hop lover's stout. If you have a low lupulin tolerance or believe that stouts are about malt and malt only, then give this beer a wide berth. If you like over the top beer, beer that is full to bursting with both barley malt and hop flowers, then you owe it to yourself to acquire Yeti by the case. My knees have gone weak at the thought of an oak aged version."
"It should be noted I tried the oak aged Yeti before this brew. Similar characteristics... coffee, molasses, brown sugar all tinge this smooth, resinous feeling brew. Quite drinkable and palatable. Alcohol struts it's stuff once the brew warms. If there is any distinguishable difference it may be that the oak aged Yeti seems to have a bit smoother, mellower character. In my opinion it really doesn't warrant the extra $$ as this brew is quite smooth as is."
"Plenty drinkableÂ… damn likeableÂ… I wish I had more. This is a great Â“everydayÂ” Imperial Stout. I am I that jagged? No. This beer is great but it just isnÂ’t special. No doubt, this is a well-made and tasty beer but I need more to really be impressed. Maybe that is the beer geek in me. I do appreciate this beer. I do like it. I would strongly recommend. I hope I donÂ’t come off as a dickÂ… but I am afraid I do. I really want to drink another bomber, right now! I purchased my bottle in Lawrence, KS. I will get more!"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. It is well balanced--noticeably heavy with the malts but also hoppy with the taste of fruit at the end. Definately would have a bunch of these if they made them in sixers."
"D- This beer has lots of nice dark malt flavors and aromas. It is very smooth and the hops are really nice balance of the not-to-sweet-not-to-dry body."
"Pours a pitch black. Absolutely no light is escaping from this black hole of a beer. Dark tan thick head is slow to form -- overflowed from my glass as I was pouring over my dinner. Laces the glass nicely. Smells of roasted malts and alcohol with some light traces of alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate and coffee up front followed by roasted malt. Some nice oily hopiness rounds it out to complete the taste. Alcohol not as prevelent as I thought it would be, which is a nice surprise. Overall one hell of an Impy Stout. One of the best I've had. Nicely complex and very stout in both character and strength, I highly recommend this one."
"The oak-aged version is smoother, with considerably more depth. This one's a good double stout, but not great."
"It's a subtle brute, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. It's complex, big, bold, brash, and brave, but it never loses it's subtlety. Everything is there for you to taste and experience, should you care to take note, or you can simply sip it slow and bask in its glory. The ABV is a potent creature, and it will lay you open if you let it, but never once does it get out of sync with the rest of the beer. There's no taming this one, but that feral but sublime nature is what makes it as good as it is, so sit back, relax, and immerse yourself. Done cautiously, I would think there could be no regrets."
"Wow. I need to redefine what I consider a black beer. This is BLACK beer. It is black as it moves from bottle to glass. The head is very heavy, short and somewhat mottled, with lighter creamy and cocoa colored spots. It stains the glass like none other. The smell is incredibly complex. Chocolate malt, hops, dark fruits, alcohol, and a few I can't quite put a finger on. The taste is not as heavy as I expected, but still quite weighty. Lots of chocolate flavors up front, some quite bitter hops, a little coffee mixed in with the hop flavors, other malty flavors, floral and herbal hops, and a little rubbing alcohol. It has an extremely complex and long lasting in flavor and aftertaste. The mouth feel is really thick, like somewhere between eggnog, motor oil, and hot cocoa. There is not much carbonation to offset this, but it is not terribly cloying. I do recommend a square or two of chocolate to finish the last third of the bottle, just to give the palate a break. This is surprisingly drinkable, and highly recommended."
"This is an awesome beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I cant go higher than 3.5 here because of the in-your-face- alcohol. Plus, at 9.5%, drinkability is limited no matter HOW good it tastes."
"Tried it side by side Storm King at Mad Mex Robinson. Appears pitch black until held up to the light to show a dark ruby brown tone with a moccha tan head leaves lacing around the snifter it was poured into. Aroma is full of chocolate and coffee tones brought out by the dark roasts along with a boozy fruit brandy esque note and loads of floral hop character. Flavor is big very on chocolate and alcohol especially as it warms the hop bitterness isn't standing out entirely b/c of the massive loads of dark malt flavor here as well, not balanced at all in your face with loads of flavor. Mouthfeel is big and chewy with carbonation producing slow gurgling bubbles. Drinkability: Small snifter of it I would probably not attempt a bomber of this one on my own, but it is damn tasty."
"Overall- Another great well balanced brew from the Great Divide!!! I love this stuff and when i turn to a stout it will be top on my list. note, i at the time of reviewng i had not yet tried the oak aged version,never the less this brew will not leave you disappointed!! Go hunt a Yeti today!!!!"
"Pint ordered at Cole's on Elmwood Ave. in Buffalo. Dark, nearly black with the faintest reddish-brown glow, thin cocoa-colored head. The nose is a bit faint -- roasted espresso, bitter chocolates, pine, caramel. With a big, satisfying mouthfeel, there is a full, bitter chocolate and sprucey hop taste with a nice caramel malt finish. Doughy and chewy. Thick coffee aftertaste. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden. This is very smooth and highly drinkable. Seek it out."
"Overall: Maybe not quite as good as Stone RIS, but very close. Very, very close."
"This is another good beer from Great Divide. I see from their Web site that they've been around since 1994, but they've just started being sold here in Florida. They are really impressing me with their offerings. This is a brewery to watch."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied and chewy at times. The alcohol content is high but it creeps up on you like the Abominible Snow man. This stuff is great and I am looking forward to the Oaked version."
"Drinkability: Great. To easy for 9.5 ABV."
"Wow I thought this beer was categorized as a Imperial Stout but a double stout it is and rightly so,damn good."
"Overall, similar to the oak aged version, but I liked this much better. It was a little more tamed in terms of alcohol and bitterness. One of the best imperials I've had to date. It's still a tad rough around the edges...I bet this would age nicely."
"Cheers mates!"
"Interesting...very interesting."
"A very solid version of the style, meant to be shared due to the high octane abv% and how good it tastes. Congrats to Great Divide for such a nice offering."
"This beer pours an inky black with a dark brown head. The head fades slowly leaving thick laces. This beer has a strong coffee aroma. It also smells like chocolate. I also detect a sweet caramel aroma. Hop aroma is also present. The alcohol content is present in the aroma. This beer has a very strong coffee flavor. Chocolate is also a strong flavor present. It is very malty. I can taste the alcohol clearly. The hop bitterness is also more noticable than in most other Imperial Stouts I have had. This beer has an aggressive flavor. It is a little more carbonated that usual, but it is still very good. It leaves a malty, chocolate like aftertaste. I think that this beer might not be the best session beer because it is high in alcohol, and the taste is very aggressive. I think that this is a great beer, and if I ever get a chance to have it again, I definately will. Thanks mentor for taking care of me again."
"Opinion: This is one rich beer! I think that I prefer this one to StoneÂ’s Imperial Stout because the flavor is more well rounded and palatable. This beer is very bold, but remains drinkableÂ…instead of coming across as a bottle of espresso with a shot of vodka in it. This is a quality beer!"
"Now, the question is, do I spring for the Oak-Aged Yeti to compare the two? Based on how much I enjoyed this tasting, I think I will, so this is a definite two thumbs up in my book."
"I want to try this one in a flight of Imperial Stouts. My initial impression is that this is the best IS I've had. Very nice. Seek this one out."
"This was a gorgeous beer but didn't have both the fantastic viscocity or drinkability as Stone's...which i've come in recent samplings to find as about the best RIS out there. Still, stands by itself as wonderous and I think the oak-aged version could make this one exemplary, especially with slightly toned down alcohol and hop-flavors."
"Pours like liquid obsidian, with a thick brown head that leaves nice lacing. Looks very imposing. Smell is of bitter chocolate, dark cherries and roastiness and a slight whiff of alcohol. Starts with a jab of dark roastiness, then powerful cherry sweetness that melds into bitter, hoppy roastiness lingering on and on. Tremendous flavor, sweet but never cloying and alcohol only shows in the throat warming. Loads of hop bitterness in the finish, it dries out quite nicely, but not exactly in a delicate fashion. Delicious. Mouthfeel is quite full with medium, tongue coating carbonation. Quite drinkable for the strength. It's within me to drain both of my bombers of this..."
"taste: A nice interplay between the hops and sweet malt is the first thing I notice. I really haven't had a beer of this type in which that was pulled of so well. The malt sweetness is very nicely tempered by the hops, but also by the coffee like flavors and astringency. Plenty complex, and really tasty to boot. Slight ethanol presence. Finishes bitterly with some lingering roasted flavors. Glad I can get this one on the regular now."
"The body is medium to full. The carbonation is light as per expected but overall a good tasty brew. I think I would have liked to see more complexity and fruity or plum/raison tastes but still an exceptional beer. A definite recommendation."
"This stuff goes down pretty easy, and it tastes wonderful--it's definitely an American west-coast interpretation of the style with its hop presence (the label brags about the 75 IBUs). I wish the label also mentioned the ABV--22 oz. of this stuff definitely made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside (and charming and witty on the outside). Yum."
"Drinkability: What a great example of the double stout style; this one has it all, particularly on a cold winter night; I have tasted this with some age and tasted it in its youth - with the hops in here it is best consumed while fresh"
" The mouthfeel is highly carbonated for the ABV and style. It is also thick. The drinkability is very good, possibly owing to the 9.5% ABV, which is on the low end of the scale for the style. I have waited far too long to try this super hopped stout. Another winner from Great Divide."
"Next time, I'm getting some espresso beans to go with this. Perfect dessert pairing."
"This beer is awesome! One of the best double stouts I've had in a while. The night I first tasted this, I had three of them. That was a mistake. This stuff will knock your dick in the dirt!"
"Pours a stunning pitch black (i mean no light shining through whatsoever) with a nice thick tan head that stays around as long as you could expect. Aroma is also striking; scents of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, citrus and floral hops, blackstrap molasses, and cocoa. Flavor is intense but balanced: notes of dark chocolate, expresso, vanilla, floral and citrus hops, blackstrap molasses and roasted malt. I have been continually impressed by great divide's ""big beers"" and this is no exception, complex, drinkable and delicious. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth with light carbonation and a big body, alcohol is only noticeable in the finish (and only lightly so). Drinkability is good and the finish is bitter and a bit dry. Extremely tasty double stout, balanced and smooth this is another winner from great divide."
"Hard to put down this beer. On the downside <sic>, too much of this will make you cross-eyed. Pours a dark, dark chocolate brown with a kona brown foamy head. The head tried to recede but never completely vanished. Nose was a hodge-podge of ground coffee beans and chocolate. Great balance to the flavor. Hops rise towards the end and provide a nice evergreen bite. It actually brings out the sweet flavors of the malt even more. Malt has lots of toasted grains and nice coffee bursts. Chocolate milk too. Alcohol started to come out towards the end of hte bottle--otherwise it was nicely hidden. The beer feels like milk in the mouth. Full body that kind of rolls around and clings to the cheeks."
"Opaque black beer with a dense, creamy, dark brown colored head that fades slowly to a thin film that leaves a solid coat of lace. Strong creamy caramel aroma with a pinch of coffee and vanilla. Vanilla and chocolate up front followed quickly by some bitter coffee and strong caramel malt flavors. Towards the finish a dry, dark malt bitterness fades in just before it all ends in a slightly warmer stomach. There is an interesting flavor throughout, kind of an earthy/woody character that really adds another dimension. Soft, smooth mouthfeel that borders on creamy. I've been impressed with the other Great Divide bombers I've had. They're all unique takes on popular styles. The first half of the bottle was a bit disappointing, but as the beer approached room temperature it greatly improved. There were plenty of inviting aromas and flavors that make this a big stout I'll come back to."
"SlÃ inte!"
"Pours like a black coffee and creates a thin burnt sienna colored head and makes a nice spattering of lace on the walls of my goblet. Smell is of deep roasted malts and chocolate. Bittersweet dark chocolate and roasted malts, coffee flavors fill the mouth, strong alcohol and a rather bitter finish. Mouthfeel is exceptional, very smooth and soft carbonation and is not cloying or sticky on the palate, has a relatively dry finish. Yeti is welcome for dinner any time, it stacks up well to the other players in this field of massive American stouts."
"The brew pours an opaque black with a large, creamy dark tan head. It doesn't appear as thick and motor oil like as other big stouts. The aroma is all that you could ask for in a stout. Chocolate, creamy, crackers, butter, alcohol. The taste fills your entire mouth with chocolate. Its not overpowering in any flavor, but rather a bunch of small flavors working in harmony. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy. It is full bodied, but without being thick. Overall, this is a great brew. Its big, flavorful, complex, subtle, and enjoyable."
"As for the non-oaked variety, I will definitely have to get more of this some time, somehow, some way."
"Bomber bottle w/o any freshness indication. Pours jet black, with a dark tan head, and leaving fine, longlasting and scattered lacing. Nose is all about rum soaked raisins, honey rolls and hazelnut-vanilla coffee. Rich, bold, flavorfull brew, loaded with notes of rum, coffee, maple etc, etc. Top quality sipper. 9.5% hid expertly. Wish I had bought two bottles!"
"Bomber obtained from Ace Liquor (Boulder) and consumed the next day. Pours a two finger thick light brown head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of roasted garins, chocolate, alcohol. Burnt chocolate brownies and hardwood bark. Tastes strong roasty and somewhat dry to start and quickly changing to a rich sweet chocolate, coffee caramel toffee. Yum that was *really* good! The aftertaste has a bit of vodka alcohol sting and a rough grassy hop floral that rolls forward. The finish is dry from burnt grains and a forward-rough hop bitter. Thick smooth mouthfeel with moderate-heavy carbonation. I'm left with a feeling that there are miniscule bits of roasted grain hanging on my tongue leaving a persistent dry roasty flavor. A bit less alcohol sting would be nice, as well as quite a bit less carbonation."
"Not incredibly amazing if you ask me, but very, very good. Alcohol presence high for my liking. Obviously not meant to be drank in large quantities. A quality imperial stout - and quite solid. Tasty but not an overachiever...I shall have to sample the ""oak aged"" variety."
"A really nice Imperial Stout. Very thick and satifying with gigantic flavor. This beer could easily take the place of a meal. I would really love this off tap in December."
"Poured opaque black with a nice looking dark tan head and nice lacing on the glass as well. Aroma of burnt malts, chocolate, dark fruits, HOPS, and a little bit of alcohol. More roasted and burnt malts in the flavor, chocolate, java and espresso in the flavor. Dark fruits and hops balance the malts. Alcohol becomes pronounced as this hits room temperature. Very nice... why did it take me so long to discover this brewery?"
"Pours pitch black with a muddy, reddish head. Great retention for a beer this high in alcohol...it just sits..and sits..then sits some more. With every drink, it leaves a shadow of lacing behind. Rich toffee, alcoholic aroma... you can definitely pick up the strong addition of hops, which gives this baby the high IBUs...and all 75 of them show their muscle. Bold, rich flavor, but still slides down the hatch effortlessly. Relatively thick & full mouthfeel..not harsh at all despite being so bitter...silky smooth, really.. A very solid Imperial Stout. Glad I've still got another one stored away."
"Drinkability: The regular Yeti is good, just not quite as good as the Oak Aged Yeti. Its smell and taste are a too sweet upfront; the Oak Aged is mellower. Still, pretty tasty."
"9.5%! Are you kidding me! This one isn't even close to being a sipper. I could, evilly and stupidly, pound this at happy hour and pay the price. Yes, mid west trips will have me picking this baby up again."
"Pours a thick, robust, ink-black viscous fluid topped with a thick tan head that lasts a long time. I think this may become one of my all time favorites. ItÂ’s a bit unusual for its over-the-top hoppiness, but that just adds to its overall complexity. This is a real keeper indeed! IÂ’m going back out to the woods for another . . ."
"I am very impressed with this one although it is unneccessarily hopped for the style. There is plenty going on without it. Still, a very good straight-forward Stout."
"Can't wait to try this again, awsome brew."
"The taste was a wall of chewy toffee and coffee goodness that really masked the alcohol content rather well... the toastiness just kept exploding and my mouth couldnt get enough like a piglet on the teat. I highly reccommend this Imperial Stout that fully lives up to it's name... don't let the Yeti scare you."
"Poured nearly black in color with a thick, frothy dark tan head that refused to fall and left tons of lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, coffee, and hops, but none were all that dominant. The taste profile begins with malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and finishes with a hoppy bite and some alcohol, but nothing sectacular. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy with nice carbonation. The drinkablility of this brew was not quite what I was hoping for. Overall, this was a decent beer, but I probably would not seek it out again."
"Tastes of rich dutch cocoa, and cherry jubilee that has been lit, and re-lit a few times. There's residual alcohol, and it's topped with crinkled dried mint leaves. Great Divides big beers have such creamy mouth appeal. This is impossibly easy to quaff, I just don't get how I can sit here and pound such a large beer. I don't care, GIVE-ME-MORE. Getting slapped by the yeti is a treat."
"I like beers that have a mouthfeel that is full without being too chewy or oily/sticky, and this is one of them. NOT a session beer. Between the abv and complexity, this one should be sipped with respect."
"A great Imperial stout. Or American Double Stout, whatever you want to call it. Dark chocolate, coffee, and alcohol fight for the nose's attention. The taste is more coffee and roasted malts with a sharp hop bite following the chocolate sweetness, with the ever present taste of alcohol. One is enough."
"The only other thing that I would add, which I mentioned at the end of my original review, is that although this style of beer is good for aging, this should be consumed upon purchase. You age a big, dark, malty beer like this to bring out the sugars but the sweets here are so well-developed that there's no need to hold this in a cellar."
"This is how I like my Imperial Stouts. Loud and in charge. At 9.5% it is not hot at all there is a faint whiff of alcohol in the nose and it is meet with the heavy roast, but mostly the smell is muted as the gravity of the liquid lets so little of it escape. The heavy black body and healthly chocolate milk head are a beauty to behold. The first sip is pure cream laced with bits of chocolate and slight citrus fruit all mixed in with the alcohol and blast of malty goodness. This is a smooth whip of a beer and is easily quaffable."
"The flavor is rich, but intensely dark - almost burnt - and awash in alcohol. It's not as wide or rounded as some; but the caramelish malt somehow finds it's way upfront (and appears again in the finish!); followed by a slap of slightly tart dark fruit (oh, those burnt currants again!), chickory, baker's chocolate, and piney/muddy-grass hops. What a ride! It finishes a little less burnt with a dollop of fruit, and a swirl of caramelish malt that slowly fade to reveal lingering mocha java."
"D: I don't particularly find stouts very drinkable, but this is better than most."
"Yeti is another superb beer by Great Divide. Some impy stouts can take a while to get through. Not so here. Yeti has an ease of drinking that verges on being unbelieveable. I'm not a huge fan of impy stouts, but Yeti has won me over."
"A great impy stout. One of my new favorites. I wonder if I would have rated this beer higher if I hadn't recently had a Dark Lord. Yeti actually has many of the Dark Lord flavors, and comes close to the mouthfeel. Think of it as a Dark Lord primer. Try some."
"Mouthfeel is a little slick, not too much carbonation. Moderate drinkability due to the strength and richness, but I seem to be getting through the bomber pretty quickly and wanting another."
"Pours with a one-finger brown head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Totally black color. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts sweeter than their Maverick Imperial Stout, finish is a smooth coffee/chocolate flavor. The high ABV is not noticeable. $6.30 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma"
"The moutfeel is also perfect, what a thick oily stuff. Maybe for some to massive but I loved the brew. Drinkability is fine but cause of the strength not that easy to drink."
" This is a great Imperial in my book. I will definitely look for it again. I can get this with no problem($4.99 and in my area!), unlike many other Imperial Stouts considered to be the best on BA. Not much to choose from down here. Anyway, great beer and I can't wait to crack open the Oak Aged Yeti in my fridge!"
"Impressive looking beer. Deep, deep brown, almost black appearance with a tannic laced head. Heavy chocolate and toffee whiffs along with a pretty serious alcohol parfait. Very hoppy and very bitter, unfortunately they do not balance out the strong coffee and chocolate flavors. Way too heavy of a beer, too strong in the alcohol department, too heavy in the stomach, I am not sure when or what you could eat when drinking this beer. This is a well crafted beer that from its rating definitely has some fans, I'm not one of them."
"Very well done. One of the best. Less cloy than many and I like that."
"Overall, and amazing brew, extremely complex and robust. I will definitely have another!"
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black malt scent that boasts of patent, chocolate, and roasted malts. It is dry and sweet with some toffee notes. The taste is great. It has a dry and bitter black malt flavor that is thick and rich. It goes down smooth and finishes warm. It has a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's full of flavor; a thing of beauty."
"Drinkability - a fantastic beer worthy of the Imperial Stout category. The charred element could be tamer but there's lots of other flavors to enjoy."
"This is definitely an Imperial stout, and should be treated as such. Drinkability gets a lower than desired score because of the bottle size and the high ABV."
"Notes: Very good beer. Superbly drinkable if you like chocolate flavors and smells. Don't miss this one."
"Overall, a good Imperial stout, pretty sraight forward actually, nothing particularly out of the ordinary, but nothing to scoff at either. A fine beer from a damn fine brewery!"
"Comments - Masterful. This is a beer to be purchased and consumed often."
"Very nice big stout. Probably better in colder weather, but still enjoyable on a warm May night."
" What a great Imperial Stout!!!!"
"Impressive looking, but finally under-whelming and overrated in my opinion. The malts are strong, but no match for the incredible overdose of cascade hops. Simplistic, unbalanced, and unsatisfying. The oak-aged version is much more mellow and textured."
"Beautiful, deep, dark color with an almost non-existent deep brown head. Smell is complex, with a strong roast smell. The taste is amazinginly smooth with the roasted barley and chocolate, no real hop flavor detected. This is one of the most full bodied beers I have ever had. Definitely deserves the motor oil comparison that Guiness wrongfully receives. Slight alcohol warmness on the backend. I would love to use this beer in a bbq marinade or in a bbq sauce. This beer is amazing."
"What a beautiful looking beer. I poured from the bottle into a tulip glass a deep brown to black. It was topped by a thick, rich tan colored head that retained nicely, and left a delicate tracing of lace on the side of the glass as it receded. The nose has many layers of character. Light roasted malt comes to the front, followed by black cherry, espresso, and a hint of milk chocolate. On the finish there is just a touch of citrus, and yeast. The flavor was just as complex. The cherry and chocolate come to the front, the hops are a bit more pronounced bringing citrus and a subtle bitterness. The roasted malt and espresso are on the finish in the flavor. The mouth feel is very smooth, full and rich. There is little alcohol in the flavor or feel, and this adds to a high drinakbility. I had the oak-aged version of this a few weeks ago, and normally I prefer the subtleties that oak lends to a beer, but I agree with the earlier reviews. This is a superior beer. The oak seems to mask some of the layers of flavor. Left alone, this beer is a wonderfully complex experience."
"This is the kind of beer that creates desire! Definitely drinkable!"
"Black with just the faintest transmission of burnt sienna highlights at the bottom. Good dark-colored head of foam on the pour, small bubbles and nice duration. Laces in thick sheets, especially on the near side of the glass. Exceptional smell, cream in coffee aromas, French vanilla beans and light cinnamon. Smooth texture, light pin prick carbonation that accents the early onset of the IBUs of the beer. Malts come across as very favorable, coffee and a distinct port-infused tobacco, toffee-like background. Interesting combination of semi sweet chocolate and a more resiny hoppiness than is noticed early shows up in the finish and aftertaste. A very nice beer, not as fruity as some or as oily and hoppy as others -- but an interesting combination of flavors going on here, and many are subtle for the Double Stout style."
"A chewy delight. Appearance is outstanding ....almost black...creamy brown head..extreme lacing. Smell is malt, burnt malt, coffee, chocloate and hops...whew! Taste is slightly below smell, but still well above average...malt then hops and a hoppy finish and aftertaste...not as much coffee and burnt malt tasts as I expected. Nice full, chewy mouthfeel. For 9.5 abv very smooth on the drinkability scale."
"Finger licking good!"
"A newcomer to ATL and a welcome one. A fantastic imperial stout that takes no prisoners."
"The finish on this beauty is fantastic. Crazy hops and lingering coffe bean bitterness with a touch of lip smacking and creamy malt."
"Deep, opaque black with a fluffy, thick cocoa head. Poured like motor oil. So far, so good. Smelled purely of milk chocolate. Some raisins and spicy notes in there but mainly, chocolate. Yum. Taste was again, very chocolately, like drinking chocolate syrup and then chewing through a block of unsweetened, bitter chocolate. Nicely spicy in the middle. Finish was nicely bitter and drying. Also lots of fruitiness. Not a lot of the harsh burnt character one might expect. Malts seem to be roasted to perfection. Right off the bat, the higher ABV is felt on the insides. Mouth was big but not as syrupy as one might expect from its appearance. Tons of tiny bubbles make it really chewy. It's a mouthfulÂ–and a delicious one at that."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out black with a dark brown head. Very thick looking in the pour. Rich chocolate and caramel aroma with some fresh hops in the background. Big malty flavor with chocolate and caramel. Roasted flavors. Hoppier than most Imperial Stouts, but not so much as to deviate from the style. Full mouthfeel. This is a great beer, and a good example of the style."
"Poured nearly opaque black with a nice and thick chocolate milk colored head on top. Very inviting and just what I wanted to see when I poured this one. Smell is mainly slightly sweet with malts and with some vinous aspects which add to the slight sweetness. The background is of coffee with light hints of chocolate. Could be a bit more powerful in the aroma department, but good none the less. MmmÂ…the taste is quite amazing and very complex. Initially there is a toasted malt flavor which quickly transitions over to a mild chocolate and finishes with a coffee aftertaste. This flavor profile covers all that I expect in an impy stout. Mouthfeel is full but not as creamy thick as other impy stouts IÂ’ve had. Drinkability is good as well, but the slight biting effects of alcohol in this one brings it down a bit."
"I highly recommend this rich beverage."
"It pours a nice black beer with a dark head. Can't see light with this one.I got some lace going on, the head is down to a thin line. A nice chocolate raisin taste to it that ends with a good bite of hops. Very good beer. If you like a big Imperial Stout, this is a good one."
"pours a thick opaque black, pours like a thin used motor oil. A dark brown head is apparent on this one. Smells of bitter grassy hops, burnt grains and chocolate and finally solvent like alcohol. Taste is very much of black charred malts. Bitterness from these malts shows through quite a bit. taste is almost chalky thick. A hop bitterness lingers near the end. Alcohol is not as aparent in the taste as it is in the nose. Mouthfeel is thick and ideal for a bit stout like this one. A good stout, reminds me of some others."
"Came in a brown 22 oz. bomber, and looked dark brown/black with a creamy brown head when it graced the tulip. Aromatically, a very chocolaty brew, with some prunes and piney hops thrown in. Taste was drier than the aroma suggested. Peppery, roasty, nutty mid palate, slightly hot alcoholic finish, and a lingering vinous bitter aftertaste. The citric hops were more evident than typical for the style. Body was chewy and stiff, and the myriad of flavors felt a bit disjointed. This is pretty good now, but likely will become most exceptional after some additional aging in my opinion. Will have to stop by the store again soon to pick up some for the cellar."
"If someone were to ask me what an American Double Stout tastes like, I would point them to the direction of this beer. I love the pour. Deep dark dankness with a large cappachino like frothy head that holds nicely. Tons of lacing. Looks like a meal! Aroma is strong on the roasted tones and sharp tingly hops. Mildly citric after it's all said and done. Taste brings about more of these intense flavors. A super strong roasted black strap molasses flavor off the bat. Unsweetened chocolate comes next. A shot of espresso hits me in the middle. The hops are there the whole time but a huge hop strike gets me after the espresso. Very piney and somewhat bittering. Finish has a dry grainy bitterness to it and then chocolate coats the mouth. Lingers nicely. Quite a sipper with all the intensity. Well worth the price. A great example of the American Double Stout style!"
"An outstanding Impy Stout from the Great Divide."
"Say hello to my little friend. A very dark brown in color with a well defined 1/3 inch tan bubbly head. The nose is first of hops, letÂ’s get that clear; this is inviting; some chocolate and alcohol are also detected in the aroma. Lip smacking offerings Â– dark roasted coffee, some vanilla beans and some tender/bitter hops. Oh so tasty; alcohol offerings are right there in the body combined with intense grape and plum flavorings. Warming only intensifies this rich stout. An absolutely incredible and cleansing palate for the style. Very stiff; roasted malts round out the body. Full bodied and full of flavor; one of the top Imperial Stouts; search out this bad boy and enjoy!"
"Good double/imperial stout (I'm not sure what the difference is). Pours an extrodinary deep black color, decent head to start, but it receeds quickly. Aroma is of straight up black patent roasted malt. Taste is similar to aroma, mostly the roasted burnt flavor of roasted malt coming into play, with a bit of an alcohol hit. Mouthfeel is a good bit thin and overcarbonated for a double/imperial stout. Not a bad one, but not a bit one dimensional on the roasty flavors for me."
"Drinkable, and it had better be coming in this 22oz bomber, but a little cloying and salty towards the end."
"This was an excellent example of the style. My cousin and fellow BA, Brent, got this one for me and I must say thanks. I'm quickly becoming a fan of the Great Divide Brewing Company."
"22ozÂ’s of Imperial StoutÂ…itÂ’s a beautiful thang. Pouring out into my goblet it leaves the bottle with viscous reluctance. The body is dead black, impenetrable, etc. thin brown head emerges and then recedes to a thin ring about the edge of the glass and a greasy cap. The nose is ripe with damp, dark berry esters, charred malt, coffee and bitter chocolate. Berries and bitter chocolate up front on my palate, all the great flavors of a good Imperial Stout are here espresso, charred malt. One thing that set this apart from other Imp Stouts to me though is the fresh green hop presence, almost immediately I started tasting citrus/pine hop flavors and they just became more prevalent into the finish. Bravo!, this may be the hoppiest stout IÂ’ve had to date. The mouthfeel is a tad lacking, not too shabby anyway. That charred bitter/hoppy aftertaste is mind-blowing though, I have to get more of this!"
"Pours jet black with a large dark tan 1Â” head. Smell is dominated by alcohol, with strong hops present, makes sense, with a listed IBU level of 75. Smell does not have as much of a coffee presence as most stouts. Taste is not for the rookie or the faint of heart. Booming flavors of coffee and alcohol immediately greet you, and then finishes with a titanic portion of hops. The 3 huge flavors balance each other out and make this a true sipper for both the hophead and the stout fiend. Excellent and very drinkable for the high IBU and ABV."
"Pours to a deep dark brown with just a ring of light brown for head. It leaves spotty lacing. The aroma is malty and roasty, coffee and chocolate-like. Kinda chocolate cake-like in aroma. The flavor is malty and very roasty with a coffee and slighty chocolate taste. This is a full bodied brew that kicks ass over storm queen & expedition. I really wanna try this one oak aged. I'm glad I had the opportunity to present StuBob with such a great beer...even though he is unworthy....he can be a real bitch don't ya know."
"Wow. Huge espresso and cocoa aroma with a thick tan head that leaves lacing down the sides of my glass. I think, ""oh boy, oh boy, is this going to be a good stout."" I'm correct in my thinking. Big, intense chocolate-cocoa flavors give way to some biting hops and black coffee bitterness, before a chocolate liqeur-like finish coated with a biting bitterness from hops. This stout is intense! A bit tartness in the finish, which seems to get drier the more I drink -- is this tannins? Reminds me of the flourless chocolate tart I had for dessert yesterday. A thick and chewy stout; finally something worthy of tonight's sub zero weather."
"Deep black in color with a very nice tight tan head. Just a beautiful beer, it really is. Nice roasted aroma-coffee and vanilla note. Big roasted malt flavor-not overly done either. Port like flavors. Oakey,raisens,vanilla and chocolate all meld into a heavenly mix. Great ""inky"" mouthfeel-silky smooth. I could drink this stuff all night. Has to be one of the top 3 or 4 imperials I think I have ever had. Get some."
"Egad, I could not get enough of this beer. 100% opaque, onyx black with a bubbly chocolate head. Sweet smoky chocolate coffee roast flavor, with a light milky sourness. It's as thick as a mouthful of maple syrup, you've got to love a heavy beer to drink this stuff. Could you guess it was malty? Very, very malty. But in a good way. A great way. A holy-crap-I-just-bought-out-the-bar way. I love 9%-plus beers that come in alluring 22oz bottles. Might be a good idea tape a car service's number to the bottle."
"Drinkability: Bring 'em on!!! Only I have to be at work at 7:30 tomorrow morning.... no that's not the point. I'll finish this bottle quite happily and stumble off to bed and have very pleasant dreams but to have any more than that would be asking for trouble. Meaning.... this beer is tasty!!!! and it's kicking my butt!!!! So I'll finish it and wish for more and go to bed. G'nite!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big-bubbled (in places), uneven 1/4"" dark brown head over the black brew. What head there is stays as is, but no lacing at all. Aroma is of sweet, dark malts and alcohol. Flavor is similar to the nose, but the coffee flavor is more pronounced. Mouthfeel is okay, but the bitterness is somewhat off-putting, and I wish there was some semblence of carbonation happening here. Drinkability is limited by same. Ok stout, but had higher hopes..."
" A great Stout."
" Drinkability is good a nice double stout hop heads will rejoice. While I do love hops thought this was a little lacking in the roasted barley character that it needed to be a great double but then again that could be just me. Hell worth buying just to look at."
"Drinkability/notes: Rich and pleasant, very drinkable, extreme, but nonetheless, excellent, but best taken in small servings. I find it difficult to imagine drinking a bomber of this by myself."
"One hell of an Imperial Stout and up there with Expedition in my mind. Great beer."
"In the end, it left a great big impression on the wrong side of the love it/hate it side of the fence...so sorry this one didn't make it. I had such high hopes!"
"This is certainly enjoyable, and I am quite glad that the beer is quite a bit more flavorable than the aroma suggests, perhaps my schnozz is not working quite as well as it should be."
"Pours with a gooey, burnt sienna head of small, tight bubbles that clumps and laces nicely. Beer is black (duh) with typical Imperial Stout viscosity. Smells strongly of grapefruit and asphalt from the bottle alone. From the glass: very strong, grapefruity hops; sappy pine cones and tar. Finishes like gin (?) as in juniper... and baking chocolate with... yuck, an ammonia-like chemical bite. The biggest problem with the smell, though, is the same as with the flavor--the burning. Initial sips suggest a burnt raisiny sweetness, before being pummeled away by raw grapefruit and carbon. I'm not talking tasty burnt toast/popcorn or the charred fruit tastes of a good Imperial Stout; this is like sucking on a stick of charcoal, or at best, a 50/50 shot of espresso and unsweetened grapefruit juice. Sound good? Aftertaste suggests chocolate-covered coffee beans... why couldn't this have been the flavor of the beer while I was actually drinking it?? Mouthfeel is heavy, sticky, and tingling from bitterness alone; not what you'd call smooth. If a beer's to be ""drinkable"" it needs to be balanced first, folks. I admit I came in with high expectations for this beer, but for me at least, this is a huge disappointment."
"This is an outstanding Imperial Stout, very warming on a cold fall night/early morning. I think this beer and I are going to get to know each other much better as the weather grows colder."
"Beer is good. Happy RIS beering."
"THe drinking commences and reveals a thick body and smooth creamy texture. the carbonation is gentle and rolls over my palate. Flavor is roasty almost to the point of smokiness, some espresso notes and a bit of crispy piney hops come through as well. The finish is briefly chocolate sweet and then finishes coffee bitter. A very tasty beer and robust and complex as well. I enjoyed this oak aged on draft at the brewery as well, but that was so many beers in already. Definitely buy this one if you are in Denver."
"The one leaves the bottle, looking a bit like morot oil being poured, as it was so black and so thick. The head is 2 fingers that falls to a quarter inch, and it is a really dark tan...the darkest head I have ever seen on a beer. The nose is a lot of fig initially, with dark chocolate covered espresso beans coming through. The flavor is really interesting. The initial taste is a blast of dark fruits with a lot of alcohol in there. This moves to a really potent bitter coffee, finishing with a sweet and bitter dancing on my tongue. The finish is almos a bit much for me. Really complex in my opinion. The feel is thick and syrupy, totally coating my mouth. can't get much better than that. The drinkability is okay. Its a little much for me to handle on my own. I sure wish my friends were here to share this."
"Pours thick and pitch black like opening a can of oil. Nose is similar to that of rich coffee with undertones of vanilla extract and smoked hickory wood. Full-bodied and heavy in the mouth throughout the tasting. Roasted caramelized malt flavors are present up front along with flavors of unsweetened chocolate followed by notes of smoky charcoal and bitter grapefruity raw hop leaves leading to a rather dry finish. The high alcohol level is very well hidden. Unfortunately, we donÂ’t have many imperial stouts available here, but this one is a definite winner."
"Everything about this beer is over the top, and I like it that way. An absolutely stunning beer - thick, syrupy and black, with a big well retaining deep dark brown top. Aroma is reminiscent of Storm King, huge roasted malt notes with a wallop of hops, chocolate, and booze. Comparing it to Storm King, I think this leans more towards the roastier malts while the King has a hoppier flavor profile. This is equally impressive, and somehow has a stronger, richer, more bitter flavor (though not necessarily better...I love hops!). Mouthfeel is oil slick with just the slightest inkling of carbonation. Finishes bitter and extremely roasty. Gonna get me some more of this puppy for the cold months, it's a warmer for sure, and one that deserves a spot very close to the top of my Imperial Stout heap."
"Without question, this will be a repeat buy."
"I shall hunt the Yeti again...and soon."
"22 oz bomber. A dark, nearly opaque black colour with blood red edges, and a big frothy head of espresso. The aromas are of espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, alcohol, piney hops, and more. This smells like an excellent American Double Stout should! The taste follows suit with some amazing, roasted flavors up front, some piney hops in the middle, and a lovely finish of dark, bitter chocolate and minutely sweetened espresso. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the drinkability is absolutely fabulous. Great Divide is one hell of a brewery."
"At $4.99 this will make the rotation once in a while, like when Rasputin is not available."
"Nicely black body with a small head. Surprisingly hoppy in the aroma and the flavor, especially for such an opaque stout. Nicely bitter, but the malt isnÂ’t really doing it for me. It seems to take a back seat to the hops and in an Imperial stout, it really should be the other way around. ItÂ’s got all the prerequisites for the malt profile (dark, roasty/burnt flavors), but itÂ’s not even approaching rich. Still a tasty beer despite my qualms with it."
"Edit: Drinkability is going down. It's roasty flaovrs are almost too much to handle, especially when a bomber is involved. Still a killer stout, just can't drink as much of it as I'd like."
"Beautiful dark and guinesslike appearance, with a great chocolate/medium brown head that quickly reduced down to a thin ring. Amazing scents of a sherry/port... warm and oaky... maltiness in the background. Medium mouthfeel, not too heavy, just right. Dark and lovely flavors, and freakin yummy! Black coffee, chocolate malts, oaky whiskey, bit of vanilla... Easy drinking for us stout lovers! Very good overall!"
"Dark jet-black color, has a great tightly bubbled, brown head that leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Roasted chocolate, coffee and dark fruit aromas, sweet fruity plum-chocolate and coffee flavors. Nice burnt bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body with creamy and smooth, oily mouthfeel, alcohol somewhat shows as it warms, beautiful."
"Drinkability and overall: Drinkability suffers some just because this is a punch in the face, kick you to the curb kind of beer. Definitely one of my favorite stouts but this is to be sipped and savored for sure. A ""must have"" for all stout lovers."
"Bigfoot my arse, try the Yeti!!"
"Taste follows the smell as expected. What is not expected is that it is surprisingly light-bodied. Syrupy, yes, and sticky in my mouth; but not thick at all. I taste bittersweet chocolate and caramel, and it is quite hoppy at the finish. Lingers for quite some time, with a mouth-puckering bitterness. I would give this a 4 to 4.5 on drinkability but only if you truly appreciate this style; a 3.5 at best if you don't (which I guess applies to most styles of beer). My conclusion is: very good example of an imperial stout. I appreciate it a great deal. But make sure you like imperial stouts or of course you won't like this."
"22 ounce bottle. Label says Maverick Imperial Stout, but read like Yeti on the website."
"Interesting, but a little over the top."
"I may have found heaven."
"Pure, opaque black in color. Rocky, pitted deep bister head leaves muddled, tattered lace. Beautiful. Suggestions of rum splashed grapefruit along with rich, milk chocolate coated crushed coffee bean upfront in aroma. Swirling releases stately wafts of anise and fermented prune. Incipient in flavor is an agreeably brash suggestion of bitter espresso and quinine, softened only slightly by a backdrop of sweet fudge. Bitterness subsides promptly though, allowing notes of chocolate covered candied orange peel and dark toffee to arise and provide contrast. Becomes more raisin like in fruit character as it breathes, with orange hints fleeting. Underbaked gooey brownie hints surface as well, but sweetness never becomes overbearing, as it held in check by stalwart bitterness, both roasted barley and hop derived. Moderate in body, but aptly dextrinous to support the malt profile. Thins a bit late, with light mocha hints supplanting the fudge presence. Finishes with transient snap of black currant yielding to lingering bitter and smokey roasted grains. A delicious imperial with a tingling, firm bitterness offset by an enveloping, velvety cocoa tone. This could age incredibly, but I'd never have the willpower. Thanks to Bighuge for sending fine brew."
"That's the darkest brown head I've ever seen. Small pocks in the muffin dough. The beer is a thick, thick, black tar: no color, no highlights. Nose is sweet, bready, roasty with tons of rich chocolate. Bitter chocolate in the front gives way to a syrupy, alco-choco-rich middle. Finishes bitter with hops and more bitter chocolate. Turns really tangy well above 70F. Nice. Smoky alcohol aftertaste has some veggie. This is a strong, rich, bitter, chocolatey alcoholic brew. It could be a little roastier and creamier for my taste."
"Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, smooth and silky, as to be expected for the style. Very little to no trace of alcohol in the taste which, despite its heft, makes it frighteningly drinkable. This one rates a definite ""Wow," especially from an otherwise unremarkable regional brewer."
"This cryptozoological stout pours like mid-viscosity tar, with burnt sienna edges and a surprisingly large, thick dark brown head. A thing of beauty that reminds me of Expedition. Smells of slightly smoked whiskeyish malts, dollops of ripened raisin pudding, alcohol-infused plums, and a bitter hop edge. The taste is WOW. Very big sweetened fruit, with roasty, burned edges. Meaty, whiskeyish alcohol edge. But then a wave of hops knocks all that out of the yeti cage. Hops are big and the bitterness is lasting, well into the finish that still manages to sport some residual syrupy sweet roastiness. Big mouthfeel, but not too cloying. A great big stout that makes me believe that yetis and sasquatch are not only real, but great brewers as well."
"Altogether way too easy to drink - good lord did I destroy that bomber faster than I could remember. A definite re-buy; no, the definition of a beer you buy again. And again. All I can think is balance: juicy hops, big roast, bigger dark malts, and enough ineffable edges. Almost made me forget about Brooklyn Black Chocolate, its that kind of wonderful balanced big boy beer."
"Overall Impression: Outstanding! The subtle Bigfoot analogy holds true: big hops, rock solid malt base, stunning alcohol, no noted flaws. Drinkability? This is TOO drinkable. Great Divide went big, and it paid off! This is a very enjoyable beer. I think itÂ’s a bit hoppy for the style (erm, which style, what format), but itÂ’s hard to argue with the results. Strongly recommended, but in small glasses with several friends."
"Heavenly nice! I'm alooped with glee and becoming warm with love of great beer as I continue to sip this delightful brew. Cheers eh!"
"Sample was a bit old - 2003 ""Maverick"" series, sampled in 2004, but, happily and to my surpise, no oxidation. Poured black - pick your descriptive term - pitch black, coal black, inky, any would apply. Slight mocha head that quickly faded. Gentle aroma of chocolate. Bold flavored with chocolate, coffee, roasted and almost burned grain, and an unusual, slightly salty hint of something both caramel and almost soy sauce, but not at all disconcerting. Beefy abv lent a touch of spicyness that toned down after the tongue numbed a bit. This beer is subtile, like a velvet-wrapped hammer."
"The beer after disemboguing the 22 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a pitch-black with a moderate and creamy chocolate brown head, the lace formed is a thick and glutinous blanket to conceal the glass from view. Â“Ah That SmellÂ”, that only a big bad boy Imperial Stout gives you, heavy aroma of coffee, burnt grains, bitter-sweet chocolate, all supported by a pleasant sweetness, also a nice bit of hop floral spiciness to seal off this treat to both the ocular and olfactory senses, start is sweet, thick with malted grain, the top is rich and full bodied,. Finish is dynamic in its hop spiciness, the acidity moderate and the rich chocolate and coffee flavors continue to the very dry and alcohol bitter end, the 9.5 percent ABV, leaves a warm trail right along to the bottom of the tummy. What a majestic beer, quite reminiscent of Â“Dark LordÂ”."
"This came in a 22oz Bomber with and old western looking label to go with the Maverick theme. Pours a rich black color with a good sized tan foamy head about half an inch high. Not good retention as it quickly faded and there was not much lacing or signs of its existence afterwards. The aroma is of dark chocolate and espresso coffee with a slight hint of hops. There are also notes of dark fruit that seemed to emerge as I drank this. Very similar in taste to the aroma as the chocolate and coffee flavors dominate. The chocolate is a bittersweet one with and there are also notes of roasted malts. The hops are present but not too bitter and there are no signs of the alcohol. About a medium body on this beer with fairly good drinkability. This is a very smooth and complex imperial stout and is highly recommended."
"At 9.5%, one was enough for a nice night sleep."
"like the bottle."
"Thoroughly unimpressed. One-dimensional charcoal, with no complexity and riddled with off-flavors and problems. Pass on this one. I've had much worse, but this just isn't what Imperial Stouts are about."
"Cokes, thanks for the Maverick, cowboy."
"Excellent, imperial stout here, even without the coffee notes. This goes down incredibly smooth, with the smoked almond chocolate bar flavor providing a unique, and highly enjoyable result. The dark fruits and anise add even more beguiling character to this excellent stout. Very well crafted, and highly recommended by this reviewer."
"22oz Bottle no Date.This bad boy poured black and as opaque as could be. Leaves a huge dark bown head that lingers for a long while. An impressive looking stout for sure. The aroma is quite hoppy for the style and blends well with its notes of sweet roasty chocolatey decadence. Some licorice is also present yet faint. The body is full and smooth and everything you expect in this style. Very creamy with just enough carbonation to keep it in check. The flavor is a chocolatey espresso treat. The licorice detected in the aroma is even more subtle in the flavor. This all adds up to a winner in my opinion. Overall an excellent Imperial and probably equal to or possibly better than my other favorite from Left Hand, another Colorado gem."
"697"
"This came in a 22oz bomber and was the 2003 version. Pours a very dark color with a nice full head and leaves a huge amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly comprised of a coffee smell with some notes of rum(?) and possibly a little chocolate. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. Coffee feel with some chocolate and very thick. Not a bad Imperial Stout at all."
"2003 Bottle: This Imperial pours a thick syrupy black with a dark brown head. Nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma consists of coffee, caramel and hops. Rich bodied and overly bitter for my tastes. The label boasts of the hoppiness of this beer at 75 IBUs, and it threw off the balance of it in my estimation. I learned that while I like hoppy beers I do not like hoppy Imperial Stouts. The bitterness overpowers the malt, roasted coffee and chocolate flavors that would otherwise make this more enjoyable. The finish remains bitter with hops and coffee. Overall this beer would be much better if the the scales were not tipped so far on the bitter side. The one saving grace is that by the time it really, really warmed the balance was noticeably better."
"Vast, ne'er ending thanks to prAna!"
"Black body with a very dark brown head that sticks like a rolemodel. Quite hoppy aroma comparable to a storm king with a deep maltiness of milk chocolate and light coffee notes. Taste is immensely balanced with a touch of everything required in a good imperial stout. Initially mild chocolate to start up and quickly fades into a very dry roastiness, hoppy finish. Body is thick, ultra-creamy, pretty carbonated. Very neat imperial with a stupendous balance and as much flavor as it should contain."
"Thanks to joegough22 for this beauty"
"2003 Bomber Bottle: This one poured an almost black color, even a bit oily. Some dark tan head to it. The nose is sweet, with hints of chocolate and toffee. This is a full bodied beer. A suprising lack of roastiness to the taste. Subtle taste of chocolate, and some hidden fruitiness. A hint sweet, with hops hiding in the background. The alcohol is well hidden. A delicious brew."
"Overall, this is a great stout. Find this one if you can."
"2003 edition. Eclipse black color. Large tannish head. Aroma is coffee and chocolate, hops and dark fruit. A full-bodied Imperial Stout. Malts are very roasty, with a pronounced chocolate and coffee flavor. Hops are grapefruity, herbal and piney and very pronounced for an imperial stout. Extremely smooth and creamy tasting. A slight touch of an alcohol bite at 9.5%. Hints of vanilla and dark fruit. A very nice, very drinkable Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"The flavor is big, what you would expect from an Imperial Stout but much more. Nice Roasted Malt flavor up front, then caramel, toffee and then a huge roasted coffee aftertaste which lingers on the palate. OHHH, What a beautiful beer. My only complaint and yes I always seem to have one is that it isn't that big up front. Still awesome though and a beer I will definately be revisiting soon."
"I picked this one up on a lark on a trip to Columbus, and I'm certainly glad I did. A fantastic Imperial Stout, and a nice little treat from a brewery that I've sadly never heard of before, but will be looking for in the future!"
"Although this beer shows signs of much oxidation, and it's a 2003 reviewed in 2003, it's still quite good."
"When poured, the head was small, light brown with fine-large sized bubbles that completely diminished. The body of this beer was opaque and uncarbonated with a black hue. The nose was that of chocolate and roasted coffee with a chocolate and coffee taste to it. The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied. This beer had a fair amount of lacing to it."
"Really somethign to behold. So viscous and rich in color that it temporarily stains the side of the glass with brown liquid that just clings...and clings...and clings. Pretty damn drinkable for 9.5% -- but after this warms a bit, it's a little more noticeable (especially in the nose). Well crafted."
"Notes: Without a doubt a tasty brew, tame but I like it that way. The alcohol sneaks up on you and there are so many subtle complexities to deal with that it makes it so worth the while."
"Taste was a myriad of thick creamy smooth German chocolate cake, roasted bitter expresso bite.Also a nice hop bite. Roasted expresso bitterness snaps you the other way, and leaves your head spinning. Then a nice supersmooth underneath of alcohol that doesn't surprise you, but walks, like a supermodel with a smile, and wraps you in a blanket. Finish is smooth but yields a subtle undertone of rum soaked cherries, plums, and roasted fruits. Bitterness is a constant reminder of the need for more of this sooner rather than later. Very impressive stout, one to remember for a while, it's really the only one I remember from our recent Imperial Stout tasting session. Compliments of the BelgianBum from his recent trip to Colorado."
"Flavor: It's rich and very silky on the tongue. It's a very nicely done imperial stout."
"Wow, this beer poured an amazing pitch black color and formed a nice huge foamy dark head that stuck around and left me thinking of some decedant float experiment gone wrong. It finally decided to diminish, leaving a lactice of lace etched on the side of the glass. The aroma was malt, coffee, chocolate and a touch of raisin. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate with a body a touch light for this style. The finish was of burnt chocolate. A fine stout from Great Divide."
"First word that I can think of to describe this imperial stout is black. From the 22-ounce bomber pours an inky, jet black liquid with a vibrant brown head. After a minute or so, the head dissipates to a small ring, leaving trails of lace down my chalice. Very impressive appearance. The nose features an array of scents, notably freshly ground espresso, road tar, roasted malt, tobacco, and minor bittering hops. Once again, quite impressive. The taste department delivers a variety of flavors. Roasted malt, fresh coffee beans, cocoa, and almost citric hops appear at first. As the beer settles for a while, a caramel/toffee flavor becomes evident, and it's very nicely done. The IBUs and alcohol come through on the finish, which is distinctively hoppy and warming in a good way. This is one viscous brew. Mouthfeel is incredibly oily and silky smooth. This is definitely an aggressive imperial stout, but it drinks very well, especially for its 9.5% abv. Overall, a great imperial stout. Drink this while you can, as this is a limited run. Best beer I've tried from Great Divide, hands down."
"And it assures you that this is as good as it gets."
