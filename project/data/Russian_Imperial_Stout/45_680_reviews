"I kept going back and forth between ""wow, cool chocolate notes"" and ""meh, this is okay"" while drinking this beer. Not quite sure why, but it just didn't jive with me."
"one of the better chocolate stouts I've tried, and a must try if you like deep complex chocolate or imperial stouts."
"Had this recommended by a friend and boy does it not disappoint! So thick and full of flavour. One of my favorite stout's."
""
""
""

""

"It tastes, smells and looks very nice. The only downside with this imperial stout is that it's a bit to boozy for me."
""

"This is a decent beer. The chocolate taste is nice. I would have liked a more complex smell and taste. And perhaps a tiny bit more carbonation. Otherwise, a good Russian Imperial Stout."
"Pours a perfect black with a light brown/dark khaki head. 1 finger, some lacing. The nose is dark chocolate. Not pure cocoa but rather strong 75-80% dark chocolate because there is a sweetness in there. Some coffee notes but I can only really describe that as a Vienna roasted burnt coffee. It tastes very assertive at first but really smooths out as you go. At first it seemed a bit boozy but I was drinking it a bit too cold. As it warmed the complexity of this beer really came out. Creamy mouthfeel, perfect gentle carbonation. Finishes a bit sweet and malty and not roasted and bitter enough for my taste of Russian imperial stouts. This was a very good beer and it has some potency too at 10% abv."

"Lace: 140 plus SHV factor, creamy, chewable, delightful depth, strong Cocoa and espresso infusion, lack of turpid creates a wonderful dark beauty, pure Russian poetry in a glass."

"The nose is cocoa, chocolate with faint espresso but not a lot of roast. Pours very dark brown to black under a vigorous, finely bubbled, persistent, lacy light tan cap. The palate has chocolate flavors from the malts blending with the added chocolate flavors over a variety of grain flavors and hints of caramel. It finishes with lingering bittersweet chocolate flavors. Very well balanced. The texture is very creamy, close to a nitro beer and is very full bodied to chewy. The carbonation is very fine and soft."
"Pours pitch black with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is decent.  Dark chocolate, licorice and slight coffee aroma.  Maltiness is more light bodied with a stronger black licorice taste.   You can detect some dark chocolate smoothness.  Hints of coffee at the end.  Not much of a roasted taste, which I come to expect from Imperial stouts.  A little too much licorice for my taste as well.  It does hide the alcohol very well.  Probably could have used some more aging to bring out the chocolate taste better."

"Overall: This is one of my favorite stouts. High ABV with a prefect pairing of chocolate and coffee. A lot of times these double stouts or high ABV stouts have a sickly sweet taste and aftertaste that prevails. This one avoids that brewing mistake and gives you what you want from a stout...something to get through the frigid cold of winter. I highly recommend this brew!"
""
""
"Excellent alcohol bite.  A slightly lingering bitter aftertaste."
"Dark pour with thin short lasting head. Roasted malt nose and dark chocolate. Sweet bitter taste. For a beginning beer drinker, this is kind of strong. A little chocolate, a lot of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into stout snifter. Dark brown to black with a tan head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, and alcohol. Taste is slightly sweet to start with dark chocolate and vanilla flavors then switches to moderately bitter featuring coffee roasted malts, and anise. Alcohol is not masked. Medium body, creamy texture, medium-light carbonation, long bitter roasty finish with warming from the alcohol."

"O: A chocolate forward, creamy stout that paired great with a big piece of german chocolate cake."
"39/50"
"Good stout .....lots of coffee"
""
"O: this is a great stout even if u do not like stouts this is a must try 10% of pure  happiness"
""
""
""
""
""
"An amazing stout indeed. Super fragrant and tasty, dark chocolate and coffee play between a wonderful roasted malt backdrop. Plenty of alcohol warmth and a sweet, fudge finish make this simply wonderful. Super creamy, full body. One of the best stouts, and best values, available today."
""
""
"Fantastic beer to have on a Friday night listening to jazz"
""
"this is a good beer"
""
"An outstanding stout indeed, although I certainly notice an inconsistency with the strength of the chocolate flavor from bottle to bottle. However, putting any imperfections aside, it's still a highly drinkable 10% ABV beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very complete imperial stout, with a complex palate and a fine presentation. In the end, it may be a bit on the sweet side for my taste and the alcohol is more apparent than with some stouts of this strength. Overall, though, a really fine brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: I think I have a new favourite stout - for me, this one ticks all the boxes although some might find it a bit too bitter and astringent. Me? I think it's fantastic - just a pity it's harder to get than my other favourite (Sam Smiths Imperial Stout). If you see this, try it - it's great in a bottle, I'd love to try it on tap."
"Like a barrel of stout was condensed into one bottle"

"A very dark stout.  You can smell the malt before the first sip.  Overall a good sipping beer."
"Very smooth and easy drinking RIS. 10% barely noticeable. Chocolate tasty but not overwhelming.  If you're into this style give this one a try you won't be disappointed."
""
"It's a very delicious stout, and given the price, it's more than well worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at pint room, carmel. Not a true 90 beer..."
"Varied per bottle. I've loved it and hated it. Need better quality control.  Don't know that it is worth the risk."
""
""
"Brooklyn's Chocolate Stout is rich in a way you'd expect to to be, but smooth and understated in a way you wouldn't. The best way I can describe it is ""it's just good."" Do yourself a favor and try it if you haven't."
""
""
"Overall- This is a Winter sipping treat. Well done from all ends. Rich flavors persist throughout. The chocolate is fresh and pronounced. The high alcohol is appropriate for the style and season as well. I plan on ageing a bottle as well for a year +. Check this stout out!"
""
"O:  Good beer.  Pretty solid, but there are definitely better options."

"Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout was this year's (2014) best chocolate stout. A proper, full bodied stout in its own right, it had just the right amount chocolate taste to make it the perfect after dinner drink with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"V - So far, the value is pretty low."
""
""
""
"OUTSTANDING!"

"Uncharacteristic but good stout. Very nice dark color with a little more than a finger of mocha brown head. Has a citrus-y smell that blends into the taste. Besides a hint of citrus, there are coffee and chocolate hints as well. The feel is initially smooth going to low to moderate carbonation. Overall, a decent beer, just a bit confusing for a supposed chocolate stout. Maybe my pour? Will try again when I can."
""
""
""
"I have always wanted to try this beer and finally got one in a beer exchange.  I am very disappointed since the beer I got seems to be very flat.  Smell is good, look is like used motor oil with no head at all, and the taste is like the apperance...flat.  I will try this beer again and revise my review when I get a good bottle."
"An outstanding RIS. Cracked open a bottle from 2012, was hot back upon release but has mellowed into an exceptional blend of chocolate and roasted notes. A little smoke caps this off. Comes together wonderfully, and lives up to the fantastic, jet black appearance from the bottle pour. Mouthfeel is suitably decadent - this is a high quality confection in a glass."
"An excellent RIS overall.  Not as challenging and distinctive as Oskar Blues Ten-FIDY, but  definitely with a broader appeal. Perfect for wintertime."
""
""
""
"Smooth and full of flavor"
"There are way too many reviews for this Beer~and much of them are way better then I could ever put into words...let me just say that this is AMAZING,and beyond better than any other Russian Imperial Stout I have ever tried,Dark Chocolate,super roasted french coffee,slight cherry flavor,black as Midnight,and so full of flavor....superb in every way,top notch,stellar,and if you like this style of Beer~you MUST try it,...words cannot convey just how tasty this brew is...10/10 & An A+ in my book any day ~cheers!"
"Glass- Boston Lager perfect pint"
""
"Overall, the taste is very underwhelming. The initial flavors are not there, the roasty finish and chocolate notes save it. The syrupy and thick mouthful was unique as it was slick at the same time. Interesting."
""
""
"Smooth tasting beer.  Great for holiday celebrations!"
""
""
"It has a great dark roasted coffee with a slight hint of dark chocolate feel. Very good!"
""
""
""
""
"Great beginning taste, rich stout, after taste was poor"
""
"Overall: I'm not feeling very creative for this portion right now. Busy drinking."
""
""
""

"Effin D-lish! Hit the spot!"
""

"Overall, it is chocolate and a Stout, try it with your favorite cheese."
""

""

""
""
"Poured into a pint glass at a local taproom.  S/Roasted Malts, chocolate, slight hints of vanilla, a little nutty, and maybe a little vanilla.  T/It was the thickness that I expected of such a stout.  I tasted the roasted malts and chocolate on the first sip.  It was very bitter, but the bitterness subsided as it warmed and that is when the flavor really started to shine revealing small hints of vanilla with the roasted chocolate.  O/I would definitely seek this out again.  It was well worth the purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid, cheaply priced RIS that I look forward to every year. It isn't as outstanding as certain other imperial stouts, but it is a good beer that showcases the style well. Great aromas/flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts, and at $10 a 4 pack you can't go wrong. One of my favorite offerings from Brooklyn Brewery that never disappoints. Everyone rants and raves about how well it ages, so I will have to age one and see for myself."
"Damn great beer that probably deserves more love."
""
"great russian imperial stout, great for winter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it hits nice, smooth and rich flacor"
""
"good enough that I've bought another 4-pack to keep around until next winter to see how it ages.  perhaps a bit lighter/sweeter than the average Russian Imperial (think milk chocolate/vanilla over semisweet chocolate/licorice), but still full of lots of dark malt goodness."
""
"Dark chocolate, biscuit and sourdough. Sour, vinegary aroma. Nothing special here."
""
"Very bitter taste like a strong acid taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful dark chocolate brown color with a rocky, firm and tan head and really awesome, sticky lacing. Aroma is very dark chocolately with a hint of coffee. Taste is upfront with the booze(10% ABV), but once you get past that, the chocolate(bittersweet) and light roasted coffee flavors come through. Mouthfeel is decent, with a little alcohol burn, but stilla  little malt sweetness and smoothness, overall, not bad, but think it would be a little more enjoyable at maybe 7-8% ABV..."
"I'll edit my post at a future date.  Right now, it's not in my glass but it was this night so I wanted to atleast put my 2 cents forward.  pay attention to the taste and overall most.  I'll clean up the rest later but I gave guesstimates for now."
""
"A nice chocolatey boozey burn. Great beer for the price."
"Draft in a sniffer.  Half a finger of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Deep dark chocolate color.  Aromas of dark chocolate, cinnamon and coffee.  Very little coffee.  Maybe just roasted malts.  Smooth abd creamy.  Nice body.  Finished clean.  Chewy.  Hides the alcohol burn well.  Really excellent Russian imperial stout."

"Chocolate Stout done right!! Chocolate love making!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stays true to its 'Black Chocolate' claim. Excellent bitter dark chocolate character, beautiful head retention, with a long chewy finish. Best beer I've had from Brooklyn!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked the fresher version better.  I can't explain if the flatness changed the impression of flavors, or the flavors changed, but they are not what I recalled.  Will need to re-try a fresh one and decide to really alter the ratings or not.  Aged rating: 3.5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Chocolatey, dryish and delicious"
""
""
""
""
"Chocolate and cinnamon on the nose and on the finish with a pleasant aftertaste and not too boozy for the 10% ABV. Highly recommend aging and trying side by side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: [4.25] This is a really nice beer all around.  It lacks chocolate on the nose, but the taste and mouthfeel are great.  The mouthfeel is really silky and smooth.  It has a great body.  This beer is also readily available - which is a plus.  The 10% ABV makes it more of a special occasion beer - than an every day beer."

"Bottle labeled ""winter 12-13"" so it has some age on it. Deep dark brown, nearly black, creamy tan head. Sweet black licorice and blackstrap molasses aroma. Rich flavors of dark chocolate, molasses and dark roasted malt to a lesser extent. Very thick, coats the mouth, fairly sticky. A really good imperial stout. Not overly sweet or overly roasty, good balance and the alcohol is well hidden."

"dark chocolaty stout, with a non-bitter finish"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the epitome of the style, but pretty close -- and a great buy at the price. I see myself buying a few more of these soon."
"Got a 12oz bottle aged for 3 years from a family member who's friend works for Brooklyn. Needless to say it was a few above the 10.6 ABV rating. Into a tulip, very dark like motor oil, gave a 1/8in dark tan head that quickly dissipated with little to no lacing. Aroma: chocolate, coffee, burnt notes, molasses. Mouth feel was very smooth, very thick but still very drinkable. Tasted of dark chocolate, caramel, little char, the alcohol is noticeable at the finish. Overall I quite enjoyed this brew. I'm going to try it again not aged to see how it compares."
""
""
""
"It should be reasonably priced wherever you are, as all BB beers are. And I have yet to drink one that does not meet its value.  Killer at 10ABV also for the price.  Simple but extremely rewarding, straightforward, uncomplicated developed flavors. Delish"

"This is a good stout, but I get way too much tartness and fruit for a chocolate stout.  With this name, I'm thinking dessert stout, but it comes across more as a traditional, bitter, strong RIS."
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Borderline dessert sweet - so it’s heavy roasted meats with dark gravies, after dinner cigars or dark chocolate brownies for this brew."
""

"D: An extremely drinkable RIS...probably the most drinkable I have ever had.  The ABV will catch up with you eventually, but until then... (5)"

"O: I am quite particular about my Russian Imperials. Due to being in my top 3 favorite styles, they have the potential to become one of my favorite brews. They also have the potential to be clunky, malty messes. Lucky for BBCS, it's not the latter. Unfortunately, it's not the former either. There's a LOT going on in this beer, but amongst the business some blunders arise. The booze isn't veiled as delicately as it could have been. Some of the coffee notes are reminiscent to burnt gas station coffee. With those complaints aside, BBCS truly is a wonderful RIS, but it simply straddles the line between good and great falling just at the border."

"Bottom Line: Not sure."
"Overall: Rich flavors blend together nicely, dark bitter chocolates, slight roast, astringent tannin type bitterness. Underneath there is a pleasant creaminess and sweetness that almost pokes through. A smooth drinking beer that masks the alcohol beautifully, and enjoyable and delicatable choice."

"12/20/13 From bottle at home. Label reads ""winter 2013-2014 limited bottling"". Big bold beautiful Imperial stouts are what lured me into the craft world. Black Ops & Bourbon County at the beginning. Later I found Victory at sea, KBS & Rasputin so I know the possibilities. Although I found this drinkable it seemed to lack that kick in the ass character that the above named had that impressed me. The coffee & chocolate were distinct & enjoyable but the lack of body was distracting. I'll save a bottle or 2 to see if it improves as they say."

"o: not a complex stout, but it's very tasty and has a deep, lingering roasty character.  i've had this beer closer to fresh in terms of age, and i remember the alcohol presence being a bit too much.  one year of aging worked wonders.  such a good stout at an unbeatable price.  try it if you haven't already!"

"Poured from bottle. Very nice aroma of chocolate and coffee. Pours black with minimal head. Medium bitter taste. Full bodied with creamy texture and soft carbonation, slightly bitter finish. Very nice Imperial Stout."
""
""

"O: Quite a tasty RIS we have here.  True, it’s not nearly as complex as other imperial stouts on the market, but Brooklyn does a fine job emphasizing its namesake bittersweet dark chocolate in the aroma and on the palate.  A touch boozy, but that seems to be a recurring theme for the style, and at 10.00% ABV, the might of this one is felt.  Drinkability would likely be improved with some age on the bottle to smooth over the edges of the boozy heat.  Overall, a very nice stout, and very nicely priced too at just $8/4pk.  Will enjoy this one again, that is for sure."

"A nice stout that offers a lot. The appearance is a dark black with a coffee colored head. The smell is very sweet with lots of chocolate notes. The smell though is a bit more subtle with malt and more mellow flavors, before a semi sweet chocolate finishes off the taste. The mouthfeel is very nice, coating your cheeks. Overall very good."

"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a snifter, winter 2013-2014 vintage. This one is indeed dark, pitch opaque black with nary a ray of light passing through, with a halo of dark brown foam rimming the glass but otherwise no real head to speak of. Aroma is equal parts roasted, sweet, and floral/fruity, which is unexpected and quite pleasing. Some wood char and dark roast coffee jump out initially, with the latter carrying over onto the palate, burnt toffee, chocolate-covered raisins, and bright floral hops at the end of a sniff, really appreciating this latter element. The taste is well-rounded and mellow despite the bevy of dark malts and roasted grains advertized on the label, the alcohol is almost perfectly concealed (particularly considering this is an imperial stout!) and the flavors are aforementioned dark but smooth instant coffee, toffee, pancake batter, raisin, and baker's cacao mixed with milk. Just the barest tinge of ash at first, although this effect does emerge over time. Finishes quite sweet and here's where one does get a slight hint of alcohol. This is quite thick on the palate but the beer somehow goes down as lighter than it is. Careful or the high ABV will sneak up on you. This beer has won numerous awards and I can see (taste) why. Nothing to criticize here although some may want an Imperial stout to translate as hotter and more aggressive. Truthfully, there is something to be said for such an artful and skilled approach as this."

"This is what you're looking for if you are looking for a beer of this type. Greatly appreciated but only lasted for so long. Getting at least two cases at my local Specs. Great price, case price is around $7/ 4pk. Can't tell it is 10% ABV, hardly in the taste. Smell isn't strong like a coffee so it isn't noticeable from a distance. Drank two of the my first time and forgot it was like for other beers! Same thing goes with the much less-drinkable Blaecorn Unidragon from Clown Shoes. Highly recommended since I just discovered it in early January 2014, now it is indeed my favorite beer to date. Sucks it is only seasonal."
"A very good chocolate stout which hides the 10% ABV well. This is one which definitely could sneak up on you. The rapidly disappearing head and scanty lacing detract from the appearance."

"O 4.5 The 10% abv is hidden well throughout the glass, extremely smooth. I've had a few chocolate stouts and this one is by far the best of the lot. May be because it's an older bottle but the chocolate does not seem forced as many do. Overall Freaking delicious and I'm glad I stumbled on it."

"I have been wanting to try this beer for awhile. It is super dark brown with a dark beige head that has legs and dark brown edges. It smells like burnt caramel, roasted malts, faint chocolate, and licorice. There is a smell of alcohol. This beer tastes just like it smells. Roasted malt, slight licorice, burnt caramel, and faint chocolate. Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick. Overall, this is a very good stout. I will have it again."

"This is a very interesting beer. Pours a beautiful deep mahogany brown, nearly black with a thick 1"" tan head. Visually this beer is amazing. It has a terrific toasty chocolate malt smell. First sip it was very intense and I was surprised at how many sips it took for me to kind of warm up to this one being a stout drinker. I didn't read the abv prior to purchasing as I purchased in a mix a six pack. I think the intense first few sips are due to the high abv. It may in fact be just a little to much, sort of throws the balance off for me in this brew. The chocolate doesn't come thru as much in the sipping of this, I taste more of a roasted coffee flavor. It's a good beer but it's not my favorite overall. Perhaps this beer is a bit to cold right now since it's just out of the fridge, maybe as it warms slightly other flavors will come out in this."
"On tap part of a 6 stout blind taste test. This was second worst. No smell. Strange off flavor of vegetables overpowering the beer. Mouth feel was decent, that's the best I can say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The boozy bite is slightly off-putting but the rest works pretty well. The clarity of chocolate flavor in this is pretty solid."

"Overall a great offering from Brooklyn, I wonder what a couple of years in the cellar will do to this, well that's my plan!"

"I found this Winter ‘09-’10 Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in the back of the fridge that I didn't even know was there…. I mean I was aging it, right? Being an Imperial Stout I wasn’t too concerned about the 4 years or so of age, but I did have to let it thoroughly warm up before I could appreciate it. It poured pitch black with a surprisingly decent khaki head. The aroma was of sweet deep dark fruits and semi-sweet chocolate that definitely leaned to the sweeter side over roasted notes. The taste was also heavy on the smooth dark fruits and chocolate. There was still a bitterness present on the finish but not as overbearing as I remember the fresh version. The Black Chocolate Stout unsurprisingly was still a full on chocolate assault but it had moved away from the bitter chocolate to a sweeter fruitier flavor. It had definitely smoothed out the edges and made for a decadent drinking experience."

"M: Thick and creamy, really coats the mouth. Slightly dry, minimal carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer, waith let me take another sip, ok, I like it well balanced low bitterness, with strong hints of chocolate, and with a ABV of 10% its not your Mcdonalds shake"

"O - above average stout that should age well."
""
"This is my next in a line of RIS I've been tasting before the brutal michigan winter finally winds down. The pour is quite handsome with a near black body and dark tan head. The head lasts well into the pour and when it does give way it leaves a very nice film and silky tan lacing. The nose is a little unremarkable with subtle notes of dark chocolate (duh), coffee, burnt sugar, and rroasted prunes, figs, and dates. The mouthfeel is coating and slightly sticky., but strictly in the best of ways. The flavor greatly triumphs over the aroma. It is a deep and rich blend of Belgian dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, burnt fruits, and deeply roasted malts. This is an incredibly robust and delicious beer. While not my favorite Russian Imperial, this is without a doubt, a stout that I would come back to anytime. The beautiful bitterness of coffee and burnt sugar last in the mouth for hours after the beer is finished. Well done!"
""
"O: This beer is fantastic. It has smoothness, complexity and good flavors. It aged gracefully and drinks divinely. It just doesn't get much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4): A BIG beer that will be aged in my cellar for a while. The hotness of the alcohol begs for it to be aged, and I imagine this will be fantastic given a few months to a year (or two). A great sipper that I look forward to having again."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and it stayed true to the name with the dark biter chocolate flavors being showcased in this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was a little smooth, sweet, sticky, rich, a little cloying, boozy and filling, but the taste did a good job at holding my attention so i think one bottle would be the perfect amount for me to sip on and enjoy, I think the sweetness and booze would start to wear on me if I had more than one. I think this would make for a good beer to enjoy on those cold and snowy days in the winter. What I like the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty good and the chocolate flavors stuck out enough to make it true to it's name. What I like the least about this beer was how much the alcohol showed up, I think the 10% could have been hidden a little better. I would buy this beer again, it would be nice to keep a couple in the fridge for the winter and I would like to see how this beer ages overtime, maybe age will help tame some of that alcohol. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong stouts, but it may be a little too intense for people who aren't real into the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I did think that there were a couple aspects of this beer that could be improved upon, but other than that I still enjoyed and I wouldn't turn one down. It isn't my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, but it is now my favorite beer from Brooklyn Brewery. Good job guys, this was a pretty good Stout, keep up the solid work."
""
""
"Over. - Great tasting beer. Perfect for people who enjoy chocolate! Would buy again in a heartbeat."
""
""
"Overall, well done and definitely work drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the only tastes which dominate and ultimately hurt the Brooklyn RIS are its chief characteristics, bitter dark chocolate and alcohol. If you let this beer warm a few degrees as you savor its darkness and 10% ABV it becomes acrid/hot and almost undrinkable playing second fiddle to Stone's RIS. This must be enjoyed in a timely manner at serving temperature to fully appreciate its bitterness, high abv, and hop back bone."
""
"O - outstanding beer. Very well brewed and high alcohol content. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O- Not the biggest fan of this one. Maybe I'll buy one to age for a year or two."

""
"O: I picked up a single today and am considering snagging a four pack for the remainder of the cold months (goodness, I hope they don't last, but if so, I'll be ready)."
""
"O: An extremely complex and delicious RIS. Could have been the year of age on it or a change in my taste, but this is much better than I remember it fresh last year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle with a jet black color and a very small, quickly dissipating tan head. Smells of chocolate, malts, and oaky bourbon. Taste is sweet dark chocolate, fruits, malts, and some bourbon. Has a full body feel and goes down smooth. This is an amazingly delicious beer."
""
""
""
"330ml bottle. Tulip glass. Pure black color headed by creamy foam. Brownish tan is lasting & leaves lacing on sides. Roasted malt & cocoa aromas with herbal hues. Bitter cocoa, hints of toffee & lavender at first sip. Full body. Soft carbonation. Viscous texture & subtle spicy to the palate. Bitterness grows up in the middle & lingers, attached to herbal infusion & creamy roasted maltiness, into the finish. Bitter cocoa on the aftertaste. ABV has been well camouflaged. Flavorful & nice drinkable!!"

"Had this poured into a stout glass. After a few sips I decided this was my favorite beer I've tried to date from Brooklyn. Dark chocolate color to match both the flavor and the aroma. Generous tannish-brown head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee beans. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel and medium body for a stout. Obvious chocolate flavor, great winter after dinner beer."

"Overall: The chocolate flavor is phenomenal, though I am not wild about some of the supporting flavors though. The mocha flavors are spot on but the bitterness is really cranked up in this one. Almost sour notes of burnt toast develop. The alcohol is also to pronounced in the finish, but I suppose that's to be expected given it is a 20 proof beer. I really think this will develop well with a year or two on it."
""
""
""
"This stout, however, is just a bitter coffee beer. There is no chocolate or any other ingredients, and it qualifies as a very traditional American stout."

"one of my favourite stouts."
""
""

"Overall this beer is great. I had this a few years ago and thought it was too boozey, now I don't even taste booze. I understand the hype now. Definitely one of the best, if not the best chocolate stout I've had."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is delicious and drinks entirely too easily for a 10% impy stout. And a steal at $8-9 a four-pack."
"Overall: I still have plenty of RIS to try, but this is right behind my favorites so far (Expedition and Founders) and very affordable for the style. Not as choclatey as the title indicates, but rather has all the traditional RIS characteristics and they mold together nicely. Very well done and especially appetizing with this harsh winter we have been having. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a brew that has American Stout written all over it but it has some Belgian influences with it's smooth dark fruit characteristics. Glad i had the opportunity to try this!"
"O: Not too chocolatey, which is good, but there's nothing terribly special about this. Still a good Stout offering."
""
" I'll have it again. Hopefully soon!"

"This beer has great amounts of dark chocolate bitterness coupled with the malty after-palate and higher alcohol levels come together to create an exemplary imperial stout. No need for oak-aging or added flavors, the beer lets the malts speak for themselves."
"O - A nice stout. On the boozy side with less chocolate than I expected. Still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this came highly recommended by a few friends, and I see the potential but I think that perhaps this bottle was too young to get the best out of it. I have another that I will revisit in a year and re-review. It is a good RIS at this point, but not the one I think my friends are recommending."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a solid chocolate stout, not the best but definitely not the worst. I've bought it before and I'll definitely keep buying it in the future. I think it's worth the price, and also worth saving a few bottles each year for aging."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid; some added complexity would be a nice additive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"BOD 263/13. Black as a starless night pour with a massive head and lasting lacing. Light nose of chocolate with a hint of dark fruit. Medium bodied with a slick creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation level is normal. The alcohol is not well hidden and dominates the flavor profile after the initial notes of chocolate. A slight medicinal taste is present along with a bit of licorice and hop bitterness. Finishes smoothly with a bit of sweetness followed by alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"The initial smell and taste of this beer is astounding. It has an opening taste of malty coffee/chocolate with a smooth body. The finish is a strong malty taste that pulls through the chocolate taste. The aftertaste is pretty strong on the malty taste so i would recommend some food in between to break up the malty taste. The smell of this stout cant be beat."
""
""
""
"If this additional flavor was added to this beer at the brewer You would see much higher reviews I am sure. Most reviews are up there but not everyone is as picky and critical of a beer as a few others like me. Try it and see. Just make sure you use high quality extract. Cheers."

"O - Pleasantly boozy, I quite like it with ~1.5 years on it, I'd also like to try one aged 4-5 years to get a better grasp on this one without the boozy qualities. Happy with this one though"

"DATE TASTED: January 2, 2014... GLASSWARE: Guinness pint...OCCASION: snow day #1 of the young winter season--and the last day watching season one of Game of Thrones... APPEARANCE: I've read some critics suggest taking the ""appearance"" out of a beer's rating--and when rating this, I see why; pitch black body; intimidating thick brown head that froths; taking the black indeed--what else to say? beautiful... AROMA: robust chocolate; roasted hazelnut; nice, rich, balanced maltiness--an intense, densely packed aroma... PALATE: immediately warming, full-bodied presence; creamy, almost too smooth to be believed--or trusted, at 10% ABV; as the glass drains, friendlier and swifter to the throat...TASTE: strong malt backbone; chocolate, molasses and some roasted nutty suggestions--but all is sweet here, like a dessertif should be... OVERALL: a tour de force, and outside their collaborations with Schneider, my favorite Brooklyn offering....if price were no issue, this would be in heavy winter rotation in my beer fridge..."
"Overall this is an excellent brew that will stand up to other Imperial Russian Stouts and is reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
"I think this is my first beer from Brooklyn and I'm underwhelmed. Was expecting a nice smooth chocolate stout. Instead it was more of a bitter liqueur. Not a bad beer but it's label doesn't match its contents according to my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"At least as smooth as the Rogue to start, definitely high gravity, bitter coffee and chocolate are surprisingly not overwhelming, they must settle though because they're more noticeable as you go along (not-quite grainy at the bottom)."
""
"Overall the lack of carbonation after the initial pour creates a lessened experience. Rich and boozy but a bit short in depth consideing it all. Vinous in nature like a fruit bomb of a zinfandel. Probably not worth the calories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edge to GFDS."
""
"O: Solid. Very straight forward flavors, but well put together."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Solid, but maybe a bit disappointed. I am a huge fan of Garrett Oliver and probably expected a bit too much as it is my first from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall--a very good, very rich imperial stout that drank just like its name implied. The 10% ABV packed a punch, but it also provided a distinct flavor that accentuated the chocolate beautifully. I'm curious to see how this one ages--will it become more complex; will the alcohol/chocolate bitterness soften into something a bit mellower and roastier; will it develop a creamier body? I guess time will tell, but it'll be worth drinking either way."
"O: This is a really nice beer, but is honestly less chocolatey than I had expected from the name. I honestly get more creamy chocolate from Dark Horse's Plead the 5th. Which isn't a knock on this beer, but rather an observation about the expectations created from its name. Still very happy to be trying this -- I will gladly revisit it in the future."
""
"O: It was interesting and a pretty good deal. I'm afraid that I may not have allowed it to warm quite enough."
"O - Nice Stout fitting for after dinner."

"Pours black with a small tan head that has ok retention and excellent lacing.the smell is of chocolate and licorice. And the flavor is just like the aroma but with some earthy hop flavor. There is some mild warm alcohol flavor as well.the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. And just the right amount of carbonation to keep it right. This beer is pretty good but not epic. A great beer for the price for sure. Very glad I tried this. And highly recommend it."

"A very solid stout. Poured from a 12oz bottle into tulip. I didn't get as much chocolate smell or taste as expected... Based on the name. More of a malty flavor with slight hint of dark chocolate followed by a bit of boozeyness. It was a much better taste as the beer began to warm up. I would get this beer again. Just now in my top tier but I can see why some feel it should be."
""
""
""

""
"I wish I could find this beer year round. Highly enjoyable to drink."
""
""

"Ranking this just slightly above average feels like something of an apology to it. It's lacking in any obvious flaws, but it tastes unbalanced and slightly unpleasant. I've got a few more bottles from this same year, a couple of which weren't aged in the fridge, maybe some extended cellar aging did it some favors? Seems doubtful."

"Served in growler. First review and I am new to this but I enjoyed this dark beer with nice foamy head. Had chocolate and coffee smell and taste. A real lip smacker. Strong! Went great with my burger which is my favorite. A burger and beer....what is better?"
""
"Very nice. Currently drinking stouts. Decided to revisit this one. High alcohol so watch out. Taste awesome. 4.5 stars. A must taste. This one went down quickly. Gonna go in the fridge now and grab a ""Thunderstruck"" from Highlands brewery, right up the road in Asheville."

"Great RIS for the money and availability. Super drinkable on cold winter nights or with dessert. Better with a little more warmth, flavors seem to come out even more."
"O- a little over hyped if you ask me but it didn't fall flat on its face, overall a drinkable beer for 10% and a nice stout"
""
"O- a very good, but not quite great stout. I would have wanted more roast malt to balance off the hops."
"The flavor follows with a bit of the base beer of dark chocolate and roasted malt, but then it's dominated by a beautiful woody, vanilla, dark cherry black coffee. The booze still comes through."
""
""
""
""

"2012 vintage a bit disappointed from what I remember fresh. Current pour is ok with head that quickly fades. Nose is alcohol forward, bit if spent coffee grinds, chocolate largely gone as far as sweet smell. Taste and feel are good but again taste is lacking from fresh version with a boozy sweetness that isn't bad but just lacking depth. Feel is thick"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I really like it. It is finally cold enough outside that stouts are perfect. A nice dark beer that warms you up with alcohol that is not over strong and a great mix of flavors. This is good. I will definitely drink it again."

"O- One of my new favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. Nice dark chocolate bitterness then blends into milk chocolate and roasty malt sweetness. Definitely some heat at the back end but for a 10%'er it's well hidden esp for a fresh bottle. One of my new winter favorites"
""
""
""
"Even though the name is Black Chocolate Stout, I picked up a bunch of malts and coffee is the smell and flavor. But this beer truly shines , and the chocolate comes out, after it beer sits for a few minutes. I have the 12-13 batch from last year that I am waiting to open to compare the two. Well done, Brooklyn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank my second bottle a few weeks after my initial review. The chocolate is more prevalent now and so is the dark coffee flavor. A bit sweeter than I remembered. I'm liking this beer now! Still not as good as Samuel Smith's but really holds it's own in its own special way."
""
"O - This is a solid and accessible imperial stout and I look forward to the next one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with faint carbonation..Excellent! I really should indulge in this way more often than I have. Maybe cellar some too."
""

"Pair it with a slice of New York Cheesecake."

""
""
"This one poured midnight black into a cut cafe glass. A finger size head of an intense mocha color formed and remained a ring on the edge of the glass for the entire 45 minute drinking period. The smell was of dark roast coffee, deep roasted malt and dark chocolate. The taste intensified those characteristics, plus added more chcolate depth with a subtle alcohol burn considering he 10% rating. Mouthfeel was smooth and viscous with slight carbonation, once again the alchohol was well hidden. This is the best offering that I've had from Brooklyn Brewery, a strong contender for my favorite Stout. World Class."
""
"Overall: Not many points I could take away from this bad boy, aside from the booze at the end. Would love to taste a barrel aged version. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I am curious whether this is too fresh or if this is infected. Very average beer that has enough redeeming qualities not to be considered poor. Would try it again if I found it on the cheap."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - I like this beer. This is the 2nd out of the 4 pack. The 1st one didn't seem as good as this one. But god damn is it good :)."
""
""
"O: With an alcohol content of 10% by volume I was hoping this would've aged nicely a bit, but it did not. You would think that I would've learned this lesson by now due to the fact that I have aged other chocolate based stouts. If your stout has chocolate in its name then do not age it. I still have another few bottle from the same vintage so the rest will stay aging."
"O: an imperial stout indeed, aromatic and flavorful. Improves with warming, and 15 minutes out of the refrigerator was not enough."
""
""
"O- excellent beer, the sweetness wasn't overpowering and added to the taste. more carbonation would be appreciated"
"It does what it does very well, but it surprisingly did not do much more. This was a 13-14, served cold. 3.75"
""
""
""
"Overall - Good brew. Something holds it back from being stellar but it's quite good nonetheless and I had no problem finishing all of them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's good, but considering other high quality choices available, it's average amongst the ranks of high quality craft beers."
""
""
"An excellent RIS that could easily be year round... the price is also damn hard to beat. One of the cheapest RIS's I've purchased, and nearly the best."
""
""
""
"O - who know's if this beer has changed a lot during its hibernation, but it's real good now. Comes real close to being perfect in a lot of ways. Definitely a great beer for the coming winter months."

"O- Decent taste, has more dark fruit sweetness that throws off the balance imo. Can defiantly tell its 10%, it lets you know from the smell to the finishing taste, finding that the alcohol is less hidden in some of our American brews, but once you get past that the flavors are pretty good."
"Overall not a bad beer, not as chocolatey as I expected though. Feel still needs a lot of smoothing out. Glad Brooklyn has expanded to the west coast and I got to try this though"

"Another tasting. Even more than before this stout has everything, I mean everything I ever wanted in a stout. The pour was beautiful. Deep rich black chocolate stout down into the glass, then topped with a 1 1/2 frothy amber cream head that stayed and stayed. Once my nose was inside the glass, I felt like a kid in a chocolate factory. The taste was superb, you would think at 10% ABV, there would be some burn here, but its smooth and smoother As I had more from my glass, I could detect the alcohol in the nose but still was not in the taste. The chocolate got richer and the beer kept on getting better."

"O - I am a big fan of this beer.  It is full and robust, and that it evokes so completely the full range of chocolate notes without using adjuncts is impressive to say the least.  There is serious alcohol and bitterness tied into the sweeter elements, so do not mistake this for a simple dessert beer.  A stout of the first order, this will always be a go to RIS in my book."
""
""
""
"O- A very good stout, but I think there are better chocolate stouts available, and less expensive. Personally, I like a sour note in stouts, but this one has too strong of a sour taste. Like I said earlier, I'm almost certain that a high percentage of sour malt was used. There are a lot of great reviews, but in my opinion there is room for improvement. I would say the aroma and finish are the best aspects of the beer."

"Great sipper for the wintertime. Exceptional beer, which gets better and better once it warms up. This was beyond my positive expectations. This one now and Sorachi Ace are my preferred brews from Brooklyn."

"Strong flavors in this one that satisfy with every sip. Creamy like a milkshake with rich and complex flavors that area delight to behold in the glass. Although the chocolate is rich, it's the roasted malt that is the star of this show with it's pecan accents and molasses like smoothness. This is a new favorite."

"O: If I had tried this before, I never would've got a case. That's 24 of these bad dogs. I wasn't even thinking about alcoholic content when I got it. I'm still used to thinking all stouts are like Guinness; barely any alcohol content. After my Victory Brewing Imperial Stout experience, I realized stouts are highly alcoholic and are not the ""thirst quenching"" beer. On the bright side, this is very good beer, even though it's old. I never did find a date, but I remember this being in the store for at least 4 months and I remind you, it's July 2013. All the label on the bottle says is ""Limited brewing 12-13""so it was brewed last winter, since winter '13 hasn't yet passed. This would be nice to enjoy during it's seasonal run, on tap, with friends. One is all you need, remember, this is beer fit for royalty."

"D-this is a great RIS, nice flavors throughout, not balanced but hops are in there, unbelievable mouthfeel and it hides the alcohol very well. I will be purchasing a case and aging half!"
""
"Overall: Damn, this is a really good beer! But be warned this is totally a sipping beer, not a session beer! The high chewiness and alcohol content (this beer clocks in at 10% ABV) completely makes it an after dinner/desert/final beer of the night kind of beer. I like this beer a lot, but damn it’s thick and intense! In a totally awesome way!!"

"O: This is a fine stout for a winter release. The warming alcohol and dark chocolate and malt profile is very welcome on a cold day, and still enjoyable even now in the summer months. This is the third bottle from a four pack I've had for some time, and in my opinion this bottle is a little past its prime. The second bottle that I opened a few months ago seemed to have a more prominent chocolate profile. That being said, this was still great. I'll be hanging on to my last bottle to see where it goes."

"It seems like this beer would age well if you could keep it from oxidizing. Hell, even slowing the oxidation down wouldn't be so bad. It was just a little too much, here, but the beer that lies underneath the oxidation seemed to be doing fine. I'd like to have this one again, fresh, just to compare. Very good stout, although there are plenty out there that I'd choose over this one."
""
"O- I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but this is a pretty good one. At 10% I won't be slamming them down."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm glad I decided to keep this bottle from last year, as my main complaint about it last year was that it was so boozy. The alcohol mellowed out and allowed the dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavors to come through more. I'd love to age this even longer."
""
""

""

"Well rounded with lots of dark malt character. A bit grainy at times and some alcohol in the finish but generally a really fitting desert beer."

This does seem to get a little better as it warms, but still a disappointment. The 10% APV at least gets you nice and warm."
""
""
"Overall: Great stout with upfront chocolate influence."
""
""
"O- There is a lot to like about BCS, great smell, great use of chocolate, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. I think this brews full potential would be met after a few years in the cellar to help tone back the boozieness. All in all however, a stand up stout lovers stout."
""

"black chocolate stout- is pretty heavy on the black and not so much on the chocolate. it pours black- with hardly any head- but i didnt pour it hard into the glass so that could be my fault. the smell is really sweet, with traces of alcohol. the flavor is super bitter and rich. this is a good stout....but i dont feel like there is as much chocolate in the flavor as i would have liked. i think over all though this is a flavorful stout that coats your whole mouth and delivers what i look for when i drink a powerful stout... i am a little let down however by the work ""chocolate"" on the label- i think if i wasnt influenced by that word i may have rated this beer higher."

"Not bad, reminds me of Old Rasputin well crafted with lots of earthy licorice notes. A little green, could have waited 6 more months to crack this one, alcohol makes a big impact. Aroma is memorable. More chocolate and sweetness could push this beer up."

"Overall-Great price for a 4-pack. This chocolate stout has everything you could want in a RIS, great taste and an even better smell. Abv is a right up therewith the great RIS of our time, but this one doesnt hide it as well as those. Serve this one slightly less then room temp. 4.25"

"BCS is a a go-to Imperial stout of mine because of the high quality at a relatively low price. While not among the elites of the style, once it has some age on it, it truly becomes a great beer. Pick up a 4-pack, or two, or ten, and enjoy over several years."
""
""
""
"It is an absolutely black beer, with a super retained beige neck. The expresso/chocolate aroma hides very well the stunning alcoholic content of 10%. In terms of taste, we have a full-bodied beer that should emanate expresso and (dark) chocolate - exactly what we have here. The low carbonation pairs with a good hoppy presence to balance the toasted malt. The end is dry, hoppy, and brings the feeling of having an expresso. Very appropriate that what it proposes to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- A nice imperial stout with very strong chocolate flavor. The age seems to have played nicely with the flavors. Still the chocolate is a bit strong to the point where I wouldn't immediately reach for another."
""
""
""
"O: This was my first experience with a RIS so I don't have a great benchmark to base this off of. With that said, everything I've read about this style is coming through really nicely in this beer. If this is what all RIS's are then I'm hooked. Great beer from a great brewery."
"o - This should be a go-to for anyone looking for a year round RIS fix. It is definitely one of my favorites and well worth the price tag affixed to the bottle. I would recommend it over and over to anyone who is in the business of trying new beers."
"O: I'm all in. For price and availability this is spot on. I won't wait years before my next bottle."
"O: Right up there with Old Rasputin in my book. Great stout, 10% is well hidden, delicious, creamy, warming. Nothing better on a snowy winter's night!"
""
"O- The first thing I thought of, was that this was no where near the chocolate stouts I have had in the past. But then I read and realized that this chocolate stout (unlike others) doesn't actually use chocolate in it's recipe. Then I was struck by how well selected the blend of malts is, in imitating the chocolate flavor. Props to Brooklyn."
"Brooklyn's best beer, I think. Such deep flavor, for a great price."

"O - A great dessert beer. My middle-age woman need for chocolate and booze has been satisfied by this sumptuous stout."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a huge imperial stout fan. I consider this to be one of the best. On par with Founders, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy and the recent Narwal from Sierra Nevada. Chocolate and toffee finish with a completely smooth finish. You can barely taste the alcohol, which can sometimes be overwhelming in imperial stouts. This is a beer I will look forward to every winter. I was fortunate to find this brew a dollar off its already honest $7.99 retail price for a four pack. I love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A definite favorite, though also not a session beer."
"O: 5: as a full disclosure, Brooklyn's BCS is my favorite RIS on the market; it also holds sentimental value for me as one of the first beers that addicted me to craft beer and sparked an interest in homebrewing (I brew a clone of it each year now); the chocolate and coffee aroma and taste are unparalleled with just enough hop flavor/aroma for balancing, maybe the best use of Cascade hops in a non-American IPA/DIPA; I'll continue to be cellaring and eagerly anticipating my vertical tasting in 5-10 years. Cheers, Garrett Oliver and Co.!"

"Final Thoughts: I can't help but question this beer, I mean you'd think a beer that emphasizes chocolate taste would go for something sweeter, but it doesn't. You'd also think as an RIS more malt and other character would be there, but it's not. If you like dark chocolate or high cacao chocolate you will like this beer, I personally don't so it's not quite my thing."
""
""
"Overall: Very nice stout. Again, I say this too often here, I wish I could get this one here in Utah."
"""Chocolate"" is very sutble. Very drinkable and perfect Sunday afternoon brew."
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a heavy brown head that takes it's time leaving. Smells like a Hershey bar with some dark maltiness. Tastes the same with hardly any alcohol coming thru. A nice dry sweetness at the end. Satiny mouthfeel. Just velvety chocolate stout goodness!"
""
""

"O – This is a good RIS. It’s not the best or most complex one that I’ve had, but it is exactly what is advertised – a black chocolate stout. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque, nearly black color with a dull mocha/khaki head that has a hydrogen-infused appearance. The aroma is very nice. A lot of coconut and sorghum up front. After the beer settles a bit, a lot of sweet, milk chocoate emerges. Mouthfeel is not as viscous as it looks. Very creamy with some sting around the edges of the tongue from a carbonation/hop hot/alcohol combination. A lot of chocolate flavor, contrasted by the smokiness. The smokiness dissipates as the beer sits. There's a bit of ripe cherry in there as well. I like it very much."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer enough for a second glass. Great for sipping at the bar with friends. Will definitely drink again."
"This beer had a weird sour and bitter taste not what I was expecting. Hopefully just a bad bottle and the other 3 will be better."

"O: Really nice beer. I'm going to have to add this one to my list of go to stouts."
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit of a disappointment. Other imperial stouts, like Old Rasputin and Choklat, are able to cleverly disguise the high-alcohol in the complex flavors. This is binary, and it doesn't work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the best value beers I've ever encountered. Will be buying a case next year."
""
"o: I'd heard this was a good value, like old Rasputin, quality for little cost. this doesn't come close to OR. Only $8 for a 4 pack but I would say paying anything more would be inappropriate. I probably will pass on this in the future, but for $2, this 10%abv chocolate stout was decent. 3.75"

"Pours black with thin layer of tan foam. Decent lacing. Sweet aroma of chocolate and caramel with some roast and alcohol apparent. Sweetness first in taste of dark chocolate and then some roasty, burnt flavor, followed by brewed coffee. Alcohol adds a somewhat peppery character and is very apparent but not disagreeable. Semi full and somewhat sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Nice stout. Flavors meld well together."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely not one of my favorite imperial stouts. I doubt I'll revisit this one -- too many better options available."
""
"A pretty decent imperial stout and worth drinking at least once year."
""
""
"Light malty chocolate notes on the nose, very smooth open smokiness and sourness on the tongue. Expected a much stronger chocolate flavour (agree with previous statement that perhaps maturing longer may be of benefit), great smoothness of mouth, notwithstanding the lack of chocolate taste, it very nearly ticks all the boxes!"
""
""
"Pours dark black duh, with a great dark beige head. Smell is milky, some chocolate, hops, leaves a little to be desired on the nose . Tastes hoppier than I expected, a little dark coffee flavor, nice lactic chocolate taste that isn't too sweet. It's very smooth and leaves a delicious chocolate aftertaste in your mouth, great after dinner beer"
""
"Overall: maybe this was over-hyped, or it needs some aging, because it's not blowing my mind - given the name I was expecting huge chocolate flavours and it didn't deliver; still a well made beer, could be good for a stew"
""
"Overall: A nice RIS with a good balance of roast but the chocolate taste balances this out well making it seem somewhat sweet too."
"Overall excellent!"
""
""
""
""
"Trade from AlexFields. Thanks! Pours black as expected with a kahki one finger head. Aroma is unexpectedly fruity, almost a mix of a belgian quad an md some creamy chocolate notes. Some roastiness here and smells pretty hearty. Flavor is heavy chocolate and some fruit. Lingering roast on the finish that explodes on the palate. Nice and creamy mouthfeel. Very good. Sweetness is there but balanced by the bitterness from the roasted flavor. Reminds me a lot of Stone's RIS offering, but like this one better. Really no alcohol presence despite the double digit abv. Pretty nice for non-overpriced impy. And to think I have 3 more to drink!"
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is slightly thick and viscus, with a carbonated finish. This lends to my overall feelings in that I really enjoyed it but found the immense carbonation off-putting. I allowed it to ""air out"" like a wine and it behaved much better. Very strange."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In my opinion, this is as good as it gets for a ""standard"" RIS. The chocolate flavor is excellent and very prevalent. I also think this is the best value beer on the market - delicious, 10% ABV in 12 ounce bottles, extremely well-priced and easily obtainable."
""
""
""
"O - Very good imperial stout...a classic for sure. I've had so many outstanding imperial stouts lately that this doesn't stand out from the crowd that much. Still very good, but perhaps ""showing its age"" as its been around a while and some of the other IRS's out there seem to appeal a bit more to me. I would never complain about having this, and would gladly have another - just doesn't stand out from the crowd anymore - at least to me."

"O. I really like this beer. Its crazy cheap for what it is even when its not on sale. Well worth grabbing two four packs every year to drink one and age one, if not a whole case. Not sure how long these will age but I have a lot of them so I will see."

"O-- Not the best RIS out there, by far, but a nice winter seasonal. Amongst all the other stouts flooding the market this time of year (a good thing!), Brooklyn Black Chocolate does stand out by getting so much chocolate flavor out of the malts. It's also a great value, and pretty easy to get a hold of in my area."

"Really do love this beer. It pours pitch black with a foamy brown head that quickly recedes to an elegant lacing. Big dry fuit notes on the nose, cherry in particular. Bitter chocolate in the back. Tastes like a dessert. A rich dark chocoalte with a cherry filling. Not overly long, but well layered. It ends with some surprisingly smoky roast notes, which taste a little out of place but keep the beer from becoming to cloying. Mouthfeel is decently thick and the beer initially stings the tongue, it is 10% after all. Strangely I prefer this beer fresh when its a little less sappy, but even now, a year later its fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am very pleased with this beer. It's one that could get you in trouble though...easy to drink and no alcohol detectable."
""
""
"What an awesome brew. Excellent flavor, the chocolate was not overdone. The roasty character of any good stout stands out while complimenting the subtle chocolate notes. Super smooth and drinkable, and best of all it's decently priced. A must try."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good RIS, but I've had much better. HOWEVER, the price point on this actually makes this beer a great value - I would give it a 5 for value. Definitely give this one a try, but is a bit lighter than what I prefer in this style, and imho chocolate plays a very minor role, I would call this one Black Imperial Stout ;o)"
""

""
""
""
"**Note -- could be dark chocolate and not tobacco flavor, but definitely putting me off."
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.20, an excellent A-. There can be no doubt - Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had. At 10%, it's about as hot as you'd expect, so one bottle would probably be enough for me on any given night, as the alcohol and sweetness combine to make something that is clearly better suited to sipping than sessioning. Still, it's a bargain at its LCBO price ($2.65/bottle), so I would suggest stocking up before they run out. Canadian winters are pretty long, after all."

Just goes to show how ever changing our palettes are when it comes to this thing of ours. A super solid RIS, very rich and creamy, great flavors all around. Next time I won't wait 2 years to buy this again."

"O - Brooklyn makes some other beers that I like a lot, so I had higher expectations for this one. At this price, I probably would not get this again. A 22oz bottle of Rogue's chocolate stout would've been a much better investment even if it meant half as much beer."
""
"O: Nice sipping winter beer. One of my all time favorite beers from one of my all time favorite breweries."
"O: A very good beer, and one that I have come to really enjoy. I will save a 4-pak in hopes that in about a year, maybe some sweetness will come through, or the subtle flavors will pull through a little stronger. And at 10%, it hides it extremely well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not overly impressed with this beer. It's a good, solid brew, but there's not much complexity, and the flavors don't quite hit the mark the way other chocolatey Imperials do. It certainly didn't live up to expectations, and maybe that's part of the problem. If it made it out to the West Coast, I'd probably buy it again, but it's definitely not a beer I'm going out of my way to get again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep opaque black with a razor-thin head. No lacing. Smells of dark chocolate. Tastes very boozy. Smokey with some chocolate notes. Mouthfeel dominated by searing alcohol. Overall the flavor just gets completely overwhelmed by alcohol. Not terrible by any means but I wouldn't get this again."
""
""
"Anyway, I know this has always been an RIS but I feel like it had more chocolate in it in years gone past. I honestly wish I had one from last year to compare. That being said, still a great beer, lovely on the tongue, a crisp stout finish and really not much to complain about (unless you hate stouts). All in this is one of my favorite high gravity stouts."

"O - What a great RIS for a beer enthusiast to enter the subclass. I would choose either Old Rasputin or Brooklyn BCS to represent the category (Not as the best, but as a well-rounded representative of what the group has to show). Many thanks to Brooklyn Brewery for offering the RIS in 4-packs, allowing the flavors and scents to evolve over time."

""
"Overall: Probably my favorite chocolate stout."
""

""

"O - 3.75 - This is a mature stout in the sense that it doesn't try to be sweet and syrupy and isn't afraid to be bitter in that darkest chocolate sort of way. I think it could actually use a bit more body and silkiness. The thinness combined with the metallic note give me something I don't quite want, which distracts from an otherwise interesting beer."
"O - An all around excellent chocolate stout. Very complex and flavorful. This is probably my favorite Brooklyn Brewery offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - although it's not really complex stout, it seems that this one would benefit from some age to let the flavors figure themselves out. I liked it, I would even recommend people try it, just didn't love it. I'll revisit this in a year or two."

"It starts out smooth but the rush of flavor doesn't wait long to hit you. The chocolate flavor is perfectly balanced by the bitter taste from the alcohol (enhanced by the high level of alcohol I think) as it simmers on your pallate it gives you just enough time to ask yourself if you just drank the perfect chocolate stout or ate the perfect piece of dark chocolate."
""
"Ok the first one I tried was right out of the bottle. I expected a strong tasting stout (which it is) but this beer is much more than that. first sip a bit bitter but with much character. after that, it was love at second pull. I savored each sip really looking for good or not so good. Well, this stout does not disappoint. Rich Chocolate mixed with barley and malt. A serious treat of a stout. Alcohol taste to me was not overbearing at all. Goes down very smooth but beware!! This brew packs a wallop. I had 4 bottles in about 2 hours or so and you will feel it. Have to many and your not going anywhere!! At least not me. A great cold weather brew. At $7.99 a 4 pack, it is well worth it. I wont drink it all the time, but treat myself now and then. I like it!!"

"I was not looking forward to this beer. I bought a four-pack of this back in 2008, and I thought it was pretty nasty. Fresh, I imagine it is still pretty nasty. But with a year of aging, the remarkable harshness turns into a drinkable substance that seems like it was spawned from a brownie recipe that ended up on the grill. Still not my favorite, but good."

"O - Very pleased with this seasonal offering from Brooklyn Brewery. It is not exactly up my alley, but represented itself and its style very well. I see myself sipping this one again in a long session as I read or do work late at night. I will probably not have a reason to buy another 4 pack, but I would definitely recommend it, and would jump on trying it if I saw it somewhere on tap. If I had only gotten a couple sips of this, my opinion would be totally different, so all your non-stout drinkers, stick with this one!"

"Poured this Russian Imperial Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This stout poured a dark black color, produced a light brown head, featured excellent retention and left a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of dark chocolate, fresh ground coffee beans, and some grape/wine like fruitiness. Full bodied, this stout was extremely smooth and creamy. Very nice mouthfeel. Foundation of roasted malt, espresso beans, dark chocolate, alcohol, and grape/prune fruitiness. I would classify this brew as a winter warmer- something to keep handy on the first blustery cold night in December. Excellent example of the style, its a big beer but not so big that you have to force your self to finish the session. Overall...outstanding."

"Overall, it's very good. I'd drink this anytime, anywhere."
"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled 9/15/2010(over 2 years). Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, earth, and light coffee. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, raisin, prune, toast, molasses, earth, and light coffee. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, prune, raisin, char, roast, molasses, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Good depth and balance of flavors; no cloying on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. Good depth, complexity, and balance of flavors; fairly smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable to sip on slowly."

"Edit, coming back to this beer 7 or 8 months later. Really have to downgrade taste. A lot of the chocolates have dropped off an given way to dark boozy fruits."
""
""
""
"O- tastes nothing like I remember. The dark chocolate flavors have faded and given way to a Complex dark fruit flavor. Given the thin mouth feel and the more fruity flavors that have developed, this could easily be mistaken for an Old Ale. Pretty good."
""
"Black Chocolate Stout is not a beer I'd buy again. I tried pairing it with foods that generally do well with Russian Imperial Stouts. Dark mint chocolate was the only one that could stand up to it."
""
"This beer is now my favorite, not just for now, but probably for good."
"Overall I loved this stout. I let it sit to warm up and it brought out every taste it had. A complex yet very drinkable beer. Be careful though, at 10 percent this beer sneaks up on you fast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall its very good, especially for being vintaged, very complex and smokey, very chocolatey, very good. Worth a shot."

""
"O: Perfectly lives up to its reputation, and then some. At only a few bucks per bottle, this is excellent to keep in the fridge awaiting the big seasonal stout releases."
""
"Overall, I am dissapointed with this beer. The thin mouthfeel and weak flavors did not live up to my admittedly lofty expectations."
""
""
""
"A very good beer and one with a lot going on, definitely one of the best Imperial stouts I have ever tried and one I hope to try again at some point in the future. The only slight downside was in fact the dryness in that it was slightly too dry for my liking but certainly not enough to put you off the beer. At 10% it's not an everyday beer but it is one everybody should try at least once."

"Tried this beer at the Boulevard in Johnstown, PA. Pours out very black with a small mocha head. Lots of legs in the glass. Lots of roasty aromas straight off the pour. In the glass, there's rich chocolate. The taste is a delightful balance of dark chocolate and roasted coffee, although as it warms a touch of sourness starts to present itself. Full mouthfeel, but highly drinkable thanks to a moderate carbonation level."
""
""
""

"O: Overall, this was an excellent imperial stout with a nice chocolatey backbone. Exceptional mouthfeel for the style. I plan to cellar one for a year or so to see how it matures."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Pours oily jet black with a thick brown head that sticks around. Smells of bourbon, coffee and chocolate...this beer smells better than some taste. The smell after a bit changes into some standard stout roasted malt and yeast. Head leaves a lot of lacing for a stout, beautiful. Taste is glorious; creamy and full mouthfeel, with sweet caramel, coffee and chocolate swirling around with dark roasted malts. Finish is a bit boozy but it works for such a big beer. This was my first stout, and I'd die happy if it were my last."
""
"Thanks Bill!"

""
"O: One of the finest Imperial Stouts on the market. Everything about this is near perfect. Buy a case and set some back to try every 2 or 3 months. When a brewmaster is getting ready to try an Imperial Stout he/she should have one of these to see what they should aim for. Stunning."
""
"O. Nearly perfect, without the mildly boozy finish, it likely would have been. This is a spectacular stout and should in no way be penalized for its ample quantity and wide distribution. In fact, it should be praised for absolutely hitting it out of the park on such a broad scale. One of the best imperial stouts I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've tried this beer once a year for 4 years. It's always tasted like burnt meat ends to me. This isn't a bad thing, but it's not a good thing either. It's like someone took a blowtorch to some malts and bottled it with chocolate."
""
""
"A very good imperial stout. The name might be slightly misleading, since the chocolate flavor isn't as obvious as some might think."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- this beer tastes much much better with 6 months on it than it did fresh. Fresh I'd give it a 2 overall but now it's a 3.5. This beer isn't too bad for the price I guess but I won't really be to disappointed if I don't have it next year."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a great beer, but it is a bit on the harsh side, flavor-wise. If this tasted a bit more like it smelled, or was a little bit cleaner on the palate, it would really be world-class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I didn't get the chocolate component I'd hoped for. And in certain Scotch Ales or even Baltic Porters I enjoy this flavor, but it didn't work. And I believe it shouldn't have been there. Nobody else has described the same experience. Maybe the bottle was a tad funky. I'll try it again, but it was a bit of a disappointment."
""
"Pours a dark rich black with a dark brown head that fades and leaves a nice ring as you sip. The smell is deep with a mix of ingredients, a hint of alcohol behind a nice deep rich malt and inviting chocolate aromas. The flavor starts with a subtle sweet malt moving into a nice chocolate flavor and rounding out with a strong dose of the high ABV. The mouthfeel is by far the best part of this beer, which says a lot considering the flavor and smells are so good. It is so smooth, a rich thick body, borderline medium heavy. Smoothest stout I have ever had. Overall a great beer, the high ABV would prevent a great session beer, but still a standout for the style and for beer overall."
""
"O- Overall a great stout. It has more of a hops kick than many Imperials but it balances well. ABV is definitely noticable, it would be interesting to see how this would hold up to a year or two of cellaring."
""
"Pours black with a half finger khaki head. Head retains only as a ring around the glass. Smells strongly of dark roasted grains. Burnt chocolate and slight yeast also suggest themselves in the nose. Tastes of cocoa soaked bread, if such a thing exists. Ends in hop bitterness mixed with a mild alcoholic undertone. Mouthfeel is slightly less than thick, with a touch too much carbonation for a stout, for my tastes. Very creamy though. Overall, a solid beer. Would enjoy again."
""
""
""
"M: Great flow and coating. The aftertaste lasts long with good roasted malt flavor. An enjoyment factor even after the beer is gone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours black, period, with an 1/8"" tan head and lacing throughout. The aroma is dark roast with dark bakers chocolate and a faint hint of smoke. The flavor is dark chocolate with milk chocolate, coffee, and raisin notes. Very complex. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a biting, medicinal bite in the finish. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a very good beer, recommended!"
"A smooth swig, consisting of rich malt, coffee, chocolate goodness. A perfect after dinner sip to rival the transitional route. A must try!!"
"Wow - one of Brooklyn's classics. A fantastic brew with tons of flavour and character. Rich, sweet, fruity malt with distinct chocolate and coffee notes. I think what impresses me most is that this beer doesn't actually contain any chocolate; the flavour is the result of superb malt selection. I love the smooth mouthfeel. Excellent - add this to your list of must-try beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a great stout everyone should try"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark slightly viscous black with a small brown head. Aroma is a strong chocolate with some roasted dark malts and espresso. Taste is chocolatey, with some roasted dark malt, espresso, and some hops and dark cacao bitterness. A rich full bodied and slightly viscous mouth feel with moderate carbonation on the palate. Finished with a bitter sweet choclatey and roasted dark malts, some espresso, ending is a long sweet lingering bitter chocolate flavor. Overall a delicious, flavorful, satisfying and nicely balance brew. A very enjoyable drink."
""
""
"A dry mocha rich aftertaste lingers on the full bodied effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - First half of the beer is good, the second half is lacking. Overly hopped? Not really, as the hop flavor doesn't come through clearly. It's that burnt flavor at the end that's the most off-putting. Luckily a lot of the other flavors salvage this one."

""

"Overall, it's good. I mean, it has to be good. But it's also a little odd, and doesn't live up to its name or to my expectations. A 10% stout, chocolate or no, should be better than this."
"Very syrupy body, carbonation seems a bit full-on though."

"Overall-For quality/price this beer is a win-win. If I would ever purchase a case of beer this would be it. Saving my last 2 bottles from 11-12 to age and compare to next years release. Thanks to Brooklyn Brewery for making an awesome brew."
"Pours a deep dark black cola color with a one finger khaki colored head which recedes quickly but leaves a nice ring around the glass. There is also a nice sticky lace. The aroma is of dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a roastiness. The taste follows suit for the most part with a dark chocolate taste up front and a hint of milk chocolate before a roastiness and slight coffee flavor finish off the beer. The mouthfeel is sticky and smooth. Overall this is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I quite liked this one. I would get it more often if it was available in my area"

"O: A great imperial stout, nice balance between espresso and cocoa elements, I'm still more of a People's Pint fan, but definitely a close second"
""
"O-good balanced beer, I wish it had a stronger smell to lead you to some more flavors but I will try again next time I get the chance to purchase some more"
""
""
"O: A well balanced but chocolate forward imperial stout. The girlfriend doesn't find it as chocolatey as I do. Given that this beer doesn't seem to have any actual chocolate added to it, the chocolate flavor comes entirely from the malts and is well done."
""
""
""
"Overall- Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a great beer. The nose is great, but I felt like I had to try to hard to enjoy it, wasn't pouring out of the glass. The boozy kiss and sweet qualities make it a pleasure to drink, and the feel is a gift that keeps on giving."
""
"O - I saw this one on sale as they were trying to clear stock to make room for spring seasonals. I enjoyed it all winter long and was not let down on this mild spring evening. The flavors are complex and balanced. It is one of the lowest priced 10%+ ABV beers out there and a very satisfactory RIS."

""
""
"M: Slides down like liquid chocolate, or pancake syrup. Booze tickles in the finish and it leaves you with a slightly dry, chalky hop and roasted malt linger. Perfect."
"O: Very nice RIS, rich, tasty and maybe the most affordable RIS 4 pack at 7.99."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"For the price, 7.99 a four-pack it's tough to beat. A big 10% beer that is this complex, tasty, and delishious is great for us beer folks. Can't wait till next year's version."

"Very big, very tasty."

"O: this one is has nice complexity, and yet nicely balanced. Alcohol is very well hidden in both the nose and the taste. I find this one very appealing and drinkability is extremely high."
"Does everything it says and almost all you want. It's big, its chocolatey, but its very good and well worth trying. Only question is why it took me almost 6 years to revisit. Thanks Adam for an enjoyable refresher course!"
""
""
""
"O: In two words: extremely well-balanced. An exceptionally easy drinking RIS that will completely satisify committed stouties while pleasing dabblers as well. By the name you might be expecting a brew that borders on the sweet, but this one borders on the dry. Make sure someone reminds you that it's 10% abv. Although it provides some warmth it's still easy to forget..."
"Very flavorful and complex beer that I enjoyed overall. For some reason this was beer was a bit much for me, however, it was a nice change of pace from my typical IPA drinking tendencies."

"Pours out very black with a small mocha head. Lots of legs in the glass. Lots of roasty aromas straight off the pour. In the glass, there's rich chocolate.

Full mouthfeel, but highly drinkable thanks to a moderate carbonation level."

"Deep black body with thick, tan head. Smells of chocolate and malt with hints of coffee. Very distinct dark chocolate taste in that it has a nice bitterness and is not as sweet as I thought it would be. A very filling beer (to be expected) although I must admit that it also served as dessert to a hefty lunch. Overall, a nice above average chocolate stout."

"Winter 11-12. 12oz bottle, pours thick and black with a bubbly light brown head that holds some retention, but doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Aromas are dark cocoa/chocolate and boozy. Initial mouth-feel is thick and chewy, but velvety and smooth. Tastes are dark chocolate with a sticky sweetness, some roasted malts, and a little hop bitterness on the finish. Overall, I liked this more than the last couple of times I had it. It is extremely rich and sweet, but excellent none the less."

"Overall a very robust stout. The flavor of this beer remains on the back of the tongue for a good minute or so; a bitter dark chocolate flavor. Nothing like Southern Tier Chokolat however. I find that this beer is so much more enjoyable when mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with a Dark Horse Scotty Karate (Scotch ale); adds a bit of sweetness that this beer alone lacks. By itself however, a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a great beer, which can be enjoyed regularly. It should be served warmer, and poured more vertically for a better head."
""
""
""
"Pours black with a miniscule tan head that dissipates quickly. The alcohol hits the nose and there's some aroma of roasted malt and chocolate once you get past the alcohol. With 10% ABV, you almost have to expect the alcohol to be forward in the aroma. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste, but one can get the bitterness you would expect with this style as well. The flavors of roasted malt and hops are definitely there as well as chocolate. I'm currently aging some, so it will be interesting to compare after this has had some aging. There isn't much carbonation and the body is medium to heavy. This is a solid beer overall."

"Overall; this is a damn good beer, and has all of the qualities I can appreciate in a solid Imperial Russian Stout. Doesn't taste a hint of 10%, even just a few degrees above cellar temps... I would absolutely seek this one out again, and would like to thank Peacehammer for gifting me this one!!"
"O: Very good, I like this beer more each time I have it. Just a big dark monster of roasted malty goodness."

"Lots of chocolate malt and that is not a bad thing but can say I am not a fan of this beer young with some age on this beer gets considerably better. Tonight a 2007 & 2008 bottle was had and this beer is subdued from the fusel feel had when it was younger but this still pretty boozy. Don't see myself buying this again but still have some bottles in the cellar may re-review this beer at a later date but finding this bottle tonight a bit on a struggle to get through."

"O: This beer is like a meal unto itself. Very thick and delicious, definitely a sipping beer. Very drinkable for the 10% abv. Such a complex beer, so many different flavors and aromas. I'd say this is one of the best RIPs i've tasted."
""
"O: Glad that I took the time to cellar this one before drinking it, I have had many of these over the years... from the different batches and aged different amounts but this one is probably my personal favorite (08-09 aged 3 years).

"This beer is an RIS that drinks like an American Double Stout. I have had it many times and it is one of my favorite winter seasonals. It is very easy to get, it is reasonably priced (especially growlers), and it is absolutely delicious. I don't know why I waited so long to review it."

Though this brew lacks the robustness of Choklat, it's less offensively heavy and more varied in flavor, making it much more drinkable. I definitely see a side-by-side tasting in the near future."

"O: My nemesis. I love this beer, but it has historically kicked my butt. It’s deceptively strong. I’ve always liked it, but never really broken it down, which this review has allowed me to do. This beer also makes be realize that I suck at pretending that roasted malt smells like chocolate."
""
"O- This beer is unbelievable considering its price, such a great value and perfect example of an RIS."
""
""
"O-- really very good."
""
"This is one of my go-to stouts. Always a solid stout no matter the vintage. I find that more chocolate/vanilla notes come through with a little age on it. Looking forward to saving the rest of the 4 pack I purchased for a few years down the line."
""
""
""
""

"D - The RIS exceeded all expectations. The flavor here was everything I could have hoped for and then some. Although this stout couldn't be much bigger, it was still easy to get through. Certainly one I'll be having many times more, and well worth the hype."
"O - This stout is power with flavor and punch. I'd say the alcohol is a bit too much, but without it, it wouldn't be the same. Also, it's a specific occasion type of drink. I had it now just chillin at home, not really the right scene for it. But I also had this on a more relaxed NYE in a hot tub and it was fantastic."
"I drink this on draft here every winter. One of my favorite seasonals. Highly recommended."
""
""
"I have heard a lot of good things about this stout and I made a special effort to get a bottle; first impressions are very important, as I poured this stout into my 12 oz. mug I knew that I had a winner in my hands. I immediately tested the nose, it registered a strong bitter brew, scent of chocolate, roasted barley and chocolate malt came to the forefront and it was confirmed by the palate. Head retention is minimal with light lacing in the mug…I like this stout a lot, it goes down warm and is thick to the palate; next time I have it I will drink it in a sniffer glass and sip it slow just like brandy. I highly recommend it….and remember folks support your local brewery DRINK BEER. HOG."
"O: Brooklyn beers are usually good. This one is even better ;)"
"Pours jet black just like used oil with no light piercing at all which leaves a cappicino laced two finger head that stays and leaves lacing here and there,the smell is roasted dark malts,chocolate fudge,oak and a touch of dark coffee,the mouthfeel is full and creamy with tastes of dark belgian chocolate,arabica coffee beans,a touch of woodiness,herbal hops and finished with a distinct cappicino bittersweetness and overall what a brew this is it is the perfect nightcap with the chocolate taste of a nice mocha and only the slight warmness from the alcohol definately one to recommend and will buy more of cheers."
""
"But just when you've virtually given up all hope more intense roasty complex meaty aromas creep up on you with a medicinal gauze quality which just makes it really quite delicious. Still, by the time this almost perfect nose comes to the forefront its almost too late to push this into the realm of excellent. Still, I could whiff this little baby all night."
""
""
""
"Full body with some prickly carbonation, though it's silky smooth on the tongue after the initial carbonation attack. Alcohol is completely hidden after two years of age. Pretty good RIS, though it's a bit of a one note in flavor."
""
"O: I really enjoy this brew. The look and aftertaste do it for me. Each sip leaves such a wonderful taste that lingers forever, and the higher ABV allows this beer to have a nice warming taste and effect."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with hazelnut highlights around the edges, with a thin, foamy, sparsely covered biege head. Aromas are rich, with dark chocolate and booze in the forefront. Good roasted, coffee, and slightly meaty characteristics in the nose, as well. Flavors are bold, with a dark roasting feel overall, and a rich, chocolatey backbone throughout. Alcohol characteristics sharpen the palate a bit, with rich, dark molasses and slight licorice flavors. The aftertaste is mostly roasted and chocolatey, with a steady bitterness that curbs the booze content in the mouthfeel. The beer is rich and smooth, with a slight lacing left along the glass. The beer has a drying finish that ends short, leaving a slight slick feeling in the periphery of the palate. Great beer."
"My 800th review."
""
""
""

"Smell wise, it smells as if you were baking a coffee infused chocolate cake. It is very roasty and smells quite sweet, which when you taste it, is quite different. It is a drier taste, with a very strong cacao-coffee taste. On the back end of it you can definitely taste the alcohol, and lets you know what you are dealing with. It is a heavy drink, but not very syrupy by any means. The head has a real nice brownish hue to it, and makes for a great sit-back-and-relax beer. It is exactly as advertised, heavy, chocolatey, and a spicy stout that is definitely worth your time devoted to it."
""
"O- I felt this beer was average at best for the style. The alcohol takes over the taste of the beer once it starts to warm up imo, so I think its best to drink this cold. (unless you like the alcohol taste)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Really well done. Will gladly be looking for more of this one."

"This beer is more suited to be consumed with a meal but will work with reading or conversation. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout would also pair well with a cigar."
""
""
"O: Wow! This has over a year on it, and man is it good; great boozy, chocolatey beer"
"3 finger tan frothy head with lots of lacing on a jet black body with no light passing though. So as I smelled this one I was waiting for chocolate which is definitly there but I was pleasantly surprised by the cola aroma that I got. Vanilla and earthy notes are there too. The flavor is mostly a robust roasted malt with chocolate notes, mostly in the finish. Not as dynamic as the aroma but very smooth as drinkable. Mild hops as well. Full bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a highly drinkable russian imperial stout, the booze are well hidden."

"For the price, Brooklyn's BCS is a fantastic treat. The alcohol is hidden behind chocolate and smoothness but, for the style, I want just a little more. All in all, this is a solid stout with great drinkability that only really falls short on appearances and mouthfeel."
"O - I think this is my first ever RIS and it was really quite enjoyable. The two part taste of sweet, dark fruits, followed by roasty, bitter chocolate was very delicious and left me wanting more than the 12 oz. I had bought. During the Winter months, I think it would be tough to find a better RIS than this one to keep the chill away. This is a beer that I'll definitely purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The finish is semi-dry dominated with deep roasted malt and some hop bitterness. All throughout the stout the chocolate flavor pulls through. Not a session drinker, but I certainly recommend it on a night you want something to balance out a great meal or beer on the softer side."

"I thought this stout was going to make my short list of 'epics' based on how it smelled, and looked after I poured it. Amazing appearance and dark chocolate aroma. Upon tasting it though...where did the chocolate go?!? Damn! Still a real tasty stout but I was let down by the fantastic aroma and I just couldn't look past what I thought it should have been. Aging some of this to see if that changes things at all."
""
""
"Overall, this brew is has a great presentation, but a taste and feel that isn't quite all there. Chocolate flavors from the scent aren't quite as prominent in the taste. A very solid beer in the end."
"O - A solid RIS for me. You can't go wrong with this one if you're in the mood for a RIS."

"O: A good RIS. Nothing special except I guess it's easy to get and fairly cheap on the East Coast. Could use some age."
"Overall a superbly blended brew that combines a great chocolate and coffee flavor, with a nice alcohol warming sensation."
""
""
""
"The beer appeared to have a thick, creamy appearance with a thin dark brown head. Aromas are heavy with alcohol, vanilla, chocolate, strong black coffee, maybe espresso and cream. The taste had a strong taste of alcohol and a bitter dark chocolate with mocha. The mouthfeel is pretty crisp and carbonated at times, which I found refreshing in contrast to the general creamy body of the drink. Overall, a fantastic, sweet beverage for a cold night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Great Beer. I would definatly buy this again. I purchased two one to drink now and one to age for a while. Interested to see how it changes over time. Love the notes of burnt coffee and dark chocolate and the look of the head. This is the best beer I have had by Brooklyn Brewery."
""
"A delicious beer that I look forward to aging to see if the tastes/flavors mature."
""
"O: Seriously good chocolate RIS. Pretty much the benchmark of the style while being easy and cheap to obtain. Last time I had this I felt it was quite boozy but I don't really notice that now, despite the freshness. Guess palates change. The only real reason I don't give this higher ratings is because it IS fairly one dimensional - or at least the chocolate overpowers the other dimensions. Doesn't mean it's bad, it's still excellent."
"I like this beer, but I could take it or leave it. It's a little one note with the chocolate I wish it wasn't quite so carbonated."
""

""
""
""
""

"This is a truly complex beer with wonderful after dinner chocolate goodness and a 10% ABV to boot. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice brew overall. The chocolate flavor is very pleasant and the brew itself is well balanced - not overly sweet or bitter. The only thing I didn't like was a slight metallic-like flavor. It's not a dealbreaker though and the brew would go great with a chocolate desert!"
""
""
"O: This is a good stout. I would call it close to being a tie between this and the Big Eddy. The Big Eddy looked and smelled nicer than this beer, but this beer tasted better and had a slightly better mouthfeel."

"Had this on tap at Surf Restaurant in Portsmouth, NH. Jet black appearance with a nice creamy head. You notice the smell of chocolate right away but also a nice roasty aroma emanates as well. On the first sip you taste the chocolate and maltiness right off the bat. It is just sweet enough. You also get the slight taste of alcohol without it being overpowering. The flavors compliment each other very nicely. Very smooth, velvet like feel in the mouth. I am a big fan of this style of beer and was very pleased with this offering. Was surprised to see it was at 10% alcohol! Very easy beer to drink and throw back a couple which could become dangerous at the alcohol level."

"Toffee-espresso roast aromas dance around, and pair off with a roasty dark chocolate flavor along with some heavy coffee notes. There’s a noticeable alcohol booziness (whiskey? Bourbon? Barrel aged?) that hangs around. It has a dry finish. A thick beer, yet easily drinkable."
""
"M: Syrupy chocolate and boozy complexity, the stout still beats many on the market."
""
""
"Had this one again on tap and this time the flavors were more amazing. The chocolate notes just burst out of this beer. It was velvety and smooth on the palate and just a fantastic beer. On my last review in Nov. I said that it might be better if you hold it in the cellar and drink it next year. Well I am changing that plea to ""only if you can't get it on tap"". Fantastic brew."
"Overall - Really like this RIS. Seems very similar to Old Raspy to me but a little more hop presence and a little less smokey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really enjoyable beer. Wonderful balance and delectable flavor. Great beer for a great price. Easily my favorite Brooklyn."
"This should be somewhere between 4.5 and 5.0 for overall greatness. This beer is awesome! It pours black with a short-lived when poured into a pint glass with some lacing. The smells of sweet dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts are exquisite. The chocolate didn't really come through on the taste as much as I would've expected (especially given the name). I also tasted some coffee and burnt malts which tended to linger. It had a thick and heavy mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation. Didn't taste boozy at all. I really, really like this BIG beer, and it is absolutely worth trying if you're into stouts."
""
""
"O: Tasty desert stout that is easy to enjoy. Has decent body ,as a stout should, without being overly filling. Love the chocolate taste though it makes it easy to forget that this beer is up to 10% ABV. Super rich and sweet but dries you out at the end."
""
"O: This is a good impy stout and it is great at what it is says it is...a chocolate stout. If you like chocolate you will like this beer. Myself, if I am buying an imp. stout I would prefer a bit more going on flavor wise. That being said I really think this 2011 version could benefit a year in the cellar to mellow out that alc. burn."
""

"O- I had been wanting to try this for a long time, and I'm extremely pleased that I did. This is an amazing beer, and such a smooth RIS (especially with such a high abv)."

"Pouring into a tulip glass, the viscous body is noticeable; it looks to have the consistency of whole milk. A thick, light brown head lasts for several minutes. Prominent bitter chocolate aroma, followed by some black coffee and toasted malt. This carries through on the palate, although chocolate flavors are present they are not cloying and do not overpower the roasted malt. The very thick body creates just the right mouth feel for a beer that tastes like this. Long finish."
"Over all buy it, drink it and repeat seveal times. This will never be a disappointment and it fresh."

"Pours black with a thin veil of tan/light brown head; a good amount of lacing remains behind, and nice legs course through the surface of the liquid. The aroma is of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, a hint of vanilla, cane sugar, and a touch of coffee. A roasted note is present throughout. It tastes of dark chocolate, faint vanilla, a touch of caramel, roasted coffee grounds, cane sugar, and some muddled grains. The chocolate rush up front is delicious, and throughout the sip this one does not disappoint. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected, but that only adds to the drinkability. Finishes surprisingly clean, and ample carbonation keeps the otherwise syrupy texture lifted nicely off the tongue. Overall, a very good stout that I really wish I had local access to. Would certainly love some more of this one!"
""
""
"Every bit over the top and imperial. A slick and somewhat creamy mouthfeel make this an enjoyable stout in small doses. One or two at a sitting should suffice. Might work well to cut this with a dry porter."
""
""
""
""
"O: Drink this at cellar temp, not insanely complex but really f-ing tasty. Great price point, Brooklyn is under appreciated."
"O - I had this bottled years ago and don't remember it quite this good. Is it the nitro? Is it better becuase its fresh? Maybe both factore into this. But I know that what I'm tasting now is as good a RIS as anything else out there. A must try."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable and I will purchase more (to me, that is the real test)."
""
""
"Overall this is very good RIS in my opinion. Probably within my top 5 of RISs. The aroma makes for a buildup and I'm not quite sure the taste can deliver. But surprisingly it does and then some. The taste is wonderful, rivaling some of favorite RISs. Great beer that I'll have to look into cellaring some more of."
""
""
"Overall I was hoping for more. I haven't had this in a few years but remember it as darker. I guess I'm just jaded and have a palate ready to drink concrete at this point."
""
""
""
""
"edit: best consumer fresh, or relatively fresh. we opened a bottle from 2008 last night and it was way past its prime, thinned out and lacking the depth that makes this a classic. dont forget about this one in the cellar."
""
""
"O- It tastes a little more bitter than I expected, but I'm not disappointed."
"I poured this from a 12 oz bottle to a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. This imperial stout was pitch black with a thick light brown head that faded to a thin lacing. I didnt get much of a smell from this. Faint scent of chocolate and alcohol. The taste is similar to the smell, it has a high boozy flavor. I like this beer, but i thought i would like it more. I didnt taste the chocolate i expected ."
"O: Awesome imperial stout. A nice sipping beer @ 10 % alcohol by volume. This beer would have been if I had aged it for a while – but very tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""

"O-Not my favorite imperial stout but still very good. Packs a ton of flavor and definitely worth trying"

""
"O-Pretty good. Not what I was hoping. But still a nice beer. I can enjoy this one pretty easily. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good high alcohol stout. Definitly lives up to the chocolate name."
"O: The mouthfeel is would lend to high drinkability if it were not for the booziness. Nonetheless it is highly drinkable for a big RIS. Not a session beer, nor should it be. Well worth repeated visits. I like it a lot for the price and the ABV."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pitch black, almost shiny/oily. Small mocha head, retains well, leaves lacing. Deep chocolate scent with malty notes. First sip is a great feel, positively light with a delicate smoothness and moderate carb. Hoppy finish preceded by subtle chocolate notes, rounded off by a malty burntness. There are many better of this style, but not many beat the value (7.99/4pk in jerz). High alcohol content is fun."
""
""
""
"Has that dry characteristic that helps remind me of baking chocolate, and good carbonation levels. Overall I rather enjoyed this brew. Sadly, it is not at all available in my area, otherwise I would definitely consider getting it again (cost of course being the mitigating factor). You can certainly taste the alcohol, and I probably wouldn't drink more than one of them in a sitting, but I would absolutely drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent stout, it lives up to its name being much more chocolate in flavor with very few coffee notes. Again a solid beer but nothing special and nothing that makes it stand apart from other stouts."
""
""
""
"I love Brooklyn beers, but this one is just decent."
"This beer is balanced extremely well and is not overpowering. There's the perfect amount of roasted malt flavor that fades wonderfully followed by subtle hints of chocolate and a mild lingering bitterness."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I still think the potential is here due to the flavor and aroma of this beer, but it comes off as a porter to me, and a slightly burning one at that. I have my 4 park for the season and can't claim I want more."
"Overall: this is probably one of my favorites from Brooklyn Brewery that is readily available when it is in season, and I suggest hunt some out before its all gone. I will be getting more soon and next year as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic fresh. Amazing aged. This review is of fresh BCS. The fact that this beer is so ingredient heavy would make one expect for the palate to be bogged down by malts, but the hops in this beer (when fresh) balance the flavor and leave an almost wet/salivating sensation after each sip. Top notch beer."
""
""
"An excellent winter sipper, this is layered, luscious, and complex. One of the first russian imperial stouts I sampled, to this day it remains a favorite."

"Grab this one before it's gone!"

"Wow, I gotta say I am knocked out by this beer. This thing costs less than 2 dollars a bottle! Probably the best bang-for-the-buck in the style you can find, certainly the best I can remember."
""
"O - Really a nice beer. Looking so much forward to this a year or two down the line once the bite is gone. Regardless, such a good beer for roundabouts $2 a bottle (from a 4pk)."
""
"Overall, good stout, i like it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Excellent RIS for the price point. It's quite drinkable as it stands, but I think this would be super-drinkable in a year if I could make it last that long."
"Overall: This one's a sipper, folks. There's nothing more perfect than sitting at home on a cold night with a boozy stout like this. In my mind, this is the quintessential RIS."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, and since I am out of beer after this one, I hope there is still some left at the tw. I really think this ris is one of the best ever. So happy the local tw had a big pallet of these left. So I bought 2 cases!!! Merry xmas and Happy new year. lol"
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a quality beer that's for sure. It isn't what I expected from the hype however. I like the beer a lot and I would buy it several times over but I guess I expected something more after hearing about it so much. A thicker mouth may change my mind and do it justice but until then it is what it is."
""
"O: I think this is a great late season seasonal beer. Actually... I feel like this could be an all-weather beer if Brooklyn wanted it to be. The flavors and feel of this beer are spot on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer that I will look forward to ever year. The chocolate flavor reallly comes through in both the nose and taste."
"O- Not as chocolately as I was expecting, but a great beer with uniqueness and great drinkability."
""
"O - overall a great IRS, really enjoyable beer!"
""
""
"On the tongue, the story was the same. Big, solid base malts supporting just enough chocolate to satisfy this choco-holic. The body is appropriately full and smooth, but again the alcohol presence took a bit of the happy away. Drinkability is dangerously excellent. I have drank 2 22oz bottles in a sitting before (and I rarely have more than a pint of any 1 brew at a time) and will happily drink this beer most any time. Overall, a true classic of a beer. A must try if you haven't."
""

"o: A solid RIS and a great value to boot. Looking forward to aging a couple of these. Still very smooth and drinkable fresh. Drinks a bit hot but did not bother me at all. A nice way to take the chill off a cold autumn evening."

""
""
"Pours black as night into my pint glass with a frothy, tan colored head. The roasted malt aroma is creamy, with hints of milk chocolate and a touch of coffee. A sharp, yet subtle sweetness is present in the background as well - could it be from the esters or perhaps from hops? As the extremely full bodied beer coats my mouth, pleasantly bitter dark chocolate flavors erupt at first, with a bit of raisin, giving way to a dry spicy finish. As I drink, the head clings to the side of the glass as it should. This beer really warms you up, but I wouldn't say it is not 'drinkable...' I put mine away rather quickly! I'll definitely get another six pack before the winter's out this year!"
""
""
"O – Overall a really nice stout that’s big on the chocolate. I will continue to enjoy as I work on this case!"
""
""
""
""
"Serving: Bottle"
""
"Overall: Black Choco is all over. I've had horribly bitter versions of it and smooth and creamy pints, both in tap and bottle. It changes between seasons and serving types. Last week I had a bottle of this current year ('11-'12) and it was beautiful. This growler is too bitter but still alright. What will be next? It is, in any case, a mighty drinkable beer, and always a good deal. No trace of 10%, I could polish a growler of this and still stand tall and strong."
"O - Dessert in a bottle. Very smooth."
""
"I've only ever had this brew on draft and after reading the great reviews on here I think I need to try it out of the bottle because the draft has never done anything for me."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pitch black pour with 1+ finger of dark tan head that stayed around for a while. Minimal lacing, but a beautiful beer. Smell is quite complex with coffee, molasses, raisin and some notes of vanilla and chocolate. Very favorable aroma following turkey dinner. Taste mostly followed the nose, but had a good bit of licorice on it. Was wanting more of the chocolate to come through. A little boozy, but too be expected with the 10% ABV. A pretty good balance otherwise. Mouthfeel is what you would expect from a RIS. Thick and creamy a bit of silk with adequate carbonation. Overall- A can't say this beer was fantastic, but it is a very good sipper to close out a chilly evening. Wanted more chocolate and coffee and less licorice. Solid effort from Brooklyn and I would have no problems hitting another after some aging. Quite Tasty-"
""
""
""
""
""
"The aged beer is really quite nice. Very complex, balanced, and quite flavorful. Aged, this beer is wonderful - so complex, so delicious. With a year on it, this is one of my favorites."
"Overall: A little less balanced than some Russian Imperial Stouts, but overall very flavorful and complex. I love beers than linger, and this one sticks around. This one is a heavy meal."
"Sorry for the brief review. Turkey time!"
""
""
"D: Quite low, but it's good like that. You don't want to gulp something like this down too quickly and not leave any time to enjoy it."
"There is a sticky, chalky feel to this beer. Full bodied, creamy, modest carbonation, and the alcohol is not well disguised, which is unfortunate. I like this beer quite a bit, and am glad to have the rest of the 4 pack to finish. At $7.99, this beer is a steal. I think I will age some of this. I think it will be really good with about a year on it."
"A note on aging - at one year it was nearly impossible to tell apart from fresh; the biggest difference was in aroma and there weren't any notable improvements."
""
""
"Not bad at all for my first brew from Brooklyn. Would definitely like to seek out more of this one sometime."
""
""
""
"O: a good beer, sot one to go out of the way to get but if found, give it a whirl"
"Overall though, I really liked this beer. It was a pretty good price at like 7 bucks on sale for a 4 pack at Specks. I'm definitely excited to have another. It's not a necessity to have this beer, but if found at the right price, I say go for it!"

"This thing has a big body and lots of clingy lace. Pretty outstanding and unique brew."

"Overall, I enjoyed this side by side tasting. You would have no idea that these are the same beers or even from the same brewery. Neither is a star for me but both are solid beers. I think I would probably imagine a vintage in-between these two would be the best. Probably a bottle with 2-3 years on it would be the best balance of flavor in my opinion. A solid beer either way that is often overlooked because it is so readily available."

"Talk about a beer that masks the taste of alcohol, shits amazing esp for the way it smells. The 10% surprised me at first esp for the price(7.99 a 4 pk) and the aroma was slight coffee the rest alcohol, wasnt my favorite. Then I tasted it and it was smooth as can be, Touche Brooklyn you stumped me there. Or at least surprised me."
""

"Pours stout dark with a two finger tan creamy head that seems to be sticking around. Aroma is chocolate malt balls, grains, dark chocolate, and some dark fruits. Smells amazing. Taste is dark chocolate all the way. Nice and sweet, yet noticeably bitter. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but not overwhelming at all. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with tepid carbonation. Overall, very nice brew. My main complaint is that this is pretty one dimensional. The dark fruits that came through in the aroma are nowhere to be seen in the taste. Bitter dark chocolate is the most dominant flavor here. Nice for the price, but there are many other RIS/Chocolate Stouts that are better."

"All in all I ended up having 6 of these bad boys and went to the store the next day so I could bring one home to SD for my friends to try. Well done, Brooklyn!"
"O: Not an every day stout, but it's nice as a desert stout due to it's incredibly rich dark chocolate flavors."

"Enjoy."

"Over all good, good, good. Real close to great and maybe it will excel as a cellar beer. The only reason it got a half point less in taste was limited complexity of flavor, but still quite a good beer."

"O-a delicious RIS with nice flavor and balance"

"Poured a dark, dark black, with a very small amount of brown head. Smelled of roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste was more of the same, although at 10% ABV there was a little bit more of a flavor of alcohol than I would have liked. This isn't to say that it wasn't good, but I'm not sure if I'm going to make this one of my everyday stouts - it's a big beer."

"This is a very dark beer. No light passes through the glass with this one. Very small head when poured right down the middle of the glass. Aromas of burnt malt and light hops. I tried this cold out of the cooler and let it sit a while and warm up. Taste was very malty with strong accents of burnt grains. I tasted no chocolate flavor whatsoever in this brew. Not a favorite and for my money not in the class of Founders' stouts."
"Overall this is a very good example of a chocolate stout. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously Gordon Ramsey has a lot to learn about beer after seeing him spit out this great concoction."
"T: a boozy stout; roasted grains dominate; very, very flavorful; not very hoppy; moderate sweetness; interesting layers of flavor come and go in a mouthful; definitely worth sipping and brooding over"
"O- A great RIS. Really looking forward to trying an aged one."
"Overall: Intense and as black as can be, no wonder it's a seasonal! Try it if you think you can handle it!"
"Final Thoughts-This stuff is excellent. I would say it’s not necessarily a well balanced beer in the sense that it is so sour, but the flavor intensity certainly matches the body. Nothing overwhelms the other. This is really great but only if you plan on drinking no more than one beer. Note the alcohol percentage, this stuff will knock you down, it’s a lot more than it sounds like. This particular brew is seasonal so grab it while it’s still on the shelves!"
"Overall: This was significantly better on tap than it was in the bottle. The unpleasant booziness in the nose and flavor were both thankfully absent, allowing me to focus on the better parts of the beer. This is still kind of a one trick pony as far as imperial stouts go, but it was enjoyable."
"O - A delicious imperial stout that is also relatively affordable. Recommended!"
"Overall - This beer was a pleasant surprise, I've heard good things about Brooklyn Brewery for years, but I've never really been very impressed by any of their offerings. This changed that though, this brew was quite complex, effectively hid the high ABV, and left a wonderful dark chocolate taste in my mouth well after finishing the glass."
"I found 3 of these in my fridge from 09-10 and I haven't had this beer since so nothing fresh to compare it to. I will say that this beer has aged wonderfully and is an exceptionally smooth, easy drinking RIS. I'll have to buy some fresh this year to compare."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, as the style should be. It has medium carbonation."
"The selling point is that this is a great value. I'd be a fool not to give two Schlitz for this."
"O- This is a very very good beer worth seeking out. It was a bit sweet at first, but the body and the flavors in the finish are spot on."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth. Finish lingers with chocolate and slight tartness."
"O: a really incredible brew, tastes phenomenal, looks just as a good, just so well rounded and incredibly complex, i only have one bottle in storage now but im thinking im gonna need a case to really see what this brew can do many years (im thinking 20) down the road, too impressed"
"O - very smooth and chocolately for the style, so I guess its not a misnomer. Mellow for the style yet still distinct and characteristic."
"O: A very good example of the style, but not as complex as it could be. I was expecting this aged version to have developed more tiers of character by now. But in all fairness, I've never had one fresh to compare. All that said, I would definitely drink more of this...especially at the price point."
"O - Certainly one of Brooklyn's best beers. A seasonal that teases you all year long until the holidays. I'll be aging two of these babies for sometime. Get it now while you can! $7.99 for 4 in Central New York."
"O- A good RIS, but certainly not my favorite. Getting it once a year suits me just fine, quite honestly."
"O: 4.0. I really liked this beer."
"Overall: Good stout to drink on International Stout Day 2011. Great way to to end my night because you'll definitely not want to drink anything else after drinking this 10% ABV bad-boy."
"12oz bottle aquired in a trade with davey101. out of the bottle it pours a black color without any light able to get throw it, with a light brown head that goes away super fast. smell is of dark dried fruits and chocolate, with a woody and roated coffee. The taste upfront is cherries and bitter with a huge amount of chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel lives a little bit to be desired. This beer is not as thick and flavorful as I had expected from the great ratings it recieving. It was just alright for me."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into American Pint"
"cheers"
"Overall: In many ways this is a very good beer, but it has been roasted within an inch of its life, leaving a strong burnt taste. Considering the style and my expectations, I am somewhat disappointed. I will need to cellar my other bottles and see if the charred taste and chalky feel improve with age."
"O: Good, not great. I have a couple more bottles that I'll enjoy, but I'm unlikely to pick up another four pack till next year."
"Overall: For the price this is exceptional, lots of flavor and you can get them in 4 packs. There was a lot of hype about this beer, but in my opinion it exceeds the hype."
"Very nice overall, and at the price it could be my go-to stout."
"Pours a dark black with more than a finger of head and decent retention. The aroma is slightly malty, but nothing to write home about. The taste is robust and malty, but this offering lacks the roasted bitterness I enjoy in a good stout. This may be a beer where the reputation is better than the actual product."
"Overall: A great imperial stout. One of the best out there and you can't beat the price."
"Poured a jet black with a dark mocha head; very little retention or lacing. Aroma of brownies! and dark malts. Roasty taste, dark malts and bittersweet chocolate, with hints of coffee and a pervading booziness. About medium in body, perhaps just a little too on the thin side for the style, but still pretty good, and definitely quite drinkable. Probably the best beer I've had from Brooklyn."
"Full-bodied with light carbonation. Creamy. This is a delicious beer that is dangerously drinkable. I love having this one in cold weather. Highly, highly recommended!!!!"
"Overall (4.5): I might have liked something like this to be a little fuller, just a hint sweeter, maybe a bit of oat happening in here to anchor some more intense chocolate / coffee action, and I can always use a little more head (that’s what she—no, I said), but damn this is a good beer. Those would go more along with an American Double / Imperial Stout, anyway. If someone asked me what I was drinking and said “Black Chocolate Stout” and gave them a taste, there’d be no question as to why it’s named so. This is an excellent, excellent beer, and at this price point ($7.99/ 4-pack) there’s no question that this is one of the best values around. Really great."
"Overall - i LOVE this beer because it is cheap and readily available. It is the BEST stout you can buy for the price and availability. Is it the best? no. Is it awesome? yes. Buy it. It really is a great brew and buy plenty of it throughout the winter. Thanks brooklyn!"
"Overall-The best part about this beer is and always will be it's price point. 7 bucks a 4 pack! Really glad I got a case as well, only 38 bucks. Thats 1.60, pretty amazing. Anyway, besdies the price, it's a fantastic beer for a nice cold night, really warms you up without being too much."
"Overall a great beer/Imp. Stout. I wish this made distribution to my side of the country as a seasonal. Although it seems you might not want to sit on this one, because mine was fresh, Winter 11/12 and I really liked it. My buddy, who loves stouts, didn't like it too much with a year of age on it."
"O: Wow, this beer is delicious, and dangerously so at 10%. Perfect on a winter night or with dessert. Black Chocolate Stout has never disappointed me and this year is no exception. I look forward to enjoying this beer all winter long!"
"O - A great brew and for what it is it can be bought very cheaply...been a fan for a while but finally got the urge to review"
"Overall: The name of the beer for me was a bit misleading because I expected big chocolate notes and they are just not here. Maybe because it is a year old so i will take a second look on this one with a fresh bottle"
"O - In my stout hierarchy this one is solid, not the best or the worst. The price is what is very appealing, a great value."
"O: Very solid RIS. Pretty easy drinking for the style. Decent price for a 4-pack as well and seems pretty easy to get."
"Wow, the booze is really upfront and this is a really strong tasting stout. Maybe too much alcohol for my liking as it overpowers alot of the other flavours. Definitely a sipping brew."
"Overall: One of my favorite seasonal beers and for the price you can't beat it. It also makes a really tasty cake."
"Overall: I love this beer. This year's edition, in my opinion, might be the best balanced BCS compared to the last several years. Very drinkable. If I have to find one fault, it would be that you can't detect the alcohol at all, and, at 10% ABV, that is a dangerous thing. This is a definite beergasm!"
"D: Gonna be easy to drink. Especially being in such a small bottle. I'm very happy I got a chance to try this beer!"
"Very high marks on this one...priced well below market, super smooth, tasty stout. A certain go to during the cold months. Warms the soul. Great job Brooklyn!"
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and only a minor notice of the alcohol. Enjoyabel brew that will serve as an excellent sipping beer in the winter months."
"O- Sat on this for 6 months. Kind of surprised I did not review it earlier. Very good brew. Would like a little more chocolate and a tiny bit more carbonation. May have needed this to rise in temperature a tiny bit?? Last sip definitely better than the first."
"overall - For my tastes, this is just right. The dark fruits are present, but not overpowering. The chocolate is at the end of the taste which hits you really nice. Solid beer, and the best one I've had from Brooklyn. Get's better and better as it warms and the alcohol becomes more assertive!"
"Overall: possibly my favorite stout. I'm a huge fan of Convict Hill's Oatmeal Stout, but the low ABV in that brew makes it difficult to judge in comparison to this. This stout doesn't have the annoying over carbonation that some of the higher ABV stouts have and the smooth nature of the brew is almost too good to be true. I'll be buying another 4 pack and will let it age."
"O- full flavored chocolate stout ...and a good one to sip and enjoy as it warms in the glass"
"O - Solid chocolate stout. But its def. not Milk chocolate or anything, the bitter black chocolate is truly the star here and its delicious."
"O - Has a bold roasty flavor to the point where that is really all you can taste. With all the bitterness and acidity it almost reminds me of a strong french roast coffee or a expresso. Very nice beer!"
"Notes: This is one of the more balanced imperial stouts out there. Full-bodied, with complex flavor and a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is damn good! Even at 10%, drinkability is superb. By far my favorite offering from Brooklyn to date."
"O- This is a Solid beer, nice bitter chocolate taste, perfect winter beer, really enjoyable."
"This is a well blended, very rich, delicious beer. The alcohol is noticeable but only adds to the overall enjoyability of the beer. All the flavors mesh well. I'll definitely have another one of these as the days get colder."
"Overall, this might be the best bang for your buck stout you can get. $7.50 for a four pack and this stout is sublime. I will make it a point to buy a four pack every time that I go to buy beer until it is off shelves. So you can run and tell that homeboy"
"O: Solid stout, and I'm very glad that I have three more to drink!"
"Overall : this is a great chocolate stout I'm glad I picked up a four pack. I think this brew will improve with some age on it. Definitely needs to be drank on the warm side to enjoy all the flavor this beer has to offer"
"O - The Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a delightful winter seasonal and is a must-have if you love (dark) chocolate. The dark chocolate flavors are delightful and it's aroma is fantastic."
"I remember having the same impression last year with this beer; very solid, relatively inexpensive and dangerously drinkable. I have a bottle from last year in the cellar and plan to do a mini-vertical once next years batch comes out. It looks to be a good cellar candidate but we'll see how these hold up over time."
"O- for the price, this is one of the better stouts I have had. The complexity is what did it for me. I was expecting just a ""chocolate stout"" and ended up with so much more."
"Pours black with a lofty, frothy brown heads that stays pretty consistent. The smell is dominated by unsweetened dark chocolate, roasted malt, black coffee and hint of alcohol. Tastes of bitter dark chocolate and load of roasted malt, some coffee and a slight alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is thick smooth and silky, low carbinaton and a dry finish. This RIS can hang with the best, I really enjoyed the chocolate flavors in this beer, and that it wasn't sweet."
"Overall this beer works at its given price point and is a good, middle of the road, IS. It's worth picking up a 4 pack and cellaring a couple for comparison. Just don't expect to be blown away."
"O: Some nice complexity. Still have one from last year being 'cellared'. Always look forward to this beer."
"Overall: I still don't get this stout. Its solid, don't get me wrong, but its far from the top echelon of RIS, or even chocolate stouts. It is just too boozy and unbalanced for my tastes. However, the price certainly is right."
"O: Superb beer - absolutely perfect for the cooler months. Sip on this one and watch the leaves change :)"
"O- Brooklyn's hit or miss but it seems like their high alcohol percentage beers are usually the ones that do it for me."
"Drinking the fresh 2011/2012 version of this beer. Beer is black as always with a tan head with a bit of lacing and a nice ring around the outside of the glass. The aroma is chocolate with mild coffee and roast aromas. There is a bit of caramel as well. The flavor is very nice, chocolate takes front stage, but there is a distinct fruityness that is present as well. There is also a bit of roast. This beer is pretty thick and pretty smooth, but there is a bit of maybe acidity (not sour or infected at all, maybe some acidity from patent malt?) that cuts it a bit. Good carbonation. This beer is a very solid readily available imperial stout. Got some last year, and am in the infant stages of building a vertical. Big fan."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is cocoa powder and coffee.Taste is coffee chocolate and smoked malts.Overall a decent beer that is deep with flavor.I would recommend to try at least once and I'm sure I'll buy again sometime in the future."
"A great taste of dark chocolate, sweet mocha, bitter coffee, the taste finishes with a light tinge of alcohol."
"Overall this is the best beer from Brooklyn I have ever had. It is just so tasty and enjoyable. I am glad they dont make this year round, because I would buy this everytime I saw it."
"*Update: I tried this next to a one-year old bottle and the aged bottle had a huge coffee note in the finish that lasted forever. It also had a creamy taste and a much more muted hop character. It tasted less ""bright"" and more subtle. I liked both versions for their respective tastes."
"On tap at Vine and Barley, Its black and chocolate, do you need to know more. It is a solid stout. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts in the taste. A good amount of chocolate in the noise but nothing overpowering. This is just a good all around beer."
"2009 Vintage on tap at the MN Craft Brewers Guild Autumn Brew Review 2011 in Minneapolis at the historic Grain Belt Complex. Delicious brew. Very subtile and complex at the same time. Am very excited to have a couple bottles of these in the old cellar!"
"I'm not giving up on the style since generally I like stouts and I like some RIS's, but this is not the beer for me."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall: this is a damn fine stout. It's kind of one of those situations where it's a technically great interpretation of the style that just lacks a little oomph to push it over the edge, but not like Flying Dog's Raging Bitch was for me. This beer was also genuinely enjoyable from a less intellectual place than the raging bitch was. In all honesty, I would definitely tell someone who was looking to get into stouts to try this one first. It hits a lot of notes that other stouts do and it does them all very well with maybe just a tad too much restraint."
"big thanks to mjtiernan for sending this one out. pours pitch black with half a finger of mocha colored head that leaves minimal lacing. smell and taste go hand in hand. big chocolate flavors complemented with a slight coffee roastieness. at 10% you can smell and taste the warming effects of the alochol. mouthfeel is thick and rich and creamy goodness with a slight warming on the backend from the 10%. overall i love this beer, wish i had more!"
"O: This is truly a dessert beer. And it should make for the best vanilla beer float of all time. Sweet and bitter merge, finishing sweet (too much so but what the hell). A must try for lovers of the style!"
"Overall tasty, but there is a little missing on the finish, it just gets a little thin at the end. Its a solid beer that has all the working parts that an Imperial Stout with Black Chocolate in the title should. I dug it and would buy it again."
"O: I had high expectations & was let down by this brew. Alcohol overwhelms several aspects of this beer. Some time in the cellar would serve it well."
"Had the 2010 vintage black chocolate stout at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY in a snifter glass. This very beautiful dark beer with a medium tan head had excellent lacing on the glass. The aromas of milk chocolate, sweetness, and liquor are very slight on the nose. The first sip tastes like dark chocolate, and chocolate liquor with a creamy, and slight bittersweetness on the tongue. An exceptional beer!"
"12oz bottle (winter '10/'11, bottled 9/16/2010 based on the code) poured into a snifter. Pours pitch black with a 1-finger tan head. Aroma is dark roasted malt and rich bitter chocolate. Tastes dark and rich, with a bitter dry finish. 10% ABV well hidden. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall a solid chocolate stout but a little lacking in complexity."
"Too much alcohol and the chocolate does not come in an accessible, enjoyable form. Too bad."
"O- Good beer , Chocolate flavors weren't as present as I was hoping for. Solid, but nothing overwhelmingly special."
"Overall: This is a very good stout for the price. A little more boozy than expected, but nothing too serious. Overall a good stout worth buying again."
"Overall, I found it to be a bit boozy (did I mention that already?), but liked it a bit better than last year's. I have a bottle of 2005's that I can't wait to dip into."
"Has an English rather than American feel as imperial stouts go. Balanced and nuanced but flavor-packed. Surprisingly hoppy for the style, quite nice for a change. A fantastic beer."
"O - For a RIS with no additional ingredients added this one should help set a standard as to what the style should be built upon."
"This is a fine brew with a chocolate/raisiny/toffee taste. After my first encounter with the Russian Imperial style,I expected to hate it, but it is surprisingly good. The high alchohol content could easily sneak up on you, since it is so smooth!"
"2006-7 (4 yrs old): 4.5 – Super smooth, well developed, and complex. Interestingly, the years culled some of the fruitiness of the previous years. Not surprisingly, the age also took the edge off of the booze."
"O - A very good stout; excellent for the winter season. I have had it fresh, and this aging has allowed for a much-needed mellowing of the strong alcoholic note."
"The end result is a fabulous brew: a stout that offers a little bit of everything, and does it in a well-balanced, beautifully overpowering way. Yes, this stout is not for the faint-of-heart; but if you can handle it, you're in for a treat."
"Overall, this isn't the best Russian Imperial Stout. In fact, it's more of an American Double in my opinion. But, you get what you pay for. Okay chocolate and licorice flavor, and a nice amount of alcohol. It's not bad per say, but for my money I'd rather spend a dollar more and get a four pack of Founders Imperial Stout."
"Served: July 30, 2011"
"O - There's a reason why I bought a case of this stuff. Its an amazing brew at an amazing price. My favorite RIS in a small bottle format. Can't wait to see what some real age does to this."
"Overall, really enjoyed."
"O- Overall this was an excellent beer that I was glad to finally taste. I can't wait to try another bottle in a few months to see how it ages. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance!"
"O: This is an amazing RIS. After having brooklyn's barleywine, I was hesitant, but this is an amazing brew. The flavor is the best part, however, and I wish the nose was a bit more complex. Other than that, fantastic."
"This is a steall for $8 a 4-pack. Maybe the best deal out there for such a quality beer and great availability."
"D/O: This is a fine imperial stout, based on a chocolate-centric theme, that largely succeeds at what it set out to do. While it drinks easily for a 10% abv brew, it is held back by acidity issues that are typical for the style. For that reason it is better off accompanying a sensuous dessert, than it is in a solo role as a slow-sipper."
"Tastes of espresso and the bitterness of unsweetened cooking chocolate dominate the flavor. Bitter like espresso in the back, but sweet and milky up front. Creamy, but not syrupy in the front, but crisp and zesty in the back. Definitely boozy, and at 10% it should be. But surprisingly, its not all that noticeable at first. Its masked by the delicious swirling of chocolate and espresso and dark-roasted malts to the point that it is only present in that zest at the back of the mouth. Surprisingly drinkable at 10%, this is a dangerous brew for any stout drinker and especially to those who found russian imperials to be their favorite. This is certainly a very good beer and I'm impressed. Between this and Old Rasputin, I may turn into a regular russian imperial stout drinker."
"Pours out a nice blackness with more carbonation than i expected. Great smell of chocolate malt, maybe some toffee and even a bit of licorice. Taste was a bit lighter than expected, also a bit thinner than expected, but a very tasty RIS in my opinion. Head dissipated quickly but left a pretty good lacing on the walls of the glass. Glad i had this at the end of the nite watching fireworks instead of at 3pm when the party started, the 10% caught up to me at the end!"
"O- For a chocolate stout, this beer ventures into the high ABV (10%) side of the spectrum. It's a bit more complex that some of it's contemporaries, but the alcohol is a bit obvious. Above average for the style."
"The flavor is pretty much the same. There is not a hint of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is about as full as it comes and completely coats your mouth."
"overall a great beer maybe just shy of perfection for me i really really look forward to trying more of these styles"
"O: If you love chocolate you’ll love this one. It’s got every flavor of chocolate except white. Really solid all around."
"It was'nt as chocolaty as I'd expected but that's not a bad thing at all. A damn fine beer."
"O- I'll definitely be acquiring this awesome beer again! Full of wonderful complexity, both aroma and taste wise! The alcohol is generally well hidden, except for a bit on the end, and in my opinion, this is right up there with the best of the best stouts of the world! It's so rich that it might be best to enjoy this, one bottle at a time during a sitting, but just a real enjoyment....well done!"
"This beer poured out as a beautiful black color with a brown head. The head left a pretty good lacing down the glass after each sip. The smell of the see had a nice hoppy chocolate aroma to it. The taste is rich with dark chocolate and bitter burnt toast. The aftertaste had a hoppy bitterness too adding to the flavor. The mouthfeel of this beer had a pretty good thickness and the feel was pretty oily. Overall this beer was pretty freaking good."
"O: A really good stout. Obviously if you're drinking stouts you don't plan on having too many, but the 10% makes sure of that. Certainly hits on all the high notes with the coffee, chocolate and heavily roasted malts. Nice balance and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a great beer to have after eating, I'm going to save a few and see how they taste in a few months or a year but I'm glad I made this purchase. Excellent."
"This is an extremely well done beer, and is even more impressive in that no actual chocolate is used to brew it."
"O - Beautiful imperial stout that I would not hesitate to recommend. Miles ahead of many other chocolate stouts."
"O: Excellent chocolate stout, very enjoyable."
"Bottle poured into stone tulip. Good finger of head on a black beer, not the darkest stout I've had but good color. The smell is fantastic, vanilla, roasted nuts, burnt sugar, maybe some chocolate but probably more coffee. I was really impressed with the nose. Flavor is nice as well, with bitter cocoa and coffee dominating. Roasted malt and caramel as well with a bitter aftertaste but still leaves you wanting more. The mouth feel is a bit light for a 10% chocolate stout, but the heavy carbonation probably adds to this. Overall very nice, a great option for a stout at $2 for a 12oz. bottle!"
"You would never know this beer had 10% ABV. It doesn’t taste that way at all. You don’t smell, or taste the alcohol. Back to the aftertaste; it never leaves. It just sits there. Apparently the folks at Brooklyn want this beer to be drinkable, not one you would sip. They have succeeded at that. Also hear that the longer you leave this in the bottle, the better it tastes and the more chocolate flavor will come out of the beer. It’s a great beer, that’s for sure. A true stout, and one that I wish more breweries would model their stouts after. Well done Brooklyn!"
"O: There is nothing horribly wrong with this beer, but there is nothing excellent about it either. I think it needs more chocolate to balance the high abv. As far as chocolate stouts go, Young’s Double Chocolate Stout is much better."
"Overall: I love this beer! It is everything I'm looking for in a RIS. Big roast character and good complexity. Alcohol is kept in check. Great beer."
"Overall this is a superb chocolate stout. It's comparable to the best chocolate velvet cake you can get in liquid form. The mouthfeel is right up there with the best of them as well. I could not picture a better dessert beer."
"Overall a nice drinking stout, again I prefer a little more bitterness, however, I hope to enjoy this one again."
"Rich and warming, the alcohol content doesn't add a great deal for me, it is just a bit to prominent for my tastes."
"Overall I think this is a fantastic beer, but when it comes to beers in the style I must compare this to, it falls a bit short. Too bad the brewers at Stone an Deschutes nailed the style so well the rest just have to keep trying. A definite thumbs up though and a must try if you can!!!"
"For an Imperial Stout this seems like a less than noble attempt. Might be just the thing, though, with some good cheese and pretzels."
"O: Nice stout here, alcohol heat kinda detracts a little bit from this one for me. That said, though, pretty easy to drink, easy to find, cheap. What more could you want from a 10% Stout?"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are super rich and complex and feel nicely balanced. The chocolate flavor in particular is very strong and rich. The alcohol is present, but not in an unpleasant way."
"Overall-This beer is fantastic, and wears its age well. No hops remain (except for a hint in the flavor), but the malt and alcohol are very smooth and uber-chocolatey."
"This is one seriously delicious beer. Jet black and gorgeous with a complex malt profile of coffee and roasted marshmallow. Silky and rich on the palate and the finish is pure espresso. If I dared to quibble, the nose was a bit hot as the beer warmed, but really, the whole experience was a delight."
"Overall, very nice. I imagine that this would be better with some more age on it, to allow the alcohol to mellow out further. However, it is very good as is as well. I look forward to letting the other sit for awhile."
"Not sure about drinkability. Abv in the nose but not so much in taste. Strong bitterness across the middle and late portions of the drink make it a bit harder to get through than it'd have otherwise been. It reminds me of a more refined and complex version of Rasputin in terms of availability. If I lived on the east coast this would be a frequent visitor in my fridge."
"Overall still a very good stout. WOuld probably be better with a year or two aging."
"A easy drinking imperial stout, but not overly impressed. Plenty of carbonation and great price, will get again next fall."
"D - Very low carbonation and flat, oily."
"MF- Big and creamy. Nice bold flavors that last and last on the palate. Only negative is that I think it might have too much carbonation, especially at this temp."
"O - While it does taste better with a year and a half on it, BCS is still not one of my favorite RIS."
"O - what a great beer, i will be stocking up on this one in the future, definitely recommend i would love to get a vanilla presence on this but other than that its amazzzzazing....back to the date BS there are 2 different codes on the bottle and quite frankly Gah Damnit just put the fuckin date i refuse to look up this code, fuck you i win. drink it, it's drinkable, highly."
"Pours a pitch black with a roasted almond colored head that leaves a great coat of lace behind with each drink. Smells of sweet chocolate, a small hop profile, and roasted toffee. Beer has a great smell to it. I taste an overwhelming amount of chocolate, very good amount of toffee, a slight taste of bitterness from the hops, and a slight touch of alcohol. Beer is very thick and very well carbonated. This beer is a great representation of the style. I enjoy the overwhelming chocolate flavor, and think this one will get better with age, but is drinking very well as is."
"The flavor starts with alot of chocolate and roastiness followed by a clear alcohol, a bit of hop flavor, and eventually mellowing into very nice coffee notes. The finish stays on the pallet a bit and is somewhat sharp. The carbonation level is appropriate and the body is nice. There are no off-notes to speak of. Overall, a nice example of the style."
"NOTE: The first bottle out of this 4-pack was ridiculously hot with nothing but alcohol aroma and flavor. So I tried another bottle and was shocked at the difference. I have no idea why the two bottles were so different. Maybe the next two will answer that question. [EDIT: The third bottle was very creamy and not at all hot. Very creamy, smooth, roasty brew here."
"O: What a great RIS. The complexities of the chocolate, the big roasted malts and the slight heat tie together to make a very balanced drink."
"Overall: A very solid showing by Brooklyn. I have to admit, I didn't read the small label on the neck of the bottle, and was hoping for the use of actual chocolate in this beer. The chocolate flavor, as the label says, however, comes strictly from the malt. At the end of the day, this beer is an artfully brewed, complex imperial stout, and I'm probably going to try to get my hands on another bottle and cellar it for a couple of years."
"O- A damn solid stout, definitely a great choice for chilly nights."
"Great beer for $2!! Ever since the pricedrop ($7.99/4pk), this has become a go to beer. It's a little thinner than the super rated RIS bottles, but it is also much sweeter. I see no reason to drop $12 on a bomber of Chocolate Yeti or Southern Tier when this beer is available on the shelves. Super high ABV is also well hidden; great local beer, highly recommended."
"O:I have three more of these to try so hopefully my palate is just having an off night. If the other bottles taste the same to me I definitely wouldn't seek this one out again."
"This beer pours black, with almost no head. The smell, was very present and complex, with a nice roboust alchool smell, and choclate. The flavor was complex as well, first a strong alchool taste mixed it with a smokey malt like flavor is present, then finishes with the choclate flavor. Overall very good."
"overall this is a tremendous beer. thanks for hooking me up, patrick (pgaveau)!"
"Overall: There is no chocolate in this beer except chocolate malt I think this beer is a bit misleading. Not too much chocolate taste to the beer either. I also find the beer too roasty for my tastes."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4.5/5"
"O: This wasn't all that great and I doubt I'll age more than the 3 or 4 I have left from this batch. I don't really see any aspect that improved with this beer over the years. This is still good, but it isn't great. Drink it fresh! 3.5"
"Up front is heavy, woody grape wine like character followed by rum and raisin. Next is very nice coffee flavor; it finishes with round full chocolate coating. What is interesting is each flavor seems to have both bitter and sweet characteristics. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"Overall this is a really good stout. Well balanced taste with wonderful aromas and a mouthfeel that keeps you coming back for more. takes a hit for a lack of head retention and lacing but it does look pretty post pour before the head disappears. This is a god brew and look forward to having it in the future."
"O - Love this beer. Bough a case and am happy that I did so."
"O = I am a big fan of chocolate stouts and this one rates up there. Very drinkable. I would proudly serve this to my best friends. This is the kind of craft beer that Brooklyn Brewery does well compared to some of their other concoctions."
"Overall - Good beer, but a little heavy on the alcohol. Which is actually pretty good if you're in the mood for that sort of thing. A bit unexpected, but after a couple of these I could see myself getting into the swing of it."
"O: I could drink this all night and not get tired of it. Dangerous at 10%. Not hugely complex, but very enjoyable."
"A deep brown color, carbonation is intense, voluminous tan mousse shoots to the top of the glass and a big froth sits on top for minutes. Smells is puny, weak burnt sugar and stale coffee. Flavor is better, surprisingly light bodied for 10%, but still leaves me wanting more. Dark fruits and chocolate candies are present, but not intense. Great value beer, not a prize, but great to have around."
"Overall. Kinda boozy and just a bit too sweet and sticky for me."
"O: Very good, glad I have another to age now. There are hints of dark fruit in both the nose and taste, which mixes very well with the chocolate and really covers up any bitterness. Overall a very rich and smooth RIS."
"I really like this beer. I feel that maybe with a full year or two of age, this beer will be even better. Kudos to Brooklyn Brewery. This RIS is pretty fantastic."
"Winter 10-11 bottle. Pours a midnight black with two fingers of dark khaki foam quickly giving way to thick lacing. Nose has roasted smoky peat notes, campfire, almost a acetic quality and some buried burnt coffee. No real sign of chocolate here. No real smoke on the taste, it does have some nice bittersweet chocolate, roasted and a very dry finish along with a high level of carbonation. I was waffling between trying something new or a breakfast stout, i wish i went with the latter."
"Pours a pitch black with a huge 3 inch dark chocolate colored head that fades to a small cap. Very nice distinct rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, and dark fruits. Taste is of dark bittersweet chocolate, plums/prunes, roasty coffee, and slight soy sauce. There is a pleasant coffee/dark chocolate bitterness after each sip. There is also a slight acidity in the beer. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall, this is a very good RIS. I am glad I got a chance to try this one and that I have another bottle to drink later."
"D: Scarily drinkable for 10% ABV. Can barely taste the alcohol, and it blends well with the flavors. The taste is well balanced as well, not too sweet (as some chocolate stouts tend to be) and not too bitter."
"O: Good example of the style. Nothing stands out, but I still found it enjoyable to sip."
"A very nice stout, especially to sipper during cold winter night. Quite drinkable. I enjoy the chocolate aspect and feels it softens the alcohol presence nicely. Overall, the alcohol is detectable, but not too overpowering. Enjoyable, but not a beer I have multiple in a sitting in most cases."
"Overall - this is a great, well-balanced stout. I can't say I'm too keen on the traditional flavor-hammer imperial stouts, so if you're a huge stout fan maybe you shouldn't take my review at face value. But I really like how Brooklyn BCS balances the chocolate flavor with everything else going on. Enjoy."
"Drinkability - What a wonderful brew. A great smell, mouthfeel and of course an outstanding taste. This beer is very easy to drink and even more so during the Winter months. Watch out however, 10% ABV is quite a bit. I'm picking this up again next year for sure... and yes you should too."
"O- Good beer here. Nothing really jumps out at me though. Chocolate flavors weren't as present as I was hoping for. Solid, but nothing overwhelmingly special."
"Easy drinking and smooth, I think this is one of Brooklyn's finest offerings. I would definitely have this again and recommend it if you're looking to enjoy a good stout."
"O: A solid beer, fairly sweet, seemed lacking on the chocolate forward characteristics that I was hoping for in this after-dinner brew."
"O: Drinkability is good. I considered this one over again and liked it more the second time. Initially....the sweetness is just shy of cloying but stays within reason. Later...you get the balance here and the flavors work together like a liquid chocolate cake. I raised my points and will try this again, in comparison to my standards of Old Raspy & Storm King."
"The pour is jet black with a very small quick fading tan head that leaves nothing behind. The nose is made up of roasted malts, espresso, toffee, and chocolate. Not overpowering but very pleasant. Taste is amazing. No alcohol is on the palate with plenty of dark chocolate and a bitter malty finish. Very easy drinking stout. Mouthfeel is quite viscous. Overall this is a great stout. I wish I had some fresh to see how the chocolate has faded over the couple years this has been cellaring."
"Well done Brooklyn Brewery... you have produced an exceptional stout when compared to its price."
"Overall- Great stout. Would love to try this on draft. Wish I had more time to enjoy this."
"Very well put together beer, it earns my respect and than-some. I paid 6.99 for a four pack I respect that even more."
"From the bottle to a tulip glass. Pours jet black with a very thin tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is light with mild notes of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is pretty intense. These malts are BURNT, but not in a bad way. The chocolate and coffee tone it down a little, but this is still a pretty intense brew, as it should be. Mouth is moderately thick, but not chewy and somewhat sticky. This is my favorite Brooklyn product so far"
"O: Can't really see the huge attraction to this brew, although it is really good, I find it to get lost with a lot of other RIS. Chocolate really is not showcased as I would have thought from the name."
"O: Overall, a pretty good RIS. Nothing spectacular, but very cheap and better than many RISs much more expensive. Definitely should be a staple in the imperial stout fan's fridge during the winter."
"M/D: a creamy, full-bodied brew that feels great swishing around in the mouth. Relatively easy drinking here too, though it's definitely an imperial stout. A solid chocolate stout."
"D: Although some stouts I really enjoy, this isn't one of them. Making something high alcohol without blending it more the alco flavor is too paramount. The beer flavor should be the high note not the low note against the alcohol. Maybe its me I love the chocolate and espresso notes but the alcohol doesn't make me want to have another."
"O: A great beer, one of those that really embodies a chocolate stout for me. Probably not world class, but definitely an exemplar, and not a bad value for the quality and the ABV. Everybody should drink this beer."
"D-This is one of the best examples I've had of an RIS, although there's a solid amount of alcohol this beer is incredibly drinkable, easy to finish one, maybe a little too easy, well I'm not driving anywhere guess I'll have another."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours an inky black color with just a wisp of tan foam. No light penetrates the dark depths of this stout The foam recedes leaving a tan ring which sticks around for the duration. The nose is roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa. Taste follows. Huge chocolate and coffee notes backed up by roasted malt sweetness and dark frluit. Very nice. The finish is pure coffee, and mild hop bitterness. Feel is thick and viscous which is perfect for this beer. Low carbonation lends a very satisfying creamy texture which is just exquisite. No trace of the 10% ABV is detectable making this brew dangerously drinkable. I am really enjoying this one. Highly recommended!"
"D - It's perfect for a chilly night. Nice and warming. Very drinkable. Well done."
"Deeply intense and warming as you swish this over your taste buds it's defiantly a winner. Cheers"
"My conclusion is that its got a pretty high drinkability and the taste is perfect. But as i said, i kinda miss the rugged feeling."
"Black as tar and completely impenetrable to light, topped by a generous helping of crema-coloured foam that leaves the occasional spot sticking to the glass. Strong coffee aroma with hints of molasses and chocolate. Big coffee and chocolate flavour, lots of roast and char. Leaves a lingering acidity and bitterness behind, like a mouthful of French roast coffee or espresso. All these bitter and burnt flavours are accompanied by a touch of residual sweetness, creating a beautiful balance of bitter and sweet. There's just a trace of alcohol warmth at the back of the mouth. This was quite boozy when fresh, but time and a cool dark closet have tamed it. Full-bodied with a fine, velvety carbonation that helps to lighten it. It's odd how it can feel so full and so light at the same time. I love the mouthfeel of this beer, but can understand that someone looking for a heavy and substantial RIS might be disappointed by it. 9% ABV be damned, I'd be drining a second if I had any more left. Delicious beer."
"Overall - this is pretty good, I remember it being much better about 3 months ago though. so let that be a lesson to me. 1 year is perfect."
"Drinkability: Definitely not a bad beer, but there are other examples of this style that I'd prefer. Great initial taste but the alcohol really comes through after. Still, I paid around $8.00 for the 4-pack, so it's a solid beer for the money."
"Thanks ritzkiss and liamt07. A very good beer!"
"B"
"One of the best examples of a RIS, right up there with Old Rasputin. The fact that this beer is widely available during the winter months is also quite the achievement."
"Drinkability is outstanding for a beer of such a high ABV. Most likely a one and done but it's possible to have a couple if spaced out correctly. A very enjoyable experience and a beer I'd love to see again with some age on it."
"This pours black with a nice two finger tan head that dissipates into an island and a ring with no lacing. On the nose there is dark chocolate and espresso, pretty standard, but lurking under are some figs or other dark fruit that kind of set this apart within the genre for me. In the mouth the chocolate asserts itself most with the dark fruit and espresso coming in underneath, maybe some caramelized sugar too. There is a prickly mouthfeel that works really well with the big body. For a big stout this is quite drinkable, a very good example of the style with some nice stuff going on behind the ubiquitous coffee/chocolate."
"My first tasting of this was from the 2009/2010 batch, and DAMN it was amazing. I have started to stockpile this beer to enjoy thru the years"
"D: At 10% it'd be hard to session, but this is a tasty brew and for the price (I think I was told it's $2/12oz) you can't go wrong."
"D/O - A decent chocolate stout. It was slightly disappointing to not see greater emphasis on the chocolate notes, and a more substantial mouthfeel would have really taken this brew to another level. Although BBCS cant punch like the big boys in its category, it's definitely worth a try. Assuming the price point is reasonably assigned, I'd have no qualms returning to this one as a lighter end to an evening."
"O- glad I was able to try this, if I was tempted to buy more of this I would definitely let it continue to age as the balance does improve."
"D: Definitely drinkable. Even considering the ABV, the alcohol is hidden well enough to sip a few over the course of an evening. One of my favourite imperial stouts."
"Nearly pitch black with a slight tan head and no real lacing to speak of. Smells of coffee, chocolate, burnt malt, faint alcohol and overall very clean. Taste is roasty, chocolaty, big malt up front, mild lingering bitterness with a bittersweet finish. Good weight, slightly aggressive carbonation, creamy and quite smooth. Drinks very well great after dinner drink, ABV is noticable from time to time but feels nowhere near 10%"
"I would recommend this beverage to a stout lover."
"Finish follows flavor but more of a chocolate character develops, to an end palate of espresso bitter. Nice stout with a ""sweet and fruity"" basic character. 03/11"
"I hope many get to try this wonderful brew, cheers!"
"Perfect way to chase two 10 oz pours of PtY. What a great day! I'd take this over my local easy to access Imp Stout Old Rasputin every day of the week."
" Overall the drinkability is almost to good, to the point where I want another and another. Brooklyn is one of my favorite breweries and not just because I live in NY, they make some of the best brews hands down."
"Will seek out fresh to compare."
"A very nice beer. I definitely look forward to having this one again."
"Pours black as night with one finger of tan head with good (but not great) retention. Aromas of sweet roastiness and lots of very dark chocolate, but with a good amount of alcohol holding it back from perfection. Flavor-wise, the alcohol constitutes no such problem. If anything, the high abv helps carry this multi-layered masterpiece to every last taste receptor. Super full body is very creamy and smooth. Rich, concentrated beer whose full nature takes nearly a minute to completely unfold after sipping. A great value. Beautiful stuff."
"taste: Big letdown after the stellar nose. Start is promising with a hint that the taste will live up to the smell, but a bitterness (not hops) interferes and is never balanced. Much drier than expected. This may be one i grow to love as the palate is refined."
"Drinkability: I can definitely see why this beer is regarded as highly as it is. It exemplifies the style with some smoothness and swagger, and makes for a very accessible RIS. I will certainly seek out future trades for more of this beer!"
"Unlike most other chocolate stouts I've had, this one has a more cocoa chocolate taste to it. It's not too sweet. It's actually got quite a bit of bitterness that took me awhile to understand and get used to, but the overall flavor is pretty good. At first tasting you are hit with the chocolate bitterness and alcohol. The bitterness later on is balanced with the sweeter chocolate and a roasty coffee flavor as well. I'd prefer that there be less chocolate/coffee bitterness at the beginning, but this is one of the better chocolate stouts I've had."
"The 10% mark is clear from the first sip. It's loaded with coffee and chocolate tastes, but that's only if you can see past the heat of the alcohol. It's a great example of Russian Stouts, but I can see how a couple years set aside could help this beer."
"as it warms it doesn't get any better..."
"The taste was pretty choco-centric. Behind the chocolate again was the roasted malts, followed a slight hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was thin and well carbonated with a dry finish. It was a good, but not really outstanding RIS."
"Flavor is bold, creamy-smooth chocolate. There is a slight alcohol presence in the finish (not surprising as it's a 10%). One of the smoothest Imperial stouts I've ever tasted. Just delicious."
"The mouthfeel is very thick and sticky with a medium amount of carbonation. The drinkability is good for such a huge, rich brew. It's a sipper, for sure. A great RIS at a great price point, that is also more than eligible for aging."
"Solid stout flavor. Good roast with a big malty sweet finish. The chocolate is subtle. Very creamy. Nothing exceptional but highly enjoyable. Good richness to it. Drier as it warms."
"Excellent!"
"D: Considering everything about this beer; world class. Considering the cost, this is the best Russian Imperial Stout ever! My only regret is that I didn't buy a bunch of them to put in my beer cellar - I think this one would evolve great if let to rest for a couple of years."
"D: Very easy to drink, although it isn't the most amazing RIS I've ever had."
"D: The beer has nice flavor, but I can't help but think this beer has been fermented at temperatures exceeding reasonable preservation of the malts."
"- Win! This stout is incredible. Easy to drink, doesn't taste too strong.. very smooth, and again.. multi-dimensional.. there is a touch of alcohol odor in the smell.. but it doesn't come through in the flavor. A must have! Great in a small bottle... wish I had many more to age and do a vertical!"
"Definitely not a session beer, but it's drinkability was very high and the mouthfeel was just right. Hopefully I will be able to pick some more up next winter."
"D - As stated, the bitterness of this brew made it tough to finish."
"D: A fantastic beer to finish a good night. One and done in almost all cases, like a piece of dark chocolate. That being said, I think the brewer did exactly what he set out to do, imitating a square of very dark chocolate in an RIS."
"Drink- A little to boozy for me on the drink. It was a nice beer to end the evening at 10%."
"D- Very tasty and high abv. Can only drink one bottle at a time."
"This beer pours a dark brown to black color with a think off white to tan colored head that goes away pretty fast. the smell is roasty malts up front followed by some sweet dark fruit notes that linger. the beer was cold form the tap and its strange that alcohol presence was more noticeable when the beer was cold, I think this was because the other flavors were muted. as the beer warmed the hints of chocolate came out, along with dark fruit flavors and a little sweetness from the unfermentable sugars. the mouthfeel felt slightly thinner when it was cold, but again as the beer warmed it was fuller and smoother. this is a very drinkable beer especially when served a cellar temperature."
"Drinkability: fairly drinkable, a good beer to be sure."
"Brooklyn BCS is one of my favorite RIS' of all time. I do think I like this one a little fresher as I really enjoy the alcohol burn and stronger wet paint aroma when this is less than 6 months old."
"Impression: Perhaps the others in cellar will come together in future years, the oversweet diminish. No desire to revisit until then. Not recommended, with Aphrodite, and choc. Yeti, so easily avail."
"tasty and drinkable now, but I look forward to what the other bottles can do in the cellar with some age."
" Cheers, Matt"
"Sat on a couple bottles for a year and can't get enough. The heat dissipates, chocolate comes to the forefront even more than when fresh. Any harsh edges are smoothed out and the flavors come together remarkably well. Great beer fresh, stellar beer with a year+ on it."
"D: This was a great beer. The first sip hits you hard but then you get used to it and it's great. I'd like to try this one fresh to see the difference but if you have a couple definitely try aging one or two."
"Pours a jet black with a thin caramel head that quickly disappears to a thin strip. The smell is that of malt, chocolate and coffee w/ a hint of alcohol. I'd really like the smell to be more present and bold, like the taste- but it's still good. The taste is really nice, with chocolate, coffee and malt and a tad too much alcohol taste for me. It is a 10% beer, but I'd like the alcohol taste to be a little more stealthy. Mouthfeel is great- very smooth and silky. Nice aftertaste, which lingers for a while. This is a strong beer w/ a high ABV, and I wouldn't drink more than a couple in a sitting. Really good beer, but the alcohol presence keeps it from being truly world class. Great beer though, and I pick it up and enjoy it often!"
"Overall, this is a top notch drink, outstanding even, considering it is a mass produced stout. A lovely dark, creamy taste with a bitter kick, this one will surely warm you up on a cold night."
"Verdict: This beer manages to hit many great keys with me and I praise it for it's complexity and flavor (of which the taste is slightly more varied than the aroma). Drinkability is great in small numbers and the appearance could use some very slight fine tuning (in terms of head retention and lacing), but have no doubt, this is a solid stout. A- (4.2%)"
"Overall this beer is pretty spot on for the style, however I am not a huge fan of the prunes and after a while they seemed to get a bit tedious. Interesting beer, but not quite in my alley for a stout."
"Cheers..."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. I like the balance of malt and hops, and the stout makes a solid showing without ending up too acidic on the palate to linger. That said, it could use a bit more carbonation, and it ends up a bit dry in the finish for my personal preference, but it is still a very easy drinking beer and one that I will definitely try again."
"D - Hard to say whether I could have a few of these. I'm burping chocolate. It is delicious but not sessionable obviously. I would never turn one down and I would definately seek it out."
"The mouthfeel is great as there is just enough weight on the tongue, and the carbonation reduces the intensity of this sweet stout. Exhibits a tongue coating characteristic that just begs to be renewed. One of the most well crafted, sweet Imperial Stouts I have had to date."
"A pleasant amount of carbonation makes this high abv beer quite drinkable. Alcohol bite is noticeable, so while this 12oz bottle is fairly high on drinkability, I don't think I would want more than one glass. A good beer but maybe some time in the cellar will probably do this beer well."
"D- This is not my first BCS and it will absolutely not be my last. A delicious beer in all respects."
"Well for the 10% it's pretty drinkable. However, I find beers like Imperial Stout Trooper fantastic by being able to pack so much flavor with less ABV. Great beer, though."
"I LIKE this one, but don't LOVE it. I can't fault the brew. It is nice and complex, but I guess I was expecting more after readin reviews. I like the Brooklyn catelog, but I guess my tastes have changed in the last year."
"Overall very good, but not as good as I remember it being. Probably will let the others age some and see if that makes a difference. And, good stout for the price. **Update, the flavor is great, as good as I remember, I'm putting three bottles in the cellar to see what age does to it."
"Drinkability is high. Alcohol is there but balanced well in the mix, and the flavor is great, though I'm partial to black coffee and very dark chocolate, so I may be biased. Overall, this is fantastic, and is a great example of the style."
"Very good over all. Would recommend this to any stout lover!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown. A small amount of light brown head but doesn't seem highly carbonated. Smells strongly of chocolate which is great and some lighter roasty hints off the malt. Tastes strong. Tons of dark chocolate and roast. The malts hit you hard and the alcohol content is huge. Some dark fruitiness as well. A big beer that rally needs time to cool off. Slid thick mouthfeel but too potent to be highly drinkable"
"D- Only brewed during the winter months, I should pick up more to keep on hand. This can be opened for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Cold or hot weather. By the lake or campfire. Take Brooklyn where every you go, it will not dissapoint."
"D- this is dangerous at 10% ABV. I personally like the boost taste of other RIS but this is much more drinkable. I want to drink this when I wake up. 4.5"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is between medium and heavy bodied, and very creamy in the mouth. It has quite a bit of very fine carbonation that makes it very smooth. Man, I wish I had access to this beer so I could stock up for the year. I wouldn't mind having it in the fridge all of the time. Very drinkable for the ABV."
"Pours a straight jet black, with no light breaking threw. Which I found interesting as I felt the body was not as think as some RIS in this high of ABV level. THe head formation was a bit of work, possibly the bottle. The color of the head was a dark chocolate color not very dense. The aroma was full of Dark Chocolate with a roasty coffee background. Taste was along the same lines as the aroma mainly chocolate with a dry roast coffee flavor. The Coffe in the background pushes the chocolate flavor threw and drys it out a bit. The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and the abv was well hidden but their pushing flavors threw. This brew being a RIS with a 10%abv left me wondering as the mouthfeel and flavors were not your standard. Which I loved. WIll deffinatly continue to pick this brew up in the future."
"D: It's definitely a sipper at 10%, but the booziness is by no means overwhelming."
"D: great beer. easy to drink for how big it is. this bottle was a '10-'11 bottling vintage. i have read putting these suckers away for a year really develops the flavor, which is why i have a few collecting dust as we speak."
"This beer pours an oily midnight black with a dark, dark khaki head. The smell is of burnt coffee, bitter chocolate, tree bark, tootsie rolls and lactic sweetness. The taste is of sweet milk chocolate, burnt coffee, and alcohol, alot of alcohol. It drinks smoothly but could be considered a little light for a RIS. I don't find this to be as good as advertised. The alcohol comes out far too much in the taste and after taste. The booze lingers and it's a little too sweet for my liking."
"Rich, stark chocolate with little to no booze in the nose even this young. Definitely some in the taste as well as rich ripe fruits."
"For such a strong drink, it is surprisingly smooth, but this is a drink that should be sipped, savored and enjoyed slowly."
"D: This is an excellent dessert beer. It has just a hint of alcohol taste to it, which is impressive given it's 10% ABV. Despite being chocolate flavored, it is not cloyingly sweet, which is welcome. It would be very easy to enjoy a few of these over the course of an evening, which would be dangerous."
"D - Since it's only 10%, it's not ridiculously hampered by it's booziness. That said, it's a big beer, and as much as I might like to drink it, gotta keep it under control."
"Drink ability is good for a ten percent ABV. Feels smooth goes down easy for a sipper. I am gonna crack another one open though... and sip it."
"D: I always look forward to picking up some of this every winter. It is one of the better RIS, not the best, but a very good one. The alcohol is faint but not totally disguised for a 10%, drink safely."
"Overall: An excellent winter beer. This is not the first time I have had Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout, but I never reviewed the beer until now. This stout is heavy, complex, and full of flavor. Even better, it is balanced well. I buy this every winter, and it has not disappointed me (except for when they changed from a six-pack to a four-pack)."
"Not too thin, not too thick, carbonation is right on. Definitely a nice stout, especially for a cold winter day."
"It's thick, and slightly chewy, but so delicious that it doesn't really need to be a sipper. Easily one of my favorite stouts, and I was happy to get a case this year."
"Overall a good beer but I don't know if it's top 100 in the world worthy. Id have it again if it was on tap or local to me."
"Poured a black clear - dull red if light squeaks through. Thin, dark tan head left little lace. The scent is delicious. Chocolate and dark caramel, brownies and other baked delights. Taste is dark, bitter chocolate. Biting hops and a burnt or charcoal aftertaste. Pretty heavy mouthfeel - like a slavic man with an ushanka slapping you in the throat - with that smoke taste clinging to the back of the tongue for a little too long. Overall a powerful beer that I likely wouldn't choose to drink, however the cooking value is certainly higher than the taste lets on."
"Overall, a very good beer. I haven't had it in a long time and have always had the bottled versions. I'm usually skeptical of big stouts on tap but this was quite good. I'm very happy with this beer. I highly recommend. Cheers."
"Black Chocolate Stout is a winter tradition that has stood the test of time. I look forward to enjoying it for years to come. As an added bonus, I've decided to cellar a few bottles to see how this year's version evolves."
"D-agree with other reviewers that age might make it better. I like the chocolate part of the beer and the full body but I'm not wowed by it"
"D- Would make for an excellent dessert beer. I think this might actually taste better when its cold. I let it warm for awhile and it lost a little bit I think, more chocolate flavor when it was right out of the fridge."
"D - I found that my glass was empty before I knew it. Surprisingly drinkable for it's thickness and it's 10% ABV. But overall a very pleasurable beer. I'm glad that I picked this up whenI did, I would very much like to have this again."
"D - Besides Chokolat, this is the easiest Russian Imperial Stout i have had to date. This is so good that i dont want to drink it fast and am finding myself sipping it, not because its a sipper, but just cause i want this to last. I will try to trade for this years batch and sit on it as well. A wonderful dessert beer. Having this with chocolate brownies."
"Dangerously drinkable for the ABV"
"D: very drinkable for its ABV, very satisfying"
"D- I love when fall rolls around so i can get my mits on this awesome stout! Perfect with grilled meat... or use it to make an adult ice cream float for dessert."
"Flavor wise, the chocolate is definitely there. Its an unsweetened chocolate that lingers around for a while. Nothing extremely complex or unique about the flavor, but its just a very nice roasty tasting chocolate. Its on the thick side, with low carbonation, alcohol is not very prevalent, especially given the 10% ABV this thing packs; I am really surprised, its masked very well. Gets increasingly roasty and toasty as it warms, a good winter beer."
"Kind of disappointed about the lack of chocolate in the taste after such a promising smell. Still a very, very good beer. Especially if I could drink it regularly."
"12oz bottle poured in snifter glass. Poured a midnight black color with a small tan head, leaving trace amounts of lacing. Smell is roasty, chocolate-y, and a bit fruity. Taste is pretty nice, some chocolate and roastiness, but seemed to have more earthiness from the hops than I liked. I think this would be eliminated with aging, and would increase my score. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Was a bit disappointed with this beer despite the hype surrounding this beer... I just expected more."
"The last statement has been rendered foolish by the events of the day. 1997 BCS at the Blind Tiger event. Totally ridiculous. Black, very low carb, but next to none on the oxidation. Chocolate and roast aromas seductively lure me in. The flavor is smooth, only a touch sweet, and an absolute achievement in an aged imperial stout. Totally impressed by this beer with its age, and am adjusting my score upwards accordingly."
"Taste, a chocolate one trick pony, but seems to be more about the chocolate malt than any candy type of chocolate to it. Kind of a dry ending to it. It was definitely a good beer, but really nothing about it sets it apart, or allows for its inclusion in a top 10 (maybe even 20) imperial stout discussion."
"11-1-2-12 - Cellared this one for a year and must say could have cellared a bit longer. The alocohol is still very prevelant and must say it has a somewhat freshness to it. The appearance was dark brown almost black with a chocolate head ring which hung around. The nose is of milk chocolate and dark fruit, prunes possibly. The taste is like a chocolaty expresso mix and the mouthfeel is a medium. Overall this is a solid stout. Was interested to see if the alcohol would mellow after a year and it didn't. Have to cellar another for a longer period to see how it mellows. Still a very good stout."
"D - Yikes, I was feeling just one of these. Afraid that if I had a couple, I couldn't even walk. That's the only qualm I have with this phenomenal beer."
"verdict: a great stout."
"D- YES."
"Cheers to Mr. Oliver on this brew, one of the first I really enjoyed from Brazil. Err, from Brooklyn."
"*Winter 10-11 bottling"
"Notes: The breadth of malt flavors here is amazing. Great stuff. Maybe the best tasting RIS for the price and availability. This has been a regular in my ""cellar"" since my very early craft days. The extra time on this bottle brought out some acidity and alcohol that I don't remember being there when fresh. I also don't remember the leafy spiciness being there when fresh, but I haven't had a new bottle of this beer in a while. Age does add some extra dimension to this beer. I think it would even benefit from maybe another year."
"Overall I liked this one a lot, though I'm not sure this makes my list of top-tier imperial stouts. The bitterness was a bit distracting at times. Also not sure if aging this for a year made much of a difference - kind of like waiting another year to ask a certain girl to prom, but she doesn't develop like you hoped. C'est la vie!"
"Just an okay beer -- it lacks the ""wow"" factor present in many other stouts I've tried. I taste a slightly sour fruitiness with each sip ... or maybe it's the hops -- either way that doesn't work for me. Kind of bland. This beer leaves me unsatisfied."
"The CPJ"
"Rich dark chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruits. Undertones of citrus, burnt toast, cream and floral hops."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was quite the excellent brew. There were no sharp intrusive flavors present at all which made this one very easy drinking. Had a very nicely well balanced flavor and good aroma as well. This one is a definite must try."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a Sam Adams snifter glass. Pours pitch black opaque swirls with a frothy brown head that stains all ends of the glass. The smell is amazing, smells like sweet roasted coca beans, with a hint of coffee. The taste is exceptional, dark milky feeling in the mouth. This beer screams drinkability, however, you can probably only have one or two or you will loose the ability to do anything else. This beer is fantastic from start to finish."
"Overall this is an incredible beer. It just has so many layers in the nose and on the tongue that it's just awesome. Only criticisms would be the head retention and the drinkability factor. But both of those are negligible next to the flavor and aroma."
"Drink - A delicious and flavourful chocolate beer that I am going to go buy some more of tomorrow. I like that fact that it isn't too over the top in the flavour department, leaving it highly drinkable. I'd like to have a few bottles cellared so I can taste it again with a few years on it. It's a great winter warmer or dessert beer - a must try"
"D: Very tasty stout but would not want too many of these in a night. A definite one to sip and savor. Just make sure to not drink this one too cold as you'll miss out on a lot in the aroma and taste."
"Drink - Be careful, it's 10% and it's very heavy, you might just lose your wits and do something stupid"
"Drinkability (2.5): Definitely a sipper. I wouldn't recommend drinking more than two of these. Not to mention it's pretty sweet and boozy fresh. You wouldn't know the older vintages were 10% though."
"I really dig this, but I could probably only drink 2 or 3 at a time."
"D- Slight booze burn might turn off some, but I can't slow down. Creamy, chocolately flavors make me want to keep sipping. It is a definite sipper. Rich and bold. A definite after dinner dessert beer, but not overly sweet or cloying."
"This is the ""Everyman's Russian Imperial Stout."" Prior to this relatively inexpensive brew, I didn't know if such a beer existed. This baby has proven me wrong, and changed my opinions of all that it is to be an RIS. If you don't have this beer readily available in your area, seek it out! You must have a taste of this glorious stuff."
"Overall a nice beer, though a bit disappointing. It tastes a little boozier and less flavorful than I remember last year's being. Still though, at around $8 a four pack, it remains a nice value for the RIS style."
"All around quite enjoyable; I suspect, however, that this beer may be be better with age. I remember having one that was approximately a year old, back before I started taking notes on beer, and enjoyed it a bit more."
"D: I could have one or two of these every night. Certainly not a session beer but one to truly enjoy by sipping every so slowly. There is no hiding the alcohol, but Brooklyn does a great job by attacking the palate from all angles to make you forget, even if for a brief moment, that you're drinking a bold full-bodied RIS. Top notch in my book!!"
"Drinkability is relatively high given the 10% ABV. It is a great sipping beer on a cold night and pairs well with many desserts."
"OVERALL: A very nice, easy to drink stout. I tend to like a little smoke flavor in my stouts, but not to have it overpower the beer, and this one delivered on that front. I don't often drink stouts, but when I do, I will consider this one again."
"A strong, smooth, great sipping stout."
"D: nice, not ridiculously drinkable (would't necessarily want it to be at 10% abv), but had not trouble finishing my 12oz"
"D: Very good - with the strong flavors this one goes down very nicely for 10% abv."
"Taste: malty, bitter. Palate: smooth. It's all been said; except I taste roasty expresso and citrus too. You can't detect that 10% alcohol till you try to walk a straight line. Overall very satisfying. A top notch, although not world class beer like Old Growler."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. While I was a bit worried about this beer after the overly alcoholic nose, the flavors are strong, complex, and enjoyable enough to help defer the alcohol in the taste."
"Rich bodied with decent carbonation. This beer is full flavored with darker dry malts, unsweetened chocolate, faint bitter hop. I don't taste any alcohol warmth. Great aftertaste that begs for black forest cake with sour cherries."
"Straight up solid chocolate stout."
"d - for a cold, winter night? yes please."
"I like the fact that the chocolate is really strong and present, but not quite overpowering. There are just enough other flavors to keep the chocolate in check. I also enjoy the high ABV, which is covered by the extreme flavors. The aftertaste is very pleasant, leaving you wanting another sip. Overall, this is a very solid stout, and any stout fan should enjoy it."
"Drinkability is solid - may not be to the level of best-in-category RISs, but I haven't minded pulling a couple pints back to back."
"Overall, I prefer this beer in a bottle. I can pour it myself and give it a good head and it the alcohol isn't as strong."
"This goes down pretty easy. There is both a smoothness and a bite to it, so it should appeal to several types of drinkers. It's very high in alcohol, that's the only drawback but I can't wait for another."
"Atmosphere is very good. Deep, dark, intimidating appearance. A great nose characterizes this brew. Flavor is robust and malty with the bittersweet chocolate (as the name implies). Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Considering the strength of this one, was fairly drinkable. While potent and not for the weak of heart, went down easier than other strong ones I have had. This is the first beer I have had from this brewery, and this one makes me want to try more of their beers."
"D: Again, the alcohol is present, but in a good way. With that said, it still will slow you down a bit which is a good thing. You want to let this beer warm almost to room temperature to get the full benefits."
"D: this is so smooth, the high ABV keeps it from being a multi-bottle night, but who needs it? Drinking this beer is an experience in and of itself"
"Poured into a tulip. The beer pours oily black with about a finger of dark tan head that retains nicely. The aroma is great, roasted coffee, some chocolate and dark sweet fruits to round it out. Slight traces of alcohol, but that's going to be tough to hide in a ten percent beer anyhow. Really what I would want out of this flavor-wise. It's big with sweet bitter chocolate flavor mixing well with bitter espresso finishing with a bit of heat from the high ABV. It's not the most complex thing but in this case less is certainly more. The mouthfeel is full thick and chewy, good carbonation. Solid beer but I'd be hard pressed to have more than one. The flavors are really big and it's definitely able to knock you on your ass after a couple."
"D-Good for a RIS, but not great. A plus is that it is bottled in 12 ounces."
"Had on tap at pazzos, appearance was dark as midnight with a tight tan head that stuck around for a good amount of the beer. Smell was coffee,chocolate, roasted grain, and some toasty smells of malt. Taste was wonderful a good balance of semi bitter chocolate and espresso, warming alcohol but not too much, a nice roasted grain middle and a semi sweet chocolate coffee finish. Mouthfeel....smooth as silk, a nice balance between malt and carbonation. Drinkability is suprisingly high for such a strong stout but if u asked if I wanted another one the answer would be yes!"
"Final Notes: A very good beer, and probably has the most chocolate flavor of any chocolate beer I've had. This would make one hell of a beer to pair against vanilla ice cream (hell, might even make a good beer float). Recommended."
"D- A very drinkable full-bodied 10% abv and an awesome mouthfeel"
"d-deceptively though. Have 3 or 4 of these and you def won't be able to walk straight."
"Overall a wonderful winter time warming stout. Highly recommended."
"starts off pretty damn bitter and alcoholic - but drinkable. obvious chocolate and a little bit of black licorice in the taste. medium carbornation."
"Fantastic colour and full aroma pallette, followed by an incredibly silky mouthfeel (with just the right amount of carbonation not to encourage the urge of pouring it over icecream). The taste of alcohol is almost fully masked by a robust and balanced flavour profile... Although not a stout drinker by nature, I found this bottle surprisingly enjoyable!"
"D: Yes, please. Missing my corner store right about now."
"D - Very drinkable. I'm glad I have a few of these in the cellar and that its still for sale at my local bottle shop. I will likely be grabbing a 4 pack to enjoy while its fresh over these cold winter months."
"Ummmm... I've had this before. I remember being more impressed by it. I am unsure what vintage this is... But maybe some time in the cellar would do it some good... At least as far as my picky tastebuds go!"
"[Hooray for being the 2011'th review! Just in time for the new year...]"
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink. There are better Imperial Stouts out there, but this is a solid Stout worth trying. I will be picking this up again!"
"D-The creamy mouthfeel makes it less drinkable but the 10% is not noticable."
"I had this beer the day before christmas eve and paired it with pumpkin spice ice cream. Great holiday combination. Amazing."
"I may give this one another try at another time if in the mood to give second chances."
"Drinkability- very flavorful. No more than one for me."
"D: I know the booze is there, because I can feel it, however, the balance of the tasty sweetness and the bitter hops are covering it quite nicely. I could have 2-3 of these. This is sweet for a Russian Imperial but it is extremely tasty."
"RR"
"D - Well I did get a case of this last year and it was a chore to finish. Now I just pick up a few bottles every now and again. This beer drinks great especially after a light porter or stout. Cheers!"
"pours deep and dark brown, almost black, into a guinness anniversary pint glass - puts up a 1 finger thick tan head and leaves ribbons of lace - a mildly roasted aroma followed by a nice taste of caramel and a little bitter chocolate -very tasty and SMOOTH - mouthfeel is nice and SMOOTH - appropriately thick with a roasty finish - begging for more - and not too filling - dangerously drinkable with almost no alcohol smell or taste."
"After pouring this into an open faced beer i get so excited to even try this. The coal black color is as dark as the label that comes with it. The smell is an amazingly Sweet Chocolate with a hint of roast smell? it almost smells like black licorice. Taste Is an amazing blend of sweet chocolate with a very strong after finish of coffee. Has a slight GREAT bitterness before you can taste the coffeeness in it. This is the PERFECT stout in my mind. Had this with a fresh burger and fries it was amazing. I could drink this beer warm cold hell probably boiling. the more room temperature this beer got, the better and more bitter it got."
"F/D - A thick and smooth feel, but also with a little higher carbonation than I would prefer. The alcohol doesn't come through too strong at 10%, but the bitter/burnt taste for this beer makes it a slow sipper for me."
"Absolutely opaque black with a dark tan head in a small tulip. Smells of roasted chocolate malts. Excellent levels of malt to counteract the high ABV. Not as thick as I've normally seen in the style, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This effectively crosses the RIS style with a Milk/Sweet Stout Style. It is a bit heavy, but not badly so."
"Ill say it once again, a great brew for a cold night to warm you up."
"This is a very good beer. Nice aroma, flavor and mouthfeel and hides the alcohol well for a 10% abv beer."
"D: Again, because this RIS doesn't suffer from the flaws that many do, this brew is pretty dam drinkable."
"Drinkability is really rather good, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout. Oh yeah, you're gonna feel the 10% ABV, but it's a pleasant and tasty way there, so you're definitely not gonna mind the ride. I'd love to see what this is like with a few years on it to mellow the flavors out and add a few levels of sophistication."
"A consistent performer year after year..."
"Notes: most of this beer was sampled alone, with the latter bit being accompanied by some chocolate cake for the sake of finding a solid pairing. Chocolate cake has been found to pair almost perfectly, highlighting the notes of the beer perfectly."
"I had 3 tulip glasses of this and I was off the hook and woozy at the end... I liked this better than the bottle version."
"Drinkability: Probably not my favorite stout, but for the price and the uniqueness of flavor it is definitely worth getting. Truly a beer that makes me think of winter."
"This dude lives up to the hype"
"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"Except for the 10% ABV, there's nothing to detract from a good, high level of drinkability and enjoyment is high regardless of the alcohol level."
"M/D - Body is a bit lighter than I expected, still has some weight to it though. Drinkability is fantastic, a very enjoyable drink from start to finish."
"D: There is so much that I love about this beer, but the alcohol taste is off-putting. The way it overwhelms the palate puts this beer in the realm of 2-hour sippers."
"Drinkability - A bit sweeter than I remember. Great having it on this 40 degree Southern California night. But one and done. Granted, at 10% that isn't a bad thing...and on that note I taste almost no alcohol presence whatsoever (even with it being so young). A great Christmas beer. Cheers!"
"A nice seasonable brew to enjoy that is great for the cold weather and is readily available at most places. Enjoy!"
"D - A fine tasting beer, but the booziness is a bit much. Not much effort was put into masking the alcohol of this 10% imperial, and it suffers a bit for it."
"Overall this is one of the best stouts I've had. While it can be a little boozy, it actually blends in well with the complex flavor and adds a nice dry, warm finish. This is something I'll be looking for every winter."
"2/19/12 Edit: Just had a bottle from last years batch (fall 2010) that I cellared. I didn't do a side-by-side but this bottle seemed much improved over the fresh version. Time really brought out subtle dark fruit flavors and mellowed out the booze. Cellar worthy brew for sure."
"D: The alcohol is reasonably well hidden so the drinkability is pretty good."
"Drinkability is decent, not sure I'd want more than one but one is definitely not a problem. This can't hang with the big hitters of the style, but this certainly is a great imperial stout for the value (I think the case was around $40.)"
"Drinkability - This is one big and complex stout with flavors and smells ranging from ripe dark fruits to freshly brewed espresso. The chocolate is definitely present in this beer, but does not beat you over the head with each sip. Instead, it plays a balancing role in the overall experience. All of these complexities and high ABV make this beer a great candidate for aging. I'm excited to see where this beer will go from here, especially as the alcohol mellows out. This is the ultimate winter beer that will warm you up on the coldest days."
"D - Very tasty brew, full bodied, malty and chocolate and creamy. A brew that went down very easy. A brew that I will have again. I highly recommend this brew"
"Overall: The alcohol comes out a little strong for me. This beer took me forever to finish, and it is a definite sipper. 12 oz is filling, and this stout would be a great substitute for dessert, but drinking two is out of the question."
"Drinkability - Good beer, love the coffee and chocolate over tones. Moderate weight, maybe 4 pints would be the limit. Really like it, would have more of this"
"As an aside... the bottle says Brooklyn Brewery, Utica, NY. That means its really contract brewed by Matt Brewing, the makers of Saranac... Further proving the kind of quality stuff they produce."
"D: I'd probably drink all 4 if it wasn't 10%"
"Pours jet black with little to no head, some tan foam quickly dissipates. The nose is strong roasted malt, chocolate and phenol. Taste is heavy bitter flavours of dark chocolate, sweet toasted malts. Leaves a dry mouthfeel in the finish, heavy mouthfeel. Very easy to sip on, impressively drinkable. A great way to bring in the winter season."
"Beer poured black with a medium tan head. Aroma of dark fruits and alcohol. Tasted better as it warmed. Primarily milk chocolate flavor with a subtle bitter finish. Mouthfeel was creamy. Body was medium heavy. A good stout, but too much burn on the finish."
"Drinkability... Depending on your palate your going to find things you may enjoy, its easy drinking even at this ABV."
"Overall I enjoyed this so much more from tap than bottle. Its less alcoholic and much smoother. A very solid RIS for a great price. This beer is growing on me for sure."
"12oz bottle. Poured black with a huge, brown, long lasting head. Great aroma is of dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, licorice and some bready notes. Full smooth body with dark fruit sweetness is balanced by espresso coffee, lots of burnt grain and alcohol as well. Finish is huge and dry. Great beer."
"This was not a very good beer due to the incredible sourness, I probably had a bad batch, if I see this somewhere else I will have to retry."
"A fair amount of alcohol and the style in general would prevent me from having more then maybe two."
"Pretty good stout. Ill be aging a few and comparing them with next years."
"Drinkability - It is amazingly drinkable at 10%...dangerously so. I could have a few of these without any problem whatsoever. This is such a great winter brew for winding down a cold winter night. I will definitely be purchasing more of this for when those nights come around. This is the stout that I've been searching for and I'm glad I've found a stout that I like a lot. The combination of the roasted malts, coffee and toffee aftertaste that lingers like the perfect cup of coffee in the morning. Great job BBC!!"
"D-its very thick bodied and filling. i'm not sure if the flavor is glorious enough for the high ABV to make it very drinkable"
"O - A good beer at a great price. If this was available year-round I'd probably buy more of it as a decadent treat to have once in a while."
"D- Alc well hidden for 10% abv. A good sipper. want to see how it ages."
"Black in color with a thick dark beige head that reduces to a thin beige cap that leaves wet lacings on the glass. Dark roasted malt and sweet dark chocolate aromas. Thick, viscous feel. Roasted and burnt malt flavors in the beginning, sweet chocolate in the middle and a lighly dry pine hop finish. Definitely a sipper. Not due to the higher alcohol content, but due to the intensity of the burnt malt flavor."
"Luckily, despite the dominating presence of alcohol, it never stings or burns (even in the finish) and the smooth and thinly velvety malt base helps balance it all out wonderfully. A digestif or special treat is the best way to enjoy this. Can't beat the price, either."
"continues to bring a burnt roast flavor. a little too sweet overall which brings down the drinkability."
"Well carbinated, creamy, yet finishes rather dier than expected for those characteristics."
"This is definitely a very classy brew, big and huge. The fruits are a little unexpected though... not simply because their presence, but rather because their strength."
"i could def drink this all night...but the alcohol would catch up after like two!"
"Drinkability¬¬¬-This is not a beer that you would have more than two at a time. It is on the sweet side and the 10% abv while well hidden will hit you. This is beer that you want to pair with dessert. Overall very good and would buy again."
"Notes: this would make a great desert beer to finish off a good meal."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate and malts. Taste is like the smell, malts, chocolate, some alcohol, pretty good. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"D: a sipper. Booziness detracts overall."
"D - very drinkable for 10%. Very smooth and creamy on the tongue. Once of these packs a lot of punch. Great for a cold night!"
"D= I would probably want to age this one a little more before I drink it again."
"D: OK, but one 12 oz is enough, especially with the strong alcohol presence."
"Drinkability- A delicious meal in a glass. I could down several of these, but would wind up acting like a fool as a result. It's a beer of distinct character & body (russian imperial stout comes to mind, as this is what i would call it in every way), and is a beer to be savored fireside as you ward off the winter and work to stay warm until Spring comes. This beer is a quality Seasonal that I look forward to Year-Round, though living in Massachusetts, (due to its slow selling nature), it's usually available all year round. Love it!"
"Overall, what we liked most about this beer was the rich and delicious creaminess of the mouthfeel coupled with the stark appearance and aromas. This brew delivers all of the flavors it promises and then some. After drinking it, our mouths are almost comparable to the feel of just having consumed a bite of 100% cocoa which, while tasty, can become overwhelming."
"drinkable - no not really"
"D - I think this is a really drinkable beer. It has a full body, but it seems to go down a lot easy than some stouts. It doesn't have the rough bitterness that I have experienced with some other stouts, and also it masks its alcohol content quite well. I will definitely pick more of this up"
"EDIT: WTF! This is 10%? Just bumped the drinkability to 5 for the fact that... well see above!"
"D: Really like the flavors in this beer. Great robust style and chocolate notes here. I can see how this one would benefit from some age, but does not necessarily require it!"
"Beautiful beer!"
"Overall the complexity is there; bitter, roasty and medium/moderate mouthfeel. Terrific stout. Drinkability wise it's a great way to end the day. Always been a cold weather favorite..."
"D - A little disappointed but I had high expectations. Still a decent stout but I don't need another."
"BCS is a nice, if too highly-carbonated, cold weather beer; warming yet easy to drink with great dark fruit notes that overpower and exceed the chocolate first impression."
"12oz bottle. ""Limited Bottling. Winter 10-11"". Pours a viscous black with a small, frothy head. Minimal lacing. Almost looks like a tall glass of dark espresso. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Great big flavor of dark, bitter chocolate. Some lesser flavors of the roasted malts and a bit of a coffee aftertaste. This beer is drinkable in regard to it's high abv isn't noticeable, but it isn't overly drinkable due to the big chocolate flavor. A glass of water would go along nicely with this beast."
"Bottoms up, enjoy!"
"If you like Imperial Stouts you will love this beer. Since this is an imperial stout it can catch you with the high ABV and weight."
"D - very well executed beer, especially at the price point and availability. though there are beer ones on the eyes, nose, and mouth out there, this is solid all around. dangerously drinkable for the high ABV. once had this at a beer dinner hosted by the infamous Garrett Oliver himself, served alongside a Strawberry Rhubarb crumble, and it was as devine as it sounds."
"Aroma 3.5, Appearance 4, Taste 3.5, Palate 3.5, Overall 4, Score 3.65"
"Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored foam head. Has an aroma of chocolate with hints of caramel. Has a taste of chocolate with some sweet up front and a nice layer of bitters in the back. Some complexity. Nice layering on the tongue. Medium mouthfeel. Good stout."
" Drinkability -very well blended and balanced, it's high abv% is hidden well in the flavor - Extremely drinkable - recommended as a desert stout."
"Edit: After further warming, a lot of licorice coming through on the palate."
"All in all this beer is weighing in at 10 abv so some alcohol is expected to be present but the current recipe doesn't do well in covering it. I think that this stout would be much more enjoyable if the alcohol were dropped a few points or if more effort were put into covering it up."
"This was my dessert after a steak dinner, and it was perfect. I look forward ot my next one!"
"Drinkability -- This stout is quite good. Not at all cloying as the name would suggest, but actually quite balanced with plenty of acrid malt roastiness. However, the booziness is a bit distracting. Had the beer possessed more depth of flavor and nuance it would have been more forgivable. I wish I had a bottle with three or four years on it, as I'd imagine it would be positively decadent."
"D: You might never guess it was 10% until you stand up! Very solid stout overall and amazing that it's so widely available and distributed. Another stout like Old Rasputin that is great but gets looked over because it's not hyped up like one off releases are. Awesome beer."
"D: A bit too strong -- in character and ABV -- to be drinkable, but not to be disparaged. I was craving an imperial stout, and I got one. There are, in my mind, much better examples to choose from, but the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is not disrecommended."
"Brooklyn in the house."
"Verdict: Awesome, robust unique ale. Must find if you can."
"Overall this is an exceptional beer: [bitter up front] and intense smokey/chocolate combined with an enduring malty aftertaste. Well rounded and just plain awesome."
"D - When I think of an imperial stout, I think if this beer. For some reason, I didn't expect a taste like this. It is a nice, balanced afternoon beer."
"Pours a deep black color with a thick brown head and tons of beautiful lacing. Smells of rich dark chocolate, mocha, coffee, and aromatic malts. Tastes of delicious dark chocolate, mocha, coffee, caramel, plenty of sweet malts, and a little bit of tasty hops. Mouthfeel is very thick and oily. Drinkability is very nice."
"drinkability: a great example of an imperial stout, from the well-bodied malts to the appropriateness of the balance of oaks, chocolate, and bitter notes; the abv is where it should be but the intensity of the alcohol could potentially offend a palate, very drinkable but not many drinkable."
"D - the chocolate is integrated well, the alcohol is a little dominate leaving this not the most drinkable, but to be expected at 10% ABV, worth a sample"
"pour usual thick viscous oil black with frothy dark caramel colored head. taste is so devine, much creamier and fruity than the o9-10 i had days ago. this years even taste less harsh alcohol wise. lots of ripe dark dried fruits and tons of dark chocolate roasted malt goodness."
"Well this beer is a thick black oil slick in my glass with a 1/4 inch tan head with oily looking spots of carbonation on the glass. Smells like rich dark chocolate and black licorice and a bit of steamed milk. The taste is rich, like a black forest cake, really alot of chocolate and roasted malts backed up by enough hops to balance it out. But it is a hot mess of a beer when un-aged. Really full mouthfeel, thick and lucious. However because it kinda hot and the alcohol is not well hidden I think it could use some refining."
"This was a very dark coffee colored stout. The smell was not to strong gave off a bit off dark chocolate smell. The taste was that of dark chocolate and some fresh roasted coffee. This is definitely a beer that I would like to have again. I like this beer because the after taste was like you just finished eating some good chocolate. Great beer."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but could be a little bit smoother. This beer is deceivingly drinkable; at 10.1% alcohol, it might be best to make this a sipper."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfect for a RIS. Its` drinkability is great, especially considering the abv. This is a perfect beer to pair with a rich dessert and conclude your evening."
"Carbonation is a bit heavy, along with the mouth feel being kinda watered down. Would of wished it to be more creamy, but good none the less."
"Cheers!"
"Simply delicious. I look forward to this every year. The alcohol warms your insides as you make your way thru this monster. Very complex and well balanced, one of my favorite stouts of all time."
"This brew is everything I expected and more. I'll be tucking a couple of these away to revisit in a few months to see how it ages. Perfect for a cold winter's evening next to the fire!"
"fairly high. great tasting but the booziness might be a little too much to have a couple of these. Plus it being a seasonal beer you better stock up. Be a great sipping beer when the weather gets cold here."
"This is a sipper of a stout and a pretty nice one at that. I let it warm quite a bit to see what other flavors it might bring out, but it pretty much tasted the same. This would be much better if it did not show the ABV so easily, but it is still one of Brooklyn's better offerings."
"Dangerously drinkable considering its abv."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with ABV on the bottle. Poured pitch black, with a nice tan/coffee head. Head retention is not very good, but should be expected from brews with 10% ABV. Aroma is predominantly dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Gets even better as the beer warms up, the ABV is not felt as much. Silky smooth stout, the taste is dark chocolate with a perfect blending of coffee and some roasted malty after taste. The mouthfeel, as i said earlier, is truly exceptional and so is the drinkability. It is an excellent stout from Brooklyn Brewery, which every stout lover must most certainly have. Highly, highly recommended."
"RIS that I will be trying again in a few months to see how its developing."
"This is a well-brewed stout. I'm happy, it's easy for me to get."
"Overall a good beer for the winter but there are better ones out there."
"The smell is a strong promise of rich chocolate taste, which is certainly fulfilled after tasting the beer. Very rich dark chocolate, bittersweet with hints of coffee. The roasted malts give a dominant character. The mouthfeel is a dry finish . A very drinkable beer for the cold season, especially with the combination of a good meal."
"D: it works. I don't mind this brew. Not a top choice for the style and probably wont grace my fridge door again. In any event, a good-natured brew"
"Drinkability: Definitely a winner year after year. Have cellared them for a year and seems to mellow a little a great choice after supper on a cold Ohio night."
"Somewhat thinner feel than you might expect, with plenty of stickyness. Fairly smooth, creamy touches and decent drinking, although the 10% is still fairly apparent even with a year of age on it. Definitely a solid chocolate imp stout, but not the best."
"Overall: A pretty run of the mill stout. Your basic chocolate coffee roasted maltiness. I have yet to be impressed with anything from Brooklyn Brewery. I ve heard great things about this. It's good beer for sure but nothing I would waste time searching for."
"Drinkability: I must admit I haven't sampled many Imperial Stouts. I enjoyed this beer and look forward to testing it again (along w/ others)."
"2008 was the best but all were disappointing. Flavors were bland and relatively non-existent..."
"Mouthfeel is full and smooth. Overally this is a great imperial stout, with an attractive price point compared to many others on the market."
"D: Great aroma, flavor and feel to this beer...might be a little harsh due to the alcohol, but there is nothing better on a cold winter day by the fire."
"Chad"
"Medium carbing. Drinks like an imperial stout, slowly but very smooth. I'm going to pick some of this up myself and stash it away for this winter."
"This is definitely a chocolate forward, thick beer. For style, it is pretty drinkable and nice to drink until it warms some...then, not so much."
"Hooray for Brooklyn!!! This chocolate stout is terrific. Total chocolate aroma. The taste is of you guessed its chocolate maybe lil espresso.The appearance is blackout.Doesn't have a long lasting head.O well Boo-hoo.I'm drinking it slowly and enjoying every bit of it.This is the second beer I've had by this brewery.And Im starting to like this a lot."
"My favorite Brooklyn beer. Well worth a try."
"Very drinkable. This is near the top of its class. This is the first RIS I ever had a few years ago, and I'm now wondering why I spent so much time and money searching out other options. Definitely want more."
"Poured a 1"" head which quickly dissipated completely. Black as night. All the classic dark stout flavors are here - coffee, chocolate sweet malt. And in fact this is stronger in all categories than the average dark stout. I'd almost say this is Goose Island Bourbon County without the bite of the bourbon. Brooklyn always does a nice job with their higher end beers."
"Overall: Perfect for a cold winter evening. I would highly recommend Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout to anyone."
"black, tan head, some of the most excellent lacing i've seen from a stout. deep chocolate smell with a hint of roast chocolate. some alcohol is also present in the nose. booziness up front followed by some bitterness. aftertaste is a lot like one of those box candies that has some fruit inside. It has some slight chocolate in the taste, but to be honest, I get a lot more chocolate taste from many stouts that don't have ""chocolate"" in the name. I suppose this is a decent stout, but the bitterness and booziness are a little off putting and I was hoping for some more actual chocolate flavor. This is a fresh 10-11. Wondering if some age on it wouldn't improve this a bit."
"Drinkability:"
"D - Fairly high given the huge amounts of alcohol in this one. It is a sipper for sure but I could still go thru a couple of these with no problem."
"Drink-ability - Full body, slow to drink due to it's richness. Thick beer, great for desserts and also for those cold nights."
"This is a great beer."
"D - Very high if not for the higher ABV. The ABV is not too overwhelming but can be felt and tasted as it warms."
"D - Yes. Go for it."
"Drinkability - Drinkability is far, far too good for a beer of this weight and Alcohol content. I am partial to the style and this is my favorite example. CHEERS!"
"This is the poster child for chocolate stouts. It pours jet black with a slight head that is a lighter shad of black. The aroma is chocolate and alcohol, a beautiful combination. The carbonation is slight but present. The initial taste is alcohol but is quickly replaced by the chocolate. The 10% is a warmer for the fall/winter months. Very nicely done."
"D: A very well made beer. A drinkable RIS. Heat is a little more noticeable than I might prefer considering this beer is neither barreled or bourbon barreled."
"Pretty solid beer, glad I got to try this finally. Would definitely buy it if it were available to me, but sadly it isn't."
"great stout has become one of my favorites however more then then one at a time i feel would be to much not becasue of the abv but because of its big bold roasted flavor"
"Imperial Stouts aren't my favorite, but this is a great example of the style. Glad to have this so widely available around for the winter season."
"Very smooth finish, leaves a nice roasty aftertaste. It's a sipper beer."
"D - Definitely not a session beer but a good sipping beer couldn't have more than two at a sitting. Overall one of the best RIS I have ever had."
"Edit: Revisiting this one after a year in the cellar, still 2010-2011 vintage. Still gorgeous as fuck. Loads of molasses, brown sugar, bitter coffee and espresso. Great sweetness and balance. Almost liqueur-like flavours. No alcohol and a lovely, creamy feel. Downright brilliant; amazing what time does to this. Sadly my last bottle of this vintage. 5/45/45/45/5"
"Be back in 5 years when I can do a 5-year vertical review, expecting the alcohol to become a little more mild over time."
"For me, the feeling, the warmth of the booze, and the memories are the saving grace of this beer. It pushes it beyond the just the flavor and beyond ratings .. It just puts me in a good state of mind."
"D - Not my favorite RIS, but I'll continue to mix this in with my ""go to"" favorites since it's a seasonal dig."
"Overall, this was a knockout beer. I have been waiting for this one for quite some time to hit my local store and I am sure Al was getting tired of me calling him every week. In my opinion Brooklyn really does not make super wild extreme beers but they make so many styles to a tee and this one being no exception. I am glad that I have three more to enjoy over the next few months and I will be saving at least one for next year to see how it does with a little bit of time on it. I would say that you should not miss getting this beer. Seriously, go out now and look for it because it will go quickly and you will regret it. Well until next time...."
"moutfeel: not bad, but for an RIS (an arena teeming with worthy foes), a bit - a bit - on the watery side; doesn't have the velvety-ness i look for. adequate carbonation... decent drinkability, more a sipper than something you'd want a few of, but a beer i'll definitely seek out again (especially considering its very reasonable price)."
"Overall- This one really grew on me as I drank it and had a chance to ponder all of its unique attributes. At first, it seems like many other chocolate double stouts, but it really has some great qualities that separate it from others. It has a low booze presence, light body, and nice smokey/charcoal quality that makes this a great option for the style."
"Warmed to ~50 degrees, this stout pours a jet black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head, leaving some nice lacing. Wonderful chocolate scents come through immediately, along with some coffee and dark fruits. Wow, this tastes really good, with the sweet and bitter chocolate dominating the flavor profile. Thick and creamy in the mouth, with very little heat (if any). I really like this stout with some age on it. This is my first experience with a 2 yr old BCS, and will continue to stash some of these away on a yearly basis."
"D- Im pretty glad I got multiples of this, but really one is enough. This is a rich beer and it makes a great dessert or night capper."
"This is really good stuff IMO. A very nice, pretty easy-drinking RIS I'm glad to have around for the winter. Not quite up to Old Raspy, but darn good. Gonna lay some down for a year or two and see what happens I think, I'd like to try it and see if it gets a bit sweeter, more chocolatey."
"D - Quite drinkable even though it is 10%. The alcohol is noticable, but it gives you the kind of warmth you would want on a cold winter night."
"I hope this helps. Get this since it is limited... since the ABV is high, save one for six months or a year down the road and see what you think about it as it ages some."
"D: Maybe the most drinkable Russian Imperial Stout out there. The heightened dark chocolate character makes it more drinkable than most beers of this style, and the fact that it isn't a coffee stout or the fact that it's missing a lot of bitterness is something that can be counted in its favor, as it makes it a very unique beer that I haven't ever experienced a duplication of. Sure, there are other amazing stouts out there, but this is a delicious interpretation of a RIS that I hope never goes out of rotation at Brooklyn Brewery. I buy several 4-packs a year and will continue to do so."
"Drinkability: This beer is surprisingly drinkable and just an overall treat. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the price was quite reasonable as well."
"Pours almost motor oil black , with a creamy tan head that has some nice retention and spotty lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, floral hops, some toasted dark malt and some tobacco. Taste is medium bodied, very little carbonation with flavors of dark chocolate, some dark pitted fruits, tobacco, and some alcohol presence. Finish remains a light tobacco and dark chocolate aftertaste that slowly disappears. The alcohol warmth has a nice finish. Very well done..."
"D: The 10% ABV is definitely detectable, but I enjoyed the session. I have always in the past, and will always continue to look forward to the winter release of this beer."
"Overall, a very nice imperial stout. It's pretty well balanced. A bit too much on the alcohol and bitterness for me, and the slight sour was a bit weird, but that didn't bring it down much. I wish I could get this more often."
"D: As mentioned numerous times before, it is not very bitter and the alcohol isn't as present as many other high ABV beers in the same class. This is a coy beer, and it is easy to get ""pulled under"" the weight of the high alcohol content. It is very easy to drink, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy stouts, or are simply looking for a single beer they can drink at the end of the day to unwind."
"i found this to be an enjoyable beer ,i wouldn`t recommend drinking too many in one sitting but i would have this beer again.."
"Notes - All in all a very enjoyable beer. One of the better Russian Imperial Stouts Ive had. Its definitely worth a try."
"If you're a coffee aficianado and know how coffee tastes when you brew it below the proper temp this BCS is very similar. Very ""green"" tasting with a bit of sourness and bitterness."
"My curiosity of BCS has been fullfilled. It´s worth trying out, even if you´re 6,000 miles away from home."
"Serving: Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Must serve cold!!"
"D: Im trying really hard to drink it slow because of the ABV. It's difficult."
"This is decently drinkable beer. Some might have some issues from the heaviness and the higher ABV might be to much for some people who aren't used to these Russian Imperial Stouts. Still a good brew. Very creamy which helps give a few more points in the rating systems."
"D- This is a well made beer for sure, but the bitterness and 10% abv make this a sipper. Certainly better RIS's out there. Not very much a fan of the bitterness."
"D - Very enjoyable to drink, alcohol is a somewhat present as a reminder of the ABV, but I could enjoy a few without any problems."
"D - Very good, full bodied and very flavorful. Rather easy drinking for being such a big beer. World class and very good."
"This is a very well crafted beer. It is very hard to tell that this is 10% ABV by how smooth and flavorful it is. To me, it seems like a much more flavorful and alcoholic Guinness."
"D - it's pleasant, but could use a year to let the alcohol and hops mellow out and maybe allow for some more of that chocolate to come forward."
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout beer is black as space. The head was short lived and had a medium brown colour; only a tiny amount of lacing remains. As soon as a poured it I smelled malt, even from 3 feet away. When you get closer you also smell sweet coffee. The first flavour I got was coffee changing to sweet maltiness. The aftertaste was of bitter black chocolate. As my palate grew accustomed to it, the taste grew more uniform and I mainly tasted milky, bitter chocolate. This beer has a milky feel and is surprisingly light for the style with very little carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer with a lovely complex flavour."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied with nice carbonation. Very easy to drink and leaves a nice aftertaste. A really nice beer that I look forward to drinking again. Also looking forward to drinking this one with some more age on it as well to see what happens."
"Talk about a kick in the teeth... this beer really did sneak up on me! I was told by a friend that this is his favorite beer so I had to pick me one up and I did. I first tried it directly out of the bottle while it was still around 42 degrees... talk about bad idea! This beer is excellent when poured into a mug and let to warm to about 48 to 54 degrees give or take on my estimate on temperature. Extremely flavorful beer and very hoptastic!"
"BBCS is what Bell's Expedition attempted to do but failed."
"D - A sipper but two would be easy. I think it will improve and maybe become more complex with some age on it."
"D - This is an intense beer that is not meant to be really drinkable. That being said, it isn't bad for an RIS. I won't be having a second tonight, but it wouldn't be a problem most nights."
"Drinks: wait, you guys are telling me that this stuff is available right off the shelf on the east coast? Like, you don't have to wait in line for three hours or anything to pick this up? You guys got it good over there. If I had steady access to this beer, I don't know if I'd ever not have some in my fridge. For its availability, one of the best RISes out there."
"(24)"
"Nevertheless, a classic American take on a world class sipper, although I will never understand the idea of having this with a cigar. Adding nicotine poison to this malt showcase, seems to me to be an incredibly stupid nullification."
"D: Excellent drinkability considering the ABV. The alcohol was not nearly as noticeable as I would have thought based on the smell. This one really goes down easy. Not quite as advirtised though as I really didn't get nearly as much chocolate as I expected."
"D. Surprisingly a bit hot even though it's almost a year out and not terribly high abv in the first place. Good, but not excellent. I'd like to try the OPS since I'm always interested in seeing how much bourbon can improve a beer like this. (Everyone knows that bourbon only improves a beer.)"
"Drinkabilty - This is a good imperial stout but id love to taste this beer a few percents lower. A session beer, 1 and done for me. Id rather drink youngs double chocolate stout and enjoy a few"
"I'm very happy to have been able to pick up a 4 pack while traveling MI. This is a very fine RIS and should age well."
"MF/D: a fizz of carbonation burns the tongue before settling down for a smooth swallow, an exceptional imperial stout that i would gladly drink again."
"Just an absolutely fantastic dessert beer. Would pair very nicely with vanilla ice cream. There's enough alcohol to remind you that you're drinking a big beer but the lingering dark chocolate finish is very pleasing."
"This is a big rich beer. Like a boozy glass of espresso chocolate cake. It's delicious through the glass, with each sip varying in intensity between chocolate and coffee. with plenty of malt diversity along the way. Light notes of sweetness and banana endure. Unlike some other stouts, I think the booziness is more than apparent but this one is so flavorful that it doesn't take away from the focus of the drink which is the big chocolate malty flavor."
"Overall I enjoy this beer but it's not one of the best in this crowded style. At 10% I expect it to be strong but it seems like it needs another year to mellow."
"D: Wow... an excellent beer. Dangerously drinkable."
"EDIT: 12/1/10 Having a year old bottle now. This beer mellows wonderfully and is an extremely good value even if you have to sit it in your cellar for a year to make it better! I have to do some number adjustments. Despite this, there is still a bit of astringency that another year might take out."
"Quite good, and considering its price and ubiquity, is a great buy. Recommended."
"A good beer, buy heavy and boozy. I was craving a second, but two would have likely destroyed me for the rest of the night."
"D - MORE BODY!!!"
"OVERALL: A solid brew I'm glad I had the chance to try. The chocolate comes out more as the beer sits, but because I serve most of my beer at room temperature, I don't think it had much to do with warming up. A very tasty beer that needs a bigger nose as well as a thicker pour and more impressive head to bring it up a notch. Non-the-less, a tasty treat for sure. Thanks for grabbing me a few of these when they were around Log!"
"Overall - I am blown away by this beer. I'll have to revisit this one in a month or so to make sure it isn't my mind playing tricks on me. I really enjoyed drinking this tonight."
"Thanks Blankboy. Pitch black. with small brownish head. Very aromatic nose with plenty of chocolate, some vanilla, wood and cherry. Flavor is very chocolatey, some fruits (cherries), maple and rum, quite sour and sweet for a IS. Average mouthfeel, sirupy and sticky. Too rich for me."
"D - I look forward to this one every year. Delicious beer, great value, it cellars phenomenally well, and the bottle is cool as hell."
"The finish is warming and smooth showing slight hops, rich roast and soft chocolate. Very soothing. I do think with 1 or 2 more years this will mature into perfection, but only time will tell. The best thing I have ever had this beer with is creamy cheesecake - wow, the creamy textures are so elegant next to each other. But chocolate cake or vanilla icecream work wonders as well. In any case, enjoy the Black Chocolate Stout when you need a simple and deep chocolate stout - it will treat you right."
"Black beer with nothing of translucency. Foam: brown, dense and persistent. Aroma: roasted malt, very smell of coffee, chocolate and alcohol. Creamy texture. Taste of coffee, bitter chocolate and roasted malt. Alcohol is properly inserted. Medium carbonation. Dry and bitter end."
"As mentioned earlier, this isn't the most complex example of the style. It tastes pretty good & is ultimately enjoyable. For some reason, I imagined this beer would be more righteous. Maybe it needs a year or two."
"Solid offering but not quite as complex as some of the other imperial stouts out there. It's a hell of a beer overall though and gains points for its subtletly and balance."
"The mouthfeel is on on the thicker side, but probably middle of the pack for imperial stouts. Carbonation is also moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, it has some great flavors to it and was a very tasty beer for an after dinner drink tonight."
"Overall impression then? Well, given the price, which was a bargain at 19.90 SEK this is nothing short of a fantastic beer. Truly regret that I didn't buy more than one."
"D_Definite sipper but could easily enjoy a few of these."
"This is an amazing brew that I look forward to every winter. On a cold night, I'm thankful this beer is there to comfort me."
"07-08 bottle. Black pour with a 2 finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin ring. Chocolate and alcohol dominate the aroma with a healthy dose of roastiness and a noticeable amount of pine with a little bit of dark fruit and slightly vinous. Flavor is lots of bitter dark chocolate and coffee with lots of alcohol. A little more dark fruit and banana up front than the aroma with quite a lot of hop bitterness. Body is a bit thin for an imperial but fairly full. Loads of prickly carbonation break up the mouthfeel too. Just a bit too much alcohol coming out that seems to hide some otherwise great flavor and aroma. Some aging to mellow out the hotness would serve this beer well."
"Pours black without being terribly thick with a nice mocha head and a bit of lacing. Smells quite sweet with loads of chocolate and some roasted malt. Hints of anise and molasses. Taste isn't quite as complex and full of depth as the nose, and adds a bit of alcohol, which doesn't take too much away from the mouthfeel given the style and abv. Very nice and drinkable, and much better with some age on it."
"Overall impression of this beer is very good. A great beer to have on a cold winter night to warm you up and provide some time in thought. A very drinkable beer if you have the time to appreciate depth of flavor."
"Inky black color with a finger-width dun head that lingers the whole way. Very limited lacing on the glass. You can smell the alcohol along with dark roasted coffee, but the taste is all coffee and chocolate. The medium carbonation helps with the head retention and makes for a real nice mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable stout but the alcohol does sneak up on you."
"Rich and dark with a 2 finger milk chocolate head. Loads and loads of chocolate in the nose. Has a very sweet and milky smell to it. Taste is quite rich and nutty. Not a lot of bitterness which is actually how I like my stouts. Has some fig/raisin notes. Mouthfeel is very thick and good drinkability with the alcohol very well hidden. Nice well rounded RIS."
"SkÅL!"
"very drinkable considering the 10%, but this will catch up to you quick. a must for any stout lover and certainly worth seeking out."
"Good drinkability, it seems to be a little more so than a lot of the category as it's a little lighter in body."
"Very enjoyable brew.. Look for this one."
"Yet another example of an ""old friend"" beer that's somehow gone un-reviewed by me. Time to change that. To the max. It pours a straight jet black topped by over a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malts, and a hint of maple syrup. The taste is very similar, with the roasted malts taking center stage, followed by a strong chocolate powder contingent. The rest comes in in a nice dark melange in the finish. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, this probably the most readily drinkable widely-available stouts around. Get some!"
"It has that pleasant generation of a 'stomach furnace' as I like to put it. Even the faults I can find are probably strengths to others. I almost want to proclaim this beer my favorite beer. I thought this was bourbon aged, but I can't find enough of it for it to be anything recently aged."
"Notes: This is an exemplary example of an Imperial Stout. A great dessert beer paired with chocolate. I got back into Brooklyn Brewery's offerings as I am reading Garret Oliver's book ""The Brewmaster's Table"". Oliver is the brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery."
"Into a snifter, it poured black with a finger of brown head that retained fairly well, and laced well too. Big big bittersweet chocolate nose, with cocoa powder, coffee, earthiness, and anise as well. The flavor was like someone chilled a melted Hershey's Dark bar; huge dark chocolate flavor, progressing to a semi-dry cocoa powder/coffee finish. Combining this with the thick velvet smooth body yielded the ultimate dessert drink experience. I only wish I had some creamy dessert to pair it with. An excellent example of the style."
"D - Low carbonation and thin mouthfeel makes this one pretty easy to drink"
"A great beer overall."
"Has lost a little of its alcohol bite from this winter, along with a little chocolate. This is still a little on the hot side for a 10% beer, but it's an awesome RIS for the price and one of a handful of beers that I'll buy a case of each year."
"D - Overall, pretty tasty. I couldn't take down more than one of these at a time, but definitely worth a try. I've had some more flavourful stouts, which were more drinkable, but I'm inclined to think that it's largely the noticeable alcohol that acts as a bit of a turnoff for me."
"Drink: This one is a sipper, though I've had a fair amount of sips for this review. Don't let the high alcohol content scare you off, as the bitter chocolates will force a little self-moderation. Delicious through and through."
"Tasty."
"The beer pours black with a tan head. The aroma is nice with a mix of chocolate and roasted malt. I also get a little bit of alcohol in the aroma. The flavor is milk and bitter chocolate. I also get some nice pine hop bitterness in the flavor and a little bit of alcohol. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"2009 vintage. Pours a deep, dark black, opaque with just a suggestion of mocha colored head. Aromas of roasted malt, cocoa powder and freshly brewed espresso. Flavors of dark chocolate, bitter chocolate and maybe some coffee. Alcohol, although present, is not that noticeable. Nicely done."
"D: well...for 10% its a sipper I think. But its good. Its a nice beer. Good job Oliver. I would be curious to see what you would throw together for a dessert item to pair it with."
"Overall - exceptional beer, love the malty chocolate flavors and sweetness. would recommend to anyone!"
"Overall: What a wonderful beer. I enjoy stouts and this is likely one of the best stouts I've had."
"I am going to put the remaining pair of these into the cellar to see what happens..."
"I've had Black Ops, which I enjoyed quite a bit, but I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is. I'll be seeking this out and suggest that you do as well, especially if you prefer your chocolate to be on the dark side."
"drinkability - this is one to sip, I don't think I will have another today, though"
"I suppose that I am disappointed by this beer. It isn't to my taste. It is decent enough but if this were available locally to me then I wouldn't be rushing out to buy a 4-pack when it comes out each year."
"A great stout that I've enjoyed many times in the past and will seek out again. Very tasty and I recommend drinking this as a nightcap or desert beer."
"Great beer. Thanks Chuck."
"T-- Very rich, sour chocolate taste. Kind of a chestnut undertone. The chocolate comes through toward the end. A bit too alcohol taste."
"The tan head forms up nicely and stands proud as if to say, ""I am Brooklyn, and Brooklyn is Stout."" Black does not even begin to describe this brew. It's advanced darkness that seeks light (lite) of the world and swallows it whole. The nose is as fruity and toasty as the first taste is. The body isn't too heavy and it leaves a good fruit flavour that I love from a good stout and only comes out in the best of chocolates. Good beer all around, a must buy if ya got it."
"An aggressive pour into my Duvel tulip yields a beer that is absolute black with a good sized milk chocolate cap. Head retention and lacing are both well above average for the style. The nose is intoxicating, chocolate covered expresso beans. The taste isn't quite as balanced unfortunately, as the rich dark chocolate notes dominate and any coffee flavor is merely an afterthought. Appropriately low carbonation for the style, and the body is almost perfect, full and impossibly creamy. This beer is ridiculously drinkable, tasty and a great mouthfeel with no alcohol heat, which is impressive for a 10%+ beer (note, I've learned to take this beer out of the fridge about 20 minutes before I'm going to drink it, if you drink it at fridge temperatures there will be some boozy heat to it). I still see why this is the beer that made me love craft brews."
"D- I drank the beer in less than 3 minutes. I'd consider that drinkable. I just wish I had another."
"Drinkability: It's disappearing surprisingly fast."
"D- This is a great beer, alchol is just right for warming you up on a cold day."
"Notes: Vintage Winter 09-10. A very nice, chocolate forward stout. It isn't as chocolaty as Young's Chocolate Stout, but the chocolate malt is front and center. Good solid example of the style and made for a nice beer to sip to finish the night. Right on the cusp of being an amazing beer; it's not quite there but it is a very good beer that I would love to drink again."
"drinks well now, but even better with age I would assume. alcohol is a bit hot, but not much more than expected."
"I would say this is average drinkability for a 10% brew. Normal RIS drinkability...definitely the best Brooklyn Brewing Co. beer I've had."
"M: Full bodied, nice bit of carbonation, lingering taste"
"D-somewhat coarse. style is fitting but I thought it was a ""dark chocolate"" stout."
"Winter 08-09. Incredible beer. Pours black with a small light brown head. Lots of chocolate, roast and caramel in the aroma. The flavor is rich with even more chocolate, berries, brown sugar, caramel and roast. Very soft carbonation that fits the flavor well. I dearly wish that Brooklyn would distribute it to my state."
"D - Very good for a 10% ABV stout. More drinkable 3 months since the first time I drank it. I can't wait to see what it taste like at 9 months and 1 year as I still have 2 in the cellar."
"(new scores 4,4,4,4,4.5)"
"I'll always have a soft spot for Brooklyn Brewery, as their Brown Ale was one of my earliest ventures into the craft beer world, and this beer is definitely their masterpiece. One of my favorites."
"This is one of my new favorite stouts. I hope to get my hands on more."
"Pours out dark with small light brown head. The smell of hops, chocolate and malt hit your nose almost immediately. Goes down smooth with slight tones of hops, chocolate and weak bitterness at the end. Not to much of a heavy aftertase and alcohol is well hidden. Definitely worth every penny spent."
"D: For an imperial stout, the beer is shockingly very drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden. This is one of my all-time favorites and I wish I had enough storage space so I could age this stuff; it's interesting to watch the flavor develop over the years—it seems to peak if you age it for three years."
"Tastes pretty much like the nose but with some roasted malts and ripe fruits. It finishes with bitter chocolate and a warming alcohol. The body is full with good carbonation."
"Excellent stout!"
"Poured from the bottle a blackish brown with a slight tannish head. Smells of bitter chocolates and roasted/burnt malts. Taste is similar with slightly more chocolate flavors. Good feel with light carbonation, very smooth and thick body. A food drinking Imperial Stout."
"D-Nice sipping beer, (well worth the price...just kidding) although could use a little more aging to address the alcohol afternotes."
"D - Could be sessionable, and great overall. Really enjoyed the coffee and chocolate."
"This is a smooth drink. A lot of alcohol, but easy to imbibe. Dangerous."
"Very easy to sip and savor this one. Recommended!"
"D: Easy to drink, this one is still a little young will develop nicely. Strong flavors, good flavors, will let other bottles age. 4.0"
"Thanks again Eric!"
"D- too good. doesn't taste like it's 10% at all. 5.0"
"D- This is strong, and the bitterness CAN get to be a little much. Regardless, its a damn fine beer that I'm sure would taste a lot better if it were 30 degrees cooler out. I like it. I don't love it...but I like it."
"D: Great beer, and readily available."
"I finally got around to trying this one (I've heard good things about it and keep seeing it every time I look at the beers of the world book whenever I'm in barnes and nobles) and must say I'm impressed. This one reminds me of Samuel Adams Imperial Stout, but without the anise taste, The beer poured deep chocolatey black with a thick dark tan head. Taste was that of a really dark chocolate. Has a velvety mouthfeel. It's goes down too easily. Smell is sinfully cocoay. About as good a stout as I've ever had."
"Note: This is definitely ""old reliable"" for me, it's always on the shelf. This beer is also great for introducing people to heavy stouts."
"Amazing beer, looking forward to getting some more."
"A real deep complex brew here. Coffee, bitter chocolate, and a kick off booze. Thick, rich, complex, and delicious. Easy to drink, even though this one packs a wallop. Haven't had this one in 10 years. Glad I revisited."
"D: Whoa! This is certainly a sipper. Far too rich and thick to take a gulp. Actually, it's tough for me to finish a 12 oz bottle because it's just so rich. Much better than I expected, though. I would rather drink this in a half dose. It's like a really rich chocolate cake that tastes great, but you only want a small piece at a time. I can see it being better on a frigid winter night"
"D- its hot to be sure but with some time on it the heat mellows out and becomes great. Green as this bottle I can't really see my self cracking another tonight. I've had far more drinkable big stouts in this abv range."
"D: Very good, but not so much that I would seek it out just for the drinkability."
"As for drinkability, would I order another one? I didn't this time, but in the future, absolutely I'd go for another one of these."
"Notes: Rich and reliable, a nice stout and a solid offering from Brooklyn, and quite a surprise on tap being rather rich and remarkable."
"The only part that I really didn't like was the alcohol bite to it. If the alcohol taste would've been covered up more then it would be almost perfect."
"D - Goes down pretty easy."
"This beer is quite filling and I can't see myself drinking another one tonight. But that's not a bad thing in my opinion, it only makes you drink it at a lower pace and abra-kadabra, this great beer lasts longer."
"Black beer like it say on bottle. Smell like chocolate. Taste like good Belgian chocolate and not much like alcohol just like bottle say. I like this very much but big alcohol. Only had two this day. I want cousin to send me more Black Chocolate Stout."
"Taste is much like the nose, heavily coffee, toasted malt, exceedingly dry. Not a hint of chocolate, but a nice heavy full body, roasted. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, very dry and defintely with an alcohol bite. Nice and drinkable, but definitely needs to be paired with food."
"D - Don't notice the alcohol for 10% ABV. I have loved this beer in the past, but the one I chose to review appears to have gone off."
"D - It hides the alcohol great but overall this is a pretty middle of the road RIS in my opinion. It is pretty inexpensive and if you haven't had it it is worth a shot."
"D- Sip. Really only sip, though the smoothness is tempting for the imbiber to indulge too fast. May want to wait a bit before reaching for another."
"D - Easy going and abv is well masked but very filling. Definitely a sipper."
"Notes: When I bought this four-pack of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout I was deciding between it and the somewhat similar Southern Tier Choklat, which was only available in a bomber size, wasn't refrigerated, and was very overpriced. I think I made the right choice..."
"Carbonation is soft and pleasant, but the beer has a sting to it, cant really place it, but I dont believe it to be the alcohol, but it makes the lizuid feela bit harsh at times."
"Pretty smooth mouthfeel that helps this beer go down quick."
"D: I liked it, but I'd need to sit down and have it again before I could really make up my mind on where it falls in the chocolate stout spectrum. Expect a re-review of this one."
"This was from a 2009 bottle. I have several other bottles and I'll be interested to see how it ages."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink for its 10%, it doesn't have much complexity though and is surprisingly mediocre. I wouldn't say this is a bad beer but it just comes across as simple to me. Sometimes this is a good thing but I expect more from a RIS. If this was offered to me again I wouldn't have a problem drinking one but I won't be seeking this out again anytime soon."
"d - I really like this beer; it's one of my favorite Brooklyn beers. Looks great and has a wonderfull full chocolate taste to it. Thought the smell was a little mellow but that could be because it's not March and this is from the 09-10 Winter release. Great stout that I will certainly be trying again."
"D - Not very drinkable because of the high ABV. It's also hard to drink fast because it's so potent. A decent beer, overall, but somewhat overrated in my opinion."
"It is a well made beer, but a bit to coarse bitterness, could benefit from a few years storing for my taste."
"Drink up."
"Drinkability - Despite being 10% ABV, it goes down very smooth. The sweet tastes definitely mask the decent ABV. However, because of it's limited availability and sometimes steep price range (depending where you go), multiple drinks may be out of the question, but if you have the opportunity to drink this one, don't pass it up!"
"Hmm Hmm damn tasty beer. The aroma chocolate malty with a tinge of coffee. The taste is good really good starts with a slight sweet intro then fades to the chocolate note with a kiss of coffee/bourbon, finishes dry with the roasted malts and hops. Great beer especially as an intro to RIS style. A must have!"
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is one of the tops in the RIS category and this past years brewing is no exception. Highly recommended and usually a good bargain for such a high quality beer as well."
"Some aging has definitely done this well and mellowed the heat, I believe. Also, I think this benefits from being a bit cooler than I typically drink such strong beers at. The flavor is not as bludgeoning as a lot of 10% beers, so it goes down easy, and the flavor is not too huge. I'm a little disappointed they cut down to a four-pack, but this is still quite a good value and a beer worth buying. Easily worth the dollar more than Old Rasputin."
"I have to say, this is one of my favorite beers, definitely my favorite Russian Imperial. Another win from Brooklyn Brewery!"
"D - so so... I will pass in the future."
"D: Definitely a bit raw, especially compared to an aged '07-08 I had a few weeks ago (I reviewed it, but I lost the damn notes). Though I would only drink one of this fresh batch in a sitting, BBCS is still dangerously smooth-bodied and warming."
"D..Easy to drink for a heavy Imperial Stout that has a 10% ABV. I would advise to take it easy since the ABV is so high, but that is easier said than done considering the marvelous taste of this near perfect recipe. Enjoy!"
"Drink this one slowly - savor the taste. Not for faint of heart. Enjoyable, but not a multiple. Drinkability fades with quantity."
"Drinkability: Getting down more than one glass of anything at 10% is quite an accomplishment--this one is very smooth and delicious, and goes down decently easily."
"The mouthfeel is thicker than it looks, and even a little bit more carbonated than the lack of head would allow you to believe. It's decent, but leaves the palate and the tongue really dry. For drinkability I've averaged the taste and mouthfeel scores, because both contribute to how much I would drink of this beer, and neither is particularly outstanding. I'm disappointed, I really thought I would like this one. Oh well, on to the next!"
"Awesome brew. Pours completely black with a nice deep tan head that takes a while to dissipate and leaves great lacing. beer lets no light through at all. Smells of dark chocolate and toffee, with a nice coffee aroma. taste is even better than the smell, with hoppy bitterness up front slowly changing into a rich chocolate flavor. Awesome tasting beer. Really coats the mouth. Great for a winter night."
"Poured from a bottle (Winter 09-10) into a snifter - appears to be completely black, perfectly obsidian and opaque; head is pretty small but is a nice light brown. Aroma is chocolate (duh!), with some hints of currants and molasses. The taste of sweet, dark chocolate gives way to a dry roastiness and finishes with a touch of alcohol and bitterness - pretty complex and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and velvety smooth. Fairly drinkable for the style."
"The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but does have a decent amount of carbonation. This finishes with a good alcohol burn, and you can feel it go down your throat, and warm you as you drink. This is also very drinkable, as it goes down very smooth and the flavors go together so well. Mix this together with some chocolates, and flavors that come together are simply incredible."
"A solid looking inky black RIS with a deep tan head that left quickly. The nose of the beer is incredibly complex with mainly a fruity sweet alcohol coupled with chocolate, molasses, black currants and some notes coffee. Initially the beer strikes the palate with a strong molasses flavour which evolves into a slightly sweet aftertaste and a bitter aftertaste on the palate. Not as complex as the nose, nor as inviting, but still quite enjoyable. Covers the mouth thickly and lingers. Lightly carbonated. Makes an enjoyable sipper on a Friday in winter."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable, even with a 10% + abv. Alcohol is completely hidden, which means to me that this one is brewed with balance in mind. Deceiving brew, good balance, but lacking a bit in taste. Would probably be a good introduction to someone attempting to get into stouts."
"After recently having Sexual Chocolate, this beer is not quite as big and full, but they are similiar beers. Aging about a year or so does them well."
"Dark opaque brown pour with a darkish tan head. Dark burnt orange highlighting on the edges of the glass when held to light. Lots of sweet malt in the nose. Dark fruits like raisin, fig, and cherry. The scent gives off the aroma of a high ABV brew. I've got to honest here, I didn't get any chocolate aromas until after I had a drink. I get a sour cherry note first and a lingering coffee/espresso last. In between there is some roasty burnt goodness and more of the dark fruits...maybe a touch of prune juice. Alcohol is supremely well hidden. This is very smooth and rich. I really dig the taste...probably because it's a slightly different interpretation of the style."
"D: It doesn't get much better than Brooklyn BCS. Incredibly enjoyable, watch out for the 10%+ ABV. Sit down on a cold day and drink away."
"All in all, this is a good easy-to-attain brew. If you're looking for a dark brew that is easy to drink and still get a nice buzz, then this is definitely your beer. Awesome to get a 4 pack and cherish on your taste buds."
"Overall, this was a very solid beer. I drank it near cellar temp which was a good idea. I got a lot of flavors and it seemed to be a more unique RIS. I really liked it and can't wait to see what a year will do to this one. Fairly drinkable as well."
"D- Definitely a top-notch RIS; great with some Stilton blue. I kept half of my four-pack back for aging; i'm expecting good things."
"D - the ABV is definitely noticeable but there's nothing gratuitous about the strength. Just the right match for this depth of flavor, without becoming hard to finish. Wouldn't have more than one, but that's not the point."
"For such a big, high ABV stout it is remarkably drinkable. My bottle had a couple of years to age, and it aged well."
"D: Tough to say I would want more than one of these in a sitting. Nice beer on a cold rainy night though."
"D - Not a session beer but a great accent to a steak"
"Taste, big time hot chocolate taste. lots of chocolate and very warming alcohol. with a bitter finish"
"Overall this is a very good beer. Not my favorite RIS but its up there. Definately worth a try, and I will be sure to try this one again in the future."
"D - Not the best IRS available but still highly enjoyable. Great flavor and smooth thick body. I thought there would be more of a chocolate malt presence in the taste, but IMO the roasted malts dominated the flavor. Defintely worth trying though."
"Good mouthfeel, more carbonated than expected, and noticeable alcohol, definitely a one-per for me. Really enjoyed sipping it though and again, gets better as it warms up."
"The drinkability is good considering the high abv, but it's a bit sweet and boozy for my tastes to have more than 1."
"Pours deep black with little head,The smell of this stout is impressive but the taste eluded me.It reminded me of dark Chocolate cake batter,a strong coffee and everclear,the alcohol was straight up hot,making the drinkability poor,I will put a little age on this one and revisit after proper aging,I may have had a hot bottle"
"Had this at Alto Cinco in Syracuse, NY in 2007, but took notes. It was a decent looking RIS, pitch black with brown head, and the aromas of chocolate and coffee were a bit enticing. However, the taste and smell suffered a lot, it was WAAAYYY too rich and tasted like a chocolate cake that fell short, mouthfeel is just way too heavy and this beer is unthinkable and undrinkable."
"D = Great feet up, end of the day brew. I'll be back for more."
"This was the first time I tried this stout and it will be in my fridge again and again."
"Skål! Beertracker"
"One of my favorites from the brewery"
"12 oz. bottle, '09-'10 batch. Pours a completely opaque black, nice creamy brown head, lacing throughout. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, sweet, a hint of alcohol, vanilla, and fruit. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, a little bit of wood, and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, full-bodied, sweet and a bitter finish at the end. Pretty good one, warms well, I like this one."
"full bodied nonetheless, for us cocoa drinkers this is quite a decent experience. kudos to brooklyn, impressed twice in one afternoon."
"D - Good, as long as you drink this in moderation. A very good Imperial Stout, this beer is indeed a perfect winter warmer. Try it with vanilla ice-cream, or with some quality dark chocolate."
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a fantastic beer. It delivers exactly what I want from an imperial stout: enticing aroma, big, complex, but balanced flavor, creamy mouthfeel, with some pleasant alcohol warmth."
"Solid jet black body with a small creamy tan head, however, it fades quite quickly. Very light carbonation. Rich chocolately aroma, with dark heavy malts, slight smokiness, and loads of sweet dark fruit. There is lots of bitter chocolate from the start, alongside a strong coffee flavours, sweet dark malts and a slight hoppy kick in the finish. Thick and full in the body with an almost tar-like feel. Love this beer, one of the best chocolate stout available."
"Decent stout. Not my favorite, but good."
"D - Really delicious beer. Extremely drinkable."
"It is quite drinkable for such a high abv. I will definitely buy this one again next year."
"D: For 10% ABV this is definitely drinkable. Other stouts with an ABV like this can be overwhelming - this is not like that at all. Great on a cold winter night!"
"Drinkability: I view this a desert beer at its finest. You could have it with a meal (like a burger and milkshake type of thing) but I think you want this to end the meal on a good note. The alcohol content is too high to have more than one though. Still, I quite enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - Would have two!"
"Its a great beer. The only bad thing was that metallic taste that I had. All around, a solid beer. Awesome."
"(Bottle into English Pint) This is from the 09-10 season. Poured a creamy, rich black with a think tan head that fell slowly. Nose was fully of chocolate and a smooth roast, with a hint of coffee. this was very appealing after some of the other seasonal stouts I had this year. Once I tasted this, I was far from disappointed as this is easily the best winter seasonal of this year I have had so far. Drink is very smooth and creamy, with subtle flavors melding very nicely on the tongue pulling out chocolate and coffee flavors at various points. A subtle hop aftertaste finishes this very nicely!"
"This is a very well-done beer, put together by a brewery who I haven't had much experience with as of yet, but will certainly look for more in the future. Drinkability is only inhibited by the high ABV, otherwise I would be tempted to have several of these in a sitting. Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout is a bold yet sweet sipper of a stout that is inviting from the pour to the last drop."
"It is a pretty good beer, in the middle of the pack for RIS, it was better the first time I had it, but I will save some bottles, this one will age well."
"This is truly a master's class in Imperial Stouts. Garret Oliver spent time in England studying brewing and it truly shows in this classic English style stout fit for royalty. My only gripe would be the lack of carbonation. I feel it needs a little more considering the weight of the brew."
"Comment: This year's batch I found to be better than a few I have had before, those exhibiting a weird moldy off-smell. The Winter 09-10 seemed cleaner in this regard."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/3/09."
"D: This is a very smooth RIS and pretty drinkable, the booziness is there but only adds to the complexity. Very nice overall, wish Brooklyn Brewery was on the West Coast!"
"This brew caught my eye walking into TW, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a great butterscotch smell characteristic of HG brews. There are also hints of red licorice. The brew pours to a jet black with a tan multi-sized bubble head. On the taste this brew is heavenly to say the least. Chocolate is indeed the forte of the flavor and it is evident from start to finish with different flavors throughout. The brew starts with a black licorice and semisweet chocolate flavor folllowed by a more tart and flatter unsweetened chocolate flavor and finishing with a bitter but sweet milk chocolate with a licorice kicker. This is one HG brew, all throughout the taste the AC is warming and evident not unlike a chocolate licor, hence the licorice flavors. I think I could stand outside naked in -20 degree weather drinking one of these brews and not bat an eye. This is a serious stout, the flavors are beyond incredible."
"I love this beer. Pours dark and smooth, with a head whose color reminds me of peanut butter. Smells darkly sweet with chocolate and faint licorice. Tastes similar to the smell, dark chocolate, nicely sweet, but with an unfortunately burnt bitter taste on the finish. There's some very slight licorice on the mouth too, but not cloying sweet licorice like Good and Plenty, more like fresh fennel. I highly recommend this beer and am hoping that the couple of bottles I put aside benefit from some aging."
"D: If I didn't have other things to do tonight, I'd finish my 4-pack of this right away."
"D- Not as much of a sipper as some of the other RIS's that I've had. Went through this one quicker than I expected."
"D - Pretty boozy, big bodied, definitely a sipper. I was looking forward to trying this one and kind of got let down in the end. I was expecting more. Hopefully Black OPS is better."
"This was one of the BOTM selections for December. The color is like its name BLACK. The is now light passing through this glass whatsoever. A tan froth floats on top. A very strong malty aroma with small chocolate smell. The taste starts malty and finishes with a bitter coffee taste. Although this is not my favorite style I will make sure to get some each time they come around. A nice sipping beer"
"If it wasn't as hot, I would rate this MUCH higher. Still lots of classic tastes and overall profile, but needs to cool its jets."
"Potent but drinkable, very well done"
"D - Sipping one for a while will suffice nicely. It's a fantastic brew I haven't had in over a year. Very nicely crafted and amazingly delicious. Much thanks to Sweem for this one!"
"Highly recommended, particularly given the price point."
"This is a beer I would happily drink again. I think I'll go look around to see if I can get a few more to carry me through the winter. Recommended, definitely."
"I took notes from a side by side with 2009 vs, 2008, and I found the year old bottle to have more of a dark fruitiness in the nose which seems to bring out the dark chocolates more. The fresh version has more vibrancy in the nose. The flavor of the 2008 has more dark chocolate notes with a smoother mouthfeel. It seems a bit thinner, and the alcohol is very well hidden. One or two years max on this beer."
"D - I didn't know what the ABV was when I drank this and I definitely didn't think it was over 10%. Alcohol is masked very well and very dangerous. A delicious beer and the chocolate really adds a nice dimension. Doesn't come across as a chocolate drink or as a syrup additive. As my grandpa accurately put it, ""This is a serious beer."""
"Highly recommended."
"One of my favorite special occasion beers. Pours dark brown in color and opaque. Aroma is a richly blend of hops, coffee, chocolate and vinous notes. Taste is sweet, malty and delicious. There's good roasted malt character and it is chocolately without having chocolate in it. Pretty neat stuff. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and hearty. This sipper goes down easily, with a pleasant warmth from the alcohol which is very well hidden in this gem."
"D - A very solid stout. My wife even enjoyed this beer and she rarely, if ever drinks a stout. A great beer to drink as you relax by the fire and watch the snow fly."
"D – Cheap, and good tasting, with high ABV. A great winter brew for a budget-minded session."
"Very impressed with this; one of the tastier RIS I've had in a while. Good stuff, looking forward to more from this brewery!"
"The alcohol is present in the warmth and finish but it is all in all a highly drinkable stout."
"Highly drinkable RIS; at 10% ABV, the alcohol is well-hidden. A delicious beer to sip on a cold winter evening."
"I am sure to have a review soon where I don't love the beer, I promise."
"D: One of the more drinkable RIS that I've encountered. Very glad that I tried this brew."
"Enjoy!"
"yum"
"The aged version of this beer drinks like a good stout. You'd want to session it, but it'll do your head in. 2010 version is a bit overwhelming with alcohol, you know you're drinking an RIS. Overall a strong stout with plenty of flavor. The perfect beer for a cold night or to curl up in bed with a book."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a decent amount of carbonation."
"Just too disjointed. Doesn't hang together in any sort of interesting way. Not for me, definitely not an introductory brew."
"This is pretty drinkable for a big beer. Their are hints at the ABV, but most of them come from the warming effect, which is welcome on the second last day of December. Somewhat restrained compared to other versions of the style, which helps its drinkability, as well as demonstrating the talent of the brewer. This one isnt hiding behind tonnes of molasses or hops. Certainly recommended. Also quite the bargain, relatively speaking."
"The taste is much more subdued than I thought it would be. Almost more sour than sweet. I had a Young's double choclate stour earlier this week and the two beers aren't really that close in taste at all. Light tasting for a high abv beer, it tastes similar to a standard bock instead of what I associate with a RIS."
"About as drinkable as an RIS can be. This is an all around solid beer. I will have to track down some more of this in the future. Thanks Joe for hooking me up with this one!"
"[D + O] - Roasted malt acidity and oxidation are over the top and not pleasing to the palate. These characteristics dominate the beer. Slight over carbonation detracts from the brew as well. Alcohol is not present in the nose but is preceived as hot/slightly solvent in the taste. I can think of at least 10 (Non - Imperial) stouts that I'd rather enjoy off the top of my head. Very over - rated. Very dissappointed. I will not purchase this beer again."
"Mr. Oliver, well done sir."
"Big, hearty, brash film-noir of a beer - great work from Brooklyn brewery. Looking forward to seeing how this ages - thanks again ShogoKawada!"
"An excellent beer in my opinion. This beer is one to be respected due to it's high ABV (10.1%). Not an easy one to follow, so I usually make this one the last of the evening. The hops nicely round out the maltiness of this full bodied Imperial Stout. I have the good fortune to have it available on tap at two of my favorite bars."
"12 oz. bottle, 2009-2010 release. Pours dark brown with one finger of light brown head. Fair retention and little lacing. Smells of chocolate malts, chocolate cake, dark fruits, grapes, and a touch of heat. Tastes generally sweet chocolate malts with dark fruits and wine grapes. Bittersweet cocoa on the midpalate with loads of bready malts. Finish has more cocoa and some bitter roast. Full bodied with a medium carbonation. Overall drinkability is pretty high, full flavored and good tasting, but not extreme. I could imagine having a couple of these, and buying it a couple times a year if it were available."
"Chocolate brown head stays even to the last drop in your glass. Delicious brown black milkshake smell and taste does not quite hide a hint of nuts and fruits, or the powerful alcohol content, a pleasant bonus. Creamy texture and smooth, full, body. Fantastic winter stout."
"Chocolate? Really? More like burnt black coffee. Now, I am not a coffee fan, so that's a pretty big negative in my book. I was hoping the chocolate would balance it out, but it is a dark unsweetened chocolate, and it doesn't even show up much. This is a miss for me."
"D-I like this, and the potential is definatel there, but it really needs some age to make it a really great beer."
"Creamy mouthfull and chocolatey. For 10% ABV, very will hidden. Much recommended!"
"Drikability is high for the alcohol and richness. quite pleasent. I am glad to be sharing the 12oz bottle."
"All in all, this is definitely a top favourite. I'm not sure it could quite unseat my beloved Trois Pistoles or Young's Double Chocolate Stout from being tied for number one, but it's certainly a very close contender. Since it's only here temporarily, I am going to have to try to resist the impulse to visit every large LCBO store and buy up their entire stock of this. Seriously, if you like smooth, sweet stouts, this is the nectar of the gods."
"D- Dangerous. No other word for it, super smooth, alcohol is well masked, making this an easy drinker all around. Both sad and glad I only bought one 12 ounce bottle, but I will be getting more."
"Pours a dark mahogany, almost black color with 1 finger of dark tan/brown head that lingers a while. Smells of roasted malt, slightly medicinal, with notes of cherries and brown sugar. Tastes creamy and smooth, with lots of sweetness and good malt and dark chocolate flavors. It has a nice warming sensation before a lingering finish of dark chocolate. This beer is a real treat!"
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall this was one of the best RISs I've ever had for my palette, and I've had both Dark Lord and Surly Darkness."
"This was overall a great beer, although there was not as much chocolate flavor as I was expecting. The roasted, almost burnt malt flavors definitely override most of the chocolate."
"Overall I am pleased that I revisited this beer again this year and it basically stood up to what I remembered from years past. Not sure what exactly happened with my on-tap sample, but this was back to its old tricks. Recommended."
"D - I could easily have another. If they released this in CA, I'd be all over it. It'd pair very well with a chocolate dessert"
"Overall this didn't taste quite as complex as it remember it tasting on-tap however it's still a very solid beer. Well worth a shot."
"The body here is full to medium and extremely creamy. If not for a tad bit of carbonation sting it would be perfect. Overall, I feel that this beer is a wonderful example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Just one or two more layers of complexity could have put it over the top. Still, definitely superior to the Black Ops in my opinion."
"Nice silky mouthfeel, once you get past the initial alcohol it is really quite good. Definately a good desert beer, or a nice sipper on a cold evening."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer is good looking beer. Black in color, hence the name, with some dark brown highlights that you really have to look for. It's pretty dense looking This beer has a dark tan colored head that goes away pretty quickly and very little lacing to it. The smell is very good. Smells of bitter chocolate and coffee along with some burned malts. The hops make themselves known after the beer sits for a bit and warms up a little as well as a touch of alcohol. The taste is also very good but a little more intensified, everything is a little bit stronger, with the exception of maybe the burned malts. Starts off with the bittersweet chcolate and coffee. Once it's about room temperature it really has an excellent, well balanced flavor. The hops and alcohol balance extremely well with the chocolate and coffee and the more subtle burned malts. The mouthfeel is good, very full bodied. There's a bit of a bite from the alcohol, none from the carbonation though. Starts smooth and finishes pretty clean at the end. This beer's pretty drinkable for a beer with such a high abv. Solid Brew from a solid brewery, glad I got it again and took the time to review it."
"I always look forward to this release. Pours a deep, dark brown (almost black) with a thin, medium-brown head. There is not much to the aroma, but what is there is full of bitter chocolate and coffee with a caramel sweetness and a bit of straight-up booze. The flavor is delightful, with the bitter chocolate being featured, and there is a bit of a spicy character (some combination of hops and alcohol). Full bodied, but silky-smooth. There is quite a bit of alcohol heat when fresh, but even then it give a nice warming feeling rather than burning. I'm definitely looking forward to trying this one again after some time in the cellar."
"The taste is as advertised, with a thick, chocolaty, roasted to the point of being almost charred, dark malts. There is a full palate of flavors going on here. I will re-review shortly"
"Honestly, the best stout I've had, the Best Imperial Stout of course. I've yet to top this one, the Deul de Ciel is a close second, but this beats it in my books."
"Drink ability was good. For 10 percent, its not too strong, but its best consumed in a small quantity. The one I have is still pretty young, need to age acouple to see if they improve over time"
"Darkness surrounds my glass as the thick black liquid fills it. A tan head that leaves a good looking lacing starts this beer looking off good. The smell of chocolate is present, as is the coffee and roasted malts that one comes to associate with a good RIS. The taste is a very strong alcohol. Normally beers with a high ABV will try to hide the alcohol, but this one is liable to knock you on your butt pretty quickly. The chocolate taste is still there, but the taste is also quite burnt. Oftentimes I will hear people describe stouts as ""like drinking an ashtray"". This is what they were talking about, and while the burnt taste and the hit of alcohol are a bit of a detriment, the chocolate and espresso still makes for a great tasting brew lurking just beneath the surface. The body is nice and full and the aftertaste is quite good. While I've certainly had better of this style, it is by no means bad, in fact I like it quite a bit, and the good certainly outweighs the bad"
"a truly breath taking beer , a beer made for the gods i am not worthly to drink this . the blackness of this beer makes a chill run up my spine true greatness is now in the glass . the strong smell power armour coming from the beer should be a warning to those who havent taste it yet , but once its hits the inside of your mouth . a new dance come to life in you this is one beer that should be tired once and bought out on the days worth remembering . this beer which you could only drink one or two of. is indeed a beer a true classic worthly of all its praise . i for one am honored to taste it"
"F: Finishes pretty bitter, part being a nice hop addition I think, and also a strong bitter quality from the charred earthy scorched roasted malt flavor, stout like. It's pretty dry on the finish as well. THe slight warming alcohol sticks around for a bit that is surrounded with a thick syrupy chocolate malt flavor that sticks to the mouth. It also has this succulent finishing flavor I can't put my finger on, but it's very enjoyable."
"D: This is a great stout which has a nice blend of coffee and chocolate. There is more alcohol apparent in this than others I've had, but it's not off putting. Over all it's a great beer and I'm glad I found this."
"Black opaque body, brown head, slow dissipation, really nice lacing. Chocolate dominates the nose, with hints of vanilla, bready malt, but the hops are pretty well hidden. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla dominate the syrupy taste profile, this is certainly one of the most chocolately beers I've tried. Chewy mouthfeel but alcohol heat impedes drinkability. Certainly a sipper, probably great with a good cigar by the fireplace. I grabbed a 4-pack of bottles, and will probably cellar to see if the alcohol mellows over time. Well worth a try."
"Overall, an excellent RIS, and the amount of chocolate flavour present is impressive considering no actual chocolate/cocoa went into the brewing process"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into pint glass. Poured silky black with a rich, creamy tan color half-inch foam head. Sweet aroma with rich abundance of malt, hints of caramel and fruit. Rich chocolate and coffee taste with a thick, almost velvety mouthfeel and pleasant alcohol warmth. Overall, a very satisfying stout with an incredible balance of sweet chocolate tempered with a coffee bitterness."
"D- This one is a sipper for sure, but I could have another. A little age has really helped round the flavors out and mellowed the booze a bit, I probably would of gave it around a B last year if I would of reviewed it then."
"D: This is a tasty, chocolaty RIS from Brooklyn. I hesitate to call it an excellent version of the style though, as it lacks a three-dimensional complexity that many other imperial stouts can boast. Make no mistake, this has a very appealing dark chocolate character, but aside from the chocolate (and a kick of alcohol), this is merely very good."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, although there are other big stouts that I would pick first, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time."
"Not much for long reviews. But this years is a lot more drinkable than last years with out having to let it sit for months. really sad that this year it comes in a 4 pack rather than a 6. But this years is with out letting sit is the best. I will be visiting my local bottle shop to pick some more up!"
"One of my all-time favorites! Dark brown peripherals, black in the center, with a nice frothy brown head. The smell and taste are exactly what you'd expect: chocolate. But there's not too much of a sharpness to this one that I've found with other strong stouts. It's sweet and flavorful, not harsh and bitter. In my opinion, Brooklyn's is THE quintessential chocolate stout."
"Mouthfeel isn't too thick for the style, and pretty fizzy. Very drinkable."
"Dr. Easy going. The ABV is not apparent. I'm liking this one very much."
"Pours jet black with a gorgeous tan head that looks almost as comfortable to sleep in as my queen sized bed. Black. Aromas are rising out of my glass and hitting my nose from feet away. Smell is exceptional. As this beer ages the boozy smell dissipates rather quickly I have noticed. A very deep dark and fruity aroma develops next to the chocolate aroma that is most prevalent. Everyone knows chocolate and fruit pair extraordinarily well, so this one is smelling out of this world. Sweet chocolate pairs up with some plum and sweet cherries. Considering this is my favorite Brooklyn brew, its hard to review it subjectively, especially considering the quality I am reviewing here. Everything about this beer is world class, especially the taste. Huge chocolate and burnt sugar flavor. Good dark fruit character. Super creamy mouthfeel makes this beer even more luxurious. Really a homerun for Brooklyn. Watch yourself with this beer, as it will catch up to you even after one. Quite a big stout, with a flavor and aroma that would make you want more...but beware."
"Has the thick, chewy mouthfeel that you'd expect from an Imperial Stout. A good drink, but I think I'd be hard-pressed to have a second."
"Really, really exceptional beer. Well worth the annual 10.00 or so. One of Brooklyn's finest."
"Overall, this is a beer that shows INCREDIBLE potential. The flavors are so complex and rich with simultaneously less sweetness and less bitterness than other Imperial Stouts I've had, which gives you time to appreciate every nuance. That being said, the alcohol was just too dominating. Since this is being served at a bar down the block from the brewery in December, chances are this beer is as fresh as fresh could be. A beer this bold needs more time to let the booze integrate and mellow. I'm going to try to find myself a four-pack of this and cellar it. I'll have one every few months and see how the flavors develop. If I had to guess, 6 months down the road this will be fantastic, and by next christmas it will be heavenly, but now it's just too hot."
"D: it's a sipper, indeed, per the style"
"Pouring from a chilled (45 degree) bottle into a pint glass, there's practically no head and only a thin layer of foam which quickly dissipates. The color is a deep, dark black, with no brown coming through the edges. There's a very slight lacing up the glass, but not much to look at. The taste is great - bitter but full for the first taste, then it fades to a thick chocolate aftertaste for many minutes afterwards. This is definitely something you want to savor during and after a meal, and especially with something that's rich in flavor, like a steak or a thick fall vegetable spread. Highly recommended."
"The year-old bottle wins out here. Balanced carbonation, richer aromas, and subdued alcohol. No benefit in aging beyond one year."
"D - after just having DF World Wide Stout, this was a let down, probably should have done the tasting the other way around, still a great overall beer though"
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is seen as a classic, and deservedly so. It has an immense reputation for it cellar potential, it's a darn site cheaper than a lot of other highly regarded imperial stouts, and it drinks like a doozy. Bobsy approved."
"Bottle pours a dark black with two fingers caramel brown foam lacing the glass. Smell is of dark malts and chocolate. Taste is of somewhat thick dark malty chocolate with a little bite to it. The plus 10% abv is well hidden and makes this very drinkable. A decent stout overall and i'm glad I got to try this one. Or a case and a half's worth."
"N- This is not as big and bold as some Imp stouts but it is an easier brew to have more then two at a time. This is no sipper but be careful or you may get smacked down. I will age this beer and see what a year does to it. "
"Overall, an excellent beer from Brooklyn, and the best RIS (based on the few that I've had) I've had yet. I can see why this style of beer takes a such a prominent seat in the ratings on this site."
"Drinkability: Despite the ABV, its easy to drink. Very strong upfront flavors limit this from being a quick drink. It would be a lot better at a closer to room temp but overall its a solid brew."
"Thick, rich, hot, and heavy, this imperial stout makes an impact even to a jaded geek like me. That said, it isn't a personal favorite in the style, but even so, Ramsay was a complete idiot to spit it out."
"Dark"
"Poured from bottle. Dark black color with nice tan head. Aroma of sweet, dark roasted malts and chocolate. Wow, this tastes amazing! Very smooth for a 10.6% abv RIS. Very smooth beginning followed by a slight biterness of coffee and dark chocolate. Excellent mouthfeel. This is one very smooth RIS, perhaps not as complex as others but a great drinker."
"D and overall impression: Very good marks on drinkability here. The chocolaty flavor is spot on. Overall this is a pretty darn good beer. I will definately pick this up again. Skal."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle identifying it as '09 -'10 winter release, into a stemless wine glass. Poured black as nite almost like old used motor oil with very little carbonation. Pretty thick head that is disappears rather quickly. Scent of roasted chocolate, and malts, slightly burnt smell. The tasty mix of dark and sweet chocolates, roasted coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy. It is very drinkable, alcohol is warming."
"This is a sexy beer. If the alcohol wasn't so high this could easily be a beer I'd drink two or three or ten of..."
"D- Potent stout @ 10% alcohol content, a beer to drink slowly, great for desserts, a whole different experience enjoying this stout."
"One of the better RIS i've had although I am still getting my feet wet with this style. I am curious what this tastes like fresh."
"Notes: A good stout. Not syrupy sweet like I thought it would be. It has more bittersweet chocolate notes than sweet notes. Definitely interesting and definitely worth trying if you like stouts."
"overall a wonderful beer i wish i could get around here"
"Winter 08-09 bottling poured into a pint glass. Dark black color with a very thin tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark fruits. Taste is more dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The alcohol in this is way too noticable. Not a bad beer but there are better Imperial Stouts out there. I'd like this more if it hid the alcohol a bit better."
"overall, decent i've drank better versions of this style (my favorite style), if your in Ontario, this beer is a steal at $2.50 for a 355ml, a fraction of the cost you will have to pay for most R.I.S. once you include the trip across the border, thank you whoever was responsible for this beer's arrival on LCBO shelves. I bought twelve and will be stocking up a few more for sure!"
"Drinkability: This is a very good stout. This possesses a depth of flavor and is a pleasure to drink. Given the higher ABV and the thickness, though, this one is good to enjoy slowly."
"Pours inky black with a brown foamy head. The aroma extends 18 inches from the glass - smooth, velvety, rich, dark, roasty. Flavor is sharp, a shock to the tongue, like a smooth semisweet chocolate, with brown sugar and dark caramel. There is a deep, woody bitterness on the finish and considerable heat from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, smooth and enveloping with a strong sting of carbonation."
"Drinkability: A great beer and one everyone should try. By far the best stout I've had so far."
"A very tasty flavorful stout, a new favorite. Doesn't totally hide the alcohol content but contains it well. A good sipper and easy to enjoy; definitely worth trying for RIS fans looking for something on the sweet side."
"The stout is inky black with medium-dark head. It stands tall and proud for a bit before receding some. Its lacing is a bit sticky. Smells mostly roasty. Taste is also roasty but chocolatey. Feel wise, it's nicely carbonated but isn't as thick as I might expect a beer of its stature to be. This beer is hot! Warming. BCS gets easier and easier to drink as I continue down the glass, but it will have its way with me if I have more. I'm sure this is a good candidate for cellaring, but its too delicious to leave alone for long."
"D - Oh no. Try to eat a whole 80% dark chocolate bar and you'll get the idea. This beer is no different. Rich and tasty, but take it slow."
"Without a doubt, this is the best beer in the Brooklyn lineup that I have tried. While what is here is very good, there is room for improvement. Worth picking up, and is a great value for what you get."
"D - one was just about right, but I could have had more, I liked it, so I'd have gone back to it if need be."
"Consumed - 10/27/2009"
"Verdict: I've been waiting to try this beer for many years, and I have to say I'm not disappointed. Black Chocolate Stout is a big Imperial Stout with lots of character, and also quite bargain. Now, to find a new white whale..."
"Drinkability: This is a big stout, there's no messing around with that. It's got some good flavor, nice texture, and is a very well done brew. I think the only thing that hurts this brew's drinkability is the 10%ABV...you just can't do too many of these in one night without having to bow down and pray to the gods of porcelain. That being said, I will be slowly sipping on this bad boy the rest of the night, and looking forward to cracking open another one tomorrow night."
"This brew is very drinkable for a 10 % + brew. A stellar stout. Very stellar."
"as a side note i had this one night ran through a randall full of cherries that had been soaked in knob creek. it was awesome and props to sam at the austin saucer for a plate of the bourbon soaked cherries too."
"This is great and powerful stout definitely fit for a Czar. It will be interesting to see what some age on it will result in."
"This is a tough cookie of a beer, and is not like something I've had in a long time. Overall very enjoyable, and I'd like to pair this with a good chocolaty desert sometime."
"to postulate on the genus of chocolate brews, this one is decisively opposed to the Young's Doubles of the world. because of this lack of sweetness, don't think you're gonna make a killer pairing with a very sweet dessert"
"This was a big, complex beer, but a little more challenging than I would have liked, not as comforting as I'd like a chocolate stout to be. May I was looking for the wrong thing, but I hardly got any chocolate out of it, more the peripheral sensations. I wonder if this would be better aged to mellow it out some, in which case tap is not really the venue. One was plenty."
"Overall- I flat out loved this beer and will gladly keep my fridge stocked with it as long as its here in TX. Hands down, by favorite stout."
"Aggressive pour yields over a two finger head of dark brown foam with an island of larger bubbles in the middle, takes a good while to work itself down to a steady half-finger level, nice web of lacing along the glass walls. Onyx black in color, actually since black is not a color it's colorless. The nose has a pleasingly explosive nature to it for the category, licorice, anise, Brazil nuts, dark chocolate, molasses, caramelized brown sugar, rum raisin ice cream, plum, blackberry fruit, you never feel it is devoid of hops but they are hard to isolate. In the mouth it's a touch alcoholic at first but the espresso bean, bittersweet dark chocolate, mocha accompanied by licorice and pine. At times has a fruitcake kind of thing going on. Toasty, the hops have an oven warmed grain quality, like 19th century shit. At times it's grapey, definitely you get apricot, black cherry fruit. It lacks the sheer richness of many RIPs but absolutely hits you with the primary flavors you expect."
"Overall, I enjoyed the 08 more than the 09, but the 09 was no slouch. If you can find this get it, it's worth it."
"Black as they come with a great tan creamy head. Chocolate bitterness prevails. This was one of the best beers for mouth feel I ever had, so slippery and smooth in my mouth and it goes down so easy. Hard to tell that it was 10% ABV, could not taste it at all. Asham it comes out only once a year."
"Drinkability/Overall: Delicious taste, and a gorgeous beer. However, the alcohol taste is way stronger than I remember it being on tap, and I doubt I could have more than one in a sitting. That being said, I'd drink it frequently. Another job well done by Brooklyn."
"This is just a sophisticated, delicious introspective beer to have by a fire on a cold winter's night. Maybe not quite chocolatey enough to warrant having chocolate in the name. But that's a minor quibble at best. But yeah. This is the reason I drink beer. For those times where you can take sip after sip and contemplate and slowly peel back all the subtle layers that work together to create such a complex marriage of flavor in perfect harmony."
"Pours a deep dark black, with chocolate colored pillow of thick foam on top. Smell of burnt fruit and bitter chocolate. Leaves a good lacing on the glass. First sip is of espresso and burnt malt. Its very good. A smooth mouthfeel that becomes a nice warm feel as the alchohol comes thru as it warms. Very drinkible even with the high ABV. A dangerous brew, but very tasty."
"Smooth mouthfeel, perhaps a little thin, but not bad. I typically wouldn't drink more than one of these in a night but I will come back for more on another day. This one was reviewed fresh, but I've had it at one year and found it to be a bit better. I'll probably hang on to most of the remaining bottles for a little while and see how it changes this year."
"The best thing I'd say about this beer is for its alcohol you can't taste it and I could crush it all day long."
"D - It's not hard to drink, but it would be hard to drink more of."
"Drinkability: According to the description Russian Imp Stouts are chocolate with burnt malt flavor, low carbonation, high alcohol. This does all of them and fits the style perfectly. However, I don't feel I would want another one after this glass."
"Overall a very good, very flavor beer. Sticks to the style very well, but still has a unique flavor."
"Pours a dark brown/black color with a thin creamy brown head. A sweet malty and vinous aroma arises from the glass. The flavor is very similar with sweet malt beginnings and vinous backbone. The flavor is strong and overpowers the subtle chocolate flavor. The body is mildly thick with moderate levels of carbonation. The flavor fades quickly and leaves a lingering vinous finish and is slightly warming with 10% abv."
"Pours an extremely dark brown to black in the glass with a thick, creamy, tan froth that, unfortunately, dissipates somewhat quickly...great lacing! The nose is VERY pretty with sweet, almost dessert like, aromas of dutch chocolate, milk chocolate, soft banana, brown sugar, light molasses, black raspberries, dark fruit, vanilla, & subtle espresso. This beer smells awesome! Sweet, but not too sweet flavors of chocolate, banana, molasses, roasted barley, & roasted coffee show through a long finish with a clear citrus/slightly pine bitter hop finish.(necessary for awesome balance) Great, creamy carbonation. Overall, this is an amazing beer that is extremely smooth...esp. for a 10% abv beer. There is a definite warmth to this beer, but I'd never guess that this is a 10% beer...again...very smooth. A must try!"
"D: I have had this several times and this years is as good as ever. Delicious and will leave you wanting more. Not overwhelming on the aftertaste because it is very balanced and well done by the brewers."
"Really excellent and pretty affordable RIS. I commend Brooklyn for doing this in a 4-pack rather than in bombers like most people."
"Pours a rich, deep dark black with a suprising 1 finger, light brown head. Minimal retention and lacing. Scent is of dark roasted cocoa, slightly sweet, burnt and smokey. Taste is a rich semi-sweet cocoa, slightly burnt and smokey with a mellowed out dark fruit background. The high ABVs peek through in the end. Silky and creamy with a touch of excess carbonation. Very good beer, slightly too burnt in charachter."
"D - A worthy stout, one I'd certainly like to drink again."
"All in all, I think Brooklyn Brewery did a great job with this beer. They managed to straddle the chocolate stout / RIS categories and come up with something that is very enjoyable. I've only got one of these left, so hopefully I can pick up a few more next time I'm at the candy shop. A tasty and classy brew for the winter holidays."
"For what the Black Chocolate Stout is, it's very decent. I would have it again... and again."
"D: D: A delicious take on the RIS. Like a liquid chocolate cake, very smooth and a lot of flavors that changed slightly, some flavors exchanging prominence as my hands warmed up the glass. At almost 11% abv I can't think of a more agreeable ""cold weather"" beer. Highly Recommended!"
"(D)- A great stout that has a fitting name. Great chocolate flavors all over the place. People say that this ages well. . . it might, but tastes great right now! Deceptively drinkable, but I will feel it later. Let this warm up a bit, it only gets better."
"Poured this black beauty in a tulip. Black at SRM40+, the thin dark tan head is supported by low carbonation. Moderate legs and sheen on glass noted. Aroma is roast malt, stone fruit and chocolate. Flavor is a dark roast, slightly biscuit, complex stone fruit with a low bitterness. Mouthfeel is very full bodied with a sweet finish. Warmth from alcohol is noted."
"D: The ABV is quite well hidden in terms of the taste, but it's quite apparent upon drinking a bottle. Still, the beer is quite tasty."
" This is going to be a great ager. Fresh is decent but I'm guessing a year or three will make this an outstanding beer!"
"Overall, a big chocolate stout with good, balanced flavors. A little age woiuld make this beer even better. One of the best winter seasonals."
"D - For 10.50% abv, this is astonishingly balanced and dangerously easy to drink. Absolutely delicious."
"I think this is an outstanding job by Brooklyn. I will definitely pick up another 4 pack of this. Heck, I'll probably buy a case."
"There is no way I would have ever guessed this was a 10+% beer. The smoothness/taste of this beer could be very, very dangerous...in a good way!"
"D: Very good. The alcohol is masked very well - I wouldn't have known this was a 10% beer without the label. This will be a new go-to for me during the winter months"
"I've never been one for the RIS style, but after this beer has encouraged me to explore the style a lot more. A great beer for cold weather."
"For some reason, all of my instincts are screaming at me to do a side by side with Lion Stout. I generally trust my instincts, so there may be an edit in the very near future if the results are interesting."
"Drinkability- Heavy and bold, but a well-crafted brew. [with a nice price tag]"
"I hope they have this around all winter."
"All in all, a very enjoyable brew and one of my favorites of the style to date. Plan to drink again."
"NOTES: BJCP - Russian Imperial Stout"
"Goes really well with ancho chili chocolate and a nice fire."
"D: For 10% ABV, this is extremely drinkable. The heat of the alcohol is well-incorporated. If this is an imperial stout, it is my first, and I like what I'm experiencing."
"D: Perhaps the best deal around when it comes to imperial stouts. This is very hearty and rich, nice for a cold night sipper. The alcohol content is very well hidden for 10%,,, maybe a little too well hidden. Great beer all around!"
"Notes: Great beer to try, but I was hoping for more straightforward chocolate dominance. It may also have suffered by comparison, as the last RIS I had was FBS (which absolutely blew me away); this was good, but by no means great."
"Overall - Drank very early, but I didn't get much sweetness or complex chocolate flavor, more cacao dust and bitterness. I hope some age really develops this beer."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: I was a really good stout. As drinkable as a stout can be. It was nice and thick with a lot of flavor. It also had a nice carbonation to balance out the beer."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. The lot code is smudged on my bottle but it is from the 2009 batch. Sampled on November 8, 2009. The pour is a dark, opaque brownish-black with a fluffy tan head and a lot of lingering lacing. This has 10% ABV but you would not know it with the aroma. The smell is of mild chocolate malts and neutral hops. A full bodied mouthfeel dances on my tongue and down my throat. As for the taste, it is true to the enticing aroma. The chocolate malts are mild but enjoyable and the hops finish comfortably dry. I have to say kudos to the Brooklyn Brewery for this very pleasing stout and one that gives you a buzz without really knowing it."
"Exquisite!"
"Fantastic brew, thank you to UA8 for supplying the opportunity to enjoy this one. I would love for this to be a winter staple but unfortunately it is not available in my area. Fine job and tremendous craftsmanship on this beer."
"D- Definately has some alcohol presence but it's difficult not to with 10% abv. I could certainly go for another after this. Unfortunately, I only have one."
"D: A pretty good RIS. However, for a limited release the emphasizes chocolate in its name I was a little disappointed. I'll probably drink one more for a second opinion and then cellar the other two for a while."
"Drinkability: A little tough to drink but it is a very impressive winter beer. Very much enjoyed the strong taste as it is something I don't down often. Will reccomend to others and will probably go back to this next winter."
"mouthfeel is pretty fullbodied, but slightly thing comparatively to some other russian imperial stouts.still pretty drinkable,the big abv is hidden fairly well."
"pours a jet black which lets no light through when held to the light with a 1/2 finger tan head leaving lacing that slides back to the beer. Chocolate, stone fruit, cherry and alcohol aromas. Chocolate and vanilla flavors up front with some lemon rind/espresso bitterness in the middle ending with milk chocolate and dark chocolate flavors. Full body, medium carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel. Great drinkability, the variety of chocolate flavors generated is fanatastic."
"This is a decently drinkable beer, overall. The ABV is certainly concealed well, but I can't help but feel like there are other RIS's I'd be inclined to pick instead. I enjoyed the bottle I had, but I might leave the remaining bottles in the cellar to see how they do with some age on them."
"Notes: This is a truly outstanding BIG beer. I wish I had some really good plain New York cheese cake with fresh red raspberries to pair with this wonderful beer. Well, for tonight this beer is its own dessert."
"D- I really enjoy this style of beer. This isn't in my top 5 RIS's, I would reach for this one again & again."
"alcohol is prevalent, bitter and sweet, roasted malts, like burnt wood. flavors open up a bit more when it warms up. slick and full going down. not a bad RIS but probably not the best."
"This beer is a high-wire balancing act. Not too heavy, but it is a deep dark menacing beast. Packs a punch at 10% but it is so velvety smooth and delicious it's hard to put down."
"Notes: Certainly will buy some more of these for the winter season."
"A mighty fine RIS in my book. A sipper for sure but I wouldn't mind have a few of these on a cold Wisconsin night. Too bad it's next to impossible to get round these parts."
"D - surprisingly sessionable for the style. no doubt it is a beer sandwich, but I could have two or so rather than 1, as is the case with an Old Raspy."
"This is very easy to drink for a Russian imperial stout. It does not seem anywhere close to a 10% beer. Very nicely done."
"Mouthfeel is quite creamy up until the hop flavor lays down on the tongue with a drying effect. I found BCS a nice RIS, but it didn't necessarily stand out above the rest, at least while fresh."
"Fairly drinkable. It's a pretty good brew all in all, not something I would load up on. Glad I tryed it."
"I am going to age my other 3 from the 4 pack to see if 2009 settles down. In this state, I wouldn't want to drink another again. Very disappointing considering it comes from someone I admire so much, Garrett Oliver."
"Great job by Brooklyn Brewery, I really enjoy their brown but have not had this before. Now just waiting for Monster to come out. Perhaps a trip to the brewery is due...."
"This beer didn't live up to they hype IMO. Appearance was common RIS with a slight gold dust effect in the head. Nose was was chocolate, booze and roasted barley. The taste was nice and trying to be complex but not too much to this stout overall. Chocolaty, somewhat bitter, medium hop presence for the style, some alcohol in the finish. Tasted like it could really benefit from a year or two in the cellar. Needs time to mellow, too fresh maybe. Considering it's only .6 points away from the Rasputin's average score-I don't agree. Not near as well crafted."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, yet light-bodied with mild carbonation. A bit lacking in the overall feel for an RIS, but other than that it's easy drinking. Drinkability is fair - not as tasty and flavorful as I was hoping. Not really worthy to drink all four in a night's session, but probably best to set some off to add some age. Not bad, but not incredible."
"Drinkability is above average for such a high abv. Alcohol is barely detectable."
"Overall: Good to try, nice product, but with so many other RIS's out there, why stop here. Especially since I live 20 minutes from Portsmouth, the home of ""Kate the Great"""
"Some may consider the feel a little thin for the style, and it may be; it is, however, thick and rich and well-complimented by a little bit of a crisp feel."
"Mouthfeel: Too thin, in my opinion."
"pours jet black with a nice little ice cream cone colored head that fades slowly with time. smells of raisins, prunes and other dried fruits. heavy on alcohol from the nose also. tastes like bitter black coffee, dark malts, obviously chocolate, and roasty. as it goes down you dont taste the alcohol per se, but it does tingle the gums and throat a little and that bitter black coffee transforms into a smooth mocha taste. overall a very complex and delicious brew."
"D: Very drinkable RIS and ages quite nicely."
"Grabbed this one on-tap after enjoying it in the bottle a bunch of times. Look was solid if not great - might have been the glassware. Pitch black with a tiny tan head that left no real lacing. Chocolate, roasted malt and fruit in the nose. A very tasty beer - lots of deep chocolate and roasted malt with a nice hint of cherry and dried fruit in there. Body is full and delicious, perfect for the style. Very nice, overall."
"D - Falls in line with other RISs. Slightly thinner body may help out the drinkability."
"The drinkability suffers on BCS due to the hot alcohol. I'm going to sit on the rest of this 4 pack and try it throughout the year."
"12oz bottle from '09. Pours opaque black with a medium beige head. Some lacing. Smells of sweet chocolaty malts and a bit of molasses. Slightly boozy. Sweet malt again in the taste, with a pleasant dark roasted character. A bit of chocolate and brown sugar. Sweet throughout, with some fairly strong hop bitterness at the finish. A bit of alcohol and a definite warming sensation. Medium-full body with fairly strong carbonation. This one seems a bit disjointed overall; it hits you over the head with a lot of varied, strong flavors that I wish melded better. Seems like it might be a good candidate for aging."
"D- Not very high, unfortunately. Bear in mind that this is in large part due to the how new the beer is. I have had it several months old in years past and have not found the ""hotness"" to be as big of an issue with a few months under the belt of this beer."
"D: Not that you will be able to imbibe too much of this, as I see the roughly 11% ABV is catching up with you. This is a doozy of a brew. Take your time. After all, that is all you have left."
"An excellent, complex brew."
"D- Easily one of my favorite Brooklyn beers so far. The alcohol was a bit strong but I know that this is a very fresh batch. I expect the alcohol to die down a bit with some age."
"All-in-all, I will be picking up some of this every year from now on. It's great, but not ground breaking."
"Quite drinkable, decently thick and nicely creamy."
"Pours pitch black with two finger light brown head, leaves a thin ring and a sheet of lace. Smell: lots of dark and bitter chocolate over a little roastiness, light notes of prune and booze. Taste: bitter, dark chocolate, roasted and more roasted, overripe dark fruit, finishes with a touch of spicy hops and drying bitter chocolate + roasty coffee. A nice ris with heavy emphasis on the chocolate, and still at a decent price."
"Overall, a very solid RIS. Excellent drinkability and a boat load of flavor and substance. So glad I traded for more than a 4 pack of this. Thanks Bryan and Chris!"
"I had to score a 4.0 on drinkability as it's tough to have more than one of these with the full body and high abv. It's a sipper for sure, but I enjoy every sip. Take it slow... savor... it's only here once a year...."
"A must try if you can find it. This is the first year it's been released in TX and I plan to cellar the rest I have and try them after year or 2."
"Poured out into a New Belgium Chalice dark black with a thin tan head. Minimal lacing. I'd like seeing a bigger head out of this. I'm going to have to skip the smell because it's allergy season, but what I can smell is a hint of alcohol. That alcohol is very apparent in the mouthfeel. The taste of roasted cocoa comes out in the flavor rather quickly. It's very smooth if you can get over the alcohol burn on the tounge, which I don't mind. No strong spices are evident. Not too dry of a mouthfeel either."
"Overall, this was pretty good and I hope I get the chance to taste one back in the US to compare"
"drinkability is good and though it is 10%abv i could drink a few every night in the winter"
"D - Definately will search this fresh but will say that even with some time on it I could definately have another."
"notes- would have consumed the beer six months ago, probably lost some of its body. this review is for a 2002 vintage tasted in 2004"
"D- This is not the same beer I had a year ago on tap. I think it might have been dirty lines or something. This is phenomenal compared to what I remember. Really smooth, and well hidden alcohol for a RIS. This would be a nice beer to keep on hand during the winter months."
"D: A good solid RIS. Wonderful, and the alcohol is well hidden."
"This is a drinkable, impressibe stout that covers the 10 percent ABV well."
"this is one of those beers you need try"
"Drinkability is quite nice. Not as strong as other imperial stouts I've had so I could see maybe having two of these at a time. But it is definitely something you sip and savor for a while. A very nice example of this style."
"For the price that I paid ($1.99 for a single), this is a great stout, and I would recommend trying it if you get a chance."
"MF&D - it looked good, tasted alright, went down quite well. a good bargain for a decent russian beer."
"Aroma is sweet, filled with alcohol, roasted malt and chocolate, very pleasing. Mouthfeel is thick with some solvent-like character on the back end of the throat followed by a roasted aftertaste. Drinkability is moderate, the warmth of the beer makes it a little hard to drink but it is surprisingly flavorful. I really like this beer. I don't get a whole lot of chocolate in the palate but overall the beer is well balanced."
"M/D: Pretty creamy, a bit of an alcohol burn as mentioned. Low carbonation and a pleasant sweet aftertaste."
"High quality, low price. Great stout!"
"Overall: Really good drinkability for the ABV. Very sweet and strong roasted malt are most prevalent. Very little chocolate, but this is about 8 months old. Very yummy stout though."
"Really beautiful pour, its as black as it promises with a nice tan head. The aroma is sweet with dark chocolate, a little coffee and roasted malt. The real victory here is the mouthfeel and taste. I love Imperial Stouts, but sometimes they can be over the top with the alcohol and its burns or warms the throat too much, while not providing enough flavor. The Brooklyn Brewery delivers!"
"D: It took me a while to get this beer, but now that I do, it's a very solid RIS. Definitely a cigar beer. I'd like to try it with some gourmet chocolate sometime."
"D: This is a pretty heavy beer and one that sips nicely over a long period of time."
"This is the second time I had this beer, and I liked it even more the second time around. Great Job BB!"
"Despite the weight and the alcohol I can see being able to drink a lot of this, and that definitely speaks to the way it carries the heavy array of sweetness, cocoa and booze. The slight hop presence and cocoa nib bitterness on the finish definitely help in relieving that. Overall surprisingly drinkable, perfect winter warmer."
"I found this brew rather disappointing."
"This stuff is way to easy to put down. A growler is just so smooth compared to the bottled version, unless it is cellared. Nonetheless you can just about chug this one if you want but it would be such a waste. Savor this one folks. Not many are this well constructed."
"Very good."
"very full and very thick. was ok, but not a major fan of dark dark chocolate. was a bit hard to handle."
"4 M&4.5 D: medium-bodied, oily on the texture, richly flavoured but never too alcoholic to jeopardise the harmonious palate. All in all, I find this vintage more interesting and complex than my previous encounter, but this bottle is served less cool and also consumed well after the ale was poured (40 minutes) - maybe ""decanting"" actually helps to bring out the best?! Marvellous beer!"
"Drinkability- The alcohol can be a bit much at times but it ages exceptionally well as a result and mellows over time. Upon release it's pretty forceful and may scare away the faint of heart but after you've had a glass you'll never be the same. Definitely works well as an after dinner beer either with deserts or by itself. If you're a beer cocktail kind of person, drop a scoop of ice cream in and make a float."
"Overall, a good beer that I would highly recommend. A bit of age does wonders for this stout. Thanks to Sanatar for contributing to this mini vertical!"
"D- Fresh on-tap or aged, this is a damn good beer. I think I prefer the aged bottle version, just because there are more interesting flavors present. Good stuff. Goes down smooth."
"etc: ""bottled winter 08-09"""
"D: Lovely. I want to age my other two for at least a year and see how they compare in 2010 and 2011. (Damn, I can't believe I'm typing decade numbers for the 2000's already!!!)"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle an opaque black with a dark tan head that leaves nice lacing behind. Nose is mostly of dark chocolate as the name implies, when cold it reminds me of chocolate icecream. Taste is overwhelmingly roasty with very nice taste of dark chocolate. There is a slight coffee aftertaste. The alcohol in this beer is extremely well hidden at 10%, and it has a nice full mouthfeel. This beer is quite drinkable considering the alcohol content, but i wouldn't want more than a couple."
"EDIT: Come back to bump my scores. I've had a lot of stouts since I reviewed this one and this one is easily one of my all-time favorites. Can't beat it."
"D: I could cradle this one all night long."
"Tasted like a sweet stout to me. Not what I believe it is in the bottle(or it could of just been tweaked again), but I just might like this version a little better. Actually added 5oz to a little cake batter earlier, so I could be burping this up by the time I'm chewing on that. :D"
"Found this one today at my local store, good find IMO, 2008. Poured pitch black into my pint glass with a dark tan one finger head that disappeared within a minute or two into a blanket on top of the beer. Light to medium lacing throughout the glass. Smelled of chocolate, roasted malts, a bit of alcohol and maybe a hint of fruit. Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, some sweetness, smoke. Maybe a bit of coffee in the smell/taste too. Mouthfeel fell a bit short on this one, a bit on the light side for an imperial. Alcohol hidden very well, good carbonation and smooth feel. Drinkability is good here because the taste is very good and the beer doesnt feel too heavy, no alcohol notes either makes this stout go down good. Very happy that I found this beer 7+ months after its release in a cooler, definitely will buy and age this one in the next release."
"D: I can have many of these without noticing the high ABV. I'd been expecting a bigger kick in the face, but it was solid, a nice nightcap beer, on its own and did not leave me wanting."
"I could sip on these all night. This is a tasty, interesting imperial stout that won't knock-out your taste buds like some others in the same category. 0.5 off only for being so strong in the ABV; you wouldn't be able to finish many of these before they finish you."
"D-High abv, bitterness and malt sweetness made it difficult for me to finish the entire 12oz bottle. Not sessionable for me, I did not wish to have another after finishing this one."
"I'm gonna have to get a bunch to age. This one is a beauty."
"12oz bottle received in trade and shared with Davey and some others. Poured a opaque black with a good tan head, no lacing really. Smells of chocolate and coffee, no big alcohol smell in there for this high of a %. Taste is amazing, chocolate, coffee, some toffee. Thick full bodied beer that is easy to drink."
"CHEERS"
"12 oz brown bottle winter 08'-09' vintage. Obtained at The Lighthouse in Manchester, ME. Ebony in color with a thin dark beige head. Chocolate at first sniff, dark fruity alcoholness with touches of toffee in it. Chocolates and toffee on the tongue, alcohol makes it presence on taste buds. moderate carbonation. Definitely a sipper but well worth it!"
"D - A great sipping beer. This one falls short of the Stone Imperial Russian Stout that I sampled just before it but it's a nice northeast beer."
"D-This beer is a winter seasonal, so I didn't expect to have an opportunity to drink it while I was in New York. However, the Peculiar Pub had bottles of it, and knowing it's high ABV would allow for increased shelf life of this brew, I went for it. It was a rainy day, and relatively cold, so this beer went down very nicely, warming me subtley as I chatted with my table. Very drinkable, very complex."
"m/d - Sweet to style guidelines, drinkable but a sipper though I won't fault it for that, it is afterall an IRS."
"Pours a deep dark black with a gorgeous creamy chocolatey brown head. Smell is chocolate, roasty malts, subtle hops, vanilla, spices and cream. Taste is very roasty and deep, the bitter black chocolate is evident and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is not too rich or creamy, but substantial. Drinkability is great."
"i had one of these when i first purchased back in Oct and it was way too hot...the 7 months of age on it really mellowed it out and the alcohol is non-existent....bitterness is very moderate....excellent a beer with a high ABV....still a sipper but time really turned this into something much more drinkable"
"D- A very solid brew and a sipper for sure."
"D - a great sipping beer, great for a single serving"
"A top notch RIS. I usually buy a sixer or two of this each year."
"Drinkability: One is enough for me, especially with the high ABV. To me this drinks way more like a Baltic Porter than a RIS. It is very sweet, but not in a good way and the alcohol is too pronounced."
"Incredibly smooth, medium long sweet finish. I have 3 more of these delicious beers, thanks to JoeMayo for the trade, and I think I'll save them for a rainy day. To emulate Mr. Oliver, I'll think I'll try and pair this with some food. Perhaps with a chicken with mole sauce from my local Mexican joint, and I'll have another one for dessert! Cheers!"
"Overall - For everyday drinking, I'm a pale ale/lager/hefe guy. But sometimes, you just want a big bold stout to sip and savor. Another great beer from the magic man in Brooklyn. Thank you, Garret Oliver."
"Drinkability: more on the bitter than the sweet side, and quite strong for a chocolate stout. Perhaps a dessert beer to complement a sweeter dish."
"Overall, a really good beer. I've been into stouts lately and I really enjoy this one, it's strong, but not too bitter or alcoholic. Not the best, but very good."
"What's nice is I can buy this localy in NH, Maine and Mass. This is one of my ""go to"" beers I always have in the house and recommend it to all stout lovers."
"D - The alcohol in the taste doesn't really do anything to take away from the enjoyment of this beer. Goes down easy."
"A great imperial stout, but there are lots of better imperial stous out there!"
"Another beer brought back from Chicago, this is a tasty big stout that delivers on the dark chocolate in its name."
"Drinkability is fine for the style, very rich but good for sipping with some rich food. Overall very enjoyable."
"i bought a few extra bottles that will try to go unnoticed until next winter, when they are needed most!"
"D - One big, bad ass beer. I love it, but not two."
"Single poured into a 12 oz tumbler. Pitch black in color, fast dissipating caramel head and no lacing. Smells are of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. Taste is pretty pungent, chocolate in the front with the malt and a little ABV push in the back. Slick on the palate, moderate carbonation making the experience lively. Great sipper and a rep of the style. Will come back soon. Recommended."
"Poured into pint glass, thick opaque black with wonderful looking chocolatey head that unfortunately dissipates quickly. Smells of chocolate, malt and booze. Taste is decadent chocolate with a roast coffee back taste and a nice, boozy aftertaste. Nice and thick with good amount of carbonation that pleased the palate. Definitely a rich drink that I don't think I could frequently consume. Very enjoyable though."
"Very hard to drink more than one of these. I enjoy it, but it's a boozy sipper."
"D - This is a good beer. Personally I probably couldn't drink more than one, but that's just me. I'd call this a definite dessert beer in my book. Sweet brew....very sweet."
"D~ I would drink more than 1 if I could. This is a tough but sweet brew. I call it a desert beer."
"Poured pitch black with a tan/brown head with a hint of red. Head dissipated quickly and had medium lacing. Aroma is pronounced, but not overpowering. Chocolate is noticeable first, then roasted malt, burnt marshmallow, and a bit of coffee. Chocolate takes precedent, but aroma is well-balanced and very inviting. Taste follows the aroma with chocolate coming through first, followed by an ester sweetness, soft notes of roasted malt, a bit of burnt marshmallow, coffee, with more chocolate in the finish. This beer is thick, full-bodied, and smooth. Velvety. While very enjoyable, this beer is a bit heavy and 10% ABV prevents me from having more than one."
"D - I enjoyd this more than when I originally had this perhaps two years ago. Maybe it's because I've been on a big stout kick lately. Either way, this is a pretty bangin' RIS that wears its drinkability on its sleeve. At 10.6%, this remains extremely drinkable throughout."
"The body is a little thinner than expected, the carbonation is spot on. A good smooth mouthfeel with a nice warming from the high ABV. An excellent RIS that reminds me alot of GI BCS in the taste dept. Another great offering from Brooklyn and a big thanks to Aaron for hooking me up!"
"D - Awesome. I like ´em both fresh and aged. I enjoyed this one with a dark chocolate Easter egg. Sublime!"
"I really enjoyed this RIS from the folks at Brooklyn."
"Pours pitch black with a nice brown head. Aroma of mostly dark chocolate and some coffee. Incredible tasting, fairly smooth, little on the bitter side but goes down easy. Gets better as you warm it up. I had a second one with creme brulee and it was awesome. I love this beer. I am glad we will be seeing this beer in Texas soon."
"Deep black, with a dark brown head. Tastes of chocolate, coffee and dark malt. Very smooth, little carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable and warm up front, nice bitter finish. Overall the word ""thick"" comes to mind, a great one -off in my opinion. Not a beer I could drink more than one of, but the one is enough."
"In fact, I'm gonna throw my second in the cellar."
"Drinkability- Delicious and oh so full bodied, yet the 10% ABV will diminish how many you'll be able to enjoy, though enjoy you will."
"This beer really exemplifies an American style imperial stout. This beer is one of the east coasts finest selections of consumable liquids In the short, hard, cold days of winter in New England."
"This pours jet black, with little to no lacing. You can smell the chocolate & coffee in the pour and the taste matches the smell. Overall I found the aftertaste a little bitter, more coffee than chocolate. Definitely packs a punch with the 10% ABV. Not the finest I have tasted, but well worth trying again."
"D - This beer is highly drinkable, and at 10% quite potent as well. I feel like the title is a bit misleading though. The chocolate is only hinted, coffee flavors shine through much stronger."
"Winter 07-08 vintage. Pored from a 12 ounce bottle into my snifter glass. Appears an opaque black color with about two fingers of dark tan foam. Smells of molasses, caramel, alcohol, and chocolate malts. Tastes of alcohol, both milk and dark chocolate, mocha, coffee beans, caramel, molasses, rich roasted grains, plums, and more cocoa. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Even after a year plus in the bottle, the alcohol is still quite apparent from start to finish. A great, classic sipping beer for a cool evening."
"This beer is a great imperial but at 10.6 it is hard to hide the alcohol. The appearance is midnight black with a dark brown small head. The head becomes very small and lingers for a while. The smell is of bakers chocolate and malts very aromatic but the alcohol can definitely be picked out of the aroma. The alcohol is very prevalent in the taste too as to be expected in imperials but maybe a little more than some are used to. The flavor that pops out the most is dark to bakers chocolate obviously but the malts definitely add to the smoothness of the taste. The mouthfeel is smooth and light this is one of the best qualities of the beer in my opinion. hard to drink more than two or three of these at a time but i will definitely be going back to this beer again next winter could be great aged too."
"This is a dark, beautiful beer, with a cappuccino head that disappears pretty quickly. Smells like burnt crystal malt, and has an alcohol twang. I get a rush of caramel, espresso, dark chocolate, and that smelt roasted malt doesnt leave the palate immediately, in fact, it lingers like how a well written song dancing in the recesses of your mind. Im going to let 2 of these age for a while and see if they get better over time. This is winter 08-09 in 12 oz bottles picked up in Brooklyn. Wonderful mouthfeel, and doesnt really have that alcohol kick that some beers at 10.6 have. wonderful example of the style."
"Comes out of the bottle a rich, nearly opaque sable with a fairly thick tan head. Aroma is strong and inviting, like semi-sweet chocolate mixed with roast coffee. Flavor is chocolaty and has undertones of coffee and smoke, with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Texture is silky-smooth and has a good tingle. Lip-smacking and very satisfying."
"Over all the one everyone liked the best was the 05-06, then 08-09 and the last was 07-08."
"Final Thoughts - This brew is incredible. Brooklyn Brewing company produced an excellent Russian Imperial Stout here. Incredible is the only way to explain it. Try one!"
"Drinkability: As with most imperial stouts I find this quite sipable but not something I want to consume more than one of in one evening. Each sip leaves me wanting a bit more both to enjoy and to try and pin down the different flavors, etc. It will be interesting to see what a year or more of bottle age does with this beer and how it comes out with a 3 or 4 year vertical tasting."
"Notes: After sampling this beer a few times for this review I also paired it with a brownie with nuts, something I recommend doing. Michael Jackson recommends eating it with the Viennese desert Sachertorte, something I'll have to try some day. Overall this beer is good, but it isn't great. I'm anxious to lay down the extra six-pack I bought and try it in a year and so in hopes that the strong alcohol flavors will diminish and the taste will smooth out. Look for another review in a year or so."
"Lovely drinkability. Lovely beer!!!"
"... and so too can the desire for Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout!"
"Drinkability: Phew - take it slow. I think of it as ""naptime"" beer, as in, I wanted to go to sleep as I finished drinking it."
"D- for 10+% alcohol is very well hidden. its noticeable alright, but with all the other flavors/smells goin on, it seems subtle. on the level with the best RISs i've had."
"Drinkability: With the higher ABV, nothing beyond one serving for me. An amazing beer though and I will definitely have it again. A great way to end the night."
"D: One is the limit, but it's a delicious one."
"seasonal draft selection at matchbox in chinatown, dc. 3/6/09"
"D= I guess if you love the stuff, maybe a few bottles at a sitting."
"D - For the high ABV, this beer is highly drinkable. Although it is a sipper, I do not see myself denying a second helping. I could imagine two back to back BCS beers in succession would make you feel rather buzzed, and that is a nice feeling."
"Tizzasty. Whoo! Dark black, brown head, rich, a strong alcohol flavor, powerful as all hell. Really, really thick mouthfeel. One of the most opaque beers you're gonna find out there. A real imperial stout that is not to be messed with. Not a great session beer due to the strong flavor and the high alcohol content, but the upshot is that one beer will get you drunk, so it all turns out okay in the end. The intense alcohol flavor cancels out some of the richness a bit - I prefer some of the richer, more mellow stouts for the most part. And it smells powerfully of alcohol, sugar cane, and other sweet yet really strong things. However this remains a tasty-ass beer. Yessir. I am drunk."
"Mouthfeel: Heavily coats the palette with mild carbonation."
"mouthfeel was heavy body, slightly crisp and carbonated up front, smooths out nicely with alcohol present throughout."
"This is a very drinkable RIS. By no means a session beer, it is extremely enjoyable from start to finish."
"D/O: This is a beer that needs some time, IMO. It's a little too hot and one-dimensional right now, with the dominance of the sweet chocolate flavor really overpowering whatever else might be trying to reveal itself. I'd like to see a bit more balance from a roasty flavor to offset the sweetness. This is a prime candidate for the cellar, though, and I believe it has the proper characteristics to improve with age."
"Very smooth and creamy on the hit. Mouthfeel is just perfect - not too thick at all. Finishes with bitters and chocolate. BBCS really is all about the C."
"This beer is impenetrable, midnight black. Beautiful. The head is thin and off-white to tan in color. It tastes quite bitter and ashy. The chocolate flavor resonates like a bitter dark cocoa, but it's not overwhelmingly chocolaty. It's very enjoyable to sip on a cold day. Smooth down the hatch, and the effect is almost like comfort food."
"great beer, realtively new to brooklyn and russian imperial stouts. appearance is night black, looks like dark roast coffee, with a nice off white brown head. the head sticks around and laces the glass quite well. lots of great sweet and marlty flavors in the nose. great great flavors, the taste is without a doubt my favorite aspect of this beer. the alcohol is very present, along with the dark, bittersweet flavor of unsweetened chocolates and malts. great beer. only could drink a few or so, but the mouthfeel is super smooth and silky. awesome beer."
"D: Let this one warm a bit and sip it slowly by the mouthfull; you'll be pleased."
"Picked up a sixpack of this when I was in Boston for work. Since we cannot get Brooklyn in WI, I was excited to try this. It pours out very black with a mocha colored head that rises rapidly, but controlled, at the end of the pour. The aroma very heavy on the burnt sugars, molasses, and sweet cocoa nibs. The taste comes through a bit hot on the alcohol and the maltiness shines through. There are definitely major layers of roasted malts, but it becomes a bit messy at times. The flavor is clearly evident but the balance is lacking. I would have liked a little stronger roasted profile to tone down the sweetness. No doubt a nice stout that makes itself known, but I am a bit surprised to see such a widespread love for this with all the other wonderful stouts out there."
"The beer had a heavy body with good carbonation. The beer was thick/chewy, rich and creamy. Overall an excellent beer and one that I will be picking up every winter. Brooklyn brewery is one of the best in the country."
"D: For saying chocolate on the label, this beer is not very sweet. Also, I like how the carbonation makes it feel light and not like you are drinking a ""dessert beverage"". With its dry finish, this beer is very drinkable."
"A sipper, but a good beer no less. Excellent job."
"D: Considering the high ABV, you might not want to have a few of these. The taste is ""oh so good"" though! Great beer for a cold night."
"Notes: 355 ml bottle poured into an Imperial Pint Glass. No BBE or freshness date was found on the bottle."
"Overall: What an awesome beer! Really hope I can find it on tap sometime. Aging some for later, I'd bet this beer will only get better with time. Excellent RIS."
"I've had this one in my fridge for a while so I decided to finally give it a try. Poured into a pint glass it poured a very dark black with a tan/brown head that didn't stay around much at all. Smells of chocolate and something else a bit sweet. The taste has a coffee and chocolate taste. The roasted malts really stand out. The mouthfeel is thick and very nice and for having a high ABV this beer definitely drinkable. I could drink a few and not notice the alcohol to much and actually be able to enjoy it."
"This is a nice beer, but I gave samples to five friends who are just getting to IS with sample of Old Rasputin and this was thrown aside. FYI Garrett."
"Drinkability: I've had this beer quite a few times, and I'm always amazed by the fact that it's made solely from malt, hops, water and yeast, and no chocolate additives. How one can make ingredients such as these to taste this good is quite astonishing. However, although it's a rather bold and edgy imperial stout with it's emphasis primarily on chocolate and roasted flavors, it still lacks some complexity. But it's still, highly highly recommended."
"The drinkability on this is good, but it is most certainly a sipping beer to be had at ""special occasions", whatever those might be. I however will agree with the others and say that after one of these, I am done for the evening. I already had another tonight that was 8%, but with this 10% brew I am ready to turn in for the evening. A perfect nightcap for a beer drinker who prefers the darker beers."
"D: Let this one warm a bit and sip it slowly by the mouthfull; you'll be pleased."
"Notes: What a great beer as so very affordable compared to others in its style. A great beer from Brooklyn. Great job Garret."
"Imbibers of this unctous brew will revel at its thickness and black color - I mean black. Small coffee brown head providing sweet malty aromas of molasses, licorice, day old coffee and roast grain. Huge mouthfeel blankets the tongue and envelops it with chocolate and roasted goodness. This has a creamy sweet profile, and you can tell it is a massive stout but hides the 10% pretty well. For everything good here, this lacks a bit of complexity I was expecting for such a massive tour de force in beer making. The finish could be longer for my tastes..."
"A Russian Imperial Stout that has made it to my list of regular favorites."
"Not as thick and rich as I was expecting, not necessarily a bad thing. Very roasty, pushes the roasty cocoa bean limit but never crosses the line (is there one?!) Coffee notes are noticeable as is the hop bitterness. Hides the ABV quite well and I like the fact it is not as sweet as TenFidy and Yeti. Great drinking RIS straight off the line, no aging necessary. A very well crafted beer, just delicious."
"D: Not the best in the style, however not too shabby. Imperial is clearly defined for this brew and perhaps some masking of the ABV may be in order to smoothen the rough edges."
"Overall, an excellent, memorable, and unique brew, and one to come back to every winter."
"12oz bottle received in trade compliments of kiefdog(thanks Kevin!) Poured into pint glass. Pours jet black with a half finger of tan head. Smell is very light but chocolatey and roasty. Taste is immediatly in your face chocolate backed up by toasty malts and cocoa with a slight hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and coats the tongue. An extremely drinkable stout. Alcohol is very well hidden. I look forward to having one of these again."
"Pitch black colour, creamy brown head, nice lacing. Aroma is heavily roasted with notes of coffee, dark chocolate, sweet licorice and honey, the ABV is also present in the nose. Flavours are the same as in the aroma with bitterness and a powerful aftertaste with some astringency. Mouthfeel is oily and very smooth. This Imperial stout is very good and maybe the best value for money you can find out there. This was the 08/09 edition with 10,0% I have a couple of 07/08 for cellaring and will do the same with a couple of this years edition."
"This is one of my favorites. For the price it cannot be touched. Extremely complex maltiness with lots of alcohol, and the most pleasing abundant carbonation I have ever seen in a beverage.. Not joking I can open one, drink half, and put the rest back in the fridge for tomorrow I love this stuff"
"Much darker chocolate and coffee taste then the smell suggested. Bitterness seems to come from both hops and chocolate, but no hop character otherwise. Some toasted bread notes as well. Medium to full bodied in mouth feel with little carbonation and a dry aftertaste. A decent brew I would suggest if you come by it."
"D - The flavors mask the abv...I was surprised at how quickly I could drink this one down...very tasty..."
"D= This is a great beer that can certainly use some aging. For maximum effect, this beer needs to be served just slightly cooler than room temp. I think that if the roughness of the hops and the bitter roastiness mellowed a bit in the cellar, this would be a world class beer."
"Needs to be aged at least a year to be palletable to my sissified taste buds."
"Overall, I think this is a very good imperial stout and will definitely keep my eyes open for this and other Brooklyn beers. The alcohol is nicely hidden and not so strong that you can't handle more than one."
"(NOTE - a more positive re-review is forthcoming)"
"Drinkability- for a 10% RIS, this is very drinkable, though I don't think I will have another tonight."
"Overall a very nice stout but not the best."
"D - A very enjoyable stout with an extraordinary dark chocolate character. The lingering flavor is a dead accurate imitation of lindt 75% chocolate. This is a rare beer that is more than the sum of its parts."
" Overall, good price and alcohol content. But i'd pick up some old rasputin next time."
"Poured this beer from a 12 oz bottle. Poured black with a brownish head. Left a thin coller around the glass. This beer did not impress me. It was a solid beer, but did not stand out against other beers in this category. it was a solid beer, but I would not put out the effort to get it again."
"D: Good. Not cloying and the taste hides the alcohol reasonably well."
"Nice beer to have on a fairly regular basis. Cheap and definitely quality, though not a truly elite RIS in my opinion."
"Very light mouthfeel and low carbonation. A little on the thin side."
"Very drinkable, but a little heavy to be a session beer. One or two go down quite easily though."
"D - I really enjoyed this Stout, and being that Brooklyn will finally open up to the La market this year, I really hope this beer gets down here for next Christmas"
"My Thanks Goes to donkeyrunner, your awesome."
"Overall impression: Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. I'm glad I have a few extra of these to cellar, and will seriously consider seeking out some more."
"Quite a remarkable beer. A stout that has a wonderful sweetness as well as a defined bitterness that is amazingly balanced. Quite an accomplishment. Big Props."
"I like this beer, but I don't love it. It may be my unfamiliarity with the style, or my nagging sense that Brooklyn brews big beers rather than better ones. Often I feel like they're high end offerings gimme a black eye. But then again, I need to try more of their standard year-round stuff to be able to judge better."
"I bought this beer at the same time as Southern Tier's Imperial Choklat Stout. I think that they are both great showings for the style. I wish this beer had a bit more aroma. Other than that I think that this beer is quite nice to drink on cold nights (like tonight). Enjoy."
"This is a very good beer."
"One of my favorite seasonal stouts and a fine chocolate stout as well. Brooklyn does not disappoint with this walloping of 10.2 percent alcohol which tastes so good you would like to keep drinking more then you should. This is one I am going to save some for the rest of the year and age some as well. A seasonal to look forward to. If you have yet to try it go get them now while you can still find em."
"Review is from the ""winter 08-09"" bottling. This beer ages well and is a little raw tasting when first purchased. After about a month the strong alcohol taste starts to fade in to the background behind the chocolate.. Pick up some extra and let it sit till next year."
"drinkability: probably one of the best stouts I have ever had."
"Drinkability, as far as RIS goes this is great for the value and a great beer."
"...but the alcohol flavor is very present. It is 10% alcohol you know."
"Overall - I love this beer and purchase it regularly. I don't think there is any issue with the ABV and there being too much alcohol in the taste. I will continue to drink this wonderful chocolate excursion and suggest it to others."
"An outstanding beer at an outstanding price, pours very dark with great lacing, smells a bit like chocolate, a bit like coffee, and disquises some hops in there, and finishes almost a bit sweet. Taste is bitter chocolate with a bit of a kick, it does not hide the high alcohol content. Feels a bit heavy or creamy, and is sure to improve with age. Buy some for now and some for later. Easy to enjoy and drink slowly."
"D: Definitely THE most drinkable RIS I've had, which is dangerous. The ABV can sneak up on you, and it's really easy to drink so you've got to watch it! Still, this an unbeatable beer for the value and I'm glad I've sequestered the rest of the 6 pack in my cellar--it gives me something to look forward to next year."
"not too boozy. i could drink a couple of these and dont find it too much of a sipper!"
"d-i can only stomach 3 of these at the time...although i gave it a 5 on drinkability due to the fac that this is such a great beer..ive had several sixers of this this year so far and i dont think i can get enough until the rabid duck returns"
"Drinkability: A sipper for sure. I (Nick) only had about 7-8oz; the remainder went to wiseman/roommate Zach. This beer reminded me of Bourbon County Stout: really thick, syrupy, and high in ABV with big, bold flavors throughout. I wouldn't ever drink anymore than one bottle of either beer, but I'd enjoy the nice, long sesh. All in all, I'd prefer something a bit more like Old Rasputin when it comes to drinkability. Still, very, very good."
"D - This was a delicious after dinner drink. I was happy to try it on tap."
"D: For a RIS, this is quite drinkable. I mean I wouldn't have more than two in a night, but I could find myself craving this. And for the price, it can't be beat."
"it is drinkable in the sense that i enjoyed drinking it. high alcohol content and nature of the brew make it hard to drink more than one. great dessert beer or one to sit and just sip and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel: Alcohol is a little more hidden than older ones, creamy texture, fuller bodied. Easy to drink, tasty fresher"
"Overall impression: This is a good chocolate stout, but could stand to have the alcohol a bit more hidden. That said, whereas many chocolate stouts have a desserty character, this is a chocolate stout for grown ups!"
"Overall a kick-ass IS for its huge flavor, drinkability and value."
"It looks nice really. Perfectly black with a nice brown head that sits on top. The head kind of fades to just a few rings and swirls of bubbles. There's a tiny bit of lacing and bubbles cascade down as you drink. The smell is decent, you get a hint of alcohol with some chocolate and roasted malts. The taste was kind of harsh, even a few months after I first purchased it. I remember thinking it was nice and sweet at first with a nice taste of chocolate, and its still there, but after finding lots of other imperial stouts, I realize that this one doesn't quite make it to the top. There's an intense bitterness and burn from the alcohol and the dark roasted malts. It's kind of smooth, but I get this feeling that's like eating a slimy fruit or something. I can't actually tell whether this beer is thick or thin. It actually drinks rather quickly, and I enjoy it, but it could be better. Try it some time."
"Drinkability - No more than one a night on this offering. I good presentation and interpretation of the style. I would think aging this would have some merit. I may give that a try. Sure, I'd have this again."
"This is a creamy, rich delicacy that is hard for me to nurse. This is an exceptional beer."
"D - A good beer to have on hand for those cold winter days."
"J"
"The beer pours a thick inky black color with a dark brown head. Very little retention, but nice lacing. The aroma is of bitter dark chocolate and black malts. It's a very robust and hearty beer. The taste is of a bittersweet dark chocolate. The beer is thick and has an elevated abv which contributes to a very well-rounded stout. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with decent carbonation. A very good and easy to drink stout."
"Overall a great beer, especially in these cold winter months in PA. For right at 40 bucks a case, it's hard to beat."
"Very thick and full bodied! Can't wait to try BLACK OPS"
"Notes - Quite a good brew overall I would say. I like the fact that there's a bit of hops in the taste, although this detracts from it's smoothness a bit (despite the fact that I still think the hops add a bit of character and depth to it). Well-crafted and very delicious."
"Overall a great beer."
"It is definitely drinkable, I just need to enjoy it a little faster I guess. This is actually the second six of this I have purchased, so it's not like the alcohol is stopping me from buying more. I'm not sure about everywhere else, but you can't beat the taste, ABV, quality, and quantity for the price in RI/MA."
"I bought a 6 and laid 4 in the cellar. I've tried a year old BBCS but look forward to seeing how this beauty mellows with some more time."
"D - Flavor wise, this is a very balanced and drinkable stout. If you're the type of person to down several RIS at a sitting, then this one should fit the bill. I personally enjoy savoring one bottle and that's about all I can handle due to the richness and ABV."
"I grabbed a few of these, and I am pumped about putting some away to give a try next year, and the following year...if I can wait that long."
"Notes - This is a very good RIS. It's nice to taste the kid brother to Black Ops."
"I had this beer on tap yesterday and was extremely impressed. It was jet-black in color and poured with a nice creamy head to it. The smell was an incredibly strong dark chocolate scent and i hoped the taste would follow suit. A really smooth feel and a delicious dark chocolate after taste that slowly faded after each sip. Highly recommended."
"A great treat on a cold winter day, and one of the best Imperial Stouts I've tried yet."
"It's very drinkable for a heavy beer and you don't realize it has a very high ABV."
"Typical of the style, this beer was on the thicker side, which also hurt it's drinkability rating for me."
"A great RIS. The chocolate in this works perfectly with the roasted malt. Plus for the price, you can't beat this deal. I just wish this was available year round!"
"Notes from: 5/31/04"
"Quite a beer from Brooklyn. I've had it before, but am thoroughly impressed."
"All in all, a very solid beer. I would be happy to have more in my fridge (they are not available in CA) but I would not seek it out."
"D- The harshness of the alcohol and over abundance of dark fruits was a bit off putting and i would have trouble cracking open a second. I hope the chocolate comes out more with some age on it. Still, a nice RIS from an awesome brewery. I'm going to have to seek out this Black Ops now."
"Its pretty great, very sweet, but not too much."
"Peace out."
"Delicious, very sweet--definitely a dessert beer. Not all that complex, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Overall, a pretty tasty beer. A bit rough while fresh though and would probably benefit from a bit of age. Definitely worth a try though."
"Pours pitch black from the bottle to form a small brown head that dissapates very quickly. Leaves some lacing after first few small sips. Not getting much on the nose but what I do smell is good. Lots of coffee, of course the chocolate come through quite well with a bit of alcohol also. Lots more flavor than the smell was giving me. Intense roasted barley, a bit of coffee, and chocolate flavors coming through together to please my palate to complete satisfaction. The only criticism would be the alcohol isn't well hidden but at over ten percent i guess it gets a little hard to hide. Overall a fantastic beer that i can't get a enough of while it is still here for us to enjoy this winter season."
"Drinkability - The first one went down pretty easy, but the ones afterwards were much harder to drink. The 10% ABV and heavy body make this a one and done in most cases. Can't beat the price either, I got this for $10 for a 6 pack, compared to $15 around here for a sixer of Mad Elf which is only 1% higher."
"At 10% ABV, obviously you wouldn't want to wack down too many of these. But it's very smooth going down, perfect to accompany a nice dinner or dessert. Recommended."
"A very good stout that I will seek out again."
"D - Fairly easy to drink given the masking of the alcohol, but found it overall to be quite average."
"Overall, this beer was awesome on-tap. I was not expecting the taste to be so smooth. The chocolate and dark fruit just added to the wonderful complexity of this beer."
"Booyah. I've loved this beer since the first time I tried it 3 years ago. It's balanced & drinkable with a whole lot of complexity. Can't wait to try Black Ops."
"Drinkability: Yum. Very impressed. I have the remaining 5 from the six pack and some of these are definitely going in the cellar. At $8.99 for a six pack, this is nearly half the price of some of the other RIS I usually age."
"D - Not really. 10.6% and not that impressed. Would I drink again...ok...but I would never purchase this beer. Enough said."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a completely opaque black color. The head was one finger of maple brown foam. The retention was moderate, the lacing about the same. The aroma was a rich blend of caramel, toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, ripened fruit esters and hints of alcohol. The flavors were at first rather sweet, the caramel and toffee being up front. This then mellowed out and became more chocolate, coffee and roasted malt based. Hints of dark fruit peaked out in the middle along with some alcohol heat before leading to a long, bitter espresso finish. Complex, rich and well balanced but not overbearing for 10% (!). The mouthfeel was slightly above average, the soft carbonation perfect for the style, the body full. One of the better beers this brewery makes and worth the shot."
"A very tasty strong stout, but not one for cycling through the four pack in one sitting. The chocolate is deftly rendered as well, so this is also a stellar accompaniment to any of my Mom's care package of Christmas confections."
"I want to buy this by the case."
"tasty but i can imagine that this would only due better with time, can't wait to try cellaring."
"Drink is decent a bit heavy for a sesion brew but a definite must taste and now more than ever one of my true favorites."
"A wonderful winter ale - a wonderful nightcap."
"D: This is a big boozy stout that is marvelously balanced."
"d- very easy to drink due to the thin body and not excessive flavor, ok but not great and i hope their black ops is better.."
"Comments - very good but strong beer.... I love very good but strong beers! its a winter winner!!!!"
"Pitch black with a tan head and incredible lacing. Smell has a bit of alcohol in there which I would expect, but I didn't pick up the alcohol in the taste. Very powerful and tastey. I may have to get another 6er to age."
"Pours a black abyss of a beer with brownish head that dissipates rather quickly. A enticing aroma of chocolate, roast, hints of vanilla, and caramel. Light in body but cumbersome in carbonation; it stings the palate a bit. Flavors of chocolate, wood, alcohol, roast, and coffee notes. The alcohol is masked pretty well but this beer has a carbonated water feel to it rather than milky as I prefer. A stout worth trying but not one of the best."
"This beer is a sipper. At 10.6% ABV, it is deceptively smooth, rich and tame. Thank god I got a six pack."
"I found this on sale at my local beer store for 8.99 a six pack which in my opinion is great for a RIS. It may not measure up to the best Russian Imperial's Stouts out there but for the price its a steal. I plan on going back soon to stock up."
"Ale sits flat out of a wide mouth. Head left a long time ago, the lacing thin but reliable. Light scent of milk chocolate. Small sip reveals light chocolate, minimal carbonation to spicy, dark chocolate and a crisp body. A fairly light, sharp body for such a heavy brew. Barley and hops blend into a cocoa, slightly tangy at times, roasted foundation. A boozey burn hides behind the cooked bean. A slow sipper, simple yet to be respected."
"The mouth is thinner than I expected for a beer this big. This is a wonderful beer to have on this cold snowy evening. While not a session beer (its 10%!), it is VERY drinakable. Well done!!"
"A jet black inky stout with a 2 finger layer of cocoa colored head that dies down after a minute or two to leave a solid lacing. Love swirling this because the beer just clings to the glass and slowly drizzles back into the glass. The smell is vanilla, chocolate, alcohol heat, and the fire charred paper. The Taste steps it even further. The dominant sweet flavor is chocolate. The bitterness is rich, strong, and dries off the sweetness from the palate. The alcohol is spicy and warms the belly. The combination of the vanilla, chocolate, and alcohol heat create an rich festive holiday treat."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with a slight bit of carbonation."
"D- These go down smooth. Very well balanced, IMHO. The ABV gives these some zip so probably best as a sipper."
"I would drink it again but nothing exciting. I missed a lot of the notes other BA's tasted in this beer. Blah..."
"D - This beer only gets better as it gets warmer...although the alcohol is there it's still very drinkable! I'm happy I finally got my hands on a bottle and I'll be going back for another!"
"D: A nice experience. What I was looking for out of this type of beer."
"8/4/8/5/16 (4.1/5)"
"Taste is awesome, though I do think it could be bit more smooth. First impression is very bold, strong, and somewhat alcoholic. Aftertaste is great, deep roast and dark chocolate. Overall, tangy and pretty bitter, just like a good piece of chocolate. Luscious, heavy mouthfeel, which coats the mouth and then some. Some carbonation, but ultimately not a whole lot. Great lacing. Not very ""drinkable"" since it's 10% and really heavy, but my overall impression of the beer is that it's delicious and outstanding. Well done, Brooklyn Brewery."
"This beer is rediculously similar to my brown ale (which was the first beer I ever made). If anyone likes this beer a lot, beer mail me for the recipe."
"drinkability- a very good chocolate stout will get this one again"
"Drinkability good, short session this one and pair with dessert, its beddy bye time."
"i can't wait to see how it ages, got 3 of them cellaring right now..."
"The beer is dark and pours nicely into the glass with a full light chocolate head. The brew lives up to it's name as chocolate dominates the tasking notes from start to finish. In all honesty, I would probably rate the beer a bit higher if it had less alcohol, maybe just because I'd feel freer to drink more than one. Tonight I'm snowed in and am not going to bother plowing the driveway, so I can drink with confidence. However, I do think the alcohol detracts from the taste just a tad, enough to keep it out of the exceptional catagory. The brothers seemed to split on their impression of this beer. I'm in between - it won't be my first choice but I will recommend it to some of my beer loving friends."
"Overall a very good beer from Brooklyn, and worth trying this winter."
"D: The taste has a lot of subtleties that keeps me lifting the glass. Probably wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, but makes for an enjoyable sipper."
"Though the thick mouthfeel and high alcohol make this a slow drinker, it is quite tasty."
"Pours a DARK black with small layer of head on top. Amazing chocolate smell with a hint of malt and coffee. Great mix of chocolate and coffee flavor that has a bit of a bitter taste to it. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated and seems to stay with you with a coffee aftertaste. This is not a beer to drink quickly its something to sit down with relax and enjoy for a little bit. One of my favorite beers that I have had recently and would definately purchase again."
"Very dark brown, impossible to see through. Big pillowy chestnut head that lasts long after the pour, leaves some cocoa colored lacing on the glass. Smell is predominately chocolate and rich roasted coffee very little hop in the nose. Tastes like it smells chocolaty and rich, some bitterness but in a semisweet chocolate sort of way. Really gains complexity as it warms, an almost vinuous,raiseny quality. Thick kind of chalky mouthfeel.Coats the tongue and throat. Delicious and highly drinkable, the alcohol is only slightly perceptable for such a strong brew. One of the best winter seasonals for my money."
"It is worth the try is you like Stouts. I will be harsh on the palette at first but it is a very delicious offering from the Brooklyn Brewing company. I plan to comeback to this again in the future."
"D: This was enjoyable but due to the alcohol level and burnt malt it is a sipper. I can't imagine poundinng this beer, it would hurt. I made it through an entire game of Trivial Pursuit (taking notes throughout) while drinking this one. Still it has its high points and it absolutely stands by the black and chocolate it references in its name. Pretty good stuff."
"This is a top beer for me."
"Black/brown pour with a brown head. Real good with the chocolate and grape type fruit aromas. Roasted malt and chocolate present throughout. Roasted coffee with a clean bite at the finish. Alcohol let's you know it's there, but not overpowering. By far, Brooklyn's best offering."
"I've heard some people say this isn't nearly as good as previous years' editions. This is the first year I've tried Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout, and it is definitely an enjoyable beer, and probably one of my favorites. However, I don't taste the chocolate nearly as much as I thought I would. This beer also gets much better as it warms."
"BL: Very good Imperial Stout. It's not Storm King, but nothing else is, is it? Well worth your time. I'm going to get an additional six to age to see how it works out."
"Drinkability is decent given the amount of booze you're dealing with. This certainly makes for a good warm-up on a cold winter night. And for the record, $10.99 is a pretty good price for a beer like this."
"I'm not a huge fan of fresh BCS, but I could see this being amazing with another year."
"Nice beer & I'd like to try some of Brooklyn's other offerings."
"Stout. Wonderful brown-ish head while carrying that great stout ""dryness"" in terms of mouthfeel. It's roasty and perfect for a cold winter night."
"Nice ring of dark tan foam rests on top of an almost black liquid. Brownies, brownies, brownies in my notstrils. Semi-sweet milk chocolate i believe with a soothing and inviting alcoholic warmth. Dry brownies, semi-sweet chocolate chips in watery cream. Evening blend coffee on the finish and also showcases the alcohol very well. Great nightcap, sipping beer. Just a lovely RIS. This beer deserves all of its accolades."
"This pours frighteningly black. It is a black that the Hubble telescope could not penetrate. It has a brown head that is very slight but can be brought back to life with a little wiggle of the glass. It has the smell of coffee, but not a dark roast. It smells more like Folger's or something. The aroma scatters from there: banana, bubble gum, toffee, brown sugar, alcohol, Coke syrup and... a first aid. The latter is something I could have used after drinking three of these. It has a moderately acidic and salty flavor. It's not the saltiness of sodium chloride. It's more like ammonium chloride. It is full and syrupy with a lively carbonation. The bitter aftertaste persists... as does the hangover. This beer is to be treated with respect."
"Overall: glad I have more"
"Overall: This is one for the cellar. I have 11 left and wanted to taste one fresh just to see what age will do to the rest. The cellar should work wonders on these bad boys. In time it has the makings of an extremely tasty, smooth, and creamy stout. I'll get back to this in 6 months or so for a check in."
"The first thing I noted was the smell of alcohol immediately upon opening the bottle. Pouring this into the glass releases more of the alcohol and then the chocolate just seems to overwhelm it completely. The head forms dark tan over an opaque ""used, burnt motor oil"" colored body. The scent now is all roasted chcolate and sugar or caramel. The taste is a chocolate-lovers dream with a slight fruit note on the side of the tongue (cherry? or maybe more of amaretto?) the alcohol is there but subdued. The mouthfeel is very full, like a mouth full of whipped cream (the real stuff, not the crap in plastic tubs!!) and the finish is dry in the mouth with a chocolate aftertaste having a stronger alcohol presence. The drinkability is very good but at over 10%ABV restraint must be shown. I put some of these back to age and hope to try them later. Will let y'all know if my cellar doesn't ruin'em"
"very enjoyable. I would recommend aging this beer at least a year. It's too raw brand new. This beer ages extremely well. It will mellow out more and more each year"
"really tasty and balanced, for a stout actually flavored mildly. the perfect cold weather beer. but the high alcohol and heavy feel keep this from being absolutely 'drinkable.'"
"This beer is consistently reviewed as an elite-elite RIS. I feel it is somewhat unbalanced as the alcohol dominates in places, but overall, its an absolute pleasure to drink."
"Drinkablity: I will drink this one again, it will definitely go into the rotation."
"D: This is very drinkable. It's like drinking skim chocolate milk. I could drink this everyday, will definitely keep this one on my ""to get"" list and keep stocked in the fridge. Completely dig-a-licious."
"Notes: I keep trying to cellar sixers of this tasty brew but as the winter progresses I find myself attracted to it and the next thing I know I only have a few left. Self control must be displayed around this brew as it gets better with age. This is by far my favorite beer of any beer I have ever reviewed or drank."
"The beer poured an inky-black with a thick, rocky tan head into a chalice. The aroma was a wonderful blend of alcoholic esters and roasted malt. The taste was initially a bit hit of roasted malt with black currant undertones, finishing with a nice alcoholic warmness. This was my first ever keg of beer on my CO2 system - good times."
"Drinkability: It may seem strange but I paired this beer with homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, and they meshed extremely well. I could and would drink this beer all night."
"This is one great brew, but one a night is about all you need. The alcohol definitely strikes hard with this beer."
"D: Very good beer. I am impressed more this time than the first I tasted it. I'm sure this would mellow deliciously with time aged. I'll seek more in the future and stash them for later sampling."
"D = This is just an excellent beer, though strong enough that a bottle split between two after dinner may be all you need at a sitting. It is nonetheless one to come back to again and again."
"At $9 for a six-pack where I get it, this beer packs a nice taste the price."
"To sort of conclude, I like it, but it definitely feels like it needs aged. There's just too much alcohol present in the taste, and I've had RISs that were better."
"Drinkability - Only decent due to style."
"Pours a pitch black with a nice creamy brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate and roasted maltiness. Very, very smooth tasting beer in which the malty dark chocolate masks the high abv. This is a dangerously good beer that taste so smooth that you want to drink it down so fast. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a super dark color, not much head. Smell is faint at best, little chocolate and malt. Taste is thick with mocha and coffee. It's very pleasant. Little alcohol in relation to the abv it has. The mouthfeel is smooth and more crisp than I would imagen with the style and abv. Very drinkable and smooth with nice chocolate malts and caramel and mocha coffee but not overwhelmingly sweet."
"i don't love ris alays due to my dislike of coffee, but this is a very good beer."
"D- This bad boy is high in ABV but this is a good brew. I could do two or three of these in a day. A nice winter beer for when it is snowing out. Instead of hot chocolate grab this bad boy."
"I poured a 12 ounce botttle into a SA pint glass. It pours jet black with a fluffy tan head. The head leaves quickly, leaving pleasant streaks of lacing. The smell is more muted than I would have hoped. There are hints of chocolate and coffee, but they are faint. The overiding scent is alcohol. The flavor is good. It is a mix of alcohol, chocolate and coffee. The finish is of lingering alcohol. The beer is full bodied and hides the generous 10% abv well. A solid RIS, but it left me wanting more."
"This is definatly a sipper and not at all a sessionable brew. Its thick, heavy and filling. Two of these would take me to drunk town in no time. Its an exceptional brew and a perfect example of a chocolate ris. Mouthfeel is not as thick and creamy as others I've had and there is a bit more carbonation up front then I'd hope for. Aside from these things it is a terrific beer."
"Overall, this is just a great reason to look forward to winter. Stay righteous."
"On the downside, I wish the folks at Brooklyn gave this baby a label a little less slick and cosmopolitan looking. It doesn't belong on a RIS. Looks more like a Starbuck's Caffe Latte Malt Liquor."
"A great winter brew for those looking for a substance-driven stout."
"Most surprising for me is the drinkibility. This is a very drinkable beer. It's carbonated enough to keep it from feeling stale, and the alcohol presence, while detectable, is subdued enough to make drinking easy. Some cellaring time can only reinforce this. Kudos to Garrett and the BB crew for an immensely enjoyable RIS."
"Yet another slow sipper for a quiet evening, this beer is completely satisfying to all of the senses, and warms the body."
"Pours a pitch black, motor oil tar black to be exact. Head is creamy and active. Leaves a fair amount of thick lacing. Smell is immediately alcoholic/medicinal, I'm sure it will cure what ails me! Taste is heavenly, chocolate malt abounds! Not quite as extreme as say Young's Double Chocolate but still very good. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy. Sticks to the palate very well to remind you you've just drank a very incredible beer. Drinkability is extremely high. This is a very proper Imperial Stout. These guys know what they are doing for sure. Highly recommended."
"pours how a stout should. opaque. ruby tone at the edges. with an aggressive pour has quite a head with no retention. brown ivory tint. a mellow volume stout. not that thick. good malt. smell is booze, malt, chocolate with a light bitter hop hint. heavier than expected. very hoppy style, but this may be due to the interaction of the hop bitter and the bitter of the chocolate. gives the alcohol a presents which is good but not in the warm port like manner. not metallic in any form. not so much onion like either. great beer. found it for 1.75 in williamsburg corners store. wow to that."
"drinkability: for a 10% brew i could easily put down a 6 pack just watching a football game or something its drinkable to me...one of my favorite RIS"
"Vague tasting notes? Yes, but although I don't have the vocabulary necessary to give a detailed review, I can say it honestly is a great brew."
"I'm gonna save a bottle of this stuff for long-term storage. Can't wait to see how this one turns out!"
"I am away from my castle so this was poured into an oversized wine glass. The rich silky head is a deep tan. The beer is actually much thinner than I would have imagined. I love the dark coffee and chocolate aromas. Toasted malts and rich deep chocolate fill the nose. I can detect a light hint of alcohol as well. Upon first taste I can tell this beer is well hopped and deeply roasted. I don't get as much chocolate as many other people have mentioned. I get lots of coffee. The Chocolate is definately evident in the nose, but not in the flavor (to me). I love the hop character of this one. I have alway enjoyed the RIS style because it gives you the stout flavors with plenty of hops and alcohol to boot."
"pours a thick ink black. nice head, very nice looking in the glass. aromas of coffee, roasted chocolate sweetness, slight alcohol, malty burntness. the taste is amazing. very smooth, roasted and sweet, thick yet smooth, very well balanced. slight alcohol taste running through, but overall very drinkable. definitly the first of it's kind that i can taste the chocolate aspect loud and clear. there might be better russian imperial stouts out there, but not from brooklyn!"
"D: On the whole this is a very drinkable. beer. It's well made and goes down easy."
"Pours a viscous, chocolate black into a pint glass with cocoa, thin head which quickly reduces to a thin cap and leaves grainy lacing. Aroma is espresso, chocolate, burnt toast, berries. Mouthfeel is slick, medium-bodied, a little rough due to medium carbonation. Taste is roasted malts, black coffee, bitter chocolate, toffee up front, then a bit of hops and finishes with a strong alcohol warmth. As it warms the alcohol becomes almost overwhelming. Drinkability is moderate due mostly to the prevalence of the alcohol. This is frequently compared to Storm King; for the record I consider the latter a superior brew."
"wow, 1142 reviews as of this writing. guess I'm late to the party on this one. I picked up one of these brewed for the 08/09 winter season beers. Rich black brew with a chocolate side note but dominated by a roasty note. tasty and one I think might cellar nicely. worth a try if you are like me and haven't gotten to this yet."
"This is the most chocolate bar like RIS Ive ever tasted. If thats your bag and want to feel like eating a rich chocolate bar, this is your beer. A few friends swear by this and the Storm King but I find neither worth writing St Petersburg about."
"A huge recommendation for this beer is to serve it at around room temperature to get the full chocolate experience!"
"Overall, i truly do enjoy this beer...more so once in a while rather than often. Treat it more like the name suggests it to be....chocolate"
"D: The ABV is 10%, so it is not a session beer, but it is a phenomenal beer to drink."
"For me, Imperial Stouts are hit or miss. This one is a friggin grand slam. Assertive yet balanced, simply sublime."
"D. If nothing mattered, I would drink this like water. That would be out of control though, and so would you if you drank too much of this. A must try."
"Deceptively drinkable, this stout's high alcohol content is hidden very well, and the delicious bittersweet flavors and nice balance leave one pining for another. This is a nice, warming beer for a cold evening--just the right beer for a night like this one."
"Poured this in to a tulip glass, and it pours a deep black color with a small tan head. The beer has strong aromas of coffee, vanilla, and a light aroma of chocolate. On first taste the beer is a heavy coffee, burnt malt and slightly sweet, as this warms up the chocolate really shines through. This is a very drinkable excellent RIS but a little heavy to have more then one of."
"Pours a dark chocolate with a decent tan head that leaves a little bit of lace on the way down. Smells of chocolate, caramel, and roast with a hint of wet cardboard and ash. There's still a bit of alcohol in the nose. The flavor is caramel and milk chocolate up front that melts into some roast and ethanol then finishes with a bit of ash, earth, roast, and chalk that linger on the palette long after every sip. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet slick almost syrupy mouthfeel. I enjoy this beer every year and my experience always seems to be a bit different."
"Somewhat thick and creamy, this is a heavy and heady brew that will knock you on your ass, but taste damn good doing so. A warming digestive of a beer, very nice for sipping on a cold night."
"(EDIT: sold in 4 packs now)."
"serving type: bottle"
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout Winter '08-'09 pours an inky black with a chocolate milk colored head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, but could be thicker. The flavor is heavy on dark chocolate up front with a coffee aftertaste. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, this is a sipping beer. I like it. Recommended."
"Pours almost black in colour with thin dark brown head. Smell - roasted malt with chocolate backround. Taste - alcohol hits at first, then roastiness kicks in with chocolate and caramel notes. I think more chocolate would be nice but it's only my opinion. It's pretty balanced beer, even though alcogol is very noticable, thick and silky. I wish it had less alcohol as it gives the beer lack of drinkability, but overall it is a good stout and I'd love to try it on tap."
"A very good RIS. Give it a little more age and it might be perfect. Though it is great to drink as is."
"A marked improvement over the fresh version, a great example of RIS; a great winter brew, and quite cheap comparing to its peers."
"Future outlook: I can get this stuff for considerably cheaper than comparable brews, and it gets pretty good marks on aging, so I imagine that I will be scooping some more of this up soon."
"Overall, expectations were high for this one, and afterwords I was disappointing slightly. However, this is not a bad RIS, just not one in the upper tier."
"All in all, a very pleasant surprise. Definitely more of a desert. Brooklyn Brewery really offers some really good and interesting stuff, and if you come across this stuff definitely give it a shot."
"drinkable is an understatement. this beer is AWESOME"
"It's too heavy to have a lot of, but it tastes so good I could see myself throwing back three or four before realizing what hit me. Then I would stand up, and the floor would hit me."
"Pours black with a nice dark brown head that disappears quickly leaving little if any lacing. Smells of alcohol and dark fruit with some light, sweet smokiness to it- nothing overpowering though, unlike some RIS's, but attractive nonetheless. The taste is also pretty mellow- moderate alcohol up front with more of a ""twang"" to the dark fruit that could be construed as oxidation, although I don't think it is. Maybe a little metallic as well. Since it's so mellow, it makes for an easy drinking beer. The lack of anything really ""extreme"" in the beer is nice to see in a RIS.. sort of bringing it back to basics, but it does show some of its flaws a little easier."
"Overall this is a very solid RIS. It's nice to have something this good that is easily attainable and doesn't require camping out and bottle limits to obtain."
"D: I love this beer, but after aging a case I'm kinda interested to try the fresh 2008-2009, as the year-old lost a lot of the dark chocolate component. Either way, this is a monster, hearty brew that I never have more than one of in a sitting."
"I really enjoyed this, and for the price I found it at, you cant find a beer of this quality and high ABV that is comparable. I will have this on hand all winter for sure."
"08/09 release, pours an impenetrable black with hints of reddish brown at the edges w/ a modest brown cap which dissipates quickly leaving some broken lace in my ommegang chalice ; surprisingly mild smell , a coffee-like aroma mixed w/ faintly vinous wood & piney hop notes, very subtle date (?) and chocolate undertones ; more chocolate in the taste, as well the same strong woody flavor, citrusy hops and i'm going to say a vanilla midway, finish has a roasty bitterness and just a touch of alcohol in it ; a rich, full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and actually quite dry ; a very complex brew, definitely a sipper, but not too heavy, so you could have two to figure out the flavors..."
"2009 - Very consistent year of year... Still a highlight of the late fall / early winter season..."
"Overall just an excellent beer, really looking forward to having a few more when the snow starts to fall. Have a sixer of the 07/08 in the cellar, getting ready to compare how this has aged."
"Wow - chocolate chocolate chocolate. Pours very, very dark, really dark brown head that lasts only a few sips :( Smells unbelievable - really strong aroma full of dark chocolate, sweet fruits, and some coffee. The smell is practically a meal on its own with this beer. Taste is similar to the smell, but actually not as interesting. Still great, though. Good carbonation for my tastes, but I think I may have liked it the general feel of the beer to be a little thicker. Alcohol is blended well, also. I just got a single bottle, and while I really do like this beer quite a bit, I'll probably end up buying an Old Rasputin pack over it, but that's just me. Try it out - the Bowery Whole Foods Beer Room has a TON of them in now."
"A great brew - looking forward to trying other Brooklyn offerings."
"Drinkability: This one is a slow sipper, yet very drinkable without the alcohol content flooring it to the wall. If you like coffee or mocha flavorings you'll easily be able to throw back 3 in a hour. This beer is a ""creeper", easy to drink due to the suttleness of the flavors but it does it's work in the end. A great job by Brooklyn, easily one of their best brews! If you see this in your cooler, grab it, you won't be dissapointed."
"Let me preface this buy saying this is a damn good beer. It pours like motor oil with a nice tannish/white head. Smell is of chocolate malt and some alcohol notes. Taste is of the same but the alcohol taste is subdued. It definitely warms you for sure though and it's a definite sipper. The chocolate taste is very well present but not overdone so it makes for a great tasting beer. I enjoyed this one a lot."
"Good beer, its alcohol still comes through in aging. Waiting for the 08/09 winter release to do a side by side."
"This beer had a great coffee smell, and taste, i held it up to a 100W bulb and couldnt see through it, I find beers of this nature, for me, hard to drink. They seem to be too much, and get dumped after 3/4's. I mean, if stouts/imperial stouts are your thing, youd probably love this, but I wasnt a fan, good job as always by Brooklyn but I would never get again."
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is an afternoon delight. Dark sludgy appearance with tan fizz. Smells, as expected, like a lot of chocolate and serious roasted malt. The taste is similar, but not excessive chocolate. Any time I have a beer with ""coffee"" or ""chocolate"" or ""creme brulee"" in the title, I always worry that the flavors are going to go overboard. Thankfully that is not the case with this one. Very good overall, but not great."
"This is a very drinkable and flavorful stout. I highly recommend it!"
"Drinkability- Super, nigh unparalleled."
"D- at 10% abv the alcohol isnt as well hidden as many other beers in this style. i cant wait to see what this one turns into in a year or three. one was enough for the evening. ill check in on this one fairly often."
"Full-bodied and nicely carbonated, it seems to me that this year's edition Brooklyn's BCS has lots of potential and would benefit greatly from aging. Very boozy and hot right now with extremely limited drinkability as a result. I'll let the rest of the sixer age a while, give it a whirl again, and, if necessary, revise my review accordingly."
"Eric"
"A sipper. A very good sipper. Very very good. But it needs time."
"This is a good solid stout, not perfect, but definitely one tasty brew. I would drink it over and over again."
"Roastiness, chocolate, and hints of alcohol. Starts out with a slight tang amongst the roasted flavors, which quickly subsides to leave a big, roasted malt and chocolate taste with a decent (not huge) body to it. The alcohol becomes more pronounced as it goes down, but doesn't ever come close to overpowering the roasted coffee/chocolate/burnt toast(?) flavors. A very nice brew that, with the addition of a bit more body, could be incredible."
"Pours black with decent tan head. Smelled of matls and smoke aroma. Tasted of roasted malts and chocolate, with some smokey flavor. Mouth is good but malts have a slight bitter finish to them, it smooths fast though and is very easy to drink. Big thing for me is no burn flavor in the malts or chocolate. Try it for sure."
"Only beer I have tried from this brewery along with their Schneider Weiss collaboration and I am sold, this stuff is real good, only beer with more chocolate is Southern Tier's Choklat in my opinion, would drink fairly regularly if it was available near me, recommended"
"A good imperial stout but it still lacks some body i think. This vintage version is a whole lot more balanced than the fresh oned i tried some time ago. Recommended (esp aged!)."
"it pours black as night. no other colors. small creamed coffee color head. very slight lacing. the nose is cocoa beans, roasted chocolate malts, alocohol, toffee. As I took my first sip, I realized that it had a super thick body! I taste notes of roasted coffee beans, very chewy, a little bit too much alcohol taste, roasty roasty malty finish, stickyness is left on your lips for later. This a meal in a bottle, brother!"
"D- I would have to say I really enjoy this beer and what a value. 8.50 for a six pack of 10% beer that's super tasty. Its posses and interesting character in that the alcohol isn't overly present on the palate yet it warms your chest. This will be the first beer I'm going to try aging I'll post updates."
"D - One of the more easy drinking RIS's I've had; though the flavor is very intense and alcohol is more than evident. One is certainly enough."
"M/D - Full bodied and incredibly smooth and creamy. A great RIS but at 11% abv the drinkability gets knocked down 1/2 a point."
"12oz winter 08-09 bottle courtesy of vwcraig, thanks! Black as expected, really nice chocolate stout smell, nice taste of sweet fruit. This is good beer."
"D: Time has done wonders for this beer. I find it way to hot fresh but even with the 8 months or so on it now it gets so damn good. The booziness is gone. All the tastes have melded together nicely. Very well done."
"D- 10.6% is a big brew but the alcohol is extremely well hidden. There is an outstanding complexity to this one, and I will search out as much of this as I can. Garrett, you did an amazing job on this one."
"poured thick black with no head. smell was rich and alcohol. taste was more alcohol up front although as it warmed the chocolate flavor came out. started out at 46 degrees and warmed up to room temp. was far better at room temp. great carbonation and quite smooth. overall, this was great and i would drink again. perfect light chocolate aftertaste."
"This beer pours a thick oily black color. The head is one inch in height, and dark tan in color. Lacing is long lasting and sticky. The aroma is of dark chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, and graham cracker. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of a slight alcohol burn in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a great beer. I could easily drink this over and over again."
"D.One 12oz is enough."
"Six month update: This one has blossomed fantastically now that it has a little age on it. The aggressive alcohol notes have faded, giving the espresso and chocolate flavors even more room to shine. Still not quite as thick as I like my big stouts to be, but it's drier than most, which is a fair compromise."
"Well it took me long enough to finally try this beer, but unfortunately I wasn't missing out on that much. A solid beer all around, but for the style it can't compete with so many other greats."
"Mouthfeel is extremely thick. Almost like cough medicine (just the mouthfeel, not the taste) or syrup. Drinkability is not great, due to the high alcohol content and heaviness of the beer, but it is delicious."
"Poured very thick, dark black with a brown creamy head that impressed me. Nose and taste of rich roasted malt with hints of cocoa and coffee. It had a great malt ptofile and the strong ABV was well hidden. Excellent brew."
"D - A great brew for its style!"
"D: amazing both fresh and aged. solid brew and well worth a try."
"A pretty class brew from a class act trader... Adam we must do it again."
"Unique Imperial, well crafted. My first sampling was with the '04-'05 batch and I've been enjoying this every year since. Pours an incredibly thick jet black with a nice tan head, there is a medium amount of lacing that sticks to the glass. Rich velvety aroma of chocolate and red wine with other dark fruits and roasted nuts. This inviting scent is unique from the other imperial stouts I've had thus warranting the high score. Mouth feel is smooth and sweet. When fresh the sharp alcohol is dominant, but after some age the burn fades and you are presented with a tangy, dry creaminess. Black Chocolate is an applicable name for this one although the standard roasted dark malt and coffee flavors are present there is a nice blend of chocolate malt that seems to take over. This isn't milk chocolate either, dark dense sweet chocolate makes this beer a thing of beauty. Nutty with notes of raisins and sherry wine. Like the aroma this flavor stands out in a unique way. A year in the bottle does wonders for this complex brew. Big bonus points for being somewhat unique comparatively as well as being such a bargain. I stock up every season when this hits the shelves. //Additional notes and rating on 12-14-07 after enjoying a well aged bottle."
"Very nice brew once it warmed up. Serve at cellar temp or warmer or the alcohol stings too much. Fantastic when you get to the last 1/4 of the glass!! Definitely seek out again"
"This beer pours dark black and smells of dark chocolate. The taste is smooth and creamy but is hot on the palate from the high abv which is also present. The drinkability is moderate because of the high upfront abv. Overall an excellent RIS. Not my favorite but its one ive been wanting to try for some time now and im glad I did."
"This was an extra from a trade with sincereNc. Thanks Bro!"
"Dark black color with mocha colored foam head that slowly dissipates. Some prickle that dissipates as well. I have smelled some characteristics of the nose in other imperial stouts. I can smell the chocolate malt but there is something in the nose that makes me think of an irish stout or red ale. Faint hints of smoke. Very lush and very thick mouthfeel. The malts are roasted pretty fully as I almost felt like I was eating roasted corn. Still some smoke at the finish and hints of coffee. The elusive scent presents in the flavor and continues to elude me. Perhaps it is the black malt alluded to on the label. Smoky finish and warm with alcohol. Very strong and powerful flavor. I would rate it B- on straight up flavor and all, but that is me."
"The nose and the appearance were about the same all around. It smelled like black liquorish and looked like it as well. I didnt get a whole lot off the nose. It had a hot and just over the top malt aroma but not a whole lot past that. I pick up some tar smell. The tate for me as a little unbalanced. Most of what I taste is thick heavy malt and alcohol. This probably means I should have let this beer age a little but it was already a year and a half out. The finish is very sweet at first and then is wrapped up by dry bitter malt in the end. Didnt really pick up a whole lot of dark chocolate flavor."
"a great desert beer. Brooklyn's best."
"Overall, I was very impressed by this beer that I wanted to try for some time now. It was more subtle than other chocolate flavored stouts and it definately felt refined. This was the highlight of the evening."
"Overall-A very good RIS with great flavor, not necessarily out of this world and not my favorite, but it's a well done version of the style and certainly worth a try."
"Pours a smooth black with 1 finger of creamy coffee tan head, good retention and lacing. Smells of dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malt, alcohol, and a touch of coffee. Tastes of vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruits like cherries and rum soaked raisins, smoke, and alcohol in the finish. Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy with lots of bitter sweetness, dark fruit notes, roastiness, and lots of alcohol presence. With there being more flavorful Russian Imperial Stouts that either mask the alcohol better or offer more in the flavor department, this is a RIS that I'll get if I see it and have no other desires offered, but I wouldn't race out to procure some."
"This is a really easy drinking RIS. Hardly any alcohol was apparent for me in this aged version. I have only had this aged bottle but I imagine it would be good at any age. A winner for sure."
"D: This is a very good chocolate stout which doesn't let the cocoa overpower the rest of the brew. Very nice."
"It's odd - in three days I've reviewed two Imperial Stouts. The first, a Belgian example, was, if anything, too fruity and not roasty enough. This, on the other hand, is the opposite. A little more fruitiness would go a long way towards balancing this beer and making it a great one, other than a merely good one."
"An enjoyable brew. Good nightcap or desert beer. Nice work Brooklyn."
"Notes: Serve at cellar temp and this is a good beer to cellar so put a few away. I have to say that I have taken the same approach with this beer as with ""Monster"". Do not want to sip on them. The alcohol is just too strong. Some bottles taste burnt. I will wait."
"Heavy, but pleasant. Not the best RIS I've had, but enjoyable."
"D - Good beer. First beer I have had from this brewery, but I wouldn't mind trying more in the future."
"D : Great chocolatey beer that I could drink lots of."
"drinkability: this stuff is really fun to drink but it's also rather filling. I think you could sit and analyze this shit all day long. That said it's filling and I don't see it playing well with others, except of course for specific deserts. So I'll knock just a bit off."
"I tried this beer on February 29, 2008 at the 'Beer Bistro' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured black with no head. The aroma was roasted malt, some coffee hints, dark cocoa, and some slight cherryish hints. The mouthfeel was smooth, full-bodied, and very little carbonation. The flavour was malty, chocolatey, with a little bit of hoppy bitterness."
"d: This is an absolutely world class brew that can be had for the bargain price of around $40 per case."
"D - All this combines to be one drinkable beer. This one makes for a great night cap on any evening. Will buy again."
"This beer would easily be considered an excellent exapmle for what artisianship means in the world of craft brewing."
"Poured from 12oz bottle labeled 06-07 into New Belgium snifter. Poured a black coffee color with a finger thick tan head. Smell is a mixture of herbal anisel, sweet dark fruit, coffee and a slight chocolate scent. Taste does contain a chocolate bitter profile but not overdone, also a coffee flavor with a medium roast profile. The full body and moderate to low carbonation really heightens the drinkabilty. Overall a pretty damn good stout."
"Pours an absolute onyx black with a generous two finger khaki colored head that leaves a thick lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer looks perfect, the creamy layer stays forever...what a great looking brew. First whiff, smell is pretty booze-like. Dark fruits follow of figs, raisins, dates, and grapes. Not as much chocolate in the nose as I was hoping, but there is some present. Taste begins with a big roasted barley flavor and a rich french roast coffee tingle. Smokey vanilla and wood with a hint of caramel malt as well. The chocolate finally makes an apperance in the dry aftertaste. Full, thick, and creamy mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation. Alcohol is clearly present in the nose, but it doesn't seem to appear at all in the taste."
"Drinkability: Smooth and warming, this is a sip and savor stout. Huge lingering finish. this is one to enjoy in a recliner with a good movie."
"Thanks to gford217 for this one. Poured from bottle into pint glass. Dark with almost no head. Smells like chocolate, malts, and a bit of alcohol. Taste has tons of chocolate, and a nice roasted bitterness, with a little alcohol peaking through. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Very easy to drink for a RIS. Overall this beer is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - while it's *very* good, to me drinkability on this one is quite limited. It was quite enjoyable, especially paired with a fruity dessert, but finishing off even a flute glass of it was tough sledding. It's just that big and bold; to me it very nearly crosses into DFH World Wide Stout terrirory."
"D- This is an absolutely amazing beer. Age has done this some good. This could quite possibly be the best value in the beer world."
"This is the winter 07-08 release. Pours the standard stout black color with no light penetrating at all. Big brown head forms very easily and is regenerated quite well upon swirling. I learned to not drink this cold. As it warmed up the big roastiness and chocolate malt character came out very nice. The chocolate was not sweet but roasty, bitter... all barley. I wouldn't even want to put this in the category of a ""chocolate beer"" especially compared to many of the newer sweet chocolate beers that are coming out now, but just a plain old Russian Imperial Stout this is one great beer, maybe one of the top 2 RIS's I've had."
"M&D: The mouthfeel is absolutely silky and heavy at the same time. Tiny and light carbonation aids in bringing out the creaminess of this brew. Very warming. Very smooth. Very good."
"Sure, this one has a few months on it already, but this is one heck of a beer, and it'll be drinking well for a while to come."
"I think I may become a stout fan!"
"Wow, great beer."
"My most recent serving of Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout was at a beer dinner hosted by none other than Garrett Oliver himself. The Black Chocolate Stout was paired with a slice of chocolate layer cake at the end of the 6 course meal. Excellent dinner, excellent beers!"
"The mouthfeel is silky smooth, creamy and slightly thick. It leaves a sticky film all over the inside of the mouth and a warm alcohol feeling following the swallow. The beer is so sticky and sweet it leaves your lips feeling like you just drank hot chocolate(with a shot of whiskey). I highly recommend this beer to all but its definitely too strong to pound. Two or three of these will leave you warm, happy and full."
"This imperial stout poured pitch black with a little bit of dark tan head. It smelled like burnt chocolate malt mixed with robust coffee. It tasted like milk chocolate and bitter coffee blended with earthy malt and a slight alcohol taste. It was very thick with no carbonation and a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a very powerful but balanced beer, so it was strong but very drinkable, just the way an imperial stout should be."
"This is NOT some weak ""chocolate-flavored"" stout. This is a hardcore, pitch black, alcohol-enraged tribute to the Czar!"
"Thanks again to RblWthACoz for the excellent trade!!"
"D: A very drinkable stout. I will buy more."
"D - The alcohol feel will slow drinking this down. Don't know I could have more than 1 or 2 of these on a wild nite (note the ABV and you'd need a 'wild nite' to have more than 1)."
"D: Smooth and sweet. Heavyness and sweetness hold back the repeatability of the beer."
"D: This is very sweet. Goes down very easy. Some may find this beer hard to drink more then a few because of how sweet it is."
"Black, oily pour with a nice brown head that lasts for a bit. Smell is nicely rich, dark roastiness, and some dark chocolate as well. Alcohol is well hidden in the nose, I thought. Taste is dark roast, and a noticeable amount of acidity and light tartness giving it a uniqueness from other Imperial Stouts. A bit of a prickly carbonated mouthfeel at first, which subsides later. Slightly thick mouthfeel, with a dry dark chocolate finish. Just a hint warming. Ever so slightly tart, dark chocolate flavor as it warms. Overall a really good imperial stout that I would like to try again, especially aged to see how it differs. Thanks a lot for the bottle, Dave!"
"D- So smooth and delicious that the strong ABV does not hurt the drinkability at all, requiring caution lest intoxication sneak up on you after only a couple. The powerful delicious flavors are still something that demands this beer be a slow sipper lest they go to waste, but each sip leaves the mouth craving another."
"Drinkability is fairly low in terms of strength of alcohol and amount of flavor. However I've rated drinkability as good due to the fact that it's smooth drinking, and the alcohol I've noted does not interupt the drinking experience. Quite nice."
"D- This beer is a great treat with a dessert. Do not drink more of two of these in a sitting unless you plan on going to sleep. Highly tasty."
"D: Very drinkable because of the mix of sweetness, fruitiness, hops bitterness, and smoothness, but I would love to try this in the bottle owing to the service of this one being way too cold."
"The flavor is intense, of course, but the strong alcohol isn't evident, except the warming power is there as the sip is swallowed. Body is slightly thin for so much flavor. The roasty, coffee and malty flavor, with strong hop bitterness to balance, isn't so much chocolate except in the lingering soft texture on the tongue. One of the best chocolate/coffee stouts I've had, but actually not the very best."
"Footnote- The second was nicer, a klittle more gentle, and enjoyed a little more."
"I am going to pick up another and lay it down for a year or so as this one is really fresh and I think this could use a little aging."
" i really have liked this beer every time i drink it from the bottle. this was my first time drinking this on tap. it wasn't bad, i just think it could of been better."
"This beer pours oily black. Not syrupy. The head is probably the darkest mocha color I've encountered so far. It's is tight on the bottom but fluffier at the top. Fades away after a minute, lacing floats on for another minute or two more. Taste is shockingly chocolate. I have some 85% cacao dark chocolate, and this tastes almost identical. The chocolate flavors are so overwhelming that I can barely discern any malt underneath, and I'm too blown away to note any hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, but like the pour, thinner than I thought. Where's the alcohol? Drinkable? Sure, it goes down well, but for me you must partake of chocolate in moderation."
"M/D: an altogether very good beer, the chocolate label at least for me was a bit overstated but regardless i really enjoyed the beer, and maybe i just could not detect the chocolate malts or whatever it was"
"Pours a very dark opaque brown, not a lot of head but what there is hangs in there. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste is a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, malt, with hops in the background. No single flavor sticks out at you, and in fact the flavor could have been a bit more intense, but the coffee was a bit more pronounced than the chocolate. Could have use a wee bit more carbonation, maybe. Overall, nice and smooth, very drinkable."
"I think I had a bottle from the same 6 pack maybe 4 months ago. At the time, the alcohol content was felt big time in aroma and taste. This one has really changed in a short time."
"Very good, a well above the crowd porter."
"~55-60 degrees range of drinking temp"
"This is a very good beer that's on the cusp of top tier for the style but just falls a touch short here and there in my opinion. I'd like to try it after it's mellowed a bit with some aging. Still, it's a nice on to try as is."
"Drinkability: Wonderful RIS. Brooklyn's always been a solid brewery as far as I'm concerned, and this is one of their more excellent selections. Too much will land you in oblivion, but it's a great ride."
"This is one of the best looking stouts I've ever seen. Absolutely opaque black with a viscous body. The head is really thick, especially considering the style, and has a cocoa powder hue. Leaves some thick lacing which is, at parts, scattered and decorative, and at others, totally solid. Aroma is pretty heavy on the dried fruits and chocolate, which I love together. Some coffee helps to support this along with some apropos alcohol. Little bit of soft earthy hops in the background. As with the aroma, the flavor is big on chocolate, of course, and raisins, reminding me of chocolate-covered raisins, naturally. There is also some smooth tobacco interwoven here, which reminds me of some more European-leaning stouts. The roastiness is not that pronounced, but works as an accent. Hops are a little harder to find in the flavor, but they lend some hints of earth and herbs somewhere close to the finish. Finishes sweet. I find that this has a wonderful balance of sweetness, alcohol warmth, and mild lactic acidity from the black malt. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and smooth as velvet (or velour). Drinkability is overall pretty solid, but the sweetness can put the brakes on having more than one of these."
"D: I think I will have these one at a time. Way to much alcohol to have ""a few."" Enjoy this brew after a meal, and be careful this beer will sneek up on you. An alcoholic dessert..."
"I still have some 03's and 04's, I'm really looking forward to."
"D: This is a beer candy bar...full of sweet and bitter chocolates and a nice warm sticky body that is filling and a pleasure to drink."
"12oz single bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston for around $2.70 or so. Pours a thick rich black with a small but rich brown head that doesn't stick around for long. Strong aroma of malt and molasses - you can almost smell the alcohol. Flavour is thick and rich - almost a bit syrupy. Not much in the way of chocolate."
"I tried an 06-07 and a 07-08 side by side. Both were thick. Almost like a syrup and dark as night. I think the 06-07 was a bit thicker. It smelled like like roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste was very good. Dark chocolate and coffee with some molasses. It seemed to coat my mouth like a syrup would and gave me a nice warm feeling. I think, due to the 10% ABV, two in a sitting were enough for me."
"12 oz brown bottle purchased at Whole Foods in Greenville, SC. Pours like used 10W40 motor oil into my Sam Adams pint glass. Nice thick and creamy mocha colored head. Aroma is of molasses, coffee and alcohol. Taste is a wonderful blend of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses and vanilla with a warming alcohol finish. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. At $8.99 a six, this one is a steal!"
"D: Very rich, dark and comparable to the best of imperial russian stouts (rasputin). A rich treat in every sip."
"Can't really have more than one of these at a time, or it would knock me over, but it's still quite tasty."
"i love It."
"After it's all said and done, I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try a stout but is too afraid too. It is not overpowering at 10.6 % ABV, but a very mellow and warming liquid, worthy of a nightcap. Definitely a keeper!"
"D: This beer is awesome x 1,000. It's actually too easy to drink, a dangerous sign given the 10+% ABV. Go easy (but get some)!"
"Notes: This beer is absolutely sensational in the right context. I love it a lot. Mine's from winter 07/08. Yum."
"Bottle from the Foodery into the pint glass... Pours deep and opaque black with a medium dark tan head that'll shrink into a dark tan skin over the beer that leaves good lacing. Smells like a RIS, that's for sure- coffee, caramel, robust roasted malts. Tastes like dark chocolate, toffee and then the roasted malts hit. Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety, even with the alcohol presence. I really wish I had bought more than one of these."
"Taste is roasted with notes of chocolate and coffee, followed by a light molasses taste. The alcohol is quite strong and balances the sweetness. Bitterness is a combination of maltbitterness and hops. No real hop aroma in the beer though. I am not sure I really really like this beer. It isn't really complex. Not that it is bad, but it doesn't stick out."
"Ages very well, drinkability goes up."
"I got myself a sixpack of Winter 07-08 bottles and I have to say I was impressed. I like stout and I guess I drink it pretty regularly (usually opting for Young's Chocolate, Smith's Oatmeal or old reliable Guinness). The look, smell and taste of the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout were top notch. I drank it from a small brandy snifter (which I highly recommend)and I was was totally impressed. This is not a brew to be swilled while watching the game, (it is filling and strong) but to be enjoyed in small quantities, much like a fine brandy/cognac. I recommend it with dessert or by itself with a nice cigar."
"D: Its high ABV does not lend itself normally to high drinkability but it just tastes so darn good! Ok, maybe one more..."
"Drinkability is good, but the alcohol definitely isn't hidden. An above-average imperial stout, an exceptional warming seasonal, and one of the better beers from Brooklyn."
"This certainly isn't a thin beer, but it wasn't so thick to be described as chewy or coating. The flavor perfectly filled my mouth and lingered on for some time, as did the lacing on the glass - from top to bottom, remnants of the caramel head lined the sides."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Poured a jet black liquid. This beer lets no light through. Jet black, with no head, and no lacing. Aroma is molasses and coffee with a bit of toffee. Taste is dark chocolate up front with coffee, dark fruits, molasses, vanilla and finishes with bakers chocolate. What I was amazed with is it hides the 11% alcohol better than any RIS I've drank to this point. Mouthfeel is great, full with an oily coating the lets your mouth soak in the beerdom. I will probably try to get a bottle of this in every trade I do with someone from NY. Great beer."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Full-bodied and bittersweet. The flavor shifts between rich, creamy dark chocolate and espresso. Wonderful complexity. The finish is a combination of toffee-like sweetness and bitter burnt bread, with the toffee flavors ultimately lasting a bit longer."
"Overall, this was a very good stout and was very glad I got to try it. It was even more enjoyable after coming in from the snow."
"I tried the 20707-08 batch and I am quite impressed. It reminds me of Bison Chocolate Stout which is the best chocolate stout I've had to date and this beer falls into my #2 spot. Dark black in color with a very distinct, real chocolate taste upfront. A little bit bubbly on the tongue with a smooth aftertaste."
"This one's worth every penny. Looking forward to cellaring a few bottles."
"Taste is up there with some of my favorite beers. There is a complex layer of flavors that starts with roasted and chocolate malts. Followed by a nice hop bite with a dark fruit chaser and then... sweet Jesus, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. The after taste is all chocolate and it lingers forever on your tongue and the sides of your mouth. There is also a nice warming of the pallet from the higher ABV, and it stays with your sip all the way down to your stomach. I think I am in love. I doubt I can wait and cellar this beer even though I know it will be even better after some age."
"Tasted with 5 other Imperial Stouts. Pours black with creamy light brown head. The aroma is sweet caramel and some chocolate. The taste has definate notes of Alcohol along with the sweetness. Not much bitterness. Definately the sweetest stout of the night."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Almost black with a brown head. The head dissipates to leave a thin film around the glass edge. The aroma is of dark bitter choclate and a slight hint of alcohol. The taste is a bitter and astringent. Too much bitter chooclate and hops? The roasted coffee/toasted malts never come through. The alcohol is high so after one you can feel the warmth. I still try it ever year, but not my favorite big stout."
"This perennial holiday favorite from Brooklyn doesn't disappoint. With deep chocolate notes, a rich, roasty body, and alcohol warmth, it's perfect for Wintertime sipping."
"D - One of my favorite RIS. I love Brooklyn's styles and this one is top notch. I would have given this a 4.5 or 5 but the ABV @ 10.6% it's reserved for a one and done session! Highly recommended."
"The thoughts above were recorded while tasting only the beer. After recording my thoughts I finished the beer while enjoying a gooey, rich chocolate dessert. The beer complimented it perfectly. The beer made the dessert better and the dessert made the beer taste better. The chocolate in the dessert accentuated the roasted malt in beer and subdued some of the more vinous and alcohol notes, which, in my opinion, further improved the flavor."
"Overall- A good representation of the style. It's a beer I come back to every year in the colder months."
"I have been meaning to get some more of these to keep around and age for a while- but every time I go get more I seem to end up drinking them. I cant see why some people haven't rated this one higher-- maybe this years brew is better than others..."
"D - This is a really enjoyable beer but I couldn't drink more than a couple at a time."
"Poured jet black and very viscous. Very little head retention and minimal lacy but still looks good. Smell of bitter chocolate and a faint smokey/coffee flavor. Taste is really fantastic. Taste is roast, dark chocolate right up front. It coats your mouth like a mik stout but doesn't have that overriding sweetness. As it warms, some type of fruitness is in there as well. Reminded me of dates that aren't overly sweet. Really nice touch. Lots of flavor but still very clean. A litte bit of fizzy carbonation that threw off some of the smoothness flavor. The alcohol starts to bite a little more at the end but in a pleasurable way. This is a treat!"
"A rare treat and another world-class brew from Brooklyn."
"This is a solid, if not outstanding, imperial stout. The fruity flavors really set this one apart. I'd be interested to see what a few years in the cellar would do to this."
"At first I thought the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout came in a special black bottle... but I was wrong. To say this stout is dark is a complete understatement. This brew black hole black! When held up to the light absolutely no light passes through... This is then topped off with a rich dark tan head, which unfortunately dissipates quickly. Aroma is nice... nothing overpowering maybe some fruity notes. Taste is great. Dark chocolate is the obvious flavor; the high alcohol content is also prevalent. As the beer hits the front of the tongue maybe even a hit of sweet fruit notes. Mouth feel is ok, carbonation is high... The Black Chocolate Stout is the perfect desert, as the finish of this is probably the best I have experienced. The taste of chocolate will linger on the back of the tongue well after the beer is gone."
"Pours jet black with little tan head. smell is of chocolate and alcohol. Taste is of some chocolate, alcohol, a little bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but could be thicker. Drinkability is a bit off, because of the high alcohol taste, I think this will be much better with some cellar time."
"Poured into a snifter, pours an impressive pitch black with a carmel colored head that leaves nice thick fat lace. Smell is very sweet I can smell a bit of smoke in there as well, like sweet smoked candy, the smell is very inviting and asks to be drank. The taste was a bit dissapointng, I drank this at a little colder than room temp. all I could really taste was a bit of a sweetness in there, like a tarty sweetness, I did not taste anything else, this could of been that it was very new and not yet settled, other than that I was a bit dissapointed."
"D- A sipper for sure, but excellently decadent and rounded, good for desert."
"D: One to allow to warm, and really open up. Something similar to a fine chocolates or candies that you would want to enjoy in gentle moderation... a nice dessert treat."
"Always will be one of my favorite Imperial Stouts. Although it is high in alcohol, its very well balanced which makes for a complex taste that hides the power well. And it doesnt disappoint by calling itself Black Chocolate Stout."
"The perfect nightcap after a long cold winter day. Cheers!"
" I did score a six pack from Whole Foods NYC on 24th St, on sale for $7.99 from it's typical $11.00... so with that in mind it's the best bang for your buck in NYC, if you can cash in on this deal."
"D - One to two is all I can ever drink at one time."
"Pours out dark, dark, dark... well dark. Even the head is darker than your average beer. Aromas are rich dark fruit, alcohol, and chocolate/espresso. Taste is sweet and rich, with tons of fruitiness and roastiness. I'm getting coffee and chocolate, raisins, prunes, grapes, molasses, dates, apples and cherries. There's enough flavour that I almost didn't notice the astringency which is objectively fairly pronounced. Mouthfeel is creamy, with carbonation giving just a light prickliness. Drinkability is good, in moderation. Not sessionable, nor expected to be, but delicious and well worth trying."
"Drinkability- This brew doesnt exactly fit my definition of a RIS (in my tiny brain anyway) but whatever it is, I think its pretty tasty. The alcohol definitely needs toned down or hidden a little better but Im sure thatll come. The soft chocolate and mild sweetness are pretty damn tasty. Big thanks again to YonderWanderer and drseamus!"
"Solid beer from Brooklyn. If you like chocolate, this one is for you."
"Pours heavy, thick, and deep black with garnet notes and a very dark brown head of dense moose. Completely opaque, this is the black hole of beers. Aroma is strong dark, even burnt malt, with notes of the alcohol and some dark fruits (dates, figs, currants). Hintsof anise come through in the aroma as well. Flavor is more dark (burnt) malt, bitter chocolate, and some very slight sherry notes. Finish is pleasantly dry and dark, with subtle reminders of the alcohol. Body is thick and oily, but very smooth."
"Drinkability- Nearly a drain pour. For some reason when they ramped up the alcohol they decided not to taste test the batch and this beer has suffered. This year's batch (06-07) is much better still having the big alcohol but retaining it's previous chocolate character."
"Pours a syrupy black color with a lace of head. Smell is very malty with lots of chocolate aroma. The taste is full of alcohol and quite bitter. I'm kinda disappointed with the taste though, because the label says chocolate and the smell of full of chocolate, so naturally you'd think the taste would lots of chocolate, not here though. You can only taste a little chocolate here. Mouthfeel burns a little, as it should with such high alcohol. Don't get me wrong this is one fine Russian Imperial Stout, but if you're hoping for chocolate flavor you might be disappointed."
"The Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout emerges from the bottle thick, motor oil black, and with a thin brown head that quickly recedes to a ring of fine bubbles. The smell is rich, roasty and enticing while the flavor is complex and rewarding. This is a very big beer and the 10% plus abv, although ever present, is well balanced by the chocolate & burnt malt flavors and the dry finish. This beer seemed medium bodied with a prickly fine carbonation that made the beer seem lighter. A nice after dinner sipping beer."
"The taste has lots of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. Another great winter brew and another great beer from Brooklyn."
"Served at cellar temp. Deep, dark, almost black body with a large, thick, dense, creamy, milk chocolate brown head. Great lacing. Roasted barley, licorice, herbal-medicinal alcohol, dark sweet sugary fruits, and coffee on the nose. Roasted coffee bitterness at first, and then rich, rummy-sweet fruits flanked by herbal, warming alcohol notes. Dark, bitter chocolate settles in and the coffee and chocolate bitterness increase in the warming, numbing finish. Full-bodied with a velvety smooth feel. Will have to age a few to see if the bitterness settles down some."
"Pours a complete 3000 mile motor oil black. Smell is that of roasted malts, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is mainly of bitter chocolate mixed with a combination of roasted malts. A very strong alcohol taste is present. I wish they would have masked the alcohol a little better. Maybe next year. Mouthfeel is very full and thick. Very pleasing for a stout. Drinkability isn't the best because of the very apparent alcohol presence. A pretty good stout, and I'd try it again."
"D: Ok drinkability. A little too thick to drink a lot of these in quick succession. A very good session beer."
"edited: I have grown into some of these bigger beers, and this beer is a lot better than I gave it credit for."
"**NOTE** This beer ages really well. I recommend buying two 4packs....one for now, & one for the basement."
"From a 12oz bottle, copped singly from Wine and more in West Orange has a limited bottling-winter 07-08 mark on the neck...Pours a opaque pitch black hue with a minimal tan head...Smell is reminescent of bittersweet dark burnt chocolate...Flavor is very alcoholic with a cocoa-spresso very bitter lingering finish and a very strong warm alcoholic glow...Mouthfeel and drinkability are marred by a ridiculously strong alcohol percentage of 10.6%...Slight vodka taste detracts from the presence of any character or flavor...In my opinion too strong to be truly enjoyed as a stout."
"D - It is big and strong. Proceeding with caution is a good idea. Having said that, I consider this beer to be really good...in moderation."
"D: This is a great beer. It has a really nice bouquet of complex scents and flavours and has a higher ABV than most popular stouts. Even still, it is very drinkable, and despite it's thick and creamy body, I could definitely put 2 or 3 of these down in one sitting."
"Pours an opaque black with a dark tan/brown head. Nose is strong with roasted bean qualities and a bit of alcohol on there as well. Hoooieeee! Man. The first time this thing hit my tongue, I did a little dance on over to my sister to try who has recently got into stouts (cuz she read some magazine article that stout is good for women cuz it has a lot of iron in it...well...whatever it takes). Flavor is smooth and even, though she says it is kind of bitter on the end. I personally dont think it is bitter, I just think it is robust. Feel? Like silk. The first sip was amazing. Definitely drinkable, especially for a Russian Imperial Stout. I am always weary of trying to uber-hyped beers, but this one delivers. I guess it is good I will be living in Brooklyn shortly. Killer. Try it."
"D: Really sort of disapointed in this one, I mean it is nice and complex and I do enjoy that warming alcohol sensation but this beer left me wanting a bit more and compared to other beers of this style there are a number I would reach for before grabbing this one."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol hides while the taste enhances with each sip. A complex deep beer without an overbearing feel or taste to the mouth or stomach."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid chocolate stout that is recommended."
"D - Great beer. This is my favorite chocolate stout."
"Pours an excellent black color from the bottle with a thick caramel brown head that sticks to the sides of the glass. Really strong aroma of heavy roasted malts, light hops, and even a little alcoholic aroma to it. The taste is excellent! Strong earthy malts combine for a complex malty chocolatey flavor with an aftertaste that is kind of chocolatey and a little bit alcoholic. The mouthfeel is good, especially of something of high alcoholic content. Amazingly it is very drinkable and I had a few of these before I called it a night. Great beer for this time of year when it gets cold here in New England."
"d - what a great sipper this is. as good a beer for dessert on a cold night that i can think of."
"Great winter brew and a delicious variation on the style. Brooklyn, you have impressed me yet again."
"Drinkability - Second straight winner from Brooklyn and maybe the best RIS I've had yet. The biggest difference, they didn't overdue it with the hops and they let the roasted malt do the talking. I've finally found a competitor worthy of Storm King, I'll have to do some comparisons with West Coast brews now to see if this really is the champ. This brew lives up to the hype, grab it if you get a chance!"
"Overall, a good beer to enjoy maybe with dessert but not one that I would go back to repeatedly; I feel as if it is overly sweet and can't get past the sugar taste...to me, it's not chocolate that dominates but just pure cane sugar."
"Overall I think this is above average for the style and such a well made beer. I can't wait a year to taste the ones I've saved from this year."
"Feels thick and oily. Leaves a sharp, alcoholic film. It's a hard swallow. It's not a smooth, creamy stout. It's harsh, strong and full of alcohol."
"I was really not that impressed by this one. Not as complex as it could be for the style or ABV. Not bad, but slightly over-rated in my opinion."
"Not bad, just not as good as I was expecting."
"Pours a deep dark black, little to no head, no lacing, just black as night. Smells of chocolate and coffee, maybe some nuts. tastes are muddled, but definitely too much of the burnt coffee present with the taste and dominant in aftertaste. Some chocolaty alcohol in there, but the burnt coffee is too much for me. I gave away 3 of my 6 pack."
"D: I kinda think this beer will be sooo much better in 6 mo to a year. I just hope I can keep them in the closet for that long."
"The first sip was pretty darn good with good mouthfeel. The after taste is a bit harsh with the sting of too much alcohol. The heavy alcohol taste pretty much ruined this brew for me. If they backed off a bit, this would be excellent."
"Appearance is dark black with an almost perfect dark tan head. Aroma is strong chocolate and dark malts. Taste is of dark chocolate and heavy barley.A little bit of sugar and full body makes it go down extremely smooth. Drinkability gets a small hit because there is an alcohol sting that comes out a bit too much."
"Definitely one of the superior Imperial stouts I've had."
"Pretty solid Imperial stout. I'd say it's middle of the pack, BUT considering my opinion of the style - that's still wonderful."
"Pours midnight black with ruby red light making it through only at the edges. Thick cappuccino-colored head that fades to leave persistent lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate. The alcohol comes through in the aroma. Theres also a slight dark fruit, sherry like aroma on the nose. Fine dark chocolate comes through in the flavor, along with some expresso. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full of body. I look forward to this beer each Winter."
"It is snowing vigerously as I am writing this, so the stout gives a welcome foil to the bitter cold outside. I didn't know what to expect when I got it, but this is really what I like to find in a stout."
"Overall this is an excellent beer, another winner from Brooklyn, who have yet to make a beer that isn't good. This is a great beer from one of the best breweries in the nation. Buy some while you can since it's seasonal."
"When my glass was set in front of me, I immediately noticed a fruit smell and then a flavored coffee aroma. Not a definitive flavor but a cloudy coffee smell. The head was reasonable and had a nice creamy tone. My first sip tasted fantastic but yes it did indeed feel thin. The alcohol is not pronounced, which did make it easier to down the entire pint. As it warmed it should have gotten tastier but the thinness was more obvious than it was cold. Overall okay, but Ill try the bottled version when I get a chance."
"Poured like straight black oil with not much of a head, some tan surface lace. Sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, a touch of dark fruits, and slight alcohol esters. Dry, roasted espresso, burnt malts, slightly tart fruits, prune, and quite a big bittering and fruity hop addition that maintains a good balance. Alcohol moves in midway through and is a bit hot, gets in the way of the fainter notes and pulls out a chalky astringent. The finish is bitter cocoa powder and chalky, with some anise notes. As it warms the alcohol does back off a bit and reveals some vinous characters. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly thin for the style and for what it appeared to pour, not bad at all though. Carbonation suffers from aggressive alcohol."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium on the palate though it seems to me that it is leaning towards the lighter side of medium...the higher levels of carbonation in this beer reinforce my opinion. Finish is dry and leaves a chocolate flavor in the mouth with an alcohol associated flavor in the air. This is a brew I'll drink but won't be excited to buy again. I much prefer the Bell's Expedition over this one. Don't get me wrong its a great beer, but the flavor is not up my alley."
"Pours a rich black color with smaller tan/brown head. Smells of sweet apple and darker fruits raisins, plums, and a slight vanilla. tastes complex of raisins, dark chocolate, and charcoal. Finishes with an overpowering charcoal taste. Carbonation is a bit overpowering for this style, mild carbonation works better in a a stout, in my opinion. This one is a bit too dark for my taste, and should be noted. Although with a 10.6 alc my down sides are worth overlooking. and i would have another one if offered."
"Drinkability: As with many Imperial Stouts, this beer suffers in this category just because it is very heavy. Within the style, however, this beer has a lot of good flavor without being too heavy. Definitely worth seeking this one out during the winter release each year."
"This is a good beer, but I feel the latest incarnation is still a bit green. I have no doubt this well become a finer beer over time. If you have plenty to spare, try one now and save the rest. If you only have a couple, set them away for at least a year."
"This was a great beer and I will jump at the chance to try another."
"D: Much more drinkable now that the alcohol flavor has subsided. This is already become a much better beer, and I hope will continue to evolve over time. I cant wait to try another in a couple months."
"D- This is one that is great in moderation. Intense in flavor and alcohol. Delicious one I look forward to when is begins to get cold."
"Smells very rich, aromatic strong coffee with flashes of hazelnut, slightly Frangelico. The taste is bitter dark chocolate predominant, aromatic coffee, rich and powerful, with a strong roasted malt finish. Very full bodied, dense mouthfeel yet a creamy and buttery texture. I got distracted prior to opening the bottle and it warmed a bit, so the high alcohol content was quite pronounced. However, it did not detract from delightful taste experience. This beer was still a major treat, great with dessert, or to have as dessert, something to savour."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium to thick bodied. Carbonation is very good. It's strong at 10.6%, but very drinkable nonetheless. Clearly not a session beer, but very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Highly recommended."
"In case all this isn't enough, according to the receipt, this cost less than the average craft six pack, at $7.99 (+tax and deposit). If that's right, Brooklyn is leaving money on the table, this is totally worth more. Simply stated: if you see this beer, buy it!"
"D: This a beer that I would never turn down. The alcohol is evident but balanced well by all of the other flavors. This is a great sipper for after dinner."
"Very nice smooth subtle RIS."
"Highly recommended. Definitely one of the better imperial stouts out there! I'd put a few ahead of this, but this definitely gives the best of the best a run for their money."
"The taste was complex, bitter like espresso coffee and unsweetened chocolate, roasted barley and malts, and a hint of chocolate covered cherries. There is a definite alcohol hit on the back of the throat. The flavor is bold and there is medium body..., and it mellows a bit as it comes up to room temperature, a very nice cold weather winter beer. I think I'll stash a couple away for next season."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with an oily slickness left on the lips and tongue. Very quaffable, rich in flavor and a joy sip and savor. Great beer."
" This is a very good Imp stout, a great winter treat"
"Yet another fairly new addition to the Michigan beer scene, my only other Brooklyn Brewing experience was at the Chip Shop in Brooklyn. Oddly, I had this beer in Brooklyn as well. Pouring a thick, viscous black with a nice cocoa head that goes away fast and leaves some lacing. The alcohol is very present in the nose along with some vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. This tastes like any Imperial stout should chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, and some vanilla - perfect flavor that will only improve with age. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Aside from the nearly 11% ABV, this is very nice stout. Mellow with just a slight alcohol burn. Highest recommendation."
"Drinkability: Held out very well for the 1 year that it was cellared. Alcohol is a bit high for anything but an occasional sipper. Excellent Brooklyn offering - an American classic."
"Drinkability: This is a sheer winner in terms of value, strength, appropriateness and even drinkability. I can't believe this is the first time I've ever had this one. I should make it a point to purchase a case every winter. Very nice."
"Drinkability is weird to describe. In a way, i want to avoid drinking this to let it age. However, the older it gets, the better it tastes. Really a good RIS but it needs age to get there."
"D - Certainly what I call a ""desert"" beer or a night cap beer..this is to be sipped and enjoyed and should in my opinion be the finish of the night...but it's a damn good finish"
"D - Great Stout, outstanding flavor and feel, A very good example of the style, but not one to drink multiples of. This one bottle held me for the night, I savored it and its nightcap properties."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable despite the pronounced alcohol. It's a shame that the alcohol isn't masked better, as it gets in the way of an otherwise very good brew."
"Pours jet black, with a dark tan to brown head. In the aroma, chocolate, roasty malts, and a hint of alcohol. In the taste, roasty malt and chocolate. A bigger body and bitter mouthfeel, with a semi dry chocolate, roasty malt aftertaste. Nice chocolate flavor, and a big body. Hides the alcohol quite well."
"Overall: Somewhat intriguing taste but intensity hurts drinkability."
"Aroma is chocolate mixed in with some alcohol. Absolutely opaque with a light brown head. Mouthfeel is nice, not too aggressive. Alcohol shows up at the back of the throat but it's all malt and chocolate before that. Very nice drink. Definitely allow it to warm up before drinking----my last sip was much better than the first. Brooklyn does it again---good job!"
"Picked up a six pack for after Thanksgiving dinner. Poured into a pint glass, and the color seemed to be midnight black. One of the darkest beers that comes to mind. Very minimal head and carbonation. The smell was of roasted coffee. When this beer is served a bit on the cold side, the taste of bittersweet chocolate is prevalent. But as this beer warms up, the chocolate flavor mellows out a bit, to somewhere between cocoa and milk chocolate. At over 10% abv, I do not understand how easy this brew goes down. But that small part of my brain tells me not to have more than a couple. This beer is a perfect after dinner drink, or with dessert, or as dessert itself. This stout is by far my favorite offering from Brooklyn. I will look forward to it every year."
"Full body and nice mouthfeel that silks over the palate. A complex, but very well balanced beer that can be enjoyed anytime. With a 10.6% ABV, this one will age quite well for many years to come."
"A very good imperial stout. I will definitely be buying more. I beleive it is only a winter release, which is fine because I think this will cellar very well."
"Poured in to a pint glass; pitch black in color with a small head that disappeared after a minute or two. Aroma has coffe, toffee, caramel, and hints of alcohol. When cold, tastes mostly of smoky coffee and some mellow chocolate. As it warms, the chocolate flavor comes more to the front, yum. Mouth feel is good, with active carbonation. Wow, at 10% my first one is starting a buzz. Delicious to drink alone, or even better with rich chocolate cake. Rich, but drinkable, although not many at one time for me. One of the best 2 or 3 Imperial Stouts I've had thus far."
"Poured from 12oz bottle, like motor oil, thick, black, viscous. Dark tan head, good retention. Wonderful aroma of chocolate and coffee, with a whiff of alcohol. This is a rich, full, strong stout. Dark chocolate, molasses, heavy, viscous and a delight to drink on its own. One of the best imperial stouts I've ever had."
"D - Another year of a very interesting, well sipping Black Chocolate stout from Brooklyn. Nice to sit and sip on a cold night or to have with dessert."
"Upon smell there are hints of chocolate and coffee, and upon that first taste the malt kicks in. You can definitely realize the high ABV, which makes it slightly less sweet and smooth compared to Rogue's Chocolate Stout (which I think the ABV is in the 6 or 7 range), but is not as thick or leaves that somewhat malty, bitter aftertaste like an Old Rasputin does (which is still a very good beer). I think the reviewer before me, or the person in front of him mentioned how the high ABV limits the drinkability and I concur. I have had one after leftovers and I might have a second one, if that. This is a very good beer, more on the stout side than chocolate, so if you're looking for something very sweet you might want to pass. But if you are a beer lover, you'll have to pick this up and just have a nice glass (preferably after a meal so the 10.6% doesn't hit you) to warm you up during winter."
"D. As with most high gravity beers the abv limits the drinkability. A couple more of these and I would be howling at the moon. Still this beer is readilly available in our market and I will hoard some so I can enjoy it in the next months."
"D: Average. This isn't an everyday or even every week beer. But when looking for a powerful ""winter's eve"" stout, this should do the trick nicely."
"Nice beer. I will drink more."
"Remarkably smooth for a imperial stout, but could use some aging before consumption. (This is a 2007 bottle). I've got a couple of these stashed from last year that I'll have to check out soon."
"Drinkability - Too easy. Alcohol was not really to noticeable. I felt it almost had a Trappist ale quality to it, as was mentioned in a previous review. Highly recommend. Cheers!"
"Pours an absolute onyx black with a generous two finger khaki colored head that leaves a thick lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer looks perfect, the creamy layer stays forever...what a great looking brew. First whiff, smell is pretty booze-like. Dark fruits follow of figs, raisins, dates, and grapes. Not as much chocolate in the nose as I was hoping, but there is some present. Taste begins with a big roasted barley flavor and a rich french roast coffee tingle. Smokey vanilla and wood with a hint of caramel malt as well. The chocolate finally makes an apperance in the dry aftertaste. Full, thick, and creamy mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation. Alcohol is clearly present in the nose, but it doesn't seem to appear at all in the taste. What a great RIS that's easily available in the Syracuse area."
"My initial thoughts were that calling this a ""beer"" is a bit of a stretch. So much of the experience that this brew provides makes me think ""chocolate barley wine?"" Overall, great taste, but this one definitely does not kick back easily."
"Without even a mention for The Brewmasters Table; this beer is another reason why Garrett should run for president."
"Mouthfeel is perfect--not too thick but medium high with enough carbonation to liven it up. Too strong for me to consider very drinkable. Very good candidate for aging, should mellow out a bit. Very good value. Buy a couple and lay them down for a couple years."
"D - This brew has a great taste and is very smooth easy to drink just gets a little filling after a few"
"Wow. I Wasn't expecting a truly authentic chocolate flavor. This was a well-balanced, hearty, stout. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would reccomend it to others. This would make a good winter warmer indeed. Drinkability is good, although it probably should be kept to reason instead of ""pounding""."
"Drinkability, well, yeah, it's almost 11% ABV, so it can't be that high. It's a sipping beer that almost defines sipping beers. There's so much going on that the enjoyment of one of them is as much enjoyment as two or three of any other beer(with the added bonus that the alcohol is almost equivalent to the aforementioned beer that you drink two/three of). There's a lot going on, and it only gets more complex as it gets warmer. But with it's high ABV, and the time it takes to drink one, it's hard to imagine drinking more than one in a night; this compares with any of the great, complex after dinner beers and is something that the thought of aging brings delusions of grandeur. Probably the most complex fresh beer I've ever had and an absolute winter staple from now on."
"This is a highly drinkable brew that I believe will improve with age. Have a few this year and put the rest away til 2012."
"Very nice appearance deep black with great lacing on the glass. Pretty typical on the nose nothing great but it hits all the major points chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malts with spicy hops underneath. The taste is nice fairly sweet but well balanced by bitter hops not a typical american RIS it is much more subtle in the hoppiness, which I like. The mouthfeel is nice also, mine was served too cold but as it warmed the fullness and smoothness of this beer began to come through. Drinkability is good also the 10+ abv is well hidden here in a balanced beer, I've had better but this isn't bad"
"EDIT/UPDATE: Much better. Don't know if I had a bad batch, my taste buds are craft beer better, or something else, but I've really enjoyed this beer much more. Nice chocolate and stout tones without being too alcohol hot."
"Such balance makes for a great session beer. I don't care that this beer is 10.6% alcohol. I can't tell. I wish I had another one."
"Enjoyed on Nitro-tap at Pazzo's Pizza Pub. Although I have drank my share of this beer in the past, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to have it in it's nitro-fused version. The beer is delivered to the bar with a heavily viscous black with a tan, mousse-like froth resting at the top of the glass. Tough to fight through the foam and obtain that first sip. Meanwhile, filling aromas of highly roasted malt, espresso, malty / nutty scents, and an unusual lactose fill the round out the olfactories. Flavors of espresso, cocoa powder, and an underlying sweet maltiness set the base for the brew, the show some light caramel, vanilla, pecan, and light esters of dates, figs, and grapes. The nitrous seems to mellow the flavors considerably, while giving a sharp tart taste -- akin to lactic acid. The mouthfeel, while initially very creamy, later resides to normal levels and is as easy to drink as any other versions of the beer. Always a fantastic beer, but the Nitro-tap did not hold the luster that I had anticipated."
"i've done areview on this before but i felt the need to sit down and do it properly, pours a beautiful oily black. nice brown head that fades quick but it still gives a good presentation, the smell is of choclate, malts and well more chocolate and some alcohol. anxiously i lift the glass and pour into my mouth, very smooth, very think and velvety. i taste roasted chocolate, i taste sugar, i taste lots of alcohol, and some hairspray??? joking but... theres something potent there. best winter beer out there best stout i've had so far. i recomend for everyone atleast once.."
"This is a great seasonal brew. I could enjoy it in the summer, but I think this would be best enjoyed near a fireplace after a few hours of skiing or snowmobiling."
"Each taste seemed to leave me with a different impression, from inticingly unique to wincingly harsh. For this reason I rated the drinkability lowest. I still don't quite know what to think, but I don't think I will rush out to buy a case to keep on hand. I would be really curious to see what this tastes like on tap - I suspect it is more appealing ""live."" So how does it compare to Guinness, the stout standard? I prefer it to Guiness for it's complexity and lack of Guinness's burnt, salty taste. However, it is ""hard core"" and like hardcore, perhaps too much of a good thing."
"This dark beer does wonders to the taste pallet. It is a rich malty beer but does not over do it. The time line of the taste is great, starts off strong with a chocolate taste and ends with a smooth after taste of the roasted malt. I aged the beer for a year, did change the beer a little but either way its great just as if it just came right from the brewery yesterday."
"Full bodied big ass beer with a chewy texture. The finish is surprisingly light almost dry. Alcohol is quite apparent making this a sipper. Highly recommended ."
"My only complaint is that I wish the normal stout flavors had a bit more presence. But, that's just if I had to complain. I'm bringing a couple bottles of this one down to my father in law's for Christmas to break the ice for sure."
"D- As above, little bitter for most people I know, it was smooth and not at all uncomfortable after the second beer. Goes down easy."
"This beer poured an opaque black with about a three finger dark tan head. The smell is of roasted malts and a fruitiness that's hard to put my finger on. Maybe raisins or plums or something. The taste is very strong with a definite alcohol presence. That 10.6% is making itself known. The taste predominantly bitter-sweet chocolate with alternating sips giving away to other flavors like malts and maybe molasses or prunes. A very complex beer worth sitting down and savoring. The mouthfeel is very thick, almost like a watery milkshake with slight warming from the alcohol, a very pleasant drink. I'll definitely be picking this up again sometime."
"d: It's filling, rich and potent making it a sipping beer that's as far from a session beer as you can get. Would not want more than one in a sitting. More drinkable than most RISs, hard to believe its 10% abv, ages quite well too."
"Bottom line: A very tasty and palate pleasing RIS that I can only highly recommend. My hat is off to Brooklyn Brewing."
"In any case, I enjoyed this one. While it cannot compare with my favorite Russian Imperial, Old Rasputin, it is an exceptional quaff that, like anything from this great brewery, is always worth seeking, finding, enjoying and reveiwing. Cheers!"
"My last bottle of the 07-08 bottling. The nose does have a mild cereal/ cocoa puff character along with dusty cocoa, a touch of spice ( anise, pepper)some sherry, a touch of prunes. The palate is a blend of roasted grains, a touch of tartness/ grainy acidity, some cocoa, a little bit of earth, some spice. A little bit of fruit is also present, bit this seems to have dulled a little bit. Still, a very good straight up RIS. 3.5/3.5/4"
"I'll bet it gets better in a few months, I think I'll get another case to save. Glad I bought it."
"Overall: A wonderful beer by Brooklyn and if I may profess the best damn stout I can buy off the shelf in Florida. I picked up 12 of these bad boys and may grab another 12 to get me thru the not so harsh winter."
"Pours an opaque, rich black color with some light brown frothy, creamy head that sits on top. A fair amount of lacing sticks around on this one, and comes back with every swirl. Smell is of roasted malt, and some hints of chocolate. Taste is bitter at first then a sweet middle before the rich finish of dried fruit, and some dark chocolate. Very creamy mouthfeeling. I seem to have enjoyed this one more so than the year old version."
"I need to figure out how much of this i need to get ahold of to last me until next year.. man i wish this was local to me!"
"Have I really just developed that much more of a taste for these big RIS's or have they really worked on this recipe? I really like this better than last year's. Alcohol is much less dominant. Same big roasted flavors but more pronounced coffee and chocolate notes to complement it. Not bad at all. Score has been adjusted."
"D - As much as I'd like to say I'd like to session with this beer; I couldn't. It's just a little too strong and heavy to have more than a couple of these. But, it's perfect to have just one or two after dinner to relax on a cold night."
"D - sip, savour, and enjoy this fine stout."
"D - Enjoy it -- it's a bit heavy to drink with food, but I'd love this after a day of skiing."
"D: How many can you have when the ABV is 10.6 percent? The answer: more than I should. It's that good."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Glad I was able to try it!"
"For the style, I'd put it a notch above the McNeils Imperial Stout. This one just seems so much smoother."
"Another great brew from Brooklyn. I'm going to head out and buy a case of the 06-07 and the 07-08 tomorrow. Can't wait for a vertical in a couple more years. I can imagine this beer changing a whole bunch over time."
"D - A strong beer that shows its power well into the 12 ounces. Incredibly delicious, and worth seeking out. Just make sure you enjoy it with a meal."
"Drinkability: Spent too much time on this review and less time enjoying the beer. I think it's time for another."
"Glugs out a motor oil black with minimal chocolate brown head. Smells of big chocolate, a minor hop, minimal coffee and the chocolate covered cherry alcohol scent. Taste is huge on chocolate, delicious. Cocoa, minimal coffee grounds and a bite at the finish. Some alcohol is apparent but not nearly as much as the ABV suggests. Smooth as silk in the mouth and a delight to taste. A sipper but in a very good way as you should savor this one. A little hot right now but with a little age this thing should be a classic."
"dark as night with a thick, dark tan head that has okay retention and tons of lace. Smells of roasty malt and choco choco choco malt. Super faint hop scent. The lack of hops is ok by me. Not every beer has to be hopped up. Taste is dark, unsweetened chocolate, burnt toffee, roasted malt. Full body, but not a silky as I had hoped. Nice little bitter finish. Pretty darn good. High abv will get ya. Not my favorite imp stout, but not bad at all. I can't wait to see how this one will be at the end of the winter."
"Great flavor to this one: Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, some alcohol and hops as it warms, and fruity notes (dark cherry, mostly). Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, but leaves one hell of an alcoholic/dark chocolate bite to the finish. This is a standout brew, probably one of Brooklyn's best. I can't wait to see how the BCS ages."
"D-Already on #3 for the night (one at the bar a couple of hours ago, and just popped the third) i don't think i could handle much more. That being said, i like this just as much as i did last year, maybe even more so. I plan on aging a few of these for next year to compare and drink the remaining amount for as long as i can find them"
"Grab a few and age it. Its pretty nice"
"I'm pretty satisfied at how this one has held up so far."
"Bottle. Vintage 2006. Pours with a little happy laughter and a big smile on my face. It (the beer, not my face) might have a little brownish hue, but it wouldnt be fair to call the beer ""Brown Chocolate Stout", as it really is as black as the original sin, and topped by a small but dense, tan head. At the very same moment the beer started to show itselves in the glass, heavy aromas escaped the glass, leaving coffee, dark chocolate, burnt and roasted malt, a vague note of dried fruits and even more chocolate, a bit sweet, in my nose. Even though its a lovely aroma, I wouldnt say no to even more complexity. Maybe some hoppyness, which is quite distinctive in the flavor, but the alcohol that comes when sipping it, Im happy to be without in the aroma. In addition to the elements of the aroma, and the fore-mentioned hops and alcohol, theres some licorice as well when tasting it. It has a good dash of bitterness in the finish, especially from the hops, but also coffee-like bitterness from the burnt malt. Its maybe a bit thin on the palate. Not that it is thin, but I expected it to be more chewier, yet it is quite sticky. The beer really suits the cold winter months, with its warming alcohol and lots of heavy flavors and aromas. Next time though, Im hopefully having a cellared version, as I believe it could use to have its corners rounded a bit. Well, now the beer is gone, all that is left is some nice, tan lacings and some flavors in my mouth. And the memory, off course. By the way, are there some cigar or cigarette smoke as well? At least there was something in the last drop. (070908)"
"This is a giant among stouts and a titan among beers. It's up there in the ABV department, so sip carefully and respect the hell outta this amazing beer."
"My first BA review, so here goes. 2007 vintage served in my DFH snifter. Poured an dark opaque brown with some ruby red highlights around the edges. Three-quarter inch mocha-colored head dissipated into an oily slick with some concentration around the bowl of the glass. Sheets of lacing with decent retention present during the tasting. Scent of chocolate, malt and molasses. Taste similar to nose with a touch of dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with very little carbonation and a bit chalky at the finish. Alcohol was very well-hidden, but this brew definitely packs a punch after a couple. Nice go to RIS if you're looking for something with a little less viscosity."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. Winter '06-07 bottling. A: Pours a black tar, with a thick dark brown head that goes down aftrer a few minutes to a thin caked--on layer. Minimal lacing. S: Surprising citrus tones, a lot of chocolate and caramel, raisins and spice. Hops are pretty distant. T: Delicious mocha up front, a lot of roasted malts, coffee, caramel, with some darker fruit, red wine and citrus around the finish. You can feel the alcohol at the back of the throat but it's not overwhelming. Really wonderful. M: Thick, gooey, chewy. D: Even though you get a sense of the alcohol, it doesn't feel like a 10.6 abv at all. I could drink way too much of this way too fast. Good thing I only have one bottle."
"D - Slightly boozy but very good. I was lucky enough to try a 5 year vertical a few months back and the 2 and 3 year old versions were sublime. I think this is a beer that needs a little time in the cellar."
"Poured 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A very deep black, with thin head that retains well, but leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Smells very much of chocolate, roasted malts and hops, and coffee. Probably one of the best smelling beers I've ever smelt. The taste is a bit overwhelming. The 10.6% alcohol is not to be underestimated. The chocolate and coffee taste is delicious as an after taste, but not before you are rushed with the heat of the alcohol. Be warned, this brew is not for the faint of heart. Rather light for something labeled as an imperial stout, and goes down really smooth. Overall, I'd highly recommend this beer for a beer tasting, but probably wouldn't session with it, as it would take you out quick. Delicious, but strong brew!"
"Near black, brown swamp mud color. Aroma of Mocha a Java chino sort of drink. Black malt and chocolate, even fudge. A little bit of hops. Flavor is twangy, bittersweet chocolate with burnt fruits and smoke. Full bodied and boozy yet drinkable. Quite good."
"bottled in the winter of 06-07, the sexy looking black chocolate stout beckoned my name from the fridge. i withstood its calling for about 30 minutes before cracking it open and pouring what seemed to be an interminable head. impressive for a 10.6% beer. the smell was full of chocolate (obviously) and heavenly sweet malts. and as i enjoyed a big whiff of my pitch black brew, a wall of alcoholic fumes singed my nostrils and abruptly brought me back to reality. the first sip revealed the smooth and creamy taste, but the burning of my digestive tract soon became too distracting. this was infinitely less drinkable than the speedway. i feel that it needs to mask the brutal alcohol a bit more, or just scale down the abv. maybe a year or two in the cellar might have done the trick, but i only bought one bottle. i guess i'll never know..."
"I was a little confused on this one, expected a Chocolate Stout, but it's listed as a Russian Imperial on here. Let's see...pours a dark black with coffee colored head...that could go either way. Smell is dark and malty, hints of hops...that leans more towards Russian Imperial...here comes the true test. Coffee, malts, cocoa...and hops. Russian Imperial it is, haha. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with just a hint of an oily feel. Drinkability is good, especially for such a rich beer. I don't know that I'll pick this up again, but I wouldn't pass it up if offered one."
"I'd have to call this my absolute favorite. I doubt I'd have more than one at a time, but with a beer this good, there's no need to."
"D-This is one dangerous brew, the taste is so powerful i dont know how many i could have but it is really good."
"I'd kill for the recipe. Good Stuff."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle labeled, Winter 06-07, into a pint glass. This Imperial Stout poured a totally opaque black with a nice big dark tan head that resulted from an aggressive pour. The head slowly faded away, leaving behind a thick, heavy lacing around the glass. The aroma of this stout was very lightly roasted malts and some chocolate. I was expecting quite a bit more out of the aroma. The flavor did not dissapoint , however. It was made up of nice roasted malts, chewy bittersweet chocolate, licorice, and a bit of molasses. The mouthfeel was definately full-bodied. Very thick and chewy, with miniamal carbonation. This was a very nice beer that I would like to revisit at some point in time."
"I have to begin by saying that I had a bottle of this at a friend's house and it was obvious that it had been sitting in the back of his fridge for at least a year I would say. That being said, this brew looked incredible when I poured it into my mug. Solid coffee black, but the head was disappointing, perhaps due to the age of this bottle. The smell was very different, not as overwhelming as I would have thought but I picked up roasted pecans and a lot of prune. You could detect a high alcohol content. The first sip comes on as heavy and coats the tongue with a bit of coffee and a heavy raisin flavor. There is a liquor feel and the carbonation faded pretty quickly (in this old bottle). I get a little charcoal at the finish but I am surprised to miss the chocolate. This seems to be all about the raisin/prune idea and it seems like some prominent chocolate flavor would really tone this down more to my liking, but I didn't get that here. Again, perhaps a fresher bottle would have done the trick. A few friends gave it a try and everyone found it to be a taste experience. Not really up my alley too much, though."
"Great stuff, but it is a quite demanding brew, not one to gulp."
"Make no mistake this is how beer should look, 3 fingers of chocolate brown head, thick and foamy, sits on top of a beautiful ink black body. Leaves nice lace. Nose is of rich roasted malts, and dark cordial chocolates = like a bakery meets a chocolatier. Enters the mouth sweet like Godiva. The cordial hints come thru on the way to a nice long dark chocolate/burnt malt bitter. Alchol is slightly up-front. Nice belly warmer. Mouthfeel stays long with toasty malt and dark chocolate bitter. I will be buying lots more of this as long as it stays available."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety smooth mouthfeel, and a good drinkabilty. Although the alcohol wasn't very strong in the flavor, I can sure feel it."
"Can't taste the big 10.6 abv, delicious enough to have another. Great offering from Brooklyn."
"You can't really tell the 10.6% here so this might be a good session beer if you were trying to pass out! Still a great beer."
"Pours an absolutely pitch black, with a very small deep tan head that dissipates quite quickly, leaving very little lacing and large surfacing bubbles, almost like a tar pit. Smell is big and forward, with dark and bitter chocolate dominant. Almost burnt it's so dark, this stuff is the real deal. Taste is big and bold too, with huge chocolate taste mixed with blackcurrants and licorice, and the big ABV noticible in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick as all get out, and with noticible carbonation, and drinkability is pretty good, though tempered by the alcohol that starts to catch up by the end of the bottle. Nice stout, truly imperial and with great character."
"Poured in the colour of well-used engine oil and smelling of alcohol, yeast, some coffee, and a load of chocolate. The taste was totally dominated by the chocolate with coffe or perhaps burnt ashes on top. The alcohol comes through as well. I like it when a (chocolate) stout is not too sweet so this one is definately a favourite. Having said that I think something more is needed to move it up a notch from good towards excellent."
"Inky black, with a creamy but short, latte-colored head. Wonderful aromas of chocolate and pepper. Probably the best balance of chocolate and stout roastiness I know of, with a smooth, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol makes itself noticed in a subtle way -- this beer has convinced me that 10-12% is exactly right for this style. Not as intense overall as my very favorites, but on the right occasion, this might be the best choice."
"A big bold aggressive stout. The black chocolate is a fitting name as it really contains an awfully lot of rich dark chocolate aroma and flavour. There is enough alcohol present to highlight the fact that this is a big beer and thus drinkability suffers slightly, however the alcohol never detracts from the depth of flavour in this superb beer."
"Not overly roasty for a big stout, it mostly shows up in the aftertaste. Instead, it's an amazing balance of sweetness, hops and roast, all of which can be easily picked out. This goes down as smooth as a baby's bottom."
"i enjoyed this along with chocolate chip cookies, made a nice addition and took the edge off the alcohol, adding a buttery creamy breadyness."
"--edited on 11-7-07"
"one or two is good. sip this one! I thought the alcohol was a little too strong untill I had my second one which was much colder and that masked the alcohol taste better for me."
"Overall: Black chocolate is a great description for this stout, very dark unsweetened chocolate flavors as well as espresso flavors make this a complex treat. Alcohol is very well masked, this one is definitely a sipper however. For a buck 50 a bottle this beer is a steal."
"Overall: This is my favorite imperial stout. It is an immense beer that manages deftly to avoid the cloying chewiness of many other American attempts at the style. I wish I had the patience to see what years in the cellar would do to this beer, by I have trouble keeping a 6 pack around much longer than 5 months. Mr. Oliver has proven once again that he is a true grand master of the art of brew craft."
"Appearance is extremely dark with a good amount of tan head. Aroma is extremely caramel malty, with some chocolate and bourbon notes...the maltiness definitely comes before the chocolate. Flavor is somewhat sour and oaky, with some bourbon notes. Chocolate is definitely less pronounced than most beers that have the word ""chocolate"" in their description, but that's not a bad thing. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky and yet astringent at the same time. This is a very interesting beer."
"This has become an East Coast classic. Worth looking for this one."
"06-07 vintage poured into an imperial pint glass. Very dark brown, almost opaque black color with a nice rich brown head. Lacing that lasted the whole pint ringing the surface, as well as clinging to the sides. When I first poured I caught whiffs of coffee, chocolate, and yeast. Last sniffs picked up some sweetness, and still some chocolate. Initially very bitter and almost acidic. As it warmed up, either in the glass or my mouth I could definately pick out chocolate flavorings. The warmer it got, the more chocolate came out. Reminded me of a dark chocolate, and was slighty bitter like a good dark chocolate is. The bitterness/acidity lingered on the tounge and in the mouth too long for me to completely enjoy the beer."
"Foamy cappucino colored head when poured that dissipated relatively quickly. What was left was a very dark brown beer, almost but not quite black. First of all, I have to say that this beer is a mouthfull. The body is wonderfully thick without being the least bit syrupy. Strong accents of chocolate and coffee augment the rich roasted malt flavors. The high alcohol wasn't obvious to me. Fairly bitter aftertaste. Very nice interpretation of the style."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"D: Very drinkable for the abv, but, look out! The alcohol sneaks up on you and all I can say is hydrate yourself (maybe eat a little something, too) between bottles of this."
"The taste is long awaited, much appreciated. Dark, malty, good deal of chocolate going on but not a ton, which I can appreciate. The balance here in stouty goodness is marvelous, bittersweet, espresso coffee grounded great great great. The mouth is pretty damn smooth, a bit chewy, very full in body, lovely. This isn't quite my favorite big boy stout, but I'm so very glad I traded for a sixer of it. A classic, for sure. Much thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one."
"Jan. 27, 2009 - Aroma is still intense as ever, but the carbonation and head have deadened quite a bit. Flavours are still balls-out with a slight hint of the papery edge that beers begin to get after a few years. Still a very enjoyable sipper though for a cold winter night."
"Like I said earlier these brews were enjoyed over a longer-than-average time span is exquisite, but due to a 10%+ ABV after 2 of these I could see the senses dulled enough to not get your money's worth for this beer. Truly a brew best enjoyed in moderation."
"Nice thick and chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is very light and only barely detectable. The only downpoints are that this is not as chocolatey as I had hoped for and as it warms it can become a bit on the bitter side. Drinkable, but with a powerful ABV."
"D: Because of the possibility of being bored with another run-of-the-mill stout, this one surprised me and did so with its unique flavor transition. Reminded me of other strong style stouts, but had its own flair, and for that, I give it a salute for keeping my tastebuds awake while masking the alcohol in a good way."
"This is a great beer and a very drinkable RIS. I wish this were available in my area. I'd love to grab some bottles for long-term cellaring."
"Overall: Excellent-This is a very complex flavored beer with a great mouthfeel and fantastic aroma. The taste while complex, does not seem to offer the level of hop/roasted bitterness I expect from a Russion Imperial Stout (storm King, Old Rasputin, etc.). The well hidden alcohol is both a positive and a negative. It is a positive because it is not as boozy as some in this style (Storm King) but it can sneak up on you quickly."
"Very good stout that I have been itching to try for a long time. I actually got this unexpectedly from a trade as an extra goodie. Thanks again to geexploitation."
"WOW this is a beer. I'll tell you what this beer and i had some good times together last weekend. But yea...down to buisness...the appearance was nice...dark dark brown, posibly black. It had a minimal head that was tan and about .25"". The smell was nice, warm, sweet and full. The taste was fantastic. Warm malts with a creamy vanilla hint and there might have been some coffee thrown in and of course there was a nice sweet chocolate after taste. The moutfeel was very smooth without much bite to it and the drinkability was very nice; i had 2-esque in a tasting spree i had."
"Drinkability: no."
"Overall, an oustanding stout, on par with the best of them. I will mourn the case, and look forward to next year!"
"If you can still get your hands on a bottle I would savor it and bring it out later in the year."
"Pours a thick black with a milk-chocolate coloured brown head that laces and retains very well, very nice start. Aroma of dark chocolate, burnt toast, coffee, definitely good Imperial Stout aroma. Taste was an intense dark chocolate, coffee, chocolate liquor, roasted cocoa beans, very flavourful and considering my tongue is still numb from the Thomas Hardy's I just had this beer's flavour has definitely eclipsed it. Mouthfeel was velvety smooth, ABV present but well blended. This is death by chocolate, simply fantastic."
"Smells of dark chocolate, alcohol, and just a hint of dark fruits. Tastes just like dark chocolate. Definte perception of alcohol and a slight coffee finish. This is very filling in the mouth and quite smooth and easy to drink considering the high abv. Very tasty but I feel it was more enjoyable on tap. Then again what isn't?"
"Pours a very dark brown/black with a one finger chocolately color head. Aroma is predominantly chocolate with a hint of roasty malt. Taste is a nice blend of cocoa with some roast coffee finish. Mouthfeel is very full and you definitely feel the alcohol. Very drinkable, IMO. I could probably drink two or three which would be more than enough for me. Excellent dessert beer."
"D: A decent Imperial Stout with a nice chocolate taste. I am hoping this beer will mellow with age because right now it lacks balance. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is nice and thick and shallowly-carbonated, and drinkability is OK for a beer this big, but I've had much better. As an Imperial Russian Stout, it's just OK."
"Pours out like Pennzoil, with a little bit of light brown head. Can't see anything through it. The aroma is of dark chocolate, a little licorice, some alcohol. The flavor is nice, loaded with cholocate, cocoa, licorice, dark toast, and coffee. The bitter finish hangs around in the mouth. The alcohol is present, too, and lends itself toward a fermented cranberry note too. Overall, very yummy. Appropriately, it's very creamy and chewy, nicely carbonated. It's easy to drink, as it's so delicious, but the alcohol becomes more obvious as time goes on, so I couldn't pack these in. I would no qualms about returning to this beer, though, either."
"Drinikibilty - this is good, but not great. High abv also limits sessionability."
"Outstanding."
"Paired well with a roast beef sandwich and a slice of brie, incidentally."
"I have loved this beer since 1995. It pours jet black, with a beautiful brown head of foam. It smells sweet, of chocolate and coffee. The taste is powerful, sweet, but balanced, with espresso and chololate overtones, a little licorice in the finish. It is quite smoothe in the mouth, surprisingly little alcohol burn for a beer of this strength. At 10.6%, it is not a beer to be consumed in volume, but enjoyed sip by sip. A prize to be found."
"And as far as drinkability goes, I could drink the whole sixpack but I think I would get full after two - so rich. I couldn't detect the alcohol because the chocolate was so rich. (If you think about the price for a sixer of 10% beer it's as cheap as a 30 rack of macro.)"
"Bottle courtesy of HogTownHarry- mucho gracias. This is one great looking stout- pours out like satans blood. Dark as hades. The flavour is sublime- great roasted chocolate flavour. Smooth mouthfeel. 10.6%? Cant believe it? Really seems like a session stout- one that would put you under the table after a few. Hops are detectable at the finish for some balance, although this beer isnt overly sweet some there must be more hops there than I think. Overall a great stout."
"Drinkability - Wow can't taste that 10%. Great stout."
"tried one from the cellar and wow! after a year the beer has mellowed by a factor of 5 at least. The inital blast of booziness is replaced by a richer, smoother overall taste and mouthfeel."
"Another bottle courtesy of MuenchenerKindl."
"This is a full bodied, thick stout with minimal carbonation. A nice sipper to say the least."
"Overall a very good example of a beer brewed with chocolate malt. Not overtly chocolaty and with alot of other flavors as well. This is a standard in my cellar."
"Pours a beautiful big head that looks fluffy and strong. Reminds me of the Rogue Chocolate Stout. The color is jet black and lets no light through whatsoever. Leaves a great lacing behind and the head doesn't fall and break away hardly at all. Smell is a little light. I smell a little bit of chocolate and some coffee. There's also some vanilla. There seems to be a bit of an off flavor, but maybe it's just in the smell. Nope, somthing's up with this beer, I can't taste any alcohol burn, but there is a burnt toast flavor that is in the aftertaste after some sweet flavors, and that's not great. It's a very burnt flavor mixed with a green characteristic, not a lot of chocolate I noticed. The mouthfeel was very good, something to remember, overall I will try this again in a year, I have more, and see how it's doing, but it's not too impressive right now."
"D: Great to sip on, one of my favorite brews for those cold winter nights"
"Very thick and creamy mouthfeel, velvety-smooth. The taste seems a little raw and unrefined, but nonetheless a good example of an imperial stout. I definitely won't be afraid to try it again, and it did hit the spot perfectly on a cold winter night like tonight."
"I was told not to chill, but I did and then I let it sit out about fifteen, served just below room into a nonic, head rose and fell I will assume its my glass wear (got put in the dishwasher). Head is a dark kaki, gray color, with thin yet sticky lacing. The body is oily mahogany and completely opaque. Smell is robust, with great complex rich malt notes, hints of coffee on the outer edge rounded out by a well blended chocolate, and raison character, non of these are too pervasive, they simply add to a bigger better complex flavor. I get some toasted dark malts with hints of anise and as it warms up it becomes smokey, salty earthy and great, like a delicious piece of bark (if that makes sense). Taste is meaty and chewy, very nice complexity, subtle and hearty blend of taste sensation. IBU is in a very drinkable place, balanced well and aids in the flavor perfectly. I am crazy about this beer especially, because a sixer is about 10 bucks, its delicious and strong. I will definitely by this again."
"D: A sipper for sure. This one is perfect for a cold winter's night. A sure bet year after year. This could possibly be my favorite beer."
"A surprisingly smooth Imperial Stout. I've head some that were more brutish & raw (GLBC Blackout) and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Matter of fact, I am craving another one so that I might enjoy it slower, more relaxed. Thats the word - relaxed. If you are looking for a Russian Imperial Stout that is ""relaxed"" check this out. An outstanding beer, and one that will definitely move off the short list of ""got to try"" and onto the short list of ""must have every winter"". Highly recommeded."
"An excellent example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mighty in every way. One of the best I have had to date."
"Drinkability: A nice imperial stout with a lot of alcohol kick, but not the best I've tasted."
"Poured deep black as midnight with a huge creamy head the would not fade till the end. Thick gooey lace that stuck to and clouded up the glass. This looks thick like a milk shake, gottta love it. Smell was very nice big chocolate as you would expect but hints of alcohol as well. Caramel, sugar and vanilla round it very nicely, perfect dessert. This tatstes very yummy, deep dark chocolate flavors, with a slight alcohol warming, wonderful creamy feel. This is very nice. Dry finish, smooth and for 10.5% abv it is very drinkable. I only wish I was able to get more for the cellar, as I feel this will only improve with time! Great beer and glad I could try it."
"I've had better, but this is a good brew. Of note, I didn't like it in the bottle when I tried it last year, but I would get this on tap again, despite the generally 'middle of the road' ratings."
"Needless to say, this beer pours a jet black. A beautiful tan head appears then retreats to the outer ring. Aroma is pungent with raisins, licorice, prunes, and chocolate. Flavor is ripping with plum, raisin, anise, and a citrus burst in the finish. Can't believe someone could make a drink like this simply from roasted malts. There is cocoa in the middle, but it doesnt resound with chocolate as much as Bell's Expedtion stout. Likewise the hop bitterness is slightly less here, however, well balanced. There is a slight trail off in fullness as you swallow which makes this beer more moderate and drinkable. However, with the ABV as high as it is, you probably would not be able to drink a whole six pack in an evening. Rich and complex with an alcohol burn. Completely recommended and I am putting a couple bottles down to age. I could see a bottle of this really coming into its own after a year or two."
"Dark chocolate is definitely apparent in the taste, but it's cut with a bitter coffee jolt right up front -- though it's not necessarily a bad thing. The coffee's bitter, but not burnt. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden, though it does contribute to a considerable warming effect as you go. The taste gets a little grainy as it warms, but overall this is an extremely smooth beer with a silky mouthfeel."
"d: excelent for an after dinner treat, I could not do more than 2 at a time."
"Could use some aging. This is a beer with great potential, but the flavor feels like it is budding rather than flowering. buy a 6er and hide it your closet for a year or two. Its the only way IMO."
"D- I really like this stout. I think they got exactly what they were going for. I wouldn't mind one of these again at all."
"From McKean & Charles in Waldoboro. Pours pitch black with thin brown head. Smells a bit like cocoa. Taste? Holy moly, a really rich taste of dark malt, unsweetend cocoa and some bitter cocoa in the finish. Nice mouthfeel, thicker than normal but really nice, solky smooth. Overall: damn great beer!! I gotta get more this week. This just might edge out Sam Smith's Imperial stout as a favorite!!"
"D - This is an outstanding beer. Its flavors are amazing and it goes down so well."
"Poured out like oil, very dark and thick, low head and low carbonation, nice stout. Beer gave a nice malt aroma, with some burnt chocolate as well. Same with the taste, although at times it seemed like this years high ultra high alcohol content affected it a little. Mouthfeel about what you would expect, thick and flat, some foam. Good beer, really warms you up this year."
" Anyway, served in a pint glass, a beautiful opaque black with hints of brown and a small dark black head. Excellent so far. Nose is heavy roasted malts, sweet chocolate, and the slightest hint of sweet ethanol on warming. Taste is nice thick roasted malts with hints of milk chocolate, and lingering bitter chocolate in the finish. A little bit syrupy. Full mouthfeel, quite smooth. Drinkability is good, but watch out for that ABV. I had no idea this was over 10%, the alcohol is very well hidden. I would have guessed 6% or so."
"Drinks to damn easy, this is 10.6 abv? I think I can session on this until nap time"
"hmmm Robert The Bruce?"
"Incredibly drinkable stout, especially for what it is, and that is a tasty time-bomb waiting to go off--the alcohol content isn't really noticable until after a bottle has been downed, and you're reaching for another one already. And then the trouble becomes apparent. Best to share this with friends."
"This is good but its very complex for me.All of the flavors seem to blend in together.I want to have this again but save some till my palate gets more intune with all different flavors."
"Not much I can add to what's already been said. Fantastic beer. It's like Old Rasputin and Rochefort 10 had a baby :) I could drink cases of this. Could do with a better nose but whatever, great overall. The 10.6% makes this a good candidate for ageing, if you can resist drinking it now."
"Overall: An extremely delicious stout. I have had this many times over the years and have finally decided to get into the reviewing game. I think this year's version is a little heavier on the alcohol fruitiness then the roasted malts of years past. Still very tasty, a sipper, for sure."
"Overall: This brew ages among the best of them. If you like a fresh bottle of BCS, have some patience and cellar a few. Wait a year and enjoy this sipper for an hour or so. Complex, mature, and delicious, this cellared brew is a definite winner."
"This is a black, black beer that I was excited to see hitting the Chicago market. It poured completely black with a a short tan head. The smell was coffee, sweetness and soy sauce. The taste was coffee, burnt malts and a little bit of chocolate. The mouth feel was frothy. This beer tasted young and was kind of a mess. I found the carbonation to be quite high for a RIS. The 10.6% alcohol was noticable.Overall, I found this harsh and difficult to drink. Maybe a couple of years in the cellar will do it good."
"Pours a midnight black with some brown highlights and a short brown head that dissappears almost immediately and leaves only very spotty lacing. The smell is quite complex with dark malt, coffee, licorice, and a touch of soy sauce. The taste is a little more subtle and very smooth. Starts slightly sweet with a hint of soy, some sweet malt, coffee and a touch of sour roastiness. The flavor finishes with a prolonged licorice bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little light, but very smooth and somewhat creamy. Very drinkable- the high abv is not noticed at all, and the smoothness facilitates the drinkability."
"** Drank the 07-08 on tap , still yummy!"
"Drinkanility. Oh yeah. Delicious."
"This is a tastey rich stout. Worth a try."
"Definitely one of the blackest beers I have ever seen. Aroma is just what you'd expect, chocolate and lots of it. The taste is pretty much that of the darkest chocolate I can possibly imagine. This is one that takes a little while to drink, but very enjoyable. Goes great with a chocolate dessert, especially chocolate cake."
"Drinkability-This is a good beer, but the finish is just too sharp for me to drink more than a few. But definately an a great after dinner beer."
"Slight alcohol feel on the tip of the tongue is all that holds the mouthfeel back from perfection. It is creamy, thick and holds on to the palate which is great as the flavors are outstanding. While I couldnt drink more than two (Im stopping at one) the drinkablility for the style is phenomenal. A treat I look forward to every year."
"Poured a solid and thick black color with a very small tan head that faded away. Left no lacing. Nose was of sweet dark chocolate, black coffee, and roasted malt. Flavors hits you with a sharp alcohol tinged sweetness, chocolate, coffee, dark alcohol-soaked fruits. Alcohol is very pronounced. Drinkability is still high considering the ABV. A good beer to kick back during winter and relax with."
"This is a harsh and rather difficult to drink beer (even for this style). Worst of all, I could not detect any hint of chocolate in this so-called ""Black Chocolate Stout."""
"One to look forward to every season!"
"Overall - An outstanding stout... probably my second favorite after Rogue Imperial..."
"Definately one of my top favorites of all styles."
"Drinkability: Perfect for a winter brew  its 20 degrees in NYC today and this goes down very nicely. The high ABV warms you  and warns you  but youre not going to listen because its just that good."
"4.5's across the board."
"4th and final bottle of 4-pack consumed on 1/14/14. Now well over a year old. Gorgeous pour. Huge, frothy, sticky, medium brown head. Super mellow with massive malt, chocolate, and wood flavors. Nose and taste are spectacular. Still some booze present but it's only complementary at this point. Incredibly smooth with proper carbonation and a fantastic finish. As expected, this is the best bottle yet."
"D - I'd give it a year. This was brewed for winter 2006, so I'm going to age the rest."
"I love my coffee strong and black, but I can't touch caffeine after 3pm if I want to sleep at night. A glass of this stout is like a mug of espresso that you can have at bedtime. Very nice!"
"Drinkability is dangerously high, considering I only picked up 2 singles, the other will age for a year."
"I must say, I much prefer this beer fresh over when it is aged. I want my chocolate malt flavors and aromas to be in-your-face, not mellowed. Drinking Black Chocolate Stout is always a delicous experience. I really love this beer, as I tell everyone within hearing distance."
"My biggest problem with this beer is the ever presence of alcohol, particularly in terms of taste. It's a big beer at over 10% but I just don't feel like it's hidden very well. It's especially present when cold, but even as the beer warms I still get more alcohol on my palate than I'd like."
"In the pantheon of Russian Imperial stouts, this one certainly ranks right up there. A dark, dark brown with a thick mocha colored head. Aroma was predominately chocolate, but the coffee was noticeable. Very chocolate taste, intense and chewy. Smooth, alcohol not particularly noticeable. This could be a problem, except that the beer is so rich you're not going to want to drink a lot at one sitting."
"If you see this, give it a try. It has a nice hefty flavor worth experienceing."
"EXCELLENT BEER if you're into a dark rich, thick stout like this!"
"Drinkability: Because the alcohol is so well hidden and the flavors are so dynamic, this is a really drinkable stout. The alcohol's effects can sneak up on you(put me to sleep, damnit!), but this is definately a 2, possibly 3 bottle(12oz) in a night Imperial Stout."
"A great brew! I cannot wait to taste a couple of these aged."
"This bottle poured a dark black with only a small, tan head. The aging seems to have taken away some of the carbonation. The nose was very nice and highlighted by obviosuly chocolate hints, although subtle. The taste is where this beer makes its mark: A puff of semi-sweet chocolate off the top that turns only slightly bitter towards the end of the sip. A decadent chalky cocoa follows and the combination lingers long and pleasantly. Coffee bean undertones & roasted malts. Mouthfeel was exceptional. Although the pour revealed little carbonation, the body was lively enough to offer up some fresh mouthfeel and mix in a creaminess off the back end. I don't have a newer bottle of this beer to compare it to but this aged bottle is simply outstanding. Superb in every aspect."
"Dangerously drinkable, I have to keep reminding myself it is a sipper. I may have to pick up another six pack of this year's version before it is gone."
"Served in a pint glass, the BBCS pours a dark brown/black color with a small (about a finger high) tan head. Lacing is good. It smells like chocolate, dark fruit (raisins and plums) and roasted malt. It tastes like chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a bit of alcohol. It starts off sweet and then has a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is very good, it's nice and smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a very, very good beer. I'd definitely recommend it to others, it's a very nice brew."
"D: Sip it slowly because of the high ABV%. I drank this while playing card games with friends - perfect complement to socializing with taking this one in and enjoying it. The character changes nicely as the brew warms to room temperature."
"Poured from 12 oz single into a tulip pint glass. Appearance is completely black with less than a finger of well tanned head. Smell is heavy on espresso with some chocolate and maybe licorice. Taste is as advertised: chocolate at the front with coffee finishing with milky chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonation is not very noticable. Not the most drinkable ale I've had-- its nearly 11% ABV is too much to mask and more than two in one sitting would be a bit much. Well done though, even if it's not my thing."
"Overall: I like this beer quite a bit, I was prepared to be disappointed after pouring it because of the lacklustre appearance, but everything else about this beer was either decent or quite good. I find the combination of Belgian dark fruit flavours and traditional stout are quite unique..."
"I'd just tried this year's bottling back in Indiana, and now at the Drafting Room in PA i see the 2005 version on tap. I jumped at the chance. Served in a snifter looking very dark brown to black with a little chocolate brown head. Odor is bitter cooking chocolate and some indecipherable dark fruits. Smells delicious and tamer than the fresh version. Taste is a fantastic chocolate with slight bitterness. Some cherries among the chocolate. Coffee on the finish. amazingly well balanced. velvety smooth. a deluxe drink experience. A year's aging does wonders for this already fantastic brew."
"Very well done."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle that stated it was for the 06/07 winter so pretty fresh. Was deep black in color even when held against a light. Had a nice dark head that settled down to a constant foamy film with good lacing. Mouthfeel was good but but as creamy as I would have expected. The smell had the obvious chocolate malts smell with sweet malts in there as well. The 10.6 ABV also came thru in the smell which I normally don't like since leads to high alcohol taste which this one had but not too bad. The taste was good but I still prefer Young's Double Choc over this one. Recommend trying. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Drinkability is OK. It's a mouthful, high ABV and very intense flavor. One will do it for me tonight. But I'll be back..."
"Nose is milky chocolate and syrupy burnt caramel. Taste would be very similar but there's a bit of sweetness that reminds me of the outside of a burnt marshmallow. This is silky smooth and the alcohol is almost totally masked. This is a damn fine stout, a definite pleaser."
"This beer was a new experiance for me. I am familiar with the stouts, but this stout was unlike them all. I've had this beer numerous times in the past 2 weeks, both from bottle and from tap. Thats how good this is. Real potent. Not a beer that you will want to party with. It has a rich flavor that compliments red meat dishes. Brooklyn brewing company definitely has a winner with this chocolate stout."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed an partial skim of bubbles over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Bubbles seem to just swirl around, not really any growth or diminishing of head, with light lacing that falls very slowly. Aroma is tanninish creamy black malts, with some hops character as well. Taste is a duel of dark sweetness and bitterness, with the bitterness losing until the hops come on and even up the score. Vinous fruitiness pops up throughout, and alcohol warming quickly takes effect. Mouthfeel is so easy it seems almost thin, and drinkability is very high once you get a little bit of the warmth going on. A little age doesn't hurt this one."
"Drinkability is exceptional even with a 10% ABV-- maybe because of the flavor and mouthfeel, I didn't tend to noitce the alcohol's affect on my constitution."
"Enjoy it."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice small tan creamy head which quickly leaves, but leaves a few islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is sligthly licoricey, sweet roasted malts, some hops hovering around, and lots of chocolate/toffee. The taste is awesome of sweet roasted malts, and chocolate, the finish is clean. Nice warming effect in the throat. Medium body, well rounded brew. This is a very nice RIS from Brooklyn, very very tasty. Highly recommended."
"It should be noted that this beer was tasted right after trying a Goose Island Bourbon Stout. Thats hardly fair for Brooklyn. I did enjoy this beer, its much more affordable, and Id be glad to have another."
"Original review: 2004 vintage, 4.6 overall rating. 2006-07 upped the alcohol almost 2 percent. It pours into the balloon glass inky black with a half-inch brownish head that recedes quickly to a collar, leaving some wisps of lace. The aroma consists of chocolate, pale, and roasted malts, dark fruits (currant, blackberry?), anise, smoke?, green apple, bubblegum?, and citric/tropical hops with hints of Fuggle. On the palate it is roasty/vinous, with chocolate and burnt malts, coffee, tobacco?, and citric, piney, minty?, cedary? hops which meld with the roasted malts to create a medium to high bitterness. The body is tingly at first, medium-thick, with a medium to long finish. Overall it's not as good as the 2004 - I think it needs more body and less alcohol, with the malts at the forefront. The alcohol needs to be an afterthought for this beer, not the premise."
"Poured a opaque black, very syrup like as it pours into the glass. A small beige to caramel colored head forms, but slowly dissolves away. A deep chocolate aroma almost smacks the nose out of the glass, there are sweet malt scents and dried fruit aromas blending in at the end. That chocolate stands out in the flavor as well, and attacks the palate, then slowly the malt comes foward, with a smack of bitterness right at the end. A thick and syrupy feel, very heavy on the palate. This is a very good beer, with a very good aroma and strong flavor, make this a joy to drink."
"This is the first RIS I have had out of a pint glass, and I must say it's a fitting beer vessel. Very full of flavor. Just be careful not to get overwhelmed by the alcohol. At 10% ABV, this beer lets it sneak up on you. Recommended"
"A great winter sipper that is not brewed to be drank by the 12 pack, but very drinkable for a RIS. I will be sitting a few aside to try next year as i bet it holds up well after a year or two."
"'05-'06 vintage. Dark and thick appearance. Rather oily body, with sharp funky plums and thick chocolate malts upfront. Vintage-tamed hops, although they still have quite a presence. Old-school russian imperial stout, it's no tame Samuel Smith, nor is it a wild Storm King. The mouthfeel is equal parts sludge and silk. Notable alcohol presence similar to red wine. Quite a luxury beer. Thanks to zrrbrrt for the trade. Cheers!"
"Pours out like used motor oil. Has a rich, roasted malt smell. Minimal head, but what was there was a dark tan. Hints of coffee and cocoa in the nose. Has a strong roasted malt taste that ends in chocolate flavors. A hint of sweetness and alcohol when it first hits the tongue is quickly surpassed by bitterness. Chocolate notes come out as the beer breathes and warms up to make this a very pleasant sipping beer."
"Overall I think the ABV is a bit overpowering for the flavor of this Stout. I think it could be masked a bit with more roasted malt for this to be considered stronger for the style. I dont think I could drink many of these. Not sure this is one I would come back to for East Coast RIS. Its too bad as Im a big Brooklyn fan."
"Not especially aromatic, but tastes somewhat like a rich chocolate mousse with hints of coffee. Sweet and rich. Finish is not too dry."
"12 oz bottle from Florians. Complete opaque black body with about a half an inch of tan head and a fair bit of lacing. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Tastes very roasty and malty, coffee and chocolate dominate. Little bitterness to speak of. Some alcohol warming and flavor too. Full bodied - among the best mouth feels of any beer I've had. Full flavored and pleasant. Goes down really smooth. Malty sweetness with some roasty coffee on the finish. Wow, I'm impressed with this beer. A new favorite stout. Glad I snatched up two 6-packs! Glad it's in Maine now!"
"BBCS is a huge beer, the biggest I've ever had. More complex than Rasputin. I am going to cellar some to see how it is after the alcohol is tamed."
"This one ages remarkably well."
"I drink this beer every year,a must try beer every year for me."
"This is a fine seasonal offering from Brooklyn Brewery that I've been eager to taste for some time. I think the flavors would benefit well from a bit a bit of aging, though it is still a tasty brew when fresh."
"With a beer this good, I guess they don't need a fancy, or cool label."
"The best thing about this beer in my opinion is it's drinkability. Each drink goes down extremely smooth as if it were a 5-7% beer. I would definitely pick this one up again in larger quantities."
"An enjoyable beer but the alcohol is a little overpowering right now. It overshadows the roasted malt profile and makes it difficult to pick out too many subtle nuances. This is one that I can pretty much guarantee will get better with age. Good now, but could be great in a year or two."
"D - The first time I tried this RIS, I didn't enjoy it...this was about 10 months ago. As I could tell my tastes were developing, I couldn't wait to try it again, and it was more than worth the wait. Would make for a wonderful addition to a session tasting and I plan on cellaring the rest of my case for enjoyment in the years to come."
"Another beer that has finally made it to MI. Simply one of the best, and a great value to boot. Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up some"
"About $9 a six-pack"
"I repeat myself in saying this is a beautiful, beautiful beer. Dark, no light, deep tan head, lacing- gorgeous. Nose is chocolatey and sweet- deeply so, like hot chocolate and espresso. Malty. Sweet. Taste is sweeter than the Dragon, chocolatey, missing the bitterness I enjoyed in Dragon, but sweeter. Not necessarily better or worse- just different frames of mind. Mouthfeel good, drinkability good- again, a very tasty brew. Sweet, tasty, chocolatey, dessert beer. Dessert, in a beer. This batch is definitely more well-balanced. Good stuff. And sneaky alcohol content- boys, give your girls this- you'll thank me later."
" Overall, a pretty good beer, and a fine representation of RIS."
"Oh yeah!!! I love this stuff. Pours like motor oil with a nice brown head. Thick and smooth; Easy to drink for such a strong brew. The chocolate and nut flavors really come out. This is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout so far, but I havent had many types. After first trying a bottle I went out immediately and bought two six packs for fear they would sell out too quickly. When I first went to Bierkraft for it, they were out. Get it now or you will miss out this year, but don't worry there is always next year."
"Overall, I unfortunately received this and the Young's Double Chocolate at the same time to share. The creamy, vanilla goodness of Young's was really what I was looking for at the time, which detracted from my overall enjoyment with the Brooklyn version. Very good nonetheless."
"Highly Recommended, but I would not go as far to say this is the best beer on the market. ALSO, the bottling is VERY attractive."
"This beer pours a dark-as-night black color with a moderate head. The smell is hard to tease out, but is much like alcohol and dark malts. Just a hint of something sour, although I am really not sure what it is... The taste is very special. It takes a little while for it to develop on the tongue, but its mostly like the same dark malts with just a hint of hops. The aftertaste is overwhelmingly like coffee, and lingers on the tongue for a long time. Many sweet notes as well, but I cant place where they would come from. This is a terrific beer, and well worth seeking out."
"More impressed with the taste fomr the tap than from the bottle. The flavors were much more complex, and seemed to dance on the tastebuds for a longer period of time. Black coffee, baker's chocolate, a hint of bitter hops all to be found. Mouthfeel is chewy and a bit sticky. It's a high ABV, so drinkability isn't great. But this really is a finely crafted winter beer."
"Cheers!!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Solid RIS, although a bit less hop character than there could be. A good dessert beer (for someone who's already a beer drinker), but not an introductory beer."
"Poured a midnight black color with a small tan head, leaving trace amounts of lacing. Smell is roasty, chocolate-y, and a bit fruity. Taste is pretty nice, some chocolate and roastiness, but seemed to have more earthiness from the hops than I liked. I think this would be eliminated with aging, and would increase my score. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Was fun to drink, and would like to get more, but would like to age it to see how it develops."
"This is a very tasty stout that just needs some time to mature and tame the alcohol (I hope). At around 7 bucks a sixer, this is an incredible bargain. I suggest buying a few for now and a few to put away for next year."
"The drinkability is awesome at 10.6 ABV (and you would never know it) the beer just gets for sip after sip. Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"I like the mouthfeel. It's full, but not too full, a little sticky, and the aftertastewhich is mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with some bitternesslingers for quite some time. This is great beer, and a great model of the style. Cheers to Brooklyn Brewery!"
"This beer has been significantly improved over the past 5 years. It has become an awesome example of what I know to be a Russian Imperial Stout. Bought a six pack of this at Wegman's back home in Syracuse, NY. Enjoyed in a nonic glass. Hard poured it to get some of that dark brown head and lacing on the edge of the glass. As far as aroma and taste goes, there's only one word and that is MALT! Sooo much awesome malt flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel is sticky but smooth. Perfect amount of alcohol warming as well. I had three of these during Thanksgiving day...I felt so at home."
"05/06: Appearance: 4, Smell: 3.5, Taste: 3.5, Mouthfeel: 4, Drinkability: 3.5"
"First sampling of the Winter 06-07 edition, noting a whopping 10.6% on the bottle. Fans of this brew know it for it's deep black color, no light's getting through this one. A creamy foam head sticks to this beer all the way down, leaving it's lace on my glass. Don't let it's smell mislead you, smells medicinal, almost chemical...Once it hits your tongue it is a complete sensory overload. What first amazes me is the creamy, rich mouthfeel. This beer is like drinking silk. Up front is a warm, dark chocolaty smooth flavor. The maltiness is what hits you first, and is quickly followed by an incredibly pleasant hop bite and some alcohol as you swallow, leaving a roasted chocolate hop flavor to linger in your mouth. I wouldn't have guessed this was 10.6% by the flavor, but you definitely can taste the alcohol. This doesn't bother me, i feel it adds to the flavor in this case. The complexity of the flavor is almost impossible to describe, you'll have to get your own and make your own judgements. I could probably ponder the flavors of this beer all night but after 2 or 3 it's lights out! Such an amazing accomplishment for American beer, I'm really surprised this isn't top 100 material on BA. Thanks Brooklyn!!"
"I am not a big brooklyn fan, except for the historic Dodgers, but this is an outstanding brew. Pours a huge creamy almost whipped creamy head. Has lacing dripping down the glass. Malts dominate the beer, with chocolate, coffee, and whiskey. Finishes with a slight whiskeyish finish. Slight hoppiness at the end. Is dark black in color. Terrific price and an even more terrific beer!"
"Very impressed with this stout, and it's a great value to boot. I could see this brew getting a lot better with some age as the alcohol is still a little bit harsh, but I'm enjoying it right now."
"D- Strong but soo good. Drink it late after dinner on a winter night."
"Sampling the 06-07 edition. Pours a completely opaque black with a very thin dark tan head. Aroma is melted chocolate, with some spicy hops and some sour fruitiness as well. Taste is dark roasted coffee, unsweetened chocolate, with some hoppy bitterness that melds well with the chocolate flavors in the finish. Some sort of sour fruit, too, but I can't quite place it - maybe black currants? Super slick mouthfeel, with very little carbonation evident, and leaves a thick coffee syrup aftertaste, but that's what I'm looking for in an Imperial Stout, so it's good. Very drinkable, and I appreciate that the bottles are 12oz, so if you drink one you don't get completely hammered."
"Mouth is full and discombobulated. Again I think this will age into a winner. I will review again in 2 years."
"All around a good beer if you're in the mood for a chocolate experience."
"Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout pours a deep opaque black with a cream brown head. Huge aroma of chocolate, dark malts, toffee and raisins. Flavor is more of the same, a big malty backbone of roasted and caramel malts. It's sweet, but not overly so for its strength. There is a strong hop bitterness that barely balances the beer. Alcohol is definitely present, but very well hidden for almost 11%. A steal at $8 a six pack."
"D: To be drank one at a time, save a couple, impossible to be chugged so you don't have to worry about jackass friends stealing it."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a thick black with some dark brown foam that dissipated quickly to a thin layer over top the beer. Smells of alcohol, dark chocolate, and a bit of sweetness. Taste of alcohol, unsweetened bitter chocolate, and some burnt flavors. The mouth feel was thick and creamy. I like this brew a lot but the high alcohol keeps me from enjoying a few of these at a time. A great winter warmer I'll have on those cold days."
"This is a wonderful dessert/nightcap brew!"
"Overall: This is the Winter 05-06 release. Thanks to HimerMan for hooking me up. He also sent me the 03-04, and the 04-05 releases. I will be reviewing those as well, to see how this beer ages. I really liked this one, so I have high hopes."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D: Simply an excellent beer. It was wonderful to try an example that had aged a year, bringing out the depth of the flavors and aroma. This one is going on my list of favorites..."
"Overall a solid brew and a great value."
"Pours a very near-black with a nice coffee foam head. Very nice. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, although it is more designed for aging. The high alcohol (10.6%) is a bit too dominant in the smell and taste and is the only thing (though very minor) to hold this back from being priceless. Still, this has a wonderful combination of coffee, chocolate, and burnt-nutty malts. Very complex and a wonderfully balanced mouthfeel. I'm very eager to see how this one ages."
"What a pleasant surprise tonight. Found this at my favorite BP for $2 a single. What a steal! First time trying this one. Label said 10.5% ABV, but you can not tell with all the chocolate malts. Bitter like Hershey's Special Dark, this one is an enjoyable and affordable RIS. Does not equal Bell's or Stone, but a worthy experience. Worth getting a good number of these and see how they age."
"D: I would (and will) get this beer again. I have always liked Brooklyn and the praise for this beer is deserved. The ABV and the rich nature are only good for one nice beer after dinner."
"Very nice job, Sir..."
"Poured a beautiful jet black from the bottle with a somewhat thin, creamy tan head. I may have poured it too cold and the aroma was faint. Smelled like chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Tasted like chocolate at first, then coffee and a hint of nuttiness. Finished chocolatey and alcoholic. The mouth feel was very nice, oily and slick. This was my first impy, so it was quite an experience. As it warmed up, the aroma was more pronounced, but toward the alcohol side. Some people seem to be of the opinion that sitting on this for a bit is best. I agree with that camp. See you next year Brooklyn BCS."
"DA: I gotta admit, I was FEELIN' this after my second one...10.6%ABV is no joke, but since I love these monster stouts you KNOW I'm having another(too many)"
"D - I could drink these until I black ""chocolated"" out (corny I know, but its true)"
"The drinkability is excellent for such a hard hitter. The flavours meld well together and there is not one thing that stands out as overdone or misplaced. This is very well crafted and it will surely be a yearly tradition in my household from now on. I am glad we have this at our disposal now. Also of note, this bottle was very well priced for something in this abv range."
"I was finally able to try this beer on tap, and it is truly excellent. The appearance of the 06-07 version was a consistent chocolate colour. The smell is what makes this beer great. It had a more intense coffee aroma than the bottled version. In fact, I would go as far as saying it had a bite. The aroma definently drew me in. The taste matched the aroma: a combination of coffee malts and sweet cocoa. The mouthfeel is mostly smooth, with some kick to it. Given the high alcohol content, the drinkability is exceptional. I ended having three pints in one sitting, and I barely noticed it. It is worth the price of admission!"
"Huge body, and very delicious. Easily the best I've had from Brooklyn, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is alright, but its bitter and it's 10.6% abv."
"The beer pours a beautiful black body with a dark tan head that stood rather proud. The aroma was full of chocolate and roasted malts with a nice backing of hops. The taste of this beer was huge first came a little hops flavor to wake the tounge up and then all the malts just rushed in giving it a huge flood of flavors. The flavor that came out mainly was of a bittersweet chocolate and some fusal alcohol note present in the taste. The stouts finish was a lingering dry one that left with a warming alcohol note that left me wanting another one. This was a wonderful beer that was served with Kentucky Chocolate Bourbon Balls and 80% Cocoa Dark Chocolates. The Bourbon Balls melded wonderfully with the stout."
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Fully bodied and filling. Mild carbonation."
"Overall: Extremely complex, this one tasted great on a cold night. I have another bottle I'm going to let sit and try a year from now to compare."
"pretty good stout, wounder how it ages, because its under $2 a bottle here."
"05-06 edition of this beer, so it has some age to it. Pours a think black color with practically no head and very low carbonation. Mid-pour I tried to get a head going but nothing. Smell was chocolate with some roasted aromas - slightly smoky. Taste was chocolatey, with a bitter finish with some teeth in it. A really full-bodied beer that is surprisingly fairly easy to drink."
"Drinkability: After one of these, I was drowsy. That does not normally happen to me after one beer. If a half-pint were an option at this particular pub, that's what I'd order."
"An excellent beer. It's the coldest night of the year so far here in Northern Illinois. I have a nice fire going, it was my day off, and this is one fine way to spend the evening. I am looking forward to a Winter filled with beers of this style. I only hope I can match the impression this one has made on me."
"Mouthfeel is extremely rich and heavy. Thick like mud soup or my '92 Toyota Tercel's engine oil right about now after it hasn't been changed for about 6,000 miles. Just enough carbonation for this beer. This is a meal, and serves well as a desert. Hence, it isn't ridiculously drinkable but it sure is damn tasty."
"The pour into my big ol' snifter raises a one finger light brown head that recedes quickly to a surface littered with large bubbles. Lacing is thin and sudsy. The body is utterly black, even when backlit. I'll let the head retention slip by, considering the extra alcohol. The nose reeks of roast and alcohol, with strong coffee notes and subtle hints of chocolate. Seems fairly one-dimensional, though - not much depth. The taste is sweeter, more acidic, and less roasty than I expected, or what I recall from last year. It's tasty, but here too, there's no depth. It does hide the alcohol well, though. The mouth is more than medium, but not the thickest I've ever had by far. Overall, an easy drinking strong beer, but without much to call me back. I'm glad I didn't buy a case like I originally planned..."
"Had heard a lot of good things about this stout and was not dissapointed. The brew poured thick dark black and left a creamy head. First sip was sweet, followed by burnt caramel and hints of coffee. The sweetness did not let up, as the first sip's flavors stuck to the tongue. The back end provided a slightly smokey character which blended well with the high alcohol content. After 3 bottles had to switch to another another standby before tastebud destruction- too bad because it was cold outside and this stout was the perfect warmer. Overall a very tasty beer- well done."
"Found a six of this gem at our local store for $6.99, what a buy. Poured a thick motor oil black with a small mocha hue head that left no lacing. The smell of chocolate is instance, also got a nice blast of roasted malt and burnt caramel. A hint alcohol is also present. What you smell is what you taste. Robust semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor with a hint of roasted malt followed by a hint of alcohol. The texture was thick, creamy and had a soft and subtle carbonation feel. Careful, this brew packs a punch at 10.6% ABV which is well hidden. I personally drink two and move on to something different. Buy a six and enjoy, it won't disappoint."
"D: For those of you living in cold areas, this one could be good to keep around if you got snowed in. It's very warming. More than one or two could easily send someone who isnt a seasoned veteran in high ABV brews over the edge. Definitely an interesting addition to the imperial stout world."
"Even with the elevated ABV, this is much more drinkable than last year's version. In fact, I think this version is superior in every way. I'm looking forward to seeing how this one ages as I suspect it will continue to improve as it matures."
"It's a good winter brew that if you haven't tried is well worth it. I personally like the alcohol being elevated in this years offering, and due to that, will keep plenty around all winter."
"Pours a deep black with a minimal light brown head and no lacing. Smells of chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts with what was almost a smoky flavor at the finish. Nice mouthfeel, its was somewhat creamy and velvety. Good drinkability, not my favorite RIS but an enjoyable brew."
"Taste is heavenly with hints of roasted malt and semi-sweet chocolate, no cloying sweetness. Alcohol is hidden very well. Creamy lush mouthfeel with a lingering taste. Love it, this is the best BBCS I've had yet, absolutely delicious."
"Overall a very drinkable imperial. ABV is hidden well."
"Bottled in the Winter of '05-'06 so it's got a little age on it. Served slightly above room temperature, in a pint glass. Poured a deep, rich, black that no light could pass through. Had about a half inch of bubbly tan head that dissipated quickly , and left very little lace on the glass. Smelled of dark chocolates, oak, bourbon, and roasted coffee beans. Tasted heavily of chocolate/coffee with a trace of vanilla extract, and a smooth , smokey alcohol finish. A little sweet but very easy on the palate. I'd definitly get this stout again."
"Overall, quite wonderful. I bought a sixer, and I think I will have to get some more in order to make it through the winter."
"Pours opaque black with no head, and pretty much no carbonation. Smells like it should be tasty, but it just kind of underwhelms you with a dense flat unfulfilling taste, more coffee than chocolate. Certainly one is enough for me. I gave away the rest of the case."
"Overall- If you like your Stout's packed with sugar this is your cup of tea, otherwise I'll pass."
"Id highly recommend this if youre looking for a good stout with a bit of chocolate smell & flavor. If youre looking for a really chocolate flavored beer, try Youngs. Both delicious."
"Just got my first sixer of 06-07 before it was supposed to be released and I can't wait to age it a little bit to enhance all those awesome flavors"
"Overall this is my favorite offering from Brooklyn so far, I will pick it up again next release."
"I just had some from the 6 I bought back in Dec. This Stout ages VERY well. The taste was a bit mellower than before. Not as sharp as the day I got it. Smell was good. Mouthfeel was good too. A lot smoother than before. Look was the same as was the smell. I still have three left, but I'll wait a while to see how those come out."
"Winter 2005-2006 bottle pours a dark jet-black color, has a great tightly bubbled, creamy brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Sweet roasted chocolate, coffee and fruity aromas, sweet fruity plum-chocolate and coffee flavors. Nice burnt bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body with creamy and smooth, oily mouthfeel, alcohol shows as it warms, I like it."
"I would also like to see how well it ages...although I doubt these stay around long enough for anyone to ever find out."
"The taste is beautiful, huge coffee, slight nutty malt with a creamy caramel sense. all in all the only big blemish is the really slight body texture, I expect more from a Imp Stout."
"Great complex flavors here, but the alcohol overpowers sometimes. I'll have to age this for awhile and see where it goes."
"I am totally blown away by this one. Just delicious. Thanks to Ding, for allowing me to try this."
"Wow is this a thick beer! It poured very dark opaque brown from the bottle with a thick dark tan head. It smells sweet and syrupy and malty. It has a balanced flavor, starting sweet and ending with a biting kick! The head fizzled to a thin layer, never quite disappearing and leaving a beautiful lacing on the glass. Very drinkable, it went down pretty fast without really noticing quite how fast!"
"D: I'm confused as to what I should put as a score for the drinkability. Would I have another? I don't think so, but that's because it's really strong and the first was so damn good. I couldn't do much more than sip this, but it was divine. An outstanding beer."
"This beer has substance!!! Thick and chewy with an immediate plum sweetness that blossoms into an alcohol infused cocoa as it warms on the tongue. Coffee presence is apparent on the finish as is a touch of port. Better than previous years, this one is superb. I look forward to seeing how it improves with age."
"drinkability is decent. the alcohol presence is and high and overall it needs a little more time to mellow out and mesh together like the 03/04 has."
"Notes: Just a big, bad, beautiful stout. Went great with the burger I had, though I'm sure it's even better with any chocolate dessert."
"12 fl. oz. (355 ml) bottle, at The Jolly Butcher, Frederikshavn, Denmark. ""Limited bottling - Winter 05 - 06."" ABV is 8.25%. Nearly black colour, very low tan head. Vinous aroma with strong notes of dark chocolate, plums, prunes and oak. Powerful flavour of strong coffee and dark bitter chocolate. Relatively sweet. Alcohol is evident, but not dominant. A great sipping beer!"
"It's hard to hide that I'm a huge fan, so I'll admitt it, I'll have again and again and would recommend it to any fan of big stouts."
"Slàinte!"
"This is a very drinkable beer and I highly recommend this one to anybody who likes big stouts."
"Solid mouthfeel, not thick and heavy like I like my Imperial Stouts but still quite good. Carbonation is just right but the thickness is medium/full. Excellent drinkability for something so robust, complex and high in alcohol. Mm, this was heaven paired with a chocolate chip cookie from Max 'n Erma's."
"Drinkability was slow, as the alcohol hit me pretty quickly, and the beer was mighty thick. Cold, it tasted like bitter hops. As it warmed up, the lactose kicked in, but retained a strong bitterness. Most milky stouts I've had come off too sweet, but this one was like dark chocolate: thick, bitter, and black. Once fully room temperature, I could detect more sweetness, but overall, it was like a dark chocolate milkshake. Very enjoyable, and the taste of it lingers pleasantly on the tongue well after drinking it."
"This is a heavy and filling beer. Couldn't have too many of these before I'd start to feel it's effects, or fall asleep. But it's a wonderfully pleasant experience."
"Good drinkability. I'd say this one is a good desert beer."
"Try it with a brownie and some vanilla ice cream."
"Appearance is almost perfect, something that seems impossible to really attain. Pours black with a small, richly colored dark head. Smell is the only non-4.5 element. Basically ""just"" good, nothing more. Mouthfeel is rich, well done, meaty. Easy to drink this beer, very easy. Just not too many."
"d - i'm drinking this one on a very hot/humid new england late spring day. it is perfect! this is beers answer to port. a nice strong beverage that you can have as desert."
"Did a vertical this weekend, with the 05/06, 06/07 and new 07/08. The 05/06 was the most aromatic, but the consensus was the 06/07 tasted best -- there was a strong taste of black licorice in the 05/06, especially when it was cold; the 06/07 was more chocolatey; the 07/08 was bland when compared to its older brothers. . . which says a lot, as this is not a flavorless beer! The verdict/lesson: Age this for a year and then enjoy."
"D: Well certainly not a lot of chocolate taste going on. But a great stout non the less. What a wonderful winter warmer it would be considering it was this good in May."
"D: Very tastey and the alcohol is nicely hidden which means I am constantly returning to the glass for another sip. Am very glad I bought a six pack of this. I will drink it again and again and again."
"lemme put it this way: while i was drinking this beer it was just sooo sweat and soo intense that i needed a sweet oatmeal cookie to eat while iw as drinkin it to keep it in check, as it were. not that i dont enjoy the whole cookie-beer thing but i mean, cmon...this thing was just too much."
"This stout quickly moved towards the top of my list of stouts. I would definitely reccommend this beer, even to the uneducated. Next time I plan on buying a few and aging for a couple of months; I feel it can only get better with time"
"Pours a thick, totally pitch black with dirty brown foam on top, sticks around for a while. Aromas of dark fruits, alcohol, a tad bit of coffee and chocolate, but mostly roasted matliness. Flavors are dominated by a smooth and yet slightly bitterness from the chocolate malts. Chocolate flavor is subtle, but the finish is super fresh cream creamy, mmmm, lingers a while. Alcohol finishes the twang of this delectable brew, just at the end. I had one of these back in December when it was fresh, and this one has already seen some mellowing in the 5 months. One of my favorite RISs, and I was fortunate to have a friend drive a 6er of this from NY as it's not available in these parts. I will hope to save one for next year to try, but that is very unlikely."
"This one hit the spot. It's been a while since I've drank a top 100 beer. To think how low on the list this one sits and to know how good it is is mind boggling in how many exceptional beers there are."
"a toast to Ben (dv8) who left me this sample. as good as this is, I bet Valhalla's is better."
"D: Scarily drinkable beer, wish I could get more."
"Enjoy this one!"
"A rapid pour reveals a reddish tan head that rapidly fades back into the opaque black beer. Fairly complex aromas going on here. At first I get some tart tart apple then the chocolate comes thru in the background. As it warms the smell is almost like an old ale or english barley wine as I get some sweet raisiny and alcohol scents, but there is some roastiness there too that reminds me this is a stout. Tastes are heavily roasted with a little milk tanginess and more chocolate but in the background like it was in the smell. It is soft and smooth on the palate and not too thick. Overall a complex aroma and very drinkable beer."
"Sits amazingly on the tongue - a choco-lovers dream. Moderate to above-average drinkable."
"D: This one's a sipper."
"tons of chocolate in the taste. sweet sugary chocolate, then a bitter, burnt, slightly alcoholic finish with a hint of vinous dark fruits. thick, rich body. great except for the hints of soy sauce, which always put me off."
"Pours a nice dark black, very little head to speak of (might be over-chilled), but a lace of deep brown foam. Aroma is oaky and winey. Taste is a deep dark cacao/espresso flavor. Yum! A bit winey, aged fruit flavor. Very complex and delicious. Only problem with this beer is that it's discernably strong enough that I could probably only have one at a time."
"Good 12 oz package which is just enough to enjoy without wasting or getting wasted."
"The mouthfeel is thin for the style, not quite as mouth coating as I would prefer. Overall I liked it, but would take Rogue Chocoate Stout over this any day."
"Good thing Brooklyn does this around the holidays, the perfect time for something roasty, toasty, thick, warming and sweet. A real sipper. Woe be to the drinker who guzzles a couple of these in the hot July sun."
"05-06 batch. Pours a black color with just hints of brown around the top from light that is able to come through at the edges. A finger of dark tan head falls quickly to a full film over top. Nose is rather fruity, with chunky, sweet, and chewy fig aromas with a very creamy, almost cocoa chocolate. Roasted charate is very light and subdued. This one is all about the sweeter sides of the malt in a stout. Flavor starts fruity and figgy, but moves very quickly to a sweet chocolate with moderate coffee undertones and just a touch of alcohol. There is a light bitterness on the finish that helps emphasize the coffee tones. This one has definately started to chage a little since the release. I originally found it to be very fruity, but those fruit tones are now playing second string to the chocolate and coffee. I like it better. Feel is thick with a light carbonation. Its got a light slickness to it, but its not detracting. This one is as good as ever. The alcohol is only slightly noticable in the flavor, but nothing that lessens the drinkability. I wish this was easier to find."
"This offering from Brooklyn pours a onyx black with a cascading body that leaves a thick brown head that stays with the beer. The nose is so complex (alcohal, chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cool whip-mashmallow) a very sweet pleasing nose. The taste is fantastic starts with a espresso hop bitterness that is smoothed by a sweet syrup dark chocolate feel. The body is surprisingly light and drinkable but don't let that fool you cause this high ABV hits you and warms you up. Love this beer one that I come back to every winter."
"My pint was a stark black beer with a little ring of dark brown head. Not very impressive looking at all. Just a run of the mill look to it. It did have a nice floral, burnt malt smell to it. Not as fruity as it was just a sweet fragrance. The beer itself, had an awesome taste to it. Like milk chocolate, with a good hint of spicy hops. It is definitely an american version, but not over the top with the hops like some others I like much less. The beer is velvety smooth, like a chocolate shake. No hint of alcohol on it. Drinks very well. Maybe not enough complexity to drink all week, but enough good taste to keep me wanting a second."
"This is a very taste batch."
"This beer is like dessert in a glass and while incredibly smooth it is also incredibly rich and a beer that should be appreciated and savored. While this has to be one of my favorite beers right now, there is definately a time and a place for it. I can't imagine sitting around and drinking a sixer of this, though I also can't imagine ever turning down the opportunity to have one."
"Unfortunately the nice chocolate aroma is not as powerful on the palate as it is on the nose. It tastes quite vinous but is still pretty true to the style. Its good here but not great. There is a bit of a stickiness left behind which is a negative. To be expected to some degree for this style though. Its a good beer-- I dont agree with outstanding as it is labeled on the site though. There are far better RISs out there."
"the finish is a bit acidic, but not bad enough to ruin the drinkability of this fine brew."
"D: An exceptionally well-crafted imperial stout that I wish was available from fall through spring. All the aspects of the beer come together in a fashion so near perfection that it may be as close as I'll ever get to a manifestation of the concept. Highly drinkable as a sipping dessert or after-dinner beer, something to close out the last few hours of a day with."
"Thanks Bashiba for sharing this tasty treat!!!!"
"D- a very drinkable stout, however the drinkablilty is less than perfect because with 8.5% ABV more than one in a sitting is not to be recomended, this stout sneeks up on you so drink with caution."
"D - Outstanding!! Wonderful drinkability. The best RIS or Double Stout that I have ever had. Great right now!!!! Thank you xcjetta!"
"Overall, an excellent ale and extremely drinkable for an imperial stout."
"I'll be interested to see what one or two years in the cellar do for this one... updates to come!"
"Jim"
"This pours a deep rich dark brown/black color. Like a strong brewed dark roast coffee. Medium tan cap comes together a finely knit web of tiny bubbles, but does not have much retention as it dissipates quickly. However, does leave some tan lacings hanging onto the sides. Smell is of the finest dark chocolate and coffee notes. Smells sweet and rich. Taste was just as rich. Very strong chocolate and coffee flavors. Roated barley is the major theme and all the different types blend very well. Lots of bite, but still smooth. Alcohol is a little apparent, but adds a nice warming effect. Mouthfeel is full bodied with just a little carbonation to jump start the taste buds. Very drinkable stout, and think I will try one of the next bottles over a cup of ice cream!!"
"Wow what a great beer. Very drinkable and tasty, plus a steal at the $8 I paid for a six pack. As good as many stouts I normally pay double that for."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Downplayed by the intense flavors, the mouthfeel serves as a soft backdrop to the beer's character. Unassuming and soft, it allows the transgression of heavy malt and chocolate to its eventually bitter hoppy finish... this is a sipper, make no mistake. I suggest a pairing with dessert, chocolate cheescake maybe, and don't rush it. Savor every moment."
"Drinkability - better when fresh, IMO. This shows some better balance as it warms but for my palate, this beer's best days were some two years ago. 2.5"
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"This beer came from the second sixer that I bought this season. Past years have been wonderful, hopefully next year will bring this beer back to its past glories."
"Overall, quite a good stout. IMO, it would be better with a tad less roasted barley, and just a little more hop in the flavor and aroma. I'll be getting this again next year!"
"Of the winter seasonal beers that come out each year this one is one of my favorites. Pours pitch black with a small off brown tinted head. Smelled like roasted malts, lots-o-chocolate, the bittersweet kind. I picked up on a bit of smokeyness as well, but that just could have been me. Taste was amazing. I had no idea that this was an imperial stout. There is so much chocolate and creamy flavor to this beer (yet not nearly overwhelming) that it astounds the senses. Very little carbonation and lack of excessive bitterness gives this beer an amazing mouthfeel. Coating upon coating fills your mouth. This beer is incredibly drinkable. I had 2 of them and was feeling content to having a third, but then the alcohol kicked in alittle. On that note you taste none of the 8.5 percent. This beer kicked ass. If you can still get your hands on some go for it, it is well worth it."
"This is some rich and wonderful stuff. It pours pitch black with a mediocre head. It has the typical rough chocolate/coffee smell of a great RIS (ie: Stone, Victory, Yeti, Thumbsucker, etc). However, once this beer hits the lips, it is just bliss. The deeply complex, but not overwhelming chocolate taste is incredible. It reminds of the scene from the movie Old School in which the character played by Will Ferrell take a sip of his beer and yells ""it tastes so good when it hits the lips", or something like that. This beer is very full-bodied, but it is so smooth and delicious that I could keep throwing it back all night."
"This Imperial Stout reminds me a lot of the Sam Smith's version of the style. Pours pitch black, with a dark tan/brown head. The aroma smells of burnt chocolate and dried fruit. The flavor has the chocolate in attendance, but also some bubblegum and a ton of roasted malt bitterness settling on the back of the tongue. This is a very thick, substantial beer, that rubs along the mouth with a phenolic scrubbing feeling. Not a mouthfeel for the faint of heart, but that's par for the course with this style of beer. This sipping beer is a sumptuous treat that has ""dessert course"" written all over it. It's not the best exmple of the style I've had, but it's very good. Recommended."
"Nice beer to have with dessert. Couldn't 'drink a lot of these in a row, but one of them at a time with dessert is nice way to savor this beer."
"D - very tasty brew. Don't know if I could drink many of these without filling up, not to mention the alcohol content."
"Drinkability: A very good beer that lives up to the hype, and the name Black Chocolate. Thanks to Blackie for the opportunity."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. A nice after-dinner beer, but I think I can only handle one of these at a time."
"Pitch black with a medium tan head with a little bit of retention. Lots of thin webby lacing. Cooking chocolate smell with hints of alcohol. Sweet coffee malt taste with alcohol taste and thin feel. This is a huge letdown. I've been looking forward to this for quite some time. Not terrible for an RIS but not great at all."
"Winter '05-'06 bottling. Black sludge with burnt sugar tan froth, rocky and thick. Phenomenal webbed sheets of lacing. Aroma of chocolate mousse spiked with bourbon, sugared espresso with vanilla whipped cream. Oil slick texture with medium body. Incredible alcohol-infused mocha flavor, all chocolate and coffee ice cream booziness. It's nearly impossible to believe that there is no actual chocolate in this stuff. Tongue-numbing buzz. Shocking drinkability for the sheer size of the flavor profile and showy alcohol presence. The paradigm of class -- I'm in awe."
"drinkability: the alcohol taste and funny mouth tingling really impact this one, and although i will try it again, if i have the same/similar experience as i did this time, i don't think i'll want more than a sip after that. this too gets better as it warms though."
"Pure black...dark khaki head. Aroma is roasted malts, dark chocolates, nutmeg, and more chocolate. Tastes blend together fairly well on a creamy texture and create a nice warming effect as well. Fairly thick and somewhat oily. At nearly 9%, this one displays no hint of alcohol in the taste. A rich, flavorful stout that deserves to be mentioned with some of the best. Definitely one to drink at room temp..or hell, leave it out in the sun for a while. I tried this around fridge temp to start and it was a disaster..the flavors wake up and start to party at 60 degrees.. It's a no-brainer to try this one if you find it."
"05-06. Pours black with large creamy tan head, that gradually fades to a cover, nice lacing. Aroma is a simple blend of chocolate and roasted notes. Inital flavor has some bitter coffee and dark chocolate, this gives way to a sweet chocolates and some dark fruits. Texture is a bit on the syrupy side. A touch of warming alcohol in the finish."
"a solid 4 across the board which = damn good beer. For my personal taste I would go elsewhere for my imp stout fix but that is because I prefer coffee over chocolate... starbucks over godiva... mariah over naomi.. ok, I'll stop..."
"One of my favorite brews. Lovely, dark cola color with hints of copper.Thick head. Aroma is sweet, almost woody, with hint of caramel, figs. Malty, full-bodied, with a nice long finish. I recommend serving it slightly chilled in a large wine glass or snifter -- it holds the aroma nicely."
"D - Taste and mouthfeel make this a highly drinkable brew. They got the sweetness just right. You could drink this beer while eating a desert. It would stand up to chocolate cake."
"Seems far less alcoholic than last years. This is one huge malty beer...an excellent and mighty Imperial Stout."
"I could easily drink a few of these on a cold winter night. And I'd get a nice buzz with the 8.5% abv. And I'd like it. I love this stuff."
"Overall a fantastic brew that I plan on having again."
"Pours an opaque pitch black. Not a ray of light is getting through this baby. Nice tan colored head with some retention. And chocolate lacing covers the entire glass. Smell is of chocolate covered cherries and a faint alcohol smell. Taste is sweet chocolate up front, roasted coffee tasting malts through the middle, with a warming alcohol finish. Feels crisp and thick in the mouth with a nice alcohol tingle on the sides of the tongue. This is definately a sipping beer. The alcohol is very noticable but not so much so that the beer is undesireable. Overall a good beer from Brooklyn and I'm starting to like this style more."
"Brooklyn Black is a very intense, tasty stout. Ultimately, the fact that it's a rather expensive seasonal brew works against it. Mackeson's is the ""lite"" version of this beer to me, and is available year round at half the price. Rogue Chocolate has a much more pleasing chocolate hit. I won't be buying this regularly, but by all means, try this if you like Imperial Stouts."
"I wish I could drink these all the time."
"Body is full, but not huge. Mouthfeel is like liquid silk with a creamy, slippery texture that is a joy to roll around your tongue. Infinately drinkable, a great food and dessert beer, and something I look forward to every year."
"Had this on tap at Summits in Sandy Springs, GA. It pours into the glass a very dark brown with a brown head that quickly fades. It has a deep rich smell that is dominated by chocolate and port-like aromas. The mouthfeel is heavy and flat, you know its in there. The taste is powerful and is dominated by chocolate with an ""on again - off again"" hoppyness to it. You can taste the presence of the alcohol, it comes off almost tasting like there is a shot of bourbon in the beer. Very interesting stout, I'm defiantly going to keep drinking this one."
"Winter '05-'06 edition."
"Damn fine beer, Brooklyn has another winner. No surprise there."
"D- This beer is a nice stout with good complexity. It had nice depth in the malt and it was nice to taste some bitter hops to support the malt. Some imperial stouts tend to get thin or watery but this is big and hefty."
"This beer poured a beautiful jet black into my imperial pint glass, with a 1/4 inch tan head that never went away. The beer was totally opaque and I could not shine a light through it, basically the way a double/imperial stout should be. The aroma was of espresso, licorice, dark fruits, currant. The taste was very warming and complex, with notes of toffee, molasses and even a hint of dark rum. This brew was perfect for a cold evening in the NC mountains. The reason I scored the drinkability only slightly above average is because this beer is not for the faint of palate. At times I felt like I was drinking a mixed drink instead of a beer. I kept tasting dark rum and molasses, but I guess that's just me. I'll definitely buy me another six pack of this stuff to see how it changes after a year or two."
"Outstanding."
"Very full and satisfyingly chewy mouthfeel. Great drinkability for such a beer."
"This beer is thick!!. May be the thickest I've had. It pours out the color of used oil. It had a minimal head on it that was tan in color. The smell is like a shot of whiskey with chocolate notes. The taste is upfront alcohol. Not subtle at all. The rubust alcohol almost overuns the chocolate flavor but you can pick it up a little. The mouthfeel powerfull at first then fades to a good whiskey like aftertaste. I could drink these again. I would not drink these in session. A good beer no doubt."
"mouthfeel. Very good stuff !"
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle of the Winter 2005-2006 edition for this beer. Black as black can be with a rich brown head about an inch thick after pouring. Very nice lacing around the glass. Deep and dark roasted malts, with strong whiffs of chocolate and coffee (you know, the kind you can dissolve a spoon in). Not as bitter or acidic as I was expecting though, which was a very good thing. Yet, there is a subtle harshness that transcends into the alcoholic warmth of the brew. Creamy after creamy sip hits you right at the back of the throat to let you know there's alcohol in this one. As for drinkability, this is clearly a sipping beer, one to be enjoyed sitting on the deck with your friends."
"Excellent appearance and smell -- coffee, chocolate, smokey roasts. PITCH BLACK color with a slight head. Great lacing on the pint glass I drank it from. STRONG, bitter taste. A nice beer to drink slowly and steadily. Couldn't do more than one or two of these in one sitting. Glad I tried it."
"been wanting to try this for a while...had a 6 pack in my hand in rehoboth beach last summer but i think i had already bought about 1000 dollars worth of beer on that trip so i put it back"
"Sampled the '05-'06 vintage. Dark black color with very little head or carbonation. The aroma is amazing; a chocolate/coffee blend. Taste is also mind-blowing. Very complex flavor; again dominated by the taste of chocolate and espresso, with just the right amount of alcohol. Goes down very smoothly for 8.5%. One of the best stouts I've ever had the pleasure of trying."
"Pours a pretty opaque black, some red on the edges, thick tan head, good retention and some nice lace. Smell is fucking powerful, cherries, coffee, chocolate, some alcohol, insane roast. Taste is some sour cherries up front, which disappears by the end of the glass, roasted coffee and chocolate, some alcohol, and a roasty chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was medium to thick bodied, with medium carbonation, lots of alcohol warming. The alcohol is a little hot but otherwise really nice. Thanks DrJay!"
"Pours opaque, black and thick looking, with a thinnish dark tan head that quickly fizzes away into nothingness. The aroma is surprisingly sweet and chocolatey -- it's amazing that they can accomplish this with malts alone! Flavors hits with a huge roasted malt flavor right from the start. It becomes a bit sweeter mid-palate, with something of a milky texture on the tongue, and finally blends (ever-so-smoothly) into a roasty and moderately hopped finish, leaving a nice tingly feeling on the tongue. Subtle in its graduations of flavor, this is a surprisingly complex beer that has stood the test of time well, without sacrificing anything in the way of drinkability. Yummy."
"12 oz bottle At The Washington House tasting Poured a thick black with red tints. Had a dark head. Aroma of malty chocolate, carmel and raisins. Taste is pretty smooth with slight sweet finish. A very good stout. I like the Brooklyn products and this is one of there best."
"Sticky mouthfeel. Cloying as well. Drinkability is a hard one for me to decide on. I think this one missed the mark a bit overall."
"The beer pours a dark opaque black with a huge dark tan head. The head doesn't hold too well or lace too well but it is a nice looking beer. The beer smells of roasted dark chocolate malts. And that is the taste also. There is also a significant dryness attched to the beer. There is a fantastic thickness with a good carbonation. Overall this is definitely a beer that I would love to have every year during the winter."
"'05-'06: Black beer with a mocha head composed of fine bubbles. Extended, spotty lacing and good retention. Roasty, dark chocolate aroma, a bit of nuttiness and significant alcohol. Bitter chocolate flavour throughout, with plenty of malt sweetness and roast. Plenty of bitterness, which lingers into the finish along with the chocolate character and a mild cherry flavour. Silky texture with a roasted dryness and fine carbonation. It had a fair bit of alcohol warmth in the finish. Quite tasty overall and it would go great with dessert."
"Pours a deep dark black topped by about one finger of creamy brown head that clings nicely to the glass. Rich aroma of dark, earthy malt, with notes of peat, dark chocolate, and soy sauce. Palate up front is an odd, slightly unpleasant blend of soy sauce and dark chocolate. A transition to rich sweetness comes next, with notes of milk chocolate and prunes coming out. Finish is rich and chocolatey, with nice warming from the alcohol. Body is thick, smooth, rich, creamy, and as close to perfect as you can get. An enjoyable, if strange, experience. Perhaps my bottle was a bit lightstruck."
"Glad I got to try this one, as it's not available locally. Great winter warmer."
"Drinkability:The alcohol conent of this make it a sipper. Make it the last one of the night and savor it."
"Drinkability- A delicious dessert brew."
"Outstanding! I can't wait for the winter months to roll around each year so I can get myself a case of this to savor. As black and opaque as possible when put up to light, its appearance has a light brown head that follows the pour and gives great lacing. It has a strong aroma of coffee and deeply roasted malts. The flavor follows that up with more coffee, roasted and burnt notes and also has a very strong hoppiness. A tiny taste of alcohol is there too. The beer feels like oil in your mouth with carbonation that compliments it perfectly. Overall, this is probably the best beer I have ever had and it is an absolute must for anyone that likes craft beers!"
"D - Beer really needs a little while to mellow out. Had last years recently and it was unbelievable. I will buy some more and let that cellar for some time. Hopefully I will be able to find a place that has a couple of last years sitting around. If not, just need to find other beers to drink before this one is ready. Definitely buy it if you see it though."
"Lightless jet with a creamy brown (not beige) head, minimal lacing. I haven't seen dirty oil this dark, just a perfect color in the snifter. Nose is roasted malt and dark chocolate with a touch of alcohol, not sure if this is a desert or digestif, we'll see from the taste. Slick entrance of malt, hops coming out to bitter the edges, and the chocolate, seeming both milk and semi-sweet blend it all together. This is an exceptional brew. Mouthfeel is creamier than chocolate cream. Too easy to quaff for the style and ABV. This is the 05-06 version. A pure winner. Get it. Love it. Wrap it in a heart shape box and give it to your significant other on Valentine's Day. Better than chocolate."
"Special thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the opportunity to enjoy this masterpiece."
"Exceptional Imperial, and another classic from Brooklyn Brewery."
"D - It is a bit rich, but I had no trouble finishing it. This is easily my favorite stout to date."
"Pours almost like motor oil. This beer is the darkest of my experience.Head did not last long,nice lacing. Smell is of chocolate and malt. Very inviting! Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Taste is unique. Chocolate,malt,coffee. To sum this beer up....Wow!"
"mouthfeel is very thick. almost syrupy but very good. an ideal stout for those looking for the more chocolate taste as opposed to the coffee flavors of other stouts. very heavy."
"D: Very tasty RIS from Brooklyn. I've had it on tap and in the bottle seems to allow the flavors to come out and breath a bit. Not that it's bad on tap, because it's great, the bottle just allows you more reoom to breath. Also, at room temp is obviously better than chilled."
" Yeah, you can see you're in the presence of royalty here. I never really thought I'd see a serious competitor to Youngs Double but Brookyln definitely does the borough proud with this offering. If you haven't had it, go get some.."
"D - This is a fantastic and very satisfying beer -- without a doubt one of the best in the Brooklyn stable. What it lacks in taste and smell complexity (which isn't that much at all) it makes up for in superb look and feel. This beer should be a definite inclusion in everyone's winter beer stash."
"Cheers!"
"D- Drinkability is high becuase the alcohol isn't too much and the chocolate isn't too sweet and overbearing. Very Very nice combination and balance of flavors"
" I would say this is a fairly full bodied stout, with great characteristics. Will drink again for sure."
"When I first poured this beer, I could smell the chocolate and heavily roasted malts from across the room. The appearance was an opaque black with an inch of creamy head. The smell is indicative of the taste, as this is one is all semisweet chocolate and malts. This is a fantastic brew, but the mouth feel is heavy, as if I was drinking chocolate milk. I've never been a big fan of Brooklyn Brewery, well until now that is."
"Yum. Great aroma of molasses and chocolate. A very creamy head that lasted a long time with great lacing. Black color, of course. There is a moderately acidic intial flavor that lessens a bit. Palate is medium-full, syrupy with a moderate alcoholic finish. Finish is loooong. Can't wait to see what a year in the cellar will do for this. This is really an outstanding double stout. Probably my favorite Brooklyn beer in the bottle."
"The taste at first is smooth and infinitely deep. There is a soily earthy quality to the middle, with some smoked/roasted malts and flavoring hops. The end game is all about alcohol, moderate bittering hops as well, and a smooth, mocha breadiness. I searched ans searched for more chocolate flavor, based upon the brewers claims of chocolate taste, but I could not find it. I ended up saying, who cares this was smooth and completely drinkable, chocolate or not."
"Notes: Looks great, smells great, tastes great. I highly recommend this stout, it is one of the best."
"I wanted to rate this lower, but just couldn't bring myself to do it. Not at all the beer I remember from years past and certainly not a Black Chocolate Stout. Pours pitch black with a brownish rim and absolutely no head. Had to really concentrate to get any aroma at all, and I still can't place what it is. Finally, this beer has a metallic taste; like I was drinking nickels or something. I'm curious to try it again, because this is a beer I used to like, say four-to-five years ago; but I was completely unimpressed this time."
"pitch black with an inviting creamy tan head. Smells of licorice, coffee, chocolate, deep, malty and slightly bitter. Smooth silky mouthfeel. Tastes of coffee, black roasted malts and hints of alcohol. A deep inviting beer that improvede as it warmed with more alcohol aromas and flavors of tobacco, raisin & toast. A very nice beer indeed."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a stout. A very sensual beer that is satisfying in all respects. Despite not being a stout connoisseur, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"This pours a jet black with a large creamy tan head.This is one beautiful beer.The smell is chocolate,but it's not too strong.The taste is a very strong chocolate with some coffee and malt.There is alittle alcohol warmth,but not much.The m/f is heavy and creamy.This is a well balanced beer with all flavors mixing well.This is a very good beer,not great,but very good.Every Christmas I will look forward to this coming out."
"cheers..."
"Finally had this on nitrous draft at Cafe Luna in Simsbury, CT (see seperate review--great job Louis!). WOW!! While I have always enjoyed this one from the bottle, the draft version is almost PERFECT. The coffee and chocolate flavor is very much pronounced, but not overwhelming. While the bottle version ""hides"" the high ABV; the draft is even more dangerous, as you cannot really feel the alcohol until afterwards. The carbonation is very soft. A really outstanding brew, served at the right temp at Cafe Luna. By the way, the pizza here is VERY, VERY good!! Mangia."
"Very strong tastes. Chocolate and rich coffee taste along with raosted malts in this heavy stout. Syrup like body that goes down very smoothly. There are sweet tastes of raisins. The hops are fairly tasty and add to this complex brew. As this goes down there is a warming feeling but the alcohol is hidden well. I would like to try this beer again in a year or so as it could only get better. Very good beer and it follows with a well rounded aftertaste of darker malts."
"Notes: Easily at the top of my list for not only stouts, but beers in general. Great with deserts, oh my... what it must be to enjoy this with a hunk of chocolate mousse. Death by chocolate... no, death by Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout. I give a 4.0 to drinkability for I am a chocolate and stout lover, so the combination of the two makes me believe I could drink a few of these, and there isn't an alcohol presence (even at 8.5%) that turns me away. A great, amazing, brew."
" As I said, this one goes down smooth, so be careful. Sorry to be so succinct; just try it if you haven't."
"Very highly recommended!"
"This is a tasty beer. It took me a few to get acquainted with it, but in the end, very good. I like. I recommend. And it was good with Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, too. It's so rich that I can't give it very high marks for drinkability, but one is certainly good."
"D: I remembered this being so much better. Still a good beer though and at a good price."
"Rich, full flavored brew, just doesn't seem well rounded enough for several."
"The bitterness is present a bit during tastings, swishings, and in between sips. It's more than balanced by the full melody of flavors, and this beer is very difficult to chug down due to it's richness and warmth. Brooklyn Brewery shouuld be commended for a concoction that is worth looking forward to during the winter, and worth savoring during the cold nights of the season. A must-have for the stout enthusiast!"
"Have the 2005  06 version from the variety pack. Brew pours to a pitch-black color, not much if any light coming through this brew. Has a medium sized dark brown head that has fair retention and leaves quite a bit of lace around the top half of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, charcoal, black/burnt malts and dark fruits are highly noticeable. Taste is of dark malts, chocolate, slight alcohol burn mixed in a very dry feel. Very nice tasting brew, good drinkability even with the 8.5% ABV. This is the first time I have had it in bottles and I think I like it better than on tap. Will allow the other one I have from the pack age and then re-review."
"Another solid beer from the Brooklyn Brewery. This is pretty much your textbook stout, fits the style perfectly, but yet has it's own personality. Blackish brown color, little to no head though. I love to smell paint in a beer, and I smell it in this one. Nice. There's also a ton of roasted barley and chocolate malt scents combining with hints of dark cherries and raisins. Taste is very delicate and desert-like. So sweet, with a nice chocolate quality stepping up to the plate, but not dominting the whole beer. Richly complex. I can definately taste the ""double"" in this double chocolate stout. A nice kick of warming alcohol as it goes down the throat, but not really detectable in the taste. Velvety smooth creamy mouthfeel, excellent. I've had this one on draft too which gives it a little more carbonation, which might slightly edge out this bottled version. Either way, this is a sturdy beer that would be pretty hard for any beer drinker to find fault in. Good stuff."
"You can definitely taste the alcohol, but it is masked well with a good balance of ingredients and tastes. It finishes smooth and defintiely warms you up. Brooklyn, I'm impressed."
"Overall i had waited for this brew and the wait was well worth it. A damn fine brew from brooklyn that i will find myself going back to when i need a lil break from the doubles"
"highly recommended indeed!"
"Overall, the 2005 release is an amazing beer, and an excellent showing from Brooklyn Brewery. A major improvement over last year's version, if you tried that."
"SMD"
"This is one hell of a delicious pounder. Big, dark flavors, fruity, chocolatey, malty, with a good alcohol kick. Highly recommended."
"Winter '05 batch. Pours pitch black, with ruby highlights. Light brown three finger head, dense and bubbly. Outstanding retention and patchy lacing. Dark fruit alcohol vapors and burnt malt hide a gentle hop aroma. Sweet roasted barley and chocolate malts make up a bittersweet and well rounded flavor, and american hops dry the aftertaste to improve the balance. Full thick body and low carbonation keep the big flavor velvet smooth. Alcohol becomes evident in the finish, but never harsh. Residual, intoxicating, and very satisfying."
"Pours a jet black - no light coming through at all, with a brown 2 finger head and great lace. Smells of deeply roasted malt with coffee and chocolate aromas. A bit smokey. Initial taste is of chocolate, then some roastyness then some bittersweet. I also detect coffee, but not a great amount of coffee bitterness. Nicely balanced. A rich and creamy mouthfeel and this one although very drinkable is a definate sipper."
"Aroma has notes of chocolate, expresso, blackstrap molasses, ethanol, and some floral hops. The flavor is impressive, big chocolate and coffee notes as well as some blackstrap molasses that is checked by some floral and mineraly hops bitterness, as well as tobacco and a smokey character. The finish has notes of cherry brandy with a mild alcohol character. The mouthfeel is rich and full without being overbearing and drinkability is surprisingly good for a double stout. An incredible beer, one of the best double stouts out there."
"From the winter '05-'06 bottling"
"Notes: I am going to cellar a couple of these boys to drink later and see if it mellows out a bit."
"Drinkability: This is good, but I think I'll toss it in the cellar; see if a little age will benefit this brew."
"Recommended. This is very good stuff."
"Moderately drinkable... the more I drink of this bottle, the more I want to keep drinking it. Dangerously addicting, although I certainly would not have thought so upon my first sip."
"An absolutely superb imperial stout."
"A good stout, but not really at the level of others."
"This is a powerful beer. I dont think I'd really want to have more than 1 or 2 at a time. I appreciated this beer, and thought it was high quality, but imperial stouts arent really my thing, so I dont know if I'll be buying this again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a very easy to drink beer. Carbonation is minimal. One of the very smoothest stouts I have had the pleasure to drink. I am curious how this will age."
"[Many thanks to rapopoda for hand carrying this prize out to wine country]"
"Drinkability: a good beer that I'm glad I had the opportunity to try"
"Grabbed a 6er of this the other night. This beer sort of confuses me. the bottle says it's a chocolate stout, BA calls it a double stout, the brewery calls it an imperial stout...which is it? I don't know, possibly a combo of all three. The appearance is pitch black with a medium brown head that doesnt stick too much. Body is medium to heavy with smells of fudge-like chocolate,espresso and hint of rum. The taste is mildly hoppy with a bit of roasted bitterness showing up towards the end. When i first sipped this beer, i wasn't too impressed, but the more i drank, the more i liked. Definetly a beer worth trying. On a side note, I used this beer to make the basic beer bread listed in the recipes section of this site, and i have to say that it was a great choice. the chocolate compliments it perfectly. Cheers"
"overall: this is an excellent chocolate stout that only uses malts to achieve the flavor. good impy stout with good carbonation. this stout seems to vary a bit from year to year. i liked last year's vintage and this year's just as good. if you see this limited bottling where you shop, pick up a ton to have year round."
"John"
"d: very filling, and the bold flavors dont leave the palate capable of much else, including another one. though since thats all Im looking for, and how I feel a stout like this should be....its all good to me."
"Poured a viscous, night-black color with a soft and dissipating mocha-colored head that leaves behind plenty of lacing. The surface is racked with large bubbles and the carbonation seems low-medium. I smell loads of mocha, nuts, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, smoke, and burnt wood. The taste resembles the aromas and is great with a thick, bready aftertaste. Full-bodied and complex but all the elements seem to come together and compliment one another. Hints of smoke and burnt wood add great depth and balance the sweetness of the beer. Chocolate ice cream with a touch of syrup is how this feels in my mouth; smooth and creamy. Warming alcohol sensation after a few sips with a semi-dry finish. Overall, this beer is sheer perfection; everything I could want in a RIS...just amazing! Great with a chocolate or cream based dessert or by itself in the winter months."
"The Black Chocolate Stout offering from Brooklyn Brewery for the 2005-2006 winter continues a great tradition from this New York Micro. The pour of this ebony stout is the picture of color for a black chocolate stout. The head that forms on the glass is a deep brown that starts strong and fades as the beer sits. The smell has a very malty nose with toasted overtones and a distinct alcohol aroma form the multiple mashing. The taste is bold with a roasted flavor up front fading into a chocolate undertone with distinct alcohol warmth. The selection of hops are ideal for this brew as they do not pronounce themselves in the taste or the aftertaste but keep the sweetness of the beer at a superb balance. This beer has a full-bodied texture that is smooth and satiny. This beer is a great drink to relax and unwind with as the days begin to cool and winter sets in. At over 8% ABV, this is definitely not a session beer; but with a beer such as this, it is difficult to refuse a second."
"Pours as dark as night with a nice inch thick tan head. Roasted Coffee, Dark Chocolate, Slight Mollases, and very sweet alcohol aromas are present. Dark chocolate and black coffee flavors hit my tongue with an warm finish. This is a big tasting beer! I drank my first with a peice of chocolate cake and it really complimented well. Great beer overall. It's a nice treat."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer at an afforable price. I got a six-pack of vintage Black Chocolate Stout for only $7.99. Due to the thickness of this beer, it's good once in a while, not really an everyday drink. If you see this beer, GET IT! You won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability is pure peace of heaven here. The only fault here is that the smell could be a bit more complex but it is debatable that it is not possible in a brew this strong. I have found a new favorite beer after drinking this. Now I just have to figure out how to get some more in California!"
"I found this to be a wonderful beer to sip away at while keeping an eye on the football scores. Highly recommended."
"I will definately buy this beer again, it's the type of beer that for me, a 6 pack will last a little while. Very enjoyable, but I would probably only have 1 or 2 of these in one setting. 6.99 wasn't that bad though for a beer like this, considering that Guiness costs over $8 for 6 beers. The only problem I have with it is it doesn't maintain much of a head."
"just came back to this beer after 30 odd minutes the noose got stronger but hte palate definitly fell apart. this beer works much better as a two year old"
"Pours black as expected with a thin head. Looks tasty. Smell is chocolate/coffee and tons of toasted malt with a slight alcohol overtone. Taste has a strong chocolate edge as expected with a mocha feel to it. Very smooth and creamy on the tongue with a noticable alcohol warming on the way down. Strong brew that lives up to expectations. Highly recommended."
"This was a nice experience. I was happy I had chosen this even though it was a little early in the year for me to indulge in an imperial stout. The color was black as pitch although the head was not very impressive. It did lace down the side of the glass nicely though. The smell was, as is to be expected, that of chocolate, coffee, sweet brown notes of all varieties as well as burnt and toasted malt. Yum! The taste pulled through with all the flavor the smell let on. The carbonation was a little low but this stout went down easy. Give it a spin if you have the chance."
"I wish I had a case of this ! Very nice. . ."
"Poured an opaque color with a large (I underestimated and overflowed the glass) very dark tan head and nice lacing. Sweet, slightly roasty chocolate aroma with a hint of alcohol. Smooth creamy texture with a thick chocolate taste. Leaves a slight twang on the tip of your tongue. Head lasts throughout."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer with a rich and toasty smooth flavor. It is well balanced without any alcohol flavor that I could taste. Slightly warming. Definatley a dessert beer unless you eat chocolate cake for dinner."
"Drinkability- So glad I still have one of these left. Think I will toss it in the cellar and forget about it for a year or two. Can't imagine it getting much better than it already is, but what if it does?"
"Overall, an excellent beer."
"This beer is one for sipping, it's alright but nothing spectacular."
"Beer is good. Happy dark, chocolatey, stouty beering."
"Quite an experience with my first Brooklyn Brewery beer. Pours intensely dark (motor oil darkness) with a large dark tan head that holds longer than I thought it would. Aroma is of dark chocolate, roasted grains, and a little fruit like whole strawberries. Taste has a really strong deep dark Belgian chocolate flavor. Quite nice. Espresso looms large and so does a roasted nut flavor. Sharp acidic twang toward the finish. Body is lucious and thick. Almost Expedition levels. Alcohol is well hidden but I'm still surprised it doesn't reach the double digits with the warming sensations and thickness of this beer. With about 4 ounces left I brought out the Ben and Jerry's Vanilla Ice Cream and these two matched beautifully. Really a great accompaniment to dessert. Great beer all around."
"The bonus, the first stout I'll give a 5 for drinkability. This would be a beer I could enjoy with food, with good friends, over a good video , anything. Highly reccommended when it's available. It doesn't suffer from the ""bottled stout"" syndrome. The flavors are fresh tasting as any. I want to sample other Brooklyn beers now. Bravo."
"The smell is very good, with chocolate highlighting the dark malt base. The taste is chocolate up front, then malt takes over, while chocolate and hops take over the finish. The mouthfeel is strong and appealing while the drinkability is good for the strong content."
"Overall a great version of a style that sometimes tends to be a bit heavy-handed. I drank this at cellar temp. which seemed to me very fitting for this ale. Would gladly incorporate this into my winter repretoire. Great stout from a great brewery."
"Pours a deep black color-Theres no way any light is getting thru this sucker. Small head and a slight trace of lacing. Low aroma-slight licorice and roasted malt comes thu for the most part. Big roasted malt flavor. Nice grainy and burnt flavor. Hints of anise,licorice and treacle. Very slight trace of sweetness. Nice body-very full and quite bold. A freakin killer beer. One of the best going. Whether its your first or last of the day-impressive all over!"
"Pours like some kind of motor oil. Really dark and viscous. Thick mouthfeel, definitely a plus. Dark chocolate and espresso notes combine to make a really tasty beer. An extremely drinkable beer for the amount of alcohol, but 8.5% probably makes this a nightcap kind of a beer for me. Gave a couple of these away but the rest of the six pack isn't going to last very long."
"Thanks to HardTarget for this most excellent treat."
"Had this with vanilla ice cream. Yes yes."
"D&N: No doubt about it, this is a big beer. A bit stronger (alcohol wise) than I'd expect, so no drinking a few of these, one is quite enough, but I'm really enjoying it."
"Smooth as hell. Thick and creamy, this one eats other stouts. Very drinkable even at the high alcohol, it's hidden so well. Delicious to say the very least."
"The taste is incredible. It is very powerful and I assume as this was cellared well for five years it has blended and mellowed. This is a wonderful beer and if you can find it - buy it."
"My only sidenote would be that this is a one-pint beer for me. It's so good you want to drink it slowly and savor it. I'll stick to other beers for multiples."
"poured a black color with tannish head. The smell is roasty with distinct chocolate overtones. (Dove dark chocolate??). taste is as of a stout with chocolate ine the back of the mouth, leavinfg an enjoyable mouthfeel. 8.5% tells me one is enough. A truly enjoyable beer."
"One of my favorites."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer, and I'd recommend it without reservation. Perhaps not more than one, however. Just getting through one has left me sated...it's like a good meal."
"Only my second brew from Brooklyn...glad to see my selection getting better."
"Drinkability: This is so rich and alcohol-laden that it is hard to drink the whole bottle. Forget about a second."
"A number of words could be used to describe this truly outstanding beer  rich, robust, delicious, complex, earthy, etc., - but I think one simple word does it best: amazing. Easily my favorite stout, but also one of the best out of all the beers Ive ever tasted, regardless of style. The one very minor drawback, IMHO, is that its richness makes it somewhat difficult to finish off more than one or two of these at a time (I been drinking the same glass of this stout for almost a half-hour and Im still not done!), not to mention its alcohol kick (an 8.5% hammer). But, overall, no serious craft beer drinker can afford to not try this one. Highly, highly recommended!!"
"Quite good, and that's coming from a guy that doesn't usually like specialty beers."
"Appearance: Black with tiny tiny little carbonation bubbles that run up the side of the glass. Small head that dissipates to a nice frothy/creamy, tanish brown covering with great lacing. Smell: Just great. Lots of chocolate malts with hints of coffee and I can smell the alcohol just a tad. Taste: Bitter and sweet. Taste like espresso beans with unsweetened chocolate liquor. A roasted flavor is present that I just can't quite figure out, but it is good. Mouthfeel: Creamy Drinkability: I will definately be drinking this one again, especially considering I have 3/4 case in the basement."
"Drinkability: I tried to slowly enjoy this bottle but ended up plowing through the glass in a matter of minutes. One of the best beers Ive been introduced to this year! I highly recommend seeking out a bottle of this. It is truly remarkable."
"Opaque black, with red highlights, and a reddish brown head that quickly dissappeared. The aroma is full of roasted, coffee, nutty oak, caramel, hintsof chocolate and an almost sherry like aroma as it warms. The taste is smooth roasted malt with solid bitterness and a lingering chocolate finish. This beer isn't dry, but rather it's sweet and warming. An obviously well made beer, surprisingly on the light side of the style, but so well balanced that it will shine over it's alcohol laen peers."
"This beer pours nice and dark. A thick tan foamy head forms and lasts for a relatively long time. The smell is firstly of wonderful chocolate roasted malts. But then slight hints of alcohol start to come through the malt and chocolate aroma. The taste follows a similar pattern: thick, chocolate and malty, very slight tinge of alcohol. This is definitely far better than average, and certainly worth trying. This should be searched out and savored. This is a fine beer which continues to grow on my palate. Enjoy."
"Final Notes - There is no reason not to try this beer and I very much enjoyed it. However, other imperial stouts are better, however, in particular I would recommend Weyerbacher's Heresy."
"Cheers."
"This one is nearly on my top shelf."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black stout with dark brown foamy head with medium retention. Aroma is comprised of chocolate with strong malt and some subtle coffee in the back. Taste is very enjoyable with some chocolate being easily noticeable with again strong malt and a coffee and bitter ending. Very fine beer for those last cold winter days"
"Pours a jet black with a two fingers of a thick beige head. Wonderful smell of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste starts off sweet and chocolaty, but finishes with a nice bitterness and a warming hint of alcohol. Beer is smooth from start to finish. Overall, a tremendous chocolate stout."
"Final Thought: As you let this beer settle you notice a remarkable taste change... it's up there for stouts, period!"
"This was mighty, heavy and long lasting. Took me over an hour to finish one bottle and i could match this up with any chocolate dessert anytime. 4 bottles will be laid down until next year, just wait and see ;)"
"This is a great stout. The appearance is black as night, and it smells of coffee and toffee. The taste also hints of dark roast coffee, as well as dark chocolate. The feel on the mouth is smooth. Really interesting, complex malt flavors. I found out after tasting that it is 8.5 ABV, and this also surprised me. The alcohol doesn't overpower the great flavors, and it could even be a good session brew. I very much enjoy this beer. A very good interpretation of a stout with chocolate malts- Very good, and worth a try!"
"Note: I drank this one after seeing Soulfly and Morbid Angel in Cleveland, so that made it THAT much better!"
"Pours pitch black with a thick coffee colored head. Loads of coffee and chocolate in the aroma, along with some alcohol. Tastes of roasted espresso and dark chocolate with some alcohol warmth in the background. There is a slightly hoppy aftertaste before the hops are overwhelmed by the coffee flavors. Thick and syrupy, this is a very nice beer! The only knock against it's drinkability is that it would be pretty hard to drink more than a couple in one night!"
"I love an imperial stout, and this one at first glance and whiff appeared to be a winner. Very dark with a creamy looking tannish head. Aroma of soft chocolates, dried beef, and roasted nuts had my mouth watering. Carbonation was too low in my estimation, and the flavor, while rich with chocolate malts, was too sweet and the texture too thin for an imperial stout. Also, a very strong taste of alcohol was always present, not something I like in a beer. Nasty aftertaste as well. For all its reputation, this brewery should be putting out better beers."
"Overall: Very good. I am not a big chocolate stout drinker, but this was pretty tasty. Pretty drinkable. Definately recommended."
"This is a surprisingly drinkable beer, and a beer that I'm sure would age well...if only you could keep yourself from drinking it. Try it warm."
"If you can get your hands on some of this, give it a try. Black Chocolate Stout is just plain good."
"Very deep black color with a thin tan head. The snifter glass I poured the beer into usually encourages foam development, so I was surprised by the how thin this was. The nose has deep chocolate and roast malt character with a hint of hard candy, and some alcohol hints on the finish. A light ring of lace develops as the head settles into the beer. Great chocolate richness up front in the flavor with more of an alcohol warming than I sense in other chocolate stouts. The hop lends an almost minty character to the flavor, amazing. Nice, velvety mouth feel and a good drinakbility. This may be the signature version of this style. Great job Garrett."
"Lookin' good, boys. Nice black pour with a thick tan head that hangs around for a few minutes. Burnt malt, chocolate, coffee beans, and some fruity sweetness are all in the aroma. The taste has a lot of dark chocolate, but there's also lots of coffee flavors and burnt malt in there as well. Thick chewy mouthfeel complements the big flavor nicely. Drinkability is not so great. The beer is tasty, don't get me wrong, but I had a hard time finishing the whole bottle. I'd almost like to get this one in a 7 oz. nip so the sweetness wouldn't knock me around quite so much."
"Now if I could actually get this at the store down here instead of making a 6 hour round trip to Virginia. You would think that NC would be a bit more lenient..."
"***Update*** (2/10/06) - I brought down the Smell and Mouthfeel each by 0.5. I just tried it again and it really just leaves a very bitter finish. A little tough to drink, but it still tastes pretty darn good."
"Very thick pour with a nice black body and caramel head with decent retention. Nice roasty, fruity aroma with a hint that you're really going to taste the high alcohol. Couldn't be farther from the truth. Very smooth mouthfeel and an unbelievable chocolate flavor that all but hides the alcohol. Very drinkable for such a seemingly heavy beer. Slightly bitter with a pleasant complex after taste. Definitely in my top ten!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad beer, but can't hold a candle to Rogue Chocolate Stout. I enjoyed it, that's for sure, but probably couldn't enjoy another one. This is a beer you have to be in the mood for."
"This is the 2004-05 edition. Pours a typically black body, with a nice dark, caramel head, reasonable retention. There's a wonderful sweet aroma, tons of chocolate. Also some fruitiness. The taste is awesome. For as sweet as this is, it isn't overbearing, and the high alcohol doesn't make an appearance in the mouth, what a delight. The mocha taste in this is really good, and just a hint of bitterness to give some balance. I could drink these all night."
"A pitch black stout with a wonderful coffee colour head. Smells of rich quality chocolate. Taste of course is choclate too. But a little bit too much alcohol burn in it. Its pretty easy drinking but you can really tell you get a little extra in this beer. The alcohol is a little too close to the surface. I prefer it felt but not tasted. This is however a pretty good stout with a rich chocolate taste and only the aftertaste brings it down a little in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Very easy to down this beer. A beverage this great and a budget as small as mine make it a must to never have more than one bottle chilled at any time."
"Six of these beers will be more than enough for any advocate as they are more of a dessert beer than a drinkin' brew."
"Overall, I love this beer. its a winter brew, but I plan on stashing a few 6 packs away for the summer."
"This was really an excellent stout, and if you can find it, do yourself a favor and get some."
"I'm sorry I didn't grab a six pack of this stuff last year. I saw it but decided not to get it. Dumb move. I'll grab a 6 of this every winter. Great, great stuff."
"This year's batch isnt as bitter as others, and I rather enjoy it. Give it a shot if you can!"
"That said, I just stuck one in the closet, to see how it tastes next year! Interesting also to see it's hourly evolution as it warms, as well."
"Pours jet black with no head. There was a little dirty lacing. Smells strong with heavy roasted malts, hops, and chocolate at the end of the nose. Minimal carbonation. At first, you taste the roasted malts. Then, the bitterness comes over your tongue very strongly, first hops then the cocoa. Very genuine cocoa taste, but also quite bitter. Bitterness lasts with you after your swallow due to the thickness of the brew. Although it is pretty good, I'd rather have Young's."
"Limited bottling (winter '03-'04) and cellared for 6 months by myself. Purchased from Norm's Beer & Wine (near DC) in fall 2004 and consumed in December 2004. 12 oz bottle poured thick and with a half-finger brown head that quickly settled to a partial ring around the inside of the mug. Pitch black, couldn't see through this one at all. Smelled chocolate, some roast, licorice, and a faint grainy and alcohol-ish kind of 'barleywine sweet'. Thick mouthfeel. Coffee roast blended really well with a rich chocolate. A fine chocolate, not a dry or waxy cheap chocolate. Plum was noticable as was molasses (with some searching). Dry start, followed by the dry rough roast and finishing somewhere between sweet and dry. Boy, this was a nice stout. The flavor persisted just a short time, as the thick beer clung to my tongue, allowing me to reflect on this beer with a pleasant chocolatey flavor."
"A true gem and highly recommended."
"Thick, wool blanket down of Silver Surfer head that receded and laced like a sputtering black hole. No moon blackest night hue, like the edge of the horizon on a winter night, in the dark, with eyes bolted shut. Chocolate and cocoa predominate on the mouth, with a Galactacus of sweet alcohol bite that shivers down to the metatarsals, practically splintering them. A bit further along, a prune and black licorice chutney gloms around and leaves a scorched earth policy down the tongue and into the throat; tonsils suffering from the plague. Almost a funky exoskeleton of malt that feels oddly wraith-like on the mouth. Generous, but lacking something."
"Pours out black with dark tan 1 finger head. Super dark no light shining through this one.Smell is very typical of russian stouts and i cant quite pinpoint what it is but its a black licorice smell ,and i hate licorice, but in these its so sweet and subtle its very enjoyable.taste is licorice up front that changes over to a nice bittering hop that slowly fades into hints of coffee that linger nicely. This beer gets better as it warms.A nice stout that i plan to enjoy again."
"Bought a six-pack of the '03-'04 batch over a year ago and put it in storage until this weekend. Such a good idea. The beer poured a midnight black with a thick, brown head that never went away. The lace clung to the glass extremely stubbornly the whole time while I was drinking it. As soon as I opened up the bottle aromas of chocolate and rich malts were wafting out. With the pour the aroma just got stronger. The hops are slightly bitter, but balanced with rich malts. Chocolate is (of course) ever so very present but coffee and molasses also come through on the tongue. I aged this a year, I can only imagine what it would've tasted in a cask. Do they have that? After two, I took notice that the alcohol is a lot higher than the flavor lets on. I limited myself to two, but because of how extremely rich this beer is I do not know if my palate cannot take a third without burning out."
"Well the smell is a little weak or I should quit smoking. The body is as good as it gets just thick as hell with light carbonation. Of course this beer is some poetic saying of holy shit it is black, but it does get a tanish head that falls back quickly. I have had several in one sitting but this beer is better enjoyed in small doses. Now to the taste of this large black stout. Just as imagination tempts as roasted as burnt barely, almost like eating coffe beans but better. Truly a thing of beauty."
"Drinkability: Half of one of these is more than enough."
"Jet black. Held up to a lamp, I could detect no light coming through my glass. That beautiful dark brown head that looks so amazing in certain stouts and porters, and plenty of it. Roasted malts in the nose. Strong roasted coffee flavor with chocolate. Enough hop bitterness to balance. Harsh flavors, a little like sipping through an ash tray, although that makes it sound bad when it's really not. Still, it could definitely benefit from some aging. Full mouthfeel. Nice warming from the alcohol, which feels like it is evaporating in your mouth. A damn good beer, my favorite from Brooklyn Brewery, at least my favorite of their bottled beers."
"Pours a deep dark brown under a 1/2 finger tan head that settles fairly quickly to film, leaving a touch of lace. Bit disappointed there. Not much in the nose at first, but as it warmed, chocolate and some mint (mint chocolate chip?) came through. Further warming yielded some nice roastiness later. The mouth is very prickly and fairly light - appropriate but not spectacular. Wonderful taste, though: chocolate is prominent, supplemented by caramel and a touch of roasted nuts and some plum. The finish features a strong flowery hop bitterness, enhanced by the chocolate but assertive on its own. The sweet and bitter walk hand in hand into the sunset of the aftertaste, leaving a very happy mouth. Very, very nice product."
"Mouthfeel is velvety creamy with a wonderful body and good carbonation. Drinkability is good as well...a super tasty brew that will warm you up on a cold night. Many thanks to kmpitz2 for the opportunity to try this brew."
"I think I would limit myself to maybe three or four of these a night. Not a session beer. This is too be enjoyed infront of the fire. It is my new seasonal drink."
"at kuhnhenns thanks clarkv v from rate beer for bringing this in a trade with bieristgut. poured black with tan head. aroma, chocolate, roasted malts,coffee,nice hoppiness, cocoa. flavor,dark choclate,malts, licorice, hints of alcohol. a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability - I swear the ABV got higher since I had it last year. I wonder if letting it sit a year does anything, but it's probably my imagination. But since it IS a year old, I feel that's why it's more complex in its taste; aging this beer is definitely the thing to do. Don't make this a session beer as it warrants aging and sipping. Goes well with desserts in addition to being enjoyed by itself."
"Drinkability for this brew is good. The only thing bringing it down a bit is the harsh alcohol taste."
"Almost black in colour. Head is initially light brown, 1cm tall, nicely laced for an imperial stout. Strikingly malty from the start, proposing a rather complex roasty base on which builds up anise, chocolate and vegetal flavors. The roastiness at the end is a definition of stoutish balance though I didnt enjoy the raw vegetal green hop aspects, almost citrusy. Oily mouthfeel has a fairly moderate carbonation level and lets show a good trace of alcohol toward the ending. I was a bit underwhelmed by the chocolate tones to this, while they are to be found, I expected more focus. As it is, this is a well crafted imperial stout that seems a bit basic, yet a good foundation to shape better beers after."
"The sweetness of this smacks you upside the head up front, with chcocolate-covered strawberries and other ripe red or dark fruits, but is quickly decimated by a wonderful charcoal bitterrness and the slightest hops character. But hops only serve to provide balance here...the story is the dark, roasted, chocolate malt. I also percieve a vanilla or molasses-type character. The thing I love about this stout is that it seems to combine all the finest characteristics of every style of stout: milk, sweet, dry, and imperial. The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and smooth, and the drinkability is dangerously high. The alcohol isn't apparent in the taste, but is apparent in the pleasant warmth that slowly engulfs your body. Must be served at cellar or room temperature. I will drink this all winter. I'd be curious to see if aging can make this any better. That would be an impressive feat."
"Update: Winter 04-05 version, thanks to clvand0. Same, strikingly beautiful, ebony appearance as the 03-04, but the aroma has plenty of the chocolate that I found missing in last year's vintage. The immense aroma has cocoa, coffee beans, vanilla, dark fruits, and a hint of the high alcohol, which has a rum note. Flavor follows suit, with dark chocolate notes in abundance, complimented by burnt roasted coffee and dark malts. Dark fruits of prunes and raisins add to the beautiful complexity. An excellent imperial stout. Scores adjusted accordingly."
"Low in abv% for the style, yet the alcohol flavor is not hidden well. An old favorite of mine; definitely worth a try. IMO, probably Brooklyn's finest offering."
"Does anyone know where I can find this baby on draft?"
"A fine double stout, quite complex. I would like to see the alcohol flavor toned down a little, but that's why God invented aging, right?"
"This bottle was marked "" Winter '03-'04 ""."
"Of all the types of beers I drink, I enjoy Imperial Stouts the most. This is the first Imperial Stout served from a 12oz bottle that compares on the level with the great 22oz bombers. Be it the over the top Averys or the dominating Stone and Rogue. Hello Brooklyn!"
"Classy looking bottle dated Winter 04-05. A really nice black pour, not even direct light penetrates. I get a nice sticky head composed of small bubbles with some big bubbles coming through the middle creating that oatmeal like look. The smell is nice, I pick up berries, dark chocolate, plum, roasty and scorched smells and a rum like alcohol aroma tickles my nostrils. This beer tastes even better then it smells. Again I pick up on the dark fruit flavors, espresso , charred malt, the alcohol character is definitely thereits more vinous then I first detected in the smell though. I dont want to forget about the namesake chocolate,to me I pick it up more as dry, dark cocoa powderdelicious. Bitterness clings to my lips which is another thing I love about a big stout. The alcohol comes out a lot more once its warm. The mouthfeel aint bad, but when it comes to big stouts I say the thicker the better and this one falls a little short of the very best big stouts Ive had. An awesome beer, I really wish I had more than six of them"
"This beer will make you happy in all the ways that matter. ALL!!"
"Had this one recently, as a desert, while out to dinner with some friends. Served on-tap, it was presented in a tall, pilsner style glass, with a thick brown head. The color was absolute obsidian: complete and solidly black. The aroma is intensely coffee-like, with a serious chocolate malt character. As the beer warms, a bit of alcohol creeps into the smell, along with a subtle ripe-fruitness, which add a lot of depth and complexity. The beer is full, thick, and substantial. A big front-end malt sweetness is balanced with roasted flavors that come out in the mid-taste and finish. Its a soft, creamy, and almost silky beer, with a hell of a lot of flavor. This is one beer to remember and seek out."
"This is a complex, tasty stout. Chocolate is the most noticable flavor aspect, but it doesn't dominate the beer. There are a plenty of fruit notes. It's a good mix of flavors. I could drink this on any fall or winter evening."
"Just brought home the Brooklyn Chocolate Stout and was ready for that famed experience that the limited bottling implied. The pour was impressive as a dark chocolate filled my beer mug, the smell was pretty good with those hints of chocolate coming to bear. The taste, this part gets tricky. At first I thought it was exceptional on the mouth but then this taste of alcohol just overpowered the beer, which is weird since this is a chocolate stout. It was a decent stout but you couldn't drink more than one in a sitting. I will probably move on to something else for the winter without looking back."
"Drinkability: Beautiful drinking after dinner. This smoothed out fabulously over the last year."
"This was a limited bottling - winter ' 04-' 05 . Poured a pitch black color with a nice thick brown/tan head. Smell is dark cocoa with a burnt/smokey scent. Taste was smooth and loaded with dark malt, cocoa, dried fruit and again a burnt taste. Very noticeable presence of alcohol. You can feel it in your chest. Too much in my opinion. Mouthfeel was rich, thick and very satisfying. Drinkability could be better if the alcohol wasn't overbearing. I am glad I tried this one but will probably not get another this year."
"This is one of those famous beers that everyone raves about. Personally I dont care for it. I can appreciate it and understand it, but its just not by cup of tea (glass of beer) The flavors just dont mix well and all of the positive aspects are canceled out by too much of an odd flavor mixed in. Dig brooklyn beer, garrett oliver is the man, but this beer Ill pass."
"Opaque black and brown body was capped by a decent sized brown head, which dissipated soon. The aroma was roasty with chocolate and caramel. There was also a wine like alcohol aroma present. The taste was intensely dry, with the dark roasted malt, dark skinned fruit, chocolate malt, and raisins vying for attention. The alcohol provided a spicy warming backdrop. A very good 2003-2004 bottle via a trade from BeerAdvocate spritdeus, and thankfully now available in Georgia for a much cheaper indulgence."
"Ohh I like this beer! Rich, luscious, cake-like, bracing. Pours pitch black with a tight tan head and minimal but steady carbonation. Leaves fluffy tan lacing on the glass as it is consumed. Delicious malty aroma with hints of espresso and charcoal. The taste is rich and complex, figs, caramel and sweet malt followed by chocolate with a whisper of alcohol finishing with espresso. In a word divine. This is a stout to start your heart in the morning."
"The one thing I might say against this beer is that I would drink one bottle of it and it felt like it was enough. This certainly wasn't brewed for sessions. A sipping beer all the way, and one of the more intense stouts that I have sampled."
"Pours a black no light threw this baby, dark tan head that falls quickly. Aroma is lots of chocolate malt with light expresso aroma touch of dark fruity boquet with citrusy hops. Taste is great lots of burnt roasted chocolate malt great chocolate flavor with light coffee flavors touch of dark fruit and nice hoppy flavor and bite. Good long aftertaste of sweetness and bitterness perfect mixture. Brooklyn did one hell of a job with this beer. Mouthfeel is right where it should be. Drinkability is good nice sweet some say a dessert beer but had no problem having a couple anytime dessert or lunch or breakfast hell anytime is a good time :)"
"This is my ideal Imperial Stout as it had the ingredients that I usually desire. It had lots of deep rich malt notes rather than dark fruitiness that you find in some, yet I thought too much black malt was used in this one. Coffee, chocolate and mocha were present. For the style, this beer is alright."
"Pours like motor oil out of the bottle. Its basically the guy who says ""You like those dark beers huh?""'s worst nightmare. Simply awesome appearance. Smell is roasted malt, chocolate and some alcohol. Taste is very smooth for a 8.5% ABV beer, though a tad sweet. Couldn't drink too many of these at once. Roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a malty sweetness at the end. Very warming. Very pleasant aftertaste. One of the US imperial style stouts I've had."
"This poured black and oily, with a huge brown head. The aroma is great with lots of chocolate and roasted maltiness. The taste is also great. Chocolate and roasted flavors but not bitter. Malty but not too sweet. Well balanced and very drinkable. The mouthfeel is very good, and the alcohol level is just right."
"Wyll-"
"very different to what i thought would lurk within its bottle, but still a fine drinking experience and one i would not pass up again in the future. up there with some of the worlds finest stouts without question."
"12 ounce bottle, winter 02-03 vintage. Pours black and dense, with a minimal tiny bubble film/head. Nose of burnt malt and alcohol.. Large and lovely this beer is soft, subtle and smooth. also strong, flavorful and satisfying. Notes of burnt malt, expresso, motor oil, rocket fuel. this classy sipper has it all. Put a few bottles away for a year or two, its worth it."
"Drinkability: With all the complex flavors of malts this beer is exceptional."
" I have other ""go to "" Imperial Stouts that are available locally that will keep me happy (Bell's Expedition, Rogue IS, North Coast Old Rasputin). This offering is similar to Victory Storm King. It's not the same as Storm King but it has the same attitude. I'll enjoy it again but I won't go out of my way to acquire it. I'm happy with my locally available Imperial Stouts. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample."
" not as complex as Storm King, but it was very nice but just didn't have the complexity."
"Pours out a nice pitch black color with a little over an inch of tan foam. The head retention is fairly good as it sticks around for a few drinks and leaves a nice lace around the snifter as it is consumed. The aroma is reminiscent of Kahlua, with notes of coffee, dark chocolate and a slight hint of dark fruits. Taste is very much similar with a bitter sweet dark chocolate taste standing out front with roasted coffee and a slight earthy hop tone complementing it. The chocolate taste coats your mouth along with a nice full mouthfeel. This is another great example of a highly drinkable imperial stout. A great IS in every area, highly recommended."
"2003/2004 release. Pours completely black with a coffee colored head that dissipated relatively quickly. Aroma has some hints of caramel, cherry, black licorice, and roasted malts - but the overall scent I pick up is that of dark chocolate liqueor. This brew coats the mouth like syrup & is bittersweet. More licorice & cherry in the flavor profile, but also, of course, loads of dark chocolate. Alcohol is significantly more upfront than I would have hoped, though the brew becomes more well-rounded as it warms. All kinds of heavily roasted/burnt malt throughout. Finishes a little dry with long lasting chocolate truffle, espresso, & dark cherry."
"Overall Impression: Glad I was sitting down, this stuff rocked my world. Beer for Russian Royalty? This is beer for the Gods! A superb Imperial Stout. As I check the BJCP guide for reference, Im not terribly surprised to find this beer listed as a classic example. Drinkability? While this beer slaked my thirst in a mighty way, I could probably drink another, and it is a beer Id be happy to acquire again. Many thanks to mattcrill (actually, his wife) for the bottle, I am indebted. If you are lucky enough to see this little gem in your local store, buy it, all of it."
"This is a very balanced Imperial Stout. I'd drink it again."
"s.d."
"Winter 2002-2003 bottling (12oz) kept in 50° refrigerator, tasted on 5/04/04. Poured an impenetrable brown/black color with very few fine carbonation bubbles. Reddish-brown head that quickly disappeared leaving very slight lacing. Aroma heavy in chocolate with mild roasted scent. A very heavy mouthful with definate chocolate and roasted flavor. The roasted feature comes out stronger on finish and lasts for several minutes."
"Stouts are not my favorite style but I am trying to taste more and more. I won't write any bad reviews for any stouts I have tried even if I don't like them because I feel I need to know the style better. That said, when I find a stout I like, I have to write a good review about it. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a great brew. Lets start with its appearance. Wow! Very dark brew and you cannot see any light through it. The head is kind of tan and dies down shortly after pouring. The smell is exceptional. Its really just what you would expect only better. It is a heavy aroma of chocolate and coffee. After taking a good whiff of the beer, there is no way you can wait to try it. Mmmmm chocolate. The beer has a bitter kick to it as well. I didn't really pay attention to the ABV and it surprises me that its so high. Disguised very well although you know you are having something over 6.5."
"Once swallowed, there is left a nice bitter aftertaste that is really subtle yet distinctive. This is a fantastic and extremely good Stout. I will buy again and I highly recommend it."
"First I just have to complement the label, it is just nice and classy, very stylish. It also lets you know that it has 6 varieties of black, chocolate, and roasted malts... nice. Poured pitch freakin' black, beautiful. Beige head reduced to a creamy but minimal ring around the edge of the glass. Amazingly what I taste reminds me of fresh red bell peppers, odd? but very good. Scents of roasted malts. (drank this in the same place with the annoying cigar guy lurking nearby, so he tampered the great experience of this beer... as much as I crawled away from him...) Tastes of chocolate and the roasted malts, godiva liquor (yummmm), black coffee... Not too thick or heavy, just perfect. Great mouthfeel and a nice lingering finish. Schweet."
"Drinkability:If you haven't guessed it yet, I would kill for this beer. Can't wait to make a trip out to Croxley's and taste it on Tap. I am in love..."
"Poured black as night with a small head that quickly dissolves. Very light carbonation but very nice. Smells of chocolate and nuts invade your nasal passages. Wonderful blend of sweetness (chocolate, coffee) and alcohol makes for a very smooth drink. I found it hard to enjoy b/c it was so good and I wanted to drink it too fast. Goes down easy and goes great with steak or hamburgers. For the price of a six pack, this could easily become a regular occurance for me. Just had another one today and oh my god! This is the stuff. Just a classic, complex, rockin' stout. This is definitely ""top 5"" in my book. If you see it, drink it. No questions asked, just do as I say... you won't regret it."
"A very nice girl brought this back to me from a trip to New York over Christmas and I'm just now entering my notes (stupid work). Pours an opaque black with a medium sized tan head. The head is persistent and has a smooth creamy look and is composed of many tiny bubbles. There is something about the contrast in color between the body of a ""black"" beer and the head which I really enjoy--and so this beer from the start looks good to me. Strong aroma of chocolate (of course) and roast coffee. Very nice taste of chocolate and coffee malts with some nice hop bitterness in the finish. Smooth and very drinkable, a very nice beer."
"This beer comes highly recomended, from me that is...."
"This is a high impact brew!"
"-Oelergud"
"This beer has the expected dark chocolate color and a thin head the color of swiss milk chocolate that fades quickly, but leaves a chocolate ring on the glass. The taste is outstanding, the strength of the chocolate flavor is perfect, with a sharp hint of the 8.5% ABV underneath. Goes down smooth, with a bit of a coffee aftertaste (a bit too much, which detracts a little from the drinkability as you'll want a glass of water afterwards.) Ranks up there with the best IMO."
"If you get the cahnce, get some for desert and serve with a nice creamy cherry pie...mmm"
"I picked up a couple for Easter while out of town. A real treat is was. It poured, much to my surprise almost flat, then toward the end of the pour a show of chocolate brown arose from the dark bottom to cascade to a nice, soft, full one inch head. The aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts greet the nose. The taste follows the same route but with rich detail. This is a heavy player among beers but the mouthfeel, though sharp with dark chocolate, is pleased. Drinkability is good for the higher abv. Overall a good annual treat. I'll look forward to next years batch."
"This beer poured a deep dark black with a nice head. The head slowly diminished, leaving a nice lacing that remained for the duration. The aroma was filled with roasted malts and chocolate. The taste was true to the aroma as it was also a nice combination of dark roasted malts and a dark chocolate. The drawback here is that the chocolate taste is overwhelming and it takes away from any of the other flavors that are hidden in there. The mouthfeel was relatively thick and heavy but the drinkability was good. Overall, this would make an excellent desert beer but I couldn't see drinking a couple of these over the course of an evening."
"It sure is going down quick. Real smooth and creamy, but I could only handle one of these babys at a time."
"Poors a deep black with a ruby highlight. Tha roated malt gives this a fantastic aroma . Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. The chocolate and coffe flavor make this perfect for a dessert ar an accompaniment for a good Cohiba. The 02-03 bottle is quite high in A.B.V. and is evident but subdued by the rich flavor. Finishes with an almost capucinno flavor. Best enjoyed in a tulip glass with a good friend or sitting by the fire, Probably the finest Imperial I've ever had."
"03-04 12oz poured with minimal head of a dark brown, and no lacing. Pure black body which no light (well, a 20W halogen) could penetrate. Swirl released rich roasted malt aromas and a bit of alcohol. Body is smooth a medium-full for the style, with a gentle carbonation. Malts upfront, chocolate and roasted flavors, developing with a slight hop profile on the way down, and a nutty chocolate aftertaste, alcohol becoming more apparent as the glass drains. A very strong stout flavorwise, but too single-minded to amaze."
"I was really looking forward to this brew based upon the other reviews here. While fervently complex, sadly, it doesn't hold a candle to my other favorite stouts (Shakespeare, Kalamazoo, Rasputin). The off-flavors are simply too much and severely limit it's drinkability. I would pass on this one. Fermented with a different yeast, this might be a winner. I expect much more of my stouts."
"My ratings reflect the 03-04 version."
"Notes: Although a very solid chocolate stout, but pales in comparison to Roque's version. Thanks nonetheless to kbub6f for the opportunity!"
"Snagged a 6-pack of the 03-04 edition of this at Jungle Jim's outside of Cincinnati. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile now so I was pretty pumped when I found it. I'm glad that it didn't dissapoint. It pours a jet black with a 1 finger tan foam head. Smell is very rich and full of roasted malts. Taste is super rich too, malts all around. A few hints of dark fruits (I'm thinking plum) also pop up. Mouthfeel viscous but the taste sticks around so that helps a little bit. Drinkability isn't the highest on these beasts, about 1 a night is all i can handle. I'll surely be having his more in the future. Only if they had a distributor in Indiana."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, especially for a limited edition winter stout. Lack of head and hops really disappoints me. Usually it takes me a long time to wash a glass that had an imp stout in it. My roomates bitch at me because I bring down pint glasses with week old sticky Storm King lace crusted from top to bottom. This beer's microscopic head didn't even stick on the sides. I guess drinkability might be ok, but I really can't see myself wanting another. Sorry, Brooklyn but I feel let down. I'll promise to try some other offerings, but to me, the flagship ran aground."
"it starts off intense and hoppy and slides into a smooth chocolate comfort zone. It's almost as chocolatey as Rogue Chocolate but this beer is malt only no adjuncts. I want to eat cheescake and smoke a Romeo y Juliet with this great beer. Storm King might be more intense but this is one of the great classy big beers in the world."
"However before tasting, I noticed a nice robust dark malty chocolate-T smell eminating from the glass. I also got a hint of mochachino coffee from it. Upon tasting, the carbonation really came through, which I found weird considering I drank it at room temperature. However, the chocolate came through nicely w/ a bit of a smokey roasted malty taste, which really made me happy! This beer is very drinkable, and one of my favorite by Brooklyn....actually, I think Brooklyn is one of my favorite breweries...the cease to make anything I don't enjoy. Happy drinking!"
"A real beer, the 03-04 version. Chocolate dark brown color and small brown head. Alcohol comes through in the drink, so slow down! Very noticeable chocolate and roasted malt. Made to age some. Thought a bit much carbonation, which held back on mouthfeel. Great dessert. Five and a half-years later, the roast and so-forth, not as thick as the new breed of RIS, still a great desert or dessert beer."
"Vintage 02-03 - It pours an opaque black with a light tan head. The aroma has a lot of chocolate and some roasted coffee in the nose. It is oily and malty with a ton of choclate flavor and some roasted malts. Unless I am mistaken, there is a lot of choclate flavor in this beer for only using chocolate malt and no actual chocolate."
"Pours ink black in color with a foamy thick tan colored head that fades into a heavy lace. Noticeable alcohol in the nose with notes of black currant, roasted malts and an aroma similar to a raisiny port. Full in body and quite smooth and creamy in texture. Taste begins with rich chocolaty malts and espresso along with some fruity notes of ripe prunes. A bit of black liquorish then makes an appearance with a touch of acidic hop resins and finally some winey notes in the end. A thoroughly enjoyable imperial stout, though I think some additional aging will help it to mellow a bit more. Purchased from Vintage Cellar."
"Pitch black in color with a thin tan head. Aroma is strongly chocolate with a bit of coffee. Flavor is incredible. Bittersweet chocolate and expresso. Finish is coffee bitter with a cocoa flavor. Great beer with a chocolate flavor that doesn't go overboard."
"Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a brown, caramel colored head that looks good enough to eat. The aroma is that of chocolate, coffee/expresso and malt. The taste is superb, with chocolate and roasted malt exploding in the mouth, with the swallow giving off hints of a dark chocolate and a light licorice. Damn. This is a good beer."
"This is definately in my top 5 of all of the beers I have EVER tasted. Now, I have to find a homebrew recipe for it :)"
"Medium, doughy, brown head. Absolutely opaque, black beer. No highlights. Thick, sheety lacing. The nose is rich, buttery chocolate. Bitter chocolate in the front turns tangy for the thick, chocolatey middle. Some fruit in there, too. Quite bitter on the finish, with a powdery cocoa effect. Some green peas and alcohol. This is a very good chocolate stout in a field of many good contenders."
"Pours dark as a moonless night with a khaki coloured one finger head on top. Smell is of good espresso, bitter chocolate and maybe a touch of molasses. The flavour is nice and deep with coffee and dark chocolate notes taking over. Alcohol is well hidden and the beer is silky smooth going down and eventually finishing dry, but not too dry. Drinkability is good after a few you will start to see things in a new light. Recommended- buy them and horde them as the supply is always short."
"Nummilicious. I know of no one who has had this that didn't like this beer, and I've been handing it out to neophytes (or at least people that wouldn't consider themselves overly knowledgeable). Worthy of buying by the case. I hope there will be one left in a week and a half..."
"pretty damn good stuff...the chocolate flavor really comes out and combined with the smoothness, makes it a good beer in my book"
"Nice color with good initial head which dissipated for me. The taste is quite deep with many good overtones. ""Deep"" is the best word that I can come up with. Appropriately for the style, I find this very good. For an imperial stout this is really drinkable. Quite a beer."
"Thanks Bierman9!"
"For a higher alcohol beer, this is one that I can take a few of."
"A very nice year. I missed last year's version, but this year seems much smoother that I recalled from previous versions. Surprisingly easy drinking for such a massive beer, with an excellent bittersweet chocolate flavor."
"I have never tried it before this year, and I must say I was highly impressed. This is one of the best stouts that I have sampled. It is flavorful and smooth, and in my opinion, right up there with Storm King. In fact, I would almost prefer this to the storm king because it is far more drinkable in my opinion. The beer is extremely dark, it is opaquely black when held up to the light, not allowing any to pass through, with the faintest red tinges around the edges. The taste is excellent, and the alcohol is extremely well disguised in my opinion. Overall, I would say that this is one of my favorite brews. In my region (New Jersey) it is quite easy to find, but I would recommend others who cannot find it locally to seek it out through a trade or other arrangement because it is certainly worth it."
"12 oz. bottle of this year's batch. Pours a dark, almost completely black liquid with a tan foamy head. Looks good so far. Smells of chocoalte and almost black licorice. Stron hops, cjocolate and almost like aprune taste. I could really feel the higher alcohol presence. Good mouthfeel, maybe a touch thin. Probably couldn't have more than one or two of these. Still a good imperial stout. I had some success cellaring last year's batch and it turned out very well, although I didn't review it. Anyway, don't pass this one up."
"There's a sharp, hoppy aftertaste, followed by a second aftertaste that is malty and sweet. The first taste gives the impression that the beer is simple by the standards of stouts, but the complexity comes out in the after taste. The head is thick and creamy. It's surprisingly drinkable for a beer with 8.5 ABV."
"12 ounce bottle. Vintage '03-'04."
"I don't know if cellaring this relatively fresh Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout will soften it a little, but I'll give it a try since I have five bottles left to drink."
"Taste: Soft and creamy, with heavy espresso and chocolate malt. Noticeable alcohol kick, with hops just peeking through in this aged version's finish."
"Onyx color, with a thick robust head small but great color. The alcohol was present in the aroma with chocolate and roasted coffee. Tasted said coffee and hints of burnt chocolate with a nice afterburn of caramel malts and alcohol. The mouthfeel was decent but not as thick as I like. Thank you I'll have another."
"I had huge expectations for this beer, and it mostly lived up to them. All around, a smooth, subtle beer (especially for an imperial). Very good."
"Big thanks to TwelveVoltMan for the bottle!"
"I wouldn't suggest having this beer with a meal. Instead, have it all by itself and enjoy each delicious mouthful."
"Tasted blind at the Saint Louis BA tasting 12/14/03"
"BeerAdvocates rule!"
"pour thick and black like dirty motor oil (except it's sort of appetizing in this context). black with a thin brown head that doesn't linger. smells like unsweetened bakers chocolate with a slight black licorice undertone. it smells faintly alcoholic too. tastes chocolatey as hell. can't pick out any of the licorice form the smell. slightly grainy tastes develop after a few sips. slight hoppiness goes well with the beitter chocolate flavors. a thick mouthfeel suits this intensely rich stout. drinkability suffers a little though, it's really heavy and rich i can't see drinking more than one of these in a sitting, or even very often."
"I liked this beer, but was a little disappointed with it. Chocolate stouts have been hit or miss with me, I love Young's but didn't like Rogue very much. This falls in the middle. The chocolate taste was not overwhelming, like Rogue's, but there isn't much else going on. It is not as smooth as Young's. The BBCS is a very nice dessert beer...actually skip the dessert and just drink this! I was a little surprised that this was an imperial stout, as I didn't notice the complexity I normally do with the style. I also didn't really notice the alcohol at all."
"Opaque black color. Great glistening 1/2 inch head of light brown color. Heavy lacing properties. Malty caramel aroma, some alcohol sense, overall sweetish and milk chocolate though. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and consistent and well-composed. Impression is chocolate-based to be sure, a touch of roast and coffee, but overall, very sweet. Pleasant aftertaste. In many ways this beer falls short of Imperial fire and comes off a tad too saccharin for me. I was looking for more burnt tones, dark fruits, hops, and power."
"ng"
"The color was black with a moderate tan head. The smell was of chocolate and coffee. The taste was also of chocolate and coffee, but it was too much for me. All I tasted was the chocolate. It was kind of a musty feel. It also had a slight hint of coffee. It tasted like a ""senior living community"" smells. But it did go down pretty good."
"12 oz bottle. Part of my Holiday trade. Thanks Loki! Poured a pitch black with a massive head that really stuck around. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a strong roasted, almost burnt coffee. The taste for me was all over the place. Thick and chewy like a stout should be. But way too young I think. Good thing I got another bottle today from ManekiNeko in my BIF 4.0 package, gotta let this thing age for awhile and try it again. I just couldn't get through this. There is just something in this that didn't go over very well."
"As much as the Bells Expedition stout was devoid of head, this beer has a monumental head, creamy like whipped chocolate which is its color and as it evanesces, leaves behind a thick sheet of lace to smother the glass. The aroma of hot chocolate, sweet malt, hints of coffee and the toasted grains make this a quite sniffable brew, what a treat to this old honker. Sweet as chocolate fudge on the start, top thick and full to the palate, finish has a delightful amount of carbonation, the hops pertinent but not overpowering, bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste that lingers on the palate for hours. Delightful stout, and a must if your into the dark side."
"This '03-'04 edition poured a pitch black color with a thick, compact brown head that disappeared kind of quickly, but left excellent lacing. Vinous aroma of dark chocolate, dark fruit, coffee, espresso and currants. Lots going on with all these roasted malts. Taste of burnt, bittersweet chocolate and coffee, but has a nice hop balance to keeping it from being too sweet. Thick-bodied with a nice warming sensation in the belly. Alcohol shows its presence, but is not overbearing. What a wonderful winter warmer. I have been drinking this treat since it first hit the market back in '94 when Garrett Oliver just started working at the Brooklyn Brewery."
"Poured black as night, almost like the dark stuff our beergdreams are made of. Little to no head, giving way to a clear view into the darkness of the beer. It smells exactly like chocolate or dark patent malts. The roast is everpresent. The taste however, highlights this roasted smell. Imagine the darkest chocolate you've ever eaten mixed with coffee but without the bitterness. Until the end of the sip, when you have an aftertaste of the alcohol with a lingering roast. This is definitely a sipper, as it is full of flavor as well as a high ABV."
"Been waiting to try this one. Pours an extremely dark color with a thin tan head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly just malts, but there was a faint hint of coffee and a little less of chocolate. Now for the flavor: Initially I got a burst of dark chocolate flavor, followed closely by a sweet malty flavor, then it finished with a strong alcohol tone. A lot more smooth than I had first imagined, but it could be more so if they could mask the alcohol a little better. Still a wonderful brew and the initial burst of chocolate was superb. Loved this one. I think it took me nearly 40 minutes to finish it because I kept just sipping it to get the most of the flavor."
"A dark, straight black in color, with a thick brown cream head. Has a roasted, malt like smell. Taste is eloquent (if that is proper English), tasting like burnt chocolate, but lingers with a dark chocolate aftertaste. Surprisingly, this brew is quite sweet and malty for a stout. Hoppy and delicious. The carbonation seems especially strong. Very easy to drink, I love this stuff! Thumbs up."
"This chocolate stout is a little more drinkable than I expected it to be. Well done."
"A very tasty beer that I am so, so glad I bought when I was out East. Comparing this to Young's Double Chocolate Stout is worthless, they are too different, but both are awesome. Gotta check this one out if you get a chance."
"The alcohol hit me pretty strong, but I really enjoyed drinking this stuff - definitely a fantastic winter brew."
"Drinkability. So strong and thick, can be tough to put down a lot. Very tasty though. 4.0"
"Jet black in appearance with a large head of tan foam. The aroma is intense with dark sweet chocolate and the strong presence of alcohol. Also detected caramel, raisins and the scent of an old leather glove. The flavors are also strong and complex, with heavy roasted grain, coffee liqueur and a cordial-like sweetness. The beer finishes dry with a pleasant bitterness, but the alcohol is still a bit harsh and abrupt. This version could be a bit young yet and could do with some aging. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable."
"""05-06. Wow I can't believe that its been almost two years since I've tasted this. Not much to add except I need to review this one again a year later to let the flavors blend a bit better. Still damn tasty though. thanks Kmpitz for this bottle."
"The hops play an especially understated role in this beer, but with the density of complexity of the malt component, the uneveness is actually a good thing, keeping it from becoming too busy. The high ABV comes through clearly, but that's a necessary by-product of the prodigious grain bill. In spite of the alcohol, I could easily have one or two more and still function happily. Well, OK, I wouldn't be operating any heavy machinery, but I would be wearing a simple satisfied grin."
"Great dessert. Fitting for a winter stout."
"Poured jet black with very little head and no visible lace. Carbonation was good. Chocolately aroma tempered somewhat with a roasted coffee and maybe some chicory notes ? Flavor was a little sweet upfront then overpowering rush of alcoholic malt flavors. Great mouthfeel and alcohol is present but not uncomfortable. Little bit on the sweet side but overall balance is very good."
"Smell is somewhat muted but the taste is phenomenally rich. Chocolate and coffee right upfront. Alcohol comes through as well. I wish I could instantly age one of these but I guess I'll have to wait."
"A real potent brew that isn't afraid to show off the alcohol content inside. Drinkability took a minor hit as the prominant alcohol taste kept me from knocking this beer back in short order. Still, Brooklyn Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout is one of my top three favorite imperial stouts. A real winner."
"Pitch black, motor oil pour, with a whipped, creamy tannish head, which will hold it's own throughout. Some chocolate malts, plums, dark roast coffee beans on the nose, quite pleasant. An incredible first impression beverage. Big bodied brew, almost syrupy up front; the initial twange is a combo of burnt/roasted malts, chocolate, coffee beans and a touch of alcohol noted. As she warms, the alchol is a bit more noticeable, a citric hop character comes through, dark fruit notes as well. Finishes with a smokey presence and bitter burnt malts; the burnt flavors are a bit overpowering to make this drinkable, but it is a beer to cherish."
"The beer pours a thick black color with a dark brown head. The aroma is of chocolate and black malts. It's robust and hearty. The taste is great. It has a deep chocolate flavor with a good balance of black barley to add a crisp finish. The beer is thick and has an elevated abv taste you get along with a sweet finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation; a great drinking stout."
"Pours a beautiful ruby black with a dark brown head. Aroma is coffeeish. Taste is rich dark chocolate with espresso and black cherry overtones. Definitely chocolate taste but Perugina, not Hershey's. Strong on the tounge with a suprisingly dry and bitter finish. Great Stuff!"
"Believe it or night, the pour was opaque, black as night. I detected some roasted notes as I took a whiff. Taste is heavy on the roasted notes as well, I must say I was a wee bit disapointed as my palate searched for the chocolate flavor I was promised. I did detect some of the alcohol, however. Very stoutlike, slightly dry, a lot of roasted flavor, but no chocolate? Come on! pat"
"Burnt molasses turned into rum aged for a century in charred port barrels. Black rubber flip flops on hot asphalt. Too fizzy to establish a chocolate fruit flavor, there is an over-extracted coffee impression that remains from beginning to end. Tastes a little like chewed-up caffein pills."
"Quite flavorful and malty. I get coffee notes in the middle and the finish is, surprise, all chocolate. Some what sweet, though this sweetness is quite subdued by all of the dark-malt flavors. The alcohol is farily hidden, though perhaps there is a hint of it in the finish. This beer fits perfectly right now in my hands, on this chilly desert night. As the beer sits in my glass a bit, I can pick up the alcohol in the aroma. This is quite good, quite enjoyable. Stellar, perhaps not, but I will be enjoying this one again."
"Drinkability: As long as your not driving it is suppurb. Fill this the body, mind, and soul with a warmness and bliss rarely found in a brew."
"Watch out, this one will get 'cha."
"Overall: One of the best stouts I've ever had. Hands down, this is the best Brooklyn product I've tried to date."
"Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. The above is my note prior to revealing the identity of the beer. Obviously, its not a basic stout, but it sure drinks like one. Don't know where they hid the alcohol. Not really up to Imperial standards in taste, but a very tasty brew."
"Typical of the style, this beer pours jet black out of the bottle, with no light escaping through the liquid. There is a good amount of bubbly tan head, which recedes slowly in to a thin collar and a churning froth on top. The smell is quite odd to say the least. The only words that come to my mind when the smell hits my nose are salty raisinettes. There is very little scent of hops or malt because they are over powered by this off-chocolate fruity smell. The taste is more pleasant than the smell is. It is a smooth beer to drink, although it leaves a slightly chalky feel in the mouth. The taste is that of burnt malt and a little coffee and chocolate, hiding the hops underneath. The smell of this beer is strong enough to influence the initial taste as it hits your tongue. The aftertaste is very subtle roast coffee. Although there is alot of flavor to this beer, it is a bit unbalanced. Regardless, its not bad at all."
"This was Bloody Marvelous  Many Thanks Todd!!!"
"Thanks Bruiser81!"
"Appearance: Deep black can't see any light coming through whatsoever with a nice sized tan head leaves nice even ring of lacing. Aroma: Dark roasts bring about hints of chocolate and seared fruit with alcohol notes around the edges this is a complex big imperial stout. Taste: Creamy chocolate tone quickly nulled by a streak of alcohol like a shot of liquer infused with cherries and other fruit notes this is one big beer here, nice and alluring just a bit overwhelming one glass at a time not a session by any means. Mouthfeel: Full bodied thick syrupy mouthfeel this a big stout. Drinkability: I am much more proned to a Young's Double Chocolate if I'm going after a chocolate character in my stout this one has alot more of everything alcohol, malts, and chocolate just may lack some balance with the searing alcohol burn in presents."
"2003-2004 edition. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep jet black color with 3 fingers of dark tan foam that cascaded a bit on a heavy pour. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very rich with cocoa, coffee, and caramel. A brilliant sweet aroma that fills the nose well. The taste starts with burnt malt and chocolate. Sweet, but not a bit cloying. Coffee and toffee are also present. The finish ends with a tad bit of hops. A very well balanced stout. The mouthfeel is very thick, yet silky smooth, just wonderful. The drinkability is fairly good for being 8.5%. I could sure enjoy at least a couple on this cold winter night."
"the brawney head was dark tan with a slight ruby/cranberry tinture. very foamy and staying, nicely aroused in the glass and leaving a great amount of clingy reminant lace. oh yeah and the liquid was black as anything could be. on to the great scent of this beer. hops that smell sweet like candy and candied fruit, cherries and a number of chocolate tones. milk chocolate, cocoa, creme de cacao and so on. on the taste, whoa, what alot of coco! people might think this has some coffee but it's not more than a hint, that is cocoa, dry dark chocolate. it's totally rocking and greatly dry, it just dries up the palate like mad. there are hints of cherries here on the palate as well. it's very warming and i didn't know what the abv was until now and i'm not amazed other than how well that was cloaked by chocolate on the nose and on the palate. quite a creamy mouthfeel, full bodied and very complimentary to the beer. the drinkability i rated in accordance to the idea that this is certainly a one at a time beer, a special time. i can't go putting one of these down because i feel like a beer."
"Flavor follows suit with a starting touch of roast and CO2.Coffee roasts start to pick up with a large molasses backing. Hard dark cocoa builds and takes over for the coffee before a final finish hop fights the remaining sweetness down. REsidual sweetness from the body remains on the lips long after beer is but a dry memory on the palate."
"The thick black body was crowned by a humongous beige head that lasted and laced with gusto. The engine oil look was matched by a feel like a very viscuous lubricant wanting to ease my pain. The smell of roasted grain and chocolate is very pronounced and the taste was a lovely blend of coffee and dark chocolate with an overlay of alcohol. Limited by its ABV, the drinkability can only be rated as moderate as this is very strong stout. Lovely, but with pronounced, muscular biceps."
"483"
"Midnight black body as expected, with a dense, creamy, foamy, wet khaki head. Hints of ruby along the edges, oily bubbles dancing along the top. Plenty of aroamas of rum soaked raisans, plums, figs, and burnt fruit along a super bitter base. Taste is nice and rummy, lots of roasted fruit flavors. Chocolate taste is subtle not up front, but I think alot of that flavor has settled maybe in nearly 2 years. Plenty of Imperial Stout flavors, well balanced and burnt bitterness finishes up. Medium to full bodied, well carbonated as well. A very good beer, and dinner finisher, well worth the wait."
"Opaque darkest brown bordering black with a nice medium brown colored head if poured with TLC. Black patent and chocolate malt aromas, together with coffee and toffee and other smoky and burnt aromas make for one tantalizingly smooth smelling stout. Big, big, big malt taste with a nice balance of hops in there, too. Heavy on the chocolate malt, finishing with a bitter malt tartness and a touch of fruitiness. As thick as used motor oil, yet to me maintains a certain drinkability despite it's beefy ABV. One of the finer stouts from the US."
"Served nice black black with a short brown head. Chocolate is big and strong. Way too strong!!! I love how the smoked taste blends in with the rest of the malts. This beer would be very good, but they tried to pack too much chocolate into it and that just did not work out for them. My advise: try again on the recipe, but this time don't be so coco-happy."
"Probably my favorite Imperial Stout to date. The chocolate adds a beautiful complexity to the basic taste. Simply tremendous, and I'm glad I still have a 6 pack of this one, and it's definitely one I'll be having again!!!!"
"Brooklyn pours impenetrable black with a nice tan foam head. I smell some alcohol, some chocolate, and some toasted malt. Smells like an imperial, which of course is not very descriptive. First sips, revel big bold silky texture of chocolate masking alcohol underneath. Alcohol dominates the flavor, but is not unbearable. Its almost a shame to review such a new imperial. I bought a case, so Ill do another review at 6 and 12 months. Hell, maybe every two months because I sure love this stuff. As my beer sinks, the tan foam clings in the side of my pint. Mid-pint I start to taste the slightly bitter chocolate against the crisp malt backbone. For some reason, the taste brings me back to Hair of the Dogs Adam maybe due its complex flavor. This is truly a fantastic winter warmer. Why do people drink warmed brandy.they should be having Black Chocolate Stout. For such a young imperial, Im impressed; the chocolate sure helps a lot with the flavor. In six months Ill be blown away. The alcohol reveals itself in the last sips of this beer, but isnt that always the case with imperials. Sign me up for the Garrett Oliver fan club."
"Drinkability is a double-edged sword - yes it's easy to drink, but with the high abv you can't drink many. I put a 6er down in the cellar, can't wait to see how they turn out next year."
"OUTSTANDING!"
"I wasnt nearly as impressed with this one as most folks usually seem to be. Ive had a few of these now, and always come to the same conclusion. Good brew, but it just doesnt knock my socks off. Ill take a Samuel Smith Imperial Stout, Storm King, or even an Old Rasputin over this brew any day of the week. I've set a few of these aside to age until next winter. With a year of aging under their belt, I may come to a very different conclusion in the future."
"Poured the same deep inky blackness as on-tap. Frothy layer of dark tan-colored head. Nice lacing of the glass. Aromas of chocolate and coffee. Flavor lets me down. Not as big and bold as other imperial stouts. It's good, but several notches from being the best. Lots of velvety chocolate in the flavor. Mix in some espresso and some bitter hops. No alcohol noted. Nice bittersweet flavor at the end. Some smoky flavor as well. Interestingly, the sourness I detected from the tap version is not as present. Still a great sipper. Curl up by the fire and grab a book. Winter's here and this is a great beer to enjoy."
"Kudos to the Brooklyn Brewery for creating an immensely drinkable chocolate stout. While this isn't quite as good as the Rouge Chocolate Stout I sampled, at $6.99/six pack it's probably the most affordable brew in the BA Top 50. I plan to buy a case to cellar. Be sure to check this out!"
"Bitter roast coffee, dark chocolate, & raisins all quickly pass over the tongue. A dryish finish with a touch of orangey hops. A rich chocolate flavour linger for ages. Big, rich, & full bodied. Gentle carbonation."
"No light will escape this black hole that has the darkest, creamiest brown frosting on top. Smells like a magic elixir that just might kill you. Bold flavors of alcohol, dark malts, and hops warn you of what is ahead. Chocolate mousse riding on a wave of alcohol, cloaked in black bitter burntness, with a crown of hops. Liquid silk. Damn."
"Purchased the 2003 version. It pours a black color with a light brown head. There is large bubbles and nice lacing on the glass. The aromas are big on chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, and alcohol. The roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, and coffee are all through the flavor, with the chocolate lasting long on the tongue after swallowing. The alcohol is very noticable and warms your insides. Very enjoyable, but the noticable alcohol makes this a bit less than good for drinkability."
"The taste starts off malty sweet with a strong chocolate component, followed quickly by a hit of roasted malt and an alcohol warmth. It finishes with an almost harsh bitterness, which suggests most strongly to me that this beer is young. This brew seems to be a bit heavier in the alcohol department, and I'm guessing that a bit of aging will help it immensely. Having had the 2002 version not very long ago, I know that this beer has the potential to be one of the best of stouts..."
"The taste is a huge let down. Taste has a strange ""moldy grain"" component. And as ithaca baron intimated, a bit of a burnt tobacco note on the finish. I'll be aging my remaining bottles ofr a while, but for now, the ratings reflect the current edition."
"Anyway, maybe I got a bad bottle, or maybe I missed something with this one. I'll probably try it again for that reason, and I encourage others to give this at least one try -- they might like it a lot more than I did."
"I am stocking up on this beer. I doubt I can wait Spring through Fall for this one again."
"Bottom line: A nice beer from Brooklyn that I'm sure I will enjoy many times this winter. The flavors are a little light for an Imperial Stout, and I think there are a number of better examples out there."
"Drinkability: This IS Imperial Stout! To me, you save your ""5" ratings for the very, VERY few that are truly stunning... this brew rates."
"I heard so much about it, impossible to pick up in Wisconsin, finally got it over the internet. Color was sinnfully black, the aroma was chocolately malty, but not very bold, then POW, the heavy chewy dark chocolate taste, nice roasted chocolate malt aftertaste, seemed to get a little sweeter as it warmed, and a lot creamier texture.Just wish Mr. Oliver would not make this wonderful stuff so hard to get."
"Finally got a chance to sample this thanks to a trade. Limited bottling '03-'04. Dark as night with maybe a tinge of garnet at the edges while held up to bright light. An inch of tan head is settling down quickly. Sensational aroma of bitter sweet chocolate and roasted malts with a hint of licorice. Creamy and delicate mouthfeel. Flavor is definitely semi-sweet chocolate with a dry finish. This is a very nice stout and deserved of its praise."
"A gorgeous stout. Very tasty, heavy, and warming. One best enjoyed as a dessert brew. Since this one packs such serious flavors, I probably could not drink more than one at a sitting. Best at cellar temperature. Laying this one down for a year or so is definitely the way to go - if you can resist the temptation!"
" Very drinkable for its style, high abv, means you aren't likely to go overboard. Quite tasty, for dessert, or with dessert."
"Roasty sweet carbs. Heavenly for those who want their cake and drink it, too. Thanks to pournutha1 for the sample."
"This is one beautiful stout. It pours a dark black color with a dark brown head on top. The head stays for a spell and slowly gives way to a thin sticky lace. The aroma is of burnt coffee, deep roasted malt and a slight sweetness in the air. There is also a faint wisp of alcohol roaming around. The taste is wonderful; Deep roasted malt combined with the coffee and the hints of sweetness (plum, raisin?) attack the tongue. There is a slight warming of the lips with a slight presence of the alcohol. Also present is a smooth creamy feeling in the mouth. It is a very enjoyable and defiantly easy to drink. I need to get more before it is all gone!"
"Dark, almost black with beautiful creamy brown head. Smells of malt, smoke and alcohol...nicely blended. Taste is strong on alcohol, but tempered well with a nice malty, chocolate-smoky flavor. Mouthfeel was good, but high alcohol content reminded you to sip. For a high abv, extremely drinkable....a definite strong stout all should try."
"Just incredible. The other 5 of these lovelys are going to the cellar for a while. Thanks to JahNoth for the hookup."
"Taste lives up to the smell. Sweet nutty chocolate gives way to bitter roasted malt. Hint of nutmeg. Big beer. Lingers on the back of the tongue. One of the better stouts I have tasted."
"Not an overly complex Imperial, but a nice stout."
"Thick coffee black with an equally thick cocoa brown head. Heavy roasted overtones mixed with the perfect amount of chocolate sweetness in the aroma. Very thick and creamy in your mouth, as it should be. Heavily roasted and chocolaty sweet at the same time. Hops are present, leaving a leafy aftertaste near the back. Extremely enjoyable beer, very highly recommended. A different take on the style, but right up there with the best of them. Thanks again to francisweizen for this and the other Brooklyn brews!"
"Drinkability: This is unusually drinkable. The 8.5% will knock your socks off if you have a few but you don't notice it much when you drink it. This is dangerously delicious and drinkable."
"Notes- Great beer for coffee lovers who have healthy livers. Not a beer for session drinking. I could see myself enjoying this with a nice bowl of Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream."
"Pours a deep,dark black with a nice almond colored head that leaves great lacing,the aroma is very coffeeish and slightly bitter sweet.A real nice complesx beer starts out somewhat earhty and coffeish with a dried fruit flavor comin thru and a hint of dryness in the finish.Very complex,a masterpiece of a beer."
"Dark black color. Large tan head. Aroma is choclately and malty. A full-bodied stout. Roasted chocolate malts, slightly sweet. Coffee and toffee, anise, plums and cherries flavors, but it really chocolaty. Some hop bite. Very nice stout. Well balanced. Smooth and roasty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This brew pours an opaque black colored body with a large creamy head. It had a strong coffee aroma. It also had a strong alcohol flavor with strong coffee notes. I am hoping the chocolate referred to the color and not the flavor because I did not get any chocolate in the flavor."
"This is a beer best enjoyed in limited quantities. It is a complex beer that lingers pleasantly and can be enjoyed long after having been swallowed. Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is not really a thirst quenching beer, but could be easily used as a meal or dessert unto itself."
"This brew is a choc-o-holics delight. The chocolate malts are intense and delicious. Explodes on the palate to deliver a smoky, malty mouthfeel that is exquisite. Just enough alcohol in the back to perk up the taste buds, but not too much. Hops are well defined, but not too spicy. Bravo.."
"Much like last year's, but I think it needs a little more time to mellow. Very hi-octane in the alcohol, and the bitter chocolate notes aren't as defined. Yet..."
"Wow, this is one of the finest representatives of this style available! The beer pours black as night, and a smallish, coffee and roasted malt smelling caramel head ensues and then dissipates quickly. Malt, malt and more malt!! Simply unreal flavor overwhelms the mouth, bursting with chocolate and all things roasted, malty goodness. The finish is all malt with a slight hop kick. Not bitter in the least. Just a sumptuous mouthfeel, and the drinkablilty is supreme with this one, although just make sure you aren't driving after a few of these! I will absolutely seek this out again (and again...)."
"A nice one. Lots of chocolatey roasty malts. The palate is bittersweet, with some sweet chocolate at the start and then a bitter roasty, almost ashy finish. Lots of coffee and choc, with a very long finish. Everything appeared to be in its right place in this beer, really good stuff."
"originally sampled on 24 October 2002. Poured w/ virtually no head. Jet black, slightly bitter on the palate w/ coffee and chocolate flavors. Definitely let this one get slightly warmer than most. I'd like to try this one again, after I'd let it get to 50ish degrees. this one sat on the counter 10 min before opening"
"Luckily I work in Brooklyn so that I can stock up on this brew when it's released. Pours black as night and as the name suggests. Smell is of chocolate (obviously), coffee and also a slight fruity edge. Medium consistency made thicker by extreme chilling. At first the taste is quite overpowering and may turn off most people. Extreme chocolate and roasted flavors with a sweet alcohol laden finish. Realistically you can only drink 2, maybe three max in one sitting due to the severe character. Good choice."
"A big 'thank you' goes out to pbrian for sending me a few of these."
"Overall a very complex and enjoyable chocolate stout. It's big, it's full, it's rich, and it will put a smile on your face. My only change would be to pull back just a bit on the black malt and roasted barley to give the chocolate malts a wee bit more control of the flavor profile. Not enough to make it sweet like a milk stout mind you but just enough to round off the astringent edge. But now I'm just being picky."
"This is a supurb stout and highly enjoyable and I recommend it highly. I am very, very unlucky though, as it is not available here in Minnesota. Hopefully it will cross over the Mississippi some day soon, really soon. Those of you who can readily pick this stuff up, you don't know how lucky you are. Awesome stuff!"
"Poured pitch black with a mocha-colored froth, like motor oil with 200,000 miles since the last change. Softly sweet chocolate malt aroma. Assertive dark-roasted malt bitterness jumps immediately to the back of the tongue - concentrated, cooked-down chocolate, coffee, prune and charcoal flavors dominate. Alcohol actually breaks things up a bit and the finish softens with a slight sourness. A well crafted imperial stout that could easily be raw, but manages to integrate the concentrated flavors quite nicely."
"a huge thanks to frank4sail for the sample!!"
"The color of Black Chocolate Stout was similar to what I imagine the night sky would bleed. It had a huge frothy head and there is lace that is still sticking to the top of my glass. It smelled big and malty with some serious sweet aromas. The taste was like slowly mulled chocolate with a tad bit of bitterness to contrast the sweet caramel and chocolate taste although there was not too much in the way of coffee tastes. Overall a very drinkable stout especially for its high alcohol content."
"P.S. Finishes quite smoothly."
"Utterly absorbent pitch black. Uniform dark russet head settles into a taut layer that leaves sparse, lazy foam trails. Robust, enveloping combination of chocolate malt, smooth, warm, licorice laced alcohol and mellow dark caramel malt nearly saturates the nose. The aroma mellows slightly, allowing both light diacetyl, pruneish dark fruit and molasses to surface and add additional depth. Enticingly complex aromawise. Snap of date like sweetness in flavor is hastily tapered by a concomitant barrage of assertive hop bitterness and deeply burnt, carbonaceous roasted barley. Hints of tart, smokey black malt emerge along with pronounced, yet well rounded cocoaish chocolate mid palate. Subdued citric hop character merges with the pruneish undertone after a long deliberation brightening the overall character late. Fairly well attenuated, with a mouthfeel a notch shy of dextrinous and full. Finishes surprisingly clean, with mild notes of molasses and milk chocolate dried abrupty by clean roasted unmalted barley. Although it lacks the complexity and brute malt character of some other imperials, Black Chocolate possesses unique finesse and superlative drinkability. Worthy of cellaring. Delicious!"
"Blacker than the sight of a rural midnight from under a blindfold. Big brown head. Very aromatic -- chocolate, coffee beans, and black cherries with a light hint of alcohol. Sweet and almost fruit up front -- like a chocolate covered cherry with sweet liquor inside. Big alcoholic finish with a lot of bittersweet notes. A very tasty beer but definitely not one I could consume in mass quantities."
"What a gorgeous beer this is. Pours dark black with a big tan head. Looks like a stout should. I think the word chocolate might through some people off. In fact, I remember a Michael Jackson book that mentioned this achieving it's chocolatey taste with the use of malts. So I don't believe this actually contains chocolate. The aroma is a lot roastier and robust than expected. This is a stout that I expected to be sweet, but the taste is a more dry chocolate taste. I personally would not consider comparing this to Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Although they have similar names, this is a very different beer."
"Pours like the label says: deep and dark--read: black. There a light chocolate brown head and negligible lace after all is said and done. The smell is a little like soy sauce with a hint of hoppy chocolate. The taste was definitely better than the smell--a good, intricately thick imperial stout robustness with a backdrop of musty, hard chocolate. A bit sweet for me on the aftertaste. I like this winter seasonal, though it is not one of my all time favorites."
"Not the kind of beer that you could have several of, but a wonderful imperial stout."
"Bottom line...there are better chocolate beers out there that you can actually taste it...like rogue's...I will NOT buy brooklyn chocolate stout again"
"Thanks, UncleJimbo, I think I liked this one!"
"When I first rated this beer, I thought it was just too rich and powerful. Now I think it is just right."
"This is a great stout. Like the Storm King, I don't imagine anyone seeing it as a session beer. But as a treat - this is a wonderful one."
"Comments: For me it was not as good as it looked. I enjoyed the chocolate malt and espresso flavors but that odd flavor is just not my thing. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the bottle."
"Pitch black pour with a brown medium whipped head that diminishes rather quickly to a thin lacey layer. Aroma of dark chocolate, espresso and some alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee/espresso, light raison and some alcohol make this beer. Light carbonation and a smooth creamy mouthfeel along with its diverse flavors make this a good beer to savor and drink."
"Anyway, it was still good, just not as good as the bottle."
"After many sessions with this beer, lemme tell ya: let this one open up in a snifter, and swirl it around  a great way to end a colder day."
" Nice full bodied beer with a good carbonation level. One very drinkable Imperial. Thanks again Francis."
"Black as night,and that's a great time to drink this beer.this would work great for those who need a little help falling asleep. Black,black and more black, dark brown head and a nice complex aroma profile of espresso,ripe fruit,raisins and cocoa.It has a nice creamy smooth medium body that holds a combo of bitter chocolate and fresh roasted coffee and a nice acidity in the finish.It doesn't have an especially long finish or real complex flavor profile but a strong roasted stout that is very good.And for a imperial, very drinkable."
"Vintage 2002-2003. Pours about as black as moonless, cloudy nite at sea. A pronouced tan head that quickly vanishes, but with linger lacing. A burnt malt aroma is quite noticable. Not suprisingly, the a chocolate and coffee flavor dominates the palate. However, I was disappointed with body and bite of this brew. There appeared to be sourness or acidic finish. May be this brew could benefit with some aging."
"An ' 02-' 03 version, this beer poured a pitch black color and the dark brown head bubbled and faded up the glass like a Guiness! Nice! Chocolates obviously overwhelm the nose as well as roasted malts. The first taste is that of chocolate but some coffee and smokey malts follow. Creamy, creamy mouthfeel that is silky smooth on the tongue, easy going down and very drinkable. Only wish I had more than two. Very nice beer from Brooklyn, which redeemed the last offering, as I know they have great beers."
"Pours into the glass inky dark, almost black. Thin head is dark dark brown, and dissipates quickly. The taste is intense, more like coffee than chocolate. It tastes nearly as strong as their Monster barleywine. This is not a session beer. The taste can be overwhelming to the palate, and two or three bottles will have an impact on your brain. Excellent beer, deep intense flavor. This is a great contribution from the guys in the historic brewery area in Brooklyn."
"Finally I've developed a taste for this beer. I've got the 00-01 season and it is the most enormous beer I've ever had. I'd imagine that there are not too many beers that rival this as far as thickness and maltiness is concerned. It appears as if you're pouring black paint into a pint glass. It is so unbelievably thick. The smell of dark roasted malts and raisins is the best part of this beer for me although the taste is pretty bomb too. Similar malt and raisin notes here with a nice hop balance and hints of dark chocolate. Aftertaste will leave you wanting to drink three or four more of these, brush your teeth, and then pass out from the high ABV, which I'm about to do right now. This is the ultimate beer for a cold winter night."
"This is as well balanced a stout as you will ever have. It is good in every way. Not too sweet or chocolaty, not overly hoppy or malty. Nice taste. Pours black, with a decent sized head, with some retention. Chocolate notes are certainly present, but they do not overwhelm the beer. Alcohol well hidden. This is not a stout that will immediately knock your socks off, but I can't imagine anyone not liking it. Thanks Joe!"
"Backwash: Even my mother liked this! What else can I say?"
"This sturdy stout pours black and has a rocky creamy head. Its remarkable chocolate flavors, derived entirely from the malts (rather than from real chocolate as in some stouts) are well balanced by enough hops to avoid over sweetness. Other detectable flavors light caramel notes and a hit of smokiness from the roasted malts. A cold winter's night feels complete with a pint of Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout."
"The fruity esters and alcohol flavor were a bit of a turn off for me. However, the malty characteristics and smooth mouthfeel make this an enjoyable beer."
"This is a serious, heavyweight beer -- and one that is probably one of the most affordable in beer stores."
"One look at this brew is enough to get you drooling. Pours solid black with a huge deep tan/red (yes, red) head. Smells of burnt coffee & floral hops. The taste is alcohol & chocolate, with some bitter hops in the aftertaste...mmmmmm...but the chocolate is definitely there.Not quite as thick as it looks but still pretty thick. Great brew!!"
"'00-'01: Oh man, put on the seat belt for this one! It's one helluva roasty, toasty, hoppy, strong roller-coaster ride. Black as night, strong as hell! A man's beer for sure! Coronas' drinker's worst nightmare!"
"This is the best Imperial Stout I've ever had. It's appearance is stupendous. Dark black, with a dark red head, that was huge, but after a while it died down. It has a little of a alcohol after taste, but it's hardly noticeable with the chocolatey taste. It's soooo smooth! I couldn't believe how it just ran down my tounge and coated my throat. The fact that it's pretty darn cheap helps too!"
"Black with a dark tan, mocha-colored head that is decorated with an array of swirling browns and peppered with differently sized bubbles. A beautiful beer. The aroma suggests sweet molasses and raisin, with only a hint of chocolate. Alcohol is also present in the nose. The initial flavor displays roasted malt, with what I would describe as dark, even burnt, coffee. The chocolate flavors are at first rather faint, but more noticeable as the beer warms, especially at the back of the palate and in the nasal passages. At no point, however, would I describe this glass of beer as especially chocolately. There is a slight sourness at the finish."
"Inky black with a dark tan head. I found this far tastier than the Luxury Double Chocolate Stought (probably because the Brooklyn is an imperial stout while the latter is not). The chocolate was also far more apparent in this beer. Of course other flavors were present: coffee, etc. The mouthfeel was not quite as good as the Young's, although it was certainly quite good. This is definitely a beer that must be respected, and too much of it at once is not a good idea."
"This beer fooled me with it's name. I didn't know it was one of my beloved Imperial Stouts I hadn't tried. Well, it poured like a Guiness, black as night and a rolling foaming dark tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of burnt malt, coffee and chocolate, which seems to be the most powerful aspect. Might account for the name. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. It had a medium body and a bit of sourness to the finish. This is one that may do better with some cellaring. A good imperial, but not up there with Expedition or Stone."
"My second tasting of this wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first. The aroma was more astringent, and the alcohol aroma and feel in the mouth was much stronger and less pleasant."
"2003-2004: Not as strong as previous years offerings. A light chocolate aroma with a bit of booze, and some hops. The taste is of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, and booze. The mouthfeel is thick, and the drinkability is nice. Stick with the 02-03 if you an still get some...."
"This beer poured into the glass black, no light penetrated the glass. Well carbonated and had to wait a few minutes until the head settled to the top. The head was a thick creamy dark beige brown color and lasted quite a long time. The aroma was of chocolate, chocolate, coffee, raisins, alcohol and some roasted chocolate. The taste was nice and creamy. Flavors of chocolate and coffee seemed to dance together throughout the mouthful, but I did notice that chocolate seemed to lead. I also noticed that during the ballet in my mouth the raisins and alcohol would try to cut in on the other two dancing and seemed to get in a step or two, first raisins, then alcohol, then raisins again before the other would ask for there partner back. At the end alcohol seemed to get the last dance with the chocolate. I personally loved this limited edition 02-03 beer. I am on the hunt for a few more to keep and cellar can I can imagine that this beer can only get better with time."
"The best Imperial I've had to date. After I've tried a few more that I can't currently get my hands on (like Stone), I'll revisit this review and make sure I didn't get overwhelmed. For a full account of my opinions of the beer, check out my article on the mini-Imperial Stout Challenge..."
"Gracias Frank!"
"very rich and smooth with very little carbonation, this is just great to drink. there is not a lot of chocolate in the flavor, but there is a great presence of hops that makes it very interesting. coffee and burnt malts dominate the flavor. this is one fine stout."
"Well first off let me wait until this giant head 3 inch chocolate colored head dies down a bit before I taste it.Let me talk about the pour while I'm waiting.If I had a regular pint glass instead of 20oz it would of spilled all over the place.It looked and sounding like motor oil being poured.Looked similar to chocolate milk and then turned black as night.I've waited 6 minutes and the head has just died down to about an inch so I can taste it.Whheeew thats strong..Its creamy and smooth like drinking pure butter.The head looks like ice cream floating in a milk shake.It tastes strong of coffee and the darkest richest chocolate there is.This is the winter 02-03 edition..Extremely malty and thick..Left a brown lace all the way up my glass.Has a bite on the finish of alcohol.The strongest stout I've ever had! Has kind of a Sam Adams triple bock smell and taste.Very syrupy with almost a wine style taste and extremely high in alcohol.This is not a beer you can drink all night.One of these and you'll be ready to switch.Save for aging or special occasions."
"You open this bottle up and you pour out a thick, pitch black liquid, and you wonder if you are going to be consuming used motor oil. The cascade of tan bubbles (ala Guinness) lets you know that you have a treat ahead of you. A substantial head builds up, creamy on top, course underneath. It'll eventually die down to a quarter inch leaving rememberances of lace along the glass. The aroma is one of my favorite parts of this beer. Chocolately, fruity, winey, with some alcohol presence... makes you just want to take a taste. Initially thin feeling, this beer thickens and becomes creamy as it moves to the back of your mouth. Sweet, dark fruits, and rich dark chocolate bathe the mouth, followed by a roasted grain and wisps of alcohol finish as you swallow. Simply an amazing beer. What would this beer be like in a year?"
"Has a very hoppy flavor which is quite enjoyable, and a mild chocolate flavor follows with a bit of alcohol as well. This is an excellent stout!"
"Pours a syrupy onyx with a thick, coarse-bubbled brown head. Aromas of rich ripe fruit and mocha sweetness. Light carbonation, and a sort of chewy mouthfeel. Tangy on the tongue to start, then you get a wave of baker's chocolate and roasted coffee flavors, with some caramel malty sweetness. Pleasantly astringent and raw, without being too harsh. More roasted flavors punctuate a medium-length finish. A heck of a winter seasonal--warms you right up."
"Slight smell of roast cocoa and hops along with a slight tingle of ABV in the sinus. Big black opeque brew with a thick lasting creamy brown head. This head is sticky and lasting. Big expresso, bitter chocolate, and bitter hops taste. Big, full, smooth mouth with a dry finish. Complex bold taste in layers on the tongue. If you have not noticed in this review the key term here is BIG. It almost overwhelmes but does not. Great tasting, great looking, great beer! I will cellar one if these Winter 02-03..."
"A memorable beer."
"I guess I love imperial stouts, and I really love this one. The color and consistency is like used motor oil - real black, and the head is dark brown and thick. The smell is chocolate, coffee, and red wine and the taste has those aspects as well, with a slight ABV burn that warms you up. Pretty drinkable as far as the style goes. This has to be the best bargain in beer."
"This beer was great and will buy this one again."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. One of the top 5 beers I tried at the festival. Pours how you would expect liquid dark chocolate to pour. Surprisingly lively tongue with chocolate (duh), clover and well-masked alcohol flavor. This is great stuff!"
"Note:  I did a linear tasting of 4 years (98-99, 99-00, 00-01, and 01-02).  I found that the beer is best between 2-3 years old and the alcohol presence mellows as it gets older."
"Pours an ink black color, deep coffee colored head, and lots of lace that clings to the glass. Rich malt aroma with chocolate and espresso. Full bodied with creamy mouthfeel--this is a big stout. Starts malt sweet with chocolate, cocoa, perhaps bitter sweet chocolate is a better description, and umm..chocolate. The middle is full, creamy, rich, thick, and hearty. Finishes dry, spicy and has some notes of espresso. The bitterness in this brew comes from the roasted malt, hop presence is not noticeable. Alcohol makes itself known as it warms you on the way down. Pretty damn drinkable for such a big and potent beer."
"Pours very thick, dark black with a brown creamy head.  Smells and taste of rich roasted malt with hints of cocoa and coffee.  If this brew contained a stronger hop presence it would rival Storm King."
" Cremy and warming."
"This is my favorite winter beer, without a doubt.  A couple of these in the fridge are the perfect answer to the snowstorms which are only a matter of time."
"'02-'03: wow, I read yen157's review and picked up a few of these at the beer store earlier. Its a wonderful stong stout with a nice choclate aftertaste with a strong flavor of burnt malts and some coffee taste in there. It poured a BEAUTIFUL fluffy head with a unique ruby tint that shined through the heavy lace it left on the glass. Its is dark, i mean really DARK, almost the color of tar or oil but that ruby tinted head makes it a very attractice beer. I didn't notice much of an alcohol taste immediatly, but once the beer warmed a little, it was evident no so much by the taste but the feelign of my noise. I did not detract from its drinkablility rating due to its heaviness; I assume that if you drinking this you like imperial stouts, but due to it's alcohol taste that i guess just comes along with a beer that's 10.6abv. Besides that, its a wonderful beer and if you're a strong stout lover you will love this, try it."
"'02-'03: I've waited months for this to come out. Finally, it's here. Available from October through March, this is a real treat if it's available in your area. This beer poured ink black with a nearly cardboard-brown head. It smelled of chocolate, burnt grains, malt, and strangely enough, strawberries. As for flavors, it had a charcoal (probably from black patent malt), chocolate, malt, and alcohol. It had a burnt toast / charcoal aftertaste. The bitterness from the hops combined well with the bitter and slightly sour taste from the blackened grains. Excellent! Once again, this beer will top my list for the coming months."
"'01-'02: Pours perfectly black with a beautiful deep tan head. The head is slow to form and disspipates quickly however. The Aroma is chocolate, espresso, burnt toast with a bit of fruitiness that makes it seem like the burnt toast has jelly or jam on it. The aroma floods the nose and starts the salivary glands. Burnt toast flavor and a thin bitterness from the hops dominate early on switching to espresso and unsweetened black chocolate later on and a lingering, bitter finish. That's while cold. When closer to room temperature the flavors mellow with the sharp burnt and espresso bitterness become less sharp sliding under a sweeter more chocolately taste. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, but not as thick or gritty as some other imperials. One of the lighter beers of the style."
"Winter '00-'01, which makes this roughly a year old at this point. This beer is possibly the best ""bottled"" beer from Brooklyn - I think we all know that the non-contract draft beer coming out of the brewery is much better! This beer pours a very dark brown/black with ruby highlights. There's a nice, light tan/brown head around the rim of the glass, although no Belgian-lace is produced. The aroma is of a bittersweet chocolate and candyish malt, but without hops, which is OK for the style. The flavor starts with alot of chocolate and roastiness followed by a clear alcohol, a bit of hop flavor, and eventually mellowing into very nice coffee notes. The finish is really wonderful! The carbonation level is appropriate and the body is nice. There are no off-notes to speak of. Overall, a very nice example of the style, although I distinctly remember prior year's samples as having a bit more malt and a somewhat smoother character. I hope this will mellow a bit, but I also fear it may pick up some innapropriate oxidative flavors."
"'01-'02: This is a pretty good stout.  The only downside is that it is not as chocolatey as I would have thought.  Other than that, the aroma (coffee maybe), color (pitch black), and head (not too thick), which makes this stout a decent pick.  Another solid brew from the Brooklyn Brewery."
"'01-'02: Starts by pouring a jet black, your unable to see through it, with a nice dark tan head that settles with deep fluffy pockets. On the nose there are aromas of roasted malts, several tones of dark chocolate with the alcohol poking through also. Exactly the same can be found on the palate, with a bit of alcohol warming from the back of the throat to the gut...a slow sipper. A nice winter brew / imperial stout.  Pretty sweet... but enjoyable for me."
"'01-'02: I really look forward to this every winter.  This past year I split a case with a friend.  I loved it, he still has a few.  For me, this is perfect when I only want to drink just one brew and chill out for the night.  It is heavy and strong - just the way it should be."
"Me being me, I had the bartender give me a 5 oz. glass and mixed this half-and-half with Middle Ages Druid Fluid barleywine. THAT rounded the flavor out."
"'02-03: To the above, I will add a big heaping of dark fruits, particularly raisins."
"A nice chocolate aroma, a deep chocolate flavor.  Poured smoothly and had a decent foam time.  Would like to try it on nitro."
"'01-'02: This is the first time I've tried it so I can't compare to previous years. Initial taste is alcoholic, although other flavors quickly surround it upon subsequent sips. Great mouthfeel, heavy but not sluggish; sticky, but not cloying. Head did not last as long as I would have liked. Overall satisfying, though, and I would very much like to shelf it and taste it again down the road."
"'01-'02: A bedtime treat.  Nice burnt coffee/cocoa flavors.  Viscous mouthfeel that I believe could be balanced with a little more hops.  Finishes with a warming acidic burnt malt bitterness.   Aging usually rounds out the rough corners, but it's still good complex brew young."
"'01-'02: My first experience with a Brooklyn Brewery product.  (Not that it factored into the rating, but it has a great classy looking bottle)..Smells of high alcohol, and has a bit of a high alcohol taste to it...Nice imperial though...very rich and thick but nowhere close to Belle's Expedition in this area...tastes of bakers chocolate thanks to some nice complex blackened malts...(I don't believe this beer adds any real chocolate to it)..I had heard a lot of positives about this brewery, and my first experience is a good one...Above average Imperial Stout.."
"Notes: Best consumed at cellar temperature, alcohols are a bit too much and if the oxidation could hold out for a year or more this beer will mellow out to be a great vintage brew."
"Excellent beer... I haven't had an aged one, but I have split a 12oz with a friend and I must say, throughly tasty. Very strong in the ""roasted"" section, mild hop bitterness, and a sweet chewiness. The finish was slightly too alcoholic for me, the vapors alone cleared my sinuses... but all in all, great Imperial."
"'00-'01: What a brew!  I saved a bottle from last year and it evolved into an even more spectacular beer.  It's like velvet, but sweet and with a kick.  You can't go wrong."
"'00-'01: Simply one of the best Imperial stouts."
"Boldest, most complex stout I've had to date. Enhances chocolate desserts immensely."
"An incredibly tasty and powerful stout. Best use of chocolate malt that I've ever seen for the style. It's high alcohol and rich flavours also make it a perfect canditate for aging. Have a 99-00 that I am waiting to review. Yummy stuff."
