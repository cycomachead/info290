"O: Smooth is the word for this one. Worth the price for any stout drinker. The ""2012"" edition I drank even came in a collectible re-cappable bottle. I liked that it was already bottle aged for me so I didn't have to cellar it for optimal drinking."

"O. Rouge did a very good job making this imperial stout. I recommend giving it a try. Hard ass buzz for 11% ABV."

"Overall: I'm not a great fan of this beer but I like the Rogue brand and would not be turned away from their brews. Thats why we have Baskin Robins and 32 flavors my friends, not everyone is going to love everything, overall not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it seems like a clash of flavors that don't really do it for me. It's not horrible but it's nothing like what I was expecting. So where's the malt and chocolate for starters? Oh well, glad to have tried it, not all is lost."

"Overall - While a near perfect example of the Russian Imperial style, I can't imagine buying this again for such a steep price; not when 4 packs of Old Raspy are out there for half the cost. This is better than Old Raspy; it's not 400% better (about the cost per ounce difference), nor is it better than their Double Chocolate Stout, which is about 40% cheaper. Basically what I'm saying is, this'll probably be the last time I buy it, lest I find it on tap. Love the aftertaste."

"O - This was a 2012 vintage given to me by my brother for Christmas to sway me on Rogue. It didn't work. I don't get the brewery or the beers they produce. This could pass for a poorly constructed black IPA. It just lacks what makes a great stout. Some odd smells and flavors. This tries to be different and succeeds but fails in doing so."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, pine, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness; with a bit of booze. Nice aromas with solid balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy/pine hop notes; with good strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, char, molasses, light toffee, pine, floral, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, char, molasses, light toffee, pine, floral, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate earthy/pine hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick and moderately chalky/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and earthy/pine hops; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Edit 2015.  Had the chance to try it fairly fresh on tap and I thought it was pretty close to being average all the way around, not impressed with this one."

"Fantastic beer, but this was actually kind of a sad moment for me. I had been holding onto this for a special occasion and opened this by accident thinking it was a Rogue Dead Guy XS. Disappointing that I couldn't let this rest for longer but fortunately able to share it with some other appreciative tasters. Wonderful stout, some bitterness and tons of roasty-ness that I love. A bit sweet and sticky, but not unusually so for the style. And I love the ceramic bottles. Must try."

"A trip to most decent liquor stores in Calgary will feature the usual wallet murderers row of suspects from Rogue. I have yet to spy a bottle of this one in Calgary but lo and behold it is currently available at Beer Revolution. Ordered a full 12 oz. in the hopes that I could still walk out afterwards, a nearly pitch black murk with the odd hint of ruby red and thick tan foam. Apparently this brew includes two ""secret ingredients"" and oddly enough the first aroma to greet me was something much like coriander seed, a citrus-like spice. Hmmm. The more expected dark coffee and chocolate sauce aromas then arrived along with earthy and citrus rind hop notes and faint smoke that brought ham to my mind. Less spicy alcohol burn than some imperial stouts I've enjoyed but this one has its own charms. Taste is an initial spike of burnt sugar, followed by cacao powder, dry wood, cigar tobacco, walnuts, and some dark pressed coffee although I find the chocolate and woody spice notes more prominent than any sort of dark roasted coffee flavor. Also rather unique is a strong undercurrent of grapefruit rind-evoking hops and oily resins, almost like a dark IPA in this regard. This citrus rind became more salient as I made my way through the pint. Certainly quite a thick and chewy beer although more fizzy than some other imperial stouts which somehow lightens up the mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy like an oatmeal stout. The fusel alcohol burn does reveal itself but again I found this one to be less boozy than something like Lagunitas Imperial. Noteworthy and certainly worth snagging if you can. Interesting in terms of hitting certain elements from other styles, bringing to mind various aspects of dark IPAs (hops), Belgian ales (spice), and of course the blackest and thickest of the stout/porter clan."
"O - I was expecting a big bold stout and that exactly what was delivered, very tasty yet mellow in terms of feel and the alcohol is not at all noticeable (may have faded a little over 2-3 years), a worthy candidate for a milestone review"

"Overall: A pretty flavor packed RIS, a little more bitterness than I generally prefer but still a pretty solid example of the style."
""
""
"O- Little penis man sent me this as an extra. Its meh"
"Wow! I haven't had this fresh but this is still pretty harsh. Nice aroma but the roasted coffee/malts, mixed with the resinous hop oils make for a stout and astringent drink. I'm very surprised the hop oils are still very bitter. 4 years has not mellowed this out. This could go for at least 2 to 3 more years. Wish I had another one of this vintage."

"Overall- Very happy that this beer came out so good. This was more or less my first attempt at ""cellering"" a beer (bought it around this time last year). Very nice flavor. Nice night cap."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice RIS. It's big, heavy and slick. Just the way I like an RIS, with pure heavy roasted malt character. Lots of black patent malt and chocolate for sure. A lot can have dark fruits in them but not this one. Only addition is a little bit of hops to break it up. Probably a lot hoppier when it's fresh, if I'm honest. Not sure if that would be an improvement or not - will have to seek one out someday. Very tasty overall, I found it very similar to brooklyn BCS but with a little less chocolate."

"Got a 7oz bottle of this from Tacoma Boys. It's called 'Russian Imperial Stout' on the label. Pours almost like motor oil. Incredible appearance. Very lively and inviting. Big light brown head that sustains for the entire beer, and leaves nice lacing down sides of glass. Dark brown color. Sweet earthy fragrance with an almost light fruitiness. THICK feel. Beer could be a meal I believe. Coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Little alcohol in the flavor as well but it's not overpowering. Pretty bitter aftertaste that lingers. Lightly carbonated. Great beer. Only flaws for me were it could be a little sweeter, and that its syrupy."

"O: good stuff, glad its in a big bottle. Glad I got this. All around a good stout."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is an extremely dark black-ish coloring with a towering, foamy, dense, tan coloring that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Clings all over the glass as you quaff. Aromas of molasses and old world fruit sweetness, brown sugar, coffee, oak and earth, and a hint of booze. Very rich, dynamic nose. Flavors are very rich, with a coffee and bourbon-like blending initially. Very sweet and roasted, with rich, darkly sweet undertones supporting a touch of bitterness from the coffee notes and a solid booze component. Smooth and heavy in mouth, with a rich, velvety feel. The aftertaste is a bit more boozey, with heavier presence from the wood and earth components to balance out all the sweet and rich. Avoids cloying throughout the entire palate. Very heavy, very big beer. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This started off as being a truly great beer, too bad the boozy characteristics hurt this at the end. It would have been a sipper anyway at 11.0% ABV, but the finish made me sip it extra slow."
""
""
""

"Pours a thick jet black with creamy dark brown head. Looks great, but then, what the hell is this? This is the hoppiest, most bitter imperial stout I have ever tried, by far. Everything I love about this style is hidden behind those hops. It probably has more in common with a strong black ale than a typical Imperial stout. The feel wasn't that smooth, even for a nitro, but that could be an effect of the bitter flavor. I don't know, some people will like it (apparently - it's got an outrageous score on BA) and maybe a bottle will age well, but I'm really disappointed with it and frustrated that it cost so much."
""
""
"Tastes decent, this has aged nicely...loads of chocolate, plenty of roast and a leafy hop presence that is really nice, yet unexpected after 4 years. Interesting beer, glad to have it, but at $16 a bottle, dont think Id buy it again."

"O: 4.0 Its a decent beer and purely bought it on its age but for the $4.75 for a 7oz i think i got caught up in the date and the style. I would seek it out again but its an interesting experience."
""
""
""
"Poured into shaker pint glasses because that's all we have at the lake cottage. Pours thick and black. The narrow neck of the bottle causes some ""glugging"" as it pours. A decent head sticks to the glass quite well. Big chocolaty aroma entices. The taste very much follows the aroma. Chocolate malt flavors, roasted barley, and yes, even after four years, hops, dominate. This is very smooth. Drinks extremely well. I opened a bottle a year ago and it was not near this good. The extra year has been a good thing. If anyone has any more of these, they are drinking very well. If I had another, I would hold on, just to see what one more year does, but this is really good right now."

"Broke down and bought one of the fancy XS 2011 bottles. Poured a completely opaque black color, with a generous 2 finger light brown creamy head. Smell was a bit of brown sugar sweet, with a hint of lactose. Flavor was a bit on the bitter side. Not overly so, but enough to have a bit of a bite. A bit of a smokey grain undertone as well. Felt great in the mouth. Coated extremely well, with just a hint of carbonation. Overall the price killed this. A good beer at maybe 5-7 for a bomber, not worth the price and markup for the ceramic bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This really was damn good. Bravo, Rogue! I didn't know you had it in you!"
"Overall – A nice drier imperial, although not the best out there. While it could use a touch more sweetness and the aroma is a little lacking is does have some nice flavors and is well worth a try."
""
"C-"
""
""
"a flat dark pour with barely any head. aromas of bourbon, vanilla, coffee.. very boozy. tastes of coffee and booze.. not much else is present due to the overwhelming alcohol taste. medium bodied, minimal carbonation.. definitely a sipper, due to the booziness of it. i was honestly disappointed in this one. maybe it was aged for too long? barely any flavor aside from the booze, appearance was very blah. the only thing i think i like is the smell.. and the ceramic bottle it came in."
"Pours a two finger brown head that fades quickly to ring leaving traces lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate and caramel nose, flavor is similar, chocolate, caramel and coffee. Burnt coffee finish. High ABV is hidden. $4.35 for a wussy 7oz bottle from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
""
""
""
"O- I know a lot of people hate on Rogue, I tend to enjoy all their offerings. They are overpriced and this is no exception but this is a home run. My only beef is the super burnt taste, not really necessary."
""
"Overall: I have had many imperial stouts and this beer barely made my too ten. If you have money to burn drink it, if you have you're favorites imperial drink that instead it would be hard for this to live to that standard."
""
""
""
"O: Awesome imperial stout. A nice sipping beer @ 11 % alcohol by volume. This might be my favorite beer my Rogue – but at $25 a bottle it more of a luxury than a regular beer I would drink."
"O: Not a bad RIS, but not my favorite. A nice opportunity to try this bottle on the West Coast. I haven't seen this around too much. If you are looking to drink an RIS, this would sit somewhere in the middle."
""
""
"Highly recommended!"
""
"Overall, a fairly complex beer that could benefit from some age to tame the alcohol a bit. The burnt character could use some mellowing, as well. Having that charred flavor at the finish kinda wrecks the beer."
""
"O: A good RIS. I really like Rogue and this stout is quality stuff. Putting it up against other stouts though, it doesn't measure up....but still good and worth trying."
""
""
"Overall I think this is very nice. Good example of the style. Will buy again."
""
"I debated between each sip how to rate this thing. Im still at a loss. Very hoppy stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall too bitter and boozy for my tastes."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, but a bit over the top. Not very drinkable, a bit boozy, burnt roast, a little acrid, and astringent finish. I'm usually an imperial stout fan but this seems to go a bit over the top in the wrong places, as most Rogue beers seem to do for me."
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer but will probably not buy it again, $5 for a 6oz bottle? It's not that good."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid beer. It competes with some of the better imperial stouts but could be a little more stiff with flavor and feel."
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad it was only a 7oz bottle, not sure I would have wanted much more. Just a bit too roasty for my liking."
"We both liked the 2009 better because of its body and taste."
""
""
"Overall this beer was very enjoyable. After two years it has retained some really nice hop flavor while the alcohol presence has cooled down. Complex, tasty and deceptively drinkable."
""
"O - This is certainly a sipping drink. It is both delicious and intimidating, but certainly worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer would work more for me if the sweetness was toned down a bit. Otherwise, a pretty decent imperial stout. I find Rogue's beers to be good but not great. This beer is no exception."
""
""
""
""
"Although this is a really good beer, you can find equally as good beers for less or much better beers for the same price to a little less."

"D/O: This is a strong and straight-forward stout, simplistic in the qualities it presents and not particularly enjoyable. Style-appropriate flavors are in ready supply, yet their combined mass oppresses the palate, inducing fatigue. Some evidence that well-aged beers don't always get easier to drink."
""
"Poured 7 oz bottle into a 13 oz tulip, very aggressive pour. Pours a opaque black, with a fluffy mocha head, that hangs out a while. Very solid lacing. Smell is a very strong burnt expresso with some hints of dark fruits and some alcohol. Taste is similar, but a very pungent dark chocolate steps out, maybe a little more booze then the nose lets on. This is a very roasty and assertive stout, that is on the large size body and flavor. Nice carbonation considering its ABV and fairly easy drinking for its large size."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours pitch black with a voluminous light brown head, quite creamy and dense. Excellent lacing and moderate retention. Nose of deep dark fruits, black cherries, currants, some raisin, plum. Touch of chocolate, and no alcohol surprisingly. Nice. Taste turns the tables, super bitter and roasty coffee. Deep dark chocolate, and a dry finish. Lengthy roastiness, and some sweet molasses near the end of the sip as well. Slightly sticky, but still quite dry. Pretty heavy body, and low carbonation. Absolutely no alcohol here, which is a feat for the ABV. Quite a nice roasty and bitter stout, that has stood up for at least 2 years, and could go longer I'd bet. 7oz is a perfect serving size."
"I'm going to have compare this to a fresh one, but this vintages is pretty tasty. I'm glad one of my trading buddies hooked me up with this brew."
"O - Just average for me. The smell and taste are mostly balanced expect for one element (different in each case) that seems to overwhelm just about everything else that is there, killing the subtle nuances that exist in the background. Glad to try it, but not something I will likely be seeking out in the future."
"Pours a thick opaque black with a small dense 1/2 inch dark khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random small spots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and a sharp alcohol aroma. I am also getting some molasses and graham cracker aromas as the beer warms. Taste is of bitter roasted malt, roasted coffee grounds, bitter cocoa powder, and some bitter hops on the finish. The bitterness is pretty assertive and sticks around on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a thick and somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is simply a pretty good RIS with a pronounced bitterness on the tongue. Not bad per se but I probably wouldn't go for one of these again."
"O: One thing that bothers me about many American microbreweries is their tendency to exaggerate certain characteristics of a particular style, or in this case, to bring in elements from other styles that have no place in the style they're trying to replicate. Stouts are not supposed to be this hoppy regardless of strength. While this is an interesting effort that is bound to delight extreme beer enthusiasts, the traditional qualities of an imperial stout come off as being rather muted. I see this as a missed opportunity."
"O: never been impressed with a Rogue beer. This one is the same. Good beer, but for the price - I think it was $12 for a 22 oz - there are hundreds of amazing beers. Founders Imperial Stout blows this away, and that's the last one I had. So..."
"A blend of teriyaki, baker's chocolate and cold espresso, the beer is rich and also forcefully strong, likely too much for most palates. Indeed, Rogue's Imperial Stout has every bit as much character as the brewery publicizes; small bottles can still pack plenty of strength and flavour and make an ideal serving size for a beer of this scope and stature."
"The taste is nice easy chocolate and roasted coffee as well as hints of leather at the end. very nice I would love to try this with some age on it."
"OVERALL: This is a good imperial stout, and though I've never had it fresh, it seems to be aging just fine. While the nose could be a little more forthcoming and the palate a bit bigger, the flavor is definitely a good example of the style. It’s too bad this one is so expensive for such a little bottle, as there are plenty of other great imperial stouts at a better price point. It’s one and done for this one, but it was worth checking out."
"O - This is a very nice RIS, and the age has led to very smooth brew. One of the better Rogue offerings."
"O: Well, it’s great. Damn! I was secretly hoping this one would have something strikingly bad about it, so the decision to spend over $6.00 on another 7 oz. bottle would be easy. It turns out that it’ll probably call to me again, despite its hefty price. Oh well, it'll be money well spent. Even after a couple years of age, Rogue’s RIS is as hoppy and rewarding as ever."
"Not as thick as I would have expected in the mouthfeel, but not a big deal. Excellent RIS, and I highly recommend it."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and slightly creamy with carbonation being low. Overall a pretty solid beer of the style. The sweetness and bitterness seemed pretty well balanced. Very enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"Overall... The flavors are definitely lacking here. Other overall experience could be better. Maybe it's my feeble palate, but I expected more here (especially for five bucks for an XS bottle). The better and much harder to find alternative is the Founders KBS."
"Hard pour resulted in one finger light brown head medium dissipation with minimal lacing over dark brown opaque body. Nose features good dose of cocoa nib light chocolate aroma, citrus hops subsumed by malt. Taste is fairly chocolatey, some roast, citrus hops in the middle leading to fairly piney resin finish. Mouthfeel a bit on the heavy side of medium, decent effervescence. Not bad, but at this price point won't be purchasing again, not all that great, I'd rather grab a 4-pack of Old Rasputin."
"O - A good beer but I think I would want to buy this and cellar it for a few years to mellow out some of it's harsh edges."
"Rolled oats, free range coastal water [Ed: whatever that means], and Pacman yeast."
"Thanks"
"Overall. Nice RIS. Bitter and hoppy but not without all the things a good ris should have."
"Poured out from a mini bottle which I wasn't much of a fan of. The beer poured out jet black with a nice brown head on top. The lacing was decent on this beer. The smell was boozy and very roasted. The taste had some rich dark chocolate with coffee in there. It's also got some nice toasted boozy flavors going on in there. The mouthfeel was pretty thick which I liked a lot. Overall this beer is one of the better Rogue brews out there. I'd like to get it in 12oz. bottles though."
"Not impressed. The roastiness needs to be tamed and some additional complexities introduced."
"O: The nose and mouthfeel were nice, but the flavor was fairly off-putting, unfortunately."
"O: Not a bad stout, but I'm expecting a little more out of an 11% stout aged over a year. Too hot and the flavor profile could use a little work. I have a 2008 that I'm hoping will be a little more mellow."
"O- Overall, this is a great Beer."
"Drinkability - despite the how huge it is, it hides the alcohol pretty well. I wish it came in a 12oz bottle, though a bomber would be over the top (maybe)."
"O: This one reminded me a lot of Duck Rabbit's ""Rabid Duck"" only much thinner and less memorable. That price tag on this one was a bit much to my mind..."
"Overall, this is one of the best example of the style, hands down."
"Rogue Imperial Stout is a legendary beer. Back in the day, this beer was a mainstay in the BA Top 100. Frankly, I’m extremely impressed with it. Yeah, it’s a little pricy and isn’t quite as legendary as it used to be, but it’s very much worth a purchase. It’s just one of those beers that every BA should try at some point. In a word…classic."
"D: The body of this beer has held up well. Even better then I anticipated. It's similar to an aged Bell's Expedition. A great reason to experiment with cellaring, and certainly one that I feel would continue to hold up for a little longer. Well done Rogue."
"Overall there's lots of flavor, but the package doesn't really work together for me. I think it could likely be much improved with some time in the cellar."
"Certainly a tasty beer, but in need of more malty flavours for balance. The end result is nice enough, but probably nearer black IPA than Imperial Stout."
"A decent RIS, pretty flavorful and drinkable."
"Pours jet black, one finger of tan/brown head, some lacing on the glass. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and an almost hop like bitterness. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burnt and roasted malt, slightly hoppy, nice long bitter finish. Full mouthfeel, nice light carbonation, good weight that coats the mouth well. Fantastic brew, ABV not noticeable in taste but it is certainly there, the age on this helped big time. Great stuff."
"Vintage 2009- Pours a dark black w/ a one finger chocolate head that quickly goes away. This is a 2 year old beer, and hopefully it will be aged enough. Smell is that of alcohol, chocolate, coffee. Taste is nice- tons of hops, barley, chocolate, coffee are present. The mouthfeel is the weak link here. As an 11% beer, I want this to be thicker, and more silky than it is. Ultimately it's a little on the thin side w/ hops/barley exploding in your mouth. Not smooth in spite of the 2 yrs. of age. All in all this is a good beer that falls just short of greatness for me. Definitely a worthwhile drink though, and glad I got to try this one!"
"All and all a pretty darn good beer. Nothing exceptional or amazing. I give Rogue an extra half point for putting this in a 7oz bottle so I can drink a second beer tonight without being too tipsy."
"O - A great stout. All the expected nuances like malt, wood, roasted grain. Nice and dry like an irish stout but spicy and potent like a Russian Imperial. Seems like 8 years didn't smooth or mellow this beer much but its a nice pop on the taste buds. Great choice for a roasty warm stout."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a thin khaki colored head which leaves some lace. The aroma is a little weak, there is no boozy aroma just some caramel malts and dark chocolate in their and that is faint. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with a little dark chocolate and a little dark fruit, but not the big flavor I was expecting. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated and not slick due to the higher alcohol content. Overall I was a little disappointed I felt that it had a decent flavor and smell but wasn't as big as I would have hoped for in a russian stout."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. From inspecting the label it states that this is best enjoyed after aging it for a year. Since in was bottled in 2009 and its now 2011 I hope it was cared for properly. No matter how it was taken care of it was a good beer and I would recommend picking one up if you like dark IPA's."
"To be honest, my first thought (this morning, not at the time of purchase) on seeing the $16.49 price tag stuck to the side of the ceramic bottle was... 'no way it's worth that'. Well, boys and girls, it is. If limited to one hand to count the best RISs to have ever entered my glass, Rogue Imperial Stout is easily worth one finger."
"D: The flavors are not consistent enough to give this a full-bodied flavor. Nevertheless, it's not bad. Pairing with a vanilla dessert would probably go over well."
"D - being that they are only 7 ounce bottles, I could have a couple... but the price hurts it too. Better options available for less money."
"Good job Rogue! Full bodied but this one is over two years old."
"It's not bad, but it's a little too bitter for my tastes. I prefer Old Rasputin, which I think has about 10 fewer IBUs. This one might go well with a sweet chocolate-flavored dessert, though."
"Pours a jet black, tan head. Some lace down the glass. Aroma is light, charred malts and a little booze. Follows through to the flavor, big roasted malt, light coffee, decent hop presence lending a bit of pine to the equation. A little alcohol, some dark chocolate. Full bodied feel and a big beer but fairly smooth. I would have it again but not for the price or the rediculously small bottle."
"Overall I was hoping for a bit more. Perhaps my expectations were raised by the packaging. I did enjoy the beer but would have like more points of interest."
"D-Pretty boozy, and hoppier than I remember. Still, I enjoyed this one. It took me till the end of the bottle to really appreciate it."
"D: A great RIS for sure, but doesn't compare to many of the RIS behemoths out there. I am happy they finally decided to package in something other than the obscenely expensive ceramic 22's. I hate paying for packaging."
"D - The chocolate fruit opening keeps you sipping but the dry cocoa bitterness really slows you down."
"D - say what you want about Rogue, the one thing they have done wonderfully is package this bit of a gem in a 7oz bottle. add that to the lack of detectable alcohol and you have a solid RIS. doesnt have the complexity or barrel-aging hype of others but doesnt need it. cheers!"
"D: Pretty good, but not great. I like my stouts more on the roasty/malty side of the roasty malt - hoppy/bitter side of the equation; the lingering bitterness in this one detracts from the overall experience, thus, IMO. And the alcohol in this one will slow you down."
"D: honestly it is drinkable but, there are many others out there that are just as good if not better at a lower price point and more available so If i never have this again, I will not be missing anything; However the bottle is sweet."
"For those that love an Imperial Stout or a Stout in general, I say Yes and the same goes for those who have matured their palate towards this direction."
"Carbonation is a little high for these flavours."
"I'm tempted to go get the 2002 bottle..."
"Pitch black, nothing comes through. Nicely formed tan cap that leaves much bubbling behind. Rich, malty and roasty goodness. Lots going on here: plums, raisins, molasses, toffee, and dark chocolate. The slightest touch of toasted biscuits and coffee roast complement the flavors. Not alcoholic heat at all, which is superb for a high ABV beer. Thick, roasty, rich, and robust, this is a creamy and velvety beer to be respected. An outstanding beer to be enjoyed. If only it didn't cost $18...."
"Not a bad RIS. It has a nice bitter finish and smooth textures. It can be easily drank."
"Black under a little creamy brown head that lasts as a permanent sticky sheet. Thick, dark malt aroma...lots of chocolate, molasses, rummy dark fruits, toffee, roasted espresso beans, and burnt caramel. Big, delicious roasted black malt flavor. Heavy, rich, charred...just a touch of underlying fruit before being swallowed up by a long, bitter dryness. This is manly stout and despite the 11% I see on the bottle, there is absolutely no perceivable alcohol flavor-wise. Not the most complex beer on the planet, but what it does, it does well. Big stout-y goodness. Creamy, oily, and full bodied with a good bit of lingering roasty bite. Classic RIS!"
"D - well done style exemplar. Too expensive (per volume -- 7oz bottle is tiny, even @ 11%) for a standard American craft beer, though, IMO."
"Overall, a very nice surprise I got here. Very consistent of the XS line of beer that ROGUE brings us. Very good."
"The mouthfeel, however is very good. The carbonation seems to fit the bitterness very well. Not a very drinkable beer, but I don't think it's supposed to be."
"d - A pretty good RIS. Lots of bitter chocolate and dark fruits; a little less alcohol in the nose and taste and it would have been even better. Would have again."
"Full mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Aroma is strong and rich, smoky with an overtone of molasses and hints of sweet chocolate and toffee. It comes out of the bottle looking like motor oil - thick, opaque, almost black. Light tan head is thick and rather persistent, and it leaves behind a fair amount of lacing. Flavor has tones of sweet chocolate, fine coffee, molasses and toffee, and a bit of a metallic tang. Alcohol nip is a bit strong, but still this is an excellent brewski. Texture is fizzy and rough, leaving behind a strong alcohol bite."
"Drinkability is hurt also by the bitterness. Otherwise delicious. This isn't an overly bad beer by any means; rather, it's a very good beer, even excellent, with a major flaw. Correct that one issue and you're looking at an A to A+ beer."
"This review was written on the second night of opening the bottle. It seems a bit smoother after losing a bit of the carbonation. A nice bitter stout."
"Dark tan 1/2"" head at pour. Dark black color. Very malty aroma, dark malt with some roasted notes. Very dry finish, pick up some hop fruitiness in middle to end. Dark druit notes; with warmth starts to pick up some coffee, and later start to show some of the alcohol. Mildy carbonated, a little thick on the mouthfeel. Warmth brings forward some caramel and nutty notes. Hops and malt seem to be relatively balanced. Very flavorful though nothing comes on as being too overpowering, and hide alcohol pretty well as well. Pretty complex from all side, don't really feel like I'm doing this one justice."
"This is a sipper all the way. A decadent feast for the mouth. Not as complex as I thought it would be, but very enjoyable."
"D - Good. Not my favorite Imperial Stout, but definitely a respectable brew worth checking out."
"Beer is medium to full bodied and leads off with nice malt sweet and finishes full bodied with a roasty bitterness and a smooth mouthfeel. Its about as average a beer as you can make, tastes decent though."
"Overall, this may have been an OK brew but the plop of such a large chunk of sediment from such a tiny bottle ruined my experience."
"Pours a super dark black with a creamy brown head. The aroma is of coffee bean infused vodka. Taste is sweet toffee up front, with a dark chocolate middle and a long bitter finish that is quite dry considering how high the alcohol is. Mouthfeel is super rich, nice low carbonation. Good drinkability, there is very little alcohol presence for such high gravity beer. The downside to this beer is the insanely high price, the 7oz bottle costs as much as many bombers from other breweries. There are much better RIS's out there for MUCH lower prices. Still a very good beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately this is a one and done for me, but I will hold onto my last bottle to let it sit and think over what it wants to develop into... lol I recommend this to those seeking a dark roasted malt with a malt backbone which doesnt get to shine through."
"I had this beer in a 7 oz bottle with ""Rogue XS"" written on it. It was pitch black in colour with a good long-lasting brown head. The smell is of malt and caramel and maybe raisins. The initial flavour is ok, some nice hoppiness, but the flavour quickly changes into strong charcoal and smokiness. The aftertaste is charcoal. It tastes like I just ate a burnt phonebook. Blergh. Was this a bad batch? I can't believe they intended it to taste like this. I usually love Russian Imperials."
"Drinkability: The nose got me excited, but it fell apart for me when all the bitter roastiness hit the palate. Overall, not a bad beer, but not the best in terms of balance and combination of flavors, especially when there are some really superior Russian Imperial Stouts out there. I likely would not be picking it up again, unless of course, the price point drops considerably."
"A decent RIS but not the best I've had. It lacks just a touch of finesse with the bitterness being overbearing."
"D - Though potent, it's deceptively drinkable. Presumably, it's mellowed a lot with age and is, consequently, less aggressive and less abrasive than expected. One of the best examples of the style I've had."
"Pours a nice jet black color with a mocha head and a few legs as it goes down. The nose brings forward a good dose of chocolate and coffee as well as a bit of booze and some dark fruits. The taste is slightly sweet but also boozy. Nice balance between the two as it is neither hot nor cloying. Good chocolate character and a bit of roast. Drinks quite well and is one of the better Rogue beers that I've had."
"Pours a pretty black with a frothy espresso-crema head with a little bit of lacing. On the nose there is a big coffee note with an undertone of boozy goodness. There is some roast bitterness coming in from the periphery, too. On the tongue the coffee mingles with some sweeter notes, with the bitterness developing later with the warming booze which provides for a huge finish. In the mouth it's a somewhat thinner body than I'm used to for the style, perhaps medium rather than medium full, but satisfying enough. The booze note holds back the drinkability but I'm willing to sacrifice that for flavor in a big stout. A very good beer."
"D: Definitely not recommended as a session beer. Overall it's a good imperial stout and a good beer in general, but the combination of price, ABV, and bitter finish means I can't rate this too high in drinkability."
"The palate opens with a rather hilarious grainy bitterness, almost astringent in a few ways. Very, very bitter, there's a ton of burnt grain, burnt toast, burnt sugar and maybe, a little hops? Despite its intensity, this isn't on the horrendous level that something like the Mikkeller Black/ CC 110K+OT2, especially because it isn't ashy. The rather prominent sweetness also does help. Bitter on the finish with an intense roast and burnt malt character that's tempered by a burnt caramel character, this is decent. The intense malt character does obscure the coffee (unless you consider burnt coffee as an acceptable attribute), molasses and licorice. As it breathes, and as my palate grows accustomed to the tarry flavors, I do pick out some pine sap, and a rather complex sweetness. Full in body with soft carbonation, this beer has quite the wonderful mouthfeel - but for the burnt malt character of course. Ultimately, 7oz is about the right serving size if you're looking to spend an hour or two with this. I doubt I'll revisit this in a hurry. However, this is rather unique, and worth a try. Just wait a year or two, though, 'cos this is just too harsh when fresh."
"Man, 7 ounces of beer looks pretty funny in this giant glass. Rogue Imperial Stout pours the standard stout black, with about a finger of tan head rising up and showing a little staying power (I guess maybe this is better than it sounds due to the smaller serving size). There's really not anything in the way of lacing though. No one flavor really jumps out as I take in the aroma. If I had to pick I'd say that dark chocolate and an overly roasted note are the two most prominent. I can also find a hint of licorice and booze in the background. As I sip this beer the licorice fades out completely and, unfortunately, the burnt roasty flavor and the alcohol become the most assertive. A nice dark chocolate note is still there, and it becomes a little more prominent with warming, but it stays subordinated to burnt malt and booze. Carbonation is appropriately subdued, but the body is too thin to pull off the syrupy feel it's going for. Definitely one of the more underwhelming imperial stouts I've had, though I suppose it could improve with a little age on it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabilty: Extremely full body that was also creamy and smooth. I drank this after some Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti and some Beer Geek Breakfast and this beer had a fuller body than either of those. This is a fairly drinkable beer despite the 11% ABV. Great tasting beer overall and a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Wasn't crazy about this one, didn't come close to finishing the bottle; won't be visiting this one again."
"I am VERY impressed. Complexity, I give it a high rating, the flavors are deep and lasting. On the man beer scale, this is a solid ""8" in my book, if 1 is ""pearl light", and 10 is ""heaven"". DEFINITELY will have this again, shared with a couple friends, this is a winner!"
"Drinkability is not good. Bitter, dark and watery. Even my homebrew is better than this. Also, this beer comes across more as an imperial stout than as a RIS. Not worth picking up. I've got another bottle, but I don't see cellaring doing much for this one."
"Overall this brew has some things going for it but it doesn't quite pull through in the end. Maybe with some years on it it'll even out."
"Amazing how much I get from this beer with only tiny sips. Half way through the bottle and I am enamored. An incredible ris and just a terrific beer."
"Drinkable? At $4.50 for 7 oz, that's over $0.60 per ounce. While good, it's not that good that I'd buy it again."
" I loved every aspect of this beer except the most important factor: taste. Just too bitter for me, with no balance to speak of to smooth it out a bit."
"Alcohol is well hidden. A surprisingly drinkable RIS, and a great example of the style."
"D-- In a lot of ways very one dimensional. the hops save it to me. The pine and bitter grapefruit is a good touch and adds a touch of complexity that this lacks. Really no sweetness that other RIS have. This is just really thick and rich. Lack something like vanilla or some other sweetness that say Yeti has that makes that a better RIS. ABV is pretty well hidden but this is for a 7 oz bottle. Not sure if I would want to finish a bomber of this. Pricepoint of the bomber alone hurts me wanting to buy one to cellar it and find out. Workable RIS but better ones out there."
"D: Not anytime soon. I love stouts, but this did not do it for me. Tempted to get a bottle to age it to see if it makes a difference, but really don't want to experience those flavors again."
"Drinkability is good, but it reminds me more of a Simcoe-hopped IPA than an Imperial Stout. I had such high hopes for this one."
"Taste: a velvety smooth full body with loads of chocoolate flavor. not my favorite RIS but very good"
"2006 vintage. Poured from the black ceramic bottle. I hadn't had this beer since the mid '90s, in the original 7 ounce bottles, and figured I never would again, due to the outrageous price. Thanks to Ratman for splitting a bottle with me the other night. Poured a deep, dark black color, with minimal head. Aromas of bitter dark chocolate, roast and malt. Somewhat sweet, with no noticeable oxidation. Held up well over the years."
"I don't find this overly drinkable. More than this tiny bottle would be a struggle."
"Syrupy body, very thick and chewy. Light carbonation. Slick. I've had some hoppy imperial stouts that were quite good, and balanced the flavors pretty well. This is not one of them. Pretty disappointing."
"Pours pitch black with very little head and quickly dissipating lacing. The scent gives off hints of chocolate and something else I just can't put pinpoint, though I enjoy the scent very much. Taste is of coffee, chocolate, some malt. Thick full bodied, creamy, and slightly carbonated mouthfeel (still after 6 years). 2004 version or not, this has always tasted like a unique RIS to me, which I enjoy. Very tasty. This aged well."
"Im so stoked to be able to finally sample this brew in this nice dainty 7oz bottle anyway the brew pours a jet black dark as night hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a creamy chocolate laced two finger head and a rim of sporadic lacing here and there it nearly looks spot on for the style,the aromas are dark fruits mainly plums,mocha and dark chocolate,it has a rather creamy full mouthfeel which suits with tastes of dark fruits,coffee,dark chocolate and ends with a bittersweet finish of mocha and fruity bitter hops on the palette,overall its a nice drop but its definately a nightcap sort of brew with its big ABV and could easily see myself downing this with a nice piece of chocolate mud cake cheers."
"Little appealing about this one; no finese whatsoever. True to form, Rogue does great bottles and average or worse beer."
"D: You are not going to be drinking to many of these, probably why they packaged it in a 7oz nip bottle. I love the flavor of this beer, really over the top, but it is one of limited drinkability."
"Dark fruit, maybe boozy rum, up front. Quite aggressively sweet, with lots of roasted notes being complemented by the serious shots of bitter, leafy hops. Tea leaves, citrics, and pine resin distinguish this from ordinary imperial stouts, but I doubt that will help it age. Interesting, tasty, and very intense, but the thickness of the mouthfeel and aggressive nature of the hops make this one a slow sipper."
"This Rouge Imperial Stout was bottled in 2004, had it 6 years later. It poured black, with no head whats so everr. It smelt and tasted of strong chocholate flavors, with a burnt flavor as well. Both the taste and smell was very strong. Overall a fantastic stout, and iam sure some aging has helped make this one a good one."
"quite a bit of carbination for a stout this big, with a medium viscosity. Another point of intrest is the 7oz bottle, i think this is a perfect amount for a single person to enjoy of this brew, anymore and it would be a chore."
"D: I hope I can find it in bigger than a 7 oz bottle next time!!"
"D - This beer is thick and complex with an intense bitterness that is hard to stomach at first. There is a good bit of chocolate in the aroma, but the flavor is dominated by coffee and black barley. Even the chocolate flavors are that of bitter baking chocolate rather than anything sweet. The bitter grain character seems a bit excessive at first, but it gives that beer a long, lingering aftertaste that unfolds into smoky, espresso complexity that must be given time to develop on the palate. This is not for everyone, and the drinkability is somewhat limited; a fact that Rogue seems to have recognized by bringing back the nip sized bottles. This is truly a sipping beer that is at its best during the long finish."
"This RIS does have a great smooth and creamy mouthfeel, but it's a sipper for sure. I'd recommend sitting on this beer for as long as you can...even longer."
"Taste: Over the top intense, astringent, dark espresso bean bitterness with some burnt wood undertones. Potent, but not super pleasant and a little edgy for me - especially at the warm temperature that it was served at. Incredibly dry after a long, lingering bitterness. The flavor is more oaky in the middle, darkly caramelized coffee and charcoal, continued dry, bitter notes. Drinkability really suffers from the incredible dryness...my mouth is parched after each sip. Moreover, while intensely roasty the complexity is fairly limited. Finish is more of the same."
"Served from 7 ounce bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours ptich black with a minimal tan head. There was minimal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of nutty, caramel, and malty notes. Very pleasant. The flavor was malty with coffee notes, but not overpowering. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this one was not bad for a Russian imperial stout. It is kind of low in flavor as compared to others I have had in the past, but actually quite nice. Mainly bought it due to the little bottle, but it made up for it for sure. Would definitely buy a larger bottle if I come across one."
"I came across a 7oz bottle of this in Brookline, NH and it was the last one on the shelf. I was not too psyched that it was such a small bottle, but I bought it because I have never seen it before. I poured it into a small glass and it looked like a thick coca cola with a light brown head. The scent is overwhelmed with malts, molasses, and coffee notes. The flavor reflects the aroma with an emphasis on sweet molasses, chocolate, and hop bitterness. There is also a bit of a light smokey flavor. At 11% ABV, the alcohol makes its self known. The mouthfeel is a full body, creamy texture. I would never want to session this beer, but if you have never tried it and like stouts, definitely buy this. Very good RIS by Rogue and if I find this again, I would love another one. Would go well with a chocolaty dessert!"
"Drinkability -- One of the more drinkable RIS that I've had. Hides the abv exceptionally well, has great mouthfeel, but for the most part everything just tastes burnt and acrid. Don't know if I'd reach for it again, but for those who love DEEP roast flavors in their stouts, this will certainly fit the bill."
"D - I really enjoyed this - a drinkable imperial stout w/ the abv not anywhere recognizable at the level it contains in the flavor. The beer hits the spot w/ lots of hop and malt contrast and yet is smooth for an 11% stout if that makes sense. It has a nice body and interesting cocoa bitterness"
"The bartender warned me this was still a little young, and I'd have to agree. I drank several drafts of this in a session last year this time, but would not want anymore than the 7 oz i have in front of me right now. If you happen upon some, I'd get it and stash it away for a while. I'll probably pick up a couple more of these little guys and do the same."
"D: A very good imperial stout. Definitely one to age in the cellar."
"D: goes down good all the way down the bottle and a decent attempt at a RIS by rogue."
"D: Not very; it's far too sticky sweet."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV. I don't think I'd want to session it, but I'd absolutely have this again."
"While I did enjoy this beer, the astringency did take away from the drinkability and overall enjoyment of it, though as it warms the astringency does become a bit more tolerable and allow for some of the other flavors to come through."
"D-I had trouble finishing a 7 oz. bottle. What else can I say?"
"One was plenty, and there are other stouts I've enjoyed more, but this was a great beer to experience at least once."
"Overall, pretty good RIS. No where near the best I have ever had, but definitely worth trying."
"D: This is my of my all-time faves from Rogue. Priced as it has been I only bought it once. At $4.69 a bottle going back to the nip bottles it's more affordable and I'm glad I revisited it. While I'm not the biggest fan of a lot of their stuff, Rogue's dark beers (porters, stout, black lagers) tend to be very good and this is no exception. Quite drinkable for its style as well, thoroughly enjoyable."
"One of those ""be careful how you pour"" beers as half the glass fills up with brown foam if you're not careful, extremely fine foam, whipped worse than a mule, too fine to even dimple, above average stickiness to the lacing. The liquid is completely black with nothing more to be said about it. While the nose has a taut muscularity to it, at the same time it's fairly inexpressive, light and hoppy with citrus and grain notes before the dark chocolate, caramel, creamed coffee ensue, plum and cherry fruit quickly breeze by, could argue that the mixed white citrus accents last longer, more pretzel dough than flaky pastry dough. Full-bodied with a soft, enveloping mouth feel, gently rubs its way into most of your mouth pores. Not to detract from the roast in the coffee, mocha flavors as well as the hoppiness. Dry, fluffed out carbonation too weak to lift things up off the tongue. Fistful of chicory, the white grapefruit pith has more oomph. Despite its body it does not warmly hug you like the best Russian Imperial Stouts do. Quiet mutterings of cherry, berry fruit, shut up by the graininess. Certainly trying to put an individualistic stamp on the style, yet, there is something to be said for truth in advertising."
"Boozy nose. Burnt malt...and heavy alcohol. Not much else. This one was kept too long."
"(D)- I love my hops, but not in an RIS. This still needs more time to age enough to smooth out its harsh green edges. Shows promise though."
"D: It's good, and I could drink plenty of it. I have other preferences for imperial stouts though, so probably wouldn't buy much more of it."
"A complex stout indeed, but one I'd enjoy a lot more if the straightforward bitterness in the aftertaste was toned down. 7 ounces works for me with this beer. Worth a try, but there are hordes of better tasting imperial stouts on the market."
"This is a decent imperial stout, but $6 for a 7oz bottle is pretty steep considering most equivalent beers are much cheaper per ounce."
"D - Not thick or syrupy which really helps this beer in drinkability, it's pretty easy going but could use some more age. The alcohol doesn't really rear its head but the green aroma and flavor suggests it's still a bit young."
"258 degrees lovibond"
"This is a good one...a bit dryer than other Imperial Stout's I have had, less of that nice sweet aftertaste that balances out the flavors across the palate. But, I like this one...it's a bit different, but it's tasty...a sipper, for sure, and the alcohol lingers in the mouth long after the sip is gone."
"drinkability - drinkable for a one bottle session but the bitterness fatigues the mouth very quickly"
"Mouthfeel is liquid smooth with just enough body for a stout. Not too thin nor thick, which was nice. Drinkability is fair - I'd recommend sharing it with a friend, rather than finishing alone especially due to its high ABV level. Not a bad stout by all means, but I'd probably choose the Shakespeare Stout over this instead."
"Poured from a 7 ounce bottle with no freshness date. Dark almost black after pour with dark tan head. Only a minimal amount of head that disappeared pretty quick. Little or no smell, maybe a little malt. Heavy mouthfeel, not thick or chewy. Heavy malt, not much chocolate, coffee or hops. I guess in the end I was expecting something huge cuz it was packaged small. It was somewhat weak in character, there are a lot better Russian Imp. Stouts out there."
"drinkability is crazy good - i have not enjoyed a stout this much since the first time i had Founders Breakfast Stout"
"Drinkability: I can't fault this at all because I feel like this could go at least four more years with no problem at all. That said, this is either insane charred malts or the hops that are preserving this, and again, after four years, I have to commend them. But even with the years, this is going to be too much for some people. If you have one: save it for at least a few more years."
"Great beer, to look at, taste, and smell"
"Overall drinks fine. A little bitter to be enjoyed at length as a deep and satisfying stout, but perhaps more of the recommended age would soften that edge. I do like that it's not full and overly rich like a lot of similar stouts. I also like the 7oz serving size bottle - hard to share, but perfect for a single pour. I'm just not wowed by this beer though. It's good, but not outstanding."
"On tap last night at the Dirty Truth, reviewed from notes. Served in a very nice goblet (Achel I think it was) and poured pitch black with a very dark tan head. It leaves a nice cloud on the beer and a medium coat of lacing behind on the glass. A very nice ring around the edges of the beer. Smell is of medium strength. I get roast malts, coffee and cocoa. The balance is good with some earthy hops in there and a bit more strength would boost its rating. The taste is very nice for a straight up Imperial Stout. HUGE amount of roast malt followed by nice coffee and cocoa flavors (assuming from the malts). The hops are very nicely done for an Imperial Stout and they are earthy. I get a bit of licorice taste and no alcohol at all. I love the hop level here. The roast is almost a bit too much, taking away from a perfect taste. Mouthfeel is nice. A great heavy body with medium carbonation and a good bitter coat. A bit of warmth adds to a very nice feel, also some creaminess. The price was cheaper than almost every beer on-tap, for a huge goblet of this stuff. The strong flavors stay very good and are well balanced. Very nice straight-up Imperial Stout for sure."
"Great flavor profile on this one!"
"Would give it another shot, but probably won't make my list of go-to RIS's."
"Drinkability: 7 oz. was just about the perfect amount for this beer. It's very intensely toasted, charred in parts, and though it's never really that harsh, it does get a little trying after 7 oz. at a depth of 11%. On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by the hop addition, and yessiree, that 11% is nowhere to be tasted. This is one worth trying once or if you see it on tap (and its inexpensive), particularly if heavily toasted RISs are your thing. I likely won't be getting it again, though, largely because of the price point."
"Pours dark brown almost black with a good sized dark tan head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is sweet. Dark fruits. Chocolate. Spicy alcohol. Grapefruit hops. Taste has some big roasted malt bitterness. Background sweetness provides some balance. Citrusy hops in the middle through the finish. Boozy. A bit dry. This is a sipper but I'm finding it extremely pleasant. Very enjoyable."
"D: A drinkable beer - one of Rogue's better efforts - though the mini serving size is a little irritating."
"BTW.... Wade if you ever read this (and if you do, you have waaaay too much time on your hands), I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate the MANY old skool nips that I've been able to try... Thanks amigo."
"I will say that this is definitely a chewy stout. The MF is thick and oily, it feels like I could eat it with a knife and fork. ABV and robustness of flavor makes this one a sipper for sure, although the sipping experience is a positive one. The 7 oz. serving size is a good one for this beer, although I wish it were cheaper."
"From the mini 7 fl. oz. bottle with no bottling or expiration date. Sampled on Feb 27, 2010. The pour is black as night with about a one finger brown, foamy head that diminishes although there is a nice clinginess to the lacing. The aroma is of mild hops, mild chocolate malts that are noticeable and not obstrusive. The taste reminds me of charcoal with a boozy taste and a bitter, dry ending. It was a bit more sour than I would have liked."
"D: I didnt care for the strong burnt malt flavor way beyond roast. Low drinkability."
"Overall a decent beer. If you like hoppy stouts you may enjoy this, but I probably won't be buying another unless its to store for awhile."
"Wow that was one delicious stout - and 7oz of 11% is perfect!!! Great idea to bring it back Rouge. Good beer - most likely would be better aged but frankly I liked the aggressive hops."
"Good."
"Not a very drinkable beer at all. Perhaps aging for another year would help. I plan to sock a bottle away and try again but this tasting was a real disappointment."
"D: This is a pleasant sipper, and the 7 oz. servings seem to be just about right for an evening indulgence. It has a pleasant balance and the feel is a nice touch - for those times I'm not in for something more chewy or creamy feeling. I see myself going back for more of these with time."
"a dark flat pour, reminiscent of a black pool from a horror movie, who knows what lies beneath? a brown film covers the bottom of the glass, the settlement of the underbeer people. its a bit of chocolate, a bit of roast, a hint of coffee. mostly its the strength of ah-nold in his mid-20s. not much hint of that alcohol flavor, but you know its there. an excellent hop presence on the end at the back of the tongue blends nicely with the bitterness of the dark roasted grains. drink of this hearty beverage. drink of the blood of the earth."
"D: Ok, I'm not going to have it all night, obviously. In fact, the 6-8 oz pour I had took awhile to drink, but that's what you want with this style, of course."
"Not a very drinkable beer. I was able to make it through my pint, though I'm afraid that I could not make it through another one."
"D- Pretty smooth for the most part. Alcohol hidden well with a little bite to it."
"I did expect a little more from this beer and at over 20$ a bottle I doubt I'll be drinking this anytime soon. That being said this isn't a bad beer it's just a little young perhaps and most certainly overpriced"
"Drinkability: Strong, heavy, rich, and simply amazing. After a long day on campus, this totally hit the spot. I'd recommend sharing it with a friend (as I did), but I wouldn't discourage drinking the whole thing on your own. Now that I'm at the bottom of my glass, I wish I had some more. (5.0)"
"M/D - Thick full mouthfeel, appropriate for style, sticky. Easy to drink really but the alcohol is not shy. Great brew, gonna pick up some more if others haven't gotten to them all."
"Smells like black jelly beans, chocolate and sugary molasses. Despite being aged for awhile (2 years give or take) it still tastes young. Wood, licorice, and rum over a chewy roast base. There's a medicinal component somewhere in there."
"A veritable beer-tinged echo of all those Christmas box candies of lore, the big booze coming off as more or less well-integrated, the overall effect rendered as a smooth, sneak-up-on-you kind of chocolate malty hop-thronged alcohol sort of thing. Yum, even if that description doesn't exactly convey it as such."
"This one did not mature gracefully..."
"Taste is full roasted malt, like drinking chocolate covered espresso beans. There is a hint of dark fruit in the beer. A lot of bitterness is in the finish, almost too much. Alcohol is very well hidden, probably due to the age of the beer. Mouthfeel is full bodied, and this is a sipper for sure, probably something better off in a 12 oz. bottle. A good beer but priced on the high side. There is better value to be found in other Imperial Stouts."
"D- I could personally drink one of these every day. It would be perfect with almost any dessert. This is by far one of the best beers that Rogue offers!! Two thumbs way up!!"
"This is a very chewy beer. Loads of biscuit and bready characters come to mind. This starts to thin out a little after awhile. This imperial stout is quite tasty but doesn't last the distance."
"D-the beer is certainly delicious showcasing a plethora of flavors but with its abv and heavy body it is a beer that is definitely a sipper but can be expected with the style"
"Rich and creamy mouthfeel, full and round, a bit of tannens. Tasty beer, very drinkable, good sipper."
"D - Good, but ruined by the overly bitter finish."
"D - Not my fave. Rough and High ABV."
"I'm done with Rogue. I think they've spread themselves too thin."
"And with a $15 price tag, I think this will be my last one of these guys on my tab."
"- Hid the alcohol better than most any Imperial Stout I have had... that was the best part. Flavor was so-so... but it was still quite drinkable."
"D: So I finally bit the bullet and gave one of those stupid ceramic bottles a try. And I'll admit, this is a very solid RIS. But there's absolutely no justification for jacking up the price through packaging. I, for one, would seek this out a lot more if it were available in 12oz bottles."
"D = A little stringent to really be highly drinkable."
"A good example but I can say that I've had better. It's aged though and thus seems more drinkable now. I'll have to buy a fresh bottle to compare. Regardless, only spend money on this if you're a fan of the style and must ""try them all""."
"*** Bottled in 2004*** Purchased this 12 oz bottle from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. This beer is completely black with almost no head. Aromas are of roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, and a hint of brandy. Just one whiff and you know immediately - this is the real deal. It tastes pretty much the same way it smells. After finishing about half the glass, you really start to feel the alcohols presence. At 11% ABV this stout makes no apologies. If you do not respect this beer, it'll turn around and kick you right in the ass! ~"
"The ABV tells no lies, and there is a cork for a reason. This is a good brew to stretch out and savor over time and make you feel like you got your monies worth. I'm going to have to go with the masses here and say that the $16 price tag is a bit much. The next time i shell out that much for a single, i damn well better orgasm through the entire drink. Unfortunitely, I think we are paying for that bottle mostly...even though it is a wicked sweet one..."
"Pours a solid black with a cola like tan head that sticks around for a while. Smells of chocolate and burnt sugar, toffee, and still quite a hop presence in the nose. Taste is Chocolate, toffee and some ash up front. Slight toffee and dark fruits followed by a bitter hop and roast bite that coats your taste buds and refuses to let go. Mouthfeel is a a thick, tar like, oil sludge kind of feel. In a good way of course. This stuff is thick and full bodied with a minimal but ample level of carbonation. Great Imperial stout, if it weren't for the huge price tag for the ceramic bottle I may have tried this one a lot sooner, and perhaps a lot more often."
"Overall, a rich and bold imperial stout. Well balanced with a nice use of northwestern hops. Seems very hoppy upon first drink but after the beer warms it becomes more malt-forward. However, could do without the expensive packaging and price (although it does make you crave the beer even more)."
"D: I feel this beer is a small step above avaerage. Good beer but in no way worth the price of 17$ for 750ml. Many better RIS available for much less $$."
"""I think it smells like potato peels. Sorry!"""
"This poured an opaque black with no other coloring and moderate dark tan head. It smelled like rich and creamy dark chocolate, with some roasted coffee and roasted barley and fig. It tasted like burnt coffee with bitter dark chocolate, and a bit of brown sugar and fig. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this smelled fantastic, but the flavor wasn't quite as good with surprising amounts of lasting bitterness. I would have thought that after three years of age, the flavor would be more subdued, but it was still quite bold and almost harsh. On the plus side, it hid the alcohol well, but it also made it more of a sipping beer. This could clearly age for much longer before hitting its peak. I'd love to try one around 8-10 years old. But generally speaking, this beer is overpriced for what you get."
"D: A very good and powerful imperial stout. There are some pretty bold flavors going on here. Unfortunately, I think the bitterness in the finish was a bit too much. Interesting to note that the alcohol is still this prominent after three years in the bottle."
"MF&D - this beer almost gets the perfect feel right on the nose. super thick, but a bit too velvety and creamy. the beer is very slick and feels almost like an oily slippery in the mouth. nevertheless, the brew drinks great and is a great warmer-upper for the cold months. the only thing that really keeps this down is the super slick feeling to the body, it brings it down quite a bit as i find it a bit nauseating when i concentrate on it."
"D - A good RIS, no doubt about it. I've had better but then again, I've had much much worse. I would drink again, no doubt about it. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"Pours a great dark black with fantastic head and lacing. Decent scent, hints of chocolate but mostly alcohol. Very alcoholic taste, with just hints of cocoa. Creamy, if not overly smooth. I was disappointed with this brew. No big stout flavors, no fig, mostly alcohol. If that's what I want, I'll get whisky. Too expensive for lack of complexity."
"Holy hell, an amazingly complex and heavy imperial stout. Very rich and blasted with alcohol. I'm pleased to sip it, but I couldn't slug it down."
"Does have a strong alcohol hit on the back though which reminds me it's heavy going and not sessionable, but this is in all other respects a damned fine drop."
"Consumed in honor of the late great Billy Mays RIP 6/28/2009."
"D - A little tiring, but a nice beer."
"A couple of years on this bottle seemed to smoothe the profile out some but a good bit of that 11% is still out hanging right out there, which holds back the body and drinkibility back a touch for me. Still, the power and complexity of a great RIS are here. Maybe I'll cellar another one of these a little longer next time."
"TOTAL=4.7 / A+"
"D - A very tasty Russian Imperial Stout indeed. Obviously not a session beer but something I'll be buying and drinking again."
"overall the aging smoothed out a lot of the hotness of this beer, I can only assume, making it better! yum very nice."
"Man is this stuff good on-tap. Had a glass at the Brick Store Pub recently. Poured black with a creamy tan head and some nice lacing. Smells a bit sweet and chocolatey with some caramel and some nice roastiness on the finish. The taste is very nicely balanced, and a very rich and tasty. Sweet with chocolate flavors, a developing complex bitterness, and some coffee notes are predominate. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and just a bit sweet, with just enough bitter bite on the finish. Utterly delicious and very nice to have again."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Does not disguise the 11% abv all that well especially as it warms. Delicious complexity and eventual balance is to be savored."
"Drinkability- This beer is extremely drinkable considering its powerful punch, I felt lucky as heck to get this on tap cuz it was a treat, I hesitate putting it up with my Hall of fame of this style but its certainly a good to great imperial stout, a nice overall balance and one on tap you could certain enjoy sipping on all nite"
"D: Fantastic brew, my best Rogue yet! I'm sure the atmosphere of being at the Portland Pub helped up the score, but who cares, it's an awesome place! This was a great brew and one worth going out of your way to find."
"I really like this beer! Not cloyingly sweet like some other RIS, but I feel that the combo of hop bitterness and astringent roasted malts is just a tad over the top to be truly spectacular."
"Overall this is a tasty IS that follows with the other big beer from Rogue I've had lately - Old Crustacean - in that it's bitter as bitter can be. I'm a fan of this kind of IS and if you are too then it's worth a shot."
"I enjoyed this beer and I recomend trying it"
"HV"
"Overall: Looks and smells great! I wish the taste lived up to it a bit more, but it is far from a poor Imp stout. It is probably my favorite Rogue I've had as I'm generally not a big fan of their offerings."
"Easy to drink and easy to love this imperial stout from Rogue."
"6/4/7/3/13 (3.3/5)"
"Overall I'm really impressed with this beer. I had my concerns that it may not have aged well or that it would be oxidized but neither seem to be the case. It has great character, body, and bitterness. If it wasn't so expensive, I would go out and buy several more for years to come."
"D: Well, this is a one and done in a sitting beer. It is really good, but more of a dessert beer. I could not have another of this style while at the bar that night."
"All in all, I thought this was a good beer, and a nice representation of the style. Wish Rogue were a little easier to find here."
"Pours a very watery, almost pitch black colored body, with a huge chocolate-milk colored head, big bubbles and very frothy, lasting. Malt, bitter, alcoholy aroma. Some bitter chocolate, and a hint of some dark roasted coffee. Lots of alcohol present. Watery palate, some hotness on the front end, and on the aftertaste. Some bitter chocolate. Malty taste. Warming up a lot, much more drinkable, but the flavors are also more muted. This one is going to have to cellar for a long while to be very drinkable by me. Creamy nutty taste after warming."
"Overall, quite a tasty RIS. Seems to have aged well over the past 5 years."
"Feel is thick, thick, and thick. Coats your mouth and never wants to let go. Packs a huge punch at 11% ABV, but only warming alcohol flavors get through. The harshness is well masked."
"Overall, I don't think it was worth $17. It was good, but I think $12 would be a fair price. I'm pretty sure I won't be getting this again, but at least now I know."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent high-powered big stout that is worth drinking for as long as the 11.00% ABV will allow you to."
"Opinion: This is an excellent beer! I really enjoy the dark ales from Rogue, and I think that this is probably my favorite. It is very well balanced and all of the flavors compliment rather than some of their lighter colored brews. I hate to separate them by color, but is certainly a trend by Rogue IMO. This is a great beer, and I would definitely drink it again in whatever it was being served in."
"D: I know I am gonna sample this guy again. Something was not right with this one, I would expect more from Rogue. Maybe my senses were awry, alcohol is all I got out of this one"
"It could be my lack of experience with many Imperial Stouts, but I found this one a rough drink-- not one I envision ordering again in the near future."
"J"
"Drinkability: I'd pick up a bomber every now and then during the colder months, but it's a biggie. And as stated, a little hot."
"overall, this is very good beer. after 6 years it is beginning to decline, but it still holds up. i would say that 2-4 years would find this beer in its prime."
"750ml ceramic swing top bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep black with a finger of dense tan head. Plenty of carbonation. Lots of piney hops in the aroma and some chocolate. Full bodied and rich. Lots of roasted malt. Some burnt black patent flavor. Plenty of hop bitterness. Really long finish that is hop bitterness at first, then chocolate. There was a bit of sourness that dinged the score a bit for me. Pretty easy drinking for 11% alcohol. I have to say, I miss the smaller Rogue bottles. This was a gift, I haven't really felt the urge to splurge on any of this big bottles."
"D - 100%. Yes. Drinkable."
"I have stated in the past, I love strong stouts."
"taste is creamy, thick, strong, bitter, dark chocolate, touch of espresso, and some vanilla, end is dry and bitter."
"Drinkability - Surely this drink is a dessert (or even a meal!) in itself, and we are fortunate that it is SO flavorful that we are encouraged to take moderate, indulgent tastes. I'll drink the second a bit quicker ..."
"I think that this would be a great beer after sometime aging. To help bring that flavors together."
"Bad ass. I have waited forever for this beer, and I finally found it at Servall for the relatively inexpensive price of $15. Pours jet black with a persistent squatty, thick tan head. Bakers' chocolate, coffee grinds, roasted oats, and dried fruits in the nose. Thick, 40-weight mouthfeel. Heavy chocolate, smoked malt, burnt coffee, and leather hit hard up front, then mellow towards a sharp Cascade hop finish. Perfect, lingering, balanced taste of sweet and bitter. A flat-out incredible beer."
"Poured an almost opaque black with a thin tan head that didn't last very long. Smelled of fruit, chocolate, coffee, little alcohol. Tasted fairly strong of alcohol, apricot, chocolate, some cofee. This is a big thick chewy brew that is not a session beer by all means, but very good!"
"Given a different label and expectations, I might even consider this a good beer. As a RIS, it is a major disappointment."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly on the tongue, then thinning out to a mellow, relatively thin texture. Creamy enough to carry the massive hop attack. The flavors are so robust that they take some attention off the mouthfeel, but no worries... it's all good. A sipper and a savory, decadent beer that could easily go several more years in the cellar."
"D - Again, no matter how good this beer is, and it is good, I cannot give high marks due to the price, there is just to many other beers out there that are just as good if not better for less"
"D: A bit too intense and too much alcohol to have more than one. Heck, I had it as a taster at public ale house and don't think I could have a full pint/11 oz. (however they serve it)."
"I want to wait 2 years before drinking my second/last bottle."
"Drinkability is high. There's a bit of alcohol heat towards the finish, but it lends itself so well to the beer as a whole. Really a phenomenal beer IMO. The ceramic bottle is pricey, but the upside is since no one buys them and they rot away on stores shelves, when you do muster the courage to pick one up it's in great condition and already aged!"
"This is without a doubt a good beer. Not sure if it is worth the price, but I enjoy it. It has a nice tight balance full of rich, beautiful flavors. Great malt. Thick and sweet enough that it warrants slow-sipping, lest I want a stomach-ache. A good solid Imperial Stout. Another nice beer from Rogue."
"Overall an interesting experience to try this one at 4 years old. Very different than i would have thought. Still suprisingly bitter. A very pleasant beverage, especially in these days of snow, wind, and warm fires. thanks again to khiasmus."
"Overall: The taste is what made this beer great. My intial taste reminded me of Victory's Storm King Stout, but also had the coffee qualities that Alesmith's Speedway Stout possess. A must try and probably a great beer to cellar."
"Drinkability - Gotta respect the beer. This is a good beer to sip slowly and thoroughly."
"Notes: This is a really well constructed stout. It's a big stout without being too rich or cloying, not a lot of residual sugar. And it's bitter (88 IBUs) without being too thin or roasted/burnt tasting. A nice balance and what I would pin as a ""West Coast Imperial Stout."" Highly recommended despite the foreboding price tag."
"Thanks to CurtDoggYo for the tasting sponsorship during our brew session!"
"D - Very well balanced and enjoyable. Could drink this one all evening....just very, very slowly."
"D - This is one hell of a brew, I don't think I'll have any trouble finishing off the 750mL bottle, but I doubt I'll have any other beers tonight."
"D- A bit too bold to pound back or quench your thirst"
"D: Drinkability is not as high as it could be because of the big roasted character, bitterness and alcohol presence in the taste. Still, a very nice impy stout."
"Drinkability: Though admittedly pricey, it is a very solid, enjoyable Imperial Stout. I wonder how that 2005 bottle is doing right about now."
"Overall: elation"
"A solid black color with a modest brown head and slight lace. It offers a raisin and chocolate coffee aroma. The taste brings chocolate and coffee and licorice with a charcoal finish. A beautiful viscous feel, mildly carbonated and mildly drinkable. Very strong and good."
"D- a pleasure to drink, but at this strength, one is more than enough. im glad i tried this one, i cant wait to see what it will evolve into. something that all fans of RIS should try. its worth the money."
"Wow. This is not what I was expecting, but it was sure a cool surprise. It really holds up even after all this time."
"A five --- cannot be improved upon. I actually like this better than Dark Lord, I think."
"Dark color with nice tan head. Strong aroma of chocolate and molassess. This beer is very strong and it sometimes over powers your mouth. Flavors of bittler chocolate and molasses is balanced with a sweet malt. Smooth but dry finish with a nice bitter bite"
"D- Wow, if I could afford to buy a case every year and have the patience to sit on it for another five... F the expensive flip tops."
"D: Only took it 5 years to get this good but it was worth it.Simply put amazing. Everything blended togeher so nicely. No burn at all. The ABV is hidden behind dark fruit and lies. Glad I have a few more bottles of this. Damn this is good."
"This a great example of a regional twist on a european classic."
"D- solid imperial stout, recommended, no complaints though does nothing to make it stand apart from other imperial stouts, though being well brewed does count for something"
"The mouthfeel is pretty darn good, thick but with enough carbonation to make it feel smooth on the palate. Somewhat dry in the finish and aftertaste with some cocoa and earthy, citrus, hop bitterness."
"Still quite heavy, though with a pretty active carbonation. A fun stout, though not one I'll be looking for."
"If you're cellaring some of these at home, they've hit their peak and are probably good candidates for the kitchen. We'll be turning our remaining bottles into some tasty drizzle reductions for desserts."
"D - Well, this dang ceramic bottle adds to the price unnecessarily. The bitterness found me wondering if the dang bottle was empty yet."
"Drinkability: One enjoyable sipping brew. This is one had had been wanting to purchase for sometime and I am glad I finally did."
"Drinkability: I've got to hammer here a bit for the $15 price tag for the ceramic bomber... totally unnecessary... I wouldn't buy again for that price... great beer, but not a $15 beer."
"Overall this beer lives up to a billing of Imperial Stout. Yes I would rather not pay extra for the ""collector's"" ceramic bottle, but the beer is well made and quite enjoyable."
"Pretty impressive and drinkable for such a big beer, the flavour expands the mouth a few more notches, the dry bitterness of malt carves out a few trenches of its own, but the alcohol doesn't really kick in until near the end of the bottle. It's a satisfying accomplishment to finish a bottle of this imperial stout."
"D. Well, no. 5 ounces was enough. But it's very good after 5 years. Wish I had more, this is better aged then fresh in my experience."
"I really enjoyed this beer!"
"D - I like the re sealable container here since I know I could barely finish one of these. Good for a change of pace ,but not particularly easy on the palette. The leftover bitterness on the tongue is just too strong after a while."
"Poured almost as dark as old motor oil with small brown head that lingered a short time. Aroma is dark roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Flavor is very similar to the aroma with a very nice hop balance to it. Mouthfeel is an oily, hoppy, pleasnantness. Hides the alcohol content well. This is one of the best beers I have had."
"While I enjoy them, I'm not a huge fan of IRS's, but if I were to compare to version I do enjoy, like Abyss or Stone IRS, this is not very impressive at all. The mouthfeel is too thin, the bitterness is out of whack, and the beer just comes across unbalanced. At $15 a pop to boot, this was a major letdown."
"First thing I noticed, aside from the dark, though not truly opaque, pour was the minimalist head that faded into a sort of oil slick, as one user stated. STrong smell, I can smell it from 2 feet away. I really like the way it smells, similar to a light white wine, in my opinion. Wow, for the taste. definitely feel the 11.6% in my throat, like a mixed drink. I, being a bit of a hophead, really enjoy the long dry finish. Nice and bitter! The beginning flavor is almost sweet, creating a very nice balance."
"Beer poured black as night into my snifter with no head to speak of. Nose is great, of roasted malts, chocolate, expresso, and northwest hops. Taste is roasted expresso with cocoa, finishing with a blast of those hops. Mouthfeel is thin for the style but it is pretty smooth. Drinkability is surprisingly good for an 11% abv beer as the alcohol is extremely well hidden and not even noticeable with the first sips. This is a very good beer but seeing the price tag i am not sure if i would buy as there are better cheaper RIS out there to enjoy."
"Pours a beautiful black with minimal head. What litle head that does form disappears almost as quickly as it appeared. Smells great. Earthy tones with chocolate and coffee churning up through the malt aroma. This is a great tasting impy! Lots of subtle chocolate and coffee as the smell indicates. Rolls to the back of the mouth and leaves just the right amount of bitterness that begs for another sip. Rather light in the mouth but goes down smooth. Good beer to share. Great with some age on it!"
"d: This is a world class RIS, but it will be my last if Rogue continues to it in these damned expensive ceramic bottles."
"Too sour and bitter, with almost a hint of saltiness about it. This is a melding of styles that didn't work at all. This is only the second below average grade I've ever given to an RIS."
"Falls a bit short of what I'd hoped. Definitely a big beer, but the hoppy bitterness overwhelms things a bit towards the end of the sip - and I thought Shakespeare Stout was great (though something like Old Rasputin is also a bit overhopped for a stout for me). A stimulating drink, but not worth $15 for me. I would like to see the bitterness pushed back just a bit to see the rest of those flavors come out."
"This is just an incredibly tasty imperial stout. One of the best I've had."
"A complete mess of a beer. No balance with anything, and no nuance. Just very harsh and unappealing for me. There are much better Imperial Stouts available. I would not recommend this."
"Black color with an oily, sticky hot chocolate foam cap and retains well. Sorghum, molasses, dark berry, and chocolate malt nose. Taste leans on a big roasted malts with dark chocolate and a dry, nearly chalky turkish coffee character. Notes of berry tartness and floral, fragrant hops balance well. Not as sweet as the nose might indicate. Smooth mouthfeel, yet chewy and slick. This brew isn't shy on boldness, maybe a tad hot but still drinks nicely."
"Had on-tap at the BrickStore Pub in Atlanta. Is a deep black color with a chocolate-brown head. Smell is coffee and chocolate. Taste and mouthfeel are drier than I expected. Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of it. A slightly bitter aftertaste follows the dry taste. Not the most drinkable of beers. A decent Rogue beer, but I've had better by Rogue, and better versions of the style."
"i don't review beers anymore but i had to come out of retirement for this one. it's my new #1."
"Served in a tulip glass from one of the XS bottles. It was an impenetrable black with a thick brown head. It had a coffee and roasted malt aroma, maybe a little chocolate too. Similar taste: espresso, roasted malt, a tiny hint of chocolate. The alcohol was hidden well, but I think it warmed things up a little. A little bitterness, but good mouthfeel. Good beer."
"Rogue Imperial Stout, poured from one of the giant XS bottles that they come in today. Pours like motor oil - thick, black, viscous, and leaves a half-inch layer of foam. Smell is of roasted malts, some dark chocolate, a bit of pine from the hops, and a hint of alcohol. Taste follows suit - pretty damn good. Roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, coffee, some hoppy pine, and a bit of heat from the alcohol. Pretty well-balanced, as no one flavor really dominates substantially. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, and viscous. Very rich. This is a damn fine stout, and well worth taking the time to drink. Were it not the price tag on their XS series, I could see it making a more regular appearance."
"Definitely a sipper. Some time will mellow this out a bit, as the alcohol and hop bite are a bit strong. Would love to revisit this one in a year or so."
"D - Great beer that is fairly complex, and although I would not turn this beer down if I were ever offered, the ABV and the bottle size make it a little hard to have too many a night."
"Taste is full on peppery spice. Worty. Grainy, but suitably slick too. Massive hints of strong black coffee and bitter chocolate. Tasty, this, but not quite as complex as other imperial stouts for me personally. Thick in the mouth, but effervescent as well. Very little taste of any alcohol, rendering this 11% beast extremely drinkable. Paired marvelously with triple smoked oysters, brie, and havarti."
"As for the expensive packaging, the swingtop bottle is both functional and attractive. For such a heavy beer, its nice to have to option of saving some for later."
"I love big imperial stouts, but I think they need to work on the recipe a bit here. I wonder why the draft version of this I had was so much better?"
"The flavor is heavenly: bitter dark chocolate wrapped in coffee beans and roasted, caramel malts. Truly a dark-chocolate lover's delight, although the java and hops provide a much-needed balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, with an initial velvetness that abruptly transitions to a biting, bitter dark chocolate aftertaste that lingers incredibly long after each sip. This is one of Rogue's finest brews, in my opinion, and its drinkability is high for a RIS. It's worth the high price tag, although someone like myself must save such purchases for special occasions."
"Another big thanks to MiguelMandingo on BA for sharing this beer with us. Pours a dark black color with a rich brown medium lasting head. Smell is rich, roasty, some licorice, maybe a hint of doughy-ness, chocolate, cocoa powder with a nice bitterness. Slight sweetness up front with a nice blast of hops in the background along with the char flavor and a big drying finish. For 11.6% the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Very drying dark chocolately flavor. This was a fantastic Imperial Stout whose only downfall was a relatively thin body for the style, but this also made it incredibly drinkable. Thanks Mike!"
"Served in DFH snifter. Appearance was outstanding; the way an RIS should look. Poured a deep, opaque black. One-inch mocha colored head slowly settled into a thin oil slick of foam. Solid ring of lacing around the perimeter of the glass during the tasting experience. Would have been a '5' if retention was a little better. Strong nose of toffee, malt, espresso roast and a hint of oak. Taste similar to nose with a little bit of dark chocolate and hops bitterness and a mild alcohol bite at the finish. Mouthfeel was dynamite; very full-bodied and silky with a little bit of effervescence to remind you that this is a beer and not liquid crack. This is a pretty formidable brew, and it let's you know that it packs a punch. If alcohol was a little better hidden, would have been a bit more drinkable, but perhaps it's not a bad thing that it isn't."
"Pours a nice thick black color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, not much sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slight smoke, slight vanilla, toffee, slight coffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet at first, nice touch of toffee/coffee, and caramel. Medium body, with a slightly dry/bitter finish. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, highly recommended."
"Recommended..."
"Ceramic 750, 2007. Pours pitch black with a nice 2 cm dark tan head that is slowly diminishing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and a hint of cherries. Flavor is uniform throughout, coffee and bitter chocolate, alcohol is hidden until tomorrow morning. Nice lacing, nearly zero carbonation, well hidden alcohol, heavy body. Drinkable minus the uber EtOH, but I loved it."
"Drinkability - A great stout for those that love them, and a definite try for those looking to get into them. I was quite pleased with this, as I am with almost all Rogue's beers. Be warned, this beer will put a nap on you!"
"Drinkability - A treat to be sure, and glad to see i'll be able to get it regularly in Louisiana. I'll be sure to stock up on this one, and let em sleep in the cellar for a few and see what happens. Great imperial stout! I prefer mine to be a little smoother in the finish, but thats just me. Good show Rogue!"
"A very impressive imperial stout that takes it's time to consume. I shared this bottle with my father and it took us atleast 30-40 minutes to slowly sip through our glasses. Not for everyone i'd say but i sure did enjoy it. Got 3 more bottles in my pantry and i think i'm gonna let them sit for a couple of years to see if the bitterness goes away...atleast a little bit :)"
"Came in a black ceramic bottle. This beer poured a dark black with a foamy tan head. Aroma was dominated by chocolate and coffee. The taste was the same: Chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel was heavy and creamy with medium carbonation. Overall a great beer but the price just doesn't make it worth it. Price is between $15-$18 dollars."
"I poured this from the ceramic 0.75 litre bottle (2007 Edition) into a pint glass to produce a thick tan head of about 1-1/2"". The beer is DARK. And sticky. And has an incredible aroma of chocolate and coffee and caramel. The head had incredible retention. The taste is not as sweet as some of the beers I have been drinking lately, but has a caramel sweetness contrasted with an espresso bite. I wish I had more. But I managed to restrain myself from doing anything disgusting to the carpet. That's the amount of self control I have. Impressed?"
"This is seriously an impressive beer. The bottle is very telling of its contents. Just reading the list of ingredients almost made my head spin. This stuff is like liquid mocha chocolate. Huge amounts of bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted/burn malts, anise, and a little bit fruity. The fruitiness is hard to accurately characterize under all the other rich flavors. They put a flip top on this for a reason. There is no way you will be drinking all this at once. Mine lasted two nights, and I shared a little with a friend. Great stuff, but very rich."
"No carbonation left after all these years, it's drinking like a sweet port wine. What a freakin' treat!"
"Drinkability- Not for the faint of heart. If you can find some, buy it."
"Poured black with small brownish head that laced for a while. Has a little bit if red around the edges in the light. Smell is roasted malt coffee chocolate. Smell is very nice. First taste was of the roasted malts and a bitter chocoloate. Not very sweet. Swallowed kind of bitter with an espresso taste on the back end(dowgraded the taste because of this flavor). This was a rogue beer and in typical fashion there were plenty of hops to balnce out the malt, but hard for me to pinpoint their flavor. Into the glass as it warmed, a few esthers vecame more apparent. A little thinner in the mouth than typical for the style-the alcohol however was nowhere to be seen. Overall pretty good-want to see how one tastes after a year laying down."
"The mocha colored head sets up in a thin layer and leaves a nice lace. The aroma is heavy on the chocolate aroma and the fruit background is more of a generic berry fruit than a specific fruit. On the palate it is very fruit-forward and pleasantly bitter at the back. As opposed to some of the higher gravity stoute, this really is like an ""imperial"" stout. Everything from the roasted flavors to the abv is amped up. I could see this pairing with some bbq or some island jerk style food. All in all, very drinkable big style at a very drinkable price in its class."
"Poured from an opaque, dark grey ceramic 750 ml. bottle, of the 2006 vintage. Leaves a two finger espresso-foam colored head that has excellent retention, and it leaves excellent lacing. Body is black. Beautiful to behold.Smell - the nose is filled with chocolate, richly roasted espresso, burnt crust maltbread, deeply roasted barley malt, smoky roasted coffee beans, plums, dates, and raisins. Well hidden alcohol. Mouthwatering!Taste - as promised by the smell. A flood of chocolate, espresso, and dark crusted malt bread wash over the tongue. As this ale gets warmer, much more of the dark fruit such as raisins, dates, and plums assert themselves into the mix. And still, very well hidden alcohol. This is simply delicious and hearty!Mouthfeel - full bodied, and very dry.Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and having had it after it aged for one year, I can't wait to get this year's (2007) release, and try it fresher. Only the very high abv limits this ale's sessionability."
"D: For 11%, this one goes down fast. Very good beer, Keeps getting better as I drink it."
"JDV, chadspivey and I then followed this up with an '06 and '07 Abyss, which really stole the show...those will be my next reviews."
"Enjoyed at Rogue's Alehouse in Downtown Portland. Looks completely opaque deep black with a chocolate milk head that clings to the glass. Smells big and sweet, some coffee, a little dark fruit, very toasty. Tastes as it smells and finishes with a bitterness from hops and dry. Full in the mouth and this hearty beer makes me feel like I just ate a loaf of bread. A wonderful treat."
"Drinkability: What do you expect for a RIS with 11% abv.... sure, it's a sipper.... but it's WONDERFUL for an RIS.... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Opaque black with light brown head that dissipates to tan layer with foamy islands, tons of lacing. Aroma is chocolate malt with dark fruit. Taste is dark roasted grain and sweet prunes and raisins with a dark bitter coffee/chocolate finish. Taste gets better as the beer warms to almost room temperature. Feels very oily in the mouth with plenty of carbonation. This is a very large stout and fans of stouts will like it a lot. Those seeking subtlety will need to look elsewhere."
"Overall- Definitely improves as it warms up. Was a little skeptical about this aging for 4+ years but it held up nicely."
"Drinkablity is good because this is so unabashed and tasty. Not for the faint of heart, it goes down way to easily for me, and will warm you up in a hurry."
"Each sip is smooth and velvety. It leaves an oily film in your mouth, further enhancing the velvety feel. Goes down very smoothly for it's big abv. Nicely done, and worth the price of admission for those who wonder."
"Mouthfeel slightly tingly and it coats the back of your throat all the way down. All in all a fair offering but not close to the best Imperial Stout Ive had, but definitely far from the worse."
"This brew was a Christmas gift, although I have seen it on the shelves so I know it's pricey. It's a good beer but it's definitely not my favorite imperial stout, so I don't know that I'd spend the money on this one again."
"After sampling a '04 and '07 side by side each one had qualities I enjoyed more than the other. The mouthfeel on the '04 was perfect and the drinkability was higher. The appearance, flavor and aroma were slightly better on the '07. The better flavor was a tough call because it's dependent on which flavors you're looking for on a particular night. Tonight, for me, it was the bigger roastiness compared to the dark fruitiness. The roastiness won out this evening."
"D. I am a bit of a lush but I could not finish this bottle in one sitting (thank you for the swing top bottle). Incredible beer but it is more of a sipping beer than anything else. Very drinkable as a after-dinner drink."
"Bought this in the awesome ceramic 750 mL bottle, one of the coolest available bottles out there in my opinion. Served it in wine glasses. The appearence was exceptional, a thick black color with a red hue along the rim of the beer, similar to a cherry stouts appearence. It had a wonderful black/red head, and left nice lacing when swirled in the glass. Strong vanilla aroma at first, leading to a sherry/alcohol smell. The taste was very good. There was a strong malt flavor, similar to a Barleywine, which gave way to the roasted malts. Comes off as barrel aged, not sure if thats the case though. The sherry/alcohol aroma carries through to the aftertaste, with some burnt/dried fruit flavor also. Good thick mouthfeel that this style should have. As usual with this style, while it begins quite drinkable, it will fill you up quickly. Overall a VERY GOOD beer, wonderful drinking experience!"
"750ml ceramic bottle I bought in August 2005. Pours a jet black with a huge 3 finger head, great longevity and verry pretty lace. Some nice roasted malt aromas mixed with some vanilla and sherry smells. Lots of rosted malt flavors mixed with a fairly big amount of chocolate. The finish has huge roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. Not as smooth as I had hoped after 2.5 years in my fridge. A nice beer with a cigar"
"Holy. Pours thick like syrup and black as midnight with no moon. What very little head that forms is a dark tan. Smell is chocolate-y with a malt edge and a sweet tone. Taste is huge - and complex. Starts off with a strong sweet taste and then recedes slowly until an extremely roasted flavor comes out. It's like watching a roller coaster from a mile away. You can see every move it makes and watch it as it goes up, and then down to something else. Mouthfeel is thick but smooth. Highly drinkable, even at 11%. Unbelievable."
"Overall this was fantastic. The three years have really done a job on this one in a great way. No hint of oxidation and such a smoothed out mellow profile, it was honestly almost perfect. This was truly a treat and I would be thrilled to try this again anyday. I am going to have to get a fresh one for comparison, this was just way too good."
"The carbonation is great and lasts forever. Body is thick and rich and the flavors blend together nicely. Smooth and very drinkable for 11% alcohol."
"Decided to pick up this 2006 Vintage 750mL ceramic bottle from <i>John's Grocery</i> since it was only $12.99. Pours a deep mahogany (black in the glass) with a 1/2 finger tan head that fades to a ring before long. Immediately I nosed some soy and roasted malts, but this was still a bit too cold so I let it breathe and warm up. There is plenty of molasses and raisins to go with the aforementioned aromas--the soy is a little lighter and less salty at warmer temps. Dark chocolate, espresso, a bit of campfire ash and even some vanilla finish it up. Flavor has a lot of roasted malt, coffee, and unsweetened chocolate--I knew this wouldn't be sweet, but this has very little sweetness at all. The only other thing I could pick out in addition to the aroma were some leafy hops. Bone dry ashy char finish with just a bit of booze. Bitterness in the finish lingered and peaked at a 5-6 on a 1-10 scale, surprisingly. Full thick body with very low carbonation. An excellent example of the American style that I probably shouldn't have waited 3 years to try."
"Mouthfeel has a fantastic thick body. Nice a chewy. This is one of the better RIS I've had lately"
"D: Ooof. This is one brutally bitter and dry beer. Starts off really nice but goes a bit too far into the dry realm for me. But too unbalanced, but still quite nice."
"750 ml ceramic bottle. A: Oily, thick black with lots of brown head that retains very well. S: Chocolate, coffee, some hops. T: Bitter chocolate, lots of coffee, sweet up front with a very long, very bitter cocoa finish. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. M: Very thick, chewy, moderate carbonation. D: A bit more bitter than I had expected, but still very good. Nice and complex, continues to reveal itself as I continue through the bottle."
"Jet black body with a good mocha head. The smell is surprisingly hoppy for a RIS, but expected for Rogue. There is a bunch of chocolate in there also. The flavor is really chocolaty but with a good hop flavor also. I was actually able to identify the hops by flavor. Good heavy body with great drinkability."
"Well balanced and very drinklable. The bottle suggest best when 1 year old, but this has aged well and likely in its peak after 4 or 5."
"This time I had this drink on a nitro-tap at Moan and Dove. The appearance did not really alter that much. I felt though that the nitro-tap allowed it to become much darker than when I had it on a normal tap. It had much lighter aromas this time around, explicit on a chocolate theme. It was light and creamy with a bitter aftertaste. It was almost frappe-like even. A low body, the drink was lighter and airier than last time. This was practically a light desert via the nitro-tap."
"Amazing. Pitch black with a huge brown head that stuck all over the place. Delicious smoky smell of burnt chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Wow. Soooo sweet and creamy. Much sweeter than it smelled. One of the finest beers I've had, let alone imperial stouts. Odd that the item with the lowest price was the best offered. The ABV is well hidden in the delicious flavors. Definitely great for the colder months. If you love beer, you owe it to yourself to have this. Offerings like this are why I love beer."
"Great to find this for so cheap, considering a 750 ml ceramic bottle is usually fifteen dollars plus tax"
"2006 Bottling. Pours pitch black. Deadly solid mocha-brown head; almost all cream with large bubbles on top. Smaller arcs and spots lace the glass. Aroma is rich and earthy  deep malts with a pleasant powdery-mold smell, dark fruit, wild grasses, sarsaparilla, a hint of licorice root. Alcohol sneaks in a bit on the nose. Nice saturated mouthfeel: juicy to syrupy with a medium carbonation bite. Flavor is intense dark malts: burnt wood, milk chocolate, walnut, a bit of coffee, and a strong acidic-grass (tomato?) undertone. Very warming, though the alcohol doesn't show through too much in the flavor. Finish is acidic, aftertaste is bittersweet to neutral and short-lived."
"D - This is an outstanding RIS, a little overpriced but after a long day it was almost worth the steep price tag."
"Tastes of thick juicy roasted malts, lots of coffee, chocolate, still has a good bitterness from the hops and a warming alcohol that is very well hidden. The mouth feel is so thick it almost need a fork and knife. Not to be taken lightly, I am a very happy man tonight."
"Overall, this one is probably a little more bitter than the other RISs I have tried. Not that the style isn't bitter, but this one gets the edge for the most bitter. Overall, it's complex and it packs a punch with every sip. I think this one can afford to sit for even longer, even though it's more than a year old. The ceramic bottle helps, since there is no risk of skunking from the light. Oxidation is another issue, however. This beer is strong enough where that shouldn't make that big of a difference. I think five years would suit this beer well, and make it ever more complex, less bitter, and overall a rounder beer. Recommended."
"So far, this and Yeti oak aged stout is my favs!"
"Notes:"
"This was nothing short of an exceptional beer. Nice job Rogue..."
"D- due to the fact that it seems to thin itself after the swallow, it could possibly be a thirst quencher like guinness if not for the high ABV. weeeird. undoubtedly the emperor of all stouts."
"The flavor on this is excellent, BUT I think it would have been good to pull back just a little on the intense coffee notes. I was looking for a touch of the stone fruits in the flavor since they were so apparent in the aroma, but I got very little. For all you homebrewers, it tastes like you are chewing on pure Chocolate grains, especially on the back end. That created a somewhat chalky mouthfeel. It ended with what reminded me somewhat of burned marshmallows ... in a good way ... I think. Overall, however, I would say, an excellent brew."
"It medium bodied, creamy on the front, dry and bitter on the finish. The aftertaste is a bit much, rendering the drinkability a bit low. It is a bit unbalance, so subtle on the front, then the aftertaste just really gets you in the back of the throat. Almost a great stout. And maybe it will become one after some time in the cellar, but not there yet."
"Great looking brew from the start- pitch black liquid with a frothy cappucino-colored head. Cool clean malt aromas permeate while a hint of spiked black coffee balances. A flavorful but mild sweetness of dried fruits and roasted malts pairs perfectly with the earthy bitterness of the hops- an extremely well balanced stout. Alcohol is hardly detectable but the warming sensation is welcomed. So smooth- not thick or heavy in body, it would be easy to polish this one off in a session. One of, if not the best imperial out there- A++"
"Verdict: Not everything that I expected, but then, my expectations were quite high. I am going to let my next bottle have three years to mull it over. Think it could use that long to mellow out and gain in complexity. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, and will come back for more."
"Hmm OK I have tasted better. Off hand I would say that this has a bit too much patent malt and that made it overly bitter. This could be better if the bitterness wasn't so intrusive. Think I will be sticking with Stone RIS."
"Really an excellent sipping/savoring beer."
"Bottle is from 2006, 750 ml ceramic bottle with the swing top on it. The beer pours black with a half inch brown head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. The aroma is very good, it smells like roasted malt, coffee, dark fruit, chocolate and some hops. It tastes like coffee, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, anise, and roasted/burnt malt. The flavor is strong and there's a good balance between sweet and bitter. The alcohol heat is noticable too, but not overpowering in the taste. Mouthfeel is full, with a coating finish it's heavy and smooth. Drinkability is good, but could be better. Overall I think this is a decent RIS, but not quite a great one. With that being said, I'll still drink this again in the future as it's a good solid brew."
"From a giant 750 mL, ceramic swing-top bottle. Brewed with Willamette, Cascade, and Chinook hops and a dosage of rolled oats; 87.5 IBUs. It pours inky black, with a thin cocoa head that leaves bits of lacing here and there. Smells like a box of chocolates, with coffee, dark fruits, roasted malts, anise?, and hints of Tootsie Rolls. The first sip begins almost thin, but it quickly becomes rich and roasty, with bitter dark and sweet milk chocolate, strong raisiny/port notes, roasted/burnt malts, coffee, tobacco, hints of leather and licorice, and a hefty bitterness from the leafy/green hops, which, along with the ABV, contribute some heat to the mouthfeel. The body is smooth, silky and quite dry, medium to full with low carbonation, and it leaves a long-ass, bitter finish. Overall, a damn fine beer - big, complex, and deceivingly strong (as evidenced by the spelling errors in my notebook) - I can't wait to sample the 2002 version I found a while back."
"toffee nut head that was disappointingly bubbly and dissipated quite fast. still left a nice sticky coffee colored lace the beer itself poured a black as the dark ceramic 500ml bottle in which this brew came. the smell was one of dizzying proportions, the perfect mix of coffee, sweet malts, and hops. the initial taste left such a long dry and welcomingly bitter finish in my mouth. i just ended up savoring every last gulp of this heavy but refreshingly bitter and hoppy brew. leave it up to rogue to make yet another brew that breaks the mold."
"This is an excellent beer, so strong and powerful. It commands your attention, but might leave you with your attention capacities slightly impaired."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and quite enjoyable. this one might have scored better if it wasn't overshadowed by the fantastic kuhnhenn american imperial stout i had earlier in the night."
"I was a little nervous about this one, costing 15 bucks to fill up my growler and me just building my interest in stouts and I don't like to look at reviews on here before I try something, but I am generally a fan of Rogue's beers so I decided to give it a go. Into a glass it went dark, dark brown, almost-but-not-quite black and whipped up a frothy oak-colored head that didn't last too long, but left a ring clinging to the top of the glass. The smell wasn't overpowering, but included chocolate and heavy cream, it could have been stronger. The taste is really quite good, chocolatey and roasty with a lip-smacking cream finish and warming alcohol all the way down. This is what I want from a stout, I sort of wish it was wintertime right now so I could enjoy it totally, although on a cooler, rainy summer day, this is really hitting the spot. I give this a 4 for drinkability because it goes down well, too well in fact, and I could see myself getting absolutely kablammo in a short time if I had enough of this costly brew."
"Overall a fine RIS. Will probably pick this one up again."
"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, with some light bubbling around the rim, over the opaque dark brown/black brew. No lacing here, but this one has some legs when swirled. Aroma is heavy dark sweetness with figs and alcohol. Taste begins the same dark roasty maltiness, hits some dark fruits quick, and then more or less evaporates off the tongue and is almost gone before you can swallow. Or so it would seem, making an incredible mouthfeel, and drinkability is insane as well. Not that I'll get the chance again, but if I did, I would choose this one again in a moment."
"Taste is mainly baked chocolate and weak coffee. Toffee, molasses, rum and alcohol lay just beneath the surface. While not rich or over indulged with alcohol, this brew is not as enjoyable to drink as it might seem (to me). However, it is still a solid beer and I'm glad I do have another bottle."
"Drinkability: Four years later and this is still going strong; excellent brew"
"(lacking carbonation)."
"I was expecting more from this beer. There was too much going on in the hops department to really be able to enjoy the complex roasted flavours that I'm looking for in an imperial stout. Too harsh to be very drinkable."
"This beer didn't impress me at first, but after it warmed a little, the flavor really popped out. Good stuff, but not quite the most drinkable beer (to be expected) because of its potency."
"Drinkability: How drinkable do you think I thought it was?"
"This was a terrific beer, but I am unsure if it was worth the $15 I spent on a bottle."
"Cheers."
"NOTE: The ceramic swingtop bottle design is much cooler than the bottle pictured, but I'd imagine in a store it's a typical Rogue ripoff."
"D- Not overly drinkable, because of the crazy strong flavor of it. Especially because it's out of a 22 oz bottle. But still good."
"PS Rogue, stop bottling this beer in a HUGE ASS 750 crock and go back to the 6oz nips. What are you trying to do to us?"
"PS: I see a few people reviewed the 750s and mentioned seeing a vintage year. It's not on mine."
"it's interesting to compare to my other review"
"D: For 11bucks I don't think I'll be giving this another try."
"D: Overall the taste is pleasant and easy to drink, however at 11%, I doubt you could us this as a session beer."
"Got this one hand-pumped at Ashley's in Ann Arbor, MI. Pours a deep brown-black color, with a delicious looking tan head on top. Solid lacing throughout. Looks how an RIS should. Nose is interesting; lots of malt, some alcohol hints, molasses, raisins and a hint of lemon as well. Taste was good, although not quite as outstanding as I had hoped. I guess people are saying that this one has slipped recently. Strong caramel malt, some chocolate, a lot of dried fruit. Hops show up there as well, with some breadiness, and lots of coffee both at the start and end. Good, but not great. Feel was as expected: very full-bodied, almost syrupy, with medium carbonation. Overall, a solid beer, but not quite up to what I had hoped from both Rogue and an RIS. Not quite up to the (admittedly very different) Bell's Third Coast Old Ale I had in the same sitting. A little disappointing."
"2001 bottle drank. Pours dark, viscous and huge! This is everything a imperial stout should be. Thick as hell, with plenty of sludge oozing in the bottom of the bottle. Smell is boozy roasted malt. Taste is incredible. Very roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and still some alcohol. Its amazing how time has improved this beer. Only if Rogue still made this beer to this caliber. This is a very good RIS and one that I look forward to drinking again."
"Poured into a glass a thick black opaque color, with a slight coffee colored head that forms, but soon dissolves away. The scent of dries fruit, currant and raisons are very strong in the fragrance. That is followed by a the sweet smell of malt, a slight twinge of alchol is present as well. The malt is very prevalent in the taste, plus coffee flavors. Then a mild bit of hop bitterness comes foward, it ends with a harsh flavor of alchol. A thick, rich, heavy feel, very syrup like going down, the alchol does leave a warming presence on the throat. This was rather disappointing, Rogue makes excllent brews and I was expecting a very good imperial stout, the taste was a let down and the scent was nothing truely impressive."
"Damn, that was good. This is what an Imperial Stout should be. Its rich yet bitter, smooth yet abrassive, sharp yet silky, and so on. Definitely one of the most complicated beers as far as structure I've had in quite a while, and many kudos to Rogue for an Imperial Stout that walks the line between ying & yang and never wavers. Highly enjoyable, a great experience. I would highly recommend this beer for cellaring, and would certainly try to acquire some for that purpose. To those sitting on 2+ years of cellaring, your patience will be rewarded if you go 3+."
"D: Of course, the 11% ABV kills the drinkability. The heaviness of the beer itself also makes it tough to make room for more."
"A little too much carbonation for me. I've had worse beers, but as far as imperial stouts go, I've had better. I might buy this again as its not something that I can get regularly, but it isn't something I will hunt down."
"This poured a deep dark black-brown color with a thick brownish bubbly head. It has a great complex aroma of chocolate and coffee and caramel tones. Taste was a bit bitter compared to the aroma and you can tell it's a higher ABV Imperial - there's a bit of a pungent alcohol kick on the front of it. But the lingering tastes and aftertastes of this complex, full bodied stout are sweet and delicious, keeping you coming back for more of it. A great stout."
"I enjoyed drinking this as it was very different from most imperial stouts out there, but wouldn't make a habit of it either."
"This is a big beer. Not as complex as I would have preferred, but still decent. Certainly worth a try. This is good but it could have been great."
"Poured from the gray 26 ounce bottle into a DFH snifter. Amazingly dark, viscous, and opaque with a dark brown head which doesn't stick around too long. Strong chocolate, coffee, and alcohol scents abound. The mouthfeel is amazing, thick and silky. Flavors are intense, a mixture of dark chocolate, espresso, and a balancing hop bitterness as well as some alcohol. A truly special imperial stout which was cellared for about 18 months and could probably have withstood another 18 months. 11 percent ABV is masked quite well in the flavors, but still makes the drinkability lower than it would be. Paid 13.99 for it and I think it was worth every penny."
"Based on the experience alone, this is not hard to down in the least. But considering the 11% ABV, and man is this sucker rich, it's a one and done sort of deal. Definitely an impressive beast of a beer (and four years old too!)."
"D:Pretty well blanced. At times a strong alcohol taste that lingers throughout."
"D: For all it's complexities this brew is insanely balanced. Each flavor overlaps the next. Very boozy in the nose but nearly as imposing in taste. A special treat to be savored over time and the perfect compliment to a fine meal."
"I'll also add that this is one beer where my review of the aged brew is much better than fresh. It'd be hard for me to rate anything but appearance above a 3 for the fresh beer, with drinkability lower than that. Rogue recommends aging one year, but give it two or three if you can."
"D - It did get a little bit better as it warmed, but really I see nothing outstanding here. Maybe I'll try a fresher one and re-review."
"A bit ponderous, a real fire-side sipper. But a beefy example of the style that satisfied the malt lover in me. A bit pricey, but a nice indulgence. Would go great with fine chocolate, a steak or game"
"Drinkability: YES. Awesome anytime. I could probably drink about two."
"Purchased at Sams ( I think it was a little pricey like 12-14 bucks), bottle says 2006 chilled and poured into nonic. Black, like motor oil completely opaque body and two centimeter light milk chocolate head, with lacing. Toasted barely, black patent, subtle hints of dark chocolate and roasted coffee come to the fore of the scent. The hops are mild and provide some nice complexity. There is a slight creaminess that rounds this out, there is also a slight smoky, saltiness which is quite nice especially on a cold day and makes this all the more hearty. Taste is definitely hearty, the toasted barely, black patent are present with hints of chocolate and interesting hop bitterness. Flavor wise this very much has a strong roasted coffee character, bolstered by enhanced bitterness. I would however be very much interested in tasting a three or even four-year-old version of this especially after the hops have mellowed out. The alcohol is extremely subdued in the nose and really only manifests in a slow warmth, that said this is no weakling in fact the opposite. It is a beautiful bottle of beer, a hell of an IMP, but I would still like to taste it a little older not my fav., but totally worth a the experience."
"Poured opaque brown with a small amount of tan rim lacing. Looked like root beer going in as it passed through the light. Moderately aromatic...like an alcoholic tootsie roll. Thick mouthfeel. Very smooth dark chocolate flavor with a moderate roast coffee aftertaste. 11%...now you tell me!! Very drinkable. Too bad only have a couple left. Cheers!"
"D - I don't think I could make it a regular beer, but it's a nice change of pace from my usual IPAs. The heaviness is a bit much for regular consumption."
"Overall a great brew, not too mention a bit expensive. About the same price for a decent wine."
"poured super black. definitly could pass for old motor oil in color. the head was nice and caramel brown, which left some awesome lacing. he nose is upfront with the coffee aromas, with some underlying sweetness present. the taste is much of the same. nice roasted malt flavor, coffee, dark fruit kind of sweetness, definitly some caramel flavors present. definitly my favorite stout style and quite possibly one of the best RIS i've ever tried. a little pricey for a bottle although amazing on tap, but i think it would be worth the price to age for a few then taste."
"D: Good stuff right here. A complex, big beer, that doesnt run out of control. Everything is very balanced. The only problem keeping this beer down its drink ability is the price. Other than that, this stuff is great."
"750ml black painted porcelain ""XS"" bottle. The beer pours pitch black in color with a one finger brown head that stick all over the sides of the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malt, dark ripe fruits, dark chocolate and alcohol. The taste is dark roasted malts, dark bitter chocolate and quite a bite from the hops in the finish with a lingering warming sensation from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is big and delightfully smooth. Overall, this is another solid brew from Rogue that I look forward to trying my other bottle in a few years as it should be even better then."
"doesn't get much better than this. what a wicked brew."
"D- It is a great stout. Had this in a blind tasting with the Dark Lord. It did hold its own. I like how much hops they put in it also to break up the tons of malts."
"d - you can feel it in your stomach after two or three sips just sitting there. gives a nice warming sensation but the alcohol is never evident throughout. it's a shame they don't bottle this in 12 oz anymore, rogue should reconsider that. i have one more from this year and i'll be sad when it's gone but better off for having had the experience."
"Drinkability suffers slightly for me ,although the ABV and hops are style appropriate."
"This beer pours a little bit a head and that goes away fairly fast leaving behind a pitch black color. The smell a little hoppy and dry with some sweet mollasses tones. The taste is hoppy and dry with some roasty coffee flavor that meets with a taste of alcohol. The mouthfeel is dry, but still a little smooth. Overall I was expecting more flavor and sweeter flavors and less alcohol prevelence."
"D - Rich, tasty and a wonderully aged example of Rogues RIS. Definitely could have had another or two over a frosty winter eve."
"For a ridiculously rich stout, this is remarkably drinkable. Amazing bottle of beer."
"I have had this fresh as well as this aged version, and I have to say that it is better fresh. The hops are brighter and the flavor seems more multi-dimensional. That being said, aged it is still very enjoyable and has some very cool qualities to it."
"The drinkability is good but falls of a bit. One was good for now. Prosit MK"
"This is a nice RIS covered by aggressive alcohol. It's a nice ""sip and savor"" brew."
"2002 bottle found at City Wide Liquors in South Bend, IN. Opaque oily black with a smallish, fading rich brown head. It is leaving some rather nice lacing though. A swirl of my glass stirs up pungant hops that fade to rich dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans. The flavor works just the opposite. Upfront you get a short charge of creamy milk chocolate and a nice cup of joe. That is short lived because the hop flavor and bitterness are WAY over the top. So much so that it is a big turn off. The palate is rich and creamy. Crank back the hops a bit and we have a real winner."
"As much as I tried to come to grips with this beer I simply could not. It was too salty and too alcohol rich for me to stomach. It seemed as if four years time had taken a toll on an otherwise fine beer."
"It has aged incredibly. I have a new bottle recently received but am now thinking I should lock it up for 4 years to open when miracles might happen again."
"Mouth-Feel: An extremely syrupy in the mouth with an absolute perfect creamy smoothness. This brews mouth-feel is the shit! (Excuse my language)"
"Thick, deep black, beautiful brew. Has a moderate tan head with little lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malt, hints of alcohol, and some fruits. Taste is bitter of hops, finishes off sweet and roasted. Nice complex taste for a stout. With a medium body and the right amount of carbonation, this brew is very tasty. High in ABV but still very drinkable."
"Bring it back in the little bottles, Rogue, I'll buy more!"
"No wonder this is a top 100."
"All in all, another winner from Rogue, and a staple every time I go to one of their pubs. It's about as drinkable as any imperial stout, which is to say that a glass or two is all that most people will be able to handle."
"Pours black, one of the thickest darkest beers out there, with minimal tan head. The smell is amazing, some alcohol with tons of sweet notes and characteristics. Taste starts very sweet and fades to an small alcohol but mostly malt flavor. The mouthfeel is great, a good balance of flavor. I could drink these anytime. A wonderful beer that you have to check out. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and chewy and every bit as sumptuous as its legs in the glass suggest. Drinkable, oh baby yes  still astounded as to the lack of alcohol sting for being such a strong beer. Dangerously drinkable and in too large a bottle; this one would be quite a seductive mistress were it not for the price of the (admittedly cool) ceramic bottle. Cheers Rogue, a world-class treat that you must sell in 12oz bottles again!"
"Pours absolute black, very slight brown head and minimal lacing. Smells of burnt malts, chocolate, and dark fruits. First sip leaves an impression of smoke and charcoal, dark fruit, and slight hops. Very, very complex and tasty. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with very little carbonation. I only bought a single bottle of this but now I want more to study it a little deeper."
"That extra half a percent in ABV I notice very easily!"
"I am currently sipping on a three year old bottle of this, still in the 12 oz. glass format. As i come back to this beer, I can't help but be underwhelmed with this beer versus the style. Maybe the hops have degraded some, but the flavor is definitely not up there with the best in the style. . After enjoying many others from the style, I felt I overrated it earlier."
"It pours like syrup and looks like strong, black coffee in the glass. There is an aroma of espresso with fruity undertones. This beer immediately stings your tongue when you sip it. The high ABV is readily apparent. The taste stays with you as the beer seems to coat your entire mouth long after each sip. Drinkability is excellent for such a strong beer. I am already looking forward to my next glass."
"Overall: Rogue Imperial Stout was already amongst my favourites in its class, and finding this 3 year aged version of it just solidified my already high opinion of this beer. Truly exceptional and IMO the best beer in a very depthy portfolio."
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle dated 2002. Jet black, with garnet highlights when held up against the light. Small head without much retention, but some lacing. Aroma has lots of dark fruit, chocolate and some hops. Taste is much the same. A very well-made beer. Alcohol is present, but there's enough flavor going on that it doesn't dominate. Full bodied, appropriately carbonated. Drank it slow, but because it could be savored. Good drinkability."
"I'll definately look for this in the bottle, but I'm sure I couldn't drink more than one in a sitting!"
"Appearance is suitably dark, its not much different than the Rogue XS bottle it came in. When held to a light source there is a hint of brown around the edge. Dark brown head dissipates quickly. Nice legs though. Smell is of roasted and chocolate malts, alcohol, and faint English hops (I just looked on Rogue's site post-tasting, I was smelling the Willamette). Flavor is big in-your-face roasted malt with some chocolatey undertones, a slight raisin taste and some bitterness from hops, some almost seems like roast bitter. Not the kind of depth I was hoping for. Mouthfeel is ok, drier than I'd like. Drinkability is low. I could have maybe 3 pints of this. Maybe. I had high expectations for this, as I like Rogue, so I'll say perhaps this beer just needs some aging time."
"Had with a grilled N.Y. strip steak, baked potato and corn on the cob on the charcoal grill. Excellent!"
"D - Give me two 750's on a cold winter night and let me be. This is an all night drinker. Let there be three inches of snow on the ground and me in front of a fire with this beer in hand and you wont find a happier man."
"Ron"
"Overall, this is a stout to be reckoned with. Be ready for some very strong flavors and even strong aftertastes. Sip and savor this beauty. This, of course, is a MUST have stout...one of the best!"
"12 oz Bottled in 2003. Pours thick and black with a minimal tan-brown-reddish head which immediately fades back, some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Great aroma, there is some cofee, rich booziness, ripe fruits from a lighter sweet grapiness to a heavier richer prune aroma. Also a little bit of sweet chocolate, and although it's not bourbon aged, there is a very nice bourbony smell. Taste up front is a little roasted malt flavor mixed with a little sweet chocolate, a little thinner probably from age but still good size body and fairly creamy. From the sweetness up front the taste switches over to a hop and alcohol mix, there is still a decent bitterness and dryness on the tongue along with a nice warm alcohol. There is also a hint of smokiness in the finish. After three or so years in the bottle the hops are still kicking pretty well. Very nice sipping beer tonite."
"This brew is a bit too intense for my taste. I'm not a huge Imperial Stout fan as it is, but I have had some good experiences with them. I assume this beer accomplishes what it's trying to do, but it's just not my style. It will take me multiple sittings to empty the bottle, which makes the swing top all too convenient."
"High ABV, intsense flavor, bitterness, acidity, all make this beer less drinkable. But believe me, I would drink this stuff every morning with bacon and eggs given the chance. It's absolutely superb!"
"Flavor was a bit harsh. Alcohol was just a tad high making this slightly less than wonderfully smooth. Flavors included coffee, dark chocolate and burnt toast. Some bitterness from the hops. Even just slightly sour too. Thick and heavy mouthfeel. This beer held up consistently even as the beer warmed."
"Probably the best stout I've ever had. There was nothing about this massive beer that I didn't like - it deserves much respect!"
"Drinkability: A great brew , a special one to enjoy with friends who enjoy big beers."
"a little heavy on the alcohol for me personally, so not as drinkable as i like, but great all the same"
"Drinkability: this was a meal in disguise, but I found this to be quite quaffable minus the alcohol levels. An all-around great beer everyone should try."
"drinkability: one of the rougher ones for me"
"Drinkability: A remarkably drinkable beer considering the aggressive character. All the rich bitterness and malts a stout fan could ask for, while remaining a characteristically Rogue-ish offering. From the first pour to the last sip, this was great."
"Drinkabilty/Overall: quite nice, plenty of complexity and balance, though it comes off a bit boozy, detracting from the drinkability a bit. Still a top notch ADS at the top of our Big Stout Session."
"Very solid example of an Double Stout from Rogue. Nothing spectacular, but an interesting brew."
"Cheers!"
"D: A dark, rich decadent beer. Easy to finish. Quite good and one I'd recommend to anyone as a fine version of an Imperial/Double Stout."
"Drinkability is good for this strong of a beer. I'll be back for more."
"750 mL ceramic bottle, capped but with a swing-top cap for resealing. No date, but I'm sure this is no more than a year old. Enjoyed from a 17-ounce snifter. Pours like motor oil draining after 8000 miles: black tar with a dense cloud of espresso-colored froth on top. Aromas of thick brewed dark hot chocolate and pine sap along with a black roastiness. Flavors of malt scorched black by a cast-iron cauldron, baker's chocolate, spruce sap, a bitter alcohol-laced vinous quality, and a burnt, earthy, mineral twang at the finish. Just infinitely complex. The mouthfeel is incredibly dense and viscous. This is relatively fresh, so the alcohol is definitely noticeable and appropriately harsh. Without a doubt, a most drinkable Imperial Stout. Anyway, this is so good it *almost* justifies the exorbitant price tag for a 750 mL ceramic swingtop growler ($14.95 in my neck of the woods)."
"I don't know about this one. I'm usually a fan of big beers, but I had trouble splitting at 12 oz. bottle. It pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Smells of dark, very malty chocolate. My first thoughts on the flavor are that they remind me of both Bigfoot, Double Bastard and Brooklyn BCS. Heavy chocolate with a strong malty backbone and strong hop bitterness. Flavor expands when the beer is at room temp, but the alcohol also becomes more evidence. Plenty of black coffee and espresso with dark, dark fruity malt flavors. Good mouthfeel, but I just cant drink much of this."
"Drinkability: At 10.5%, the drinkability to tough to start with. Add to that the myriad of flavors that try to emerge and the whole thing seems overdone."
"mmmm, vintage 2003. Seriously dark black with a thick head of choclate milk color. Smells of roastd grain with a sweetness of malt and alcohol. Nice big taste of heady roasty toasty malt with a smoothness and a slight bit of piney hops. Good to the last drop I will have to find some more. Drink it warm."
"Wow was I in for a treat with this beer. It pours jet black with a slighly smaller than expected tan head. The little head creates some lace but evenutally dissipates. The smell has strong hints of sweet dark roasted malts. The taste for this beer is fantastic. It hits you at first with some sweet chocolate flavors and then follows with a nice roasted characteristic before finishing with a nicely balanced amount of bitterness. Some could argue that the bitterness is too much but I loved it. It is nice and creamy in your mouth with just enough carbonation which eventually dissipates but this beer is not any less enjoyable without the carbonation. Overall, highly drinkable possibly the best stout I have had to date."
"Absolute crude oil black appearance with no hues whatsoever, even when held to direct sunlight. Just blackness! Head is thin and dark brown with lovely lacing. A superb looker. Hansom as Imp. Stouts come. Aroma is a bit lacking in comparison to some of the better thought of Imp. Stouts. Still, there is much to be said of it: Plenty of roastedness, black currants, espresso, anise, cocoa, and spiced rum. Flavor is magnificent. Alcohol content is well covered. Deeply grainy with strong coffee and cocoa flavors. Mild hop presence. Subtle vinous qualities. Mouthfeel is sublimely smooth. Wildly drinkable. Quite dangerous really. When I mentioned that the alcohol was well concealed I meant it. I can see myself drinking several pints of this and then collapsing from my bar stool when I stand up to use the mens room. The booze in this can really creep up on you. Wonderful beer."
"Came in a 7 oz. bottle labelled Rogue XS Imperial Stout. Bottled 2000. Has a different picture than what is shown above, but otherwise is presumably the same beer. Pours a deep purplish wine color. At bottom it appears blackish but tapers off to a lovely purple near the rim. Nose is a fruity raisin blended with brown sugar and roasted malt, alcohol apparent but well blended. Mouthfeel is viscous, chewy, coats the tongue perceptibly. Taste is of aged prunes, raisins. A sour finish leading up to a lingering sugary malt taste. Alcohol is well balanced but readily apparent. In all the alcohol is fairly laid back but the taste still packs a wallop. Glad this came in a 7 oz bottle, and at only $3.99 a pop I couldnt recommend this one more, although I cant imagine drinking more than one of these at a sitting."
"The sediment at the bottom of my glass looks like chocolate syrup at the bottom of a milkshake."
"Thanks to orrshow for splitting this bottle with me."
"Overall: Good but oh so bitter. Puts hair on your chest, as they say. A real ""man's beer."""
"D - moderate, bitter, but easy down, and a sweet aftertaste"
"A very nice stout. I really enjoyed it and I think that if its ABV was lower it could be near the best stout Ive had."
"I got one of these from the local CT Bev Mart for $9. Now I've heard so much about this beer I just had to get one. It would be the first Russian Imperial I've ever tried so I was excited. Poured from the bottle into a glass this beer is very dark. The smell of chocolate,coffee, and maltiness when I put it to my nose. As I taste it Wow a nice balance of coffee flavor and bitterness hit my mouth. Now at 10.5% you can taste the alcohol but its not bad. I sipped this one and enjoyed it. This is probably the best Rouge I've had yet."
"D: This one's a sipper... but damn it's good."
"This beer would go well with some baker's chocolate."
"12 oz. bottle. 2003 vintage. enjoyed on 11/9/05. Pours pitch black with a very thin, brown head that quickly fades to a ring around the side of the glass. Aroma is big on roasted goodness, chocolate, coffee, molases, dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is chocolate, raisins, prunes, coffee and molases. A touch of citrus hops come in at the end. The finish is long, bitter and warming. The mouthfeel is soft, smooth and luxorious. This beer has really mellowed out with the 2+ years of aging. The alcohol is well hidden."
"This is much better than I thought it would be. The best Rogue beer I've tried."
"2003 Vintage. Black in colour with low carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, dried fruits, alcohol, and a bit of hops. Heavy in the mouth with flavors of plum, dark chocolate, espresso, raisins, and a bit of caramel and tannic wood. Long finish, with a fair bit of bitterness. I would have liked to have seen a bit more caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors, and a bit less fruit, but still a very nice impy."
"Drinkability: Packed with flavor, sensually stimulating, and great all around. One of the most flavorful stouts I've yet had. Could drink them all night."
"Absolutely, positively worth every single penny of the $15 I paid for it. This bottle was only one year old, but I think it could have gone for at least another two. I think I'm going to have to buy a few of this years vintage and stash them away. Simply amazing."
"I generally enjoyed this but a question kept coming to mind....Is it past its prime?"
"overall, one of the best stouts i've ever tasted, superb cask conditioned brew, i fell in love with this one and will definitely have again."
"Fresh bottles are a little too hoppy so I am lowering my score."
"Aside from the bitterness, this is a very nice beer. I dont think the bitterness is balanced and may be due to some burning or tanins of some sort; I dont know. The body was a little thin for me, but still medium-full bodied. Some balance would do wonders here. I think one ceramic bomber of this baby is all I can handle at the moment. I wouldnt mind trying another in a year or two. Very good Imperial."
"I love the Ceramic bottle. Very cool look. Pours black with an awesome dark tan head that lasts forever. Great lacing throughout. Nutty, malty aromas. Some Coffee. Flavor explosion! Coffee, chocolate malty goodness. Very thick and syrupy mouthfell makes this an easier drink than a lot of Imp Stouts. Outstanding"
"Bottled in 2003. Pours dark black, nice dark tan film, subtle carbonation. Smell has notes of chocolate, licorice, and a hint of coffee. Taste starts out lightly sweet and chocolatey and then turns to a bitter, slightly sour, and immensely alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is thick, with light bubbles. Overall the drinkablility is lowered due to the strong alcohol finish. It is not hidden well and tastes much stronger than other beers at this level. The malt flavor seems nice but I can barely experience much of it once the alcohol takes over. I was expecting much more..."
"Overall this has been one of my favorite stouts. While at first I though the price was rather pricey, looking back I don't think it was. I got three incredible beers out of that bottle and a great bottle that I will be reusing. This is now on my top 10 list of beers I love."
"Bottle vintage 2002 found in the cooler at City Wide in South Bend. Pours black with a brown tawny head, looks very thick. Odor is chocolatey with some odors of malt and unidentifiable dark fruits. kind of a weak overall smell though. taste was disappointing. bitter hoppiness, burnt-tasting. Roasted malt finish. none of the dark fruit taste i expected from the smell. not as tasty as it looked. think mouthfeel is about right. overall, the beer is ok, and you'd be hard pressed to find me a stout that i really hated, but im very surprized that it wasn't a lot better considering the pedigree and style. to quote a drinking buddy: ""meh."""
"A slick taste and very easy to drink for a Imp Stout."
"I have not tried a more fresh bottle but I can say considering it being three years old this beer ages exquisitely."
"One might have to do it...very high ABV."
"Overall a superior stout - along with Victory Storm King - one of my favorites. Highly recommended. IPAs are my favorite style, but these excellent stouts are beginning to change my mind."
"I enjoyed some homemade oatmeal cookies with this beer, which paired quite well."
"This beer poured out of the over priced ceramic bomber an inky black with a tall frothy tan head that fell to a ring around my glass. Smells of roasted barley, with notes of coffee and chocolate and a subtle sour dark fruit with a nip of grassy hops. Somehow, a prominent alcohol smell makes its way through all of this to my nose. Tastes of light roasted cappuccino with a creamy chocolate milk sweetness along with some ambiguous vegetable presence. Towards the end, the alcohol reappears. Finishes with a swift kick of woody hops and lingering chocolates. The mouth feel was medium to thick in body with a very light carbonation. The milky character of this beer really caught me by surprise. I enjoyed this beer immensely because of it. However, what I didnt enjoy was the gigantic wad of doughy tar colored goo that plopped out of the bottle into my glass. This thing was huge! Being curious, I tasted it and it was a lot more hoppy that the beer itself. It came apart with a few swirls around the bottom of my glass, but it really surprised me as it was about the size of a super ball. Over all, the milkiness of this beer is a nice change of pace for an IS. I look forward to my next bottle."
"This is quite a brew; It packs a serious punch. It's delicious, but go in expecting the high alcohol and you won't be dissappointed."
"Gorgeous stout. One of the best I've had. A little pricey, but worth it a few times a year. Will definately be getting a few bombers to sit on and sample throughout the year."
"It would be hard to drink a lot of these in a row, but it was all that I was expecting. Kind of expensive, however. But not a bad choice if you are splurging."
" Taste runs the gamut of stout flavors. Burnt and roasted flavors, dark chocolate, slight anise, slightly piney hops. Vinous notes are developing. Bitter finish. This could probably age two more years before declining. Mouthfeel is thick as hell, I feel as though I should be using a straw. Carbonation is impressive given the age and alcohol. Drinkability is perfect, as is everything about this beer."
"I havent had this out of the bottle, but off the beer-engine and served quite warm, it really let the flavors and mouthfeel shine. The hops are definitely a force to be reckoned with and teeter on overpowering the brew. Still, its very tasty."
"The taste is much more complex, however. Roasted malts are here, but the coffee takes over midway through. A molasses like sweetness is also there until the finish, when bitter coffee and hop bitterness dominates, along with the dark bitter chocolate. I'm not finding much fruit here, but maybe it has faded with age. Alcohol is never a factor. The mouthfeel is pretty thick but not overbearing by today's standards. I could drink this all night!"
"I paid $16.99 for this 750mL ceramic bottle, and I don't think I was cheated at all. A very good beer for a very good drinking experience. While the notes for this review were all written upon the initial impression of the beer, I drank about a third of the bottle on the first night, then stoppered it with the built-in cork and finished it off the next day. No appreciable deprecation in quality. I'll bet you could cellar this for years and still have a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a thick black sludge, very dark beer, with a dark tan head building after full pour, fading to a thin film with residual bubbles. Love the look. Smells of heavily roasted malts primarily, with stong hint of an espresso coffee with dark chocolate hue underneath, and can easily detect the alcohol. As taste and mouth goes, this is what a stout is supposed to be. Thick, velvety, creamlike finish, it has heavily roasted malt presense with an alcohol presense that isn't oppressive, with a wonderful espresso aftertaste that just hangs there. Greatness in a glass. I've had quite a few offerings from Rogue, but never this beer, and it has just claimed favorite stout status. Don't know that I'd be able to drink more than a few of these, but thats like taking points off for not likeing the colors on the bottle label. Or in other words, this is a fantastic beer."
"D: This one is a little pricey, but well worth it. I'm curious to see if the rubber stopper thingy on this bottle actually works, but I doubt that I'm going to have any of this left. Highly recommended."
"This is truly an exceptional imperial stout. A highly recommended sipper. Exceeds any other stout in this style that I've had to date."
"If there are any spelling errors in this review, forgive me, as I am approaching the end of a pint of this strong brew. It poured thick, viscous and velvety with a pefect looking dark brown head, with lace that stuck around every time I took a breather from sipping. Smelled like rich chocolate, sugar cane, rum, bourbon, light fruit...and im sure much more that I couldn't quite determine. Thre alcohol presence on this beer was definetly present, yet I could certainly put down another one without too much trouble. There also was a mild hop presence which I believe complimented the taste rather well. So often when I try a strong stout, I feel like theres a complete absense of hops that as a result makes the beer seem almost too milky and creamy, almost kahlua like. This beer on the other hand delivers on all fronts. In closing, I would suggest that you be careful with this beer...as tasty as it is, that alcohol can sneak right up on you as it is one big bastard of a beer. drink up"
"Poured black as used motor oil. Couldn't get much of a head on the beer even though I glugged the bottle. A very chocolatey smell and you can taste it too. Slight bitter aftertaste kinda spoils the taste. Overall a very good beer and definitely something I would pick up again."
"taste is more bitter than expected; sweet, chocolately raisins in the mouth but washed over with bitter, resiny hops in the aftertaste. thick, syrupy mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation. assertive beer, but very drinkable (until the 10.5% kicks in)."
"Strong stuff, burnt and bitter, a tough stout. Alcohol shows on the nose and in the stomach without disrupting the taste. on-tap @ Crane Alley, Champaign, IL. souped up, so damn tasty you want more"
"So much was going on with this beer, both small and taste wise, its hard to list everything. The smell was mostly roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit, while the taste had an incredible balance of caramel, roast malts, espresso and coffee, chocolate, sweet druits, dark fruits. Even though it was a pretty intense beer, I could drink several, if only to experience the blending of flavors almost perfectly. Hats off to Rogue, once agian."
"On balance, this beer has improved a big time since its comrade was sacrificed by me some six months ago. The texture softens and flavour thickens, while the most important coffeeish edge of Imperial Stout becomes much more enjoyable without compromising the intensity of the bitterness. Looking forward to trying it in another six month's time!"
"D- This beer is a big stout but it has lots of complexity and the flavors compliment each other to create a good balance. The hops come through nicely and the alcohol helps add the perception of more hops."
"Drinkability: Wow! This is the first beer I have that was aged this long. Vintage date 2001 this is really good and I am going to buy a few more."
"Quite similar to Goose Island's Bourbon Co. Stout, despite the lack of bourbon barrel aging. The thickness, darkness, and aggression is all there. Looks as black as you could ever expect a stout to look. Brown head retention the is unwaivering. Aromas are deep, malty, roasty, expresso, nuts, raisons, prunes...the list goes on. Flavors: see aroma. Overwhelming in the first sips. Becomes more fruity as the beer goes down. Dark dried fruits compound the chocolate and coffee flavors. Hop bittering and flavor add much more than just balance, it adds complexity, bite, and intimidation. Close to being a perfect stout. Only the harsh coffee and chocolate (chalk like) compounded with hop bite and alcoholic heat makes this beer less drinkable than a few others out there. Nevertheless, it's one to keep in the fridge."
"Bottle (2004 drank in 2005): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a huge foamy dark brown head with average retention. Aroma of chocolate and toffee is dominant and quite enjoyable. The roasted malt with a good chocolate undertone also dominates taste. I cant say I really did notice a high hops profile but was not too bothered by that. Body is above average and alcohol is very well hidden which is a feat. Overall, very nice example which is well balance but would have preferred a bit more complexity."
"for the price, I'm out."
"The drinkability is very good. Easy to drink, tasty and the alcohol is undetectable."
"Carbonation is excellent for the style, very creamy - velvety. Despite the high abv, this one goes done really smooth. Dangeoursly drinkable. Wonderful! Alas, it is far too expensive for my budget to enjoy more than a few times a year ($3.50 for a 12 oz)."
"Mouthfeel is big, thick and creamy with a smoothed out carbonation that allows it to flow down very easily. At 10.5% the abv is very well hidden and makes it easy for you to get ahead of yourself while drinking it. I would gladly drink another if given the opportunity..but at this abv it's really more of an occasional treat. Truly one of the best imperial stouts around. I'm glad I have a 2003 waiting patiently for me in the cellar. Rogue...please bring back the 12oz XS bottles, please??"
"Now I have to go get one of these that is freshly bottled to compare with the 2 yr old version."
"This is one assignment I shan't procrastinate about."
"This brew pours an opaque black color with a small tan head that recedes within seconds. Lacing is sparse. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and alcohol. The taste is like the aroma. Chocolate, roasted malt, and bitterness, fill the sip, while alcohol warms the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a good brew, but there are a number of better big stouts that I would rather drink."
"Faint hints of scotch whisky and just the faintest hint of age-related cardboard come up towards the end of the bottle. I think the 2001 Vintage has just crested...so if you've got 'em, drink and love them now instead of later."
"Thanks to waldowin for the sample. Thick, viscuous appearance. Extremely black in color. Good sized roasted aroma. Has a slight mellow sweetness about it. Big roasted flavor upfront-hints of anise and HEAVILY roasted malt. The roasted flavor is quite big and has a very dry aftertase. Slight oak and sherry flavors. Nice full mouthfeel. Definately a sipper. Not too sure how much I like the dry finish. A great imperial stout but not one I could drink a lot of in one sitting."
"NOTE: I've got a few more of these in the cellar, from 2004. I am going to try to age one each fall /early winter, to see how the brew ages. Nonetheless, if you have a 2004, it's ready now!"
"D - Definitely one I enjoy sipping. I'd like to have a few of thes on hand during the cold winter months to come."
"a liquid poem that begs for moderation."
"Pours a jet black liquid with a large three finger tan head.the head is a light brown,superb.The aroma is a dark chocolate and coffee,very fragrant.This has a black coffee,dark chocolate taste with a warm alcohol glow.This is very creamy and delicious.A full heavy m/f that is perfect for this type.As far as drinkability goes,I would buy this all the time if I could find it,but it is hard to find.Great job Rogue!"
"Drinkability: I definitely couldn't of had another! Quite drinkable, but I felt that one was enough. Also not something I would drink every day."
"D - This is definilty one good RIS. for its style pretty good."
"this is an interesting beer. it is the 2001 edition so it's probablya bit over-aged at this point. The look was awesoem with a rich reddish brown head. the smell followed trhough, a little nutty, and a little bit fo a citrus or cherry but distinctely chocolatey. Teh taste was pretty overwhelmingly cofee. good, but not terribly balanced. all in all, tasty to try once, but the 6 oz that i had was plenty."
"As an afterthought, I'm debating giving this beer a perfect score. After so much time, I really don't expect any head, and the flavor really deserves a solid 6 on the BA scale. What the hell. I think it's earned it, and sure as hell proved it to me. My only complaint is this is the last sip. My first perfect score. Yeah, it's worth it."
"Fresh bottle from Olivers near NYC. Dark black colour, wide-waffing aroma. Taste is like many other imperial stouts, imperial porters I have had. Maybe a notch below because of sour finish. Very coconut and bitter baker's chocolate presence. Very high alcohol kick."
"Bottled 2003. No head at all and a black as coffee colored beer. Nose is very agressive still even after 2 years giving lots of hops and even more roasty chocolate. Some cacaonote, caramel, malts but overal roasty. As is taste; woww this is mega bitter and burnt. Didn't know that many hop fit in one brew and wonder even more how this one could have come through the lautertun. Anyway good sweetness, alcohol, cacao but mostly just burnt and bitter. Thick mouthfeel with it making the mouthfeel edgy but IMO wonderfull. Hard to drink this much roast and hops in one but to me just great."
"This stuff could seriously hurt coronaholics."
"The alcohol content is high, which has probably been discussed by others already, but the beer is well worth it. Rogue's Imperial Stout is a very, very good beer."
"Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate and expresso. The roasted malts work well with the hop bite. Maybe some black licorice flavor in there, too. Alcohol is not present in the mouthfeel, but it sure is in the gutfeel. Nice and warm down there. An awesome beer, too bad it's not more available for me. Sure would like to have a few of those 750ml ceramic bottles stashed away for a rainy day."
"Drinkability-A good imperial stout, not something that I could drink alot of, or drink every day, but drinkable none the less"
"Pours a completely opaque onyx color, like a black hole swallowing all light that dares enter, and a nice dark tan head that retains well for an 11% abv brew and provides incessant lacing. Aroma is an intense blend of chocolate, blackstrap molasses, floral hops, high quality coffee, vanilla, and some dark fruit perhaps plum or currant. The taste is intense and complex, flavors of unsweetened chocolate, coffee, currant, floral hops, toffee and vanilla as well as the alcohol which is present and noticeable but doesnt distract. There is a slight sweetness present in the background, like blackstrap molasses or burnt brown sugar. The mouthfeel is very creamy, with a huge body (bordering of gigantic) and a slightly astringent, bitter finish with notes of alcohol. A remarkably complex and intricate brew, could definately benefit from a few years of cellaring and would probably be perfect afterwards."
"This beer pours a deep, deep brown. With a thick dark tan head that will diminish to a topcoat and lace the glass thought the session. The smell is deep roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is robust strong and of roasted malts, chocolate, and perhaps coffee flavors with a slight bitter taste and a warmth of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and rich. Drinkability is good. It is strong and as others have mentioned I am also going to pick a few up and let them mellow out."
"6/22/09 - '97 Vintage nip from HimerMan in No BS 4 shared with dirtylou...soy sauce and chocolate malts, great balance with the hops well aged, but nothing I ever really seek out...still, interesting to sample a beer produced well before I'd even entered university"
"Palate- Enormous. It had the elements that I smelled in the aroma, but in huge fashion. I swished it around in my mouth, which develops a big, satisfying milk chocolate character. The finish lasts forever. This is a fascinating beer. Bitterness, sweetness, body and alcohol are in balance."
"Drinkability - I give it a 5 because I think that drinkability is a relative term. Obviously its not as drinkable as a 5% abv pale ale, but its twice as strong. I could easily have 3 or 4 of these without feeling full or getting sick of it."
"Taste is delicious. Mouthfeel is very smooth on the palate, almost creamy but the hops and alcohol make their presence known towards the end. There is a myriad of flavors that come out with each successive drink. Bakers chocolate, oats and coffee come to mind. Very strong malty presence, although the hops do not slouch. A well crafted brew that is very aggressive and complex. Delicious."
"Bottled in 2002. Poured jet black, opaque color with a small tan head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt, and light hoppy notes. Creamy mouthfeel, taste of roasted malts, smoke, chocolate, and light alcohol in the finish."
"I enjoyed this beer, but it's big beer that would be hard to have more than one, especially at 10.5% ABV. But that one beer is worth it. This beer only gets better as you drink it.."
"Taste was, you guessed it, chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. It was sweet but no where near cloying and had a great mouthfeel and it coated the tongue very well. One of the better stouts i have had."
"This beer pours a jet black. The head is dark brown. It fades quickly, leaving thick laces. This beer smells very strongly of alcohol. Hidden behind the alcohol, I detect some coffee. The roasted malt smell is also slightly noticable, but mostly alcohol. The taste is quite similar to the aroma. Alcohol warms my throat. It has a coffee taste also. Chocolate flavors mix in as well. It is sweet also. This beer is quite thick. It coats my throat and stomach as it goes down. Due to the high alcohol content of this beer, it might not make a good session beer. Also, the flavor is very aggressive. I like it, but some might not. It is definately worth a try, but if you are unfamiliar with the style, you might want to try something else first."
"12 oz bottle bottle in 2003 poured into a pint glass. Deep black with no light visible, a finger of brown head fades quickly to a ring. Smell is very nice--roasted malt, black licorice, dark chocolate, cofee, dark fruits--very appealing. Taste is an excellent roasty dark malt with strong chocolate and expresso flavors, a nice smooth alchohol warmth, and a slightly hoppy burnt finish. Very thick and fullbodied for a rich creamy feel. Only the price and the high ABV keep it from being an everyday beer. This is an oustanding tasting stout."
"Drinkability- Right up there with Stone and Old Rasputin IMO. Hard to find a flaw with any of these. ABV kicks in fairly hard towards the middle. One of these is plenty. Worth a $13 investment of whatever you can get it for in your area."
"Black elixir with a neat cocoa powder head and cascading carbonation. She's gorgeous. Smell is alcohol, hops, burnt sugars, coffee...there is a lot happening here. Taste follows the same pattern of alcohol burn, hop bite, roasty malts, some chocolate and anise. Mouthfeel is slick and full early, the sweetness helps out in the middle, but the hops taint the finish for me. They have an ashen quality after following the big flavors. Maybe it's my palate (I have been under the weather the past few days.) Drinkability is tainted by two things: big ABV and big price tag. This beer set me back at least $14. Steep when compared to other quality brews in the same style. Hey, my son gets a ceramic flip top bottle so not all is lost."
"Pours a deep black, no light visible with a tan head and plenty of lacing. Smell is grassy and floral hops, with some roasty malt. Taste is amazing, malty, roasted grains, chocolate roast finish and a coffee aftertaste with grassy hops up the ass. Full mouth, very thick and chewy, creamy, amazing beer. Thanks DrJay."
"2003: Completely opaque black, no sign of highlights. Rich, dark brown head, good retention and lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, earthy hops, ripe fruits. Sweet and malty flavour with a (relatively) mild bitterness, roasted and chocolate still there, a slight hop character and a bit of yeastiness. Medium dry finish with a slight alcohol warming. Thick, full body. Very nice. Surprisingly easy to drink considering the body and abv. Definitely a fine imperial stout."
"The 1997 may be a little past its prime-- the taste balance is a little off, and the finish is a tad abrasive, but this is still a very good beer. That being said, I dont know if I could have drank more than 7 oz. At once."
"Really like this beer, one of my favourite imperial stouts. Couldnt drink too many in one sitting though (or with a lot of food) as its a very heavy brew"
"Buy a few bottles and stash them for a couple years."
"Music: Mind yer own fucking business.like you care!!"
"The smell is of dark malts with hints of dark fruits and chocolate. The taste is very good, with malt and chocolate taking over in the middle while hops dominate the finish. The mouthfeel is very full while drinkability is good for the contents."
"It pours a deep deep black color with a very small tan to brownish head that falls to form sporadic rafts over the liquid. Very nice. The nose is nice, with some big figgy and chocolate aromas, along with puffs of alcohol. The flavor is initially big and sweet, almost like raw molasses, but that moves very quickly to a raw roasted coffee bitter, finishing with just a hint of chocolate sweetness. I relaly like the transitions with the flavors. Very nice. The feel is thick, with a slight slick, syrupyness to it. The carbonation is light. I just had to check the alcohol on this, and its hard to believe it is so big. I like the brew a lot."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, UK import. Bottled in 2003. Trade with maeib. Opaque pitch black, moderate brown head. Pleasant roasty aroma, hints of dark fruits, chocolate and liquorice. Flavour, on the other hand, is not particularly pleasant. From start to finish it is dominated by a one-dimensional intense bitterness of extremely strong and poorly made coffee, masks any other flavour (including the alcohol) which otherwise might be present. Want a definition of ""over-kill""? Here it is! As Queen Victoria would have said: ""We are not amused!"" Apart from the looks and the aroma: Very disappointing."
"Paired bottle four with really rich chocolate fudge cake, great pairing although it really brings out the alcohol"
"750 ml ceramic, capped and with flip top bottle. The first year these bottles were released."
"The big difference this time (as in the last few bottles over the last few months) is that there has not been a holding or discernable head. I don't know what can cause that type of change in a beer consistenly but it's been that way. That detracts from the appearance a bit. The taste is a bit fuller with more sensations coming out each time... a very light hint of lemongrass right at the beginning of the finish. Some milk-like tones across the tongue. A bit more bitterness at the beginning but still quite good. The thickness is still pretty darn good although I think it got a bit thinner recently."
"Pours opaque black, with a tan brown head. Swirling aroma of coffee, prunes, chocolate and caramel. Some dark fruits also present. I love a strong stout, and this certainly hit the spot. Espresso, chocolate, hops and an insane amount of roastiness. Definitely an after dinner drink for me, with some sweet cheesecake. Amazing."
"Overall: This is a pretty good one, but maybe not in the same league as some of the other top American stouts. I was glad I could find this in the aged 12 oz. bottle, but I don't think I'd shell out the exorbitant swing-top price when I could pick up lots of Storm King or Founder's Breakfast Stout, both of which are better beers to me, for the same money."
"Taste is a creamy biting bitter chocolate ..Rich bitter chocolate and more and more coffee flavor as it warms. Roasted nuttiness. Big and rich and malty. Big beer with a long dry bitter aftertaste to offset the sweetness nicely. Pretty damned tasty. A classic at 3 years. Get some of this. By any means necessary."
"Pours black. Blacker than black really. I think there is dark matter in my glass rather than beer. Topped off by a rather substantial bubbly head for an 11% abv beer which diminishes to bubbles on the surface. The head is the colour of chocolate milk. I've never seen a head quite so dark before. This is a formidable looking brew. I like it. Putting the nose up the glass, an aroma of dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate, and some roasted malt comes through along with some alcohol. Quite nice. At first sip the chocolate dominates, followed by plums and raisins, then some roasted malts, then by some alcohol warmth, but the unsweetened chocolate notes continue right through. The flavours are bold and in your face. No holding back, or pussy-footing around here. This is a big, bold, and complex beer. Mouthfeel is nice a thick and almost like syrup. Quite lovely. This is an exceedingly drinkable imperial stout. It is dangerously drinkable, I find. The bottle says 11% but I couldn't tell that in a blind taste test. It drinks well below its weight. I'm going to cellar this one, and give some of the harsh edges some time to smooth out. Not that I mind the harshness, in fact I quite enjoy it. I'm curious to see what it does after cellaring for I would imagine that it become absolutely sublime. Thank you Sainsbury's for importing this one into Britain."
"Sweet roasted barley up front. Kind of sweet, with some dark fruit and chocolate notes. Sweetness doesn't last long as a tidal wave of hop and roasted bitterness combine and take over. There must be a shitload of hops in here. Very bitter, yet tongue-numbingly tasty. Two years ago I would not have been able to finish this beer, but now I think I could handle a 750! Bitterness carries into the finish, where it is joined by warming alcohol, peat, faint smoke, and a bit of oak. Very nice. Full-bodied, with a thick (but not cloying), mouth coating feel. A big, in your face stout that's not for the faint of heart, but I love it!"
"overall a great one to try and enjoy numerous times. i got the XS bottle and could go for another."
"Decants pure opaque black, with just the very slightest hint of red near the bottom of the glass. Tall brown head composed of tightly knit bubbles crops up high and proud. Good head retention compliments sticky rings of lacing. Strong coffee aroma with some roasted barley mixed with some dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. Some citric hops are also present in the nose, interesting for this style. Taste is bitter coffee and some chocolate with some black malt, yet balanced by sweet malt. Alcohol is present and a little warming, but stays in the background. Citrous hops are more apparent that I would have imagined, definitely an interesting take on the style. I have often wondered what hopped up stouts would be like, and Rogue has answered that question for me. Cheers for that! Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous, not quite oily, but definitely nice and heavy. Finish is roasted grain and hoppy dry, with some alcohol. I need to grab a few more for the cellar."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad beer, but not yet at it's peak. The alcohol is a bit strong, but should be calmer soon. Definitly a solid brew."
"Thin head, sticking to sides with mocha accents. Deep, dark black hue and unable to see through it. Chocolaty, roasted, wood burning scents on the nose, as well as black strap molasses. Chocolate malt and some roastiness are prevalent, though not overdone  oddly, there does not seem to be anything else that catches the attention of the palate. The feel is one of initial jumpiness, probably due in part to the alcohol, that gently smooths out as the tongue becomes accustomed to the roasted characters. Becomes somewhat clingy as the pour warms with a strong bit through the middle of the tongue. A bit more forgiving that Stones, and in a way more full than the Nailbiter/Thumbsucker."
"Overall, really complex and rewarding. But this beer takes some real commitment on the drinker's part. Don't bother if you're not prepared to really challenge the palate. I'd work up to this one."
"This bottle was aged for a year. The beer is nightblack and redolent of coffee and hops. very big and very smooth I slowed down to drink every essence of this sublime beer. Notes of old dried figs and coffee shop back rooms. Rogue really knows how to make stouts and this is one of their best."
"Anything above 8% is hard for me to order again in succession, but over the long term I'll be coming back to this Impy Stout again and again. Another awesome offering from Rogue."
"12 oz bottle, 2001 vintage. Pours a dark and thick opaque black body with an elegant and creamy light brown head. Good retention and lots of lacing on the glass. Lots of good stout aromas, with bitter burnt coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Very roasty and smoky dark malts run rampant in the nose. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied, with low medium carbonation. Taste is dominated by the toasty, roasted dark malts. Burnt coffee bitterness, some chocolate cake, and a note of black cherries. Just a hint of the big alcohol. Bitter roasted malt finish with a hint of raisins in the aftertaste. Hops presence seems muted with age, and no hops notes were picked up. This one seems unlikely to benefit much from further aging. Very nice American double stout, but I wish I had sampled it when younger for sake of comparison."
"Deep, deep black, with a thick full tan colored head that looks like its here to stay for a long while. The head, when it finally does settle sticks to the side of the glass in a clingy lace. The nose has a rich chocolate character, definite notes of coffee, just a slight citrus hint from the hops. The taste for me was dominated by espresso notes. There is some of the chocolate malt in the back, but I was surprised there wasnt more chocolate up front. Mild hop zing, this is just a little boozy for my taste. That hurts both the mouth feel and the drinakbility. Good beer, just not a great one."
"Great beer...next."
"This is a tough beer. I might call it extreme, for sure brash. I would recommend Samuel Smith's IS or Old Rasputin over this, as they seem more enjoyable. Jeez, Rogue, take it easy! I love beer, don't attack me."
"Bottled in 2003. Nice thick black body with dark caramel head. Head retention could be better, not a lot of lacing. (Though it could be the glass) Nice caramel malt aroma, very sweet and chocolatey. Wonderful mouthfeel! Refreshing and crisp yet at the same time it's bold and full of body and flavor. Taste: awesome. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, great balance with the hops. Great brew!"
"Poured a dark black color with virtual no head what so ever except for around the side of the glass. This is quite possible the darkest beer I've ever seen. After being dissapointed with the appearance I took a good smell of it and was quite surprised by the pleasant roasted malt aroma and was saying to myself I'm in for a treat. I was sorely wrong. For a stout the moutfeel was pretty good. But left a overly bitter aftertaste that would just not go away. The taste itself is quite bland and nothing to get excited about. Overall I did not care for this beer much. The smell is misleading making one think that it'll be a good beer to drink. I can look past the lack of head if the taste and mouthfeel make up for it, but there just isn't really anything about this beer that'll make you come back for another."
"Opaque black with a dense black head that left a bunch of lace around the top of my glass. The aroma is wonderful, some hops and huge malt complexity with a sweet toffee scent, and burnt roasted grains. The flavor is a bit of a disappointment, it has the bitterness and the roasted flavors but it isnt as malt heavy as it smells. I would have liked a lingering malt flavor. The body is okay, if not quite velvety. A good beer."
" Drinkability is good another great beer from a great brewery just wondering does Rouge make any bad beers?"
"This is why I ventured to the Russian Imperial Stout. This is the ultimate. Recent quadrupels reviewed, excuse me. The bully has arrived."
"Very easy to drink, and very enjoyable. The only reason I don't give it a ""5" for drinkability is because at the 10.5% ABV this beer can sneak up on you and force you to remember and respect it potency. Not a beer to sit down and have 4 or 5 of them. Rather, a beer to thoroughly enjoy every last sip of a bottle or two at a time."
"Prosit!"
"Overall: I found this to be very enjoyable, but still probably not as good as expected. Perhaps I just don't know the style well enough or maybe the beer has aged too long."
"Drinkability: Honestly, for a stout (especially a double stout as this one is), it's highly drinkable. Seriously, it didn't take me long to down a glass of it. If you like stouts, do whatever you can to get ahold of this bad boy.. If you're a BA and want a good beer no matter what the style, pick this up right away. Pure nectar. Thanks Rogue!"
"Smooth and a good body. This is a very, very good beer, but it doesn't reach the perfectly-balanced level of excellence of a great stout."
"This is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout ever, though I am not really a huge fan of the style. I actually quite enjoy this offering by Rogue, however. They never cease to amaze me."
"I paired with beer with Rogue Crater Lake Blue cheese which was amazing. I'm going to be buying more of this and less double ipas in the future."
"Wow. What a kick ass stout. There are so many intense flavors and such a complex bitterness. It also lacks the vinous quality sherry like quality that I find in many stouts. Incredible stuff."
"Reflection: This is one of my favorites, if you love stouts and haven't tried this one your missing out!"
"2002 vintage. Pours insanely dark black with a meek head that subsides into a veil that remains throughout the duration of the beer. Ridiculous lacing from this thick, oily brew. Mouthwatering aromas of dark Belgian chocolate, espresso, charred oak, juniper, and a piney blast of hops that reminds me of some dank bud. Everything is here in the tasting along with dark pit fruits, especially plum/prune, intense espresso, gobs of gooey pine, licorice, and earth. Intensely hoppy from beginning to end. Three years in the bottle has done virtually nothing to the integrity of the hops. Smooth and light carbonation, very thick, oily, coating mouths feel. You need a knife and fork for this one. World-class!!!"
"The moderate carbonation level and smooth body make this stout very drinkable though the fact that it is 26 degrees plato means that it has a high level of alcohol and should be respected."
"from the bottle. bottled in 2001. poured black with a brown med sized head. aroma, alcohol. chocolate, roasted malts, prunes, toffee, cherries. flavor, roated malts, chocolate covered raisins, hops, coffee, a nice bitterness, dry chalky. alcohol, licorice, semi sweet red wine. this was vert enjoyable to drink"
"Poured a dark brown, like motor oil. Sweet malt start followed by a average hop bitterness, but the sweetness stays around during the bitterness. Low carbonation. Drinkability average since it is so high in alcohol. Definate malty smell. Bottled in 2003. Says ""Best When Aged 1 Year."" Cannot wait to try past/future years of this brew."
"Had this in a small sniffer, which I found was absolutely perfect for the style... Thanks for the tip Rob from Smokeless! Pours a sinister black with a dark brown head that vanishes rather quickly but leaves a black ale with red edges in the light. Aroma was roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, rather earthy like most Rogues I have tried. Taste was a dry bitterness, coffee, dark chocolate, ridiculously long finish, fantastic. Very rish mouthfeel, syrupy and smooth. Dangerously drinkable, and very potent. Good show Rogue as always! :)"
"Highly drinkable for its size."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thin brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm and rich malty scent that boasts of many crystal, chocolate, and black malts. It also has a nice hop aroma to balance. The taste is good. It has a nice malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm with an earthy aftertaste. It's sweet, yet dry and full of black malts. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation. This is a good Imperial Stout. It lacks a little mouthfeel and head retention, but other than that it really is quite drinkable and enjoyable."
"If it exists, you can taste it in this beer. It's everything an Imperial Stout should be. But maybe a little too much so. While I was blown away by it's complexity at first, I soon found it to be overwhelming. Half a bottle would have been plenty."
"For my tastes, this is an exceptional one-pint beer however I'm sure that many religious stout drinkers would opt for more. I don't believe that a second pint of this could achieve the same sensory results as the first one not only due to the alcohol content, but due to the beer's grand stature."
"Cheers..."
"Overall, a fair impy. Pretty warming on a cool fall night. But that aftertaste is a killer..."
"Yummy."
"A good full mouthfeel, but I couldn't drink more than maybe two of these at a sitting. DAMN it was potent!"
"Comments: Enjoyable, although there are other imperial stouts that I like more."
"Drinkability  This is a must try for any serious Imp Stout fan."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of Brooklynboy...thanks Edward we made it through the maple curtain. Served slightly chilled in a Petrus snifter. Pour was very viscous and oily color was a light defying black...no head...clinging ring on the glass. Aromas of spice/coffee/cocoa/figs sweet in tone. Mouth feel is significant in body...very oily and viscous....complex tastes...dates,licorice, columbian coffee, all with an over riding dollup of boiled hop oils that shadows this with a driving astringency that at times makes the whole mouthful taste salty when the alcohol tastes are added...long finish where these multitude of tastes play out against the alcohol. I can see how this would mature with cellering...a very good attempt at the Imp-stout genre but falls far short because of the salty finish created by the ABV...needs work. Sorry Edward Wellington Imp-stout wins this duel."
"The layer of sediment in the bottom of the bottle is quite impressive. I decanted almost all of the beer, but I'm not sure I would in the future. I don't note any off flavors as a result, but I'm sure it has modified the flavor somewhat. Still, a very, very good brew that should be sought out by anyone who appreciates imperial stouts. Very high quality, as I've come to expect from Rogue."
"Beautiful black,,,good lacing..head dissipated a bit quickly. Smell is deep malt with a hint of pine. Taste is coffee. burnt malt, alcohol combination...very nice. Mouthfeel is a bit dry with a nicely bitter hop presence. For the high abv, not bad on the drinkability scale. A strong, but flavorful brew."
"This fine stout pours a very nice dark color, bordering on pitch black. A minimal head forms. The smell is malty. The taste is complex but delightful, no hint of the high ABV (10.5%) contained within. The mouth feel is pleasing to the palate: nice and full bodied. This is a very enjoyable Stout. Definitely worth searching out and giving a try."
"For the style, this beer is very hard to be beaten (might be trumped by Stone's Russian Imperial IMO). Here's my advice: buy a case of this and cellar it. Truly a priceless beer!"
"This jet black brew is impervious to light. It has a small, dark brown head on the top of it. Big chocolatey scent, with some hop tones, bit of roast, and some syrupy dark fruit scent. The taste hits the tounge and makes it take notice. It has some roast/chocolate malt tones up front, with an interesting combo of citrusy hops. The combo of flavors makes it a interesting and unique brew. Overall pretty tasty."
"DA: I'd have given it a 5 here, but it just too much of a beer for me to think of it as a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is very viscous, not creamy but not thick or watery. Drinkability? hmmm.... one will do me but i'm certainly glad I tried it."
"If there was ever such a thing as a malted port wine, this is it. Excellent."
"Aroma has a hint of raspberry and is mostly chocolate. Flavor is obviously choclately with lots of malt and some hoppy notes. Other flavors I got were raisins, plum, and dried dates. A very tasty stout."
"Beer is good. Happy dark black Imperial Stout beering."
"Very good Rogue offering!"
"Bottled in 2003: Poured thick, rich, and black. Nice deep brown head with orange highlights. Aromas of caramel and malt. The body of this beer was smooth and silky, which gave way to flavors of burnt sugar, coffee, and chocolate. The finish on this beer was long and bittersweet, just like a good espresso. An exceptional beer, just wish it was cheaper..."
"This beer is big, perhaps bigger than a beer ought to be. But what the hell. Id serve it to the Czar. But not the Cossacks."
"Rouge Imperial Stout was served from a 12 oz. silkscreened bottle dated 2001 (3 years aged). This beer poured murky and nearly black. In a pint glass, the stout was night black, and was adorned with a minimal dark brown ring form head that was easily thickened with a swirl of the glass. The swirls left nice brown lacing. The nose emitted a very dark and rich chocolate aroma that was accompanied by strong figgy and woody-earthy accents with a moderate sweetness. On the palate, a rich n roasty chocolate espresso malt profile presented itself softly, then quickly opened up with bold and tasty energetic-sharp woody-earthy bitter flavors that carried on right through to the robustly bittered finish, which left lingering dark bitter chocolate flavors and a rough powerful bitterness in the back of the mouth. No esters were to be found at any point, accentuating the earthy character of this rich stout. The body was medium-thick for the style, and worked quite well for the flavors and character of the beer. The drinkability was somewhat less than other examples of the style, due to lingering rough and somewhat harsh qualities described above. On the other hand, the alcohol was completely integrated into the flavors. Overall though, a pretty good earthy imperial stout that I would buy again."
"By mid bottle as it warms further, this one develops a port like quality to it, and the burnt flavors settle down a little bit allowing the other flavors to shine. Good, but could use some cellaring"
"sits a midnight black with hints of crimson floating around like gohosts in a bad dream. no head, a very thin layer of brown bubbles apeared for a moment then disapeared. you can smell raosted malts, chocolate, slight alcohol smell, alltogether a reminicent smell of brooklyn brown ale with jsut slightly less chocolate notes. far to smooth for 10.5 abv. seems a little mroe watery then expected in my mouth. when it first hits your tounge the flavor isnt as potent as one would expect from the giant nose on this thing. but then you quickly pick up chocolate and nutty flavors. finishes with an alcoholic coffeee taste. somewhat like an irish coffee or a drink like that. a little harsh on the back of the throat, not to acidic like omse of these can get. very low carbonation. i think this is definatley something that should be aged, it allmost seems as if all the flavors aren't melded together, and it generally could use a bit of mellowing out. now i need to buy another to store away for a rainy day."
"Overall: I'm still wondering why I didn't try this beer sooner. I love imperials, I knew rogue had one, so why did I wait? I still don't know. For those of you like me get out there an try this beer."
"On draught at Winking Lizard, served in a snifter (a little too cold). This beer is almost black with a thin tan head and nice lacing. Aroma leans on the roasted coffee side. Big and rich, this Imperial seems to be more on the bitter side than most. It is not rich and sweet like some of my favorites but this is still a keeper. Flavors of coffee, hops and bitter chocolate dominate, but there is an underlying sweet malt and caramel as well. The finish is mostly on the bitter hops side but there was a distinct black licorice flavor as well, althogh more understated than I remember in the bottled version. The alcohol is difficult to detect throughout. This is by no means my favorite Imperial but it is worth getting again."
"The aroma is definitely coffee based, but somewhat sweet. Not a coffee drinker, am I. The taste is powerful with a strong coffee and bitter chocolate flavor. The aftertaste is somewhat alcohol filled and not one to give your grandmother. I have tried other Imperial Stouts and while this is a good one, it doesn't take over some of the others. But real good."
"I haven't had too many 'big' stouts but this one is definitely worth trying. I should say I am drinking a 2003 vintage and this does interest me in grabbing a few more to keep downstairs until this winter to see what it can really do. Definitely worth a try."
"Well worth your time and -- dare I say -- effort, for this brew is a fierce, lumbering beast."
"12oz brown silk screened bottle with bottled date of 2001 poured into a 16oz snifter. Wow this pours like oil and is just as dark. No light is getting through this one and a beautiful tan head is present. This is a picture perfect imperial stout. The aroma is heavy with chocolate and coffee and a slight creaminess to it. Very strong taste consisting of roasted malts, chocolate and a bit of coffee. None of the alcohol is present in the taste at all, just a marvelous flavor. Thick bodied as it gets and the drinkability is damn good. The aging of about 3 years has definatly brought this one close to perfection, I have a few bottled in 2003 I will have to try for comparison. One of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever tasted."
"This is a great offering from Rogue (as always). It would be a great warmer in the winter."
"Intense bittersweet chocolate, hints of vanilla, dark roast coffe. Orange & pine hop flavours cut right through. Licorice flavour opens up eventually. Full bodied. Intense."
"Drinkability - these 7-ouncers are perfect and this one has aged exceedingly well. I'll be heading back to PS to see if they have any more of these."
"This was a full and flavorfull beer. Really smooth and nice."
"I wouldn't want to drink more than one or two at a sitting, being so potent and with such a strong taste, but that one or two will be enjoyed."
"Pours beautifully. Thick molasses and a nice head makes for a stunning appearance in the glass. Smells of chocolate, malt, and coffee dance playfully off your nose. Tastes wonderful. I'm forced to drink slower than I want to. It tastes so good I just want to drink it all in one sitting. Definitely one of the best imperial stouts I've ever drank. It had a hint of sweetness to it that I don't normally go for in imperial stouts but it definitely works for this beer."
"A nice imperial, if this is your style, try this beer"
"Taste: It starts off with a prevalent dark german chocalate flavor that is just in your face. The bitter finish (87.5 IBU) partners with this flavor perfectly. Bitter, yet not a hoppy floral bitter in the least. Despite the 3 hops, and high IBU, the hops do not take over this beer at all. They compliment it in the finish. The bouquet of malts has the real speaking roles. This beer will send your tastebuds in search of the flavors which escape or change just before you can pinpoint it. Pronounced, but undefined. This stout is a real treat, full of flavors. Incredible."
"It pours like motor oil and stands opaque black with a light brown head. Alcohol hits the nose first and then the roasted malts (coffee and chocolate) and quite a bit of hops. The body is smooth and creamy and coats the mouth. There is a big roasted flavor (mocha) and some fruitiness. It is rich and velvety with chocolate and it finishes with a nice dose of hops and alcohol."
"This beer is incredibly silky smooth and boasts a clean, light carbonation. Easy going down, a good winter warmer. Big on the bitters, but great taste and mouthfeel."
"The intensity of the beer mellows substantially as it warms. Best served at 60F(ish). A complex brew with a lot of character."
"Looked for a date on the bottle...2001! Awesome! Well aged! Pours black with a huge brown head. The head is totally awesome! Wonderful dark chocolate aroma with a touch of hops and a little heavy metal. Smooth malty dark chocolate milkshake with a coffee alcohol bite. Thick and filling. Exactly the way a RIS should be. I hope to get some of those higher-rated RIS's from the LEFT coast at some point for comparison sake."
"This beer is anthracite black with a syrupy thickness and a very slight brown head. No light passes through the liquid. The aroma contains sensations of alcohol, coffee, butterscotch (which is very pleasing in this case), caramel, and burnt/roasted barley. This is an extraordinarily bitter beer. From the first taste, the bitterness is evident, and it continually builds as you work through the glass. Full and tick, low carbonation, alcohol in the taste. Its an imperial stout alright."
"I would drink a couple of these if I was feeling adventurous."
"Served from a 12oz bottle, labeled ""Bottled in 2003"". Pours out an inky espresso black, seems fairly thick, no visible head, just wisps of bubbles on top, carbonation is pretty low as well. Aroma is spicy and alcoholic, and dominated with roasty coffee with undertones of dark chocolate. Taste is also spicy on the tongue at first, the alcohol is evident, but it's just warming your tongue up for the rich flavors of dark roasted coffee, roasty toasty malt, and smooth chocolate. Hops come in toward the end, adding a nice bite and finishing bitterness that's matched perfectly with the rest of the complex flavors. Very tasty, an excellent bold dessert beer, this is no wussy impy stout. should age well."
"Heavy and dark this baby pours, like a night in the Black Forest during a new moon. But the stuff smells like a sewer! Did I get a skunked bottle? No, I don't think so. There's is clearly an aroma of dead leaves and charred malts, but yes, that's a subtle sewer in the background. The taste is an improvement: the alcohol content is understated and the malts are sweetly infused in here--chocolates, coffee, cream, and burnt toast. Very interesting. Heavy. Not a session beer!"
"Drinkability: Great. Another fantastic Rogue beer."
"$2.99 for 12oz bottle."
"Interesting note: Rogue, famous for listing all their ingredients on the side of the bottle, perhaps realizes the importance of this brewing achievement. Of 14 ingredients, # 9 and # 10 are listed as ""Two Secret Ingredients"". Nice."
"Great brew!"
"One note on this, 20 oz. might be a bit too much for one sitting with this brew. It is such a potent and heavy brew I think I would enjoy it more in smaller quantities, next time I will remember to get the 12 or 16 oz. glass. If you get a chance to try this brew and like this class of beers do not hesitate try it, you will not be disappointed!"
"Pours a dark, pretty much black liquid with a wonderful dark tan creamy head. This head stayed around for the long haul. Great lacing on the glass throughout as well. The smell is of coffee, and a bit of chocolate. The taste was a wonderful blend of espresso, chocolate, and a bit of fruit. This appears to be well hopped, as it was bitter at the end, but not over the top. It seemed to have a good full mouthfeel, and was fairly drinkable. This is a higher alcohol beer, and the alcohol presence is somewhat notable. I am impressed in the overall taste, and enjoyed this beer tremendously. Another hit from Rogue!"
"12 oz bottle, bottled in2003 etched in bottle. Pours black with minimal head, very fine bubbles and lace. Super Rich and thick, this is strong stuff! Alcohol obvious in nose, taste, mouthfeel and in head (IE: it goes there quickly). Heavy body, use a knife and a fork! Strong roasted malt, expresso coffee, dark chocolate,and molassas, notes. Dry in the mouth, chalky, bitter, hops a blazing. A fine after dinner sipper. Balance and craftsmanship on full display."
"Drinkability is high in general but due to heavy alcohol on the palate one is enough for me."
"One of these is enough for me in a session. I enjoyed it, but I'd switch to something different for a second."
"Thick black motor oil of a brew with hardly any head despite a vigorous pour. What faint froth appeared was dark tan in color. Smell is of fresh ground espresso, baking chocolate, ripe dark fruits and complex hoppiness. Taste is overwhelming bitter with bitter baking chocolate, espresso again, and oily resiny hops all over the place. I thought aging would mellow this thing out...not so. A bit too much hop component for my liking, but I can appreciate what they are going for here. One was plenty."
"Black body with a chocolate head screaming: ""Hey, I'm the lord of the night"". Chocolate head, fully diminishing, but nonetheless leaving an impression at 11%+. Aroma is not so intense, but so bold, greasy, almost closing to bacon with coffee notes and dirty earth hops. Palate is vinous, very rich, very hopped, very chocolatey. Intense, profound, extremely hopped with a sharp bitterness. Full bodied and flavoured with alcohol being more and more noticeable toward the last sips. Evil, warming and just monstruous/intimidating."
"Oh my, a rival to the storm king. this is a really good example of an imperial stout, one that I'd love to be able to brew myself. Pitch colored beer with a this tan head that left good lacing down the glass. The beer smells of alcohool, roasted notes, hops, and chocolate. The taste was right on warming the moth, throat and belly woth chocolate, caramel, deep fruit and aclohol notes. The mouthfeel was cool, coating the teeth and gums, lingering the flavors after each mouthful, allowing the hops to work their magic, drying everything out to make me reach for the next mouthful. This is the best rogue i've had to date and will be enjoying this one again."
"Beef Notes: I'm a little disappointed in this one. I'll have to try it again sometime or maybe I'll age a bottle. Then again, it seems like it's just not the imperial stout for me."
"Drinkability: You know that one cough drop commercial where the nebbishy guy with the cold ends up in a sauna with two large Russian men who are wearing nothing more than a towel, a hat and a smile. One of them says in a deep basso profundo voice, ""HA HA, BREATHE MY LITTLE FRIEND"" and them claps the guy heartily on the back? That commercial.. yeah, well this beer is the liquid equivalent of Mr. Burly. A very satisfying West Coast Imperial Stout. Not one I'd throw in front of a beginner (not that I'm some friggin' master here), but definitely very well made."
"Syrupy, and full-bodied."
"The smell is funky then sweet. The taste is very complex moving from chocolate to esspresso and then sparkling on my tongue (without the carbonation) The hops appear sporadically; weaving in and out like a base in a good jazz quartet. This is the second time I've tasted this vintage. The last time was about a year ago and it wasn't anywhere near as good as it is now. I will now always wait for this one to develop. The mouthfeel is thick but not cloying due to the complexity of the flavors. I'll drink this as long as I can differentiate the details. It would also be fun to do a quartet tasting of Bell's Expediton, Victory Storm King, Stone Imperial, and this one. What are friends for?"
"ng"
"The thick dark concoction pours into the glass like death sneaking up on its next victem. Slow and silent. It climaxes with a thick frothy brown head that looks as if it were truely meant for an emporor, not for the likes of me. The smell is of fruits and roasted malts. Though I know I'm not worthy of such a beer, I taste it anyway. The roasted malts were the first thing that I tasted. They were strong with a smokey feel to them. There was also a bitterness that I knew to be dark chocolate. I also got a nice dose of fruits. What ones, I couldn't pinpoint. Good stuff."
"i was shocked that i fidn't enjoy this one more than i did. imperial stouts have been all over the place for me, lately. some are fantastiv, others are okay. being from rogue, this brew is a class act and finely made, just not completely my taste. first off, this is from a tasting of the 2002 version. it pours quite lovely, black as hell with a thim, dark tan head. nice, but not as impressive as i had imagined. the smell is predominantly of alcohol, malt, licorice and other sweetness. there are traces aof oat and coffee here as well. the faintness of the coffee smell appealed to me, but it was just too overpowering in the taste. the bitterness here was nice along with the hoppy but tart finish, but i just couldn't get past the abundance of coffee here. again, well made, not for me, though i can definitely say i'd try one again in the future...likes and dislikes always change, at least for me."
"I know I wouldn't be able to drink this one all night, but it does warm the belly. Excellent for a cold winter's night like tonight."
"The drinkability is only hampered by the apparent alcohol, this is a sippin beer."
"A very nice drink for a cold January night in Minnesota."
"1997 vintage. Not a real looker going into the snifter. No head whatsoever, just a viscous thin dusting of bubbles; there is a slight liqueurish ""cling"" to the liquid. Almost totally black, with purplish highlights. Aroma is a bit better. A melding of dry sweetnesses: prunes, port wine, currants, and a brace of alcohol; a hint of cakey yeast. Dense. Flavors (in order of appearance): strong coffee grounds, dried fruit (prune, raisin), dark chocolate. Weaving through all these roasty, toasty flavors is the sweetness of port. Alcoholic yeast licks at the roof of the mouth. Oak tones emerge by the time the beer gets to room temperature. Mouthfeel is winey and mellow, extremely light for the style. Balance, balance, balance. Drinkability brings with it a nice alcohol warmth. The bottle reads ""best when consumed after 1 year."" This being the first and only bottle I've ever had, I wouldn't know if it was past its prime. I'd imagine that younger bottles might fare better in some departments, but six years on the shelf did things to the flavors that I found nothing short of extraordinary."
"This a lotta beer! There's nothing mild or subtle...it's an in-your-face stout that makes you sit up and take notice. You experience it as much as drink it. The high ABV is not at all shy in making itself known, but the big-league, high octane flavor tempts you to have more, despite that alcohol. And yes, I'll brave that demon to have myself more."
"Pours with a decent head that shows dense carbonation and a velvety milk-chocolate color. The body is pitch black. The aromas are very heavy on the roasted notes, leaning toward burnt, with a touch of alcohol sweetness. The first sip reveals an almost burining, smoky bitterness from the heavily roasted malts. A touch of sweet smokiness makes you think your eating a severly burnt marshmallow from the campfire. The charred flavors continue to dominate even as the beer approaches room temp. Some more balancing sweetness appears, and actually helps reveal the hop flavors a little better. Mouthfeel is solid, but with a rather dry finish. Burnt flavors linger uncomfortably. Drinkability is acceptable, but there seems to be a bit too much black malt in this one. Give me a little more chocolate/roasted flavor without the acrid bitterness, and this would be outstanding. As it is, it's a one-timer."
"Poured a pitch black with almost no head, just a charred tan ring that didn't even consist of bubbles. Smell was strongly reminiscent of worcestire, meat, damp dog and thick malts, all of which were infused with a off smelling hop juice. Taste was bitter grains, raw chocolate sans any type of sweetening and tons of brutal over the top Rogue hops.I am a minimalist when it comes to carbonation, but this was overdoing it as there was no carbonation whatsoever. The beer was completely muddied by the fact that the hops and the malts did not acompany each other in the slightest. I will certainly not pay Rogue XS prices for this again. Stick to the I2PA."
"The nose shouts out, and supplies ample substance of roasted barley malts and subtle whiffs of the balancing hops. Bitter flavors cover all but the alcohol level, which keeps the taste quite dry. The taste also has an earthy, ash-like quality to it that is more pleasant than it sounds. Full mouthfeel is joined by a pleasant and lingering aftertaste. This is not lightweight stout, but rather a heavyweight slugging its way into the battle with full roasted delights and heavy-handed body punches."
"Overall just a great imperial stout. It gets a little more bitter and metallic, but still, a very tasty stout."
"2001 edition. Pours a thick black with an equally impressive brown head. Aroma is heavily vinous with a hint of cherry and alcoholic vapors. Almost reminds me of drunken chocolate covered cherries. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a sharp carbonation. Initial flavors consist of dark fruits and bitter chocolate. Hops swarm in quickly to balance the malt flavors and take center stage midway through. Finishes with cherry and a smokey lingering dryness. Highly alcoholic, which detracts a bit from the overall drinkability. Wonder if it's past its approximate ""3 year prime", which others may have referred to? To me this beer seems to have peaked. Why this happened, I'm not quite sure for a beer of this abv. A powerful Imperial Stout which can provide quite a KO punch for the unprepared."
"This is a ridiculously good beer! Compared with other Imp. Stouts I've tried this seems noticeably more bitter, but that plays into a lingering, memorable finish... I'll get to that later. Motor oil black and opaque, like you're way beyond your 3,000 mile oil and filter change. A dense light brown head reduces to a cap but leaves sticky remnants down the sides of the glass. Decadently rich aroma....dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, a rich full city roast coffee, and sweet, sweet malt, but with a slightly citric note that makes it all seem, for lack of a better word, fresh. Bitter chocolate, caramel, espresso, and a slight smokiness are elegantly intertwined in the flavor. More bitterness in the form of citric hops and roasted barley come on strong in the finish and the smokiness develops a bit more as well, lending a somewhat dark, earthy tone reminiscent of a fine maduro cigar. Outstanding!! The alcohol presence is felt but does not interfere with the flavor."
"This one poured a tar black color and was very thick in body. For some reason this lacked a head when poured into the glass and had little carbonation. That might have hurt the beer but it was still very imperial in smell and taste. The alcohol was noticed and the body was very chewy. This one was extremely balanced, maybe a little too balanced for my liking. Bittersweet malts up front followed by a molasses flavor sweetness. The hops come in a play a prevalent part in this beer. It finishes roasty. Well done, I only wish that it would've been more carbonated."
"Of the four Imperials in front of me, I slide the Rogue to second place- behind the A.Le Coq. Not only did the A.Le Coq have a fruitier nose, but it also produced a far more complex flavor and a thicker heavier mouthfeel and flavor body."
"Good rich, viscous, creamy mouthfeel and carbonation. Excellent drinkability for a 10.5% beer. Top notch drop, give it a try."
"This is without question the finest stout I've ever had. I'm sure that even a bottled version of this brew would please almost any beer lover. A must-drink."
" I have searched far too long to find this beer, and it looks like I will have to search again. This is my favorite Rogue to date, and that says a lot, since they are an incredible brewery."
"Drinkability - Try one and you will most assuredly try another. An excellent all-around stout. Watch the high ABV."
"Pours with no head, only a small lace that quickly dissipates leaving a few bubbles. Solid black in color. Loads of aroma hits you in the face. Sweet aroma is of alcohol, spicy vinous notes, dark fruit, and a slight bit of chocolate. Despite the lace of any head, carbonation is definitely present towards the end. The start has some slightly sweet molasses notes up front. Chocolate is noticeable towards the middle, but only in very small amounts. Somewhere in the middle, there is also a slight burst of vinous notes. Big harsh heavily roasted coffee and hops notes finish and last into the aftertaste which lingers for a long time. Id like to age this one for a while and see how it mellows. At this point its a bit too harsh for my palate, and I couldnt drink more then one. However, it does become more enjoyable as it warms, growing a bit sweeter and less harsh."
"notes: truly a well crafted an immensely satisfying beer to drink. Vintage 2002, just a baby, gotta get more of these to hold onto. This is my 50th review, and I dedicate it to all the BAs I've met and all those I'll meet before my 100th review.. Hell yeah."
"A deep dark brown head tops this beer, the head is very dense and creamy. A pitch black beer. The aroma is of condensed malt, alcohol, and a light roasted smell. The roast aroma is not as strong as I was expecting it to be. This is a very thick bodied brew. It ends in a burnt coffee note. There is a definite sweetness but it is countered by the roast character so that the sweetness is in no way cloying. It has a thick oily feel on my tongue. A fairly mellow beer, for sure a deep contemplative brew for sipping and enjoying slowly. Overall this is a very refined Imperial Stout that is not too over the top."
"Mmmm...a delicious imperial stout. Nice bitterness that's complimented by a chocolate sweetness. Hopefully, I'll have this one again."
"Seriously though, what an incredible concoction.I first had this on Halloween 2002 and don't remember much after that. What I do remember is the milkshake lacing around the glass and the way the aroma and flavor intensify as the brew warms toward room temp.Drinking this cold spoils the experience.Take your time and appreciate this beer and it won't let you down."
"Drinkability: This IS Imperial Stout! Only Rogue Shakespeare Stout rates higher (for me) because I could drink more of it in a sitting. The Rogue boys know their stouts."
"Rogue Imperial Stout pours black as night with dark tan head with great retention. It smells of bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee/espresso beans. The taste is creamy yet bitter from the hops and roasted malts and the chocolate is very prevalent and masks the alcohol well. A truely intense brew, Rogue's Imperial Stout is not for the faint of heart."
"Not sure if i need a spoon for this one. Pours thick as anything I have ever seen. The thick head just doesn't want to away. Lots of burnt malt on the tongue. After that fades a slight sweet chocolate flavor hits for half a second. It then returns back a dry toasty finish. 10.5, what?"
"Thanks to MJR for the bottle."
"Overall Impression: Forgive me, oh rebellious brothers and sisters, this is a Rogue that needs to be brought to justice. I’ve loved just about every other Rogue I’ve tried, and Imperial Stout is one of my favorite beer styles, but this was just too harsh. A real disappointment. Maybe my bottle was bad (I fear not) or maybe this just needed a decade or so to age (it did have a good year) but something just wasn’t right. My only suggestion for possible improvement would be to back off the hops (sacrilege) and find some way to mellow this fellow. Unless I hear of major changes, I won’t be revisiting this any time soon."
"The first Rogue beer that I can say I truly and deeply loved. A bit too rich and sour (what a mix!) to give it more than a ""good"" rating for drinkability (but at the price -- about $3.50 per bottle -- how many can you have, anyway?)."
"Poured a small tan head. The color is pitch black. The smell is of burnt malt and hops. This one was bottled in 2002, I definitely think it could sit around for a couple more years. The taste is like strong coffee, with a hoppy bitterness rising up towards the end. This is a very tasty brew, but just a bit much."
"As with their other brews, this Rogue is a world-class beer. I recommend it highly."
"Thickest...Beer...Ever. Aroma is just a little bit of heaven. Strong ass 2 week old coffee, chocolate, and a nice malt backbone. As for the taste, I'm a little at odds, It's good, there's no denying that, it's just unbalanced. Incredibly bitter with the malty chocolate playing second fiddle. Aftertaste is like a campfire that won't go out. Very strong and unpleasant. I do enjoy my Imp. Stouts hoppy, but balance is so crucial, and seems to be overlooked here. The alcohol however, is brilliantly hidden. Silky smooth in the mouth with just the right amount of carb. to keep things interesting. Drinkability is pretty good I guess. Not one I'll buy again. Drink their Shakespeare Stout instead."
"This is a review of a vintage / over the hill beer. I ask the beer gods forgiveness for dragging down the average score of what must have once been a god among beers."
"Looks really promising, menacing deep brown to black colour. Smell of chocolate, vanilla and then grapefruity piney hops, the hops take over in the aroma, and then again on the palate. I don't think the combo of chocolate, roast and vanilla, go too well with the huge grapfruity, piney, citric hops that Rogue uses in this beer. Still very tasty and thick, and bitter in the finish aswell. Not totally ""all that", maybe i'm just being picky. Still, pretty f'n tasty (bottle GBBF 03')"
"...and it can stain mine any time!"
"This is my first beer that I sampled that I can truly say pours like used motor oil, thin light brown head leaves some lacing. This one was bottled in 2002 and in the aroma I can pick out doughy chocolate tones, coffee deep espresso to be exact, anise and cascade hops seem to dominate in that department. There are alot of flavors going on in this beer very complex deeply woven with in an initial deep chocolate wave followed by a slew of hop bitterness the IBUs are kicking here with trickles of the doughiness and anise and hidden and blended overripened fruit tones soaked in a coffee bean roast. There is just an orgy of flavor and aroma in this brew the mouthfeel is incredibly full the beer itself is filling warming at the same time. Drinkability despite being as thick and full bodied as this it has a pretty easy sipping complex about it, not the everyday sipper but one to try and challenge the senses very good and very complex some may not be ready for this one."
"rating 4.55"
"This is in the top three of my favorite stouts. Black color and tawny full head with a nice aroma that is slightly chocolatey. I think what distinguished this Imperial is the full mouth and finish and you are not overpowered by the alcohol, although it's in there. 9.5 out of 10 in my database."
"Notes: Very good stout. Bitterness lasts across the whole tongue. Bitter chocolate fans should enjoy. Homemade rasperry ice cream has met it's ideal beer."
"Currently available to me only as a 12oz, here's hoping a bomber of this finds its way out of the brewery and into my stocking this Christmas. Santa, are you listening?"
"Pours out jet black with a small firm head. Smell is roasted coffee with a hop overtone. Taste is enveloping, chocolate on the very nose, roasted espresso and hint of sweetness in the back with the trademark Rogue hop bite at the end, although the hops were surprisingly (and nicely for me) restrained. Overall an incredibly tasty, well balanced Imperial Stout."
"Pours black with a brown head that diminishes quickly to a ring. The aroma is roasty, and coffee-like. It also has a earthy, almost oakiness to the aroma. The flavor is of deep roasted malts, with expresso-like qualities. It flows to a burnt roasty bitter finish. The bitterness lingers with you until the next sip. The mouthfeel is creamy from the rolled oats and it flows to a bitter finish. A very full-bodied brew. A nice warming, tasty beer."
"26 degrees Plato, IBU 87.5, Apparent Attenuation 77, Lovibond 258."
"A rich, thick black pour with a smallish brown head. The aromas slipping out are coffee,roasted malt, charcoal, and smoke. The rich, full body contain heavanly flavors of espresso and chocolate, plent of fresh roast flavors intermingled with a solid bitterness built on the roast and hops. It's texture is oily thick but still very drinkable with a bitter/dry finish that keeps the glass close at hand."
"On tap, it poured black with no head. The smell of hops and roasted malts along with a hint of coffee filled the nose. The taste of roasted malts along with the coffee and hops with a hint of chocolate was very tasteful. But, OH SO BITTER. I've never tasted a stout so bitter, but so tasteful!"
"Rogue sure can brew a nice stout!! I like imperials, so I knew that I would like this one, but I think I liked it even more than I thought I would. As with most stouts, this one is black; however, this one is as black as they come! Also had a nice tan head, particularly for an imperial. Smell is very distinct... roasty, coffee, and a slight chocolate...alcohol warms the nose somewhat (I like that!) Taste is very strong, bitter, malty, and a little chocolate. Alcohol is definately noticeable and warms the throat. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, but not like their other stouts (for me anyway). Drinkability rated a little low for me due to the high alcohol and bitterness. Alcohol lingers on in your mouth after the strong finish. This brew is a very nice overall combination of high alcohol and good taste.....something I like in an imperial. I'm somewhat surprised it doesn't rate a little higher overall...."
"Jet black in color with a very slight very dark head,the aroma is sweet like molassis and a little nutty.The taste is very earthy and coffeish with a sweet backbone,the alchol is also prevalent in the finish.This is a mans beer for sure one will do me just fine."
"Well, I didn't steer clear of this beer. I just had to try it again. And I must say that for the last couple of months, I always pick a bottle up when I make a run to the store. I'm not sure what happened on that first sampling, but I really enjoy this brew now. Probably not quite as much as everyone else does, but it definitely did not deserve the 2.75 that I gave it the first time around."
"Gave this a 5 for appearance. The darkest head I have seen on a beer. This beer is so dark you can't see any light through the stream as you pour it!! Head disappates quickly but leaves nice lace. Nose is pretty strong. About the same as it tastes. Taste is strong coffee, malt, a hair sweet. Not quite as strong tasting as a couple other stouts I have had. The alchohol is a little noticable. Very clean tasting and well done. Top quality stout. I want to try the Chocolate one now. I already know the Shakespeare is good."
"Dark black opeque look. Thick milk chocolate one inch dense head. Wonderful sticky mustache-on-the-lip style lace. Fresh grassy hop and sweet malt nose. Dense thick rich mouth. Upfront bitterness is mellowed by a rich dense sweet roasty malt base. It also has a big bitter expresso finish. The tongue is left dry with a hint of bitter dark chocolate. Complex, rich, and bold. Rogue to the core.."
"Man is this a bitter Imperial. Black like used motor oil and nearly as thick. Active carbonation upon openeing the bottle and a thick dark head formed. Lacing is good. Kind of a bitter roasty aroma but nothing really comes to mind. A bit of coffee and hops. Alcohol is noticable. Super smooth palate and a nice warming bitter finish. Flavor is roasted malts, hops, alcohol and cocoa. A little more bitter than I like in this style."
"This brew pours a small brown head of finely sized bubbles with a pitch black opaque body. As one drinks from their mug, the lasting head leaves behind a wonderful clinging vine lacing. It has a typical stout strong coffee aroma with a very smooth, for a stout, initial taste and a strong coffee finish. I really enjoyed drinking this brew. One of the better stouts I have tasted."
"Overall Impression: I know it's probably blasphemous, but I'm not a huge fan of Rogue's beers. I've tried 9 or 10 of them and they were all pretty aggressively bitter, even their American Amber was assertive. Finely crafted beers and a brewery that deserves a lot of respect, but I find the high hop rate a bit boring. It's pretty easy to throw a ton of hops in a beer. I must admit, I'm not much of a hop-head, so take my Rogue reviews with a grain of salt. If there's a Rogue ale that is balanced, I'd like to try it."
"I guess that I have to compare this to Storm King which is one of my favorite Imp Stouts. The Storm King seemed to have more hops. I want to try the Rogue in a bottle and compare."
"This is simply a beautiful imerial stout."
"Feel is full, firm, bold, creamy, and above all, quite easy and mellowing with a nice bittering bite near the finish and a great lingering hold and one hell of a warming quality. The warming is the only thing that keeps this from being completely drinkable, its a sipper for sure, and a good one at that. One hell of a excellent Imp. stout. Top notch all the way."
"The smell is slightly alcoholic, slightly malty, and even a tiny hint of hops. The taste is big. It slips onto the palate smoothly, but there is enough flavor that you may need to swallow twice. Like the smell, there is a slight alcoholic taste though the immense coffee/chocolate taste all blend to create a surprisingly smooth drink. This is only served by the glass, and that's plenty."
"2002 Edition. This beer poured a very dark color with a small head that settled toward the center of the glass. The aroma was very strong and sweet - chocolate malts, coffee, and alcohol. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. Some alcohol and a hint of chocolate and coffee on top of the malts. Very thick body. This is a good beer, but I don't think I could have more than one in a setting."
"Slick & thick full body with carbonation that checked out long ago on this bottle. An excellent Imperial to serve with desert or as a desert in itself."
"BLACK POWER, indeed!"
"Thick and black opaque pour, better ""head"" than I hoped for -- but that's just a skim of dark red. Straight string laces. Sweet licorice and berry aromas, a sense of lurking java oiliness. Huge mouthfeel, plenty of chocolate and espresso but with that licorice anise coming back very strongly on the tails of a considerable hop assertion. Finishes coffee-malty overall, but the aftertaste gradually establishes an enormous bitterness, almost ash-like. Meets qualifications for the style (great body and plenty of alcohol) but here's why its not at the top of my list -- not the fruitiness of Storm King nor the malty deliciousness of a Samuel Smith. Shakespeare still reigns as Rogue's finest ""Stout", to me..."
"Overall, a good imperial stout, but I personally prefer North Coast Old Rasputin and Victory Storm King over the Rogue. They're not as heavy on the molasses as this one. I picked up my first Stone Imperial Stout today so it will be quite interesting to see how it compares to the above mentioned 3."
"This is the best Imperial Stout I've had and for now the best beer I've ever had. I've tried Bell's Expedition Stout, Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, Arcadia's Imperial Stout, Victory's Storm King, Samuel Smith's Imperial and Avery's ""The Czar"". My explanation of this stuff may not be as eloquent as a some of you other seasoned beer pros out there but to me it's just plain smooth. Samuel Smith might be smoother but it has too much other fruity stuff going on it which makes it a little confusing as to what it really is. The Rogue has a simple and not overly complicated taste. The alcohol taste jumped out at me with Arcadia and Storm king but not with Rogue. There is some kind of ""edge"" to it which I can't explain too well but I like it . Of course it is super thick -- almost liquor like. It pours with a head as good as any of the other Imperial's I've tried. I also liked the bottle design (12 oz.) . It gave the ingredients -- 14 of them ! How many beers do you know of that are made with ""Free Range Coastal Water"" ?? Maybe that is the secret to it's smoothness. Bottled in 2002."
"It pours very thick and black with a nice tan head. Molassas and coffe are presant in the aroma. The taste is of molassas and some chocolate with the finish of cascade hops. This was bottled in 2001 so it is about 2 years old. I'd say it aged very well. It's an imperial stout that I'm surprised isn't talked about a bit more. This should be considered on the same level as stone imperial stout and storm king."
"2001 vintage: pours pitch black with an awesomely dense dark brown foaming head. cool cascading effect i rarely see from bottled (non-nitro) beers. nose is full of dark roasty burnt fruit imperial aromas. mouthfeel is ultra smooth, dark, and creamy. the roasted burnt fruit flavors battle with a significant hop presence to create undescribeably complex yet completely well integrated taste. the finish lasts forever. this brew is at the top of the imperial heap for me. the sheer massiveness of this brew knocks it down a notch in it's drinkability, but hell, this is definitely some sippin' tea."
"Tasted: 04/19/03"
"As dark as they get, head huge, chocolate brown, frothy in texture, lace is thick and clinging to the glass like a baby to its mothers breast. Nose is big on the toasted grains, sweet milk chocolate, fresh and hints of strong coffee also noticed, start sweet, thick and the top full in its feel to the palate. Finish biting in its acidity, hops spiteful in their bite, quite dry and a bit alcohol bitter, a real treat for lovers of over the top beers, the rest should drink only after consulting a doctor."
"Bottled in 2001."
"I would still like to sample this from a bottle."
"The best looking of the big 5 american Imperial Stouts (that are highly rated on this site), but the hops overpower, besides tasting bad, what seems to be a great malt structure. Damn shame."
"2002 12 oz bottling: This beer poured as black as oil and similar consistency. If formed a hug dark brown foamy head that looked like a float and coated the sides of the glass with laticed lace while it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, chocolate and plums. A flavor of malt, chocolate, coffee and raisins. A slightly burnt chocolate finish to it with a warming feel of the alcohol present. A fine imperial to add to my cellar(okay, closet)."
"Drinkability: One of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. It took quite a long time to drink this, mostly because I wanted it to last forever. Alcohol makes itself just slightly known near the end, but is not over-powering. The chocolaty-smooth aftertaste is perfect. Yet another beer to keep one of in the fridge, just to see how long I can go before tasting it again. Please do yourself a favor and try this incredible beer."
"Difficult to drink en masse. Certainly not a beer to serve at your next kegger. *grin*"
"Easily the best stout I have had and possibly the best beer I have had to date."
"#2 [ STATS:>> SERVING: 12 oz. bottle / ABV: unlisted / PRICE: $3.39 USD ]"
"This was an incredible deep black color, as black as black top just being put down on a driveway. This had a thick creamy dark brown head, never seen anything like that before. Taste of dark chocolate and double espresso just popped out. Smell was of roasted malt and coffee were signaficantly strong. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy. Just an overall great tasting beer."
"Could never drink more than one 12oz bottle of this, but I bet I pull two of these nippers!"
"This beer came to me a black as black can be color, if any light tried to get through, the beer just ate it up like a black hole in space. The head never ended, it was thick, rich, full and medium to dark brown in color. The lace that it left behind was not lace but a bed sheet draped over the side of the glass and was very sticky and dried fast to the inside. It would take a hammer, a chisel, hot water and an hour for one to get this beer off the sides of the glass. The aromas that came off of this were roasted malts, sweet dark berry fruit, espresso, cocoa, and light hops. The tastes were more prevalent then the aroma. I tasted dark fruits, big malts (roasted), chocolate, floral hops, creamy espresso, brown sugar, black coffee, and some alcohol. It left me with a slight hoppy aftertaste but nice. This is a big, full, thick creamy rich beer. One of those that left you with a memory of it that if someone asked what it was like you could just spit out the info like you just drank it."
"While not quite as impressive as Stone's Imperial Stout (well, that's not a very fair comparison), Rogue has definitely created a masterpiece of an ale."
"Here's my edit after finishing - Definite hickory, bacon-ish flavors for the back half of this brew, my favorite - changing taste from 4.5 to 5.0"
"2001 edition. So black in color that nothing came thru when i held next to the light. Aromas of toffee and roasted malt seemed a little to sweet. Chocolate and coffee flavors are dry and overall unimpressive. I can think of many other 12oz. brews i would rather spend two dollars on. I'm kind of suprised of the high ranking of this beer."
"Notes: Yes this brew seems like it is peaking in its 3rd year ... a god like brew, this stout is only for those who are worthy of drinking the best. The weak will surely perish upon the mere touch of this brew to their lips. As close to perfection as you can get."
"My mouth was coated upon taking my first sip of this, and that way it would remain. Nicely complex in flavor...very bitter roasted malts give way to dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, finishing with a generous portion of hops. This is right there with the best Imperial Stouts, but does not quite stand up to Storm King."
"Not the best Imperial Ale, but then again, I'm sure it's not the worst. I just thought I would try it, because Rogue constantly pumps out good solid brews. Although the look was spectacular, the taste wasn't the same. I might be crazy and you might think that I have no taste, but I really didn't like it too much. It was a little too bitter for me. Sure, I like a bitter beer everynow and then, but this was just a little too bitter. It also had a heavy smell of alcohol. The mouthfeel was good though. It left a good coating of ""Imperialism"" in my mouth, long after it was down the hatch. Not my fav, so I think I would rather have a Storm King or a Stone Imperial."
"F."
"Ultimately, the feel is full, rich, lush, plentiful, rewarding, utterly delicious, and perfect. It's the real deal."
"2001-Rogue Imperial Stout pours a dark black color with a wispy & creamy cardboard colored head that lasts till the very end. On the nose the aromas the aroma of chocolate, black malts, oats, and caramelized fruits. On the palate the flavors of rich dark chocolate erupt, oats, roasted grains, burnt toast, and bittersweet hop flavors. On the tongue, mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and smooth. In the end a huge roasty, sweet, and alcohol kick in the finish. A monster of a brew."
"460"
"Wow, what a wonderful Stout. Pours a jet black with a big, fluffy dark brown head that just won't quit. Stays all the way down, with excellent lacing. Big first aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. The first sip confirms those aromas, as well as something I can't put my finger on. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, nice carbonation, and a great chocolate, coffee aftertaste that finishes with just the right amount of hops. Crisp, clean, excellent finish. Another winner from Rogue. Had two within the 1/2 hour."
"(as has often been the case for me, I've come to appreciate this more as my palate has adjusted. Not the best I've had for the style, but an excellent brew nonetheless)."
"Awesome, awesome beer. Black as hell, with a beautiful brown, cafe au lait-colored head. Gorgeous. Intoxicating aromas of chocolate, caramelized plums, currants. The smell alone can induce a buzz. Taste is a combination of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits (again, currants), and burnt toast. And oh yeah, there's alcohol in there. And its taste seems to be intensified by a hop bitterness that pushes oh-so-close to the edge of being out of whack. Thankfully there's enough lingering sweetness and toasted maltiness to balance the taste in the finish. Nice!"
"Jet black and opaque. Dark brown, thin, but persistent head leaves sparse lace. Citrusy hop nose w/ hints of pine combined with chocolate, deeply roasted black patent and dark, slightly raisiny caramel malt. Mild butterscotch emerges as the beer breathes. Assertive hop bitterness hits the palate, and remains dominant to the malt profile. Chocolate malt melds with residual sugars to lend a briefly sweet, milk chocolate impression which is immediately offset by both sharp, slightly smokey black patent and the lingering hop bitterness. Overshadowed undertone of carob and buttery oak. Piney Chinook hop flavor remains strong, and couples with malt sweetness to lend a subtle, sweet spruce like note mid palate. Moderate in body, with a firm mouthfeel that is not quite as viscous as other imperials. Finishes bittersweet, with lingering roasted grain and hop bitterness. This is the 2001 release. Delicious in its current state, but further cellaring may tame the hop bitterness and allow more malt character to provide contrast. Easily the most bitter stout around. Akin to Willy Shakes on crack."
"One of the best Imperial Stouts out there. One of the best beers out there...period."
"Cheers to Billy Stout for the sample! My god man, you could sell this stuff on a street corner."
"Wow. This beer pours like used motor oil, completely opaque, with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen -- dark brown, a good half-finger thick, and creamy in consistency. Just looking at it you know it's going to leave a good lace. The aroma is intoxicating in itself, chocolatey and alcoholic, with hints of black cherries. Things only get better in the mouth. Creamy and mousse-like in flavor and texture, this beer is dominated by deep malts, while the alcohol lends a nice spiciness mid-palate to compliment its dark fruit and chocolate notes. A very strong hop bitterness (87 IBUs!) gives a nice finish to the drink, and keeps it well in balance. Aftertaste is sweet and with a taste of burnt malts and currants. More full bodied than a pregnant Rosie O'Donnell. Good God this is good."
"Another solid Rogue Brew. This beer is basically black and the head is thick and the color of a normal stout. The smell is coffee and cocoa. The Taste has those same characters, but there is something with a hint of fruit although I cannot place the flavor. Good mouthfeel and drinkable for an Imperial Stout. I also love these Rogue bottles."
"After sitting out for a day: A smoother taste. Obviously less carbonation. Less bitter. A bit more mellowed in flavors. A bit more warming and more coating on the tongue. Tastes a bit more like a quality bitter chocolate. A creamier and smoother taste than yesterday."
"1997 7oz. bottle, Dark black color,, thick full body, not much of a head. Sweet fruity-bready aroma. Taste like black licorice and raisins. Smooth, no bitterness in the finish, may be a bit past its prime or bad storage."
"As you can see, my only peoplem was with the alcohol. I don't even think that it was that high, just not very well masked IMO."
"Ding ding, the first round of two heavy weigth flavors in a super heavy weight Stout. This one is like a a good ass-woopin in a bottle. It looked exceptional in the glass and I don't believe i have ever seen such a dark color head in my life. Then the first sip- like playing you radio at a hearty volume with the treble and the bass both turned up to max. The battle was on between the full ainse, toasted espresso malt side and the Hops, hops, hops on the other. Big flavors in both corners and chewy from begining to end with mouth feel. In the end the hop's win and for me a oatmeal and sweet stout fan to much hops on the finish. But all in all for this style of beer one serious beer and a good one. Maybee I am not man enough and when I take off my training wheels I will be able to really enjoy this one with out a pre pouring pep talk from a highschool football coach [actually I was on the swim team and there are no really manly pep talks to a bunch of guy's standing around in speedos, footbal made for better imagry.]"
"Imperial Stout Blind Tasting notes (11-16-02): Super black opaque, darkest so far. The aroma is mild, burnt. Flavor is dry, thin burnt bitterness, not a lot of other malty flavors. Good but a little one dimensional."
"I've been looking forward to this one for a while.  Well, this is one dark, dark brew.  An x-ray would have trouble getting through this one.  Big brown head on top that leaves good lace, but settles slowly to thin.  When i first cracked this, some citrus hop aroma escaped from the bottle, but with the whole thing poured and right at my nose, that aroma is more suppressed and mingles alongside the big malt character.  Chocolate to be exact, maybe a little caramel as well.  Fruity also, besides the slight citrus.  A bit wood-like too.  Even a tiny bit peaty and smoky.  Very complex aroma, and unique for an imperial stout.  On the palate, a great combination of flavors appears, as complex as the aroma.  Roasted malt grain, dark chocolate, caramel, and bitter hop oil are noticeable first.  Peat and smoke are more noticeable than in the aroma, they add a great character, and come out especially well with retro-olfaction.  Sweet fruit hits near the middle, but then leaves.  Big alcohol warming.  Huge body!  Chewy and thick.  It can't decide whether to be smooth or aggressive in the mouthfeel department, which certainly isn't a bad thing.  Very hoppy finish that holds up even to the last taste bud.  A strong contender for the title in the imperial stout category with its great complexity in aroma and flavor, and its massive full body.  This is without a doubt one to put back for a while, I'm having a 2001 right now, imagine how much more complexity it would gain with even more aging!  Cheers to Rogue once again!"
"This stout pours an intense, defining black with a creamy brown head that subsides quickly. Leaves giant rings of lace all the way down the glass. Nose is diverse with notes of roasted malt, chocolate, a generous dose of hops and coffee. Taste is quite appealing. Roasted chocolate malt, lots of Pacific Northwest hops (thank you), coffee, a hint of cherries and warming alcohol are all present in this mammoth stout. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but still rather smooth considering its age. This is one fine imperial stout that can stand to age some more, but regardless, it's a step ahead of the pack as it stands today."
"Rogue Imperial Stout 1996: In a tiny 7-ounce bottle.  Beer is thick and black.  The blurb on the back says it’s made with free-range coastal water and “two secret ingredients.”  Absolutely flat, no head whatsoever, but there are bubbles floating slowly toward the top.  Aroma is very pleasant: strong scents of coffee, mixed with sweet/dried fruits, and burgundy/wine. Astonishingly thick body. Incredible tastes, it starts out very sweet, but then follows up hops, and lasts forever as it coats the tongue.  Little alcohol taste, but very nice warmth.  Think dark chocolate, strong coffee, Cabernet/port, and molasses.  Truly wonderful, well-balanced, complex.  Well worth the extra trip tonight.  I take back the “tiny bottle.”  This is the biggest 7-ounces of beer I’ve ever had, and I’ll be drinking it all night."
"2001: Whew!  Pours a thick dark dirty oil black with a modest brown head.  Absolutely beautiful!  Nice but mellow aromas of burnt chocolate and roasted malt had my mouth watering so much, I was slobbering (well almost).  The taste is a nice balance of bold hops and burnt chocolate and strong warming alcohol on the tail.  The very thick malty and fluffy mouthfeel is definitely the heaviest that I've ever experienced and goes well with the flavor.  This is one bold brew!  More proof that the good ole USA has some awesome native brews.  Cheers!"
"Sticky, toung-lashing bitterness with a monster grip forces flavors of dried fig, cigar, hazelnut and bitter chocolate (i.e. Valrhona 70% ""Guanaja""). This is a big, big beer. Not for the timid. Primordial, bowels-of-the-earth type energy is packed in to this now larger, 12 oz. bottle."
"2001: This pours so black that it actually starts to swallow up the light from around it and dims the room, it also has a nicethick creamy brown head that sticks to the glass all the way down.  Big burnt malt, bitter hops, oats and alcohol smell to this one.  This beer greets your tongue with some huge malty and burnt flavors before the hops slap you in the face to wake you up.  There is a load of piney hoppiness in this one that gets overpowered as the brew goes on by some of the amazing roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors that are produced by the malt along with an incredibly smooth character that is imparted by the oats.  The brew finishes with a nice lingering roasted/slightly burnt flavor on the tongue with some faint traces of alcohol..  Grab your fork and knife as you are going to need it, this is definitely an amazingly chewy beer with a huge body to it that is nice and creamy as it rolls across the tongue.  For a beer of such complexity and thickness this one is still rather drinkable and I would suggest that all try it."
"2000: 9/10/02- 7 oz. XS bottle. Looks like oil as it pours. BLACK. No head, just a very limited collar. The aroma is initially of grassy, resiny, pine-like hops and dark fruit with chocolatey and roasty malts. As it warms, however, the hop aroma is eclipsed by the fruitiness and roast character. The mouthfeel is quite oily, and very silky. The flavor starts with a sharp ""burnt currant"" note, revealing some chocolatey notes as it warms in the mouth, then a solid hop flavor & bitterness, eventually followed by an intense burnt roastiness. The high level of alcohol is surprisingly hidden. A complex, and absolutely intense beer that's best served in a small glass. (But I was upset when the put the Old Crusty in the small XS bottle!) This does not seem to have aged any better than a recent 2001. In fact, I wonder if it will age well at all, as the hops that are present seem to help distinguish this beer and I don't see the flavors rounding for the better - that will just restrict the complexity! All that might happen is that the hop flavors will become muddled. Hmmm? Only time will tell. An excellent beer in its own right, but not my choice for a stylistically correct Imperial Stout. Still, INTENSE. Makes quite a nightcap."
"2001: Aroma on this reminds me of Rogue's mocha porter - lots of coffee and dark malt.  Lots of coffee in the flavor, with a fairly prominent alcohol presence (wonder what the ABV is on this one?).  Easily in a class with Sam Smith's Imperial Stout, and seems a bit sweeter.  Another winner from Rogue."
"I find this the closest imperial to Expedition....at first taste I thought the hops were too hot and the malt too light but on second taste I find this outstanding....a great balance...hopped up, but balanced with the nice thick malt......top of the rung for Imperials.."
"2001: While this style is not my fav this is a very good beer.  From the dark as night color to the heavy creamy head, it makes you think you may need a spoon to taste it.  Very good scent, like the beer is signaling you that ""hey I am here"". Nice feel on the tongue and the only resaon I give it a lower mark on drinkability is that its not for the novice or the faint of heart................CHEERS"
"2001: Pours with a gargantuan rocky, dense rusty colored head. Looks like one could float a coin on it. Settles into opaque blackness, with the nose smelling of chocolate, burnt malts, alcohol and hops...and greatness! Taste is tangy, thick, burnt, hoppy, alcoholic, it goes on and on. It's almost sensory overload with this excellent beer. Finishes with a warming liquor-ish sensation as it flows down the throat. Superb!"
"2000: Pours a bit like motor oil. A small creamy brown head disappears within seconds. A unique sweet/roasty mix in the aroma. Thick black appearance with fine sediment settling to the bottom. There's a great roasted malt taste present. There's a sweet and a bit of an alcoholic taste reminiscent of fine barleywine style beers. The bitterness is intense, as it should be for this style. And it lingers long after the drink. The IBU is 87.5. It takes an incredible malt load to balance this hopping so nicely. A truly great BIG BEER from one of the BIG BEER kings, John Maier."
"Bottle says best when aged one year, bottled in 2001. Some sort of coding on label, which might indicate actual bottling, but it would only be a guess (Dec 10,2001 in my case).  Anyway beer is quite fine now, at roughly half year (I think)."
"I'll save a couple of bottles for the autumn/winter if I have the willpower!"
"Black is beautiful and this beer is as black as it can get. Thick a touch sweet with an edge from the high roasted malts.  The one I just had was a 2000 but I didn't see any reason to add another entry. I think this is one of the best Imperials out there. Too bad they are not bottling them anymore. If you find one buy it, if not definately try it on tap if you are here in Portland, or Newport Oregon."
