"Overall: As stouts go, this one is an absolute killer - fantastic smell, massive flavour profile and a well-disguised ABV. I suspect this would benefit from some aging but as it comes it's absolutely stunning. The first beer I've had from Nøgne Ø and it certainly won't be the last - this should be on the shopping list of any stout enthusiast."

"Enticing, pleasant drinker."
"A solid, straight forward RIS. I think the execution was on-point, and the lack of evident flaws is commendable. But, for me, it was a little too much char and a little too one-dimensional."
"Feel:  Just the right amount of thickness - moreso than a smaller stout and typical of a RIS.  Carbonation was just right."
"Drinkability – A good, but not exceptional stout."
"Dark in appearance. Medium brown head. Smooth"

"This is really fantastic.  Deep rich mouthfeel.  Good lacing.  Aroma and taste of molasses, coffee, cocoa, tofee.  Really rich and full mouthfeel.  A little too much booze on the finish, but overall an excellent stout."

"Pours to a thick light brown head and black color. Aroma is dark cherries, vanilla and tons of mocha and a bit of bread and smoke. Flavor is smooth, creamy, roasty and damn delicious with a soft vanilla and hop finish. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall an outstanding imperial stout."

"O: Excellent - a monster stout with an amazing character. It looks great, while the aroma and flavour are replete with roasted malt, coffee and dried fruit. Complex and bitter. Lovely creamy body. A top-notch imperial stout; Nøgne Ø have outclassed themselves. Add this to your must-try list."

"A big strong Imp Stout, seemed simple at first, but has nice complex flavours. Had it just 8 months old."

"One word keeps coming to mind each time I think about this beer and it's ""crazy."" Not in a super hoppy DIPA way that kicks you in the face with a huge amount of some flavor, but in that it's supremely hard to pin this one down. It's crazy because it's so many contradictory things at once. Not only in that such a huge beer can be subtle, but also that beneath that subtlety lies a complexity that is like a gift every time it hits your tongue. Well balanced and extremely flavorful, strong and yet dangerously drinkable, this is a beer that I will want to come back to again and again."

"Food match: The beer gravy comment I made earlier got me thinking of actually pouring this over slices of roast beef and giving the meal a side of roasted potatoes and peas... why drink a beer when you can eat it? Food for thought."

"O: In overall I’d give this beer some time to mature in the bottle, perfect roastiness balanced with dark fruit esters and alcohol. It could be more malty and barley-wine like."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of wood, slight sweet malt, yeast, hint of roasted malt, alcohol, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, alcohol, slight liquor, hint of yeast, and slight hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"a really hearty stout, appropriately dense for its norwegian heritage. dark brown almost black, with a soft eggshell finish and over an inch and a half of micro bubble tan head as dense as they come. the nose shows a simple beer at heart, dark barley, cara deepness, and a lioghter almost herbal quality, but rather straightforward. the flavor starts with the dark roast of the barley, and a residual sugar that is tough to explain. maybe slightly under attenuated property, but it works with the rest of the heft here. come dry dark bakers chocolate and a hint of licorice meld into a rather smooth semisweet finish that suggests oatmeal, but i dont know if its there for real or not. bitterness abounds after the swallow though, a nice transition. body is enormous, overweight even, but in a wintery context with some nice rare red meat, its a match made in heaven. smooth as gravy. worth what they ask for it."
""
""
""
"Overall a really great RIS, hits all the right notes right where you want them. I'm having trouble finding any fault with this beer."
"Edit - 3-1-2015 - I aged a bottle for a year. I think this was unnecessary. I bought another last week to age but I will consume it instead. It's good aged. Way smoother than say an un-aged Great Lakes Blackout Stout, but still, I'll just drink it sooner rather than later."
"This beer follows suit like so many Danish/northern European black ales – it's deep and mysterious, velvety smooth; deep and rich in flavor and texture. Black ales, the bold and complex ones, come across much like this RIS example. It's hard to go wrong with this strong, exemplary offering."
""
"Overall: I had very high hopes for this one after the aroma but the taste is over the top roasted, coffee tones. I wish the body of the brew was more like the front and finish."
""
"The beer is opaque and deep, dark brown with a thick, oily, beige collar. The aroma brings loads of malt and chocolate. Distinctly European in both aroma and flavor. Prominent dark fruits and rich chocolates. Low carbonation with a medium body, lighter than I expected given the appearance and abv. Overall, this is a solid beer. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"Excellent rendition of a difficult style, which has become so popular in the U.S. With the exceptions of Founder's and Goose Island's Bourbon County line, this beats anything I have had from the U.S. in this style and would give the best British examples a run for their money. A bit expensive, at least where I live."
"On-tap. Tasting glass enjoyed @ BierCab (Barcelona). Pitch black headed by sticky & lasting crown, tan in color. Bitter cocoa, Bamberg malt, roasted barley aromas with herbal notes. Creamy upfront yields to herbal bitterness. Full body. Moderate to soft carbonation. Oily texture & velvet palate. Tannin touch & licorice candy notes in the middle. Warming alcohol, dried sensation & plum zest-like astringency linger into a long bitter finish. Cocoa hues on the aftertaste. Big beer !"
"Enjoyed from a snifter glass (bottled) and from Nøgne Ø shaker glass (tap)."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely worth a try, but not nearly as good as Beer Geek Brunch, which is also brewed at Nøgne Ø (by Mikkeller). An excellent imperial stout."
"A round full mouthfeel with that interesting fruity ester. A really enjoyable large stout."
""
""
"O: Though there’s a disconnect between the nose and the palate, this is a delectably complex beer. It’s not what I anticipated at all, but that might be because I’m accustomed to the thick, liquid-chocolate stouts of the U.S.; at any rate, this is definitely one to try if you have a chance."
""
""
""
"O: A very impressive Imperial stout. Very well put together, it really does not have a weak point. Worth seeking out."

"EDIT: Had another one Feb 21, 2012 and what really impressed me was the perfume of this beer. So nice and so well composed and so much going on. Fresh, fruity, maybe even a little floral. Just so nice. Also, I normally savor good beers by themselves rather than with meals. With meals I like something simple and light that doesn't compete with flavors. But I had this beer with a roast chicken and sauteed potatoes and it went so well with those robust flavors. Just a great beer from a great brewery."

"I got excited about this the minute I smelt the open beer bottle. Pours black with a gorgeous big tan brown foamy white head which holds. Nose is sweet. Milk chocolate and dark chocolate syrup. Also some liquorice allsorts and some citrous hops. Taste is bloody gorgeous. Light fluffy liquid chocolate. Silky smooth and then a bit of roasted bitterness on the finish. Wooo baby that’s good."

""
""
"This is rock solid stuff of such high quality and flavour that just makes drinking beer worthwhile"
""
"O: Decent RIS. Heavy on the char and smoke, not your typical chocolate/coffee concoction. Fairly dry too, most RISes are quite sweet. Definitely check this out if you're into the charry, smoky, umami-type RISes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The appearance of mucky yeast globs in the beer definitely made this one a challenge to enjoy. Would I drink it again? Maybe."
""
"I can't read or pronounce the name of this RIS or the name of the brewery it came from, but there's nothing foreign of unusual about it's qualities. There isn't anything surprising or off-putting about it. It's just a solid imperial stout that does a good job with all the basic things imp stouts do."
""

"Some sweetness, but the overall drying in the end is very welcome, not only when it comes to being drinkable but in that we are able to pick up the nuances quickly."

"Bottle. Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of fine light brown head. Good retention; minimal lacing. Aroma is medium roast and dark malt--notes of bitter chocolate and coffee. Flavor is similar: mild bitterness and roast up front, fading into dark chocolate, coffee and mild alcohol in the finish. Soft carbonation, medium body, and smooth texture. Excellent beer."
""

""

"Another winner from this brewery that only seems to brew the beefiest of beer styles - not that there's anything wrong with that, given their obvious proficiency. Balanced, somewhat, i.e. not too sweet, and with an ABV that is most agreeably shy. What's not to like?"
""
""
"O- A very bold stout with high roast character and a smooth finish. Met my expectations."
""
""
"O: Really let this beer warm up. Allows it to shine. Well-crafted and such a joy to drink."
""

"O - Good balance and nice complexity. Definitely coffee oriented but to style. Recommended!"
""
"500 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark mocha head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, toast, raisin, fig, licorice, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with big balance, strength, and complexity of dark roasted notes and light fruitiness. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, fig, light molasses, toast, licorice, oats, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, light molasses, toast, licorice, oats, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark roasted flavors and fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout. Great complexity and balance of very dark roasted malt flavors; and extremely smooth and easy to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering!"

"Thanks to Scandinavian beer prices I bet I paid more than I would have stateside, but my lovely state doesn't get this great breweries stuff. Had this in my backpack and had to crack it in Budapest after way too many lagers through east central Europe. Hit the spot."
"honestly, i had way higher hopes for this one. it was really a sub-par imperial stout, and coming from this brewer, it's hard to believe they'd be ok with this. now don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible or anywhere near that. i just get the feeling that nogne o is a very prestigious brand of beer and expected a prestigious imperial stout, whereas this was just ""pretty good""."

"Impenetrable by light, this beer is black as night and has a smallish caramel coloured head. Aroma of smoke and generally a very roasty scent. Beautiful. Taste is very complex in my opinion, having alot of roastiness, fruit and slight bitterness. Definitely interesting, you notice new notes on every sip and gulp. The mouthfeel is rather light and easy, which is what I prefer, and goes down rather easy. Wish I had more of this, definitely a keeper."
""
""

"Inky black, this beer is void of color. Head is hard to coax out, a thin line of khaki clings to the glass. A big swirl brings out a thin layer of head that looks like crema on an espresso. Lots of chocolate in the aroma. Sweet like a milk stout with  noticeable alcohol aroma. I also get slight spice, like sage. Taste consists of burnt toast, licorice, bakers chocolate, some caramel, and slight oak in the malt. The beer bitters out well with grassy hops, perhaps the source of sage I sniffed earlier. The finish is dry and somewhat chalky, feel is slightly watery which is quite a feat considering the amount of malt going into this. Alcohol is hidden well."
""

"FEEL (4.5/5) – Full bodied with medium-low carbonation play really well. I think that it hit a nice balance between being really velvety and fluffy."
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Pitch black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and crazy lacing. Big roasty nose with a subtle sweetness to it. Loads of dark chocolate and coffee along with hints of vanilla and peat with just a touch of licorice. The bitter dark chocolate and roasty coffee dominate the taste as well, along with hints of dark fruit, leather, tobacco, molasses, licorice, and some burnt espresso. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a great bitter dry finish. The 9% ABV is almost non-existent making this scary drinkable. Yet another top notch offering from Nøgne Ø!"

"O: built to travel - great RIS, nice and strong with the crisp bitter flavors and the roasted dark chocolate malt undertones. Definitely suitable for cold weather endeavors, and warming by firelight"
""
"Ink black and completely opaque. No highlights. The only trace of colour is a large, retentive, and lacy tan head. Licorice, black coffee, and dried fruit aroma betrays very little alcoholic potency. Roasted malt flavour is up front with dark roast coffee and char notes, which are then joined by molasses, raisin, and black plum. This gives the beer a bittersweet flavour profile. That charred flavour holds on long into the drying finish. It shows very little of it's 9% ABV. The flavour shows great depth. Full-bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. This full-flavoured stout is delicious and looks like sex in a glass. Very enjoyable."
"O- nice RIS. Peat is not overpowering like many Nogne-O, Brewdog, Mikkeller, etc beers."

"A superb imperial stout here, world class, and right up there with the big American names."
""
""
"Pours black with a nice brown head that lingered for a bit. Smells mostly of roasted burnt stuff, a bit of sweet chocolatey and coffee smells mixed. Nice mouthfeel and body on this beer, tastes of burnt roasted flavors with some sour/fruity notes, though they are subtle. I enjoyed this beer but would be hesitant to spend the $$$ on this when there are better and cheaper options available. Straightforward solid imperial stout."
"Good, and I'm glad I got to try it, but often too expensive to make a purchase worthwhile."
"Overall. Great stuff. Nothing fancy, just a solid imperial stout/ris."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is of roasted coffee malts, chocolate, vanilla, hops and dried fruit. Really complex and tastey RIS, in fact its excellent. A bit bitter, but nice. Well worth a try of this beer. For a price of $10 USD (in the states) is very worth it, because this cost me USD $25 in Oslo! But it was worth the elevated price."

"O: If I could compare this to any other RIS on the market, I'd say it's very reminiscent of Old Rasputin in terms of its flavor and aroma, albeit with greater refinement. I REALLY enjoy this, but it's a poor value at $10/bottle (it's worth it, though!) Actually, the biggest flaw with this is this simple fact: I'm more in love with how it was crafted rather than how it tastes. Who cares?! Any stout fan worth his/her weight in saffron should try this one."

""
""

"O - big bold flavours as a big beer should have, not best in class but definitely worth a try if you are a fan of the style"
"A straightforward imperial stout. Hard to justify this purchase when Founders Imperial Stout is cheaper and significantly better in all areas."
""
"O - Cool beer. Worth a try for sure."
"Body is full, with some softer carbonation which gives a creamy feel. Some warmth from alcohol but not overwhelming. A pretty nice beer."
"4.0 D: Solid imperial stout. I wish this was cheaper because if it was I would definitely include it in my rotation. Good beer."

"original review on: 08-26-2010"
"I think in Norway a year-around Imperial Stout is pretty much a necessity and this is a damn good one. Yeah it's black. Frothy espresso-like foam sits on top. It looks menacing and inviting all at once. Deep cocoa and French roast coffee. Am even, earthy bitterness holds off the malt assault. Thick but not too sweet. Perfect balance. Smoke, tobacco, and charred sugars emerge as it warms. One of the best, no frills Imperial Stouts around."
""
"o - drinkability is high as is enjoyment. the only thing stopping me from drinking this on a regular basis is the $9/bottle price tag. as the label states, this pairs very well with vanilla ice cream."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth and creamy drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
" cheers liamt07 for knocking this one off my want list, I could drink this one daily like lame folks take vitamin's, so rich and creamy without being super heavy. this is worth seeking out, I love imperial oatmeal stouts and this one is a beautiful example of one"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a really good imperial stout, I'm glad I have a couple more!"
""
"Overall: Nose & mouthfeel stand out, use of oats created subtle pleasantries in the body. Somewhat brown for an imperial stout and lacked depth of flavor overall. Would love to try this with some vanilla ice-cream."
""

""
"D ~ A good stout. New to our state, & glad that its here. Worth a try for sure!"
""
""
"All in all, an impressive imperial stout."
"O: I find myself enjoying the American style versions of imperial stouts more often with more chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors. This beer was quite complex and I enjoyed drinking it, but I find it merely suitable."
""
"O/D - Nice strong stout. Really rich and complex. Good stuff and enjoyable to drink."
"A fantastic IS. Very full flavored and easy to drink. Huge amount of sludge left in the glass, this is indeed a live beer."
"O - Nice bold flavours, though more bitter than sweet. The mouthfeel was the only drawback, but certainly well worth seeking out."
"Overall a great stout. It has a good deal more dark fruit qualities than many others and has earned a place in my regular rotation of imperial stouts. If it's this creamy and complex now, I look forward to seeing what some age is going to do to it. This one is well worth a try if you see it on the shelves. "
"O- Overall this has to be one of the best Russian Imperial Stout's I have had, period. Very tasty, very smooth, very well balanced. Paired perfectly with dark chocolate. Definitely worth a try and is very highly recommended."
"Overall, a very good beer. I was surprised at how complex the flavor was, as it seems like a lot of beers in this style seem to be dominated by coffee and dark roasted malt. There were a lot of characteristics that reminded me of a black IPA, and the hop bitterness was a major contributor to the taste. Definitely dug it and will be looking for it again."
"O: Im enjoying this stout though to smokey for my tastes. They don't even use smoked malts in this beer which surprises me that it comes off that distinguished in the flavor. Decent overall stout."
"O - Beautiful RIS! Complex, smooth and not boozy. This is my first Norwegian beer, and I can only hope I'll try more Nøgne Ø beers in the nearest future."
"More authentically English in the RIS style, but mellowed. Not out there or upfront. Just... good. Not rich, but satisfying. Not incredibly complex, but complete. Pretty average, but exemplary. Fitting. Glad I had it."
"O: Good imperial stout, very drinkable and smooth, nice balance of bitter and sweet"
""
""
"O: My first Nogne O offering, but certainly not my last; this impressive stout has inspired me to try a wider range of their portfolio."
"I would fully believe the label's claim that ""this beer ages well"" and would definitely pick up a couple more to test out if I run into it again. Smoother alcohol with more fruit and leather/tobacco is what I'd expect and would be much appreciated. I've been very impressed with imperial stouts out of Scandinavia; for some reason it makes sense that they would be brewing up fine specimens of this style. No exception here, really great stuff. Wish I had more."
""
"A really good beer, in my opinion. Very glad that the LCBO brought this one in."
""
""
""
"O: The taste of the alcohol is very well hidden in this beer which makes the beer quite enjoyable. I could drink several of these beers though I shudder to think of my level of tipsiness if I did that. I think this is a much better beer for a cold winter day than another time of year. Definitely a beer that I would buy again."
"Overall, this was a lot better than expected. It's blended extremely well, and the flavor is not lacking. Bitterness is more than I expected from a lighter RIS such as this which is quite nice. I'm really surprised that I don't hear about this stout more often than I do. Hopefully I can still find more on the shelves."
"Overall: A very solid imperial stout. Great use of dark malts and the fruits add a nice sweetness."
""
"D: Rich, filling, and flavourful, but with exceptional balance and body that makes it easier-drinking than more intense RISs. Definitely worth trying, especially on a winter night."
""
"A very rich chocolatey RIS. The tangy yeast plays a major role along with the chocolate. It's sweet and robust with a dry roasty finish."
"Overall a little on the timid side of an RIS, but still a really solid beer."
""
"Not the most extreme RIS in any aspect, but is wonderfully balanced and quite easy drinking. A bit of time should continue to work wonders on this one as it rests in the cellar."
"My first brew from Norway, and boy did they hit this one out of the water. Loads of character, a delightful smoky complexion, and a well-hidden extra punch of booze, this will definitely be a repeat purchase for me. Recommended."
"Pours dark, jet black with caramal coloured head. Tastes very roasty, with notes of chocolate and slight smoke in the finish. The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't interfer with the taste. Decent stout overall and I would pick this up more if it was regularly available."
""
""
""
"Great effort at a Russian Imperial Stout, most pleasing was the fact that the flavours masked the alcohol, which isn't always the case with this style (in my experience)"
"What amazes me about beer is that it makes infinite use of finite means; it has has only 4 ingredients and yet it produces such a wide, diverse range of aromas, flavors and textures. Nøgne Ø brews just about the whole range of them and this, Imperial Stout, is perhaps their most rich and decadent offering. Definitely recommended."
""
"Overall, pretty nice. It's not as richly sweet as some Russian imperial stouts tend to be, but it has a nice complex, full, flavor, and is well crafted."
"Nice thick mouthfeel that really lingers on the palate. Very drinkable. What a wonderful beer!"
""
""
"Nice work."
"Big Thanks to Illudium for the Xmas treat!"
"Jet black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head, lots of lace left behind. Smell is of roasted malt, big hop bill, smokey notes, bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruit, leather (once I read the label this is all I focused on), some citrus/earth from the hops underneath all the roasted malt. Taste is fairly roasted, chocolate milk flavours, very hoppy even leaving a citrusy aftertaste, coffee and burnt malts in the finish. Full body, creamy, medium carbonation abnd very silky. Good RIS, perhaps a bit too hoppy, I will give this anohter shot 10-12 months down the line to numb some of that hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"An excellent brew and really one of the best RIS' i have had. I will definitely grab a few more of these while they are around and I may have to break the bank to buy some more from this brewer."
"Pours almost completely black with a finger and change of brown head, with a reddish/crimson tinge to it. Very creamy and almost 'whipped' head. Dense lace and fantastic retention, looks awesome. Nose has some light coffee, milk chocolate, hints of smoke, char, and leather (the label suggested it, and I oculd actually detect this is some amounts). Taste has some bitter dark chocolate, coffee, caramelized and booze soaked dark fruits. Again, a touch of char or smoke, with a prevalent sweet (almost vanilla/almond-y character). Rich and pretty complex, with a creamy and thick feel. Good density and weight to the body. Fairly roasty and bitter finish. Good complexity and the alcohol is well hidden. Certainly dug this one, and I may stock up on this for the upcoming winter months."
""
""
"O- Excellent stout, overall excellent experience"
""
""
""
"Imperial stout-like appearance, the color of thick, thick oil with no lacing and a good bit of aromas of roasty dark chocolate and coffee. It’s an excellent beer, tasting of dark chocolate and espresso and a bit of booze to give it a smooth kick as it warms. What strikes me and makes this a unique beer is the licorice I pick up. Black licorice, without the anise or fennel overtures. This is one brew I’d love to revisit."

"A special find of the shelf in NC! Perefect blend of bitterness, roast, and sweetness. Dark inky black in color with mud-brown head. Taste in well-balanced, velvety. Nice coffee and chocolate flavors in abundance. Just melts in your mouth. I want more and would like to try other varieties from this brewer...but I moved away from NC!"
""
"(And with that sentence I am officially going to have to shoot myself)"
"Really nice balance of sweet/roasty with just a hint of alcohol warmth. Very pleasant!"

"Poured a oil like black body w/ tan han that left some lace down the glass. A somewhat boozy aroma of thick, roasted malts w/ some oakiness and I'm getting minimal sweet malts and very little hop bitterness. Actually poured smooth and creamy w/ touches of oak and chocolate before a large, chewy chunk of bready, roasted malts hit my toungue for the dryness I was expecting. Finishes dry and crisp, more perhaps due to the large amount of roasted (bordering coffee) malts and ABV than the somewhat muted floral hop bitterness. Nice balance, a good sipping stout I enjoyed after dinner and I like the minor sweetness as well."
"O - a little missing here and there, but over all a good brew. Glad I tried this one and let it sit for so long... I'll buy another and do the same to it too :) Happy Friday"

"O- A very tasty brew and one that I would like to see progress with a bit of age."
""
"O - I like the smokyness in this RIS. Its not dominant and is well backed up by other flavours."
"Overall- Very well crafted and masks any alcohol that might be in the drink. The mix of roasted and chocolate malt save it from being boring. Nøgne Ø Imperial Stout is a must try."
"My 2nd nogne. Loved them both."
"O: Nice, balanced and smooth. The only thing I wish for is: more of everything!"
"O - Nice RIS, I like the dark fruit tones, just not as ""big"" as others that I prefer"
"The beer is full bodied, but it's like the lowest level of full bodied. Whatever the cutoff is between medium and full bodied, this beer sits right on it. A lot of imperial stouts have such big, rich bodies that they're contemplative sippers. Not this one. It's dangerously drinkable, and one could easily fly right through 500mL of it. It's probably best for me that the bottle isn't any bigger. Glad to finally try a beer from these guys."
"This brew was on tap at the Tap & Table, I managed to get the last of the keg right before it was kicked. The look of the beer was a murky blackish brown color. There was a ton of sediment in the glass from the bottom of the barrel. However the smell of the beer was decent, it had lots of roasted malts, a sweet boozy aroma, a little coffee in there too and some earth. The taste of the beer was pretty good, again chocolaty and roasted. Found it to be a little too earthy, probably from all the yeast and stuff in it. I'd need to have this one again to really get a good grasp of it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, overall this beer seemed to have a good amount of potential. If I see it again I'll have it again for sure."
"Overall it's solid, not a total knockout but certainly very enjoyable. A good simple example of the style I could have any time."
"D: This is going down way too easy. Would love to drink this again. Up there among the better Russian Imperial Stouts in my opinion."
"D- a little too drinkable lol i enjoyed this very much easily got half way when the booze hit me the flavors mask the alcohol a little too well"
"D- a little too drinkable for my own good, the bold flavors mask the alcohol a little too well and in exploring the flavor profile i start swiggin away and put her down."
"I actually really like a lot of this. The flavors up front are exceptional, but the beer finishes poorly and isn’t overly enjoyable to drink. I very worth effort that seems to indicate to me drink fresh or well aged."
"This is a quite a bit thicker than other RIS that I have tried which I liked, it doesnt have an overpowering taste like others that I prefer. Maybe because the abv is a little lower than those others. Overall a good beer."
"low carbonation, thicker body. slick aftertaste. overall, a solid beer."
"A true reconforting beer for those cold winter days. Awesome."
"O: A really nice beer. Quite enjoyable, definitely worth a try. First beer I've had from Nøgne, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings."
"O: Not my favourite imperial stout, but still an above average beer. I wouldn't recommend it, especially for the price, but it's still a good beer. To be fair, it improves at it warms, the odd sourness developing into a berry fruitiness."
"O: A good beer, but kind of a let down on the taste. Not bad flavors, but the flavors there seem a bit out of balance. The fruitiness is unique, but could have been done much better if it were balanced in with the rest of the taste. I will say that this is a beer that improves with warmth."
"O - A good RIS but not one I would search out again. The sweetness was a little much for me."
"O-Unpleasantly acidic and dry. Tastes like it's past its prime. Will have to try a fresh one."
"16.9 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. Pours thick and black with two fingers of rich, chocolate colored foam. Some carbonation is evident. Good lacing. Nose is sweet without being overly malty. Mainly a milk chocolate scent. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Not syrupy, heavy, or too malty. Carbonation is a touch low. Palate has hints of coffee and dark chocolate but the mild sweetness gives me more milk chocolate than anything else. The label claims 75 IBUs but I'm not getting that much bitterness. Still, this is nicely balanced and very drinkable. I wish the bottle were bigger."
"O: can't say this is a favorite, flavors are there but aren't in my perfered flavor strength if that makes sense."
"Overall: Awesome Russian imperial stout. A nice sipping beer @ 9 % alcohol by volume. This was my first beer by nogne – and I was thoroughly impressed"
"O - This one was pretty good but I would go chasing it down or anything. It seemed to be a little confused with itself, with lots going on and nothing really standing out."
"O= extremely well-done and world-class impressive. It didn't go bad with the mega-club sandwich on rye-marble bread (packed with meats and cheeses) that I happen to be eating when someone else thought they'd like to try this beer. It wouldn't be my first choice but it actually paired well, to my surprise."
"O - Obscenely easy to down. Delicious and gorgeous. The only issue is the feel, which is a bit too thin for this style."
"O - Very interesting beer. The appearance and aroma set up a taste that doesn't show up. Instead it changes bases and gives you something else entirely, still very good, but not what was expected. The mouthfeel was thinner than I would have liked. In our tasting we discussed that this could easily be called a baltic porter with a little bit of smoky flavor added."
"Overall, a really well made and tasty stout. The chocolate and coffee notes create great flavor and really set this stout apart. Definitely will try again."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a very lively amount of carbonation that is maybe a bit too high. It is quite roasty and fruity but so carbonated that it distracts from the experience quite a bit. The abv is bold with fruity esters and a solid warming factor. Overall not bad but nothing to go out of your way for."
"The cpj"
"WOW!!! What a stout…very complex…...not a session, but very tasty!! The color is very dark as most stouts are. The head was creamy and a nice tan color. There is a definite roastyness to the nose, which makes one salvate. The subtle hops balance alcohol and roast/malt. Use a brandy sniffer if your classy!!!"
"There are burnt elements to the taste. Very dry on the tongue. I can almost taste the chard pieces from a barbeque. Smooth body with a near perfect richness and carbonation. The aftertaste is of burnt toast and heavily roasted nuts--almond and hazelnut. Close to harsh finish, but it stops just shy of that monicker."
"D: This is a tasty, dry, malty, roasty, awesome beer; great job once again, Nogne!"
"O: very good RIS, and while I enjoyed this, it did not blow me away. It is a looker, though."
"O: This beer is incredibly drinkable considering its alcohol content, which is well hidden."
"Slides out of the bottle black with orange-tan head. Roasted malt, light chocolate, cocoa, light esters in the background. Flavor is a mixture of coffee and tartness up front and ends with a robust, bold, dry finish of dark chocolate. Medium to full body with great lingering malt bitterness. One of the best Russian imperials I've tried."
"The high abv and slightly chocolate coated charcoal aftertaste makes this beer a good sipper, but hard to drink a lot of. However, the beer cost a good dollar now being sent far away overseas for only a pint worth of beverage. I have paid more for beer, but at least give me a 750mL bottle that I can split with another person?! I look forward to trying this brewery's others (there are only 3 more available to me), this one was a pretty damn good imperial stout."
"D: WHile I enjoyed this brew from Nogne, for the price, I know I would enjoy 4 Brooklyn BCS, 3-4 Old Rasputins, or 2-3 Founders Imperial Stout or Bell's Expedition Stouts a lot more. Nothing really badly off with this beer, but less licorice and more smoothness in the feel and I think i would be much more favorable toward this brew."
"Thick, very black, dark, and solid, this beer is immediately interesting. Smokey and roasted...it's a very dark, rich, and intensely carbon-rich beer. Lots of wood-smoke, charcoal, and overly roasted-nearly burnt flavors. Wow. The beer's flavor, however, can be a little one-sided. Other than some alcohol warmth, the beer doesn't have a lot of competing characteristics. A little malt, some hop bitterness, but not much else. Alcohol becomes in increasingly prominent. The beer is full bodied, and very thick. All in all, an interesting and very engaging beer, despite the unilateral character."
"Drinkability: Man, do I love some Nøgne Ø! I'm never disappointed with any of their selections. This Russian Imperial Stout is highly drinkable by itself, but should have heeded the suggestion on the bottle and tried it with some ice cream, for a float. I guess that just gives me a reason to buy another and try it in different variation."
"D - ?? Well it's good for an imperial stout."
"Drinkabilty - Its strong so this 16.9 oz is perfect. Very unique taste, its smooth and not overly strong flavor. Different from other stouts out there. If your looking for something new and different check this beer out, im impressed"
"Drinkability: With all the outstanding RISs available today, you've got to really bring it to earn 4 & 5 stars. While this one is quite easy to drink, and enjoyable, and definitely worth trying, it's just not a standout not in the field."
"Verdict: World CLass uniqe take on Imperial stout. Must find folks."
"Very good drinkability. For a stout of this size you're most likely only having one anyway and this seems to be best enjoyed when sipped slow."
"This is a really big and thick stout. I love the nose, but overall a bit one dimensional. To much bitterness from the chocolate, and a bit acrid for my tastes. Not bad, but there are many Imperial Stouts that I like better."
"Overall, this is one of the finest imperial stouts that I've had. It doesn't have bitterness of Stone, Stormking, or even Rasputin, nor the malt taste of Samuel Smith and Brooklyn, nor the coffee of Founders. This beer is all about the darkest roast, and thus is unlike any other RIS I've had recently. One of my favorite imperial stouts."
"D -Some folks like that alcohol warmness in high ABV beers, but at 9% Alc/Vol it surprisingly doesn't have an alcohol bite. That plus being on the thin side makes it dangerously drinkable. Not bad, but not best in class"
"D - this is a really good RIS - I have been wanting to try it for a while now. I didn't realize this was available around here and randomly stumbled upon it. I will definitely grab this one again."
"D: I thought it was solid imperial stout and was digging the chocolate character all around, definitely a sipper but very tasty."
"Overall this was a very easy-drinking beer for the style that has a lot of things going on. Well worth a shot."
"Pitch black color. Poured like motor oil. Thin espresso head. Really interesting smell. Smells like licorice, molasses, nuts, and coffee. Taste is very sweet. Smokey malts. Some coffee and plum. Medium to fuller body. Pretty rich and creamy mouth-feel. Nice drink. It might be a little too sweet for me in this style."
"Pours a very deep black with a medium reddish brown head with lots of good lace. Looks about as good as a stout could. The aroma is whisky and molasses with a dark Cavendish tobacco character that really as the beer warms becomes the most prevalent aroma. There is a good bit of fruity hoppiness to the aroma as well. The flavor starts off with a good cherry and malt sweetness which gives way to lots of molasses and Cavendish with light hints of vanilla and wood. If you were to tell me this was barrel aged I would have no problem believing that. The beer although starting off a little malty sweet finishes with a straw like dryness, perplexing. The palate is silky and rich. Absolutely top notch as far as Imperial Stout goes."
"I've had a few bottles of this and it doesn't rock me like I'd hope. I've added creme de cassis to it though to make an imperial blackcurrant stout, and now that does taste good!"
"M- Disappointingly thin, especially after how thick it looks on the pour and how it clings to the glass. Carbonation is quite low which helps create a smoothness that is very welcomed."
"D - This is a good RIS but not something I'd want to tackle a bottle of by myself. Good brew, and none of the alcohol shows through at all."
"Not the best Imperial stout...it falls somewhat flat. Good looks, but fairly bland and one dimensional. Alcohol and roasted malt in the nose, a bit of chocolate and coffee in there, but its muddled and weak. Messy blend of coffee and malts, with an odd bread-y taste not suited to an Imperial stout. It just seems a little undeveloped. Thinnish body, could be a bit thicker. Normally I enjoy Imperial stouts, but this just seem underdone."
"Overall this beer is huge, so much more than expected, but not in a bad way at all. Big and extremely bold, but well balanced. At first I thought pretty one dimensional but it had a lot going on with this as it got warmer and warmer."
"D- fantastic beer, but the pricing is outrageous...13 bucks for 500 mL."
"Bottle sample thanks to Cratez. Deep opaque black liquid has modest creamy mocha cap.Intense nose of licorice, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and caramelized red meat. Sweet and hugely bitter, with dark fruits, chocolate, and roasted malts, add soy sauce, and bit of smoke.Full body has a thick feel to it. Creamy carbonation with a long bitter finish. Good. Thanks Mike!"
"A fantatic execution of the style with bigh char and roast notes along with hints of fruit and citrus complexity. A great beer to seek out for the long days of winter."
"A powerful and complex brew. Sampled at a beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"M&D: to me, the contrast b/w the sweet & dense nose and superbly balanced flavour cannot be greater; this smoothly-carbonated, rounded, delicately-sour RIS on the palate is not much like an American hoppy interpretation of the style, but a robust, deep, full-bodied and yet nicely-balanced treat deserving a round of applause in its own right. I can't say what is particularly ""right"" about this beer, but all seem to be in the right places and the overall flavour structure cannot be overlooked by any experienced drinker. I truly enjoy it on this special day as a Taiwanese - ""Gan Bei"" to the 99-year-old R.O.C.!"
"Medium mouthfeel, not the heaviest for a stout that I've had, but not the lightest either. Good drinkability from the lighter body and clean/non-cloyingly sweet flavor profile. A refined and elegant stout with some big flavors."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has a lot of great flavors to it. It had more sweetness to it then many in the style but it actually balanced it pretty well. Decent beer for the style and a well made, well balanced one as well."
"Overall its good, maybe a bit to hoppy, generally I like a nice hoppy stout, but this one seems to take it a bit to far with the hops really dominating. Still enjoyable and worth a try."
"Overall an interesting RIS. This deviates from the classic style, with more herbal hop and chocolate sweetness than you would expect for the style."
"Drinkability is ok; this one is a bit on the hoppy side to me, a bit dry, could use a dash of richness to really make things pop. Doesn't quite sing to me."
"pours your standard imperial stout deep, dark brown/black... about a finger of a chestnut toned head with respectable retention and lacing. nose is dominated primarily by roasted and chocolate malts, with coffee being evident as well. more of the same pull through in the taste, plus notes of dark fruits. heavy-bodied, velvely mouthfeel. while not my personal favorite, this is a tasty, well-built imperial stout well worth a try."
"taste is smooth, milk chocolate, coffee, some licorice, malt, and some roasted nuts, ends dry and a tad on the bitter side."
"Have to say I enjoyed previous bottles more, not sure if this bottle has something off or now that I am sitting down to interrogate it the smoke has become more noticeable. Still, a pleasant RIS which I remember thoroughly enjoying in past experiences."
"Excellent stuff, gonna try to get a hold of a coupla more bottles. Actually kinda reminds me a bit of a Baltic Porter in the mouthfeel, abv, and flavor profile, and doesn't really surprise me coming from a brewery in Norway."
"D: This was a very nice sweet double stout that was quite tasty and I liked it. The alcohol was hidden fairly well too, so it was quite easy to drink. Age may help, but probably not too long term. Nothing unique, but a solid example of the style that is very enjoyable fresh."
"D_Very drinkable especially for a high ABV."
"D: With all the excitement over huge barrel aged stouts, it is nice to have a decent, traditional imperial stout every once in a while. This was a good stout, but did disappoint a little in the mid to late taste. But overall, still very drinkable."
"One of the best stouts I have had in a very long time. Very well crafted and one I will certainly look for again."
"There's no doubt that we have a fantastic stout on our hands. But it lacks the unity and seamlessness that we see from Old Rasputin and Sam Smith's Imperial Stout."
"D - Great example and individual take on a RIS. Great flavor, body and aroma. The appearance is just as expected from an RIS. This is my first taste of anything from this brewery, so I'm anxious to try more."
"D: I can't pound back stouts but this one I will end up sipping until the glass is empty. Definitely a keeper."
"Poured a pitch black...no color around the edges at all when held up to light. There is a small espresso-brown head on it that looks absolutely delicious. Very strong roasted/burnt smell with dark chocolates. The smell of chocolate is very abundant (overpowers all other smells). A nice coffee smell as well. The taste is very burnt...like burnt malts with an amazingly delicious coffee aftertaste. The initial taste is not as great as I was expecting (lacking that huge, thick imperial stout mouthfeel I love), but the aftertaste is a thing of beauty. The alcohol is definitely there when drinking this, even though it is not in the aroma. This beer is not as well-balanced as I was hoping it would be. Probably needs about 6 months to a year on this one."
"This is a really nice RIS. I like the smooth flavour profile with well balanced stout flavours."
"Drinkability: Well-balanced - nicely put-together. The flavors and aromas interact very well with one another. Not outstanding, but solid for the style."
"Not as difficult to drink as one might expect and fairly enjoyable."
"D-- Big and quite bold, but well balanced At first I thought pretty one dimensional but it had a lot going on with this as it got warmer and warmer. The 9% is there at about the halfway point of the first glass but it is quite drinkable. Hard to do more than one at 500 ML. A 330 could do 2. Excellent sipper for really cold nights. This will do quite well. Should be a good beer for cellaring and will improve more with time."
"Overall, this RIS from Nogne O is an excellent effort. I would gladly add more to the cellar next time I see some for sale. Great as an after dinner ""desert"" as well."
"D: Not overly boozy, necessarily, but a fairly pedestrian and one dimensional RIS."
"D - the bitter after taste and throat tingle soul keep me away from buying many of these."
"Nice RIS not the benchmark for the style but nice."
"d - A pretty solid RIS. An enjoyable dark fruit smell and taste and the ABV was well hidden despite being 9%. Would try again."
"Good black and red appearance, reminiscient of the Abyss. Not as thick. Aroma, licorice and dark chocolate seems to dominate. Hides the alcohol quite well. Not heavily hopped, not bitter. No massive shift throughout. Drinkable, but pricey."
"Mouthfeel - Medium/full bodied, smooth and creamy."
"Pretty solid Imperial. I've been wanting to try this for quite sometime now, but didn't want to pay over $10 for it. I finally found it, up in Blacksburg, VA for around $9. I figured why not, and I wasn't disappointed. Has a nice, thick, chocolatey/coffee smell, with a hint of fruit. Taste is somewhat similar, maybe with a tinge of alcohol in the finish. Overall though, the alcohol is hinden pretty good, so it could be a dangerous beer. Very good for cold nights, warm you up pretty good."
"Definitely a good imperial stout, has a little more uniqueness to it than a lot of the cookie cutter RIS', would try this one again..."
"D-this is a very solid RIS. Good tastes and solid flavors. Nothing huge but a nice job on all the flavors I like to see."
"Super drinkable, this is an amazingly good beer."
"D: this beer was awesome, but I cant say its worth the 14 dollars i paid for it. (Ginger man, new york) would i buy it again, absolutely at around 8 bucks"
"Gorgeous looking witha chocloate milkshake head atop the silky black body. A very chocolatey nose, with some extra hints of coffee and espresso. A bit awkward in the mouth. Grippy coffee almost tannic. Again a very chocolatey finish. Very low carbonation helps the silky feel. Pretty tasty."
"Overall, this is drinkable and at times even enjoyable; however, it lacks the nuance that would balance out the harsher aspects (e.g., the overwhelming level of bitterness and slight booziness). It doesn't compare to say, Green Flash's Double Stout, but I wouldn't shove this away if someone handed me a glass."
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"It pours as a thick, oily, viscous black with a creamy light brown head, and light carbonation. Lots of heavy roasted malts on the nose, strong gourmet coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight metallic hint. The taste is like liquid chocolate, bitter and dark with a hint of sweetness, sitting alongside heaps of strong coffee, and some sweet dark fruit, possibly raisins and dates. The feel is thick and heavy with velvety silikiness. This is a really fantastic beer, one of the better imperial stouts I have had."
"D. Very drinkable, though it seems alittle acidic and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, it's a very well balanced imperial stout, and would probably pair very well with some dark chocolates"
"I really like this RIS and it's a great first impression for this brewery. At 9% it's very drinkable. I've had more complex RISs but still liked this alot."
"Good beer, not huge and oily like Dark Lord, much easier to drink and yet still very complex and tasty. Great job!"
"Decent drinkability as it's not super thick or syrupy. Pretty good RIS, but not my favorite."
"A nice Euro example of style"
"Alcohol heat is barely noticeable, and body is medium to full, but weighs light on the stomach. Excellent RIS which presents it's own distinct qualities that help raise its stature."
"Not the most complex - somehow I expected more from such a high rep brewer. Still, can't fault it; a top RIS."
"D. I liked this but didn't love it it was simple and clean but not what i look for specifically in an russian imperial stout"
"D: A well done RIS. Maybe a tad more up front with the roasted malt than I prefer, but the alcohol is very well hidden and it drinks like something of substantially less ABV."
"Drinkability: A bit too bold for my taste buds. Such a strong flavor combination mixed with intense alcohol makes me glad my boyfriend only poured me a small glass!"
"Excellent RIS, one of my favorite and the first beer I've had from Nogne O. I've got their dark horizon still sitting in my cellar, now I'm really excited for it!"
"D - This is a solid, perfectly enjoyable stout. While it isn't too crazy, it does hit all the right marks. I can see it sitting well with many foods, as well as being really easy to drink by itself."
"The only detractor is a bit of alcohol on the tongue - otherwise, this a great seasonal sipper."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable beer, but I found it underwhelming."
"This is a good beer. Perhaps I shouldn't have said 'bland' which has some negative connotations...more like...smooth. Inoffensive. Solid. I don't know. It's good, & by bland I don't mean dull at all. Just smooth. Easy to drink. Not every beer has to be wild & crazy. Huh."
"This is an excellent stout, but not the complete package in an imperial world."
"Drinkability: A good sipper, but nothing mind blowing. With so many other great options out there, I probably won't be seeking this one out again."
"Overall, very impressed with this one, its on my list to get a few more and try cellaring it for a while."
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer, but not an excellent RIS. There are better beers in this style. I prefer a bigger mouthfeel, and more sweet over bitter. Its not cheap, and these 16.9 oz bottles from Norway are annoying."
"A very good beer. There are maybe a couple other RIAs I'd put ahead of this one, but only a couple. A bit on the smokey, drier side among RIAs. An easy sipper though and very filling. A must for RIA fans."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. This beer pours black as a shark's eye with a medium light brown head that diminshes slowly. Thick rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasted malt, oak, and bittersweet chocolate. Rich, smooth body with flavors of burnt malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Some hops and alcohol are present as well. The finish is roasty with a pleasant coffee aftertaste. Very good overall."
"Pretty damn drinkable for what it is. Intense, but very reasonable as a beer. One would want to have an argument with this beer, but it's just too reasonable and dammit, it makes too much sense. Just roll with it. It's right."
"A pretty damn good Imperial Stout. It really has all the classic characters that I love. While it doesn't break the mould in excitingly challenging ways, it does present a pretty extreme package, and it does provide a very good canonical exemplar of what Russian Imperial Stout should be."
"A fine beer and great example of both the style and of the awesome stuff coming out of Scandinavia. Certainly worth a buy."
"OVERALL: Great brew. Looked like a pot of black gold and the taste blew me away, especially given the weaker nose. One I thoroughly enjoyed and am definitely going to pick up again. Recommended."
"Highly, highly drinkable for the style, the overbearing chocolate/coffee flavors canceling out a lot of the bitterness and making it very smooth."
"mouthfeel is over-carbonated, but nice and thick. drinkability is good. overall, its okay."
"~ Purchased this 500 ml bottle from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. Pours pitch black with a nice creamy tan head. Aromas are of dark chocolate, roasted malts, hints of coffee, and some dark fruits. Taste is very similar to its smell. A heavy roasted flavor is followed by dark chocolates, coffee, and bitterness from the hops. The 9% ABV is well hidden, making this a smooth drinker. Overall, a well executed take on the style. ~"
"I've been waiting awhile for cooler weather to break this out, glad I did!"
"D - The drinkability of this beer is pretty high, this is a good Imperial Stout that delivers on the tastes you would expect from a big Stout, but a little pricey"
"d - easy to drink for sure. could go through quite a bit of this quickly."
"D = This one was kind of uneven. When not left sitting in the glass long enough it was hard to get down, but after breathing a bit, it turned into something that was not a greater drinker but would be a perfectly acceptable after dinner beer."
"The mouthfeel is quite good. Thick, warming alcohol, big foamy head. Very well done. The drinkability is good as well. I find this beer to be as drinkable as any other RIS (besides a few of my faves, which I could drink all night). Overall, this is my first beer from Norway and I have to say that I am impressed. Good job Nogne O."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, though I'm not so much a fan of the billowy carbonation as those with less and more rounded at that. The roast makes it less drinkable and with its sweetness there is enough astringency to make it a sipper. Not my favorite RIS, but an admirable brew."
"D- Drinkability is pretty good from an alcohol standpoint. However, the soy sauce flavor begins to stack up on the palate and can be slightly overpowering."
"D- Very drinkable for a non sweet version. Too sweet and sticky is a no go....Too soy and coffee is too wierd. This is a good balance."
"Fairly tasty beer, but seems out of balance, a lttle rough around the edges."
"I was really looking forward to Nogne's Imperial Stout, and bought two 500 ml bottles in anticipation. Poured a dark, dark, brown, brown (brown), with a medium head that faded slowly to a foamy skin. The aroma was coffee, chocolate and sweet. The taste was lightly coffee, lightly chocolate and lightly sweet. In other words, Nogne refused to make any kind of statement. The feel was medium bodied (light for an imperial stout, do I sense a pattern here!), with little carbonation. Drinkability was OK. Overall, it reminded me of Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast as a disappointment. Nogne wasn't as pretty, but tasted better. Bottom line...about the same in a very competitive group. Note: this may be the most oily beer I've ever had."
"Overall a good beer. Would drink again."
"This beer produces a jet,jet black colour with nice vivid carbonation that leaves a two finger frothy chocolate laced head with decent lacing,it has a really nice aroma of chocolate laced coffee with a subtle nice portish smell which lingers in the background very nice,it has a impressive full mouthfeel which coats the mouth with flavours of roasted toasty malts and a strong cappicino aftertaste which finishes a little bitter but perfectly balanced out a very nice beer that i could drink alot of very easy."
"One of the darkest heads you'll ever see, full brown of two fingers with sufficient larger bubbles to collapse it down to the surface in a minute or so, small streaks of lacing left behind. As the head might suggest, the liquid is pure jet black, fully opaque and devoid of any real color anywhere. The scents burst into your nose fast enough that it takes some time to separate them, more plum, cherry, black grape fruit scents than expected, palpable graininess as well, the hoppy bite there for sure, of course oodles of coffee bean, dark chocolate, mocha powder, fresh milk, shaved coconut, it's big enough that you can't differentiate between ""lift"" and ""cling"" in your nostrils. Full-bodied, however, lighter and more flowing based off the nose, the roast/toast factor much higher here which crispens things up. Dark chocolate, mocha, coffee, black licorice, on the dry side as a whole, dusty feel upon the tongue. The alcohol evident, on the boozy side. The grape, plum, blackberry fruit more in the background. The carbonation has a fat feel to it, adding creaminess to the texture. Very good, but, like an itch you can't scratch, there's something missing here to bring it all together."
"It pours thick and is basically opaque in a glass. This beer is exceptionally smooth with a perfect balance of slight hoppy bitterness and smokey roasted malts, ending with a nice chocolaty/coffee finish typical of your standard RIS. You can also get hints of anise, nuts, and fruit. But the mouthfeel/drinkability is what I love about this beer. Despite its ABV of 9%, the beer is straight up velvety goodness and goes down so easily that I think its exceptionally drinkable without being watered-down."
"Overall an exceptional example of the style, though a more perfect stout might go above and beyond by offering some estery notes and variations on roast level for the grains used. Still, this is probably the best Russian Imperial stout I've tried so far (haven't tried Kate the Great of The Abyss)..."
"Notes: This is a decent Russian Imperial Stout, but honestly, I was a bit let-down. The burnt malts combine with the hops to impart a bitterness that seems to muddle things up a bit for me, which results in the stout flavors not being able to shine as brightly as they could. In my opinion, it's definitely not worth the $8.39 that I paid for it, which was the fear that forced me to keep putting it off for so long. It's got potential, though. Maybe a year or two in a cellar would do it some good. As is, though, I'm unimpressed."
"Pours pitch black with very little head and no cover. Smell is roasted malts and some alcohol. Heavy roasted malt taste (delicious) with some coffee, unsweetened chocolate, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit lacking but nice finish and enjoyable. The alcohol is pretty masked in this one, making it very drinkable regardless of the 9%."
"Pours pitch black into my new Dogfish Head 25oz snifter with a small tan head, the head slowly fades into an unpredictable milky coating on the top of the beer, looks really cool actually, almost like when you first pour cream into coffee. No lacing is left on my glass at all as I finish the beer. Smells of roasted malts, roasted coffee, a bit of hop presence and an alcohol kick, which was strange considering the taste. Taste here is a very good example of a non-coffee explosion, non-chocolate filled imperial stout. You get a lot of roasted malts, a bit of hops which adds a nice element to it, some roasted coffee and some sweetness from the malts too, it all adds up to a very good taste. The mouthfeel here was a tiny bit thin for my preference on an imperial stout, other than that the roasted flavors coat the tongue very well leaving you with a nice aftertaste. Drinkability is good, I judge an imperial's drinkability by its taste mostly since they are very heavy beers, this one isn't overly filling and since its taste is very exemplary for a russian I will buy it when I see it and gain $$$."
"Overall: Wow. This beer is something else. They packed a lot of flavor into one little bottle. I like it, and intend to buy it again."
"D: Easily the best Norwegian beer I've ever had. Granted, it's the only Norwegian beer I've ever had, but it's fine on its own merits. Certainly worth a try if you're a stout lover."
"My bottle is 1.5 - 2 years old and it taste perfect!"
"D - Great beer, this goes down dangerously smooth."
"The body and balance of this stout matches the deep rich flavors. A winner."
"The beer pours the expected dark blackish brown color with OK head retention and lacing. The nose is pretty complex on this one (especially when compared side by side with a glass of 2007 Stone IRS), consisting of coffee, chocolate, licorice and nuts. Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, except the flavor profile is dominated by coffee and licorice. Mouthfeel is long and very smooth, with the alcohol fairly well disguised. However, the combination of licorice and alcohol is a bit much, and detracts somewhat from this beer's drinkability. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty decent beer."
"Pours jet black with over 2 fingers of billowing, long-lasting dark brown head. Aroma is complex with generous amounts of roasted grains, some dark fruit esters and some alcohol. The alcohol and esters become far more predominant as it warms. Taste is like the aroma where roasted grains dominate. There is some coffee, a good amount of dark chocolate and some slight burnt tones. There is a rather soft malt profile that hints at the substantial backbone it provides. The dark fruit esters are much less prevalent in the taste than in the aroma. There is a bitterness that serves as a good counterpoint to all the malt in this brew. Mouthfeel is pretty good with a full body, moderate carbonation and a velvety texture. Drinkability is quite good. Very enjoyable. I'm impressed."
"Drinkability: Balanced, nuanced, and highly drinkable. This is a bottle I would have no problem finishing, with so much flavor and a body that remains not too sticky or heavy. After only two Nøgne Ø beers, I'm a believer, and will be trying everything I can get my hands on. Now I just have to figure out how long I need to hold onto my #100 for..."

"Overall this is a solid version of this style and with a 9% Alc/vol it has very easy drinkability. I would definitely drink this beer again, but at 8 bucks a bottle I can think of some imperial stouts that are just as good for a better price (stone Russian imperial stout)."
"Holy moly, got to the bottom of the glass and there were small chunks of... yeast? chocolate? Tasted really good! Wow, that was a great finish. I'll have some more of that."
"poured into a Portsmouth balloon glass. pitch black with a tightly bubbled dark khaki head. Definite alcohol and coffee aroma. Taste is very roasted/toasted, coffee burnt imperial stout with a slight alcohol aftertaste. very smooth, mouth feel is pretty thick. slight head lasted through the entire beer. Carbonation is just perfect: it seems to come out in the head and leave the beer just right. very tasty, I would definitely drink again."
"Bottle Pours a thick motor oil like black with a good light brown head. The head is frothy and lasting. Laces fairly well. Has a good aroma of chocolate and some coffee. Aroma has a touch of alcohol. Has a good carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. The taste is well done. A great balance of sweetness and just enough hops to make it work well. Has a good chocolate coffee backbone to make this one work well. The alcohol is blended well with just a slight touch of burn. Has a full body. The texture is thick like syrup. Has a real good finish with a super good aftertaste. This is an awesome stout"
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an outstanding black and chocolate malt scent that's sweet smelling with a hint of roasted malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth black malt flavor. It's bone dry with a stiff earthy feel. It goes down easy with a bit of oatmeal mouthfeel. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an outstanding IS. I love the aroma of this beer. It screams chocolate, but the taste is all earthy patent malts."
"Aroma is rich and mouth-watering - ""stouty"" and smoky with strong tones of unsweet chocolate and fine coffee and a touch of miso. It pours an opaque sable that is just two cat whiskers above black with a very thick, dark tan head that hangs around for a bit. Rich flavor is what I expect of a stout, having strong tones of roast high-quality coffee and unsweetened chocolate, with just a whisper of molasses. Texture is very thick, sharp and fizzy. Worth seeking!"
"Overall a solid stout. It has a good taste but nothing outstanding here."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is creamy, rich and silky smooth. The body of the beer is thick chewy and dense. The finish is medium to medium full. This beer is wonderful. A rich full body beer with an all around flavor that meshes well. I am very happy I got to try it. The only thing I have to critic is, it doesn't have a strong bitterness from the hops."
"D - A nice beer but obviously not a sessioner."
"D - its a sipper and very delicious!"
"extremely smooth drinking for a ris. heavy body, nice carb. i very much like this beer in that it is a different take on a ris, definately worth checking out. now to go brew some imperial pale ale. piece."
"D: This is a fantastic example of a RIS. Very drinkable, though I doubt I could drink more than a couple in one sitting."
"Overall, I'm very impressed by this beer. I've been wanting to branch out a bit from American craft beers, and this is definitely a very good example of a top notch import. I will seek out this, and any other Nogne beers. If you're reading this, I suggest you do the same. Cheers."
"Cheers..."
"D: The stout is a rich nightcap, a warming behemoth that should leave me sleeping soundly."
"Poured this halfway up my beer tasting wine glass. Head was caramel, on the thin side and disappeared quickly. The color was an inky black. The smell is very interesting. Smoky, oakey, coffee, caramel, burnt chocolate, almost like a Rauchbier on crack! I had no idea what to expect after getting that whiff, very remarkable! The taste is much like the smell, heavy on the smoke sausage characteristic with licorice, dried fruit, and a coffee finish. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth. For a beer with this kind of flavor and complexity it is quite drinkable. I really like this beer, I suggest trying it if you want something suprising, different and tasty, give it a try."
"D: Not an impressive flavor, and at its $11 price, a poor value. I won't bother with this one again."
"Overall, this is a pretty good imperial stout. It has all the characteristics that would be expected and presents nicely and reasonably balanced, but some mild areas of improvement. It is very drinkable but it will beat your palate up like most imperials."
"This is my first beer from Nøgne Ø, and it is pretty good. Still, there are many other RIS that I'd prefer to this."
"Notes - As good as any RIS I've had. Like other Nogne O stuff the pricetag is a bit high, but it's worth it for an occasional treat."
"This beer pours an opaque black - not a hint of light is passing through this one! A one finger rocky head coats the top, nice head retention. Nice wispy lacing is left on the glass throughout. Nose is most predominantly of smokiness and roasted coffee and malts. Taste is excellent! As this beer warms, the flavoring becomes more pronounced - smokiness is the most detectable, followed by a dominant roasted coffee presence, touch of chocolate here, and finishes with a bit of a bite. This is a medium to heavier bodied beer, goes down nicely - touch creamy. You can feel the warmth of the alcohol, though it is not detectable in the taste. If it weren't for a 9% ABV, I would be perfectly content to sit with this one all night."
"I think I always passed up on Nøgne Ø brews because the label didn't catch my eye. But I've been taught a serious lesson. Don't judge a beer by the label;)"
"Pitch black in color in just about any light. Poured slightly thinner than other beers of the style. Significant deep brown coffee-like head that held most of the way through the beer. Drank slowly to see how the temperature affected the taste. Started around 50 and left it get up to about 60 by the end -- agree with other reviewers in that the 50 degree suggested temperature is too low. Tasted serious burnt notes and too strong fruit in the beginning. Mellowed out and blended much better as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel was a little thin but overall not bad. Aftertaste was a high note for me as with many of the better Imperial Stouts. Notes of dark fruit. Definitely worth trying -- good representation of the style, but a little rough around the edges."
"D - I am pretty happy sucking on this one."
"My first of the big nordic brews, a very tasty stout which is well balanced and would be a good beer to introduce someone to the world of big stouts."
"Medium body is well acrbonated, but a bit thin in the finish. A very nice, well balanced ale from Nogne."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Can not handle too much of it though."
"As to drinkability, the burnt barley makes this brew a bit rough, but that is in line with what the beer is trying to be, so I can't really fault it for that."
"Overall this is a good stout, the alcohol content is pretty high to have more then one though."
"Taste: Coffee and dark chocolate. The flavors are blended together really nicely."
"Taste is very good. This is a solid, well made stout. It just lacks the WOW! factor. Nothing there to seperate it from the field. A very good stout, just not a memorable one."
"D- Easy to drink and would enjoy this one again."
"Wow! Quite possibly one of the best looking beers I have even laid my eyes on. Hands down the best head I've seen and one of the better bodies. The head is dark brown, thick, and fluffy and hardly goes away, all the while leaving the thickest foam consistently down the sides of the glass. The aroma isn't very imperial to me at all. It smells more like just a nice big stout. I was hoping for more complexity in the smell. Some more chocolate, vanilla, and maybe a tad bit of alcohol. The taste is nice but also lacks some of the complexity that I believe an RIS should have. It has a nice roasty and burnt character with lots of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee. The mouthfeel really improves as the beer warms. Great beer...it's my first Nogne, and I've really enjoyed it."
"First imperial stout i've tried that smelled really aggressive with plenty of coffee and roasted malts but had a really pleasant, tho full-bodied, taste with a mild chocolatey end. Very nice stuff!"
"D - one of the first Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had and one of my favorites. I love the bitter, dry flavor of this, and even though there's a alcohol tinge going on, I would consider this more drinkable than some other lower ABV brews that don't quite mask the alcohol that well."
"D-Decent drinkability. It's got an abundance of charred character, which can detract from its smooth flavor at times, but overall was not a large detriment. The flavor of this brew was complete and tasty, very nice."
"Overall- The smell does not match the taste, I found it to be a little too bitter for my liking."
"D: quite drinkable given abv, though alky clearly present. Would order again but not as my first choice."
"Glad I was finally able to try a Norwegian beer!"
"D: I have just found (arguably) my most favorite imperial stout and it is from Norway. I love it! I am gonna have to try the other brews in the Nogne lineup, this is my first. My compliments to Nogne for a soild, wonderful brew...hot biscuits"
"D - Missing out on complexity I expect in an RIS. As a result, drinkability suffers. Don't think I'd look for another one. Perhaps I just had high expectation. Mouthfeel is great and the aroma was pleasant but taste disappointed."
"Alcohol is very well hidden in both the nose and mouth. Pleasurable to drink and rather easy as well."
"Drinkability: I can't tell if its the complexity or the unbalance of this beer, but it goes down pretty smooth, the alcohol is hidden well"
"Drinkability: I'd definitely have this again. It was very easy to drink - almost dangerously easy. Because it was so thin, and the alcohol was masked so well, I would not necessarily consider this a sipper. I enjoyed this beer."
"D - Yeah....I guess. Just not for me. At 9%, I will drink others before this one again. Impressed...Not at all!!"
"Nice job."
"One solid RIS coming from one of my favorite Scandanavian breweries (why don't they ship to D.C.?). Complex with good solid flavors. Recommended."
"9/4/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Fairly drinkable, alcohol warmth on tongue."
"Great beer for my first review!"
"Poured pretty much black with a lingering brown head. Coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol in the nose, but not overpowering. Roasted malt, bakers chocolate, slight coffee. Full bodied, oh yes. Bite at the finish with a little alcohol. Warms as it goes down, pretty excellent. Like the Nognes thus far."
"D- A nice drinkable stout that could get you into trouble because you'll drink it to fast."
"D:This is a really good beer. I don't remember what I paid and that is probably a good thing. The problem with the Scandinavian beers is the cost. I think they are making some amazing stuff but there are other excellent options closer to home. I would be proud if a local brewery made this beer though."
"Drinkability: Good. Slightly better than average RIS. However, there are better RIS' for the money."
"This is a tasty RIS, not overly complex, but good. I will be looking forward to my bottle of Dark Horizon 1.edition that I have waiting."
"A pleasant beer but a bit tame for a RIS, and not entirely worth the price tag."
"Very smooth in taste, regards of the noticeable alcohol. It is very dry upfront with lots of coffee and roasted/burnt malt flavors which lead to a center/ending ensemble of grapes and alcohol to finish. Very creamy mouthfeel, tons of bitter roasted malts and touches of chocolate as the beer warms. While not every flavoring is pleasing, its difficult not respect the complexity and palate play that goes with each sip."
"Eh, this was nice, but didn't quite live up to its potential. Burned flavor and dry finish ended up dominating this, I felt."
"Poured out into a pint glass. Dark nearly opaque black, with a small but tight light beige head. You can really see the legs on this one. Nose is bourbon and ethanol, with dark chocolate. Alcohol dominates the taste a bit too much, especially on warming. Roasted malts carry the middle. Pretty dry, but good mouthfeel. Overall a bit too alcoholic, and no really distinguishing features. Still a decent RIS, just less than I was expecting."
"Overall a nicely done RIS."
"Pours jet black with a small dark brown head. In the aroma, a mixture of roasty coffee and a hint of smokey pork. As in the taste, same as aroma with a small bitter end. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry smokey coffee aftertertaste. Not expecting the smoke, which was a nice touch. Quite big and quite nice."
"Drinkability, as with all NOGNE beers I've had is very high. This brewery is doing great things with great beers."
"We took the advice written on the bottle and tried this with some vanilla ice cream and it actually worked quite nicely by enhancing the beer's roasted flavors, I have enjoyed the various brews I have tasted from Nogne in Norway, would drink again even though it is a bit expensive, worth trying"
"Overall, this was a good, lighter RIS. Compared to others, this would not hold up, but it does well for what it is."
"Drinkability: A bit on the unbalanced side, but still quite tasty"
"D - Not balanced, but still good."
"hide in. A fine fine brew for a long cold night!"
"I have liked the other Nogne brews I have had in the past and this one was true to form as well.Poured into an imperial pint glass a jet black I mean no light showing through,a large two finger dark mocha colored head atop.Alot of complexities in the nose,heavily roasted with underlying smoke and wood,a hint of vanilla and leafy hp as well.Flavors are heavily roasted and quite bitter,a French roast coffee flaor dominates up front along with some real smokey flavors,some bitter chocolate and molasses comes through,finishing earthy,bitter and a little raw.There is some serious use of Columbus hops used in this impy stout,if you like a big stout with some rough edges you will love this,very nice."
"This beer pours in a thick black viscous way, with a modest light-brown head, and a dense body. The aroma has a lot of chocolate, some alcohol, and a strong graininess to it. The body is thick with chocolate, caramel, malty sweetness, and a generous bitterness as well. It is very good but there is also something acrid about it. I'd like to try it again and see if that same characteristic is still present."
"D- easy to finish the bottle. there are more intresting/more complex stouts out there, but this one keeps me pretty entertained. worth the cost (9$) and makes me wonder what else this brewery has to offer."
"Prosit, MK"
"Overall wow. This was a very tight and very good imperial stout. It was not as good as the dark horizon, but for a year round RIS, any friggin day of the week. I would go out and try this one if you havent. It was well worth it."
"D: This is a big, bad impy stout with a lot of flavors but maybe not quite balanced enough to crack the elite ranks. Nonetheless, highly recommended."
"The is a very mellow imperial stout. I don't know how I feel about aging this one, maybe 6 months could make it sweeter. This an easy going strong beer. All the basic elements of an imperial stout are there and there is nothing lacking. This is a great introduction to the style. It's not intimidating, like the Czar. Another success from a great brewery."
"Big, black, with a rather healthy tan head that just sticks around, nearly through the entire glass. Smell is good. Big roast scents are present, almost in an overwhelming way. Some good sweetness of chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is just as big on the roast character, if not more. Almost smokey, burnt tasting at times, which I'm not too fond of. Aside from that being at the forefront a little too often, this is solid. Again, the extreme roasty flavors in this brew take from the mouthfeel. It's not as rich or creamy because of this. Pretty drinkable overall and if not for the smoke this beer would be killer."
"D: This beer is easy to drink for 9% ABV. The feel is a bit thin, but flavors and aromas make up big time. The look is great. Like with all Impy Stouts, let this bitch warm up. The flavors come out a bit more, and round it out a bit more. The bitterness from the roasted malt settles a bit also with a little warmth. This is a nice beer and my brothers in Norway didn't let me down with a warming brew."
"D: Rough to drink today, maybe by buds are out of whack, but this bitterness is killer."
"Overall: not for me"
"Drinkablity: Very drinkable imperial stout that is complex and simple at the same time. I look forward to trying more brews from this brewery."
"Not a bad beer, but it didn't really grab my attention. Let's say that it's a very solid, slightly above average take on the style."
"All around an amazing beer."
"This is an interesting stout. I liked the fact that it wasn't very sweet, which is a nice change of pace for the style. I'm guessing this bottle must have been kind of old, judging by the sludge at the bottom. This didn't seem to hurt it any, aside from giving it an aesthetically displeasing pour. And maybe it was nothing and that's what it always looks like coming out, I don't know. Still, this is a good beer, and worth getting for any stout lover. Recommended."
"Flavors of bitter chocolate, coffees,vanillas, ,light hops, espresso, chocolates, bitter malted brown sugars. Remains light-medium mouthfell while retaining intensive mouthtfeel and flavors.or this style.] Nogne chose to throttle back on the ABV, so drinkability is stellar. Mouthfeel is perfeection fl Nogne-O is am intensive ""super"" brewery who can produce stellar examples of whatever-they-feel-like!!!"
"all in all i was impressed its a nice different take than what im used to but for 10 dollars a bottle not something id readily seek out again, definetly something you should try though"
"D - A great imperial stout, rich and flavorful; does not disappoint."
"D: Its been a while since I've reviewed or drank a RIS so its nice to start getting back in the style and this beer is a solid representation of that style, nothing in this beer is overstated, the smell is not overpowering the tasted is like a very robust stout, not like the ABV bombs I've had recently, so very very drinkable. But in the end this one does not blow me out of the water as some other stouts have."
"This is one outstanding Impy Stout from start to finish. Highly recommended."
"Class act. Pours an opaque darkness with better than a finger foamy dark tan head that resists fading. Spotty patterns of lacing in its wake. The smell isn't overly aggressive, but its rich with a barrel aged character. A combination vanilla-cherry Tootsie roll chocolate with tempered roasted malt note. Not sweet but rich and creamy. The mouth feel is medium-light bodied, primarily creamy and smooth with a tingle of alcohol. Full flavored, the taste matches the nose yet has a licorice aspect also. The barrel aged character lingers nicely. The 9% ABV warms gentle on the way. A real nice drinker; this one is going in the cart again on the next pass. Really glad to find it at Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. Bumping the 'drinkability' to increment the taste up half a notch."
"As pretty much every other review mentions, the first thing that will grab you about this Norweigan beer is its color: none more black. The mouthfeel and taste follow suit- its very thick and chewy and it has a rich dark taste, like dark choclate or black coffee. The flavor is very nice for an imperial stout, as some may totally overwhelm with the darkness and there does seem to be a nice balance in the hops to the obviously strong malt character. The thickness does, however, take a bit away from its drinkabaility, by the last few sips you almost cant imagine having much more. ITs basically like drinking a dessert. Not much noticeable to write about for the smell. In the end, it tastes good, and should be enjoyed whilst listening to Norweigan black metal. As desolate as the barren, snowy fields."
"Great stuff!"
"Drinkability: A great beer in a great looking bottle! I originally thought I was going to find a beer that would overload my senses with dark roasted flavors, but instead I find an equally balanced Imperial Stout. It was a very good beer, but due to the price, it's a once in a while treat."
"Overall impression: Wow. One fantastic RIS to be savored. I might get one to age as the hops are definitely forward here. Not out of style but with bottle conditioning, I'd love to see what this looks like in 6-12 months. A great stout to be savored."
"Great drinkability for a beer this big. Plenty roasty and such, and a real mouthful at times, but the drink finishes pretty clean with a nice dryness."
"After letting it warm a bit and becoming very accustomed to the strong flavor coating my mouth, it seems very slightly hop centered. To me, it would be even better if the hops were reduced VERY slightly - but I'm no hop head. After a year I think the reduction will be perfect."
"D: An excellent stout, and I'm certainly glad I picked up a couple of these on a roadtrip, as it's not available here (but certainly something to try to get carried). A gentle sipper, but each taste is exquisite enough that it seems wasteful to drink it too quickly. Recommended drinking, here."
"Further sips in and I notice a slight tartness coming from the hops and it does a nice job in complimenting the other flavours. And the 9%abv? I'm trying hard to find it but I can't say I can. It's *very* well hidden. The finish is really tasty with notes of bitter chocolate and a light hoppiness. This is a damn good example of the style and the next time I visit Colorado, I'm going to pick up some. It *is* that damn good, imho!"
"Imperial Stouts were for sippin', not drinkin'. But this one sure is! Full flavored, yet balanced to perfection with deceiving alcohol which slowly kicks in. It turned out to be money well spent for the half-liter bottle ($4.99), and the best beer I've had so far this year."
"I have added this beer to my top ten. It is like a orgasm in a glass."
"Drinkability - on the whole, too burned up for my tastes. I still enjoyed the beer, but find too much emphasis on the burnt grain."
"Pours darck chocolate brown with a small tan head. Beautiful aroma of chocolate, dark fruits, oat, and chocolate. Flavor the same, finishing with a combination of deep coffee bitterness and sweetness. Has nice complexity with notes of choclate, toffee, and wine. Very nice offering fron Nogne."
"True Norwegian Black Beer."
"Overall - An excellent Impy Stout and up with the best i've tried. Recommended..."
""
""
"A very good RIS, the only drawback is that it's a bit pricey. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, this brew Rocks! It's smooth appeal is what grab me from the beginning and open my palate to a wonderful unique session."
"Well, well worth a try. Highly recommended."
"Nøgne has a solid array of beers, and this is definitely one of them."
"Easy to drink. Great smell, excellent flavors and superb coating feel on the mouth. Not the best RIS but a damn fine one. Yum."
"Drinkability: This stout is very porter-like in that it's mainly roasty, with less chocolate and sweet flavors and at 9%, it's not the most quaffable beer in the world. It is good though."
"Sadly, not as complex as I had hoped. Still, a fine beer."
"Very different for the style, but enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend picking up a bottle."
"Drinks great for the style & ABV, great Imp stout, albeit a bit pricey at $9.50 for .5 liters"
"Poured into a true pint glass an nice black color, nice carbonation, a very nice two-finger creamy dark tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is big on malts/chocolate/coffee/toffee, some vanilla sweetness, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, big on the dark stuff, with some caramel malts. Medium body. Very drinkable, this one is a treat for sure, highly recommended."
"Pours pitch black with a sexy but very short lasting dark copper hue, I love the color. Subdued candied apples, marshmellows and a little bit of cinnamon that do work out of the glass. The taste literally is just like a smore, but not as agressive as you would think. Theres an elegance to all of this! The alcohol does show a little bit more than i would appreciate at mid-palate to finish, but not overwhelming whatsoever. An excellent beer, and fairly unique in style. These malt gnomes were rollin in a 1920 buick la cross doing work."
"Overall: Drinkable, fun, interesting, but it looks better than it tastes."
"D- Everything works really well here for a unique take on the style. I was really impressed with this beer. It made for a nice, slow drinking treat."
"Drinkability: Not too bad in the drinkability department. Pretty smooth. The nine percent ABV and huge bitterness take away from it a bit. Pretty good Stout overall."
"This is a very tasty, drinkable beer. It's 9% ABV is not at all noticeable. I could drink this all night. The only thing I would mention is that there is a TON of sediment at the bottom and not just yeasty sediment. It's gritty if you try to drink it, so be careful not to get that in the glass. That's the beer's biggest downside."
"Pours a beautiful opaque black with tons of medium brown head, dense and sticky. Aromas are quite unique for an RIS, more leaning on the dark toasty notes than roasty. However, there are notes of raisins, olives (strange but I get it), rubber, chocolate, and a bit of burnt esters (my imagination). The rubber could be a mix of medicinal/chemical like notes, perhaps thrown off by yeast or just the malt/hop combination. On the palate, this beer is THICK, mouth coating deliciousness. The use of wheat and oats has made is incredibly smooth and there's no roasted harshness but a noticeable hop bitterness. This reminds me a lot of Oat from ST. A slight vanilla, oaky, smoky oxidative note really brings complexity to this beer making it unique in a sea of RIS's that are all the same. Just a touch low on carbonation, but I prefer it to the overly carbonated American versions. Highly recommended, first from this brewery, and pysched that folks in Norway are brewing world class stuff."
"I had this in a tulip glass. It was a very dark brown, almost black, with a thick light brown head. The head dissipated quickly, but there was still a little bit of lacing. Primarily a coffee aroma, but also a bit of smoke and some chocolate. The taste was a lingering coffee and a tiny bit of chocolate. A little bit of bitterness at the end. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"the flavor is pretty smooth malty rich, with a little coffee and cocoa, bready, and some alcohol warming."
"Finish is quite long with chocolate and a suggestion of butterscotch."
"black with ruy highlights around the top edges. brown head that dissipates to a thin sheet after a minute or so and leaves a bit of lace as the beer dissapears. smell isn't super strong, but wood, coffee, chocolate, plum, and earth are all there. taste is where it really shows it's true color. i tasted everything that the nose suggested plus some lemon-limey hopness and a hint of warm in the finish. well balanced and flavors were for sure dancing as each one showed itself. a little on the thin side, but a wonderful, wonderful beer, and a must must must must try for all the imperial stout fans out there. up there with old rasputin, expedition etc."
"Served in my Brigand chalice. Poured opaque black with absolutely no light penetration. Half-inch coffee colored head with abundant ringlets that quickly subside into an oily slick. Sheets of watery lacing coat the sides of the glass during each sip. Aromas of malt, coffee and licorice. Taste similar to nose with the addition of dark chocolate and a mild oak character. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. A little subdued for an RIS, but very pleasant. Virtually no carbonation and a little bit of chalkiness at the finish. Drinkability is good. Alcohol is very well-hidden. This aspect, combined with a medium-bodied consistency make this a good choice if you're looking for an RIS that's a little less intense."
"Bought at South Bay Liquor. Poured from bottle into snifter. Extremely dark with a big brown head that dissipates into a thin layer of foam. Big aromas of chocolate and coffee, with a little toffee and alcohol underneath. Taste is big on coffee, which fades into a sweet, smoky flavor. Alcohol is well hidden with only a little warming at the end. Mouthfeel is creamy but slightly thin. I'm not a huge Imperial Stout guy, but this was pretty tasty and unique."
"This could be my new favorite stout."
"Dark black pour into a snifter. Smell is of rich roast malt, licorice and a hint of fruitiness and alcohol. Nice level of carbonation, a bit creamy and some ripe banana notes in the flavor. Some dry cocoa powder in the finish, and very characteristic of their beers. Some dark chocolate as well. If the alcohol was tamed just a touch, I'd like this quite a bit more, but as is, it is still a pretty nice Imperial Stout."
"Bottle: Pours pitch black with a brown, little and hort lasting head. Aroma of dark roasted malt. Lovely flavour of liqorice, black coffee, brown sugar, dark fruit and burned malt. Full bodied. Bitter, malty and alcoholic finish. A very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability was quite good, especially for a 9% ABV brew. This was a very flavorful yet relatively sessionable imperial stout. Just as the bottle stated, it paired perfectly with some dark chocolate. Definitely worth a try."
"D: A big disapointment. This beer is of course drinkable, but I had much higher hopes after all the hype. Nice to look at, but otherwise quite average."
"D: A nice RIS, very drinkable for the the ABV. A fruitier, sweeter RIS than what I'm used to & light bodied, but the flavors are definitely enjoyable & bold. Recommended."
"Alcohol is very hard to detect behind a rich conglomeration of ultra-rich, and super-thick flavors and aromas... Teriffic depiction of the style... Definitely recommended..."
"D - Highly drinkable for such a big beer, it hides its 9% well. While this didn't get me quite as excited as some of their other offerings, it is another solid, very well balanced beer from Nogne O."
"D: I couldn't have more than one, but one was very enjoyable!!!"
"Taste is very creamy, pretty much all cream taste at the beginning which slowly allows the roasted malt and chocolate to develop, very thick and chewy, has a slight warming sensation in the mouth near the end but it is not too strong to detract."
"D-I enjoyed it, but I'd like to try another bottle."
"D: incredibly drinkability, very smooth, and refined experience."
"D: I nailed a big guy by myself and wanted more. Very easy to drink and definitely reccomended. Something that I would want to use in place of guiness in food recipes granted it weren't so expensive haha."
"Nicely crafted Imperial Stout have had a few of these well worth it"
"I'd been noticing the nogne O bottles in the store for a while and finally got around to trying one. I don't regret it. I'll enjoy more of these, and would love to age one for a year or two as well. A truly fine example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Fantastic."
"Nogne has nailed an imperial stout. Bravo!"
"In a class with Bell's Expedition as one my favorite stouts. Complex, balanced, delicious."
"A good imported Imperial Stout. Not my favorite version; a little too slick and bitter, but good robust flavors."
"Not my favorite stout of all time or anything, but I actually liked this one more than I thought I would."
"Purchased: Liquid Solutions"
"Pours midnight black with a tan head that isn't very large and forms off a very firm pour. The nose is heavy. Almost like burnt wood with a bit of molasses mixed in. Just extremely robust and thick. Flavor is super smoke! Sheesh. Kind of like I swallowed a log used to cook some kind of intense BBQ. Whew. Feels almost thick enough to chew on wih a decent carbonation. Nice to drink. A winter sipper for sure. That smokey and molasses tone is fairly noticeable. Be prepared."
"Glad I split this bottle. It will be awhile before I revisit this brewery."
"What a way to start the day, and its all because of wickedpete, who sent this via a nice trade."
"The stout itself was dark as night. I immediately thought ""Stone Imperial Russian Stout"". Viscous as a motor oil with a slight cappuccino head, I immediately thought this foreboding libation would be conqueringly murderous. It was quite tame actually. A nice sweetness added to the dark malt texture and slight bitterness."
"The sediment is really loose, though. Pour carefully."
"Standard RIS body, nice jet black body with a dark mocha head. There isn't much in the aroma though. Roasted malt but not much else. The flavor is good though. Nice roasted character with some chocolate, especially in the aftertaste which is nice milk chocolate. I can taste a bit of alcohol also. Nice thick body with a creamy feel to it. Not a bad stout except the aroma is kind of empty. More drinkable than a lot of other heavy stouts."
"This was definitley a different was still really tasty and drinkable Imperial Stout. That citrus element threw me for a loops at first but the more I drank, the more I appreciated it. I look foward to more from these guys in the future."
"d: Glad to have tried it even if it's just to say I had an RIS from Norway. Overall, a fairly solid effort."
"An Imperial stout from Norway, should be interesting. Pours thick as used motor oil black with a massive 3 finger cocolate colored head that looks like you need a spoon to enjoy. Nose in laced with alchol covered toffee, and zesty smoked malts. Also a hint of spicey sweet cola. Enters the mouth very sweet and almost creamy smooth, but alightly thinner than expected. I should have probably let it warm a bit more. Does have nice flavors of toffee, molases, and a finish of very dark chocolate leading to a bitter mouthfeel that is long lasting on the tongue. Very nice like eating good dark chocolate. This is a sweet Impy. but nice bitter balance on the finish. Alchol is well hidden except for the belly feel. A great stout worth seeking out."
"As per the brewer notes, its inspired by the ballsy American styles, but still traditional, exactly as it is, a very finely tuned and thoroughly sophisticated Imperial Stout. So yes, very delicious, very much affordable, very much recommended."
"Very enjoyable stout that is ideal for sipping on a cool winter evening."
"Very dark brown body. Inky. Lacy, thickish, dark khaki brown head. Oily dark chocolate aromas. Black licorice, tobacco, plums, and dates. Roasted bitterness and peat bog. Taste starts with roasted coffee and scorched grains. Dark chocolate and sweetish dark fruits. Herbal bitter hop notes in the otherwise roasted coffee finish. Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Nice!"
"The taste is quite beefy as well, with notes of roasted, smoky malts, dark coffee, and oatmeal. The body is thick, smooth, and perfectly carbonated, with a bitter chocolate-coffee finish. This is definately a sipping beer, and one I'll probably enjoy again in the distant future."
"cheers."
"Pours an opaque black, thick tan head forms, leaves behind a nice lace ring, decent retention. Smell is chocolate, lots of nice roast, alcohol, coffee, cherry, toffee, very rich aroma. Taste is chocolate cake, milk, toffee, nice coffee roast bitterness, vanilla, alcohol, some nuts, very nice, very balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down. Nice imperial however middle of the pack for the high end RIS, but very well done. Thanks Jan!"
"Pours out a deep, opaque black with a thin but sustained toffee head. Leaves some nice, stretched out lacing. Chocolate comes out most in the forefront of the aroma with some underlying roasted smells underlying the bittersweet chocolate. Cherry and red currant accents are around as well. The hops have a pineyness to them. The chocolate is not as pronounced in the flavor, which focuses more on the roasted grain, piney hops, lactic acidity, and cherry. Flavors are good, but not as fleshed out as I'd like. Overall, quite light-bodied for what I was expecting. There's a long, lingering roasted flavor in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thinnish for a big stout like this. Carbonation is solid. Decent drinkability, but the acidity and relative thinness make this less than optimal for big drinking."
"D: Very complex all around and a top notch brew. I have a couple more bottles that I was planning on aging. Until I can secure more of this, I don't think I'll be /able/ to age any. A bit lighter than tradition RISs but the viscosity and mouthfeel help the drinkability in an extreme way."
"drinkability: good"
"M&D- A beers beer to say the least. Like they used to say, ""it'll put hair on you chest", damn, I'm a hairy bastard."
"This beer pours a jet black(As it should) with a medium brown head that quickly reduces to a ring around the glass. Smell is faint but small hints of smoke and molasses, and suprisingly I smell a little hop flavor. At first taste, dark spicy meat flavors overwhelm, smoked meat or salmon flavors abound and would be good dishes to snack on with this brew, mouthfeel is quite smooth as it goes down, thick and chewy as an imperial stout should be, and the smoke fades into espresso and coffee bean flavors in the finish. Quite good. a little bitterness on the aftertaste, but I like that. Its nice to taste a few hops in an Imperial stout. However, for 75 IBUs it is ridiculously smooth. This would be a good starter for those who have been turned off by Imperial stouts in the past, they are an acquired taste and this is a good one to try a few times to get used to it."
"Wow."
"This is a quality Impy Stout but there are better examples out there. It's definately worth a try and I'm sure I'll pick some more up in the future."
"Just as winter approaches, I find this nice Stout. Absolutely delicious. No born on date. The beer pours a thin head, not much retention either. Otherwise the beer is black. Totally and completely black. Even the bubbles have a dark tint. This is my kind of beer. The smell is thick with roasted malts and perhaps a hint of chocolate. The beer has a great smell and is pleasing to my nose. The taste matches the smell, the chocolate is even more powerful. The label on the bottle recommends several deserts with the beer, and I feel these are fantastic suggestions. The aftertaste finds the presence of the roasted barley, and even a healthy dose of hopes. This is a very thick beer, and for many people this will take away from its drink ability. One does want to treat this beer gently, because it is rather strong, but if I had to drink this beer once a nightI would gladly take it."
"D - A decent brew, one was fullfilling."
"D: This is a massively drinkable beer even though one should be enough to satisfy the stomach as well as get you slightly inebriated."
"A pitch-black, viscous, chewy stout. Pours with moderate head, almost as dark as the body. Head retention is fair. The nose is very burnt and sugary - it smells like espresso with a few teaspoons of sugar in it. Molasses, dark chocolate and burnt toast are prevalent in the taste. Incredibly thick and heavy on the palate; I've tasted 12% stouts that felt lighter. This is a good brew - recommended if it can be found for a reasonable price."
"A damn fine Imperial Stout."
"A very good beer, which is more complex in its range of flavors than other Imperial Stouts I've had recently. Despite this, I wouldn't call it one of the best beers of the style."
"Man this is just exceptional! Poured with a very dark almost purple head and lots of lace that lasted. Opaque. Very dark malts with roastiness and hints of dark ripe fruit, some spice, no hop. Good burps. Not too fruity like some are. This is very well balanced for such an extreme beer, almost a session beer. Maybe for freaks."
"It's too bad that Nogne Imperial Stout doesn't come in bigger bottles because this one is nearly gone and I haven't had my fill yet. Nogne is one of my favorite non-U.S. breweries because they're so consistent, right across the style board. It's a shame their beer isn't more widely available. If I had access, I would single-handedly keep the export side of their business profitable."
"I could see having a bunch of these after cross country skiing or snow shoeing the big hills of anywhere. Norway representin' y'all!"
"Great beer! I imagine this would be great during the Norwegian winter. I will be searching out more of their brews."
"Pours black as tar with a sticky brown head. Gooey yeast sticks in the bottle. Laces hugely. Smells like coffee, fudge, burnt malt, and warm brandy. Taste is rummy, dark chocolate and plums with hints of coffee, charcoal and vanilla. Quite complex, without being challenging. A very tasty example of the style, that trends towards an Imperial Baltic Porter (because it's got such a fruity character). Mouthfeel thick and velvety, just as it should be. A good one overall that drinks well and doesn't disappoint."
"Really like this one and hoping to try other styles from the brewery."
"Poured into Pizza Port real ale 04 glass from16.9 oz bottle from Ports bottle shop. Poured like spent motor oil black as night with big thick mocha head. Smell rich roasted coffee, herbal black licorous aromas with grassy anise. Taste resinous espersso, dark bitter chocolate with an astringent finish. Mouth feel has an oily feel chewy with an alcoholic warmth. Great IRS, I have drank a lot of IRS and this one is worth trying but pricey at 8.00 a bottle."
"Overall- Looks and smells great, even the first initial sip is nice but Burnt rubber dominates. YUK!"
"Pours a dark, rich black color with a creamy and bubbly chocolate milk color head. Head builds up to a massive 2inch thick, then dies down to leave lacing along the side. Every swirl of the drink produces another rich layer of this head. Smell is of licorice, smoky, and toasted malt. Taste is of black licorice, cocoa, whiskey barrel, chard smoke. Mouthfeeling is so creamy and smooth it feels like silk for your mouth."
"it's a bitter and not overwhelmingly big-feeling beer. not massively thick (though not exactly watery). roasty, but not cloying. full of earthy hop flavor, as well. it brings a bit of blackcurrant with it. it's a bit more drinkable than many of its brethren. it's a nice-drinking impy; i'd love to try it on cask"
"16.9 oz bottle. A: Thick as oil, opaque black with a chocolate head that goes away very quickly. S: Chocolate and roasted malts with a lot of boozey spice. T: Raisins, chocolate, alcohol is apparrent but not overwhelming; coffee and caramel as I continue the glass. M: Thick and sticky. D: Very easy to drink, a really clean and nice Imperial Stout. A solid brew."
"D - A big Imp. Stout at 9% and a well balanced one. Quite drinkable, smooth and focused w/out much viscosity or overbearing roastiness it retains a smooth stout-like body. The hops are balanced well with the malty essence of this big dark ale."
"Drinkability- One of the better RIS brews out there, no matter what country you are in. Just damn well balanced and easy to drink."
"Cheers"
"Pours a dark brown probably black leaving a thick brown head. The body is syrupy and clings to the glass. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, vanilla, earthy hops, herbal in nature. The taste is dry, espresso, dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, dark, sweet and delicious. This finsih is on the dry side, leaving an espresso, chocolate after taste. I'm looking to try more from this brewery."
"Nogne O Imperial Stout pours opaque, jet black with a head that's the same color as chocolate milk from a brown half liter bottle. Roasted malt, chocolate and even some hops are noticeable in the aroma. The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I would like (though it's not actually thin), however, the flavor is excellent. Roasted malt provides nice chocolate notes, some coffee is lurking in the background. Hops get stronger as the beer warms, kind of a western U.S. type of hop. Alcohol is a bit noticeable, but not excessively for the style. Recommended."
"Pretty smooth, good carbonation but the finish is kind of obnoxious in its bitterness. Pretty good offering from Nøgne, cool to try a Norwegian beer."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Bottle. Aroma fresh with roasted cocoa and spicy earth tones. Ruby-brown cornered deep dark mahogany with no head. Strong juniper fusel flavor profile, with a multitude of floral embellishments, followed by a smack of woody coffee. Some rushes of sherry and tannins. Dries nicely. At first this was too much medicine and harsh biting cologne-like floral for me, but I warmed up to its unique spice and earth cast."
"The body is fairly big, though not as syrupy and oily as some of the bigger stouts. Creamy. Alcohol is very well hidden. Easy to drink for the style. Very good, and worth trying several times over. Once again, it's great to see something like this from outside of the US."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in the ""new"" Sam Adams Lager pint glass, the beer pours dark, dark brown (might as well be black) with an inch frothy brown head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit. The taste is very malty, mostly like roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate and also some cherries, licorice and vanilla in there too. There's also a hoppy, bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's creamy, smooth and a bit slick. All that makes this brew very easy to drink. At $6.50 a bottle it's not something I'd buy all the time, but it's a pretty good beer that I'd buy again and definitely recommend to others."
"Drinkability: All the flavors are lush and well-blended, what's not to love? A delightful, tasty Imperial Stout. So far, I'm diggin' all the Nøgne stuff."
"The beer is thick and black in the glass, with a thin head of brown cream and extra-sticky lacing. Aroma features big chocolate and coffee malts over very strong alcoholic raisin and rum notes. Some rough and grainy hop notes linger in the background and the alcohol vapors are nose-tingling strong. The booze is less immediate in the flavor. Piney hop notes make this almost an American-style RIS. The pine melds with rich coffee malts in the center. The finish is cocoa laced, with medium-dry hops and alcoholic dark fruit. The body is very rich and very creamy, perhaps from the included oat malt. The beer is nearly velvety and quite mouth-coating. Becomes ever-heavier as it warms; the alcohol presence mounting with each sip. An excellent RIS, though very heavy by the end."
"Pours black with an okay initial head. Almost opaque and thick and viscous. No real lacing. The smell is quite roasty with some cherry overtones. Vanilla and coffee in the finish. The taste is especially nice. Very deep notes of coffee, burnt caramel, chocolate, roasted grain and cream. Absolutely delicious. The mouthfeel is creamy and substantial, but not as special as the flavor. Deliciously drinkable.Best Norwegian beer I've had."
"Overall: Nogne did a nice job with this one. The bottle indicates that their mission is to make ales of personality and individuality by brewing with traditional styles, while using the boldness of American brewing as an inspiration. Well its safe to say they have succeeded. They have developed a unique RIS that any American brewer would be proud to call their own. If you see one on the shelf does yourself a favor and take it home. There are several different brews by Nogne on the shelves at my local beer stop and its safe to say some of them will have a new home on my next visit."
"Black beer with a brownish-tan ring of bubbles at the top. It smells like dark chocolate. I was a little skeptical at first but the first taste was damned good. Lots of roasted chocolate flavors with a little coffee-like bitterness at the end. Very thick beer, like oil coating your mouth. This one hits all the right notes as far as Im concerned. The only thing I didnt like was the price ($7.50 for 16oz) but it did travel a long way to get to Colorado."
"Basically it's a solid impy stout, but it's a little expensive for what you get. It has a rich roasted grain and sweet caramel aroma with a dry, bitter taste of semi-sweet chocolate and black grain. Looks great and drinks nicely, but for my money I'd probably go with a Middle Ages Dragonslayer or Smuttynose Imperial Stout."
"D: A likable RIS, excellent look & smell, good flavors (though a little harsh in the finish). This is a beer I'd certainly have again, though I must admit it was a little more expensive than most similarly sized bottles (I recall this sold for around $7). Cost isn't something I factor into my ""Drinkability"" score, but it might affect me choosing to by this again vs. another RIS I like as well with a lower price. Anyway, a pleasure to consume and recommend. Skål!"
"D: I need a drink of water after this beer. Thats an astringent brew. My world needs balance, and this beer is a bit too one sided for me. Still quite tasty though."
"Picked up in a 500 ml. Brown bottle from Green's, the Nøgne Ø Imperial Stout poured out dark brown, and sported a khaki head that was nicely proportioned. The sniff indicated that this was a roasty stout as aromas of coffee, burnt toast, and chicory crossed my nostrils. The taste confirmed the relatively dry nature of the beer, as there was little to no sweetness to counter the astringency and bitterness. The higher than typical carbonation was quite apparent in the taste as a lot of chocolate sparkled across the tongue. Hops presented themselves in a citric and spicy manner. The body felt light for the style, but I would call this a deliberately effect enhance drinkability. Although thin, this did not feel watered down, just very well attenuated. Not much evidence of the 9% ABV anywhere. One of the easiest Imperial Stout to put down."
"D: Alcohol is well hidden. Complex flavors meld perfectly and the sweetness of this brew make it fairly easy to drink. Recommended."
"Black beer. Thick and creamy brown head. Lasts a while and coats the walls of the glass in sheets. Love the nose. Anise and black licorice. Char and burnt malt. Tobacco juice. Dark chocolate and a little lactose too. Transfer the aroma qualities onto the palate and add some nice hop bitterness and you've got one helluva nice Imperial Stout. Chocolate takes more of a stand on the buds as well. And a nice roasted, char-like bitterness to complement the hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty luxurious. Silky and smooth. Slight hints of alcohol, but not much. (There shouldn't be at 7.5 a/v.) Body could use a boost. It hovers around medium, maybe a little better. Good looking, good smelling, good tasting. But for the style, it could use some more heft in a/v and body. (As you can see from my numbers, I'm not holding that against this beer much though.)"
"This beer was close to black with reddish brown edges and a fluffy, dark brown head. Good head retention and chunky lacing appeared. Rich, malty aroma with lots of caramel and milk chocolate, moderate roastiness, and a nice licorice character. Full bodied with a solid bitterness. Big malt flavour with caramel sweetness and roast up front, followed by cocoa and dark chocolate lingering in the finish. Anise was milder than in the aroma, but still remained in the forefront. Mild alcohol warmth. Moderate carbonation kept it from feeling heavy, fairly creamy. Overall, a pretty good stout. Full flavoured but still quite drinkable."
"Highly recommended. I'd always wanted to try this one, and am quite glad to have picked up a couple bottle at HiTime."
"Even Later: I described this to a friend as ""like drinking Tums."" I thought it was apt."
"Pours deep brown-black, with a good head. Aroma is surprisingly fruity, with subtle notes reminicent of mandarin, strawberry, and port wine. The latter carries over into the taste, which is nonetheless dominated by roasty, chocolatey flavors. Long, rewarding atertaste. An outstanding imperial stout."
"Wow I'll start with the fact that I think this is Nøgne's best beer as far as the ones I've had. Great smell just right on the money. With good taste nice malt and balance. Hops come out but don't dominate. Overall great. The only room for improvement in my mind is upping the ABV and it would be in a big competitor to the other big boys in the style."
"16.9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. As others have previously mentioned, the bottle reads it is 9% ABV as opposed to the listed amount. Pours a pitch black color with a tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and chewy. The taste is rather roasty with some dark malts, chocolate and coffee and a bitter finish. Overall, this is a very solid RIS that I certainly would not mind having agian."
"Mouth: Huge roast flavors balanced by heat and an almost floral fore flavor. Plums and grapes marry coffee and charcoal with some heat in the exhale and an espresso aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and very easy to drink. Works chilled on a hot day or room temp on a cold one. No alcohol flavor to expose the 9%, just the wee touch of heat that works well with this beer. Terrific!"
"Pours a five+ finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Totally black color. Licorice nose. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet licorice and hints of burnt coffee. Nice beefy imperial stout. Slight bitter finish. $8.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me. Label has ABV at 9%."
"Overall, this is a decent big impy stout. It's a little too much on the charred side for me."
"Beautiful black color with a very nice powdered cocoa looking head on top. Deep grainy and roasted aroma. Almost licorice like in spots. Deep, rich espresso flavor. Roasted grain and burnt toast. Somewhat metallic and ""ink"" tasting but in a great way. Very impressive. Nice, slcik and chewy mouthfeel-man get me a spoon! Just a killer, killer beer. My second offering from thses guys and who boy they kick ass. Great, great beer."
"Overall, a nice IS - although not overly complex. A nice finish to an eveining, although the sweetness and slightly syrupy body hinder the drinkability. Certailny woth a try, especially for fans of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head isn't going anywhere fast, with lingering dark brown lacing. Aroma is dark malts, maybe a whiff of anise, and some lightly fruity alcohol. Taste reflects the nose, with roasted coffee coming on, and a moderate bitterness that lasts at the end. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, but a tad prickly, maybe a bit overcarbonated for the style, and drinkability is nice. Another enjoyable offering here."
"Last Nogne we sampled the other night. Poured a deep pitchblack night color with a deep brown head and solid lacing on the glass. The nose threw off some distinct chocolate and roasted notes. The taste was sweet and had bitter chocolate tones as well. The body was very filling but pleasing at the same time."
"D: Would definitely have this again. Am curious as to what else this brewery has to offer. Back to Beertopia for some new beers..."
"Drinkability: Good, particularly after a long day like this one. I'd anticipated planning out my 300th review, picking something in advance, and all that, but after such a long day this did just as well."
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. Body is an inky black topped by a sizeable, creamy, deep tan head. Rich aroma of roasted malt, with a hint of lactose sweetness. Palate is rich, smooth, and slightly sweet. Roasted malt is the dominant flavor, accented by mocha, dark fruit, and a touch of licorice. Finish is mildly bitter, as a few hops come out at the very end. Body is thick, creamy, and slightly oily, making this beer a slow sipper. A pleasure to drink, especially in tandem with a slice of chocolate raspberry cake."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a very nice smooth carbonation that helps to give this a great drinkability."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Imperial pint glass and allowed to warm up for 15 minutes. Appears an opaque deep brown color with about an inch of thick dark tan foam. A thick layer of lacing coats the inside of the glass and doesn't budge. Awesome smokey nose. Aromas of dark chocolate, espresso beans, smoked and roasted grains, and black licorice. Taste is rather sweet at first, leading into strong mocha notes with a heavy lean towards dark roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa. This is followed by a light smokiness, a touch of alcohol, and a pleasant bitterness. This is a nice full bodied beer that reminds you that you are drinking something with some substance. Carbonation is in line with the style. A very rich and satisfying Imperial Stout, albeit a little pricey for a 500ml bottle, but certainly worth trying at least once."
"Yum. Quite a treat, this one, not too this, not too that...just right."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of black chocolate with subtle coffee notes was well balance and very enticing. Taste is a perfect balance between some black chocolate malt with a very subtle hint of sweetness and some subtle coffee. Creamy texture is incredible with a thick body à la Bells Expedition. No alcohol was detectable and carbonation was low. Definitely the best beer I have tasted from this brewer up to now."
"drinkability is great. very well balanced and quite tasty. very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: this is an awesome beer in my opinion, and depsite the alcohol tones this went down easy. I could have had a few bottles of this in a session. Find some of this and try it."
"I don't believe this is retired, it was readily found and delivered by Papsoe. A 500 ml. with very thick body and head, dark brown. Straightforward quality RIS, some chocolate and coffee, roast, but not too much of anything. Roast and anise aroma. Bittersweet chocolate mostly. A bit acidic in mouth like having unsweetened hot cocoa. Very nice."
"D: Very good drinkability with this one. This is one to be sipped upon and enjoyed for quite awhile. Make sure you end the evening with this one. Your tastebuds will be cashed!"
"D - Alright. It is very good, but ntohing amazing, definitely worth trying."
"This review goes out to my friend Daniel, from Norway. I didn't even know there was beer like this in Norway. Anyway, this was on tap last night at Amherst Brewing Company last night. It was poured into what looked like a tall curvy pilsner glass. It was completely black (black as Norway black metal), with not much head at all. Smell was incredibly rich, with loads of cocoa, coffee, and some peppery spice. Taste brought out some dark fruit characteristics reminiscent of plum and blueberry. This was a pretty damn big beer, and the alcohol really did sneak up on me. Either way though, I would love to try this again at some point. It is a shame that it is retired. Hopefully they will still have some of it lying around next time I journey over there. Bam!"
"The Nøgne Ø is a very enjoyable imperial stout that I found to very, very drinkable on this hallmark holiday that became a day off. A beer that you should seek out and stash away for a day to remember."
"a really nice RIS, not up there with the big guys (rogue, stone, rasputin) but pretty damn close. this is very drinkable. A nice RIS for RIS fans.. a definite recommend."
"Aroma is burnt malts and sweet fruit (very blueberry accented) that is highly concentrated. Deep black with a compact mocha head. Fore is fruit accented chocolate...rather like one of those fruit filled Cadbury Bars. Mild coffee...dark chocolate and ripe dark fruits last through all ranges...very different approach than the American Imperial stouts. I rather like the variation and that nearly blueberry fruitiness is a compliment to the base burnt dark malt and coffee flavors. very nice."
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of ""Venner av Nøgne Ø"". Like all NØ beers bottle conditioned. Pitch black colour, impenetrable for light. Large and thick brown head. Lovely aroma with vinous qualities, also notes of Colombian coffee, liquorice, chocolate and dark dried fruits. Flavour is dominated by strong notes of bitter coffee, mixed with a substantial malty sweetness, hints of molasses. Also some acidic notes, Im not sure if they are wanted or not. Strong ""coffee"" bitterness in the long aftertaste."
