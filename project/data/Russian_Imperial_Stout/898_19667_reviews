"I usually am a fan of heavy Seas but not this one! Not a fan. Too bitter and thin and just not good flavor."
""
""
"Not a big stout drinker.  This beer is obviously really dark.  Has a genuine smell to it.  I've had worse beers in my life so this wasn't so bad for not being a stout drinker."
""
"Overall: for the price point, this is one of the best imperial stouts. Another hit from Heavy Seas – I’ll definitely add to my rotation of winter libations!"
""
""
"O: Not a bad Russian Imperial. I've had better."
""

"Great imperial stout. Big fan of the style. Very smoky / roasted flavor and very heavy overall as.a stout should be. Definitely not a session but perfect for cold winter days at home."
""
"Flavor reveals roast malt and coffee at the base, with a fairly sweet toasted, chocolatey malt backbone, finishing a touch bitter. There's a bit of an acrid character, which kills the goodness. Dark cherry emerges as it warms."
""
"Great stout from Heavy Seas! Lots of flavor, toasty, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of tobacco."
""
"Very smooth for an Imperial Stout."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 2/10/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light licorice, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light licorice, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial stout style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Overall:  This is a very solid, very well-made, English-style imperial stout.  Very nice, solid flavors of malt and molasses.  Very, very drinkable.  I’d certainly get it again!"
""
""
"Overall: Much better than I expected! Mixed sweet and bitter very nicely."
""
""
""
"Once again, I really like this beer, but perhaps just not the classification."
""

"Overall, I liked this, but I can't see a drastic difference between this style and any other stout, (Guinness Foreign Extra Stout seemed very similar to me)… I would definitely try this again and others from this type, as I like stouts in general.   First beer from Heavy Seas, seems like high quality, and I like the freshness label being easy to read."

"O: Relatively easy to drink and enjoyable with notes of both RIS and BSDA flavors/aromas. Alcohol is pretty well hidden though this one is more of a sipping beer."

"O: I think the alcohol could be hidden a little better at 8.2%. That is drowning out a little of the other flavors. I expected a little more vanilla or roasted malt flavors to accompany the light coffee taste. Overall this is a middle of the road beer. Would not seek it out - but would not turn it down either."

"Finishing with an oddly light sense of palatability, the luscious beer isn't exactly built for quick drinking but it's surly not indicative of imperial strength. Its understated simmering warmth cuts through the beer's sweetness and mild viscosity with a finish of smoky chocolate and grilled fruit."

"Heavy Seas makes some good beer, but I think they missed the mark with this one or Oskar Blues and Founders set the bar to high. Either way I hope Siren Noire treats me better. I have bottle waiting for me in the fridge."

"Pours a near black color with a slight, slight hue of red. Very little head to speak of; leaves a slight trace of lacing along the glass as you finish. The smell is strongest with hints of chocolate, coffee, raisins; the taste is very sweet, slightly grainy, typical carbonation for a stout with this high a ABV. Very sweet finish. Overall, a good imperial stout for the price."

"Heavy Seas never lets me down... unless I get an old batch of Hop3. This beer was exactly what I wanted at the time, a Malt bomb. I taste zero hops, and while that is normally a scary thing for me, it was actually quite nice. To call this an Impy Stout, is wrong IMO. Its more of a doppelbock. Reminded me of the malt character in Celebrator. Very caramely, very smooth, nice and chewy/thick. Hidden alcohol character could make you have a few too many before you realize it! Very little head, but thats how its sposed to be with impy stouts, which like I said, I dont think thats what they should call this. Its almost a brown in color, I expect a stout to be opaque and black. I could *almost* see through this one. All in all delicious caramel candy beer. If you want a malt bomb, get this one."

"Overall, it's a good beer and I'm glad I've got several more. Had I let the beer warm a bit, it may have scored higher because it was much better to finish with that it was at the start. It's easy to drink and while the alcohol tapers off with the warming of the beer, it makes for a nice warmer ."

"Had on cask at Heavy Seas tasting room. Poured well but with minimal head or lacing. But not unexpected with cask. However happily surprised that it did have a notable pleasant bntaural carbonation. Beer took off with rich aromas of nicely roasted malts; some dried fruit and smokiness, but just accents ...not dominant in any sense. Moved over into the taste very nicely. Here the dark malts let loose with hints of coffee, darker slightly bitter chocolate and the dried fruit aroma became a restrained sugariness more like molasses. The mouthfeel was ""spot on""...decadent, rich and medium/medium full body. Great sipper. I thought this was one of the better casked ales I have had. Would get in line for this one. Also, regular Peg Leg is good, but this is absolutely the only way to really enjoy this beer. Cask really elevated the beer to top flight."
"O: I'd have it again, but not my first choice. Solid, but back of the pack."

"Overall, a solid Impy stout -- tasty, somewhat nuanced, but not groundbreaking."
""
""
""
""

"This is overall very drinkable, although the appearance detracts from overall enjoyment."
""
""
""
"O-a good bottle. I remember more from having draft. Will update once I get a chance to try on tap."
""
"Would it be better if matured? I don't know and I won't find out because there are MUCH better offerings that I would spend my time on. Life is short and time is fleeting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great approachable and delicious RIS. The notes aren't too intense and with a bit of age the hops have died down and given way to a nice roasted backbone with some cocoa notes to boast."

"O - Vastly overlooked stout, good offering from Heavy Seas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent stout, though it is a bit hot and not as viscous as I'd like. I'm also beginning to realize I just don't like Heavy Seas' house yeast strain."

"The feel is as easy as a lager and at over 8 pct ABV this could be dangerous."
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer and I can see myself keeping it in stock for occasional drinking or an after work treat but I don't think I could drink it every day. The alcohol presence in this beer is very noticeable and may be a bit much for anyone new to stouts or even craft beer in general. I would recommend anyone to try this brew at least once."

"Mouth feel is depressingly thin for the style as well, medium bodied at best, not very creamy feeling; kind of slick and oily, low carbonation. No real alcohol presence, except for a very light warmth. This beer is listed as a Russian Imperial Stout, but it seems like anything but that to me. If anything, it reminds me more of a regular American Stout. It just doesn't have the robust flavors, aromas, or mouth feel you should expect from this style. It falls kind of flat and doesn't really give you anything that would make you come back for more. Thanks again to Jeff for sharing."

"The taste begins with many of the same roasted dark sensations as the nose but a little sweeter. It ends slightly dry with a bitterness that lingers. I think there was a good effort here but I don't think is quite met my expectations for an Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into stout glass. Pours dark oily brown, aggressive pour yields small dark brown head with big bubbles that dissipates rather quickly. Smell is burnt sugar, coffee and maybe a bit of chocolate, very clean smelling. Taste is coffee and bitter chocolate, sweet at first but drying to finish. Some delicate lacing sticks as it's drunk. Mouthfeel is smooth yet full, alcohol isn't noticeable. A solid RIS that I would pick up again."
""
""
"Overall: As for hoe the beer looked, pretty solid beer and happy that I let it warm up a bit too to bring out more qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer, a good solid chocolatey malty stout with just a little bit of alcohol but at 8% abv not bad at all. Would definitely buy it again."
""
""
"I poured this heavy duty black brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer looked like a stout and smelled like coffee. The beer was a little sweet tasting with a coffee hit and not too heavy on the chocolate side. Not a real HEAVY tasting beer but you knew it was there. I would buy this again for sure. Like to see it on tap!"
""
""
""
"I realize that I have been spoiled by some of the more ridiculous takes on the RIS style, but I am pretty certain this is the thinnest imperial stout I've ever had. It's not bad, I just think that it needs more of everything."
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol presence is well but not completely subdued. While you can't taste the alcohol very well it is noticeable in the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
"A sweet stout, lacking in much depth or robustness, though certainly tasty and easily drinkable. Sweet milk chocolate remains dominant, which transitions to a mild bitter coffee finish. It feels and drinks a great deal like a porter, rather than an imperial stout, which is a bit of a shame. Call this brew a porter and I'm right on board with it, but with an imperial stout I'm expecting a great deal more umph. Still, quite drinkable and the alcohol is well masked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice stout. The body isn't as full as I would like and it's a tad overcarbonated. The flavor is delicious; complex, deep, multi-layered. Though the overcabonation messes with the palate. Otherwise, this is a stout worth trying."
""
""
""
"Comments: Poor density for a stout with weak taste and head."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a decent beer, but not in the same class as many of the top RIS's available these days. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be seeking it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly a sipping beer, but is less suited to a long session with a book than others of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Thick and oily just like a stout should be a good sipper for a chilly night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was not impressed with this beer. It smells better than it tastes. There was a strong aftertaste that lingered long after each swallow. A bitter off-taste that is outside my list of taste adjectives. The beer had good promise when drinking until that aftertaste hit me. I drank from a bottle, like I always do, so I don;t even know or care what color it was or how much head it had. Overall, I liked this beer, but I was disappointed by the strange aftertaste. I could really feel the slightly stronger alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is somewhat unusual compared to other beers in the style because it lacks dryness and flavors of roasted malts and seems to be somewhat of a hybrid between a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and a Russian Imperial Stout. Nonetheless, it is relatively easy to drink and hides its alcohol very well."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep brown with amber hue and slight tan head. Smells of sweet chocolate roasted malt. Nice bitter aroma as well. Taste is a bit woody earthy boozey. Its slightly bitter but sweet. It has a nice smooth aged feel. Nice imperial stout especially for a year round and cheap 6er."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall good drinkable stout but nothing great. Just a tad above average. Nothinh 'Imperial' about it."
"Well I might have loved this had I not had an Old Raspy a few nights ago. As it is this is a pretty good imperial stout, but obviously not in Old Raspy's league. It pours up as black as ebony with no head to speak of and very little lacing. Smell is mostly coffee and alcohol. Taste is dark chocolate, coffee, some molasses, and alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is just average. Not great, not bad. Overall it's really pretty good, even if it's not the standard for this style."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty run of the mill imperial stout, but an enjoyable brew nonetheless. Try"
""

""
""

""
""
""

"Overall – Not a bad brew to give a try. It has some nice roasted flavors as well as a complementing sweet taste that create a rather pleasing taste. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a reluctant 1/16"" mocha head which faded fast. The body is dark as coffee. There's really very little smell, even as it fully warmed, just some roasted malt. The taste really isn't much different from the smell, subtle and mainly the roasted malt. The label says it's 8% alcohol but even that seems less. For a ""Russian Imperial Stout"" this beer really falls short. Don't go shipping this off to Russia, you might start a war."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good stout and pretty tasty, but I have had a lot of better stouts."
"Overall: a good beer but imperial stouts are usually flagship beers so often that although this is a good stout, it isnt great and doesnt stand up against the stiff competition of the genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall for both: Peg Leg was a little experiment, really. When I stashed one away, I forgot about it. When I saw it in a shop cooler recently, I remembered, picked up the fresh(er) one and dug out the one I put away. Final verdict: Peg Leg does not age so gracefully. There may be some who prefer it with age, but it really doesn't hold up. It doesn't do poorly (like thin out, sour, or oxidize repulsively), it just begins to de-evolve. It's still a nice little cheap Imperial Stout, either way."
""
"Heavy Seas has the decency to put this in six packs at a reasonable price. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Monde Market in Philadelphia."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O - An enjoyable RIS on the lower ABV side. Didn't blow me away but was enjoyable. The price was on the low side for the style; perhaps because it's pretty local. I'd have it again."
"O: I think its solid, but it just doesn't compare with the heavy hitters in the RIS world. On the plus side, it's a very good dessert beer to pair with some Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream. Probably the best value RIS on the market (less than $10 for a 6 pack), so I can't be too hard on it."
""
"M: Medium body with very little carbonation. The afterataste leaves much to be desired as this flavor complex finishes quick after sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very solid brew, but its lack of oomph in either flavor or scent makes a bit subdued compared to other I. Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One finger slow rising tan head, quick dissipation resulted in ring around edge of glass, dark brown opaque body no visible carbonation. Chocolate and vanilla dominate the nose, no roast, floral hops. Chocolate dominates the taste, some roast balancing the vanilla, hops subsumed. Mouthfeel medium, decent effervescence, a bit boozy for the ABV. Nothing to write home about, but glad I was able to try it."
"Was a nice dark coffee color with a brownish-white head. The head was minimal and had no noticeable lacing while drinking. Has a nice roasted malt and chocolate smell, which also comes through in the tasting. Mild bitterness that lingers somewhat toward the end. It had minimal carbonation. The alcohol content also stands out toward the end with the roasted malts."
""
""
"DRINKABILITY: Easy to drink but definitely a sipping beer. I'd only have a couple unless I had a designated driver close at hand. Decent value for the price but nothing outstanding. And that last phrase -- nothing outstanding -- pretty well captures this beer. It's an ordinary, standard imperial stout. Since there are so many others out there that are more memorable, I probably won't have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours pitch black with less than 1/2"" of head that drops quickly. I smell burnt coffee and dried prunes with a hint of alcohol too. This beer is sweet for a stout and has an acidic aftertaste that may be due to it's high gravity. I'd prefer this guy kept it's head longer to smooth out the feel. It seems a little thin to me. Imperial stouts are tough to brew and I think these guys can take this to a higher level if they want to. Locally at least, Heavy Seas is a nice go to brew. Cheers!"

"Pours a dark bloack with touches of foam. Some stickiness. Smells rich roasted, coffee notes. Taste is a full hearty dark chocolate malt with an undercurrent of dark fruits - plums and such. Constrained bitterness throughout, with moderate carbonation. Very good stout."
""
"I realize that I have been spoiled by some of the more ridiculous takes on the RIS style, but I am pretty certain this is the thinnest imperial stout I've ever had. It's not bad, I just think that it needs more of everything."
"Overall? I could drink Peg Leg all night. It's not too heavy to the point where it's syrupy sweet, it's crisp and just highly drinkable. Plus local beer gets priority in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brews this dark and this strong (ABV) could have a much richer flavour profile. It is almost like they started with a light lager and than added chocolate and coffee specialty grains untill it turned black."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very delicious beer that fits into the lower end of the RIS spectrum. It was a bit sweeter and lighter than I was expecting, but had a nice taste with a good dose of chocolate. As smooth and easy drinking as this beer was, it's one that I'd certainly like to try again."
"If this were marketed as a Baltic porter or London, milk, or sweet stout, I'd raise my marks for sure. As it is, though, it doesn't quite stack up to the bigger hitters in the league."
""
""
""

""

"Bottle shared at the December iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Looks the part, with a dark brown/black here and a team head, but the aroma and taste do not deliver. I’m having trouble detecting anything on the nose, toasty and chocolate-sweet I suppose. Same with the flavor. Goes down easy with a light moussey body but it isn’t satisfying."
"Overall the night of 3 heavy seas beers were nice, I knew they wouldn't disappoint."
""
"O- Good take on an imperial stout. Cannot beat the price and nice in a sixer."
"O: I really enjoyed this stout, my first beer from Heavy Seas. This RIS would make a great nightcap!"
""
"Like the on-tap version, this is not what I would call an imperial - too mild. However, it is still a tasty and interesting offering."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not very smooth. I'd have another, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a thick beige head and a good amount of lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, dark fruit and some chocolate. Medium, creamy body. Toasted, nutty malt, prunes, brown sugar and some chocolate fill the mouth. The finish is bitter-sweet, medium lasting. I find this brew too thing for IS."

"In the overall rating, I think that this beer is pretty easy to drink. It comes with a good price tag and it can be a good introduction to a Russian Imperial Stout."
""

""

"Most Heavy Seas are on the light side, but still retain the flavor. This is no exception. Will back again for more..."
""
""
""
""
"O- I love this one. because the company has focused on the malt rather than the hops it makes this one very drinkable. Have to force yourself to drink it slowly or that 8% can creep up on you. Great beer."
"O: Pretty good, but not my favorite stout. Not that interesting, but a pretty solid stout."
"Overall this beer is average to me at best. With other decent imperials in this low price range, I will probably not seek out this brew again. This is not to say that it's a bad beer, just not quite what I was looking for."
"O/D-Generic, but sometimes generic is not a bad thing. I wanted a few stouts to drink during a Sunday full of football. Far from great, but it will get the job done for today. $10 for a 6-pack is decent especially because six of this would get you going pretty good. Overall, solid. Won't complain."
"O - Easy to drink, but little too appreciate. In a word, mild. Missing more than just a leg. Although maybe I'm spoiled by the American versions and the other good brews in this style."
"O: Tastey and extremely drinkable. I enjoyed it, but this is nothing special."
"I give two Schlitz for year-old Peg Leg"
"84."
"Overall, it knocked my socks off. First stout that i've tried that i've liked. Definitely becoming a regular at my house."
"A really nice stout and a great beer for the money."
"M/O: Good bodied stout. Very strong and warming."
"Overall- Really impressed with this beer. CC did a great job, will def be buying it again. Cheers"
"O: Nice stout, but doesn't really seem too imperial"
"Pours a jet black w/ little head on the beer. Minimal carbonation or lacing on this beer. Definitely mediocre for the style. Nose is that of chocolate, some fruit, hops, and coffee. I could really use more malt on this beer- it really needs it. Taste is slightly better, but it doesn't have the full, velvety taste of the best RIS brews. Mouthfeel is a little flat, and somewhat dry. Overall, this was a disappointment- it doesn't live up to the other beers I've had from Clipper City. Probably won't look for this again."
"O: a great, easy to find, affordable and some brilliant undertones mixed with a well balanced core style."
"Overall it's a good drinkable beer, but doesn't seem to be a RIS. Too weak all around for an imperial stout."
"D- Intense flavors and high alcohol (both in terms of the taste and the effects) keep this one from being a super easy drinker but it sure is tasty and will bring me back again. Once again Heavy Seas comes through, not sure why they don't get more credit for their great beers from top to bottom."
"It's not bad, but it's just not doing anything for me. Very tame and I wanted something more audacious"
"O: In general I enjoy Clipper City's beer, especially the Loose Cannon. In general I enjoy imperial stouts. But this one just isn't doing it for me. Nothing bad about it, just very average."
"D - This one is a bit lacking in dark malt character for the style. It has a good dose of dark sugary complexity but only hint of chocolate and smoke with no real roast character. This leaves it a bit cloying despite the reasonably dry finish."
"Overall, this is a decent stout, but the flavors are lighter that would be expected for an Imperial. Still, the flavors are present in good quantities, and are finely nuanced; they simply lack the extra punch of a good Imperial. But because of this, the beer is a little more drinkable to newcomers, and so makes good introductory fare."
"This is still a drinkable beer, although not very style consistent. It would be more appropriate to be called a regular or American Stout, rather than Imperial. It's alcohol content isn't overly obvious, either - which is a surprise given the overall thinness of the beer otherwise. Further, it really doesn't have the strong flavors one expects in an Imperial. I would certainly drink this one again, but won't go out of my way to find it."
"HV"
"Overall - This would be a fine stout, not a r.i.s. Way to mild and watered down. Decent flavor but really lacking what all the other greats pack. Its ok, but i wouldnt recommend since theres tons of better beers of this style out there."
"12oz bottle. Part of the mix 12 pack. Best Before Date notched at Aug. Pours a dark brown color with an inch of tan, frothy head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, and some chocolate. Smells sweet. Taste is vanilla, light and sweet coffee, with hints of chocolate. Slightly bitter finish. A bit malty. Some dark fruit flavor as well. Nicely carbonated. Very little, if any, alcohol taste. As a beer in a mix pack it works, but I wouldn't buy it on its own. A decent enough RIS, however I can think of a bunch of other ones I'd rather buy."
"Overall enjoyable as it may be it's really not what I look for in the style. With little to no roast I will have to look elsewhere for an actual imperial stout."
"A lot of booze and sugar and not enough balance with the malt. The appearance and use of hops are the best part of this brew that isn't going to be sought out anytime soon..."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty average RIS that I wasn't that into. It looked pretty good but the aroma and taste were a little lackluster and the majority of the mouthfeel wasn't good. When I think of RIS's I think of a thick, roasty, and robust brew and this beer just didn't live up to that. It wasn't robust enough for an RIS and the watery mouthfeel didn't match up either, I find this beer to be closer to a normal stout then a RIS. The price of this beer was pretty good, but unfortunately everything else about this beer wasn't. I don't think I would buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody since it just doesn't do a good job at representing what an RIS is. This beer just didn't do it for me and i'll chalk it up as a disappointment."
"Solid all the way. Enjoyable and worth repeating."
"Overall - Not one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had but its still not a bad beer to sample. Its one of the easier I.S's to drink and might be good for a beginner B.A. but there are better I.S offerings out there."
"It's a decent brew but probably just average for the style. Very sweet and lacking the depth of the big boys."
"Not something I would buy again, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"O-Overall this is just OK. I was expecting much more from this one, especially since it is listed under the imperial stout style."
"This Imperial Stout poured out as a thin looking black liquid with a thin brown head on top. There wasn't much lacing at all here. The smell was of roasted malts and grains. The taste was bitter with some burnt flavors and a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel was just too watery for this to be an Imperial in my opinion. The beer is a decent one to try. But I just don't think it should be classified as an imperial stout."
"O- A pretty good brew. Slightly above average. Not one of Clipper City's best though. On a personal note, it is sort of filling. I don't think I could have more than 2 and still enjoy myself"
"Overall this beer is a little thin to be an RIS, at best I would say it is a good stout."
"Overall, I think this brew is quite underrated. Maybe it is the 1yr + of age on it. I havent had it fresh but I think its tasting mighty fine about now."
"M: Medium bodied, low carbonation, smooth and creamy."
"O: I wish this were better since it's local, but it was nothing special."
"Certainly nothing offensive about this, but it doesn't stand out in any particular way a"
"Opaque black in the glass, starts out with a finger of khaki head which falls to a thin film of bubbles on the top and around the rim of the beer. The smell of black coffee and dark chocolate with some toasted breads. Maybe a bit weak without the required dimension of a good imperial stout, more reminiscent of a classic dry or american stout. The taste follows the nose, with the chocolate and coffee really dominating beyond that there is a touch of dark fruit but not too much else. I find the hops to be a delicate addition rather than a major player. The note on the bottle says they are targeting the more British end of this style but it may fall short of that mark as well, using Sam Smith Imperial Stout as the benchmark. Mouthfeel may be on the thin side the finish is slightly sweet but too clean and overall the body is a bit on the light side. The alcohol is well masked for a beer of it's strength which does add to the drinkability. So I'm not entirely impressed overall, this is a very tough style as it is done so often and so well by a number of breweries that anything short of good doesn't seem to be worth one's time."
"O - While there's nothing wrong with this one in particular, it's just a typical, safe offering in a sea of much better Stouts. Heh, I made a nautical reference while reviewing a Heavy Seas beer."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"Pours out a brownish black body with a large tan head that goes away rather quickly. The retention is very good, but has ok lacing and moderate carbonation. The smell is a nice roasted coffee and dark chocolate along with more dark chocolate. The taste starts out with some creamy coffee followed by some dark chocolate and roasted malts. The back of the mouth has a little bitterness to it, but overall the taste is well balanced. the mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy and silky feel in the mouth. This is a really really great beer to enjoy. Doesn't seem to be as full bodied as other Imperial Stouts I have tried, but still satisfying after one, even though two is always nice when it comes to a great tasting beer.This is going on my must have stout list, and I recommend anyone that likes stouts or imperial stouts to try this."
"D - good flavor. Not a huge RIS but all the flavors blend well. Kind of an every day RIS. Easy to drink, and goes well with food without being too filling."
"overall, a decent beer, but it just doesn't match up to most of it's peers."
"RIS bill. Easy to drink. Good creamy chocolate. At 8% right in between styles. Good."
"Overall this is a good stout with a strong ABV. I wouldn't be putting down many of these back to back. I'd like to try this again in bottle form to seem if the taste was thrown off by the cask."
"Overall this isn't too bad but it has some things about it that don't quite appeal to me very much."
"My first time having a Clipper City brew. Pretty average looking. Typical near-black color with a foamy off-white head. Very little lacing. Smells very nice and roasty. Lots of roasted coffee aroma with a healthy dose of hops. Palate is balanced and delicious but rather mild for a RIS. Roasted malt flavors with a nice earthy hop flavor. Not a bit of alcohol in the mix. Mouthfeel is pretty fluid and rather thin. Overall this is a very good stout, just doesn't seem like a RIS."
"There isnt any carbonation on the mouth but a dry roasted feel and alcohol ends"
"Prost!!!"
"Middle of the pack Imperial Stout, maybe even better than I expected. Although I wouldn't really recommend it, but it's not bad at all."
"Pours clear black with a head that transitions from dark brown to almost white, but disappears as time progresses. Standard traditional porter smell with nothing that jumps out. Taste is what you would expect from a strong porter, nice toasty maltiness with a hint of chocolate and a satisfying lack of cliche Ameri-hops. Smooth beer, and easy to drink, especially with the balanced malt and easy carbonation."
"Don't buy this beer. It's a complete waste of time, and one of the worst attempts at an Imperial Stout that I've had in a long time."
"D: Nice beer. Nothing really stands out about it, but what you have here is a somewhat tame and well balanced imperial stout. Definitely a good value beer."
"Rather thin bodied for a RIS though I think the carbonation is at the right level. As far as how drinkable it is, this is a slow sipper and it's not all due to the fairly up front alcohol presence. The flavours don't seem to harmonize.."
"D - Great coffee-burnt malt taste; after a while you get a lingering licoric bitter taste which is actually very nice and unique; I liked this beer for a Russian Imperial Stout"
"This brew here is a great imperial stout. Pours a nice and rich dark chocolate color with a nice head retention and decent lacing down the sides of the glass. Overall it's very well balanced with toasted malts and coffee being the focus of this beer. Some hop bitterness fits right in with the malt flavors and just has slight hint of alcohol for an 8% ABV beer. I'm going to be buying this brew again for sure."
"Although this beer drinks like a full bodied beer it taste thin and watery. Also the alcohol is upfront and in your face masking alot of the beer flavor and washing it out."
"D: Thin body benefits drinkability; nothing too extreme about this one, just a solid beer. Not sure why it only has a B considering the average RIS rating here, but definitely a beer worth a try."
"Drinkability - I like this brew. Worth a try in my opinion. Perfect for the bitter cold. This is not fancy or exotic, but just a very solid, well made, easy drinking beer. One that I would happlily pick up or not deny if it was offered."
"Dark brown that appears black in the glass. One finger of head forms and settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Alcohol dominates the aroma to the point that I have to believe this is going to be very hot to drink. But the alcohol does not dominate the flavor. Instead the chocolate and coffee that is missed in the aroma comes through on the tongue. Just a little roasted bitterness is detected. A little alcohol warmth in the finish. The body does not seem to be at the Imperial level. Just to thin but it has a nice soft carbonation. A solid B level stout in the end."
"Overall, a decent Russian Imperial. Definitely not the best though."
"D-Goes down smooth and clean. A dessert beer but one that is not heavy so you can enjoy a few back to back. I had this at 55 degrees and think a warmer temperature would suit this beer better."
"My (probably) over-aggressive pour brought the head right up to the edge of the glass and I am sure that my Physics colleague would tell me that surface tension or some such was all that kept it from foaming over. It also set up what almost looked like a cascading action before settling into just over a finger of mocha-tan head with great retention. Color was an inky black with ZERO light penetration. It did not matter how I held this one up to the light, nothing was getting through. Nose was rich and roasty, like coffee and dark chocolate combined. The neck label mentioned ""... notes of coffee and dark chocolate"" also. I agree. Mouthfeel was smooth, not quite creamy, but very reminiscent of an N2 pour. The chocolatiness was prevalent on the tongue and in the mouth, but it was not as bitter as the nose led me to expect. Instead, it had a mild smokiness to it in combination with the chocolate. Finish was very smooth, initially with a dark chocolate flavor but giving 'way to a light roastiness. A very pleasant beer and one that would be excellent as a dessert beer."
"Tastes somewhere between a bitter stout and a sweet porter--overall has a very good taste and at $10.99 for a sixer you can't go wrong at all."
"D: This is tasty, relatively light, and quite drinkable."
"D - very tasty and drinkable ale."
"Nice stout...imperial I'm not sure about."
"Pours a deep dark black color with a thick brown russet head and tons of lacing. Smells of roasted malts, burnt brown sugar, smoke, coffee, and some chocolate. Tastes of roasted malts, burnt brown sugar, black coffee and a tiny amount of chocolate. Feels very thick and very nice with a mild carbonation. Pretty easy to drink."
"Picked this one up a while ago and kind of forgot I had. It's a few months past the brewery fresh date but no worries it's a big stout so maybe it helped. Pours black with red/ruby highlights around the edges. Has a one finger light tan head that goes away almost as soon as the pour is done. The smell was roasted malts, chocolate, almost a hint of some alcohol. These smells were pretty dominate, nothing else seemed to be there to me except maybe a very small hint of coffee. The taste was very sweet, mainly some roasted malts and chocolate. Like in the smell a small hint of alcohol. Didn't seem very complex but I think that's good. I don't know if it was so sweet because it sat so long or if it's like that fresh as well. Mouthfeel was slightly above average. Upon the pour it looked to be thin but it was actually a little thick which surprised me but it was nice. At 8% ABV there was only a slight hint of alcohol and in no way did it take away anything from the beer, very well hidden. Overall a pretty good beer. It might not contend with the big RIS' but it's definitely something I'd pick up again."
"Drinkability: not gonna knock you out.... a weaker IMPERIAL stout."
"D - Decent. This is the first Imperial Stout I would have no problem drinking from the bottle."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but thinner than most in this style. Carbonation was right on. Overall not bad. With the low abv I could drink a few of these. The price helps make it slightly higher in my book."
"I'm a bit disappointed by this beer. I've had some really enjoyable beers from Clipper City before, but this is probably the worst thing I've had from them. Just average all around, and it really tastes more like a stout than a Russian Imperial Stout."
"Conclusion: maybe I am still an amateur beer reviewer, but taking the science out, and throwing in the taste and enjoyment. Of a strong stout, this is wonderful. Oddly I will always have a flying dog gonzo imperial stout available as well. Enjoy and give this a try."
"Poured dark as night from a 12 oz bottle, ABV and freshness date on the label. Fairly thin head with little retention, laces though as you keep sipping. Aroma is predominantly roasted coffee and malt. Taste is also predominantly coffee with a hint of chocolate. The alcohol is noticeable as the beer warms up. Not as robust as I was expecting, but still a pretty solid Imperial stout. Pair it with a milk chocolate and the mouthfeel gets even better. Not as silky as I had envisioned it to be, but nevertheless doesn't disappoint. Definitely worth a try."
"Otherwise- if you're after a strong flavored juggernaut beer it's not this one."
"Thoroughly enjoyed."
"D-not real high, this is ok, but there are better options in this category"
"MF/D- Just a bit watery for an Imperial Stout, but it does coat the mouth nicely. Very drinkable in the fact that the abv doesn't show and, although weak, has some nice flavors."
"Decent, but not great."
"*Trader's Note: Thanks to my fellow OKBA russpowell for the opportunity!"
"D: It's a little sweet for my taste but it is very enjoyable in its own right."
"This is probably the worst beer Heavy Seas makes IMO. Seeing how this has a fairly low rating, I'm not surprised how much I didn't really like it. However, my review will most likely be significantly less than that, so I'll ahve to give this a try again when it's fresh. First drain pour in a while, I just can't."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is a lot of roasted malt as well as some chocolate and dark fruit. The flavor is big on the chocolate and roasted malt, but I also get a little bit of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, solid imperial stout."
"Drinkability is good and improves with consumption, just like it is expected from a pirate beer."
"This is a tasty brew, but too many will do you it for certain. Still, for an imperial stout the drinkability is decent."
"d- okay, not the worst beer but i thought it was a bit muted all around, wish it had a bit more of a kick."
"Overall, this was an ok Russian Imperial Stout. Can't say I was a fan of the smell it gave off, but the taste made up for that let down. I don't think I'll come back to this beer, but I wouldn't mind trying what else Clipper City offers."
"Served from firkin into a Heavy Seas imperial pint. This was the second glass poured off the firkin. Pour was pitch black with a tan two finger head that subsided slowly to one finger leaving a nice lacing as it went down. The brew maintained phenomonal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, subtle coffee bean, and cream. The flavor was of malt, coffee, caramel, with a subtle hop followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. Only downside was that it had a very light feel on the palate compared to what I would have expected. Definitely loved the firkin version however. This one was quite tasty and enjoyable for sure. This is a definite must try out of a cask or firkin."
"I was surprised by the alcohol on the nose, but it is not overwhelming in the taste. The first sip is greeted by a malty coffee taste which is followed by dry fruit and finishes with a slight dryness. It is somewhat lacking in body and not quite as powerful as I was expecting for a RIS, but a decent after dinner drink."
"O- Totally delicious, aged nicely."
"(D)- A fine stout with a smooth feel. If it was offered to me, I would not turn it down."
"Drinkability: High! Disappoints for an Imperial Stout... but it is perfectly chuggable."
"Drinkability: Meh. Not something I'll be seeking out again. I have actually enjoyed the other Heavy Seas offerings I've had thus far though, so I will continue to try other beers that they put out, just won't be going back to this one."
"You can taste the alcohol a bit, but for an imperial my first thought was that this tasted a little watered down compared to others I've had. It is easy to drink and I can't really say anything bad about it, but I can't say anything good either. It's a normal stout."
"D: You can taste the 8% ABV, but that wouldn't stop me from drinking a few of these. This beer is really good, and has a moderate drinkability."
"Taste is raisin/black cherry sweetness upfront dries up slightly in the middle but finishes sweeter with a good amount of roasted malt goodness."
"Watery, lightly effervescent, smooth. A light-to-medium body. Warming throat to stomach. Decent stuff but not great deal of complexity and little body."
"its goes down ok. kind of ""meh"" for a style that likes to bring in lots of robust flavors and textures. with the nuttiness and the rather light body, this would be a decent nut brown ale. falls a bit short overall, though."
"A nice stout that pours with a good flow. The deep smell is one of its best attributes. It had a nice lingering flavor that was very unique and worthy of exploring the other beers from this brewery. Overall, it was a good beer that fit our meal really well."
"This was one of the more interesting Heavy Seas beers I've tried, mainly for its complexity."
"12 ounce bottle pours into the snifter black as night with a small brown head that lasts about a minute. The nose is a let down. Rather than intense, big aromas of roastiness and chocolate, I mostly get alcohol and a whiff of something burned. The taste, however, is not bad, lots of roastiness and milk chocolate, dark chocolate and alcohol; it's a bit too sweet and milk stouty to be a good imperial. My overall impression is that this beer suffers from an overabundance of sugar and alcohol."
"A truly underrated brew in my opinion. An excellent, highly drinkable RIS, and another solid brew from Clipper City/Heavy Seas."
"D - Actually, this one is excellent for an imperial stout. The alcohol can creep on you, but I would easily drink 3 or 4 of these in a night... And I couldn't do that with most imperial stouts. That being said, I really don't think Peg Leg is a true imperial stout. However, this is a good beer overall and definitely recommended if you like dark beers. Also, it is decently priced."
"Incredibly smooth, rich roasted malt body, backed up by a bit of coffee and chocolate (both more smooth than bitter), with a somewhat bitter finish. Bottle fermentation provides a bit of extra tang from the yeast and carbonation. Mouthfeel is very smooth, but adds a bit of bitterness and bite at the end from all three primary components of the taste and the carbonation. Extremely drinkable, but almost not powerful enough for the heavy flavor."
"T- So intense. Sour, chocolate, but high in alcohol. Way too much alcohol. Tastes like a Scotch barrel aged beer. Sort of like an Innis and Ginn. Very acidic."
"Poured black into a sampling glass, with a very thin tan head, little retention, and decent lacing. Big coffee, mocha, cocoa powder, and dark chocolate hints in the nose. The taste immediately made me think of a mocha-cino; nicely-blended cocoa/chocolate and coffee, to a semi-sweet coffee finish. Full-bodied, modestly carbonated, and very smooth. Very tasty sipping brew."
"On cask at Sam's Quik Stop in Durham during a Heavy Seas tasting event served in a Heavy Seas curved pint glass a nice opaque black with a very frothy light tan head that lasts and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of roasted malts and mild coffee. The taste is a nice amount of smooth roasted malts with nice cocoa and coffee accents. The beer is very smooth and easy drinking from the cask conditioning. This is a beer very well suited for its cask, even enjoyable, almost quaffable, on a hot Summer afternoon."
"Overall, because a bit cloying at the end. Went down ok, but not great. Nothing off or ugly, just missing out."
"D - Pretty solid RIS, I'd drink it again without complaining but nothing that I would seek out. For the alcohol and style it's about average drinkability."
"Considering the style, this is pretty drinkable, but it lacks a ton of flavor that would make me want to keep coming back for more."
"Just as a by the by, this would be an A- in my book if it was released as a stout."
"D - A bit dull for an imperial stout, but the lightness of it and relatively lower ABV compared to other imperials make it more drinkable. I actually bought it to session with and drank 5 in a night and had a good night. Dunno if I'd get it again, since the decision to session with an imperial was weird in the first place, and if I'm not sessioning, well, there are just better imperials out there."
"Underrated. Majorly. They can slam a lot of flavor into a thin stout, the flavor doesn't match the feel, and it's the most refreshing and light stout I have ever had."
"D - For not being as complex, this RIS still has a great flavor with an equally great body to go with it. The abv is high as usual, but not high enough to keep from enjoying one or two throughout the night. Overall, not an amzing RIS but still great enough to keep me going back."
"D: Better drinkability than most Imp Stouts, but that's neither good nor bad since most really good stouts have less than stellar drinkability due to their heaviness. This one isn't as heavy as the really good ones. So it gets an extra half point in terms of drinkability. Other than an unusual alcohol prominent aroma, this one is decent, and worth a try."
"D - won't be buying unless running out of everything else."
"D - Not too drinkable. A little too strong to have too much."
"Overall: Overall, a good beer. Nice balance of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Has a great lingering flavor and packs a nice punch with the 8% ABV."
"D - Enjoyed one before I had to go but could have very well had another. Again, off cask I'm sure this beer changed shape quite a bit and made it a real pleasure."
"D - A good IS. I could easily drink one or two of these, but there are other IS that I would much rather buy than this one. Likely would not buy this again. Will be interesting to see how the 2 remaining bottles that I have age."
"mouthfeel creamy but also slightly sweet"
"Not the best RIS for a real afficianado of the style, but I think High Seas did a nice job creating an RIS for the masses."
"Pours a very dark brown colour with a light tan head. Small amount of lacing down the glass. It smells of coffee and roasted malt. The taste is a bit sour, which I didn't expect at all. It has the roasted malt flavour with coffee too. Fairly creamy mouthfeel. I think this is fine, I just don't think this is a great beer because of the sourness."
"Poured into my samuel smiths pint glass. Very dark color, almost black with a tan head. The head was about one inch and didnt leave a whole lot of lacing. The smell is very very very sweet, with dark chocolate, coffee, some fruitiness and slight alcohol. The taste is sweet but not nearly as sweet as the nose. The coffee and dark chocolate blend together well. Slight alcohol as it goes down, but not too overpowering. Very nice mouthfeel and drinkable. Not the best imperial stout ive had but nicely done and i'll definitely be buying this again."
"This is a good drinkable beer; not sure that its an RIS though. I would drink this beer again."
"Taste is overtly creamy, surprisingly so. Quite a bit sweet, and with a little bit of pear, maybe even a little bit of subtle citrus. Malty and full bodied, a little toasted, but not as much as I expected. Mouthfeel is so thick and creamy, almost like a dessert drink. Fairly easy to drink, but the fullness makes this very heavy. This sucker is pretty big and flavorful, but just doesn't have the balance and subtleties you'd hope for."
"Drinkability was slightly above average. The only thing this beer has going is the fact that the alcohol isn't very much present. Was looking forward to an Imperial Stout tonight and instead I got a weird lambic/fruit stout. Wouldnt buy this beer again"
"Picked this up for St. Patricks day, it wasn't quite what I had expected. It tastes ok, although not as strong a flavor as I would expect from an imperial stout. Smell is smoky and malty. Taste is kind of like chocolate and coffee with a chicory finish. Mouthfeel is kind of bubly, not any more alcohol burn then regular guiness extra stout. The taste is refreshing enough though to go back for more."
"Overall: A solid representative from Clipper City, or Heavy Seas as they are now moving towards. It is balanced well, has nice flavor, carbonation stops it from becoming food, and the alcohol level will keep you warm during the colder times of the year. With that said, there are some other imperial stouts out there that are better for the price."
"D: Very drinkable and will definitly seek this one out this week as I travel to Baltimore, Maybe a tour if I have enough time after working!"
"Pretty good stout."
"SkÅl!"
"Of the Heavy Seas lineup, this comes as a letdown. Malt flavors not nearly bold enough to satsify either the RIS category or carry the abv. Flavor profile is flat, one-dimensional, with hopping that falls short at the finish. Not on par with the brewer's other offerings."
"Pours a color somewhere between the darkest brown imaginable and a sun-kissed obsidian: not quite jet, but close. The head is only a creamy ring 'round the surface's edge and doesn't lace much at all. The smell is roasted with coffee, deep smoke, and...I'm not sure how else tp out it, so...roasted potatoes. The taste brings forth some dark malts, a good helping of rich coffee, some chocolate...no, make that chocolate-covered figs. (I've never had chocolate-covered figs, but the two flavors here are not as mutually exclusive as elsewhere.) The body is on the heavier side of medium, and is generally pretty smooth, but there is an off-putting bite of roasted carbonation at the end. Overall, somewhat drinkable, but not to much of a high degree."
"Drinkability: This drinks more like a milk stout than a RIS. I do not get a big jolt of coffee that I associate with the style. I was surprised by the 8% ABV which is well hidden. That being said, it is tasty and I will pick up more than a single next time."
"Mellow would be the word for this imperial stout. Solid and tasty but doesn't blow me away."
"D= a bit dry for more than a few but definitely worth a few. Excellent stuff."
"Overall, this is not a great representation of the style. It's an ok beer I guess... emphasis on ok."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light, this brew leans towards a regular stout in that respect. All in all, this RIS is about what I'd expect, given the price for the 12 pack high-ravity mixer."
"D: For the style, this is a watered down version of a Russian Imperial Stout. It doesn't have the big aroma, big flavors, and full bodied texture of some of it's counterparts. That said, I still found this enjoyable to drink. And for 8% ABV, I could easily drink a few of these."
"Drinkability: Simple, light and very drinkable but not in the style of an Imperial Stout. I enjoy that the higher alcohol content of this beer is masked relatively well and their attempt to create a Stout on the lighter side of this style. However, I don't know if lessening the body is necessarily the best way to go about developing this beer."
"D: I'm sorry, Heavy Seas, but this is the worst RIS I have ever had."
"Thin and off tasting. Perhaps a bad bottle? I don't know. What's up with the sour taste? Is this typical, or an off flavor? In a word, this one was disappointing. This westerner has had great fun and good luck trying new (to me) eastern brews, mainly New England, so I tried some without doing research. This is the second night in a row I have been very underwhelmed, which is rare (southamptom imp porter last night). I can recall having some good Clipper City previously, an IPA, I think, so I won't give up on them. But I won't be reaching for this one again anytime soon."
"Pretty weak for an imperial stout. More like a strong sweet stout, or foreign stout, maybe."
"This was my 125th beer reveiw. {Yaaaay]"
"It is an excellent stout and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Finish is sweet coffee character all around. A bit coffee soda like in many respects. Can't really see this one with any food. Just out of balance in all respects and too artificially sweet with no other redeeming characteristics."
"Conclusion: Too simple, and a bit sharp. Just kind of unsorted."
"as always...cheers!"
"D: Could drink this all night--in fact, I went and had this two nights in a row. I'm glad I came across it."
"Flavor has some roast and hop bitterness, but it's way too muted. A little bit vegetal (whole hop?) and astringent like a homebrew. Very thin for an imperial stout, it comes off more like a weak porter. Slight lactic creaminess that doesn't hold up without more body and carbonation. Definitely not a favorite, won't seek it out."
"Taste has an odd roasted malt/dark fruit presence, actually it seems like a bit of soy sauce was added to the bottle, not enough to take over the taste but just enough to ruin what might have been a good imperial stout."
"Pretty easy drinking and not bad if having a few but wouldn't be my choice when I'm in the mood for an imperial stout."
"I am not sure if I would buy this again, but I was not impressed by the overall package. If you like Russian imperial stouts, there are many better offerings. This beer only survives by its excellent drinkability, otherwise it is very average."
"D-Overall decent beer from a good brewery, you can share a couple with your friends."
"Drinkability: A kind of ho-hum stout. Nothing about it really stands out. Not bad, but certainly not great."
"Clipper City does make some great beers but this is not one of them."
"Drinkability is just ok. It goes down easy but there isn't any complexity to speak of in my opinion. That is my overall impression of it, its drinkable, but there is nothing here to make me want to have this brew again."
"Drinkability suffers tremendously. If your name is Oscar the Grouch, this may remind you of home. But anyone else should know - this is one to be avoided (on cask at the very least)."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A very solid stout. Highly drinkable for the ABV."
"D- The over-carbonation kills the drinkability for me. I have enjoyed this one bottle... and will continue to purchase for occasional enjoyment... but the over-carbonation will prevent this from being a regular beer in my fridge unless it is remedied."
"Poured black in color with the head being caramel in color. Had a nice one inch head, with big bubbles. Left some lacing with every swallow. Had a slight alcohol smell along with some caramel and roasted coffee. Tasted strong of coffee and caramel. I thought the carbonation was right. Didnt feel as thick as I thought it would. The higher alcohol content was evident when you felt that warming of the stomach. I couldnt drink this as a session beer (to strong). But a couple of these now and then would sure taste good."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack, served in a 12 oz tumbler. Poured out a pitch black color with a caramel head that quickly disappeared and some slight lacing. Smells of cocoa and coffee bean; molasses. This brew tastes like it smells too, with just a hit a black licorice to spice things up a bit. Medium in body, moderately carbonated, abv noticeable but without worry. Very drinkable beer for the style, though I can't see myself drinking more than two in a session. Comes recommended."
"Morey's Bottom Line: My least favorite as far as the Heavy Seas line-up is concerned. Not terrible by any means, but I think Clipper City could manage a better stout than this."
"Consumed: 11/12/2009"
"Notes: Probably the craft I´ve liked the least from Clipper City so far. It is not that bad, and might stand on its own if they chose to call it differently. As it is, it is a bizarre dark brew that is far from an Imperial Stout maybe closer to a dry, actually a sort of a sour, stout, but is not a bad beer either. However I doubt that I will give it another opportunity in the near future."
"The taste is really good, a solid RIS with the roasty toasty malts dominating the palate and a bit of a milky sweetness coming in at the end."
"Solid black with a light tan modest head and good lacing. The aroma brings a very pleasant chocolate malt with a whiff of charcoal/tobacco. The flavor is stick to your ribs chocolate raisin with lots of thick malt. I also pick up a slightly piney hop that provides a nice balance here. It's near full body but goes down smooth and easy drinking. Very nice."
"All in all I would drink it again. In fact Im going to do it right now."
"Overall, tasted more like a standard stout than an Imperial-very smooth and creamy but not very complex. Still, very enjoyable."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer. Its complexity is a joy to explore."
"Very dark brown in color, minimal head and lacing. Smell is a mild roast coffee and cocoa with some burnt notes to it. Taste follows the smell with the roasted coffe, cocoa and burnt flavors with some booze on the back end. Missing are the dark fruit notes i usually associate with a RIS. Medium bodied, less sticky than your typical RIS. Overall and ok beer, but not a very good interpretation of an RIS."
"D: For an imperial stout it is pretty easily drinkable."
"D- I could definitely have more than one of these, which is a lot to say for an RIS (could be positive or negative.)"
"Not a bad beer, but not a great one either. Very average."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is of caramel and malts. Taste malty and a little sweet, slight bitterness. Feels creamy in the mouth. Not really a beer I could drink to many of. Overall this is a fairly decent beer."
"Pretty darn good. Hides the abv well. Not the best RIS but considering the style, even a moderately good RIS is a fantastic beer to me, so I'd drink this again in a heart beat."
"I would of gladly had another if I had another to drink. Peg Leg is pretty drinkable for a Imperial Stout."
"Poured a very dark brown with a modest head that reduced rapidly to a collar. The aroma was coffee and a little chocolate. The taste was mild for a stout; not real sweet, burned (some call it roasted), coffee beans. Feel is heavy with medium carbonation. The drinkability is good for it's type."
"It's not the absolute best but it's one of the better imperial stouts out there."
"Good brew."
"This is a fairly standard russian stout, not the best but enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is downright thin for any style of imperial stout. It's a medium body at best but feels quite watery. Still, has a decent creaminess to it and is relatively smooth, but needs more body."
"In sum, the Peg Leg is decidedly a middle-of-the-road RIS - good, but does not attain greatness; pleasant flavors, but not overly complex.  Not bad by any stretch, but not really close to many other easily-attainable 12oz RIS offerings (i.e. Old Rasputin, Yeti, Expedition)."
"Overall, not bad. I would get this one again."
"A bit heavy on the head, and with too much sweetness lingering on the palate, making this not the greatest drinker; regardless, it is a mostly well-crafted Imperial Stout and quite tasty, if not quite as complex or delectable overall as some other examples of the style. Certainly a decent nightcap and dessert beer."
"D - easy to get through...lighter than average, but good as a summer RIS"
"This bottle was purchased past its freshness date, so I might owe this one another shot. My biggest beef with it was the heavy alcohol taste, and the aftertase of sliced black cherries on a piece of charred toast."
"Poured from a bottle with a freshness date of Aug 09', into a pint glass beer is a deep brown on the pour but appears jet black in the glass and has a milky, thick, cappuccino colored head. The nose is not overwhelming but is of roasty malt notes; bittersweet chocolate and lightly burnt coffee along with sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. The flavor is perfectly balanced, malty sweet yet not sickeningly so due to the appropriate balance of hops. The alcohol is only noticeable in a burning effect after a swig, but is not present in the taste at all. The mouthfeel is not quite as full as I had expected but the carbonation is right on at minimal. The beer has a dry finish due in part to the astringency of the darker malts and in part to the 8% ABV. Overall, decent drinkability but not one I could drink all night long. A straight forward but satisfying RIS."
"Drinks very smooth. Has a lighter body than most imperial stouts and the 8% isn't there in taste at all."
"Pours a black color with a smallish tan head that quickly settles into a light ring. The aroma is of roasted malt, peat, and charred wood. The taste is of roasted malt, some bitter chocolate and charred wood. The wood taste is a nice touch. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, a bit light for a RIS and not as smooth but the carbonation helps the drinkability. A fairly light RIS but easier to drink. I like the charred wood flavor but as a whole the flavors are subdued. Still a decent brew."
"This brew is good - not special by any means. Has a presence of alcohol in there that has been better masked by other breweries for this style. Has a nice roasted malt flavor - and is drinkable. Just not in the tops I have had for this style. Have a few and move to a different brew."
"D: Overall a good imperial stout and one that is pretty drinkable in spite of the abv, which does warm the belly, but can be deceptively easy to drink."
"smells like a standard mix of chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruit. tastes bitter chocolate with a weaker flavor of coffee and a hint of fruits. didn;t feel thick enough for me and wasn't that great to drink"
"CHEERS!!"
"Pours a seemingly thin dark brown. Thin head that leaves almost nil retention, some sloppy backwash-like lacing. Smell is faint malt, but it's almost devoid of any sort of smell at all. The taste and mouthfeel... this can't be an imperial stout, no way. It's very thin, lacks the body of even some regular dry stout's I've had. It's like I'm tasting a less flavorful version of something like Young's or Guiness (except without the rampant carbonation). Lots of coffee flavor, that much is apparent, but that's it. No roasty punch, or anything of the sort. Pretty weak and watered down in my opinion. Sure, it's drinkable, but that doesn't mean much. A huge letdown for me."
"Nice offering from Clipper City."
"A black pour with a thin coco colored head . Aroma of dark chocolate and coffee, and a hint of charcoal. Flavor is sweet and roasty, some chocolate,caramel coffee , darkfuits and maybe a hint of smoke ,. Body is a bit thin for and IMP Stout ,smooth mouthfeel , soft carbonation . A pretty good dinker and quite tasty overall."
"Pass on this one, there are much better RIS out there. Stick to the Clipper City Loose Cannon."
"D: Great drinkability. It's nice to see a local brewery near where I live producing something this world-class."
"D - Not terribly tasty, and high alcohol, but it's easy enough to drink one of. Wouldn't have another."
"Drinkability - a great fireside beer. Enjoy sipping this with some chocolate, some sliced strawberries, or just by itself."
"disappointing mouthfeel for the style. medium body, a little too much carbonation. definately not very meaty or chewy like the style suggests. no real offensive flavors going on, just lacks the the big flavors and big mouthfeel of a RIS. i was looking forward to trying this one as ive enjoyed most of the heavy seas beers in the past, and this is one of my favorite styles but this disappoints. this and the holy sheet belgian ale both kinda suck. but the winter storm and their ipa are some of my favorite beers."
"D- overall drinkability is fair, not a sipper like most RIS's, in fact, you'd prob. want to quaff this one quick as it is not a good RIS at all"
"Drinkability - Pretty good for an imperial stout, probably due to the fact that it has a light body."
"A pleasant beer to be sure, but there are far better RIS's to be had."
"i probably wouldn't buy this on a regular basis, but it comes with the heavy seas set that has some really good beers in it so, i guess as long as i can get the sampler, i guess i get the peg leg."
"Poured from the bottle in to my Portsmouth Tulip glass. Pours a very nice black color with avg head. Poured straight in to glass and formed a perfect head. The aroma was of roasted coffee, Dark Fruits, and chocolate. The taste was interesting as the stout was actually pretty light and not a heavy drink, which was weird for me. With the body style it felt more like a dark belgium style but with a strong coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit flavor. The carbonation to me was a bit muchfor this particular drink. As this drink was light for it's type but carried way more than needed carbonation. Drinkability would be lowerd some for the carbonation level. Still a good beer and would not turn it down in the future."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a deep dark brown color topper off by about a finger of lingering ecru foam. Smells and tastes of roasted grains, sweet malts, a touch of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder and a little bit of alcohol coming through as the beer warms. Medium in both body and carbonation. Worth a try if you see it around."
"Have had this beer many times on gas and was not all that impressed. On cask the beer is much, much better. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability- Pretty good for an Imperial Stout. After savoring three, however, I'm ready to switch to water."
"Drinkability: This is OK for drinkability but thin and it doesn't have the intensity of many imperial stouts. There are others I'd like to revisit much more, so I'll probably not go out of my way for this one in the future."
"Medium to full body, low carbonation level. Very smooth and creamy, actually quite easy to drink for an RIS."
"First impression was wonderful with smooth texture, good body and density, just a bit syrupy. Nice evenly balanced taste of sweet coffee, touch of bitter, sweet follow through ... almost like a dessert beer. Alcohol hardly noticeable, kudos for that. Low astringency. While this was certainly tasty, it didn't seem to have the stature I expected from an Imperial Stout, more like a porter really. In that respect, its' strength was its' weakness; tasty but not necessarily the stuff found in the King's Courtyard; with warming, it got a bit too sweet and syrupy. Heck, I enjoyed this and I'll pick up a bottle again in the future, but I can't say it's all that true to the style."
"Medium-full body. Very smooth and creamy. Lightly carbonated, which is appropriate. Pretty easy drinker for a big stout. Not bad. I'll keep an eye out for this on draft."
"D: Good for an after dinner stout or to down at the witching hour, but not the most well-crafted imperial stout I've had. Roasted flavors were a little weak and it seemed the focus was on the hopping and alcohol content."
"D: Not so much for me.. good, but if I was at a bar I would change it up, rather than get a second one.. I have seen this on the shelves a lot, but decided to try it this time.. I guess it was worth it, but I am not picking up a sixer."
"D. A good imperial stout lots of coffe and dark chocolate flavor"
"D'ability - Being on the low end of ABV for an Imp Stout, and tasting like a big stout rather than a cartoonish huge beer makes it eminently drinkable. Finds the sweet spot between big and flavorful and overpowering."
"Nice and easy drinker, but a weaker example for its' style. Can't beat the price - worth a try..."
"D - WIth no big flavor or creaminess, its easy to drink, maybe i will play beer pong with it."
"D- When warm I could of literally drank the entire beer with ease quickly, although I probably would of took a nap afterwards with the 8%. Not complex enough to be classified as a RIS and it's bordering on not being imperial in my mind but close enough. In fact this is a nice change of pace from the big daddy stouts I find myself drinking all to often."
"Solid stout, and seems to age well."
"Not my favorite stout and definitely not good if categorized as 'imperial' but it is very good if you are a regular beer/ale person and enjoy a mildly flavored drink."
"This isn't the biggest RIS. But it's a solid one. One of the few I'd drink more than one of in an evening."
"Feel and Drinkability: Low carbonation hurts this beer. I think that it should be a bit higher, it would help to offset the sweetness of this one, yet at the same time it would take away from the creamy milky feel I get here. The body on this is full yet it feels a bit thin all the same. Flavor is fairly long lasting, that malt sweetness being the dominant flavor in the aftertaste balanced by some bitterness from roasted grains and black malt. Coffee is there in the aftertaste as well to lend some balance. This is one I'd consider drinking again, yet I think I'll prolly be going for the Yeti in the future when it comes to these two. Feel is overall lacking, and I think it has something to do with the overtly sweet charcter of this beer, there's not enough roasted grain bitterness, the style should have more. At first I could find it, but after drinking Yeti, I can't even place it, that's how low in character that roasted grain and black malt bitterness is. Again I feel that there is some creamy milkiness in here, and yes it works well with the sweetness. However, I'm begining to find this one much more difficult to drink, it just doesn't hit me right."
"Pours out relatively thick with a deep black appearance with virtually no head and no lacing whatsoever. There is a bit of a brown-sugar colored crown, but that's it. Smell was of roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolates. Also a bit of an aromatic, almost fruity smell. Taste was very roasted, a bit of sweetness and booziness to it. Finishes off a little bitter from the dark chocolate. This beer was very smooth with not much carbonation. Had a medium body at best. It wasn't my favorite stout, but it is relatively drinkable even at 8% ABV. I hardly felt the alcohol after one."
"The fact that the write-up describes the beer as ""dangerously dark yet very drinkable"" reveals a lot about who this beer was intended for. The suggestion that a beer could actually be dark *and* enjoyable is presented as something untypical, shocking even (dark *yet* drinkable!). The word ""dangerously"" also implies that dark beer is something to be weary of. Clearly, this isn't intended for aficionados..."
"I wouldn't likely buy this again. It wasn't bad, just really not anything that would driver me here over some other readily available impys."
"Future outlook: For a beer this sweet, this was surprisingly enjoyable, and one that I look forward to purchasing again specifically for dessert pairings."
"Overall a nice offering from Clipper City, and I must say that I am looking forward to their other brews as soon as I can locate some!"
"Not bad, but a little sweeter than I'd like and the alcohol is not well integrated"
"D: Good, like I could have a couple. But this is an RIS, it shouldn't be this drinkable, and it is lacking in smell and taste, so minus points."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light for my taste. The light mouthfeel does make this a more drinkable beer and I may go grab another. In fact I think I will!"
"Seems rather uninspiring for an imperial stout. You could do worse but this really isn't special in any sense of the way."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent stout to just drink. Isn't overly special"
"D: Very drinkable. One of the most easily drinkable imperial stouts I've had."
"12 oz. bottle with two identical labels, conditioned, with June '08 notched; sampled a month before that. Brewed with English pale, crystal and chocolate malts, roasted barley, and hopped with Fuggles and Styrian Goldings. The beer is just about black, with an inch of fairly frothy head that eventually reduces to nothing, and leaves little lacing. Dark and sweet chocolate in the nose, with roasted and coffee notes, some earthiness, a touch of ethanol, and some slowly-emerging green hops. The flavor is almost identical, but with the addition of a medium bitterness. The body is dry and at times powdery, with lively carbonation and a medium finish. A very easy-to-drink imperial stout. Not a huge, over-the-top version, but solid."
"Creamy mouthfeel. Velvety smoothness coats the palate as this is sipped. Taste is pretty underwhelming. Comes across more like a regular stout rather than a RIS. Some hints of cocoa and coffee, finishes slightly tart. Very easy to drink. Nothing horrible about this beer, but nothing that spectacular either."
"It seems like more and more RIS' are going after who can get the most alcahol in there. Solvent and RIS do not go hand in hand and this is spot on for the style. Nothing amazing, but definatly a great RIS."
"Not a bad beer by any means, but unable to rise above the crowd."
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a two-finger tan head. The smell is mostly toasted malt with some coffee and chocolate characteristics. The taste starts off of with some bittersweet chocolate-tasting malt that's followed by a dark fruitiness that's cut with some coffee and bitterness that gives way to a little alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with some fine carbonation. This is a pretty heavy sitting beer, but I wouldn't expect anything else from a Russian Imperial. My socks weren't knocked off, but for the price I think it's definitely worth a try."
"Deep dark brown with a light tan head that dissapates quickly. Minimal lacing. Smells of cocoa, coffee, honey and chocolate malt. The flavor mirrors the aroma, nice and malty, chalky coffee notes dominate the flavor with honey and chocolate bringing up the rear. Mouthfeel is light for the style. Very drinkable and the alcohol is very well hidden, but like most reviewers I find it to taste more like a honey porter than an imperial stout and have graded it accordingly, it's decent but not for a RIS."
"Poured a dark black color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas chocolate, roasty, and lighter dark fruitiness. Tastes of chocolate, roast, fruity, and lighter coffee. I found the body to be a tad on the thinner side for an Imperial Stout."
"D - as an imperial stout, this was very weak. as a porter, it would be pretty good."
"Notes: Poured during the 3rd quarter of the Super Bowl. Ultimately I liked this beer, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Think of an American Double Stout crossed with a porter or maybe a bigger Brown Ale (like a DFH Indian Brown) and you get the picture. Too much fruit and not enough roasty, chocolatey goodness to think of this as a RIS. I went back and forth on whether to give this a 3.5 or 4.0 as far as the taste score, ended up giving the 3.5 b/c I don't think it comports with the style. . ."
"12 oz bottle. Poured nearly black, white head. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt aromas. Quite a bit of chocolate and some sweetness inside, some coffee, could have more roasted characteristics. Not much hop presence, a slight lingering burnt finish. Drinkability is fine. Overall enjoyable, but pretty basic."
"want to drink too many. The carbonation is a tad oppressive. A drinkable beer but not the best I've had."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent stout to just drink. Isn't overly special, but something that can be enjoyed in passing."
"Its not that I find this beer objectionable, but its really its inability to hide the alcohol flavor that I take issue with."
"Jet black, like a block of onyx, thin dark brown head, disappears rapidly but small bubbles continue to burst through to the surface, suggesting strong carbonation. Palpable coffee in the nose, however, roasted qualities canceled out some by rich grape, berry fruit scents, molasses glaze, not so expressive as to weigh the malts against the hops. Medium-bodied, fizzy so that things don't quite congeal. Thin flavor array, the coffee, cocoa powder notes dry, grape, raisin, fig, plum fruit flavors. Relatively low weight allows some hoppiness to come through. Unravels through the finish without much staying power. Not flawed, just plagued by lack of positive attributes."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, but if I want an Imperial stout, this won't be my first choice. It's a good bridge between a milk stout and an imperial stout."
"Definitely drinkable for an 8% RIS - if you're looking for something you can have a few of throughout an evening."
"D- Not too bad. I look forward to finding more brews from these guys"
"I love dark stouts and imperial stouts, though most i can only deal with their flavors and strength once a night. The drinkability, flavored notes, and tastiness of Peg Leg was more than enough that i could drink it all night long. The smooth coffee and chocolate flavors make this imperial stout one of my favorites."
"d: Not bad, just bland and uninteresting."
"D- easy enough to finish. wish i could drink a few more. a good RIS with a relatively low ABV for the style. its not often a beer with this kind of flavor is so close to sessionable."
"This review is dedicated to Officer McJerk who gave me a speeding ticket today in Wisconsin."
"D: It's easy to drink and enjoyable (as a Sweet/Milk or Cream Stout), but the overall package does not fit the Imperial Stout style. It seems severely undermalted and is a big disappointment from what is otherwise an exceptional line of brew from Clipper City with their Heavy Seas offerings."
"Deep cola in color with a single finger tan head that leaves a little lacing on its way down. The aroma is of toasted malts, bitter chocolate, and a hint of coffee. Initial taste yields a fair amount of ""roastiness", and an alcohol astringency. The other flavors found in the nose seem to fade in and out of the finish. Mouthfeel is thin for the style, struggling to keep medium body with little carbonation. Overall, it is not a terrible imperial stout, but the thinness of it just can't be overlooked. I might be persuaded to pick it up again for a change of pace, but certainly not any time soon."
"Overall- I was drawn by the fun label art and noticed it was the most reasonably priced Russian Imperial Stout in my local shop. Glad I gave it a shot and I would like to try other offerings from the brewery. However, this was a bit of a letdown."
"(rated Jul 26, 2007)"
"This is mostly an easy drinker. Although, this was quite dissapointing for a RIS, it was tough to get through the alcohol taste."
"D - Not my favorite stout...I had high hopes for this one...but it came up short...oh well"
"A ok beer, I wont be buying this one again would drink if it was given to me me or was someplace with a limited selection."
"Out of a bottle this brew was a proper, opaque black color with a two finger tan head. Good retention that lefty scattered but unimpressive lacing. The aroma was surprisingly sweet, caramel and toffee-like malt coupled with wheat bread and some citrus hops. The flavors were... unimpressive? For this brewery and this line of beer in this style? I was shocked. Again with the sweetness, chocolate and caramel but where was the bitter balance? No kick of coffee, no smokiness! The mouthfeel was a little watery for the style too and the carbonation insufficient. Previously I have liked everything in the Heavy Seas series and I always love Russian Imperial Stouts but this one just was not up to par."
"Pours a nice dark/black color with just a thin tan head, but there's a bit of lacing, too. Nice scent, but very undertones for an impy stout; it has more of a sweet/milk stout aroma with just an undertone of coffee. Nice taste, but again, it tastes more like a sweet/milk stout, there is very little burnt grain/coffee/chocolate flavor, although there is also no alcohol to burn the flavor, which is nice for an imperial. Goes down fine, not bad, not good, just a hint of roughness."
"this is interesting. cask pour. opaque, surprisingly foamy. lighter foam with bubble not that extremely tight. quite spotty with good retention. smell is cream... pineapple hint with apple malt tang. english sour. taste of very milky fruit... apple to chocolate covered banana finish smooth wood. quite nice. extremely smooth... would like to taste in a bottle to see if the flavor is as consistent. wonderful find at barcade... sorry i had the last two glasses of the cask."
"12oz bottle. Pours dark reddish brown with tan head. Aroma is mostly roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is roasted malt, chocoalate, caramel, and a little coffee. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finishes bitter with good chocolate flavors. Pretty enjoyable."
"3.7/5"
"Drinks okay, this didn't really excite me; just not enough depth of flavors here"
"I've had this brew a few times and it's alright but their are definitely better RIS's out there. If you're looking for something to warm you a bit on a cold winter night, this beer will suffice."
"Not one I would recommend. In short, it kind of sucks as an RIS. This tastes like Guinness Extra Stout with more alcohol burn."
"I bought this 12oz in Detroit several months ago, now trying it in a Slows pint glass. The appearance is dark as it should be, with a very wet looking dark tan head. The smell is roasted malts and a little chocolate. So far so good, but on tasting the first thing I noticed was this thin body which doesn't match a RIS category. Added to that is the fact that the flavors, while nice, are not nearly as rich as you'd hope. Actually this comes across somewhere between a porter and baltic porter. Very good as long as you don't expect a RIS."
"D: This is a solidly done beer, but not the best imperial stout I've ever had. Still, a drinkable brew."
"A pretty good RIS right here, I thought it was quite tasty. The first one I had was a bit harsh at first, but the second beer I tried from the 12'er was much more mellow. Very tasty and smoother than usual for the style, and maybe a bit lighter in body. A very good beer overall though...I enjoyed it."
"D: Note your normal RIS.... not as heavy as most... More of a summer RIS, worth a try.... I'd buy again..."
"Pours a semi-thick, extremely dark brown body that is cola-lika and forms a minimal head with no real lacings. Good malty smell; I picked up coffee malts, roasted malts, some cocoa and hints of dark fruits. Very smooth medium body and a little creamy, the beers passes over easily and has a simplistic but fine taste that mixes in sweet and dry malts for a good beer. If I am looking for an imp. stout I might pass on this b/c it is a little simple (read: weaker than a really strong imp. stout), but it tasted fine and they hid the ABV well; a really good drink."
"As an imperial stout, this isn't very representative of the style. It's rather mild for that, but overall, it's an excellent, very enjoyable beer. It's not rich beyond compare, but it is well-balanced, smooth, easy to drink and full flavored. I would certainly buy this one again."
"Medium-dark brown body. Half finger of dense light cocoa brown head. Good lacing. Strong chocolate aromas. Dark chocolate. Earthy and peaty with some coffee notes. Hint of vanilla and dark fruits. Taste starts with flinty, earthy dark chocolate notes. Some lacto-milk-stout sweetness mixes with faint Tootsie Roll. Hint of vanilla bean comes on with a little roasted peat and coffee. Some dark fruity sweetness in the finish and lingering dark chocolate bitterness. Medium body drinks a little light for the style. Not bad!"
"D: Very drinkable beer, didn't realize it was this heavy of a beer when I was drinking it."
"Overall, this is a decent RIS. I have had way better. Many better in fact. But for any ordinary RIS, this is not bad."
"It was relatively drinkable, but disappointing as an Imperial Stout."
"The flavor of this beer is good but is certainly not the best imperial stout I've had."
"Overall this is a good RIS, but the roasted malts overtake everything else. If it were a little more balanced it could be better. However, it's still worth a shot."
" Great full bodied mouth feel with a tickle of alcohol on the finish. Not over bitter with excellent balance and drinkability for such of heavy beer."
"Having two this evening, second is going down much slower."
"pours out a black beer with a tan one finger head. Smells of coffee with very subtle hints of chocolate. Extremely rich taste,,very much like coffee,,it a very dominant taste,,which is fine i like it. Alcohol shows its presence mid sip but is expected at 8 % and fits in well. A pretty good Impy. Mouthfeel is semi creamy not thick but not watery either."
"overall, not too shabby. nice local brew."
"M/D - Full bodied and very smooth and creamy. A touch overcarbonated for a RIS."
"Overall, it's fairly drinkable. The alcohol level is a bit prohibitive of having a few, but worth getting a bottle now and again. Something I'll most likely get again. It seems to tread the line between American Stout and Russian Imperial."
"D- very heavy and alcoholic, an OK representation."
"D - Good drinkable stout, worth a try but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Not too shabby, would drink this again...no doubt."
"M/D - Full bodied, but surprisingly easy to drink."
"Not bad really. Has a decent drinkability but I definitely could not drink more than two in one sitting due to the sweetness and high abv. Interesting flavors in this that put this (for me) in the stout/milk stout category."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, not nearly as thick and chewy as I'd hoped for, and very slick. Overall it's not the most drinkable one I've ever had, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"3.5 D: Not really my cup of tea (or beer?), but I never claimed to be a big fan of imperial stouts. Worth trying, but one is plenty enough."
"Alcohol is well hidden, and it's very smooth. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"Very drinkable brew as long as you do not expect an RIS. I have a hard time buying this brew as an RIS. Drinks more like a porter or cream stout. Taste is very decent, over all not a bad brew. I simply thing this does not do the style justice in the least."
"Drinkability: The thin body and lighter-than-usual nature of this IS enhance the drinkability slightly ... but the harsh alcohols and none-too-complex nature of the taste take it right back down. Not bad, but not great. Perhaps an RIS for a hot summer day?"
"Peg Leg pours a deep brown color with bright reddish/brown highlights at the bottom of the glass, it sports a 2 finger beige head and leaves some sticking. Rich malts and creamy milk chocolate fill the nose. Big toasted malts up front, sweet chocolate and smokey coffee notes, slightly grainy, some subtle notes of cherry and some definite hop character on the finish. Peg Leg has bright lively carbonation and has a good mouthful, its lighter than most in its class but it makes for excellent drinkability."
"Pours a watery dark cola-brown with deep red highlights, tan head fades quickly but leaves a good amount of lacing. Good nose on this one...plenty of roasted coffee beans, slightly charred edges, and some milk chocolate. Taste follows the smell, but with some smoky elements, dare I say campfire-esque? Drinkability is good on this, I think it would pair well with certain foods...but for me, that's the problem. I don't necessarily think of an Imperial Russian Stout as the best beer to go with food. Ultimately, it's the mouthfeel on this that hurts it. Too thin, for my taste. Nice flavors and smells, but the overall effect is more like a Porter than an Imperial Stout."
"not my favorite pick from clipper city but a decent big stout."
"Overall an OK bigger stout. This is the first Clipper City brew that didn't 'wow' me. Their Small Craft Warning and Hop3 offerings were fantastic. I'll keep trying their beers but I doubt I'll remember this one."
"Poured this into a pint glass, pours a reddish black with a fluffy head that stays around the entire time and leaves some nice thick lace. Smell is pretty good with sweet malts, raison and just a slight bit of coffee. Taste was pretty good a bit watered down to me though, it was a bit sweet with a tart coffee taste, and a slight alcohol finsh not overbearing though. Overall this was a pretty decent brew and goes down pretty easy but it being 8.00% I could drink a few of these and not even know it."
"It is a good beer, but I prefer most of the rest of the Heavy Seas line more than this one. I am glad my friend took 2 of these from the mixed 12 pack."
"I am very fond of this Imperial stout. It looked and smelled like others I have tried before. When I took a sip though I tasted a little different. It has a decent ABV but I couldnt taste it for as high as it was. It was kind of creamy and pretty smooth. Mouthfeel was excellent and it is very drinkable."
"Overall a nice smooth beer , maybe lacking a bit for a RIS."
"D: This is a great RIS. I like the fact that it only 8% as well. This is a fine beer."
"D: Very easy to drink a few of these surprisingly! Flavors are well balanced but not too complex. Enjoyable beer all around and would recommend for any dark beer lover."
"D: All the chocolate makes this a good sipper, but a medium body and creaminess makes keeps it an easy drinker."
"This is the 3rd clipper city beer ive tried, and while i liked the other two, this one isnt really all its advertised to be. I was sort of in the mood for a good thick stout tonight, and this one was a disappointment, especially since ive got those bottles of Storm King and Brooklyn Black in the fridge. oh well, you cant win em all."
"I've had better Russians but this holds its own."
"the light feel make it easier to drink, but the strong taste remind you what you are drinking."
"D: Very nice flavors and aromas coupled with an abv of only 8% make this pretty drinkable."
"Needless to say, I really liked this beer; in fact, this is now one of my favorite imperial stouts. It's not as strong as others I've had (speaking in terms of flavor), and perhaps that's why I find it so drinkable. Wassail!"
"Overall: Not a great example of an RIS. I usually like the Heavy Seas beers as they are big on taste and low on price. They just missed the mark a bit with this one."
"Poured black with a thin beige head. Smell is mainly of toasted malts but there is a weird sweet scent that reminds me of an apple juice, juice box with a hint of metal. The taste is rich in toasted malt flavor mixed with some coffee and chocolate hints. I could use more hoppiness here but there is some. The alcohol is hidden well. This brew could be even more ""imperial"" though. The feel is fairly thick and creamy with light carbonation. Kinda weird, kinda good."
"The taste of this brings back a little of the hops I smelled from the bottle. Its got the upfront chocolaty and coffee notes for sure but there is a bit of hop presence as well. The sweet maltiness of this beer is very tasty and there is a sense of the high alcohol content, but nothing too crazy. As it warms a bit I really get a lot of the rich flavors hidden in this dark and mysterious brew. This beer is absolutely delicious, I think I can leave it at that."
"Got this one as an impulse buy as I hit the counter at the Wine Specialist. Pours a near pitch black with the slimmest of highlights along the edges of the glass. Tan head that dissolves down to very limited film fairly quickly. Nose is mild roasted malt, some coffee, and a hint of sweet caramel or chocolate. Nice, but too subtle for RIS, in my book. Flavor is fairly bland as well. Overwhelmingly roasted malt and coffee aromas, with maybe some light dried fruit and a bit of hops in the end. Not bad, but again, not bold or complex enough for my liking. Body is solid, although not quite as thick and full as some. Overall, not a bad brew, but definitely one of the least consequential RIS's I've had."
"Flavor is just what is expected, roasted malt and molasses, some brown sugar again and no real hop presence. Again the booze is very well hidden and this beer would easily sneak up on you and become rather dangerous. A nice Imp Stout!!"
"This is not as bold and roasty, or as big-bodied as a typical Imperial Stout; it has this unusual floral sweetness that I really enjoy. The alcohol is very well hidden in the taste, and it is very drinkable. I've gone back to this beer a few times when I was in the mood for the flavors of an Imperial Stout, but not the heaviness."
"Pours a deep brown/black with burgandy edging. The tan head forms quickly and is about a finger and a half tall in a pint glass. Smells a little dull for an impy but a little hint of chocolate an subtle coffe come up the olfactory. The taste doesn't differ too greatly from the smell. It's a little bitter but not too bad. Chocolate malt comes up first then rolls back and makes way for a little dark chocolate. Pretty smooth feel, goes down easy. Not incredibly drinkable but easy enough to have one or two."
"I enjoy the Heavy Seas Small Craft Warning so I thought I'd try this Russian Imperial Stout brewed by Clipper City. Pours black with a thin, tan head. Aroma is bursting with malts, chocolate and toffee. A sweet, malty start with notes of chocolate and a pleasing hop finish that supplies just the right amount of bitterness. Thin mouthfeel and leaves behind average lacing. At 8 percent ABV is packs some punch. Overall another fine product from the Baltimore brewery."
"Eric"
"D - I've definitely had better. Seems a bit rough to me."
"Overall, an easy beer going down, but don't let it warm up and expose its flaws. Not a sipper, but a quaffer."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin for the style, and the drinkability is pretty good."
"D- These are fairly drinkable,which at 8%, can come back to bite you if you're not keeping track of how many you've had. A rather filling stout. I would definitely buy this again"
"It's bottle conditioned so the last two bottles go into my cellar. Maybe I'll break one out when the O's reach the World Series in October. Nah, who am I kidding..."
"M&D: Very creamy and smooth making it rather palatable in spite of the the varnish remover notes. The carbonation is light but tenacious and adds to the texture. Honestly, if the alcohol wasn't quite so noticeable in this it would really kick ass. Unfortunately, it just has a finish like acetone - not my taste."
"I love the brewery, what a pleasant find in my local liquor store, the best 12 pack most anywhere you'll go. Is it a RIS? I dunno. It's a great beer, don't get me wrong, just not worthy of a pedastal."
"Good and drinkable; not a big badass Imperial; not at all heavy; nicely carbonated to keep it light on the palate."
"D - Not bad, I enjoyed this one and wouldn't mind another. This is a decent stout and certainly worth trying."
"Bleah. Not worth it."
"Purchased a 6-pack of this in Ft Myers, FL while on vacation. Nice hot weather and a nice cool RIS is a surprisingly great combination. Root beer like appearance in both body color and head. Not much of head with slight lacing, but nice dark body with nice clarity. Not as thick as many other RISs. Aroma slightly roasted with almost a touch of roasted coconut. Mild coffee and bittersweet cocoa. The taste is sweet up front and leads to a bitterness that spreads. Both the roasted malt and hops add a nice sharpness, but nothing too acidic. Finish reverts back to sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit over-carbonated and thin for the style, but this also leads to a dangerous level of drinkability. Way too easy to drink this quick -especially at cellar temp! Overall, nice beer that has little flaws, but not up there with the big-hitting RISs on the market. Either way, a good beer on a great vacation!"
"I thought I had tried this a while ago, but didn't have any records of it, so I tried it again last night. It poured opaque black with tan head. It smelled like caramel and coffee malts, citrus hops, and a bit of alcohol...sweet but without the typical chocolate. It tasted like caramel and oatmeal malts mixed with mild coffee and milk chocolate, creating a surprisingly delicate and subtle flavor for an imperial. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation and had a lasting, bitter aftertaste with some slight alcohol warming. Overall this had an interesting balance of flavors that shifted from sweet to bitter. It was very clean and drinkable, but they could have cranked it up one more notch to reach its full potential."
"As far as drinkability was concerned, this was almost a dump but I did struggle through it and it did improve a little as it warmed. maybe I got a bad bottle. I will have to give it try."
"D - Overall, it was quite drinkable, just not the best RIS."
"All this said, I can't knock the drinkability. Not because it's more drinkable, per se, than bigger Impy Stouts, but because now that I know what to look for, I'd be happy to pick up a four pack of this and have it around for when it gets chilly, but when I don't want something that over the top. Of course, that being the case, I'd rather have a Sam Smith's...."
"D: Fairly good drinkability per style, drinking much bigger then its advertised 8.0%abv but definitely worth a try and decent per style."
"For an RIS it's a little too tame, but it's still waaaay too smooth for a beer that's got so much alcohol."
"Cracked the top and poured vigorously from 12oz bottle into Harp Pint glass. Nice almost pitch black in color, very thin tan head, with good to moderate lacing. The stout smells fantastic, malts, coca, herbal notes with an undeniable tinge of alcohol. Very solid taste, more of the coca and malt. Herbal undertones, with a somewhat sweet and mildly alcohol finish. Overall this is a very nice imp stout for the price. Too sweet, and heavy for a session beer, nice economical sipper!"
"This beer is quite complex and robust in flavor. The Heavy Seas line of beers out of Clipper City have quickly become my de facto favorite beers you can get in a bottle. I've had three different ones now and can't wait to try more."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: As I mentioned earlier, at the proper temperature this is a dangerously drinkable brew, especially during the cold months. Complex, with layers of flavor that set it apart from the ""common"" stout, its smoothness and lighter body make it drinkable enough for me to sip a few over a couple of hours. Highly recommended."
"M/D: smooth yet way too drinkable, not just because its a solid beer, but because its 8% and doesn't feel it. I have reviewed a lot of the ""top"" beers in this style and that doesn't make me an expert by any means, but this beer has a place in there, not as aggressive or assertive, but solid and tasty"
"Pours not quite opaque but very black color with a slim quarter inch dirty brown head which falls to a trace. Aromas are very roasty, lots of chocolate malts, coffee notes, very little hop aroma, relatively high ester production as well given all the dark fruits. Alcohol notes are subtle. On the palate, the chocolate and black malts continue to provide the bulk of the flavor. Incredibly smooth however so I imagine roasted malts have been kept low. Fruity esters provide the only counterpoint with a slight floral hop note in the finish. Body is only medium high, low for an RIS, but given its interpretation as an 8% abv, understandable. Carbonation is also spot on. Not as big as I like my RISs, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"D - Nicely drinkable imperial stout, paired with dessert would be a good choice for this beer. My wife enjoyed this beer, and she is generally a light lager drinker. We drank it with some Girl Scout cookies (chocolate peanut butter) and they went well together."
"Not a bad stab at the style - hits on the main points, but on the thin side."
"Not the best Imperial Stout I've sampled, but for the price, certainly worth a shot..."
"Looks nice, but that's about it. The aroma is of black grains, dark chocolate, and vodka. The dark flavors are nice, but too mellow, and the alcohol element is too overpowering. The taste has a light burnt flavor, with a relatively creamy feel, balancing bitterness and booze. Overall, the flavor is too low and the alcohol is too obvious. With so many good RIS options, pass on this one."
"I noticed a funky smell coming from my glass (like a sewer, really). Maybe it's me! If so, I'll revise the review!"
"Taste is fairly similar, a very smooth and easy drinking RIS. It gives up a lot of the bold, in your face flavor that is part of the appeal of a lot of RIS's, but it does so in order to provide a nice, simple, and enjoyable drinking experience. I would have another, but i probably won't purchase another. If I am in the mood for a RIS, I really want something big, bad, and bold. Recommended if you want an easier introduction to the style."
"This isn't my favorite russian imperial stout but its a good easy drinking one. Its smooth not chalky and a nice example of a R.I.S."
"D - One of the most drinkable stouts I've had. Perhaps it's a bit too carbonated, but its flavorful and it goes down easily."
"Full mouthfeel, moderately carbonated with a tingly finish. A tannic powdery feel lingers. Good drinkability, but feels more like a big porter than an imperial stout."
"Poured into a straight pint. This stout pours an opaque black with a ruby red ring around the top of the beer. A rich tan head dissipates rather quickly and vanishes almost without a trace. Sweet aromas of molasses and raisins, rich nose is very intriguing. Slight roasted coffee aromas as well. Warm rich tastes of dark cocoa and coffee, the molasses is definitely present. Raisins on the finish really make this interesting. No real strong tastes of the high alcohol, which is enjoyable. Mouthfeel is really nice, the palate is full of flavor and makes the mouth salivate. Medium carbonation. Extremely drinkable and could be my new contender to Gonzo when I am in the mood for an Imperial Stout/Porter."
"D- Thin, watery and unpleasant, easy to gulp I guess if I were to hold my nose. The somewhat weak ABV for the style still managed to be overpowering and annoying compared to the other flavors in the brew; this is sad considering I have drank RIS's with more than twice the ABV that were still more smooth and drinkable (and some damn good beers, by the way). This was utterly disapointing and almost a drain pour, though to do such a thing goes completely against my principles. I will warn others to stay away. First timers, please do not take this brew as any indicator of the style to which it supposedly belongs. There are many wonderful examples of Russian Imperial Stouts out there that are an absolute joy to drink. This is just not one of them."
"D: Somewhat drinkable for its class. Not too bad tasting (though there are better out there), full enough to not totally disappoint, easy for a good & slow drink. As with most stouts, it's a little higher in alcohol, so not to be overdone. Personally, I probably wouldn't go with it again, though."
"Not something I'll reach for anytime soon."
"D: not bad. I'd have again but there are better."
"Drinkability: I really wish the taste would've lived up to the smell."
"D- No strong alcohol presence, decently balanced, but nothing special."
"I would definitely purchase a sixpack of this beer if given the opportunity. I really enjoyed this stout and look forward to having another one!"
"D: Pretty good, nothing special. I'd buy it again, though."
"As it pours into the glass you can see a little light thru the stream of black ale. Ends up totaly black in body hosting a quick fading inch of dark tan head. Nose is softly sweet with a nice balance of roasted malt, syrupy coco and alchol. Enters the mouth with a thin malty chocolate feel that quickly yeilds to a bit of a sour tongue twinge. I swear this drinks more like a porter than an Imperial stout. Not bad, and nicely drinkable but lacks the bold richness and complexity I expect from Impy stouts."
"This beer has some good basics down, with a smooth texture helping the mouthfeel a lot. Yet this beer lacks punch, a heavy load of something such as coffee, caramel, or malt to make beer drinkers fall in love with it. Pity."
"Not a whole lot here to talk about, this is really just a high-octane light stout at best. I can't recommend this for any other purpose than to know what it tastes like."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, good kick, decent representation of style, overall, I really didnt like this beer too much. It seems like they were trying to go for a hoppy stout, which I dont mind conceptually, but finished product itself just doesnt appeal to me."
"D - Not bad. This is focused on the chocolate and 'shroomy earth tones, whic for me makes it more drinkable than some espresso oriented Imperial stouts. I like the nose more than I like anything else about this brew, but I wouldn't hesitate to try this again if I saw it on the beer list somewhere."
"D- A decent beer, but there is nothing special drawing me in."
"Drinkability: Very good for a RIS, not too sugary or overwhelming in any area. This could be viewed as good or bad. A decent RIS. Too much other good stuff out there."
"This beer actually ages pretty well, but probably over 6 months, definitely not over a year. I'm curious to try the other Heavy Seas Imperial Stout made by Clipper City after it has been aged for a few months. The brew is somewhat complex, maybe a little on the lighter side of flavor, but still pretty robust. Recommended."
"D= By smell or the initial taste I would have rated this higher but the alcohol burn took away much of my desire to drink this again. I may age a couple for a eyar and see how they do then."
"Pours opaque. Tan head. Nose is malted, but not very robust. Keep in mind that I just had Old Heathen Imperial Stout before this one (which I gave a 4.6 overall). Malty slight caramel sweetness on the nose. Lacks a complexity I would love to see. Flavor is thick, but lacks complexity again, as did the nose. Malt presence, yes. But is there a defining character? No. This one seems to border on porter-esqe and not so much the imperial stout. Just lacks that thick, deep, mature attitude. Bring the funk, baby. Feel is good. Thick liquid feel with a nice carbonation. Overall, drinkable indeed. Just doesn't carry any real distinctive characteristics that would set it apart from other examples of the style. I would rather have another of the Old Heathens than this in hindsight."
"Smooth but not very substantial, not as thick as I would like it to be. Other than the few minor things (not quite 'big' enough), this one is pretty good and is more drinkable than average."
"Mouthfeel was awesome. Very full, almost viscous. Rich. reminiscient of eating chocolate cake. \Pretty good stout. Clipper City should be proud."
"hate to say it, but, in my opinion, this was the worst in the heavy seas lineup from clipper city. maybe i had a bad sample - seeing as the bottle had a best by feb 08 on it, but it is a high abv bottle conditioned stout, so it should have done okay with a little age. i also noticed some of the other reviews had the same issues with it that i did. it looked okay. dark with a tannish head that had fairly poor retention, but left nice lace. nose was weak. some roasty malt and seriously light hints of coffee and dark chocolate. no hop character. taste was the same. not terrible by any means, but not nice and robust and complex. mouthfeel was poor. medium body not full like an imperial stout should be. when i think stout, i think bell's or founders or three floyds or a host of others that have impressed me. this one didn't. sorry clipper city, you 're really going to have to step it up before peg leg can even deserve to be in this category."
"Overall, a thin, one dimensional example of style. Not recommended."
"Poured into an American pint glass with a dark brown, almost black color. 1/2 inch light tan head that dissipated immediately into little more than a thin skim. Thin consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Smell of malt and molasses with subtle coffee and fruit undertones. More flavors of malt, chocolate, coffee and dark fruit (cherries or plum). Very little carbonation, so not very lively in the mouth, although a slight silkiness in texture. Not as full a mouthfeel as I would have expected from a self-described imperial stout (more like a milk stout or a porter), but very pleasant to imbibe. Not what I would consider representative of the style, but pretty enjoyable all the same."
"drinkability - Very nice stout,.might be one of the best I have had."
"Not a mindblower, and relatively simple for the style, this is definitely one of the more drinkable Russian Imperial Stouts out there, given the easygoing but substantial flavor and low-ish alcohol content."
"All kinds of stuff going on in there... You know... I'm definitely going to have to try this one again... I think that the sour note might be from mistreatment somewhere. Other than the sour note (like you'd expect in a biere de garde or certain other aged beers) it's a fine brew. But, boy, the sour note really drags it down! Might just be the flavor hops - Clipper City is big on those... Coffer and chocolate and caramel - all nicely balanced. No bitterness detected. But, oh, that twang. Sigh. It's really too bad... With less twang, a bit more bitterness and a bit more body this would be excellent!"
"D: Pretty run of the mill. The mouth feel is the best part. Average put easy to come by and much cheaper than Expedition and Old Rasputin."
"D: Good -n- bitter!"
"D - See above a little high on the abv to make it a session brew but I think this is my favorite stout that I've had so far"
"I tend to use Guinness as my benchmark since it is so ubiquitous; I would take this over Guinness any day. It has a fuller, more balanced, a slightly more mellow flavor and is mostly free of the Irish champ's burnt coffee experience. While not my favorite domestic imperial, Peg Leg makes my recommended list."
"Strange brew. Not highly recommended."
"Pours a deep black with 1/2 a finger of tan head that leaves some nice lace. The smell is rather tame and mostly of coffee and roasted malts. The taste is of slightly smoky coffee, and a lingering chocolate effect, somewhat balanced with some bitter hops. The mouthfeel is a bit light for the style, which leads it to be very drinkable for the style. This is easier to drink then some 5% beers. Not a bad offering, but their are better Imperial stouts out there."
"Has notes of chocolate, coffee, a bit of fruitiness and a nice warming finish. A good RIS in my books but nothing to complex."
"D - Overall a very good beer and it was enjoyable"
"This is a nice imperial stout. It isn't risky or over the top by any means, just solid and well balanced. Good stuff."
"Having this beer right now while watching the Yankees-Indians game. Poured a dark brown color with a creamy brown head. Left nice lacing on the glass. Has a chocolate and roasted coffee nose. Feels very smooth in the mouth and goes down easy. Surprising low bite for 8%."
"The mouthfeel is good, thick and tongue coating as I would expect. And the drinkability is dangerous, not filling at all, and as I said the alcohol is barely present. Overall a great stout but a little too mellow for an imperial stout. (for reference Sammy Smith's and Old Rasputin are my go to imperial stouts.)"
"D - A pretty decent stout, but not the best of the style -it is worth a try, but don't go out of your way to find it--simple solid strong stout"
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Poured a very dark, opaque brown, with a light creamy brown head. Aroma was slightly bananay, milky, and brown sugary. Tasted sweet, faintly of oatmeal cookie. Felt good in the mouth, clung to the inside just enough to linger, but not enough to be sticky. Left a little bitterness on the toungue. Beyond that, it was very easy and good to drink. Went down very smoothly."
"12 oz. bottle in a snifter...jet black body with a creamy 1/2 inch head; head leaves small but strong lacinghints of milk and roasted something, with a little bread rolled insurprisingly, no alcohol tints...smooth palate, warm roll over the tongue, coating the whole mouth with a hops/malt/yeast balance that succeeds in its distribution...Ive been a little critical of the more far-reaching Heavy Seas attempts at Weyerbachering already drinker-friendly styles, but this imperial stout is workingsmooth and engaging, I look forward to pairing my next glass with a Maduro Churchill to celebrate the Browns first winmaybe in two weeks? A beer that has September-to-May possibilitiesnot quite scotch, but a few will put me in a nice place tonight"
"An excellent Imperial Stout. Great body and color. Great smell, with hints of chocolate and coffee to it. Taste is great and the feel is great as well. I wouldn't recommend it in the summer, but it is a great cold weather beer! Resembles more of a porter than a stout though"
"Pours opaque black with no head or lacing. Smells malty, a little chocolate notes and some roast. Tastes of sweet malt, and basically how it smells but everything is very subtle. Medium in the mouth with decent carbonation. Very easy drinking but doesnt live up to the imperial stout billing."
"Another 'Heavy Seas' offering from the sampler pack. This Imperial Stout poured a blackish brown almost opaque liquid. A small thin foam cap rest atop, little lacing. Smell is toasted malts with a raisin and plum sweet element. A whiff of chocolate as well. Taste is again the malts now seeming a bit burnt. The fruit element remains raisin and plums. The chocolate is now heated by a bit of hoppy alcohol. Mouthfeel was decent, clean yet a bit chewy, definitely not a BIG Imperial Stout. Drinkability was OK, if a warming full bodied stout is what your looking for this may not be your beer. Possibly a stout suited for warmer weather."
"This beer poured a dark blackish brown with a off white head that settles into a thin layer on the top of the beer. The beer smells of dark roasted malts and a sweet hint of hops. Its smell is not over powering like you might think but rather it has a light sweet quality. It has caramelized malt flavors with a hint of chocolate. It has a roasted taste that comes out in the back along with a slight hops taste but has little bite. It certainly has a heavy taste but the mouth is clean and smooth. Its a heavy beer with little carbonation but it finishes crisp rather than coating the mouth. I thought this was a very tasty beer. It has all the qualities of a tasty beer without over doing them. It really doesnt stand out in my mind as a great beer but it has a fine flavor and is certainly easy to drink."
"D - The only beer that disappointed me out of the 12 pack sampler I picked up from OH."
"I got this as a part of the Heavy Seas mix pack. It pours an inky black, opaque when held up to a light. The aroma is sweet and rich caramel and toffee, rounding off a nice roasted character. Flavor is very sweet, caramel and chocolate with a burnt astringency rounding it out. Overall a very nice RIS, there is a lot of flavor packed into this beer."
"It's really light for being an imperial stout. Very non-offensive but also lacking in many departments."
"I won't revisit this one."
"Overall- This is the weakest Imperial I think I ever had. It would be a few points higher if this were just a regular stout. Is this really 8% alc. Couldn't detect. Give this 1 a try."
"Not too bad. It just misses on a few key areas. But with all the great imperial stouts I could have, this one won't be a repeat buy."
"Dark brown body allows more light through than many imperial stouts. Topped by a thin brown head. Aroma has espresso and cocoa notes. Not much else other than a hint of caramelized sugar. Flavor doesnt have a lot to offer - some dark chocolate, some burnt sugar and a touch of 3-hour old coffee. Alcohol isnt readily apparent. Mouthfeel is average, a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is OK. Not sure I'd want to have more than one of this offering, though."
"Pretty drinkable I'd say - not much alcohol heat. A bit of age might have smoothed that out. It's a perfectly good beer, but as you've probably gathered from all the ""other imperial stouts taste like ___"" lines I've written, it doesn't quite live up to others of its style. I'm all for uniqueness, but when you expect one thing and get another, it can be disappointing for some. If it weren't for all that, I guarantee I would have given it higher marks."
"D. An easy beer to drink. The 8% abv is surprisingly well hidden."
"OK for a sipper but it may be a while before I drink the other two."
"Pours a two finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Flavor is chocolate/licorice with a slight baker's chocolate finish. Higher ABV is hidden. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"D- As it warms the alcohol becomes much more noticable and the other flavors aren't strong enough to mask it. It wasn't a bad brew overall but not one of the better Russian Imperials. Worth a try but not something I will buy again."
"Another out of my sampler pack from heavy seas. Poured black with some amber light hues. Smelled on the burnt coffee side, but I picked up some sweetness to it. Tastes of coffee roast with some chocolate malt. Overall a good attempt and Heavy Seas is going under the radar with some good brews. I am anxious to see some other options hit Jacksonville from this brewery as I've only found this same mixed pack over and over w/ the same samplers each time."
"Part of the Heavy Seas variety pack purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC. Pours a dark black color with a thin light tan colored head. The aroma features dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and caramel. The taste is more of the same, dark roasted malts with some dark coffee and a dry finish. The 8% ABV is well hidden. Overall, this is a pretty decent RIS."
"Very very drinkable because of how smooth it is. And at 8% alcohol, the brew hides it pretty well..."
"The weight is right to drink a few but the alcohol is a little high."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head that does not last long, some little oil slicks/islands are left. The nose is mostly malts, some oak/bourbon, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slight oak/bourbon flavor, and some caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad RIS, recommended."
"The slightly thinner mouthfeel makes this more drinkable than most imperial stouts."
"M: medium carbonation and crisp - lacking the roundness of malt character."
"Yeah, I guess it's pretty good. I mean, for a Russian Imperial Stout, it's not any Storm King or Old Rasputen, but it's pretty good. Pours black with a fluffy, but not sticky head. Smell isn't as deep or chocolaty or as roasty as I would expect in a RIS; it smells like a nice amber or maibock if I had to guess. Taste is sweet at the front of the tongue, and a bit dry and coffee/bakers' chocolate at the end, but the flavors don't meld together well. It's a decent beer, but not one of my favorites."
"Overall profile seems very porter-like rather than an Imperial Stout. Kinda middle-of-the-road."
"The aroma is pretty weak for a stout, but has hints of mild chocolates and coffee. The flavor is better with a good blend of burnt malts and a nice coffee taste. For a stout the mouthfeel is only slightly chewy."
"Overall this is an above-average imperial stout. It's just a little too weak for me."
"A very nice Imperial Stout. In fact the whole Heavy Seas variety case has been a pleasant surprise. Worth trying for sure."
"Heavy Seas - Peg Leg (Imperial Stout) pours a very dark brown, it's opaque and has a small cap of brown foam. I cannot see any ruby along the edges. The nose is quite odd for the style, I swear I'm getting citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, although it is fairly thick. There are some nice coffee notes, but I'm also getting either citrus or tropical fruit too. Not that it's a bad thing, but it's not something I expect in an imperial stout. Not bad and worth a try, but not your typical Russian imperial stout."
"Thick and hearty, dark tan head rises slowly after the pour and settles to a 1/4"" thick head that stays put. Strong alcohol and pungent yeast/hop combo make this quite an interesting aroma. Thick, malty, rich, and spicy. The flavor profile is nice on this one. It starts out with a very pronounced and clean roasted taste. I've had some that have a really dirty, fiery, charcoal taste, but this is heavily, and slow roasted grain from what it tastes like. There is an underlying sweetness throughout the drink that reminds me of cane sugar and oatmeal. It finishes strong with a very mild hop aftertaste. Overall, full flavor, creamy mouthfeel, perfect balance of sweet and roast. Excellent RIS."
"This beer poured a jet dark black color from a 12 oz bottle. No light getting thru at all. Dark mahogany with ruby tones when back lit. There was a freshness date for May 2007 but I figured it was ok at 8%. Decent one finger tan off-white colored head with mild lacing left in the glass. There was some mild sediment in the bottom of the glass as well. Smell is of alcohol mixed with chocolate malt and a subtle hint of caramel in the back ground. Some roasted malt tones and maybe some smokiness mixed in. Taste is of strong chocolate malt crossed with a mild sweet hint. There is a roasted malt flavor with an alcohol flavor in the after taste as well. Not a bad tasting beer but it is not the best tasting Imperial Stout I have had. It does have a rather smooth flavor and a decent taste. It certainly starts to taste better as it came to room temp. I think it also became easier to drink. The taste did start to grow on me though. The 8% also made it a bit more tolerable."
"12oz bottle from Florian's. Completely opaque black body with almost no tan head. Smells roasty and peaty, though the aroma is almost not there. Roasty earthy flavor with kind of a licorice quality in the background. Kind of a nutty quality too. Thick full body, though not as full as I've seen in other examples of the style. Fairly drinkable. Not my favorite RIS or even my favorite stout, but a fairly solid ale nonetheless."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer. It is easily quaffable and full of earthy and fruity flavors. The aftertaste is best part of this beer."
"Alittle complex, medium body for its not as thick as some imperials. Overall a good easy drink'n beer for this style."
"A half decent RIS, although doesn't really play with the big boys. Poured dark brown and somewhat clear into a pint glass. Good coffee/chocolate and noticeably smoky flavour and aroma. Lighter in body and higher in carbonation than I'd expect for the style. Bitter coffee aftertaste."
"Overall this is a decent imperial. I usually prefer a bit more hops, but this okay, more of an English-style version I suppose."
"Pours a dark black color with a thin light tan colored head. The aroma features dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. The taste features more of the dark roasted malts with some dark coffee and a dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent RIS that is worth another try. Not quite as ""bold"" as many others within the style but good none-the-less."
"A good, easy to drink Imperial Stout that has a light mouthfeel for all the creamy texture & taste. I've had better, and I've had much worse. This is a good beer, and would be on the short list for warmer weather stouts. Would probably pare well with a nice steak, some hearty potatoes, anything mushroom, even a chocolate chip cookie! I'd certainly drink it again and would recommend it, especially for warmer weather enjoyment."
"D: Very good for the style (and alcohol content)."
"A 12oz bottle with a freshness date of Aug 07. Poured into a pint glass, this was a dark brown, almost black beer with a fairly small head. It had a dark chocolate aroma, but was somewhat simple in aroma. The taste was chocolate and coffee, but, again, was rather meek. This was an OK beer, but there are a lot of other RISs that I would drink first."
"D: This is really like a brown ale and less like an imperial stout. Still a good beer, Im not hating on it for the style."
"Drinkability good finding it easy drinking, smooth, and enjoyable."
"Don't drink and review."
"Picked this one up at a BP for less than $3 a bottle, cannot be that for a RIS. Just like the other Clipper City I've tried, better than average but nothing too exciting. Best quality is its appearance -- thick cremay brownish head, opaque, no carbonation. Smells of plums, fruit, and dark choclate, with a tast to match. Bit of a thin mouthfeel, more flavors come out as it warms. Good starter Russian Imperial Stout."
"Overall, it was a fine brew to sample. Not absolutely stellar, but good nonetheless. It seemed a little too watery in taste though to make it a truly good imperial."
"To it's credit, the alcohol doesn't dominate the flavor. Other than that, it is pretty average compared to other Russian IS's. Head disappates quickly, has some nice chocolatey notes to it and coffee. Thin to medium body. Smell is decent, heavy alcohol, which is nice. Very smooth to drink, you may be able to get carried away with this one, but not a premier beer."
"Beer poured black with ruby undertones and a well sustained tan head. Nose is a hint of chocolate malts and not much else. Taste is sweet, heavy on the malts, especially the chocolate malts, and lighter on the hops than anticipated but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is creamy but is a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is good. This is not a lights out imperial stout but certainly an enjoyable one and is definitely worth a shot."
"Strong aroma is rather sweet and has a definite overtone of rum-soaked wood, as well as caramel and malty notes. It pours a beautiful clear mahogany with a fairly thick and fluffy pale tan head. Sublime flavor has tones of rum, caramel, malt and wood, and is rather sweet but not cloying. Full-bodied, syrupy texture has just a little fizz, though. A truly satisfying beer to be sipped and savored."
"Pours a dark black, brown edges, thick tan head, nice lacing, good retention, sticks well. Smell is sweet, chocolate and roast, some pine, alcohol, pretty nice. Taste is toffee, chocolate, vanilla, very smooth, nice roast, very rich and creamy, very enjoyable. Medium bodied, low carbonation, very smooth. For the ABV very smooth and enjoyable, would have again. Thanks Chris and Kyoko!"
"Overall, the beer hides the alcohol well and is a tasty imperial stout. The drinkability is good due to the good flavor balance and light mouthfeel - it's just that I like my imperial stouts to have a little heavier body."
"A bit creamy. Leaves a lasting film after the swallow. Not too thick, but a nice body. Not dry or chalky like some stouts tend to be. It's really good, very drinkable. Thick but not heavy. Repeats welcome!"
"Taste is sweet with coffee and hops and plenty of malt sugar. Mouthfeel is smooth but extremely thin, like a baltic or English porter. Taste improves as it warms and shows drinkable balance, especially for a beer with such a robust alcohol showing and mild body. Different, and not wonderful but definitely a tasty, well done stot worth downing a few."
"A fresh cask of Peg Leg - brought to the bar the same day I sampled it. Fresh hop aroma with yeasty and roasty notes mingled in. Flavor is roasted grains, earthy hops, and weak coffee. For an Imperial stout the body is significantly lacking - more of a porter-like body and depth to it (not to insult some of the better porters I've had with more body and depth of flavor) The cask conditioning is the twist that really pushes this beer forward with the fresh earthy yeasty/ hoppy profile, otherwise I would say this beer needs more body and depth. It is certainly well crafted, but fighting with one hand tied behind its back."
"A good beer, but nothing great."
"The 8.0% is hidden well. Good drinkability."
"The Peg Leg Imperial Stout is a dangerously easy beer to drink. Not as complex as some, but certainly a worthy imperial stout."
"or that would make one shout"
"12 oz. bottle with freshness date clearly marked on the label. Fuzzy tan head sits atop a very dark mahogany brown with burgundy red highlights. Not much head retention here. Smells oddly fruity for an imperial stout...I'm expecting dark fruit aromas, and I'm detecting a little raisin here and there, but its almost citrusy? Call me crazy...but maybe there's a bunch of hops in here! Wow, unique flavor...starts out with some sweet, roasty, carmel malt flavors that slide into a piny, resinous hop flavor...and then a very delicate and very pleasant chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Not sticky at all either. Very accessible for an imperial stout...I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to start getting into this style."
"D The coffee, honey and dryness were to the good, but it was too light for an imperial. It was ok, but I wouldn't go looking for it."
"decent enough drinkability, the alcohol doesn't come through much to this beers benefit. a good beer, but lacks anything that might make it stand out. almost porter-ish as well."
"Very dark brown with ruby highlights. The short cap of light tan head dissipated quickly, leaving a thin skim of fine bubbles and a ring. There was only a bit of short-lived lacing. Bready malt aroma, some caramel, a bit grainy, with not much roast. Sweet and malty with a hint of cherries, mostly bready. There was a bit of chocolate and alcohol, but not much roast. Medium to full bodied with lowish, creamy carbonation. Overall, a pretty weak imperial stout, but not a bad beer. More like a porter than anything else."
"This is a pretty decent full flavored stout. Certainly worth a try. I will have to invest in more of this style later on."
"Mouthfeel- warming with a sweeter profile. Mostly malt with a very mild hop profile. I barely got any roasted or coffee flavors. Finished smooth and remained sweet. Alcohol is warming but not dominating. This is mild for a RIP but it drank well and was not bad. Just could have been a little bolder with more coffee or chickory flavors. Good brew nonetheless!"
"D - It served its purpose...I wanted something to warm me up, but didn't have time to savor the beer. I'm glad I got to try it, but I won't be picking up any more of these."
"This beer is the reason why I got the mix 12 pack from Clipper City and surprisingly it is my least favorite of the offerings. This brew poured to a very dark black color with a smallish light tan head that did not have much of any legs and also did not provide much of any lacing. I was wondering if this could have been my glass even though I usually do see this problem so for the next brew I hand washed a new glass to make sure I had no soap or chemical build up but had the same result. Anyway, the aromas where ok with highlights of coffee, chocolate and I think a little cherry or some other dark fruit. Good smell, just seems to be missing something here, for a imperial stout I would think things would stand out but they dont. The taste is also ok, seems quite pedestrian to me but the highlights are chocolate with a slight coffee feel with a break to a noticeable hop flavor that lingers somewhat. Over all this is a pretty ok brew but for it to be in the category of an imperial stout it just seems to be to blah for my expectations. This one does not stand up to the other offering in the Heavy Seas collection."
"Nice black color-very nice tan head on top. Good, though not very prominant, roasted aroma. Ink like smell to it. Big, malty flavor. Nice roasted highlights. Somewhat sweet-almost like a milk stout. Lingering roasted flavors in the finish. Good body-seems to have been kicked up a notch. Very drinkable. Could lose some of the sweetness for my liking. Not as much roasted and harsh taste to it as some RIS. Good effort-as is any beer from the Heavy Seas line."
"A worthwhile try. This would go great with a slice of chocolate cake. The blend is nice and the taste work well on the tongue. Only drawback is the overall strength of flavors is a little weak."
"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Transit,poured into a small goblet a near pitch black with just a hint of ruby shown thru a tight well formed 1/2 finger mocha colore head atop.Dark fruit alcohol notes and and a dryer rooty elemant shows thru as well,flavors of dark fruit,licorice and rum shine out most that earthy rawness shows up a bit late but is subdued but nicely noticed.Not big and chewey like many impy stouts but it is rather quaffable,a bit beter than expected it has character."
"Poured a deep oil black with an enormous cream colored head that stayed around forever. Deep thick lacing.Smell was alot of coffee and caramel sweetness, roasted malts abound on this one. The taste was very well rounded. Very slight hint of coffee and dark fruits, predominant flavor is sugary roasted caramel. There is a slight hopped back to it as well. Dry finish and easy going down. No hint of alcohol at all, and at 8%abv thats saying something! This was an easy drinker and a good RIS. Would definatly drink this again!"
"I like this stuff quite a bit,its not overpowering at all in the impy stout catagory.I reccommend this to any stout loving fan."
"I was a little disappointed with this beer, does not seem very RIS like."
"Cheers!"
"D- This beer is smooth and mellow with not much depth and the flavors it does have are not that interesting."
"This is just another beer from clipper city, that is decent, but misses the mark. I really think of this as more of a poorly made stout than a Russian Imperial stout. Not a bad purchase, but there are better RIS's out there for the money..."
"This is one of my first few reviews where I reviewed a beer 'blind' without reading other reviews first. I bought it based on how well I loved Winter Storm. Glad to see I'm not the only one confused/refusing to call it an RIP. Still it's a good beer, needs a different label or recipe change."
"I enjoyed this much more than some other Impy Stouts Ive had lately."
"While not so sure about my enthusiasm about the classification of 'Imperial Stout' for this brew...it's lively, tasty, and worthy of another look as long as there is a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream within reach"
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and pretty dry. Alcohol is somewhat apparent. Carbonation is appropriate. Overall drinkability is good, I could have a few of these and be quite happy. I'd be on the fence about whether to call it a porter or a stout. Smoke says porter, and if were just a tad thinner and dryer I think that'd bump it to the porter category. Damn good either way, so moot point."
"Im going to rank the drinkability biasedly. Im giving this beer a higher rank for drinkability because this is one of the few RIS's I can get locally (also brewed locally). That makes this beer for the style, very drinkable :). When I cant get the powerhouse RIS's, this will be one of my goto's."
"Poured an opaque deep blackish brown with ruby hued edges, foamy finger of light tan head dissipated into a moderate ring of lacing. Aroma is sweet, roasty and malt, dark coffee and chocolate notes dominate, slight earthy aromas also linger in the nose. Taste is also sweet and roasty, less malty and much sweeter than the nose lets on. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, thinnest beer I've had of this style, medium bodied with mild carbonation. Goes down smooth and easy, quenches thirst with ease. Drinkability is good, hides the 8% abv very well, hardly noticeable at all. Overall a decent RIS, worth trying. Might purchase again."
"This is a pretty decent full flavored stout, but falls short of the RIS catagory so it will have to take a hit on the rating. Best to let this one warm a bit. Certainly worth a try."
"Pours nearly black with dark ruby-garnet highlights. Biege-colored head of three fingers is dense and holds well, leaving light spotty lacing. Heavy aromas of black patent malt, baker's cocoa, and roasted barley. A clean alcohol scent emerges as it warms. Sweet tasting upfront and full of caramel and roasted notes; then comes burnt malt flavors, dark chocolate, and a snap of nuetral alcohol. Dry aftertaste, faint american hop flavor and mild bitterness balance well with the big malt prescence and hint of booze. Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation, perhaps too thin and crisp for an Imperial stout; but this also aids the relatively clean finish. Only slight residual chocolate and coffee flavors remain briefly, which are then quickly lifted by the drying hops, charred malt character, and hint of alcohol. This possesses a great drinkability and has a respectable malt complexity, but it might not satisfy the BA seeking an enormous Russian Imperial Stout."
"Pours black, thin tan head, not much retention, but good lacing. Smell is of dark fruits,and malts. The is a hint of grassy hops,that is very nice. Body is medium. Not much carbionation. Taste Is sweet dark chocolate up front, with a very light roasting. Fruity undertones throughout,with a bit of hops in the finish. Wish I had more than one."
"I enjoyed this brew with a nice french baggette and some hard Italian salami.The beer was very very drinkable and would be a good session beer. Cheers."
"Drinkability: This beer comes across as simple and unassuming when compared to some of the more intense premier examples of the style. In fact, I wouldn't really consider it deserving of the 'imperial' designation, though it certainly was the best beer in the Heavy Seas Sampler!"
"Mouthfeel is about where it needs to be for the style, but there is really nothing special here. Glad I tried it, but I certainly won't be rushing back for another."
"Still all in all, just OK."
"Overall, not terrible, but not something I'd bother with again."
"A very drinkable Imperial Stout, will be having more of these."
"Pours a dark coffee and molasses mix with a decent head at first, but doesn't linger very long and the last of my 12 .oz is finished with no foam at all. Great brown sugar, molasses, creamy vanilla, and roasty malts. The flavor has a medium strong coating of sweet roasted coffee, vanilla cream, nut brown resin, and light chestnut. Plenty of sweet, yet dark smoothness on my tongue. Well hidden or incorporated alcohol."
"drinkable?:not so much, it is a slow one cause of the adding bad aspects of the beer that are not AS bad if you slowly sip it."
"Many thanks to Aprilluvsbeer for the opportunity to try this bit of heaven."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. This stout is very dark with about a half inch head that left quickly. Nice lacing throughout. The smell is sweet, malty, and creamy. Definite hints of coffe and/or dark chocolate. The taste is very good with a lot of malt and much chocolate flavor. Very nice flavor. Mouthfeel is good, exceptable for the style. I don't think I could drink a lot of these but I can't drink a lot of any stout. This is probably the best out of a sampler of four of CC's beer I have tried."
"Most russian imperial stouts are dry and almost chalky.This peg leg seems to sweet for one, and the mouthfeel is weak. But on a postive note if your site didn't call it a R.I.Stout I 'd say it's pretty tasty for a light stout. The roasted malt balanced well with the good hoppy flavor shining thru. I'ts hard to be negative with such a great beer c.o.. Clippercity makes great stuff. Can't wait for the winter storm to come out next month!"
"Poured into an Ename chalice, the Imperial Stout is a deep blackish amber color, with a small, creamy brown head with large bubbles that dissipated quickly, leaving very little lace. The is a faint aroma of roasted chocolate. The taste was mainly roasted barely with touches of chocolate and coffee, nicely balanced by the bittering hops on the finish, robust enough to mask any indication of the 8% ABV. The mouthfeel is creamy and not as heavy as one might expect. Overall, it is a fine Imperial Stout but nothing extraordinary."
"T/M: Nice and smooth milkyness with a semi dry finish. Toffee, caramel, mocha, and roasted barley all dance on the palate. Slight dark fruityness that comes through. Hops are also noticeable. A medium body on the RIS with a low level of carbonation. Gets better as it warms up. Not a sophisticated or overly complex RIS, but middle of the road--worth a shot if you like the other Clipper City offerings."
"Served in a pint glass the beer pours very dark brown, almost black, with a small tan head. It smells like coffee, nuts, roasted malt and a bit of chocolate. It tastes the same way, but with a bitter and sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy, and it goes down very smooth. Even with the relatively high ABV, it's pretty easy to drink as the alcohol is hidden well. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, I'm a fan of Heavy Seas. Its just that, while this is a good beer, some of their others are better and more true to style."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is an Impy that is easy to drink and the recipe is a big improvement over the one they brewed a few years ago"
"First let me say that I love the Heavy Seas series of beers from Clipper City to begin with, so I had high expectations of the Peg Leg going into this. Fortunately, it did not disappoint. Pours a nice dense brown color; a solid stout appearance with a two-finger light brown head, which died down entirely too soon. Still, it left a noticeable lace. Coffeeish aroma with hints of chocolate and nuts. Something else, as well, which I just can't place though. The taste is delicious. Molasses-sweet (but not too sweet) with almost a smokey hop finish. Solid mouthfeel. I think this is another excellent beer from Clipper City. This imperial stout will keep you warm in the fall and winter. Give it a try."
"D: much smoother and drinkable than I thought would be, for an imperial stout you could have a few of them rather than drinking one and being full."
"One of two bottles acquired in ""These go to eleven...a bif"" from goodbyeohio. The other will sit until later this winter. The label is notched as best by August 2006."
"Brownish black, creamy head...looks a bit thin for an RIS. Smells like lemongrass, hops and coffee grains and sweet chocolate. Taste is chocolatey mainly with some raspberry/cherry flavors and a fair bit of raw sweetness. Thin mouthfeel for an Impy. A good rendition of the style based on the flavor, but the mouthfeel makes it more like just a sweet stout. Not bad though overall and i'd certainly have another go at it (and i'll have my chance, i've two more from the mix pack i got)."
"My very first drink, I noticed a ""piney"" hop flavor. I had a few of these and it was not as strong afterwards, but was noticed at first. The taste was good and smooth, but not very complex. Not a whole lot to figure out here. At $8 for a six pack, it's a decent ""crunk for your buck"" value play."
"D: Very easy to drink and very tasty. I can't believe this has an ABV of 8% because I sure couldn't tell. It would be easy to down quite a few of these without knowing how much you just drank. Very good. I'm going to have to get me some more of these."
"Thin, but smooth with a roasted coffee sensation with just a touch of ripened dark fruit sweetness. Long bitter finish with some fig characteristics. More of a baltic porter than imperial stout. 8% abv is nicely masked which makes this one go down easy, though there is a subtle warming effect once it hits the stomach."
"12 oz. bottle. This is my first imperial stout, so review may be useless. Dark brown in color, some ruby highlights. Modest, light brown head. Aroma was of sweet malt and raisins. Flavor was slightly toasted malt with a little bit of coffee flavor. Hops were not very aggressive, and contributed a little bittering in the finish. It did tie nicely with the other flavors to create a well balanced taste. Mouthfeel was medium body and very smooth, with fairly low carbonation. This was an enjoyable beer, but from what I have read, it was not really to style. So, objectively I scored it lower. Subjectively, I would have another any time."
"I had this 7 months after suggested expiry date. It was pitch black with no head, very well malted with some chocolate and decent carbonation, medium plus mouthfeel. A bit sour finish, not to be completely unexpected. Roast and coffee aroma and not bad, underrated."
"Sadly, I'm not diggin this so much. I remember having this at Kennet a few years ago and enjoying it...was it barrel aged when I had it??? I remember something standing out then but this is less than stellar."
"Drinkability: I could enjoy a six-pack of this easily. These are not sweet, so I could drink a few in a row. However, given a choice between this and other stouts, I think I might go with something that has a bolder flavor."
"The 8% is very well hidden, and I would luv a few more of these  just remove the Imp Stout designation."
"Bottle tagged as Oct 06 so I assume it's the new recipe."
"Drinkability is average to above average in my book. Again, chilled this one is a bit easier to drink. At room temp, the alcohol comes out a bit more killing off some flavor. The next one I have will be chilled for a bit."
"extremely tasty but not overwhelming for the style or belly-filling (easily consumed in succession with pleasure)... watch out for the 8%..."
"Likely the most drinkable RIS i've ever had. Pours out to a dense black color that turns to dark ruby red when held to the light. Small head of brown foam, lower level of carbonation. Aromas are powerful and consist of hops, cocoa, and roasted malts. Nice. Taste is very unique for an imperial stout, yet still quaffable; roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, hops, grain, earthy notes of wood. Alcohol isn't noticeable, making this one a creeper (creeps up on you). Nice. Mouthfeel was light and slightly smooth. Drinkability is north of average. Not what comes to mind when discussing a RIS, yet it's got it's moments. Worth a try. Special thanks goes out to HimerMan for the sample."
"overall- i think clipper city accidently put down imperial stout rather then baltic porter. While this is has a great flavor and im really enjoying it, its just way off target for a RIS. If this was classified as a different style, it would have much better ratings."
"Ok. I like this one. Not so much to style, but a good dark complex beer nevertheless. Catch me on a cold winter night and I might like it a bit more."
"This one is very drinkable. Light enough to have a few of these. Again, this is good beer just not quite an RIS to me."
"Cheers."
"Pours dark, dark brown..very good head, great lacing. Light malt, hop undertones...very understated. Taste is somewhat one dimensional..strong malt, some hops at the end...dissappointing. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy. Drinkability is avearge, with some alcohol hit in the finish. Not a good representation of the style."
"D - high, and easyily pounded stout"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted scent that boasts of chocolate and roasted malts along with a slight patent malt earthiness. The taste is decent as well. It has a very dry dark malt flavor that goes down slow and finishes with some roasted malt overtones. It's not too intense and seems a bit calm for an Imperial Stout. It's more like a high powered brown ale. It lacks the rich black malt content although there seems to be quite a bit of chocolate malt present. The mouthfeel is fine. It is above average. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinker, but a poor example of an IS."
"Very drinkable and easygoing for an imperial stout. While the mouthfeel is lighter than most other imperial stouts the complexity is still there. It is, however, a bit watery. Still, recommended."
"D - Clipper City surprises me yet again. The beer isn't too complex, but it is a joy to drink for certain. Too strong to session. I wouldn't mind another though. It is a good beer, not the greatest stout, but a solid fall back for certain."
"D: Pretty easy going. Not what I would buy/drink when looking for a RIS (or any stout for that manner), but an interesting venture."
"Green, thin, soda-like. Refreshing RIS? This is an over-hoppy American Stout. I'll be fine iwth one."
"I can't emphasize enough how disappointed I am with this beer. I hope Loose Cannon DIPA and Below Decks Barley Wine have more in common with the first three Heavy Seas beers that crossed my palate than with this one. When it comes to calling Peg Leg an Imperial Stout, Clipper City doesn't have a leg to stand on."
"pours a dark brown with a light tan head in a stein mug. color is too light for an imperial stout. head seems too light as well, but sticks down the glass. aroma is very much like a good stout. chocolatey and coffee aromas. not huge, but nice. first taste is sweet with chocolate and a touch of vanilla. there are some balancing hop bitterness. not overly complex. flavor reminds me of a sierra nevada stout. not very big at all. the alcohol that you normaly experience in an imperial stout is missing. finishes sweet with a chocolatey caramel flavor. mouthfeel is a bit light. a little too crisp. carbonation is good and swallow clunks a bit for an impy stout. drinkability is excellent for an impy stout, but again, very much like a traditional american stout. goes down easily as the alcohol that's there is well hidden. overall, a very good beer. easy to drink and quite tastey for an american stout. but this is supposed to be an imperial. the ratings have to be downgraded based on style."
"This brew pours a slightly dark brown color (seems a bit light for the style) with a small head that is gone fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. Not impressive looking. The aroma is faint, but notes of coffee and chocolate are there. No hops in the nose. The flavor isn't impressive either. It has a biting bitterness and follows up with a hint of sour on top of a coffee backing. As it warms, the bitter bite draws back a bit and a little more chocolate comes forth, but it just doesn't have what it needs. The sourness was only present on the first sip, as I haven't noticed it since ... maybe that was a bad call on my part. The body is rather thin, but the drinkability is good. This isn't a bad beer, it's actually kinda tasty, but it needs a lot more 'umph' to make a good imperial stout. On another note, the alcohol is well hidden."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A moderately prickly carbonation offsets the bold, dark flavors going on. The beer leans heavily towards blackstrap molasses with its distinctive flavor, and that keeps me from enjoying this beer even more. I love the style, but this doesn't make me want another anytime soon."
"This one was little less strong, as I like my RIS, but that's what made it appealing to me. I guess you could kind of consider it a RIS Light. This one would be easy for those who can't handle a stronger tasteing beer, but still strong on the alcohol. This bad boy went down really easy, which makes it even more dangerous. Overall not an awesome RIS, but still not bad either. I would buy it again."
"The body is a medium feel and could stand some more body. The carbonation is high which may have something to do with it. Overall I would have liked more body and malt flavor but still a good beer. Plus it will make me say arrr for the next hour and a half."
"The only stinker in the Heavy Sea's line. A pathetic Imperial stout that should either be discontinued or reformulated. Yes very dark beer with a slightly off-white head and some lace. Smell was unimpressive as it had some markings of roasted malt and little else. The taste was like a middle of the road stout with a gelatin coating in my mouth. Some alcohol in the finish. Mostly this beer becomes like porter but its still too thin. Could I drink more sure, but would I pay a premium for this next year hoping it gets better? I can't give up on the locals but I refuse to support bad beers."
"Pours a very dark opaque brown, with just the slightest bit of light coming through at the bottom of the pint glass, a finger and a half of dense beige head, pretty decent retention, some spotty lacing. Nose is subdued, but is a pleasant blend of dark malt, caramel, and mocha. Taste is a little on the sweet side for an imperial, with sweet milk chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt dominating the flavor, giving way to a mild hop finish and a lingering roasted flavor. Alcohol comes through a little, more when served too cold. Body is too thin for an imperial stout, almost seems watery at times. Overall, this is a decent beer, but probably my least favorite of the Heavy Seas line, and since lots of brewer's make excellent imperial stouts, it's not one I buy often."
"Probably the lightest Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had. This reminds me of a milk/sweet stout. Decent flavors but off the mark for the style."
"Oh well, really enjoyed all of their other brews so far...this was was just ok for me."
"Throws a dark shoe brown, a near cola like appearance with a near non-existent, yet thin tan head. There is cocoa, chocolate and mild hops on the nose. Sweet caramel and roasted malts off the cuff; very thin mouthfeel. There is some smokey and sharp roasted coffee beans, yet they come and go before being palate-satisfied. Continues to be quiet thin bodied, a dry finish; leaving something to be desired; paper thin for 8.00ABV. An impy stout its not, yet a few could be enjoyed on a cold night. Average."
"Body is medium, smooth and sticky with a soft mouthfeel and fine carbonation."
"Probably the lightest stout I've ever poured. I was ready to be disappointed and was, a little. Mouthfeel is watery and a little sticky. Smells of coffee, caramel and a little chocolate. Taste matched the color. Much more watery than I had hoped of an imperial stout. Mostly tastes of watery coffee with mild carbonation. It's a good beer, just not what you would expect from this style."
"This pours a dark brown with a creamy two finger head.The smell is a light roasted malt with some sweetness.This has a real coffee taste and everything else is secondary.The other flavors are chocolate and a cola flavor and maybe a slight carmel.This does have a certain sweetness to it.The m/f is a little watery.This beer is too light for the type of beer it is.This is a pretty good porter and absolutely drinkable.I wouldn't mind trying another."
"Nice easy drinking beer. An enjoyable offering."
"This beer poured a dark brown to black and was topped by a thick tan head that showed great retention. The aroma has light espresso and a little chocolate. Some funky esters there too. Not sure what it is, but its giving it a little bit of a berry character. Taste seems very thin. Citrus orange, that funky fruit flavor and just a bit of espresso, no real chocolate in the flavor. As I already said, the mouth feel seems very thin, decent drinakbility."
"A bit of a disappointment overall. Not terrible, but could stand some improvement."
"Poured with little head that faded quickly and let a bit of light through so it was above average as a stout. It smelled rather bland, with nothing to grab my senses. A little alcohol smell and some of the malt scent, not much else. Mouth was very good, rich, very much the taste of the malts and alcohol took place. Rich chocolate and coffee flavors but it seemed a little thin in taste to me. It had very little aftertaste and didn't make a stong imperial image to me. Lots of other stouts out there, this one was good, but didn't rise above the pack."
"It was pretty drinkable, but disappointing as an Imperial Stout."
"Drinkability is OK not a bad dark beer just not a great Impy Stout. If your looking for a good Impy Stout I would look somewhere else."
"A clean brown beer with a lot of ruby highlights. Has a small creamy beige head. The aroma starts with a roasted malt character but a very nice nutlike note takes charge with hints of licorice in the background. The flavor begins with that nutlike character and slowly moves to a bit of chocolate. The finish is a roasted malt bitterness with a hint of licorice in the background."
"The beer poured a solid black with a nice tan head. The aroma was of dark fruits. The taste was a warming mix of malt and dark fruits. The feel was surypy and thick. This is what I look for most in an Imperial Stout, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. I will be picking some up in the near future."
"A dry Imperial eh? Pours nearly black with a wispy beige head and very little lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee and nuts, as well as a bit of chocolate. Medium-bodied with more of a Porter character than an Imperial Stout. Hops, raisins and malt flavors, with a bitter coffee aftertaste. Dry finish that is reminiscent of espresso. A decent beer but falls short in the category."
"Yarrr me mateys, this be a brew for a pirate. It's a good stout, but a bit weak for an imperial stout. I think this isn't a huge deal because it is a good bit easier to drink than most imperial stouts are which might be seen as a problem given its alcohol content."
"Coming in a 12oz. bottle with a notched in best by date of Jan 06, the beer poured way too thin and light brown for an Imperial stout. Didnt look bad in the glass sideways, but the short lived, thin, fizzy, brown head, and a lack of viscosity made for a rather puny looking Imperial Stout. The aroma was nicely hoppy and chocolaty, but not very roasty at all. The taste also continued along the same theme, with sweet toffee, pine sap, and chocolate fudge flavors, which made for a very interesting and drinkable beer. As tasty as it was, the lack of a chewy body just kept reminding me how far off style this was. More of an Imperial Porter, it is hard to dislike this sincere attempt at a big, dark, beer. I would keep drinking it, despite the mischaracterization on the label. A big plus is the complete lack of alcohol burn and a well hidden 8 percent strength by volume. Drinks easier than many regular Stouts. As an Imperial Stout, this has barely one leg to stand on."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body and full carbonation. Goes down pretty smooth and fills the mouth nicely. Still...this falls more along the lines of a standard stout to me. I could have a few in a sitting, but it's not one I'd really seek out. Thanks to goodbyeohio for the opportunity!"
"Most drinkable impy stout I've had thus far."
"Drinkability: I know this hasn't got great reviews but it works for me. It's definitely more along the porter end of things but it doesn't matter to me. I like stouts and porters both. I like the hop bitterness that I get here and there but I have to disagree with the brewer...certainly not an Imperial stout. Enjoyable none the less for me."
"12 oz bottle pours out a mahogany brown, but sits in the glass opaque and ebony. One finger khaki head retains well enough and leaves some minimal sheets of lace. Aroma is subdued, with a small measure of coffee, chocolate, and grassy hops. Mouthfeel begins creamy and full medium bodied, but thins way too much as the glass empties. Carbonation is crisp and moderately high for style. Taste is a bit jumbled. Mild notes of coffee and chocolate, but lacking dark roasty malt character, overall. Mild presence of grassy hops in the finish, but nothing substantial. Alcohol is concealed quite well, but this one just lacks any significant character to earn a decent score for drinkability. The USA produces the best imperial, or double, stouts in the world in my opinion. This one needs some recipe tweaking before it can aspire to any semblance of respectability."
"Notes: I sure hope afatty enjoys the glass this came in....that was the highlight of this beer."
"Overall, it's not a bad beer... but it needs a lot of work to become an Imperial Stout."
"This is kind of an easy drinking stout (oxymoron?), that has good features, just not that much of an what I usually think of for style. I really like the heaviness of the head and I enjoyed the nice roast flavors."
"It's not black. It's not full bodied. It's not full flavored. It's a travesty to call this an Imperial Stout."
"Cloudy dark brown with lots of particles floating around, small foamy tan head that leaves a some lacing in my glass, I can see through the glass when held up a light, never seen this in an Imperial Stout before. Roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty, chocolate, coffee flavors, finishes on the dry side ( wtf? ) Is this really an Imperial? Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel makes this very drinkable, this would be decent for a porter or dry stout, misleading."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy. Medium / heavy in body. The aftertaste has licorice and chocolate lasting briefly on the tongue. Drinkability is a touch above average on the scale, but not a brew I will be looking to try anytime soon."
"Pours a deep cola color with a thick light brown head. Out of the cask, this beer was pretty good. Let's see how the bottle pairs up. It has some noble roasty characteristics with a fair amount of chocolate, coffee, and tree bark. Faintly hoppy, only in whiffs nearer the finish. Residual sweetness rather chocolatey, moreso carob. Hop bitterness at a good level to achieve a good effect in the drinking experience, dry but not aggressive. A good, hefty stout, but not flawless."
"Poured nearly black, with some hues of red getting through. Had nice tan head that took a bit to fall and left clumps of lace on the glass. Had a mild scent of coffee, roasted malts and some chocolate, it takes a few deep sniffs to get the effect. The taste is of a bit of dark chocolate, and some roasted coffee and some hops at the end, but the flavor is not as strong as I would like. The mouthfeel was lacking a bit, but it was still smooth and creamy. I would say that this is a pretty drinkable beer."
"Poured a nice opaque black - but with little to no carbonation/lacing, save for a dusting close to the end of the pour. The nose has dark chocolate, mocha, and just a hint of an almost raisiny/port wine edge to it which is appealing. These flavors, except for that sweetness come out in the drinking, with an agreeable aftertaste. The mouthfeel runs a bit on the thin side, which I am guessing is rather the norm for a dry stout which is something I'm still getting used to. A well made session beer, and one I would consider putting on tap at home."
"Thanks to Blitheringidiot for shoving this bottle into my fridge!"
"Shame about the ""imperial stout"" typo on the label. This is a fine Robust Porter, however."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of light tan head over the dark brown, yet still translucent, brew. Dense head lasts well, and lacing is excellent. Aroma is lightly of dark malts, and that about it. Lacking in this area. Taste is somewhat sweet dark malts, and not much else. Not bad for any old brew, but one labelled as an Imperial Stout needs more than this going on. Mouthfeel is good and creamy, ignoring the stylistic issues, and drinkability is okay for the same reasons. Try this one for the brew, but not if you're looking for an Impy Stout..."
"Drinkability and Overall: Clipper City is slowly creeping up my list of favorite local breweries. I think they've done a great job with this stout. A smooth yet complex, but still highly enjoyable, ale that I could drink all night. I plan on setting a few back in my new cellar, so expect some more reviews soon."
"Beer is good. Happy supposed Impy Stout beering."
"Pours a dark brown; quite light for an Imperial Stout as it is advertised. Light, sticky light brown head. Lots of chocolate malt on the nose. Very mild coffee tones. No hops. More coffee on the palate, along with chocolate. High carbonation adds to a bitter and dry finish. Mouthfeel is very light for this style. Light, dry and bitter. An OK beer, but I would call this false advertising. This is a stout, but there is nothing imperial about it. No need to waste money on this one."
"Overall, this is a pretty good Imperial style Brown Ale, and maybe a passable Baltic porter. As an imperial stout, it is disappointing. It has little of the big body, roasty aroma, or burnt, fruity, roasty flavor one expects in an imperial stout."
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"Drinkability is OK. Seems to well-made beer. Some good malt notes and decent amount of bittering just too light for style advertised."
"sampled a 12 ouncer with notched freshness dating on the label. Pours a very dark brown, with some light coming through. Head was darkest of tan, leaves some lacing. Nose of musty malt. This is a dark and muddy brew, some burnt flavors, mocha, coffee, chocolate notes. Does not, as expressed in other reviews, exhibit, the deep, rich, maltyness nor burnt malt flavors nor over abundance of complexity expected and hoped for in an Imperial stout. this is more like a rich porter or decent stout. nevertheless this is a worthy brew, just not to the style advertized."
"Appearance: Pours a dark caramel brown tone seems thin and a bit porterish in the pour definitely not your typical imperial stout. It does form a nice sized moccha tan head leaving ample lacing around my pint glass. Aroma: Light chocolate, caramel, and chocolate notes along with an herbaceous hop profile, seems a bit repressed with minimal fruit tones shining through. Taste: This brew was more reminscient of a roasty brown ale or your run of the mill porter rather than an Impy Stout. No one taste jumps out at me reminiscient of somebody's first attempt homebrewing their own Imperial Stout where they underestimated the malt bill completely. Chocolate, coffee, tart raisin, touch of vanilla compromises many of the flavors I can pick out once again leaving me with an herbal tea note for a hop profile. Mouthfeel: Thin and light bodied for the style maybe good for beginners in craft brew but hard to consider this brew a true imperial style stout, I mean c'mon a light bodied imperial stout isn't that some sort of contradiction. Unoffensive on many levels nice even carbonation not much else to note. Drinkability: Easy to consume not very challenging to my senses, and not the big beer I was looking for."
"The low ratings of this beer seem slightly out of place. While it's not in style as an imperial stout, it is a damn nice dry stout. Body was a little lacking, but the flavor was there, save for the fruity vinuous aspects you'd expect from a impy stout. I like it."
"Always nice to see a local big beer like an Imperial Stout come out. This poured out an oily black with about an inch of tan head. The head had decent retention and scattered lace was left as I drank this. Aroma was of chocolate, a bit of fruit and a touch of alcohol. Not to strong or complex, but not bad. Flavor is similar with a chocolate malt sweetness being dominate. A bit weak for an Imperial Stout, maybe a porter or regular stout but this is the smallest tasting Imperial Stout I have had. There were some roasty notes on the finish. Mouthfeel was silky with a medium body. Decent drinkability as a beer but not as a RIS. Its maybe a light Imperial Stout but not what it claims. A good beer though in its own right I would have it again knowing what to expect the next time."
"This is more like a ""single porter"" than a ""double stout"". Dark red on the pour and certainly not opaque. The aromas are good and are that of a watered down imperial stout. I nose coffee, caramel, vanilla, a bit of oak, chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is good but too light for the style. Where are the deep fig, kurrant, and burnt malt flavors? The mouthfeel is super thin for any sort of stout, but for what it is the drinkability remains good. A decent beer, but definately not to style."
"Pours a mucky brown color with red highlights. Notes of coffee and sweet malts in the nose, with a dry astringency and thin carbonation in the mouthfeel. Sweet chocolate notes and some mild roastiness but the flavor is lacking, as is the body. As a beer, its average. As an Imperial Stout, it's really lacking. Better off portrayed as an English porter."
"Overall a decent beer."
"12 ounce bottle, best before Feb 05. One of the Heavy Seas seasonals from Clipper City which have become favorites. A bit of a sleeper beer. Missing body for an Imperial Stout, it is nonetheless a very nice an drinkable beer. The alcohol is not present in aroma, flavor or finish so tread lightly. Would have probably been better presented as a Baltic Porter."
"Had this one on tap at Max's. Beer was a deep brown/light black in color. poured with very little head. Smell was not overpowering, but provided some good malty notes. Initial taste revealed some buttery notes with just a hint of roasted malt in the back end. Alcohol taste was present, but not unbalanced with the beer. Pretty good mouthfeel, aided by the low carbonation. Very easy and undemanding to drink."
