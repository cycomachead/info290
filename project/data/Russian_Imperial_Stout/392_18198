4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep inky black with a thick-ish light tan head. The head has limited retention and leaves very slight sticky lacing. The aroma is bourbon forward, with hints of vanillin and roasted malt. The taste is on the lighter side, but still has all the characteristics of the aroma, nicely melded together. The body is lighter, as well, with a nice slickness and a little alcohol tingle.","delta490","Mar 18, 2015"

This looked and smelled nice enough, but seemed way too sweet, with an odd mix of dark fruit and toffee. Did not seem to be well complemented by it's time in the barrel. Besides the flavor profile that was a bit disjointed, the body was way too thin for what this beer is trying to be. Thankfully I had an Insanity on hand to rinse the taste out of my mouth and make me forget what I just drank.","glass_house","Mar 11, 2015"

4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/3/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky earthiness. Light roast/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky bitterness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged imperial stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. The barrel character is very pronounced, but not overdone. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"

I thought there would be subtle differences based on his recommendation. Anyways, I liked both of them but old heathen is definitely more my style. This thing was like a sour stout. It was super carbonated. I started noticing the barrel taste more and more as it warmed up. Interesting beer for sure, good, not my favorite but I did enjoy it.","mikecollins50","Oct 05, 2014"

Actually tasting more like a barrel aged sour than a stout. Thin, tart and simple. Not a good effort from Weyerbacher, which usually excells... Maybe it was a bad batch, but avoid the 2/14 bottling....","JasonHaviland","Oct 02, 2014"

It reminds me of a really badly root beer flavored dum-dum. I'll say it's ok. But that's my whiskey unfriendly palate saying so, keep in mind.

In fact, Heresy is quite complex and possesses a unique character all its own. What's more, it possesses a high drinkability and stands to be the first barrel-aged beers I can have more than one in a sitting. In order to best enjoy this beer, I suggest drinking it as close to room temperature as possible and pour it with enough vigor to remove some of the carbonation. Since I did notice some faint sourness, I would suggest not aging this beer (or at a minimum this batch) since those flavors will get stronger as time goes on. (3.75)","threeviews","May 28, 2014"

This is my first offering from Weyerbacher and over all I enjoyed it but, I thought the alcohol was a sharp and a bit over powering for an 8% beer and distracted from the subtle nuances of the finish. I also feel the barrel character was a bit one dimensional. I got a lot of wood but none of the other flavors I have come to expect from a stout aged in whiskey barrels (Vanilla, caramel, toffee.) I would be curios to see if this beer would hold up for a couple of years to see the finish balance out a bit. Again, I did enjoy the beer and was glad I got a chance to try it.

I've always taken this for granted and decided to finally give it a shot. I'm pretty glad I only bought a single, it's not bad by any means at all, it just tastes a bit immature on the oak aging.

4.1,4.3,4,4,4,5,4,"Overall: Seems to be an underrated bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout. I don't know how long they age in barrels for but its got a nice thick, sweet molasses mouthfeel that's different than most others I've had which tend to be more thinner but creamy vanilla. I'm starting to question whether I prefer the former or the latter. At the price point ($10/4pk), its really hard to argue with the value of this brew. I would recommend it for people who are interested in a cheaper but incredibly tasty bourbon barrel stout that isn't overwhelming with the bourbon heat, i.e. a cheaper, slightly more sessionable weekday night option.

I think I was hoping for the magic of Weyerbacher Insanity in a stout form, but this didnt quite live up to the bill.

It had a really good start, but it doesn't have the sweetness that a bourbon barrel stout finishes with. This one was a bit drier, but it still was a welcome surprise in my birthday six pack. I would definitely recommend it because it IS delicious, but I would probably only drink one or two glasses at most if I was out.","Wluper","Apr 14, 2013"

This is the first I've seen from this year's batch but the brewery is right around the cornor. Best by Nov18 13 date which I assume to mean a Mar. 18 bottle date. Only the slightest hint of cola colored highlights when held to the light. Nice oak nose, with vanilla, allspice and coffee hints. There's alot of lacing lingering on my selinsgrove tulip. It's thin for RIS, but it's smooth and drinkable. The flavor starts with oaky vanilla, a hint of bourbon, black licorace finishes with a roasty malt char. There's not the slightest bit of harshness from the bourbon but a hop bitterness which I expect would fade away.","templar316","Apr 04, 2013"

Taste- vanilla from the oak, milk chocolate, roasty notes. This is so smooth, and so mellow. I also cant believe how well this pairs with the brownie, esp the vanilla ice cream. The vanilla notes and the oak is really what makes this stout a standout. The complexity of the roast, oak, and coffee/chocolate that you get from a RIS is all there, but this is unique.

The nose is a little quiet for a big beer, but it is heavy on star anise, with a bit of vanilla-sweetened chocolate as well. Licorice, a flavor I'm only really happy to see in small doses in a stout, is still the star of the show. Sweet milk chocolate and vanilla are what jump out next. Oak and bourbon come in to bring something new to the table for the close. The body has a nice creamy edge to it, but it's relatively low ABV for the style corresponds to a mouthfeel that's not quite as full as a lot of its counterparts. The carbonation is spot on though, namely subtle and out of the way. Weyerbacher Heresy is one of the more cost friendly, relatively available barrel aged imperial stouts out there, and it's a great value buy.

Aroma is rich with an obvious bourbon scent, roasted malts, creamy chocolate, and molasses. After a big sip I can taste the bourbon, a figgy sort of flavor, and a splash of hops. There is an initial graininess that disappears quickly. The finish adds some complexity as it reveals the earthy barrel flavor. It does indeed leave me wanting more. This beer really coats the mouth in an ideal fashion - it has a milky or oily characteristic that sticks. It warms the belly on its way down.

Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, notes of bourbon and red wine. Taste of dark chocolate and rich caramel, some vanilla, more of the boozy bourbon and wine notes from the aroma, tinges of roasty malts and coffee.

The taste overall was different than what I expected but very nice and very favorable. The mouthfeel is carbonated and isnt thick or slick.

Cocoa was about the only present scent, and it was faint at best. The taste is just...so undistinguished. There's not a lot going on at all. In fact, I struggle to pull out any typical flavor associated with a stout. It's just...bland. Alcohol is about the only thing detectable. The mouthfeel is the least impressive aspect of this beer. It's so thin, I feel like I'm drinking a weak cup of coffee. Overall, this isn't something I have any desire to come back to. I have 3 more bottles left.

Lots of luscious chocolate along with some roasted coffee, toffee, nut and oatmeal. Really smooth and quaffable, especially considering the amount of bourbon flavor.

The smell is of immediate oak and bourbon with roasted malt and coffee tones following. Faint hints of cocoa and smoke. The taste has ashy burnt malt up front and oak and bourbon in the back with no middle. The sweet that should be center is missing. Faint hint of dry cocoa meshed with burnt roasty flavors, smoke and bourbon don't meld well. Faint hint of vanilla trys to salvage but just isn't enough.

The nose is dominated by the offerings given by the barrels. Butterscotch, oak and vanilla. The taste is quite the same with a roasty exception. Pretty damn sweet up front but not really cloyingly so. Butterscotch, vanilla, roasted malt and chocolate are the big players in the taste. The bitter chocolate is carried throughout the aftertaste and mellows into a sweeter cocoa taste. Yum. The mouthfeel is pretty velvet like with a nice carbonation level. Very sticky as well, coating my palate. Big bodied beast for sure. Overall, great bourbon flavor upfront packs a punch without masking the roasty, chocolate flavors offered by the stout before barrel aging. Thanks again Rich!","ChugginOil","Jun 13, 2011"

It's odd: though this stout is ostensibly -bal aged I've only thought to address that element twice, once in the aroma and once now - needless to say the bourbon factor is minor to the point of being undetectable.

Strong roasted flavors with hints for dark fruits and berries and notes of chocolate and bourbon,oak,and hints of vanilla make for a nice complexity. But all the flavors are nicely balanced.

Some sips it comes together and some it doesn't. When it's good, the vanilla and oakiness, meld well with the roast and chocolate and go down smooth and easy. When it's not working for me, there is a bit of booziness/faint bitterness or oak astringency in the finish that is unpleasant. The mouthfeel is affected negatively by that oakiness that sits on the tongue and a somewhat thinner than expected body. Overall, this is pretty good with moments of greatness and a slight upgrade for the can't miss price.","seeswo","Apr 15, 2011"

The aroma of some highly roasted malts give off this burnt smell to the beer which is countered by the Barrel Aging which adds a sweetness to the nose. The taste is all imperial stout. The burnt and roasted malts kick you in the face right off the bat, then it starts to tingle with some hops and the bourbon barrel finishes it off with a very light sweet vanilla flavor and some fresh wood.

The taste is of roasted malt with a hint of wood, and cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a texture that comes across as watery for an Imperial Stout.

A good amount of vanilla and some bourbon too though I am not sure if this is a bourbon barrel. Either way it's got vanilla, oak, molasses, sugar cane, roasted chocolate notes. Not really coffee forward, though it does have soke bitterness onnthe backend slightly. There is a real big boozy flavor, like whiskey burn almost that is not integrated well into this beer at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied for a ris but it's got a big dry alcohol burn on the finish. Not the most drinkable and the 8 percent abv is not hidden well at all.

Mouthfeel, I have to say this is where this beer falls off. It's just too thin for an oak aged imperial stout. It has almost a cola like mouthfeel with the carbonation that quickly withers away.

The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, vanilla, molasses, oak, and a tinge of bourbon. The taste emphasizes the vanilla, roasted malts, and bourbon, while the chocolate is toned down and dried out. There is an ever-so-slight sour-ish tinge at the end, possibly the by-product of the barrel and some age. The body is a very light heavy (or a heavy medium...it's tough to decide), with a light carbonation and a silky smooth feel.

"Angelic" is the operative word here, as this beer is nothing short of heavenly. Immediately to the nose comes alcohol and dark fruit, especially raisins, prunes, and red apple. A subtle spiciness permeates the aroma, not unlike cumin and cinnamon, reminiscent of a fresh apple pie. Slightly thinner than many imperials I have tried, with very light lacing. Hits the palette with immediate strong bittersweet chocolate and cinnamon. Also, vanilla, mallow, and a very slight bitterness of a weak black coffee. A subtle finish of dates, licorice, and alcohol soon follows. Mouthfeel is smooth with immediate but subtle brown sugar sweetness with hints of molasses, followed by a residual fuzzy dryness. Overall this is a fantastic and complex beer, and in the running for my favorite imperial stout. As I write, a delayed and delightful aftertaste of spicy Cabernet is hitting the nose. A lovely, lovely beer.","jballeng","May 01, 2010"

Some vanilla, oak, chocolate and a whiff of alcohol to the nose. For an an Imperial stout, it has a medium body. The flavor is good, but I think it suffers a bit from the lack of a fuller body.

4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a small goblet at the Lion's Pride. The beer has a very dark brown color. The foamy head is also brown, and it leaves some patchy lacing as it recedes. This beer is very opaque; no light whatsoever can get through. It looks like a good RIS should look. Most of the aroma is made up of a tasty, warm bourbon smell. I can also make out toasted malts and some oakiness, which was probably infused in the barrel aging process. This is what I think a bourbon barrel aged stout should smell like. The taste is immediately sweet, with a bit of crystal sugar that I can pick up as soon as the beer touches my tongue. This sweetness is quickly overpowered by all of the other flavors this beer has. I can taste smooth chocolate, toasted malts, and a good bourbon character. The sweetness is detectable again in the aftertaste, but also present is dark chocolate bitterness and bourbon. This is a very tasty stout. The beer is sticky and sweet, but not exceptionally full-bodied. There is a low level of carbonation. The bourbon gives each sip a slight burn, but it isn't that bad at all. I find the balance of sweetness and ABV to be quite good. In fact, for such a strong flavored beer, this is quite drinkable. My one glass goes down very well. I don't think I would have more than one or two servings of this beer in an evening because it is fairly intense; it's worth savoring. I want to seek out and pick up a few bottles of this to have on hand.","ToasterChef","Apr 27, 2010"

Smell is of dark roasted grains supported by whiffs of burbony booze and dry wood, faint touch of chocolate and prune. Taste is a rather mellow blend of burnt grains, dark chocolate, burbon, dry wood with neary a hint of the dark fruit that i detected in smell. No vanilla from the oak - odd. I was expecting bold and got mellow. Dry, fuller side of medium bodied, slightly creamy, minimal boozy aftertaste, some sips border on watery.

The aroma is a bit of harsh bourbon and some oak - some alcohol, not super deep or complex, but with obvious vanilla, wood, and tannins. The flavor is big sweet malt up front with a hint of sour followed quickly by mild oak and bourbon characteristics including vanilla, wood, and tannins. This is then followed by stout flavors including mild dark chocolate and an obvious dose of coffee flavors.

Aside from the expected roasted malt notes there's a touch of treacle and a spicy sweetness. The taste, however, is not muted, and there's nothing wrong with this. Its a by the book imperial stout, and doesn't call upon any extra bells and whistles to enhance its character. Strong roasted coffee notes dominate at first, before giving way to bittersweet chocolate, and a decently bitter, warming finish. Medium full body has a pleasant creaminess to it, and the restrained carbonation is about right.

I get some bitter chocolate and a little coffee bean in the flavor along with the strong roasted malt.

Oaky, a bit of chocolate as well. Pretty sweet all the way through, not a huge grain sugar sweetness like some, but it's more on the sweeter side than the roasty bitter side. I don't really get that bitter kick in that respect. However, it's really on the lighter side for a big stout. Kinda thin, if not watery. The flavors are great, but there isn't much depth to them, they don't linger to any great extent. It's like stopping after the first 3 acts of a 4 act play. Medium body, very light for a stout.

The level of bitterness is also relatively low, and this allows the excellent malty character to shine through. At the back of all of this is a subtle, smooth oak note that is a nice change of pace from the extreme wood flavor that one often sees in barrel aged beers.

The nose is super-rich sweet coffee ice cream, milk chocolate and carob, soft and creamy presence with raisin and maraschino cherry fruit accents, impressive staying power if monochrome. Full-bodied and even more dependent on coffee, buttered toast, chocolate, caramel flavors. The raisin, date, fig flavors keeps the sweetness coming. The roast subordinate to the toast. Hard to tease out any hop influence. Carbonation could stand to be a little higher. That said, moves well and never gets "stuck." Smooth like a road grader came through.

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I tend to pick this beer up very rarely, but after sampling it tonight at Winchester Wine and Spirits during their weekly beer tasting, I felt the need to purchase a bottle. The sample I tasted there had this wonderful and unusual flavor of chocolate and peanut butter (ala Reeses). The bottle was poured in to a Duvel snifter. No light could penetrate this beer, black as hell with one fingers worth of light tan head. Dark bitter chocolate, mild whiskey, subtle dark fruit, marshmallow, and a hint of coffee bean come through in the nose. Vanilla is the first flavor to hit the palate, followed by powdered chocolate, black strap molasses and an oak complexity unmatched by some of the best examples of this style. Mouthfeel is hefty, but perhaps a tad light for an oak aged Imperial Stout. Very little hop bitterness comes through, but the malt and oak characteristics make themselves very known. Drinking is good on this beer, although certainly one to sip, as the alcohol is there and will bite you if you're not careful. This is an exemplary stout from Weyerbacher. It might not blow you away, but I would be surprised if it did not at least impress you. Grab a bottle, drink it now, or cellar it, I imagine it will be excellent either way.

Rich full mouth-feel, though not viscous or sticky like some, with a fair bit of carbonation, more than is often seen in the style, but by no means does it hurt the beer. The carbonation along with the pleasing near-flawless flavor make this an extremely beer considering the full mouthfeel and abv.

Although sweet, there is just a hint of dryness on the mid palate, which makes this beer all the more drinkable. On the impressive finish, I even pick up a trace of cherry along with the chocolate and coffee. The beer is surprisingly drinkable, and I have to say I appreciate the fact the abv. is "only" 8%.

The Heresey pours into the snifter black as night with a full creamy head that holds nicely leaving lace down the glass. The head certainly holds better than the old heathen, and that had a much harder pour. The aroma is dominated by the oak, which gives it a woody and vanilla like smell. Buried in there though, is the faint smell of roasted chocolate malt. In comparison, the Old Heathen, has the aroma of very sweet chocolate. Once the beer hits the mouth, the woody oak hits once again followed by a nice balance of vanilla and roasted chocolate. The woodiness also balances out the sweetness of the Old Heathen. There is a full thick mouthfeel with this one; a bit thicker than the Old Heathen. Overall, very drinkable. A great Imperial stout that uses the oak in moderation.

The taste is thick and dark with a very strong bourbon presence. The bourbon presence subsides as you drink it, but begins as very strong and mellows with each sip. Again changing, the mouthfeel goes from thick and creamy to thin and watery, very interesting. This is not the best beer I have ever had but definitely worth revisiting for its superior complexity.

Yes, there's sweet malt and roast grains, but these other smells were quite noticable. Fortunately, it tastes quite good. Starts sweet with caramel and coffee, then a tang that could be black patent. Not a cherry sour like I know black patent can add to a beer, it's much smoother. Licorice was strong and chocolate was mild. Roast is present as a noticable base, not as a flavor that rises and falls. There is a nice caramel and toffee that sort of blends everything together.

The flavors are more complex. Initially there's a sharp hop bite with some cherry and vanilla notes. The flavors attenuate bringing out chocolate flavors, with some scattered oak and coffee notes. The lingering finish is reminiscent of fine dark chocolate. It's quite delightful, but I'm a sucker for chocolate. The mouthfeel is peculiar.

4.3,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a jet-black inky color that when held to the light showed an outline of cocoa brown all around the edges, and as thick and dense to not allow any light to pass through. With several pours the average created a tiny foam head that was cocoa brown in color somewhat thin, slightly creamy and sticky at times, but not long lasting. With a vigorous pour, I noticed the head as a thick and rich and a few inches tall, with medium sized carbonation bubbles packed somewhat densely, but not long lasting either as it also fell to nothing less then a ring on the edges of the glass. At times I noticed some lace trying to form, but nothing much then a mere small group of carbonation bubbles trying to hold on. Also noticeable was that this beer seemed to be fairly carbonated. The aromas that it gave off were at first of a bourbon/whisky-esk note, not overly powerful but definitely noticeable, it blended with aromas of cocoa powder, fresh cut/split vanilla bean, the wooden oak barrel it was aged in (this was noticeable all through the nose), a wistershire sauce, some dark fruits, caramel, earth tones near the end, oat grains, dark malts and then it finished up with the warmth of alcohol tingling the nose. The first sip was surprisingly sweet with tones of alcohol and bourbon. But after the second tasting I noticed that it still had some sweet tones but all the flavors came forth: alcohol bourbon, sweet chocolate, caramel, fresh vanilla, a dry wood  the oak barrel, earth tones, slate and ash and coal where noticeable all through out, near the middle to back of the swallow more chocolates dark malts, dark sweet fruits and finally ended with dry cocoa, ash and alcohol flavors. One think noticeable was that the bourbon was all through out the taste. After each swallow I was left with warmth of alcohol. The body was medium to slightly heavy at times as it warmed up even more. It was smooth and creamy overall. I tried this beer first directly from the case that was sitting out on the floor of the distributor room temperature and was wowed. I stuck the case in the fridge when I got home and tried one at the cooler temp and was not impressed, it tasted like the Weyerbacher Imperial Stout, good but not what I was looking for, so I determined that room temperature was the way to go to bring out all the flavors that were supposed to be there. Over all I liked this beer, a good sipping beer, and a good experiment from the brewery and brewer. I cant wait for the next oak barrel series with one of there other beers. I would drink again on a cold day. Also I would like to add that I rather liked the label, and the name as well. Seems to fit.","Jarod","Oct 24, 2004"

3.93,0,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"This stout by Weyerbacher has a very distinct whiskey smell that is much stronger than its actual presence in the flavor. Low carbonation gives the pour a very shallow head. It has a lot of dark chocolate characteristic with a slightly smoky finish from the oak barrel aging. This beer should definately be served in small servings and would pair nicely with a black forest torte for a desert course. Overall, it is worth the pricetag, especially for the uniqueness of the oak barrel aging and the whiskey notes that it imparts.","micahwilly","Sep 20, 2004"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This review is from the 12 oz bottled version, though having this from the tap was a wee bit better. This brew is extremely thick, deep and viscous, black with a thin tan head that quickly recedes to a thin ring sticking to the edges of the glass. Flavor pales in complexity to the aroma; vanilla, burboun whiskey, chocolate, toffee, taffy all present in the nose. A slightly off woody flavor encompasses each sip, blending with the domination of burnt maltiness and the subtle vanilla and alcohol. The draught version seemed to be fuller and better balanced. One that I would have again either way though...good, but not exceptional.","IrishRedRock","Sep 12, 2004"
4.4,12,4,4,5,4,4,"I have to admit that Im a complete sucker for bourbon or whiskey aged Imperial stouts. Its perhaps the greatest combination of flavors in the alcoholic world, but this one is a bit different. Instead of smelling of the liquor and having that interesting vanilla flavor/aroma as a sideproduct, this bad boy tastes like it was aged in an oak cask once used to make vanilla extract with the whiskey being a side note. Theres also a LOT of oak involved in the flavor. This is much better than the plain Old Heathen. Chocolate dominates the malt.","aracauna","Sep 10, 2004"

I dont recognize the melon bubble-gum characteristics of the old heathen, but its fruitier than most, grapeish somewhat. Sweet palate full of vanilla and tartish woody, minty and roasty notes. It doesnt really have anything to set it apart from other barrel-aged imperials Ive had, but theyre all pretty good, arent they? Not so big bodied, lets call it medium bodied and carbonation is restrained. It doesnt have the grace of movements nor intensity of a speedway, but its also a good deal cheaper and a great value + easy to drink for the style.","Rastacouere","Sep 06, 2004"

There was scattered lace left around the glass as this was consumed. Scents of chocolate, Coffee, roasted malt and a light alcohol rose from the snifter. A bit of oak in the nose to add to the mix makes this an all around good smelling brew. Taste has most of the same elements as the nose with dark chocolate and a roasted malt flavor being dominant. The alcohol was only detected after this had warmed up a bit. Mouthfeel was good and creamy with a full body. Pretty good drinkability as well with this being a tasty brew and no characteristics that would keep me from revisiting this.

The problem is the oak shines through over the other flavors, it detracts some for me. I mean the Oak is a nice addition, but to much can kill.

But I'm doing this like all of my reviews, objectively. OK, that out of the way, it pours an opaque darkest brown color with a short-lived light to medium brown head. Roasty malts, black patent, bourbon and chocolate coated dark cherry aromas. Pretty intriguing, smells like the illegitimate offspring of a Manhattan and an imperial stout. It has the roasty qualities of Old Heathen like chocolate, coffee and caramel, but the sweetness of the residual bourbon from the barrels adds and interesting twist and extra dimension to the overall experience. The bourbon taste is not overwhelming, but its presence is surely noticable. Not bad. Carbonation is decent and drinkability is fair. I would have rather split it with a friend than to tackle this one by myself.","crookedhalo","Aug 23, 2004"

The aroma of powdered cocoa and vanilla was very strong and blocked out all other smells. The taste was a lot sweeter than I anticipated. It was full of vanilla, chocolate, raisin and pear flavors, followed by a distinct oak aftertaste. The hop bitterness was minimal, and the alcohol was quite well covered. The beer felt a bit weaker than an Imperial Stout should. It was approachable and complex, but lacked the boldness that should be the hallmark of an Imperial Stout.

The moment you pop the top, the smell of bourbon hits your face. That was not a good start for me. I quickly remember that I am not a fan of bourbon. The stout pours a pitch black color with a quickly dissipating head. It certainly looks like an Imperial Stout but the smell of bourbon and oak are too strong for me. I can detect some roasted malt aroma hiding in there somewhere. The first sip hits you with that strong bourbon taste with some sweetness behind it and it wasnt getting any better for me from there. I bought a 12oz bottle that I split with my girlfriend and that was too much for me. I had a real hard time finishing this one. If you are a bourbon fan, than this stout is for you.

2.61,-33.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Backwash: Sorry to resort (again) to a wine analogy, but this beer is much like a characterless bulk Chardonnay from Australia or California thats been oaked within an inch of its life! Now some Chardonnays can withstand a lot of oak (e.g. Beringer Private Reserve), but they need to be able to stand up to the wood. This doesnt do that. And worse, it has to contend with both the wood AND the bourbon. Supposedly this is Old Heathen aged in barrels used for both Jack Daniels (sour mash) and Jim Beam (bourbon). Im not a huge fan of Old Heathen to begin with, and it certainly doesnt improve here. I think it would be a lot better if the the oak and bourbon influences were reduced a bit (diluted with more regular Old Heathen and perhaps some plain oak barrels). Im a huge bourbon fan (less so JD), but this doesnt work very well. Perhaps some age will marry this better, but I cant recommend it for now. If you must, I'd recommend you add a nip of your favorite bourbon to your favorite stout.","Dantes","Aug 16, 2004"

Taste: A wave of soft milk chocolate with the whiskey barrel aging adding a complexity to this Imperial Stout that is just amazing. Smokey with hints of oak some strong espresso from dark roasts very big brew but enjoyable at the same time. Mouthfeel: Not as thick as I was anticipating medium bodied creamy textured very nice even carbonation making this a smooth sipper all the way. Drinkability: Overall I'm impressed with this Weyerbacher creation sometimes they don't do it for me but this one is truly innovative and delicious.

It just feels so good and smooth, almost like a cask conditioned. Dark and coffee flavors, but no burnt flavors. Great flavor without being overpowering. Beautiful oakiness. More of a vanilla extract flavor than of vanilla beans, most likely due to the 8% alcohol. This is such a great freaking stout and man is this just so easy to drink!","shapudding","Aug 12, 2004"

The bourbon barrel aging is surely evident. Which is good. It doesnt leave you guessing what that elusive flavor you might be detecting is. I think its just perfect in this beer.

It is also reminiscent of silage, for which you must be a farmer to understand. It is all of the spent grain and detritus from a harvest that is left to ferment in a silo before being fed to the animals. NOT an unplaeasnt smell, however, just sweet and earthy. The beer, itself, poured like motor oil - thick, viscous stuff that cried out to be tasted. It put me in mind of maple syrup in terms of the color.

This barrel aged version of Old Heathen is a dark black colour, that is nearly opaque. Their are slightly burnt bloody edges to this beer as well. The head is tan and lasts for quite some time. It really is a nice presentation. The aroma is of bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, heavy cream, chocolate, and mild espresso.
