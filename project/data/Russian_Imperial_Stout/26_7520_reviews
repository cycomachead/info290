"2013. Really sweet stout. Fruity finish with dates and raisins."

"2010 vintage at a share on 3/27"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can see why this beer has such an infamous reputation. It's a big ass imperial stout with flavors turned WAY up. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I got to try it, but there are much better options out there."

"2014 bottle. Wanted to like this but it was sickly sweet and a mess of malt and soy sauce. Poured most of it out. Hope with age the cloying sweetness mellows."
"Huge soy sauce and plum aroma up front that softened over time. Once it warmed up a bit, it became eminently drinkable and quite tasty. Does not taste at all like a 15% abv beer. A very impressive brew."
""
"Poured dark mahogany with a thin tan head.  Aroma is dark fruit and booze.  Flavor is surprisingly sweet with dark fruit and chocolate.  Some roasted caramel and anise on the finish.  Body is full - almost syrupy.  Coats your mouth with delicious flavor.  Hard to believe it 15% ABV, it hides it well.  Overall, I really enjoyed this."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich and thick. Overall, very good."
""
""
""
"O: this beer was worth the wait, wow, the aroma and the feel are spot on with the top non BA stouts out there. Really enjoyed this, look forward to more in the future"

"Was very excited to drink this beer and was hoping for it to stand out among the many imperial stouts of today's world. I wasn't at all prepared for the blast of dark fruitiness that hit my taste buds at first sip. It's almost overwhelming, but disguises the booze so nicely and differentiates this one from others. It has a really pleasant and mild finish that makes it easy to drink. Overall, a great experience."
"Overall, what an experience!!  To be in his presence at last is such a lovely thing.  You hear the rumors, but even after assessing his aroma, you aren’t satisfied that they may be true.  The nose is sweet, yes, but not overly cloyingly so.  It has the fruit, the coffee, and sugariness, but they blend to a harmonious end.  Then, you sip.  The sugars hit your teeth, and you reel backwards.  At first, it is admittedly shocking, but the more you give into it, the more it warms you, drawing you in.  You begin to appreciate the cloy for what it is, and by the end of the glass you are stuporously happy.  Still, you find yourself yearning, reaching for balance in the world through the foggy darkness.  You beg for each and every one of those fifteen perfect to dive in and pull you from the sugary muck.  They only come as rumbles from the depths of the gullet; they do not ride across the top, where you wish them to be found.  We are sad to see him depart, and as our only vintage we have no basis of comparison, but perhaps a younger beast would help quell some of his uncharacteristic sweetness.  Rest easy Dark Lord, and thank you."

"Very disappointed by this beer, had high hopes for it, especially considering the rave reviews and other good Three Floyds stouts I've had it the past. Overly sweet, no balance."
""
""
""
"Nice dark malt aroma. Very disappointing flavor, almost like soy sauce. Good dark head with decent mouthfeel. Extremely lacking for the style."
""
""
""
""
"First time trying DL. Opened the 2012 with high expectations. Exceeded on all accounts. Phenomenal brew"
"O- the oxidization is definitely bringing out some cherry/sherry notes on both the taste and aroma.  Definitely a sipper as it is one hell of a sweet beer"
""
"Overall world class. Reviewed from phone."
""
"2013, new label with orange wax."
"I really liked this beer."
""
"Tasted on 3 different occasions. 2014 release. This beer had a vey nice coffee punch for the better half of the year following release.  Upon release - roasted coffee, chocolate and slightly sweet.  Notes of soy sauce now with a more present smokiness."
""
"Pours a medium brown with little head. Thin for the style. A sweetness I prefer for a barleywine."

"Pours thick, black. Immediate boozy smell but 2014 finished very sweet with chocolatey but fruity taste. I would have rated higher but it's a little sweet this year. Looking forward to Dark Lord Day in April!"

"Tried the 2011 that I got in a trade.  Very dark and thick in appearance.  Taste was a bit too sweet at first but it improved significantly as it sat.  Mouthfeel was good but not great, somewhat thin.  Alcohol was well-concealed for a 15% beer.  Overall, I am glad I was able to try this beer; however, it's not one of my favorites and I probably wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Awful 2013. Way too sweet for a Russian Imperial Stout. Big sugar hit followed by molasses and vanilla. The amount of work to obtain this beer does not justify the result. If it was easy to buy, this would be a drain pour. Better luck on the variants, or future bottlings. Sorry!"

"2013. I ignored others in this one. I've always heard it tasted like suger and soy sauce. Open this up and was still carb'd. Poured into a snifter (Karbach) to a very thin head. Nice dark color. Then it hit the nose. SWEETNESS?! Odd I thought. Especially for the style that is stated. I smell molasses, raisins, and SWEETNESS!  It's over powering. Next the taste. It hits the tongue and yuck! What is going on here? Sweetness up front so big that whatever happens afterwards doesn't really matter. Tastes like some put some PEZ in my beer. Id pour it if I hadn't chased this one down. My tongue is starting to hurt and my stomach is already siring.  I will never recommend this to anyone."
""
"Bottom Line: I would not buy it if it was shelf turding!"

"Way to sweet and rich for my liking... Some things are just 'too good' to be true. Super, super sweet and so danm malty it's  almost like chewing on tar. The malty sweetness is far too over the top for me to ever pay the price on this again~"

"Overall, this lives up to the hype for me. People have always been saying that this is too sweet, or way overrated, but to me, this is exactly what I expected from a 15% ABV, $15 per bottle, sweet imperial stout. Simply sweet and delicious."

"Not worth the hype.  Too sweet and not complex.  I can't finish this bomber.  Corking it for tomorrow where I'll grin and bare it since I can't stand to waste this bottle.  Damnit."

"Pours dark black, with a small tan head.  The nose blows your hair back with deep roasted malts, very sweet notes of sugar, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses.  I was expecting it to be more bitter with ‘darker’ aromas, but this beer is sticky sweet.  The taste is even more so, massive malt bill here and the flavor holds true with an overpowering yet complex sweetness.  Lots of different flavors there of rich toasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, some soy sauce and tobacco, surprisingly complex for such a rich, sweet beer. The mouthfeel is awesome, so rich and creamy, silky smooth (maybe a touch cloying, but not overly)."

"2014 blue wax. Tanks to Chadwick for sharing! Pours pitch black with a tiny mocha  head that recedes quickly. Not much lacing. Smells sweet, notes of dark fruit and coffee. Sweet on the front of the palate, chocolate covered cherries comes to mind. Slightly soy sauce on the finish, but not unpleasant. Very full bodied with no carbonation. Very viscous and creamy.  Overall a very pleasing Russian Imperial Stout, better than I expected."

"2009 vintage. Held up well for a 5 yr old beer. No oxidation. Only drawback was the strong smell of soy sauce. Almost overpowering. Not so strong in the taste though still present. The sweetness of the more current dark lords was definitely gone. Overall still a great beer!"

"Traded for a bottle of 2014, had tried small samples of past vintages at tasting events, but was glad to have an entire bottle to sample. Color is deep black, with a very thin mocha head. Smell is deep, sweet, indulgent chocolate/vanilla combo with slight dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. The taste is incredible, really complex, with the sweetness dominating and just a bit of bitterness. More sweet, rich chocolate and vanilla with some caramel mixed in, and a bit of bitterness from the coffee. Surprisingly, the coffee flavors are not overly apparent, and serve more to balance out the intense sweetness of the beer. The high ABV is really well hidden, hardly any noticeable alcohol. The mouthfeel is perfect, so smooth and rounded. Love love love this beer, if you don't love sweet beer this may not be for you, but I found it wonderfully complex and drinkable, each sip was fantastic. Excited to trade for another and possibly make a trip to Three Floyd's for Dark Lord Day next year."

"Pours a nice dark beer. Very little bubbles form. Aroma is very strong, like alcohol, chocolate, cognac. Taste is very rough. Taste like alcohol, like a very boozy beer that didn't have a chance to smooth out. Some other flavors float around, but the headiness is disturbing. Not the best, yet an iconic beer due to rarity."

"Overall: This is a really nice, big, different stout. I can't put a finger on the main flavor, but it's something like soy sauce/chocolate/roastyness. Pretty well balanced and with nice big flavors, this is a nice stout."
"O- A big, thick, delicious desert of a beer. Lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is certainly one hell of a monster brew... Rich, malty, and dangerously smooth.. One hell of a beer. Can't wait to see what this thing does as it warms up a little."
""
""
"O-A good stout and should be sought out if you can get it. A little too sweet and no coffee or bitterness comes through which I like in my stouts. Great, but not world-class."

"The 2014 pours like a dark, rich syrup---taste is big, with a velvety feel. Hints of molasses, fig and a bit of coffee (without the bitterness). Pairs nicely with spicy foods or a rich dessert. Hard to find without a visit to DLD, but worth the effort."

"First dark lord ever; tried a 2014. Can't wait to crack open my 2013 DL soon. Hoping to get more vintage & 2014 Dark Lord in the future. Best beer I've ever had to date. Pours like oil; love the sweetness & mouthfeel of this beer. All hail the Dark Lord!!!¡!!!¡!"

"On the other hand, '14 was quite glorious and worth the hype. I have heard many people warn that this beer is overhyped, but I was pleasantly impressed by this."
""
""
"For a HUGELY hyped beer, I will have to say it did live up to its expectations. Its not some kind of supernatural life changing beer that I would sell a kidney for or anything like that, but its definitely an amazing brew worth trying even if you don't like stouts. I'm a huge stout guy, so this definitely hit the spot at the end of the tasting. I've had a couple of other hyped beers and they weren't really that good, DL is definitely worthy of all the praise it gets."

"Pour is jet black. Literally oozes from the bottle. Smell is combination of soy, coffee and syrup. Mouthfeel is nice. Nice coating of tongue with each sip but never overly cloying. Very sweet taste but again never cloying. Some mild coffee notes as warmed closer to room temperature. Just a hint of soy sauce but in a pleasing subtle component. Really liked this years bottling. Will look forward to seeing how age treats it."

"O- i've had a 2013 dark lord sitting in my cellar for a while now but i didn't want to drink it without drinking a fresh one to compare it to. But this veer is amazing. The flavors bled so well and the coffee makes the beer roasty and the dark chocolate makes it sweet. The muld salty taste reminds me of those chocolate bars that are such and such percent caocao with sea salt. Fantastic. Can't wait to try this beer aged a little bit."

"The dude lord was a slight improvement to the beer, and it allowed us to finish the bottle. The sweetness is cut nicely by the milk and ice. If you have a 2013 sitting around that is too cloying for you to drink, try this out. Just finish your glass before it starts to get chunky."
""
""
""
""
""
"A true classic and a great beer. Glad I got the chance to try this one."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really tasty beer. Would love to know how this one tastes fresh, with the inclusion of coffee, but I can't really complain, because I can't help but feel that the coffee would overcome what has become a subtly complex beer, with lots of sweet and savory notes over the course of the glass. Very happy to have been able to try it, but given how limited it is, not sure I'll go out of my way to seek it out again."

"Edit** - I was going to drainpour the remainder of the bottle, but ended up giving it a try the next morning. This was actually significantly better with some aeration. The green apple was mostly gone, and this now tasted like a very fruity quad/stout mix. Still not world class, but probably around a 3.75."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, well worth the pursuit to find this beer. It's reputation was held up by the completely different take on a very populated category of Imperial Russian Stouts. Stands out from the crowd by far, not sure if I would want to drink an entire bottle with its immense sweetness. Cant wait for DLD '14!"

"'12 bottle received via trade. When I first heard of this beer it was in the top 3 of BA, so it's been a long time want of mine. I was warned it was sweet and sweet it is. I assume if I had had this before Black Tuesday I would appreciate the sweetness a bit more. But a beer of this size needs barrel aging to curb the overbearing depth of malt. My bottle was slightly oxidized so I docked it more based on that. I'll see if the demand of a BA DL dies down and try my luck then."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Heavy mouthfeel with light carbonation, mouthfeel is a bit slick. Finish is messy with a lot of sweetness, which retracts for me. Overall, not a bad RIS. Really just too sweet in my opinion to be rated any higher. I liked it less as I drank it and it took a while to polish off."

"Just a beast in all ways. The age shows but complements the stout flavors that are still quite big. Tons of malt and roast flavor and massively thick. I will try this thing fresh some day. Have only had 2009 and 2010 in the last few months."

"If Stone went for bitterness with IPAs, Three Floyds went for sweetness with RTS."

"Pours just like Dark Lord always has- opaque black, exceedingly minimal mocha head that doesn't retain all that well, even for an imperial stout. Not much lacing. It smells great- no green apples, though it does got a straight up sugary sweetness but you can get a lot of complexity in it- coffee, port wine, dark fruits, milk chocolates, cocoa- which is very good. Flavour-wise, its the same- dark chocolate and black coffee bitterness, dark fruits, milk chocolate, sugar and molasses contributing a lot to the sweetness of the beer. And the mouthfeel is very good as any Dark Lord can be. No heat in this, even as it warms up. Not that hard to drink. Overall, with a year and half on it, its done very well. Its still sweet, but very manageable and complex. Its a very good imperial stout, its also overhyped but in my opinion, its a very good and unique RIS that shouldn't be confused with the best but should still be appreciated."

"A little sticky sweet for my tastes. There are better balanced Russian Imperials that I think I prefer."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is really good, flavor lingers for a looong time, it's certainly full bodied. With how sweet it is it's a little syrupy in the feel so the carbonation is down a little. Big and bold Russian Imperial Stout, I wouldn't have guessed 15%, so on some levels I guess they did a decent job hiding the alcohol. Drinkability is there, but don't be fooled, this one is a sipper. Nice warming effect after each sip, perfect for a cool night like tonight. Thanks for the trade CuriousMonk."

"--2013: Worst of all with a horrendous smell and taste of rubbing alcohol as it warmed. Appearance had an orangy swirl, best carb, and most legs. least aggressive aroma but swet. Thinner than ofhers and comparable to a porter. Flavor and smell were resembling rubbing alcohol as it warmed"""

"I've had most of the beers that are incredibly hyped and most of them live up to it, this one doesn't. It tastes like they threw a ton of ingredients into a brew kettle and forgot to ferment it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer, I've had much worse. As far as Imperial Stouts go though I've had much better and those were far more accessable. Lots of dark fruits, it almost tastes like a blend of a Quad and a RIS, leaning more toward the Quad. This is a 2012 bottle, the 3rd I've had, I also had some on tap at DLD when I picked this up. I have 4 more bottles, I'll probably drink one every 6 months, we'll see if and how it develops. If you've never had it it's worth trying. That being said I wouldn't suggest going out of your way or spending a lot to get it, chances are you have much better Stouts already waiting for you at your local bottle shop."

"Overall - This is hands down the best stout I have ever had. I was completely blown away by this and it is my new favorite beer to date. Some people complain that it is too sweet but with a little age on it that is far from true. Everything in the flavor and mouthfeel of this beer are perfection. Believe the hype as this beer is the real deal. All bow before the Dark Lord"
""
""
""
"O - A unique treat to drink across a sea of relative sameness with big time stouts. Very memorable. It can become a bit overpowering as you get towards the end of your glass, so a 7-8oz pour should be enough. Definitely a bottle to share. I have had multiple years of Dark Lord recently. I found ’12 and ’11 to be a bit too sweet when fresh, but I still do enjoy the beer and its nuances whether it is young or old. But whatever the case, this vintage is just outstanding right now. It’s time to crack it open and enjoy."
""
"O- Glad to have tried, but underwhelming, especially for a vintage thats highly regarded at the moment. Best attributes were easily the mouthfeel and appearance."
""
"O - Disappointed with this beer. I just don't get how overpowering sweetness translates into a world class beer. The ageing potential is there, and I would put down for 10 years or so before drinking"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer isn't worth the hype at all. It's decent at best. Very very sweet but the soy sauce flavor and smell really ruined it for me. I think going to DLD really ups the ratings for a lot of people with the experience involved but oh well. Try it if you can."
""

"Overall I am not impressed. I've had way better stouts from FFF, and way better local off the shelf stuff."

"it is a strong smooth nice stout but would say doesnt live up to the hype"
""
""
""

"Because of the complexity and monster body the thing has, I gave it a 4.5, but I wasn’t super impressed with the overall flavor. The sweetness is a little odd to me – and at the end of the day it’s all about balance and I just feel like a certain aspect of the flavor was a little much. But again, that’s being hyper-critical as this beer is massive/unique, and I’d love to try another bottle."
""
""
"Definitely a hype monster.  Also a unique enormous delicious beer.  DLD is blast, so this beer wins points for sentimentality.  I agree with the conjecture that there are comparable beers available on shelf, but it's fun to get on board with the whole experience of the festival in Munster.  Yayayyyyyyyyy."

"Overall: Just a great beer I could drink all day (or at least try to). It's similar to DFH WWS, except it drinks way smoother fresh and has a bigger body. This didn't disappoint me at all and is IMO worthy of the praise it gets. DLD '14, here I come!"

"Trade from BrewMane. 2013 Orange Wax bottle, drinking fresh because cellars are for chumps ;-) Pours syrupy dark black with a sub-one-finger creamy dark mocha head. Aroma of sweet roasted malts, raisins, molasses, chocolate syrup, candy sugar, and a hint of alcohol smell. Flavor is sweet molasses up front, sweet powder sugar, a bit of dark fruit, a little bitter chocolate on the finish. Nearly no trace of the 15% abv. Sweet sweet stuff. Super velvety smooth mouthfeel and very thick. Only other stouts that have had this mouthfeel come from CCB (Hunapuh, Marshal Z). Plenty of carbonation to keep it from feeling syrupy. I was expecting more on the chocolate side, but this balances sweet molasses with dark fruits prominently. The best part to me of this decedent stout is the mouthfeel. So glad I finally got a taste of this. I can see how this would blend nicely with bourbon and vanilla. ISO now I guess..."

"I know FFF is capable of subtle, delicious beers, and I realize this beer is an excuse to make one of the most ridiculous beers around and create an event out of it in a demented (and some would say brilliant) marketing scheme. I had a lot of fun at DLD for other reasons, but the outcome is definitely disappointing. However, with that said, this does get a high-ish overall score from me because no matter how cloying and grating the drinking experience of this beer is, it's easily one of the most memorable I've had, for better or for worse. It's by far my new favorite crappy beer, because as awful and unbalanced as it may be, it's a lot of fun to drink and is the most intimidating in the style - which is probably exactly what FFF is going for. If you want to see how an imperial stout *shouldn't* be made, but still want one to sample what could be THE hyperbole of craft beer, give this a shot. It definitely is worthy of discussion alone, whatever the hell it is."

"Nice red wine color upon pouring. Taste is very sweet and sticky. Very complex but i mostly get dark fruits, raisins, figs, and prunes. Its too sweet and almost cloying. Also the mouthfeel is too much, too thick. Very greatful i got to try this but this thing needs at least a year on it. No alcohol burn which is impressive but far from my fav stout."

"had a 2012 bottle on my birthday last year shortly after dark lord day. pours black and quite viscous. aroma of charred fruits, chocolate, and subtle coffee. the flavor hits you with massive sweetness but a velvety texture that coats your mouth and is slightly balanced with some mild bitter coffee notes throughout. very complex. definitely reminds me of a port wine. you really need to be able to enjoy sweentess if you are going to like/appreciate this one. i loved it."

"In the end, this was a really fun vertical to drink. There was lots of variation between the years, and getting to try them all at once was really fun and entertaining. This experience definitely confirmed that Dark Lord is generally a terrible beer. Luckily there was a 2010 to save the show, as this was by far the best of the bunch. Thanks again everyone. This was great!"

"Overall: If only this beer was more balanced. It does not quite live up to the hype, but it is still certainly a good beer. Three Floyds has a reputation for pushing the envelope, and I think it fell right off the table on this one. It is still a very good beer, but it is not worth jumping through the hoops that you must to get it. Try it, but do not trade your left arm for it."

"O- This is an excellent beer, but I feel it could use another year or two and hopefully some of the sweetness will die down. It was very enjoyable, and surprisingly I could have drank quite a bit more than the half a bottle I had without getting the full feeling I sometimes get from RIS."

"I had a 2012 bottle of Dark Lord, aged roughly one year. Thick, caramel colored head. Very sweet and syrupy in taste, almost like molasses, also a slight hint of cherries. Dark brown in color. Alcohol is masked very well for something being 15 percent. Overall, a great brew, strongly recommended if you enjoy stouts."

"O- This was a real treat. I've heard before that 2008 is the best vintage, and just judging by having it fresh last year, I'd have to agree. It isn't overly sweet, it's crazy smooth, and all of the flavors I'd want in a stout are present. I wouldn't go after years 2009-2012 just from what I've heard, but this vintage is absolutely worth seeking out. Finally I found a non-barrel aged RIS that I enjoyed more than Marshal Zhukov's."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love big, boozy, sweet stouts, but I'm going to be honest. I wanted to love this beer. It tasted like a thicker, slightly more drinkable version of DFH Worldwide stout to me. I got almost no coffee, no roast, no chocolate; it was almost all dark fruit, and was borderline sickeningly sweet. I split the bottle with my friend and I almost couldn't finish my glass. For what it's worth, my friend said it's one of the best beers he's ever had."
"Thanks a ton for this one Bobby! Now I can finally insert my own snarky little quips when people are making diabetes jokes!"
""

"Red Wax, 2012 Vintage, my first ever experience with DL. Midnight black pour with almost no carbonation, nose is licorice dark fruit and alcohol. This has been aging for almost a year, hence why the taste is mellow, but very sweet, and the 15% abv is almost unnoticeable. A ton of lacing as it goes down. I'm very satisfied with this brew, not up there with darkness or abyss imo, but this was supposed to be the worst batch they did, if that's the case I doubt I could handle a 2008 haha. Cheers"

"the beer pours a jet black with a thin tan head that dissipates into a thin tan halo. the nose has some potent dark pit fruits (raisins/prunes), caramel suagrs, and touch of chocolate/coffee. the taste is way sweeter than expected, but mixes well with all the intense chocolate covered raisins. I must be honest... this beer is way too sweet for me, but is definitely different than Black Tuesday for instance. I can only imagine this being better in a barrel/aged."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I know the hate this one gets, but I am a fan. Cracking a bottle open at the appropriate time (i.e., when I want something sweet) assures an enjoyable drinking experience. I have a full 08-11 vintage right now, and hope to post thoughts on each vintage."
""
""
""
" I mixed a tiny amount from the last of the bottle with a more traditional stout and the DL took over the taste, overpowered it so the DL was just a bit lighter and more balanced toward smokey malt and chocolate, but the prune/raison or cognac flavor was pronounced."

"O: what a very unorthodox brew let a lone a Russian Imperial Stout. It seems Three Floyds created a stout that has the feel of one that has been aged for at last 5 years while only doing it for one (depending on the bottle you have)..This is such a unique brew and i cant wait to get my hands on another bottle, preferably one from this upcoming DLD(2013)"

Probably one of the worst stouts I have ever had, and certainly the worst stout that gets the whole waxed cap, hype train treatment. I almost get the sense that I'm the butt of a cruel joke, and Three Floyds is laughing at me right now. I find it almost impossible to believe that people actually buy tickets and stand in line to spend money on this beer. Never again."

"O: Amazing stout. Although I haven't had newer Dark Lords, I can truly say that this one definitely had to have grown with age. I spent way too much on the bottle, but that's what you get when you're buying a '10 from a stranger. I look forward to trying more of this beauty. Definitely worth the try, but not the best stout that I've ever had. 3/4 friends I shared this with agreed that 09 BCBS was better."

"2012 DL on tap at the brewpub the day after DLD. Boy, was this a sweet one. Loads of sugar take over right away. Pours thick jet black with a tan frothy head. Intelligentsia coffee is always a good touch, too. Probably my least favorite of any DL's. That being said, it is still an awesome beer and very worth your while to try at least once."
""

"If you drink this with less than 2 years of age, you're doing it wrong. Even 2 years doesn't do it justice; 4-5 is ideal."
""

"This is one of the sweetest base stouts out there. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't too unmanageable or too cloying, but it was still pretty damn sweet. Then again, it was split 5-ways - I might be saying something else had I finished the entire 22 oz. bottle on my own. Though I typically prefer my RISs to have a heavy bitter offset from a huge hop addition, Dark Lord showed almost no hop character at all and was still pretty enjoyable to me. Vanilla, cocoa, caramel, molasses, dark fruits, oak... This is a great beer; though it may be too sweet to drink a bunch of, Dark Lord is awesome in small pours."

"O- very impressed, lives up to its name like no other... this will be awesome with about 2-3 yrs of age.... I'll will make it to d day for the rest of my life now"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer just seemed to try to possess too much complexity for its' own good - to the point where it became a detractor. The overtly molasses quality almost seems as if part of the priming solution were actual molasses. This RIS is, although different, not as good as most basic beers of this style."

"From notes, 6/4/10. Green wax, 2010. Pours black, very black. Nice thick brown head. Very good looking beer. Loads of roasted malt flavor in a wonderful balance of chocolate, roast and coffee. Great thick and creamy feel - really incredible. Flavor is medium sweet without even a hint of stickiness. Not quite my very favorite imperial stout but very close and I could see a different version or a bottle with some age on it winning me over entirely. Edit: Later vintages have seemed sweeter. I'm not sure if I was just really in the mood for a sweet beer that day or 2010 was excellent fresh."

"O: A pretty sugary, viscous beer. Not as bad as some people make it sound, and definitely not as good as others rave about. Somewhere in the middle; its an overly-sweet stout with a helluva marketing department. On the plus side, I really got no alcohol presence out of it, so I wonder what time in the cellar would do for this beer. If it mellowed the sweetness, I'd be interested in getting another bottle and sitting on it for a few years."

""
""

"Overall: One heck of an evening and was so glad to be apart of this opportunity. After tasting this broad spectrum of DL I would say the def spot for this beer is 2-4 years of aging. The sweetness dies out some and takes a back burner and lets the complexity of tastes shine even more."

It fit the bill so much with the second half of the bomber I added some vanilla ice cream for a beer float, and it was pure heaven. If this beer came with vanilla Ice Cream it would get a 5 down the board. But still a very solid brew."

It's great, and by itself it's something to behold. In other high company, it's flaws really shine."

Smells of espresso, dark chocolate, licorice, leather, some dark fruit, brown sugar and some booze. Taste espresso, chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, tobacco, marshmallow and a fresh sugar cookie. Mouth feel is thick and the finish is roasted bitter, chocolate, cookie sweetness with the alcohol being very well subdued."

"22oz bottle shared with a friend. Poured into a tulip, thick pour reveals an opaque black body topped with a milk chocolate colored head, good retention, no lacing. Aromas are boozy, roasted barley, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, cherry, and blackberry perhaps. Initially it's sweet and syrupy with notes of dark chocolate, raspberry, blackberry, cherry, cocoa, roasted barley, vanilla, molasses, espresso, booze. Full flavored with maximum complexity. Unbelievably good! Mouth-feel is thick & chewy, full-full bodied, viscous, and very smooth. Overall, definitely an upper echelon RIS. One of the best out there, if not the best. I stand corrected."
""
"O- This was a fantastic RIS. This was my first time having the '12 but I thought it was drinking still a little bit on the sweet side but fairly nice (everyone else said it tasted better then when they had it when it first came out). After this we also opened up every year down to '08. Aging it definitely made the beer more smooth and mellowed the sweetness a little bit to make it more drinkable. You can definitely tell a difference between the years and this ages with the best of them. My favorites were the '09 and '11. Personally I highly recommend this beer and I think it is one of the best examples of a RIS. If you don't like sweet beers or sippers I would maybe stay away."

"I heard this was a bad year for dark lord and there were potentially some contaminated batches. I'm not sure if I got one but I have to say I would not recommend this beer. Bourbon county stout, FW parabola are far better beers."
""
"O - The smell worried me with some oxidization, but it tasted very nice."
"2012 year. Poured very dark, beautiful tan head, very viscous almost syrupy. Tastes of plum, chocolate, coffee, soy sauce (I think this may have been due to the alcohol content?, dark fruits. VERY intense flavors. I do not think I could finish a bottle on my own if I really tried. Smelled amazing. Great experience. Could taste residual alcohol. I'm looking forward to tasting it after aging to see if these intense flavors mellow out."

"Alright, maybe it was a bad idea trying to tackle this entire bottle myself, but go big or go home right? Anyways, I think my friend Paul (azdback) put it pretty well when describing this beer as ""A must try but IMO not the holy grail."" I found the combination of whatever they used in this that resulted in soy sauce notes that come out a bit more as it warms to be what didn't take this RIS to the upper tier of its class for me. Still complex, unique, and good in it's own right, just not holy grail quality, at least not this vintage currently. Perhaps it's much better with substantial age. Anyways, again a big thanks to Matt for this bottle! It has been something I've been wanting to try since I got into craft beer and heard about this beer. And I'm quite glad I did get to try it. Not so glad I didn't split this with another person though. Seriously, the mouthfeel is big and awesome but this is a tough one to tackle solo even for me."
""
""
"Verdict: It's a bold RIS and at 15% takes no prisoners. I ragged on this beer fresh in 2011 and again in 2012, but it's starting to come around and in 2 years, this will be great. 2009 is tasting extremely good right now and while it may be at it's peak, there is no doubt that this beer is well made and worth seeking out, but I'd have to recommend that you try it at various stages in it's life before making a snap judgement about it's merit."

"Overall, 5 years ago this may have been a revolutionary beer that may have deserved such high praise but in today's ever expanded craft beer world this is merely ordinary.

"I wanted to like this beer, but its cloying taste was too much; I had to force myself to finish the 3oz glass I had. The sweetness overpowered everything in the brew and it was too one-dimensional because of it."
""
""
"Hands down, this is the most viscous beer I have ever had. It's so thick that it alters how the carbonation operates, I think. Nose was all molasses. Flavor is extremely thick with malts, touches of molasses and chocolate (just a hint, ya know). Pronounced bitterness in a stout-ish kinda way. I really feel like this whole thing just rests on how thick the liquid is. If for nothing else (as if you really need a reason to try and get one of these), it's worth it just to experience how thick this is. I can almost chew on it. Almost. Lives up to the hype, though, I wouldn't have minded some more complexity on the flavor profile."

"O: wasn’t so sure on what to expect of this brew. And I was shocked by how sweet this brew was. Drinks more like a Brandy than a beer. The huge amount of dark fruits and sugar make this one hard to comprehend. It rivals Southern Tier Crème Brulee as far as sweetness IMO."
"Overall: This was an enjoyable experience but wow what a sugar bomb! If you don't have a buddy or two to share with you may by in trouble IMO"
"O: If I had an entire bottle to myself, I would have drain poured this. I'm glad I didn't actively seek this out and it was treated as an extra at the otherwise fantastic tasting."

"O: B"

"O - It is better than most shelf-RIS in my opinion. In a world of Hill Farmstead, Surly and Cigar City, and Bruery, I have a tough time with DL. An immense amount of sweetness really covers the flavors. Any transition between flavors tastes like sugar. This bottle is miles beyond what I tried at DLD though, so it has improved. FFF should just throw all of their DL in barrels and be done with it."

"O- A huge disappointment, I had heard great things about this beer and was really looking forward to it, but what an under-attenuated, cloying nightmare this turned out to be. I struggled through an 8-oz pour. People actually like this beer?"
""
""
""
"The body is warm, viscous, and palate-coating. Has held up well after 2 years of utter darkness. Subtle carbonation play on the tongue. Starts out with a sweet kiss of milk chocolate. The sweetness melds well with the mildly bitter character, but then the soy sauce-like flavor kicks in. Alcohol is noticeable, and adds a nice touch of warmness on the back end. This is good, though, this beer seems lacking somehow. Glad I had it, and glad I aged it, but I'd like a fresh one to compare it to, no doubt."
""
""

"O: This beer is depressing. I have been wanting to try this for a long time and it's just a mess of pure soy sauce. It actually makes me cringe when I sip it once the soy sauce kicks in. The other flavors aren't too bad, you can tell this had the makings of a great beer. I'm not sure if the soy sauce is an off flavor or if it's part of the molasses or what. Can't be a bad bottle since other people mention it now that I read the reviews. I've had worse, but not much worse. Undrinkable due to the soy sauce and the overpowering cloying sweetness. This is coming from a guy who just gave Creme Brulee a rave review a few weeks ago."

"O: This beer should start another category of its own called ""Barley Port"" Cause this is exactly what it is. Just as Port is a wine to be sipped this is a beer to be sipped, Try taking a full mouthful and you will know what I mean. Big beer, hard to imagine how they do it and for that I give them props but I don't really like port or desert wines and I didn't really enjoy how sweet this beer was."

"Had the 2012 dark lord red wax bottle. It was the first time I'd had a Russian imperial stout, and I wish I could have it more often than 4 per year. I agree with a lot I reviews on this beer. It does have a motor oil consistency going down. It is dark as night with a light head and carbonation. Tastes like cofffee , chocolate, and the alcohol content is very well hidden. I live 40 minute from the brewery and am currently moving to California. I will definitely be flying back next year for my 4 beer allotment."
"Overall it's really sweet for my tastes but tolerable, and also fun. Quite an interesting ride, glad to have given it a whirl. It's a sipper which doesn't always appeal to me for beer, but it's without question worth drinking."
""

"O: I was expecting to be disappointed, but this was worse than I anticipated. I’m glad I got to have it so now I can get it behind me and not worry about having to trade for it again."
"O: One of the most overrated beers of all time...gotta love that hype train"
"Very happy to finally try this one and even happier to have a 2012 bottle to drink at a later date. It may sound cliche, but there is not another imperial stout out there like this one. Dark Lord is original, distinctive and incredibly delicious. Well worth a trade and I will certainly be looking for more. "

"Overall I have been waiting over two years to try this sought after brew. I have endured a broken bottle of this and many trade offers but after all that I have finally drank the holy grail. This is a 2011 bottle that came via davesway10. Thanks Dave. A must try but IMO not the holy grail."

"O - This beer did not live up to the hype for me. I love the fact that it's 15% ABV as I wish more breweries would try to make beers this strong. It's definitely an above average stout and good for the high ABV but this beer is way overhyped. I would not trade for this considering what you have to give up to get a bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a pretty big miss for me.  The aroma is great, and the ability to mask a huge ABV is impressive, but the palate profile is just way too sweet.  Im not saying its a bad beer, but I struggle to see it being a top 100.  IMO its not even in the same league as some of the other big  stouts I have tried.  I would drink this again if it were offered to me, but with so many great stouts available, I don't see myself making an effort to get this one again.  "

"This is certainly one big beer. There is a ton going on and they flavors and aromas don't necessarily mesh together. None of it is bad, most quite good actually. It just seems like it might need some more time to come together before hitting its peak. This is definitely a beer that I will revisit down the road but for now it misses the mark just a bit."
"Overall: Like that one guy said while interviewed for 5 seconds on CBS news - ""It's Sweet! It's Delicious!!"" This beer truly lives up to its hype in every way. It is not the greatest thing I have ever put in my mouth, but hell yes is it worth fighting for tickets online or in person at the brewery, traveling to the pub, and spending a day among friends enjoying its release."

"Dark Lord - The bottle says: “Dark Lord is a gargantuan Russian Style Imperial Stout, with a reverse cascading head that starts out billowing the color of burnt oil like the Dark Lord rising from the black primordial beginnings. Its resonant vinous aroma has been described as cherries, sweet malt, molasses, burnt currants, plus with a port wine alcohol overtow. Mochachino notes burned within. Motor oil consistency, hellishly smooth yet divinely burnt and vinous. The first sip coats your palate with a palatial charred fruit and chocolate blanket. Alcohol burn wiggles its way down your throat with a thick body. Enjoy and thanks for your continuing support.”"

"2012 vintage poured into a Duvel tulip at 46 degrees. Pours a midnight oil black. 2 inch beige head quickly shrinks to nothing. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is dark fruit, plum, raisin, molasses, mild pine, maple syrup, toffee, and caramal. Taste is very sweet. Candi sugar, dates, raisins, molasses, toasted malts, raw earth in the back of your mouth, dark baking syrup, faint grass, and roasted barley. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. There is hardly any evidence of alcohol, which is amazing for a 15%abv. Awesome beer. So complex and amazing. I cannot wait till i try this over the next few years in my cellar."
""
"Overall: I've had this in my place since DLD 09... vertical, dark and maybe some temp changes but not crazy. I'm guessing all that contribute to losing any coffee flavor, if it had any. It's licorice swizzled molasses with a bitter dark chocolate aftertaste. I can't compare it with any other DL because the age makes such a difference. Overall, I love it. Not as much as I love Halle Berry, but Dark Lord is (barely) more accessible."
"O: Share this beer. While I love it, Dark Lord is too much for a single person in a single sitting. That being said, it really is one hell of a beer; it’s hard to even compare it to other beers in this style. I’d love to try the barrel-aged versions, or at least one with age – there’s no telling how this one would open up with a few years on it, especially sitting in a barrel the whole time."

"2009 Vintage...I have been waiting for a long time to try this beer. Pours a VERY THICK, motor-oil black with minimal-to-no head. Scent is VERY VERY sweet...with some off-putting soy sauce aromas. I also pick up some lovely chocolate and brandy aromas, along with molasses and dark malt. Slight vanilla. Taste is...WOW...disappointing to say the least. Overly sweet...a ton of sugar, burnt sugar and malt. Lots of toffee with candied dark fruits and more sweetness. Slight soy sauce flavor. Mouthfeel is very thick, like motor oil, and hardly any carbonation. Drinkability is fair...but can only have a small serving of this. Overall, this was not nearly as good as I was hoping for. It's not too often that I go against the hype, but this was just not a good beer IMO. The sweetness is overpowering and just makes for a bad experience. Will definitely not be trading for any more of this."

"22oz bottle shared by my older brother. Of course deep black and a big old brown head. The aroma is raisins, molasses, a bit of soy, and a hint of roast.

"The '08 is one of my favorite stouts and has been for a while. Every '08 I've had over the past year has been phenomenal. The others not so much. The '09 may be one of the worst I've had as it's sweetness is on a whole new level. Hopefully one of these upcoming years they go back to the '08 recipe which is more balanced in favor of the overly sweet recent vintages. I'm hoping age will do some good yet on the '10 and '11, but the '09 is a lost cause."

"This beer is a kick in the teeth. Sweet and syrupy, with enough weight and strength to do some damage. Alcohol is shockingly well hidden.

One of the better imperial stouts I've had, though."

"When you pour this beer you will notice how viscous it looks. Black without a trace of light seeping though topped off with a thin brown head that leaves a ring around the center. The smell is roasted grain, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and caramel, surprisingly no alcohol. The first sip confirms that this is a thick beer, full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Not as sweet as I was expecting and definitely not as boozy as I was expecting. Molasses, chocolate, roasted grains and caramel are the predominate flavors. Mostly roasty. Its still pretty sweet, but not as bad as I thought it would be. Definitely a great beer, but is it worth everything to get one, I would say no, but I would never turn one down either."
""
"Update, 2008 bottle: Spit with Goblinmunkey7. This is as great as I remember the 2010 bottle, if not better. Roasty and burnt with some big caramel and molasses sweetness to balance. Lots of other flavors as well, licorice and dark fruits in abundance. Drinking this is an experience. Lowered the smell, though, to 4.5 (now solid 4.5s across the board)."

"Three Floyds Dark Lord pours a black so complete that I think the lights flickered when I popped the cap off. The light tan head can't quite reach two fingers in height, before the foam quickly dies away and leaves a largely clean glass behind. The nose is a little weak (although switching to a snifter for the second half of the bottle did help), and it's a little bit different from what one normally finds in a Russian Imperial Stout. Rather than chocolate and/or coffee, the aroma is redolent of molasses, licorice, and cherries and currants. The flavor doesn't have that same dull edge to it, and also manages to incorporate some more traditional imperial stout elements. A brief flash of dark chocolate opens things up for a molasses/licorice/brown sugar middle that really serves as th centerpiece of the beer. A mild coffee note then slides into dark fruity finish (those same cherries and currants). It's varied and complex, and if the roasty grain flavors were a little more prominent, I'd say it was perfect. The mouthfeel here is one of, if not the chewiest I've ever encountered. The body is as rich and viscous as it gets, and carbonation is barely, if at all appreciable. It's just too heavy and syrupy in the end to be good. Darklord is one of the tastiest stouts I've ever enountered, and is especialy smooth alcohol-wise for a relatively fresh 15% stout. The brewing process could stand to be tightened up though, as from a couple technical standpoints this beer falters a little bit."
""
""
"O: Dark Lord is unlike any imperial stout I have ever had. I have had the 2011 3 times now, and it confuses my taste buds every single time. I am not afraid to admit that I don't fully get this beer. All I know is that I enjoy it's unique flavor profile and the challenge that it provides every time I drink it."

"Pours a thick, opaque black with a thin, transient dark mocha head. Boozy and hot aroma of chocolate and coffee, slightly fruity, minimal roast. Flavor is similar, bordering on too sweet with a slight bitter finish; light fruit notes under the strong and syrupys chocolate and coffee malt. Thick, viscous, chewy body with low carbonation and a hot finish. First time trying to a regular Dark Lord (not sure why I never opened a bottle before) and enjoyed this more than I expected."

"D/O: This popular imperial stout displays a host of appropriate features, yet none stand out as really being superior or defining in a positive way. Despite the hype that surrounds it this beer is relegated to second tier status, with the largest offense committed by the abundant acidity that is tasted and felt. It suggests a particularly naughty version of Dr. Pepper--a sort-of highball prepared with bourbon and a dash of Hershey's syrup. Considering the amount of effort (and perhaps cash) required to land this beer, it just doesn't seem worthwhile."

"So here we are, Christmas 2011… 786 days after receipt of this bottle, a gift the night before my wedding from one of my groomsmen, I prepare to drink my first sips of Dark Lord. This is the 2007 bottling, picked up by my friend at Dark Lord Day 2007, which took place April 28th. So, it’s been 1702 days since it was picked up, or about 4.66 years. The cap opens with a small pffft, not surprising, though I’m concerned since it’s wax-dipped (silver) so I expected no oxidative damage or air leakage. The head starts about ¼"" thick, and it is vocal, snapping and crackling like a cindering log. It’s got a coagulated blood red hue to the deep brown color. Ok, maybe more mahogany, but the ruddy hues are unexpected. The beer coats the side of the glass in a brown, tobacco-juice like layer, and has a cola-like appearance. The coating layer is like looking through vintage negatives… The beer is not pitch black, it’s a dark brown, but it looks like coke at the edges. The smell is, of course, deeply malty. Reminds me a bit of bourbon, but without the booze. Some serious mash… Cherry undertones, and lots of port and madeira wine taking charge of the nose. Plums are in there, as are some of the strongest, “freshest” raisin notes I’ve ever picked up from a beer. Fresh out of the box CA-raisins. Really prominent. Fig newton filling pretty robust as well. I get a bit of box board, and paper, hopefully that isn’t an oxidation issue. I get almost no alcohol notes, which is just nuts at 13%+ABV. Ah, as it warms, and I swirl, the booze does get coaxed out. But much deeper and below the surface than anticipated. Slight burnt note, some chocolate, almost no coffee. It’s big-time madeira style. Crazy. Oh wow, first sip down… it is thick! Very thick. I can feel the weight of it hit my stomach. My word, this is nice. Extraordinarily mellow, considering how big and bold a beer this is. Chocolate comes out quite a bit on the palate, more so than I would have expected from the nose. There are no burnt notes, nothing scorched, just thick, almost milky chocolate and cocoa. A bit of mocha flavor as well. Lots of molasses in the fade. Suggestions of black licorice and a splash of vanilla emerge, but its amazingly port- and madeira-like. It’s rich without being sweet or at all cloying. Coats my front teeth in a way that makes me fear they’ll be permanently stained. But the good Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to try this beer, and I’ll embrace the risk. Finishes with a bit of charcoal and chalky dryness, which is a nice shift as the palate is dried out after all the rich maltiness, and, well, 'refreshed' is not the right word, but 'readied' for the next sip sounds about right. A very nice experience. Wish I had tried it fresh and had something to baseline it against, but it is quite a nice beer at nearly 5 years old and a very rewarding experience. Merry Christmas to me!!"
""
""
"O) I really enjoyed this 2011 vintage, and am thankful my cousin put in the effort to acquire a few bottles. I must admit to being somewhat skeptical about this beer going into the tasting, especially given the hype. It lived up to the hype in my opinion, and I found it quite impressive. I would be thrilled to sample some of the other vintages, and remain hopeful that I can attend Dark Lord Day, one of these years."

"O- I have now had 2007-2011 Dark Lords. While I loved all of them ,this was in a world of its own. Much more thicker and darker than new vintages. Age has blended the flavors together perfectly, creating an intense monster. This vintage is no where past its prime in my mind, and I wish I had more to drink. Drinking this was an experience I will not soon forget...easily one of the best beers I have ever had. I think I enjoyed this one even more than Vanilla Bean aged Dark Lord."

"Hope this is an okay review for my first stab at one."

"O:Perfect!!!! Just what I look for in an Imperial Stout. Chocolatey, coffee, goodness!"

"I had this as a part of a small tasting thrown for a friend. It was poured into a tasting snifter it produced a great dark mocha colored head with about a finger and a half width. The smell has improved with some age when fresh it smelled hot and sticky sweet, that has mellowed very well the coffee comes threw a little more. Huge coffee flavor, some chocolate, dark fruit flavor like fig. The mouth feel has also thinned a little an some of that sticky sweetness has mellowed, it still coats your entire mouth and stays there. Overall this is one of my favorite beers I guess you can call me a homer but I am so happy FFF brews in my state."

"However, it's syrupy body is its downfall. If this beer to have one fault it is that it feels as though you're drinking maple syrup from a glass. It's a bit rough to choke down."

""
"overall, a huge great RIS. So glad I got to finally try this bad boy. I would love to have a few more to age, but thats how it goes with such a rare brew."
""
""
"Overall: The beer would be a lot better if it wasn't so sweet. I think that's what put it over the top for me. The flavors are good, but I can't get past the sweetness. It's also missing more roasted notes."
""
"I do not want to say that all Dark Lords are this evil, but this vintage is some special type of evil. It is just too much. Even a small pour ravaged me. I feel no shame in admitting weakness, I am simply not man enough to tame the evil with in this bottle. This is a vintage I will avoid in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is an outstanding beer with good complexity of flavors. It does lack more roasted and bitter notes to balance the molasses, but even with these flaws it is still a hell of a stout."

"O - I'm a big fan of most of Three Floyds' other offerings. Their Dreadnaught, Artic Panzer Wolf, Zombie Dust, Gumballhead, Alpha King, etc., etc. are amazing, but I feel this beer is more hype than anything else. Maybe this is meant to be aged, but most truly great RIS I've had are still awesome when fresh. If you haven't had this beer yet, don't feel too bad, there are better out there, nothing special about this one."

"Overall - Sure, it's good. But it's so insane that it's barely drinkable. I don't think I'd seek this out again. Either that or I'd need to split the bottle four ways."
""
""
""
""
"O: A huge beer with a lot going on for a RIS. Very good overall. I loved the coffee and chocolate/deep roasted malt notes. This beer was a little sweet, but still very tasty. I hate to say it, but the hype surrounding this beer builds it up to be better than it is. I would NEVER turn this beer down and will seek it out again. A very good product from FFF with a masterful job of marketing this product."

"O - Not quite what I expected. Good, yes. Worth the hype? Meh. I'd rather stock up on CBS."
"Overall: To be honest this is not that great of a beer the flavors are just such a train wreck"
"I've had 07, 08, 09, 10, and 11-- and this 08 is really blowing my mind right now."
"Excellent, excellent, excellent. So rich yet so drinkable and where the H is the 15% ABV hidden?? Absolutely lives up to the hype."
"I always look forward to tasting Dark Lord. In celebration of Intl Stout Day (and having the house to myself) I've decided to solo a bottle tonight. Hype or no hype, this is a great beer. Is it the best beer in the world? No. Does it hang out in the came circles? Absolutely."
"I'm glad I finally tried the infamous Dark Lord, and while a decent RIS and quite enjoyable in it's big, bold flavors I didn't find it to be anything out of this world."
"O: Amazing...not as complex as some other world class stouts, but certainly awesome in its own way. Deserving of the hype and rating, must try."
"2011 bottle shared with J Bird and SB. Pours dark and thick and looks pretty good at this point. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. The smell doesn't really bring anything of note to the table. Taste is obnoxiously sweet, no coffee flavors at all, no flavor of any kind, just a sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, not too sticky, but the sweetness is all I can think about. Overall I was not impressed with this version. I liked it on tap at the release party but it has only gotten worse from there. I'm not sure if this is legal but I poured out about half of my glass. The Cardinals just hit a walk-off home-run to take game 6. OMG, what a game!"
"Update - last weekend a friend opened a 2012 that smelled pretty heavily of soy sauce. That was not nearly as enjoyable as the bottle from the original review. Docking a few marks for inconsistency."
"Overall: Again, I cannot thank Alewatcher anywhere nearly enough for finally hooking me up with this bad boy. This was, pretty much from the serious beginnings of my BA days, the one beer I really wanted to try, along with Westy 12. It may be a matter of me building this up in my mind beyond reasonable expectation. I don't mind the sweetness at all, though it's too much to drink an entire bottle without splitting it between 2-3 people. But, for me, there's not a real depth of flavor and, while the booziness is remarkably restrained, the flavors aren't particularly inspiring. The brownie/chocolate notes are nice, but the iron/molasses notes are a bit prominent after awhile. All in all, it's not a bad beer, but I now know that I won't go spend several hours driving to Munster and another couple of hours in line to get another one of these. Much better stouts out there, and way closer to home. Again though, huge thanks for the opportunity!"
"Overall this has got to be one of the best beers I've ever had. Taste is great, smell is great, mouthfeel is probably the best for any stout I've ever had. I highly recommend this to RIS lovers and beer lovers alike."
"This was like a great port, but in beer form. Rich and layered with a great finish to it"
"I'm not sure that Dark Lord truly merits a ""C-"" rating, as it is anything but average. However, at this stage, this is a huge and unwieldy beer that just seems out of control. This could really use some more time in the bottle, both for the alcohol heat to die down and the flavors to integrate. At this point, it's disjointed and almost a chore to drink."
"overall very god but fairly disappointing given what I was expecting. too sweet."
"O: Definitely not a beer to chug back. A buddy and I split this and spent two hours sipping and hanging out. That's definitely the right setting for this beer. It deserves some time to be savored."
"O- This was the first big sweet stout I tried and it was great, just messy and all over the place with very strong flavors. Can't wait to see what a little age does to it."
"O- real nice bg stout. A little bit on the sweeter side but definately a nicely done stout."
"Overall, I'm impressed. This lived up to my expectations, definitely. I'm happy I still have half my glass!"
"O- A great imperial stout and i would say that it wasnt as good as the hype, however its not fair to judge a fresh beer that is supposed to be aged. Above average but not mind blowing, very glad i got to try this fresh and have more in the cellar to age. I am also looking forward to trying different vintages of this beer."
"O-A rather good stout but not quite living up to the hype. For something like a boozy imperial stout like this I might enjoy an aged world wide stout more. It is a viscous beer and worth trying and DLD is fun but I wouldn't trade some of my better options for this one."
"Rating: 93 out 100"
"O - A pretty run in the mill RIS with a bunch of extra sugar added. It's good, but not A+ good."
"I opened up my first Dark Lord (green wax 2010) about a month ago. The 22oz bomber pours a thick syrupy black color into a snifter with almost no head. The smell is of sweet dried fruit and a huge amount of burnt sugars. The taste is full and mouth filling, very oily a little hot but then you get the coffee vanilla chocolate and a huge finish of burnt sugar sweetness. This is a huge beer, amazing and gets better with every sip. Wow I’m happy I have more of these, because it totally lives up to the hype and from what I hear it gets better with age!!!"
"Thick, viscous pour. Nearly no head. Smells boozy, sweet (vanilla, chocolate). I don't get as much roast and coffee in the smell as with other stouts. That's fine with me. The taste is fantastic. So much to process. Sweetness that seems to suggest chocolate, vanilla, molasses. Unlike many stouts, the roast is hidden. For that, I think this beer stands out a bit to me. Some licorice in there too. Yum. The booze will get you if you drink too fast but it certainly does not overtake the beer. It is well hidden, which is impressive for 15%. I love this beer and Dark Lord Day."
"O: My first Dark Lord. This met the expectations for me and I'm excited to try other vintages now that I've had my first. Another big thanks ThomasHardy for sharing."
"O - Hmmm....been waiting waiting waiting to try this beer, patiently cellaring since I traded with Heater in the Spring. Over worked my expectations; not as blown away as I was hoping to be. Sickly sweet. Lot to drink by oneself. Not sure if '09 is 15%, doesn't say on bottle but does not feel like 15%. Glad I tried it."
"Dark Lord is good, I must say. These should come in smaller nip bottles so that they can be enjoyed as a after dinner digestive. That would be a perfect. We don't live in a perfect world so I open up a bomber and have Jeffo to finish the bottle."
"O: Best of all the vintages in my opinion. I think this is because I tend to like DL younger, not because this vintage is so much better. 4"
"O: I finally see what everyone is talking about. Sweet baby jesus this is simply magnificent. Perfect balance of flavors & commanding feel. Amazing beer."
"Ugh. I felt dangerously close to falling into a diabetic coma after drinking this. I almost needed to brush my teeth because it felt like sugar was coating my teeth. The sweetness needs to be dialed way back; I could only finish half of my glass. The rest went to my wife, and she had just as much trouble finishing it. I have to say I was disappointed by this beer."
"(Voodoo, Hoppin' Frog...) And I don't have to stand in line for those."
"2012 Dark Lord edit: This beer is drastically different than it used to be, and unfortunately, it is much worse. It smells like it has potential, but it goes downhill from there. This beer is incredibly sweet, and its sweetness snuffs out its former complexity. It's a one note beer now, and not a very good one."
"age will do this fellow terrific i believe, however fresh is eh"
"O: Unique, pleasant, complex, strong toasted nut/seed, very good, of the sweet rich nature rather than burn/roast"
" Overall this brew is awesome,so complex tons of different layers of flavor. Melds very nicely. I waited a long time to try this and it didn't dissapoint at all. Great job from FFF!"
"I really have been underwhelmed by just about every incarnation of this hallowed beer that I have tried. Just way to...BIG with no resemblance of balance or nuance. Not something I would recommend."
"O- As long as they make it I'll look for it and love it. I cant wait to try some of my older vintages. The flavor and smell are so nice and the mouth feel is perfect for the style. It does have a high ABV so to many would be hard to accomplish, with that being said this is a once a year drinker. For a special occasion or just to be the life of the tasting."
"D - too heavy and cloying to even approach drinkable; not my favorite stout or style of stout for that matter; not much nuance or depth beyond the vanilla bourbon that doesn't jump out anyway; probably going to be ridiculed for this review but i really don't think it is that great."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small spots of lace slowly drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is prominently of dark dried fruits (prunes, raisins) and alcohol with some subdued chocolate (chocolate liqueur) and even more fleeting coffee aromas. Taste is extremely rich again with the dark dried fruits soaked in liqueur flavor being foremost. I am also getting some molasses and soy sauce flavors. There is a slight chocolate and coffee essence in the taste but these take a back seat to all other flavors. This beer has a very low level of carbonation with a thick and sticky mouthfeel. A noticeable alcohol burn hits the back of the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good RIS but it is much different than I was expecting this beer to be. A very heavy emphasis on the dark fruits puts the other smells and flavors on the back burner. This is a very rich sipping beer that I took my time with and enjoyed. I am glad I was able to try this beer."
"Pours a thick pitch black appearance with a two finger mocha head, looks amazing! Aroma of chocolate, coffee, sweet fruits and alcohol. Reminds me more of a port than a beer but it's a good thing that I love ports. Taste follows the nose yet sweeter, I am amazed by the complexity of this beer as it warms it gets even more complex."
"An incredibly thick and substantial sweet chocolate stout with lots of flavor and body."
"Thanks to BA Buddy 'Brabander' for letting me taste, this beautiful and exceptional beer."
"Overall: the Dark Lord came highly anticipated because of the hype surrounding it. That said, it exceeded my expectations. Brilliant stuff!"
"Impressed!"
"D/O- About time I reviewed this. It's Dark Lord, you're either going to be a lover or hater. This guys a lover. If there is another beer like it, point me in that direction so I can have this more often. Thanks to PTMcB for opening this!"
"So I finally got to try this bad boy, and it was worth the wait. It wasn't quite a top beer for me, but it is a very well done stout that I really enjoyed drinking. I have a 2011 version I'm going to age for a few more years and try it again."
"O - the hype that killed a beer. this is such a well crafted brew but did not come close to living up to the noise, i mean i really could go without for the rest of time. the dark fruits are a bit much for me and a solid as this beer is, i previously saw myself getting DLD tickets in the future...fuck that noise"
"September 2, 2012 - did a 3 year vertical of the ’10-’12 at home with Brandon. Some chocolate in the aroma for the 10, some alcohol in the 11 and the 12 had a stronger alcohol aroma. Still very good, but I have had so much since trying this for the first time....so dropping my ratings slightly."
"O: an alright beer, but still too sweet and boozy after over a year of age for my tastes. Soy, molasses, and toffee dominate the aroma and flavor of this beer, which I'm not a fan of at all. Definitely not worth the hype. I'd consider buying it again to age for even longer if it were cheaper and more easily obtainable, but as is have no desire to ever seek one out again."
"Overall: With all the flavors coming at me, i would have thought it could be a muddled mess but i was struck by the balance of it even though it is a beast. 2 to share is good but 3 might have been better. Still, one of the best i've tried and worth the hunt!"
"O - Good big boozy stout with a lot of hype behind it. This beer still needs another 2 years I'd imagine. Great Novelty stout and I'm very appreciative I finally was able to try it but worth the hype? Not for me. Kind of a hot mess of a stout. To each their own."
"This is a little disappointing to be honest, but it isn't super terrible. I would say it's mostly just disappointing because the market is saturated with delicious stouts."
" Aromas of leather, tobacco, port, honey and dark fruits. Sweet, super rich and decadent. Palate is dominated by dark fruits and a port like sweetness but with just enough tar and roast to balance. Viscous and oily body. Alcohol only hits you in the chest, overall for 15% this is incredibly smooth. A fantastic RIS, didn’t disappoint"
"A true classic, and deserves the hype."
"O-- 09 had to be a mess. Has developed into something good but very port like. no way I could drink the whole thing on my own. A lot of sugar and very thick. 15% ABV is well hidden in it, the thickness it is there as well as the sweetness. By lore this is pretty overrated but it was quite interesting as it changed to a massive strong belgian strong dark ale. not for the faint at all. Total sipper."
"Overall: This one was much sweeter than I'd anticipated, but at no point was it cloying. Quite the opposite--it was so dangerously good that I kept wanting to drink more. Those who don't like sweeter imperial stouts might not like this one, but it's still worth a try. I don't know what their grain bill is, or what kind of yeast they use, but am very intrigued by how they achieve this amazing flavor. Still 5 months left in the year, but I'm gonna be hard-pressed to find a better one than this! Thanks Mike!"
"O: The best russian imperial stout I have ever tried of as of yet. I've had the 08' and 11', both are very good, I would suggest to open one bottle as soon as it is distributed so you can compare from other years."
"O - Overall, what a great beer. It's sweetness is perfectly balanced by the alcohol. I couldn't put it down before I wanted another sip. Great job, Three Floyds."
"*** 1-year-later edit: beer actually DOES gets better than this! DL '08 is drinking well (but not great) right now, '11 is dreadful / disgraceful, '12 tastes like wort (should improve greatly with age), and '10 is still drinking pretty well right now. The DL 2010 is still my favorite vintage, though it's quite inferior to other yearly RISes like Darkness & Hunahpu. ***"
"Reviewed from notes...Absolutely worth the 10 hour drive from Oklahoma. Had this on tap @ DLD 2010. Pours thick, aroma is of toffee and coffee with hints of chocolate and vanilla. Appearance dark black as expected from a RIS. Taste and Palate...Hints of toffee, coffee, camel and chocolate. Feels heavy on the tongue and fills the mouth completely . Overall I think this beer definitely lives up to the hype!"
"Recent vintages have not lived up to the 04 or 07 bottles with the 09 being my least favorite year to date. I like the smoke that was added to the 2010 batch."
"O: Glad I got to try this one. Lives up to the hype!"
"Overall: at first I was impressed by the mouthfeel. Extremely thick and smooth beer. After some time it got me a bit annoyed/worried. I am pretty sure something is added to this beer, like PEG or Glycerol. In the end didn’t finish the glass because it felt like drinking porridge. I took a sample and will run a HPLC or so at work. This cannot be good! Tastewise, perfect beer, extremely balanced. I really didn’t expect that, because I was heavily disappointed by most other overhyped American RIS brews (too complex, too much ingredients, and therefore, way out of balance), but this beer is spot on! A bit too sweet maybe, but I really enjoyed it. If I will drink it again, because of the Glycerol/PEG/EDTA feeling, I am not sure though."
"Thanks to Jeffo for letting me try a couple samples of this 2010 version. Pours a rich, dark black. Tastes of smooth chocolate notes with a nice roastyness in the finish. I am shocked that this beer is 15%. It was so damn easy to drink, especially for a hot summers day. I was really impressed with this beer. I was scared that it would be too big. Just wish I could get some more now."
"Smores. Smores. Smores. All I get from this 2011 bottle is smores. nice pour into a dixie cup. I can only assume it is black. Large bubble tan head. Smells like all the things you would make smores with. Tastes like all the things you would make smores with, and, oddly enough, tastes a little bit like ginger ale, but this is a good thing. And smores. Good slick mouth feel on this sweet beast. Overall a great beer, worth the wait, but not the hype. Smores."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer, it tasted alright to me, however, it is not very complex and the alcohol is not as well hidden as it should be. This beer seems like it may not be all hype, but it is mostly hype. I have had off the shelf imperial stouts that outperform this beer on almost every level, besides hype of course."
"Overall, this was a very delicious beer but without a doubt one of the most overrated beers that I've had. I wish I would have had this stout without ever hearing anything about it so I wouldn't have had the hype train bearing down on me but I feel like that only hurt this beer in the end. I fully stand behind the fact that everyone should try this beer, just don't go paying the $100 Ebay price. Cheers"
"Overall - its good but not as sweet as I was expecting. It's a great experience thought."
"This was an excellent beer. Don't know how often I'll get my hands on this but am very appreciative of Cosmicevan for bringing this over. ""Cheers!"""
"Notes: This is my 400th review."
"3.9/10"
"t - first shot at a real sample of this beer aside from sevearl few small samples. definitely a sharing beer. the mystique and hype around it confuse me...good but therea re many better...overall this is good, but not great (4)"
"O: I wasn't dying to have this again but I promised I would. This seems like something that is just huge for the sake of being huge. Nothing really pleasant about drinking this beer for my mouth or stomach. We could barely finish this among 4 people, I ended up pouring my last bit into the sink. My least favorite from FFF so far."
"O: Maybe I just don't get this beer but I was rather dishearten by the end result, The beer is so sweet and I struggled to finish a single tulip of it, It attacks you tongue with so much sugar and molasses that it's really hard to enjoy it, I read the reviews and let the hype get the best of me and traded two solid beers for two of these, I doubt I'll be so eager to seek anymore out in the future."
"Pours dead black, small brown head. Smells of roast, caramel, molasses, chocolate, slight coffee, exceptionally rich and not hot for 15%. The beer tastes huge, with flavors of all type pounding your tongue. Rich and smooth, it has a great blend of slight booze, chocolate, molasses, rich malts, and other goodness you would want in an RIS. Way too drinkable, I knocked out most of the bottle myself and then fell asleep."
"Edit: Everybody seems to say ""Alcohol"" taste, but I swear it was bourbon. It doesn't say bourbon aged, but it's in there."
"Overall this was fantastic. I would have liked some more foam to help with the aromatics but otherwise this was great."
"O: Super sweet and syrupy with a big licorice flavor. This was good, and I look forward to the day I crack my other bottle, but I don’t think it’s worth the entire amount of hype surrounding it. Some of the hype yes, but this isn’t the best stout in the world. Thanks you so much for the bottle, HosP!"
"O: Really, really, really, really, really, really good. I wound up with one glass. I'd have drank 4, and then been ridiculously drunk. That said, I'm a bit disappointed and I'mnot sure it lived up to the hype."
"O: Really a good beer. Hype proof? Far from it. This is the first time I've had DL, and there's been discussion about it being: a) not as good as previous years; b) really much better after it has a year or two on it. I can say this for the beer, it carries a high degree of baggage, and it is difficult for me to be satisfied with a beer that carries sooo much clout and then deviates from it's own description of the beer. I likely won't seek particularly aggressively next year; especially given the exclusive nature of the beer."
"Serving type: bottle/22oz."
"Drink- Glad I got to try this one. I will have to one day get to IN for the DLD and then try the other variants. This was good but I wanted and expected more."
"Narrative: Among the most challenging items on a daily basis that faced J.P. Cacoaworth was how to close the daily deal. Each day when he walked into his spacious corner office he took a hot snifter of bourbon and ruminated over the idea of closing the deal. Sometimes J.P. was as sweet as a candyman, providing settlement documents with a sticky panache. Sometimes he put the heat on and pressured the other party in by hectoring their better sense. He was a calm master of his trade, patience and full of sweet heat. Some would say that aluminum siding can sell itself, but they likely have not met the petulant master of faux wood coverings. “WELL IF THEY THINK THAT THEY CANT GET MOUNTING BRACKETS FROM ME FOR FREE, THEY HAVE NOT MET THE HATEFUL GOD OF WINDOW COVERINGS AND I WILL FLY DOWN ON MY BLACKENED CHARIOT OF RAGE AND IMPART FIREY SWEETNESS ONTO THEIR CUL DE SAC.” Today was a sweet day."
"O: Really enjoyed this beer and can't wait to (hopefully) have it again. This bottle lived up to the hype for me. Hopefully one day I can get over to DL Day so I can have bottles of my own instead of trying to trade for them."
"I don't know what I am going to do with my remaining 3 bottles (one each for 2009-2011). I may revisit this in a year and do a vertical. Hopefully some cellar time will help this sweetness come down to earth."
"O: excellent beer, worth the hype, alcohol is well hidden given the ABV, can’t wait to see how this one ages"
"Overall. Hard to believe the abv. Very little booze taste considering. Nice and strong but smooth and drinkable. Great at 1 year old and will probably be even better with another couple years on it."
"O: Very impressive. Overall much more balanced than I was expecting and incredibly enjoyable. The spice heat was strange, and half a bomber was enough for me, but this stands out as a great beer."
"O (D) - not bad, better than expected. Big, complex, and intense."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall I've had the 09 and 11 not the best basis for comparison but overall this is a beast of a stout."
"Well done!"
"O- I can see why this beer is such a big deal. Not my favorite RIS, but definately an impressive specimen. This is a beer that I could enjoy once a year. Oddly enough, it only comes out once a year. What a coincidence. Try it, its worth it."
"2010 version. Thanks to Adam for sharing."
"We had a vertical of this starting with 10, 09, 08. The other two were less memorable and I decided to review 08. Simply a descent beer that aged incredibly well and brought it to rockstar status."
"30 minutes: Roughly the same… coffee is coming in a bit stronger now though."
"22 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage (olive green wax). Big thanks to TrebleStauter for this brew, I've been holding onto this for a while now and figured I'd finally try it. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with a half inch brown head that didn't stay around for too long. Small amount of lacing left on the glass. Very sweet and rich aroma, it smells like dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and some molasses. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's very sweet. It tastes like roasted malt, dark fruit (cherries), milk and dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, molasses and a bit of charred/burnt malt. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's viscous and coating with low carbonation. It's very smooth and extremely easy to drink. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, it certainly doesn't seem like it's 15% ABV. I think this is a very good brew, I'm glad I was able to try it. If you like sweet stouts/RIS's, then this one is a good choice. Definitely recommended!"
"Considering I have 3 more bottles of this vintage in the cellar, I hope time helps this beer out tremendously, which is the general consensus I get with the Dark Lord vintages. This was pretty terrible fresh but will obviously revisit in a few years."
"Looking forward to ageing my last bottle of this."
"Had an 09’ white wax bottle at Ebenezer’s pub in Maine. Paid a hefty price but it was worth it to have this beauty. Very smooth for 15% abv. Though you can definitely taste the alcohol, it’s not overpowering. All other flavors come through, chocolate, molasses, prunes(?). Great beer, believe the hype."
"O: Not something I'd tackle myself but a great sharing brew. Feels like something to drink by the fire in the middle of blizzard with a couple buddies. I've had one or two RIS I liked better but that's not to say I'm not impressed. I'm going to hide one for a couple years and get back to ya... Cheers."
"o: Glad I got to try it, will seek out again...but I won't give up my favorite beers ever to get a hold of this bad boy. It is a fun beer to try to track down or get/give as a gift, but the taste profile was shockingly sweet for half of the taste. While the flavor was good, this beast uses too much sugar to cover the 15% and it still hits with a lot of booze. Tasty, nonetheless."
"O: I am a little disappointed by this one. This is the first Dark Lord I've had, and from what I've read 2009 was an off year for this brew, but I was still expecting a bit more. That being said, this is still a great beer that I would be happy to have again."
"O: I've tried a few years of this beer the 09' was by far the worst I've had and the 11' is the best. Still not a fan of this and I am not sure if time will make me appreciate this beer more..."
"Wish I could drink this more often"
"Pours pitch black with very little head that leaves caramel brown lacing. Smell is a tad boozy with slight roast, and a mix of sweet chocolate and dark sweet fruits. Not very boozy or roasty, but very sweet. Barrels of dark fruit with minor hints of chocolate and and roasted barley. Pretty thin on the mouth for this big of a beer and the carbonation is slight, but it's there. Definitely much better than I expected, but still not the best I've had from this style. I wouldn't specifically seek this year out again, but I wouldn't mind having another."
"Would love to be able to get more of this beer. this will always be on my wants list"
"Overall - Best beer I ever had by far. The flavors just balance itself out as the beer sits. Can't wait to try more vintage Dark Lords. It surpasses the hype!"
"CHEERS1!"
"Overall this is a great stout, but I do not see why so much effort is put into obtaining this. I rate it highly because it is good but I wouldn't put so much effort into this beer. If you get it then drink it, if you can't get it you'll be okay."
"M,O: This beer certainly coats the palate. It is very unique in so far that I had expected the beer to be slightly dryer on the mouth due to the strength instead there was a nice sweetness. I am interested to see how this beer ages."
"There are so many other imperial stouts I would crack over this and actually finish by myself but this is still a unique experience."
"O- Overall, this is the best beer that I've tasted so far. I believe the beer becomes more balancned and complex as it warms up. I'm anxious to get another bottle to cellar and enjoy this experience again."
"O - Very good imperial stout - 2nd overall in the group. A little bit of heat/bourbony warmth in here that worked nicely. This is also my second go 'round with Dark Lord. The previous bottle was an '09 and was a miserable experience that left me and the rest of my tasting group shaking our heads over why this was so popular as we actually poured half the bottle down the drain. This time was much different and far more enjoyable - I understand the popularity more now. Going into the tasting, we joked that this would be the winner (after all of us had the same '09 experience)...and in the end, it almost did - finishing 2nd to Kate."
"O-a bomber can be finished by one's self. it is a great stout, very very drinkable. the ABV could never be guessed to be so high. it goes down almost in a quaffable ease. this is an extreme beer though that everyone needs to try."
"Overall - Terrible and I don't understand the hype but to each there own. I could hardly get this beer down."
"O-this beer lives up to the hype. it's not just marketing or propaganda, this is a legitimate world class beer and a UNIQUE one at that. I've never had more fun drinking a beer."
"2009 white wax bottle. Pours a fairly thick black with some dark brown wisps around the edges. Nose is big, powerful roasted malts, dark chocolate fudge, some savory, almost soy sauce like qualities. Mouth is really hot, opens with a heavy charred character, messy and all over the place. Sugary and salty at the same time. Fairly thick mouth feel, with sharp carbonation. Ultimately huge, messy, all over the place. Some fun qualities that probably appeal to a lot of people, but to me it's kind of a chore to drink."
"Sips like it pours. The fresh one gave a nice coffee kick at the end that was missing from the aged one, yet the 2010 was a lot smoother and mellow. The flavors had melded a lot. Both are still very sweet. I have come to prefer my big stouts a little drier, but this is still tasty. Right now, it's a tradeoff between being able to taste the coffee and the mellow smoothness of the year-old. I think I need to save the others for next year's vertical."
"O-A great beer, so glad I went to DLD. It is worth the hype, I think there are better stouts. The beer does get better as it warms as a heads up, it is the best at room temp."
"This beer gets an ungodly amount of hype that I feel is worth every word."
"Overall- overall it is a very good beer. My only complain is the intense sweetness with the first couple of sips. As the beer warms, I believe it becomes more balanced and the aftertaste it leaves in your mouth is quite nice. I'm anxious to get another bottle to cellar for a year or so and see how that mellows the taste.  "
"The taste is just as complex, with all of those notes and more. For me the most prominent was definitely cherries and a sort of plum jam. Smoke is also prominent, and the mouthfeel is thick and sticky with lots of sugar residues. Ultimately it's very sweet and a bit hot right now, but I look forward to aging it and trying it again after it's mellowed."
"Overall I liked it, and can't wait to get my hands on a bottle of my own, or at least the chance to partake in a full pour sometime."
"There's no wrong time for DL, and I hope this is the first of many encounters!"
"A tasty beer, that could mellow with some time, it had a bit too much coffee for my personal preference, in a year or two this will only get better. For some the sweetness might be too much, but I think with the coffee, caramel, bitterness and malt, this turned out to be quite palatable, in the smaller portion that I had. I can imagine that half of a bomber would be too much. Very delicious, hopefully, these will be get easier to trade for and more people will get a chnace to try the beer."
"Notes - Really glad I tried this. Awesome beer. The heat actually works with the flavor as your mouth kind of ""cools"" after each gulp. I really enjoy this."
"O- My first Dark Lord, was not disappointed. A little too rich for me, but still was blown away. Definitely a sipper, great too share with a friend, look forward to trying one that is aged a bit."
"what can i say about the darklord, most look at this like a gigantic stout, which it is. but not the best of all of them, darklord is a very good but rough drink. very hot and strong rigid complex flavors, i drank out of brandy sifter. very good, just split the bottle with a friend"
"O - I have had a few of the other vintages of DL before and they have all been excellent. This one has aged very well with most of the rough edges being smoothed out and the over the top booze dieing down a bit. Excellent stuff. Thanks again Deuane."
"Overall, this one stands up to the hype and slaps it in the face. Big, bold, ballsy flavors come to the table and they mean business. Dark Lord has everything I want in a beer, tons of flavor, thickness, drinkability, and madness. This beast is amazing and I will be attending the next 60 Dark Lord Days to acquire it."
"Overall, this beer is worth all the hype. It's fantastically crafted and extremely well balanced. I'm going to definitely be attending the next Dark Lord Day!"
"Packed with flavor, not too boozy, and very smooth. Dark Lord is the real deal. I never bothered to try Dark Lord before because I honestly didn't think I would like it. Big stouts that are just a mess of alcohol, heat or cloying sweetness are not my thing; for example, I wasn't a fan of Black Tuesday and didn't like Chocolate Rain. So I went into trying Dark Lord more curiously than excitedly. The next occasion that I crack one of these will come sooner. With that said, I think 4 years of age on one of these was excellent, and I'm not sure that I would drink it with less."
"It poured jet black with red highlight when the wine glass was held up to the light. A gentle pour yielded a subtle head of tight tan bubbles. The nose was full of molasses, toasty malts, raisins and alcohol. First sips yielded a strange vegetal taste . It is very sweet with hints of dirt, and vanilla—maybe soft fruits. As it warmed, alcohol became more dominant with warming sherry notes and a hint of coffee. Full and round mouth feel. I was prepared to like this more than I did. I am sure it would become more rounded with age."
"O-amazing brew, FFF promises great beer. WILL be attending DLD!! hope i can get a few vintages as well as a few 11's.shared with a great friend=great memories and healthy palates."
"It was a struggle to make it through this glass, and I am a huge fan of dark, sludgy adventurous stouts. This was a big disappointment, and even if the wild array of flavors here was integrated well, I can't imagine it would be an above average stout for its class."
"A delightful beer overall, quite hyped, but worthy of attention. Not as sweet as everyone makes it out to be, very satisfying."
"Gonna do a vertical 07-11 next March of this stuff. Will update as to then, but for now, the '10 is right around a top 100 beer of all time for me."
"O- I can easily understand the hype surrounding this stout. I have to admit that I am not a stout fan, but this one easily made be rethink the style. This is an easy drinker despite the abv--does limit the amount I would drink--yet it is one that I would only open with a group of friends."
"Was really lucky to get a pour of this from esentman 2011 vintage. Poured like a great impy stout. Dark and viscous, but even a vigorous pour did not yield a head. The aroma was pleasant. Caramel sweet coffee and a pleasant roasty fullness. The flavor was a huge mess. Under attenuated and extrememy sickly sweet. Everything that was in the nose, plus some dark fruity flavors, was lost behind a curtain of sweetness. It was not the easiest beer to get down. Full mouthfeel that would be nice if not for the cloying sweetness. Thick and full bodied. I have heard better things about older vintages, but was really unimpressed with this one. Kind of disappointing. I really wanted to like this one."
"2009 Bottle: Pours out as a really deep black, a brown head that vanished quickly. The beer coats the glass for a little while after each sip. Smells burnt and alcoholic more like a barley wine, some really dark fruits and molasses. Tastes like burnt caramel, dark chocolate, lots of dark malts. Light oily and kinda thin, not much carbonation really. I was a little disappointed... I have heard that the 2010 Vintage is better, so hopefully that is correct. I have an unopened bottle of that year still waiting to be drank."
"Having had this many times over the past year and a half (while also sampling a ton of world-class stouts/brews), I have to knock the score down a touch. Still one of my favorite beers."
"O: FFF makes so many truly incredible beers that it's hard for me to call this their crowning achievement... but it is.... at least one of them. Believe the hype, because Dark Lord is the real deal!"
"overall: this one lives up to the hype, delicious all around!"
"I have had a lot of Bell's Batch 9000 in the past year (about one per week), which has been a steady supply of dark, fruity malt bomb. In that context, and given the hype around Dark Lord, the price, and the difficulty of obtaining, Dark Lord is just not nearly as impressive as it used to be."
"A bit sweeter than I normally like, and not very carbonated, even for the style (...but this bottle is FRESH). Would be a good serve as a digestif."
"Dark Lord 2010 vintage (green wax). Poured from 650ml bottle into a tulip glass and a chalice glass. Tasted the brew once cold and then gradually at room temperature for optimal tasting experience. The Dark Lord lives up to it’s name on the pour. The heavy bodied stout pours opaque black slowly out of the bottle and fills the glass with complete darkness that allows absolutely no light to come through. The glass is topped with a thin dark creamy head that dissipates quickly and with extremely light lacing that holds it's own throughout the session. Vinous aroma packed with sweet burnt molasses, currants, plums, dark cherries, vanilla, sugar-infused oak, toffee, sweet toasty malts, and maybe a hint of port wine alcohol undertow. Mochachino notes buried within. Motor oil consistency, hellishly smooth yet divinely burnt with amazing flavors and aroma throughout. Alcohol burn wiggles its way down your throat with a thick body. I cannot make comment on the carbonation as the brew is extremely dark. Man, this is a DANGEROUSLY good Russian Imperial Stout with the high ABV of 15% so well hidden. This is definitely one of the best 3F beers I've had next to the Dreadnaught! I can see why this is highly sought-after. This is also one of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts which sits just a notch above the Abyss, another personal favorite of the style. Two thumbs up and Happy Dark Lord Day! Cheers."
"Scores: Appearance 4/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Drinkability 4.5/5"
"O: Why do people go crazy over this? Dark Lord seems to be one of the most over-hyped beers to date. Not to mention that this is from the much-maligned 2009 vintage, so I didn't have terribly high expectations. I did, however, expect better than this. I would take a cheap and easy to find Old Rasputin 100% of the time over Dark Lord. I'm just happy that I didn't have to spend huge amounts of time, effort, and money in order to obtain this beer."
"[EDIT: I just had the opportunity to share in a Dark Lord 07-11 vertical and it has changed my opinion on the beer. 09 and 10 were drinking terribly and were not finished. 11 tasted like it had green peppers in it and maybe a little chili. 07 and 08 were alright. In general, a group of 6 people were quite unhappy with the beers collectively. The above review was 4/4/4/4.5/4.5 and I am downgrading it severely.]"
"D - I love this beer, its fantastic; it was well worth the wait; phenomenal; I would highly recommend to other stout lovers; would go great with a some desserts; whatever FFF is doing, keep it coming"
"This going down is big and really complex. There are things going on with the flavor long after the beer has gown down. I am thinking about what I just had as some lingering sweetness hangs around and seems to have a life of it's own."
"2010 bomber (green wax) courtesy of woosterbill. Thanks Bill. Pours a dark black with a reddish tint at the edges when held up to the light. A small light chocolate head leaves a ring at the edge of the glass after it dissipates quite quickly. Not very mach lacing at all left on the glass. The aroma has a very strong roastiness to it. Also huge molasses and some licorice as well and a little bit of coffee. There is also a quite strange metallic copperlike aroma that comes through pretty strong as well. Light alcohol noticeable on the nose as well. The initial taste is really sweet with the copper note coming through as well as the molasses and licorice. This transitions into some coffee. The finish is strong roastiness as well as a bit of booze with a pretty decent bitterness. Full bodied. Low carbonation. Syrupy. I don't really see this beer is that highly regarded. I found it to be way too sweet and syrupy. The strange copper note was not enjoyable either. It does do a good job of hiding the 15% alcohol, but overall I just did not find this beer that enjoyable. I split the bottle with one other person and we had trouble finishing it."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Unfortunately, this beer is much too sweet and alcoholic for my tastes. It's unique in that it plays on the sweeter side of the Russian Imperial Stout spectrum, but in my opinion it's a bit too much. I'm really glad I got to try it, but I can't say I wasn't a little disappointed with it."
"I've never seen any beer as deeply dark as this, well-used motor oil with dark brown foam. Very viscous, great to look at though. Very intense aroma and taste - smoky, very dark chocolate, coffee of course and syrupy fruit essence (raisin, plum etc.). The booze was not very prominent, I'm guessing due to age."
"O: Like Darkness, I was pretty underwhelmed. Honestly I'd take Yeti over either of those any day at the price point. I think these beers are far over-hyped. Perhaps they'll improve with some age, but fresh there's nothing special happening for me."
"O: A good imperial stout, not one for the record books. Still, this is one you have to try at least once right? Over rated in my opinion. Too sweet for its own good, unless you are really into that kinda stuff. A nice one to really sip on over the course of the night, gets better with warmth and oxidation."
"Overall: NOT a session beer. A great after dinner beer, shared with friends or family. If you're in Illinois (or close) go and get some on DLD 2011. You shouldn't regret it."
"O: A good beer to be sure, but I'm not loving it as much as the majority of BAs do. Very sweet, to a point where it brings the beer down a bit, but the complexity of this beer made my glass pretty enjoyable- easily worth a try."
"adds a tingling effect that works perfectly with the spice, vanilla, and molasses.A slight burn at the end of sips as it warms remains pleasant as well. Drinkability is fantastic for being a 15% abv beer - as a sipper this definitely could get you through a night. The sweetness hinders drinking a lot of this over a short period of time (outside of the large abv) but the way the booze is utilized is just about perfectly. Lived up to expectations in my mind."
"Drinkability: excellent, wouldn't know it's a 15%, flavorful and yet not too hot, and the carbonation being done so excellently really makes it go down smoothly and easily...too bad this one can only be had once a year..."
"Score 4.33"
"The grade for this reflects the 2010 version."
"d - this was a slow sipper for me... I can't imagine finishing a whole 22oz by myself... great smell and complex taste... the sweetness started to overcome me after awhile... I would definitely drink again, but like I said, not by myself..."
" Black, syrupy beer. Head recedes quickly and leaves little lace. Looks like it's going to be a big one. Smells super sweet and rich and complex. The aroma is almost like that of a quad. There must be a ton of ingredients in this beer. It's enormous. Dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, raisins, raspberries, licorice, and dry flavors too like a chocolate espresso and brown sugar oatmeal. Molasses and dark chocolate big time though. And the alcohol is definitely a presence. Slow drinker. Intensely rich and flavorful but also the alcohol catches up and slows you down. Really amazing."
"Notes: Had an 09 DL recently and it was a vastly different experience from the 2010 version. Overly sweet, syrupy, and beyond cloying. I would avoid that vintage. Obviously there is a pretty high vintage variation here. Avoid 09 DL."
"Cheers to OregonKnowsBest for the hook up on this one!"
"Drinkability: This beer is a big beer and needs to be shared. It would be difficult to drink this bomber bottle on your own. I drank this beer about a month after Dark Lord day last year and never reviewed it ""officially"" on BA. I think that I enjoyed the beer more when it was fresh. After close to a year in the cellar it seems to have stronger cherry flavor and the alcohol/alcohol burn seems to be a bit stronger tasting. The beer also felt a bit thinner than remember it. It is still a good beer, but has a lot of hype surrounding it."
"Awesome beer. Very complex and layered. It almost lived up to the hype which is saying something. If I were looking for a big Imperial Stout that displayed roasty characteristics I wouldnt reach for the Dark Lord. That being said, it is a monster and one great beer."
"D - I feel like finishing a goblet of this made me a man, this is a man's beer. Big flavored, heavy, booze laden beer. I will say, the booze and tanin type flavors do a number on the palate. It's delicious, but definitely a sipper."
"Drinkability is good, it has some very nice and bold flavors to it. It's a very big beer with some big flavors. I really enjoyed sipping on it this evening. A very good beer overall."
"D. Pretty drinkable. Too sweet for me - sweeter than any of the other stouts we tried tonight."
"D-redonkulously drinkable. Love it."
"Edit: updated... 2011 version is considerably tastier!"
"Cheers!"
"D- For as thick and high alcohol this is, it is drinkable, very smooth"
"I have heard that 2009 is not the best vintage of dark lord in general, so would like to try other years, maybe an 08 since i have heard better things from that year"
"Full syrupy body, nice carbonation, very smooth and slick on the palate. Drinks insanely well for the alcohol content with a nice, unique full flavor however a little on the sweet side for me. This was a pretty unusual beer compared to most big, boozy stouts I've had, but definitely one I'd seek out again."
"Digging my way through the bottle's black wax I felt like Howard Carter penetrating the tomb of Tutankhamen. Indeed, Three Floyds' Dark Lord does possess a similar kind of mysticism and veneration. Legitimately obtaining a bottle requires some combination of a mecca-like pilgrimage and Willy Wonka-like golden ticket. For one day the brewery doubles as a site of cult worship. And rightfully so. Believe the hype - praise the Dark Lord!!!"
"Weekend tasting results: Out of the only three RIS's we had in the entire tasting, beer finished 3rd following Bourbon County Brand Stout and Ivan the Terrible."
"Drinkability was good. For such a strong beer I was able to finish the bomber but I dont recommend it if you're planning on doing else for the rest of the day. The only downside to this beer was that after about half the bottle the overly sweetness started to get to me and I wished it was balanced a bit more. On the other hand, this stout pairs great with a Brownie a la mode and is the perfect dessert beer."
"D: Too drinkable! This beer put me on my ass!"
"Drinkability - While I do not taste the alcohol at all (no joke), it is just a very slow sipper and difficult to drink more than my portion. Not a bad beer at all, but...seeing as it is ""Dark Lord""...it just does not live up to the hype. I have a 2010 in my cellar and am curious how it will taste when I open it up."
"Drinkability: This is definitely one of the best stouts I have had. I would not crown it champion, but it is up there for me."
"Absolutely incredible, a brilliant full bodied RIS that leaves nothing else to be desired. A stunning and inspiring beer I could drink over and over again."
"Tasted at Sexual Chocolate 2011. A 2009 Vintage. Pours a deep black color that no light can get through and a small brown head and a little left over lacing. Smells of booze and vanilla and some brown sugar. Tastes of burnt sugar, sweet malts, roasted flavor and tons and tons of booze. Mouthfeel is medium and has no carbonation worth noting. Drinkability is mild."
"Overall: Glad to have tried this but it is so sweet, even with a year on it. Reminds me of WWS in SO many ways. The coffee tastes were very subdued and the roasted flavors were almost entirely missing. Not going to go out of my way to get this when I can get tons of Abyss very easily. Still a pretty good stout though."
"D: it is actually quite drinkable. i could easily finish the bomber myself. as it warms a lot more of the flavors come out."
"D: It is an enjoyable beer, and is insanely complex, but as a stout it comes up a bit short for me. The huge roasted profile and burnt malts that I've come to expect in a beer like this are missing, I think that mixed with a bit more of a hoppy bitterness would help to balance the insane sweetness of this beer. Hmm, this is something, but I don't think it is quite the beer that the hype machine has made it to be. I've also heard that 2009 is an off year, as well as that 2009 was a great year, so I don't know what to think of the beer. Interesting and complex, but I honestly believe there are better stouts out there."
"15% abv? Really? As I said previously this beer is so damn smooth for its abv it's incredible. By far this is the thickest, most viscous beer I have had to date. I have never had anything like this beer. I love every second of this experience. I tried not to have any high expectations of this beer because of all the hype surrounding it. This is one beer that I found has not just lived up to its hype, but surpassed it."
"D: This is a beer to be shared, that is for sure. Fantastic flavoring. Worth every minute that I stood in line for it. I'll do it again this year."
"I had really high expectations going into this one and was excited to try it after seeking it out, but I was hugely disappointed. I think I want to try this one again at some point - maybe a different vintage - but this one was a letdown for me."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly smooth and easy for the well-hidden 15% ABV. Love this beer! One of the best non-bal stouts I've had."
"Pours a wicked black color, a small dark brown head forms and quickly dissipates to the edges of the glass. Lots of sweetness in the nose, molasses, metallic dark malts, soy sauce and alcohol. Round and full bodied in the mouth, good carbonation. Rich malt sweetness with a subtle but balancing bitterness and an underlying saltiness that becomes very off putting after a few sips. A powerhouse of a stout. This is not my first encounter with the dark lord, i must say i've never been a fan and i dont quite understand the hype around this one."
"Really amazing."
"Drinkabilty - Its insane with this amount of flavor and alcohol how drinkable this is. Its so smooth and sweet i had no problems drinking 10 oz's but man, i felt it. If it was lower alcohol would have scored it higher but come on, its 15%, so 4.0 was pushing it. World class, a beer that lives up to the hype, cant wait for more."
"Edit: After trying the '11 DL multiple times since it's release I much prefer the '10. The two are not even comparable beers in my opinion. I found the '11 to be much thinner and I found it to be far too sweet."
"Drinkability: Very lucky that I was in the right place at the right time to share this bottle. I have some 2009 and 2010 that I'm curious to see how well they age after trying this."
"Glad to finally put my lips to this one, and thanks again Eric!"
"Good drinkability, even at 15%. This lives up to the hype, for sure."
"D: This brew is legendary so it's hard to be objective, and to boot these are local brewer heros to me. You've got to give this brew it's credit, it's over the top but it works, and all other Russians must be judged against this. 10,000 folks at Dark Lord Days can't be wrong."
"UPDATE: When not in a blizzard, this beer is not that impressive. Changed from an A+ to much much less, there's no coffee in the nose. It's just booze and soy sauce. Almost rubbing alcohol. Smacks you in the nose. And at the top of the palate. And the thickness isn't as great, it's almost runny. Dark Lord 2010 isn't worth slamming, but it might not be worth praising so highly, either."
"I am not in to Hyped beers by any means. Majority of the time they do not stack up to the hype and are costly. I have to say though this particular brew blew my mind. Whenever I pour a RIS and stare at the motor oil thick pour that forms a down right sexy chocolate colored head...I am in heaven. That pour and formations is a great start to a long relationship. The aroma was good for this brew it was not over sharp to my nose and was rather light. The flavors from this brew was what made everyone in the tasting take a step back. After the infected 2009 Abyss this made up for it by far. Taste is of a roasty/smoke flavor that has many levels to it. Mouth feel and drinkability are good. Being that this particular brew is a RIS with a high alch level, the drinkability surprised me."
"D - This is easily one of the best RISs I have ever had. I can see why this beer has a whole day dedicated to it and why people stand in line for hours just to obtain a couple of bottles. I was pretty fortunate to come across this bottle and have found a beer that has raised the bar for other beers to reach."
"As a side note, the Vanilla Bean Dark Lord might be some of the most fantastic stuff on the face of the planet."
"Ironically this is the only vintage ive ever had, and I liked it fresh better."
"D - I can't believe this is 15% percent. I am enjoying an 09' at the end of '10 but I can barely detect any alcohol at all. The flavors are exaggerated and it is sweet but not overly. I was very impressed and happy to enjoy this demon."
"Notes: I know a lot of BAs who say this beer is a mess. Well, it is - but I love it! It's huge and extracted, but the one thing that keeps my attention is that it's not boozey, or sickeningly sweet or slick like some high ABV IRS's (think Mephistopheles). Badass beer! Love it."
"2011 bottle consumed on 7/5/11 (running low on character space so keeping this brief) This years very well might be the thinnest feeling of the years I have sampled. It is much easier to approach and has a very distinct anise character to the aroma and flavor. A light touch of oxidation/soy included as well as the typical flavors of bitter chocolate, coffee and lingering sweetness/herbal touch of hops. Bold alcohol yet contrasted nicely by the residual sweetness that isnt cloying."
"Christmas tree decorating beer! Reviewed with my finacee. Jet black thick motor oil, quickly fading tan head. Can't see through it at all. Faint burnt red caramel color on the edges. Smell is off the hook. Vanilla, chocolate, cherries, burnt caramel, and coffee in the background. Tastes so good, like rich milk chocolate, laced with vanilla, coffee notes, deep rich malty goodness, no burnt flavors, no harshness. There are definatly some dried fruits in there but they are secondary. Smooth, well hidden alcohol. Deep rich body. Great drinkability for such a power beer. This beer, in my opinion lives up to the hype."
"D - Very pleasing and absolutely worth tracking down. Not sure if I agree with ALL of the hype, but after trying it, I certainly am a believer as to its ranking. I will definitely be seeking out more of this gem and hope to make it to a Darklord Day in the near future."
"Just 1 bottle left from 2009 white wax. Time for a review. Dirty oil from oil change is only way to describe the look. Not appetizing the first time, but something you come to love. Strange head that I can't really compare to anything. Mouthfeel is outrageous. Very unique beer. Very high alcohol that really sneaks up on you. One of best beers I've had."
"Full bodied and drink as such. Meaty and thick with low level carbonation. A sipper for sure and one that strongly encourages shared drinking."
"Glad to finally try this. Will seek out more, but not trading the farm."
"D- for a beer of this stature and depth to be drinkable would be one thing but for it to be one that is a ease to drink is another. I feel like this vintage is the best I've had of the last three years by a long shot. I've never had a beer like this. Of all the monster stouts out there this one takes the cake. Simply the best."
"Opinion: I would definitely drink this stout any day but its intense popularity, I can only contribute to the scarcity of great beer in the mid-west. Before I tried it I was ready to make the once a year trek to the 3 Floyds brewery to try this beer that has seen the top ten quite often on this website. After trying however I am glad i didn't do so, although road trips for beer are always fun."
"D - Ok. Overall this beer, for me, lives up to the hype. It is delicious and a great example of a RIS. It is strong but ages and mellows well, it is sweet and chocolaty and also has some slight roasted hints. The drinkability is high except for the fact that its hard to get and that its 15%. Overall this is awesome. (4.5)"
"D: Very good, but can't have a whole lot, a meal in itself. Nice!"
"d - Definately one of the best beers I've ever had the opportunity to drink. Can't say it's the best beer in the world but it's definately in the top 25."
"Drinkability -- Certainly exceptional. Top tier? Yes, absolutely. Best of class? Probably not, but still quite pleasing. Unique in its class that it does have a lot of the vinous/dark fruit character as would a traditional English RIS. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"overall I am very disappointed in this beer, for me it is a sweet syrupy mess, covered up somewhat by soy sauce. There are a ton of better IS out there. Perhaps, as some have suggested, I really just need to try one that has a bit more age on it."
"D: I was certainly looking forward to this one, but also have a persistent skepticism of hyped beers. This one lives up to the hype. Just an awesome beer. Hides the alcohol surprisingly well, too."
"D: I would have this beer again and again. It reminds me of a fine wine that has layer after layer of complexity. It's too bad that it only comes out once a year, but luckily I have a few bottles left for future special occasions."
"Pager# 12345"
"I've had Dark Lord before, although I can't recall what vintage and it wasn't a full bottle to myself. I think it's easier to see some of the flaws (if you want to call them that) when you have an entire bottle to yourself. This is a fantastic beer, but it's extremely sweet and the roastiness, while it does cut the sweetness, does so in a bitter, slightly astringent way. These things keep it from being truly epic, but do not take away from what is an excellent beer. When a beer reaches this level, however, there is nothing to do but nitpick. I'd be happy with another couple dozen bottles in my cellar, that's for sure."
"In total this is very interesting beer and one that any beer lover should probably try at least once. I'm already looking forward to trying my 10 edition in a year to see how that compares."
"This is tasty and very complex. However, I´m not sure if it´s a beer that I´d stand in line for or trade my other arm to relive the experience."
"This is my first bottle of DL. I love this style. As a local, I guess I'm spoiled by Kate."
"D: For 15% it is crazy drinkable, and so delicious that you want to keep drinking it. Definitely one of the best examples I have ever tried!"
"GET THIS BEER AND AT LEAST TRY IT!"
"I acquired this 2009 vintage (white wax) in a trade with enelson. The bottle was poured into 2 snifters, deep dark, tar like pour with a thin tan head. The aroma has lots of molases, and hints of coffee and alcohol. Molasses and light coffee are prominent throughout the taste. I was suprised the alcohol was still hot on this. The beer is heavy and sticky, and very lightly carbonated. A damn fine RIS, hopefully I will be able to try another."
"I need to get more of this, and actually take off work next DLD. its really good."
"Quite a tasty beer. Normally Imperial stouts are not my thing, but this was amazing. I shared this a while back with my brother in law and an Abyss. The richness and flavor are so abundant, that I could definately have again. Too bad it is hard to get."
"Update---just had the '10 version and it is AMAZING!! Lots of coffee, chocolate, molasses and some soy sauce both in the nose and taste. The trademark DL thickness is there and no heat whatsoever. Also smooth as silk!!! This truly is a fantastic drinking experience!!"
"I have sampled every year since '06 but this is the only bottle where ive had more than 4oz. My rankings are '07, '06, '08, '09."
"Poured into a tulip and McWhirk's house who is slightly annoyed that I'm typing up the review. Anyhow, this beer looks thick. It pours like motor oil, thick, black and slow into my tulip to form a thin mocha colored head, that thins our to sticky soapy lacing. The smell is dark malts, dark fruits; namely dark cherries and a bitter espresso and sweet bakers chocolate. The smell and the taste are much in the same. It starts with roasty malts and sweet cocoa flavor. Finishing nicely with a slight flavor is dark fruits and a slightly bitter coffee flavor and a touch of oak. This is very nicely complex. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It kicks nicely at the end with subtle carbonation that livens up the flavors. I would never guess this is fifteen percent by the smell and taste. The alcohol is hidden nicely, for all the factors of the mighty Dark Lord, this is very drinkable."
"D: The 15% hits pretty darn hard, and I would expect that many people would not like the molasses sharpness."
"Full bodied and chewy. You don't sip this beast, you eat it. If there was ever a meal in a bottle, this is it. Drinkability is excellent, but the alcohol makes it a true sipper. Overall, this is a world class beer."
"Thanks to Blake for his generosity in sharing the 2010. One would be hard-pressed to find a beer more anticipated and sought out (and, some would say, overhyped) than Dark Lord, so that it is hard not to approach this without quite some sense of anticipation. Putting all that aside, this is a wonderfully well-crafted beer. Even relatively young, this Russian imperial stout already drinks with the smooth character of a nicely aged beer. Redolent with big roasted malt flavors and a complex profile. Is it worth the adoration heaped upon it? One can only say that this a both a very well-marketed and well made beer."
"I found the 2010 average for an Imperial Stout. It's got some great flavor profiles and the layering is beautifully done. The soy smell bothered me personally. Not a smell I particularly care for from a beer and the alcohol burn was just way too much for me. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't stand in line to buy bottles."
"D- Average, there is a lot to tackle in a single bottle. The sweetness and soy flavors make it quite a chore to finish off a single bottle. I kinda enjoyed it however. Glad I tried one, don't think I'll trade for another anytime soon."
"Draft at Great Taste of the Midwest. 2008 vintage. Pours a nice black/brown color with a tiny bit of sediment in the glass. The head is tan that nicely laces around the glass. Just a stellar nose on this one with hints of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, dark roast, with a touch of some alocohol notes. Nice heavy/medium mouthfeel. The flavors at this point are nicely balanced and compliment each other very well. Chocolate, dark roast, woody, dark fruit, some vanilla, it's all there and is pretty nice tasting. I could see where people would say its a little sweet or too heavy but overall I think this is a pretty good beer and some vintages do deserve the hype."
"Finally. Couldn't wait to try this one. Thank you so much Gary for the bottle, vintage 2010. Reddish black pour with little to no head. Complex aroma of coffee, molasses and cherries and but also scotch (peat, smoke) aged port and a hint of soy sauce. Wonderful flavors of chocolate covered maraschino cherries alongside with dark fruits such as prunes and grapes. Incredibly tasty. The vinous mouthfeel showcase the flavors magnificiently without being too heavy. A beautiful marriage of the intensity of the american style with the drinkability of the European interpretations. Beyond my expectations."
"I know this vintage was a bad year, so I will need to try others and try them. But for now I am very unimpressed with this super hyped brew."
"Have had multiple bottles of 2008 and 2009.This rating is from a 2008 Black Wax Bottle. Tasted side by side with 2008 Darkness. Pours black and thick with a really dark brown head that leaves good lacing. Soy sauce chocolate, maple syrup, flowery. Taste is syrupy as hell with a bit of very dark roast and sweetness from the chocolate and dark fruits. Roast and iodine notes. Very decadent. Syrupy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Great beer."
"I have to give big props up to my main man TMoney2591 for hooking me up with a sampling of this from his own personal stash. Way to destroy the beer grinchery my friend! Ok so, this appears to be that darkness is spreading like Charlie Murphy as it is poured the head is a dirty brown color as it should be. Upon first smell I would have to say that there is a lot of stuff in here. Perhaps if we'd let this vintage it would have settled down a bit. Oddly my first whiff was of cherries, unfortunately the kind found it syrup rather than fresh off the tree. Other smells included: Chocolate, Bourbon, Raisin, bit of Coffee and perhaps hazelnut just for spice. The flavor is quite sweet and the intensity of the alcohol really gets the tongue, but the cherry is there on the tip of the tongue followed by a smooth creamy chocolate taste and a bit o' coffee to wash it all down. This is a damn tasty brew, it's a shame none of us have the patience to age it for a couple of years. I would reduce the harshness of the acidic/sweetness which is the only detractor right now for a fantastic beer."
"2010 vintage. This beast is killing off draft night. Boom-shaka-laka. It isn't the shoes, it's the Dark Lord. It pours a nearly completely opaque black brown, with some very faint highlights of rich garnet showing through at the base and on the edges. The nose comprises walnuts, dark chocolate, molasses, maple syrup, alcohol, caramel, brown sugar, black cherries, and a hint of oak. A buddy of mine claims he smells death in there as well, but the last time that hooded fuck came 'round...well, the less said about that, the better we all will be. The taste holds notes of chocolate syrup, maple syrup, Maraschino cherries (syrup and all, baby), coffee, cinnamon sticks. Lagavulin, cough syrup (damn, there's a lot o' syrup in here...), and some figs. The sweetness is ramped up a bit, as is the semi-tartness of the fruit. The body is pretty hefty, with a very light carbonation and a pretty chewy feel. Overall, a very nice, beastly stout, worthy of some of the hype, but not necessarily all of it. Good times, regardless."
"Pours blacker than black with a thick brown head with good lasting power. Heady aroma of dark malts, coffee and chocolate. Rich and full-bodied, this nectar was made for an almost agonizingly slow drink. Great array of flavors from malt, cocoa, espresso to bitter hops and peppery alcohol. The finish is long and flavorful."
"D- Great beer to share with good friends. I could easily open up one of these on every special occasion. Very enjoyable drink, that you should try at least once. Thanks again to Evbowski for the drink!"
"Everyone seems to want to praise this beer, but I am not ready to quite yet. I enjoyed it severely, and it was an immaculate experience showing me flavors and richness that I have never seen before - I am a better beet drinker because of it. But a great beer to me cannot simply be so one sided, it much show balance, complexity, and maturity. I think that this will absolutely get there with time, and could become one of the best stouts I have ever had - but right now it is just one of the most exciting."
"Overall, Dark Lord is one amazing stout. It has a lot of great flavors and deserves to be near the top. I am glad I have been able to try multiple years of this one as the beer does vary, but still are great."
"(D)- I have very mixed feelings about Dark Lord. I love the smell, but everything else is rather mediocre. This is so thick that it is hard to put down. The carbonation is also a problem for me. If this wasnt like a syrup, I would like it much much more. It gets better as it warms up, but after the hassle it is to get this stuff and how much of a chore it is to drink, I would much rather grab something else for the style. When you open one of these have at least 4 people to split it. One of the hardest beers I have ever had to drink."
"D: What can I say, this beer is incredible. Full of flavor and the alcohol doesn't really get in the way. This is what a RIS should be. Glad I could try this fresh, but I can tell it will be even better with some age. So glad I have another bottle stored away in the cellar"
"This is a terrific beer that is very drinkable considering the ABV. Outstanding offering from Three Floyds."
"I have been saving this bottle for over 2 years and am very happy that a. I waited and b. It lived up to it's hype. This is a phenominal beer and one that I look forward to acquiring more of in the future."
"Big thanks to fbm115 for this one! 2010 Vintage. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black as sin with a one finger tan head that remains for quite some time. Maintains phenomenial lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of coffe, malt, alcohol, and licorise. The flavor was of chocolate, alcohol, malt, bread, caramel, and coffee. It was heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of epic in all aspects. I had this before at a BA tasting thanks to mikesgroove and had to get my hands on a bottle for myself after that. Now I remember why... The flavor and aroma one this one is quite awesome and complex. It is one of the ones that does live up to the hype surrounding it. It is definitely a heavy hitter and while slightly chilled reminds you of this fact, but mellows out upon reaching room temperature."
"The taste of this beer was surprisingly smooth and never once made me feel like I was drinking a beer that looked like motor oil. The chocolate flavor is there with and underlying fruit flavoring, being finished up by a light alcohol taste. Something that cant be easy to do with a ABV of 15%."
"This is the best beer I've had in my life. I'm not even sure anything comes close."
"d - I thought this was a great RIS. I thought there was a little bit of heat, but not too much considering the high ABV. I think with a few months on it it will only get better as well. Still, it is one of the best RIS' I've had. Looking forward to trying again."
"Overall, I think I'm more excited by the hype and rarity of this one. I'll probably get another next year, but it's not my favorite beer."
"2006 Vintage. Pours black as pitch- no hint of color when held to light. No reverse cascading head, but forms a solid two fingers of wet sand colored heavy fizz that shrinks to a thin cap relatively quickly- but expected given the ABV. Lacing is also expectedly scarce. The aroma of blackstrap molasses, baking chocolate, and roasted malt are abundant even not near the glass. Some brown sugar and background smoky, charred scents with fleeting whiff of clean alchol- no hop aroma to speak of but a very effervescent and vibrant bouquet. The flavor comes in a powerful but not overwhleming series of waves. First very deeply roasted crystal malt with dark caramel and turbinado sweetness. Then rich dark chocolate and roasted barley flavor. Finally a snap of lowland coffee and raisny/date fruitiness that slowly melts away leaving a surisingly light aftertaste with hints of soft english earthy hop flavor for a balanced bitterness. The alcohol feels noexistent save for whispers of booze when exhaling after a deep sip- very well concealed. Ghostly alcohol and hop presence manage to balance a beer that is obviously meant to be over the top malty and sweet. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected as well- heavy for sure due to lack of carbonation- but its 4 1/2 years old and 15% ABV. Drinkablity is high simply because the aftertaste is not overpowering or cloyingly sweet- not because you would want another bomber. Perhaps a little past its prime but for a warm sipping beer it is still fantastic. This is worth the wait and price, and truly stands as the Czar of Imperials."
"Excellent beer, I wish the 09 (which I didn't really enjoy at all this time around) and the 10 (which may turn out good in a couple years) had that dark and thick feel to them as well."
"D: I've taken my sweet time to finally get around to reviewing this beer, and I have to admit that all in all, it's pretty much as I expected. Very solid RIS with an outstanding look, great taste, and feel. However, its not over-the-top-hype-train-amazing. Still though, seek it out, its undoubtedly worthy of praise."
"drinkability: It was an honor and it lived up. I can only imagine it getting better with some age."
"Consumed: 7/27/2010 "
"D: A true behemoth as far as Imperial Stouts are concerned. A real treat. However, this is pretty hot even after a year of age - what does it taste like fresh?"
"One of the most viscous beers I've encountered, but not pitch black. It's brown hued enough that a decent amount of light pulls through. Very low in carbonation, as little to no head is forming. Aromas and flavors reveal vinous qualities as well as dark currants. Fruitier than I would imagine an RIS to be. I'm wanting the slight hints of chocolate to be more present, but they are dominated. Really thick mouthfeel, lots of bittersweet residuals that remind me more of an underripe piece of fruit than they do of an expected chocolate/coffee combo. This was ""meh", especially considering the high quality and bolder flavors of the IST I had right after."
"After my disappointment with Darkness I wondered if the other ""hype"" Imperial Stouts were going to be worth the money and effort to track down. After two amazing nights in a row with Imperial Stout Trooper and now Dark Lord, I am a believer again. This is not my highest rated beer, but if I was judging on taste alone it quite possibly would be."
"D- I wouldn't go too high on this...the texture and sweetness make this a total sipper. Its good enough...maybe a little overrated though"
"Overall, Three Floyds Dark Lord deserves it's spot on the top 100, and the hype this brew gets. Although this stout is not perfect, Dark Lord is a well crafted beer that has revolutionized and defined what a ""whale"" should be."
"2009 Bottle. Finishing off a great week of vacation and following the sampling of many tasty DFH brews with this whale. Pours a black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of dark fruit, vanilla, and coffee, with hints of chocolate. I know its easy to get caught up in the hype with this brew. But as one that has sampled several top IS's, this beer lives up to its hype and high regard. Starts sweet with the dark fruit. Then creamy with a pinch of carbonation in the middle. The coffee is very subdued but gives it that spice right after the creaminess subsides. Then the gentle bitters carry you to the finish. The finish is excellent. The velvety chocolate lingers on the tongue while residue from the dark fruit is still present. Notes of vanilla on the finish as well. The creaminess of this brew is what really makes it so special. Many IS's are this complex but others tend to be more syrupy than creamy. Damn fine beer. Will age the other 2009 another year."
"This was way too sweet for an RIS. I was pretty disappointed. Would like to try an older vintage at some point."
"D - I could definitely drink one by myself and will the next time around, but this is a beer worth sharing. My brother in laws thoroughly enjoyed the beer. I imagine I will store two of these and plan on a Christmas Eve celebration once the kids go down. Sit by the fireplace and enjoy a bottle to myself. I can't get this taste out of my head. So long Dark Lord until we meet again..."
"D - 1 glass is enough if i dont wanna get drunk"
"A good RIS, but the more opportunities I have had to try it, the less I am impressed."
"Appearance was great to start off. Had a very thick head, as it cascaded after I poured it. Somewhat like a Guiness. After that, it died out to a very thin lacing, plus it was jet black in color, no light getting through it. Smell was super malty, plus had almost a merlot type quality to it. No real detection of alcohol. Taste was big and thick! The more it warmed up, the more the alcohol taste subsided, it was almost undetectable, which is very impressive considering it's a whooping 13%. Obviously, since this was so rich and thick, it was somewhat hard to drink by myself. I actually had to drink half one day and the other half another day. I shutter to think about how many calories are in this."
"Drinkability: This is a high octane big big RIS but its pretty smooth at the same time. Nice job 3F!"
"D- damn drinkable esp. at 13% and def. deserving of all the hype"
"D: I could probably do a bottle by myself but absolutely not any more. I think it is so thick my mouth would have a coating of dark lord for a week."
"Overall a perfect beer for New Years day, glad it had some age on it, because the flavors were still punching me in the face."
"D: Low. I may enjoy half an ounce of Dark Lord at the end of a long session. Any more is simply too much."
"D - I don't think this beer lives up to the hype, I don't even think it lives up to the ultra-cool label-packaging on the bottle. Of course it can and perhaps should be cellared, but I'm not crazy about how it starts out its life."
"Deep brown and dark as hell in color. Raisiny, chocolate hotness on the nose. Flavor brings with it waves of dark chocolate, cherry, raisin, vanilla & coffee. Thick and oily in consistency, with syrup-like texture. Difficult to fully express in words, but this was a beast of a beer that I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience."
"Have you heard his battle cry? The dark lord cometh and he thirsts for your soul! This stout is so black that light cannot penetrate it's depths, seriously, I tried to shine a green laser pointer thru it. It pours like motor oil, tastes like coffee and malice, and smells like boiled hell. This is not a normal beer, tis the port of beers. As delectable as the dark lord is, his curse is that you cannot drink much of it. 13% abv and an overbearing taste and thick consistency make this a special occasion beer. Damn good though."
"Poured jet black and thick! Little head, but can see some with a vigorous swirling of my glass. Nice alcohol legs on the glass. Very complex nose of molasses, brown sugar, alcohol, chocolates, cocoa, and coffee. Also a huge presence of raw malts and hops to balance everything. Unfortunately, I kind of disappointed with the taste. The only positive is that it hides the alcohol completely. The rest is a cloying sweetness of a beer. Straight table sugar sweetness. Obviously, a lot of other things going on, but the cloying sweetness is overwhelming. Mouthfeel is super thick and heavy and syrupy. Drinkability is nonexistent. Too much sugar and extra fermentables, not enough balance. Maybe with age, things will change. I heard that the 10 bottles are much, much better! I hope so..."
"D- Its very warm. The alcohol in this one is quite insane. It warms you thoroughly. The alcohol warmth lingers and the beer slowly creeps down the throat. Its quite a heavy beer as well. Despite all of this I love it. I wouldnt really have a problem drinking a bomber over the course of the night"
"Overall, a very good beer, worth trying if you can. Does it live up to the hype? Probably not, but that's not the fault of the beer."
"I cannot for the life of me figure out why this beer has such a following and such a high rating. It's a mess. I'd rather drink soda than this. Not a good offering from a fantastic brewery HUGE disappointment."
"O- World Class RIS."
"The mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy. Tastes right away of sweet sugar and molasses. Lots of caramel and roasted malt flavor. The dark fruits seem to be coming across more now after a few months in the cellar. A lot of stewed prune and date flavor come across. I cant wait to try this one in a few years and see where it goes."
"D: very good beer that lived up to the hype and drank pretty damn great even though it had double digit alchohol content. Tried the 08 and 09 vintages abd have to say that the 08 with a year on it drank excellent. Will definitely try to grab a 2010 version."
"High ABV and intense body make it hard to consume a lot, but it's so tasty I keep wanting to. Overall great, but sips in moderation better than it drinks with ease."
"Had the 2010 at a south sound tasting. Reminded me more of barley wine then a RIS, almost sockeningly sweet with little roast character. I honestly don't know what the hype is all about-Abyss blows this beer away on all fronts. Medium caramel color leaves long legs in the glass, smells of dark fruits and tastes is dark fruits, dates, figs etc. Really sweet, if the body were any thicker this would be not very drinkable at all. I get more notes of vanilla and toffee, but mostly fruit. Again there is no roast character at all to this ""RIS"" and I am glad I didn't trade something good for it."
"The 2010 vintage is definitely better than the 2009 and redeems the Dark Lord name. It is a good RIS that demonstrates the expected coffee, licorice, malty, smokey smells and taste."
"2009 was 4.0, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0."
"Drinkability, well, who are we kidding. Even on a curve for a huge ABV beer, this is not incredibly drinkable. But it's world class in every way and is something I wish more beer drinkers had the chance to appreciate. Special occasions just seem that much more special when Dark Lord comes to the party. Cheers to my pops - happy Birthday, you're the best Dad ever!"
"Notes - The mouthfeel was thick and full"
"D: 3.5 - Okay but pretty weird. High sweetness, which is fine, but could use some more roastiness to balance."
"O: I'm now a believer that the hype is real. #DLD2011, here I come!! Definitely buy enough to drink through the ages. 25 year Dark Lord? Yes!!"
"D: My first Dark Lord and definitely not my last. This was excellent. Deserving of the hype? Likely. This was very enjoyable and I look forward to the day when I crack open my second bottle."
"After reading my review from 2010, the one thing that has clearly changed is that it is more rounded out and most if not all hotness has faded. The head was not visibly present when poured, and it seems to be nice and still overall. I do pick up some chocolate milk flavors that remind me of the lunch cartons I used to drink in Elementary school in a way. Tons of roastiness, but the milk chocolate flavors may be more present or noticeable than I remember them. Three years of aging seems to have done a great job on this beer."
"Made a couple hour trek and spent enough time in line that I really wanted to love this beer. Darklord Day was a good time and I plan to go back next year so I'd say it was worth it. The beer's rating among the best in the world is deserved."
"Damn what a disappointment, bottle was a 2009, not sure what else to say, sticky sweet mess."
"2010 Dark Lord (Green wax) from bottle poured into snifter. Pours very dark and viscous, with small amount of tan head that dissipates quickly. The nose is complex with lots of coffee, chocolate and licorice coming through. The mouthfeel is exceptional, so thick, it coats the mouth. Upon sipping, again coffee and chocolate is prominent at first and then the licorice taste takes over as you feel the alcohol warm your throat. Finish goes on and on. But it is very filling...share with good company."
"While 2009 was about in-your-face kick-your-ass RIS flavors, the 2010 iteration seems to be more about complexity. This is reflected even in the changes brought about by temperature -- Dark Lord cold and Dark Lord warmed are like two different beers. It comes to full fruition at room temp. Let this one get there and you'll be rewarded."
"Exceptional feel, velvety smooth, chewy, pillowy. Tremendous drink considering the ABV, one of the best beers I've had for sure."
"Hype: justified."
"D - This is one hot beer. I am not really opposed to drinking high ABV beers (I knew what I was getting into), but the alcohol makes this one a slow sipper."
"Drinkability: I'm going with a 4 on this despite the super high ABV. It's too rare of a beer not to enjoy, and I got about 1 and 1/2 pours out of it. Granted, it's definitely a sipper and I certainly wouldn't drive until I was cool after this (regardless of how long it might take), but it's well worth it. The '10 seems to be a pretty solid vintage, but I'm curious to see how it will taste in about a year."
"Well the only other time I have had Dark Lord was at the release party for Hunahpu's. I was pretty intoxicated but was able to remember how good I thought it was. Well 2010 stood up to the hype, slapped the hype, then defecated all over it. This is a perfect Russian Imperial Stout, that is anything but hype. Everyone that sampled this bottle with me was amazed by the complexity of the beer, just as I was. The mouth feel was oily and creamy on the tongue. The flavors progressively changed with warmth, though one flavor of Cantaloupe stuck with me for a bit. Simply put; Darklord is Complex as HELL!!! GREAT BEER!"
"Truelly a remarkable offering here. Very complex charecters especially as brew warms up. Well worth the troubles one may encounter to have the privilege of trying this one."
"Overall a bonifide sipper. We split this three ways and I seriously doubt if I could tackle this one with any less than two guys. A little of this goes a long way. Well worth the hype just not sure if it's worth the hassel it takes to aquire it. I look forward to cracking a bottle in a year to see what time will do to this bad boy."
"Cheers!"
"Full bodied and chewy, this beer clings to the glass much the same as Ten FIDY does. I have some of the 2010 vintage, and will let them age a while as well. Another outstanding beer from Three Floyds."
"D: Very mellow, but complex. Very easy to drink, texture-wise, but a little too complex to gulp (thank goodness!)."
"D- I do hope that I might get the chance to have this with some age on it one day. I enjoyed the complexity and all the different place's the Dark Lord has taken me too. If you can get your hands on this grab two, one for now and one for latter."
"D - This snifter, only at a third of a bottle, is hard to put down. Between how rich it is and how sweet/cloying it is just a little too much. The alcohol is strong in the nose but not so much in the flavor cause it's too damn sweet. I don't get why this beer is so hyped. It's a good beer but hell, I'm more excited to have this with a few years on it once it mellows. It's good, but for the hassle attached to this beer, there are much better beers out there."
"Definitely looking forward to re-visiting this one again down the road..."
"Bottled, 2010. Wow, finally! Black pour, brown head. Nose is smoke, coffee, chocolate, raisins, soy sauce. Flavor is malty, smoky, coffee, bittersweet chocolate. Finish is slightly bitter. Thick, viscous mouthfeel. Excellent, but not sure it lives up to the hype."
"D- Definitely a sipper. The alcohol is fairly well subdued. Pretty balanced for a big stout. I want to put some age on this so it was nice to see what it tastes like fresh. I waited in line twice for this beer and am not disappointed at all."
"Now I have 2010 on the way, what a wonderful time to be alive."
"D-Very drinkable if you have someone to share with."
"Glad I had a few people to share it with because even 3 of us couldn't finish the whole bottle. Very intense brew that a couple oz's does the trick. Very tasty and complex though."
"I was a bit worried it would not live up to the hype. But this is hands down the best Imperial Stout I ever had and more than worth the trouble to get it. I love the sweetness in it. But there are plenty of great Stouts to keep you busy until Dark Lord Day next year."
"2010 bomber sample courtesy of Adil. Cheers my man! Pours an opaque black with one finger of frothy mocha head and speckles of sticky lacing on the tulip. Smell and taste are apple, vinous, wine-like aromas, leathery tannins, oak wood, green grapes, molasses, and suggestions of vanilla. Roasted malts impart chocolate, prunes, burnt toast, and espresso beans. I get some honey as well. Mouthfeel is thick, full-bodied, and gooey with a slick and oily finish. A ridiculously smooth and drinkable RIS. There's simply no way of telling that this is 13% ABV. Nectar in a bottle, thanks again for sharing Adeer!"
"Super nice, looking forward to revisiting an aged bottle at some point, there's a reason for the hype on this one, especially on vintage bottles. Wish I went down to DLD to stock up my cellar..."
"Drinkability is only limited by availability. I'd love to try to drink a few of these among friends. ABV is high but the brew is great."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good for such a big beer. The 15%ABV is detectable, but I very much enjoy sipping on the monster."
"An excellent imperial stout for sure, and I'm very glad I got to try this one. I'd also say its worth every cent of the $15 bottle cost too. I'm not sure it's a beer I'd personally place in my own top 100, though. It does have a great intense roast character, and there's a lot going on, but I'm not sure its as cohesive as other imperials I've had, and at no point did I feel blown away by any particular aspect of the beer (which is why no category hit 5). The Night Stalker that we had earlier seemed to work better for me, and the KBS I had a couple days prior was phenomenal. Dark Lord was very good, but I wouldn't place it in the same class as these other brews."
"D: Whoa! Not really. I could have many more of most other RISs. I wish I could give this one a better score, but it's definitely a sipping beer."
"While I didn't find Dark Lord ""all it's cracked up to be," I would not be opposed to trying it again. I would actually like to try it fresh to see if the harsher nature of the beer overshadows the sweetness as I presume it might. As it stands, this beer is still suspect in my opinion. I will certainly update & adjust accordingly if I have a different experience."
"Highly recommend to all!"
"The pour is oil black with a very small head that dissipates quickly. Totally opaque. Smells of dark chocolate, molasses, and plenty of sugar. Coffee is present but not very noticeable. Taste is amazingly great. Thick as oil and packed with malts, sugar, and chocolate. For the huge ABV this drinks well for a stout. Will look forward to popping the first bottle in 6 months to see how it develops. This beer deserves all the hype it reserves."
"The boozy finish (turbo-charged to 15% this year) knocks this down a peg or two on both taste and drinkability. That said, given its complexity, the 2010 shows immense potential for aging. Once the booze calms down a bit, I think ultimately this will go down as one of the best vintages of this beast."
"drinkability was great - the high abv didnt stop me from having 2 cups"
"Very dark, as expected with little to no head....as expected. The smell was intoxicating. Huge caramel, coffee, molasses/brown sugar smell. Taste was even better, again sweet caramel flavor, but the coffee came up more than it was in smell. Drinks a bit hot, but at 15% how could it not. This should age very well. Mouthfeel is thick! Overall, an amazing beer, and such a treat to taste. I'm thinking a bottle of this split amongst 5 or 6 people would be great after a good meal."
"Second best beer I've ever had, only behind Surly's Darkness (which was an aged 08 bottle)."
"Drinkability? If I only had more. This changed my mind on DL, after the drain pour of the '09. It is worth seeking out."
"this was easy to drink as it was much lighter than the vanilla bean and oak aged so this was far more drinkable. for 15% or so they say, this drank painfully easy."
"It goes down smooth would not want to drink a bottle per person but you could if you wanted to"
"2009 vintage, poured into a Duvel glass. Inky black color, light does not penetrate. Thick and oily, with no head to speak of. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisins and prunes. Huge roasted malt flavors, along with milk chococate, some vanilla and alcohol. Thick and oily liquid coats the mouth, and finishes heavy and hot. A good experience, but not up to the hype."
"Wow, really disappointed with this one. Had many before, liked it at first (maybe the bias of drinking an uber hyped beer?) but now I feel it is just falling apart. Really hoping the 2010 Vintage is better..."
"D- Is really good for this big brew."
"See you all at Dark Lord Day 2010."
"Additional Factors: '09 bottle, but I drank it on April 3, 2010 (Final Four Stout Saturday (ha.))"
"This is an impressive beer. I fully expected to taste this and walk away thinking it is overrated. And perhaps it is. I only know that it is one of the better imperial stouts that I've had. It isn't worth the trouble of going to Dark Lord Day to obtain unless you live near Indiana. But is it worth the trouble of trading for? Fuck yes! Again, THANKS, GbVDave!"
"2009 - Definitely very hot, some licorice and tobbaco flavors as well"
"Taste is very sharp & hot with almost a chili hottness. It's super boozy and pretty meh. Honestly it's interesting and I'm glad I tried it but overall it's way too hard to drink for all the hype it gets. I'd say skip this and get a KtG or an Abyss over this."
"Drinkability- Not that high. An 8oz. pour of this would be more than enough. Surprisingly it is the flavor itself that limits drinkability rather than the 13% ABV."
"This one is a sipper at any age. You're not going to pound 4 in a night and feel ok about yourself."
"This beer usually ruins my stomach with all the sugar and booze. Definitely an extreme beer that I appreciate but it's not really for me."
"this beer pours a very dark black color with a thin brown head that recedes to nothing over the course of the session. The aroma is exactly what i'm looking for in an imperial stout, the roasted coffee and caramel aroma carries over nicely into the taste, a little sweetness in the front and bitterness at the end. the full body and good co2 make this a wonderful sipping imperial, couldn't ask for better in this category."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a killer black and chocolate malt scent with lots of heat. Wow, this is what I'm talking about; very intoxicating. The taste is amazing! It has an incredible black malt flavor with a decent amount of bitterness and a nice chocolate edge. The alcohol is present, but quite welcoming. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a glorious beer! It's incredibly complex with loads of great black and chocolate malt flavor. The warmth endears me more to the entire experience. I'm sorry it took me so long to try this. Cheers!"
"Slow and steady. The flavors attack the palate and a high abv make this guy a little difficult to put back by yourself."
"Very thick, viscous drinker. Need to rinse your glass, and mouth, at least twice after having Dark Lord. I love the texture, but this beer is just much too sweet to be very drinkable."
"D= 5.0 this is a beer. This is the highest I've ever rated a beer and I do not give out high ratings often. I have yet to find a beer that actually compares to this. There is just so much going on in this beer that I can't possibly do it justice. I have been into micros for about 3 years now. I have tried approx. 350 beers ranging from hopping frog bourbon barrel, KBS, storm king to hopstoopid. This is the most complex beer I've ever had. I feel as if I had tried this beer any earlier in my beer career, I would not have liked it. I don't believe I would have understood it and I still don't believe I fully understand it now there is just that much going on. I can not wait to try this beer again after 6 months from maybe even a year to see how my palate has advanced. If god were to drink beer, this would be it. Special thanks to Sean for being a lazy a&* and Dan, It was an adventure and you should have went to jail, but you got it, you did it! Thanks guys"
"Pours a thick and inky opaque black color that stains the glass, topped with a very thin brown head. The head recedes quickly but continues to give off a strong aroma of fruity esters and vinous sweetness. The complexity of the aroma foreshadows the flavorful body which is thick, viscous, and flat. The drink is very similar to port and is packed with fruity esters including fig, prune, and black cherries and these mellow fruit flavors change from beginning to end with well timed transitions. There is also a strong and undeniable vinous character to the brew with light hints of smooth coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and delicate vanilla dancing on the background of the palate. The finish grows sweeter and warms through it graceful fade. Lingering complexity haunts you and lingering warmth eases your soul."
"Happy last friday night to me! Poured an 09 into a dogfish tulip while watching Chuck on the dvr. Pours a dense black with a whispy tan head after a semi-vicious pour. Smell is very heavy- lots of dark fruit, dark chocolate and molasses. Taste is similar with a slight alcohol burn as well. Semi bitter finishing kick as well. Wonderful creamy mouthfeel that sets this one apart from other RIS's- similar mouthfeel to Darkness IMO. Not the smoothest of the big guns, but damn good!"
"Yellow wax (11)"
"D- Deceptively smooth. The alcohol is so well hidden. I could drink this all day until I was comatose. High praises for 3 Floyds!"
"I love this beer, if you like dark beers it's a must try, if your a fan of RIS, you would rather cut off an arm then not drink this beer sometime in your life!"
"I saw another reviewer call this 'fermented prune juice'. I think he might be on to something."
"Again an amazing stout and 3F nails it on the head. Th eonly complaint is that it is a little too sweet. The taste and heaviness is awesome otherwise. This reminds me a lot of Black Tuesday with a little less booze, a little less sweetness (surprisingly, not sure how I even managed the BT), and less bourbon."
"I couldn't possibly state it better than Mr. Floyd, ""If you like big stouts, you'll love it. If you like M****r L**e, you're going to hate it."" This is one of the biggest of the big stouts. The super-heavy roast of the malt, the typical hop profile you'd expect from any brew baring the name ""Three Floyds", and the numerous adjuncts make this both super-complex and single-minded simultaneously. While world-class any day of the week, when aged for a year or more this one will surely astound your senses. If you can find a trade (or better yet make it to Muenster, IN for Dark Lord Day), trading anything excluding a Westy would be a good deal."
"-this is a good beer indeed, but i have to say i was a bit disappointed. it wasn't as bold and robust as i would have hoped and the mouthfeel was a letdown. i would definitely drink more, but as far as the big RIS's, it is not real high up"
"Overall, this is THE imperial stout. I'm highly impressed and would certainly recommend that any beer lover at leat try this one."
"Dark Lord has attained a status nothing short of legendary in the beer world. Does it deserve it? Yeah, I think it does. Considering its reputation and name, the bottle's contents really deliver. Everything about it is excellent. As I said before, I'm not convinced that it's materially better after two years in the bottle. But, there's no question that it holds up well over time. Dark Lord simply must be experienced by each and every BA. I highly suggest you seek out a bottle and experience it. I mean...you don't really want to anger the Dark Lord, do you?"
"A super sweet desert beer that I couldn't do more than a few sips. I split a bottle between 3 people and ended giving mine away halfway through. Where it excels in mouthfeel it really lacks in balance of any sort and I found that the heavy, fruity chocolate became obnoxious quickly."
"not much head, fine by me. it looks thick. when i swirl it around in my snifter ,it coats it with a thin yellow/amber emulsion, effectively tinting the glass. smells like a bag of raisins. maybe dates. but definitely dried fruit. taste...my palate is not worthy, so much going on. sweet, dried fruit, malty, a hint of hops at the back. mouthfeel is like no beer i've ever experienced. so thick, i swear i can chew on it. i just want to leave it in my mouth and nibble on it for a while. drinkablility is amazing. for something so thick, sweet, and so much alcohol, i'm having a hard time slowing down with this one. i just wish i had more!"
"I will never get to do something this thorough again. Thanks everyone."
"The 2010 is noticeably hotter and sweeter than the previous vintages. While it's still a great beer, the latest version could stand to spend some time aging in the cellar."
"A word to the wise. Take your time with this one, it catches up to you fast. The alcohol is hidden extremely well and only shows up after the bottle is empty!"
"Picked this up at DLD 2009,pours redish coal black with little head or lacing,almost an oily black,head dissipates quickly leaving the shiny black surface,huge smell of roasted malt with all the fruits and cocoa tad of anise,huge alcohol muzzel and upfront in your face ETOH,a little age will help this one,mellow a little and the taste will improve,a review in a year or so may be considerably different."
"J"
"A definite must try."
"D: This is a tasty beer, but one that you should definitely take your time with. The alcohol is hidden well in the flavors, but it will catch up to you."
"D - The strong alcohol taste up front, and the carbonation, are the only slight draw backs to this beer. As far as taste alone (and smell I suppose) this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Thanks to warriorsoul for sharing a bottle with me. So I finally get to try this highly sought after beer. It pours thick like molasses. Very little carbonation or head. Smells like dark fruits, raisins, prunes. First impression on taste is way too sweet. However, the hops and roasted malts seems to balance it out quite well. Sort of reminds me of port, a very sweet one. Although I can appreciate this beer for what its worth, I think there is more hype around it than anything else. I'd definitely try it again but it's not a top 10 or even 20 beer for me."
"D: Honestly, when I had it at DLD, they were serving it in cups filled up to 5 or 6 ounces, and that was about perfect. I opened a bottle at home and ended up drinking it alone, as no one else wanted any. By the end of the bottle, I was wishing I had one of the 5 oz draft pours. DO NOT take on a whole bottle by yourself."
"M/D - good flavor, very drinkable, a bit of an alcohol burn, but smooth and oily mouthfeel"
"A great and unique beer."
"I enjoy the DL every year in Munster, and I love 3F. Sitting here away from the reality distortion field, I don't think this beer lived up to the unrealistic expectations."
"Overall: Mouthfeel was very silky, however lacked good carbonation. It's fairly drinkable for how big it is. I really enjoyed this one."
"All in all, this is an incredible example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Very smooth and incredibly complex. Glad I got to try this one. I imagine even a few more years of aging would make this perfect!"
"I have never rated a beer so highly. The hype that surrounds it is dead on, my friends. It is New Years Eve, 2009 and I am sipping from a 2008 DL whilest enjoying a roaring fire in my living room in snowy New England. It doesnt get any better than this. The brew: pours thick, oily and dark into my stemmed Leffe Goblet. Having a weak sniffer, I need a big nose (no pun intended) to know i've got something special and I'm so not dissapointed. Dark fruit, raisens, prunes, currents, heavy dark chocolate and molasses all explode from the glass. Deep, dark chocolate, and maybe a hint of coffee with dark molasses sugar. As goes the nose, so goes the taste. Massive and complex, the dark fruit and chocolate bursts all over the pallate and the tongue is coated like heavy maple syrup, only balanced and sweet. This legendary brew boasts complexity like a super computer, yet is so smooth and pleasant to drink. No hop bitterness nor should any be expected, but the alcohol slowly navagates its way past your tongue and down, down, down in a warming yet very evident way. Very viscous and chewy, the mouthfeel is so very warm and inviting. Everything about this brew is warming. I am so fortunate to enjoy something this special in such a special setting. Believe what you've read, and get your hands on DL someday. Cheers everyone and Happy New Year!"
"2009 vintage. Pours black with no head. Very dark brown highlights at the edges. the aroma is very nice, with some oak and vanilla. You also get some milk chocolate and the slightest hint of soy sauce. The flavor is not as good as the aroma, but still not bad. The chocolate and vanilla are still there along with some roasted malt. You also get some soy sauce which is not a flavor I really enjoy. The mouthfeel is very thick and there is very low carbonation. The beer leaves an oily residue on the glass similar to a Samuel Adams Triple Bock."
"I think all the hype around this beer is greatly over rated. I have had all the great stouts and this being a good beer is not a great beer. It's good. There are other beers that deserve to be placed higher on the upper throne of Rate Beer beerdom board. This beer should be in the top 50 but not top 10. But that said this is the beer that started it all.The Dark Lord developed such a cult following it remains a top the ratings, This beer is thick on the palate and almost oily to drink. Lots of flavors come out and almost changes with each sip as it warms. Worth seeking out but there are better beers to be had.The 09 version of this is the best batch yet!"
"Merry fucking Christmas to me, and I'm going to enjoy every sip of this bad boy until I finish off the bomber, then I'm going to start making plans on getting my greedy hands on next years batch."
"This has been one of my favorite beer experiences."
"D-this is way too sweet, a little one dimensional. huge body and nice feel but just so sweet. age helps but still too sweet (did a verticle of 07-10 on 5/22/10, all were too sweet and quite one dimensional, 09 was the worst in everyone's opinion, I like 08 the best but again just candy for grown ups)."
"Thoughts - A HUGE thanks to Jeff for bringing this to the tasting. 2005 vintage. Good golly this was delicious."
"2005 bottle. Black pour with a small, dense, lasting, tan head. Powerful roasted coffee bean nose. Some oxidation in the aroma leading to a grape jelly/soy sauce/bbq sauce like quality. Flavor is big coffee, molasses, brown sugar, cocoa, and some alcohol. FULL body with a notable alcohol warming."
"D- For a 13% monster this beer is pretty drinkable...it has had 1.5+ yrs behind it which probably tames it, but its one of the most drinkable beers I've had with this high ABV. This is a rare treat that I doubt I will have the opportunity to have again anytime soon and I really am enjoying it. Best stout ever? No. Worth the hype? debatable. Great, high quality product? Yes."
"The beer is pitch black with a tan head. Tons of black malt with chocolate, black malt and hopiness. Fucking ace. Tons of roasted malts and black malt. The balance is phenominal. This is so tasty. Every flavour from a roasted molasis to a smooth hoppy flavour is here. I could drink so many of these. Fucking beautiful!!!"
"My overall impression was that a year of age didn't make these two beers very different, but it was the batch to batch variation. 2008 was a nice, big stout but not the greatest. 2009 was just simply bad, with soy sauce and metallic off flavors dominating."
"Taste was crazy...would not even know the alcohol content was as high if I didn't know. Very, very sweet flavor. Very strong in the raisins and cherries. Chocolate on the back side. Since it's so thick though, a little tough on the drinkability scale...although...so tasty it makes up for it! Awesome beer!"
"M: Great, Thick, Leaves that flavor in your mouth that begs you to drink more. Mildy carbonated so as not to strip your mouth of all it's flavor, but enough to go down smooth."
"Tastes of ripe plums, caramelized sugars, prune. Lots of sweetness, but also some nice ripe dark fruits. The finish has some roast to it, but it does finish sweet. Chewy, silky body with a moderate level of smooth creaminess. Definite dessert beer, somewhat cloying. I do really enjoy Dark Lord, the older the better. The most recent vintage is not drinking nearly as nicely as this 2008."
"Once I got past the look of it, this beer was fantastic. Again, I have to give it up for Chris for hooking me up with this bottle. Thanks man!"
"Definite sipper of a beer. Works well as a dessert drink. I'm thankful I'm sharing a bottle with my wife as I couldn't drink a whole one myself. Can't detect the 13% ABV in this one. Probably won't seek this out again. Didn't quite live up to the hype for me."
"Overall Dark Lord was a phenomenal beer. I don't think it is worthy of traveling across the country for, but few things with that much hype live up to 100% of it. This is definitely in my top 10 of beers, and I look forward to the next time I can enjoy Dark Lord."
"In the end, I'm thrilled I got the chance to try this one, but I was left wondering where the hype comes from. I enjoyed it, but I'm not quite sure how its top 10 material."
"I want to try Dark Lord again (perhaps another vintage), but I'd be a fool to go whole-heartedly after it. An exclusive beer from such a great brewery that I don't even like--how does this happen? I'll finish it only because of these non-taste factors. I'll point out, however, that I actually drain-poured a small portion to eliminate glass contamination possibilities. Rarely do I drain-pour even a portion of ordinary brews, much less a brew like this."
"I have loved everything else from Three Floyds...besides this one."
"After some warming I'll change my tune a bit. The sweetness does kind of overtake this one after a bit. Reminds me of some of the Weyerbacher stouts. Of the A+ RISs, I still put Abyss a notch above."
"Take two and save one in the cellar for a special occasion."
"Overall impression: Not a beer I'd seek out again. I realize that rarity/hype/degree of difficulty in obtaining can obscure objectivity to some extent, but I'm astounded that this has an A+ rating with almost 600 reviews. A complete mess, IMO."
"Had 2009 at the fall Beer Advocate tasting in Portland at Victory Bar. Pours black with a small head, no lacing, and the smell is all sugar and alcohol. After reading a lot of reviews, I was actually surprised the mouthfeel wasn't thicker. GIBCS is sludge, this was what you'd expect from any RIS. The taste overall is sugary sweetness, hints of coffee, molasses, more sugar, vanilla, burnt toast, brown sugar, and chocolate. This thing could give you cavities faster than Coca Cola. Overall it's fine, but without a cool name, bottle design, limited availability, and a rad event with it, there's no way it'd be even Top 20 on this website."
"A sipper and a very sweet tasting one at that."
"D- Definitely have to knock of some points here. the sweetness really takes a toll on me. I could drink alot of this, for sure. I just can't drink on it too fast, which is probably a good thing for my liver's sake."
"D - This beer is a sipper between friends. Drinkability and this beer don't go hand in hand. A small 8 ounce brandy snifter of this one is all of it I can really take."
"Overall, great beer and my Brother in Law and I are making plans to get out to the DLD next year to get a few bottles of this."
"D - Excellent. Loved every sip of it. Again big thanks to Third and Mac."
"Lucky to have been in the right place at the right time for this one. Will absolutely be in Munster, IN next summer on DLD."
"D - I gave this a 5 not so much that you would want to drink a bunch at once however so delicious I would have to seek more out."
"This was the highlight of a night full of amazing beers. Cheers to the most generous of hosts!"
"Dark Lord has everything going on, right down to the label art and white wax. It deserves its reputation as one of the finest beers in the world. The rest of this bottle and I are signing off for the greener pastures of hi-fi adventure."
"Definately hyped, but it delivered."
"D - Well, drinking too much of this can be difficult, but I don't think the beer is meant for that. I think about 6-8 ounces is the optimal amount. Like the idiot that I am, I downed a bomber of this and a 750ml of Speedway Stout the same night. My stomach did not appreciate that."
"Dark Lord pours dark black and lets no light through, whatsoever. Minimal dark brown head. Very threatening beer, but I'm up to the challenge! The aroma is mostly roasted malts, dark roast coffee, bourbon whisky, dark fruits (namely raisins), and very vinous all around. No doubt there is booze in this beer. Dark, sweet maltiness and rich, bitter chocolate up front. Very sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The roasty qualities and bitterness balance one another. Burnt flavors come at the end. Alcohol is not hiding in this beer, and I think that's the point: it is supposed to kick your a**! Thick, motor oil mouthfeel coats your mouth and leaves a lingering sweetness and coffee flavor. My lips are dry, and wanting more. I will definitely be going back next year!"
"I enjoyed this festival, going next year and as long as they keep doing this. Love your neighbor."
"I am really fortunate to have tried this before I die. This is a must have for sure."
"one of the thickest and chewiest beers ive ever had (again, much UNlike the 2009). fantastic mouthfeel. drinkability takes a hit because of ABV, thickness, and how sweet it is. very filling"
"The high alcohol is pretty well hidden, so you need to sip this slowly. Splitting a bomber between the two of us left us both feeling good about life. Still, this is definitely a tasty beer that's always good to have."
"D: OK, it IS really good, but I'm holding it to a high standard here - Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, and the KBS wins. Too much alcohol to keep 'em coming, but I was happy to partake of this guy."
"This is a great brew but not as great as the hype suggests. Still, it's among the 10 best imperial stouts i've ever had and a very much enjoyable."
"Drinkability is high just because I'm drinking a whole bomber by myself and do not feel overwhelmed in the least. This is a rich, deep, dark beer but it is also extremely tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would have another anyday! This is a beer that lives up to the hype for me."
"2008 Bottle tasted at Dark Lord Day 08. Pours pitch black with a nice tan head. Has smells of licorice, chocolate, roasted barley, and alcohol. Has a heavy mouthfeel and coats the glass like a thick syrup. Tastes like candy, licorice, molasses, caramel, coffee, vanilla, and alcohol. Has a smooth finish for being fresh. I would have thought it would have more pop being fresh. It was an unexpected surprise and enjoyable to have such a smooth brew this early in its infancy. I tasted a 07 while waiting in line and it had a much more pronounced licorice taste and flavor than a fresh dark lord. Perhaps its just that the 08 will be a better batch. Only time will tell. Great beer. Worth the hype."
"D: Good but not great. I could definitely do a bottle in a sitting but would probably pass on a second. Works your palate for sure."
"Poured a pitch black with a tan head that hung around for a bit and left a nice lace. The smell was great! Malty, chocolate, coffee and a hint of maple sweetness? The taste was very good too, not overbearing. Just a smooth huge beer, if thats possible. M: & D: I'm lucky enough to have some of this aging in the basement and can't wait to have some more! Get some if possible!"
"MF&D - the drinkability is perfect. no question about it; this beer is too tasty to care about the calories or the abv. the only problem is that the beer gets a bit watery during the tasting process. this is kind of ridiculous considering how thick the beer is. but either way, this brew is still ass kicking phenomenal, better than anything I have ever had. period."
"D: Very deserving of the attention it receives"
"I've had this beer a couple times fresh and have never been impressed. Way too thick and oily. There's also an overpowering dark chocolate flavor that takes over the faint cherry tones. This beer definitely needs a couple years to age. I haven't had the chance to taste one more than 2 years old so I might revise this rating in the near future."
"I hate to be ""the guy"" that pours out Dark Lord, but what a cloying, syrupy, sickly sweet mess this beer was. I just could not bring myself to go any further into the bottle. I really can't give this anything above an F considering that it's so expensive and I had to drainpour TWO bottles (in other words, the ""possibly bad bottle"" excuse doesn't apply). What a trainwreck."
"Overall: I would have to say I was a little disappointed by this year's edition, but like I stated before...a great RIS that should be consumed by everyone. Cheers!"
"D: Rather not"
"Is this beer worthy of all the hype? Its hard to say. This very well may be the best Imperial Stout I have had, but its not leagues above other great stouts out there. Great Divide Yeti, Southern Tier Blackwater Series, Bells Expedition, and any Stout from Founders are all in the same league as Dark Lord. Dark Lord is exremely enjoyable, but it will not change your outlook on the style or make you forget about other classic Stouts you enjoy. Well worth seeking out if you can find it."
"2008 vintage. This beer pours a thick used motor oil black. The head is minimal, and recedes into nothing within seconds. The aroma is of roasted malt, dark and milk chocolate, and graham cracker. The is a very strong aroma, but it isn't a very complex one. I keep smelling hoping for something more, but come up empty. Still, there is enough there that it is enjoyable. The taste is big and burly, but again there really isn't much complexity. There is lots of roasted malt, and oily chocolate, and more than enough hops. In fact the hops here just aren't sitting well with me. They seem to be taking away too much from the malt profile. The mouthfeel if very full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and an slick, oily texture that is almost slimy. I really don't like this mouthfeel. Overall, I think this is a decent beer, but certainly not one of the best. I'm glad that others might live it, but I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone."
"Poured as dark as night like 10W-30 motor oil w/ a thin ring of light brown carbonation on the outer edges of the brew. No lacing to speak of. The nose was of roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, figs, plums, and charred fruit. The charred fruit in the middle was what amazed me the most - like it should not have been there, but fit perfectly! The taste was on point w/ the nose, coating the palate w/ charred fruits and sweetness up front, and finishing w/ Belgian dark chocolate and espresso beans. Imagine making a Black and Tan w/ an English Barleywine and a Russian Imperial Stout and you should be able to get an accurate picture of the taste of this brew. Mouthfeel? This was by far the chewiest brew I have ever sampled. Like the smoothest silky puree imaginable. Despite the chewiness and I mean chewiness, this brew tasted so amazing that like Lionel Ritchie says ""All Night Long!"" Well deserving of all the hype and accolades, this brew did not disappoint. Cheers to Three Floyds for this creation! I almost gave this brew a perfect score, and my tasing partner and I both agreed that this was as close to perfection and beer heaven as we had both been! I could only imagine how this brew tastes w/ age."
"Anyway I knew this beer could in no way live up to the hype and it didn't but I'm still glad I finally got to try it. Awesome beer."
"Overall, it didn't quite live up to the hype in my opinion, but still an exceptional beer. I would've liked a little more coffee and chocolate flavor from the roasted malt, and a little more hop balance to the sweetness. I also would recommend giving this one much more time in the cellar."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable. Got to watch myself."
"If I could get this easily I'd probably drink it. Wait in line for it? Um. No. I don't think so."
"Had a few more bottles since my original review and I must up the score on this yup bottle #1 was bad I have drank another 09 and an 07 and both were superb"
"D: So, what to say about this one, the dark lord, one of the white whales? Well, it's just a great beer. Fantastic mouthfeel, rich and powerful taste, and very complex. However, it's a little on the sweet side, so it's not perfect. But I actually think it manages to live up to it's reputation."
"D: Very excited about having it. No regrets. Met the hype. Serving it warmer than recommended definitely was the way to go. Dangerous stuff - very potent but the alcohol is pretty well masked and it's so tasty, you find yourself drinking it quicker than you intended. Really great brew."
"I've had multiple samples from different years. Figured I might as well rate the fresh sample, so this is for the 08. Pour pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, and a bit of cherry. Flavor is up front coffee, chocolate, molasses, caramel, toffee. Very viscous. This clings to every part of my mouth. A bit of hop bitterness, some hint of the abv."
"This beer has forced it's way into my current top 5."
"okay, let's be honest about the drinkability though... a full bomber of this all on my own would kill me..."
"Overall, this is a remarkable beer...one I would be happy to drink many times over. It was well worth the trip up to Three Floyds, and worth the wait in the huge line. It's warming, deeply complex, and absolutely delicious."
"Blipped ""Personal Jesus"" by Marilyn Manson"
"Wow. I finally experienced the Dark Lord ('07 edition) after the birth of my boy. It poured like oil, and looked as dark. There was very little brownish head that laced the glass with each sip. The taste on my palette was chocolate syrup, followed by black coffee and then a strong stout. It was VERY thick. I couldn't finish a bottle by myself, but thanks to Mark who brought it for me, we finished it off."
"Appearance is very good. A deep deep black that sheds no light. Pours like oil. Smell is good as well. Some nice figs, coffee, curant and alchohol come through. Taste is very similar but there is the typical underlying ""bacon greasy"" taste. Mouthfeel is out of this world good. Heavy heavy beer with some carbonation. Oily and slightly sticky. Drinkability is average- I've had more drinkable RIS's but this one is very good for what it is."
"Not a drinkable beer at all. Don't have a clue why this one is rated so high."
"I can only imagine what the vanilla bean and the oak aged dark lord have to offer."
"The beer is full bodied with a nice medium level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, chalky, and dry."
"Overall, I have had older vintages and after opening this one up a little bit of age will really improve this one. Still a solid RIS."
"D: This thing is 13%?!?! Would have never guessed that from the taste of this thing. Goes down way too smooth for a 13% beer. I was the first one done and that saddened me and I wished I had more to drink. Sadly, no, it was all gone. I'm really glad I got to try this and if you are able to get your hands on this, you will not be disappointed."
"Drinkability: This one started out a little shaky, but after the first sip all was forgotten. What an amazing beer! Unique, complex, and freakishly smooth. So, so happy that I still have a 2008 DL lying in wait."
"D: No doubt an outstanding RIS, but it's still not as good as some that are both cheaper and readily available. A year or two of aging may change all that."
"D= great beer no doubt but the drinkability suffers. Great for sitting on a rainy day and sipping on. Really lives up to the hype. Awesome special occasion beer."
"Amazing!"
"D (3.5)- High ABV presences, molasses. I'd rather have other imperial stouts."
"D: Takes a hit here. Maybe unfairly, but, what a great beer to share with friends, and discuss."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly viscous and refuses to leave your mouth. This seems to be the consistency of used motor oil. Drinks incredibly slow and it sips for a long time but I could literally drink this all the time besides to be refreshed. The dark lord has forced me into submission and has enslaved me to his will."
"I would not want this beer to be widely available nor would I want it all the time but there is nothing I will not do to make a trade for one each and every year from this point on."
"D: Wow. A sipper for sure."
"Cheers to everyone who contributed a bottle, it was very interesting to see the differences."
"All in all, I don't think this beer deserves the hype. I'll put some age on the other bottle I have and maybe my opinion will change."
"Had the '09 again today, Thanksgiving, with about 1.5 years on it. Definitely mellowed out a bit, improving with age I would say. The sweetness has subsided a bit, but still loads of chocolate cake flavors, raisins, etc as mentioned in the original review. I still think this beer, while impressive and delicious, lacks that certain something that holds it all together, and is therefore not a super drinkable beer. Good, but not Lordly."
"i understand why somebody would LOVE this beer, but I dont understand why EVERYBODY does. Its far too sweet, almost a sugar bomb. Not roasted enough for me."
"D: Certainly a delicious beer, but beware trying to drink this whole bottle on your own. Definitely a behemoth task. So rich and chock full of flavor that this is definitely a beer to be enjoyed on special occasions, and in small, savored amounts (share with friends and rejoice!). Definitely something all stout fans should try at least once..."
"Bottle 2009 500th rating Pours a Deep purplish black witha thin tan head that leaves very quickly.Has a light lacing but is a thick residue. The aroma is all over the room. It is of vanilla, alcohol, chocolate, and lightly broasted coffee. The carbonation was light. Mouthfeel is excellent. The flavors are complex but keep your tongue thriving for more. This is blended very well. The alcohol is well hidden. All this going on leads to a wonderful finish with an aftertaste that makes you never want to finish. This one has a syripy texture, very think. I waited a long time to get one of these and it was worth the wait. I may have to get out to the DLD next year or every year if possible. Very well done."
"Dark Lord has been such an amazing beer to follow over the years. The hype surrounding it, acquiring it, the fact that Dark Lord Day has become an annual pilgrimmage for me and my friends from all over the world, I have a hard time saying that this is not one of those charmed, magical beers that will always be considered among the greatest in the world. Due to such hype, it has also become a beer many love to hate. Regardless, when compared in class next to its peers it is a distinctive, singular example of Russian Imperial Stout. Is it overdone? Of course, when compared to Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout. Whereas, say World Wide Stout, it seems quite balanced. I personally love it, even in blind tastings...the rich, velvety mouthfeel makes me stop in wonder. This beer, though rarely makes it out of the beergeek circles. I love to see non-beergeek reactions to it. Especially, the wine crowd always finds it immediately delicious, if not at least incredibly intriguing. I have taken many notes on the Dark Lord in all its incarnations and read all the reviews, but nothing really prepares the uninitiated for its overwhelming power and weight. It makes the so-called ""big beers"" seem little. So, it is sentimental for me. A friend that I always anticipate the visit each year. In fact, a recent discussion I was involved in all agreed that Dark Lord should only be for Dark Lord Day. It has been sad to watch the Ebay phenomena. It was sad to see the behavior of those skipping lines last year and all the disappointment. You have to remind yourself, this is just beer. When I attend beer tastings, it almost always the first bottle popped and first bottle finished. If someone doesn't bring it, people remark that the ""big guns"" didn't come out. Dark Lord has become a cornerstone of the BA community. But what makes this so special that it receives this kind of adulation? That is the point of my review. 2008 is my favorite, followed by 2010, 2006, 2007, and in a distant last, 2009."
"One of the most unique beers I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is a must try for any BA. A supreme RIS by any standards."
"2005 vintage bottle shared by CaptainCougarthis past march. Pretty much solid black with a brown head. Dark chocolate, dried fruit, super malty and roasty, light alcohol, all nicely mellowed with age, adding a light oxidized touch to the nose. The flavor is intensely coffee packed, dark chocolate laden, and fruit filled, while also being hoppy and pretty bitter. This stuff is just so thick, I can't even describe it. Definitely the thickest beer I've ever had. Honestly, the verdict is out on whether beer should even be this thick, but I have to give it a 5 just for accomplishing that. Definitely unique and intense stuff. It is hugely rich and sweet, yet seems to pull off a pretty good balancing act. Big thanks to Tom for pulling this out. A great way to end my time in DC."
"Dark, almost black with a thick dark head of mousse that leaves ultra fine lace on the glass. Dark chocolate, anise and rum combine in the nose. Fudge, black licorice and rum with a charred bitterness that lingers long after the first sip. The taste still lives up to the ever growing hype surrounding this beer, the complexity grows as it warms. Smooth and viscous, it coats the mouth and throat nicely. This is a fantastic brew that will only get better with time."
"I had this at a Three Floyds dinner in January, but they served it at the end of the dinner after 13 other beers, so I was in no state to taste it properly. I had it on-tap at Dark Lord Day, but I had tried thirty or so different beers before that. Again, not in a state to taste it. I have three bottles from DLD this year so I decided I needed to try one fresh with a clean palate. I was not let down. Of all the beers I've had that are hyped up, this is one that truly lives up to it. The taste is unlike anything that I've ever tasted. I wish I had more, I could drink this all day."
"Dark Lord Vintage 2009, White Wax. Wow. I was fortunate to snag a few bottles as a late-show at DLD on April 25 and so glad I did. This beer was so much hyped, I was afraid I would be facing a letdown. But not at all. I could smell this beer all night. What a wonderful smell! Not fortunate to have a snifter in my beer glass collection yet, I poured the first half into a Samuel Smith pint glass and the remainder in a Sam Adams sensory glass. The pour went much better in the Samuel Smith pint glass as a nice two inch frothy head appeared there, while a smaller head formed on the beer poured into the SA sensory glass.. This is my introduction to Russian Imperial Stouts and what an introduction. First taste and I get a little alcohol burn from the 13.0 % ABV, but not as harsh as the 10.0 % ABV for a Bell's Hopslam. Go figure. Still, this beer might need six months to a year for aging -- but, really, who can wait that long. This is really a masterful brew from Three Floyds. Smell, for me, is the best part about this. I go back and forth, between glasses, to smell and find the best smells coming from the pint glass. Taste is something I cannot put into words. This is something you must experience for yourself. Believe the hype. I don't see the low ratings for this Three Floyds offering because it lives up to the hype for me, at least. Drinkability is the only non-5 because I;ll be fortunate to finish this myself."
"Review #666, 08 vintage, courtesy of ucusty."
"It is a very impressive brew, certainly worth the hype, and IMHO, as mentioned in previous reviews, the best beer ever. I wish I could age myself a barrel :)"
"Immediate entry into my top 2 or 3 beers. Just fabulous."
"Cracked one open on 2-27-2010(a little shy of 1 year)and man this beer was even worse then when I had it over 10months ago. It was so cloyingly sweet and just a mess of a beer. Age definitely did not do this beer any good. Just goes to show what hype gets you into."
"I had the 2008 Dark Lord while waiting in line for the 2009 Dark Lord. My goodness, what a beer. It looks like motor oil with a thin, quickly dissipating head. It smells like burned fruit, molasses, maple, and intensely malty. The flavor profile is incredible. Fruit, chocolate, raspberry, woodsmoke, and more that I can't quite identify. I am extremely excited to see how my '09 turns out after a some aging. Can't wait to go to the next DLD!"
"Poured the 2009 vintage of Dark Lord into a Snifter glass. It poured out nice and thick, but thinner then the 2008. You get some deep brown and dark amber highlights in the glass. Seeing this in the glass just makes the mouth water. The liquid coats the glass but not as much as a Bourbon County Stout. A bourbon booze aroma comes out huge in the first sniff. The coffee notes are hidden by the chocolate and some dried fruits like plum and raspberry come out as it warms up. Very sweet and boozy all around. The alcohol hits you up front right away for a moment but then this dried fruit tartness washes it away. The sweet chocolate, molasses and vanilla quickly then take over the mouth. As it finishes there is a nice coffee bitter. But again in the taste the coffee isn't as pronounced as I was looking for, but don't get me wrong this is a complex and balanced beer. If I could I would drink this all night long, but the 2008 is fabulous so I'm looking forward to seeing how the 2009 vintage ages."
"This one, IMO, is truly worthy of the hype that it receives. As far as my palate goes, Dark Lord is damn near ""Perfect""."
"Awesome, for the second year in the row I get a couple bottles of the coveted Dark Lord! Poured this into my beer tasting wine glass. The appearance is jet black and doesn't seem to let through any light at all. I poured it as fast as I could and hardly got a head. The smell is a lot of raisin, lactose, burnt malt, seems sweet for an RIS. The taste is extremely complex. Alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, raisins, wood, smoke, again a little lactose. The mouthfeel may be the most remarkable feature of this beer. The viscosity is similar to whole milk. I found this very drinkable for a extreme beer, but I drink gin martinis so I don't think I can speak for the average. A strong effort, however I remember liking the 2008 a bit better."
"Edit- Had the 2009 vintage and it pales in comparison to the 08. It was difficult to take down even with a 6oz pour. Too much dark fruit, needs alot of time."
"D: Too thick to have throw back more than one. It hides the 13% ABV really well though. I'll be needing friends to help with any bottles I open"
"EDIT: Not changing the original scores but a few notes. Opened up my first 2010 Dark Lord on 11.20.2010. The initial smell was a bit smokey to me and not nearly as sweet as the 2009. Strangely enough, we also opened a Batch 9000, which resembled the 2009 DL more so than this beer did. The 2010 DL also had some faint chocolate, but not really any of the sweet sherry-type notes of the 2009."
"Poured dark brown and extremely thick. Coated the glass like paint or motor oil. Smelled boozy but not unpleasantly. Coffee and Malt smells as well. Although it is too thick to drink easily, the taste is absolute heaven. One of the best I've ever had. I wish three floyd's is amazing and this doesn't dissapoint."
"Pours a deep black profuse sludge as if the Dark Lord himself has awakened from a slumber of centuries past. Already I can smell the scent of deep roasted malts, coffee, smoked embers, and nutmeg. The lacing clinging to the walls of my glass, but sliding ever so smoothly into the depths of midnight, where light ceases and something a bit abnormal begins. The first sip; smooth, chewy and thick. Perhaps this Lord of Darkness plays well with others? A robust hit of roasted chocolate careens my palate confused as to what it wishes to unleash next. A rush of sweet molasses and plum forces its boldness upon my senses. As the ferocity of the sip hits my palate a hint of nutmeg and cherries sneaks in through the back with hops infused in the grain. A strong but short burst of burnt and smoked woodiness ends atop the alcohol, clearly there can be no more. But the taste lingers and finally rests into a roasted smoked chocolate embrace. It's enough to want to follow the Dark Lord into the underbelly, into the darkside, into the grave. And after sampling the elixir of this Demigod, I must pledge my loyalty to he who is the master of the blackest of nights, the overseer of the underworld of sludge, and the purveyor of all that is ""not normal"". To the Dark Lord."
"Drinkability: You can drink a full bottle of this [slowly] before bed with some good music or a good movie, or you can split it with three friends on the back porch. But since this beer is meant to be sipped, savored, and pondered over, it is not 'drinkable' in the case-race sense. I do think it is perfectly drinkable in terms of its unique velvety texture and its impressive balance of complex flavors, always leaving you wanting another sip, and sad when it's all gone. Can't wait to try this one in a few months, or in 2014."
"Poured into tulip producing an extremely dark and thick brew under cocoa-colored head that quickly fades to simply dark-chocolate color. Nose is more subtle than expected with sweet malt, currant, raisin and just a hint of alcohol at the end. Taste is more raisin up front, currant, almost port-like though not quite as thick and chewy. Possibly a hint of smoke mixes in as alcohol takes a turn before and during the finish that gives a nice warming feel but certainly not overpowering. Overall this was a highly anticipated tasting and it hasnt' let me down! Despite it's higher ABV, I could sit and sip this for quite a while."
"Sweet heavens this thing is dark! It coats the inside of the glass very heavily. I new that I was in for a treat once my nose hit the glass. Smells strongly of molasses, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, alcohol, some dark fruit, and espresso. Up front tastes: Sweet soy, molasses, espresso. Leaves a lingering coffee, woody, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste. This thing feels amazing on the tongue. Every thick, but smooth. Extremely drinkable for 13%. First taste of this was a punch in the face. Totally wasn't expecting what I got, but it turned out to be amazing. At first the flavors seemed puzzling, but fit very nicely together. This is not a beer for people who aren't into RIS's. All hail the Dark Lord!"
"D: Well this was my first tasting of Dark Lord. I thought it was a very well rounded imperial stout with some nice unique components that put it into a class of its own. It is impressive how balanced the flavors are considering the complexity and high abv. All in all this is an excellent stout and I can see where all they hype comes from, I look forward to trying it with some age."
"Overall, DLD was great and this beer does not disappoint."
"4. 2005"
"Dangerous, delicious, and decadent, and worthy of its cult status. Mad props to kirok1999 for the hookup. Cheers!"
"D-I wouldn't want to drink a full bottle of this just because I want to share it with friends. Would I if I could?? Yes...do I want to?? No...because it is a beer that should be shared."
"2008 vintage courtesy of Session1979. Beer #1 served during the 'Motha of All Stout Tastings' on 4.17.09. Pours pitch black with the consistency of 10WD30 motor oil-a real glass coater. Pour reveals a thin, tan-colored head that quickly dissipates into a skim, with a tight band around the perimeter of the glass. A thick ring of lacing formed and was retained during the tasting. Nose suggests dark malts, molasses, caramel and chocolate. Taste follows nose, but dark fruit and brandy also comes out in the mouth. In terms of mouthfeel, this is the densest beer I've ever had. The first time I have ever experienced such a full-bodied beer. Minimal carbonation, silky, chewy and buttery, all at the same time; it's like drinking syrup. To say Dark Lord is a huge beer is an understatement, and it really defied my expectations. Alcohol was very will hidden, but this is definitely a sharer. Well shared amongst four friends."
"Jett black pour, like motor oil or black syrup. Small brown lace forms for just a minute, then vanishes. Small oil pach lace remains in it's wake. Nose is full of sweet molasses, raisin, licorice, black currant fruits, mixed with charred malts and chocolate undertones. Very sweet aromas. Thick lush full on body. Huge roasted and charred malts lead in but not acrid in any way. Coffee, chocolate and burnt fruits follow thru mid palate. Small amount of bitterness on the end, with a spicy alcohol kick. This warms all the way down. Finish is long and complex, leaving a melange of coffee, roast, hops,dried fruits, and ethanol spice. A world class sipper for sure."
"Drinkability- Well all in all it's amazing how everything really comes together after a year. It's much easier drinking, although I still find myself having problems putting down an entire bomber. It's 10x better than Darkness though as the hops aren't quite so over-the-top. All in all great beer that is a treat every-now-and-again. Can't wait to grab a couple bottles of '09 in a couple weeks."
"Insanely good Beer"
"D: Very tasty and flavorful, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling for such a thick beer, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a tremendous beer that is worth all of the hype it has received."
"Again, i need to be reminded about 'true to style'...and what the difference is in expectations between RIS and Double Stouts. Personally, this one leans more towards my favorite 'Doubles'. The smell is aggressive and rich with a ton of depth and complexity. The sweet rich substantive characteristics of molasses, licorice and dark fruit dominate the nose and it is complimented by the full bodied, lightly carbonated, creamy yet almost oily character of the mouth feel in the way that it lingers appropriately. Full flavored, the taste is as complex and as deep as the nose. Molasses, licorice, roasted malt, ja-mocha and slightly fruity. A classic ""sipper", the 13% ABV is genuinely part of the experience, but somehow buried beneath the intensity of the flavors and textures. Seriously 'way beyond' my expectations."
"A great stout, which comes very close to living up to the enormous hype."
"Lots of drinkability here... but certainly because of it's uniqueness and freak-show like fame."
"Overall: I'm reluctant to give 5's... ever. This beer moved me."
"Drinkability- not a session beer but great to share with other enthusiasts."
"Without a doubt, Darklord lives up to its reputation. Get your hands on a bottle and give it a try."
"Dave, thanks again for the hookup on this one. I really appreciated you trading me this bottle. I'll be bothering you again in another month or so if you will be so kind to consider trading another one from this year's upcoming release."
"gold 2006 sampled next to 2005 in 2009 at bill and wendy's. pours evil with cold maple syrup consistency (even thicker than the 05). it smells and tastes like a rotting grain silo... thick and gross. 5/4/4/2/12/2.7"
"I could drink a bottle ot this myself, though it wouldn't be a good idea. It is without a doubt not overhyped...! If you have not tried Dark Lord 07 you MUST do what you have to to get a sample."
"Thanks again Mike and Grant!"
"Drinkability: Unbelievably drinkable! Finished in no time at all."
"This is an astonishing beer. Well worth the praise it receives."
"I am doing a week-long RIS tasting, Darkness, Dark Lord, Kate the Great, Founders RIS, Sexual chocolate, etc. I found Dark Lord to be much thicker and more complex than Darkness."
"This has become my new favorite Russian Imperial Stout. Dark Lord, like Westy 12, is worth the hype."
"What a fantastic stout, the only shame is the difficulty in getting any more."
"Overall, a beer that lives up to the hype. Extraordinarily good."
"D - Just about as drinkable as you can get for a high abv RIS the taste and smooth mouthfeel made this beer a joy to drink worth hunting down to try"
"in closing, I think DL deserves a couple years under its belt to fully enhance the flavor but it is quite a stellar beer"
"Just superb. The taste of this beer would rate a 5.5 if I could."
"Drinkability dumped over half the bottle..."
"Enormous thanks to Matt for contributing this bottle to our tasting. Wow... Smell is wonderful- fruits, chocolate, and coffee mocha. Lots of mocha sweetness. Hops are detectible. The taste is instantly toffee. It's a nice intro because if you haven't heard about how huge this beer is the smell warned you that you're in for it. A splash of ripe fruit, dark raisins, and prunes then, like cat Vs train, it hits you. Thick, very thick molasses, huge roasted toffee, and a little hops with some coffee notes to help you through. It's an amazingly deep taste of dark fruit, however, you can also concentrate on the lighter toffee, coffee and hoppy notes to experience it in a completely different way. It's very rich and fades with a coffee tinge. The alcohol is dangerously undetectable. There is also a craft/homebrew feel to it. I'm not sure if that is coming through in the taste, the smell, or if my mind is simply projecting it. Extremely complex and quite remarkable. Per Matt it's ""scrumdiddlyumptious"" and I can hear the whistle fading in the distance..."
"Drinkability - I had only a chalice full, but I would have loved to drink more. Even at 13% abv I was craving for more. The alcohol is buried under the bombastic taste, you can barely even tell there's any ethanol there. I'd have drank the whole bottle if possible and kept going till my head hit the table. Why? Cause it's that good folks, truly deliciously amazingly awesome beer. Only reason it doesn't get a 5.0 is because while I would TRY to drink this all night, it would sooner rather than later put me down like a lame racehorse."
"M & D: Smooth, heavy body, very little carbonation. At 13% this is a sipper. As it warms the drinkability goes through the roof. All in all a very good, complex beer. Is it the best beer in the world? I don't think so, but that is a matter of opinon. The complexity alone give this one cred. Excellent! Skal."
" Believe the hype on this one it really is an extraordinary beer. if you cant find the dark lord i would however recommend chokolat stout from southern tier as i believe it to be almost as good."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Is it worth the hype? I really don't know. Is it a great beer? Definately. Glad I got to share this with some other BAs. Thanks again to beertracker for the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly full, and so very smooth. Alost malted milk smooth. The drinkability is reall good as well, especially with the alcohol being so well hidden. Is this really 13% alcohol?"
"I'm not a big fan of Impy Stouts, but this beer lived up to its hype."
"Drinkability. I would have a hard time finishing this bottle by myself. It's too thick to be very drinkable."
"The 06 is a much more refined and well-rounded beer than the 08 was fresh. That said, I actually might enjoy the huge, over-the-top, in-your-face slap in the face of the fresh version. A slightly different beer with age on it, but still world class."
"2008 Bottle: Pours an opache pitch black with a small brown head. Aroma is fruity sweet and very rich. Plums, raisins, malty, anise and drak chocolate. Flavor very sweet with dark fruit, rich chocolate, coffee and a nice undertone of flower, herbs and grapefruit. Finish is very long with chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Large bodied, very silky and smooth texture with only a slight alcohol burn. Now I know what all the fus is about!"
"Overall, I thought this was the best stout of the night. It was extremely drinkable and I am looking forward to Dark Lord Days. It is actually dangerous to me because of the alcohol content and how good it tastes."
"D- this is the hardest part to rate for this beer. On one hand, I was able to finish my bottle faster than most beers I drink. I loved drinking it. It's probably the most intense beer ive ever had. On the other hand, I was pretty buzzed after it and another bottle would have pushed me way over the edge. A fantastic birthday present to myself, and something I wish I could drink on a regular basis. Fantastic."
"I had to go back and this comment to my review after we poured the second half of this bottle. The bottom half of the the bottle was thick and chunky when poured. The second half was actually better tasting with a much thicker mouthfeel than the first. I guess I didn't realize that this beer wasn't homogenized."
"D= Though I cannot say that in this first experience this lived up to the hype for me, it is an outstanding beer nonetheless. A great beer and one I will gladly drink again and again, learning more about it each time I am sure!"
"D: Very interesting and engaging beer. The 13% is a bit daunting."
"taste is quite powerful. all coffee in this one. cappuccino flavors give way to espresso bitterness. some notes of caramel. mouthfeel on this beer is damn near perfection in glass. 13% is extremely well hidden with only a hint of the heavy booziness at the end. really impressive beer. this beer is world class and worth seeking out. i can't imagine what this beer would be like with a couple of years on it."
"My first and only 5.0 rated beer."
"Worth the hype? Mixed feelings. It does have a rich maltiness that is subtley balanced (while remaining sweet), but very sticky and almost too rich."
"D- It has been a long time since I have been this blown away by a beer. The alcohol will catch up with you, but it isn't harsh or all that noticeable. This is drinking really good right now. Believe the hype."
"One of the few beer that, after all the hype, I wasn't disappointed in."
"Overall: The hype for this beer is a bit ridiculous despite the fact that it is quite possibly the best example of the style. At least from what I have sampled."
"B.T.W. am I reading this correct? Someone found this at a retailer? Jungle Jim's ? Let alone almost 9 whole months after Dark Lord day? I find that hard to believe. You sure that it was ""Three Floyds"" Dark Lord?"
"Poured black hue with small dark brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Aroma was a complex heavy combo of molasses, chocolate and coffee. Full creamy body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Flavor was as complex of heavy sweet and a long solid finish. Clearly has earned this high rating and is one of my top six active bottled beers for style."
"I will continue to seek this out and age if a year of rest makes it this good. Dark lord day 09!!"
"D: Can't drink a ton of this. Heavy, thick, sweet, and high ABV = not the most drinkable of beers."
"In a simple statement....this beer is almost perfection in a bottle."
"A 4.5, S-4, M-3.5, T-4, D-4"
"Drinkability - This was a great RIS, but I don't think I could call it the best. Is it hyped - yes. Is it a good beer - yes. Worth sampling and seeking out just once, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way for this one again. I did like this year's vintage over last year's by a long shot. It is a rich slow sipper. Share it with some friends."
"D- All day every day, if I could."
"8/4/8/4/18 (4.2/5)"
"2008 vintage. This beer pours jet black with a brown head and tons of lacing. The smell was a tad muted next to Black OPS and Abyss but you got nice hints of toasted malts. The flavor for this beer was amazing so many flavors I would not know where to begin and for a 13% beer I got no hints of alcohol flavor... for such a fresh large stout that amazes me. Big roasted malt flavors, notes of choclate, vanilla and coffee, but the most amazing part about this beer is how smooth it is and how well balanced everything is, I could seriously polish off a couple bottles of this with NO problem. The mouthfeel was top notch and the drinkablility was off the charts for a 13% beer. Incredible brew, looks like I will have to trade for another :D"
"Could have one everytime I grab for a stout, but the thickness is semi deterimental to the speed this beer can be consumed at."
"Too much alcohol presence in this one, a bit strong, would see it hard to finish a whole a bottle."
"D- Very drinkable for being 13%. Great beer."
"d: I got this bottle from scubarex quite a while ago. Thanks again! This was one of the best I've tried so far. I'm really glad I was able to trade for one of these."
"Drinkability: A difficult and challenging beer if there ever was one, and I can see how many might intensely dislike it. I don't want to like it - I don't know why I don't, either - but I do. It's an incredibly intense beer, off the charts in many respects. I also feel the need to point out that the Russian on the bottle proper is gibberish, a bunch of random Cyrillic letters randomly placed together, and not real Russian - something can probably be done about that. But I digress. Is it the best beer I've ever had? Probably not. Is it nonetheless an amazing beer, complex, intricate, flavorful, varied, intense? Absolutely. Is it recommended? 100%."
"ABV is well hidden, upper echelon RIS to be sure, a few I've had just as good are just as good, but only a few. The dryness does slow me down a little, but otherwise, going down great on a cold, snowy Colorado evening!"
"Pours jet black with a dark brown, caramel like colored head. In the aroma, molasses, roasty coffee, cherry notes, almost wine-ish. In the taste, Roasty, chocolate, cherry hints, small hops and some alcohol heat in the end. A small bitterness and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, roasty chocolate aftertaste. Very easy to drink, very big flavors and very good."
"D-4- This is tasty, and worth the trade. However, I would rather have a Kate the Great then this one. Who knows maybe the 2008 version is better."
"Overall: yeah"
"d- this one is a sipper for sure. the 9 or 10 ounces that i consumed from this bottle was plenty for one sitting...especially since it was consumed as a post-thanksgiving dinner treat."
"Drinkability: Very yummy, but could not have more than 1 due to the thickness and high alcohol. Tried this first at the Great Taste of the Midwest, but because of the heat and all of the other beers that day, couldn't put this down easily. That being said, I hope to be at Dark Lord Day next year."
"Possibly the thickest beer I have ever had. So much going on, but nothing out of place. The epitome of artisinal brewing."
"Thanks to my brother Lofgrep for sharing his bottle with me."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all day, except that its 13%, and its hard to find"
"D: Honestly, assuming this wasn't a bad bottle, I'm not sure what the hype is here. It just has a horribly salty. I wont be able to finish this bottle. I'll review again to make sure this wasn't a bad bottle."
"D - Very balanced for such a large beer."
"One word for this: Bountiful. Maybe not a stellar example of Beautiful Chemistry but the abundance of well...everything has good closing speed and makes this a showstopper. Perhaps a little cacophony precludes extreme drinkability but this is one to experience. Holy crap!"
"Notes from and tasted on 6/24/05."
"im not sure how many of these i could put back in a night but it is a very drinkable beer."
"D: Highly balanced 13% stout! I could enjoy this ever month or so. Not a beer I could drink more than once in a setting. Worth the hype and my wife agrees."
"This beer is great and lived up to the hype for me."
"Zum wohl."
"Drinkability is good in that I appreciated the experience of trying it, but it's not something I wanted more of or would drink or any kind of regular basis. The flavors are way to robust, not my favorite characteristics of the style, and it's challengingly thick. The artificially imposed rarity by Three Floyds doesn't help it either, and it's ultimately not a hype machine I'm buying into. Still, a huge thanks goes out to johnmichaelson for sharing this gem, the most recent '08 vintage."
"This is impressively drinkable, I am beyond impressed with this beer. I was sort of expecting incredible things and this beer totally delivered. It's odd that I was simultaneously holding this bad boy on a pedestal and yet expecting to be dissapointed and yet, I'm friggin impressed!"
"Yes, it's that good. Believe the hype."
"D: Huge, and amazing. Worthy of the hype, I'd say. This was a wonderful sharing beer with that ABV, and while the note of heat was there, it was covered VERY nicely. Laid down for 4 - 5 years would likely make it orgasmic."
"D- Incredibly easy to drink, a sipper for sure. I had this one both fresh and with about six months on it. It was great both ways but probably just a little easier to drink with some age on it. I can't wait to see how this baby is with a little more time on it. A great beer."
"08 black wax. I hope that what im drinking wasn't ruined in transit to me it being summer and all. It pours black with a brown burnt sugar carmel colored head. aroma is alcohol, malt, with a heavy carmel scent. it tastes of bitter chocolate toasty malt and burnt caramel. this beer is punishing me at the moment. for the first time ever I think I can say that my stomach is in pain, but my mouth is in love. at first I thought that i coudn't handle this beer but its growing on me. I still in my honest opinion enjoy stone's imperial stout a little more because its something i can drink easily. Please take into note that it is august and this beer was shipped via ups"
"D- Couldn't get past the 10w30 viscosity. Not very drinkable."
"Might need another to to confirm my findings of utopia!!! 2006 is the year, and it is true, keep 10% ABV beer for a year or more and it gets better with age!. This is a top of the line RIS, almost a revelation to be drinking from the Goblet of Dark Lord! Pours thick and rich...nose of fruitiness...cherries, chocolate...a sweetness in there. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, I'm just so glad I had the opportunity to enjoy the hard to get Dark Lord....definitely looking to find more...."
"Drinkability - This was a great beer i hope to go to dl days 09 to get more."
"Bow to the Dark Lord! Shared this with my garage drinking buddy as he heads off to Rotterdam for a one night gig. The pour produced head like a married woman. The color was black with a rusty tint. Molasses, and chocolate permeated my senses, as I sipped this truly wonderful concoction. I sensed a mocha, sweet flavor, but balanced nicely with the hops. It was tremendously smooth, making it dangerously easy to drink. I love this beer, and can't wait to drink more of it."
" This is one of the few beers that really lives up to its hype. I was ready to be disappointed but I have to say, its easily one of the top three Russian Imperial Stouts I have had the pleasure of trying."
"D: This is an intense brew. No question. It's delicious and rich and complex, and absolutely fantastic. Definitely not sessionable. But, if it were more readily available, it would likely make its way into my stout rotation."
"As I get further into this beer I'm realizing that it is a bit overrated. This beer has some qualities that are very similar to Sam Adams Triple Bock, and we all know how well that went over with the masses. Just think it's interesting, and funny."
"D: Pretty high ABV, but practically unnoticeable. If I had more of this, I'd be drinking it."
"Drinkability: I don't think I could have one everyday , not that I wouldn't want to but after one glass I was a little buzzed."
"The smell has atrophied to only chocolate and roasty aromas that come with a boozy alcohol warmth. The palate is similar, with the addition of some coffee and a good bit of sugary malt syrup. The mouthfeel is goopy and it feels like my tongue is slogging through much as I taste this beer. Definitely the pinnacle of a sipper."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. The mouthfeel is the thickest I have ever had and the drinkability - well, lets say you must split this bottle with someone. It was hard for me to even finish half and I loved this beer!"
"Snagged a bottle of this in Chicago, shared it with my best man. Pours opaque black with brown edges, the dense head quickly disappating. Smell is dried fruit and sulfur: taste is molasses and loquat and all kinds of heaven, with cocoa and coffee notes. It's thick as can be, but opens up nicely sip by sip. Not one I could drink alone, but quite pleasant to down. Glad I could finally try it."
"D: wow! one bottle of this and I am out. So good, but I think it is definitely overhyped. major thanks to Grant and Todd for both bring a bottle out of the blue on the same day. what an experience."
"Overall-Incredible! Perhaps worth a trip to Dark Lord day next year? Hmmm. Maybe."
"(Again, can't thank my buddy Patrick enough for, this and, all the other great beers he sent me!)"
"I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try/buy this infamous beer - in my opinion it's worth all the hype it gets - highly recommended."
"I don't care for this at all, and RIS's are my favorite style, too. If I had paid for this bottle myself, I would have been quite upset at this beer's reputation versus the reality of its flavor."
"HV"
"D- For a beer that leaves a film instead of lacing on the glass, this is about as drinkable as its gonna get"
"The only thing that would be better is if I could have attended DL Day & picked this baby up myself. Next year!"
" Maybe not as well balanced as some, but damn the complexity and depth is overpowering. This one is pushing limits."
"Whether you think Dark Lord deserves the accolades it gets or not you must admit this is a hugely complex beer. It is big and bold and hard to touch in that department. Dark Lord is a huge beer that needs to be respected. I have to give a big ""Thank you"" to Derek for sending me a bottle of this since I couldn't make the release this year. Thanks Derek!"
"D - despite this being such a big beer, it is rahter easy to drink. Additionally, I did not find myself tiring of the flavors. Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had especially in terms of the flavor profile. Each sip makes me want have to have even more since each taste is unique and complex. A super good beer that seemed to live up to the hype to me. One of the few RIS's that I have had that I just could not put down at all."
"Again, with that supposed booziness not being present as I had heard it would be, the drinkability on this one is very high considering the ABV. But it's a RIS, so the ABV should be high, can't fault it for that. I could sip on this beer all night long and wouldn't stop until suddenly that 13% caught up with me by surprise. Delicious, delicious beer."
"All in all, I'm a tad dissapointed. I tried a sample of the Vanilla Bean DL and it was awesome. This beer just seemed like a clusterfu*k of flavors, and it didn't work for me at all."
"D - If only... LOL. It's a sipper and kills the palate."
"I may not type much, but I do talk alot, and this beer shut me up. I don't believe any beer will change your life, but this could make people believe that beer is a gift from God."
"Wow! I love this beer. An endless sipper. Truly awe-inspiring."
"13% ABV is huge but its well hidden and this is just an amazing beer. I just don't think I could ever finish one of these by myself but I don't think thats a bad thing because its a fun beer to share."
"Everytime I've described a beer as looking like motor oil has been a lie. THIS is a beer that looks like motor oil. No head whatsoever. This beast is far too dense for a head. It has its own gravity and pulls any head into itself. The glass is absolutely stained yellow after drinking. Epic. Smell is hugely complex and awe-inspiring. Smells like the best coffee, the best brownie, brown sugar, and some dark fruits thrown in for good measure. I'm amazed that the taste actually meets and surpasses everything promised by the smell. Mouthfeel is massively thick. After swallowing, it's like my entire digestive system up to and including my stomach is coated with this stuff. Normally, with such a huge beer, I'm a bit more conservative with dropping a 5, but I would have this anytime I can."
"Well I really enjoyed this beer. It was quite the treat. This beer is HUGE. Would I pay the price if it was readily available? Probably not often. But it is really good."
"Overall: Extremely drinkable for the ABV and fullness. Delicious, very tasty, very full, something I'll drink again and again. But worth all the extraordinary hype? Not sure about that."
"It was great to drink one and be part of the hype, but I don't think, for the price, I would ever buy another."
"D : Incredible brew. This is such a wonderful beer that I want even more."
"Pours black and absolutely opaque with a thick dark head that fades a good bit. Huge aromas of licorice, molasses, and treacle, as well as a nice sustained rooty bitterness. The taste is massive, with an onslaught of sweet, fruity, grainy, chocolate, licorice and coffee. The deep herbal bitterness and alcohol helps balance the massive sweetness. Even the sweeet elements have a slightly charred edge to them helping cut any cloying nature. Long, long finish and a thick, viscous, creamy mouthfeel. I truly enjoyed this experience. This is by no means an everyday beer. It is so alcoholic, big, thick, and chewy that the experience should be savored on ocassion. I'm sold."
"D: A world class beer, I can see what it has the hype that it does, tastes and feels wonderful and makes the whole waiting in line for four hours worth it. Does it deserve all the hype and hoopla, probably not and there are probably equal or better beers out there, but it tastes great, and it a real pleasure to drink."
"I ended up liking this more than I thought I would, I can definitely see why it's so highly rated."
"Roasted malt and coffee flavors up front. Intense dark fruit and malt sweetness immediately follow. Wow. Bittersweet chocolate, roasted barley, and yet more sugary dark fruit sweetness. Hints of vinous grapes, vanilla, smoke, leather, and anise. A very big, complex beast of an IS. Very full bodied with a giant, creamy mouthfeel (the only other RIS I've had that is this thick and chewy is Darkness). Smooth and dangerously drinkable. Not boozy, but certainly strong! Worth waiting in line for I do say."
"D - Awesome brew! One of the best accomplishment in attempting to balance extremity. Can wait to get more of this beer!!"
"Just felt like writing up a little update today. I've already tried a few different bottles of Dark Lord from 05-09 and some of those were quite good. I do like how the 05 and 06 vintage has been aging, they have a stronger coffee and dark chocolate flavor with a better harmony of flavors. The 08 was quite good fresh and should age well for at least 3 years before getting deeper soy sauce notes, a little is ok but too much of it turns into a mess of a beer which was the 07 in my opinion. There were some flavors I liked in the 07 but the initial flavors seemed out of sync. The 09 is also quite a syrupy, sweet, vanilla bomb. My review is mostly about the 07 but I do take into consideration the other vintages."
"Can't wait for this one to mature in my cellar. Man I'm already thinking of how to plan my next trip to DLD. This beer is top notch! Thank you Three Floyds! mmm mmm good!"
"Notes: We consumed an 07 and an 08 afterwards, and this 2006 with 2 years on it really stood out from the crowd. I will no doubt hold onto my DL for a couple years assuming this is the result. Fantastic."
"A rich and complex brew. Alcohol is certainly present, but appears mild when compared to the high ABV. Flavor profile changes as you drink this one. Initially the sweetness stands out. However, as you continue to drink the strong roasted character, dark fruit, and alcohol seem to get more intense. Certainly a brew that any stout lover needs to try."
"Goes down pretty well for being such a huge beer. Does a pretty good job living up to the hype."
"Drinkability is good. It's a bit to rich and high in ABV to drink alot of, but I'd definately like to get a few more of these to cellar and drink over time. Worth the hype? A bit overhyped but a damn good beer."
"An outstanding beer that improved with each sip. As mentioned above it is a sipper and would be a nice dessert beer. Not my favorite style but certainly enjoyed and would love to have again. Recommended but not sure it's worth standing around for nine hours."
"D: Very slow sipper, obviously. The carbonation was the biggest disappointment, though I'm not sure if a fresher sample will bring it up to KtG standards. Great, nonetheless and I'll be having a very fresh bottle within the month."
"D: An awesome beer. Would be even better sipping it out of a snifter rather then the plastic cup it was served in at Dark Lord Day."
"D: It is a powerfully wonderful beer but one that is so full bodied, rich and with a massive ABV that one bottle may tap me out (two at most) for a session. I could have mini sessions with this brew frequently."
"Bottom line is that this is a first rate beer, and well worth getting ahold of if you can, but don't kill yourself trying to get it. There are some others out there that are on a par with it: Bourbon County, Abyss, Yeti, Founders Kentucky Breakfast."
"I found this beer to have a chocolate espresso taste, good color and smell and a nice head. I split this bottle with others who had similiar thoughts. I dont think I would or could drink a whole bottle of this ber, just a bit too heavy for me and will sit in stomach preventing me from drinking more beers. Overall it was a very nice treat to have drank this Russian imperial stout."
"D - Drinkability is very good. The high abv puts this one in the category of a sipping beer. Overall the Dark Lord is complex and smooth. Even though the aroma was lacking, all other aspects of this beer are stellar. I would highly recommend this beer."
"Overall I have to be honest here. I have in the past commented on how things get too hyped up and there are just as good if not better stouts out there to try. I will now eat my words. This was seriously insane in how good it was. I don't really know where it could have been possibly improved on. I would gladly stand in line for 1 hours in the cold for this one. It really is that good. I am very glad I finally got to try and review this one, it made my whole night. Simply put this is the stout to beat. It really does live up to the hype."
"Pours a beautiful deep black color with a constancy of 10W40. The small tan head quickly dissipates. Below average lacing and below average carbonation with a smell of sweet roasted dark malts, coffee and vanilla. Tastes of strong coffee, sweet roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, and toffee. Very complex. Very tasty - This WORLD CLASS. Drink and Enjoy!"
"Let me add to my original review that I LOVE almost every FFF beer that I've tried and think their brewpub is one of the greatest in the midwest. Unfortunately, this beer is not my cup of tea."
"Full mouthfeel, inky and sly. Hmm, more than a taste is enough, maybe 12 oz but that would be it. Great to taste it!"
"Mouthfeel is very thick and heavy with a lot of warming presence."
"Drinkability - worth the money and the hoopla...and the wait. Looking forward to this year's edition..."
"This beer is absolutely ridiculous, incredibly rich and deep. Balanced but devilishly strong. To me this beer was worth the wait, but even so, perhaps is still a bit overrated."
"If you have the chance to try different years side-by-side, definitely do, because it is awesome..."
"D- pretty damn good and delicious."
"this beer is over all very good, balanced for its size and very flavorful."
"An exceptional stout. Complex, great flavor, and an incredible mouthfeel, which is not a beer characteristic I had ever noticed as much as I did with this beer other than carbonation level. This beer may be hyped, but it doesn't disappoint."
"2007 bottle at DLD: Black as night it had a slight brown head that left some nice brown lacing. The nose was huge and filled with expresso, chocolate and porty overtones. While not as potent as the barrel-aged version, in the mouth it was the dense, thick, syrupy and oily. While the alcohol lever is high, it is never hot. The flavors from the nose fill the palate and cover every nook and cranny. This is an intese huge beer that should be drank in small quantities. However credit needs to be given as it is balanced which is not an easy feat for something this size."
"D - Definitely a sipper, but I can see what all the fuss is about. Big, bold flavors and an exceptional mouthfeel make this one of the best RIS offerings out there."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D - for a 13% RIS, i can only again bring up the milkshake analogy. it gives the drinker the amount of pleasure that a perfectly blended shake would give an 11-year-old boy after a Little League game. while it isn't my favorite american stout, it is quite probably the best beer i have ever tasted."
"I'm not blown away, but it's a great beer. A little too sweet for me, but still awesome."
"---"
"For a 13% RIS, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. I didn't have any problem splitting a bomber with my generous friend who acquired this via trade. There's a lot of smooth chocolate flavors going on and I highly recommend pairing this with the richest chocolate cake, brownies, or fudge you can find."
"D-With all of it's BIGNESS it is extremely smooth, and that is the genius of this beer. The ending alcohol burn lets you know what you are dealing with! This one fresh is a bit much...but with almost a year under it's belt well, this Dark Lord is all grown up!"
"Very low carbonation and a rich mouth coating body. Would actually prefer a touch more carbonation in this. Overall, rich, and smooth and definitely a very creamy, robust flavor, but in the end it was cloyingly sweet, I found. Definitely not one of my favorite Imperial Stouts, but not one I'd ever turn down trying either."
"Bottom line: Super complex in flavour yet so smooth and easy drinking...hell of a testament to Three Floyds' brewing expertise. Highly recommended!"
"Kick-ass for the style, easy for me to drink...how bout you?"
"D: The ABV and overwhelmingly strong flavors make it difficult to drink more than the serving I had."
"All around excellent. If anything it's just a hair too sweet, but that's being nit-picky."
"A good brew, very mildly reminiscent of Sam Adam's Triplebock in some respects. I would have it again, but it is certainly immensely overrated."
"D- So obviously I couldn't get too many bottle of this but it is very tasty. I tried Darkness recently and was let down so I am happy this is a great beer."
"I've had many other imperial stouts, and this ranks at the bottom. In fact, the next beer I am going to review has a higher alcohol content （It is the Bristol XXX Winter Warlock) and it totally retains a stout like character. I would never have known that the DL was an imperial stout. My suggestion... don't skip this one... you have to try just to say you've done it, but be ready. As far as flavors go in the DL, pretty much all the other reviews hit it head on... they just forgot to mention the addition of 11 ounces of port wine. :)"
"Pours opaque brown/black with very little brown head, and smells almost like an english barleywine. the taste is very carameley sweet, but still bitter at the same time. it has a super thick mouth-feel one that i would expect from a barleywine, not bad, but not quite what i was expecting. drinks real slow. overall a good brew, just not quite what the hype makes it out to be."
"Note: 2008 vintage was more desireable for me fresh, and having tried some vintages as early as 05, this beer ages extremely well. A fine imperial stout, under the right circumstances."
"A beefy two finger milk chocolate brown head has incredibly active bubbles that fade to just a skim in a couple of minutes. Body is an evil soulless pure blackness. Nose resembles port very much in a good way with alchol soaked dark fruit, well made licorice with some electric sweet tones. Smooth silky blackness enters the mouth with first sip. The port characteristics keep true with the flavor with some dark chocolate notes mixed in. Raisens, plums, and rum cake is are darkly delecious. This is luxurious and quite the sipper. Unique in its deepth and complexity among stouts. Mouthfeel is very dark and desirabley rich. Although I couldnt drink this everyday, I would love to. Amazing, bold and rich."
"Drinkability - The massive mouthfeel, while probably the beer's greatest attribute, also makes it difficult to drink both frequently and in large quantities - I'd have a hard time finishing a bottle by myself."
"Vintage 2007. Poured into a 6oz brandy snifter. Poured jet black with wisps of mahogany along the edges when the liquid was held up to the light. The beer had almost no head whatsoever even with a aggressive pour, but left oily lacing down the entirety of the glass. Beautiful beer. Aroma was big with coffee and bakers chocolate up front. Hints of vanilla, toffee, and plums were also there. The finish of the nose was almost cherry/almond. Taste was up front with the coffee and anise but mellowed into dark fruits and chocolate with a slight alcoholy burn that paired extremely well. Mouthfeel was full and oily. Exceptionally drinkable."
"A good brew, but not worth the trade and effort to obtain."
"Drinkability is quite good. Dark Lord lived up to the hype for me. Not the best beer I have had, nor the best Russian Imperial Stout I've had either. But with that said, this is still a top notch beer, that is very deserving of the high scores it receives."
"The only reason this isn't a total 5.0 exceptional in my ratings is because...well, I just don't think I could drink more than the half-a-bottle that I had. It's one of those exceptional things that you can only have a tiny piece of, and only need a tiny piece of, to know that it's special."
"A friend brought this over for me to try, and now I have vowed to attended Dark Lord day every year to replenish my stock until I die."
"DL lived up to the hype IMO. This beer was rich with complex flavors and well balanced. It seemed to seamlessly cascade from one flavor to the next."
"Recently had some 2010, and didn't like it. I will not change my original review, but this beer is grossly overrated, IMO. Not an enjoyable RIS. I'd give it lower marks if I re-reviewed it."
"thanks again Brad for this badass beer."
"Well, I turned up the bottle and a thick oil oozed out. There was a slight brown head that decided not to stick around. The aroma is a complex blend of caramel, raisin, coffee, alcohol and chocolate - it is seductive. The taste is a mixture of raw molasses, raisins, brown sugar, and just plain old love. This beer sticky with an alcohol bite. It begs the question - is there another."
"A mighty large thanks to MuenchenerKindl for sending me this one (and possibly another soon too!)."
"I rated the drinkability as 'exceptional' given how smooth this 13% RIS is. Very pleasing."
"Wow, if ever a beer's name matched its personality, it's the Dark Lord. From its appearance, to its taste, to its body, this is just one dark, angry, powerful mother of a beer that takes what is capable in an RIS to a whole new level. While definitely a steady sipper, it's still an unforgettable beer drinking experience."
"Pours a thick, motor oil viscous and black color with very little burnt wood tan head, no retention, no lacing, but there is a grease layer, beautiful. Bottom of bottle has a chocolate syrup type sediment, which oddly enough, made an evil face in my glass, must be the Dark Lord himself. Smells of burnt embers, milk chocolate, baking cocoa, coffee, and dark fruits. Lots of flavors going on here. Taste starts off like a creamy chocolate milkshake with some black cherries and a touch of semi-sweet chocolate on top, but just as you're sitting down to a nice dessert milkshake, you're reminded that you're drinking pure evil, and with an assault of coffee and espresso, you're brought back to reality. Lots of heat as it comes to room temperature. Creamy and smooth, any fuller in body and it would break the glass. Only downside, the alcohol presence as it warms takes away from some of the taste. One of the best beers out there, and while some may say it's overhyped, it deserves its honors. If only it were more readily available, I'd drink this stuff as much as possible."
"A ground-breaking and incredibly unique interpretation of the style. Excellent, and well worth seeking out."
"Any good review of Dark Lord must address the hype that this beer has created. It is a great beer. No question. Is it the best beer in America? I don't think so. I don't think there is such a thing. It is the best RIS I have had, but I have not had Kate or Darkness or Black Albert. Once you get to the top beers in most categories, I think its just up to personal preference/expectations. Would I attend Dark Lord Day to get more of it? I will certainly try."
"Pours an absolute midnight onyx black with not a speck of light shining through. For how wide the snifter is, the one finger dark tan head is very impressive although it does die down a bit quicker than I had hoped. Good, thick stickiness left on the sides after tilting the glass from side to side. First smell I get is mostly dark fruits. Big fig, raisin, and date aromas with a strong roasted barley background. Lots of molasses, caramel malt, and brown sugar sweetness in the nose as well. Unfortunately there is a fairly strong alcohol presence, but with all the other wonderful smells going on with this brew I can't complain. I was expecting more in terms of smokiness with this one, but the sweetness definitely dominates the nose overall. Well then, I guess the charred aspect comes into play with the flavor. Up front is a strong smokey sting combined with an almost raspberry like sweetness. Big dark chocolate malt and roasted barley midway through. There is a slight hop bite hidden, but noticable. Aftertaste is wood-like with a carmelized almond flavor, very pleasant. Huge thick and chewy mouthfeel, just how it should be. For how in your face the alcohol was in the nose, the lack of it on the tongue is quite nice. Damn good RIS, I look forward to seeing how it compares to Kate."
"One can finish a bottle, but it's a very rare treat. Just like eating that 2nd or 3rd piece of chocolate cheesecake...."
"Poured a very thick dense black. Minimal brown head falls quickly. No lacing to speak of. Some sludge made its way out on the final pour. (But nothing to complain about.) Aromas of dark chocolate covered cherries, tootsie rolls, burnt marshmallows, hint of black liquorish, booze and strong roasted malt. Big bold flavors of rich chocolate, coffee, dark cherries, burnt brown sugar, deep roasted malt, and a hint of booze. Very complex in taste. Mouth feel is thick and fudgey. Low carbonation. This dark brew is extremely dense and sticky. Coated my glass with a brownish film. A 22 oz serving was a bit much for me. Drinkability wasnt as good toward the end. The booze was hidden well, but I found it getting way too sweet and syrupy after awhile. This would be a great one to share. Recommend to be enjoyed with fellow enthusiasts! CHEERS!"
"D - I wasn't a big fan of the 2005 and 2006 Dark Lords but the 2007 has made me a believer."
"Since I joined this site, this has always been the number one beer I have wanted to try. Now I finally have a bottle sitting in front of me thanks to akorsak. I was originally planning on opening this tomorrow night for new years, but since I will be working, now is good enough for me. Had some trouble peeling the silver wax from the top of the bottle. Once I finally pried the cap off, I poured it in to my Rapscallion sniffer glass at I would say slightly colder than cellar temperature. Comes out of the bottle very thick, and lush looking. Not much head to be spoken of, but there was a nice ring around the sides of the glass, and some beautiful red hues on the side. In the smell was a whole range of different aromas. The most dominant was rich fudge, then some slightly bitter coffee, some fruity alcohol notes, and a distinct raisin character. Taste had it all...Notes of port, cherries covered in dark chocolate, fudge, molasses, caramel, and a slight metallic twang in the finish. I was surprised to not find much coffee in the flavor, as I understand that they use coffee in this brew. Many reviews have stated that this beer is incredibly viscous and almost like motor oil. I would say it has more of a slick mouthfeel that coats the palate, and leaves a nice bitter, and like I mentioned before, somewhat metallic aftertaste. I liked the fact that this is a big stout, but not necessarily a meal in a bottle like many others. The drinkability on this one is what impressed me most of all. Where the fuck is the alcohol? I mean, I can feel it after having one small glass, but it is nowhere to be found in the flavor or body. That being said, this is dangerous stuff, as it goes down smooth and far too easy. Okay, so I guess my final verdict is that this is indeed the best beer I have had to date. Every iota of hype surrounding this beer is well deserved. Now all I have to do is convince a few of my friends to make the trek with me in the Spring to make it out to Dark Lord Day 08. Cheers and Happy New Year!"
"This is very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. It is definitely a ""sipper"" - and quite a treat."
"This is a no-brainer. Make your plans for DLD '08. Worth the hype and then some."
"For a 13% abv beer, you can't get more drinkable"
"D: (2) Didn't like it at all. Didn't want to finish solely based on the taste, I just didn't like it. This is one of the few Russian Imperial stouts I've had that I didn't like."
"D - This is very outstanding. I understand the hype. The flavors were amazing. But, hands down, it was the best looking dark beer I've ever seen."
"Thanks to chadspivey for his very generous sharing of the experience."
"Got in a trade with czoch75 back in May and have been cellaring till now per FFF's recommendation. Poured from a 22oz bottle with a silver wax seal and cool graphics into a pint glass. I have to agree with other reviews that it pours like motor oil or thick syrup. It was pitch black even against a light. It had just a tiny hint of head and that was gone in a blink of an eye. The aroma was strong on alcohol and dark fruits at first. Got some strong smoke after a couple minutes but then that faded into the back. By the end, alcohol was the most dominant. The taste was also dominated by alcohol. Very reminiscent of cough medicine. There was some sweetness at the start of each drink but then the alcohol overpowered it. I've had several RIS lately and really liked several but this one is too much. For me, they need to scale back the alcohol taste and add back in some more traditional RIS flavors. For me, this one is overhyped and not worth recommending unless you can easily get it. Disappointed is best way to sum it up. (3, NA, ML, N)"
"drinkability is good. very well balanced, hiding its alcohol well. maybe a touch overly sweet, but not quite to the point of being sticky sweet. great stuff. looking forward to seeing how this one changes with time."
"Rare and pricey."
"[Enjoyed while repeatedly listening to Soulreaper's ""Written In Blood"" as a tribute to the most evocative review of Dark Lord ever written -- a review that is, sadly, no longer available for us to read.]"
"Aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, some Belgian candy, plum bread, and tons of alcohol. The flavors blend into a smooth chocolaty velvet across the tongue. Not a lot of bitterness, but tons of middle of the road sweetness. The sharp bitterness comes through in the end, but it is only a tingle. It is a way smooth beer, and has tons of complexity to it."
"D: I'll be honest...this was a bit of a let down. It's a great beer, but not worth the immense hype. The body won't increase with time, but the alcohol presence might be reduced and that would improve the taste."
"Pours like 10W30 with a dark chocolate head. Not lace so much as the beer actually sticks to the sides of the glass. This is a thing of beauty. Smells of big chocolate, very roasty, some maple and minor alcohol. Taste is incredible. Very roasty, sweet chocolate, maple and vanilla and a slight alcohol finish. Velvety in the mouth with ABV almost non existant. A pure delight to sip away. Sex in a bottle."
"Aftertaste is warm alcohol, dark fruits, and a bit of chocolate."
"The beer is completly black. There was a fair tan head that lasted a while. Some lacing. This is what I think a big RIS should look like so I think a 5 was well deserved here. The smell is chocolate along with coffee and oatmeal. The taste reflects these smells and there is no hop profile to be noticed. This is a very malty brew. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. A nice lasting aftertaste. The drinkability is good. The abv is well hidden and the beer becomes more complex as it warms. This was a nice choice for a cool fall evening."
"Not the best beer I've had but it is good and I recommend it."
"This is one serious beer and I wish it was brewed year round, but its exclusivity almost makes it taste even better"
"Perfect for a special occasion. Definitely not a regular but this deserves its praise in my book. For sure a big standout for its unique qualities and one of my favorite beers. If only it was more available and $8.99 or so a bomber, I'd be all over it."
"The Dark Lord is better as it warms up to room temperature. It's a heavy, heavy beer - perhaps the heaviest I've ever had - and is not designed for casual consumption. It's the perfect beer for a time of celebration. Like New Year's Eve. Or when your buddy moves to Seattle. It's definitely something you want to seek out and try at least once in your life. It's well worth traveling long distances to try."
"The drinkability is above average, because it's a very great tasting beer, but it is far and away a session beer lol. It's sometimes hard to swallow because how malty and thick it is. It likes drinking a meal. This beer is not for the impatient, your going to have to dedicate some time with this beer. It's a very slow going experience."
"Drinkability: Well...if you can have enough onhand to drink regularly then you are lucky. This is a once in awhile beer with its alcohol and dense coffee flavors, but it is also a real treat. Get one if you can!"
"All in all, this beer was like no other that I have tried. Believe the hype and do anything you can to get your hands on a bottle of this liquid gold!"
"Drinkability: The apparent alcohol and the intense bitterness without balance make it hard to get through. I think this guy is a little overhyped."
"Thick foaming dark brown head fills up the glass seemingly stays around, but before you know it it leaves forever. The smell is green, smell is high alcohol with roastiness and just a hint of dark fruit in the background. The mouthfeel is smooth, so silky smooth. The roasitness is met with a slight bitter cocoa nose that backs up the roastiness and lets it mellow slightly. The cocoa is chocolaty, but it's a really good bitter chocolate. Something I can find in good, good dark chocolate. It's definitely not as mellowed out yet, but still very very good. The dark fruit, like the ash taste comes out more and more with the bitter flavor ending on the tongue. Yet again, mouthfeel is great, silky smooth and wonderful. Overall, I wish I could have this at least once a week."
"SO, all that being said does this live up to the hype? I would say yes. It's vinous, it's a medly of deep sweet malts, it's got nice notes of cherry, roasted grains, vanilla and sweet. It's different than other RISs I've had and it stands out to me for it's amazing drinkability for such a big beer."
"Thanks to popedx for what might be the best trade I have ever done."
"Poured into a big heavy glass chalice, formed a scant 1/8"" of dark burnt brown head the opaque black brew. Head falls promptly down to a layer of tiny bubbles, with leggy liquid upon swirling, but little to no lacing. Aroma is burnt dark malts and potent alcohol, in about equal doses. Taste is rich chocolate and acrid coffee to starts, fruitiness in the middle that lingers, and then gives way to the alcohol character, which is remarkably built into the brew. The numbing of the tongue tells you that you drank something substantial, but the burn just isn't there. Nice. Mouthfeel is quite smooth for the stle and substance of this brew, and drinkability as to session is limited, but I certainly want to revisit this one sometime. Have to try to find one for the cellar."
"Pours out a very thick black color, but dark shades of red around the edges. Head is a creamy tan color, but did recede and leaves little to no lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel and molasses, cherry, alcohol, chocolate, and a little roastiness. Sweet malt and molasses, with a splash of hops, though they are fading, followed by port wine with a lingering soft roastiness. Vanilla seems to also join in the cornucopia of flavors, as well as others I'm sure I'm not able to name. Carbonation is very much on the low side; body is as thick as they come. I'd like to say it's overhyped, but it's just really everything I look for in an Imperial Stout. I had one bottle shortly after the release and it was pretty good, but age has already helped raise this one to elite status."
"1000"
"Really looked for forward to trying this beer to see if it lived up to the hype. Mixed feelings after having had it. On one hand, not sure anything could ever really live up to the extraordinary levels this beer has commanded. On the other hand, it is a most excellent R.I.S. Anyone interested enough to be reading this knows already, so I won't bother to say it's worth seeking- you already know that..."
"The impressive thing to me is that this drinks almost like a milkshake. So full, thick and creamy. Low carbonation. I thought that this really lives up to what everyone says. Such a thick, rich stout. Hard to imagine many beers being better."
"I dig it. I understand why people like it so much."
"***THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH VARIATION ON THIS BEER FROM YEAR TO YEAR. I AM DINGING THE SCORE SLIGHTLY. PREVIOUSLY A 4.95"
"Overall the Dark Lord doesn't live up to the hype. It was way too malty/thick for my liking. The beer coated the glass in a way I've never seen before, and although I wouldn't call it sludge, the last half of the beer was certainly thick and chewy. The alcohol wasn't too much, and there is some balance of flavor. It just wasn't that special. I'd recommend The Abyss instead..."
"Syrupy tar. One of the thicker brews I've had. Certainly an experience. Not my favorite stout, but an awesome one nonetheless. Should easily be considered one of the best in the world."
" Although it packs a punch, the beer is highly drinkable for an imperial stout. That being said, you'd probably be best off not trying to drink the entire bottle on your own. Find a friend, as the roughly 1200 calories the Lord contains would certainly weigh you down."
"In closing this beer could probably easily receive 5* but I am still holding back for that perfect beer that I have yet to find... I may be on to it though. The oak aged version of this may quite possibly push this one over the top making it deserving of a 5 star rating. I can't wait to get my hands on some and find out. If it is you will be the first to know."
"Pours a black tar color with a decent head and some lacing on the small glass I had the priviledge of tasting. Unreal flavors going on: Vanilla, chocolate, cherries, coffee, orange...full of flavor. Yet, they all blend nicely together. I have trouble putting down beers over 9-10 percent, but I can see drinking a few of these, but extemely potent and highly drinkable. One of my top 20 without a doubt."
"Taste is fantastic, I was amazed (although the hype said that I shouldn't be) at how well the flavor masked the 13% ABV. Coffee, raw cocoa (not chocolate, it's a bit more primitive than that), and some smooth hoppy notes are all in attendance. Mouthfeel's creamy and smooth, almost chewable. Carbonation is near extinct due to the high alcohol content, but it works. The alcohol isn't big in the taste, but you can definately feel it warm the face and seep into the minute cuts on the roof and sides of the mouth. Bottom line: amazing beer, no doubt worth the hype. It's tasty, complex, and the pricetag is justified. Can't wait to see how I like it the second time around."
"This beer could be drank all year round. I had it alongside a fire and it went down smooth and I didnt want the glass to be empty. This beer doesnt need to be super cold, the warmth in this brew brings out the flavor so much more. Three Floyds does it again. I will be returning to Indiana every year for this tasty stout from here on out."
"Well, it appears that the hype has triumphed again. While this is a giant beer and full of complexities, the sweetness just becomes annoying. It really lacks balance, and that really limits the drinkability. Certainly worth a try, but doesn't come close to living up to the hype."
"Huge thanks to Khaismus for sharing his only bottle!"
"D- I love it. Insanely enough, if this beer was readily available, I'd drink it all the time. It's such a treat that you can't... but I think it would sell very well if it was available all the time, still. Five is not a good enough score. makes all the others, so far, look weak."
"This is a ture heavyweight. It deserves much of the accolates it deserves, but at the finish it got a little hot. Next time, I'll share."
"Overall I actually believe that this one lives up to the hype. It's a big beer! The availability definitely adds to the mystique but after drinking this one I was a true beleiver. I may even trade my new house for a couple cases."
"A very interesting, tasting experience, to say the least..."
"Pours like motor oil. Smells of cherry, a little chocolate, coffee notes. Tastes the same, very strong sweet cherry flavors but they melt well with the chocolate backdrops. A slight smoked coffee flavor after the rush of cherry and then some bourbon and oak. The flavor is very robust with a long pleasing aftertaste. It's like I'm eating a rich chocolate cake. A very full boddied beer, and I'd say the most full boddied I have had. While this beer was extremely good tasting it was hard to drink because of the weight. I hate to say this but I would rather have a half pint of the stuff for dessert. Finishing an entire bottle would be a chore. I am glad I wasn't the one waiting in line for this brew. It's good but not worth the wait unless you are completely obsessed with stouts, which I am not. The beer does hold up to its expectations as far as tastes go."
"oct '10: '08, '09, '10 side by side. '08 clearly the best, complex, multifaceted, long finish, no off flavors whatsoever from age, also happened to have the most carbonation and best head of the three. '09 clearly the worst-a sweet mess, not alot going on, undercarbonated, some worcestershire/soy. '10 pretty good, seemed a bit raw and young but should improve."
"Quite the strong ale indeed. I can't say that this is overrated but I would compare this MUCH more to DFH WWS rather than Stone IRS. The only real weakness with this RIS is in the drinkability department. An intense brew this would be better from 6 ounce bottles and sampled sparingly; the same as DFH WWS should be."
"NOTE: People have been pissing and moaning a lot about the large amount of sludge in the bottle. I'd say that there's about 2oz. of sediment in a 22oz. bottle (at least there was in this one); not a ton, but it's worth decanting."
"I've now had a few different batches of Dark Lord over the years. The 2007 (silver) batch tasted in late 2008 (about 16 months of bottle conditioning) was the single best beer I've ever had. I also had the 2007 more recently (2013) and it was pretty muddled and not nearly as good. Some of the newer batches, like 2012, don't seem quite as good to me. That being said, every time I've ever had Dark Lord it was exceptional - if a one-year old 2007 is the pinnacle of beer, a 2012 is still in the top 5% of beers."
"Highest recommendation, especially if you can make it to Dark Lord Day."
"Overall and interesting RIS , maybe not my favorite, but worth seeking out."
"2007 bottle obtained at Dark Lord day by Janice (not a BA), sold to shivtim and shared by him with me and and a couple of other people. Pours black with a head that vanishes quickly, and a little disappointingly. laces like black olive oil and lacing actually has little granules of something (yeast? ground up coffee?) in it. Smells like brandy, soy sauce, cherries, some yeast, hot chocolate. Quite complex and more fruity than anything else. Taste is just what i look for in a RIS. A complex mish-mash of flavors. Molten chocolate covered cherries, other dark berries, truffles, brandy, bourbon, vanilla. Finish has an alcohol warming and a slight coffee roastiness that's quite well blended. Excellent. Mouthfeel is thick, as advertised. I could drink this all the time but i can't for many many reasons. Yeah, its a freaking great beer, no joke."
"Pours like dirty motor oil with a one finger tan/orange head. Swirling the glass gives elegant sheeting that is very pleasing. Aroma is sweet malts and alcohol. Tons of alcohol. Taste is primarily cocoa and black cherry. Lots of malts and lots of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick. Not the most drinkable thing in the world. I would be very satisfied with a 6oz serving. Luckily I had a friend to split the bottle. None of the rumored sludge in the bottle unless it just had not settled. Will re-rate this winter."
"This is somewhere between a stunning imperial stout and a publicity stunt gone awry. The beer itself (2007 vintage in a 22 oz. bomber) is as impressive and RIS as I've ever had, with all the 10-weight oil thickness and head that can float a Buick. The flavor is darkly sweet and somewhat fruity, balanced more by the roasted grains than any hops bitterness. I knocked down the drinkablity not so much because of the beer itself (I expect a super-RIS to be quickly sating) but because of the decision to package this beer in 22 oz. bombers. About halfway through the 22 oz., finishing the bottle becomes more tiring than pleasurable. A 12 oz. bottle would be a far more appropriate serving size."
"Someone was cool enough to share a bottle of 2006 Dark Lord at the brewpub on DLD, and my impression is that 2007 is much richer and stronger flavored. But, I was drunk when I tried the 2006..."
"Awesome beer"
"As for the hype... this is the most unique beer I've had. Completely different from Stone RIS or Bell's expidition or victory king. There is something here that can't be described in these terms. Definitely worth a try if you get the chance. Is it worth $15 a bottle though? Now thats a tough decision."
"Drinkability takes a hit from the pain it is to get this beer. Also I don't think this a beer that you finish a bomber yourself. The big alcohol makes this a sharing beer. Also $15 a bomber makes it pricey."
"2005 bottle split with a couple friends. Initial smell from the bottle was very good. Appearance was dark black with a small tan head that faded fast. There really was not one distinct flavor that I could pick out. The flavors really seemed melded together. The mouth-feel was viscous, sticky, and thick. The alcohol was completely hidden, maybe the aging helped. Overall, this is a really good beer but don't get caught up in the hype."
"I got my limit on DL day and I think those will last me until DL Day 08. Overall I think it lives up to the hype, and it's a really amazing beer."
"I gave this wonderful beer it's lowest rating in drinkability for a number of reasons. Only being available once a year, and yes...it's high price, on one side...High alcohol content, and the fact that it's extremely complex and very rich as the other. It is an excellent beer, but it's definitely a sipper...You've just gotta be prepared for it!!!!"
"The beer pours a very thick, pure stream of blackness topped with a small and very dark tan head. Aroma is some bourbon-ness, a fair amount of coffee, some sweet alcohol esters, and a hint of cherry. Flavor is exceedingly smooth, and it subtley builds to a very full yet not overwhelming coffee-ness. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and viscous, like delicious motor oil."
"Warming on the throat but not burning. Mysterious mouthfeel. Sweet and smooth then bitter and harsh. Warm and comfy then intense and challenging. Molten. Public Enemy are liars. Believe the hype"
"D: So incredibly complex, this is definitely not a beer to be trifled with. The alcohol is very well hidden but by the end of half of the bottle you are already looking for a place to lay down and by the end of the whole bottle, you're lucky if you can even find out what the hell happened to your pants. Yeah, it's that good."
"Poured into a chalice a thick clean/clear black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy dark tannish head, only some tiny islands left over. The nose is of slightly roasted sweet malts, hops, toffee, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, and some caramel. The taste is very nice indeed, consisting of very sweet slightly roasted malts, slight hops, licorice, toffee, slight coffee, and caramel. The alcohol is present at first sip then the sweetness comes into play, leaves a nice warm feeling in the throat. Medium body, a pretty complex RIS. Very drinkable, I really like this brew, I say it lives up to the hype for sure, highly recommended. Thanks again Craig."
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga (2006 vintage drank in April 2007): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small foamy head with average retention. Aroma of honey and sweet malt is overwhelming and somewhat interesting. Taste is way sweeter then expected with some alcohol hint. Body is full and has a creamy and oily texture like I have never seen or tasted before. Low carbonation is to be expected but the alcohol really comes out and I didnt enjoy this part. Some subtle vanilla and roasted malt were noticeable but were for most part covered by sweetness which kind of got gross after half a glass. This beer kind of reminded me of Avery Meph with the dominating sweetness and alcohol. Im glad that I finally had the chance to try this highly coveted beer even thought I am not the biggest IS fanatic out there but unfortunately I wasnt fond of it in the end."
"Call it hype or whatever you want, this is one damn fine beer...one of the very best I've tried. It lived up to all the hype for me. Well worth seeking out, regardless of what it takes."
"2006 bottle. Ah, the venerable Dark Lord. Glugs out of the bottle with the darkness and viscosity of motor oil that hasnt been changed in 30k miles. An inch high whipped mocha head rises to the surface and sets up in the glass, clinging to it with an oily, almost bacon greasy ring. Damn, this is some crazy looking stuff. Aroma isnt over the top, but Im definitely picking up some big roasty malts, bittersweet chocolate and molasses . The coffee seems to hit more in the taste, along with some caramelized raisins, vanilla and rich maple syrup/molasses. Theres definitely a lot going on here. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and full bodied without next to zero hotness. An impressive stout for sure. Does it live up to the hype? Partially. But I think you can pick up some other impy stouts with 90% of the quality/characteristics of this one for far less $ and difficulty. Nevertheless, the Dark Lord is worthy of at least a pedestal next to the throne."
"Bottle of 04 courtesy of the very generous TMoney99. Appears dark brown, almost black with absolutely no head to speak of. This is a very viscous liquid. And I mean very viscous. Just a slight swirl of the glass leaves a coating covering the entire inside of the glass. It does pretty much the same to the inside of your mouth. Taking over and coating it more and more with every sip. A very well put together beer that has many o flavors going on. Some very smooth chocolate and high end coffee. The alcohol was subdued and refined due to the aging. Not as hot or dominating as a fresh bottle. A truly incredible beer, that reminds you every time that you drink it, why its this highly rated."
"2007 batch according to Nick. Cask conditioned pour at Night of the Living Ales. This is my 3rd sample. It pours a sinister black color with absolutely no light coming through. The very minimal head falls to nothing. This one looks like darkness. The aroma is very nice, with a forceful dark fruity fig, a mild alcohol and a sweet chocolate all in excellent balance. The flavor is strong in the fruity fig with a coffee bitter and very mild chocolate in the aftertaste. As it sits on my tongue, the fruit hits again followed by a nice pine hop. Balance is fantastic. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with no carbonation. It has a light syrupy character, but it is mild enough that it works well. Overall, this beer is very nice. It blows the 2006 out of the water, hands down. I'm excited to see the bottled version in a few months."
"Pours dark black with a couple finger buttery tan and pumpkin colored head that slowly recedes. Aroma is a nice bourbony ris aroma with some roasty coffee notes and a sweeter dehydrated fruit, appley aroma. Sweet chocolate flavor hits the tongue first, followed by a apple wine like flavor that slowly grows and finishes slightly tangy, with some anise, some warming alcohol, and some coffee flavor. Every once in a while I get a strange fishy, somewhat salty aftertaste as well. The beer is very soft and silky smooth, the body at some points feels very heavy but at others feels medium. Very good imperial stout, the alcohol is extremely well balanced and definitely creeps up during the 22 ounces. 2006 vintage."
"Astonishing - thanks to JeffKrenner for hooking me up with this amazing brew, I'll be here for a while..."
"This beer pours jet black with a creamy tan head that dissipates to a ring leaving a little lace. The smell is very sweet with coffee and cherry. The taste is very very sweet with soft coffee notes and cherry/dark fruits. The mouthfeel is very thick and creamy with even carbonation. Overall, it would be hard to drink a full bottle of this on account of the sweetness, but it is still tasty."
"After obtaining my share this year I cracked into a bottle as fresh as possible a few days after getting home. I shared this beer with phnphilly and bookert last night. It was AMAZING. The pour is midnight black and motor oil thick with absolutely no head on the beer. When I swirled it in my glass the viscous liquid literally stained the glass brown. The swallow in warm but the massive rich oily smooth feel coats every inch of your mouth and then some. Perfect!!!"
"Quite the treat on the palate. Warm chewey earth flavors of figs, raisins, charred dinner rolls, cocoa, molasses with warm alcohol on the finish. I also detected faint anise at the end. Quite viscous on the tongue, heavy and lip smacking chewey. A true sipping beer. This is a fine RIS however i think the price is a bit prohibitive. Don't get me wrong, this is a great RIS but i can get 3 Stone RIS for the price of this one and be just as happy. You do have to try this."
"Drinkability: I love a good RIS and this one definitely fits the bill. I've been saving it for a special occasion and I'm glad this was waiting. I can't imagine drinking it on a regular basis as it's so much like a port but for today, it's perfect. I hope I can get another soon."
"This beer is an absolute beast, a truly inspired brew that is worth any cost. Nothing else that I've ever had has provided such a depth."
"D- This is an amazing beer but I can't see me drinking this often. I could see this for maybe 2 special occasions a year (if it was easier to get). It is just so strong in flavor and so rich it would be a struggle to drink it often."
"D: This is the tough part... Yes, it was a good, complex stout that I am more than happy to have been able to drink, but I do think it could have used a bit more balancing in the taste, as the richness and vinous molasses were a bit strong. I also, do think its a tad over hyped; If you can get your hands on one, with out a doubt, go for it, but I wouldn't travel far or pay much more to get it again."
"Drinkability... almost perfect, but the availability and the cost take away slightly. And the high ABV, together with the size of the bottle, make it damn difficult to get through one of these alone. But I managed."
"Bottle courtesy, and hanks to the very generoue Philip! Thanks my friend! 05 Bottle/Orange wax- Ive been sitting on this one for about 8 months now, and I felt it was time to treat myself. Pours a pitch black oily abyss with a frothed cap of mocha evil. Lots of spotty lace and dusting. Enormous coffee/coffee bean/double espresso aroma with some dark rum, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, burboun, and american hops.Big big bad deep rooted espresso flavours are accompanied by lots of dark chocolate, woodsy earthy booziness, vanilla extract, dark rum, and lots of bittering hops. FInishes HUGE, dry as the desert, chalky, and assertive. I like it. Once again, thank you so much Phil for saving this, and trading it to me last year. I appreciate the opportunity!"
"2005 bottle. Pours black with a moussey brown head. The heads has some kick ass red tones. Tons of lace. The aroma is full of molasses, vanilla, dried dark fruits, winey alcohol, and cherry cough syrup. Sweet malts, abur sufficenlty bitter. Grape juice, burnt steak, and dried cherries. Meaty thick, coating, and warming. What a huge beer. Im not a real fan of the Russian style of imperial stout. I tend to enjoy the American versions, but this is damn good."
"A good all-round beer. I assume it was better fresh?"
"Can't wait to try this again in a few months, and really again in a few years. God bless Three Floyds Brewery."
"This beer deserves to be one of the best beers in the world. I only wish more BA's could get their hands on it."
"Appearance is an opaque, oily, obsidian deep black, with a thin dark tan head that slowy gives way to a light brown ring of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, dark sweet fruits, chocolate and smoky roasted grain with some brown-sugary molasses. Warming sugary alcohols linger in the nose, slight burning. Taste is just as complex as the smell, even more so. Rich dark chocolate and roasted coffee, more dark fruits, ripe cherries and figs, sweet molasses round out the bittering dark chocolate and malt flavors. Deliciously bitter aftertaste couples with an appreciative alcohol burn that comes and goes sip by sip, leaves one waiting for the next taste. Very quaffable brew, delectable and sinfully decadent. Mouthfeel is definitely full bodied as they come, heavy and viscous like used motor oil from a cold engine. Carbonation is practically nonexistent under the weight of this super-thick stout, just a light tingle present on the tongue. Drinkability is unbelievable, smooth and silken, abv is noticeable but far from overpowering. Easily the best beer I've had, from one of the best breweries. Strongly recommend, will purchase again should the opportunity arise."
" As close to black as it is possible to get with a creamy light brown head that subsides to a surface foam. one of the best smelling beers ever. Roasted malt mixed with coffee. pecans and light smoke. This is beer. the taste is robustly malt with everything else appropriately in the background but what a background-- coffee, chocolate, nuts, a hint of smoke, savory spice-- just a real work of art. Rich, luxurious even, body but not overly syrupy. This is a heavy brew in all respects but so good you'll be tempted to indulge past the point of good sense."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06 (2005 Bottle): After the utter perfection of the first year's sample of this beer, I was frankly a little let down the first time I tried the 2005 bottle a year ago. I have to say this was a lot better after being aged a bit. Pours blacker than black with a thick brown head with good lasting power. Heady aroma of dark malts, coffee and chocolate. Rich and full-bodied, this nectar was made for an almost agonizingly slow drink. Great array of flavors from malt, cocoa, espresso to bitter hops and peppery alcohol. The finish is long and flavorful. Even a realtively small amount of this reminds me why it is one of the best beers on the planet."
"I enjoyed this so much. It's very rich and syrupy with sugar abound! Excellent work. Notch another one up for the Americans."
"Drinkability - well it certainly isn't a session beer, and that is the understatement of the year. It is a real sipper of a beer and one you can sit and enjoy. If you have a chance to taste this beer you must try it. Is it worth the hype, maybe. Is it worth the $15, definately. Don't pass this one up if you are lucky enough to grab one."
"Drinkability: Great. Not sure what else I could say about it - a dark and hungry god that is worthy of its place alongside Stone IRS and other imperial stouts."
"Drinkability/Overall: This is a beast of a beer, no doubt about it. Super boozy, reminds me of a mix between Founders Breakfast Stout with its coffee/chocolate and Bell's Cherry Stout with its funky, yogurty fruits. Impressively drinkable for 13%. A product of hype and supply and demand? Absolutely. Does it live up to said hype? I don't know if any beer could. This is a phenomenal beer, but I can't say that at $15 a bottle and for the pilgrimage and fuss it takes to get it that it's a good value. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of it and will probably end up making the trip to Munster next year to pick up a bottle, but mostly to enjoy the BA comraderie."
"Pours a deep black color with a very dark tan/brown head and light carbonation. The aroma is rich, roasty and sweet with an almost worchestershire sauce or soy sauce character. The flavor is huge, sweet and malty, roasted, some chocolate and coffee character in the middle, followed by some hops flavor and bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is amazingly thick and rich, but still smooth. Alcohol is barely noticeable (in the taste and mouthfeel) after a few months of cellaring. Very drinkable for such a huge beer, but so bold and intense it's a bit much for frequent drinking."
"The carbonation was quite amazing for such a big beer. It helped me drink this by offsetting a little bit of the intense rich flavors the beer had to offer. I might still choose Stone or Bell's RIS's over this one but I'd definitely get this again. Big thanks to the BigDaddy for his kindness in sharing! I really need to do a blind RIS tasting with this one and see how it compares."
"Who can meet most of the hype that surrounds its ale? The Three Floyds men can, the Three Floyds men can"
"Drinkability: Exquisite! Truly, a beer to be celebrated."
"-UF"
"Overall, I definitely gotta thank Sulldaddy for hooking me up for my wedding with this one. Very yummy, and makes a great meal! This is probably the most complete brew I've ever had IMO!!! Except for the oil quality, this one drinks nicely!"
"the hype surrounding this brew is immeasurable, and it not only lived up to it but surpassed it as well, a quality brew with complex flavors, thanks again to Robertdoesbeer, never would've gotten my hands on any without him"
"Bomber purchased at the brewery, Dark Lord day 2006. This beer chugs out of the bottle thick and black. There appears to be very little carbonation at first, but the head forms slowly after the beer is poured. The aroma is big and malty with lots of chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and a grape-like fruitiness. The flavor is very chocolatey. I can understand the comparisons to a milkshake. Alcohol is high enough to burn a little. The flavor is almost perfect, but there is just a little too much sweetness. A bitter roastiness comes in at the finish, but overall this is a sweet beer. The mouthfeel is amazing. It's so thick and smooth. Drinkability is very good for a beer this big. A very interesting take on the Russian Imperial Stout."
"Poured into a chimay chalice....black with a reddish brown head that falls very quickly. Almost no carbonation and no light getting through this beer. The smell is alcohol, dried fruit, coffee, roasted malt. Very complex. The taste executes on the smell....cherries, vanilla, nice finishing hops, and ends with a very nice alcohol warming. Definitely one of the best beers in world. The alcohol is present but very well blended with the other flavors. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style...thick, chewy and smooth. The drinkablility for the style is great, not perfect due to the alcohol, but about as close as it gets. Excellent beer!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Good luck getting your hands on any."
"Too much complexity. On the very tip of the tongue it tastes like a dark wine, then it gets bittersweet, like fire roasted grain, browning apples, and molasses, then it gets regular sweet, like half-dark chocolate and a café mocha, and then it gets a little zippy, like Belgian alcohol and yeast. That's—that's like you're falling down a hill of flavor and then you climb it back up again, from the valley of the alcohol, into the sweet, and then into the bittersweet, and then into the wine. Giving this to a child would be like giving them a bar of acid and taking them to Disneyland. Nothing would ever make them feel happy again, ever."
"A thick cherry brown head grew late in the pour. A very Dark Lord looking beer that seems to suck in light. Marshmallow, coffee, cocoa, even a bit of tobacco along with all kinds of dark malts in the aroma. The aroma is chock full of good stuff. Frickin sweet, man is it sweet, but there is a nice dryness from the dark malt that hits midway. Some solid cherry/tobacco flavors in there as well. Finish is fairly bitter, but not overpowering. Intense, and tasty. It's so sugary my lip stuck to the glass. There it goes again. It's a sipper, but that's a no brainer. Slick, but not too thick. My only complaint is the intense cherry flavor I'm getting. If I were to make a comparison I'd say it's like Storm Kings beefy sibling. Thanks to Shippos for making the pilgrimage!"
"well I thought it was time to rate this beer got a couple in trades from 2 differant R.B.s 06 version. poured a like old black oil that hasmt been changed for 20,000 miles(my favorite color) with a big brown head that didnt last, but left a small amount of lacing. aroma, molasses comes out strong, than got dark sweet cherries that are at their prime, vanilla,, brown sugar, roasted malts and some dark fruits. flavor dark fruits marinated in alcohol, raisins, some chocolate, as the beer warms in my glass it get sweeter a starting to get a slight bitterness to it. not to bad"
"taste is initially dominated by raisins as well. finish follows with some bitter chocolate, sweet raisins, and a kick of alcohol, but a fairly small kick given the 13%. luxuriously rich, velvety mouthfeel with just the right amount of gently massaging carbonation to keep it from cloying. high ABV precludes a high drinkability, but it's very enjoyable. very good brew."
"The taste is very complex....thick coffee flavor, hints of chocolate and a sweetness- raisins? maple syrup? Can't seem to nail it down. This heavy, malty stout has a thick mouthfeel with a smooth finish. Overall the flavors mask the high alcohol content of this beer....very good. I'd like to have tried another, but was limited to one...that's okay, I'll seek it out again next year. The hype is worth it."
"Sampled courtesy of my cousin who brought it to another cousins wedding reception. 2006 edition. Sure beats the Bud that was on tap there. The labeling and packaging with the melted wax is a great presentation. The beer poured a dense midnight black color, just like motor oil, with a brown right around the ends of the glass. The aroma is toasted and a bit sweet, molasses. Very impressive nose. The taste has a nice tough of toasted, but not overly done, coffee and a powerful sweet taste. At times the sweetness was the dominant force in this one but this is still a very fine brew. With a bit of aging, I get this thing would mellow out a bit and would be even more impressive."
"Hype's surely a motherfucker. Its impossible to give this one a fair rating both in that i've heard its praises being sung for years now as well as the difficulty involved with acquiring this huge mother. I have to say though that if this came to me at a reasonable price and unhyped, I would enjoy it but it would be but a drop of beer in the malty oceans."
"Smells of deep, dark fruits, massive amounts of malt, sweet and rich. Thick and sticky with no lacing of the glass. Cherries, plums, dates, caramel. Almost no carbonation at all. Much improved over time and certain to get better."
"I can't imagine how good this will be with another year or so on it..I'll be putting a couple bottles away for sure. Thanks to Three Floyds for once again meeting the nearly ridiculous expectations and hype. Now, if only you can make a little more of this for next year. ;)"
"I liked the beer a lot, although I do think all the hype does this a little injustice. There are better imperial stouts out there that are more readily available, but the laws of supply and demand elevate this one to a more sought out status. After all that hoopla, this still only a beer."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. Worth going to Indiana for."
"Too sweet!!! Also, theres too much alcohol on the nose. Im a bit disappointed. This one needs to sit for a while longer. I sincerely hope this one gets better with age, or that I had a bad bottle."
"2006 gold wax sealed edition into the oversized snifter glass. Poured with a cascading head, loved watching it bubble up to the surface, a dark brown head sat atop, but fizzled away to nothing in very little time. The nose was strong in a cold, espresso smell, with dark chocolate, and alcohol soaked fruits. The initial flavor on the tongue is of dark roasted chocolate covered espresso beans, with a mild hop bite, alcohol follows the sips down the throat. After letting it warm up, more fruitiness comes into the picture, as you start to get an almost rum covered cherry flavor, a black cherry. After the beer became room temperature, the vanilla comes into play, and makes this beer extremely easy to drink. Last years was a bit easier on the palate to drink, but the complexities that made me put an additional half an hour into this beer makes me wonder at the possibilies of how this beer will taste with a few months put on it, or even another year or two."
"Black with faint chestnut highlights (I really had to work at it to spot the colour difference). The dark brown head was fairly dense, with plenty of fine bubbles, and produced some spotty lace. Decent retention too. Very malty and roasty aroma, backed up by some sharp chocolate and (relatively) mild hops. The flavour starts out with a dry roastiness and rich, chocolate sweetness that is balanced nicely by solid bitterness. Some sour cherry notes kick in part way through, followed by licorice and a slight acidity (seemingly due to the quantity of dark malts). This was a thick beer - and it looked viscous even during the pour. Excellent on the palate, very creamy, carbonation was a little on the low side, and it finished with a light warmth. Big and flavourful, I found that the Dark Lord was quite drinkable for a beer of its size. Thanks for the trade, autumnaldave!"
"The body is quite thick without being too syrupy. Especially sludgy towards the end of the bottle. Good stuff. As much as I enjoy drinking it, it's almost too much to drink a bottle of this to yourself. I'm glad I had a roommate to enjoy it with, without whom I wouldn't have gotten the 6 bottles anyway."
"Pours a menacing opaque, black color, with no chance of light getting through. A nice half inch thick, dark tan head forms. Some spotty lacing. This beer is thick, and you can see it cling to the sides of the glass. Lots of big roasted malt aromas, dark fruits, dark chocolate, with hints of coffee and alcohol. Burnt coffee, is what I taste first. Sweet roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate and dark fruits come next. Very complex, but easy to drink for such a big beer. Big, rich, thick and creamy all descibe the mouthfeel. You really don't notice the alcohol, after a few sips. Another one of those beers that tastes better as it warms. I'm sure it will take me all night to finish this bottle. Looking foward to trying this again in six months."
"Mouthfeel is big and chewy with a rich maltiness. Smooth and suprisingly easy to drink, I'm gonna enjoy the hell outta this bottle, a definite sipper. I'm happy to report that I love this year's version easily as much as the 2005 version. I'll be cracking an orange waxed '05 bottle soon to see how it's holding up. Dark Lord reigns supreme in my book."
"Drinkability is also quite high considering the strength and robustness."
"This bottle is between 1-2 years old, stored in my fridge. The smell is surprisingly less potent than I expected. Nothing wrong with that, I expected like most other imperials stouts that the potent smell would be over the top. Maybe after a year or so it has been subdued. I'm smelling a very balanced roasted malt and sweet alcohol. But both are balanced with an awesome chocolate coco powder smell. Taste is fairly balanced. The outstanding flavor is a sweetness at the end, yeah thats right, the end. This is a very outstanding ""time line beer"" I mean in that over the 2 seconds each flavor comes and goes at it's intended time and doesnt step on the toes of the other flavors. Roasted malt, to alcohol, to hops, all very balanced and smooth, then comes the sweet chocolate back on the front of the tongue and another round of slightly bitter hops. Mouth feel is smooth and thick, and even leaves your lips sticky from the hop oils. Overall a very complex but easy drinking beer."
"Sadly this seems to be a case where the hype led me to expect more from the beer than it could actually deliver. It was interesting as a novelty but this isn't a brew that I'm likely to seek out again. I've had a few other 'big stouts' that I'd love to go back and revisit but this one isn't going to be on that list."
"Overall, a freakishly amazing brew, and I can see why people are after this with abandon. Thanks again to Crosling for the sharing! Astonishing."
"Finally entering my review for this one, sorry to everyone that it took so long. Thanks to fellow BA's Stonecrusher and kmpitz2 for the bottle. My thoughts were that this was going to be a dark sludgy oozefest, but that wasn't the case. Bottle was shared with David and fellow BA Londonporter, which is a great way to share and talk about the brew. Pours were pitch black, with a good milk chocolate head, and ruby highlights in the glass. Mouthfeel was thick, but not sludgy. This brew exhibited it's complexity in the aroma and the taste. Notes picked up varied from dark fruit, molasses, leather, and wine. These were also picked up in the taste, although there was more malt present, plus favorite combination of chocolate and coffee, with some burnt sugar in there as well."
"Drinkability: It's hard to find a fault in this beer, worth the hype, worth saving for my 1000th beer reviewed. A huge thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for hooking me up with one of the best beers anywhere."
"This beer lived up to its hype. I didn't think it would but it did. Now, the search for another bottle begins'!"
"This is a masterpiece, and worth the money... this is absolute *must* for the enthusiast who wants to discover how far an Imperial Stout can be pushed."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is incredible. Chewy doesnt even beging to describe the thickness of the mouthfeel. This coats your mouth to the point where almost nothing else could get through. Drinkability is really dam near perfect. There is enough sweetness and bitterness to keep your attention. This beer is everything I have heard it was and then some. I have at last met my Overlord."
"And so, in the end I genuinely tried to resist joining the masses in blindly praising this beer. Ultimately however, based on my meticulous tasting, I have found that the glory and laud that this beer has garnered are well deserved."
"This beer is a mess. Why it gets such high marks is beyond me. But everybody's different, and I, for one, like just a little balance in my beers, even the smack-you-upside-the-head ones. Great color, good aroma, but just a thick, fudgy, coffeeish, alcoholic pancake syrup if you ask me. Again, mouthfeel is smooth and rich, a real revelation, actually, but I wouldn't want to drink more than a thimbleful of this in a sitting. Oh well, I guess I'll have to worship another lord."
"I've been saving this bottle for some time and today seemed like as good a day as any to finally crack open the waxed bottle (Jan 7, 2006; 2005 release). Pours a thick, oily, black with a robust, pillowy, reddish, tan head, which persists through consumption and laces the glass nicely. Roasted coffee and chocolate aromas issue forth, along with plums, figs and a bit of smoke. The alcohol buried within is hidden fairly well but does come forward, particularly as it warms. Chocolate, coffee, molasses, and dark fruits greet the palate. Deliciously complex with its initial sweetness balanced by a dry and slightly bitter finish. Very smooth, with some sticky sweetness in the mouth, this is a very easy drinker despite the alcohol and big flavor."
"This is a great looking stout  jet black, almost shiny with a head that went away then came back bigger and browner with a little swirl. The nose was all alcohol with hints of bitter chocolate and coffee trying but failing to get through. Lots of great flavors but the alcohol is way too dominant. I like the hop bitterness and dark chocolate but the alcohol burn tells me that this may need a bit more time to settle. Im happy to have tried it but I cant say that I would give my left beer nut for it. Thanks to Kmpitz2 for this bottle."
"Halved a bottle of this giant with dirtylou on the last night of my stay in Madison. I suppose this is from the 2005 release."
"drinkability: half a bomber will be plenty but this is a very smooth imp stout"
"Mouthfeel is so heavy and sticky, it's almost tar. Black whole milk is the best way to describe it. Thickest beer I've ever encountered. It's an effort to get down, like x-ray barium. It makes my head throb, but it feels so good I can't stop. I couldn't session this -- but I'd definitely seek it out again."
"What can be added about this one? Sampled at the Blind Tiger thanks to Mike/eyedrinkale. Pours coal Black with a creamy darkest of tans head. Creamy, rich and milkshake like in mouthfeel. Loads of flavor bursting onto the palate. Coffee, chocolate, raisins, figs, burnt fruits. Complex, bold, flavorful...simply world class....wonderfully dark, thick and sludgy. Wish I could get my hands on more of this stuff!"
"Drinkability? Don't have the means or desire to have many, nor do I think anyone does. How fast did my 22 oz bottle go? Less than a half hour. And I'm pretty ripped."
"Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Served after being chilled in the fridge for about 20 minutes. Creamy mouthfeel that just slides down the throat very nicely. Little bit of an alcohol burn too. Incredibly easy to drink that is kind of warming on a chilly autumn evening."
" Mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. Creamy, with an ever so slight carbonation. Normally, this style is not the most drinkable for me, but if I had a case, I would have had a second bottle tonight. I will not miss the next release. For me, this has lived up to the hype, if not exceeded it."
"This is one excellent beer that I hope I can get more of in the future."
"Pours out black as night, with a tan head. Head retention long, high, lacing throughout. Aroma of chocolate, raisons, licorice, coffee. Flavors fruit seemingly dry, chocolate, coffee, with smoke also. Those were all that I can distinguish, more in there. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkably is high for flavor but the alcohol will catch up with you."
"A real gem and certainly the benchmark for the style."
"[edit] 13%?? I knew it was high in ABV, but no idea it was that high. This stuff definitely gets a ""5" for mouthfeel, there's no way you'd know it was that high until you were floored."
"A sipper, and honestly, glad I split out the bottle with 2 others, but, wish I had another for on down the line at the same time."
"overall: this brew is huge and damn near perfect. flawless appearance, taste and mouthfeel. i can't give a 5 for smell 'cause bell's expedition stout was the best smelling ris i've experienced. but close to perfect in that catagory as well. i love stouts, and the bigger the better. if drinkability wasn't factored in for double stouts, then this is as close to perfect that i've ever had. my greatest appreciation to mnben for hookin' me up with the dark lord in a trade."
"You really have to love Big Beers to drink this. My wife will not touch it. It is much more drinkable than it is available. The price is a bit over the top, but it undoubtably is packed with first quality ingredients, care and nurturing and just costs that much to make.So that helps pace the consumption; otherwise I would drink it all the time, and it would become 'normal' which is NOT what Three Floyds is all about !"
"An absolute must try IMHO.... after all the hype, I had tremendously high expectations, and I was not disappointed."
"So if there are any naysayers out there, any unbelievers or nonbelievers that this can be as good as people say it is. Bulee' dat! It is. And then some. I'm keeping it on the ol' ""want list"" because I want more. I want an endless supply. It's that good. BuckeyeNation...I will trade whatever to get more of this. Many many many thanks."
"This is very well the best beer I've ever had, prior to this I had a scattered love for deep stouts, but this brought me around. It is simply too good for someone not to try at least once. Were I to have a final meal, this would be my choice of beer, bar none."
"Beer is good. Happy beering. Thanks to orbitalr0x for the bottle."
"I intitially thought that the drinkability of this was hindered by its intensity, but I've change my mind on that. As you progress through the glass, it warms and changes and becomes more complex. It's a sipper, not unlike a Sam Adams Triple Bock or Dogfish Head World Wide Stout; and as such, it has a great drinkability."
"The only way I could finish my portion was to actually dilute it, 2 parts DL and one part water. This was a great combination that made for a really roasty dry stout."
"Overall: Well basically, yeah, this is as good as I thought it was In my top couple beers of all time. It's just magnificent."
"Drinkability: Not to be indulged everyday, this stout demands a special occasion; a wondrous potion with an incredible mouthfeel that sets it apart from other beers"
"Slàinte!"
"This bottle has been lying in wait, biding its time, eagerly awaiting its chance to impress the hell out of me for well over one year now. And the hell has been impressed out of me and then some. DL is a legendary beer that deserves every one of the breathless accolades from its legion of devoted acolytes. Count me among the converted. All hail the Dark Lord!"
"out of the bomber, into a snifter. pours thick and viscous, completely opaque with a nice dark tan head that settles after a minute or two to leave a nice ring of lace as i work my way through this monster. smells of chocolate cake, dark coffee, molasses, and maybe a bit of human blood. the taste is incredibly restrained and subtle for a bone crushing, 13% stout: chocolate, creamy coffee, plums (?), and a creeping, extremely subtle alcohol sting that reveals itself more and more as the beer warms. i've never had a bottled beer so finely carbonated, and the combination of this smoothness with the intense viscosity lets me coat each and every part of my mouth with this glorious beer before it slinks away to warm my belly and curl my toes. how to rate the drinkability? this is certainly the antithesis of a session beer, but the perfect flavor and impeccable mouthfeel make for easy, utterly enjoyable drinking. i can scarcely imagine a beer being better."
"The beer leaves a sweet sticky residue on my lips after each sip. This is a very tasty beer, I am amazed at the lack of alcohol presence and also surprised that the bitter coffee finish, when I expected more of a twangy sweet finish. Quite a nice beer and well worth the quest many take to obtain it!"
"I can obviously see why this beer is among the top ranked in the world. After drinking a lot of imperial stouts lately, this one is a certain standout. After burrying your nose in this one, I immediately detected port wine and expresso. Complexly melded and mellowed. Close behind lurks cherries, dates, prunes and to a lesser extent, a tartness in the range of soy sauce, yeast, and earthiness. Taste brings about an abundance of flavors; most notibly chocolate covered cherries and bourbon balls. Others include bittersweet chocolate, coffee, prunes, dates, figs, berries, caramel, vanilla, cream, hops, and alcohol. These flavors are not what makes this beer great. What does is that it is aged to perfection. Flavors extend forever and reveal themselves constantly and subtlely because of its mellow maturity and the fusion of ingredients. I could drink a thousand of these and always find new flavors. Because of the maturation, this one isn't as thick or as heavy as expected, but not as abrasive either. Coats the palate very well and lingers into today. It's the gift that keeps on giving. Finishes strong, bold and mimicks all the flavor in the nose and body. Final statement: One of the most complex beers that I have ever tried."
"This was an early birthday gift from BuckeyeNation a few months ago, but I held onto it until my birthday a few days ago, and what a generous gift."
"Glad to have tried it but I probably won't be bothering with this one in the future unless the recipe changes."
"One final note: If you see this, try it. That being said, I will not likely have this again because of the price. While it is a truly an exceptional beer, there are other, less expensive exceptional beers that I like as well."
"A great beer to sit and sip and enjoy. Nothing would stop you from drinking this for hours, apart from the 13% abv, which, by the time I had finished my half of the big ol' bottle, was starting to take hold."
"Many thanks to TheLoneGunman for reserving two bottles of this sweet nectar for me. I dont know how long Ill be able to store the last bottle of this liquid temptation."
"This is best to share with a friend after 22oz I don't think I could of taken another sip."
"Edit (12/23/05): After trying a sample at room temperature and aged 8 months, most of the alcohol is gone from the smell. It now smells richly of milk chocolate and coffee and fruit. The taste has also changed quite a bit. Dark chocolate has almost totally taken over. It is STRONG - the finish lingers forever with its wonderful chocolatey bitterness. I've bumped up the smell to 4.5 from 4.0 and the drinkability to 5.0 from 4.5. This is as close to the perfect beer as I have ever experienced."
"WoW!!! This beer was increasingly underwhelming with each sip. I hate that most of Beer Advocate disagrees with me about this but I don't get the hype over this beer other that the fact that it seriously looks like motoroil and has a super thick mouthfeel. The bottle promises an inverted cascading carbonation--which it didn't provide. Impy stouts normally aren't all that carbonated and this was no exception but why put this claim on the bottle label?!?! Taste is mildly acrid with some burnt fruit flavors and maybe some coffee/mochachino flavors. The finish is acrid and burnt, not my definintion of flavorful. The burnyness lingers well after the finish. In short, this beer was interesting and great to finally try but was lacking and didn't live up to my idea of a world class imperial stout."
"Well, I'm down to my last couple sips of the sludge that's grudgingly leaving the glass. I wish I had a giraffe's tongue to get every speck of beer outta the glass. Hell, I might put this glass back on the shelf dirty just so I can smell it tomorrow. Dark Lord is seductively smooth and lush and so complex. The epitomy of imperial stouts. Huge thanks to jables for sending this bottle my way January, 2004."
"Wow, I had been excited about opening this one for a while. Cracked the orange wax, killed one bottle opener and then continued. Poured, and a dark brown/tan head rose from the depths, laced and stuck around until i finished my goblet. The lace just stuck to the glass like glue. The beer is black as anything I've seen, I thought it was going to suck in all the light from outside. Very oily consistently, very thick. Smells like coffee, with a slight slight alcohol underton, very roasty and you can smell the bitterness from the malts. The taste is like fine espresso, very nice and bitter coffee, the monster 13% ABV camoflaged in the flavour. Very roasty bitter and dry, and not very sweet like most imperial stouts I've had. The mouthfeel was insanely thick and coating, but this beer was very smooth and creamy for how big it is. I would not be able to drink a whole bottle but what I had was enough to know this is definately a world class beer, can't wait to open my other bottle."
"Drinkability is bad ass kick ass lives up to the hype and then some, no doubt it should be the number one Double Stout. Wishing I had more these are expensive and hard to come by yes, but worth it, can I have a amen. Praise to the Dark Lord, need to plan a trip to the brewery next release."
"Intense, slow drink. Gorgeous dark colour. Sweet sour. Bitter at first, Roasty finish. Chocolate malt subdued to roasty Starbucks coffee. Alcohol clobbers later. Very smooth. Medium-thick mouthfeel. Had 2011, and it is good but very sugary.Averaging my 4 ratings over the years."
"Drinkability/Impression: This monster stout seems to change aromas and flavors with each sip, very playful on the palate. Best stout I've ever had and worthy of its hype. I could drink this all day, every day. Drinkability limited only by availability and price. Wow! Get your paws on some of these if you can find it."
"This beer pours a black so dark that I think it actually makes the room a little darker. It pours as thick as motor oil. The head is very dark brown. The head is very thick and creamy looking. It fades very slowly. I have been looking at it for about 5 minutes, and it still has almost the same amount of head as when I first filled the glass. It leaves laces so thick, I can not see through them. This beer smells strongly of alcohol. After the wave of alcohol, coffee aroma is present. It also smells strongly of roasted malts. Hints of chocolate are also present. As for hops, there is a slight aroma, but it is almost totally masked by stronger aromas. The first sip of this beer makes all the work, and expense I went to trying to get it all worth while. It tastes very strongly of coffee and chocolate. It is quite bitter, but very well balanced. It is very malty. The alcohol tates is a little harder to make out, but it warms my throat as it goes down. This beer is very thick and creamy. It is a very full bodied beer. It sits heavy on the palate, leaving a coffeelike aftertaste. Due to the rather high alcohol content, and the very aggressive flavor, this beer might not be the best session beer for some. I personally think I could drink it all night, or at least untill the alcohol got to me. I think this beer is amazing. I wish it was not so hard to come by. I would like to thank both goodbyeohio, and mentor for supplying me with this great beer. In a few months I will drink my other bottle and compare it. I just hope I can wait that long."
"Notes: This beer is comforting like a wooly blanket. There is little more to say here. Don't miss."
"Well I have waited a long time to try this beer, and this brewery sure made me pay for it, but then Dreadnaught should have given me a clue. This beer poured dark as a black hole with no light penatrating it's heavy mass and just probably sucking it in. It formed a reverse cascading (aka Guiness) like foamy dark brown head that refused to leave and coated my Expedition snifter solidly with lace. The aroma was heavy on the malt, with sharp hits of expresso coffee, dark chocolate and and plums. The flavor was heavy malt, dark chocolate with a lighter touch of expresso coffee. The body on this this one is quite thick and creamy while the finish is bittersweet. The alcohol is well hidden and tends to finally make its apparence like a brick wall in the dark. This is a amazing brew, but I doubt I will pay for it again at it's current cost, considering I can get Expedition in my area cheaper. If I begged them to get rid of the wax, will that drop the price a little?"
"22 ounce bottle, 2005 release. Thanks to beerinator for purchasing and sending the beer and to AKSmokedPorter for receiving the bottles for me and bringing to his place of work for me to pick up."
"I owe Kevin (kmpitz2) my first born for picking this up for me. 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep onyx black color with three heaping fingers of very dark tan head that seem to cascade like a nitro brew, and never goes away. There is an insane amount of lacing. The smell is rich and full of dark roasted malt with just a bit of sweetness. Even some dark fruit present. Lingering espresso as well. The taste is very intense. The amount of burnt malt that comes through at first is off the scale. It's fucking huge! Lots of coffee, chocolate, and candied plums. The finish is nice and hoppy, and has a lingering espresso bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy, just coating the tongue. I can feel it on my lips after the beer is gone. The drinkability is very very nice for a 13% brew. Astonishing."
"heres a moment I have been waiting for, lets see if it was worth the wait. Pours black and syrup like. Not traces of dark red or brown like you see in most stouts. Dark brown and thick bubbley head. Dark foam litterally sticks to the edge of the glass. This is so thinck the bubbles almost stay suspended in the beer. Smells of roasty dark malts and molasses. Coffee and alcohol are present as well. Some hoppy notes that round off the nose. Holy crap is this stuff potent. Taste is bitter charred dark malts up front. Tastes like charcoal was thrown into the mash. Warming alcohol makes itself known for sure. Some coffee and molasses notes. This beer is dry and biter, a la charred. Damn is all I can say. This stuff is thick, it freaking coats my mouth throat and stomach. Viscous is an understatement. The aftertaste is still bitter. Wow, this beer kicks ass. Drinkability is a little lowere because it is so thick but damn if I wouldnt want to drink these all the time. This is a winner, too bad its so hard to get ahold of. I know they are living off the hype, but make more of this, and get it up to wisconsin damnit."
"D-Wow this is a big tasty beer, and even though its young it still is very impressive. The only fault I see is it needs a little age to blend but then it might loose that great hop quality that you don't expect in a beer this big. I will be in line next year for more of this brew."
"Overall: I must say I'm really kind of surprised. I was expecting a good beer, but no where near this good. This certainly lives up to whatever hype that has been placed upon it. I am so glad I have another bottle in the cellar waiting for a special occasion."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for picking me up a case of this stuff. 2005 vintage. Cellar temperature. This beer pours a darkest of dark color with a tall and thick brown (mocha) head that has great retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Very attractive and also a bit daunting. The aroma is all about coffee. Lots and lots of coffee/expresso. Maybe a slightest hint of alcohol, but minimal. Some slight chocolate in there as well, but mostly coffee. The flavor kicks you in the face. Strong presence of coffee and chocolate with hints of dark fruit and molasses. Big, big taste. The body is huge. Tons and tons of body, but it manages to avoid the oily syrup feel (which is great). Soooo thick. Awesome. Just awesome. The alcohol is very well hidden in this darkness. Drinkability is extremely good for 13% and they somehow avoid some of the drinkability problems that other large impy stouts have. Awesome brew. Glad I have most of a case left."
"This was a beer experience."
"The drinkability was only a problem with the bottles we purchased. They needed to be racked due to sediment."
"Overall, is it still a perfect 5.0? Yes, indeedee, it certainly is. This is the pinnacle of the ADS style and stands apart from the crowd like Tiger Woods at a childs Putt-Putt golf park."
"And so is this."
"A great beer. Every aspect of it was over-the-top huge. The mouthfeel and appearance were totally unique and blew me away. As far as aroma and taste, they were wonderful and crazy big, but nothing unique when it comes to imperial stouts. To me, this was just like a Sam Smith's Imperial that goes to 11."
"No sludge bottle. No head to cover this tar black oil body. Who cares about head anyway, lets not bother with such futile details. Restrained aroma, hypothesis that the huge body keeps it from expressing, but its still lacking in the department. You have to fight to get a not so exciting vinous alcohol nose, though you would never expect 13%. Slight fruity hints when warming, mild cocoa, even milder roastiness. Who cares about aroma anyway? Lets not bother with such futile details. There it comes, the palate baby, the mouthfeel! Heavy, oily, thicker than syrup, fuller than 35% cream, neglectable carbo is just fitting perfectly with that beast. Chocolate cream. Easily the thickest beer in the universe as I imagine it. Taste comprises of extreme molasses. Big honey/maple sweetness. Excessive sweetness in fact, this never aimed to be balance and it isnt. It remains rather sustained and with nice subtle nuance for a 13% beer with no in your face flavours, it just wants to be heavy. Well contained hoppiness (flower, herbs, grapefruit), chocolatey. It doesnt taste fully fermented ultimately, but again, this has to be an effect from the mouthfeel. It just tastes incredibly sweet and without much of the fruitiness Id like in an impy. Cloying finish, unique. 1 yr certainly did it good because as it is now, it tastes like malt syrup mixed with molasses. Extremely challenging and pleasant beer to try, but in small quantities. A beer to share, a beer to be scared of, a beer to admire. Congratz to the people at FFF for their adventurous nature"
"Wyll-"
"Thanks to wyldder for the sample. Pours jet balck and syrupy. Smell is of molasses and soy sauce....interesting. Taste was somewhat disappointing...a lot of malt, naturally some alcohol, but not a great deal more. Mouthfeel is thick and it is too syrupy. Drinkability is smooth and coats the tongue nicely."
"Black. There is not sissy hue to this beer. There is no color depth, just a soulless black tar abyss. When I held my glass to a light I played God and created an eclipse. The pour was impressive, it exited the bottle like motor oil after 6,000 miles. Even though a head didnt really form this beer is still awesome in appearance; only a few foamy pockets, like small islands of brunette bubbles, formed in the middle of the dark liquid. There was a thin collar too. No subsequent lacing. Even though this beer sat in by glass lifeless it still looked most daunting! Served a tickle warmer than cellar temperature. Even at this warmth the nose was a little standoffish for me. Now, with that said, the aromas that were presented were magical. There were huge roasty qualities that were perfectly rounded into form by a cornucopia of other smells. Im impressed there was just a trace of alcohol, incredible considering the lofty abv. I guest Three Floyds is *that* much better than Avery (but I knew that!). Fruits are deep, dark, tropical with raisins, dates, grapes, and caramel covered apples. Port wine. Brandy. Candied sugar that is burnt around the edges. Assertive hops with Pacific Northwest bloodlines. Acidic. Astringent. Weak hint of coffee. Molasses. Winey. Burnt. Freaking awesome! There is an amazing amount of depth; especially considering the potency is moderate. Inviting, duh. The first sip of this motherfucker brought moisture to my eyes. Goddamn, I needed a moment to compose my thoughts. I was hoping the beer would be good. I was praying it wouldnt be an alcoholic bomb. It wasnt. How could another Imperial Stout ever top this beer? It can. It is blasphemy to think otherwise. The palate is rich, chewy, and fairly sweet but far from cloying even though there seems to be about four types of sugar in the mix. Brown sugar and candied sugar just to name the most prevalent. Molasses. Burnt sugar. Toffee. Caramel apples. Hints of chocolate covered raisins. Figs. Assorted spices. Aggressive American hops bitterness that plays so gleefully with the astringency of the roast. Espresso. Soft acidity at the back that melts into some marmalade-like fruitiness, at the finish is the only warmth from the alcohol. Some spice too. The aftertaste has a clean ale/hoppy thing going on, all I can say is it reminds me of a Rogue beer. I dont know how to describe this feel but it is a good thing! Overall the palate is a gem. Perfection really. I love the hop burps too! Full bodied. Low carbonation. Thick, heavy but not sluggish mouthfeel, surprisingly smooth actually. Flawless. Amazing. I have had about a half dozen beers that have truly amazed me. Dark Lord is now added to the list. Is this the best Imperial Stout Ive ever had? Yes. Is it the best beer Ive ever had? Yes but it is tied with a couple others. It is truly amazing. Every sip was like suckling a Goddess teat. I wish I had about fifty bottles in the cellar but, alas, I had one bomber. I am indebted to cretemixer forever. Thank you so much for this beer. Dark Lord is so worthy of its high praise. World Class. Highly Recommended."
"22oz Bomber: This beer pours thick: It has the consistency of motor oil. The color is almost the same, but it is a very dark brown. If you hold it to the light, it actually has a hint of a Guinness-like cascade. The head is strong and brown. The aroma is interesting: imagine if you will chocolate hops, because that is what it smells like. The taste is heavy and sweet: mainly chocolate, with hints of plums and coffee, other varied fruits. I can also taste some hops, but no bitterness makes it through. Excellent! Thanks to TAR for this trade!!!"
"I can still taste her kiss on my lips and smell her sweat on my body."
"A most sincere thank you goes to Buckeyenation for allowing me this delectable opportunity."
"An amazing beer. Utterly disproportionate, over-the-top, ginormous and massive. But a joy to drink nevertheless. A true one-of-a-kind."
"Overall, an interesting beer, but a bit of a disappointment from the brewery."
"Well, we decided to open this one up in order to celebrate the beginning of ""Big"" Ben Roethelisberger's long Steeler career, and it's certainly fitting. This is the perfect Imperial Stout, and easily the best in the world...so rich and chocolatey and anisey, but without alcohol getting in the way, and this is one that I would absolutely kill to have again!!! Thank you to trbeer and cretemixer for getting me the bottle!!!"
"silenius. I bow to thee."
"I'm speaking to you from the future...It's 2005 now and I just opened a new edition of the Dark Lord...orange wax...Damn...this is good!!! I get smell meat and I'm no vegan...This is nose ass beer. The taste is knock down good. The pour was 30 wt. The head was slight and two toned with streaks of white which mysteriously disappeared. No more reviewing for now...time for drinking...All's well...Thank you Floyds."
"I have 6 left and will be ageing these and will have one a year until they are gone."
"All I can say is god I adore this stuff!"
"Notes: I am deeply indebted to CreteMixer for this bottle. Just an epic tasting and one that I'll remember and cherish for quite a long time."
"This came in a menacing looking 22oz bomber that was dipped in red wax to give the appearance of being sealed in blood. A cartoon picture of the dark lord is on the label as well to add to the overall Dark Lord theme. Looking like the used oil at jiffy lube this stuff pours out as thick as I have ever seen. It is pitch black almost verging on sucking in all surrounding. The head starts impressively before falling into a cap of bubbles and leaving not lacing but a film over any portion of the glass that it comes in contact with. Aroma is of chocolate covered berries, molasses and roasted malts. The flavor is tremendous standing out much more than the scent with chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruits blending for a complex palette experience. A slight coffee bitter aftertaste is also present as well as a slightly sour taste as it warmed. Mouthfeel is ridiculous I have had nothing as thick as this ever and it is amazing. It coats the entire mouth and sits heavy on the tongue, very nice. Drinkability is also excellent there is no sign of the 13% anywhere in this monster. The thickness is the only thing that slowed me down while drinking it. Impressive in all ways I highly recommend this to anyone, hopefully I can come across more bottles of this in the future."
"OK, its 2 am, but I wanted to get this in before bed. First off, what a surprise when the guy at the end of the table says there is a 13% Imperial Stout on cask at the Maproom, let's go! Opaque black with an awesome tan head and lace as well. Aroma fell alittle short, but still found notes of hops, charred and roasted coffee, some dark fruit and warming alcohol. Taste hits you like none other, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some alcohol here as well. Thick, chewy, HUGE mouthfeel. Made your lips just stick to the glass! How awesome."
"This is thick. It pours thick, it feels thick and it sticks to your ribs like a stack of pancakes. Pitch black with a thin brown head. The aroma is chocolate, a little vanilla and soy sauce. The flavor continues with the chocolate and soy sauce with a little bit of molasses. Im really surprised to not notice much if any roast malt in the mix. Ill have to try to make it up north when its on tap and try this again, but this definitely did not live up to expectations."
"Thanks to jackndan/BIF6."
"Poured thick and black like used 15w50 motor oil in our diesel. Slight bit of coffee-colored head rose up, than sank beneath the surface, leaving behind only remnants of lacing in the middle of the beer. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, rum-soaked plums waft from the glass. Taste is wow. Just.... wow. It tastes as thick as it poured, tons of malt loaded in here, takes 15 seconds just to clear your palate. Alcohol is very subdued - one deadly brew here. Roasted malts, chocolate, incredible residual sweetness. Unholy hell, this is the epitome of imperial stout. I could drink this stuff all week long, since the syrupy sticky mouthfeel makes rapid quaffing of this brew impossible. Absolutely fantastic stuff."
"Bow down, one and all, bow before your Dark Lord, and don't mess around, he can do that finger-chokey- thingy, just like Lord Vader, I mean, they're practically cousins, so, unless you know some Jedi juju, stray far away from the terrible magic of the Dark Lord...unless you enjoy this particular punishment...which I do! In spades!"
"Friggin' rich dark black motor oil of a look. Thick persistant milk cocoa colored head. Very rich lookin'. Sweet bitter chocolate and expresso pungent nose. Thick coffee, mocha, rich malt and a hoppy green flavored finish. The thickest fullest mouth I have ever had in a beer. Very good and very overwhelming. Rediculas!"
"Appearance was very black and thick, when held up to the light it looked a bit like old blood around the edges, but in a good way. Had a bit of a brown head that didnt last very long. It smelled good but not much. It didnt give off enough of an aroma, that's why I had to dock points. It smelled a bit like fresh coffee, then old coffee, and slightly vinous. It tasted absolutely perfect! So much going on, and in such a great blend. Chocolate fudge syrup, roasted coffee, cherry wine, a hint of chocolate covered Belgian waffles that you get in Belgium, with an aftertaste thats similar to the aftertaste of strong coffee. Pretty sweet but too much so, with a bitter end. There really isn't more than a teeny hint of alcohol in the taste. I guess there's just too much other stuff going on. Mouthfeel is THICK. Well in the beginning of the bottle it is just regular syrupy thick, and as you get down to the bottom, well it almost gets to be too much. It's a bit ridiculous. Like pudding that's not quite set yet, real thick but still drinkable. I got the absolute end of the bottle and I really did have to chew. That was a little disturbing, but kind of cool at the same time. Drinkability, well, I know this is it now, but I want more, lots more! It's so drinkable. At 13% abv, it does not taste or feel like it. Like a happy chocolatey sweet waffle meal with wine and coffee and pudding, all together in one bottle."
"Drinkability is enormously high. Have to find this on draught next year. Wow, I'm really speechless on this one, simply great beer. Can't imagine a better beer."
"Another one of those beers from Three Floyd's ""It's not normal", well when I heard about this 13% Imperial Russian Stout I thought to myself that's not normal. Well, here we are about to break through the layer of red triple dipped wax to break the seal of the beastly brew. The bottle depicts in comic book fashion a demon possessed viking crushing skulls and what not, but either way I'm guessing he's the Dark Lord. Let's see what he has to offer my senses. Appearance on this one goes as follows, in the pour this maybe the thickest textured brew I have ever poured the addition of molasses may have something to do with that. Color spectrum yep it's dark simply engulfs all visible light waves leaves behind a resilient line of thin moccha tan head that with my first sip starts to leave trickles of lace. Aromatics contained in this nectar are deep thunderous colliding waves dark chocolate, wine like fruit notes arising from the trenches of this beer, along with an espresso barrel aged like finish hop presence is evident and as it warms this is even more so for 13%abv it's not burning any nose hairs, which is a good thing. If nothing else about this beer grabs ahold of you, the flavor is sure to. Massive unparalleled possibly brings another style about redefining the Imperial Stout category for me, brings huge staggering amount of slightly burnt dark roasted malts to the palate the molasses is evident with alcohol infused fruit namingly tart cherry notes screaming out while blending perfectly in this orgy of flavor. A definite strong coffe presence is welcoming and eye opening at the same time, just burped up a load of hops bringing about another wonderful aspect of this beer. Three Floyd's have done it again the Dreadnaught stands as my favorite Imperial IPA this may just take the throne as my all time favorite Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel is chewy yes a beer can be chewy, don't believe me try this one it says it all. Once again the molasses takes the reigns adding to this full bodied beers complexity on the palate tame carbonation wouldn't want it any other way, after pouring in the final yeast sediment from the bottle the texture becomes thicker which is hard to believe. Drinkability couldn't believe that a beer this massive could be so tasty and drinkable in a 22 ounce portion, I don't know what has me completely sold on this beer but it's amazing. Complex as all hell with a huge mouthfeel, aromatics are mesmorizing, and the taste is orchestrated to perfection. Believe the hype this brew will humble you to the Dark Lord the true master of this style, the 3F's have pushed the envelope and succeeded once again I smell a victory."
"NB: To extract the most out of this, I put the ""sludge"" in a chinoise and gently pressed out what I could into the second glass. It would be interesting to see what a ""homogenized"" version might be like."
"The beer as it slowly oozes out of the 22-ounce brown bottle pours as thick as molasses in January in Maine, it literally makes a glugging sound as it excavates itself from its container. Onyx in color, the head a deep chocolate brown that is creamy as whipped chocolate icing and portly in size, the lace a coat of brown to obscure the glass. Nose is rich bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, sweet malt, a treat for both the olfactory and ocular senses, a beer you must sniff to understand its complexity, start is thick and chewy, ambrosial and the top as full as any beer I have ever tasted. Finish is pleasing in its acidity; hops are powerful in their spiciness, the alcohol quite noticeable and the rich sweet chocolate and burnt coffee flavors continue to the parched desert dry aftertaste a quite noticeable tummy warming sensation. Just one fantastic beer, but a word of warning not meant for the weak of palate or people not into strong over the top beers, so if you fall into these categories and you have a Dark Lord sitting around, send it to me immediately if not sooner. lol"
"What can I say Dale other than Thank You!!"
"22oz Bomber 2004. Poured quietly and forming a slight eruption of a head that dissapears quickly. There's about an inch of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. This one is black and thick like oil.The aroma is a deep dark and powerful concoction. There's alot going on here. Some words-vinous, port, chocolate covered cherries, bread and alcohol. Mouthfeel is super thick and smooth with very little carbonation and really sticks to your mouth. The alcohol although well hidden is warming me up right now and I fear I may soon sweat. The flavor is one bitter Imperial. A chocolate Port like flavor with a massive hop attack that bitters gently. This is one big beer."
"And oh yeah, it's sticking to my mouth like Pepto. Pure beer intensity in bottled form."
"a big thanks to jackndan for the sample."
"I must admit that with this intense fresh hop flavor, I am not sure that I want to hold on to the rest of these for a long time, though the 4 inches of sludge at the bottom of this bottle (even after a month of sitting) say that I need to move these to my lagering fridge for quite a bit. The fresh hop flavor is quite good right now, and it is so dominant that I can not even guess how this beer will continue to age. I have a feeling that in a year or two this will be a totally and unexpectedly different beer from what it is now. I have no doubt that the Dark Lord will age gracefully for the next 10 or even 20 years, but will it be better than it is now. Oh well only time will tell, I will just have to hang on to a couple over the years."
"A mighty big thanks and salute to jackndan for getting me the Dark Lord. It was a pleasure."
"I can just imagine what a 2004 Dark Lord will taste like in 2025!"
"My only fault with this beer is the fact it is far too intense to enjoy the full bottle by yourself."
"ng"
"Served on cask at The Map Room in Chicago. Perhaps the thickest beer I've ever sampled. Pitch black, wish I would have had a small flashlight to view with. Carbonation was nil, as was head, which was not unexpected.Smells of heavily roasted malt, hints of coffee and chocolate. Very sweet, I have a feeling the low carbonation of the cask really hid any hop bitterness that may have been there. Given the sweetness I experienced, was surprised to read here that this beer is 13% ABV. Little perceivable alcohol presence."
"OK, on to the Dark Lord. I had heard so many things about this one that I almost shit when I heared they had an aged growler of it for me to try. It poured a small head of dark brown fine to large sized bubbles. It has a mild coffee molasses aroma. The body of this brew is something to behold. It is dark, thick and I mean thick! 70,000 mile old motor oil thick and black as a black hole in space. It has a very strong coffee flavor that was suprisingly smooth initially then finished with a lingering burning sensation from the alcohol. It is definately in a class of its own! Truly a masterpiece! All hail the Dark Lord!"
"Originally Sampled on 14 December 2002. This baby is thick, malty, w/ tastes of cocoa powder & chocolate on the palate. Dark Lord has a wonderfully soft mouthfeel. You can easily spend lots of time sipping this one. I just wish that Three Floyds would bottle it."
"I write only to confirm that it is true. This beer is the reason I roadtripped down to Three Floyds around Christmas and I was not disappointed. This is by far the thickest, most viscous beer I have ever seen. To say it rivals motor oil is to speak truth. This is week old coffee, sludge -- delicious, malty sludge. Drinkable this beer may not be, at least beyond a few ounces. But those few ounces are a true marvel. I'm sure the flavors were wonderful -- but the mouthfeel is the main event here and all my mind will allow me to remember."
"OIL, if you are looking for something thick, your can't get thicker than this. it is so thick it is chewy. over the holidays, my brother, our friend sue, and i took a short trip down to indiana from chicago to go to three floyds. good time. kinda weird atmosphere though, imagine snow outside and cold, everyone inside the brewery, not the brew pub or restaraunt, but the brewery in coat and hats and gloves, drinking great beer. self guided tour. fun indeed, but back to the beer. ok this beast was malt malt malt. hints of chocolate and carmel, but not much else. poured with amazing thick brown head that did not depleate at all. no alcohol flavor and the tiniest hint of hop bitter. the mouthfeel as i said before was like drinking oil. the only downside to this beer would be the drinkablity. i had two and was so worked out that i was ready for a nap. if you get a chance to have this amazing stout, DO NOT pass it up."
"When poured into the glass from the big glass, it was black, black and powerful as the name, and thick like a bottle of 10W 40. When held up to a high intensity light I noticed that the black wasn’t actually black, but a blood brown black. Dense was the color. The head seemed to bubble up towards the end, like the dark lord rising from the black primordial beginnings, its color was a medium brown color, thick but not deep. As I stuck my finger into it to see if it was as sticky as it looked, I swear I felt a pulling sensation. It was sticky but left no lace on the side of the glass. The aroma was intense! I nosed cherries, sweet malt (molasses), tobacco (like skoal or coppenhagen), wichester sauce and as I stirred it, the alcohol peaked its nose up at me and whispered “I’m here too”. The taste was thick and creamy. If there was carbonation I missed it. Not flat, just thick. I noticed flavors of sweet molasses, spices, port wine, fruit (cherries) as it warmed I also noticed hints of chocolate and more cherries and alcohol. Like many beers of this type this only got better as it warmed, warmed from the fires it was born from, stirred and created from the Dark One himself. Truly one of the greatest brews made. I felt different after only consuming 2 ½ pints of this potion, different like I was possessed. The wife said that she was either going to call a priest for a exorcism or take me straight to church because of the look on my face. It was an experience all its own. Thank You 3 Floyds for this beer. Thank you"
"When they finally bottle this ambrosia of the damned(fall/winter 2003 if the rumors at Three Floyds are true) I can already picture the label. Lost souls lined up awaiting their turn to suckle at the teet of the Dark Lord."
