Looks were the best quality unfortunately. Didn't live up to the IS moniker to me... slight roastiness and bitterness on the nose, with a weird smoky note too. Bit smoky and pleasantly bitter on the palate, actually the smokiness would be perfect if this was supposed to be a smoked beer)... lacked some of the bigger coffee and chocolate flavors I expect, and came off a bit thin on the mouthfeel. Upside is that the wife really liked it, and that has to be taken into account, I suppose. Wouldn't search this out, unless I was in the mood for a smoked porter.","Mikus","Feb 20, 2015"

If we had to complain, the mouthfeel thinned more than we hoped, and contributed towards washing out the brightest punches of flavoring.  The best thing about it was hard to pin down, as the aromas and flavors naturally coiled into one another, but unfortunately the same dullness persisted throughout.  We were in a very stouty mood when we pulled this one from the cellar, and it shared between the two of us nicely, and warmly.  Going along with the bottle’s label, we too would recommend enjoying this beer by a roaring fire.  It makes the experience that much richer.","TheBrewo","Feb 08, 2015"

The alcohols are well integrated. My bottle was aged for approximately 7 months from purchase.","brianmandell","Jul 03, 2014"

I netted a sturdy two fingers of dense, deep-tan head as the result of my pour and it sat there stubbornly, like Pussy Riot after being released by Putin. Color was an inky, deep, dark-brown allowing less than ZERO light penetration (SRM = 44). Nose smelled of fire smoke and dark chocolate. Wow. Mouthfeel was thick and viscous and tasted and felt like a dollop of dark chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. The 9.1% ABV was well-masked, making for an alarmingly smooth, easy-drinking beer. Warming, the chocolate flavors became even more prevalent and the smokiness began to wane. The finish was semi-dry, not really sweet at all, but not totally dry, either. I really liked this, despite not being a huge fan of the style.","woodychandler","Mar 08, 2014"

Overall this may not be the most complex stout but still not really flawed and pretty darn drinkable because you barely taste any alcohol + the malt is sweet without being cloying. I could drink a couple of these easily.","Slatetank","Jan 20, 2014"

Very nice and unique aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of milk chocolate, smoke, roasted malt, toffee, cream, coffee, caramel, toast, and earth. No bitterness after the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, cream, toffee, and earth on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slick mouthfeel; a touch thin for 9% though. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial stout. Nice balance of robust and unique stout flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Oct 01, 2012"

I can see why people expecting a big imperial stout have been disappointed - the amount of bitterness in the brew really reminds me of a regular or even a sweet. However, the body of the beer, the drinkability, and the nice malt bill made this a very enjoyable beer.

The 2Bros Imp Stout....has some alcohol in it....let me tell you. Poured into a brandy sniffer and the color was a wonderful dark creamy pour, with tan foam head. Unfortunately the Alcohol over powers the sweet malty undertones of the nose. The taste is decent once the buds get used to the 9.1% ABV!!! Again the alcohol over powers the taste, which has roast, chocolate, coffee, and maybe molasses where perhaps the sweetness comes. Once Again....the alcohol affects the mouthfeel and drinkability.

Excellent drinkability, very palatable and easy to consume with a reasonable abv. Not what I expected in a RIS, but an excellent brew.","lightindarkness","Dec 08, 2007"

Not overly complex, but extremely balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly full due to the thickness of the beer. Does not finish as clean as one would like. The heaviness of this beer hurts its drinkability.

And this one fell short, at least compared to those others. While I'm a big fan of Two Bros beers, I thought this one was disappointing and not very drinkable. Flavor was not very roasty and mouthfeel was a bit watery. And maybe it was when I had it in my evening, but this beer made me feel exceptionally full which led me not to finish it.

The taste is decent, but I feel like its lacking in several key areas namely strength, body and focus. Where I was expecting these things I got a couple other interesting things like some fruit and maybe some extra chocolate or coffee than usual, but these things to me do not make up the lack of the other stuff.

Head what there was, is gone almost immediately, leaving a few little areas of bubbles around the edge, and lacing as well is minimal to non-existent. Aroma is dark grains, and that's about it. Taste is sweet dark malts upfront, some coffee bitterness, and a dry close. Seems closer to a regular stout here. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both not bad, but heaven forbid one rate against the style, this one would be out the door. Not bad for a beer, but not to style, in my mind.","ppoitras","May 13, 2005"

3.37,-11.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black, with no head at all. Sweet chocolate and caramel aroma. The flavor is sweet chocolate with some bitter coffee. This is hardly an Imperial Stout, though. This beer is thick without being big on flavor. On top of that, there is very little carbonation, so it is like drinking sludge. Low marks for drinkability. I think I would have liked this beer more if it just had some bubbles, although it still wouldn't be an imperial stout.","beveragecaptain","Apr 22, 2005"

Somewhat thin, yet creamy up front; a massive espresso twang to it. Sweet tasting; dark chocolate noticeable; some caramel and warming coffee notes. Expecting more of a belly warming effect for the style; yet, this doe not disappoint; sticky molasses left on the palate.

The nose has some dark raisin/fig tones to it along with a bit of mocha as well. The flavor was not what I would expect; it was thin coffee, almost a bit watery and weak. The feel was also a bit thin as well with a hint of creamyness. Drinkability is just ok. Its a decent beer, but not really special.","kmpitz2","Jun 07, 2004"

Nose is dominated by roasted malts and grains with a touch of cocoa beans in the background. A bit thin in body for the style and this is paired with a minimal amount of carbonation. Taste begins with notes of dark fruits along with some unsweetened bakers chocolate. A touch of acidic coffee and bitter hops are present towards the end.

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Thanks to Darkover for hooking me up. Pours a deep dark black with a thin and quickly disappearing brown head. Slow, creeping carbonation up the sides of the glass and thin lacing. The aroma is bitter roasted coffee with a bit of malt. Not as rich as most Imperial Stouts, and not quite as flavorful either. There is a nice coffee flavor but not much malt to counterbalance. There is a small amount of chocolate in the flavor as well. The finish is roasted coffee. On the Stout scale this is pretty good but on the Imperial Stout scale it falls short. Still not a bad brew though.","Dogbrick","Beers"

Aroma is chocolate and roasted malt, with a heavy dose of espresso thrown in. For style this is pretty muted as an imperial stout, but I still find it very good and enjoyable. The taste has the roasted malt and coffee, but in a subdued way that makes it a very drinkable beer. Got to see what this thing is like after some more aging.","Indybeer","0"
3.75,-1.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured very black, with no light getting through it. It had a light tan bubbly head that left only trace lace as it subsided. The aroma was of malt, hops, chocolate and some coffee. A flavor of malt, hops and chocolate with some coffee elements. A bit lighter than most beers of this style with a slightly bitter finish.

Extra points for its unusual, but very pleasant smell.","DrunkMcDermott","Nov 20, 2003"
3.8,0,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Northwind Imperial Stout from Two Brothers in Chicago. Very thick and dark brew, light cannot penetrate it at all. The head was thick, toffee tan, but not particularly long lasting. The aroma is nice, somewhat chocolatety, with hints of coffee. The taste is nice, extremely malty. The dominant flavors are espresso, chocolate, and just a tiny bit of liquid soap, but that is not half as bad as it sounds. The body is light, perhaps too much so for the style. Not bad, worth sampling. Nowhere near as big as some of the other Imperials on the site.","jackndan","Sep 02, 2003"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Opaque with dark brown tints and the thinnest layer of cocoa-hued bubbles. Roasted chocolate malt, espresso, and nutty aromas persist. Coffee, chocolate, roasted nutty malt with an accompanying sweetness lend to a a mild, earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Finish is reminiscent more of a traditional Imperial Stout rather than some of the more extreme American versions. Body borders on medium-full, rather than simply full like some others. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and elegant with mellow carbonation that works well. Two Brothers makes a very drinkable Imperial Stout with this one, and while it is indeed good, it lacks a bit of character that keeps it from being truly great. A nice stout, nonetheless, and one I will revisit.","Jon","Mar 26, 2003"

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A rough pour brings up a full tan head over an opaque black body. When held to the light, reddish-mahogany highlights are visible at the base of the glass and just below the surface. The head drops fairly quickly; but it does maintain a thin surface covering and leaves some tight, spotty lace. Roasty notes dominate the aroma. It's quite black-coffee-ish with a decent amount of prune-like fruitiness thrown in, and even some sweetish dark chocolate. The moderate carbonation is very fine; and helps to boost the creamy character of its surprisingly only medium body. Rich flavor, however, is where this beer shines. It's loaded with notes of bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, dark fruit skins, black cherry, burnt ""late-night diner"" coffee, blackstrap molasses, and leafy hops. It finishes dry and bitter, but not overly long, with a residual coffee/chocolate roastiness. Well-balanced and nicely done. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Mar 13, 2003"

The flavor is very roasty, robust porter-like in a way, kind of sweet, with a nice bitterness coming through on the finish. I found some sourness on the finish as well, kind of annoying.
