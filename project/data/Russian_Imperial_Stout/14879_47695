4.12,-4.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"I get the faint smell of whiskey right off the bat. The pour looks like a nice dark stout but not too thick. Thin layer of tan head with darker brown gathering on the outsides, especially after a drink...nice color balance. Mouthfeel is a stout on the thin side which is welcome after having overly thick imperial stouts. Taste has nice full ""earthy"" flavor combining wood, nuts, and coffee with a finish of just a touch of whiskey. Easy to drink and very enjoyable.","ctjoumas","Feb 23, 2015"

I'm just glad I had the insight to pick up two! Love the big coffee and pitted fruits and how it meshes with the warm vanilla. The wet finishes is also really nice because I hate it when a BA beer dries out super fast so it can't linger on the palate. There could maybe me more oak but I still love this beer and that's a minor grip. Definitely a must try when in ohio!","BergBeer","Oct 14, 2014"

Good to see how it would be in a year or two. Body is syrupy.","JulioH","Jul 18, 2014"

Would also no doubt go well with a thick, juicy steak... no matter what you pair it with, make sure you save a little to have on its own. I think I'd prefer a bourbon barrel aging to a whiskey barrel aging, but either way, this is a must-try.","Alextricity","Jul 18, 2014"

Kind of pricey at $20 but I guess that is close to the going rate these days for this type of beer. Appearance was standard, super black, short head. Aroma was a bit of chocolate, a bit of whiskey and a bit of barrel, not bad at all. Flavor was pretty good imperial stout with nice touched of the whiskey barrel. My friend said it tasted like espresso. This was probably the best Hoppin Frog beer I've had so far and it did hit the spot for what I was craving.","ArrogantB","Jan 23, 2014"

I don't know how much time this spends in barrels, but it seems lighter in all the woody charcoal bourbon properties than so barrel aged stouts. the oatmeal is nice in this, gives it a richness of feel and a smooth texture, as well as a moderate sweetness that all really work well. as for the stout itself, its big and roasty, very minimal bitterness, milk chocolate notes, and a massive body. smoothed out and soft on the palate, even nicer as it warms. limited alcohol coming through, maybe the barrel helps that too. its a well refined product, not skewed one way or the other. hoppin frog has a number of delicious stouts, and while this one stands out to me a little less than some reviews suggest it should, its still superbly well done, and one that is probably still worth the roughly 18 dollar price tag.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

The bourbon isn't allowed to steal the show from the other worthy aspects of this beer, which is so often a problem in BA variants of already strong stouts.

Along the likes of Dragons Milk. Given the boozey nature, I can still drink an entire bomber no problem. A wonderful way to begin a session.","macher0","Dec 01, 2013"

Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, bourbon, oak, clove, toast, toffee, vanilla, coffee, oatmeal, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and great balance of roasted malt notes with barrel character; and big strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee, clove, toast, oatmeal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toast, clove, toffee, oatmeal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely incredible complexity and balance of roasted malt and barrel flavors; with an amazing barrel/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane barrel aged imperial stout with a couple years of age. All around amazing complexity and balance of roasted malt and barrel character flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A world class imperial stout offering for sure.","superspak","Sep 04, 2013"

Then bring on the oats . . . the mouth just shuts down and goes dryer than a desert. A wonderful complexity and very well balanced. No two flavors are stronger than the other.

Doesn't necessarily showcase all of its components as well as other beers do (BCBS, Black Note comes to mind) but the amount of bourbon flavour and aromas blows every other BA beer away. I don't always like having such strong bourbon presence in my beers- I would also like the sweet malts to show up even more here rather than being a supporting player. But I can't deny that this is a very good bourbon'ed up stout.. I was lucky to get it for $10 a bomber, so I'm not sure I'd pay full price ($16-19) to drink more once my stash is gone.

With all the focus going to a certain well deserved Am Double Stout this time of year this thing was kind of just sitting there on tap getting no attention. Well, I'll tell you now, this thing will grab your attention and blow you away with its all business style. It has the quality to stand beside anything in the world. I've never had the standard Boris, but the barrel aged version is top shelf. I think they use Heaven Hill barrels. I'd like to know which specific bourbon was in those barrels. Regardless I'll buy this again if it's available. A fantastic experience. A fantastic stout.","BradtheGreat7","Apr 09, 2013"

The flavor is sweet with a roasty earthy edge. some chocolate but more roast and coffee coming through with a solid shot of bourbon flavor. Light vanilla and wood with a smattering of dark fruits to round it all out. Medium to thick body with a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. Wow this is a damn fine brew! The barrel thins the body a bit which I like because the regular version is thick and sticky. Very Nice brew.","johnnnniee","Mar 23, 2013"

This one had a much better aroma but I feel like the bourbon overpowers the really delicious base beer a little too much.

There wasn't much in the way of lacing on the glass at all on this beer. The smell of it had some bit roasted notes along with a powerful whiskey aroma from the barrels they used. The taste of the beer packs a punch of heavy sweet roasted grains mixed with a whiskey essence to add a little depth. It's smokey at some levels as well as bitter too. It's got a lot of good qualities when it comes to the flavor of it. The mouthfeel is really good, it's exactly how it should be. It's thick, oily, and lightly caronated. Overall it's a big beer to take down but I found it to be very enjoyable.","Knapp85","Jan 29, 2013"

From the moment you open the bottle the nostrils flood from across the room with wood, butter, roasty malts, char, and vanilla. It remains very simple, but hits all the necessary points, and hits them hard. The flavoring follows nicely, with the same qualities of the aromatics, plus a hearty warming of the soul. The feel is nice as well, with a good deal of stickiness and oily slickness. This is an excellent beer, and a serious improvement on the standard B.O.R.I.S.","TheBrewo","0"

3.88,-9.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Barrel Aged BORIS pours jet black, with about two fingers of mousse-like milk chocolate foam capping the beer. Head retention is decent, and some nice rings of lacing are left around the inside of the glass. The nose has an intense, roasty dark chocolate note, paired with a spicy whiskey aroma. It's nice, but there's not much to it. The flavor profile expands on this basic outline some. Intense dark chocolate opens things up, but here it's underlined with a hint of vanilla sweetness. The back end is still a lightly hot whiskey note, but now there's a subtle oaky component to it as well. The vanilla and oak are minor additions, but add some needed depth to the beer. The body has that signature silkiness I tend to get from oatmeal stouts, but I found myself wishing it was more rich and chewy. The carbonation does a nice job of staying in the background though, just enough there to keep the beer clear of becoming syrupy. Barrel Aged BORIS was my first Hoppin' Frog beer, and while I wasn't blown away, it proved to be a very solid stout. I'd definitely check out another beer from them in the future.","axeman9182","Aug 25, 2012"

Very powerful beer - it is far more like a chocolate liquor with a whiskey shot than a RIS in a bourbon barrel. But maybe that's the point of this beer. I think though that this beer is way too extreme and not enough beer - that the stout got lost in it all. I like it, and I enjoyed it, but it's not a great RIS. Mouthfeel is impressive (oatmeal does it's job here) and the smell and taste are good, but it's still more like a mixed drink and less like a beer. So I'm giving it a 4.0 for being good, but I cannot see myself buying this again. If I want a Russian Imperial Stout I think I want something where the beer comes out more. This unfortunately, has moved too far into the realm of very tasty malt beverage/dessert and so I cannot rate it higher.

4.25,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I think its batch 4 (Black Cap). Poured from bottle into flute. Pours a pitch black color, a bit of deep brow/tan head and some lacing. Smells of very roasted malts, a bit of coffee, and a small amount of sweet milky sugars. Taste is really nice...roasted woody malts, a tad of chocolate with some hidden boozey vanilla and oaky notes on the finish. Really nice RIS, surprisingly nice since I wasnt a fan of other Hoppin Frog brews. Worth a try, but it is a bit pricey at around $20 bottle.","DrinkSlurm","Jun 03, 2012"

4.32,0.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this one up from a trade while in Denver. An aggressive pour yields only a one finger dark tan head that fades really quickly with minimal lacing. Lots of booze and bourbon in the nose initially, but it's quickly overpowered by wonderful dark, roasty chocolate, wood, and vanilla. The taste follows suit with loads of cocoa, espresso, and bourbon with hints of oak, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and a touch of soy sauce and licorice. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and oily but super smooth. There's a subtle alcohol warming throughout that is absolutely perfect and doesn't hurt the drinkability at all. This is my first taste of Hoppin' Frog, but hopefully not my last. A great beer!","beerdrifter","Apr 26, 2012"

Taste is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, slight coffee, and rich bittersweet chocolate squares. There is also a wood and vanilla taste as the beer warms. A nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

4.39,2.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall - If you're a fan of subtler Bourbon barrel aging in beers, this one might turn you off a bit. I think it's pretty darn amazing. And it's not too overpowering, but it is nice and prominent. I don't know what it is about those Bourbon barrels, but I love my stouts to be aged in them. I'm honestly not even much of a Bourbon drinker, but I love the aroma of straight Bourbon and what the barrels can do to some good beer. I've heard or seen a few people compare this to BCBS, so I'm quietly looking forward to trying that as I've gotten some recently from some very generous people.

Each sip seems better than the last with mild hops adding dimension and the bitter coffee tinge seeming to blend effortlessly with the bourbon and cocoa flavors -a great taste indeed.

The bourbon and barrel presence is very up-front but the intensity is more reserved compared to most bourbon barrel-aged stouts (Goose Island Bourbon County stout comes to mind) - the underlying stout shines through spectacularly.

I also gets hints of cherry, molasses and vanilla. The bourbon is not overpowering in the least which is great. The whiskey is quite prominent in the taste along with the sweet graininess of the oatmeal. Dark raisiny chocolate is also strong. Carbonation is nicely toned down with barely a hint of alcohol warmth. One of the fewer barrel aged stouts I had and it doesn't fail to impress. Not quite up to KBS and BCS standards but it is getting very close.","generalnotsew","Jun 02, 2011"

The aromas are of sweet milk chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, with a soft sweet bourbon, vanilla finish. The bourbon is exceptionally well played at this point in it's aging. It actually smells very, very similar to KBS at this point. The flavor gets even better. It boasts both sweet and bitter chocolates, lightly roasted coffee, light oak, a touch of vanilla and a perfectly well rounded and soft bourbon note to finish. This beer is near perfect. I really can't believe how well blended everything is and how well the chocolate, coffee, and bourbon intermingle. It is exceptionally smooth and doesn't overly stick to the palate, yet leaves you with a touch of chocolate, rye, and light bourbon. This beer was near perfect! I highly recommend trying this one aged.","aasher","May 30, 2011"

3.68,-14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The tastes begin with a lot of oak and bourbon, which is upsetting and surprising especially after more than 2 years in the bottle. Still delicious don't get me wrong. Copious amounts of dark bittersweet chocolate coats the palate, slick but not at all sweet or cloying at all. This is a serious beer that really could have aged for 2+ more years. Mouthfeel is thick thick and full with adequate carbonation for the style. The alcohol flavors really dry this one out leaving the mouthfeel full again yet dry and lip smacking. Overall, I am divided on this beer. I do not believe you should have to age a beer for more than 2 years to reach it peak but this one could use 4 to be amazing... I will let you be the judge, maybe it is just the vintage but this beer is way too bourbon and oak focused. Personally I have no intention of revisiting anytime soon because of the intense alcohol contribution to the overall enjoyment and flavor profile.","claspada","Beers"

The stout appears a nearly pitch black color with a healthy two fingers of creamy tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of deep roasted grains, both dark and bittersweet chocolates at varying degrees of intensity, raisins, prunes, a good amount of sweetness, almost too much at times. I recall reading that this particular batch only spent a few (3-4?) months in the barrels and it shows. Bourbon notes are mild, but certainly present. This one is quite viscous with medium carbonation. The bubbles help to cut through the richness. This is, without a doubt, a sipper for sure. Glad I got into it while it's still chilly out.

Nice, but this is one that would probably benefit from a little aging. Not because it's harsh or hot, but because the Bourbon could use some more integration with the rest of the beer. As it is it's a little dominant. Pours black and viscous- like a light weight motor oil. Little head, and what there is fades completely in a short while. Lots of whiskey in the mose as well as a silky oatmeal stout aroma with a light roastiness and some bitter chocolate notes. Aside from the smooth stout flavors, and the whiskey, there is a particularly nice aftertaste of dark chocolate that is accented by the whiskey. Very smooth, and both the smoothness and the aftertaste of chocolate are empasized by allowing the beer to open upo for awhile, while the whiskey is brought a little more under control.

There is a nice undertone of charred wood, though. It pours a nice oily opaque sable with a rather thick and fine-bubbled, if not too persistent, chocolaty tan head. Flavor has tones of molasses, quality roast coffee, unsweet chocolate and licorice, with a strong and almost overwhelming overtone of whisky - good whisky, but that tone could be a wee bit more subtle.

I'd like to see SOME foam on the beer, it doesn't need a bunch, just a little. Smell is decent, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, a bit of oak in there too. Taste follows suit, some creamy vanilla and oak from the aging, but follows through with a robust and lingering roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso profile. Quite delicious, especially after I let it warm a bit. The aging doesn't really add all that much to this beer, in my opinion. In fact, the underlying stout is the best part. I haven't had regular BORIS, but I bet it's a better value. Thick and smooth on the feel, big stout territory for sure. Very low carbonation, for some reason now I'm thinking the feel is similar to GI BCBS, though it's been a couple of months since I've had one. Good drinkability, a sipper for sure.

As I was digging through the cellar for something to try I saw the BA B.O.R.I.S. and decided it was due to time to open it. Right in line with the robust, regular B.O.R.I.S. it pours black as night, no light getting through this beer, it even looks thick! A gorgeous dense, tan head rests atop... a head this dense, of course, leaves tons of lacing on the glass as you sip & enjoy the beer. The aroma is a nicely balanced cornucopia of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, whiskey, and a bit of alcohol esters. Unlike some BA stouts, the barrel aging seems to be right on here, and does not overtake the aroma. The flavor is an even more pronounced version of the aroma, the roasted malts are right alongside coffee flavors, but along with a rich, delicious chocolate characteristic. Again in the flavor, the vanilla & whiskey hints from the oak barrel are there to accompany the beer, not overtake, but it does have a bit of an alcoholic heat to it. Mouthfeel is everything I want in a big stout, rich, velvety, and creamy, just perfect. I must give credit to Hoppin' Frog on this beer, with so many BA beers hitting the market these days, this one is definitely a stand-out that uses the barrel aging process to add complexity to an already outstanding beer, not overtake it.","bhalter8","0"
4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Although there has been a heat wave around these parts for the last three weeks or so, for some reason a big stout was what I was in the mood for tonight. Barrel Aged Boris pours out a pitch black color, with some brown/red hues at the bottom, and just barely one finger of brown heading that fades away quickly. Prunes and dark chocolate become apparent early on in the nose, followed by some dark fruit and whiskey. Fudge comes to mind immediately upon sipping, with lots of jammy fruit, and the whiskey ending things on a somewhat bitter, boozy note. No doubt that this is a really big, rich beer that seems to only become more so as it warms to room temperature. The last time I tried this beer, which was probably a year or so ago, it was really hot, and although things have calmed down a bit with the alcohol, it is still one where the whiskey and heat are part of the overall picture. This one works perfectly as a sipper. Overall the barrel aging adds a nice component here, though the non barreled version is nothing to turn your nose to. If anything the whiskey barrels steal the show here whereas the oatmeal is more center stage with the original. Cheers","jamie2dope","Jul 25, 2010"

Molten fudge, rum soaked raisin, molasses, cocoa, freshly roasted coffee and a fairly heavy handed hop dosage that struggles to get through. As the beer warms slightly, the flavors grow more complex with mascerated dark fruity and nutty flavors blending perfectly with toasted oak.

No fruit comes out in the flavor profile; however, a hint of vanilla also reveals itselft, with a little bit of licorice lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in consistency and silky without being oily; carbonation is subtle and light. Not a big bold BA RIS, but excellent balance, with a well-hidden abv.

Scents of wine grapes, bourbon, oak, and tobacco fill my nose. Flavors of waxy and estery fruits are upfront along with a generous amount of wine grapes, toffee, and bourbon. The barrel aging has really ramped up the dark fruits in this brew to a shocking degree. The finish has tobacco, herbal notes, coconut, and a biscuit and cookie kick. I even get a little bit of pumpkin seed to it. Tasty stuff, though the barrel seems to have ramped up the fruity and herbal elements and hidden a lot of the earthy and roasty balance present in the original, leaving a winelike finish.

The sweetly alternating vanilla and chocolate elements are perfectly intertwined, with little to no alcohol perceived. The finish is long, with lingering chocolate notes that segue into tobacco and dry oak. The true marvel of this beer is its impossibly smooth and silky body. Oatmeal is truly amazing in this respect, it's just something you want to hold on your palate for as long as you can, and just feel the silk sheet wrap around you.

Not as much pure bourbon as GI BCS, but more than enough to please those who store a low-ball next to their pint glasses. The sweetness does not become overpowering as it's balanced nicely by the requisite mocha flavors: chocolate and dark roast coffee. However, what's nice about this RIS is that it's not all about the bourbon or char. There is a complex array of deep fruit notes here: Black currants, plum and fig. To give you an idea of how this all blends, think bourbon-aged, milk-chocolate raisenettes. The alcohol could use just a bit of taming and keeps this from being as drinkable as some other offerings in the style. Just a year or two of aging could turn this impressive offering into one of the leaders of the impy pack.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 28, 2009"

It was very thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a fantastic beer with lots of bold and intricate flavors, all delicately balanced together. It had great body, and hid the alcohol pretty well, so it was very easy to drink. Of course, you would have to enjoy bourbon and oak flavors to really enjoy this beer.

Warming, but not as much as the aroma would suggest. Thick and full bodied. Finish is lingering toffee sweetness and oak barrel. The only thing I would say this could use is some more bittering of coffee and hops. I expect barrel aging to negate some of that anyways though. Good drinkability for the ""size"".

Taste is similar to the aroma, however the oak and bourbon flavors are stronger than the aroma would indicate. Also, all of the flavors mesh well together. No one flavor overpowers the others. There's also a nice slight bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy, a bit slick and has low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and extremely easy to drink. It's probably meant to be a sipping beer, but I had problems just sipping it because I liked it so much. I think this is an excellent beer.
