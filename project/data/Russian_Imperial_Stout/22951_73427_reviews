"This stout is very good. Really enjoyed drinking this imperial Russian stout."

"smoky roasted malt. Excellent beer- especially for Beer Geeks who savor their RIS."
"Maybe I love Russian Imperial Stout's too much, but this is just fantastic. Balanced flavor, all the stout regulars, but no one sticking out. Just a marvelous beer."
"Deep black in color. Poured with huge, dense, dark beige foam with excellent retention. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and dark fig and prune aromas with a definitive booziness. Light medicinal phenolics toward the end. Medium-full bodied with medium light carbonation and a lightly boozy heatness. Roasted malts and chocolate flavors with phenolic notes and astringency that push the drinkability limits. Lots of better RISs out there."

"Appearance: Deep black, 2” foam cap, thick lace. Smell: the hops hit first on the nose, then malt and then some cocoa and roast.  Taste: rich, fruity, espresso, fruity, some faint tobacco, alcohol on the finish  Some dark chocolate notes and the bitterness is more dark bitter chocolate than roast.  Mouthfeel: very creamy, chewy, medium low carbonation"
"Enjoy"

"T: Warm chocolate malt. Brazen leather. Has some spiciness to it; not alcohol derived, has a sandalwood flavor. Hints of licorice and roasted coffee grounds. Nice hop brightness that leaves a lingering grapefruit bitterness."

"Pours pitch black with very little carbonation, if any. The aromas in this one are nice. Big malts,, raisin, ash, hops and slight alcohol presence. Same goes through in the taste. Malts hit big in this one with notes of deep dark roasted coffee beans, deep dark chocolate and deep dark malts. This is a deep dark beer befitting of its fantastic name and label. The alcohol is hidden well in this one but it will creep up on you. Don't underestimate the Blaecorn Unidragon."
"Poured into a snifter.  Pitch black with a small head.  Smell is classic RIS:  Chocolate and coffee.  Smooth; not overly carbonated.  Taste includes raisins and licorice.  Complex malts.  I really like Extremely angry beast, of which Blaecorn Unidragon is a component, so I thought that BU itself might suffer by comparison.  However, it didn't disappoint."
""
""
""
"Way too smokey. Tastes like someone extinguished a cigar in a decent stout."
"O: Extremely thick and decadent. This definitely hits the spot of you are in the mood for a solid, heavy, imperial stout. Well done."
""
"Overall: It's not something I'd buy again, despite the awesome label art. It just doesn't work for me. It's like some cross between a brett beer and a RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow I love the smell of this beer! Make a candle of this!!!"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a good Imperial Stout.  Good flavors of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and dark molasses.  Definitely worth a drink."

"2011 bottling date. This beer holds up incredibly after 3 years. Rich and roasty, chocolatey notes completely coat my palate, with some smoke in the background. The alcohol is just barely noticeable. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, thick and chewy. This beer made quite an impression on me, but now I need to find a fresh bottle."
""
"Great stuff, thanks Alex! Would love to try this after being in a barrel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: for the genre, a very good Russian Imperial Stout with great balance of flavors; and a pleasant change from the malt dominant beers typically associated with RIS. I wouldn't consider myself a hophead, but I did rather enjoy this beer, loved the art work and I look forward to trying other beers from Clown Shoes"

"Bottled 11/19/13. Pours oil black with a finger of tan head. Smells of dark fruits, smoke, and some coffee. Taste is of dark fruits, chocolate, a bit of coffee. Just a little bitterness and some heat. Smokiness plays well in this brew. I wanna say this has some spicyness to it but I'm positive it doesn't have chilies in it. As it warms up the bitterness settles down and the bold flavors really come through. Mouthfeel is a nice mix of wet and dry. It's not overly thick but at the same time you're gonna want to drink this over a long period of time. I poured about 5oz and have been drinking it over the past hour or so. Overall a pretty damn good RIS. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it but Clown Shoes is doing great things."

"O = I like it.  But this is a beer with a time and a place.  This would be a great beer to have after coming in from shoveling snow in the afternoon.  A great apres-ski beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If there was such a thing as an imperial black ipa, this would be it. At room temperature it was unpleasant to drink. The bitter plus smokiness was a real turnoff. I know imperial stouts are better towards room temperature, but maybe this could have been better cool. And I also think this beer would be best with a little age to it. I can't say don't ever try this. But if you do, please age this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Rather a disappointment as this beer is all over the map but fails to deliver the style it intends; there is no malty complexity, no subtle dark fruit and the mouthfeel is too thin; way too much of an ashy taste; even if this were marketed as an American Double Stout I would not be a fan"

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a brown-to-black, with a sandy tan head, foamy, fluffy, and light, with a slow carbonation flow throughout. The aromas are boozy forward, with a heavy handed dose of hops bitterness, roasted coffee notes, cocoa nibs, woody notes, and earthy tones. Very dry and bitter on the nose. Flavors are dry and roasted forward, with a blast of booze, followed by coffee bitters, bittersweet cocoa nibs, subtle cream notes, earthy tones, and a boozy undertone that solidifies everything on the palate. Powerful brew. The body is robust and huge, but dry throughout. There is no sneaking through this beer. Big, all the way around. The finish is dry, but with solid, strong lingering characteristics of dry, bitter, and roast qualities. This is a big ass beer, and damn tasty!"

"O: Very tasty and complex, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, extremely well-disguised very strong kick, very good representation of style. I will disclose that I did not have this beer fresh to draw a comparison. However, at nearly 3-years-old, it does not show any adverse effects of aging at all and shows all of the signs that make this beer one you can age for several more years, if you choose. But drinking it now regardless of age isn’t a bad idea either."
""
"Poured nice and dark, decent lacy though i've seen better.  IMO it seemed a little hot, especially for a non-BA beer, though admittedly it only had 5 months on it. I might let it go another 7 at least and try again.  Pretty decent for a shelf-beer, but nothing I'd miss if I cant find it again."

"A pleasantly rendered in its restrained, over the top manner version of the style - the suspected interlopers kept mostly in check.  More drinkable than anything 25-proof and this large has any right to be, but that comes with the caveat of being a fan of big-ass stouts in the first place.  Worthy of seeking out for, well, the sudden change of seasons on a holiday Monday is a good enough reason for this (non) camper."

"Final Thoughts: This one basically met my expectations. Would have liked to taste a little vanilla or perhaps an oaken-aged version just to spruce it up a bit. The flavor is consistent with many other well known stouts of the style. Definitely a well done beer but nothing special. Would I drink it again? Maybe if it was on nitro-tap."

"Pours tar black, can't find any other color in it and I like that. Has a nice thick tan head. Smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, and a hint of dark ripe fruits reminiscent of fig. Initial sip reveals a pretty complex brew that doesn't have as much of the distinct chocolate or coffee flavors that the nose suggests. A plum/prune fruitiness is up front and the long lingering aftertaste is where the bitter dark chocolate, burnt caramel, and coffee comes into play. Thick rich mouthfeel that feels pretty good leaves me wanting more. High quality RIS, my first clown shoes experience has been a good one."
""
"Overall: Good tasting imperial stout. Lots of flavors for your tongue to unmask. Enjoyable if you enjoy dark, chocolately/coffee stouts."
""
""
"O: This a nice, big RIS that is aging well, and will probably benefit from more time still. The alcohol is still pretty strong, and more dark fruit/port flavors are just beginning to emerge. I'll definitely pick up more to put away for awhile."
""

""
""

"Another big beer that Clown Shoes hits out of the park!"
""
""
""
""
"Great aroma of coffee/roasty notes, licorice, bakers chocolate mixed in there as well as a vanilla/sweet aroma that I can't put my finger on. Then when I took a drink it was like pow in the face with a smokey flavor I didn't really get on the nose. The smokey notes fade to chocolate and bitter coffee. The flavor is moslty dark roasty malts and lingering bitterness, so if you are looking for a more chocolate or sweet RIS I would pass on this. This body isn't very thick but the flavors sit on the palate for awhile. I keep smacking my lips and the beer just lingers which I am digging. The more I drink it the more impressed I get with it. When I first started it was like a low 4 now it's a solid 4.25. Might have pick on up to age."
"Opaque brown/black in nature stout that has a decent foamy tan head with minimal lacing. Smells of mostly roasted malts with nibs of chocolate and some coffee mixed in too. Tastes of bitter chocolate, dark brewed coffee, and roast. Smooth, and silky mouthfeel that finishes with a slight alcohol burn. Clown Shoes has produced another high quality stout that I have enjoyed greatly. Overall, not as good as Undead Party Crasher, but Blaecorn Unidragon holds it's own and I would try this one again."

"O: Both very good and somewhat different imperial stouts. I think BU would become a significant winner with some age to mellow it out a bit."
""
""
"Overall, this is exactly what a stout should be. I can't even imagine a better stout. Despite a whopping 12.5% ABV, the alcohol is barely noticeable in comparison to a mind-blowingly awesome flavor. Anybody who gets a chance to try this should absolutely pick up a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad I got to try this mystical creature. Clown Shoes always seems to please. A seductive, ""hook you with its horn"" stout."
""
""
""
""
"Bottled 10/11"
""
""
""
"A very nice stout which is more hoppy than is usual for this style, but it works well. Flavors and aromas are good, goes down very easy. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty solid RIS offering that can easily compete with the big boys out there - I wish it had a creamier texture and that the coffee in both the aroma and taste was less pronounced but being a coffee lover it only takes a couple of sips to get used to and love this. I have not tried the other Clown Shoe IS offerings but have most of them in my cellar and am really excited to try them soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This was miles away from what I was expecting. Maybe my bottle was stored poorly over the last 15 months, and therefore has morphed into a different beast, but I actually like this a lot!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It doesn't feel as heavy as one might think, I would put this at a 'medium.' Overall, the two dominant aspects to this beverage are balanced nicely. It's a little more sweet and malty than smoky, and that's the way it should be. An absolute pleasure for me to recommend to other RIS fans for sure!"
""
""
"All-in-all, it's a tough call for this one. I can't recommend cellaring it just because it's already got a fairly mild flavor, but who knows, maybe it'd be a good idea (bottle recommends it). The nose on this brew had me very excited, but the flavor just left me a bit more than content. Roast, coffee, smoke, and a bit of earthy hoppiness. I like hoppiness in a black ale (strangely enough), but I never seem to love it in Imperial Stouts. I suppose I'd say... try this one for yourself and decide. It looks phenomenal, it smells fantastic, and has a great feel... but the taste has me wanting something more."

"It was a very good beer what can I say? The taste was good but not the best. There is a bit of an after taste that kinda bugs me a bit and when I drank it it was a bit foamy. It didn't take much for it to hit me which I like. It would take at least 9 beers for it to hit me halfway through this bottle. As you can see I'm not a beer master or anything but this beer was really good."
"O: Fantastic RIS. It hits all the right marks for the style and drinks like a 12.5% beer should. for a 12.5% beer the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good solid and ris. Really surprised by the roasted smoked flavor, and also the amount of hops and bitter coffee flavor. The coffee/expresso bitter flavor left on the tongue is a odd flavor, and a turnoff to me honestly. Still, I can drink this and enjoy it but its not my favorite ris."

"Another great Clown Shoes stout, I want more people to know how great they are."
""
""
""
"O. A very nice coffee/dark chocolate forward stout. This certainly has its place. Nicely crafted. I'm glad I was able to drink one with a little age. The upside is the carbonation level and coffee bitterness. The downside is the nose and standard appearance."
"I liked Vampire Slayer better, but Blaecorn is a solid R.I.S. Recommended."

"I've had this fresh a few times, and those experiences are why I stuck this in the back of a closet and forgot about it. Fresh, it's overly hoppy and overly sweet. It's kind of a hot mess, really. After two years, this beer has become not only something worth drinking, but something to buy again (and age again). This was an experiment with unexpectedly nice results."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Imp Stout. Not as complex as many offerings, but quite solid. Very impressed that it didn't go the over sweet route that many modern RIS's seem to go nowadays."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/6/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, smoke, coffee, light char, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and compexity of dark/roasted malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; with a nice malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""

"For most people, paying $11 (or more) for a bottle of beer - even a bomber - is a hard purchase to justify; I could defend buying Blaecorn Unidragon at almost any price. This beer (a combo of 'Black Unicorn' and 'Soul Dragon') is a rare mythical creature indeed: rich and roasty, yet easily and endlessly drinkable. The label may look like Charlie Day's famous t-shirt but this is a beer to be taken very seriously."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of the style, while the roasted aspects weren't as deep and roasty as some other beers in the style, it still had some nice complexity and I thought it was fairly unique. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth for what it was, a little warming, filling, rich, and the tastedid a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, I'm pretty sure I could take out the full bomber, but I might regret that decision later. It made for a good beer to have on a cold night. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and complexity, I thought those two aspects stood out as being pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the heavy smokey aspect, if it was toned down a little it would let more of roasted notes through. I don't know if I would get this beer again, but I might get one for aging to see how it changes overtime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong and smokey stouts. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I thought this was just as smokey as Porcine, maybe even a little more and I thought the barrel aspect worked very well with Porcine so I prefer Porcine Unidragon, but I thought this was still a good beer and a nice platform to build on, but I wasn't expecting it to be as smokey as it it was. Good job guys, keep up the solid work."

"This one's been sitting around for a bit and figured it was time to give it a shot. Always look forward to a new Clown Shoes brew. Pours pitch black with a slight, dark tan head. Smells of burnt wood, caramel, black licorice and dark chocolate. Creamy as fuck with milk chocolate and earthy hops. Medium bodied and heats up the gullet just fine. Brilliant start to my Imperial Stout season."
"O: This is a big and strong beer but it is still pretty easy to enjoy - the alcohol is fairly well hidden but this is definitely a sipping beer. Hope that grabbing a Massachusetts brew will help out my New England Patriots beat Carolina here on Monday night :)"
""
"Syrupy pour. Light head. You can definitely taste the bourbon barrel. I drank the whole 1.6 with some BBQ beef ribs. Perfect combo. Yes glazed BBQ beef on the grill perfection with a rich beer like this... I can feel my gout calling. Nice calm buzz to. I just drank it. 12.5 I think. Yum I can feel that flow in my blood. Good times! I need a hammock."

"Overall I think this is a winner. The 12.5% was hardly noticeable during the session but did catch up with me at the end. This is my first venture into the Clown Shoes family and with more offerings like this….I might not be afraid of clowns anymore. Naaaah."

"My 100th review! And it wasn't wasted... this is a terrific beer! I had been sitting on this one for about 7 months, and it was worth the wait. Pour absolutely pitch black; very little color even when held to light. Khaki head that diminished quickly. Great smell, and pretty spot on for what you would expect from an RIS: lots of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee but with more hops than most. Flavor has about the same profile, but more coffee comes through. Not overly sweet, and still pretty hoppy for a stout. Just a touch of alcohol, but you would never suspect it was pushing almost 13%. Mouth feel is great, full and smooth, not thick and sticky, mild carbonation brings some of the lighter flavors to life. Overall, excellent, and worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like big Russian Imperials since they are usually sweeter than the American style. This one lived up to my expectations, nice sweet chocolate flavor and not boozy despite its strength. I might have to try some of CS's other big stouts."

"A very tasty imperial Russian stout, rich in chocolate flavors and nicely balancing the malt sweetness with just the right edge of bitterness. This all does an excellent job of putting the high ABV in the background and allowing the core beer ingredients to dance about joyfully in your mouth."

"Out of the five Clown Shoes beers that were sampled this night, Blaecorn Unidragon was by far my favorite of the bunch. Sifting through reviews, I can see that it seems like many people aren't on board with copious amounts of burnt and roasty flavors, but I love it. I'll admit that this beer would be hard to drink in large amounts, both due to the intensity of the flavors as well as the ABV, but it's definitely a nice, cheap RIS to sit back and sip on a cold day."
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: A solid RIS, just not great/outstanding. Not chewy enough for me as I like my RISs to be big bold mothers. Flavours were good and I liked the bitter Earthy hop bite on the aftertaste that lingered. I'd have this one again."

"O: Pretty meh, not terrible but below avg for a ten dollar bottle RIS. Stone's IRS blows this out of the water for example and is only ~$6 a bottle here. Slightly disjointed, thin body and the flavors are muted except in the sweet/overly bitter areas. also off put by the piney aromas for an Imperial stout. Wouldn't buy again, nor would i recommend it. However not the worst RIS out there, and if you're a Clown Shoes fan boy I would imagine you would check it out."

"O/D - Definitely a tasty Imperial Stout. Lot's of great chocolate dominance, but more subtle notes in the backgroud. Complex and tasty. Split the bottle so the high ABV wasn't too difficult. Couldn't taste the alcohol. A good one."
""
""
""
""
"O: As it warmed up it got better, but this could have used some time to age to mellow out the alcohol harshness and the green apple (Acetaldehyde)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goddamn that was good. I need one for the cellar... I need 100 for the cellar. I jest, or do I???"
"O: Overall, a very nice beer. Again the components of this one arent my favorite characteristics in an Imperial Stout, but the flavor profile is huge, with good complexity. Clown Shoes really does a great job with their line up of Imperial Stouts. Its not my favorite of the bunch, but I would definitely drink this one again."
"O: I love this Russian. I personally think it's a great example of what the style can be. This is not a timid or apologetic beer. DO NOT use this for calibration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - I've heard stories about the ""harshness"" of this beer and I feel it's correct. I let this sit for a year or more, and I can tell how harsh it must be fresh. Not my favorite flavor in a stout thats for sure. If you like black licorice, this is your thin. Just be sure to sit on it for about a year or so."
"O: This beer has nothing incredibly innovative to offer the stout community, and that’s what I like about it: no absurd hops, no bourbon barrel, no coffee, no frills. It’s beer! Dark, intense, balanced beer! Drink it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first from Clown Shoes and I'm interested in trying a few more of their offerings."
""
"This one smells quite hoppy for a stout, but has roasted malt aromas apparent as well. medium low carbonation but nothing stellar for mouth feel. tastes just like it smells, again hop flavors apparent for a stout, then roast malts assalt the palate! with hints of coffee in the initial aftertaste. boozyness not apparent (12.5%!) very well balance r.i.s. between the roast malts and hops, with no added flavors (bourbon, chocolate, ect.) another good one worth trying from Clown Shoes."

"First thing you'll notice when opening up this beer is the aroma. It has a wonderfully deep earthy and almost flowery smell. The color is deep and with a good pour you won't get much of a head. It appeared as though it would be extremely thick; however, first taste reveals it's lighter playful side. As you drink it it has obvious characteristics of coffee, oak, and roasted malts with lighter hints of chocolate, molasses, and even maple syrup. The hoppy after taste is not too unpleasant and encourages the next sip. Very enjoyable beer!"
"Deep brown-black with a thinnish mocha brown head, leaves fits of lace. Smells of roasted malt, fig newtons, molasses and dark chocolate. Taste is lightly sweet..molasses, figs, dark chocolate..balanced against deeply roast-charred malt and bitter citrus pithy hop. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is velvety, medium bodied, nice carbonation pricks the tongue and stirs up,the taste buds. Roasty char finish keeps the palate honest and not cloying. Very good, a big imperial stout. Clown Shoes knows their Stouts, I have yet to be disappointed."

"While drinking Blaecorn I'd said that the lack of head retention may have dumbed down the nose, thus taste. I liked that the consistency was as thin as it was, as that is more true to the stout style (more robust, not necessarily heavier), but I would have PREFERRED this to be a little thicker."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer was very good, an excellent example of a bold Imperial stout without being brash or over the top. The sweetness on the nose was amazing and when the taste was about to get cloyingly sweet, burnt malts and bitter hops balanced the palate out and left you wanting more. For almost 13% abv, this beer drank well and wasnt overbearing. If only the body had the substance of say a Ten Fidy or Peche Mortel it would easily be in my top 5 of all time."

"Jet black colour, one finger of tan head, some lace as well. Smell is roasty with lots of dark chocolate, mild coffee, leafy hop presence, a little bit of black liquorice as well, bit of alcohol heat as well. Taste is roasty with dark chocolate, malty, fair bit of bitterness, coffee and a bit of smoke, roasty and coffee aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, medium body, decent feel. Not bad but a bit average, alcohol goes largely undetected but creeps up on you though, decent but unremarkable."
"O: Fun beer, the label reminded me of a Magic card, which was an impetus among many factors for me buying this one. This is a good beer, the $11 bomber price is too high, but makes me want to try other Clown Shoes beer. Glad to have another brewer in the Southland."
"The beer pours like dark roast coffee with a light khaki head that doesn’t fade but isn’t impressive, as might be expected for this big of a beer. The beer is black but it has some lovely dark brown notes to it. The beer’s body is also too dark to see through. The beer’s lacing is light to non-existent with only a couple slippery dots. On the nose, the beer smells boozy and sweet with touches of char and chocolate. There is the faintest touch of raisin dark fruit in the nose as well. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and oddly salty with a big wash of char and burn. The beer begins big salty, like surprisingly salty. The salt builds as the semi-sweet chocolaty malt moves in with a touch of cloying booze and is then eaten up as the roast moves in with big charred flavors that linger in the mouth. The salt and booze fade away and the finish is charred with the booze burning on the back of the throat. The aftertaste rings with char, too. On the mouth, the beer feels heavy in body with a slight creamy feel from the carbonation with a slight syrupiness. The carbonation gives a little prickle but also cradles the tongue nicely. The mouth is left charred, and dry from the roast with a light stickiness on the tongue. Overall, this is a great big Russian Imperial Stout. The flavors are big and the alcohol, while present, is nicely presented. This beer is tasty and could only blossom in a barrel (side note: I’ve had Porcine Unidragon, which is a barrel aged version of this mixed with Vampire Slayer, but I want just this to be in the barrel). Try this beer!"

"A decent impy stout. A little rough around the edges at first, but as it warms and opens up, some really nice chocolate flavors come forth. I would love to try the barrel aged version."
""
"O: A well balanced 12.5% Imperial stout that doesn't hurt the budget and it taste better than the popular once in a blue moon stouts. At a price less then $10 for a bomber this is a must have."
""
"O: Solid. Recently purchased (as a gift, so I didn't buy it), I can't help but wonder what it was like a year ago. As it is now, it's a good RIS, but not world-class."

"Medium bodied with light carbonation. There is a cocoa and dark roasted malt aftertaste. Not bad overall, nothing special either.It would be nice if the alcohol was better disguised. I should have aged this one a while before drinking it. I may need to try this again sometime."

"I enjoyed it, however, and would cautiously recommend this brew to Russian Imperial Stout lovers who have a designated driver or are enjoying it at home."
"O - An excellent russian imperial stout. Well balanced with lots of complexity."
"A good RIS, but could be better blended with all flavors involved.. Recommended, I wish I knew what this one cost for a $/oz value.."
""
""
"This beer has a very nice viscosity and as it warms up more and more flavor comes out. Its really smooth and creamy despite the lack of head. I was very impressed with this offering from clown shoes and will definitely be enjoying this beer as a staple imperial stout."
"D - An interesting Russian Imperial Stout... The 12.5% ABV is extremely well hidden and sneaks up on you bit... Walks the fine line between very good and excellent, but ultimately falls on the very good side of the equation - which still makes this a terrific brew... Highly recommended for fans of the style and I will gladly revisit in the future..."
"22 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says bottled on 09/25/12. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, licorice, molasses, and some herbal hops. Taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, licorice, piney hops, coffee, and a bit of dark fruit and toffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's very easy to drink for a beer that's 12.5% ABV. I liked this brew, it's definitely worth trying if you come across it."
""
""
""
"O: On taste alone, I'm surprised that this one is 12.5% honestly, though I felt it a few minutes after finishing the first 11 or so ounces. Alcohol is hid really well, with some great RIS flavors. Really quality stuff."
"It is an aggressive beer that can be enjoyed now, but I will get another bottle and sit on it for 3 years to see what happens."

"O= This is a quality RIS. I don't know how easy it is to aquire for a guy but I picked mine up from the store no prob. If that's the case this might be my ""go to"" RIS this winter. It fits the bill perfectly and tastes great. Check this out for sure."

"Served on tap, poured into a 6oz. taster, hope this is legit. At 12.5% ABV it better be. Thin tan head recedes quickly, but leaves sweet soapy lacing. Absolutely completely black, with small hints of ruby on the very edge, emphasis on SMALL. Otherwise very black. Aroma is rather subdued, unfortunately. Taste is filled with roasted/toasted molasses malt coffee oat, and TOBACCO, very chewy with some hops/bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth but severe. I do like it. Overall probably too much booze for my liking but still very good. Glad I did a 6oz. So far I'm impressed with Clown Shoes. Cheers."
"D - Not over bearing with alcohol, which happens with imperial stouts. Very drinkable"

"O – Overall, this is a titanic Russian Imperial Stout. Just totally arrogant, in your face, bold as all hell. I mean, the name says it all: Blaecorn Unidragon—a confluence of mythical beasts that surely no beer could live up to! And yet this just kinda does. Flavor is way over the top and perhaps a tiny bit overly ambitious, but hell, I just love beer. One truth that absolutely pertains to me is that I look for the best in all things, and I tend to find it and enjoy. This might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I think that it is just lovely--producing an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. Will definitely drink again."
""
"A letdown. Nothing wrong with the beer but not really getting into this highly hopped stout."
"O: Great beer, just spoiled by the bounty in San Diego County."
"O: I just don't understand why Clown Shoes released this beer. I have had plenty of Imperial Stouts, and generally like the style. But this one is one of my biggest RIS disappointments. There just isn't the complexity or harmony that I expect from a RIS. Too bad."
"Overall: An above average chocolate treat. I think the booziness in this one is a bit too overwhelming and dominates some of the other flavors. That separates it from others that I like more in the style. Not a bad beer, but there are others that I would go to first in the style."
"Pours pitch black with a khaki/tan head. lacing is short lived, but it cascades beautifully down the glass. Intense and earthy aromas of vanilla, pine, licorice and alcohol dominate the nose. It has a perfect mothfeel, creamy with low carbonation. The tast carries oasted malt up front that fades slowly and elegantly into a dark chocolate and bitter hop finish. There is definately a warming sensation to be had from drinking this brew, although the alcohol is surprisingly undetectable on the palate. Overall, I wish that there was a more intense flavor profile. Compared to the smell and appearance of this beer the taste felt somewhat muted. The bottle states that it improves with age, I'll have to cellar a few and see what happens. Definately recommended."
"There is a very distinctive stab of licorice aroma on the nose, overlaying the char, ash, coffee, and an additional welcome garnish of pine resin. The flavor, at first, resembles as though somebody had made charcoal briquettes out of carbonized raisins. As it warms up, the flavor gains elements of pithy bittering, smokey ash, and bitter cocoa powder. The ABV is hard to detect, so I advise taking it slowly with this one. This is a pretty good RIS that distinctively leans hard on the char side of the balance spectrum with framing accent notes of licorice aroma and resinous flavor."
"O: was a solid RIS which was better than I thought it was going to be and the hop character was well balanced and not over done."

"O - I'd get this again. This is a high quality russian stout that has plenty of complexity. I found this a nice break from the bourbon barrel aged stouts, maple syrup infused stouts, and other trendy picks. This is just a solid RIS with plenty to offer."

"Pours well with a med head , pitch black in color with enchanting aroma . The smell of chocolate or dark fudge .there is a slight smokey flavor hiding in the after taste . This Russian imperial stout really hides the high avb of 12.5 . I really enjoyed this stout. Next one will be enjoyed around a fire to bring out even more of the flavor . If. You have one or come across one I suggest its time to enjoy this beer ."
""

"O: Definitely a beast of a RIS. The alcohol can pack a punch, especially if you don't expect it. I'd say this is almost too easy to drink at 12.5%. It certainly hides it well. Worth the price of admission"

"I've enjoyed this one several times so it was past time to review. This is my favorite year-round available Russian imperial stout and favorite from Clown Shoes. Thick, smooth (much more than expected for 12.5% abv), creamy and complex. Plus it ages well. Highly recommended for imperial stout lovers."
"Mouthfeel is thick, still, but not too sticky. Overall, this is a good beer."

"Overall: I enjoyed this quite a bit. It was very malty with a big flavor. Unfortunately, the aftertaste was a little too bitter and rough. I wish they could have thrown a little bit more chocolate or balance in the end, this would have been much better."
"I was not going to drink this tonight but after mates being around for a few drinks i cracked it and it pours the darkest kola hue which leaves a three finger milkshake looking head and similar lacing everywhere,the smell is dark roasted coffee,dark belgian chocolate,booze and fruit cake almost perfect smelling,the mouthfeel is full bodied,silky smooth with minimal carbonation and has tastes of chocolate coated cherries and sultanas,dark chocolate malts,fresh berries,dark roasted coffee,a touch of aniseed and finished just like a milky bittersweet cappicino and overall i love it and it hides its high ABV very well something that could only improve with age and ill be buying it again cheers."
"D: pretty drinkable for a 12.5% ABV, but again nothing special"
""
"I planned to buy this beer and cellar it for at least a year, but I wanted to find out if it was worth the wait, so I bought one to try now. I got one that had been bottled in January, so it already had 9 months in the bottle. It was inky black, with very little head. Super malty chocolate, with a strong alcohol taste. A really big beer (obviously at 12.5% ABV). I wonder if another year in the bottle will really improve it? Haven't decided if I'm going to get another one and cellar it. Every time I get a Russian Imperial Stout like this, I always just wish I was drinking an Old Rasputin instead!"

"A great beer though. Very impressed. A fun beer,"

"Had this as a nightcap last night and it's a good thing it was.Poured into an imperial nonic jet black with a thinner deep khaki colored head atop.Deep roast with a hint of smoke to go along with big sweet alcohol and dark fruit in the nose,I could tell this was gonna be a big sweet monster.First off the sweetness and dark fruit hit hard and pretty much dominated the flavors for me,sure there is some roast and bitter chocolate notes but they seemed to cower under the sweet alcohol onslaught.It's thick and coating with was nice but it took alot for me to finish this beer,is it possible for a beer to seem bigger than 12.5%ABV?....Yes."

"The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish clings to the mouth, leaving a lingering aftertaste. This is a very good beer."

"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours pitch black. Nice two finger brown head with great retention and lacing. looks good. Good aroma of sweet roasted malt and chocolate, a bit of booze. Flavor is bitter chocolate and coffee with a toasted malt middle and chocolate and hop finish. A bit dry in the middle, but overall a good flavor progression and the rich flavor covers the booze noticed in the aroma. Nice creamy medium to heavy body. A nicely made, spot on RIS. Clown Shoes just arrived for the first time to our area and I was uncertain about the light hearted approach to labelling, but I'm impressed with their beers so far. Nothing unusual yet, but hit the styles nicely."
""
"O: Pretty good overall"
""
"Thanks Bruce! Pours pitch black with a large, light tan head. Scent is a ton of roasted malt. Dark chocolate with some clean, light caramel malt as well. A bit of cake batter with semi sweet chocolate chips. Taste is initially dark chocolate with that lovely cake batter flavor. Bitter-sweet chocolate flavors, but with a mellowed out vanilla flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a great hidden alcohol profile. Drinkability is scary-high for almost 13%. Overall, I love clown shoes so far. They have impressed me."

"overall - very solid RIS."
"O: Very robust brew that fits the Russian Imperial Stout genre. Very flavorful and everything is balanced and works well."
""
""
""
"Warming and very full-bodied, light, almost negligible effervescence. Smooth like silk, this brew just slides across the lips and tongue and onward down the throat with little more effort than water. A bit scary for a 12.5% Imperial! I don't know what I'm seeing, smelling and tasting that others aren't, but I'm sure glad I am, this beer rocks!"
"O - my first sampling of Clown Shoes and its quite good. Not in the league of BA RIS but VERY few non-BA are (there really should be two seperate categories IMHO). This stout drinks scarily easy for its ABV. The booze is present on the aftertaste but fades. A really solid, affordable RIS. Cant wait to try my other Clown Shoes beers."
""
"Overall not a bad beer. It's surprising how well the alcohol is hidden, you cannot even taste it."
"Overall: Blaecorn Unidragon is a very tasty imperial stout, that seems to fall midway between European and American styles. I have a feeling that a peated whisky barrel aged version would be outstanding."
""
""
""
"O - For just under 10 bucks, I was more than happy with this beer! You don't even know you're drinking a beer with such a high ABV until it hits you. If you like hoppier stouts, I highly recommend this."
""
"O: I liked this last in the 'horizontal.' Vampire Slayer is a superior beer, and it carries the blend of these two (Angry Beast). Maybe this bottle was poorly handled along the way, but it was unremarkable and devoid of much aroma or flavor."
""
""
"This is definitely a very hoppy Imperial Stout, somewhere between that style and a Black IPA. Not very complex, but quite tasty. Gotta give it credit for hiding such a high alcohol content so well, oh and for having a kick-ass name, too."
"OVERALL: This was great. The 12.5% only explains the ""quite"" delema, but otherwise, it wasn't anywhere to be found. This is an aromatic, flavorful, and well balanced beer with lots to contemplate. Glad to have had the chance to try this and would gladly get more if the opportunity arose. Recommended."

"22oz bottle with Bottled 2/2012 on the side. Pours an almost pitch black color with an inch of frothy brown head. Some lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate, black coffee, and earth. Taste is smoke and roasted malts up front. Dark chocolate and coffee. Warming alcohol as well. Chocolate and boozey finish. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid Russian Imperial Stout. Worth grabbing again, although I'd like to try aging one."

"This is an incredibly crafted, full bodied, perfectly flavored RIS. I look forward to buying a few more of these bombers in the future."
"O: A damn good RIS. Great flavors."
"1pt 6fl oz. Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. (perfect after drinking a Supa Hero)– Thanks to Manolo Baltasar from Freiburg & Robert Merryman from George & Dragon for sharing this one & many more. Black color. Tan, creamy, crown. Nice retention. Roasted malts, cocoa & sweet coffee both in flavors & aromas. Bitter chocolate at first sip & creamy sweet maltiness. Smooth & plentiful palate. Some dark fruit touch & dry bitter coffee & chocolate in the middle. Medium to full body, moderate carbonation. Good company when in good conversation."
"O - This has been on my ""to drink list"" for a while and finally got around to cracking it open tonight. The smell was a bit offputting, but I enjoyed it from the first sip. Strangely, the windex aroma went away after I started drinking it. Clown Shoes is becoming one of my favorite breweries, especially with their dark beers (the Hoppy Feets, Vampire Slayer, Chocolate Sombrero). The prices are lower than most other breweries bombers as well; this one was only $8 which isn't bad for a 12.5% RIS. Overall, very good and I will get it again."
"O- I have walked past Clown Shoes beers every time I head to the states. I won't be doing that anymore, this thing is a beast and I can't wait to go back and get more of this and more from them."

"Overall, this is a really good RIS and I am sure some age will only make it better. Definitely worth a try and comes recommended."

"The perfectly black, opaque body, and the khaki colored head, gave this beer the proper RIS look. The smell was heavy on chocolate, coffee, and toffee, but I could not detect any dark fruit type aromas. The taste was that of dusty cocoa, vanilla beans, coffee, and molasses. There was a sour, soy sauce like note permeating throughout. The body of the beer was much thinner that I was expecting. The feel was oily and slippery. The alcohol content was quite concealed, and this did not drink at all like a 12.5% ABV beer. Some warmth in the finish. Nicely put together."
"O: A decent RIS. Fairly boozy at times, but just about right. Many thanks to Rochefort10nh, as this was an extra he included in trade."
""
"D: This had a beautiful look and scent and body. The taste and finish weren't as great, but they were still decent. The alcohol wasn't too noticeable, given how strong the brew is, but it was definitely better to sip. Age would likely improve the beer, but it was still quite enjoyable fresh. Worth seeking out."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It bears a passing resemblance to Yeti, which is always a great thing in my mind. It's a very big beer, but it's never too bloated for its own good. Even still, it's best to share this mutha with friends. It's kind of expensive - I paid $11 for a bottle - but I'd say it's worth it if you're looking for a night-capping sipper to share with others."

"O: Great RIS. Definitely on the sweeter and chocolaty side. Very creamy, almost milk-stout-ish at times. Alcohol well hidden, overall one of the better RISes I've had. This might be Clown Shoes' best beer, it's close between this and Hoppy Feet 1.5."
""
"I'm liking the Blaecorn Unidragon. It's nearly pitch black with brown overtones in strong light. Decent dark tan head if you pour straight center. Awesome toasty smell, all malt and coffee with plenty of sweetness. Huge roasted taste. Bitter, but not too out of balance with the sweetness. The bitter flavor lingers for a while. Would I get another? No. I'm wondering if I can finish this bottle - we're talking strong stuff here; also, it's $$$ . But this is getting me curious to try other examples of Russian Imperial Stout. Stout in general is not my go-to style (good draughts of Guinness and Murphy's are notable exceptions), but I only review beers I'd recommend trying at least once. This I would recommend. Well crafted, good for a night at home, and plenty powerful."
"O- I was a huge fan of this stout. One of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts that I've had. I loved the intense milk chocolate flavor that dominated this beer and mixed smoothly with the high abv. At 12.%, the alcohol was barely detectable. This beer was packed with flavor and I would recommend any stout lover to try it."
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy tan head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is nice with some dark malts, nice hop note, chocolate/toffee/coffee notes, with a nice little touch of vanilla. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, lots of dark stuff. Medium body, ABV hidden pretty well with is one. This is a very tasty brew, thanks Bill."
"Poured a blackish body with minimal tan head on top of a roasted/toasted, even smokey aroma with some dark chocolate aromas and a touch of sticky, sweet molasses that overpoweres the subdued hops and non-existant dark fruit aromas. The dry smokiness of the beer is more aggressive in the taste, as some woodiness smooths it out a little but this is one thick sipper that I had to take slow. Along withe dryness is some sweetness derived from dark chocolate and a touch of toffee (I think) and there's a hint of floral hops and dark fruit (cherry is all I can think of), but for the most part this is just a fuller bodied malt bomb. ABV barely bleeds into beer, but still hits you as you sip and this one took a long time to nurse. A good beer, just a little rough for me to consider great."
"22 oz bomber pours an opaque black with big tan head and lotsa lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and licorice. Taste is the same - cocoa, coffee, licorice, and a little coconut in the background. Alcohol is well hidden. Even though this is a bit thin I love the way the flavor hangs on the back of the tongue for an eternity. This is a damn tasty RIS."
"Overall, the taste is quite good. The lightness of the flavor profile and the light body bring this down."
""
""
""
"O: Very good imperial stout. Another reviewer said it tastes burnt and boozy. Was it the same batch? None of that here! Cheers!"
""
"O - Fit for a Czar, Blaecorn Unidragon, my first experience with Clown Shoes, is a bold stout to say the least. Assertive, arrogant, and rightfully so, the potent alcohol and robust malt profile - well-balanced with earthy hops - makes this one of the ultimate soul-warming beers despite it's badass exterior."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really disappointed with this beer. It's burnt, and boozy, and not very good. There are a bunch of off flavors that just don't work well. I'm not a fan."
"Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is the same with a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice roasty presence in the aroma and flavor."
"O: really impressed; a top 5 RIS for my tastes - I'd put it in the same category as Odin's Tipple, Old Rasputin, Siberian Night, and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Most definitely worth a buy for a(n) RIS guy."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good Russian Imperial Stout. Another good brew from Clown Shoes."
"Taste: Dark roasted malts are most prominent, but it's hard to pick them out (or anything much else) through the omnipresent alcohol warmth that also really cuts through the medium-full-bodied mouthfeel. The aroma was so enticing, but I believe the flavor would benefit from some aging to mellow it out a bit."
""
""
"O: I'd been looking forward to this one for quite sometime and it didn't disappoint. I do wish the aroma could be tweaked a bit though."

"Palate is creamy and warm. This is a pretty good beer, especilly for the abv%. But aroma, flavor, and palate wise thise beer is pretty standard IMHO."
"Served in a tulip glass, opaque black with a creamy cap of tan head that retained well and left a bit of soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and not much else. Similar taste, dark malts, chocolate, roasty with a good balance of sweetness, a bit smokey, with hints of dark dried fruits, and some mildly resinous hops in the finish. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, noticeable alcohol warmth, and pretty nice overall."
""
""
""
"Decent R.I.S. nothing worth seeking out. Just a bit to hot and heavy for me. Definetly a sipper."
"Pours a three finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Coffee and alcohol nose, flavor is roasted coffee, some alcohol. Light burnt coffee finish. Decent RIS. $11.20 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"The roast in this brew just overwhelms whatever else might have bubbled to the surface. One note, but the note is one I enjoy; bonus points for a sense of humor, though. Overall? Good beer. Enjoying it, but can see the potential for greatness through the Looking Glass."
""
"Pours very dark with a nice dark khaki head. Faded very fast to almost nothing on top. Nice smoke almost burnt aroma wrapped around sweet chocolate notes. Chocolate starts to stand out the more you smell it. Chocolate does dominate the flavor too. Some burnt malts come in and out. Get some hop bitterness at the very end. Almost a full body. Good carbonation. Chocolate flavor stands out the most here. Easy to drink and rather smooth. Very solid ris!"

"O- The dark malt has a nice smoky rich flavor with some peat character but it is not overpowering. Not a lot of depth but some good flavor that taste like an imperial dry stout that a Russian Imperial Stout. With some nice warmth."
""
"Black in color with an khaki colored head. Intensely roasty with a metallic tinge to it. There's an ashy quality to it as well as some smoke and burnt toast. The flavor is really no better. I get lots of smoke, ash, and char. The metallic character is still there as is a mild acidity. Maybe some molasses, licorice, and dark chocolate, but sort of a moot point."
""
"Overall: A hard roastiness for a fully charry flavor with a generous hopping and a noted though not overly forward alcohol presence. It can be tiring, honestly, and, for me, it grinds to a very slow sipper about halfway through the bomber. I'm far less of a proponent of beer aging than I was in years past, but this, this beer seems like one that could really require some time to smooth out."
"O: I would most definitively buy this beer again. It is a very solid stout, and honestly the one real knock that would keep me from it is how high the alcohol is. It is very much a one and done type beer. If you are looking for a really good stout and that's it, you have found it."
"Flavors of roasted malt, slight char, ample bitterness for sure. Not as hoppy as anticipated, but still packs a punch. Dry and bitter, not very sweet or confectionary at all in the aftertaste, more resinous hop character and deep bitter dry roast. Medium bodied, the bottle was best shared. Abv was somewhat apparent, but still pretty drinkable."
"D ~ Very deep flavors here, which I come to expect from Clown Shoes these days. Lots of malty flavor and a hefty hop bill. Not one to pound, I wouldn't order it out for sure, but a great nightcap sipper to plug up for later. Well worth trying & a job well done from Clown Shoes."
""
"I would probably suggest aging a bottle of this to see how it compares. It's solid as is."
""
"O: Not really reminiscent of a typical Russian imperial stout. It's a very good stout, but was expecting a bit more"
""
"O- I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. A wonderful example of a Russian Imperial Stout, with some more complexity that expected. Clown Shoes is a brewery that never disappoints. I highly recommend this beer!"
"Blaecorn Unidragon goes in the glass looking black like a stout. Black as night with a tannish head up above with splotches. Nice retention. Smell is Very roasted malt forward. A pungent scent ala Storm King. Faint dark fruit with some coffee and licorice and bakers chocolate. Tasting this, It's apparent this is a big ass stout. Chocolate, coffee, licorice, cocco nibs, a hint of alcohol. One thing about these clown Shoes beers is that the alcohol is hidden very well in most offerings. Feel is full, carb is there, goes down smooth with a bit of warming. Glad I had it on tap because 22oz's of this would of been a chore."
""
""
"Look for this beer at your fave packie-- it's worth the adventure!"
""
"Overall: An alright beer, but certainly cannot stand against the big classic Russian Imperial Stouts of our times (Stone, North Coast, you name it). One good thing about this brew is how outrageously easy it drinks. 12.5%? You’d never bet! Lacking a bit in flavor, but damn chuggable."
""
""
"Thick mouthfeel and a bit of alcohol present. Not the best RIS I’ve had, but very solid nonetheless."
"O – Really solid stout here. Nice big and bold flavor. Smell seems sweet but the flavor is otherwise."
""
"Overall: I picked up a 22oz bottle for $7 and I feel like its probably one of the best offerings Clown shoes put out by me, and I will surly pick it up again."
"It's got a warming sting, rich and thick beer. Overall, good but not great."
""
"Chewy full body with a strong bitter hop presence that lingers over the dark malts into a dry finish. Again, surprisingly hop forward for the style with dry, sticky, resinous pine needle flavor. The hop compliment the malt but really bring out their roasted bitterness. This makes the beer a bit one dimensional with very little sweetness balances things out. Hints of dark chocolate, coffee bean, toast and oatmeal as well as some slight booze. Surprisingly very little heat at 12.5%. Pretty easy to drink but a bit one dimensional and too bitter for my preference."
""
"High Quality night capper or a natural with a decadent chocolate dessert. Well done. Likely the most impressive Clown Shoes brew I've tried to date."

""
"overall - as i drank more and more and killed the entire 22oz i felt that this beer should have been labeled a black ipa - the hops are there and the body was on the lighter side - overall will buy this again"
""
""
"A complex, roasted, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, cherry, slightly sweet stout that is strong and heavy on alcohol. This is one of the better non-barrel aged stouts I've had in a while, but it needs age. A year or two will do wonders."
""
""
""
""
"Nice job Clown Shoes!"
""
""
"MF- A little lighter than I expected, but still medium bodied and fairly creamy."
""
"I like this beer substantially. The thing is this: it's really drinkable, and simple as far as RIS's go, making it a great go to, unfortunately it's not in my area, and it's not special enough to seek out specifically."
"I did have this again a few days later, the second bottle was less impressive."
"The CPJ"
""
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. It already has a good bit of hop complexity that will definitely mellow with age, but I think that the balance is such that it will do really well in a cellar. I will probably end up picking up a couple more and put them back for 2-4 years and see what happens. Regardless, it is a good beer to drink now, but will probably soften up nicely if left to its own devices. I would recommend this beer."
"The reveal: Blaecorn Unidragon. Thanks Alewatcher! This beer was a definite want but not at all what i was expecting from the reviews I have read. I am really glad I had the opportunity to try this beer!!! I hope I can get my hands on another to age!"
"O: this is both a hoppy and a smokey RIS with minimal alcohol burn (despite weighing in at 12.50%). thoroughly satisfying stout for a carefree tasting."
"I feel a tinge of regret for sending this beer to a trading partner as an extra. It seemed like people across the country were interested in Clown Shoes, so I bought this and sent it off. This is the first time I've given this brewery a chance, and there probably won't be a second time unless the beer is free."
"D - The roast and ash become dominating taking away from the complexity."
""
""
"I'm liking this more and more as I get through the bottle. Maybe it's because of the sneaky 12.5% ABV. Maybe it's because this is a damn good beer. Maybe it's a hybrid like the name of the beer. Either way, I'm happy... and what more can you ask from a beer?"
""
"Pours near-black with a tan head. Spotty lacing and a collar throughout. The nose carries some heavy sweetness and a bit of booze. Loads of chocolate. Flavor really pulls back from there with too much booze and too much of the roast from the malt. Medium body with a slightly-boozy finish. Nose was great, but the rest was just pretty good."
""
"The beer appears near black with a half inch of dense beige head. The aroma brings prominent dark roast with dark fruits, molasses, chocolate. Heavy roast throughout, with alcohol content unobtrusive. Hard to believe this is 12.5%. A bit one dimensional, as the roast dominates the majority of the flavor profile. Really smooth feel on the palate. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of the beer. All in all, a solid beer, and one I would have again."
"22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Temperature of the ale was about 50º. Ale poured jet black with a mocha-brown head. Aromas were roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. Initial tastes were intense smoke and roasted malt, followed by some residual sweetness, slight cocoa and anise. The smokiness continues to linger on the palate and dominate the overall flavors. For 12.5%, the alcohol is well concealed! Mouthfeel seemed to be a little thin compared to others in the style, but still acceptable. Overall, I enjoyed this one, but I feel there are many more RIS's out there that are superior to this one."

"Once again I wish I could grade in .25 increments. A 3.75 overall fits the bill here, but since I can't I'll give it a 4"
"O: This is a wholly enjoyable, powerful beer."
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall it had a lot of flavors going on in it but it managed to bring them all together relatively well. The hoppiness was pretty bold in it for the style but it didn't clash with the RIS flavors nearly as bad as some do. Pretty decent beer overall."
"O- i loved this beer. would buy it again and could drink the whole bomber myself. i will be getting it again."
""
"O: lots of flavor, a bit hot, probably could use some time"
""
""
""
"Rich, smoky aroma has roast coffee and burnt wood notes, as well as a slight yeasty overtone. It pours a deep, chocolaty, opaque, warm sable with a thick, frothy, fine-bubbled and rather persistent head that leaves some respectable lacing. Smoky flavor fills the mouth with fine roast coffee, molasses and caramel notes plus hints of burnt hops and licorice. Texture has above-average body and - whoa, quite a fierce tingle, almost as if the beer had some hot pepper in it! Aren't you glad this beer is for real and not mythical? (Anybody know where you can get a Unidragon for a pet? Tee hee hee!)"
"Very good. Will look for this one again in the future."
""
"pours dark ruby red but is black in my glass. the head is small, tan, and bubbly. I'm smelling some heavily roasted malts, vanilla, and chalk. I sat with this for over an hour and really enjoyed it towards the end of our encounter. The piney hops actually dominate the burnt/espresso taste of the malts in this one, but both leave room for a subtle vanilla taste. I would have believed the abv was much lower but... it's definitely not. The carbonation however, is. Overall this is a solid RIS in my opinion. On the right day I love a very hop-forward stout, and this is it. Blaecorn Unidragon is a badass name for a beer and my first taste of Clown Shoes. I read an article today about them brewing their next anniversary beer with holy water, a gimmick I fully endorse, so I think I will continue to support them."
"Taste is much better than the nose, shows some promise moving forward. I think it a bit too boozy right now and the hops are a little sharp, but I think with another year or so could develop into something pretty rad. Its fairly smooth now and the chocolate is just a bit too much in the background. Roast is big, but never really gives off any coffee notes...more of a licorice-burnt offering if you will. I like it though and think I might even buy another bottle or two to put away for a couple years."
"D: I have got to say I was expecting more from this beer. I always have high expectations when it comes to Imperial Stouts because there are so many good ones out there. This is a good one, but not much better than your average drinkable IS. I'd like to buy it again and age it for a while and see what that does to it."
""
"I really, really enjoyed this RIS. It's my favorite offering from Clown Shoes so far. It's a big beer that drinks smooth."
"O: Goes down easy, quite tasty, somewhat filling, nice kick and nice representation of style."
""
"Overall, and recognizing that I'm repeating myself, this beer is characterized by ash and tobacco, and any other flavor is going to be rather difficult to find against the onslaught. This is not to say that the beer isn't palatable, but anyone not already a fan of heavy, black, ashy Imperial Stouts is going to be completely turned off by this one."
""
"Note: Bottled November 2011"
"Overall, for the right occasion or portion of your day/night, this should be considered."
""
""
"O: If the mouthfeel was bumped up on this, it would definitely be more sought after, but I like how it has its own flavor profile when stacked up against so many of the other RIS's out there these days. Definitely one of the more Robust Russian Imperial Stouts I have had. The flavors do not let up on the bitterness and the coffee side. Worth a try"
""
""
""
"I bought this beer originally to tuck away in my collection but thought I'd do the wise thing and try it first...glad I did. Now I know it's worth a year or so of painful waiting...but it will be well worth it. Cheers..."
"Have tried a few Clown Shoes beers so far and have not been impressed, but trying this one to reach a verdict. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip. Pours a deep pitch black color, thick off-white head, bordering on tan. Thick appearing texture. A beast of an Imperial Stout from appearance. Smell- roasty notes, dark fruits like currants, raisins, etc. Some booze notes, expected with a 12.5% beer that is relatively fresh. There is a weird plastic aroma, but its not a huge detractor. Taste- black roastiness, coffee bitterness, a boozy blast of sweet dark fruits. In the end, leaves a sweet chocolate bitterness and a strong hop presence. I have to say I am impressed. This is the mean badass experience I tend to like from my Russian Imperial Stouts. It asserts itself with aggression but overall is pretty drinkable and balanced for the ABV. Good beer, will probably grab another one for cellaring. Clown Shoes has redeemed itself!"
"I was in Boston this past week and I did not see this beer offered at the local taverns, reason?"
""
"O/D-Clown Shoes is a great brewery. One of the main reasons why Massachusetts is becoming a pretty legitimate state for craft beer. Their RIS is what it needs to be: big,intimidating, and delicious. Once again, this brewery nails it."
"Good stuff."
""
"Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel giant tulip, very aggressive. Poured very black, with a huge 4 inch mocha head, that hangs around for a while leaving plenty of lacing. Smell is powerful dark chocolate, roasted coffee, touch of smoke, and a little alcohol. Taste is all of that, strong dark chocolate and with huge coffee presents. Very large body, wonderful amount of life for its huge abv, kind of dry, and kind of drinkable for its large attributes. This reminds me a little of Stone 15 Anniversary imperial black ipa, not a bad thing. A hoppy beast that leaves a impression, for hop heads should be a good one. I find it easy to sip for it's abv."
""
"This is pretty good. I'm not sure I'll be purchasing again at the price, however."
"Full and robust body with smooth carbonation. Really no nonsense here. Well done one by Clown Shoes. I'm going to try more of their beers after this one (on a later date that is)."
""
"Overall really nice, delicious malts, tons of chocolate all dark and bitter, bit creamy, light coffee and espresso, lots of great flavors all combines. It's actually fairly drinkable since you can barely tell the booze, and would never suspect 12.5% even after it warms. the only thing that really takes away the drinkability a bit is the thick syrupy sticky mouth feel that never goes away."
"this beer reminds me alot of the espresso aged yeti from great divide but with a less strong emphasis on the espresso and a greater one on more complexity. fantastic beer, my best regards."
"Pours a solid black color with a huge creamy tan head that displays great retention and lace. Smells of bitter earthy ans citrus hops, roasted grains, coffee, alcohol and bits of wet dog. Taste is quite smokey up front, I wasn't expecting that from the aroma. Rich dark malts, roasted grains, ethanol, and citrus hops all rush in and no one can figure out who is in charge. Thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick oily mouthfeel. This has the makings of a great stout, but right now the flavors aren't melding well and the alcohol is a bit too present. I think with a bit of age this one might just be fantastic, we will have to see."

"-AJ's Review"
"Overall – A very roasty beer. Not overly sweet which I enjoy. Very bittersweet. In addition, the alcohol is hidden amazingly well. This is a very solid RIS and will get another to cellar. Pretty darn impressed."
""
"Overall, this is a pretty beastly stout that has a nice roasty flavor. This brew seems to be a perfect candidate for cellaring and i'm looking forward to try this a couple years down the road."
""
""
"Definitely a beer I'd like to revisit with some age on it."
""
"D - If you dig intensely charry European stouts this will be right up your alley - I could imagine Mikkeller or Amager making something like this with the intense roast and char flavors. Not my cup of tea unfortunately."
"This is a tasty beer that's pretty easy to drink for 12%+ abv. A little bit of age would smooth out the alcohol notes."
""
"O: I had high hopes for this but I felt a little let down by the Clown this time. Yes, I do realize that it's 12.5% and a certain amount of booziness is to be expected, but this was off the charts to us. Felt raw and unfinished. Definitely needs more time in the bottle."
"Simple stout. Almost Belgian in nature. Not too much going on here."
"I really enjoyed this offering!"
""
"Overall: I had heard good things about this beer, but honestly I think its just above middle of the road for the style. Not bad, but I don't think I would buy it again."
"The feel of this beer is smooth but is a bit heavy with a big feel that is with you throughout the sip. This drinkable and goes down easy with a slight burn at the back of the throat, nice."
"Blaecorn Unidragon pours a solid black, with a finger's worth of mocha foam sitting atop the beer. The head displays both good retention and lacing. The malty side of the nose is disappointing in that it's basically roasty and ashy, without much of a chocolate or coffee presence at all. There is a nice citrus undercurrent though, which manages to keep things at least a little interesting. I have a pretty similar reaction to the flavor profile. The malty flavors are still a little too roasty/ashy centric, although there is a little bit more coffee here than in the aroma. Again, there's a nice orange-y hoppy flavor that's present on the back end. It's all also a little bit mild, not nearly as potent as I might have anticipated. The body is nice and rich, full without becoming overbearing. The carbonation is a bit too much though, definitely takes away from what should be a malt centric beer. That's just the thing, Blaecorn Unidragon is supposed to be a big malty monster as an imperial stout, but the only compliments I find myself paying it are for its hops."
"Poured a 3"" dark mocha head with a lasting merengue, however, the beer seemed to exhaust all its effervescence in the process. Looks black as coffee. Smells like coffee, cocoa, and malt. Taste repeats the smell but what I definitely want to address is the high alcohol. I'm not at all averse to high alcohol in beers but they need to meld with the flavors, not simply burn. In my opinion Blaecorn is hot for hot's sake. If they'd toned this down to 8% or 9% like many others Imperial Stouts I suspect this would be even more of a winner."

"O: This was really a pleasant surprise. I heard friends giving praise for this but being known as a hoppy stout, I had my reservations. It delivered. While it is pretty hoppy fresh, the hop flavor work excellently with the malt flavor profile. Delicious with pretty good depth and a fantastic body, this is easily the best Imperial Stout I've had from a Mass brewery."

"Sometimes when I’m out and about tasting beers and taking notes I find myself writing descriptions that have very little to do with the actual taste or appearance, and more with the emotional or affect that they have upon me. For the CS imperial stout I noted Curious, good, interesting, dynamic. But that’s only because I had nothing to complain about in terms of appearance, aroma, taste and mouthfeel. Can't believe it's so strong. This was a good one, folks, an A-lister."
""
""
""
"O - Best Clown Shoes offering thus far. Very interesting RIS and for sure worth enjoying."
""
"A solid RIS."
"Nice roast malt profile with some hops that kick in nicely. Unique feel for a 12.5% RIS but a good one."
"Overall it is a good beer, the alcohol doesn't overpower it which is good. I would have it again."
"Intense imperial stout, not for those whom are scared."
"Pretty awesome, pure imperial stout with a bit of hop power...doesn't break any stout boundaries, but very solid. It's pricey but I wouldn't mind picking this up again sometime."
"A top tier RIS if you ask me... This was great all the way around... Looks, aromas, awesome taste... Well done, Clown Shoes!"
"What happens when you can't decide on a name for your beer? name it two things at once, o' course! This case-in-point pours a deep black (no fancy synonyms can do this black justice, so it's just plain black here) topped by over a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises darkly roasted coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark greens, and a small whiff of char. I never thought I'd say this, but this beer smells too damn dark... The taste holds notes of burnt malts, light char, light leather, bitter dark chocolate, and pine resin. It's good, but comes awfully close to being too bitter for its own good. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a mostly solid stout, but I think they overdid a few things here, particularly with the over-roasting of everything. That, coupled with a slightly too-thin body and an overly aggressive hopping make for a less-than-fully-enjoyable stout experience for me (see my reaction to Hoppin' Frog's DORIS, as the two seem very similar to me)."
"By far the best-tasting and most technically impressive Clown Shoes beer I've had to dare. I would prefer more sweetness, but I can't find any real faults in this. At a time when few New England breweries are producing stouts this big, I'm glad to see that Clown Shoes is pushing the envelope."
"Overall: Big beer, plays with the edge of overdone, but pulls up just short. Enjoyable, somewhat like an Old Rasputin, which puts it well into style in my book."
"This beer is a badass!!!"
"Really like this beer and glad that Clown Shoes is distributing to the Westchester, NY Region!"
"o - Overall a pretty good RIS. Very roasty and the taste is a little sweet, this is one I'd buy again."
"I wonder if Blaecorn Unidragon will retain enough body/mouthfeel to still be enjoyable by the time it has matured enough to tone down the aggressive astringency... For the price, I think I'd just go with Storm King, IF I wanted an overly hoppy, kinda woodsy but drinkable RIS."
"I would love to recommend this highly, because it's really good, but I'm getting picky about price these days. I live within 40 minutes of the brewery, in Boston, and I paid 11 bucks for this. Stone RIS, my fave, is 8 bucks. I can get an array of different RIS cheaper too. Whatever. I'm just saying: If all of Clown Shoes' other styles are so reasonably priced, why is this one so steep? Good brew though. Try it once at least if you're from the area."
"Overall, does not pour as thick as other RIS and is more in the middle of the pack. No overwhelming scents besides roasted malts and alcohol. Low carbonation, creamy and smooth. Overall, the beer lacks in the complexity and depth that I was hoping for. Hops are the predominate taste for me, and at this ABV and price, for that matter, I was expecting more. Better RIS are available at a better price."
"O- Very good imperial stout. Doesn't have a ton going on, but a very coffee/roasted malt forward with nice hop presence beer. Was looking forward to this beer from Clown Shoes and was not disappointed."
"A very good roasty stout. For those who love roasty stouts this is for you. Probably could use some aging as the bottle suggests to mellow out the ABV."
"O: Very, very good. I am very pleased with this RIS and love the fact that it's widely available."
"I had some expectations for this beer, but it exceeded them. If I was looking for a good hoppy stout, this is definitely one of the first I would look for."
"O: Overall, definitely tasty, again, the complexity seems to be a little bit lighter than other RISs but still quite good."
"Dark berry flavors behind the coffee-like taste. The swallow is interesting blend of black patent and warming alcohol. Looonngg aftertaste of mocha. The body is thin, but the carbonation matches this well."
"I loved this beer right away, from the very cool dragon-like being on the label to the coffee and chocolate aroma. Having said that, I only feel like this beer will get better with age as the hops drop a little bit and the aromas meld together a bit more. I'm excited about trying this one again with some time in bottle."
"Decent, glad I've tried it. Glad I only picked up one."
"O: All in all, this is a great beer. This is a good example of a RIS. One of those brews you could drink on a regular basis. It is one of those beers you could drink on a regular basis, but would not be a special occasion beer. Great to try if you like imperial stouts."
"Black. An inch of deep brown foam formed during the pour, falling very slowly. Very hoppy right out of the gate, citrusy and resinous aroma with a bit of a powdery character. Good head retention, some clumpy and streaky lacing. Chocolate and roasted notes in the nose, caramel and toffee, coffee and nuts, alcohol with mild fusels. Nice texture, full bodied without being extremely heavy, carbonation was on the lighter side but not as fine as I would have liked, alcohol warmth was apparent but not hot. Solid bitterness throughout, with hops and sweet malts battling for supremacy. Citrusy with a piney edge, caramel and roast, dry cocoa, toffee and dark chocolate, slight vanilla. Overall, a very hoppy take on a big stout. I'm partial to a maltier balance, but this worked out alright for me."
"First off - I enjoyed this beer. But...it's way more hoppy than any RIS I've had. I agree with others' sentiment that it's borderline Imperial Black IPA. I might snag another to cellar, though. Good brew, just not up to my standards for the style in terms of viscosity."
"Great, great beer!!!"
"Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Overall a very delicious offering. Clown Shoes does it again. Now if they would only brew a nice IPA. They sure love to hop everything else!"
"O - Yet another solid offering from Clown Shoes. Its a nice take on a RIS, though I'm not sure if I like the hop intruision to the style. Wish Clown Shoes would just make a regular ol IPA already and be done with hopping up other styles."
"After a few months, the hops are still there, providing a tobacco leaf and woody flavor. The alcohol is integrated even better than before with a slight anisette flavor, but after I finish the bottle and get up to go to the bathroom, I stumble a bit, look at the bottle see the 12.5% and am kind of shocked. the bold flavors overtake the booze even better after these months."
"Clown Shoes hit a home run with this one. As complex as many of the barrel aged RISs out there, but amazingly balanced."
"I was thinking I was going to be the bearer of bad news on this one, with the two A+ reviews. Just now saw the B... but I must say, this is pretty impressive for Clown Shoes."
"O: While this isn't the best RIS I've ever had it's not too bad. Full disclosure: I hate a super hoppy RIS...almost tastes like a Black IPA. Even then it has good flavors and aromas and the mouthfeel was wonderful."
"Drink this thing at room Temp and you will be amazed! I cant say enough about this brew...just great!"
"Overall, another very intense, outstanding brew from Clown Shoes. This Shoehead loves these beers!"
