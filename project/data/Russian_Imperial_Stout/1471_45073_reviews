"Fabulously chocolatey and a full mouth feel."
"Feel is good as well. Lasting flavors coat the mouth and the chocolate is rich and smooth. I could drink several of these and be happy!"

"Overall : Hitting on all cylinders, this stout is now my favorite of ALL TIME. This stout is absolutely groundbreakingly amazing. For $12 a 4 pack, who wouldn't buy this stuff. Just fabulous. Get you some now."
""
""
"A little bitterness at the end... Leaving you wanting more."

"Overall: A bit underwhelming in terms of my expectation, but still a great RIS. I have a bottle of the BA Pt5th that I am excited to drink now that I have a sense of the brew's flavor profile."

"O- not much complexity to this beer average stout there are better variations of this style available.  I'm glad I tried this but expected more based on the reviews."
"Like many other reviewers, I did not feel this beer lives up to the hype.  For the money, Founders RIS is better.  Poured from a 12oz bottle chilled into a brandy snifter.  Pours a deep black with barely a finger of tan head from an aggressive pour.  Head dissipated quickly.  No oily residue on top.  Smells of dark bitter chocolate, hops, and dark fruits.  Little to no coffee smell.  Taste is much thinner in the mouth than I would have preferred with hardly any coffee or espresso finish. Dark roasted malts, toffee, bitter dark chocolate and hops.  No vanilla.  Dark fruits like raisins or plums/prunes.  Hoppy and slightly bitter after taste.  This is not my preferred RIS.  It's very good but not great."

"Very good offering here. Very reminiscent of a fresh Founders Imperial Stout for me. Gonna put a good year or two of age on this and see what it does."
""
""
"Poured a pitch black color, opaque, absolutely no light showing through. Half inch head faded pretty quickly but left a thin tan film that laced nicely. The smell is chocolate, raisins, coffee, and some dark roasted malts. The taste is pretty close to the smell, with the dark chocolate and coffee flavors more dominant, and the dark fruit flavors a bit more in the background. I'm also getting a bit of heat from the alcohol. The mouthfeel was kinda thin, but very creamy, with a nice bit of carbonation. Overall, very good beer, not sure it is worth the $4.99 price tag for a 12 oz bottle though."

"2014 vintage 12oz bottle poured into a glass"
""
"More of the same as this crusher flows over the palate.  Waves of dark chocolate and coffee. Dense and flavorful.  I'd like to dry it with a chocolate dessert. World class night capper"
""
""
""
"Honestly was disappointing by this beer after all the hype. A solid baseline RIS, but this didn't make my top 10."
""
""
"Overall: I think this beer is overrated to be quite honest with you. It has a decent amount of the roasted malt, chocolate qualities you want in an imperial stout, but its not up there with Founders IS, Expedition, Ten Fidy, or even Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in my opinion. I found the mouthfeel to be lacking as well as its very thin and not as luscious as a beer in this style should be. Still a solid RIS and should cellar well"
""
"O: definitely a stellar example of the style, but to be fair, it can't really compare to the bigger & bolder BA & adjunct brethren."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer. Not in the top tier of the style IMO, but would certainly drink again."
""

"A very thin stout with notes of roasted malt flavors combined with some sweetness. Starts off sweet and then finishes with a burnt like dry aftertaste which complements the flavors nicely. Mild amount of carbonation with a mild amount of bitterness.  Overall, this is a strong tasting stout with a nice warmth to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Was expecting a world-class RIS, but got a merely good one."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid RIS with no complaints. First time having this beer. Will be heading back to the store to pick up a few to age for years to come. I really hope I get to try the BBA version soon. I can only imagine how aging this beer in BB would increase an already stellar RIS."

"Nice coffee, chocolate & licorice flavors on the nose and tongue. A little thin, but pleasant mouth feel. Probably a little too hyped, but still a quality stout."

"Great beer!  It was dark and thick on the pour with a brown creamy head.  The first aromas I got were of roasted coffee, chocolate, and alcohol.  The taste was very strong as an 11% alc/vol should be.  The booziness is definitely detectable followed by a chocolate, coffee, and smoke.  This is definitely a fine fine product.  The minute you swallow this beer you start to get that warming feeling in your gut.  The after taste is a slight bitter, but nothing to take away from the beer overall.  This is a great imperial stout.  I really enjoy this and Dark Horse Brewing Co.'s Too Cream Stout as well!  Try them both!"

"12oz bottle poured into stout glass. Very dark brown and nearly opaque with a few brown slivers at the edges. Half an inch of tan head rises and quickly falls to a thin cap that lingers. A few spots of lace remain. Aroma is of roasted malts, dried dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate, touch of soy sauce, and alcohol. Taste starts moderately sweet with chocolate, brown sugar, and date. Some bitterness follows from espresso and woody notes. Alcohol is masked well but not completely hidden. Medium-full body, creamy texture, low carbonation, warming sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a decent beer. I liked the cocoa notes and the smooth feel. I would have liked more foam, for the aroma to be less boozy, and for the taste to be less metallic and earthy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This RIS is solid.  No criticisms here.  To put things into comparison, I think Ten Fidy is more robust, but this one is more balanced and friendly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seemingly less sweet than previous versions. ABV masked well."
""
""
"The look was very clean, dark and pleasing on the eye. The smell was tasting as the taste, which was full on the tongue in a very good way and gave it a feel that have you wanting more."
""
"Overall, it's a tasty, solid imperial stout. As I said, its body isn't a complete match to its aroma and taste, but after getting a bottle of this as a gift, I made an effort to get more."
"O- Just what I want from a RIS. I highly recommend this. This beer behaves like a RIS and with a 11% ABV will leave you feeling good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome. Tons of chocolate that lingers nicely. Near the top of my non BBA list."
""
""
""
"Finally found Plead the 5th at a beer store in Stevensville, Michigan at John Beers and Hollywood for $14.  Wow!  Absolutely loved this beer.  So smooth and full of flavor. This will be one of my all time favorites.  RAFH 2/9/15"
""
"First time having non-BBA version of pt5 and it's very similar to BBA version, minus the bourbon influence.  Almost has a tobacco smell/aftertaste and I'm not a smoker.  Hard to love this beer, it's good, just not great compared to others."

"like Spanish liquorice, dark & tasty"
"The raspberry ruined the brew.  It was bitter and sweet...usually not a bad thing but this is a beer I couldn't finish"
"Surprisingly found this in Amsterdam. Phenomenal chocolate and coffee smell - taste is almost as good - it would be near-perfect imperial stout if not for the slightly excessive sweetness."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my tulip. The smell of chocolate fills the air as soon as I pop it open. It pours rather flat, but the smell is very inviting.  The taste is exactly what I look for in a impy stout. Thick, rich, roasty, viscous, smooth to drink but lingers on the tongue. Hands down one of the best stouts I've had, period."

"Pours a one finger brown head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Chocolate nose and flavor is roasted chocolate, some sugar decent IS. High (label 11%) ABV is hidden. $4.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Pours a black color.  1/4 inch head of an off-tan color.  Decent retention and decent lacing.  Smells of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of caramel malt, slight hop, and a hint of oatmeal.  Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  There is a noticeable dryness.  Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, alcohol, hint of hop, and a hint of oatmeal.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, decent feel, good body, and decent overall."

"The abv is well hidden and smooth mouthfeel for such a big beer. Yet nice big roasty chocolate imp flavor. Touch of toffee but not all that sweet. Can see why this gets great reviews. Happy to have tried it and would buy again."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/22/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial stout! All around fantastic complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely amazing offering."

"Jet black. Minimal dark tan had. Very strong stout smell. Really sweet smelling. Taste like eating a dark chocolate candy. Mildly roasty. Minimal coffee flavor. Mostly chocolaty. Very good. Would love to try the bourbon barrel version."

"I could see some lees at the bottom of the bottle, so I employed a very gentle pour to get things started. I still got a brief finger of deep-tan head with limited retention, quickly falling to wisps. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose smelled of molasses or medicinal cough syrup from when I was a kid. It had a vegetal, root-like quality that also put me in mind of my grandparents' Geritol. I am not trying to be funny or anything of that nature, either. That is just what comes to mind. Mouthfeel was big, dense, thick, chewy. There was an initial, immediate fusel alcohol burn that slowly died down, allowing for flavors of burnt charcoal, dried dark fruits, anise, and molasses to come forth and be recognized. Whew! This was definitely a no-playing-around beer. Finish was dry, mainly due to the alcohol heat, with a lingering smoky chocolatiness that began to put me in mind of brownies. It was a good beer and I am sure that it is an excellent example of the style, but a) I do not really dig the style and b) it could have aged a while longer to reduce the heat."
"Overall, they definitely got something here! I will be on the prowl for this again!"

"Delicious stout, right up there with Ten-FIDY and Founders Imperial Stout."

"2013 poured into a snifter. Dark as night with minimal dark brown head which quickly disappears. I think I can taste bitter, semi-sweet chocolate paired with a roasty coffee-filled linger. The bitterness, to me, is from the chocolate, I don't necessarily pick that up from the coffee influence. Dark brown sugar, too, and does sweeten up a tad as it warms. Drinks very smoothly for 11.0% but even after it warmed I couldn't help but notice the lingering bitterness. Tends to be a bit of a downgrade for me."

"Empties the bottle black with a sheer, tan head. Aroma is spot on with milk chocolate, dark fruits, subtle vinegar and burnt oak floating freely. This is one of the smoothest beers I can recall trying. Just floats its way down (despite its medium to heavy body) with prominent notes of milk chocolate, bubblegum and black licorice, followed by hints of oak, cherry and vanilla. Fusel alcohol is barely noticed in the back. A beautiful, well-crafted stout that pairs well with this cool and rainy spring evening."

"Pours a deep a deep black with 1-2 fingers of dark mocha head, dissipating quickly to a creamy collar and leaving slight lacing. Massive roasted malts, dark chocolate, a bit of coffee in the nose. On the palate the dark roasted malts shine through with lots of dry coffee, fudge, dark chocolate and some nice bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, this is just a delicious, well balanced stout, one of my new favorites!"

"This beer was purchased as a special edition (limit 1 bottle per customer). It pours well, very small/no head and is a very dark brown color. It is a heavy coffee flavor, but smooth and goes down easy! I would recommend to anyone who likes coffee or coffee in their beer."

"Poured a black body with minor head and lace. First thing that hits me in the nose is dark fruits like raisin, figs, and then minor sweet malts like chocolate and something sugary (not going to say candi sugar or caramel...toffee? molasses?) and then balance from some roasted malts and to be honest no alcohol. The lack of alcohol in the nose and also the beer itself is quite a feat considering it's a double digit ABV beer. This beer, for as heavy as it could be and with so much going on, is actually light and easy to drink with a chewy, fuller body that goes down incredibly easy with notes of chocolate and other sweet flavors (again - toffee? molasses?) hints of figs, some roasted malts, good balance and the beer has a good, strong finish without alcohol burn. Just a solid stout."

"Unbelievably this is the first time I have had this beer...crazy.Pours jet black like an oil slich with a thinner beige head atop,like thick crude.Chocolate and black licorice in the nose along roast and sweet alcohol.Heavy roast and earthiness intertwined with alcohol dipped dark druit and deep molasses sweetness with that black licorice coming into play as well,whoo this big and complex.Big and chewey this is a sipper that Iam drinking at 6:00,it could be an early bedtime tonigh because I have three more to drink."

"Having tried the other four stouts in Dark Horse's vertical, I was very excited to sample the fifth and final offering. It did not dissappoint. This ale pours black with a very small and short lived tan head that leaves a slight film and lacing. The aroma has an over abundance of dark chocolate followed by a lesser amount of coffee, burnt caramel, and vanilla. The nose is the best thing about this beer. The flavor follows the nose but is more subdued. All the notes are there as in the nose but they just are not as dynamic. The coffee is more pronounced particularly in the bitter finish of the ale. Other than the finish it is a rather sweet stout. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but smooth and satisfying none the less. This is damn good but maybe not as rich and complex as some of the other offerings in this category. Can't wait to see how it ages."
""
""

"O:A very good stout, but there are a ton of better stouts out there. not disappointing but not world class IMHO"

"This is a great, complex beer. No oats in the recipe that I know of but there's a smoothness that is reminiscent of an oatmeal stout. Big and bold on the nose. Main body of the flavor is bitter chocolate with some coffee. Some sweetness lingers on the finish. Solid offering, I'd like to get the barrel aged version some day."

""
""
""

"Overall: This beer is fantastic. If you can get your hands on it, DO IT. I am not a huge stout drinker, but this one has really made an impression on me. I will be picking up more very soon!"

"O.A. this is a delicious example of an American r.i.s., find it, buy it, try it, like it!"
"Yeah, this is pretty great stuff, and while it's not as complex or insane as other domestic offerings, it still is notable for its stupidly easy drinkable character, especially with the alcohol being this well hidden, in this case. I definitely was happy with my half portion, but I could have easily had more if I wanted. Definitely worth a try, and a very interesting look on how the base beer changes substantially compared to the bourbon barrel version."

"The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, with low carbonation, and a finish that isn't overly sticky. Overall, this is a very good imperial stout, with wonderfully complex and subtle flavors. This is also something that I can drink over and over again, not something that is so overwhelming that you're knocked out after one. Really hope I can try the barrel aged version at some point!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a tasty RIS. I don't like it as much as the barrel aged version, but it's a really tasty stout!"
""
"Overall, this is a great beer. Full of wonderful smells and flavors. I feel like the next time I have it, I'll be picking up different layers. I can't wait."
""
"Pours a opaque oily black with a dark brown pancake batter (oily) head. Wonderful smell of campfire, malts, vanilla, roasted malts, coffee. The taste follows the nose with some added semi sweetness up front (raisins, figs) followed by a drying dark chocolate. Some smoke detected in the back end. Overall this is a must have kick ass RIS. I purchased two wight the idea of aging one, but I don't think I can wait. Phenomenal brew."
""
""
""
"O: Perhaps the, if not one of the best imperial stouts I have ever tasted. This blows the socks of Founders booze bomb, which I very much respect. Very complex and full bodied providing a filling feeling along with a complex palate. I can see why people wait in line for the BA version, it would likely be amazing."

"A good looking beer....Totally opaque, deep brown color, modest light brown head, and nice lace. Aroma is an easy going mix of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark berries, plums, vanilla bean, and perhaps a hint of smoke. Deep and smooth aromas... Taste is very chocolatey with some caramel, creamy vanilla, and lactose sweetness. Slight piney bitterness works its way through. Very yummy; dessert in a glass. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, coating, and almost silky. Overall an excellent Russian Imperial Stout. Chocolate chocolate chocolate."

"Pours black as pitch with a quickly dissipating dark brown head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of chocolate, burnt sugar, coffee, and dark roasted grain. Flavor follows the aroma with chocolate and roasted grain dominating. Finishes dry with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Full bodied with very little carbonation, this is a very smooth Imperial Stout. Overall, a very well crafted beer that goes down surprisingly easy in spite of the 11% ABV."

"Plead the 5th looks almost perfect... pitch black, with a thin, off white ring around the perimeter of the glass. Splash of tan in the center. Visible and minimal carbonation. Aroma is very heavy... dark chocolate cake, dark fruits, some sour cherry, and it is indeed very roasty. Flavor wise, that roasty, toasted malt aspect comes through in a big way. Secondary to that are the pleasing coffee and chocolate notes. It does start off very smooth, and appropriately fades out into a very dry finish. There is a very strong 'campfire' aspect to this as well, which could turn some people off. I rather like it, myself. The mouth feel is medium-heavy, and overall, this is an interesting blend of sweet and smoky. Recommended for any RIS head."

"My favorite of the Michigan winter imperial stouts (Expedition, FIS). Incredibly rich chocolate flavor enhanced with the most vibrant vanilla for a non-vanilla aged stout. Very balanced - exceptional."
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this one but I don't think I'd like it as much fresh. I had it side by side with a fresher barrel aged version, and the barrel really does some magic. I'd definitely have more of this one, but I won't go out of my way to get it."

"Had on draft in 10oz goblet. Pours a jet black with next to no carbonation. Minimal dark ring of head. Has a nice smell of chocolate and coffee. Surprisingly smooth for coming in at 11%. The coffee stout taste really hides the boozyness well. Has a nice smooth feel to it, not too creamy like a lot of stouts. Love the name. Would definitely be a repeat buyer and I'm not usually a fan of stouts."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is a great beer. One I'll be looking for again. Definitely worth the try. However, I think my go to may still be Old Rasputin. I only bought a single bottle of this so I'm not sure what the going price is on a 4/6er of this is but that would really determine it for me."

For 11abv it is amazingly easy drinking and doesn't show any of its alcohol. A definite contender for my favorite non-BA stout. The coffee does add just a little astringency to the nose and taste, but otherwise I have very little negative that I can say about this beer."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. This aspect was just so over the top robust, with woodiness from out of nowhere, char and ash, fruity sweets to match, and general complexity. The blend really comes through and each individual component finds its mate, striking harmony. The flavoring follows nicely, with just as much punch through the taste. Here, however, things did not strike as beautiful a balance, but rather just swam together in the same pool. The booze was way forward, even for the style, but it did offer some nice sweetness towards the front of the sip, contributing to the flavoring itself in a way that many beers lack. The sip was slurpy, creamy, and coating, helping to offset some of that brutal chalky astringency. This is a huge, impressive offering from Dark Horse, and we can’t wait to try the barrel aged version."

""
""
"Older bottle (old white and gray/black label). from trade with jrgratz. Thanks ya! Pours thick jet black with dark brown small head. Big roasty aroma balanced by some dark fruit and anise. Big furry mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Big bittersweet chocolate taste, roasty malt, sweet molasses. Really awesome and like this better than the fresh BA version I had. Lingering cocoa on the palate. Big stout on the sweet side and very nice."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a very dark, oil-like black coloring with a thin, low profile, dense, light tan colored head. Aromas of dark, bittersweet chocolate, black cherry, peat and earthy tones, and a touch of ginger. Pretty interesting nose. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a warm, cocoa and sweet chocolate backbone supporting a touch of bitter coffee and some subtle fruit sweet highlights. Rich and smooth in mouth...almost creamy. Bitter and creamy aftertaste, with hints of baker's chocolate and a hint of booze. Rich, smooth finish, with a slight bitter linger. Very solid, robust brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: A F'n masterpiece. Quality over quantity and this brew delivers. I got a lot more than what i bargained for and was fortunate enough to pick up a 4 pack of this gem. Salud!"
"first of all, thanks yet again to thebrewo for hooking this up via the best trade of my life, I definitely owe this crew some beers! been aching for this beer, and finally here it is, sort of a hybrid between the west coast hugies and the Midwestern Russian imperials, a real treat. this pours an impossibly dense shade of black, brutal and old oil sludge looking, just not that thick. the head is though, cappuccino color, lasting, frothy. its got an understated nose for the style, come bitter espresso beans, and an oaty, boozy magnitude. the flavor is different than most, not sweet or roasty up front, but ashy, tobacco heavy, like the first puff of a cigarette before the tar gets on your lips and the chemicals really concentrate towards the filter. its got a roast bitterness that comes in for a second, but it doesn't manifest. earthy chocolate and coffee notes round it out, before a subtle residual sugar and alcohol warmth bring it home. also a backing touch of gingerbread, out of nowhere. its deep and rich and complex and close to perfect as far as taste goes, I could not imagine the barrel aged versions of this, just too much to process mentally for me! thick as hell on the body, but not teeth coating and filling and lasting and dental work necessitating. its cleaner than that, although not clean by any stretch. the alcohol is present, but its right in step, not too intrusive, not invisible, this is a very conscious beer, self aware, no identity crisis here. overall this is an exceptional piece of art, by a brewery I need to get more involved with. really truly a brilliant offering. thanks again to thebrewo for hooking it up!"
""
""
""
""
"I think that this an okay imperial stout. My main beef with this beer is that it tends to fall up short in terms of flavor. Kinda of like that little engine that almost but didn't quite make it."
"Overall - Blown away by this one, truly outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Incredible stout worth seeking out!"
""
""
"O- Not being a big Imperial Stout drinker have no real comparison. Will say this is a very tasty brew, alcohol is there but not in your face, great balance of flavors"
""
"O - my best comparison would be a better version of TenFidy. The flavor profiles are similar and I think Pt5 is a little more refined. Overall an outstanding stout. I prefer a little more coffee and chocolate in my stouts, so the only demerit from anything higher is based purely on personal preference."
"this is an excellent stout. lucky enough to get this via trading, had no idea it was already aged properly in the guy's cellar beforehand. it is just fantastic, and i can't imagine what the bb version is like. to compare this to something else, think central waters peruvian morning."

"Plead The 5th Imperial Stout is an extremely well crafted beer that fires on all cylinders. I cannot wait to try the bourbon barrel aged version of this."
"Overall: I have not had anything like this. It is quite complex and a well crafted big complex RIS. The BA version of this is simply outstanding while this is highly enjoyable."
"Enjoyable and well done, but somewhat forgettable, too. Maybe I’ve just had too many RISs lately, but this just doesn’t strike me as being something that stands out. It’s certainly not a bad example of the style, nor does it seem like brewers skimped on ingredients. Points for high drinkability for sure. I should stop quibbling and just enjoy the rest of it!"
""
"Quite an impressive beer. Drink it at cellar temp - my rating for taste went up .5 points at cellar temperature than right out of the fridge. Very drinkable for the high abv. Overall excellent. Recommendable."
""
""
"O: Extremely pleasant beer, very easy to drink, perhaps dangerously easy. Quite feeling, almost like a meal. Not much more to ask of a Russian Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
"I don't feel like following a format today so: This beer is awesome. Pours with a short dark brown head. Not quite as thick as a yeti or ten fidy. Mouthfeel is spot on, creamy with medium carbonation. Everything is balanced, none of the flavors are too much. Slight alcohol heat but not a predominate taste. Dark chocolates with just a hint of burnt coffee. Amazing stuff, get some if you can."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy bodied with medium-light levels of carbonation. The result is a smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel that is thick and well-geared towards sipping. Ethanol is only slightly felt on the tongue and in the nostrils, very good for an 11% beer. Closes dry and slightly astringent, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Soild, but not quite world class. A little to smooth and light flavored. Its right up there with balance and flavors but not enough of a blast of them. Worth a drink for sure, id like to cellar this for awhile and see what we end up with. Top ten ris yes, top 5? No way."
"Overall, very good."
""
""
""
"Clearly, this was one of the better ales I have tasted in a long time and my only regret was that it is listed as a seasonal coming out in February."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark brown to black with a thin layer of beige head. The nose was troublesomely reminiscent of wet cardboard. There roasted malt blends well with the creamy consistency. This is certainly a full-bodied RIS. The finish has both sweet and roasted notes along with a very subtle alcohol presence."
""
""
"Dark Horse Plead The 5th Imperial Stout ---4/5."
""
"This is a fantastic beer that has an immensely deep, complex flavor. I am really impressed with this one. Each sip offered just a little something more from the great malt character. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and I look forward to trying it again."
""
""
""
"This is an enjoyable RIS, especially if you're into hopped stouts. I would love to get my hands on the barrel aged version. A few bottles of this one will be sat down in my cellar to see how it drinks after some hop fading."
""
"Taste is roasted bitter malts with a hint of chocolate and coffee but again its dominated by the roasted malt. Its a bit bitter...super dry but still pleasant. Its a big beer for sure but not my fav of the style. I had high hopes for this...maybe too high. Its kind of like a triple Guinness...if such a thing exists."
""
"3.5/5"
"Comes close to Expedition Stout for me, which I 'd prefer juuust a little more than Pt5, but I will drink this RIS anyday. Wonderful color. Good balance & mouthfeel, just the right viscosity. Though I felt Expedition offers the complexity that I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very, very dark, opaque brown with a loose mocha head that dissipates pretty quickly. Almost no light penetrates this brew. Nose is pretty hoppy for a stout with a prominent alcohol almost solventy smell up front. After a couple more deep whiffs I get a bit of semi sweet chocolate and a bit of roastiness. Taste is smooth with light roast and chocolate but also some subdued hop flavor in the mix. Loooong bitter finish with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Can taste a bit of the solventy-alcohol that I picked up so much on the nose but not too much. Smooth on the tongue with just a little carbonation but actually sort of light mouth feel for a stout let alone an 11% stout. That being said, it is very easy to drink. Second time having this beer, and I enjoyed the first more than this one. Just had a Founder's Imperial Stout last night and this particular bottle did not even come close (perhaps that's influencing my review?). Gonna try to cellar my other bottle for half a year to see if it mellows out a bit. Pretty good beer, but not in a hurry to pick it up again."
"So, if you can find it, definitely pick it up. If you cannot find it....don't fret! Pick up some Ten Fidy or Founders IS, both of which are much easier to locate and are just as good as this one."
""
""
""
"Smell on this beer as it warms up is some dark chocolate malt beer is dark as night taste follows smell dark roasted chocolate malt the thing that really stands out about this beer is the fact you really don't taste the 11% or at least in my opinion anyway I know a lot of other people say different."
"Pours nice and dark with a thin fizzy head. The smell is a nice sweet coco chocolate mix. Thinking dessert drink possibly. The taste is a combo of sweet and bitter chocolate coco. Pretty good actually. Maybe a hint a bitterness lingers around a bit too long to knock this down for me. It also has a kind of fizzy feel at the end of the taste. Overall, I do enjoy this and would buy it more often if it were anywhere around me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome trade. Would definitely buy if it was available in GA. Will have to settle for Bell's Expedition, and Founder's Imperial...."
""
""
"Nice looking beer, but I can't really describe this in a way that separates it from countless other quality RIS offerings. Opaque black brown with cream colored head. Nothing odd here. Aroma of lightly hopped dark and toasty barley dominates the whiff of the chocolate that comes across far more potently in the taste (the chocolate, that is). The other taste presence is more of a sensation, bitter to be exact, without an overwhelming hop profile. My highest praise is attached to the silky ass mouthfeel. Just dandy as hell the way this ribbon of liquid seduces the tongue. How's that for women's romance novel descriptive? Anyway...to wrap this exercise in verbose babble up, I deem this ale well worthy of super happy time yum drinking. Ciao."

"Was it worth to search out to just obtain one bottle--no. If you missed out on this release just relax. Measures well with Expedition, Founders RIS, Ten-fidy...etc.. Great company but doesn't stand apart. Even the price point was high, $5, which is also part of the store markup I'm sure. For the right price I will buy more, but I refuse to chase down!"

"The taste is of strong chocolate malts, espresso, vanilla, graham cracker and dry roasted coffee. So smooth, so creamy the taste and feel are a single unit. Very light on the stomach and exceptionally easy to drink for 11 percent ABV. My only complaint is the it dries the palate but other than that this is a phenomenal beer."

"Overall- Damn fine RIS. Really want to try the Bourbon barrel version of this."
""
""
""
"Overall: solid but nothing to go crazy for. my first good/great beer from dark horse. probably not something I would buy again at the price"
"I was very excited to try this. Amazingly drinkable and addictive for 11%. The texture was superb and there was a great amount of depth. I am anxious to see if the boozy flavor settles out after some time."
""
"D - I'd never guess this is 11%. Wonderfully built and amazingly drinkable. A great success from Dark Horse."
"Poured into a glass from the bottle, one must note the attractiveness of this beer. Pouring a handsome black color, a mocha colored head tops the beer before fading to lace the sides of the glass. In the aroma, one gets notes of burnt malts, chocolate, and a hint of molasses. I was a little surprised that the aroma is so muted since this is relatively fresh. On the initial taste, one detects dark chocolate, smoke, burnt sugar a sweet backbone. The alcohol is noticeable, but in a good way. I enjoyed this stout near room temperature, which really helps to highlight the nuances of the beer. The smooth mouthfeel allows a sweet dark chocolate note to linger on the back of the tongue until it almost becomes mediciney. It is an that point that the warming sensation of the alcohol bursts through and reminds you that this stout has an 11%ABV. After about three sips of this beer, I am starting to feel it. This beer is an excellent nightcap, and may be best shared with a friend."
"A very good earthy RIS."

""
""

"This beer did not disappoint. I will likely pick up a few more to enjoy and/or cellar. Not my favorite of all the RISs I've had so far, but certainly in the top 4 or 5."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good imperial stout, that suffers from a bit too much alcohol presence as well as the overly decadent and thick mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"In my 2nd decade with stouts as my favorite style, I was not expecting to be impressed by this. Perhaps the bottle of 1 I had was bad... However, I can't say enough about the creamy roasty mouthfeel, the depth of flavor, or the character of this beer. I'll be buying more tomorrow."
""
""
"D: wow, this is what a stout should be. and similar to another offering of Dark Horse's, bottle conditioning is a plus. not sure how this holds up over time, but really satisfied with drinking it fresh. well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: rich, rough, and deeply chocolate, with a bit of the abv peeking through - lots of flavors, does justice to the tradition of the Russian Imperial stout. Dark Horse makes very good beers at a decent price, and this is just par for the course."
"O: This is equal to, if not better than, FIS. I'm just really, really loving this brew. It's hard to improve upon. Very nice."
"Re-review 3/9/13-Maybe my tastes have changed, but I am not impressed with this years batch. The alcohol is near overpowering at 11%, adding a very astringent finish. The dark fruit is minimal in comparison to the roast and char. The very large percentage of chocolate malt and black patent adds to the astringency and creates an unpleasant tartness. It finishes very dry for the style with too much charcoal and burnt grain."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It was a good stout and exactly what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat of a chameleon in flavor. One sip is roast dominant, another dark fruit. Fairly complex, with enough roast to balance the dark fruit overall, and enough chocolate to keep things from being overly bitter. Seems to just lack something that would make it exceptional. Maybe bourbon..."
""
""
""
"Seriously a badass stout; orgasmically powerful roast from nearly start to finish with a heavy and hard-hitting bitterness through and through. I love stouts like this. For the high ABV, it drinks pretty well. I'm biased towards bitter stouts, so this one was right in my wheelhouse. Simply delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured this slightly warm, however it is still so good. Has a modest light brown head that settles after a bit down to a large island with a ring. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is very earthy, with roast, malt, a little hop, leather, cocoa. Flavor's like nose and very well balanced regardless of its commanding designation. And all of the components of the aroma are magnified in flavor - BAM!! In some sort of odd way severe yet warm and welcoming. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, longish, slightly alcoholic, and moderately long. A beer to be reckoned with. And slurped."

"O - Really nice stout. Looks amazing. Only thing i was disappointed with was the mouthfeel. Missing that super creamy, velvety feel. But that seems like thats a big deal in the stout game. any rate, not a deal breaker in this brew."
"I'd say all in all a pretty damn good beer, but be fore warned alcohol wise it drinks small."
""
""
""
""
"Opaque black with a small, creamy head on top that sticks to the surface for the duration. Dark, vinous fruit aromas upfront...super dark chocolate, creamy malts, and slight coffee. Super dark, heavy, black malty flavor. Lots of dark cocoa and not too much sweetness or booze. Heavy, textured, chewy, and dry. A big, deliciously dark RIS..."
"overall an exceptional RIS that i will return to again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is very good but did not live up to the hype for me. The usual place I buy from sold 4 cases of this in about 6 hours. I had to go out of my way to find some and I'm glad I at least got the opportunity to try it. Its not Founders or Oskar Blues RIS but I enjoyed this one. Would love to try the bourbon barrel version of this, but I'm sure all of you would."

"O: extremely smooth beer. and i must say that at the alcohol is almost undetectable. just a freaking fantastic RIS. definitely need to get my hands on the BA version, bc I can't imagine how fantastic that one would be!"
""
"EDIT/Re-Review: enjoyed on-tap at Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale on 2/20/13. $8 for a 13oz. tulip. Not bad. This beer was better than I remember. Nothing that will blow your mind but it's a well-crafted, balanced, highly enjoyable RIS. The 12% ABV is barely noticeable and the rich flavors kept me craving a sip every few minutes. A very delicious sipper with all the great qualities of the style such as rich chocolate, dark fruits, woody/earthy flavors, and a hint of bitterness."
""
"Overall, I am impressed. This has been somewhat under the radar for me, and when the store tweeted out that it had it, I grabbed the 2 bottle limit. Glad I did that. We'll see what the other one tastes like in a few months to a year, but it drinks great fresh."
"Overall: Well done Dark Horse. I love the combination of the flavours and the mouthfeel. It really puts the malts out up front, and its still hoppy enough to balance it out while the entire combination goes down smoothly. The appearance and smell take second fiddle to the flavour and mouthfeel for sure. I'd like to try the BBPt5 just to see how much the mouthfeel improves! But in those departments I don't see much room for improvement- it's that good. I want to call this my RIS for the really dark, cold nights while Founders RIS is more of whenever I feel like a RIS. (4.25)"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great RIS. Up there with Stone's IRS and ten fidy. I would love the BA version."
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! This one has over a year of age in the cellar on it. Pitch black pour with a caramel colored head that lasts about 5 seconds with no lacing. The nose is a bit unique with a roasty maltiness and subtle sweet smokiness along with hints of soy sauce, molasses, black coffee, dark chocolate, and a touch of licorice. The taste follows suit with the sweet smokiness really showing up early along with black cherries, espresso, dark chocolate, booze, port wine, and licorice. Definitely a complex stout. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, smooth and oily, with a subtle creaminess and a nice warming alcohol burn on the finish. Overall, this is definitely a standout RIS. Big and complex and flavorful, but probably just a tad bit too sweet to put it in the elite category."

"O = Very tasty and surprisingly [ and dangerously :) ] drinkable for being such a high gravity beer"

""
"O = Extremely pleasant beer, very drinkable, much smoother as it warmed in the glass."

""
""
"O- Plead the 5th is absolutely delicious and definitely a beer I would recommend to anyone who claims to love imperial stouts. I really really wish I could get my hands on more of this because I would LOVE to see what happens with a little bit of aging. An absolute home run beer."
""
""
"Overall: What can I say, got this as an extra and it's blown me away. Can't find much wrong with this aside from the booziness at the end, but I'll bet that can be fixed with a year in the cellar. So damn good, and my first Dark Horse brew. Look forward to many more after this!"
"O) This is a fantastic Imperial Stout. The only thing I find myself upset about is the fact I only have three more bottles. If you are a lover of this style, you owe it to yourself to seek out this beer. Glad to recommend."

"Overall: The body of the beer is full and the finish is full. Ah a RIS, however it is not what I think is the greatest representation of this beer. When I want a RIS, I want a full body, thick, chewy, aggressive beer that ages like fine wine. This beer nails most of it but lacks just a little for my taste. Solid beer nonetheless, I am very greatful that I got to try it."
""

"It's very nice and smooth, and very drinkable. It's very tasty, while maintaining an edge of aggression. It ends up being a very nice, and very respectable package."

""
""
"O: A interesting IS has a lot of different tastes but it is well balanced and other then the slightly weird carbonation and lack of punch with the taste this is really good. Defiantly worth trying again not your average imperial stout which is always a welcome change from chocolate and coffee but those are the flavors i truly love."
""
"This is a rather well done RIS. Even for it's ample size it avoids excess. It demands a slow enjoyment, but an enjoyment it is."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another very good stout, this is a big beer at 12% so its a slow sipper. I have been saving this for a few weeks now and thought this would be the perfect time to have it. Not too familiar with Dark Horse Brewing, but I like what I have had so far!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A fantastic ris. Lots of chocolate which is never a bad thing for the style."
""
""
""
"Another brew that i would not be drinking unless Mulder1010 and this one ive been really looking forwards to which pours a dark black hue with a chocolate two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is booze,chocolate coated cherries,oak,dark honey,coffee and dark chocolate very enticing,the mouthfeel is just full bodied with minimal carbonation with tastes of dark rich chocolate,rich fruit pudding,dark expresso,roasted malts,dark fruits and finished just like a milky cappicino bittersweet and overall a very nice Imp Stout that i would drink again cheers."
""
""
""

"A real candy beer!"
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: What this beer lacks in aroma, it more than makes up for in taste. A really nice Imperial Stout. I can't taste the 12% at all! I would love to have the barrel-aged version of this beer. An outstanding representation of the style."
"Pours black with brown highlights and a thin mocha ring. Aromas of dark chocolate, bitter roasted malt, and a touch of caramel. Nice, but fairly typical of the RIS style. Taste is similarly middle-of-the-road, with more roasted malt, dry cocoa powder, espresso beans, and a long bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately creamy, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a tasty RIS, but nothing new."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - extremely solid Impy Stout. I could drink this all night, if there were more glasses available and I had a ride home. Very glad I was able to sample this one."
"Overall: Maybe a tad on the sweet side for some palates. Lives up to the reputation and great to have alongside the BB version to see what that did to the base beer."
"12 oz bottle shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a dark black with a small tan chocolate head that settles to a ring and leaves a decent lacing on the glass. The aroma has big roastiness, light coffee, dark bitter chocolate, and a bit of alcochol. The taste has some sweetness with dark roasty chocolate and some light coffee. The finish is bitter and roasty with a bit of alcohol. Very roasty overall. Medium body. Low carbonation."
""
"This is simply a fantastic imperial stout. I love the chocolate and sweetness, which comes close to stepping over the line, but backs off just a hair. Very happy I have several more of these, and I will most definitely be buying more."
"Damn, this is a fine brew. I thought putting it away for a little bit would mellow it out some, & while I haven't it fresh for comparison, I would definitely not call this 'mellow'. This is a big, serious, complex brew, both tasty & provocative. Again: yeeeaaaahhh."
"o - fresh is pretty damn good, but with a year or more on it this beer becomes something very different. very drinkable for the high abv %, though i think 2 in a night is all most people could handle. enjoyable fresh or aged and highly recommended. 4.0"
""
"O: elegant and smooth. Big feel and flavors combine for a great and enjoyable beer. Whether aged in a bottle or straight from the tap, this beer is a winner"
""
""
"I think at this point, I've had so many different really superb beers of this style that my expectations, and the overall standards, are quite high. This ris comes across as fairly one dimensional. Lots of molasses. More of a punch in the mouth than an interesting ride."
""
"This is better than some hyped, hard-to-get monsters of this style. Seriously. It's not mind blowing in any way, but it's decidedly ""imperial"" and very flavorful. So much chocolate! I must age this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prefer the bourbon aged version, but that's apples to oranges. This one is a tad on the sweet side, but still damn tasty with an excellent thick mouthfeel."
""
"Overall: A solid RIS, but no where near in the league of its big brother from bourbon barrels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours an inky black color with a brown head. The aroma has a lot of roasted malt, as well as some chocolate. The flavor is a little more complex. There is definitely a good dose of chocolate and roasted malt, but the dark fruit and alcohol also come through and add to the flavor. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice stout, glad I got to try it."
"Smell is very nice with some boozeyness. I like 'm this way. Soft and smooth with the alcohol well hidden! Thanks Jeff for this beer!"

"O: A well put together RIS. Well above average, hopefully I'll be able to try it again sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was a really good RIS. I would’ve liked to see a little bit more of a head and more lacing, but the thick consistency and jet black color were great. It smells and tastes a little bit on the sweeter side of the style, but very tasty. The mouthfeel is terrific. The alcohol is hidden amazingly for a beer with an ABV this high. I’ve been hearing about this one for a long time and I’m glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I love it, great taste, a smell that I seriously put my nose to the glass until the last sip. I love this beer so glad I got one in, ISO: again for sure."
"O - I find an unfavorable flavor amidst this one and I can't shake it. The look and mouthfeel are great though. Either this is better consumed fresh or it is a base beer that is made for barrel aging. Dark Lord is that way, so sometimes it just happens."

"Elite class RIS. Among your commons (and considering I haven't reviewed anything too super-rare in the style), it's the best there is. Better than Founders Impy. Better than Yeti. Better than Ten FIDY. Better than Old Raspy. A perfect overall rating if I may say so myself. 5.0"
"This was an awesome extra in a trade. If given the chance, I'll happily pick up a pack or two of this. I have to assume this has a little age from the rich creamy feel and well hidden alcohol. Big, bold, delicious- worth a try for any fan of imperial stouts. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor follows the aroma . Well balanced between the coffee, chocolate, toffee and black fruits. Some grassy hops and soy underneath. ABV is well hidden here. This a rich, but not overwhelming, beer. Slight bite on the end that lets the fruits snap away and the malt to linger a bit. Somewhat smoky."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good stout, but nothing special. Honestly, I expected a bit more given the reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-- Loved the BA treatment and this is good but probably a bit too young and slightly too sweet. or my palate is no longer American. Slow as heck sipper."
""
"If it wasnt for Siberian Night, this would be my favorite RIS."
"Update: I've since had the opportunity to go through a few more bottles of this, and it has really grown on me. Not sure why I was so ambivalent before. Rich, thick, brawny, pleasing, and decidedly old-school and true to style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of flavor in this beer! It's fairly easy to drink considering it's 12% abv. I have to put one in the cellar and see what happens in a year."
"Edit - 2 years later, and this is unequivocally my favorite non barrel-aged stout."
""
""
""
"O: A great stout; it’s a showcase for the often-limited smoke tastes of imperial stouts. Glad I had this fresh – some age would just empower the big ol’ booze character. Like I need any more excuses to drink the rest of my four-pack…"
"Poured into a 20 oz tulip glass. Pours pitch black, with a 3 inch mocha head, that leaves no lacing, and a thin layer of foam. Smell is very roasty dark chocolate and coffee, tobacco, leather, and molasses. Taste is all about the roasted dark chocolate and coffee, and I love that so much. Body is large, nice amount of life, not very dry for its style, and for 12% extremely drinkable. I am in love, this is my kind of stout, BIG and Roasty!"
""
"O: Extremely pleasant beer, very easy to drink, perhaps dangerously easy. Quite filling, almost like a meal. Not much more to ask of a Russian Imperial Stout."
""
"Overall: I see why BB Plead the Fifth is such a great beer. This base stout is a really wonderful and enjoyable beer! Dark Horse really brews a nice RIS here!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Take a standard English porter and then intentionally push it toward a stout via the malts. This is that beer. Delicious and very drinkable. I was very surprised to discover its 12% ABV, both because it came in a pint glass and because it's not at all that boozy or big-bodied. If I liked the stout end of porters, I could make this a regular."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a meal in a glass. So rich yet easy to drink. Highly recommended if you like this style and even if you don't!"
""
""
"I'm very impressed with this and hope to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have heard good things about this beer and finally got a chance to try it tonight. The aroma is impressive and strong, the way an RIS should be. Great roasty aromas, which carry over into the flavor. Taste is bold and powerful, with just a touch of booze. I was impressed by the beer as a whole and look forward to trying the Barrel aged version I have in my cellar. I wish we got Plead the Fifth in my area and if we did, I would get it often."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this could never be in my regular rotation as it was just a tad too sticky sweet for me especially on the finish. Still, I enjoyed it but it could never be something I would reach for on a regular basis."
""
""
"O- This is a monster dressed as a sheep. Big, bad and bold throw in the fact that it's 12% and you get one hell of a beer. Turn it into a beer that drink like none of that and you have danger in a bottle. I don't know if it's the age or the beer itself but it is remarkable."
"Overall: Very solid taste, tasty and complex but not overwhelming. Looks & smells wonderful. Mouthfeel provides for a nice drink. Obviously not sessionable but a relatively easy drink for a RIS. Nice. 4/5"
"O-Decent beer but I would prefer a slightly milder one if I had the chance. It tastes good but it is a bit much more me. I would drink it again but it goes better with cold weather."
""

""

"I've sampled the Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead at EBF, which is what prompted me to want to try this beer. From what I remember that beer had a little bit more flavor."

""
"O: Really good sipper. Going to be incredible with a couple years on it. Get this one, try it, and if you can resist let it sit."
"O: Not a very impressive Imperial Stout taste wise. Bitter and tastes somewhat like vomit. Not recommended. Try Dark Horse One, Too, Tres or Fore before this one. They're much better."
"Overall - I love this stout. The flavors are nearly perfect. Looks awful and doesn't smell anywhere near as good as it tastes, but damn it's good."

"O - A superb example of the style. Dangerously drinkable."
"overall: an excellent accomplishment by Dark Horse. Definitely recommend trying this one."

"it's a great feeling when a style that once confused and alluded my taste buds is now discernible. this ranks among my favorite RISs, although I will have to now revisit my other memorable RISs to better appreciate them again (or so i hope!)."
"Overall, a very nice imperial stout, masks its high ABV well even without aging. Wouldn't mind some more roasted flavor and a bit of carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - Great imperial stout that would benefit from some age. As it is, it is already robust, thick, and very smooth. I was a fan of Dark Horse's other stouts, but this is much more of a home run in every sense. I will try to find some of the barrel aged bottles as those are probably even better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good showing on the style. It didn't have the same appearance as say Founders Imperial but I think this brew controlled the high alcohol significantly better."
"O- very good RIS. the smoke/roastiness mixed with the sweet and dark fruits is just perfect. Have 1 bottle of the BA version that I can't wait to try!"
""
"Pours a thick, murky black sludge with an edge of copper clarity. A quickly dissipating finger of tan froth sits on top. Nice, subtle lacing. What I first notice on the nose are sweeter malts - caramel, toffee, brown and candied sugars, sweet booze, simple syrups, a bit of cocoa as it warms. The booze is very well placed on the tongue. Taste starts with burnt oak, then black cherries and caramel. Just a hint of black licorice if you really look for it. Really a unique flavor. The feel is nearly perfect and showcases the best of the beers base flavors. Overall, I would highly recommend this. This is one of the best ’non-specialty’ imperial stouts I’ve ever tried. Fantastic."
"O: This is a fantastic imperial stout. The Bourbon Barrel version is great because this is the base beer. A smooth, rich, and complex imperial stout. A truly great offering from Dark Horse."
""
"OVERALL: This was absolutely phenomenal. I’ve had a few other Dark Horse brews, all of which were mediocre compared to this monster of a delicious treat. Evil looking with a huge nose and flavor profile filled with everything I love about this style. Thick creamy palate gives the show a solid foundation as well. Perhaps a little weak up front and the booze might be slightly too forward, but this was awesome and I enjoyed it more than the 2011 bourbon barrel version we drank right after it. One I’d take anytime it was offered to me, no question. Thanks again for sharing Doops. Kick ass beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This has always been I beer that I've really enjoyed. This vintage bottle was great, fresher vintages are great, and I can't even imagine how the BA version is. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys bigger and more formidable stouts."
""
""
"O - I've had this one cellared for a few months and it's quite enjoyable. There's a cola-like sweetness throughout that at times is tasty but at other times annoying. Would kill to get my hands on the barrel-aged version."

""
""
"O - A very good stout. Would definitely recommend this one."

"O: This was a pretty good deal. Got it in a trade, but I believe it was less than $5 a bottle. For a 12% RIS this was great. You really can't tell the ABV is so high. Would definitely recommend this."
""
"O: Great beer that I have been wanting to try for sometime now. Now I just the BA version!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and quite bitter on the finish. Not as sweet as I thought it was going to be on the palate from the nose, the lead off is a little malt syrup, medium body, the beer thins at the back and finishes moderately bitter from the roast. Nice beer overall though."
"Cost: $11.99 for a four pack."

"O: a good imperial stout. A bit on the sweet side for me, but still good."
"Full bodied with average carbonation. There is a lot of alcohol heat with this beer, which is the main problem I have with it. The second problem is that this beer is too sweet, and too bitter. The aftertaste mostly is alcohol, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. This isn't a bad beer, but is a bit too hot for me to enjoy properly. Also not as well made as the best Russian Imperial Stouts. I should have let this one age a while before drinking it."

"Taste is decadent! Viscous chocolate malts mix with a burnt grain and robust raisin juice to mix all the delicious flavors of a deep, imperial stout with the smoothness of a silky oatmeal stout. Man, I was not expecting to be this impressed tonight, but this beer is de-lic-ious! I would absolutely love to be in the distribution range of this bad boy! 12%? No way! Sooo smooth. Im glad I drank it fresh(ish) rather than ageing it, as I think it cant possibly get any better than it tastes right now."

"O - This is a good imperial stout, but have to say I don't really understand the hype surrounding this one. The aroma completely doesn't match the flavors - wish they met somewhere in the middle. Balance seems a bit off...alcohol is dominating and heavy handed. It is fairly enjoyable, but when it comes to world-class RIS's this really leaves a lot on the table. Perhaps a bit of aging will smooth this one out a bit...fresh, doesn't live up to the hype/expectations I had coming into this."
"Dark and viscous with a thick sheet of chocolate head. Cocoa, tobacco, and light alcohol make up the nose.Taste is more of the nose with a long charred tobacco finish and noticeable alcohol. A near perfect thick and creamy body still make this beer enjoyable."
""
"One of the better RISs I've had. Really love how full the body is and the perfect balance of dry roast and sweetness. Would love to try the BA version of this."

"I came across a few bottles of this that has been aged for 1 year which I have been told is the best time to have it. To me this is the best stout on the market it is a mid-night black color pour with a deep brown colored head it is dark chocolate and coffee blended heaven that I could in no way be happier with."

"O - A delicious example of the style; well-balanced with complex flavors. Very satisfying."

"A big, intense Imperial Stout. Very good stuff, had been looking to try this one for some time. Could have used some more time to mellow out the heat, but on the other hand oxidation was setting in so I’m glad I cracked it open when I did."
"What else can I say, this beer was outstanding and highly recommended."
"Cheers..."

"O: This beer is damn delicious. It's a bit boozy at times, ans a bit sweet times, but it's fantastic. What an incredible beer. It's just right for the style. I'd drink this all the time if I could."
"a top notch imperial stout, really fits the RIS style so well. the aroma didnt really seem to fit the rest of the beer, but still top notch. now i really cant wait to try the BA version..."
""
""
"This is an excellent beer. I find the carbonation a bit odd, it's seems higher than it should be, but that seems contradictory considering the beer is silky smooth. Either way, it doesn't detract from the beer too much. Can't wait to see what age does to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is pretty fucking awesome. I'm really interested to try it fresh, cuz the age is apparent and great. I can't imagine it getting any better with any more age, so I think a year is about right on for this piece."
""

"D - Awesome; great dessert beer; good balance of roasted malt and dark fruit"

"Overall: It is a beer that is a bit of a sipper. The flavors are bold and in your face so be ready for it. Definitely recommended"
"o-quite good. one of the better non-barrel-aged stouts that i have had. i am really enjoying drinking and am excited for the second bottle surlytwinsfan sent me. thanks guys!"
"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for this one! Fifth in the series and fifth on the day! Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured pitch black with a minimal fizzy brown head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, subtle sweet alcohol, and subtle caramel. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma and flavors on this one were quite nice for a RIS. While they were not overly complex, they made this one quite enjoyable. The key thing for a RIS for me is if they can cover up the alcohol while still keeping it around as a more subtle flavor. This one did this quite well. A definite must try for any beer drinker out there."
"Weighing in at more like 14% abv, this incredible imperial stout packs in flavors such as tobacco, dark and milk chocolate, roast, smoke and more. With a nose that is reminiscent of dark chocolate smoke and tobacco this is sure to please any russian imperial stout enthusiast for sure. Some molasses in the finish."
"Overall: This is probably my favorite Imperial Stout ""in a bottle from the shelf"" (not counting barrel-aged and specials). First time I had it on tap at Radio Maria in Champaign, I thought I would faint. Gorgeous all around, and drinkable too, despite the ABV and huge body!"
"Drink- I like this one alot. For 12% this was smooth rich and creamy. A bit boozy but I like that in my high ABV stouts. Has a nice balance between the roast, chocolate and creaminess. I would love to see the BBA version. I bet its amazing. Kevin, again thank you for this one! Super tasty."
".Pours an opaque black with little lacing of tan head. Aroma is bittersweet with roasted malts and somewhat unsweetened chocolate and some plum. Tastes sweet and chocolaty with a hint of fig. Palate is slick and bitter. Overall this beer is quite drinkable for a 12% RIS."
"Overall, I think this beer is amazing. That said, I think we may be starting that awkward phase between fresh, and aged perfection. If what I've tasted is a sign of things to come, be prepared to have a masterpiece on your hands in a a while. I'll be (not so) patiently awaiting next year's release."
"Mouthfeel is really good. Really smooth, and even though the head goes away I think the carbonation level is ok, I think the 12% just mellows it out. Also has sort of a clean minty mouthfeel, not a minty flavor, but sort of after how you bite a York Peppermint Pattie, just not as strong. Not much of a bite from the 12%, well hidden. This is a really good beer, another grand slam from Dark Horse, a great brewery!"
"Overall- One of my favorite imperial stouts. If this were a limited, brewery-only release, it would be rated on par with Darkness, Dark lord, and Hunahpu's. As it is, I'll gladly let this one glide relatively under the radar which allows me to drink this readily. Absolutely delicious and a total treat whenever it's cracked open. Highly recommended."
"overall - I really like, very good RIS."
"mouthfeel/overall - smooth, medium to thick bodied (could use a bit of thickening) and good carbonation. i cannot ask for more out of an imperial stout (besides being thicker). a great body. i wish so bad i knew the age on this one, cause this is damn near perfect for an imp stout."
" Overall I did not expect this beer to this damn good. It definately exceded my expectations! Very complex. I will be getting a case of this no doubt. A must try. This could be one of my favorite beers."
"On tap a few nights ago at Green St Grill in Cambridge. Served in an 8oz snifter for $7.50. Dark brown color. Thin white head perched atop the glass. Dark chocolate and figs in the aroma. Taste was pretty amazing. Coffee, cocoa, and chocolate covered cherries were all up front on the palate, then the smooth malt coats your throat the end. Very surprised when bartender said it was 12%; very mild alcohol character. This beer was quite good, and it was a perfect dessert beer. Just wish I had a bigger glass."
"O: A very good Imperial Stout. The alcohol is present but not overbearing at all. Gonna be great with a little age. Would love to try the Bourbon Aged version."
"Overall: A little off-kilter this fresh. Loads of flavor and tons of complexity, but it fails to meld completely. With a year or two on this, it might just be that good."
"O - Awesome brew! Glad I got to try this one! Thank you for sending it awhile back Another6pack!"
"O: Outstanding!"
"Head fizzes out but beer is a healthy robust brown. Nose is chocolaty and a bit of dark fruit, some serious alcohol too. Taste has big velvet chocolate flavors, some pipe tobacco, pine resin hops and more dark fruit. Mild coffee. Very sweet, pretty hot. Still, it works. Mouthfeel is a bit hot but ultimately satisfying. This beer is stellar- a hefty, bold, no-nonsense RIS. One of Dark Horse's stronger beers. Would like to see this with some age on it."
"D/O- Woo! A sure-fire winner here. No wonder why the BA faithful regard this as one of the best (relatively) mass-produced Russian imperial stouts. First Dark Horse beer I've had that's been well above average. Thanks MammothBrew!"
"O - Overall I'm disappointed. I have had this one before and do not remember it being nearly this alcoholic, but this one was a booze bomb. I generally don't mind high ABV beers, but this one did not hide the alcohol well at all. I will revisit it after it has sat in the cellar for a couple years."
"O: this is a very good beer. wish I had more of this."
"This was a great stout and I am grateful for getting a bottle of it. The appearance and mouth feel were world class. Would love to try the BA version of this"
"The mouth is rich, but not overly so, and finishes with a bit of a sugary, sticky resin. Overall, a delicious, highly drinkable RIS that I'm very happy to have tried."
"2010 bottle. This one pours pitch black with a small tan head. The aroma is roasty with chocolate and carmel and molasses. It has a roasty and bitter chocolate taste with some hints of vanilla. This beer is nice, smooth, and hides the high alcohol really well."
"pours a brown-black with virtually no head. Smells like bourbon. Tastes like a strong stout mixed with bourbon, nothing too flavorful but respectful none the less. Certainly a good beer to sip a savor. Really shines on the mouthful as the flavor fully comes out and tastes really smooth for the whole time. Overall a better stout, certainly stronger and less chocolaty than I usually like but a great stout none the less."
"O - Another excellent stout from the folks at Dark Horse. I was a touch dissapointed by their IPA offerings that I have had, but the few stouts I have had have all been top notch."
"Overall: good looking, smelling and tasting, mouthfeel is on the strong side but it is an imp. stout so it's to be expected. Going to sit on my other bottle for awhile to see how it might change. This will be a regular in the winter rotation"
"O- This beer is really good, drinking it I had no Idea this was 12% abv, the alcohol is hidden well, easy drinkability, one of the best easy to find Imperial Stouts I’ve had."
"O: Decent sipper, but half the 12oz was just fine. I had split this with my wife, who enjoyed what she had as well. I was hoping for a bit more roasted chocolate malt notes, a bit less licorice, and a more creamy mouth, but it is above average, just not great to me, in my humble opinion. I am curious what the bourbon barrel aged version adds to this beer though."
"This pours a lovely jet black with about 2 fingers worth of gorgeous espresso foam that recedes quickly, leaving a thin layer atop the rest of the beer. One of the best smelling stouts I've ever had the pleasure of taking in. A rich, chocolaty, bourbon, vanilla nose that is just so intoxicating to inhale. The taste is just behind the nose, mirroring all of the luscious flavors represented in the nose. This is my kind of stout. A little boozy, thick, rich, and creamy. The mouthfeel is absolutely the BEST I've had in a stout. I can't stop taking mouthfuls and just...letting them rest in my mouth while I tongue all the incredible flavors and texture. Unreal. I have to get more of this. Fast."
"Drink and overall: Really enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable, quality impy. I had never had it before, so this was a treat. Would I buy it over Expedition Stout if it were same price, for a while yes."
"Edit: WOW! Just realized this stout is 12%. I would have never though it was...drinks more like 8-10% if that. Only a slight hint of alcohol. Super smooth. 4.5"
"D-This one is almost too easy drinking considering the body and ABV; the alcohol is barely present in the warmth I described in the mouthfeel and I'm used to a heavier feel with bigger beers. I want to like it, but I yearn for a some more complexity in flavors and a richer mouthfeel."
"Many thanks to GordianKnot for the chance to taste this one. a 12% imp stout bottle, no bottle date. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip glass. Pours a pitch black syrupy appearance. Barely any head (what you would expect from a beer this big). Smell- rich roasty maple syrup. Maybe some vanilla bean, some subdued chocolate flavor. From appearance and smell, it appears this one might have some time on it (yay!). Taste- Different flavors from what I would have expected. A roasty sweetness up front, some liquorice, sweet chocolate, not much bitterness at all. There is a creaminess to the mouthfeel, very little carbonation. Overall for the style, I would have expected more of a roasty possibly dark chocolate presence. I got almost too much sweetness from this one, and it kind of bugged me. Overall good though."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with a slow pour gave little head. Near black in color. Somewhat of a char-coal smell, hints of chocolate. Silky smooth, not heavy mouth feel. Plenty of coco, roasted flavors to cover the high alcohol. I left over smokey flavor in the end. Overall a very tastey easy to drink brew."
"O- This is a good RIS. Everything fell short compaired to the nose on this though. The tastes were not as pronounced, and the mouth was too light as a stout for my liking. But the masking of the booze and easy drinking nature make this beer above average."
"Like a baltic porter on steroids - one of the richest and purest Russian Imperial Stouts I've sampled."
"Overall very good beer. Easy to drink, I wouldn't mind putting down multiple bottles in one sitting. Good stuff."
"Overall: A very good take on a Russian Imperial Stout. Good balance of flavors and the 12% abv is hidden really well."
"Overall, it's a pretty nice example of this style, and I particularly liked the high ABV content. Who doesn't, right?"
"O: A really nice RIS, very drinkable for the abv. A very tasty beer, well done Dark Horse."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is damn good. It brings to mind Lost Abbey Angel's share, but a hell of a lot better value."
"O: Hands down one of the best stouts Ive ever come across. Which I had more than one bottle....will definielty buy again!"
"From notes 7/29/11. Wonderful stout. This beer is big and rich without any of the off-notes that can accompany that. The beer pours wall-to-wall black with a thin mocha head. The aroma is milk chocolate, dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, nutty roast, creamy coffee, vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is smooth and very full. Taste is sweet but not cloying. There’s a mildly bitter finish with roast and some earthy hops. A bit of a tannic quality, wine-like. This is a real treat and an excellent beer."
"Flat Black pour that has a thin dark brown head, no visible carbonation. Heavy chocolate aroma with accents of coffee, alcohol, and smoke. Flavor is a mix of heavily roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. A lot of depth and complexity to the flavor. Finish is loads of coffee and burnt malt. Full bodied with an oily texture and minimal carbonation. Everything you could want from an Imperial Stout."
"O - I really liked this one. It had all the typical flavors you would expect from a RIS but what really made it better was the creamy feel as it really helped to bring it all together. Good stuff."
"This beer pours very dark with a very impressive, darkened head; though I had to hard pour the beer. It smells of alcohol, chocolate, malt and raisin. It tastes as it smells and finishes with a sweet and thick lingering taste. The mouthfeel is thick and nearly chewy. A very good brew."
"Overall: Very well executed RIS. However, there are many similar ones on the market, and despite enjoying this greatly, I feel little need to have it again."
"Overall a nice beer I'd buy again."
"Pours a dark black, very thick pour with a paper thin mocha head. Aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate and a vanilla oaky note. I had to check to make sure this wasn't the bourbon barrel version because it has hints of bourbon. Taste follows the nose, so delicious, heavy but delicious. The nose is intensified with the taste. Mouthfeel is very thick but in a great way. This is a wonderful stout, I will be seeking out this beer!"
"O: im thankful for my currently half full barglass of plead the fifth. The great part of this well made stout is it shockingly spectacular delivery of the warming 12%abv. I highly recommend this to coffee afficianados."
"Overall: I’m usually very happy with Dark Horse’s beers and this one is no exception. I just wish that I had known what it was so I could have shared it with friends. If you get the chance I recommend picking one up, but it’s a sipper for sure."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, rather filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. This is a nice stout to enjoy a pint of."
"O- So, I gave this 4s across the board and a 4.5 overall. The reasoning is that for what it is, it is fantastic. And it is a big in your face, take no prisoners, RIS. The heat from the alcohol kept the scores down on smell and taste by a hair, but if you are in the market for a big, hairy stout, this is well worth the try."
"Overall-If this beer mellows out it could immediately become an A beer. The flavors are amazing, just wasn't fully ready."
"O. This beer has a great balance between the thickness I expect in a Imperial Stout, and being easy to drink. It doesn't feel overly filling, but has lots of bold flavors that really tingle the palate. I really enjoyed this beer, and am adding it to my list of ""to buy"" next time I'm at the store."
"Overall: Lots of heavy lingering flavors, but this is easily drinkable and very enjoyable. The 12% ABV, while very evident in the aroma, is well hidden within all the heavy chocolate. While the chocolate is on the bitter side, there is a bit of sweetness for balance."
"I loved Double Crooked Tree, and love this one too. Tastes like a combo between Imperial Stout and milk stout. Seek it out, definitely one of the best imperial stouts IMO."
"Overall: Definitely worthy of the praise this one receives. Chewy, malty, rich, imperial stout. Alcohol is well hidden. Thick, rich viscosity is one of my favorite aspects of this brew!"
"That was my original review, people have told me since that I must have got a bad bottle since that isn't how this beer normally is, so I made sure to grab a bottle of the 2013 release to give it a second a chance. The appearance is pretty damn nice, it's a little better than the 4 I gave it, the head and lacing were nice. The aroma was much more roasted then the first bottle I had, it had more RIS aromas and light amount of dark fruits, its like the opposite of the first bottle I had, but the biggest problem is the harsh alcohol aromas that remind of of cheap vodka, the aroma is better than the 2.5 i first gave it, but it's not much better. The taste is better and more RIS like it, it had a nice roast to it, the alcohol was hidden ok, it wasn't harsh but it was pretty warming, better than the 3 I first gave it, it taste like a good RIS. The mouthfeel was better than the 3 I first gave it, it was pretty true to style. I must have had a bad bottle because this one is much different and much more RIS like. The drinkability isn't the best I don't think I would want another one. This was a solid RIS, but not a favorite Founders Imperial Stout is still my number one. A good RIS, that I recommend try, but I don't think it worth the trouble of seeking out."
"A great RIS overall. Combined with Tres, I'm now 2/2 in really liking the beers from this series."
"A nice stout, I'd be very curious to compare to the barrel aged version. I'll continue to pick this up every year upon its release."
"Not many beers pour as dark and thick -- beautiful from my perspective. The first taste is good, but some unusual flavors are present which caused me to ponder if I was going to like it. After a sip or two, the taste buds get acclimated and the unusual flavors recede into the background. Overall I'm still left with a bitterness which I don't care for. I don't think it's a coffee bitterness ... seems like the hops are shouting out."
"Overall, this was good. Not something I'd seek out, but if one lands on my doorstep again, I wouldn't be disappointed. I'm very happy I got to try this. I am actually very curious how the BA version would be."
"The CPJ"
"Very good beer, glad I finally made contact with it."
"O - Overall, this is an excellent imperial stout. However, it's a little hot at the moment, but I'm sure after about a year or so, it will be sublime. Good job, Dark Horse."
"Overall this is a fantastic RIS, one thing that I love about this beer is that I can walk into the store anytime I want it, pick up a bottle and not have to worry about aging it first. I am defiantly going to be drinking this one on a regular basis."
"O – This is a beast of flavors. Has all the great qualities of a good RIS. The ABV is certainly present but it is not overpowering. Still it’s a sipper and a fine one at that."
"Overall -- For such a big beer in the middle of a hot summer, I really enjoyed all aspects of it. I've had higher ABV beers you could gulp through, but this was a definite sipper -- and I enjoyed this. I would get it again, though I'd really like to try a version BA as vanilla notes would really open the taste up further."
"Overall a solid RIS. I'd opt for an Expedition stout over this but I would imagine the BA version of this is stellar. A little hard to come by so I probably wouldn't seek this out again as I can pick up a sixer of Expedition about 5 minutes away whenever I want. I'm curiously how an aged bottle of this be as it's currently drinking a little hot."
"Good mouthfeel, smooth on the tongue and senses but very bold, especially after temp increases. Excellent sipper. Powerful brew."
"5) Fore--Smoke"
"O - A very good RIS, but there are others that I prefer over it. I'd be interested in trying the bourbon barrel aged version of this to see how it compares because I really enjoy bourbon barrel aged stouts. Thanks to Andy (pest) for sending a couple bottles of these in a recent trade!"
"Overall- A very solid imperial stout, with great fruit elements poking through. Going to age the rest of the 4 pack and I am expecting great things, and much less heat (taste and feel scores should go up). A may be kicking myself for not buying more of this when it was around."
"D - I'll get this again in a heartbeat. This is a beer everyone should try at least once. This is impressive. It tastes like it should be 500 calories."
"D - This is a top of the line Russian Imperial Stout... No criticisms and lots of really good things happening... Hides the 12% ABV rather well... I'm continually impressed by the offerings that Dark Horse puts forth... I look forward to drinking this again and highly recommend it to fellow BAs..."
"Good burnt malt flavor, but it is compromised by the thinner body. This may be because of the very high alcohol. Elements of coffee and nearly no notable hop bitterness."
"O:  Plead the Fifth rightfully belongs to the trilogy of Michigan Russian Imperial Stouts, which also includes Bell's Expedition Stout and Founder's Imperial Stout. It is more daring and complicated, though. Not as traditional. "
"Re-Review: Appearance is the same as above but everything else is different. Big milk chocolate and coffee on the nose. Palate is rich and thick with tons of roasted black coffee beans, grounds and brew. Bitter/dark chocolate, earthy moss and top soil, lots of tanned leather and cocoa nibs. Long finish. Delightful. Sucks that I had an infected bottle the first time. The score reflects the good bottle, but the overall score is lowered due to lack of coding and the off-bottl.e"
"O- Unlike some Russian Imperial Stouts, this one doesn't seem like it needs any time put away and is great now. Great drinking and would suggest this to anyone."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace form randomly on the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits (raisins/plums), dark roasted malt, slight chocolate, and slight soy sauce. Taste is of the dark fruits, dark roasted malt, and slight cocoa powder. Slight roasty bitterness on the palate quickly fades. This beer has low carbonation and is thick in both the pour and the mouth. Overall, this is a good RIS with a more fruit and malt forward flavor. I am glad I got to try this one."
"O: This is an exceptional non-BA imperial stout.  There is a lot going on in the aroma and taste, and the mouthfeel is spot on.  I've had my eye on this for a while, largely due to some of the hype surrounding the BA-version, and this version is better than I had expected.  I'm really glad to have gotten a chance to try this and will try to get my hands on another bottle or two down the road.  "
"5/3/2011"
"Pours black with a thick motor oil consistency, reddish tan ring of head. You know when you make chocolate milk with Hershey's syrup, and when you're done drinking the glass there's still some syrup at the bottom? The bottle has this. I thought maybe this was a chocolate stout, but I don't see any indication of that. Smells like sweet malt, chocolate syrup, and a little cream and vanilla. Has a nice fresh smell to it. Really nice, based on the smell I can't wait to take a sip. Taste is sweet Hershey's syrup up front, roasted malt, a little bittersweet cocoa and smoke on the finish. Full bodied and mouth coating, nice medium-light carbonation, warming from the alcohol. Overall, a delicious, big, sweet stout, about as drinkable as you could hope for given the parameters of the beer."
"O- Very solid and tasty beer. Nothing I can say bad about it, very much enjoyed it. Would LOVE to try the BA version of this. If not, would drink this anytime. Thanks Kyle!"
"A very solid stout and a very strong one coming in at a heavy 12%, still big even in 2011. Dark Horse knows how to make a stout, I hope they do more with their numbered series because they were all pretty nice."
" The mouthfeel of this beer, however, is not up to the taste. Hell no! Thin and harsh instead of being silky, this beer could be in BCS territory with its taste it has but its body seems short of supporting it. Overall very good in spite of a few shortcomings here and there."
"Definitely good. Not top tier, but high up there."
"Pours a solid black with a minimal tan head that dissipates quickly a leaves no lace. Smells of licorice, molasses, bitter dark chocolate, dried dark cherries covered in vodka, a bit earthy herbal hops in there somewhere too. Taste is tart dark fruit drenched in dark chocolate and dipped in rum or vodka. Espresso and an earthy hop bit round this one out. Leaves a lingering roasted grain char mixed with some sweetness that linger long after every sip. I'm kind of amazed that the depth of flavors in this brew meld together so well. Sweet sticky almost syrupy mouthfeel. Light level of carbonation and a thick body. I really enjoyed this one. Really thick and sweet but incredibly tasty. Shit I'm thinking about pouring this over some vanilla ice cream in a few."
"Thanks Steve!"
"O: A very solid RIS overall. Seems a very true to style brew and I enjoyed it."
"O- Great beer, everything works well together."
"I'm starting to notice a trend with Dark Horse in that many of their brews aren't over the top, but many are done in a classy way. I think they're going to fall into breweries that I trust enough to buy without looking into their beers beforehand. Wish I picked up more of this."
"O/D-I would probably enjoy this one a bit more in the colder weather months. Nevertheless, this chocolate-prominent stout is an ass-kicker and a tasty feast. This is a beast. I cannot even fathom what the Barrel Aged Version of this tastes like; must be why its considered a rare gem. This brew is also relatively affordable for the style coming in at about $3.80. Dark Horse is a great company; this brew is hard-nosed evidence of that."
"O: It's like a chocolate dessert drink for adults. This has become my favorite Imperial Stout, hands down. It's not very complex but it's straight to the point. Also, the high ABV is hidden pretty well. Nice job Dark Horse!"
"Cheers!"
"O- the taste puts me off a little bit...it's ""too much"". But this is still a fantastic beer"
"another amazing stout from Dark Horse. though crooked tree and double crooked tree are both good beers, their stouts is what I know them for, and rightly so. They all have similar qualities which define Dark Horse's style."
"This is a pretty solid stout. I enjoyed the pure ""heaviness"" of this beer, but it seemed to come up just short of epic in my opinion. Damn good beer, though."
"overall this is an outstanding imperial stout. not without flaws, but very, very good... the prototype of a sipper."
"12oz bottle poured pitch black into a pint glass- espresso-esque crema like head. Very fine bubbles. A thick layer of sediment remains on the bottom of the bottle, and looking down the neck into the bottle indicates that it as well is impenetrable by light. Very rich, smooth chocolate boozey aroma. The flavor of this beast is astoundingly smooth despite the 12% label... rich toffee, caramel, and chocolate are prevalent as hops are muted. Mouthfeel is amazing and perfectly appropriate for a good RIS. Overall this beer is outstanding, and I will write a more detailed review next time since im already getting slurry."
"Overall - I am thoroughly happy with this one and can't say enough about how much the chocolate throat coating stands out to me. I shall have this one again!"
"Future outlook: I am duly impressed. Some of these will be socked away in the cellar for future consumption."
"Reminds me of a slightly bigger Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Tasty but I prefer some more complexity. 12oz went down quickly considering the ABV."
"This beer pours out as a very dark black color with a really nice creamy brown head on top. The smell is highly roasted and has a slight herbal aroma with some dark chocolate. The taste has a really nice licorice flavor to it with the roasted malts and chocolate all mixed into one. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and rich. Overall the beer is actually really really good. Really worth a try if you see it!"
"O - A good beer, not overwhelming but solid. It is a bit harsh/hot but some age might help that. No vintage dating I could find on the bottle. I'd have it again but won't be actively seeking it."
"O: A malty yet balanced experience. A “big” beer, not an everyday thing."
"Viscous but creamy, I found it slightly overcarbonated to be anything better than good in the mouthfeel department, but let's be honest. This is a phenomenal imperial stout, and in my opinion, the best base Dark Horse stout that I have enjoyed. Its complexity, balance, and ability to not completely crush the drinker with alcohol make this one a winner."
"Since they make no mention of abv on the packaging,"
" I would have thought this beer was under 9% ABV if the label didn't say otherwise. More please..."
"D: Solid imperial stout, if not the best imperial stout I've ever tasted. I would definitely buy it and drink one again. It's a perfect stout for someone who appreciates the darker beers."
"D: Overall this is a solid beer. It had an aroma that can be picked up from across the room and the flavor is just as good. Now I just need to get my hands on the barrel aged version."
" This was a really great beer. One of the perfect sipping beers. It would work great on a cold day."
"O - This is a great RIS. Delicious, sweet, chocolate, roast and dark fruits are present all over. The booze is present but is not too intense and its well hidden. Delicious brew."
"D - Well balanced example of RIS, not cloying anywhere and I didn't find it chewy at all compared to some other big stouts. Alcohol is totally masked."
"Overall -My first review! This beer and the rest of the Dark Horse stouts deserve more hype so I feel compelled to review. Excellent value at under 10 bucks a four pack. The bottle art is great -looks like outsider folk art. This RIS can stand with the best of them!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass. Pours opaque oily black leaving very little brown lacing throughout the session. Sweet, roasty malt aroma this bursting with lots of silky chocolate as well as some oatmeal, roasted coffee bean, toast and nut. There’s also a slight lactic cream presence but the nose of this beer is all about roasted malt and chocolate. Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a slightly chewy, viscous consistency. Deep roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee/espresso bean, oatmeal, burnt toast and toffee. This is complimented by a sweet chocolate malt presence and subtle creaminess. There’s also some earthy hop bitterness and a prominent alcohol burn in the finish. The ABV isn’t well masked with a ton of heat and warmth in the finish. I expect that this will tone down with age but this fresh bottle is too hot for my liking. Dry boozy finish. A little disappointment for me."
"This was a fantastic find. An excellent, easy drinking stout. They did an amazing job of blending the dark chocolate and vanilla together to where they both are easy to pick out but mix together OH SO WELL! Although the booze becomes more apparent once this stout warms up, it does no harm to this stout whatsoever. Will be going out of my way to find some more for sure. Extremely pumped that I got 2 bottles!"
"D/O - Drinkability is high for this one. I really enjoyed drinking this after finally coming across some bottles. Make no mistake, you won't be quaffing this one down, but each sip will be savored. There is some alcohol here, but is masked and washed away nicely by the other flavors. I would love to try the barrel-aged version of this but it's looking like a longshot!"
"O-Totally lives up to the hype. Very happy I got to try this."
"O: It's hard to make an impression in a market saturated with great Imperial Stouts, but this one delievered. I would love to try the bourbon-aged version of this one."
"O: A nice stout that I would love to have on hand regularly in the winter time. Tons of great flavors and a nice amount of complexity without ever being overwhelming. Nicely done!"
"Pours a dark oily black with a tan mocha head and some foam. Aroma full of roasted malts, vanilla, cocoa nibs and espresso. Well rounded roasted malt flavor, follows the nose with some cocoa and coffee flavors. Hop character is earthy and minimal. Alcohol well hidden. Overall, I really liked this stout, drank very easily for its size. Recommended."
"Overall a wonderful beer, definitely the best Dark Horse offering I have had to date. I can only imagine how amazing the barrel aged version of this is."
"O: A GREAT example of a true RIS. In this day when so many breweries are adding adjuncts to their RIS its nice to drink a wonderful example of the true style."
"O- Usually I give an overall score based on the scores that I've given in the 4 categories, but this beer brings everything together exceptionally well. I'd like to do a side by side with Ten Fidy, I'm not sure I could tell the difference. Quite a good brew, this one will likely be harder to find next year."
"An excellent, excellent beer."
"One of the darkest stouts I've seen, the color is pitch black and the head is dark brown. A healthy pour produces a huge had that holds relatively well. smell is of roasted malt and chocolate. I can also get a little waft of the booze coming up. taste is bitter, with strong chocolate notes and big maltiness. big, thick mouthfeel this is probably one of the thickest stouts I've had. Alcohol is hidden well, especially given the ABV, although there is a slight warming effect to let you know it's there. Overall, I'm impressed with this one. The flavor is a bit more abrasive than I normally enjoy, but this is a huge stout so I can't really knock it for that."
"For me, imperial stouts live or die by their body and this does not disappoint. It warms beautifully; One of the best stouts I've had in recent memory. I would LOVE to try the barrel-aged and sour versions!"
"SkÅL!"
"Great job, Cheers!!"
"Overall this is one of the best non barrel aged stouts that I have had, it is simply delicious. I am definitely going to seek out more of this one."
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a slightly chewy, viscous consistency. Deep roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee/espresso bean, oatmeal, burnt toast and toffee. This is complimented by a sweet chocolate malt presence and subtle creaminess. There's also some earthy hop bitterness and a prominent alcohol burn in the finish. The ABV isn't well masked with a ton of heat and warmth in the finish. I expect that this will tone down with age but this fresh bottle is too hot for my liking. Dry boozy finish."
"overall - delicious, glad i picked up 2 bottles, other one is going to be tucked away for at least a year probably more to see what it turns into, enjoy one fresh and tuck the rest away for a while"
"O- One of the better Imperial Stouts out there that you can actually find on the shelves. Not really a budget beer but it wont break the bank either."
"Great job Dark Horse! Just about everything I love about this style could be found in this beer. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Poured opaque brown-black with a healthy mocha head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles. Dark chocolate, coffee, roasty malts in the nose. Big tastes of dark chocolate and coffee, also ash and licorice, and some alcohol bite. Full body, bitter, with a bitter aftertaste. Pretty easily drinkable for a high alcohol beer."
"(120ish)"
"This is definitely my favorite from Dark Horse. This is an easy A. Highly recommended."
"O- Overall this a very nice RIS with a great flavor profile."
"Overall Wow just wow! So big! So smooth! Such a great brew! A real treat of a beer that hopefully I can find around town next year as craft beer continues to grow."
"O - I'm enjoying this beer quite a bit right now the taste is making it a little too easy to drink this is a beer to look out for to try"
"Overall: A great offering from Dark Horse, great smell and good flavors and a body that matches the style quite well. Being a bit heavier and clocking in with that big ABV, consumption would be a little limited, but this would be a great dessert beer."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one and will need to get more from my buddy in MI (thanks splax23). This must be fantastic with a bourbon barrel aging. Great base beer."
"Very nice color when pouring it from the bottle to my mug. Small carmel colored head. The nose wasn't as strong as I was epecting, but coffee was out front. Nice taste, can really taste chocolate and coffee, but was lighter than i expected, but may be due to drinking many bourbon barrel aged stouts the last few nights. This had a little more carbonation than the stouts that i am used to from a strong stout. I can really catch the hops on the finish and the aftertaste lingers nicely of coffee. This was my only bottle and i do look forward to getting more of it."
"O: pretty good. better taste than most imperial stouts, mouthfeel is the only downfall of this beer. I would like to try the bourbon barrel aged Plead the 5th, it may be a bit less fizzy."
"Overall, this is a fine stout...should be up there with the best of them. I would love to try some of the other treatments they do with this beer. A top-notch ale...delicious and quite a treat."
"O- A fantastic Imperial Stout that is a little one dimensional in taste, but completely makes up for its shortcomings with a mouthfeel that is one of the best I've had in a long while."
"Overall, i love the cards being played here but aging will improve this beer by lowering the highly noticeable heat. I cant wait to try it again next time this year ( if i dont finish the other 5 bottles)."
"O: A fairly solid stout all around. Full mouth, great flavor. Not the greatest though, and perhaps a little rough around the edges, but I would definitely have another one of these again."
"O (D) - There are so many exceptional beers in this style (that I've tried), that it's hard for anything to stand out. This isnt the best RIS I've ever had, but its certainly comparable to many of the excellent ones I've had."
"O: Fantastic flavor, great nose and excellent body. Bitterness, astringency, chocolate and coffee flavors all coming through in proportion. 3 more to try with friends down the road, I would definitely trade for again. Wish the BA version was not so limited."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. In the aroma, roasted malt, coffee and a sweetness that reminds me of oatmeal. In the taste, sweet roasted malt and a dry coffee ending. A small hop bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee and a small alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Nice big flavor, big roast, nice coffee presence and hides the 12% very well."
"O- Probably the best RIS I've had to date. Drinks amazing for a 12% beer. Will buy all I can get my hands on."
"Full bodied and carbed, thick creamy and sticky. Great flavor with chocolate in the forefront, a bit boozy but not out of control. I'd definitely drink this again."
"This is by far one of my favorite Imperial Stouts, and relatively inexpensive (compared to other IS). It's also a bit easier to get a hold of, although the store I bought my 4-pack from was limiting 1 per customer. This beer is pretty dangerous though, because it's very drinkable (considering the thickness), and you definitely cannot taste the 12-14% ABV - so be careful with this guy!"
"An inch of light brown head settles to a thin layer. Almost completely disappears after a minute. Very dark black body. Smells like cocoa powder. Not a lot to the aroma. Roastiness in the flavor that I didn't get in the aroma, quite a bit of bitter cocoa."
"Overall -- Great imperial stout. Stellar rich malt notes, and great depth. The finish had a bit more burnt char acridity than I would like. Otherwise the beer was amazing. This would be worth buying by the case. Quality for certain."
"The beer is black with a thick, beige head that plasters the glass in lacing. Can't ask for more than that. The aroma is of roast, oak, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor is extremely roasty, with a slightly burned malt character. The feel is full bodied, with alcohol presence there, but not overwhelming. Good stuff."
"M= Thicker than most beers with this much alcohol. Some stronger stouts seem to be to thin, but this one holds up. It lingers in my mouth leaving the great taste to stay around."
"Well worth having! I continue to be impressed with Dark Horse."
"Overall: At 12% ABV, this drinks like a pilsner (in terms of quaffability). Simply outstanding brew. I am a fan of RIS's, and this one fits into the category splendidly. GOOD job, Dark Horse."
"D- Fantastic. One of the more tasty imperial stouts I've had the delight to drink. The alcohol is hardly noticeable. This could have a 20% abv and still be delicious."
"O: This is a sipper and not just due to the alcohol level."
"EDIT - A year later and I've had this several times. Fresh, this is the best RIS from MI that I've had. Expedition is better after a year, but fresh this beats that and Founders."
"Highly recommend this one!"
"In a state which does not take their Imperial Stouts lightly Dark Horse holds it own. I do not find it quite as enjoyable as Bell's and Founders offerings but Plead the Fifth is far better than the majority of the RIS's out there. Very drinkable for such a big beer. The booze does make its presence known but does not become obstructive. Definitely one worth seeking out."
"This is just disappointing. It should have lot going for it, but it's thin, a little hot, kind of ashy in the end, and basically a raisenette beer. So it goes."
"Overall it's quite enjoyable actually, interesting take for such a big abv."
"Pleasure to sample and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but 11.2oz. really should be split w/ a good BA buddy IMO."
"The beer pours like motor oil, only a deep impenetrable black color leaving only a rumor of a head around the edges of the glass. The aroma is rich, roasty, and malty with a lot of coffee and some bourbon boozy notes with some deep chocolate of both the sweet and bitter variety. The flavor is again very rich with (again) both sweet and bitter chocolate notes. The beer is not nearly as sweet as most of this strength or viscosity. There are plenty of coffee and boozy tones in this one as well. The palate is profoundly full and sticky. Delicious."
"-Gfunk"
"drinkable - nah, not really."
"Thanks, warbird07 for this one. Poured into snifter. Pours pitch black with very little head and no residual lacing. Smell is spectacular dark malts, chocolate, molasses, raisins very faint ethanol. Taste chocolate, coffee, raisins, sweet malt, tobacco, the ethanol is very well hidden considering the abv. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, almost creamy, faint carbonation. Overall a very solid RIS, underrated if you ask me. This beer is way to easy to drink which is dangerous at this abv. I definitely recommend this one."
"d- not a bad beer by any stretch, but a sipper for sure at this strength and because of the massive flavors it packs, i've got another one i'm popping in the cellar to see how well it fares with a bit of age on it."
"D: This is a strong and slightly boozy beer but it is complex with lots of subtle nuances making this one hell of a sipper"
"m/d - Tonight is/was an evening for big stouts and this beer...I had some high expectations for and it stepped to the plate and slammed it out of the park on the first pitch. Mouth is crisp and it is smooth, silky and easy to drink. Flavor is strong dark chocolate...a bit on the heavy side, but you'd expect that at 12%."
"Drinkability is high as this is one of the best off the shelf easy to get IS I have had."
"Pours pitch black. Incredibly dark with a bit of light brown head. Looks stunning! Smells fruity and chocolatey. There is a hint of roastiness on the nose but most of what I get is dark fruits. Tastes similar. Dark Fruits, molasses, chocolate, roast, a TON going on. Very well balanced for something so complex. Thick on the tongue and pretty boozy. Drinkability suffers a bit but overall a nice sipper"
"The unassuming little bottle pours out a thick black concoction with a brownish tan head that falls rather quickly, leaving moderate lace behind. Copious amounts of yeast sediment remain in the bottle, this could either be good or bad depending upon how the yeast reflects in the glass. Smell is dark coffee and not much else, possibly some slight caramel in the back. First taste has this malt forward brew brining the malt bitterness of black patent roasted malt, followed by a subdued sweetness and an even more subdued smokiness which is a nice surprise. Yeast is barely detectable in this cornucopia of flavors, all jockeying for my attention; this is so much that it takes me a quarter of a glass before I even find the alcohol (12%), and even then it is perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel of this beer is something somewhat of perfection- it keeps the malt char, sweetness and smokiness all in line and playing beautifully with eachother on my palate. The carbonation is perfect, and I can see now why there was so much yeast sediment- as to even reach this modicum of CO2 a damn near entire yeast starter slurry is needed to survive the flavor and alcohol. Very drinkable, I wish I had more of it here in the PNW."
" so good, but a tad too pronounced with its boozy warmth to earn a 'perfect' score. Whatever ~ it's damn awesome, a lovely example of all that I love in a Russian Imperial. I've sipped for a while now; my conclusion: I DEFINITELY want this again! My overall score doesn't entirely reflect how 'WOW-worthy' this is. Forgive the label critique: this is a pretty amazing beer."
"This pours into my snifter an oily midnight black with a dark, dark khaki head that quickly dissipates and laces the glass. The aromas are of oak, bitter chocolate, and a considerable amount of alcohol. The 12% is very present in the nose. The flavors are of conflicting chocolate (both sweet and bitter), oaky smoke, and alcohol. It's good but not as good as it could be. The strongest aspect of this beer has got to be the mouthfeel. It drinks exceptionally smooth and also lighter than it looks. It's velvety smooth. Overall this is a very fine beer but it misses on a few levels. The amount of alcohol present in the nose and flavor is a slight turnoff. It's 12% and you know it. It's good but powering through a four pack of this would be quite difficult but one or two is just fine."
"D: Very easy to drink considering the style and ABV. Not nearly as roasty as some others I've had in the style. You really don't notice the 12%. This is a good beer that I'd drink again if available but won't go out of my way to get"
"D -- a little hot even for a high abv imperial stout, richness limits drinkability."
"Very, Very smooth for 12% ABV, so=Very Easy To drink.."
"D: Pretty tasty although the bitterness may turn off some. The high alcohol makes this tough to drink more than one."
"Very low carbonation with an ashy mouthfeel."
"D-Very good for a RIS, but not great. I like this and wish it were available in the PNW since offered as a single 12 oz. bottle."
"D. Goes down easy for 12%. This beer hides it abv very well. Kind of a contradiction between the smell and the taste, smell is not big on the coffee but the taste was pretty coffee heavy. Al in all this is a pretty damn good Imperial Stout."
"D - You really start to get the 12% out of this about a quarter of the way through. It's a good beer, but a bit hot, and not outstanding. I'd drink it on occasion if available, but nothing particularly special."
"D- This is a very good, classic RIS. The alcohol is very well hidden here and the mouthfeel is fantastic. Very well done by dark-horse. Although I either traded for this bottle or received it in a LIF (so its been in the cellar for about a yr) Im excited they are finally shipping to Pittsburgh and can't wait to try some more of their brews."
"d - A very good RIS. I really liked the smell and mouthfeel. Wish the taste was a little less bitter but still very good. Would definitely like to try it again and would love to try the barrel aged version."
"All in all, this is a wonderful RIS. I had never even heard of Dark Horse before and was glad I wandered into Teresa's on a night they had this on tap."
"I looked forward all day to having a beer after work and I'm really glad I chose Plead The 5th. Thanks again Jeff."
"This beer was tasty but one for the night was good enough. There's a lot of flavor and a decent amount of alcohol so its not one to take lightly."
"D: For a 12% beer, this one is pretty mellow and easy to drink. Definitely one of the better ""regular"" imperial stouts out there."
"D - pretty decent RIS. I would put this as above average but nothing that blew me away too much. Another solid stout in Dark Horse's lineup."
"I would get this in a bottle if it were available to me where I lived."
"This is going down way to easily."
"O - I want to love this one, but like almost everything I have from Dark Horse, there's always something getting in the way. It just seems heavy-handed to me. Nothing subtle in this one at all. I had a KBS immediately before this one, and while that might be setting the bar a little high, it reminds me what a world class stout tastes like. This isn't it."
"D - Although I loved it I had to keep it at 1 and would be suprised if others could do more. The sweetness sweetness is very desirable however can become overwhelming."
"D - dangerously good. This one lacks the espresso/hop bitterness I've come to expect from big IRS, especially ones at 12% ABV. Very grateful I got the chance to try this beer."
"The mouthfeel is thick and heavy with low carbonation. Pretty much exactly the way I like my big stouts. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and was a pleasure to sip on this evening. A very enjoyable beer overall."
"D - the heaviness of the flavor and feel, plus the brim from the alcohol make this a short drinker."
"I expected this to be full bodied because of the pour, but it actually thins out some. The mouth has low carbonation, which I appreciate for the style, but it's not heavy or thick. Could stand a tweaking here. With a big beer like this, the body needs to match the heavy color and ABV. The flavors meld together well and make up for what's lacking in the body. Lots of bitter dark chocolate, cold coffee, almond, and the finish is hintingly tart. I like this. It's an easy sipper, dare I say gulper, since the body is more on the thin side. But, beware, the ABV is on the high side. Not bad at all."
"Drink: nice flavors, great mouthfeel, good balance. Alcohol's a little heavy, but would I have it again? I plead the fifth. And by plead the fifth, I mean yup."
"Drinkability: Danger Will Robinson."
"Pours a very black, motor oil like color with a small 1 finger dark brown head that recedes quickly but leaves lacing down the glass. There is a big chocolate mousse aroma with some espresso like characters and a touch of vanilla. Big. The flavor has a big chocolate, malty and espresso body to it. Very well hidden 12 percent abv and a great undertone of vanilla coming on the finish. Smooth drinking with a Graham cracker breadiness to it. Mouthfeel is slick and viscous, perfect with a cheesecake. Overall this is a very drinkable high abv bottle of beer. Great beer!"
"This is very enjoyable, like everything from Dark Horse. Though a bit to astringent, and not as complex as other examples of a RIS. Basically the same thing as the Fore Smoke Stout, but with a ton more alcohol. Something that is still very much worth a try though."
"D - A sipper for sure. A nice dark chocolate flavor dominates this one on top of all the other normal flavors you will find in a RIS. I would pick this up if I saw it on the shelves just to see how it aged. Certainly a solid RIS as is though."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with bitter note and very subtle coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by roasted bitter notes with light dry coffee notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed though it doesn't really stand apart from good imperial stout out there."
"Overall, a very impressive RIS."
"D: it drank really good and was very tasty I hope I can get my hands on some more of this delectable beer."
"This weighs in at 12%, and is slightly hot. Aside from that, a very good stout."
"The soft carbonation is perfect for the style. This is a huge beer, and thus not very drinkable, but I will enjoy the hour or so it will take to drink this one for what it is. I will definitely try this one again."
"D - Doesn't drink like a 12%, so I'd say drinkability is good. Wouldn't want to have more than a couple in a night. Make this one a sipper."
"i have to go to Michigan and taste the barrell age version before I die...preferably much sooner than that."
"D - Way, way too easy to drink for 12%. The lack of any additional kinds of gimmicks (flavoring, barrel aging) make this one of my favorite strong stouts."
"I really like this. Glad it's a 12oz bottle as I can play in this one for quite some time. I'll pick this one up again. Nice beer."
"MF/D: light tingling sensations with each sip, increasing boozyness as it warms. could've/should've cellared longer."
"d-could cellar for a bit longer. stiff. but there's a good profile behind it. thanks to primetime3882 for the excellent extra"
"D: The ABV and long finish keep it to sipping, but it's by no means a tough drinker."
"Pours a very dark brown, black color, with a small but firm dark brown head. Aromas of black licorice, molasses and a bit of vanilla. Somewhat bitter on the palate, with more licorice, chocolate and alcohol. I can't place my finger on it, but I just don't like it."
"M + D: Carbonation is a bit light, which isn't hugely surprising in such a big beer. Body is surprisingly smooth. A lot (most, really) of the high alcohol stouts tend to have big bitter, charcoal qualities to them that can be decent if in the mood, and they're almost just expected to be a part of the package. This one, however, remains pretty laid back as far as RIS go."
"A: Dark brown head which drops and leaves a lingering layer of spots, pours with some serious viscosity and moves in the glass with a slight sluggishness, obsidian black in color - 5.00, S: Intense aromas, tons of dark coffee and black licorice, profuse sweetness suggestive of candied prunes or dates, lots of roasted grains as well as some baker's chocolate and fudge - 4.50, T: Thick chocolate and coffee, double fudge brownie without all the excessive sweetness on the palate, alcohol burn is present but not disruptive, some dark raisins and molasses, hops play a lesser role in the profile than the malts but provide a significant citrus bite - 3.75, M: Thick and smooth mouth feel - 4.25, D: All around a very nice RIS, intensely thick and flavorful and made for a cold winter night - 4.00"
"D - Very drinkable RIS got this as an extra from albgarza, big thanks! A great brew from Dark Horse, I have a couple of these so I will for sure enjoy this brew again. I highly recommend this brew"
"Very good. I need to try the rest of the series."
"What is particularly odd is the slightly oily, but very light, almost watery mouthfeel. For the make and model of this diesel motored fiend, I expected a bigger, more rounded feel. Not particularly the experience I was hoping for."
"D - This RIS started off good with the appearance and smell but it fell off with the big alcohol kicker...I enjoyed the other stouts (blueberry and smoked) from Dark Horse over this one"
"This is an excellent RIS. I'm proud of the Dark Horse boys on this one. This beer has great flavor, finish, and aftertaste with an amazing body and feel. I look forward to this one again!"
"D: Rich and flavorful. The residual sweetness and thickness of this beer limits its drinkability. Outstanding beer and would love to get some more of this."
"D: No way in the world you would know this is 12%! It is, by far, the most drinkable RIS I have ever tasted."
"D: Out of this world. Probably the most drinkable RIS I have ever had. Alcohol is 100% hidden the flavors are robust and delicious, and the feel is light and makes for easy drinking. If you haven't tried this one you defiantly should."
"This beer is truly an unexpected gem. What an outstanding drink and a wonderfully pleasant surprise. This beer has it all."
"D - Surprsignly easy to get through the bottle since it was both 12% AND a very rich and heavy imperial stout. With that said however, I don't know if I would be reaching for another bottle after going through one."
"Big thanks to Raznug for this one. Poured into a tulip. Pours black with about a finger of cocoa colored head. Not much to stick around, but spotty lacing looks pretty good. This has a really big nose. Big earthy smells all around; tobacco and faint whiff of alcohol. Dates and prunes and other dark fruits are present alongside a faint aroma of bitter chocolate. This smells great, at 12 percent, I expect to smell a little alcohol, regardless, I'm having trouble getting my nose out of this one to taste it. To my disappointment, the smell was better than the taste. I love the dark fruits that I'm tasting and hint of rich chocolate. I generally prefer something to be a little more roasty, but the dark fruit flavor is really nice. A little too much alcohol heat for good drinkability, but the mouth feel is good. A little under-carbonated for my taste, but it's still nice. The body is also a little lighter than I expected due to the style."
"D - not bad at all...glad i have another bottle of this as i think time will do it well, calming the bitter flavors and bringing everything else up a notch. has a lot of potential."
"I haven't really looked very hard, but this may actually be the last bottle from the now-legendary post-DLD death march. Here's hoping. This one pours a bleak nothingness, like the background of a later Goya painting, topped by a light head of tan bubbles. The nose comprises chocolate syrupe, maple syrup, molasses, a hint of soy sauce (odd...), roasted dark malts, brown sugar, figs, and some light coffee. Now that's some impy stout goodness, mm-hmm. The taste dives a bit, though: The roasts are all a bit too roasted, the sweetness is a bit too sweet, the strange soy sauce element returns (though not all that much), and a strong bit of leather comes swooping in uninvited. It's just all too much in too many different directions, if that makes any sense. Still, it somehow stays away from going too far in those myriad directions. It's hard to explain, but I think I can sum it up thusly: It's not what it should be (by any measure), but it's still not entirely objectionable. Yeah. Something like that. The body is a light heavy, with a high-light carbonation (deal with that, if your puny mind can, bwa-ha-ha!) and a smooth, fluid feel. Overall, I was not all that happy with this stout. Dark Horse has done some great things, but this one misses pretty far. Add the relatively high ABV, and the drinkability suffers. Still worth a try, though, if you ask me."
"D: A very solid RIS to say the least. Complex flavor, great body, and a huge alcohol kick with an appropriate presence. Dangerously drinkable. Seek this one out. Its a little under the radar but definitely worth the effort!!"
"This is my fourth Dark Horse beer, and so far my favorite (have also had Tres, Fore and Double Crooked Tree). It does just about everything you want a beer of this style to do, and it's all well-balanced, especially considering its immensity of flavor and alcohol-level. I wonder why it's called Plead The 5th? ""Shut up and drink"" maybe?"
"Dark Horse brought power and complexity to the table with this Imperial Stout. The only thing really holding it back some is the rather large ABV but this is still one well worth seeking out."
"D: Not exceptionally. but a good brew, prob best in the fall, one or two at a time"
"Light head, half finger of exceedingly dark brown foam, mostly larger bubbles which impairs retention, credible stickiness to the lacing. Jet black, zero color, only thing visible are a few floating particles within. The roast hits the right balance in the nose, more texturally stiffening than scented, you get sweet chocolate, coconut, light caramel as well as rich plum, golden raisin and cherry fruit scents, flaky pie crust, vanillin oak booziness, anise seed, orange citrus zest, overall soft and well harmonized. Full-bodied, yet smooth with nice fluidity, honestly, here the relatively weak carbonation helps to keep the pace going rather than fluff things up. Dark chocolate, cocoa, mocha and caramel, not so much coffee or real roast. Plum, cherry, raisin, fig, apricot fruit lends sweetness and concentration. The coconut, vanilla fudge, honey glazed dough and croissant flakes likewise. Hard to say both what the hops contribute and what they were meant to contribute. Still, awfully seductive as a pure ""guilty pleasure"" play."
"Flavor is fairly robust dark chocolate, plums, and no hops anywhere to be found. The booze drops in on the finish. This is a nice hearty beer and I wish I had more than this one bottle. Definitely a bit of a sipper, but a very enjoyable one."
"d: As big and flavorful as this was, 12 ounces wasn't enough. I was sad to see my glass empty. I didn't taste anything to suggest an abv of anywhere near 12%. An excellent over the top imperial stout."
"D: Noticable or not twelve percent is twelve percent. So I really wouldn't want more than one. I had this beer before and I really liked it a lot. This one seems a little raw. Maybe I'll try it again in six months or so and see how it changes with some age on it."
"I gotta go get me some more of this."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves some minimal sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee notes, vanilla. The taste is very nice, malty, sweet/vanilla note, lots of chocolate/toffee. Medium body, a nice smooth/slightly creamy brew, ABV hidden very well, but a sipper for sure. Very Drinkable, another very tasty brew from DH."
"Drinkability: It's a sipper that I'd rather wait a week or so for another though it does get tasty. I do like what happens with the taste as it sits & warms."
"Drinkable all things considered, but not this beer's best asset."
"the 10 had a bitter finish with the 08 being smoother with a bigger body."
"D - very drinkable for what it is."
"Drinkability is decent, though the flavor profile is a bit coarse and raw. Alcohol definitely bites back, as well. Again, a decent enough beer, but it doesn't have the beautiful cohesiveness that the best IS seem to have. Doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable, though."
"Overall, a very nice imperial stout that is somewhat different from many of the ones I've had recently. Thin body at times, lack of serious complexity, and overall sweetness hold it back just a bit. Still, the delicious factor, appearance, and smell give this beer a nice leg up. A highly recommended beer that if were available to me, I would definitely pick up often."
"Consumed: 5/25/2010"
"Notes - Maybe it was because I wasn't in the mood for a big stout like this but I wasn't a fan of this beer. I put the other three in the cellar and expect better things from them in a years time."
"This was a good stout, but not a great stout. There was no delicious flavor or complexity or anything that stood out to me. I was hoping for a more stellar brew, but I enjoyed it, and look forward to seeing how it ages."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's in Bethlehem. Uncapped and poured into a standard shaker glass. The 5th appears a nearly opaque brown color with about an inch of dark tan foam. Smells and tastes of molasses, dark and bittersweet chocolate, mocha, licorice, espresso, a hint of soy sauce, dried dark fruits. Approaching full bodied, syrupy and slick, with decent carbonation for the style. Alcohol heat is well hidden. Overall, a great stout at a good price."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Ok to try at least once, but not great. Ok, for a stout. Many better brews in the style."
"Overall Impression: I loved it! Can't praise this wonderful concoction with anymore praise then has already been said. Go out & try it immediately."
"D- Very drinkable, you hardly notice the ABV at 12% in this."
"Pours pitch black absolutely sucks up all the visible light spectrum in my glass, big tan head after a vigorous pour. Aroma has dark licorice or pitsella (anise notes) with big ripened fruit notes,and an awesome roasted malt dark chocolate strong coffee combo. Big creamy toasted marshmallow experience this beer is extreme and awesome with a touch of soy sauce. Flavor is completely different than the draft sample I had much more rounded dark fruit sweetness in the flavor in the draft. This one is aggressive needing some age yet still a necessary drinking experience for any beer lover. I used to not be able to get any Dark Horse now that it's distributed in Ohio I've seen most of their beers come through, I really like their standards and their limited releases have been outstanding. Extremely sweet creamy sweet it could use a bit more hop balance than this, really it has anise (black licorice) a touch of soy sauce tones, and some dark fruit with soothing alcohol tones...strong espresso and dark chocolate this is one big ass stout. There's nothing here screaming hop bitterness I just wish it had more of that. Body wise this beer borders chewy full bodied stout with strong residual finishing characterisitcs and a strong soothing alcohol burn in the finish. Drinkability overall is a one and done type of affair, I liked it on draft much better. Challenging huge flavors going on but the balance could have been much better."
"Very tasty, and not really easy to read the 12% abv, until, what, wait a minute, ...there it is...whoa-oh..."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just above average here. The big sweetness and high ABV will limit it some. Overall, I really like this brew. Chocolate and char play very nicely off one another. Probably should be classified as an American Double Stout, but who cares, really nice offering from the guys at Dark Horse. Skal."
"The mouth feel is very smooth and creamy, almost silky smooth. Combined with its amazing chocolate taste, this is quite drinkable and I honestly do not think I am drinking anything alcoholic."
"D: Very nice overall, but it just doesn't match the awesomeness that this beer is from a bottle. I would love to try it on tap sometime, and see how it compares. Unfortunately, a bad growler fill done this one in a bit. For shame whole foods.."
"D: The beer has a good level of drinkability as the alcohol is very well masked."
"Overall, I like this brew very much. I love a big, bold, no frill, knock you on your ass stout. And this one is no exception. The ABV is not available, but I can tell you it's up there. On top of that, there is a good amount of smooth and boldness meshed together. All that said, I would be interested to see how this brew would age. I'd like to see if aging it would bring out more flavor. In addition, I would consider warming this brew slightly before enjoying. I do feel I enjoyed it a bit too cold, as a bit less chill would have enhanced the flavor. This is a bold brew, and a great way to top off this stout series."
"Mmm, mouthfeel is smooth, silky and creamy with very light carbonation, perfect for a RIS. it clings to your mouth and sticks around just long enough. Taste is great, not much for hops but a tiny bite of hop bitterness on the finish, mostly covered by the roasted barley/coffee bitterness. There's some great burnt notes here that linger and give you a really nice smooth taste. Super easy drinking and very satisfying."
"Overall impression: A nice RIS that seems to have excellent aging potential. I think I will throw my other one in the cellar and revisit in a year or so."
"Flavor is really interesting. It reminds me of Midnight Sun Berserker in a way, except without the -bal aging notes. Rich dark chocolate and roast dominate, with a hint of coffee as well as molasses, anise, and red wine/port. Very full and thick on the palate with low carbonation. Some tannins as well as hop bitterness. Smooth and slick. A great imperial stout overall. Not too drinkable in large quantities, but you have to give it a pass on this because it's damn good. One of the better beers I've had from Dark Horse. Good job rejecting Nickelback's offer too, guys. They suck!"
"This is a pretty solid RIS. It's my first brew by Dark Horse and I'm looking forward to trying some others."
"M/D: Nice creamy and thick. The carbonation seems pretty low on this one, but in a nice way. Overall, this is a great stout, I've hit a brick wall with DIPA's, so I switched to stouts, this is a good way to start off. I would definitely check this one out again, almost wish I would have got a 4 pack..."
"overall - great beer. wish i had more. I think a couple of these is all you'd need on a cold night. the huge ABV is masked very well."
"Pours a near black with minimal brown spotting in leiu of a head. Smell is of dark roasted malts, faint raisin and brown sugar notes, slightly alcoholic. Taste follows scent with the dark roasted grains, hints of chocolate and espresso, backed by rasin and prune notes, hints of molasses and a slightly boozy finish. Not quite full bodied, very smooth without being silky, could have been bulked up a bit. A nice RIS that doesnt overdo any particular aspect of its build. ABVs hidden suprisingly well."
"D- I like this brew wish it was little thicker in body. Easy to drink alcohol hidden well and tastes great."
"Poured into a snifter after being chilled in the fridge for about an hour (an unseasonably warm April is leaving my basement warmer than hoped for this time of the year!). This beer pours a very inky black with the slightest formation of a tan head. My initial impression of the nose was that it smelled similar to a DFH World Wide Stout or Bell's Batch 9000. Initially very sweet, sugary, and syrupy smell. However, after a moment a robust and roasty smell dominates. The taste of this beer is superbly solid. Well balanced, beautiful roasted malt flavor dominates, without the slightest hint of alcohol. A perfect example of what a Russian Imperial Stout should taste like. Reminds me a bit of Old Rasputin. Carbonation in the beer is moderate. with a slight watery feel as the beer passes through to the end of the palate, but finished dry. Very enjoyable brew and by far my most favorite Dark Horse to date. Strongly recommended."
"A very tasty, drinkable Imperial Stout. Dark Horse really nailed this one down."
"Excellent drinkability and a straight forward RIS. The nose bother's me but other than that, this is great. I'll try another bottle to see if that odor is still there. The alcohol is nowhere to be found, very impressive. Dark Horse continues to put out good dark beer and others."
":)"
"Opaque black with thin tan head. Decent retention, little lacing to speak of. Smell is interesting, definitely multi-dimensional. Some smoke, coffee, booze, rock candy, dark fruit, cinnamon, and wood. Taste is far smokier than others seem to think, espresso, some bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruit again, some alcohol. Definitely interesting, better than your run-of-the-mill RIS. MF is a bit light-bodied, but definitely smooth and velvety. Drinkability, like Double Crooked Tree, is way higher than I would expect for a 10+% ABV. Definitely a good RIS, interesting. I'll be grabbing another to put away for a while."
"A great drinking stout. It left me wanting for more. This one is worth seeking out."
"D- The ABV is insanely hidden. This makes for a dangerous stout. It drinks like a cream stout and packs a punch like the big RIS that it is. I have not yet had all of this series but this is my favorite so far."
"As with most beers from Dark Horse, this imperial stout is a step above the others. Pouring a dark, creamy black, almost to the consistancy or oil, the Plead the 5th bottles that I have had recently have had the perfect amount of carbonation (or lack there of). Creamy and malty in feel, the aromas of this imperial stout smell of intense coffee and chocolate, but thankfully lack the intense bitterness of other imperial stouts that smell so strongly of coffee. Drinkability is fantastic, rich, almost chewy, and smooth. My basis for comparison, while it may be a high standard, for all other imperial stouts."
"D- its a huge beer with a lot of complexity for sure but easy on ya. Great for enjoying with some friends."
"Drinkability: No doubt about it, this is a big beer. Big flavor, and big ABV. As tasty as this is, there's no way you can have more than one of these in a night. All night drinkability...definitely not. But I'm sure going to enjoy it while it lasts. Definitely recommend - if you see it, grab it!"
"D - This is a good stout for sure, good balance of flavors and probably my favorite beer from Dark Horse so far."
"Full body. Lower carbonation. Nice and chewy. A very solid beer."
"D: Wow, this was good. Could easily enjoy this one again. Very low alcohol presence for a 12% brew. Nice."
"Drinkability - This is my favorite out of the series. Definitely a sipper but a great beer, as the beer warms up in the glass more of the aromas and flavors can be picked up."
"One of the best stouts I've ever had! Well done, Dark Horse!"
"Overall this was one of the thickest beers I can remember and certainly one that is big on flavor. Recommended."
"I've not been a big fan of a lot of Dark Horse beers I've tried but this one is excellent. Tons of flavor and really smooth and drinkable for such a huge imperial stout. I think I will be looking out for this one again. thanks Kevin!"
"D- This was my favorite out of the five stouts. Dark Horse really knocked this one out of the park. Aaron and the boys did a fine job with all the stouts and well...I will be buying them all up before I have to wait until next year."
"Bottle pours a dark black with a decent amount of caramal brown foam forming the duvel glass. The taste is of very subtle dark chocolate with a hint of espresso like coffee. Very damn smooth and no indication of the 12% at all. Very nice beer and easy to drink. Glad I have another bottle of these left. Dark Horse is impressing me a lot so far."
"Pour is pitch black and started with no apparent head but towards the end of the pour, a very attractive tan head bubbled up. Nose is of roasted malts and bits of bitter chocolate and a touch of booze. Taste is of roasted malts and grain, chocolate and again some booze. Thick body that coats the mouth. Pretty nice brew overall that seems to be improving as it warms."
"Taste is a complex mix of dark chocolate, raisin, and molasses. Alcohol is present, but blends in well enough to not be overbearing. Finishes slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth."
"On-tap at Liberty St for $5/pint. Appeared pitch black with a brown cascading head. Damn, this is rich stout. Still, it wasn't cloying or too thick to have more than a few ounces like DFH World Wide Stout. It has a big chocolate cake taste that reminds me of 3F Dark Lord - though smoother and not quite as complex. This beer might benefit from a little more cellaring, it's just not as flavorful as the great imperial stouts. Still, it's fairly drinkable for the style and makes for a good dessert beer. Vanilla ice cream anyone?"
"Overall impression: Wow! Perfect sipper for this cloudy, cool spring day. I'll definitely be enjoying this again as long as we can get it in Ohio. Good stuff."
"Expectations given the ABV were that this would be thick, sweet brew. Instead it was acidic, dry, flat and thin. The only aspect that distinguished it for me was the pleasant smoky finish."
"D-I love a big creamy stout and this lives up to that. It has hints of booze but nothing that really detracts from the overall great drink that this proves to be. The nose was a little sweet but the beer brought a great balance and complexity."
"D: A great way to finish my horizontal run through the Dark Horse seasonal stouts. A warming stout that packs a nice punch."
"D: Excellent."
"This beer poured almost black and created a huge dark chocolate foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee, chocolate and anise. The flavor was of malt, anise, chocolate and a hint of coffee. The body is medium light and the finish a bit sweet with the alcohol present in the background. Another nice beer from them and hopefully on tap sometime when I visit again."
"D-a great impy stout. thick and chewy with lots of dark chocolate and malt. Could use a bit more hop to cut the sweetness, or not."
"Wow! Great taste. Huge chewy/thick mouthfeel. Full bodied, warm booze, low carbonation, THICK chocolate taste! Lot's of chocolate, burnt coffee, dark fruit sweetness, and a heck of a lot of booze! This is indeed a very good RIS!"
"This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. As it warms, it becomes sweeter and more coffee-like."
"D: this rich and decadent treat is quite palatable, however its thickness and high gravity makes it a chore to finish, a chore that I would never pass up!"
"D: Love this as a sipping beer, but more than one in a sitting would be a mistake for me. The high ABV and thick, dark flavor make this a one-a-week type beer for me."
"Overall- this stout is defintitely one for the stout fans. the 12abv is subtle. not to much carbonation and wasn't to much of a head but still good."
"Drinkability:This went down a bit too easy for the considerably high ABV. This was a very enjoyable brew none the less though and really transformed nicely as it warmed. mmm mmm"
"Awesome drinkability at this ABV. An absolute solid RIS. Really worth trying."
"D-Smooth and easy going, well rounded and VERY flavourful....in fact disturbingly so! For a brew packing a reported 14% ABV this beer could get you into serious trouble, fast! A VERY complex and intriguing brew. Well done Dark Horse!"
"This one is quite drinkable. The alcohol content is amazingly well-hidden, and the smell and taste is exceptional."
"D: Quite drinkable, despite it's ABV and youth. Although it will definitely benefit after a year or so in bottle, it is quite good young. It's worth picking up a four pack."
"D- In one word: outstanding. I love these guys and the series of stouts they put out each year. This beer is complex fresh and I'm sure will only be exponentially more so with some years on it. Job well done!"
"I have to say that this is an excellent imperial stout, and it is right up my alley with its simplicity in a world of barrel aged ""bells and whistles"" type stouts."
"Pours dark as oil with a shallow tan head that fades slowly; negligible lacing but leaves behind a thin oily film tha's a big hintof goodness to come. The smell is a very rich roasted coffe over black licorice and a cherry vanilla coating. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied, the mouth feel is tangy from the alcohol, et smooth and oily. Full flavored, surprisingly boozier than anticipated, mokah-licorise is repeated well from the nose. A really nice sipper. The 12% ABV is all there and ALL GOOD in my book. Highly recommended. Many thanks guys!!"
"This was a good beer to have, and I am glad I got the opportunity. It did not use the usual characteristics that I love in RIS, but went with a darker roasty spin."
"This beer was overall a sipper but the drink ability was good. Could prolly finish more than one but it would take awhile. Kinda reminded me of Mephistopheles from Avery. Prolly wont have another opportunity to try this beer but glad I did"
"D: This bottle was a gift from a co-worker, so I'm not sure if this is an old bottle or not. I'm guessing it's a year old or so, which would help explain the incredible smoothness and the degree to which the alcohol has faded into the background. Still, an amazing technical accomplishment. It's in the same realm as Founder's Impy Stout and Bell's Expedition, which is incredibly high praise from me."
"MaCain likey"
"D: It's enjoyable, but it doesn't distinguish itself from other imperial stouts."
"this one continues to be one of my top 10 favorite imperial stouts. i love dark horse. they never cease to amaze me. like extascy in a glass. this brew will stain your glass. motor oil, just the way i love it. smoky molasses and clean as cream. thick and rich with a sort of silky, milky feel. and affordable! this is one of the few stouts i do enjoy a little colder. it's either because of the highly roasted smell or just because it works with the milky, creamy character. at 12% be careful. This beer is my happy place. if i ever get raped, this is where im going to go. cheers!"
"Overall this is one big ass, big bodied, big flavored, high octane brew that should be tracked down at all cost, rivals the best of the Russian imperial stouts."
"It's 2013 now (the original was 12-28-2009) and I guess I agree with myself, but this beer is warmer and tastier. The rating system has changed a little too so I am bumping up the overall rating which I guess used to be drinkability."
"D: Though everything is really good here, this beer ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts. I find the strong and sweet dark fruit flavor to be a little off putting. I'm not sure but the beer does everything well, but has a few things that keep from being great. Try it for yourself though, it's a unique a well done beer that maybe you have a taste for."
"Nice beer and great to get as an extra in trade."
"D: I'd drink this back to back, then I'd be buzzed, So I'd drink as many as I could, it's a good brew."
"The alcohol is perfectly intertwined with the taste of this beverage. The aforementioned plumminess makes it a wee bit tart for multiples, but 12% is subtlely placed. The sediment stain I see on the bottom further represents oatmeal presence, but there's a thickness there discouraging multiple sessions. Still, Dark Horse comes strong with a well-built stout. Thanks to NotCreative for the chance to enjoy."
"Overall, not my favorite Dark Horse brew, but it's definitely a good one. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Minnesota get's this brew, so next time I see it I'm going to buy a whole bunch, as I bet time only makes this brew better."
"Drinkability: Although a one a night beer with its 12% ABV, its definitely a wonderful Imperial stout for sipping before the fire while listening to music and/or reading. One of the things I particularly like about this beer is that the flavors changed nicely so that it is not really the same set of flavors that dominate throughout. I'll definitely have this one again, and again now that its available in PA."
"Overall, didn't have high expectations, but this sort of blew me away. Probably one of the better, unique tasting RIS I have ever had. It had lot of added dimensions that most beers in this style don't have, yet managed to be restrained at the same time."
"Overall: Kind of reminded of a slightly watered down version of Founders Imperial Stout. A good Impy Stout...and one I would like to have again. Cheers"
"I like. I like much. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, but not overly thick, and it's pretty drinkable for the ABV."
"Overall, I love this Imperial Stout. It has good drinkability and tastes great. Be careful though, it can creep up on you."
"An excellent RIS from a great brewery that doesn't get a lot of hype. This is just what I needed on this chilly fall night. I just wish I could find more around Chicago."
"D - This is a really great tasting RIS. Another great stout from Dark Horse."
"D - It could be just a touch old but it makes the wonder me wonder what the alcohol would taste like if it were young. Strong and full-bodied it's well suited to warm on a cold winter morning. I'd love to try this again."
"I have yet to be really impressed by Dark Horse beers. They are good, but have not pushed themselves into the great category yet in my opinion."
"It seems to push toward that epic, gigantic mouth paint type Imperial Stout, that a person can still taste 12 hours later. This lacks the over-pronounciation of flavor (specifically roast/char and dark fruit) in order to achieve it. Though, the forces the focus to shift towards the secondary, more nuanced flavors, that would normally be obscured, and probably wins because of it."
"drinkability takes a hit from the mouthfeel - still a very good RIS"
"This was a great beer. Not nearly as filling as a lot of Imperial Stouts, but just as flavorful. Worth seeking out."
"It has nice carbonation and a full, chewy mouthfeel. This is a solid stout... but it's still a full step down from the best in class. I'll age the remaining three in hopes the burn lessens."
"A great imperial stout that I would love to enjoy again."
"Drinkability: Pretty high for this style, as it's not too overpowering."
"Notes: The nutter in me wonders how this beer would pair with black pudding."
"12oz bottle courtesy of dancingcaddis, thanks man! Dark black with a short head of coffee colored bubbles. It smells odd, kind of sweet, unfamiliar. The flavor is fruity and sweet and quite interesting. The alcohol was well hidden and I am usually pretty finicky about beers with ABv over 10%."
"I might as well be eating this with a spoon; the thickness is ridiculously awesome, and if it wasn't for the fact that it is slightly over-carbonated, the mouthfeel would certainly warrant a 5. a slight burn going down warms up your whole body, which isn't so surprising considering the 12%"
"Drinkability: Definitely strong, but the many flavors do not seem to meld well together into a nice coherent presentation. Not one I will seek out again."
"Picked up a single of this to try, other than some alcohol in the nose, I never would have thought this was 12%. Alcohol was very well hidden in the taste. I liked the creaminess and only mild bitterness. Definitely worth a try."
"D--This beer being rated an A- is a crime. Rich, complex, flavorful...what is holding people back?"
"(D)- This will stick to your ribs! What I really like about it is that the flavors dont all come out at once, but gradually one after another once you swallow. The complexities are delibrate, strong, and show themselves one after another; an adventure in the mouth so to speak. A definite sipper with no doubt though, that 12% really sneaks up on you! If you aged this for at least 2 years+, it would be absolutely incredible in my opinion."
"A good Russian Imperial Stout that somehow keeps me wanting more. Maybe it's because Plead has a balanced and mellow take on the style (Similar to Blackout) or becuase the gravities aren't quite insane as I expected. It's kinda like a big Oatmeal Stout with the creamy texture, slickness, and weight. Lightly carbonated, the beer falls still fairly quickly and doesn't lift off of the tongue the way I like. A balanced roastiness never prefers the char or the toffee malts. Milk flavors and sweetness round out the herbal hops, sharp roasted grains, and alcohols. Still, the coffee, chocolate, anise, blackberries, plubs, grapes and dates are bold and varying and have come together very well. Nice disguise of the abv. With all the compliments, I still want more..."
"Bottle thanks to Beerlando. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma is quite chocolatey, with some roasted and cookie malts. Nougat and toffee notes too. Flavor is sweet with cookie malt and roasted malt. Not SUPER heavy, but the 12% is definitely noted. An interesting impy with some character."
"D= very nice glad I got this four pack. Ill be looking for it again sometime too. Really flavorful and tasty RIS seek this one out."
"D- At 12% ABV, this is extremely drinkable. Definitely a night-cap sipper vs. a lawnmower chugger, but very approachable all the same. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Tremendous beer, this Plead the Fifth. There's no way I'd plead the fifth in defense of this. It's worthy of a full-throated apologia. Outstanding."
"Fantastic flippin' brew. I'll be out to seek out a four-pack of fifteen of this - I'd love to see how it ages, although I can scarcely fathom is can improve much. Absolutely fantastic!"
"Here's to Dark Horse Brewing!"
"D: It's a sipper, especially because it's so heavy, but the flavor is great, the alcohol tinge is minor enough that i don't think it really affects drinkability,"
"12oz bottle purchased at Cloverleaf a few weeks ago, <$3. The beer is very black with a thin tan head, less foam than usual for a RIS. The smell is rich with chocolate and roasted malts, a noticeable black licorice aroma too. The beer tastes overpowering with malty sweetness, dark fruits like prunes and raisins and plums, and black licorice or anise (but thankfully not much). Lots of previous reviewers noted a lack of body but I thought this was thick and filling. Maybe I tried the latest batch and it's been improved in some way, it was thick and oily and good. This beer is up there in Dark Horse's line-up, along with Perkolator and Double Crooked Tree."
"poured this into my beer tasting wine glass. Not much to be said for the head, a little caramel color that disappeared quickly. This monster poured like 10W-30! The aroma is caramel chocolate, and raisin. Taste is the same, nice hop balance bitter coffee with a little bit of lactose and vanilla. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, like the oily pour would suggest. Highly drinkable, though you better not be a lightweight. Once again a SOLID effort from a brewery that has puts out a lot of winners. I applaud Dark Horse for putting out some great and fairly priced four packs of specialty beers."
"12 oz. Black pour with brown/ruby highlights in the head. Head is not large and recedes to a thin ring. A good amount of film sticks to the glass. Roast aromas, some dark chocolate and dark fruits, port like. Smooth full body. Taste is a silky blend of dark chocolate, molasses and chocolate covered fruits. Some vanilla and barrel like qualitites. Finishes with some more chocolate and light espresso. Drinks well, but is filling. Another excellent stout offering from Dark Horse. They produce a nice line of beers under the radar in West/Central Michigan."
"A thick dark black motor oil pour with a thin coco colored head,light carbonation with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is heavy dark chocolate,bitter coffee,and roasty/burnt malt,and a hint of smoke. WOW Flavor is of bitter coffee,dark chocolate,malt,caramel,vanilla,hints of oak,and alcohol,medium to full body with a creamy mouthfeel, awesome bittersweet finish. This is outstanding in every way. Dark Horse Rocks !"
"Pours a thick oily black with a silky espresso head. Nose has big roasty malts, chocolate, subtle piney hops, molasses, licorice, dried plums and cherries, coffee and vanilla. Taste is a well balanced blend of bitter hops, molasses, dark malts, fugde, and ripe pitted fruits. Thick body is very well carbonated. Great stuff from Dark Horse."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth with a small bite of carbonation."
"this imperial stout pours black and thick with very little head and 1/4 inch black cherry ring til the end ....it does have good lacing thru-out the smell is chocolate and molasses followed by coffee and some vanilla notes.the taste is bitter sweet chocolate first followed by a coffee bourbon taste throw in some berry/fruit tastes then finish with molasses ,burnt malt and slight vanilla bean..i do taste the alcohol presence this stout is a little to bitter for my liking and and a tad high on abv for my liking..not as smooth as some of dark horse earlier numbered stouts and not my favorite style of the 5..having said that it is still a good stout and i recommend trying this well made russian imperial and any other beer from this outstanding brewery"
"HV"
"Received as part of the Black Booty BIF. Pours black with a thin head that settles to a ring. Smells of coffee and bitter chocolate, with a slightly roasty and milk chocolate finish. Impressive taste, a choclate explosion with wonderful bitter chocolate, some berry notes, both long and delicious. Later some cinammon and a big hit of coffee make an appearance. The mouthfeel is long and super smooth. Utterly delicious, this is a great beer."
"Notes: excellent stout. one of the best ive had"
"Carbonation level is appropriate, lending to a very smooth, viscous sipper. I don't know how drinkable you could expect a brew like this to be, but it's about what you would expect considering its style and ABV."
"Sure drink a few of these. Don't let me stop you. One was enough for me though."
"D - This was a great RIS, a little different that normal RIS's, but not as in your face as the WWS, but somewhere in between, a very good beer"
"D: This time I don't think that my ratings reflect how I actually perceived this beer, it's not what I am used to, I don't really like the licorice that I can taste, but the mouthfeel on this seems to improve but that may be an account of how my tongue is numbed out by the alcohol in this. It just doesn't taste like what I'm used to, it's not really smooth, it's thick but not smooth and that alone sort of makes the whole drinking experience suffer for me, where the beer might actually taste better than I am rating it, but the feel made me think that it tastes worse than it actually is. I'm not going to say I'm disappointed in this beer (though at 11 bucks for 4 I might be) I'll say that this was not exactly what I was expecting out of this beer."
"D - Yeah...at 12% ABV, I don't think so but I really want more of you. Man this is an exceptional stout. I am glad that it is so high on the alcohol side and that Dark Horse uses bottle opener bottles and caps instead of those stupid twist off tops. This means that this should age quite well. Thanks Dark Horse. I am a HUGE fan."
"D: This one is definitely a sipper. Lighter than most RIS's, which might not be a bad thing considered that it's released just as the weather turns for the better."
"12oz. Poured black with a thin light brown head, even with an aggressive pour. Little lacing on the glass also. Aromas were of roasted malts and chocolate with hints of black licorice. I expected a plume of alcohol, but wasn't overly present. Mouth-feel is medium to thick and thickens as the stout warms. Tastes are roasted malts, chocolate, and espresso. It is boozy, but the alcohol isn't overly present given the 12% ABV. Fruity esters reminiscent of ripe dark fruits are also present as it warms. Overall, a well done RIS! Really enjoyed this one, and would recommend it. I only bought a single, but would have been satisfied with a 4-pack."
"D-High. First had this one on cask, and now having had it from the bottle has firmly established my enjoyment of this brew."
"A very enjoyable RIS. I can only see this one getting greater over time and I will happily let my other three bottles age a while before cracking another."
"Very nice! My favorite offering from Dark Horse to date!"
"my bottom line: Plead the fifth is an especially bitter, strong, warming RIS. Very tasty but other than the bitterness and strength it fails to really set itself apart from the rest of the RIS pack in my book."
"Great beer!"
"Sorry, I'm not Pleading the 5th on this one. I'm very guilty of loving this beer and I'm not afraid to admit it. It's loaded with delicious flavor and is extremely impressive all around. To be fair, this bottle is roughly a year old. Perhaps more. It's drinking incredibly well right now. The abv could probably be shaved a little and it wouldn't skip a beat. That's about the only criticism I have. If you happen to land multiple bottles, by all means, put some back for a year or two. I promise it's more than worth it. Thanks a ton, Derek. This was excellent."
"Do not want"
"drinkability: good"
"Quite tasty, and quite drinkable on a weekend. Limit- three? Only one on a week night, however."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for a 12% brew. I can see the bitterness getting a little overwhelming, but otherwise it's pretty easy going - low carbonation and well-hidden ABV."
"Smell is some dark cocoa and some hops coming through as well. The hops are throwing off the smell a bit though. Taste is roasted black malt and some slight coffee as well. Mouthfeel is tad thin too. This is my least favorite beer from an outstanding brewery. I've liked everything else from them, so this beer definitely won't deter me from seeking out more Dark Horse offerings."
"Balance like this is unusual; a bit more body would make this a spectacular beer."
"Good complex standout brew."
"Pours a deep, dark and opaque black, no light escapes, very thick brown head forms, drops a lot of lacing, settles down to a thick ring, looks like a RIS! Smell is great, tons of chocolate and fruit, toffee, coffee roast, very perfumy and floral hops, licorice, strawberries and cherries, dates, more roast and chocolate, awesome. Taste is great as well, chocolate, insane amount of roastiness, dry and chalky middle, toffee, some smoke, charred wood, burnt sugar, light bit of fruitiness, roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down, but very smooth. Great imperial stout, very nice. Thanks Russ!"

"D-Be careful with this one. I could probably stomach 3 or 4 then call it a night."
"This stuff was your basic black with faint brown edges and a thin, dark brown cap of fine bubbles that settled to a long lasting collar. Sticky lacing. Rich aroma, lots of fruit and roast character, chocolate and cocoa, dried fruits and cherries, hint of vanilla. Reminded me of a fruit and nut chocolate bar. Chalky, dry roast flavour with medium to low hop bitterness. Very nutty with dark chocolate and cocoa notes, plus mild alcohol towards the end. Caramel and toffee sweetness. Faint licorice. Full bodied with low, very fine carbonation, alcohol warmth and a chalky dryness. Rich and delicious, just the way a big stout should be."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Greasy and oily to an extent, which is good. But where's the body? The girth? This beer needs more heft. Carbonation is appropriately low. Alcohol accents nicely and doesn't become toxic at all in this high octane beer. Nicely done beer overall."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. great depth. an excellent stout."
"For the first half of the bottle, I kept wondering, ""where have I tasted this before? I know I've had something recently that tasted a lot like this."" Then I remembered - it reminds me a little of the non-barrel aged version of Brooklyn Black Ops, which is awesome. I highly recommend this and can't wait for the chance to buy more. A very pleasant surprise. Everything I've had from Dark Horse so far has been excellent. Not surprising - another great Michigan brewer. I'll put Michigan up against any other state, including California."
"Taste is thick and chewy and coats the mouth nicely, strong roasted presence with a coffee/dark chocolate bitterness, slight dark fruit presence, the strength is very well hidden and has surprisingly little warming action."
"D - A nice full bodied malty stout that would pair extremely well with dark or milk chocolate, this hide's it's booze content like a functioning alcoholic at his day job. This one helluva beer. Not the best in it's style, but it's good nonetheless."
"SIP on this one long and steady, if you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is is full with a just a perfect amount of carbonation for me, and the drinkability is dangerously high. Wish I had been able to pick up more than the one bottle while in Michigan, but glad that I was able to try this amazing stout."
"Yes sir, I'll have another."
"D - For the style and abv, great drinkability!"
"Drinkbility: A well-constructed RIS that is balanced and flavorful"
"A very nice, balanced stout. Alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Is this really 12%? Smooth, drinkable, and complex with an interesting play between the malt, hops and dark fruitiness. Recommended."
"D: I like how the flavor developes of the course of drinking the beer. It is nice and drinkable, but it isn't anything really great."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of this beer is huge. This is a low carbonated full bodied beer treat. Big and chewy just the way I like em. This is a sipper and a taste bud destroyer. Definately a one and done beer."
"D- picking up this basically unknown beer was a great idea. darkhorse hasnt failed me before and definitely didnt with this one. the taste and experience of this one is fantastic, its just way too strong to be sessionable. more people should check this one out. very good example of the style."
"Not super drinkable. The strength of the grain bitterness is too much to make this one to constantly enjoy."
"I'd love to drink this in the middle of a blizzard, inside a log cabin, nestled in some tall, cold mountains somewhere in Scandinavia."
"D- I could drink four of these, but there would be a price to pay."
"Well this one was finished way before I was ready to let it go. For such a powerful brew this drinks painfully easily. Savor this puppy."
"Drinks easy for the style, but not enough flavor depth to push this to upper echelon RIS status"
"D: This is my favorite of the stout series so far by a mile (only Tres to go). Great beer from Dark Horse and highly recommended."
"this delectable brew pours up pitch black with a brown head... the nose is composed of wonderful dark chocolate malts... the taste is some alcohol, slight chocolate malts.... delicious!!!If only I could have it my way like at Burger King and order up one of these beers at my local convienence store... that would be quite convienient..."
"Dry finish and aftertaste."
"Two fingers of one of the darkest heads Ive seen on a beer. Deep brown with even hints of ruby mixed in. Body is deep dark jet black and thick. Nose is rich with milk chocolate, toasty malt and a hint of candied cherries. Initially super creamy as you take first sip. Then you get waves of dark bitter chocolate, vanilla and lots of rich dark fruit. Very heavy on the mouth as it really paints the mouth. Thick throughout and really shows nice depth and complexity. Mouthfeel is big dry and nicely bitter. Alchol is well hidden. A big dark stout to sip slowly and enjoy."
"An all around good RIS that stands up relatively well to the big boys."
"mouthfeel is heavy roasty lingering bitterness, rich and thick, yum"
"D - A solid RIS but too much burnt flavor/aroma for me."
"D- an awesome sipper, wish i had more, the 12oz bottle is perfect 750 might want to share."
"Drinkability: The tartness/fruity esters keep it light and drinkable, which is good, because otherwise this one might knock you on your butt. It's very balanced, though - recommended."
"Full-bodied with nice drinkability."
"Don't get me wrong: I am by no means the kind of guy who gets down on beers for not being Xtreme enough. But I expect a lot out of an RIS. And this one, while plenty enjoyable, doesn't fully deliver."
"Plead The 5th = YUM!!!"
"Overall, a great example of the style, and even better, I'm guessing, with a little time."
"D- A tasty pick. I could really sip on this for awhile. Much better than I expected. Dark Horse really knows what they are doing with stouts."
"Overall, what a great find and very flavorful! I really enjoy this brew!"
"12oz. bottle received in trade from iceicebaby. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black with a quarter-inch mocha-colored head with copious ringlets that eventually settled into an inconsistent slick before finally congealing around the perimeter of the bowl. Lots of tiny bubbles lined the walls of the glass below the surface. Some bands of watery lacing, but poor adherence. Scents of dark fruit and chocolate malt. Flavors of roasted coffee, chocolate malt and dark fruit (perhaps cherries). Mouthfeel was very lively with a light carbonation burn across the top of the tongue. Body was a little thin for the style. Good drinkability; somewhere between an RIS and a foreign export stout. I have to say that I continue to be impressed by this brewery."
"D - two or three of these would be wonderful."
"Pours basically black with little to no light coming through. A thin tan head slowly rises from the pour. Smell is much more sweet than the taste to come. Some dark fruits, milk chocolate, light caramel and of course hints of roast. Taste brings the roasted flavors full force. Char and smoked flavors come out. Very interesting and deep. Some sweetness again and a little bitter toward the finish. Not a bad mouthfeel, just not as big a body as I'd hoped. Overall a good drinker and brew."
"Ovr: Good stout. Nice vanilla/milky notes to it and really smooth. Dark Horse knows what their doing. Every one of thier brews I've had to date have been very solid."
"D: Way too easy to drink. I'm sure the ABV is up there but I really want to continue drinking this. I'll actually have to watch myself from wasting this."
"Overall I thought this one was really great. A solid imperial stout that hid the alcohol very well and leaned heavily toward the side of chocolate with the flavor. Quite solid in both appearance and profile, this is one I would love to go back to and try again. Definitely very good."
"12 ounce bottle, ""Plead the 5th"" Imperial Stout. Served in a chalice, the beer pours very dark brown/black with a very small brown head which goes away quickly. The aroma is roasted malt, dark fruit, milk chocolate, coffee and molasses. Taste is similar to the aroma, there's roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee, dark fruit and a bit of soy sauce. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full. Not as thick as I expected it to be (but there's still plenty of substance to this beer), but it's very slick and smooth with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's not hard to drink at all. Overall I think this is a pretty good RIS, I'd definitely buy it again given the chance."
"12 oz bottle of Plead The 5th, pours a dark and opaque body with a small light brown head that leaves some spotty lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, coffee, and some dried dark fruits. Full bodied and creamy mouthfeel with a lower than medium carbonation. Taste is complex. Chocolate, strong roasted coffee beans, molasses, caramel, vanilla, leather, anise, and cherry skins. Alcohol is very well concealed but for some mild warmth. Excellent and very well put together. This one belongs in the top tier of American impy stouts."
"This beer pours an opaque used motor oil black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a ring of lacing. The aroma is of milk and dark chocolate, graham cracker, toffee, vanilla, and is rather prominent. The taste is full of roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, graham cracker, and hints of coffee. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the best RIS I have had. I really like the fact that it isn't overly hoppy the way a lot of American made RIS tend to be. If this were available to me locally it would be one of my go to stouts."
"Overall: Very tasty and very drinkable, and something I'd like to have again."
"D: What an awesome RIS. Hopefully this becomes easier to find in IL."
"the sweet and sour dryness was an odd take on the style, but nice nonetheless."
" Overall a decent RIS, but not outstanding. I'm glad I got to try it and I threw a couple down in the cellar to see what some age does to this one."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Incredible. My new favorite stout! IMO similar to Surly Darkness and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Definitely recommended!"
"D: Bold & Beautiful."
"A nice Hoppy Imperial Stout, will enjoy this one again soon."
"Notes: This one reminded me a lot of Dark Lord."
"D - Overall, a good beer and my first from Dark Horse. Have to say it was a good beer but nothing too outstanding especially in the RIS category. It does drink really well for the style and whatever the ABV is I really don't taste any of it. A good beer and look forward to trying some more from this brewery. A tasty and easy, not challenging RIS, that has everything I like in one without being overpowering."
"Wow, they really did bottle this again. Huge thanks to Kkulacki for this one. A big surprize. Pours extremely still, with only a small, belated rising of tiny brown bubbles. ring of bubbles holds throughout and lacing makes the whole deal look tremendous. Body is oil slick black. Strong, sweet chocolate truffle odor. really, exactly like a choco truffle. some maple, burnt malts. hint of vanilla, cherry. Flavor is at first quite extreme on the burnt side of the spectrum. like licking a grill. It quickly becomes a decadent prism of flavors though...more of that truffle-like chocolate, burnt malts, vegetal hops, coffee grounds, bitterness. The finish and lingering flavor is of a toasted chocolate marshmallow. Creamy, viscous mouthfeel. Very thick. A tasty, tasty treat, all around. Please Konrad, may i have another?"
"Not a bad beer overall but, given my excellent past experiences with other brews from Dark Horse, I expected a little more than I got. Drinkable but not terribly memorable."
"Intense dark chocolate and roasted barley flavors up front. Very baking chocolatey with strong espresso bitterness. Some sweetish dark fruits underneath and lurking alcohol warmth. Finish is herbal hop bitterness and more intense coffee/baking chocolate bitterness. Not bad, although it seems to be lacking some complexity. A little too baking chocolate-y and coffee bitter. Medium body seems a little light for the style and intense flavors. Maybe a bit undercarbonated too. Still a decent beer, just not as great as I was hoping for!"
"Let this one age a little bit and it'll reward you handsomely."
"NOTE: Finally did enough research to find the GREAT one, BRoss242, sent me this in BigsBIF."
"the mouthfeel was very full coats your mouth and throut as it goes down."
"Tasted blind against Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel, Stone Imperial Russian Stout, Dark Horse Imperial Stout, Southampton Imperial Russian Stout, Rogue XS Imperial Stout, Great Divide Yeti, Bells Expedition, Alesmith Speedway Stout, Victory Storm King, Thirsty Dog Siberian Night, Pizza Port Santas Little Helper, Avery The Czar, Hawks DMs Imperial Stout, Three Floyds Dark Lord, Bear Republic Big Bear Black, North Coast Old Rasputin, and two of Scott Jacksons homebrewed Impys. Dark Horse Imperial Stout impressed be, taking 3rd place for me, among 19 other Imperials. Black. Rich malts in the nose, with hints of chocolate, roast, fruit, tar and tocacco. Flavor is full of charred fruits and chocolate. A very good Imperial Stout."
"This beer is pretty nice, but I can't help but think that at least a slight level of carbonation would have made this beer quite a bit better (in both its aromatic and flavor qualities). In fact this beer would be approaching stellar if it was a bit carbonated."
"Pours black with no head at all. I spent a few minutes trying to look through the glass to no avail. Smells mostly of chocolate, some roasted coffee. Taste is of sweet chocolate, slight hints of espresso, and some roasted bitterness. Coffee is really present in the aftertaste. I'm not a huge stout fan but this could definitely help change my mind. Silky smooth and pleasent mouthfeel with little to no carbonation. This is the fastest I've ever finished a 750ml in one sitting."
"A very nice, rich stout from dark horse. They don't do much bad."
"This Dark Horse stout pours an increadibly dark black color with purple hues and no head whatsoever. Looks like motor oil. Carbonation was lacking. Aroma is plums, charcoal, molasses, vanilla bean, and alcohol esters. Taste begins sweet with a chocolate syrup consistency. Fruity flavors, dark fruits, open this beer up esp when it gets warmer. Bitter chocolate comes then the finish is this really roasted grain astringency. I loved this beer but it finishes a little too harsh for my liking. I would also like some carbonation to liven up the mouthfeel. Nice and thick and rich, this could be really really good if they tweak a few things."
"Feel is smooth and quite quick with a moderate silky medium heftified body. As it finishes it gains a bit more heavier tone and character. Mild and sweetly dark with partial chocolate and dark fruit layers build a bit as it goes. Not quite what I was expecting given the other Dark Horse goodies I've had and liked, but good enough to try. Give me their Black Bier though and I'll be content enough."
"Pours thick opaque black, nearly entirely devoid of head - even after quite the vigorous pour. My nostrils are assailed by oily pungency - coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted grain, and even a hint of dark fruit. Taste is what you would expect based on the aroma, just a little weaker. Starts out with coffee and chocolate, subtle raison is noted. Some roasted grain comes in, and is most noticeable in the aftertaste. Hops are barely discernable, but are there in meek form. Mouthfeel is not as thick/chewy as I would have expected, but it is still pleasantly oily. Decent imperial stout. As cheap as these are, I wouldn't mind grabbing another and putting some age on it."
"Overall a nice full-bodied Imperial, though very unbalanced. Alcohol sharpness is very intrusive and mouthfeel is watery and uneventful. Nice bold dark roasted malt flavors, but get squelched by the alcohol presence. Bold, strong but unrefined."
"This beer definitely looks thick as it pours, and I was convinced it was flat as I completed the pour. However, after a few moments a thin layer of dark brown bubbles formed atop the beer, only to disappear before I made it to a comfortable place to sit. The aroma has a slight hint of musty fruit, intermingled with coffee, alcohol, and brown sugar notes. The flavor is powerful, with highly evident tobacco flavors that are accented by coffee, cocoa, and pure alcohol. A bit of an earthy note is in there as well, with a moderate sweetness wrapping things up. Mouthfeel is very silky and seems nearly devoid of carbonation, even though visibly carbonation is evident. Drinkabilty is surprisingly good for such an assertive beer. Not sure how old this one is, but a few years of age would have rounded it out nicely. Yet another fine beer from this ""Dark Horse""..."
"Three years later shared a bottle that was great chocolate and incredible aroma."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed only the slightest layer of brown bubbles over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Lacing is more or less non-existent, but the viscosity of the brew does leave a nice film when the glass is swirled, which I think should be worth something. Aroma is heavy oatmeal and dark fruits. Taste strikes first with the soft oatmeal, then the fruit chimes in for a moment, eventually giving way softly to more dark malts, and some coffee bitterness at the close. Warmth is evident upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth for such a heavy beer, no doubt the oats' doing, and drinkability is quashed a bit by the heartiness of the malts, but overall for the style this brew is reasonably approachable. Check it out yourself and make sure I've made the right call."
"For this style, this is a very drinkable beer. Fans of Old Rasputin will really like this one."
"Mouthfeel is as thick and chewy as it appears. Rests heavy on the palate, coats everything. Legs imply a double-digit alcohol content. Don't understand the name, as it comes in a 12-oz bottle. Thanks to trbeer for this sample."
"I'm guessing 10% ABV or more."
"Drinkability is good. True to style, strong, thick, filling and syrupy. Broad, round complex flavors, nice transitions."
"Interesting beer and hard to rate for some reason. Dark Horse has something of a penchant for stouts, and this doesn't really disappoint. A bit intense through the first sip or two, but give it a few minutes -- it really gets quite good."
"Pours thick, black, and almost flat. A very tiny ring of brown head formed around the edge of the glass, even after a hard pour. Smells of coffee, molasses, fuggles (a type of English hop), and some alcohol. Tastes of coffee, chocolate syrup, and a faint alcohol. This beer is really sweet and the flavors I've described above are really strong. The roast flavors almost have a feeling about them...like tiny roast bits of grains sand-papering my tongue. Also a note about the chocolate, it's a delicate and sofisticated chocolate, not a dry (baker's chocolate) or waxy (Nestle's) chocolate. The sweet hangs around heavy and hot on the back of the tongue. This is definitely a thick-bodied beer, which is appropriate for the style. Not sure the ABV, but I'll bet it's high. I could still pick out the alcohol burn despite the 'in-your-face' potent sweet, roast, and chocolate flavors. I recommend this beer for those interested in the style."
