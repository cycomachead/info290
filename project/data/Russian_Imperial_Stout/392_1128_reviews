"Overall: Terrible one of the worst beers I've ever had, I would give it a second chance encase it really was just a bad bottle but I'm not going to be doing that any time soon."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Usual midnight black in appearence, light head but rich coffee/espresso aroma. Full bodied with a truly robust flavor. I'm becoming a big Weyerbacher fan & this only adds fuel to the flame."
""
""
"Overall - It's a good beer, but for me there's not quite enough depth in the darker qualities that make for my kind of imperial stout. All in the same, glad I got to try it."

"This is my favorite beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer - an awesome feel and an awesome taste!"
""
"Overall- I'm not an expert on the RIS style but I do not think this is how it should be. It tasted like vinegar. This bottle came from a case from a friend who also said it was terrible. No freshness date. This beer may of been bad from the brewery or outdated but my review will still reflect what I tasted. Poor vinegar."
""
""
"One of my favorite beers from Weyerbacher. Vastly underrated."
""
"Most Weyerbacher is barrel stored if not aged it seems. It provides a heavy liquor after taste which some may find appealing. I feel that stout goes in one glass and whiskey in the other!"
""
""

"beautiful pour.  Thick black, pours like oil.  Has a sheen to it.  Burnt brown.  Thick creamy head of mousse like foam.  Falls slowly, hugs the glass and leaves lace.  Crisp toasty bread. Sugar sweetens the malt scent.  Nose is sweet chocolate, caramel, toasty nuts.  Soft bread.  Drinks with a touch of molasses for an underpinning,  sweet malty and deep.  Little bit of warmth as it finishes form the alcohol.  That molasses is the last thing on the palate with a bit of stickiness."

"Pours a nice deep black, with no light getting through. The head is dark tan and burns off quickly, leaving only a bit around the rim with no lacing. The aroma comes into its own as it warms, with nice coffee and sweet alcohol notes. The taste is big on dark roasted malt, with some deeper burnt sugars. The body has a little oily quality and just a hint of bite from the alcohol."
""
""
"Overall- Not a favorite of mine, but not a horrible beer"

"Overall a very good stout. Wish the taste had more sweet than bitter chocolate but otherwise very good. Bet it would be great barrel aged. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good RIS deep black with brown head of varying color.  Excellent aroma of coffee and malt.   Smooth with a hint of bitterness.  Lingering aftertaste is both sweet and acidic like coffee."
""
"Overall (3.9): I was expecting more from this offering. Its just above average for me, considering its a RIS, and nothing that stands out to warrant a revisit. Both the taste and mouthfeel are subdued. It seems more like a regular stout, and i would've probably rated it a little higher if it was rated as such. Maybe a good starter RIS, but for someone like myself who regularly indulges in world class stouts, this misses the mark by quite a bit."

"great stout"

"Light as an imperial stout on flavors and after it warms up even the aroma falls off along with the little flavor that was there. Carbonated head and dissipates quickly. Light bodied, honestly light all around, not something I would go back to. Sorry weyerbacher I do like your beers but pass on this one for me."
"Overall: I don't have much to say about this beer, but it is infact excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: expected more from the taste given the smell, but it was fine overall. I think with a better body, I'd put this I a list of must have again, but as is, I won't avoid or seek it."
""
""

""

"Overall - Tasty and very easy to drink. Kind of a hybrid between a regular and a imperial stout. Enough flavour to keep it interesting and a little something for everyone taste wise."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt, toast, cinnamon – apple pie, dark fruit, chocolate and alcohol. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Taste is of roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, plums, black current, chocolate, charcoal and herbal hops. Finish is long and dry. Complex, delicious RIS."

"Overall: A very good imperial stout. A little sweeter tasting and lighter feeling than typical for the style but it still delivers the big roasty taste very well with some nice dark fruit notes."
"Overall it seems like a good beer for those who want to try out Imperial Stouts, by definition an Imperial is a good a lot bolder than a normal stout, and Old Heathen is a good baseline. Still, it lacks the complexity and attention to detail you'd expect from a true world-class offering."

"O: This is a decent beer. I am having trouble box it into one category of taste. It doesn't present with a single strong forward element. So hooray for balance - but it leaves it a bit unspectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a solid beer, although a little sweeter than I was expecting for a stout. The strong coffee and chocolate finish is definitely very pleasant. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's ironically not that bad, but it's nothing like I expected, or unfortunately reminding me anything of a regular imperial stout."

"Overall: Haven't had this one since my original review in 2006 (thanks then to BeerBeing, one of the great BAs from the old days) but this is a much better beer than I remember so I am going to consider this one a re-review"

"It's not gonna be my favourite RIS, but definitely one of the good ones."

"O/D-Had Heresy before this and was very pleased with how this beer took to the barrel. A pretty standard big Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The flavors never really meld well in this one; with too much bitter graininess which does not compliment the roasted flavors all that well. Not an imperial I would frequent too often."
""
""
"O: OK; not the best RIS I’ve ever head, for sure, but inoffensive and an easy drinker. Lacks any strong characteristics - i.e., it's not big and roasty or filled with chocolate, or molasses, or even fruit. But it's going down easy enough."
""
""
""
""
""
"Starting off very rich and creamy, Old Heathen shows its American influences with its somewhat naked dry finish that exposes rougher edges of its roast, along with a certain citrus pith and pine-like bitterness as the ale closes."
""
""
"Overall, a quite good example of the style, very subdued. Think I'll have another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good and well restrained brew for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the best and well balanced Imperial Stouts I have had; another winner from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
"But I never know quite what to expect with this stout every 3-5 months when I try one. More often than not, it's something I can have 3 of in one sitting and not take too much damage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer but unexceptional to my palate. This needs a bit more oomph to really deliver."
""
"A great Imperial Stout that is very easy to drink and has a lot of great roasted malt flavor. Alcohol is hidden very well. This would pair great with some chocolate desserts after dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
"M&O: medium-plus bodied, lightly effervescent on the palate and decently executed, this Imperial Stout ticks the boxes as a quality craft beer although I’d say the balance on the palate gears towards the sweeter side which takes off a few points on the overall performance to me."
"Overall not a bad stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is by far, at this point, is one of the best Imperial Stoudts I've ever had. Perfect for a cold fall/early winter day. You will not disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer, nothing outstanding in any particular category but a really nice, solid package, with few mistakes. A nice, drinkable impy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very strong beer, not just in flavor but I believe this is 8%. Interesting experience. The beer is very bold and if you are a person who is adventurous and love to try new beers, this is one you should get your hands on."

"O: A lighter fruitier stout with good flavor throughout. I would have liked a little more complexity and i wish it was bigger but definitely a sessionable stout. /85"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark brown with two big fingers of fluffy tan head. The head lingers for a significant time. The nose has definite roasted malt notes. Roasted malt comes through upfront in the flavor profile, as well. The finish has a strange sweet note that seems definitely out of place."
""
""
""
""
"O- This one was interesting, it drank like a milk stout with RIS malty strength. The flavor was actually quite enjoyable, but the mouthfeel seemed a bit thin for the wealth of flavor. The alcohol is hidden brilliantly and drinks as easy as a milk stout"

"Pretty good stout, I've had better but its up there. Definitely worth trying, good flavor, decent body. Weyerbacher doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While this is a solid brew, it’s not the best thing I’ve had from Weyerbacher…the flavor is very drinkable and it’s lighter body lend itself to being able to drink a couple in one sitting, I have to say overall I was a bit disappointed…for me, imperial stouts should have a chewiness that I can really get a hold of and a bit more depth in flavor, which Old Heathen lacks…while its good, it’s not great and for me isn’t worth the higher price tag that this brew commands…if like me, you find it on a mix-a-six wall, then by all means scoop one up, but I won’t be stocking my fridge or closet full of this one…(3.5/5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Damn, this is a great stout! Very roasty, very chewy, very tastey! I could drink these all day, though at the 8% ABV, I’d be on the floor! Definitely getting this again. Could become my standard imperial stout."
"O: This was a little thin for RIS , more like a imperial porter. I would say it is above average for the category, but far from the top."
""
""
""
""
"D: lacking a bit in complexity as I mostly find roasty and otherwise one-note. I kind of wish this was Heresy, a much superior brew imo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think Weyerbacher is really stepping up their game. Heresy and Old Heathen seem to be getting better every time I've tried it and they've redone all their label artwork and have done a fantastic job with it. I think Old Heathen is slowly making its way into my regular squad."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was drinking this and was saying to myself this is really more of a Russian imperial, and once I looked it up there you go. Very easy to drink...I wouldn't exactly compare this to my favorite imperials stouts but does the job after a long day's work. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice RIS with good flavor and body"
""
"Overall: Great. Would gladly pick this up again. I've had better but not too many. If you're a fan of the style or just starting out you could do a lot worse"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is serious stuff. Not for fratboys taking their first steps away from Coors Light. I'll confess my bias in truly loving Weyerbacher's beers, but I don't think that's a bad/wrong thing. They're awesome and Old Heathen is another in their line of excellent beers."
""
""
""
""
"O - A great complexity and perfect execution. This stout has a lot to offer."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"MF - Smooth, but generally non-descript."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit on the lighter side for an imperial. No astringency. Well balanced but drinks a lot like porter. Thin."
""
"I always like how these imperial stouts pour, with that dark abyss in the glass topped by a ruddy foam. I didn't get a strong impression of the smell of this one, but then again, it was 70 degrees out and my allergies were probably in the way. As for taste, it was a touch watered down for me. For this style, I prefer them to be big and bold. This was very drinkable, but for that, I'd prefer a tamer milk stout with less alcohol. I didn't catch any of that plum rind tartness here, but it did have a slight bit of chocolaty goodness that you'd expect. Overall it was solid, but nothing special for me."
""
"poured into a nonic pint glass. pitch black with two fingers of head that dissipated to a thin film.smells of some faint dark fruit notes but mostly roasted malts with very little hop presence. a fair amount of coffee notes.taste follows the nose well but with a little bit of oxidization. fairly bitter with a fairly long coffee after taste that's pretty dry. good thick mouthfeel that coats the mouth with some slickness. overall a good Ris."
"Not my favorite RIS by any means. The acidic feel and the heavy dried dark fruit presence doesn't result in the smoothest experience by any means. Just feels a bit thin and one dimensional I guess."
"O - I will have to try it again assuming I got a bad one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied yet smooth, washes down easily. Alcohol shows up a bit much and the acrid bitterness of the roast grain lands a little hard, but otherwise easy drinking and assertive stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Likable, but at the same time, a bit aimless and meandering in its complexity. It comes across undecided whether it wants to be big, roasty, and dry or sweet, fruity, and chocolaty, and ergo doesn't really do either facet fabulously. This is a good off-the-shelf RIS that has the misfortune of competing with MANY great ones (such as Old Rasputin)."
""
"O - The wind is howling outside as snow whirls around; the perfect time to enjoy a beer such as this. Very dark and roasted, Old Heathen is a malty beast with smoky notes and burnt coffee for an aggressive grittiness and bitter finish. Maybe not the greatest Russian imperial out there, but far more drinkable in terms of alcohol than quite a bit of them."
""
""
"This is one of the best imperial stouts I've tasted. You will enjoy it if you like a bold stout. It is complex, and every time I drink it, I get something new. Definitely a beer to drink again."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into nonic pint glass. Dark brown oily pour, yielding a single-finger head even with a very aggressive pour. Smells sweet up front, with roasted undertones. Taste is delicious; coating your whole mouth with sweetness, then the roast-ness comes in and finishes. Leaving some nice lacing as I drink as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. A great RIS, a great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this is just an OK Imperial Stout. I've had much better, and this experience affirms I am not a massive fan of Weyerbacher, no offense. Glad I tried it. Cheers."
""
"Very dark, pitch black in fact, body which is topped with a halo of thin head. The aroma is an interesting blend of sweet chocolate with soft notes of roasted coffee but alcohol peaks it's head in your nose and takes over. Taste is spiked by hazelnut and accentuated by an oily mouth-feel. Lingering flavor is balanced roasted nuts and coco."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well crafted imperial stout. The alcohol packs a punch but is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
"O- Good for the style. Would get again."
""
""
"This beer has held up mightily well, but perhaps peaked mere months ago. I can't remember if I've ever had a fresh taste, but now I want to to compare. A delicious and easy-going imperial stout."
"Taste emphasizes the grain notes. Sweetness predominates, but the brew is not reminiscent of fruits. Really what come to mind is the best root beer float you've ever had: earthy and creamy, with the mildest of hoppy finishes. At a manageable 8%, I'm going to call this a session stout, and one to be reckoned with."
""

""
""
"Re-tasted and I hold with this high review, must taste against Narwhal, TenFidy, Boris, Old Rasputin, Founders and more because they are all so great and all clustered together around 4.5. This one probably at 4.2."
"O-I thought it lacked a bit of head retention and body, but the flavors were excellent. I would most certainly drink it again"
""
""
""
"O - A poor example of what even a basic RIS should be."
""
"O: I feel like I might be giving this a 4.0 rather than a 3.5 overall only because I really like Russian Imperial stouts. The beer looks really good and it has a great mouthfeel, but the smell and taste were a bit of a let down."
""
""
""
"not a bad stout at all - weak in comparison to some of the RIS that i've been drinking lately, but considering the low abv for the style, it's pretty solid."
"The fruitiness plum flavor comes out more as it warms too. The tastes all come together in unison asa top notch quality russian imperial craft beer."
""
""
"edit: boy does this age well!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours nearly black with a bit of ruby. Small tan head. Not much lacing. Aroma is quite nice: rich, dark malts, roasted barley, some chocolate and vanilla, touch of coffee. Some alcohol rises to the nose. Flavor is incredibly smooth; wonderfully creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is roast malt, some chocolate, coffee, and vanilla, a touch of licorice. Some earthy hops and a dry finish."
"The 8% alc/vol is very masked. It has a silky smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation, but is a little too light-bodied for the Imperial style."
"O: I'd like to try this one again, but this is a weak effort. This might be an example of a bad bottle, or a bad beer from a usually stellar brewery. I'll revisit my review if I try another one."
""
"Overall - While it's a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout in my opinion, I have had quite a few that are better."
""
""
"Not a big imperial stout guy, but in comparison to most in the style this is lighter and more balanced. Still bold, but not the kick in the teeth an imperial stout can be. Can’t decide if that's a good thing or not. Probably a little less exciting than the best imperials."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I definitely would love to have this beer be close by me. This might be a go to imperial stout for me."
""
""
""
"O: Really solid IS nothing that will blow your socks off but it comes in an affordable six pack so if you like the style I recommend it worth a try if not a good late night finisher"
""
""
" A little too watery and lacking in flavor but its not horrible. I've definitely had worse stouts. Its kind of like an imperial version of a poorly done stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good Imperial Stout, and while it doesn’t have the punch and kick of some of its higher ABV peers, it does offer a good presentation of a lighter form of those flavors. The profile as a whole is perhaps slightly overly skewed toward ash and tobacco, and I personally felt like the brew cried out for a bit of bourbon barrel-aging for extra depth, complexity, and flavor. But for a non-BBL brew—especially for one with a comparatively low ABV—it’s quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into DFH Immort Ale glass. Pour is dark black like oil with a small tan/white head. Very appetizing. SMell is licorice, molasses, and faint dark fruit. Taste is more of the same, rich, chocolatey, molasses and a touch of licorice with a tinge of dark fruit. The only problem (if you want to call it a problem) with this beer is that it is a touch too thin. Everything else is spot on. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and will certainly buy more in the future (ie, this weekend ;)"
""
""
""
"This was a wonderful Imperial Stout. A little pricey though. Maybe look for a Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout as a cheaper alternative."
""
""
""
"Wow, what the hell? This is a very unimpressive Imperial Stout. In some senses (say, the lack of complexity) it feels thin and weak, in others (say, the cloying sweetness), it feels excessive and overpowering. This is a very unfortunate brew in my book—bridging the gap between cloying and bland-as-fuck. That was a gap that should never have been bridged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very decent RIS. It’s not overly complex, but its not simplistic either. I wish the sweet dark fruits would come out more like in the nose because this beer would be absolutely fantastic if they did. the alcohol is very well hidden in the taste in this one. Overall, a nice offering by Weyerbacher and I would probably try this one out again."
""
"This is a decent, well flavored beer. It's not as viscous or boozy as many in the RIS category are. It also has a pretty decent drinkability. Its worth checking out."
""
"The beer is dark brown with a spotty beige head. The aroma brings peanut butter, roast. Wow, I am oddly taken aback a bit by the roasted peanut scent. The flavor is roasted circus peanuts. Mediocre. Call it a peanut beer if that's what you were aiming for. Medium bodied. Eh...no thank you."
""
""
""
"O - This does not stand out as ""superb"" in a style that has been define for adversity and wealth of flavor. Being one of my favorite styles I have had my fair variety and I can say this is a fair deal for 6 bottles at around $12, but I would prefer many others."
""
"Overall, a decent beer, but a bit unrefined. The initially acrid flavor mellows in time, but is fairly offputting."
"Single finger tan head on a near jet black body. Very nice lacing. Vanilla and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with some dark fruit mostly raspberry and cherry. Roasted malt, vanilla, brown sugar as toffee form the smooth flavor. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. A very nice flavorful stout but doesn't quite stand out in the genre."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer and in my opinion an awesome example of what a Russian Imperial Stout should be, sipping this I feel like a Czar regal and powerful this is a very nice beer to enjoy anytime of year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel -- Bright effervescence with a lingering chocolate coating on the tongue. Hey, this isn't a session beer, take your time!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite good, and then some."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the most complex Imperial Stout, but seriously satisfying."
"Nice RIS for the price point. Love the fact that it comes in sixers, making it easy to cellar. Will have again, Cheers!"
"O: Overall a strong product, and great value for price. Can't wait to see what age would do to the characters in this one. Very good representative of its class."
""
"Overall: I find myself rather liking this beer, though it is a bit off-point for style. I would really enjoy a touch more body, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good RIS and is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"What else to say. Its a great beer and I definitely will pick this up again if I see it."
""
"O - A touch of hops and a little bit more of dry finish would knock this out of the park. Still, a very solid year round offering."
""
""
""
"O: Seems like this is more on the American imperial stout side than the RIS side, but that could just be me. As it warms, the RIS side come out more, though. Solid year-round beer, obviously would be better in the later fall and winter months. Worth a buy"
""
"Overall, not great, or even good. I will not seek this one out again."
""
""
""
"O: Another delicious offering from Weyerbacher. This beer is complex, well balanced, and delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't know exactly how this compares to other RISs since i'm not too familiar with the style, but this is a fine stout nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Not much head, about a quarter finger, quick dissipation resulted in thin broken layer on top of dark brown opaque body with some faint red highlights. Big chocolate presence up front, dark with some cocoa nibs, fruit nose, citrus, no noticeable coffee aromas. Chocolate dominates the malt forward taste, some toffee, a bit of coffee and citrus hops for balance but fairly malt forward. Mouthfeel is creamy, a bit on the full side of medium, good effervescence, a bit sticky. A bit more malt depth than Old Rasputin, IMHO, other than the appearance re lack of head pretty tasty stuff."

"This imperial stout is fine, but I just wish it was bolder and more pronounced. It just isn't too memorable."
""
""
"Carbonation could be a bit higher."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite imperial stout, but a nice sweet and bitter brew, almost meat-like"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a pretty nice example of the style. Weyerbacher did a nice job of making a well balanced easy to drink imperial stout."
""
""
"O: A really solid RIS. This beer was a joy to drink and savor. Recommended."
""
""
"Subtle notes of dark fruits are present along with other flavors that would take hours to pin point. An overall great beer though. Looking forward to trying heresy now seeing as this is the base."
""
"This is a great imperial stout. While the flavor doesn't match the mesmerizing smell, it's still refreshing and drinkable given the ABV."
"Love the label and the fact this is readily available to my state and pours a black as night hue which leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and little lacing,the smell is dark malts,milky coffee,sweet alcohol and hops pretty average actually,the mouthfeel is only light-medium bodied and too light for my RIS's and has tastes of chocolate malts,milky coffee,dark fruits and finished with a pine hop bitterness but overall its only above average and i hate to say it but i was expecting way more and can think of way more better RIS's and wouldnt buy this again but would drink if offered cheers."
""
"O- A very solid Russian Imperial Stout. somewhat low in ABV for the style IMO but very tasty. Definitely worth the buy."
"Review from notes. Pours pitch black into dimpled mug with a brown lacy head of about a quarter inch. Smells of malt and a smokey peat. Taste/mouthfeel; good rich flavor right up front, nice blend of malt and the aforementioned smokiness. Good amount of carbonation to keep it lively and not slick, the abv was barely noticeable. Overall a very good imp stout and another solid one from Weyerbacher."
""

"O: There's some great complexity to this beer, and it's an imperial stout on the lower end of the alcohol spectrum (8%). That alcohol level hits a sweet spot for me; just enough to lend some fruity complexity and warming, but not enough to be noticeable simply as ""big alcohol."" Highly recommended."
""
""
"O - An excellent imperial stout. The alcohol, while slightly warming, is nearly undetectable. The smoothness of this brew really blew me away."
""
""
""
"O - What the F is going on with the aroma of this brew? Its horrific. Hopefully a bad bottle/batch? The taste and everything else is great, but the aroma really throws this one for me. Throws it right into the 'never again' category. Unfortunately/fortunately, I have a 6 pack, so I'll give this one another (5) shots."
"O- I am fan of stouts in general, but this was my first brew from Weyerbacher. There is nothing that really stands out to me as being an exceptional beer, but it was definitely quite good. I would seek this one out again for sure. I look forward to trying some others from this brewery."
""
"Overall was really impress with this stout, having had it in the bottle previously and enjoying it I could not say I was wowed but this time is different. Chaulk it up to the cask or freshness perhaps maybe a developing palate but all in all the Weyerbacher folks deserve high praise for this fine specimen Outstanding!"
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the simplicity. Nothing really goes overboard here, but at the same time it takes a while for this one to catch your attention. The beer drinks smoothly, especially with warmth, but it is too light in the mouth. It should be more rich, boozier, and stickier for the style. Additionally, the level of sweetness makes us think that this would be better classified as a milk/sweet stout, as there is nothing really dark and imperial about it."
""
""
"O-A nice RIS, not much chocolate but it makes up for it with a strong roasted malt presence."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid beer for the style, enjoyable for drinking in the cold of winter, and enjoyed by most of my Super Bowl attendees. Not too sessionable but I could a couple of these in an evening."
"O: This beer tastes strong, but the alcohol is well masked from the taste. It is a good beer to sip."
"O - A very good beer. Surprisingly sweet with a great chocolate aftertaste. Weyerbacher is my most local brewery so I try everything they make, and this is one of their best offerings I have had."

"O: Overall the beer was a nice imperial stout. The stout hits on some of the standard imperial favors, chocolate, roasted malts and caramel and delivers well with it. I would definitely recommend trying this stout."
""
""
"O- Solid imperial stout. If I had easier access to this beer I would make this my everyday stout during the winter. Would love to get a 1/6 brl of this and maybe run it through some coffee beans!"
"O - I really enjoyed the chocolate presence. The alcohol was subtle, yet noticeable. The mouthfeel was lacking, but overall a good beer."
""
"This is a fine, big beer though it could use some more complexity."
""
"O: A very good RIS. The nose and taste are so different. It is a touch sweet but still very easy drinking."
""
""
"Decent imp. stout but it needs more hops in my humble opinion. A little boring."
""
"12oz bottle purchased in Dec 2011 in a case from Shangy's in Emmaus, PA. Small, less than one finger head even with a hard pour. Color was dark, as I expected for an imperial stout. Yep, smelled like a heavy stout. Taste and mouthfeel were exceptional....agreed with my palette. I heard about Weyerbacher while in PA, so tasting their high-gravity beers were in order. I'll definitely buy this beer again."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black and poured brown head that did not last very long at all. The smell was kinda reminiscent of berries. The taste similar to brake fluid according to one taster. I did not like it but did not get the brake fluid thing. I will not be buying this beer again."

"Amazing beer. Pours ultra-black and has deep aromas of chocolate, coffee and everything you'd expect in a big bold stout. Amazingly complex in taste, full of the dark flavors and the chocolate and coffee come through nice and strong. Great smooth finish. Loved it."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 12/07/2010; so over a year old now. Pours thick opaque black color with a nice 1 finger dense tan head with decent retention that reduces to a thin cap. Nice bits of lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light dark fruits, and a bit of spiciness. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, nuttiness, light coffee, dark fruit, and spiciness. Hardly any bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and light spiciness on the finish for a bit. Some pretty nice balance of flavors here as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel that goes down nicely. Alcohol is pretty well hidden with only a warming on the finish. Overall a very nice and enjoyable imperial stout. Nothing that will blow you away though."
""
"O: A very nice, high value example of the style. I'm always looking for affordable options that aren't diminished in quality, and I always find that Weyerbacher fits the bill. Another very solid beer out of Pennsylvania. Recommended"
"One of the few pleasant memories I have left from my year in NoVa is of drinking some o' these bad boys. I hope it's still as good to me... It pours a decidedly dark and bleak black-brown (almost black) topped by a short finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa powder, light molasses, and a light kiss of char. Yup, it certainly smells dark. The taste brings in more of the same, with the roast coming off as darker, the molasses darker still, and some coffee coming in to make things as dark as we can. I've had darker, but not many. It's almost too dark... The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a damn fine impy stout, one of the best that's available year-round."

"thanks to mgp2675 for sending this as an extra! pours out as black as possible with no head just a thin brown ring and no lacing, and this was a very aggressive pour. smell is rather faint but can pick up on usual stout fragrances, chocolate, malts and what not. taste is slightly more exciting than the nose because the flavors are coming alive. mostly chocolate and roasted malts with a very well hidden 8%abv, notice very little alochol in the flavor profile. has a full body feel to it and little carbonation. a nice imperial stout that i'm glad i got the chance to try."
""
"This is a good imperial stout and I'm glad I was able to pick one up."
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, down the middle, fairly slow. Poured black, with a fluffy three inch head, that settles kind of quick, with a nice lace. Smell is dark fruits and a some breadyness, soap, and maybe a little chocolate. Taste is more chocolate and dark fruits, thank God. Body is on the thin side, good amount of carbonation, and easy to drink. This is a o.k imperial stout."
"O- Great success yet again for the WBC!"
"O: I am buying this again, a seriously good Imperial Stout, that is smooth, rich, and complex, but not overpowering in terms of malt and coffee that most I.S have."
"A good Imperial Stout, but leaves a bit to desired in appearance, complexity and body."
"O: A real bell-ringer for Weyerbacher. This is a really fantastic RIS. Definitely a big-time brew from a consistently good brewery."

"Really nice stout. well balanced and tastey. Id get a pint if I saw again...but wouldnt buy in the store since I just dont think this woud translate well in a bottle. Id really like a cask of this."
"QUITE NICE, CHECK IT OUT!"
"Overall, I really like this one. I need to get ahold of some Old Rasputin again so that I can compare it to Old Heathen. Haha. Hopefully I can find some more favorites in this style. I'll definitely be keeping this one in mind."
"Good carbonation, but a thinner body than I'd expected and a medium long, lingering alcohol finish."
"Drinkability/overall- i really did enjoy this beer the more i went on, i had decent expectation since i had always been a fan of the oak aged heresay, this is definitely one worth a look if looking for full rich stout"
"O: This is a nice one. I think I enjoyed heresy more, but this is still a fine offering and definitely worth a 6er."
"Notes: Always curious as to why it took so long to see this one through the years whereas the rest of the Weyerbacher releases are pretty much easily available. Anyhow, this lingers on classical interpretations with a lighter edge but still quite a pleasing ale. The fruity/sour edge is lost in the barrel aged version, which I prefer but to be fair that is an entirely different beast."
"Not a bad beer, but there are far better options, I enjoyed the Weyerbacher Heresy much more than this."
"I would choose almost any other RIS over this one. Too bad because it's a great local bargain, but just not for me."
"Not a distinctively overwhelming stout, but still pretty good. Poured a dark brown-black with a cap of chocolate-colored head. Malty aroma, dark chocolate, aged vanilla, and hints of dark fruits. Taste was roasty up front, cocoa, dark malts, raisins, a bit of a pithy sourness detectable...not sure if it was an off flavor or intentional, but it didn't really detract too much from the beer overall. Pretty smooth, but a little on the thin side for the style, being about medium-bodied, with the alcohol slightly noticeable. Decently drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being below average. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style. I really liked the bit of smoke I got in the finish, but a little more roasted character throughout the beer would have been nice. It was a pretty easy drinking and smooth beer of the style overall though."
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. At first the carbonation is a little heavy and hides the body of the beer. As it sat for a while, the carbonation lightened up, exposing a more full body."
"The flavor is great when sipped or taken in larger gulps, either way the malt expresses well with fantastic chocolate malt taste that lacks a lot of dark malt astringency. There is a moderately high level of caramel malt flavor but the hop spice stays in the background as a supporting roll. The toasted almost toffee like essence provides a nice complexity while some stone fruit from the yeast is evident. Overall a extremely drinkable stout --possibly my favorite offering from Weyerbacher, smooth drinkability which is coupled with relatively low alcohol in the taste for the style which I like- Kudos Weyerbacher!"
"This is a great brew from Weyerbacher. Great tastes and body that hide the 8% alcohol very well. I could see myself drinking a few of these to kick start my night. Great stuff."
"The beer has a nice overall flavor profile. Not a huge amount of depth or intensity, but certainly a drinkable beer. The body is medium with enough carbonation to keep it interestingly soft and creamy."
"A very good, but not great stout. Still recommended."
"O-not a bad beer but its pretty boring as an imperial stout. the one good thing to make up for that is the real low price and ease of drinking. however, i still don't think i'll be ordering this again unless my options are extremely limited."
"O - This beer didn't get me too excited. Pretty plain and lacked the depth of flavour usually associated with this style."
"Overall, Weyerbacher continues to deliver with affordable quality beers. This ""sessionable"" Russian Imperial Stout is often overlooked by many, including myself, because it is readily available and doesn't have it's own magical release day, but any fan of the style should/will enjoy this."
"Overall: Third Weyerbacher beer I have tried and I have enjoyed all three of them. In my opinion, I enjoyed this beer more than Heresy. Its really close tho, but Old Heathen is such solid RIS that it does not need the barrel aging to be a top notch beer!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a DFH Signature glass from a 12oz bottle,this Imperial Stout poured a jet black with a two finger tan head that left a fair amount of lacing. This beer has a very fruity aroma,blueberry and black cherry with just a hint of roasted malt,and maybe a bit of ash.This is a good smelling beer with just a hint of alcohol on the nose. Mouthfeel is medium thick and the carbonation gives it a frothy,creamy quality. The taste is surprisingly un-berry like,compared to the nose,with malt and sweet milk upfront and dark chocolate and coca following. The presence of alcohol is well hidden. This brew may be creamy and easy drinking,but it is also somewhat boring and lacking the punch of most Imperials. I'd much rather have a Heresy."
"I hate imperial stouts like this, not much roast or chocolate. Despite this, i can recognize a good beer designed like this, this beer is not one of them."
"Had this on tap in a 12oz. glass. It pours nicely black, with a good head, but it fades quickly. Alcohol hits the nose first quickly followed by lots of coffee. Chocolate, and roasty malts, as you would expect, quite subtle, which i liked, nice balance and slightly too thin mouthfeel, with nice bitterness. This was the last one of the night and it still stood up nicely overall."
"Overall this is not an awful beer by far but there are many many more better examples of Imperial Stouts out there. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall, a very solid example of the style that I could imagine putting in the regular everyday rotation (if it were distributed anywhere near here). It drinks more stout than ""imperial"" stout."
"nice aroma, rich cooca and coffee dominate with a nice touch of bitter and roasted malts that take over the profile very nicely. smooth, effortless flavor then wraps itself over the palate. light hints of vanilla mix in with the dark chocolate and rich roasted malts. small touch of alcohol but this fades quickly as it warms and leaves you with a nice touch of sweet vanilla and brown sugar that really compliments the cocoa and lightly hopped finish quite nicely"
"This is a good imperial stout compared to some of the other ones that I have tried. It has a pleasant aroma with a nice look to it. But everything else about this beer is average at best. I enjoy most of the beers that Weyerbacher puts out and as much as I wanted to enjoy this beer, I was rather indifferent to it."
"The mouthfeel is good, it's lightly carbonated and just a touch less than full-bodied. And the drinkability is quite good for a RIS, perhaps due to the fairly low ABV. This one wasn't all that much of a sipper. But you know what's really superb about this one? The price. This single ran me 2.09 at a fairly expensive store. I'm pretty sure six-packs run 12 dollars. That's a lot of good RIS for just a little bit of money."
"I wouldn't call this an outstanding imperial stout, but it's definitely a good beer. The flavor is a little harsh through the middle, but I still like it a lot. Also, at 8% alcohol and the medium body, it's not very imperial for a RIS, but it works. Very good, but not great."
"Another single to try. Not too impressed with this one as I prefer my big stouts to be a little more sweet than this one. Oh well, Weyerbacher makes a lot of good beers, I'll have those instead."
"D: No trace of the 8.0% ABV. Delicious balance of flavors. Good offering from Weyerbacher."
"This beer is ultra black when pouring it into a glass the look of oil always comes to mind. The few bubbles it had rise to the top and fade shortly after. The lacing wasn't too bad, kind of scattered about. The aroma was pretty strong with deep roasted malts and chocolate. The taste wasn't too bad either resembling similar characteristics of the aromas with the addition of some tasty hops in the finish. The Mouthfeel is thick without a doubt. The only other thought I have is that I would pass this one up if Heresy was right next to it."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it was as black as night, with a little tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin lace around the edge. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is very balanced well of malts and hops, i taste some chocolate on the back of the tongue. the mouth feel is ok. Overall this is a ok beer for me, i'm not really into dark beers but i like to try them."
"O- My favorite RIS to date. Such an easy beer to drink for so much going on. Heavy as hell in the ABV dept, but so easy and smooth to drink. Loved it from beginning to end."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm a big Weyerbacher fan, but I've also had some really great Stouts lately. This one is good, but it's not elite by any means. Would I drink it again...heck yeah! Am I likely to purchase a sixer of it, probably not. If you have friends that have never had an IS, this would be a good first step."
"Overall - Not impressed. Not offensive by any means, just uninteresting. Needs more body and more malty complexity. It's just roasty and malt in both taste and aroma."
"Overall, very well done brew, good balance in sweetness and bitterness."
"Just a touch too roasty for a perfect score here. Other than that though, this is highly drinkable and totally enjoyable. As a bonus, the 8.00%abv is very well hidden."
"Pours in a dark amber color. Pentiful & creamy foam, beige colored, unfortunately brief. Low carbonation doesn´t allow it to be recovered. Chocolate, coffee & mildly toasted notes in your nose; hops not felt. Low hoppy, bitternes & sweetness in your mouth. I expected a better taste after smelling it. A little flat in my humble opinion. Drinkable."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a soft, light level of carbonation that makes this brew excessively smooth in the feel and very easy drinking. The abv incorporation comes out with fruity esters throughout the experience but it is fitting."
"O: overall it is a good imperial stout."
"Pours a solid black with a finger of a tan head that rises quickly than all but disappears. Smells of chocolate, coffee, toffee, slightly sour with a hint of wet dog. I can't find much in the way of hops in the aroma. Taste is sweet and smooth with a lactic edge. Chocolate, coffee, toffee dominate the taste with maybe a hint of lactose? Smooth creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation with a medium body. Not a bad brew but reminds me more of an extra stout rather than a Russian Imperial Stout. The roast could be stronger and the slight sourness would again seem more at home in an extra stout."
"SMELLS SWEETER than it tastes ,,, dark but belies the flavor associated with its rich color,,, if you like flavor and not to bitter go with victory VVV storm king or even sam is better, never thought i d say that ,, unimpressed ,, wont be sippi n weyerbacher any time soon"
"Poured very dark brown with a small creamy tan head that was mostly diminishing and had some nice lacing. The aroma was of burnt bread malts, a mild resin hop and a sweet doughy yeast with hints of dark chocolate, coffee and molasses. It tasted malty and moderately sweet with notes of chocolate and molasses in the beginning and finished a bitter-sweet with a nice hint of coffee and hops at the end with the flavor lasting a nice while after the swallow. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy yet a little oily in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a very tasty and smooth Imperial Stout with really no taste of the high alcohol content. I also like the name…"
"D: This is a very well balanced, solid imperial stout. It doesn't bowl me over with amazingness, as some of my favorites do, and it's a bit light in the mouthfeel, but that's about everything negative I have to say about it. The alcohol is hidden away well - this is 8% ABV? Will definitely drink it again."
"D - Not too bad, nowhere near the best but still some pretty good stuff. The ABV. does get to you over time bringing this one down a notch or two. Still glad I tried it tho."
"i expect good things from weyerbacher and they did not disappoint here."
"A quality imperial stout, full of flavor, though a bit tame in the nose. Something that's locally available and definitely checking out again."
"Nothing over the top here, just a solid imperial stout. Grit & bitterness compounds. I like that it's comfortably seated at 8% abv."
"overall, this is a pretty decent beer. Not the best example of the style but a nice beer to enjoy"
"OVERALL: Nothing wrong or offensive about this beer, but nothing worth writing home about either. If you like your imperial stouts on the sweeter side, then this might just do it for you. Though I enjoy a little more bitterness, the main criticism is that the nose is too mute and the initial flavor is lacking. After the swallow it comes to life a little, but needs more upfront. One worth checking out if you see, but I won't need to go back."
"D- Pretty good, this one has gone down about 75% as I right this review. Nothing to cry about, nothing to write home about. Decent offering but would be an awesome Scotch Ale if that is what I was expecting."
"D - Easy drinking as they get, nice balance of sweet fruit and roast makes this easy to put away."
"D - Very smooth with little apparent alcohol."
"The mouth is smooth with a noticeable alcohol numb on the tongue. If you let enough time sit between the numb continues to feel on the throat it is very nice makes the next sip seem that much different."
"ALSO- If you make it to the brewery on a Saturday there is a free tour with unlimited free samples!"
"The thing that sets this Imperial Stout apart from many others is the belgian yeast characteristics, which Weyerbacher seems to do a lot. You definitely have that prevalent banana throughout. That, commingling with the smoked wood, really makes for one of the more unique RIS you will have."
"D - Like others have said this is definatley quaffable. The 8% is hardly noticeably as one drinks and drinks and drinks this tasty stout away."
"D - drinkable, but nothing spectacular to make you come back to it right away. At 8% it's fairly quaffable for the style"
"D - Yeah, this is good to drink. It's tasty, thought-provoking, and smooth. A very good beer."
"The drinkabilty is good as it has a low abv for a ris and the price is not bad either."
"Drinkability is average. With so many imperial stouts on the market, this one falls a bit short. Not a bad beer, but not really close to the usual suspects. A little more complexity in the nose and taste, plus a heavier body, would help this one out a bit."
"D: Old Heathen is like meeting up with an old friend -- you know what you're going to get, but it is a very enjoyable time nonetheless. Sweet and malty with abit of coffee and earthy hoppiness, this is a nice brew that I will come back to often."
"D: It's a decent Imperial Russian Stout. Good for a nightcap or during the winter nights. Drinks a lot better as it warms."
"From the tap to my glass, looked very dark and a typical dark foam about a finger thick. Some IRS have a disgusting sweet rotten molasses flavor. Others are more roasty. This one was the latter. Roasted malts and coffee notes. The take home message on this beer is that it is the most drinkable IRS I've ever had, I really appreciate that. Great balance, a little less complex than Old Rasputin, but its taste and drinkability was very close. This is a good thing. I really enjoyed this as I could've easily had a second pint..not something I can say for all IRS. Great Brew!!"
"The mouthfeel is nice and thick. The flavor is a bit weird at first. It almost has a metallic tangy note Along with that is some dark malts, roasted malt, chocolate, and some alcoholic. The next sip is mroe of a roasted flavor. It is a bitter, roasty imperial stout."
"D- A nice stout, I'm still trying to grasp what the vinegar-like flavor was in this one, again, it wasn't strong and by no means lessened my enjoyment of this beer, I think it actually made it better, reminded me of a few sours I've had, but it was much more subtle than that."
"Great drinkability in the end. It's not the greatest RIS, but it is tasty, and the ABV is low, and easy to put back. I think this is easily the most sessionable RIS I've had."
"D: It was fairly smooth and I honestly couldn't detect any alcohol at all, but overall this was a bit underwhelming."
"D-very smooth, nicely balanced, and the alcohol isn't too overwhelming. Unfortunately it tastes a little thin"
"d- really nice, i'd drink this again, this is one of the better offerings from weyerbacher that i've just gotten around to trying now."
"D - for being 8 percent, this one doesn't drink like it. This isn't too bold of a RIS, but it is pretty good for what it is. It exhibited the standard chocolate and coffee flavors but nothing too much outside of it. Definitely worth a try if you want a decent stout."
"Drinkabilty - Im shocked its 8% cause it feels like a 5%. Nothing special, so many better ones out there. Put this up against hoppin frog boris r.i.s or old rasputin and you will see the difference. Maybe a good starter r.i.s, but seasoned vets skip this, its a waste of a drink."
"The finish is a little thick, but this is where the malt finally shines. The raisin and fig fades and the roasted malt becomes more apparent, and it is delicious. Thick body and good carbonation, very drinkable."
"Fairly decent drinkable beer. But nothing too exciting about it. Not a big flavorful brew."
"D - complex yet balanced stout. Good stuff."
"Bottle. Poured into a large tulip glass. Pours a dark brown/black color with a nice 2 finger head that quickly settles to form a slight coaster of light tan head. Medium mouthfeel. Dark chocolate, slight coffee, and milk chocolate aroma. A fairly sweet start with some hints of dark fruit along with dark chocolate, roast malt, and a tiny bit of leather. Some lingering bitterness. Overall, not a bad imperial stout but nothing extraordinary as well."
"Poured into a pint glass, Old Heathen has a very dark brown body (nearly black). It yielded a 1/2 inch of mocha colored head without much retention or lacing. There is a nice chocolate nose to this, with some coffee and sweeter malts coming through as well. The taste is just like the aromas, just not as defined, somewhat subdued. This stout as a lighter body than i expected, with adequate carbonation. I didn't get much alcohol in this at all, and was a really easy drinker for the style and ABV (I cant really read the dating on the bottle, so maybe it is slightly older and had a few months to cool down)"
"Overall quite enjoyable, but a little less robust than I was expecting for the style. I did like it quite a bit and I'm sure I'll have it again so a revisit to this review may be forthcoming."
"D: Very drinkable, but it suffers from a poor mouthfeel. Overall, not too bad."
"Not my favorite RIS but a solid selection and a beer I'd be happy drinking any day."
"To me, this feels, drinks and smells like an export stout. It tastes more akin to a Russian Imperial Stout, but in all other ways it doesn't rank. Were I measuring this as an export stout, I think it would be nearly perfect, as a Russian Imperial Stout ... it's merely good."
"D: This is a decent-tasting beer but it lacks all the intangibles."
"Dark black in color with one finger of tan head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. Rich aroma of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. The aroma is every bit as good as any other RIS I have sampled. The flavor is not quite as good and that is due to the amount of alcohol that overwhelms the flavor in the finish. Starts off malty with chocolate and a mild roasted note. I get some cherries and plums as well. More bitter than sweet. Has enough of a body for a RIS but stops short of being viscous and creamy. Well done carbonation. Absolutely enjoyable RIS from Weyerbacher. I will have to keep a lookout for this beer in the future."
"D- Great stout. It hides its 8% alcohol well but still has the warming feel. Definitely worth a space in the cellar."
"Conclusion: No idea how old this might be w/out a date; I've had it myself for about 7 months. Still, this style is generally fine to hold onto, so I don't really know what's going on here. Nothing tastes bad here, but this is definitely one of the lightest-tasting Imperial Stouts I've had to date."
"Pours a pitch black color with a tan head and good lacing. Smells of licorice, smoke, chocolate, toffee, and coffee. Tastes of chocolate malts, licorice, toffee, and caramel with hints of roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a little carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Overall a very nice beer."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"Overall- Not bad. A lighter bodied take on a typically overwhelming style. Booziness slightly evident with warming sensation, but strangely drinkable due to its lighter body. Almost feels like a brown malt porter. Tasty nonetheless and definitely worth a try!"
"D- This was a great tasting beer that I really enjoyed. The ABV is a little much and comes out at times. I would like to see how this one ages and will be looking for another bottle to do just that. Old Heathen is devilishly good for the style!"
"Very smooth and coffelike. Pours deep black with a short lived head. Aroma is roasted and slightly bitter, like a semisweet chocolate. The flavor is like a deeply roasted coffee, woody and slight flat, with a broad bitterness. Tannic and deep. The mouthfeel is creamy."
"D - Founders will always be my number one cheap imperial stout but I guess every evil genius needs a number two (pun intended) If I couldn't find any Founders you would find this in my fridge. PA props yall!"
"Not a session beer, but good."
"D - though the subdued flavors and the scrawny body are atypical for the style, its elegeance, nuance, and complexity, coupled with its barely-perceptable abv, make this beer extremely drinkable and a real treat -- certainly preferable to some of its aggressive and overbearing contemporaries."
"Have to say that this is a bit of a disappointment for a RIS. Not terrible by any means, just really average in several areas. I wouldn't have this again."
"D - I will get this very often."
"Notes: Definitely one of the more complex tasting stouts I've tried."
"D. It hides the 8% well. While it's not super complex right now, I've had some aged bottles that have really blown me away; I'll let the other six pack age for a bit."
"Pours an extremely dark brown/black with a fingers worth of tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells a touch smoky with a lot of coffee and some roasted malts. I taste slight coffee, not nearly as much as the nose, some brown sugar with a nice hop finish. Kinda surprised at how strong the finish is, really didn't expect it. It's not over powering but it compliments the sweetness in the middle. Body is kind of light but I don't mind, this is a really good beer. I can't wait until I go to Ohio again so I can get a sixer of this, good stuff!"
"i'm not a fan of the mouthfeel,for me it's too thin for the RIS name. there is carbination in here though."
"D - Pretty drinkable. A bit of a taste bud blaster. Might get it again if it weren't the case that Weyerbacher brews about 10 other imperial stouts."
"Taste isn't as powerful as the aroma would suggest. It is kind of watery, could really use some more sweetness or roasted flavor. Drinkable, but I've had many better RIS."
"Weyerbacher is usually a first rate company, and this product is no exception."
"D: This is a good beer I could drink when I was in the mood for a creamy/roasty beer."
"Empty glass afterthought = Super pleasing aftertaste. Oral and olfactory senses have definitely had a wonderful workout. Will be looking for this one again!"
"Overall a great offering. Very drinkable due to the awesome blend of flavors and complexity. The 8% ABV is hidden well."
"Drinkability: Very nice example of an old school English-style Russian Imperial Stout, as opposed to the ramped up versions most American craft brewers make."
"Very impressed by this one. I love Weyerbacher and I have a great respect for their ability to make great beers. This one just adds to what is already an impressive catologue of beers."
"The mouth is creamy and smooth, but goes down a little too easily. Thin aspects noted, but overall a good feel. Great bitter black coffee flavors that finish with a sweet coat of chocolate and cream. Wow! I was really impressed with this beer. I about glugged this down. Quite quaffable for the ABV and darkness. I think this rivals Old Rasputin for an accessible RIS. Nicely done."
"D: it is light smooth and drinkable, good deal, comes in six packs, 8%, but there are many RIS I would choose but is a solid beer. Hersey is a amazing treat if you liked this one give it a try,"
"Had my first couple of these this week. Dark color & lovely aroma. The head quickly disappated. A decent beer, but actually rather thin for a stout and no flavors that truly stood out. Could have just as easily been a Beck's dark if tasted blind. The 8% alcohol was not noticable on the palate. When really thirsty you can drink one quickly, but that's not what I want as the best thing I can say about a beer. Not a bad beer, but a bland beer."
"I can suck down quite a few pints of regular (non-imperial) stout and the same goes for this one despite the alcohol level of an imperial."
"Haven't had an imperial stout so gave a new one a try. Pours a get black color, tan head to it.... pretty appealing beer. Nice roasty aroma to this one. Taste is odd to me; for the style there is very little hops, a whole lot of malt, and a huge dose of hot alcohol flavor. I found it a bit thin for the style too, along with a funky sort of aftertaste. Man, I love this style but this one just doesn't cut it for me. I mean it isn't BAD, and it's drinkable.. but it's way too strong and doesn't have enough taste or mouthfeel for my liking."
"Pours a very dark brown with barely any head; what's there is tan. Light smoke and a lot of dark chocolate in the aroma, and maybe a hint of fruitiness. Slightly acidic coffee flavor with more dark chocolate. Pretty straightforward. Oily palate, medium-full body. Very drinkable."
"M/D: Light in the mouth with matching carbonation, and very easy drinking. I definately would like to have had another to see if I missed something the first time or if my judgements were a little harsh since I like the bigger beers. 3.5/4.0"
"D - Doesn't live up to my expectations of a Russian Imperial Stout in any category... Reserved and timid across the board... Seems more reminiscent of a Porter or even a Scotch Ale... I hate to knock a brew from the fine folks at Weyerbacher, but this one doesn't pass the test for me..."
"D: Old Heathen is a solid RIS and fixture in Weyerbacher's lineup. Very palatable. Very drinkable. I actually prefer it to the Kentucky Bourbon barrel aged ""Heresy. """
"D) A fairly delicious brew. I'd have another."
"I feel bad saying this because barrel aging is not always better but, in the case of Old Heathen vs. Heresy, barrel aging wins out."
"Overall, this is a very good RIS. I really enjoy the complexity and flavorfullness of it, as well as the fact that it is quite drinkable. Another great Weyerbacher offering."
"This is a very drinkable RIS coming from a great brewery, Im just surprised that this is only 8%, I was thinking it would be at least 10 plus. This is one that you can either sip on a take a bigger plunge, it's your choice, depending on your mood. This went great with and on some chocolate brownie ice cream, sweet jesus."
"D: Seems more like an imperial coffee stout than the traditional RIS, the one area where this beer really fails is the mouthfeel. Coarse, thin, carbonated, it just doesn't do the style justice. Still though, nice complexity with a booziness that isn't overdone. A pretty beer with a subtle, yet enticing nose. Slightly better than the run-of-the-mill imperial stout."
"pours a solid jet black color with very tanish almost brown head, and barely any lacing. too dark to see any sort of carbonation going on. smells of roasted nuts maybe with some dark chocolate going on too. same goes for the taste. very malty with subtle hoppy hints. wasn't nearly as heavy as i thought by the look of it."
"I like the taste of this one so much it's almost sessionable if I was in a true RIS mood."
"Pours midnight black, with a nice topper of light brown foam. I was really looking forward to this one after trying the Heresy. This one was a huge letdown. A nice nose, with roasted malt, molasses and dark chocolate was inviting, but from the first sip I was not impressed. The roasted malt was there, as well as an almost cloying sweetness. Alcohol was not evident. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I was not impressed."
"D - Ridiculously easy drinking for an imp. stout. So smooth and soft, it just slides down. Dangerous."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of roasted malts and alcohol, some chocolate. Taste is of roasted malts, a touch of coffee, and some hop bitterness.Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Notes: I really enjoy this beer. The complexity and subtleties of this beer really engage the drinker. I found myself dissecting every sip. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
"D- real nice I love a beer with lots of flavor that won't wreck you palate"
"SkÅL!"
"D - It has some good elements like the sourness and hops, but the molasses it a bit overpowering, nice to try though."
"D - Overall, an excellent version of the style."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a small quarter inch tan head. Head retention is low, lacing is decent. The brew smells like molasses, coffee, dark fruit (raisins, plums), chocolate, and surprisingly even a bit of banana. The aroma is very sweet and malty. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the brew also has a bit of a licorice and smoky taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has decent carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. The 8% ABV isn't very noticable at all. I think this is a good overall brew, it's definitely worth a try."
"Aroma is rich and smoky with an overtone of quality coffee and hints of chocolate and molasses. It pours a dark sepia with a decent, if not too persistent, tan head. Flavor is like a good mocha, mainly good coffee and sweet chocolate with a hint of brown sugar. Texture is tingly and lively with a fairly firm alcohol bite. Definitely recommended."
"D-this is a very good brew, checks on everything you want to see and fair in size. I love a good RIS and this fits in suit."
"D: Smooth and approachable, not at all overwhelming."
"Notes: Weyerbacher is one of my personal favorite breweries (I gave their Merry Monks a 4.9!) but this is not a good example of beers from this great brewery, unless you like that anise taste like my brother Paul."
"D: Very high - amazing beer as expected from Weyerbacher."
"Overall, a decent RIS for the price, but nothing to crazy good. I would drink it again, but nothing I would seek out. Decent drinkability."
"J"
"Not one of my favorite RIS, only so-so. With all the competition in the style, this would have to be in the bargain bin to sample again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, a very nice RIS, better gulped than sipped."
"THis beer gets a few extra points for being somewhat unique. Been drinking a lot of RIS lately, this one is easy to pick out. I seem to keep coming back to it. Pretty standard looking pour, real dark, not among the blackest as there is a brownish tint. Delicious looking milk chocolate/off white head disappears quickly, lacing remains. The nose on this is potent, the alcohol comes through but is blended with a cocoa/fruity/malty/spicy sweetness. Taste follows the nose. I understand this is a combo of 7 different malts and it produces a identifiable unique taste. I like this a lot, and would consider it a RIS Light. IT is somewhat sessionable if that term can be applied to this style. I will surely grab more of these."
"Mouthfeel has mild carbonation on the tongue, but overall, pretty smooth. Medium body and the alcohol is pretty well hidden. This isn't exactly robust which is what I've come to expect from Imperial Stouts, that being said, this falls a little short of that. However, it's still well brewed and an enjoyable sipper in a tulip glass while sitting at the computer, very drinkable."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"Overall - I can't imagine that this beer gains so much from being put in to a bourbon barrel and will have to revisit it down the road but it doesn't have any kind of depth or complexity. I'm sadly disappointed."
"D: This beer wasn't bad, but it lacked the big body and flavors I've come to expect from RIS's."
"Smell:"
"Pours black with a darker brown head with a short stay. Minor spotted lacing left around the glass. Sweet chocolate scent with a touch of coffee. Nothing outstanding really. Taste is decent but light in comparison to the really good imperial stouts. I like something you may possibly have to chew. This one is fairly mellow and light across the tongue. Medium carbonation. Maybe a hint of hoppiness? Drinkability is good as it's easy drinking and moderate ABV. Either way, easy to drink but not one of the best I've had. Definitely a good beer but I'm into much heavier stouts than this. For sure this beer is worth a try and I don't get it here so I'm not sure what they run but I would have to say, if it's moderately priced it's worth drinking regularly. Most beers from this brewery, as I've experienced, have been mediocre except for a couple. I would say though this beer is one of the better."
"drinkability: decent. Not the best RIS, but good"
"D - Awesome. I don't think all ""big"" have to be challenging. On the contrary, this beer is quite accessible for seasoned enthusiasts as well as those who may not consider an Imperial their go to beer of choice."
"Pour is black as night with a very thin tan head that vanished pretty quickly. Espreso, dark fruit (mainly plum), and chocolate. Espreso/strong coffee on the front end. Then comes the slight bitter chocolate taste mixed with a hint of prunes. You can even taste the hops in this one...great bitter finish is both clean and slightly dry. This is my favorite RIS I've had to date. It doesn't have that strong alcohol finish that I've noticed in others. There's alot of flavors and without the overpowering taste of alcohol you can really taste them Just a well balanced and fantastic tasting stout."
"D: Yes, this could be a reasonable session beer, or a beer to simply enjoy during the cold winter months."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Dark, black in color, almost opaque with thin tan head. Slight retention with a bit of lacing. Chocolate and dark fruit notes. Tastes sweet upfront, hints of molasses, coffee and dark chocolate. A little alcohol bite in the finish. Full bodied with lighter carbonation."
"D: this is a good introduction imperial stout. It has the body and appearance of some of the boldest imperial stouts, but the flavor is a bit subdued for the style. Lots of nice sweet notes followed by roasted notes. Pretty well balanced. 8.0% abv is non existent."
"There is still a nice big body, luxurious in its creaminess. Mild carbonation is right on the spot here, makes for the easiest drinking imperial stout I have ever had. Definitely worth checking out."
"D: Too much roasted malt for my liking, and lacking in body. Other than that--a nice offering from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with one finger khaki head, spotty lacing. Smell: toffee, brown sugar, background earthy hop, a little buttery. Taste: toffee, a little coffee, lightly roasted, buttery, background hop spiciness. Kind of an English interpretation with a touch of coffee. Mildly creamy, nicely carbonated. The alcohol doesn't make an appearance. Almost sessionable but not particularly complex or exciting."
"Overall, real nice and quite surprising. In a style that is typically way too big and aggressive for most people this one seems like it could be approachable by anyone. Nicely done."
"Not a typical Weyerbacher beer. It pours very thick, very black, almostt like a heavy motor oil. Definitely has the body of an Imperiqal Stout but is more creamy in the taste than most Imperial Stouts. Texture on the tongue is smooth with almost an aftertaste of roasted oatmeal. Drinks just as smooth and belies it's big beer charcteristics. Complex maltiness adds to the experience as it goes down. A wonderful beer for a cold winter night in front of a fire."
"This was not the Russian Imperial that I was expecting but it was very tasty! Definitely worth checking out."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and nice, but it doesn't add anything to the beer. I think the beer is drinkable, only because it doesn't have a lot of flavours. Not sure if this is just a badly handled bottle or a bit too old (I'd doubt this possibility the mose), but it's just very plain."
"CHEERS!!"
"Oats in the taste and in the mouth, which really round out the taste and, combined with the thin carbonation, really round out the finish, and curb the bitterness and alcohol."
"Overall, kinda disappointed with this one. Not a whole lot going on. I will definitely have this again, as it's not terrible and still a good brew, but compared to other Imperial Stouts I've had this just doesn't stand up to them."
"D: Definitely on the lighter side for a RIS. Tasty but there are others I'd turn to."
"Thanks Paul!"
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, alcohol (which seems odd in that this beer is only 8% ABV), and roasted malt. It is a rather fragrant aroma, but it lacks true complexity. The taste is like the aroma, but not as pronounced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This beer seems too thin for a beer of its strength. Overall, this is a decent beer. However, I can't see myself drinking it again with so many great stouts out there."
"Drinkablilty is very good. Its not as high in abv as others from this style, so I could see having a few at a time. Not to mention this is my favorite style of beer."
"drinkability - very smooth imp stout."
"A respectable, well executed RIS, though without the complexity or intensity of some of the superior examples."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer. I would argue that it's more of an American Double Stout than an RIS but what's semantics? Either way, it's worth a shot."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability/Notes: A really great imperial stout. Very complex and definitely unique flavor profile. I think that being 8% abv vs. the 9,10% that many IMPY stouts are nowadays in America makes this RIS very drinkable. Its equally as huge in character and depth, but it would seem that they left a bit more extra sugars unfermented to give it a smooth and maybe sweeter quality."
"Delicious beer with a great balance between bitter and sweet notes."
"Lighter drinking than I thought, but overall decent. Smooth & creamy."
"MF/D: Pretty damn viscous, full in body, slight sour fruity lingering finish"
"This is a damn nice beer. I wouldn't call it a top imperial stout, but it's definitely better than my overall score will reflect. Can't wait to open my bottle of Heresy next."
"D - something i would love to drink on a regular basis...this was my random find for the week and consider myself lucky to have found it"
"Good but in a well made homebrew sort of way. Not a letdown because it's so different. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is super high for any style, which is particularly impressive for a high gravity brew such as this. Overall, I am very impressed."
"d-not bad. Not great. I've had better."
"I was interested to see how this compared to the Heresy, pretty similar except for the oak flavors in that one and this one seems a little less heavy. Both very good!"
"Bottle courtesy of HogtownHarry. Deep black pour, unleashes a creamy mocha head. Not a lot of lacing here, but the head was long lived. Nose is quite roasty/toasty, with coffee beans,black licorice, some vanilla, dark fruit. Tastes of roasted coffee beans, some dark chocolate,black licorice, some smokey fruity notes, leading to pit fruits and hops towards the end. Nice creamy palate, bitter and dark chocolate sweetness balances. A pleasure. Thanks a lot for this one Harry!"
"I am a fan"
"D- Almost too easy and very enjoyable. I could easily sit around and put down a whole bunch of these"
"The taste is very full bodied, thick, and creamy. All the usual suspects are in this Imperial Stout, some roasted cherry chocolate notes, some boozy sweetish malts, some charred roasted grain. There is some hop bite towards the finish, and there is definitely some booziness and a slight throaty coarseness from the alcohol. There is a touch of nutty flavors popping through, but the booziness towards the finish takes over. The mouthfeel is a tad oily with some residual charred cherry flavors too. This is a nice beer for the style."
"D - Though nothing has jumped out at me about this beer, Old Heathen has been an enjoyable RIS. My biggest shock is how dramtically the taste improved as it warmed just a few degrees. Quite complex and devoid of overly roasted and burnt flavors that (to me) limit the accessibility of others in the style. Not something I would personally want to throw back all night long, but definitely one of the more enjoyable examples of the style I've had in a while."
"D: This brew is a big beer but still very drinkable. Some brews go out of their way to blow you out of the water, this does not. This is a really well done Imperial Stout."
"BTW, Tap & Mallet in Rochester, NY (where I tried this gem)is a great place for good beer, and the food is top notch too."
"D - Not thick and chewey, but still a good RIS."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquors in Wauwautosa, WI. Pours an oily pitch black with a khaki tan head. Aroma of bourbon, oak, cream and vanilla. Full bodied and creamy with low to medium carbonation, this beer's flavors followed exactly from the aroma adding a roasted chocolate flavor to the cream, vanilla and bourbon flavors. Very drinkable, not heavy due to that subtle flavors of the bourbon. I need to get some more of this."
"D - This is a very good RIS that is fairly easy drinking with an ABV that isn't over-the-top like many other imperial stouts."
"Pours black with a dark tan head that is rich with microbubbles and attractive lacing. Aroma of caramel malts, bubble gum, and a slight hops spiciness. Taste displays a smooth balance between roasted malts and a bubblegum sweetness. Dark malt finish with some residual dark fruit. Medium-full body and medium carbonation. Quite a good Imperial Stout in my opinion, nice combination of roast and sweet."
"When people tell me Guinness is the best beer, of course I know they are ignorant to how many types of beers there are, I recommend them to Old Heathen. I am aware that they are very different, but, Old Heathen is a great beer, and i am positive others will like it more than I do."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is a little flat with some creaminess. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is medium. This RIS, isnt chewy and full body up in your face like a great RIS. It does hold the characters of a good RIS, so, it isnt too bad. I enjoyed drinking it."
"12oz bottle. Pours an extremely dark brown with a medium light brown head. Smells of light cocoa and darkly roasted malt. No blatant coffee aromas, surprisingly. The taste is dark, slightly bitter roasted malt with some milk chocolate. Mostly sweet. The body is on the lighter side for an imperial stout. A mediocre RIS, really."
"Salud!"
"The drink is lush, full-bodied, and super-smooth. Rich and satisfying, Old Heathen is a fine, fine sipper."
"I had one of these last night with a bowl of ice cream. The best way to describe the pour on this beer is 'exciting"" as the thick (but not overwhelmingly) head forms out of the beautiful dark brown of this stout. Pick it up and you'll get an even more exciting whiff of it. The taste is above average but not uncommon compared to other imperial stouts. There is however, a definite hint of what the server at the Weyerbacher Brewery described to me as ""Belgian-influenced"" which I can see, but it wasn't the first thing that came to my mind. This ""Belgian-influence"" added to the smooth mouthfeel of this beer."
"Poured into large snifter. Small tan head, Very black body. This beer does not seem to have very good head retention. Aroma smells of alcohol and chocolate. The taste has a nice roasty complexity with a hint of what seems to be British Chocolate. Very smooth and warm mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty decent since this RIS is only arond 8.0. Overall I thought this was a very good beer, decent compared to other Russian Imperial Stouts."
"All and all I was a little disappointed from what I've been hearing about this beer just a good beer nothing spectacular."
"This is the most sessionable Imperial Stout I've tasted."
"Pours a midnight black, oil-like body with a creamy, sticky head. Strong malt smell of roasted/coffee and sweet malts like chocolate, caramel and some dark fruits. Medium-to-full-bodied and very smooth. Lots of malts in this beer such as roasted, coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee and some other tart sweet flavors, like cherries or something. Hops balance it out on backend with some herbal dryness. Passes easily and is a very enjoyable beer."
"Pleasing one to two finger head which has lots of big bubbles at first which then sink down into sheet of foam, dark brown in color, the lacing slides easily down the glass. Like its immediate peer group, black as the ace of spades. Anise seed, bittersweet dark chocolate and rum cake, sweet baking spices and creamed coffee make up the bulk of the nose, white raisin, fig, pear, peach fruit, interestingly non-dark in character, flows through your nostrils at a good pace. Medium-bodied, the carbonation awkward in how it handles its enthusiasm, hurts overall balance. The coffee, caramel, chocolate as well as raisin, fig, date, apricot, banana fruit keeps it sweet but by no stretch sugary. In fact, it's much drier than expected. The black licorice, flowers and orange peel lend nuance, still, nothing overtly hop-inspired going on. The roast factor is low. Grinds to a halt semi-prematurely. Needs to offer more pleasure or, conversely, more intellectual engagement."
"D - This is a bit light for the style and unusually smooth. Neither hop character nor roasted malt is overly powerful and while, when combined with the smooth alcohol, this makes for easy drinkability, it also limits complexity. In some ways, this is almost more like an Imperial Porter. A good beer overall, nothing to complain about, but nothing special and not as interesting as I would hope for something in this price range to be."
"D: This goes down very easy, a great dessert beer, there is no sign of alcohol, I expect a little bit of ""warming"" in a RIS. This makes me think of an imperial sweet/milk stout, a bigger (and roastier) version of Young's double chocolate stout. Very yummy, very recommended. I wish I could get this in KY."
"Drinks easy for an imperial stout but at 8%, it may be one of the lowest RIS I've sampled. A modest balance of what I'm guessing may be coffee and chocolate malt."
"Well done lighter Imperial Stout"
"D: Pretty drinkable for a 8% ABV... I could a couple a night."
"Review from a glass a couple of nights ago. Standard RIS appearance, decent tan head, decent lacing left. Aroma was sweet, malty and a bit coffee-ee. Taste was overwhelmingly sweet. There wasn't much in the way of the big roastiness I love so much, which was a bit dissappointing. It sort of lacks roast and focuses on sweet in the same way Rasputin lacks sweet and focuses on roast. Not a bad beer by any means, just lacking a bit. Mouthfeel was still plenty chewy, full bodied, and low on carbonation. Drinkability was very high, although it's not really the most alcoholic RIS to begin with. OK, decent to try, but nothing to get excited over."
"I enjoyed pouring this beer into my glass, as I have taken a liking to darker, heavier bodied beers lately. It is black, with a brown tinged head. The taste had strong coffee and chocolate notes, with a subtle dryness that led to a sweet and sour aftertaste (could just be my pallet today). I found it drinkable, with the alcohol somewhat inconspicuous. I look forward to finishing my six-pack."
"On the real ale tap at Rustico. Pours dark dark black with maybe some ruby lasting. Taste is like fine dark chocolate, sweet without being sickly so, and some bitterness in the finish. Strong enough to let you know it, but still relatively easy to finish."
"Drinkability: A very nice Imperial Stout that is as complex in flavor as you could ask for. As seems to be the case with most Imperial Stouts this one should be only lightly chilled or the flavors may be too harsh for some. However, at 8% ABV it's the a one a night beer to sip slowly and savor. I'm looking forward to the bottle of the bourbon barrel aged version (Heresy) that I'll be opening and reviewing in the next few days."
"Drinkability: I do not see this as being overly complex for a RIS. It is very one or two dimensional. I think there are better offerings for the style and will not get this again."
"12 oz. Very dark brown pour with a minimalistic brown head. Retained a ring throughout and stuck to the sides of the glass just slightly. Nice roasty aromas, malt, coffee and light chocolate, just a hint of hops. Creamier mouthfeel than I was expecting, pretty nice. Taste is quite similar to the aromas. There is some dark plum or other red fruit in their also. I like these imperials that are below 10%, less boozy and very drinkable. It doesn't have the complexity that the big boys have, but is excellent in it's own right. Especially since I think Weyerbacher produces quite a few overly boozy brews."
"This beer pours a very dark brown almost black color. The smell is malty, you can't smell all of the complexity of the taste of the beer though. The taste of the beer is like a stout, it is malty and smokey. There is also a taste of licorice in there as well. There is very little carbonation for mouthfeel. This is a very good beer, but it would be difficult to drink a large amount of them. It does go down smooth, but a little heavy."
"This pours a perfect opaque black color with a very decent crackling brown head and very nice lacing. The aroma is an inviting chocolate charcoal and licorice. The flavor jumps out with all the same qualities plus a sweet malt background. It's got some hop bitterness at the edges, but overall this is smooth, in a very medium bodied lucious feeling stout. Surprisingly drinkable due to subtlety of the alcohol presence and great mouthfeel and great flavor. This is what a stout should be. Bravo!"
"I like this stout. It has a lot of nice flavors going on and is easy to drink. Pretty good balance and a nice complexity."
"The color is black with a thick foamy head the color of coffee. Lacing is light. The smell is complex, with heavy roasted malt contributing coffee chocolate and some note of fruits. The taste is even more complex. I don't know if something's changed or something was odd about my bottle, but to me a black licorice was absolutely the strongest and even was the flavor left on the sides of the tongue in a strong finish. Strong malts including the coffee and bitter dark chocolates in the smell as well as a mix of toasted grains and various fruits. As for the mouthfeel, pay no heed to anyone who claims this could be thicker. I have never imagined anything could be this thick and anyone who says otherwise may have misread the label or been in some sort of haze. This left itself in syrupy sheets in the glass and I could see the thickness on the glass. This is the fullest-bodied brew I've ever had. It's also one of those special brews that has a high ABV you don't get kicked with but you feel in that very pleasant way. Bottom line: B+ my ass."
"Old Heathen Imperial Stout pours an opaque black with a thin tan head that doesn't last very long, from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a touch of roast in the aroma. The body could be a bit thicker, but is adequate. There is some roasty malt in the flavor, it's also a bit estery, alcohol is also a bit noticeable. Pretty good, definitely worth a try."
"Very soft and cushiony mouthfeel with low carbonation. This beer needs some rehabilitating to make it anything special."
"Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a bitch black ale with a mocha colored head that leaves very nice lacing. The aroma is mostly of coffee. It is medium-full bodied and smooth with a light, dry finish. It is well balanced and quite simple. The flavor, like the aroma, is mostly of coffee. There is a touch of sweetness at the finish, like licorice. This is a very drinkable Imperial Stout, sort of along the lines of Victory Storm King."
"Drinkability- Excellent for the style, in my opinion. Rich and not so powerful as to be unenjoyable after a couple."
"The body is moderate. This is where the beer really falls off. Really would like more depth. There isn't much for carbonation but ok for style. Overall a bit disappointed in this one. I would have liked more complexity overall and some minor brewing notes kind of offset."
"The mouthfeel was extremely smooth. The texture was like milk, but it went down like Kool-Aid on a hot day! Beautiful stuff."
"Just had this on cask at Rustico's Glassware Giveaway. It looked amazing, nice opaque black with a surprising amount of dark tan head (in a tulip glass). It smelled like dark chocolate and bananas with some bready yeast and a bit of roasted coffee. It tasted similar, with a great but dry bittersweet malt character. The banana and yeast surprised me, although it wasn't as noticeable in the flavor. Fairly thick and very smooth, with no noticeable alcohol either. This was all too easy to drink, and so very enjoyable. None of the flavors were quite as big as I was expecting, but they were nicely melded together."
"A dark lake, pinky-size beige head retreats to a whisp of smoke on the water. A light ring of lacing encircles the black ice. Light scent of cocoa, vanilla and white sugar. Sips like a chocolate seltzer that stays friendly and hides a lil tang. Another chocolate cream soda mocha egg drop; at a sessionable RIS pace. Carbonation is rather crisp and the finish is delicate, with a palatable bitter touch at the end. The heathen is tame and inviting; but a gargoyle, sorcerer, or founder leave this one on second string."
"Black potion with light coffee colored head. A dessert-like aroma of chocolate cream. Tastes of smooth chocolate, cream, butterscotch, and slight raisin. Its not as thick as it looks, mouthfeel is quite slick and medium-bodied. The alcohol is hidden very well behind flavor and can sneak up on ya."
"An absolutely terrific Stout which I highy recommend."
"Darkest brown, almost opaque, one finger creamed coffee head, light lacing. Aroma is of fruity esters, alcohol, light chocolate and a little bit of roastiness. Strong alcohol smell comes out as it warms. Too much sweet fruit in the nose for my liking. I like more roasty malts in my stouts. Flavor is more of the grapey fruitiness. Has an almost red wine-like quality. Some roastiness is present but it's buried deep. Also some light chocolate flavors, but not much going on here. Alcohol is very present and not well hidden for 8%. I don't know if this is an older bottle, but at this ABV it should have held up well. Not very impressed by this beer."
"This beer has an interesting collection of flavors in one. Not quite my favorite but worth buying again."
"I poured it pretty cold. Thankfully it took me about an hour to finish. It's an entirely different beer warmed up. A good brew. One of the few RISs that I could crack a couple of in one night."
"Silky black appearance, slightly oily looking. Thin lacing on the side with no head. Aromas were utterly fantastic. An incredible array of coffee, cocoa, vanilla, alcohol, malt, dark fruit. The taste has a carbonated, milky/creamy flavor. Lacks the specific range of flavors sensed from smell, but does have a dark chocolate, malt taste. Light and way creamy. Makes it a little heavy and, at least for my bottle, made it quite chilled from refrigeration. Overall, great."
"D: A runner up. It is not the first imperial I would tell someone to try, but it certainly is worth getting a pack."
"Drinkability - Very nice and easy for a stout, but wouldn't want too many at once. (If I'm driving)"
"d: I've been drinking some over-the-top huge stouts lately, so this was a nice change of pace. It just doesn't quite measure up to strong stouts of similar size in the area, like Sorm King or Fat Dog."
"I am not a big fan of Russian Imperial Stouts but this one is tremendous. I like the creaminess to it and the more dominant taste of espresso. This is a dangerous brew as you can not taste the alcohol one bit."
"Great stout for drinkability. Not too thick or heavy, very tasty."
"Very easy drinker at 8%. Recommended."
"Notes: A huge RIS by a brewery that banks on it's mastery of big brews. Very nice and enjoyable."
"Pours black as night with a bit over a finger of brown head that exhibits fairly good retention. Aroma is rich and complex with lots of roasted grains, some malty sweetness, dark fruit esters, and a subtle alcohol presence. Taste is pretty good. Initially the flavors seem much more subdued than the aromas. Upfront there is a strong malty sweetness which segues into some indistinct dark fruit esters. Towards the finish there is a bit of alcohol presence that is soon overshadowed by a lingering roastyness. Bitterness is moderate at best but this beer (overall) doesn't seem overly sweet, its actually fairly well balanced. Overall this brew has mellowed a bit with some more vinous characters emerging due to its age. Mouthfeel is pretty good, only medium bodied (again due to aging), low-moderately carbonated, with some alcohol warming. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd say that this brew ages pretty darn well."
"This was nice. Those who like a big hop element in their RISs may find it lacking, but I liked it."
"Overall, I am very impressed with this RIS. I enjoyed the heck out of the Heresy, so I'm not astonished that I love this as well. A definite try for any stout lover."
"Pours a very dark with an astonishingly brown head that is fizzy at first but quickly settles. Smells of chocolate a roastiness; aromoas are a bit faint. Taste has me shaking my head ""yes"" over and over: jackpot! There's so much happening on the palate that I hardly know where to start. Initial impression of tingly carbonation on the front of the tongue, then a very big whallop of dark chocolate mousse and sweetened coffee take over. Finish is extremely long and satisfying, going from a cocoa sweetness to a dark chocolate, roasty bitterness. Body is medium-full, could be fuller, but this beer is definitely a winning bet."
"A pretty nice sipper. Good balance and flavors. I'd track this down again. Thanks to Yamar18 for the bottle."
"Interesting, but not necessarily in a good way. Poured as dark as a beer can be, with very little head and not much lacing, smell is faint. Malt, and a bit smoky, not up my alley, tasted a bit smokey as well, maybe coffee in there too. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Worth a try to see if it is for you, but I would not drop the money on anything more than a single bottle to try it."
"Black as night. head froths up big and thick then settles down into an oily skin on top with minimal lacing. The nose is chocolately with a hint of coffee. slight woody aroma. Taste is cocoa with a pleasant bitterness at the end. real espresso taste throughout as well. somewhat sweet in the finish, then dries out slightly. mouthfeel is viscous and chewy, but still wish it had a bit more creaminess to it. overall, a nice example of an ris."
"3.5 D: Not bad if your in the mood for an RIS, but this isn't the one I'd choose."
"D- Drinkability is above average. The smoothness combined with the perfect carbonation and excellent flavors make this a brew I could easily drink 3 or 4 of in a night."
"This one wasn't that great, but I wasn't expecting that much so I'm not let down. It's a solid B class Imperial Stout. I say give it a shot."
"Drinkability: Not bad. A sipper, as this one doesn't hide the alcohol has good as many other imperial stouts. I enjoyed this, but I can't say that I'd buy this over any other imperial stout that's out there."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, a couple of beers and I would move to something heavier."
"This is another Weyerbacher beer that I find extremely underwhelming. This is just a very strange imperial stout. Has an overall cola sort of quality to it, and the banana qualities are also odd. It's also very thin and needs much more in the way of body. Just lacks robustness overall, and frankly isn't all that good. I'm not a fan, and I won't be coming back for more."
"Overall a well balanced product."
"Overall-really nice stout, again from above it's balanced, flavorful, and complex. I really enjoyed it."
"Pours deep black with a beautiful1/2 inch caramel colored head. Smells of dark fruits, coffee, and chocolate complete the nose. First sip is a blend of coffee and chocolate and neither is overpowering. A strong malt backbone compliments and makes the Imperial Stout very creamy. Tastes stronger than ths 8% ABV would indicate."
"Overall, a nice quality beer to relax on a cold day."
"D: Had enough complexity and dark fruitiness as well alcohol to keep things interesting throughout the entire drink, which became more smooth and easy as you progressed."
"Solid RIS. Not quite Black Bear or Ten Fidy, but close."
"The alcohol is very hidden so it seems drinkable but then you start to feel numb after half a bottle so it turns out, it's not. I could just have one of these (which is not a bad thing)."
" I can't even taste the alcohol in this and I'm almost shocked this this is listed as 8.00% ABV. While this isn't the best stout I've had, there's no way ya could go wrong drinking this. It would go well with food since there's nothing here to overpower a meal and the alochol doesn't linger on breath like it does with so many other heavy beers. This might be enough to have my crave some Ghiradelli on the side..."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, though it is as heavy as you might expect."
"Overall: good one shot beer"
"This is well crafted and worth trying. This winter will be cold. This one is your friend."
"Drinkability: A solid and drinkable if not outstanding beer, with a reasonable abv% for the style that's well hidden and a nice assortment of interesting flavors. Not too very different from the bottled version - it's enjoyable in either serving format, but I wouldn't seen it out in either, as well."
"Pours an extremely dark color with brown and ruby hues glinting through the edges. The aroma is nice. It is of coffee and very much of dark chocolate. The taste is the best aspect of this beer, as it should be. The roasted coffee and chocolate flavors really come out and it is great. Great beer."
"D, and overall impression: At 8% this is very drinkable. As the beer warms it goes down very easy. I thought this was a very good Imperial Stout, definately worth the try, and one I will be having again. Skal."
"Bottle thanks to Daniel, thanks man. Pours a dark, almost black color with an initially large head that quickly goes down to a small light brown head. The aroma is nice; lots of coffee and vanilla, some dark fruits also. A nice flavor of dark fruits, some light coffee and chocolates, some milkiness, toffee and perhaps a hint of banana. The mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. A nice brew for sure. Very drinkable and no notice of alcohol, almost no warmth even."
"Pours a jet black color, not even a hint of light making it through the glass. A surprisingly thin, coffee colored head on top. The smell practically made me drool. The chocolate, coffee combination is strong, and exceptional. The smell delivers even more, when tasting. That chocolate, coffee smell translates strongly into the taste of the beer. Slightly bitter, but still very smooth stout. A pleasure to drink. I had it on of the first cool afternoons, and it warmed me nicely. Top notch."
"smooth medium bodied. full flavored. an easy drink. im really glad i got a chance to crack this open and enjoy. excited to age a bottle"
"A good PA beer to enjoy before game 5 of the Series!"
"This is a very good chocolatey imperial stout. Give it a try. There is a nice complexity without a whole lot of roasted flavor."
"Definitely a delicious beer. The 8% ABV doesn't come through that much in the taste. Fine work."
"This brew has a chocolate and cinnamon smell, fresh chocolate chip cookies come to mind. Poured into a pint it is thick and dark black with a little bit of tan head. Taste is roasted malts and lots of it. In the glass I can smell the alcohol but it really isn't evident in the taste until the very end where is seems to go up through the nose and evaporate from the tongue. This is one potent brew. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but very slick. The carbonation is low and is only detected for a short time in the middle of the taste. The finish is dry but still has lingering sweetness and alcohol. It goes down extremely smoothly, like silk. Gotta watch the AC though this one will sneak up fast."
"I've had this fine stout on several occasions, never having reviewed it and after purchasing a Weyerbacher ""Big Beers"" variety pack; I figured it was a good time to throw in my two cents. I poured it right into my tasting snifter and prepared to enjoy. There was a thick mocha head that quickly dissipated the color was absolutely jet black, with no light what so ever penetrating it from the other side of the glass. The aroma was strong, with lots of dark roasted malts, and dark, bittersweet chocolates. The flavor was not as strong as I thought it would be. Its very mellow and sooth drinking. The high alcohol content is very well hidden. You can definitely taste the malts, with a sweet after taste. This is a good brew, one to definitely try out in the future."
"Overall, this is an RIS with very good drinkability. Nothing really spectacular but nothing terrible either."
"Another Weyerbacher beer. Another underachiever. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing offensive or off, but the aroma is very muted and the flavor scores low on complexity. What's there is pleasant enough - big dark roasted barley with java and dark bittersweet chocolate. The aroma has a metallic note and a hint of milk chocolate. The body is reasonably thick and fairly drinkable. Not bad overall, but there are many better RIS's available."
"Overall this is pretty good. I was expecting something a bit more extreme. This is a good RIS to introduce people to the style."
"D - High drinkablility. Not bitter or head on alcohol taste."
"This beer wasn't bad, it just doesn't compare to many others of the style. Still, I'd have it again and weakly recommend it. I bought a 6-pack at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"Drinkability: Smooth and sweet...a little TOO sweet at times."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with little carbonation, but the oily texture of the beer is a little unpleasant."
"D: I don't think I would ever want to or could ever drink more than one or two imperial stouts, but this was only 8% ABV."
"Full mouthfeel and a nice way of drinking considering the alcohol."
"D - very nice. This is one of the first imperial stouts I've had in a while (I know I should drink them throughout the year, but man I enjoy my lagers and other styles during the summer) and I'm really enjoying it. The ABV seems to be pretty well hidden, and I could probably drink a couple of these. Would totally buy again (and will as it gets colder) or drink on tap. Definitely worth a shot"
"D: The alcohol was hidden well. Goes down much easier than Rasputin. Just a fun time with a great beer. I still really enjoy Rasputin but this beer takes less effort."
"Overall, not a bad stout, but not excellent. It has all the normal flavors, but could use some complexity and bitterness."
"Drinkability - A great rusian imperal stout, tasty, smooth and balanced."
"mouthfeel is a bit thin also, i gotta say i was a bit disapointed in this one, its good, but not really imperial in my opinion."
"An easy drinking RIS."
"D: This is a great Imperial Stout. Good for dessert!"
"The appearance is deep brown to black. Nice soapy sloppy head. The taste and aroma I would describe as ""breakfasty"" (i.e. profound cocoa and roasted coffee). And the mouthfeel was rounder and light and sort of milky (not very ""hot"" or very inky [for an imperial])."
"D. I am glad I have 2 more of these!"
"Drink is somewhat less, not as complex as I would like. RIS are not exactly easy drinking beers but this is one that I would have one but move on. Recommended but not a staple."
"Drinkability is nice. Very smooth beer and it doesn't have an overbearing strong taste that usually makes it hard to drink a lot of an imperial stout. Not one of the best offerings for its brand, but I could definitely drink a six-pack of these."
"Drinkability - If I had to pick a style, RIS would be my favorate. This offering is above the mean, but not a top RIS. Worth having a few around if you want to compare to others within its class. I have a few aging to see if any change is noticed over time."
"Poured from a bottle into a Stella Artois chalice. Pours a deep brown with not much of a head. Smells like roasted coffee and a little bit of chocolate undertones. Taste is primarily coffee and roasted malts. Not incredibly complex. Moderate carbonation makes this relatively drinkable. Not the best RIS, but a good one nonetheless."
"It's clearly not the most roasted of flavorful RIS out on the market, but it is a decent one. It's one of the few can miss RIS. It's one of those beers you get when you want to start out on that particular style of beer."
"D : Another excellent one from Weyerbacher. I'd take more of it."
"Overall, a pretty good example of the RIS style and one that I enjoy and will have again."
"Overall, not a bad RIS. It's a bit on the plain side and not very complex. Probably a good starter as an intro to the RIS style."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a tan colored head that sticks around for quite a while and leaves some lacing around the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malts, chocolate and cherries. The taste like the aroma is big on the dark roasted malts with some cherries and a very mild hop bitterness. I am really enjoying Old Heathen, it is very tasty and highly drinkable for an RIS. Overall, Old Heathen is a very nice Imperial Stout that is recommended."
"RIS is my favorite style. This is a good one but I'll not drink it too often. I immediately can smell the alcohol on this one almost like Kaluah. Pours typical of the style, black with a strong head that leaves nice lacing. Taste is mostly Spanish Coffee--deep and slightly burnt but not bad. I don't get much chocolate on this one. Anyone not familiar with Spanish coffee go out and buy a block of El Pico and brew a pot. This brew, though similar ABV hits differently than others. I get more carbonation and a slightly tangy bite on the back of my throat with this one. Still very good."
"This is a very fine beer, though it's a bit sweeter than expected."
"Pours black with some auburn highlights at the bottom. Thick tan head. Aroma consists of dark chocolate, roasted malt, roasted coffee, and some vinous notes. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky smooth. Roasted dark malt with a dark vinous fruit flavor upfront. Dry middle. Mildly hopped, but the malt flavor dominates. Some coffee toward the back with some hints of cherry. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Very smooth and dangerously drinkable."
"As a finishing note, this is a good RIS but it seems not nearly as complex as many other examples. While it seems a contradiction in terms (simple RIS) the flavors seem pretty straight forward, which allows some of the beers flaws to come through."
"D: for an imperial stout this is phenomenal. I love the cherry tones, but the 8% abv is hidden so well. well-balanced and subtle all at once, with the extreme part of an imperial stout. give this one a try."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty little brew. Nothing fancy or over-the-top just a nice solid chocolaty stout. Very approachable and easy drinking, I definitely enjoyed this one. Big thanks to DrSeamus!"
"Overall: It's a nice sessionable stout."
"D: A decent finish to the night, and alcohol is quite well hidden - as mentioned, to the point of not really feeling warm on the finish. Worth picking up, though."
"I'm impressed with Weyerbacher & very happy to have four more untasted varieties downstairs. This doesn't quite reach the 'need to have those in the fridge' quality of the Double Sim, but it's a very good beer."
"Drinks well too, this beer has reminded me Impy Stouts don't need 10+% ABV to be masterpieces. There is no burn at all on the swallow and I was left wanting more. The perfect beer to sip while reading a book in a cold mansion next to a cozy fire. The best Imperial Stout I've had so far."
"a sweet flavor with heavy chocolate tones. lighter flavors of fruit and cinnamon. a little thick, but smooth and very drinkable for the style."
"D- It wasn't bad, didn't go down as smooth as most RIS do, but it was still easy to drink."
"This is a really nice stout and something I could drink on a very regular basis."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - brewed with seven malts and two hops. Fairly black body, topped with a half-inch chocolate head that reduces to a collar and a small island of foam. There's some detectable heat in the nose, along with milk chocolate, raisins, mild coffee and some roasted malts. Quite similar flavor profile, with the addition of dark fruits, a dash of lightly-bitter hops, and perhaps some yeast. The body is medium and very dry, with low carbonation and powdery yeast; it's silky and becomes quite smooth, but it isn't as big as it needs to be in my mind. Tastes more like a bigger-than-average American stout than an imperial, but it's worth a try if you come across it."
"You know... I was drinking this the other day, thinking that I'd already reviewed it, and thinking to myself, ""Wow! This sure changes quickly! Only 6 months old and this stuff is awesome!"" Of course, ha, silly me! I'd never reviewed it before! Ha ha! I like this because of what it doesn't have... It doesn't that that bittersweet chocolate taste. It doesn't have that burned espresso taste. It's smooth and sweet and caramel. Maybe a touch smoked, but really, only a touch. Good stuff. Like a blend of barleywine and imperial porter. OK, awesome stuff. Drink it again? In a heartbeat. I love how they've made a beer this big in flavor and everything at only 8%. Very cool. Good job!"
"Meh. There are much better imperial stouts out there."
"An average RIS. It's solid, but I feel I have had better. Still, recommended. It's complex enough that someone will probably chalk it up as one of their favs."
"While it may be shy of the top few in its category, it should serve as proof you don't need to approach 12% abv to make an outstanding RIS."
"Pours very dark with minimal to no head. Nose- not a big nose to this beer - faint roast and fruits. Taste- lots of black licorice and plum , roast and chocolate is more in the background. Relatively light bodied example of the style, especially for an american crafted RIS. Carbonation is medium and drinkability is high. Could use more hops and body but a decent drinker."
"Thin mouthfeel compared to some of the behemoths of the same style, but this is weaker in alcohol content. Still a sipper, but very enjoyable and well done. I enjoy the drinkable 8.0% abv compared to some of the monster being put out there."
"Notes - Very good stuff that manages to stay true to the style but still stand out from the pack."
"Pours a deep black with a decent light-tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is loads of roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. The taste is a nice blend of the usual suspects of the style. The beer is medium bodied with slightly heavy carbonation and fairly well hidden alcohol. This is another run-of-the-mill Imperial Stout at best."
"Easily drinkable for the style, especially with the relatively lower ABV compared to other imperials."
"Not a bad beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit slick upfront, finishes tingly despite low carbonation. Slightly dry and tannic."
"Poured black with a mocha brown slightly red-tinged fine frothy Ovaltine head. Nose is cocoa powder, Hershey bars, soy, burnt espresso bean and caramel. Burnt flavors flash on first sip, touch of sweet cocoa, coffee, stewed fruits or hint of raisins. Burnt edges return, it gets all dusty and dry, finishes with a mild but enduring toasty bitterness. The alcohol is only noticable over time; a warming tingle suffuses your mouth after a bit. Then it suffuses your head. The mouthfeel is good, plenty of fuzzy carbonation in a medium to full body. It ain't thick or oily though. Smooth and smoother, but not docile. Mighty fine."
"Quite drinkable, if you can take the 8%ABV. A fine example of the Imperial Stout style."
"A little more carbonation than I usually like in the style. Overall, a good easy-drinking Impy Stout that's not too rich or strong in alcohol."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, OK drinkability, sessionable considering its high ABV"
"Taste is commanded by the malt, coffee has a stronger presence than the chocolate undertones though. Creamy not but overly syrupy, in fact, bit thin for the style which is hard to ignore, has the slightest burn of alcohol."
"I would recommend this to anyone who wants to begin traveling down the dark path of RIS, it's not an overhelming experience for the beginner."
"D: Pretty good. Nothing to complain about."
"Not the greatest RIS you'll ever have, but certainly a decent sipper for pre-bedtime relaxation. I'm enjoying it."
"D - One was certainly enough for me. Not something I'd revisit often, but I suppose if one were more inclined to drink stouts this wouldn't be a bad choice. Worth a try."
"D- Very drinkable, but I think this is due mostly to the abv being on the lower end for an RIS. Still a very tasty and enjoyable brew."
"12 oz bottle bought singly for about $3 from Gary's in Madison... certainly one of the better brews from Weyerbacher... I would consider this the bigger, bolder version of their Black Hole beer... a great Imperial Stout with a chocolate, velvet mouthfeel, creamy, rich, dark taste... Pours a jet-black, ebony hue with no head or lacing at all... smell is replete with burnt chocolate, dark-espresso... taste strongly complements the aroma with a creamy, rich, nutty, dark-latte flavor... a very nice, rich cocoa flavor dominates the pallate... all in all, a great brew... a winner from Weyerbacher... good stuff... will certainly try this again... Drinkability was pretty good for an 8% ABV... alcohol is difficult to detect behind a rich and bold combination of dark chocolate flavors... Recommended..."
"Strong roasted barley nose. Smells like it could be a monster but ends up a bit short, on the thin side when it hits your palate. Lacking the true depth and complexity of flavor that the best RIS can impart."
"Dark as night as I pour into the glass. Very little if any head with a medium pour. The aroma is that of coffee and caramel. As it's given a swirl around the glass, it leaves thick translucent swirls around the sides. Very smooth feel in the mouth, somewhat dry heavy in the beginning and tapers in the aftertaste. Very drinkable. Another vote for Weyerbacher from me."
"I wasn't too impressed by this beer. Perhaps it was a bit past its peak but I would still expect more flavor and balance from a good RIS. There are too many superior choices out there..."
"Top notch Imperial Stout. Rich, complex, very well balanced. No overly roasted bitterness or fusel alcohol flavors, and the hops add a nice complement. Very enjoyable."
"Pours deep black with some mahogany tones picked up by light, not much head to speak of although could have been a product of a gentle pour, leaves a toffee/latte colored surface residue. The initial aroma is of fruit and alcohol, although you can also pick up the sense of malt and coffee. The main flavors are of chocolate and strong coffee, with a faint and welcome aftertaste of roasted malt. The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for an imperial, not too bitter. The abv might be the only challenge with having a bunch of these, though could def have a few. I seem to recall liking the Weyerbacher Heresy maybe a tiny bit better, but the fact that they have two top notch imperial stouts is a testament to their quality."
"Served at just about cellar temperature, from a twelve ounce brown bottle, into a pint glass. Poured a deep motor oil black that not a single ray of light could pass through. A somewhat vigorous pour yielded about two fingers of thick, bubbly brown head. Head faded pretty quickly into a thin layer of cream atop the beer. Some sticky, spotty lace was left behind in the glass.Nose was chocolatey, with a bit of burnt coffee, some thick roasted malt aromas, and a tiny bit of noticeable hops buried in the background. Taste was chocolate, some more coffee, a ton of sweet roasted malts, a bit of booze, vanilla extract and some toffee. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for my liking. No chewyness that I like from the style. Minimal carbonation, and some noticeable alcohol. Decent drinkability."
"Flavor is thick with malts. Strong and firm, it does not waver. Hearty, tar like, so deep, it goes beyond coffee or chocolate and just enters a realm of robust that you don't want to mess with. Coffee hits you in the end after the thick malts have finally calmed down. Feel is thick on liquid with a lower carbonation that you'd expect. Definitely drinkable. Very smooth and very well made. This is one to try. Go get it."
"It is black. The head is light brown. The first smells are prunes, coffee, BOOZE. Then, in my snifter glass, it evolves to cocoa and dark berries (black, blue, rasp.). The flavor has less impact than the aroma, and adds roasted malts, coffee, and bitter cola. Body is medium-full with a dry toasty finish that reveals alcohol - more than is good, yet not too much. I liked the aromas best. Would I buy again? Not while Old Rasputin is still around all year."
"looked pitch black at first, but when i really took a good look, i noticed some ruby and brownish highlights. it all sat underneath a thick tan head that hung around fairly long and left good lace. nose wasn't super strong like i like in my ris's, but nice nonetheless. sweet and roasty. notes of chocolate, cocoa and very faint coffee. taste was pretty much what the nose suggested. the chocolate came through in the finish as well as some cocoa and maybe some dark fruit as well. mouthfeel was very impressive, as always from the weyerbacher crew. super smooth and creamy. in my opinion, the strongest point for this stout. easy, very unoffensive stout. i'm a huge weyerbacher fan, and i'd gladly have another."
"A very strong pour yeilds a slow growing solid inch and a half dark brownish tan head. Sits atop a thick oil rich black body. Nose is shockingly sweet with fresh dark fruit notes and hints of smokey chocolate. A little loose and scattered as it hits the tongue. Soured fruity notes meets bitter chocolate. Burnt toffee and raw minerals also are there. Lacks the richness and balance of what are big plus in the better Imperial stouts. Alchol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is a little to sour for the style. Drinkability is hurt by this."
"Big bodied, nice and creamy smooth, perhaps the ultimate dessert beer. I'd go back to this one for sure. Great RIS from a great brewery."
"Heavy, slightly syrupy body with a semidry finish. Not very clean even though the flavor fades relatively quickly. A decent amount of warmth in the finish and thats about it. Not a bad selection but about as middle-of-the-road as you can get for the style."
"Overall, the taste is not overbearing, but has enough to satisfy even the stricter souls. This is a nice relaxing stout, very enjoyable."
"This is heavenly -- chocolate, coffee, roasty, medium sweetness, medium body, long finish. Try this in a glass accompanied by some Ben & Jerrys Dublin Mudslide ice cream. Youd swear that these two things shared ingredients with each other  the pairing is faultless."
"Big thanks to LittleBreeze for this lovely bottle! <br> Pours oily, thick black with a big tan creamy head after a violent pour. Notes of Dry cocoa, rich dark roastiness, faint hint of alcohol as it warms, and some nutty, oaty sweetness as well. Very nice. Taste is nicely dark roasted, with drying cocoa powder notes. Again a touch of alcohol that is unobtrusive. Body is a bit more carbonated than expected but subdues after a bit and the beer is still thick and nice. Overall this is a great beer that surpassed my expectations. Thanks so much for this one Ginny!"
"This beer poured black with a dark tan single-finger head. It smells mostly of roasted malts with just a slight hint of coffee. The taste has a very strong dark chocolate presence with a slight bit of coffee and caramel and a bit of an alcohol undertone. The mouthfeel is very silky and pleasant. I'd consider this a fairly drinkable Imperial Stout, and I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up grabbing another bottle in the future."
"Pretty easy to drink, but this did not wow me. If it was local to me I would perhaps drink a few during the winter, but not one i will seek out again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass with a short, light tan colored head that dissipated quickly into a thin layer of foam. Color was dark brown-black. Thin, consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Strong aromas of malt, coffee and dark chocolate, with a subtle background scent of dark fruit essences. Flavors similar to smell; however addition of caramel or toffee at the finish. Carbonation was almost undetectable with a silky smooth mouthfeel, although overall consistency is a little thin for the style. Non-exist alcohol bite and relatively low ABV makes this a good choice for a session imperial."
"Still this beer has a lot going on for it, in all the right ways. The smell is sweet, the taste is pleasant but not powerful; this reminds me a lot of a nice pinot noir, or a balanced, non-tannins bomb merlot. It's probably the cleanest RIS I've ever had. There's not one thing about this beer that can be classified as excessive. A really great, overlooked Russian Imperial Stout."
"I have no qualms with this as an easy drinking RIS on the lower end of the alcohol scale, although I have to admit I expect far more from the style. I wouldn't encourage any substantial aging nor would I highly recommend the beer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it!"
"A different sort of RIS for sure lacking the usual hop bite at the end found in most American versions. Makes for a wonderful desert beer."
"In the process of sampling and evaluating a number of stouts, this one was recommended to me by my local retailer. I was not disappointed. With Guinness as the de facto standard, I say this one surpasses Guinness on most every factor except appearance and smell where Old Heathen is merely on par. Color is virtually black, carbonation is present but not distracting. I appreciate this beer's fullness of flavor but absence of salty, burnt flavors that I find unpleasant in Guinness. The taste is full, round, and balanced. It reminds me of a quality oatmeal stout, but without the oaty shadow. Mouthfeel is not especially creamy, more like passing a hard candy over one's tongue, though without excessive sweetness. There is a slight tartness to the aftertaste, but nothing unpleasant. I liked this stout and expect to have it again."
"Poured a dark brown, near black, that had an okay head that faded relatively quickly. No lacing to speak of. The smell had aromas of prunes, figs, soy, and roasted grain. The taste was rich and fruity up front, and then fell off toward the finish and became winier and roastier. Relatively dry. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and pretty creamy. Fairly enjoyable, but eclipsed by many other examples of the style."
"Drinkability: Check. Ive had it once and dont need to again. Seriously, the Old Heathen is nothing compared to Dark Lord or one of the Stouts from Bell's (3.0)"
"The perfect carbonation of this stout makes it very drinkable. The layers of flavor make every sip a true experience. I'll definitely buy this one again."
"d: a sipper for sure, as it should be"
"Drinkability - Good. This one goes down easy"
"Smells amazing, like dark chocolate, and coffee. Tastes exactly how it smells, nicely balanced beer, milkshake like, as it warms it gets more exoctic with all flavors being released. Not hoppy - just right. Wonderfully drinkable - disguises alcohol, you don't even know it's there, even though it shows it's legs when you swirl the glass. Perfectly decadent, buy it by the case. :)"
"Drinkability - on the low end for abv, putting them on the high end for a few more. A great solid I.S."
"Tried this beer last night while watching the Yanks-Indians. I picked it up in a mix six pack yesterday at Total Wine and tried it after a Peg Leg Imperial Stout. It poured a nice dark brown color with a dark foamy head. Not much lacing. Had a nose of roasted coffee. Had a nice taste and a little more bite to it than the Peg Leg. Had a good feel in the mouth and was pretty smooth."
"This has clearly aged in the two years since bottling, perhaps a bit more than expected, but it is still a tasty brew and would even age gracefully for at least another couple of years."
"EDIT: I've had several more of these in the past year and it gets nothing but better. Wonderful smoky, coffee flavors, smoother going down. Better all around than the first 1/4 case."
"The taste is similarly good, full of roasted goodness, plum, roasted and black strap malts, molasses, espresso, and a warm rum through the middle. Unfortunately, that carbonation I've been talking about is very distracting in the mouth, and hampers the onslaught of flavors. Fortunately, after some warming, that carbonation also tones down, and am able to enjoy it better. Overall, a pretty good impy stout, not my fav, but glad I had it for sure."
"Not over the top, not underwhelming. A nice RIS. If it was in my marketplace I'd pick some up for the winter season."
"Drank easy for the abv, a decent not great IMP Stout"
"Drinkability: Great. I think this beer has improved since the first time I had it a few years ago. It's a very very drinkable stout that isn't outrageously expensive. I could see myself buying a case/keg of this during the winter months. The earthy flavors are very approachable for my palate. I would pair this with some funky cheeses or even alone as a dessert. It would do well with grilled meat, too. Very nice. One of the better stouts I've had this year."
"D - ABV is well hidden. Tasty but flavor needs to reflect aroma a bit more to be outstanding."
"Still smooth and malty, nowadays it seems like everyones trying to knock you out at the first sip. Old Heathen is a beer that knows balance."
"D: Perhaps not the most fantastic RIS I've come across, but definitely worth a try, especially for fans of the style. A quite quaffable brew in the RIS category, yet perhaps a little tame compared to its competitors. Nevertheless, it's still a good offering by Weyerbacher, as this beer is not without merit."
"A little disapointng on the mouthfeel, though. Seemed to be a bit thin. I expected more for a ""impy"" stout."
"This is a potent brew, although it seems more alcoholic than the abv would suggest. That leads me to believe that this beer is underflavored. It's good but, IMHO, not as good as some of the other reviews suggest."
"Drinkability: A delightful stout fresh and even moreso a year later."
"It did pour a nice inky black with a good finger sized head. Decent, but not superlative."
"D- pretty solid and enjoyable to drink, but ide prolly pick up some bells stout or something else before this"
"Weyerbacher Old Heathen pours a thick inky black with a small head that dissipates quickly. The smell is rich caramel malts, very sweet with a decent amount of roastiness. The flavor is nice and sweet first, with a light fruitiness that gives way to chocolatey roasted malts. Warming alcohol is apparent in the finish, more than I would expect for 8%. It has a slightly whiskey like flavor to it, as if it was aged in oak barrels."
"i could drink a few"
"Pours black, with a small dark tan head. In the aroma, alcohol and a sugary coffee smell. In the taste, a nice coffee and chocolate malt. It does have a sticky malt, yet smooth, yet a nice alcohol presence. I think this is one of the better beers from Weyerbacher, yet it seems to overlooked alot."
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. A very nice dark brown/black opaque color. Minimal head, that was slightly brown and foamy. The head disappeared quickly. Aroma seemed of sweet brown sugar oatmeal. Taste was slightly sweet with grains with oatmeal cookie flavors. Very easy going down. Nice thickness to the beer, lingered in the mouth just enough to be pleasant. A slight bitter aftertaste, but nothing bad. Great beer."
"Poured into a chalice a nice deep black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly roasted, lots of coffee/caramel. The taste is malty, roasted, slightly tangy/bitter, a good dose of coffee/caramel. The alcohol is hidden pretty well though. Medium body, a well rounded brew. Drinkable, the brew lacks something (more malts, more oaky/roastedness to bring it over the top), glad to have had a chance to try it though. Recommended."
"Taste is mild molasses with burned coffee notes. This burned taste also gives a maltbitterness, which together with the hop bitterness make it a real treat. There is a wood taste that I can only describe as fresh wood or timber. As I move along I get more and more dark chocolate taste. Some booziness in the back of my throat, a warming feeling, which is nice. Mouthfeel is velvety, viscous and a little sweet and sticky. Drinkability is very good, the 8% alcohol wasn't very detectable."
"Flavor is malty with bits of coffee and dark chocolate. Kind of a wholesome breadiness to the beer as well. Very full body but the flavor does not stic to the cheeks as I expected. ABV is hardly noticeable but warms one up. Honestly, this would be a decent winter beer."
"taste is weak so its hard to tell"
"D- ABV very well hidden in this brew by the big robust taste. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable imperial stout. This came in my weyerbacher ""big beers"" variety pack. This and double simcoe have shown to be excellent brews. I am looking foreward to trying the other 2 in this pack I have not had yet"
"D: The abv is fairly high, I don't see this beer being a regular go-to. The flavor is strong nonetheless, packing a big punch that goes down pleasantly."
"This is a IS, so it's meant to be savored. A beer I prefer during cold winter nights but certainly can be enjoyed anytime."
"pours jet black inthe glass no light comes through. rich medium tan two finger head holds well with some nice sticky lacing. mostly coffee aromas with a hint of bitter chocolate and some earthy, smokiness. slightly sweet and smooth. coffee up front then bitter chocolate with dried prune, dark molasses, and brown sugar. light mouthfeel and carbonation is just right. the 8 % abv is the only reason not to session with this beer."
"Like I said, this is one of my favorites. Everything about this beer is just done right."
"D: A good RIS, enjoyable for the husky smoke qualities and more dry finish. Another solid offering from Weyerbacher; glad to have another bottle to enjoy later. Thanks again, Damian."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Black, with a decent coffee-colored head. Mainly a coffee aroma, espresso-like. The taste was a little more on the dark chocolate side, with the coffee lurking in the background. I thought this was a little timid, compared to other imperial stouts. Nevertheless, a very good beer, and eminently drinkable."
"The first sip starts out smooth and creamy, with nothin' but roasted chocolate malts paving the way. They're almost roasted to the point of being burnt, but it's a big plus nevertheless. Out of nowhere, the coffee in this brew takes hold and sends your tongue for a ride. The aftertaste is straight from java-lover's heaven. Mouthfeel is med-thick bodied, and tries to coat the palate, but it's no match for the bitter finish. This RIS will certainly be sought after when I'm in the mood for big-time malt/roasted flavors."
"Note: I do not generally comment on the freshness dating or lack thereof on the beers that I'm drinking but in the case of the beers from this case I will make an exception. There is non freshness date on these bottles, however, there is a very clear best before stamp on the case and it claims that I should have drank this by 02/03/07. I can only guess that Weyerbacher puts the date on the case because they are from PA and we here (generally) have to buy by the case, still it would be nice if it was on the bottle."
"Not a bad Impy Stout, but Ive had others Ive definitely enjoyed more."
"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass. Wow this is a black beer. The head is really dark as well. It is almost mahogany in color and it sticks around for the entirety of the drink. The smell is rich and hearty with thick black char and dark roasted malts. The flavor is also rich and hearty. Big burnt maltiness up front with a grassy/earthy hop ending. Finishes sharp and abruptly with a char taste left on the tongue. The mouthfeel was right up the middle as far as the style goes: thick, milky, and chewy, but not quite as syrupy as a Baltic Porter. Drinkability: I had it after a caramelized, rum banana and chocolate after dinner snack, and it paired very well."
"A nice RIS."
"D - A very drinkable RIS, considering the manageable ABV and less-than-over-the-top flavors - if there is such a thing as a session RIS, this fits the category."
"Good stuff"
"A new beer I found at Rockland Food Service. Pours pitch black, small brown head, a very inviting looking beer. Smells lightly of cocoa. Flavor is really nice, dry cocoa, molasses, malt, and a little bit of sourness in the background, a bit different from what I was expecting in a stout, but damn nice. Overall a really impressive stout. This is what Guiness should be making for a stout. Go get some!!"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable RIS."
"D- It is a nice stout. I don't think it is anything to go crazy over but if I could find it in Vegas I would probably always keep some on hand since it is a nice easy drinking imperial stout."
"This beer poured a deep black color with about an inch of tan head. As I consumed the beer a nice sticky lacing was left on the glass. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Tastes like chocolatey coffee. Medium body and carbonation and easy to drink. This has been one of my favorite beers to date."
"Drinkability: Quite the drinkable imperial stout, though I think that owes a lot to the lighter body and the back-seat nature of the alcohol. The 8% is hidden well, but, to be honest, I'd actually want it to be noticed a bit in an imperial stout."
"Thanks to markgugs for this bottle."
"Arrived in a shaker glass a rich deep brown color with about an inch of dark tan foam. No lacing to speak of. Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and mild hints of coffee and a touch of smoke. Tastes of bittersweet cocoa, mild roasted coffee, molasses and vanilla. Medium in both body and carbonation. An overall decent Imp. stout."
"Picked up a six pack of this beer at my local Whole Foods along Route 9 in Greenfield Ma. It poured a black complexion, with a small tannish white lace head. Smell had all the characters of an imperial stout that i like, dark fruit (prune and cherry) and dark chocolate. Taste had some smokey charcoal up front, followed by some molaases sweetness, and a baked chocolate cake flavor in the end. The body of this beer seemed pretty light surprisingly. After the second glass, I needed to take a break despite the fact that I could drink this beer all night long. The alcohol is not very apparent in the taste, but it is there for sure. The last time I had this beer, it was really awful. Flavors were all over the place, and in all it just seemed like it was a really poor stout. Maybe they have changed the recipe, or I just received a bad sample. Either way, I highly recommend this brew. Oh, and one final thought: After going a while without trying any Weyerbacher beers, I can say that they are extremely under appreciated. Cheers"
"Overall- I will buy a 6'er of this one, a very rare thing for me, but this is one that will improve with age. I'm suprised that it doesn't rate as highly as blackout stout or other great stouts of it's ilk. Weyerbacher is a very underrated brewery."
"D - good. for being what it is I dont get tired of it and the lighter body helps as well."
"Usually a couple of these are all i can handle. But a fine handle it surely will be."
"This beer is black as coal and there is a fair head that quickly dissipates. The smell is coffee like and also somewhat like the candy section of a general store. Cinnamon I guess. The taste is very malty, with oatmeal and coffee flavors dominate. The mouthfeel is smooth with a smokiness that is a nice finish. The drinkability is good. One of the better of the style I have had. I don;t usually go for this style or even this brewer but this is tops. Brewers best and best of the style I have had."
"Poured extremely dark brown. Tasted strong chocolate malt flavors. Had a nice dry finish. I could taste some additional alcohol flavors that reminded me of a fine aged wine. Some have reviewed this beer as having a strong hops flavor but I tasted little to no hops (which is a good thing to me). This was a very good beer and would defineately buy this one again."
"Poured into the glass with a distinctly slick oil look, and settled with a 1 finger dark tan head and impenetrably dark color. The smell was slightly sweet with a roasted quality to it. The taste was at first slightly sweet and malty with a mild chocolate quality, and transitioned into a well balanced hoppy finish that the higher alcohol level contributes nicely to. What really suprised me about this IS was the very pronounced coffee/chocolate notes in the aftertaste. Although I reviewed this beer completely sober, even much later in the evening when I was pretty inebriated, those coffee notes in the aftertaste really stood out. The mouthfeel was great, nice and smooth with a lower level (but very satisfying) level of carbonation. Drinkability was incredibly easy. Even for being a full bodied beer, it went down easy the entire night. I'll have to review this beer again to see if there's anything I dislike about it, because it was honestly just a great beer. In fact, I think I'll go have one right now."
"The beer poured a dark mahogany with a tan head. The aroma is lightly of malt and has some licorice hints. The beer tastes of malt and licorice. The feel is heavy but neither oily nor dry. When I first tried this beer it was relativley fresh and the hops were overwhelming. Now having aged for 9 months it has taken a whole new character. It has gone from a harsh hop demonstration to a smooth and interesting brew. I've never run into a licorice taste before and I find it quite interesting."
"Thanks for the bottle JahNoth."
"Drinkability. I Love this beer, great taste to me not too strong alcohol taste. One of my favorite Imperials!"
"I'm not to big on imperial stouts to begin with, and as such this beer isnt really one of my favorites, but as stouts go, its probably one of the better regional offerings. Still is no Storm King, but not many things are."
"The color was dark as can be with a cappuccino head. Toffee, dark chocolate and expresso dominated the aroma. Flavor followed suite with a slick, resiny texture to it. Also a bit of Irish Whiskey in the flavor. I enjoyed this quite a bit more than the other Weyerbacher beers I've tried.."
"You can taste the alcohol, but that's not necessairly a bad thing."
"D: Good stuff. It masks its higher alcohol content well."
"Cheers!"
"This is a nice run at the Impy Stout style and would benefit greatly with a little additional bittering hop addition to help hide some of the throat-warming alcohol. Despite that minor complaint, I really like this beer...pass the peanut brittle and caramel corn!"
"Drinkability is pretty good, this isn't a knock-your-socks-off imperial stout but it is a solid beer from Weyerbacher."
"D- This beer has a good complexity and depth but even though it is well blended it is still a big beer."
"Very drinkable. Im not sure whats up with no head, maybe I poured it too well? Id like to have some more, though not sure its the big time RIS though."
"Imperial in alcohol only, not in flavor. Expecting a big full flavored beer after smelling it but couldn't live up to it's name."
"drinkability: average"
"Very dark, almost completely black with faint ruby highlights. Dense chocolatey head that shows a bit of lacing and good retention. Malty aroma with some cola, licorice, chocolate and roast. Also a bit of alcohol. Moderate bitterness with a lot of malt sweetness and cocoa. Light vanilla middle. It also has a significant nutty character, very peanutty. Finishes with some cola and alcohol. The carbonation is a bit lively and coarse on the palate, but overall the texture's decent. Slight dryness and some alcohol warmth. Not bad, fairly average stout. Fairly easy drinking though."
"The Weyerbacher Old Heathen Imperial Stout pours from the bottle a deep black color with a decent, though somewhat thin, reddish-brown head. There is also some noticeable red tint shining through at the edges when held up to the light. A very nice looking beer. The thinned-out head leaves very little lace. The aroma is sweet, with notes of vanilla, chocolate, and molasses. Maybe some pear as well? This is an aroma I could grow accustomed to. It tastes nice too. Creamy vanilla, chocolate, and some coffee bitterness all appear in the flavor. Some toffee as well, perhaps. A decent mouthfeel, but not as pronounced as I would have guessed; a bit thin for an imperial stout. But overall, the Old Heathen is a job well done. Sometimes Weyerbacher, in my opinion, has a tendancy to over-do things a bit with their beers, but they hit the spot on this one. A quality Imperial Stout to add to the collection."
"A very rich, robust stout that is smooth and fairly easy to drink. A well-made Imperial Stout."
"Thanks MuenchenerKindl! This was one mighty tastey beer."
"No looking though this one. Coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, hop. Yeah, it's in there. Starts out with the coffee and roasted malt, then finishes with a bit of a hop and alcohol bite. Alchohol is present, even for an 8 abv. A bit on the heavy side as far as body and taste. Overall, not a bad beer to warm you up when the temps go down but I can only handle a six pack at most. Not my favorite Imperial, but priced resonably enough that you can afford to have a decent Stout on hand to share with your friends."
"Thick but smooth, surprisingly so. Not a dry stout. Good but too strong to drink all night. A fine brew, however. Burnt flavor that is appealling."
"Drinkability: Good, maybe a little bland, but a good beer."
"Pours black with a small dark tan head that fades back quickly. Nice roastiness in the aroma along with a light chocolate and marshmallow sweetness. There is a cola-y sweetness up front in the taste that mixes with some tingly carbonation on the tongue. The roastiness comes into the taste shortly thereafter with a somewhat acidic twang that mixes with a nicely dry finish. I enjoyed the crisp sharp bite from the carbonation and hops and the nice dry finish, but would have liked a little heavier, thicker body. An enjoyable easy to drink beer."
"Drinkability - Big fan of this beer, another homerun for the Weyerbacher guys. This is only my 2nd Imperial Stout (Storm King being the other) and this beer is yet another testemant to this impressive catagory."
"12 oz. bottle into a tumbler was black with just enough head to coat the top. Smells of mostly roasted malts with some sweetness lingering. Tastes of bitter, dark chocolate. Sweet tastes first switching to burnt and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and creamy if left to swirl in your mouth or in the glass. Very good drinkability with a lower price. Have had quite a few of these as a good go-to stout. Very lucky to be close to Weyerbacher."
"For some reason we have these ice cream-filled chocolate nuggets in the freezer that never get eaten. We have strawberry and cookies and cream. I decided to try some with this Impy Stout. Wonderful. I had to stop lest I were to stand there at the freezer eating all that crap."
"Poured out nearly black, crowned by a foamy tan head with lots of lacing. The nose offers basic chocolate and coffee, rounded out by spice and alcohol. The taste was even more straightforward; coffee again, chocolate again, and spice again. The alcohol was disguised nicely here though. Has a creamy mouthfeel and a long slick finish."
"it's got a sharpness to it, despite the low % (not an ethanol sharpness, just something up front that goes POP). it's very winey up front, and actually does not boast much of a RIS character in the flavor...soy sauce, mildly roasted finish. it's thin and fizzy, too"
"This one has been sitting in the cellar for at least 18 months, maybe 2 years. Pours black, with just the faintest tinge of brown around the edges. Small tan head that fades to a halo around the top very quickly. Smell is coffee and bourbon. The 8% really shows itself. I thought it may have mellowed over time but i think it is more pronounced. Coffee, chocolate and some dark fruit can be noted in the taste, but again the alchohol comes through. This isn't a bad thing on a cool fall day and gives a nice warming feeling. Overall a nice RIS. About what I've come to expect from Weyerbacher."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, full bodied, along with some creamy, buttery notes along the tongue. There are also aspects of roastyness, and fruitiness that lead to a roasty bitterness. Perhaps there is also a tinge of sulfer buried in there as well."
"D - Not too good, it isn't the sort of beer you drink a lot of, there are a lot of superior stouts on the market IMO. If you are looking for a ""sour stout," then this is a viable option. I might have it again, since Weyerbacher is so local. I am excited to try the heresy I have though!"
"Pours pitch black with a big caramel brown head that goes away pretty quickly. Smell is huge. Chocolate, coffe, sweet malts, cherries, chocolate covered cherries! Alcohol as well can be picked up by the nose. Taste is less eventful than the aroma though. Big alcohol burn for only an 8.0% abv. Lots of roasty coffee flavors, roasty malts, andlike I said alcohol. I was expecting it to way more robust, judging by the aroma it packed but was letdown a bit. Mouthfeel isn't as heavy as a typical Imperial Stout but is still creamy. One of these is good enough for me. It's not a bad brew. It's just that there are so many others that are a lot better."
"DA: This is a very drinkable RIS."
"D - Just a tremendous stout. Can't reccomend highly enough. I already want more."
"Like many of Weyerbacher's beers, this one is entirely drinkable and enjoyable. I highly recommend it."
"Perhaps a little one-dimensional, but it would still be a good pick if you like stouts on the dry side."
"This is a great stout. I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"This beer was pours pitch black with a creamy tan head that dissipates to nice whisps of film with some lace. The smell mostly sweet roasted malts with some chocolate. The taste is very sweet as well with roasted chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel has a medium to full body with smooth carbonation. Overall a nice Imperial Stout. Quite drinkable, strait forward and not too complex but a good beer."
"D: One stellar Impy stout. I'm very happy these are in 12oz'ers. Abv goes unmasked with only a subtle cameo. Definately worth tracking down and added for the winter season."
"I'm beginning to fall in love with Weyerbacher beers. I'm unsure of their distribution in NC, but they were at the Charlotte Oktoberfest and their line seemed to be the longest most of the time. Just a great Russian Imperial stout that would love to just have more more and more."
"and malt. Smooth, with a nice sweetness. A little dry on the finish. Not quite as much depth as I might like, but hardly a disappointment. Definitely improves as it warms. This is the type of beer that you could drink two (or maybe three) and call it a good night. It will be interesting to see how my perception changes as it gets colder and the snow starts to fly."
"I don't know if my palet isn't ""expanded"" enough, but I really didn't like this beer. It felt really good in my mouth, and the smell was rather aromatic. I don't know what was in this beer, but I think I'm going to try it a couple more times and then make a better judgement. If anyone knows what would be a good ""beginning"" beer for me to try if I was going to find out more about Old Heathen. Don't drink and review."
"Coal black with a mocha brown slightly red-tinged fine frothy Ovaltine head. Nose is cocoa powder, Hershey bars, soy, burnt espresso bean and caramel. Burnt flavors flash on first sip, touch of sweet cocoa, coffee, stewed fruits or hint of raisins. Burnt edges return, it gets all dusty and dry, finishes with a mild but enduring toasty bitterness. The alcohol is only noticable over time; a warming tingle suffuses your mouth after a bit. Then it suffuses your head. The mouthfeel is good, plenty of fuzzy carbonation in a medium to full body. It ain't thick or oily though. Smooth and smoother, but not docile. Mighty fine."
"Once again, Weyerbacher does not disappoint. Great beer overall, and one that I prefer over the Heresy. Usually I really like oak aged beers, but this Old Heathen shows so much more complexity and flavor than the vanilla bomb (that I love dearly) of Heresy. Cheers to Weyerbacher!"
"A solid RIS, through and through. Always a good option when in the mood for this style, and one of the best offerings out of Weyerbacher's standard lineup. Fans of this style will not be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Well, its ABV precludes it from being a session beer, but I wouldn't mind having a few."
"Overall it is a nice interpretation of style. But could benefit from some body. Enjoy this one"
"Overall- 1 of the best, if not BEST, stouts I've ever had!! Loved it!!! You could not detect the 8% abv!!! Can't wait til it gets cold so I can drink this more often!!!"
"I must add that the name ""Old Heathan"" is absolutely awesome. Very evocative. Additionally, the packaging is sweet."
"Taste; as with the aroma, there's roasted malts with a slightly bitter coffee flavor. Some plums and raisins are present as well as some chocolate and molasses. This is a bit more subdued than I was expecting for an Imperial stout, but sometimes it's a good thing to not be bludgeoned by your beer. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner that i would have liked, but the drinkability was very nice."
"Poured ink black, with a sand coloured head that faded away in a few seconds. Smelled like I thought it would with plenty of unsweetened chocolate and roasted malts. However, what I wasn't expecting, was the slightly fruity, vinous undertone. This was present in the taste, as well. Taste was mostly more of the smell. I really didn't care for the vinous, wine-like character I got from this. It didn't ruin the beer, but I certainly gave it lower marks for this. The mouthfeel was also thinner than I was expecting. This isn't a bad RIS; you could do worse. You could do much, much better, too."
"This is a very nice beer and I am thoroughly enjoying it but it seems to me that it's just barely off the mark. Perhaps this one would do better with some age? High on my list of Imperial Stouts but still needs some tweaking to reach the pinnacle."
"Pours from the bottle thick, black as night and oily. Produces a 1"" thick tight, dense head with great durability. Some spotty lacing noted as glass is consumed. Pleasant, but somewhat restrained aromas of black roasted malts, bakers cocoa, dark roasted coffee beans, chocolate and dried dark fruits. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but full, thick and chewy. Flavors, as with the aroma, are enjoyable and well balanced, but slightly tame for a big RIS. Espresso, semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, prune, raisin and roasted malts are apparent. Starts out moderately sweet, but slips into a mild, crisp bitterness in the finish. Alcohol lends a very mild warmth. A well done RIS, but could use a bit more muscle."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability/Overall: A nice upper-middle echelon RIS. Falls a little short on the palate after a beautiful nose, but highly drinkable for the style with plenty of complexity. Thanks to expatsteve for lugging some back from PA for me."
"CHEERS!!"
"The drinkability is high I could drink plenty and reach for this any time, A great well balanced taste treat, Prosit un d Zum Wohl! MK"
"Very drinkable brew, although the high ABV would definitely sneak up on you, so drink carefully."
"Pretty easy drinking. I just wish it had more flavor and kept this ease of drinking."
"Drinkability- Very nice brew and a fine example of a impy stout."
"Low bitterness."
"Pours a gorgeous opaque midnight black color with a creamy coffee dense head. Aromas are chocolaty, fruity, licorice, and alcoholic. A moderately heavy mouthfeel covers the tongue with a thick coating of bitter chocolate, coffee, roasty deliciousness. This is a pretty incredible beer; carbonation is low but dead on. Hops are subdued but provide a bit of citrus backbone while the patent malts pick up the bulk of the bitterness. This is one of the best RIS's I've tried next to Expedition and BCS, amazing."
"This pours a jet black with a large chocolate looking head. This is a beautiful beer. The smell has dark fruit aroma,prunes, plums,or raisin, along with coffee and chocolate. The taste is rich and creamy with dark fruit flavors with chocolate and coffee also present. The m/f is lighter than other Imperial stouts,but the flavors are still mixed very well. This is one of the more easy drinking Imperial Stouts with the alcohol only ""sneeking up"" on you. Cheers."
"BeerBeing is killing me with these great samples! Weyerbacher is one hellava brewery."
"This is my first Weyerbacher beer since they've started distributing in NC and this has motivated me to try some others."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As smooth and light as a schwarzbier at first, this beer grows just enough in the mouth to present some viscousness. The carbonation takes a back seat to the silky feel over the tongue, and the swallow is very mellow. For the style, it has its moments... glad to have tried it, although it won't be finding its way back in the fridge."
"D: Not bad. Not great. Smooth and certainly drinkable."
"D: This beer is extremely easy to drink. There’s not hint of the 8.00% ABV and it’s not as filling as other RIS’s. It was one of those beers that I had a hard time keeping in the glass long enough to review. Overall, I think this is an excellent beer. I usually like a bigger kick with this style of beer, but I think any more strength would throw off the balance, so I consider it addition by subtraction."
"A pretty good Imp. Stout...not as good as Storm King or Old Rasputin, which are my two favorites...but enjoyable enough to buy now and then for variety."
"Very good, but maybe a little strong. I could have a couple of these and would recomend it highly to anyone."
"The mouthfeel is full-full/medium. Notes of toasted coffee, prune, candied almonds, nutmeg and anise come together with a medium dry finish with a soft bitter structure. Nicely done!"
"Not bad, although not really stand-out."
"This one pours jet black with a darkish brown, tightly bubbled head and a relatively still body. The aroma is quite nice and inviting, with loads of chocolate and coffee aromas, but also with touches of toffee and butter. The taste is even better, very complex, with bitterness first off, followed by a huge, round, juicy coffee/dark fruits/toffee middle. The finish is full of tingly carbonation and lingering sweetness. This is one helluva good imperial stout. Highly recommended."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head that retains well. The aroma has mild notes of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt,alcohol and metal, slightly dissapointing. The flavor starts off with an intense roasted coffe and dark chocolate flavor, followed by fruity esters and some cherry notes, light floral hops, ethanol and some mild metallic flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich without being overwhelming. Drinkability is average for a RIS. A descent imperial stout but nothing to seek out, like the other weyerbacher offerings i've tried."
"12 Oz bottle provided by Thaichile."
"12 oz bottle - Great company that produced a very underwhelming beer. This beer pours black with a slight brownish tint to it, and has a pretty big head for an imperial stout. Aroma is a lot of coffee and light alcohol. Alcohol is present in drinking, not overbearing at all - however, there is a taste of peanut shells that could not be washed away from my palate. Overall, the beer is brewed fine, smells and pours great - but doesn't taste as good as its matured state - Heresy. Possibly a great candidate to age in the cellar though. The one thing I can not get passed is the taste of peanut shells - very strange."
"I enjoy this brew overall but its not one of my favorite Imperial Stouts."
"D - ...makes this brew highly drinkable"
"Mouth feel is full flavored with a moderate amount of carbonation."
"Not quite black but still opaque. Mostly diminishing light brown head. Malt driven, very aromatic nose with hints of anise, molasses, expresso and chocolate. A short, barely distinquishable hint of hop buds and vanilla is present in the nose as well. Belly warming. Medium bodied. Roasty, well melded malt flavor with notes of expresso, anise, soy sauce and chocolate. Somewhat abrasive and bitter on the finish. An enjoyable brew and an above average Imperial Stout. An improved body and feel on the palate would make this beer much better though."
"Poured a black, opaque color with a tan colored head that remained intact for quite awhile and left behind plenty of lacing. Aromas of nuts, toasted malt, and vanilla with a faint floral scent. The taste followed the scent with a smooth, creamy texture and subtle fruity flavors, especially dates. Semi-sweet flavors with a slightly sour finish. Quite complex, but difficult to drink more than a single bottle in one sitting because it is so rich."
"Darkest, thickest brewed coffee; dense tan foam cap. Aromas of roasted malt, followed by vapors rum-soaked cherries and figs and mocha. Boozy and sweet cherry flavors emerge immediately; hop earthiness and pine buzz chase them down, leaving a roasted coffee memory in the wake. Alcohol warms the throat all the way to the belly. Bitter vegetable aftertaste -- like cooked greens. Piney hop burps. Taste is complex and interesting, but not yet delicious. Mouthfeel is viscous, but not quite slick; not-quite-full body. Slightly lower drinkability due to ""unmelded"" flavor character; needs more roastiness and less booziness. Is this what gets barrel-aged and turned into Heresy?"
"Drinkable for dessert or even breakfast. A totally solid stout all around. My experience so far with Weyerbacher is that they always nail the styles they go after...haven't had them all, but so far sooo good."
"This is a fairly well balanced beer but there's something not quite right about it. As a reference, I've been drinking the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout on and off this winter. Against that, it falls short. Still, it's a solid beer that hits the spot more often than it doesn't. It does well smoothly delivering on an 8% ABV, with just a hint coming out in the aftertaste. Plenty of maltiness here."
"Pours a very inky black color with a nice one inch thick tan head. No lacing whatsoever. Lots of dark fruit smells, especially prunes and a faint hint of alcohol. Decent taste lots of roasted malts, ends with some dark fruit flavors and some bitterness. The alcohol is hidden quite well in the taste. Mouthfeel is quite thin and a little chalky. Overall a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout. My first brew from Weyerbacher, and I'm anxious to try more. Recommended."
"A good suprisingly complex imperial stout."
"Rich and full flavored with nice balance of sweet dark roasted malt and hops. Reminiscent of dark toasted bread, pleasent slight burnt flavor, balanced by sweet licorice notes and perfectly balanced hops."
"A little thin overall, a little too sweet, and not quite enough in the bitter department...but its not all that bad. I just wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a real RIS."
"This is tasty but lighter both in flavor and body than most imperial stouts. It's hard for me to believe that this is 8%. I would consider this more along the lines of what are being called ""imperial porters"" than an imperial stout. Some might argue that quality makes it more drinkable than the average imperial stout."
"Cheers!"
"Over all a good beer, particularly because it was free!"
"Drinkability is pretty good for an Imperial Stout. Serving was a 12 oz bottle and it was not enough. I could easily have gone for a bomber, maybe even two over the course of an evening."
"Drinkability/notes  A warmer for sure, but a little bit of a let down for the style. I think my expectations were a little high because Weyerbacher has the reputation of being a big beer brewery. Dont get me wrong its still worth a shot. A nice winter nightcap."
"D - Can't put this one down. The unique flavors, as well as the smell leave me holding this one in the hand alternatiing between swirling around and catching a whiff or taking a sip. Very well done."
"The taste is very good, thick and chewy. There are tones of burnt malts that bring out a nice bitterness. There is a slight hint of warming alcohol in there as well. Overall, a very good stout."
"Hey I like it - I bought a case!"
" The taste is quite modest compared to most other big stouts. Roasted malt and coffee flavors dominate, with a moderate chocolate character and some vinous fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is very light for the style, but creamy. Drinkability is good, but mainly due to the understated nature of this beer. Imagine some of the over the top stouts in this world, but with less concentration. This would make a great introduction to big stouts, but would not satisfy one who seeks an aggressive stout."
"A good, drinkable beer but not in the same class as other true RIS's."
"rich dark brown with a thick tan head. the smell is a little underwhelming, good but not adequate especially given i put this in a snifter, a grainy roasted coffee aroma dominates with chocolate in the background. very mild dark fruity undertones of raisin and sweet plum. the provides no surprises when judged from the aroma. roasted coffee and cocoa, dark fruit. some bitterness at the finish. light medium body and fairly mild carbonation. not exactly what i was expecting. drinkability is good, nothing about this is difficult to drink. i could drink several. A respectable stout to be sure but i'm not sure how imperial it is."
"Pours black with a tan head. Sweet roasted aroma,was very inviting. Mouth feel is light and smooth. This beer has a bitter sweet taste that I found intresting. I don'y usually go for a beer with a bitter edge,but this was balanced out by the sweetness. Good stuff !"
"This is a good RIS. I've certainly had better, but this is good. It's big, malty, rich, dark, sweet, smooth, and has plenty of alcohol. Recommended."
"I have often overlooked Weyerbacher products but will search this one out again as the holidays approach."
"A very smooth and warming imperial stout. I don't know what the ABV is, but whatever it is it's hidden well. Almost too well, as I like a little alcohol burn in a brew such as this. Still, it's warming me up nicely, taking the chill out of my bones on a cold rainy night."
"overall: not a bad imperial stout. different flavors that what is expected, which is nice, but mouthfeel suffers a bit. i'm sure i'm supposed to, but i prefer the heresy. however, this is an easy to drink, tasty, nice try of an imperial stout."
"(Just a suggestion to maybe put where you get yours from for others in your area and reference)"
"I must admit that I am slightly biased towards this beer as I consider it to be one of the best I have ever tasted. It's expensive, and It's not very widely distributed, but as a an imperial stout, it really doesn't go bad from age. I did't bother to pour this beer as I with friends at the time but who really cares? It's a stout, it's going to be black with an off-white to beige head. The only way I can describe this complex, heavy yet ultra drinkable beer is that it tastes like oak with very slight vanilla undertones. The alcohol content is not at all apaarent and if you can taste it, it only serves to enhance the flavor. Every seperate flavor component of this beer compliments and suppliments the others so the feeling is truly, like there's a party in your mouth and everyone's invited. Can't wait to get back to jersey so I can drink this again. Recommended."
"Notes: very complex beer, one of my favorites"
"Pours ridiculously dark, impenetrable. A large but loosely bubbled, mocha colored head topped off the brew. While I was pouring this bad boy I got a whiff of it's scotch-like malt sweetness, hadn't really noticed that in other imperial stouts before. Mouthfeel seemed a bit lite for me.. but given that this beer is so friggin dark, I probably just anticipated it being a bit creamier. Taste seemed balanced for an imperial stout, with an excellent mix of hops, burnt malt sweetness, and warming alcohal. Taste is not overpowering, but ends with an astringent aftertaste."
"PLUS, for an imperial, this was reasonably priced and well, it was the flavor just like Brooklyn's double chocolate plus a note I haven't experienced before in a beer, it makes it very very buy-again."
"Old Heathen is a good take on the style from the good folks at Weyerbacher. Although it can't compete with the best of this style, it's definitely enjoyable beer. A bottle of the oak-aged version (Heresy) is lurking in my cellar right now and will be finding its way to my pint glass very soon. Thanks once again to blitheringidiot."
"Purchased in Ithaca, New York and sampled 12-29-04, taken from detailed notes. Pour is of a deep brown with a tight compact brown head. Aroma jumps out of the glass at you and is very vinious. Hint of roastiness are also lurking in the nose. Flavor starts of winey and the transforms itself into a roasty molasses flavor, a lot going on there!. Body is thick, somewhat chalky and drying and carries a long warming finish."
"Bottle: Poured a thick black color stout with a small dark head with good retention. Aroma consisted of roasted malt and light coffee. Taste is dominated by the roasted malt and isnt too bitter which I appreciated. Coffee and chocolate are bit too subtle for my liking but were still identifiable. Body is full and texture is real creamy and alcohol is not discernable. Good stuff and way better IMHO then the barrel-aged version."
"Old Heathen pours a dark chocolate with a coffee colored head. the smell to this beer is all espresso, and nut. The body is very thin with a lot of carbonation. The body is a lot like a dark dark ale, not much like a stout. in the finish you can taste a little lemon and coffee bean. Lots of malt. Great beer though i was expecting something a bit thicker in body and taste."
"Drinkability- I still have one more, so I'll have to check on that smoke flavor again. Otherwise, it's great. Rivals some of the best IRS beers I have had."
"Pours a =n almost complete black color. Just a slight hint of ruby around the edges. Thick foamy tan head, with great retention. As it eventually faded, not much lace left on the glass. Big espresso nose, along with some fruits, dark fruits. Good coffee flavor up front, citrusy hops at the end. Mild bitterness. As it warms, more chocolate flavor comes through. More fuirt flavors as well. Slightly warming from alcohol. Seems too thin, over carbonated. Other than that a decent Imperial Stout."
"Aging has added a hint of vineousity with a slight dusty paper note."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied..a bit thin actually with lots of carbonation. The abundant carbonation just doesn't work for me here and detracts from the overall experience. I'm sure I'll give this another shot in the future...but at this point I'd say to avoid this if you're looking for a good imperial stout. There are many better to choose from."
"This stuff poured like used motor oil. Barely any head and little carbonation. I had to smell it to convince myself it wasn't motor oil. The smell quickly made me realize I was not drinking motor oil. The strong burnt malt aroma is the first thing noticed followed by a nice coffee chocolate smell, umm there's some black licorice there also. The taste was just as the aroma indicated. Burnt malts, coffee and chocolate flavors and a little on the sour side maybe due to the alcohol or the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little creamy. Good drinkin but may put you in trouble quickly."
"As for drinkability, this is as close as you'll ever come to a sessionable imperial."
"The head never left on this sample. Great mouthfeel, thick and creamy without being cloying. Very, very drinkable. I could easily make this a mainstay of my lineup if only Weyerbacher would distribute into Texas. Highly recommended."
"Try Heresy, the oak-aged version of this. It's amazing, much easier on ya."
"CONCLUSION: One of the best I've had so far. This one is right up my alley. A strong imperial stout that gets the job done. Firreal"
"Poured a deep black color with nice head that quickly faded. The smell is of things dark, chocolate, coffee, toasted malt. This first taste is extremely enjoyable and makes me want more. The alcohol is well hidden. Leaves a nice taste in the mouth. This is one beer I really liked. Thanks to BA mtanji for the gift."
"One-plus inch of frothing head at start with lace like the teeth of a shark. Oozing, oil black hue that is indecipherable. Roasted oat, black strap molasses, dark brown sugar, and pine essence on nose with a cloying heat. Chewy oak and soy on taste, with an accompanying woody texture and chummy black tea. Overall a pleasant experience, but the soy astringency grates a bit."
"This beer pours a dark inky black with a thick, dense tan colored head that clumps after a few minutes and develops into a clingy lace. The nose has a lot of black licorice, chocolate, and roast malt. A bit of cherry on the finish. The taste has chocolate covered cherries and just a hint of espresso. This beer wants to develop a chemical flavor, almost burnt plastic on the finish, but I dont want to scare you. It never goes all of the way there, just close. It has a nice silky smooth mouth feel, but is a little boozy to drink much."
"Pouring into a goblet, it pours a black color leaving a tannish head with red tints about 1 finger thick that dissipates rather quickly to some nice edge lacing and a slight layer that lays on top of the brew. Vanilla tones quickly hit my brain along with either plums or grapes or even berries (some type of fruit!). Brown roasted malts also come out on aroma as well, and even a very little bit of bitter hops pop through w/ some alcohol burn. Taking the first sip, I taste mostly sour-bitter plums or even some bitter cherries (unripe). It also has a slight roasty flavor in which the finish leaves a slight almond taste in my mouth. It isn't as sweet as I expected at first, the vanilla flavor/feel is very aparent, and the alcohol burn makes my lips a little numb even! This is a very full-bodied Stout which warms the belly quite nicely; nice winter brew. The carbonation is light, and the beer is pretty creamy and enjoyable overall. Not he BEST Imperial Stout I have ever had, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Full bodied coffee flavor w/ just a hint of alcohol...it is a very drinkable brew and is just one more reason to keep my eye on Weyerbacher."
"Flavor is rich with malt characters with chocolate and brown sugar and some molasses mixing nicely for a chewy slightly sweet flavor that makes the beer similar to a rich candy in my mind. No real hop presence that I can detect. A very nice brew. Only wish the berries on the nose were in the flavor somewhere. Still great and easy to drink for 8.0%"
"This beer is definitely in the top ten of the style."
"Rather sourish stout, cushioned by malts to make it more drinkable through a smoother finish. Was OK with food, have had better in this style. Completely dark appearance. Not as roasty fragrant as many other stouts. Burnt roasts, mellow coffee, licorice."
"Overall, a pleasant and warming experience...perfect stout for wintertimes of snow and slush."
"Poured nearly jet black with a bit of ruby red tones around the edges. Had a nice tan head that lasted quite a while and left good lacing. The smell was of rich dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee. The taste was of bitter chocolate and espresso, maybe I'll call it a chocolate covered espresso bean followed by some mild hops flavors to balance it out. The mouthfeel was creamy, but not as thick as other imperial stouts, and a bit too carbonated. I would say, however, that this was a very drinkable beer. I can't wait to try the Heresy... possibly tonight."
"Pours a motor oil black color with a huge head that reminds me more of a belgian beer than an imperial stout. Currently I'm still waiting for it to recede, this is getting a bit rediculus now. Aromas are a strong mix of roasty chocolate malts with hints of burnt tones along with some coffee and just a tone of smoke. Flavors are a mix between the roasty malts and coffee tones but there's just way to much carbonation in this beer to really let these flavors shine. There are some nice chocolate tones in the mix as well and a decent bitter hop finish but the carbonation and a thin mouthfeel really takes away from what this brew could be. Overall to me this isn't anywhere near an imperial stout, and I will not be seeking this one out again..."
"Last bottle from my Big Beers mix-case, about time for a review. Pours deep, red-tinged black with a light cap of creamy brown head that leaves some lace which is gone by the time I'm finished. Dark chocolate, bitter coffee, dark and moist fruitcake, and dried fruit aromas prepare me for the first sip. Taste is dark toasted malts, lots of coffee, choc., raisens, prunes, leather, and oaky wood. Has a smokey quality not typically found in RIS's, nice. Has a velvet-smooth consistency and is a bit thin-bodied for this style. No hint of the 8% abv. Finishes with a leathery coffee flavor, different. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Would benefit from some cellaring."
"Cheers"
"$8.99 for a 6 pack of 12oz bottles"
"Pours opaquely near black with a thin light brown head. Serious roasty character with some underlying candiness like red licorice. No real hop aroma, but that's OK. Roasty flavors abound, coffee, toffee, caramel and chocolate-covered raisin, and that red licorice-like candiness oddly enough appears in the taste, too. Hop bitterness shows up in the finish, just bitterness, no real hop taste, but bitterness that complements the roastiness. Certainly better at warmer temperatures. Rather enjoyable."
"($10.99 / 6-pack)"
"A very good imperial stout... but personally, one was enough for me. This was a big roasted beer, a little extreme for my IPA-leaning tastes."
"Drinkability is pretty good, especially for an imperial stout as this is a much more subdued version than most, but still good."
"All that being said, I've had a couple of these that turned out to be real stinkers. No-headed soy sauce debacles."
"Pours out a pitch black with a tall brown head. Collapses down to a rocky surface while lacing the glass nicely. Aroma of dark chocolate with plenty of sweetness rises form the glass. Weaker notes of coffee were also present. Taste starts off with a bittersweet mix of chocolate and coffee. The flavor finishes with some earthy hops and a roasty malt. Full thick bodied brew here that coats the mouth nicely with wonderful flavor. Great drinkability to boot, with 8% alcohol this can almost pass as a sessionable Imperial Stout. Not much alcohol is detectable in the flavor of nose. Give it a shot if you havent already."
"Pours a thick, jet black with a sticky, medium brown head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and lots of sweetness. Smells ""thick"". Rich coffee, toasted malts flavors control the palate. Not as syrupy as you would think. Mouthfeel is very flavorful, but not too heavy. Really glad I got to taste this one. I wish the body was thicker and more coating, but still good. Definately worth a try if you find it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 2"" medium brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head recedes by half in 5 minutes, and lacing is great, heavy and foamy. Aroma is strongly dark malts, with a slight undercurrent of alcohol. Taste is as the nose portends, with the coffee and chocolate malts upfront, and some dark fruit and light alcohol tinges as time elapses. Mouthfeel a bit thin of the style, but still good and smooth, and drinkability is good as well."
"Motor oil black and appeared to pour with the same consistency. A very small beige ring fell slightly along the outer rim of the crude. Smelled roasted coffee and baking chocolate. The taste was about the same with a few hints of molasses to finish. Slick and chewy just like the style should be. Alcohol came on fair and didn't leave anything behind save for a bit of warmth. A decent Russian Imperial but not among my favorites, Don't get me wrong, this is a great beer, not to miss by anyone, just not one of my favorites."
"Pours a deep, ominous brown with a nice thin dark tan head. Head falls to a collar with a little lacing. Smells quite coffee-ish with hints at amaretto and cocoa. Very strong smelling, and very pleasing. Tastes very strongly of iced espresso. The taste is almost too much, not letting the other flavors shine through. Can't taste any of the alcohol though (EVIL). A little bit of a hop aftertaste, but not enough to round the brew off. The taste is extremely pleasing - but not complex enough for my preferences. Very strong, solid stout. Feels very light in the mouth, not creamy enough. And, finally, quite drinkable. Almost too drinkable being so high in alcohol, but no beer is ""too drinkable."" Recommended."
"Drinkability: Ok stuff but not the caliber I'd prefer for an imperial. I'd have it again but wouldn't seek it out."
"taste is just over the top roastiness. that's really all i could taste. there is a bit of hoppiness there, but the roastiness dominates. alcohol is fairly well hidden, actually and it's not an undrinkable disaster. i thought the flavor could use a little more sweetness to make it more distinctive and complex. it's definitely not a bad stout, but i think it's just a tad one-dimensional."
"Starts with sweet malts followed by the bitter roasted flavors. There are some more complex esters in the background, but I was lost in the alcohol warmth provided. Smooth drinking with a heavy mouthfeel. Finishes clean and dry. Although I would love to have more than a few, the high ABV will quickly catch up to you."
"Utterly pitch black and absorbant. Light bister, two fingered, steadfast, pitted head. Muddled lace remains. Upfront in aroma is a combination of buttery milk chocolate and licorice. Rounded notions of butterscotch and burnt fudge add depth. Becomes agreeably cuspate upon swirling with minty, albeit searing ethanol and citric hops arising. Very enticing aromawise. In flavor, prevalent is a bittersweet suggestion of lightly singed buttery chocolate cookie. Ashen dark fruit esters lend an impression of cocoa dusted prune, but not as pronounced as it other versions. Ethanol is well integrated, with only trace peppery hints surfacing mid palate. Despite the rich chocolate presence, this is very well attenuated for an imperial. This is not a detriment, but serves to facilitate its dangerous drinkabilty. Finishes lightly alcoholic, but otherwise with a bitter continuation of baker's chocolate. A tasty, albeit soft imperial that is well suited to drinking more than one in a sitting. A ""session"" imperial? Close enough."
"Overall: A very good Imperial Stout. Rich, creamy, full of flavor and very satisfying. A great winter warmer. Recommended!"
"Overall: I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time but a damn fine stout. I enjoyed the dryness of it. A little drier than I'm used to but a pleasant change and it works well for this beer. A good representation of the style."
"ng"
"Not as smooth as I like, but flavors are good w/ a roasted sweet malt that hits you at the beginning and is followed by a pleasant bitter finish."
"What an easy drinking imperial stout! Very enjoyable but lacks some flavor, and too much carbonation, to be put in the select imperial stout category. Easy to drink a couple of these and it would be a pleasure to do so. One of the biggest surprises of this imperial stout is the 8%abv since it is hidden so well."
"this beer is a black, opaque brew that pours with a nice head that dissipates real quick. Aroma - roasted barley, a little chocolate, alcohol on the back senses. Malty/roasty taste, a little carbonation bite. Very drinkable, goes down too smooth for an 8%'er."
"now this is my kind of imperial stout. it's more subdued than the more popular ones within the style, but that's the way i like 'em. actually, this one reminded me a bit more of an oatmeal stout than an imperial. it pours a lovely black colour, with a thick chocolate milk like head. it's not as sticky as one would imagine, but still nice. it looked like it was going to be a touch overcarbonated as well (it ultimately wasn't, really). the smell is really nice as well: sweet chocolate, roasted malt, wood, alcohol and a touch of coffee are present. this is a flavourful brew as well that doesn't slap you in the face with coffee flavour all the way through. coffee is subtle and in the back, right where it should be in my book. it starts creamy and sweet goes a bit dry and finishes with a burnt flavour. nice. alcohol is barely noticeable (if at all), so be careful here. mouthfeel was a bit thin for an imperial stout, but nothing offensive. i just would've preferred it to be a bit chunkier. this is definitely a tasty treat that i'll be happy to sample again. weyerbacher is two for two thusfar in my book. can't wait to try my third..."
"This is a great stout. Pitch black with a thin tan head. It is fairly sweet, almost like a milk stout. The high alcohol puts it in the imperial category. There is a defiinite fruitiness in the nose. Taste is chocolate, with hints of grape/raisin. The mouthfeel is very foamy and full. Goes down smoothly for an 8% ale. A definite treat."
"I really like this. Not something I would gun for every time, but a nice change of imperial pace every so often"
"Beer is good. Happy Imperial Beering."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a thick deep jet black color with two fingers of medium tan foam. There is a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of burnt malt, caramel, chocolate, and espresso. A nice smell that fills the nose. The taste is rich in roasted malt, lots of coffee, and a hint of mocha. Not too sweet though. Only a hint of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability is fairly good for an 8% brew. A damn fine Imperial Stout!"
"Poured out jet black with a small tan froth that disappears to just a lace around the glass. Smell was sweet malts, chocolate and espresso and coffee and maybe a hint of raspberry. Taste was similar sweet chocolate espresso and coffee and a bit of alcohol to give you a nice warming feeling. Very flavorful and medium bodied mouthfeel. This is very drinkable and very good stuff."
"Not a good imperial stout, and not even a good beer. Thin, lacking in body, poor mouthfeel, and unsettling off-flavors which make it difficult to drink. Down the drain she goes. Pass on this one, it's a stinker."
"Drink: A good imperial stout, if a bit young at this tasting."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick brown head. The aroma is great. It has an intense black malt scent that is accompanied by chocolate and roasted malts; very nice. The taste is good. It has a rich dark malt feel that goes down easy and finishes dry and slightly bitter. It seems that this and the raspberry imperial stout are really bitter on the finish; maybe too much black malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. I like the Weyerbacher lineup very much especially their ""big beer"" spread. This is a fine imperial stout."
"Overall, a good imperial stout."
" One of the best tasting, American imperial stouts around. This makes up in taste what it lacks in aroma. I'm going to stock up on these next time I see them."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Black as coal, totally opaque. Good carbonation. Nose is roasted malts; Starts with a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor, finishes smooth with just a bit of bitterness. You don't notice the high ABV. $2.10 for a 12oz bottle."
"Decent enough, but in the end, a bit too ""polite"" for the ""Imperial"" guard. Send this stout back to the stormtroopers!"
"12 oz bottle, with no dating. Pours BLACK, very dark tan head. Coffee and cocoa in the nose. Nice thick and heavy mouthfeel. Burnt fruit, chocolate, black malt. Alcohol obvious but nicely in the background. Hint of vanilla and fruit in a nice long and smooth finish. High quality brew. Nice warming sipper"
"Black, with a somewhat thin brown head. The impressive nose presents cocoa powder, cherry and a pleasant woodsy, oak aroma. Rich roasted malt dominates the flavor profile, with hints of fruity tartness appearing mid-palate, giving way to a dark, even burnt, espresso-like finish. Hints of alcohol are also present at the finish. With a creamy mouthfeel, this is a delicious imperial from Weyerbacher."
"This beer is thick and black. It has a thin tan head and a lot of aroma that smells of coffee, sweet chocolate, and dark fruits. The smooth body is very complex with tastes of coffee, choclate, plum, port wine, and a slight sourness. It finishes relatively dry with a taste of molasses. It would go well with a choclate dessert or as a nightcap on a cold night."
"Weyerbacher's Old Heathen is a pretty good imperial stout. It lacks the wow of the big boys (Stone, Victory, Rogue) and falls more in line with what I try to use as my imperial benchmark, Sam Smith. It's not too fancy, easy malt and choco, somewhat weak hopfeel. It pours a deep brown-black and yields a deep tan head which quickly subsides to a thin lace upon the surface of the beer. The taste of alcohol is strong for only being 8%. I would think the ABV could be increased and the overall flavor enhanced with a better blend of hops. It just lacks something the others don't. Not at all bad, but really not worth the purchase if another is available."
"First off, let me say I LOVE the aftertaste of this beer. Rich espresso, bittersweet chocolate and a nice warming effect. What I don't really like all that much is the initial taste. Its a been ""mediciney"" for lack of a better word. Its not that its a bad taste, its just odd. Alcohol is very apparent. Mouthfeel is average to thin. There are much better representations available from regional breweries such as Victory's Storm King. Still, a very drinkable beer, but chances are you'll have your choice of others if you find a place that has this."
"Another average approximation of the style by Weyerbacher. But, as always, their offerings are drinkable thanks to their moderate profiles."
"Poured with a thick head which lasted quite awhile. Aroma of cocoa and dark roasted coffee with subtle fruit notes. Body is thin for the style yet smooth. Flavors are good, roasty malt, chocolate but finishing a bit too dry in my opinion. I found the thinner body, drier finish and lack of sweetness uncharacteristic for the style. Not an exceptional Stout but a decent one. Thanks Jason for the sample."
"Something about this beer just wows me. I actually drank 3 bottles of it (on different occasions) before writing this review because I was afraid I was exaggerating my joy for it."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable despite the high alcohol. I like this beer, and wish my rating was higher, but it just doesn't fit the billing for an imperial stout to me."
"Robust, smooth, but full, acidic bite."
"Black as midnight, even when I held it to the light only a vague brown hue could be detected, the russet head of a half finger in height held reasonably well. It did dissipate in time. The subsequent lacing was spotty but evident. The nose is big and aromatic with heaps of rich roasted malts, dry coffee beans, and milk chocolate; it is a luscious nose. The aromas of hops are absent. Inviting. The palate was surprisingly watery upfront with minimal bulk until the middle, here I found a solid foundation of roasted malts, hints of coffee, very dry, minimal chocolate, which was contrary to the invitation of the aromas. The hops are somewhat noticeable but dull. The aftertaste is amazingly long; it latched onto my cheeks and never left. This is a smaller Imperial Stout or a big regular Stout. Either way I am impressed with Old Heathen. It is not very hoppy nor is it very burnt but is kind of sweet and very relaxing, especially for the style. The mouthfeel is apathetic, this is a bit of a disappointment, it lacks in sturdiness; the carbonation was moderate but manageable. I found this to be an easy drinking Imperial Stout (is that good?), I really couldnt taste the alcohol, its plenty drinkable. As a whole, I really dig this one, flaws and all. It is well worth trying. Thanks Bierman9!"
"Comments  Curses to Jason for sending this to me. Ill never be able to get the flavors out of my mind and will trade and spend foolishly trying to get another."
"12 oz bottle.Poured a dark black with a massive head that really stuck around. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is of espresso coffee, roasted malt and a slight smokiness. Taste is coffee and chocolate and lots of roasted malt. This is not an overpowering imperial, but has a very good balance. Smooth and silky with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. This is a very easy drinking beer."
"Black opeque look in the glass with a nice rich milk cocoa colored head on the pour which settles quickly to a tan sheen and lace. Nice cocoa black malt and slight berry nose. Sharp sourish plum , burnt malt, and light expresso are show the most. The feel and taste are a little lighter than you would think. Medium mouth. Dry sightly sour tongue in the finish. Overall very nice.. just a slight lightness to the brew sensed."
"It was extremely dark with a dissapointing head that faded quickly. The smell was very good, but the taste didn't follow. It wasn't bad as a stout, but compared to other Imperial Stouts it was not impressive. There was a nice dark malt taste. It is a decent beer but it just doesn't live up to this category."
"This beer was not what I was expecting at all. This seams to be one of those beers that will sneak up on you because it's very easy to drink but has very respectable ABV. It pours smooth and generates a frothy, brown head. The color is very deep redish color when held to the light but away from the light it appears black. The foam faded fast to a weather system over the beer. The first sip was very good. Had a nice bold flavor to it that was full of chocolate and coffee tones. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. As I said before, very drinkable. I tend to stay away from Weyerbacher but since recently having the Rasberry Imperial and now this beer I realize that I need to stay with the styles I like brcause these two beers are very nice beer to have on hand. I highly suggest you try if if you haven't already."
"I love Imperial Stouts so when new ones come to town, I get excited. Pours out solid black, much like oil with almost no head at all. The smell is wonderful. Coffee and chocolate with a grainy almost nutty flavor. The taste is not as nice as the smell. Solid, just no mind blowing. More coffee and some burnt notes come through. I like my imp stouts to have more of a hop backbone which this one seems to lack. More on the sweet side. A good beer that I am glad that I tried."
"A very nice brew that started with an absolutely great black color with an outstanding head and lacing. Smell was of burnt malt with some fruity elements. A hint of smokiness was also present. Taste was wine-like, with the alcohol presence overriding any sweetness. Definite hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel for a hig abv was nice. As expected, it was very dry, yet medium bodied. Very drinkable for its abv. My first offering from this brewery...I hope the others are just as good. My bottle was not plain jane....it had the silhouette of a druid? with neat stylized lettering."
"The malt is smoky and rich. Burnt toast, dark coffee, chocolate and hint of licorice flavors are all upfront. Citrusy bitterness and a faint metallic tang can are also noticed. A light warming alcohol emerges and gathers momentum as it warms. This is a hearty and flavorful Imperial stout, that doesn't over-rely on potent alcohol to be noticed."
"Absolutely outstanding."
"A slightly viscous pour results in a flagon of pitch-black liquid topped off by about half a finger of rich, khaki-colored foam of uniform, small, and dense bubbles, with not much spottiness. The head dies out to a thin film that rings the glass; cling is sparse and slightly viscous. An aroma of rich, coffeeish maltiness; twinging smoke and wood. With warmth and agitation, smells of tar and black currant emerge; perhaps plum brandy (with some imagination)? Nosefeel is pleasantly oily and alcoholic. Flavors are earthy and sooty from the get-go. An intriguing palate... after an initial big roast barley graininess, I keep thinking of inedible flavors! burnt popcorn/burnt rye toast, smoldering cedar chips, used coffee grounds; bits of sweetness in front palate and hoppiness at sides are bowled over by big smoke flavors; this has got to be a cigarette smoker's dream beer. Mouthfeel is tingly throughout with an oily body; however, considering the intensity of the flavor, the aftertaste finishes rather quickly. After a few minutes, a nice booziness takes over, so watch your speed. I used to not like this beer, but it's grown on me--I would happily have another."
"The taste is quite pronounced at cellar temperature. Lots of dark smoky notes. Almost a oak like quality to the flavor. Just like the smell the taste reveals a whole lot of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is in the medium strong body range. This is a very drinkable imperial. Just a notch or two below the big boys of the imperial stout world, but it's pretty darn good."
"Pours a deep black with a rusty head. The aroma is a roasted chocolate. The taste is a rush of chocoate and roasted malt that really hits your tastebuds. Very nice mouthfeel that leaves you wanting to take another gulp. The aftertaste is again a roasted chocolate that lasts and lasts. This is something to sit back and enjoy anytime of the year."
"A wonderful example of an Imperial Stout. Deep Black in color, an almost solid appearance in the glass. Nice little dark brown frothy head. Obvious substance to this brew. Wonderful aroma. Almost overpoweringly well balanced massive malt and hops. Very smooth taste, this one could substitute for dinner in a pinch. Easy to drink and a wonderful party in the palate. An excellent brew to try and keep around until the summer."
"Jet black beer-has a great tan head on it that reminds me of the Sam ad ""you could float a cap on it"".Like a dark version of the head on a Belgian.Nice aroma-roasty,chocolate.Roasted malt flavor up front.Hints of licorice and anise.Full mouthfeel-nice body on this one.Very nice imperial-could have several of these in a sitting.Definate must try."
"Aroma of molasses, licorice and chocolate. Fortunately the chocolate comes to the fore in the flavor and leaves a nice nice sense of the lovely malts herein. The drinkability is hampered by the 8% ABV, but it's not bad at all. Good stout in a pinch."
"Thank you, Old Heathen, and thanks to you, ManekiNeko!"
"IMHO this is a beautiful beer."
"This stuff is great, a very pleasant surprise to see this at my local farm market. Pours a thick deep dark black hue with a brownish tan head. Wonderful deep rich maltiness with alot of coffee, caramel, and chocolatey tones. A very fine imperial stout that I would recommend to anyone who can find it."
"Drinkability: I've certainly had better Imperial Stouts, but this is nonetheless a sterling example of the style. A bit anemic, maltwise, but still quite top notch."
"Still a nice beer, but just a lighter simpler Imperial Stout."
"This is pretty thin for and Imperial Stout. Poured out a midnight black with a thin tan head. Bitter roasted grains and alcohol in the aroma. Again, the body is thin and bitter with roasted grains and some chocolate. Strong alcohol is in the forefront. Theres some roasted coffee, caramel and cocoa in there. Not bad but lacking for an Imperial Stout. Maybe this is an Imperial Stout Light."
"The body is an opaque black and reveals only a thin glint of mahogany at the base of the glass. The thin lid of creamy dark tan foam drops quickly to a razor thin surface covering and it leaves little more than spotty lace. The nose offers toasted chocolate; a berry-like yeasty fruitiness; and some alcohol. The body is medium-full, and it's silky smooth in the mouth with a low-level, very fine and natural carbonation from bottle conditioning that gently caresses the tongue. The flavor delivers a dark malt with a bittersweet chocolate character and a soft, roasted edge backed by a bold bitterness and some drying alcohol in the finish. Some floral and grassy hops rest under the surface don't don't really show themselves unless you seek them out."
"Pours a pitch black with no head to speak of,aroma is softly sweet and I also got a light peppermint aroma (Iam glad Iam not the only one who got that).Taste is lightly chocolaty with an alcolic sweetness to it kinda hard to explain,the alcohol is very prevelant there is a nice earthiness in the finish as well.A real nice complex Imperial Stout here a nice one to savor.The big beers from Weyerbacher are very good I have to say."
"Another reason for me to be unimpressed with Weyerbacher."
"Pours a black color with a light brown thin head. The head receded to the rim of the glass rather quickly. The aroma is of roasted malts, coffee, and alcohol. The flavor followed the sniff test, with tons of roasted malts and coffee, but chocolate and licorice flavors were also strong. Very full bodied imperial stout, and the alcohol is quite noticeable. The carbonation is very mild, making this a bit syrupy on the tongue. There is a slight dryness in the aftertaste. This is one to sip on a cold evening if you want to feel some warmth."
"The finish was grapefruit and espresso. All the flavors tended towards bitter and tart, no sweetness, and, for all the different flavors, didn't seem very complex. I recently had a Stone Imperial Stout, and if I had had the Old Heathen after that, it definitely would have scored lower. No comparison..."
"summary: Fruity Imperial Stout, with too much fizz and a high price. There are way better brews out there. If you like imperial stouts, try a bottle before you pick up a sixer at this price."
"Thanks goes out to Pabobcat for the bottle!"
"Drinkablitity is fairly good. I could have this as a session beer however there are more beers I would rather have. Alcohol doesn't show itself much either."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice Imperial. I have been impressed with Weyerbacher's big beers. Not quite up to Rogue or Samuel Smith, but this offering shouldn't be missed."
"Pours a gorgeous pitch black that is completely opaque, under a reddish-brown 1.5-finger head that is well contoured and lingers all the way to the bottom of the glass. Surprisingly, not much lace. The nose is full of roasty sweetness. The mouth is very (VERY) carbonated, and heavy with just a touch of sourness. There's a good roasty malt opening, with burnt hops in the background. A bit of plum and cherry complement the hoppy bitterness. The finish is nice and hoppy, while the aftertaste is pleasant in its roasted smokiness. This brew lacks the depth and complexity of the best stouts, but is certainly good enough to drink."
"Overall: Very nice. Lovely roasted malt Stout with hints of bitter-sweet chocolate in the finish that adds to the pleasure."
"Black as the pits of hell. Creamed coffee head, with roasted malt and toffee, espresso notes all over the place! Amazing depth and complexity on the palate. Roasted malt, dark fruity esters, alcohol and mocha are evident. Hops balance this somewhat nicely considering the depth of the roasted presence. Nice carbonation level makes going down easy. Warming all the way down with a semi dry, crisp finish. This is a big winner!"
"Old Heathen is a dark, thick, black beer with a thin, creamy head. Aroma is nutty and malty, but not a complex as I'd hoped. Also, not quite as much alcohol in the nose as I'd expected for the style. Taste is quite good: roasted grains, chocolate, walnut, (peanut???), and bitter hops. It's drier than other examples of the style. Heavy, substantial mouthfeel, but not quite to the degree of other imperials. Very good, solid beer...but not outstanding."
"Decided I couldn't wait any longer to crack open this beauty. Thanks to Kluk for slugging this a long ways. Right then. Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a quickly dissipating fizzy brown head. I was hoping for a little more retention, oh well. Smell is right up my alley--rum, whiskey, alcohol, and plum flavored cotton candy. If only all heathens smelled this good. Taste is also good. Alcohol-soaked smoky malts dominate, with notes of overripe fruit and an unexpected bitterness (almost astringent?). Finish is bitter, and I have to say that this is less sweet than most imp. stouts I've had. Mouthfeel is also a little thin. Still good, but not great."
"Man, talk about bang for your buck, this is a great deal. Pours a nice dark black, tan head which could have stayed a little bit longer but hey no ones perfect (except maybe storm king). Taste; this beer is very complex, a lot of spices and fruits can be detected, plum, chocolate, chicory, and maybe a little anise not sure on that one though. The mouth feel was nice could have been a bit creamier, it almost had the feel of a dry stout, but it was still good. I will be buying this one again."
"This is one bad mama jama! I haven't had an Imperial in quite sometime, but my last one was the Storm King(which was unbeatable), so I still had some rememberances of Imperials of old. This one had a pretty head and a very dark color. The smell was very aromatic, with hints of plums, nuts, and maybe even a hint of chocolate. The taste was similar, but the plum taste was strong. I like it and it's fairly cheap, so I'm sure I'll get it again."
"Thanks to francisweizen for this one."
"After a hard days work I reached into my beer fridge and pulled out this beauty. It poured out of the bottle like dark black motor oil. It produced a compact, but short lived, light brown head. I was immediately bombarded with the aroma of chocolate, toffee and roasted malt. The taste was bittersweet chocolate, malt and candied fruit with some mildly discernable hops in the background. Once again I was reminded of cocoa-toffee with a hint of coffee-dark roast. The alcohol and malt flavor were well balanced and made this a very drinkable beer. It helped sooth the nerves after a rough day. I highly recommend it. My only issue was that I had only one. Time to restock the fridge . . ."
"This beer helped me forget how much the red sox suck. Poured a pitch black with a dark brown head that dissapeared into some lace around the edge. Couldn't really see what was going on inside the glass as it was dark. Smell was huge sweetened chocolate rounded off with dark mollassas and curants with a pretty distinct alcohol punch in the nose. Taste was sweet, sweet, sweet with tons more malt and a cloying caramel taste and a dry astringent finish akin to sugar that was attempted to be caramelized but got burnt. Plenty of carbonation made it feel amost like I was sipping on a coke if the serious alcohol presence had not continued to remind me otherwise. A decent stab at the style, but I could have done with the sweetness being taken down about 10 notches and maybe a more distinct hop profile and some more bitter malts as well. Probably not worth the money I paid for it, but interesting none the less."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: Pours a nice thick dark borwn with a medium dark beige head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, coffee and oats. The body is not as big and bold as I like in an Imperial Stout but it is still good. Basically all the things I love about the flavor of this style - Roasty malt, caramel, alcohol, chocolate and coffee - are all here but in less quantity than the greats like Dark Lord, Siberian Night Rasputin and Stone. The finish is a little hoppier than those too. This beer is on the verge of being an excellent example of the style. A little more richness and complexity and it will be there."
"-F"
"A very solid, well balanced beer, lots of coffee and chocolate and roasty malts, as you would expect, quite subtle, which i liked, nice balance and decent mouthfeel, with nice bitterness. This was the last one of the night (long night of tasting), and it still stood up very nicely overall. Very nice stout."
"Oil colored with very little head. Flavor and aroma is balanced between sweet chocolates and almost a toffee like quality. Any notion of roasted malts is hidden far behind all other tastes. Oil like in mouthfeel as well. No real carbonation--just a heavy body that sits in the stomach and warms it. Can be drinkable on an empty stomach. Wasn't so for me. Did not sit well with a stomach full of gnocchi."
"It pours nicely black, with a really good head for an imperial, but it fades quickly. It has this intriguing grayish cast to it. Alcohol hits the nose first quickly followed by the imperial fruitiness (for some reason the fruitiness a lot of imperials have and that I'm so fond of reminds me of cooked cherries and apples). Charcoal, coffee. Mild sourness. The flavor is too thin to be top notch."
"Appearance is completely opaque with a very thin tan moccha head. One monster of darkness this beer looks great and very appetizing. Aroma is slighlty smokey with layers of plum, raisins, and mild hints of deep toasted malts, very nice imperial going on here. Creamy smooth milky goodness, what an amazing beer the flavor brings those hints of plum and other fruits and they coexist very nicely with the mild toasted malt profile. Everything is done right here in the flavor category. Fuller bodied creamy texture, awesome fullness to it. Is actually a great easy drinking beer for the style that masks the high abv quite nicely."
"This beer poured black as night and formed a nice medium tan foamy head that left laticed lace as it subsided. A nice aroma of malt, coffee, plums and cherries. A flavor of malt, coffee and dark chocolate. The finish was a touch light for this style, but overall, a nice imperial."
"Pours pitch black with a thin head the color of wet sand, which fades to a thin ring of foam. . There is a slight reddish cast to the edge of the beer as the light passes through. The aroma is fruity, with plums and chocolate covered cherries, followed by a shot of espresso. The taste is very complex. It open with a cherry-mocha milkshake note, then reveals much more dark chocolates and a stronger java component. All this is finished off by decent hop bitterness. Then, the dark chocolate and coffee flavors reappear in the aftertaste, with bits of cherry sticking to your teeth. Alternating sweetness and bitterness continue throughout the glass. Fruitiness is replaced by darker, bitter flavors. And then the opposite happens. The mouthfeel is very pleasing, as it maintains enough deftness to not become burdensome on the palate, yet is full enough to make you want to chew it a bit, or to simply run your tongue around your mouth after you swallow to catch any clinging bits that remain. The drinakbility is also very good. This must be an underrated Imperial Stout. Its from my home state, and although I admire the brewery and have seen this beer around, I had not tried it until WilliamPhilaPA sent me this sample. Thank you very much! This is really a great beer that should be on the short list for Imperial Stout lovers."
"A good amount of hops balance a subtle malt and alcohol presence. Hearty dark chocolate flavors make this beer a dessert in itself. The only thing I was a tad displeased was the body...it seemed very very thin. Could use a fuller, richer texture and this baby would be primo. If thats the only bad point, then this indeed is a damn good beer."
"Nice and rich pretty full body with a silky creaminess. Lots of chocolate in the flavor, but the roasty characteristics are a lot better than out of the aroma. Hops come in pretty strong at the end to round out a marvelous complexity. I got a little taste of alcohol on a few gulps, but it was nothing that hurt the flavor at all. I am very happy with this brew, and it is only missing a few things to near perfection. I would like a stronger aroma with more hop presence."
"Bought this as part of Weyerbacher's ""Big Beers"" sampler case. It wasn't outstanding compared to others in its category. Poured very dark... darker than a black steers tuckus on a moonless prairy night. Sweet, malty, smoky, with a tart aftertaste (not my thing). Hops are very subtle but they're there. This is not a bad beer, but it definitely ain't no Storm King."
"Pours an intensely deep brown/black with a smallish brown head that sinks to a light film that leaves little lace. Complex malty aroma with some nice chocolate cake, plums, and slight roasted odors as well. Dark roasted malt opens up the complex flavors on the tongue as a bit of a chocolatey sensation follows it onto the tongue. Rich chocolatey flavors become more prominent along with some dark fruitiness with plums and other flavors. The brew finishes with a smooth bittersweet finish with rich chocolate undertones. Slightly thin in the body department, this brew is still very smooth and nicely drinkable. The slight bitter aspects of the roasted malts keep it fairly clean on the tongue. A very good beer overall that I would certainly recommend to my fellow ba's."
"Not really the best Imperial Stout I've ever had, but it's a good effort nonetheless. Pours out a dark, dark brown - well ok, black. A small head formed but left rather quickly leaving no sign that it was even there. Nice nose with aromas of coffee and chocolate predominating. Moderately sweet on the tongue with some slight hop bitterness in the finish contributing to a well balanced brew. Flavors of roasted, chocolate, and black patent malt are present and take command lending notes of chocolate, coffee, and liquorice. Hop flavors are also apparent and bestow notes of earth and a peculiar hop twang. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy with a medium body. I just don't know, I was slightly put off by some strange and funky flavors that I just couldn't put a finger on."
"Pours with a quick mocha tan head that resides upon jet-black opaque liquid. LOTS of coffee in the nose...kinda crowds everything else out of the running. Taste is bittersweet chocolate and intensely roasted malted grains, very nice notes of coffee come back again, followed by subtle alcoholic notes and a none-too-strong but present hoppiness. Finishes long, dry and burnt...very tasty! Superbly crafted, a recommended Imperial Stout."
"When poured into the glass it was dark brown to black in color. But when held to the light some gets through and you see some dark red peaking through. The head was creamy and slightly thick that was tan/beige in color. It lasted a good way to the bottom, but did not really produce a lace, which surprised me. The aroma was of roasted coffee, chocolate, malt, raisins and slight hops. The taste was a little sweet in the beginning. It had hints of malt, coffee, chocolate covered raisins and at the end some hops peaked through. The looks and taste of the beer were good, just not a thick as I would have liked for this type of beer."
"Very rich, brown head and black beer underneath. If your licky you can catch a glimpse of its red highlights. It smelled of a typical well made imperial stout, very rich, ripe fruit, toasted grains, some alcohol, and coffee. Very pleasant tasting beer. Time has treated this beer well. Though it never was harsh in any way, the year in the bottle mellowed this brew significantly. Charcoal bitterness was reduced to a mild astringency. Flavors of raisins, chocolate, and toast were discernable. Very mellow imp. stout similar in aggressiveness to Sam Smith. My only complaint was this mellowing also applied to the finish. The finish was very short. About 15 seconds after swallowing there was virtually no lingering anything! THis is not good for a style of beer meant for savoring. THis one was too quaffable. Still, cellaring was kind to this beer in terms of flavor."
"Although my favorite style at this time is ""Belgian Strong Ales", I was first turned to the ""Dark Side"" by Porters and Stouts"". The pour ebony in color, magnificent and monsterous chocolate brown head, with oodles of lace to coat the glass. Nose is coffeeish, bitter sweet chocolate, roasted grains, and somewhat sweet. Front is malt sweet, the top full, rich, creamy, complex, the finish is forcefully hopped, robustly acidic. The high 8.2% abv, is certainly felt in the dry, slightly bitter aftertaste, and that pleasant ""Warming"" of the ""Tummy"". A must try for stout lovers, and those turned to the dark side."
"Almost pitch black, but not quite (some light gets through the edges of the glass, displaying a deep red, almost brown hue). Tan head, but not much of one (could have been my pour, though). Rich aromas of burnt raisins and currants, faint espresso, and some tobacco. Some subtle tropical fruits in there as well? Anyway, it smells quite nice. Taste is a bit more subtle than the smell, especially if the brew is cold. Let this one warm up a bit. Once it does, there are some really nice chocolate notes, dark fruits (burnt dates and figs), with an espresso finish. Moderately high carbonation (for the style) makes for an interesting sensation on the tongue. Finish is espresso bitter. Alcohol is barely perceptible in the taste, which could be dangerous. Overall, this is a really nice beer."
"264"
"Thanks to Davo for landing this sample for me."
"Midnight black pour. Big bubbly tan head settles into a nice half-inch ring. Good lace trails.  Chocolate, coffee, alcohol and hops in nose. Same in taste. Good balance. Maybe a little thin for an imperial in the mouth. Probably suffers by comparison with stablemates (the Idiot) and neighbors (Storm King)."
"Appearance: Pours a an almost jet black, with a tiny bit of a reddish hue in there. Little creamy tan head floats for a while...then diminishes. The body is a bit on the thin side. On the nose there are aromas of burnt raisins and espresso. On the palate there are light chocolate notes, caramel, some burnt dark fruit, and espresso flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth. A very good Imperial Stout..."
"Used engine oil black with a nice frothy tan head and cascading effect. Ripe plum and the tartness of nectarine in the fruity nose, roasted grain develops a bit more in the aroma also. Silky smooth with undertones of espresso that bring a range of roasted flavours, hops are a tag-a-long as well as a dark ripe fruitiness. Alcohol is slightly deceiving, all in all a great Imp Stout."
"Extremely rich and full bodied with a warming alcoholic punch. Finishes with expresso and chocolate."
"Notes: A top-notch Imperial Stout. I liked this one a hell of a lot. Very rich and complex to the point that I found myself getting lost. Oh, and extremely warming at 8.2%abv. Definitely a head numb'er."
