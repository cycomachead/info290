"One of the best Stouts in Ohio!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a massive beer in aroma, flavor and feel.  Could use a touch of sweetness to counteract the bitter notes, especially on the aftertaste.  Overall though, an excellent brew."
""
"Begins with bready, coffee infused malts, which got a biscuity hint to them. This gets accompanied by both, soft cream and ashy tobacco. Then a sweet note of glazed toffee, fudge and molasses gets mixed with the bready flavors, while fluffy cream is still providing a smooth mouthfeel. The finish then is defined by coffee and warming caramel, standing in perfect balance to each other, while the beer seems to be quite aggressivly hopped, as a recognizable dryness appears from the coffee, providing a gentle bitterness. Concludes with an interessting aftertaste, formed my cream and earthy, slightly slick coffee."
"A chunk of dark, bitter chocolate crashes across the tongue with bold notes of oak bark, fusel alcohol, plum, black cherry and resin"
"O:  this is a phenomenal beer with fantastic flavors and great complexity.  the age on this bottle has done it well as the beer is smooth and very well rounded.  A fantastic drinking experience to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer, shows why it gets so much praise."
""
""
""
""
"Solid stout. 2103 vintage. Look is awesome, very little head in this beer. Fantastic flavor."
""
"Utterly delicious!  One great imperial stout!  One of the best!"
""
"Overall it's a nice experience. More like peace then war."
""
""
""
"Taste - Wow - this is really nice.  The smoke really comes through here.  Very toasty.  A little bitter, which would definitely go away with some age.  Overall very nice.  Great offering from Hoppin' Frog."
"O: This is a very good beer though for me the bitterness is a bit overwhelming. If the bitter notes were toned down a bit it would likely be 4.5s across the board"

"Unremarkable. Thick and heavy, but lacks any intensity of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Oh man.  Great choice for another rating landmark.  Review #1100 will be memorable and enjoyed.  Might have to get another bottle to age in the pantry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  This stout is big, but super drinkable.  The booze is extremely well hidden on nose and palate."
"O - A very solid stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was good, but i wanted more of the salty dark roast and chocolate from the smell in the taste. Strong, hoppy, tasty, easy to drink for a ""Destroyer", until it gets quite a bit boozy."

"Pours ink black with a much deeper than mocha colored head,brown sugar and char with a but load of earthy hops with become resiny in the ""burps"".Well crafted and the alcohol is big but doesn't punch you in the face."
""
""
""
"Although the alcohol can be neither smelled nor tasted, its presence is instantly noted in stomach warming. This beer has an above average appearance and aroma, but the flavor is a slight let down; the chocolate and coffee flavors are quickly diminished."

"Mouthfeel is super thick with low carbonation leading to this coating the mouth with loads of booze, and charred woody bitterness."
""
"Overall: I'm going to chalk up the taste to either a quirk of my palate, or else a result of any mishandling/incorrect storage that may have gone on before the bottle made it into my hands. Everything else about this beer attests to the skill of the brewer. It's also worth pointing out that I've recently discovered I really don't care for most non-BA American stouts, so even with the off taste I got, this one compares favorably against that cohort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - No idea what is causing that terrible flavor, but it makes it undrinkable. They way I'd imagine rust would taste."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great brew, however, I will say, I prefer Boris over Doris. I had Boris first and wanted to give Doris a try. While it's good, I feel as if they tried to make it better than Boris, and in my opinion, wasn't successful. Still a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich well-balanced flavor (although not quite as rich as the extreme Prairie Pirate Noir consumed beforehand). Bitter/sweet ratio kept in balance. Some coffee, especially in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 2011 or 2012, Decent, a touch oxidized."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an intense black color with no head except for a few bubbles that stick to the side of the glass. The aroma is fresh hops, dark chocolate brownies and some lightly roasted coffee super intriguing. Bright and clean hops blend seamlessly with a dark toasty chocolate taste. The mouth feel is smooth as silk. The hops linger in my mouth but with moderate bitterness that plays well on the sweet notes of chocolate and mocha. Amazingly dank stout, lip smacking good."

"Overall: A massive one, good counterbalance with hops to the big dark malt character full of deep roast. Can't wait to get my hands on the barrel-aged one."
""
""
"This is one of my favorite stouts ever. Possibly the best stout out there. At least as far as what's available to me. Simply amazing. Near perfect stout."
"Overall, very good. Perhaps too sweet but still very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn tasty, smooth, rich, drinkable imperial stout. If I'm being picky, the cough syrup can become slightly cloying as it warms, and it could use a more substantial head for presentation purposes, but those are fairly minor grievances. Stout lovers won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have tried the two BORIS brews and DORIS and overall I like DORIS the best. It is very similar to Expedition Stout..."
"Nice mouthfeel, undoubtedly a very full bodied beer with a nice lingering flavor. Very smooth with a modest carbonation level, but enough. The 10.5% is detectable, but not overwhelming at all. DORIS is a nice sipper and is sweet while having appropriate bitterness. I have to say I've had this beer with various ages on it and they are all delicious. This is a very drinkable beer that I would recommend sharing with friends, but a bomber could by consumed by a beer lover on their own. It has all the intangibles of any great RIS. Another great beer by Hoppin Frog."

"Overall falls a bit short for me on the smell, taste and feel but I bet the barrel aged version is outstanding adding a whole new layer of depth. There isn't anything wrong with this aggressive brew but just a bit too bold on the hops and deep malt versus the Boris oatmeal and ba."

"O - Very tasty RIS!"
"Poured from bottle into crooked stave tulip. I think its a 2012 since I got it a year ago (December 2012). Looks like motor oil when poured, but it does have a quick brown 1 finger head that lasts like 10 seconds...brown lacing remains. Huuge roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and dried fruit aroma but its very crisp. Taste is bitter sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts with a somewhat high hop character - especially for an older bottle. Its slightly oxidized raison flavor is really nice. Its very dry, viscous, thick, oily, and heavy - but strangely drinkable. Well worth having this brew...its pretty fantastic."
""
""

"This bottle had aged in my cellar for a year so I may have to try a fresh bottle to get a full look at what this beer is like. This particular bottle though was excellent. The pour into the glass was thick and black. The smell was of huge malts, chocolate and dark fruits. I assume a fresh bottle would have more roasted malt and hop presence but I don't know that for sure. The taste was incredibly tasteful and complex. If this beer was this good a year in, it seems to me that it would be a great candidate for aging. Hoppin' Frog beers sometimes seem a little too pricey for me but after having this offering tonight, I am starting to think that the price is worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – 4.75 – Great beer. Very similar to Bell's Expedition stout. Less available and probably not as good of a deal though. Not worth the 18.99 price tag if you can get expedition instead."
"This stout is top notch, full of flavor and just just plain tasty."

"O: Crazy freaking good. Would NEVER turn this down. So many good things here."
""
""
""
""
"O: D.O.R.I.S. is a solid imperial stout that would be stronger yet with subtraction of the licorice note in the flavor. The rest of the beer is excellent but like most of HF's lineup, overpriced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reading back through my review, I feel like I'm slamming this beer. But it's actually not that bad. It's just that, for a big imperial stout, it's not all that good. Overly sweet and undercarbonated. And I like sweetness and low carbonation. So there you have it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black with a light brown foam. In the nose, roasted malt and booze. In the taste, roasted malt, coffee and alcohol. The booze isn't over done, but this brew ain't afraid to show you what day it is. Full bodied, smooth medium carbonation and somewhat creamy. Overall, this is a big ol bastard you can grow to love."
"D.O.R.I.S. has always been a favorite of mine. This is a perfect example of what Hoppin' Frog is capable of. Absolutely worth checking out. It has a nice complexity to it. Well done."
"O - first time trying something from this brewery, and it's really solid."
"Bottom line: a good stout but there are year rounds I would take over this"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good imperial stout, but not one of the best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Doris is a fantastic RIS and the best Hoppin Frog beer I have had to date. I can't wait to grab another bottle or two!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste matches up to the smell. Big chocolate notes upon first sipping it. You can taste some of the alcohol sitting in your throat as well. Overall, this is a big powerful beer. I opened this alone, which means I'll most likely stick to one glass but I would recommend sharing with a friend. Perfect for those cold winter nights, not so much in the warmer weather. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Very nice beer, probably good i waited a year, I bet it was hot younger"
"Get heavy notes of fish and an almost sardine aftertaste which mostly ruins a good nose. The flavor is good on the front end with heavy smoke. The initial poor the head has a reddish tone which I found strange. Not worth the price tag and a little disappointing from an otherwise top notch brewery."
""
""
""
"O - This is the second time I've had this, but my first full bomber. I am so impressed by this stout, it's amazing. With the proliferation of the craft beer market, and the stout style , this is a hard o e to compete with. I give this as close to a 5/5 as it can get...without actually given it one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I preferred BORIS to this, just too boozy and too much dark fruit going on, overly sweet and not complex enough."
""
""
""

"Great sweet stout, plenty to like. Even on the hottest day of the year (which it was)."

"Pours thick, smooth, and very black with dark brown head which fades into an awesome light whisp atop the beer. Aromas are smoked meat, dark chocolate, wood, cream, roasted malt, booze, and hops. This beer completely makes loves to your palate...silky, supple, and soft. Amazing and sexy. Flavors dark chocolate liquor, bittersweet chocolate, smoke and wood. Hops and booze. A touch of sour at the end. Very well made, very delicious."
"Poured into a snifter, black allowing no light through with a dense brown head, leaves a slight oily lacing. Aroma is boozy, sweet and roasty with dark fruit and floral notes. Gets sweeter and boozier as it warms. Upfront it tastes very sweet, boozy, dried cherries followed by lingering roasty/coffee flavors with dark chocolate, burnt sugars, toffee, and herbal/citrus notes. Gets sweeter as it warms and the roast flavors mellow a bit. Medium viscous, coating mouthfeel but not as heavy as some other RIS. Overall a solid RIS, the roast can be a little astringent at times, especially when cold. Very good and should age well, some oxidation and time to mellow should do the brew well. Will definitely drink this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a dark tan head. In the aroma, roasty malt and a sweeter coffee presence. In the taste, a sweet roasty malt with a nice coffee presence. A smooth and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee malt, with notes of sweetness in the aftertaste. Big coffee notes, quite smooth and very nice."

"The reveal… DORIS Imperial Stout from Hoppin’ Frog. Well done covering all the caps with electrical tape, because I might have guessed had I seen that red cap. I revealed this before I read Brez’s guess above, or that too might have stimulated me to a correct guess! I've got no idea if this is aged, Hoppin’ Frog doesn’t have any freshness info according to Fresh Beer Only. I've had BORIS before, but not DORIS so I can’t say for sure myself. Either way, thanks for the opportunity to try it, Abraxel! Very tasty."
""
"O: This is a really, really enjoyable beer. it developes as it warms and goes down smooth. bursting at the seems with huge flavors that balance each other out really well. As complex as it is its mellow and provides a perfect sipper. /93"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really fantastic Russian Imperial."
""
""
""
"Overall, I found this to be a well-made, balanced, and enjoyable full-bodied imperial stout."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer pours a thick, viscous, jet black coloring with a thin, foamy, dark brown head that quickly settles out on the surface. Aromas of biscuit, dark baker's chocolate, coffee, toasted grains, a hint of smoke, and some earthy/woody tones. Booze hints on the nose, also. Flavors are extremely rich, with a base of dark, bitter baker's chocolate and a hint of bitter, roasted coffee. Ribbons of earthy and woody tones throughout, with a vanilla and molasses highlight, also. Very reach and smoothly blended. There is some bitter hopping that cleans the palate nicely at the end, which is an impressive feat given how rich and robust everything is. Roasted grain highlights show through every once in a while, too, which also helps to balance the rich and dark flavors. The aftertaste is rich chocolate and molasses, with a touch of smoke and bitter hops. Slick, smooth finish with a rich, robust linger that coats the palate and the mouth. Very strong, but surprisingly drinkable. This beer definitely opens up as it warms. Wow."

"I don't drink many DIS as it takes me forever to drink. This is a great brew that is good to share."
""
"Thanks Joel!"

"22oz bottle. Pour looks like used motor oil with a half inch of dark brown head that dissipates rapidly. Minimal lacing. The aroma is very sweet with lots of oatmeal, vanilla and dark chocolate. Hints of earth and coffee. The taste is sweet dark chocolate with some roasted malts and burnt coffee. Notes of vanilla and sweet oatmeal but this beer is mostly dark, dark chocolate and roasted malts. Sweet but not overly so. Boozey and rich. Silky but heavy mouthfeel. Slow sipper all the way, best paired with a glass of water. Overall, this is a big, rich stout that may be a bit overpriced but is still very good."
""
"To the Point: a very pleasing Double Imperial Stout; a great sipper"
""
""
""
"A very strong stout with some interesting flavors. Another winner from Hoppin Frong"
""
""
"this beer was ok nothing that I will seek out again as it tended to be too smokey for me"

"M - Smooth, creaminess, but some excessive alcohol hotness (-)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured bomber into 34oz mug. Darkest pour I have ever seen, jet black with a thick, dense dark brown head that doesn't go anywhere, leaving lots of lacing. Smells of chocolate, bourbon, sweet malt and coffee. Taste is bitter baking chocolate, some bourbon sweetness in the middle, and ending with a coffee bitter aftertaste that swing in way late, rounding out nicely. Insanely delicious, with one of the fullest mouthfeels I've had. This is definitely a ""double oatmeal RIS"". This is now one of my favorite stouts. Incredibly well-done!"

"Overall. A really nice big stout that seems perfect with this age on it. I'd like to try a fresh one, but doubt it's going to be better than this with a stronger hops presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this brew. Balanced and brought all the aspects you would look for in an imperial stout. I've put off trying this one for a while but am glad I got around to it."
""
""
"An impressive beer, and one that I think would probably benefit from some additional aging in the keg or bottle."
"O - Really impressed. The hops added in the finish was an excellent addition to the already super B.O.R.I.S. Very impressed with Hoppin Frog. highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, D.O.R.I.S. is not very feminine like her name suggests, she is one mean bitch with a lot of punch (I mean that in a good way). Overall, I drank this one fresh and really enjoyed it. I would be interested to see how this baby ages as well. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice stout. I might have missed the boat on freshness, but I wanted to see what this originally hoppy stout would become."
"O - a decent brew. I had BORIS when I first got into craft and I didn't like it very much, but now I'll have to revisit it, since it appears to be better than DORIS. It's a little pricey for what it is, but it might be worth putting away for a year or two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours thickly like burnt-up used motor oil black with a quarter inch of rich mocha foam, looks delicious. Smell is roasted malt, dark chocolates, caramel and trace vanilla. Taste is similar with heavily roasted malt and a semi-sweet chocolate presence then subtle vanilla, oak, grass, figs, oatmeal and caramel adding complexity. Creamy luxurious mouthfeel with a nice carbonation. Finish is figs, chocolate and roasted malt, lightly sweet but overall very clean with bitterness from chocolate. ABV well hidden. Delicious, flavors continue to develop as it warms."
"This beer gets more flavorful as it warms. Great mouth feel and rather easy to drink."
"Overall I think this is a pretty good RIS, but leaves something to be desired. Nice big body and roasted flavors, but maybe too much char. So good but not amazing."
""
"O: This is a really heavy RIS with strong, strong roasted malt character. I wouldn't mind a little more oatmeal smoothing it out further but it's still viscous and creamy. Overall it's pretty mellow, no super sharp flavors. Just plain decadent and heavy, like slightly watered down brownie batter. Some barrel-aging to cut the thickness and lend more complexity would probably make this beer absolutely amazing. I wonder if this beer fresh would have a stronger hop character that would help break up all the heavy roasted malt."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good, pretty drinkable for such a large stout. I like that the roastiness and even the lasting hops allow it to maintain a sensibility of earthy bitterness and not become sickly sweet. Hoppin' Frog does a lot of beers very well, and this one is no exception to their practice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. I agree that Hoppin' Frog is often well deserving of its criticism of overcharging, but I bought this one for between $10-11 and it was worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- delicious beer. BORIS is great, but DORIS might be a slight above, especially with a little age on it"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I've been drinking beer for a long time and taking notes on what I drink. There is literally no beer that I've tasted that I want to drink less than this beer. Perhaps it's because I don't ike port? does everyone else that reviewed this like port? Honestly, I'm just confused as to the high ratings. I like Imperial Stouts, but not this one."
""
""
"Pours thick and black black black. Amazingly almost no head at all, only a couple black swamp like bubbles. Smell is dark and roasty. Bread, chocolate, woody, and smokey on the nose . Thick as it comes, mouthfeel is great, you can chew on this one.. Pretty hoppy for a DIS, nice sweet undertones but very powerful stout. Leaves a slightly tobacco flavored after taste. Great beer to split with a friend, pretty intense but malt/hop balance is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very impressed with this beer, as good as any RIS out there, I really liked the added hop character although it's not for everyone, I would definitely recommend beer lovers try this at least once if given the opportunity"
""
"Dark brown-black pour into a snifter, topped with a small, dense layer of creamy mocha head. This is how I like my stouts to look. Lots of roast in the nose, dark malts, coffee, cocoa, woody booze notes, herbal and earthy hops. More roastiness in the taste, dark malts, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, an underlying charred wood quality, and a definite hop bitterness that lingered to the end. I'm not a big fan of noticeable hoppiness in big stouts, but it wasn't too bad here...maybe comparable to Storm King. Nearly full-bodied, hop bitterness prevents it from being too smooth, but overall, it's quite good."

"This pours a pitch black color with a medium brown head of foam. The scent is rather mild but still is rich and robust with roasted malts, coffee, and hazelnuts. The taste is thick, rich and creamy. This heavy texture stout delivers an initial bold, sweet flavor with its variety of malts. The taste is super complex and delicious. I can only imagine what this must taste like bourbon barrel aged as it already rivals the flavor of bourbon barrel stout. It finishes with a chalky, coffee after taste. Simply a must try!"
""
""
"O: We opened this after a BORIS of similar age, and we all agreed that the BORIS was much better. All of BORIS was consumed, whereas half of DORIS was still left. Not a bad beer, but she is outclassed by her younger brother."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is heavy and viscous with carbonation being on the lower end. Very nice mouthfeel for the style. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer that aged nicely. The rich dark chocolate was really good and the bold roasted, slightly smoky malts that came out more in the taste were also really good. I thought it was a great version of the style and one of the better non-barrel aged versions of the style I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: I had this at a tasting a year ago and thought it was tasty. Having this bottle I may have to change my mind on that one. I like the look and the feel but the most important aspects are average at best."
""
""
"O - A solid representation of this style. It would be excellent with a dessert. I will definitely purchase this again."
"O - It's a sweeter stout than I care for but still good in its own right."
""
""
""
""
"D: this is a big time boozy brew but not totally unrestrained. gets smoother as the sips progress. however, i would suggest giving this some more time in the bottle. also, since having both i would have to say im more of a fan of DORIS little brother, BORIS."
""
""
""
""
"A rich and delicious imperial stout. This one begs for a piece of chocolate cake."
"So much malt, so much everything. It was a struggle to drink half the bottle and I felt like crap afterward. So very heavy and sweet and decadent. Sits heavy. Split with a bunch of friends. Dessert beer for a week."
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious, complete, flavorful imperial stout."
"O: Very solid flavors throughout. The booze lingers a little much and leaves a little too much sweetness. There is some deep roasted malts that counter this in the finish, but the booze seems to stick around even after that."
""
""
""
"O: I must admit I enjoy regular B.O.R.I.S. slightly more, and the barrel-aged variant a great deal more. Still, a formidable brew that's both tasty and makes me feel funny."
""
"Overall- World class stout that has lots of complex smells and flavors."
"Very amazing brew! Im sad I haven't tried it sooner. Amazing roasted grain notes. Nice coffee that envelopes the whole experience. Nice cocoa sweetness with some slight dark cocoa bitterness. Overall. Extremely delicious and well balanced RIS."
""
"This one pours like motor oil with a nice brown head. Smell is of strong dark chocolate, big roasted grain. Some roastiness going on in there, definite chocolate notes, bitter clean crisp finish from the hop presence. The right amount of carbonation that balances out the sweetness but keeps things plenty thick. Goes down surprisingly easy for a big stout. Hoppin’ Frog is getting closer and closer to my heart. This is similar to the BORIS, but with a big more heft and roast on the palate. Can't wait to try the BA version."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating(but I bought this in Spring 2011). Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of alcohol legs. Aromas of big dark chocolate, char, roasted malt, toffee, caramel, coffee, molasses, herbal, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance, complexity, and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, char, toast, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; with nearly zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Very rich and robust. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian Imperial stout. Very rich and robust with nice complexity and balance of flavors; quite smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable to sip on slowly."
""
"Overall these guys at Hoppin Frog just crush it on stouts. I think there's no question I prefer the regular BORIS and kill for the Bourbon BORIS, but this is great. For drinking though this feels more dessert forward and needs a pairing than solo I think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable imperial stout, much the same as B.O.R.I.S. was, but, in this case, a bit bigger/more full. Not amazing, but quite good. Definitely a slow sipper though the alcohol doesn't really factor in for me, just a big, full bodied stout."

"O- i feel if this was brewery released with a lottery drawing facilitating the bottle allotment, people would be raving about doris. That said, it's an amazing ris"
"I enjoyed it for the 3 hours i drank the bomber."
""
""
""
"Overall this was enjoyable. Very complex brew. This is a difficult brew for me to find, but I will definitely pick up more when I see it."
"A fantastic stout, Hoppin' Frog should consider giving this a barrel treatment...it could be something special as well."
"O - Extremely well done and $13 for a bomber. This must be some sort of joke. Not sure how it ages and I don't care. It is great fresh and I will buy some more tomorrow."
"O: Such a nice beer; boozy and peppery and chocolatey and delicious"
"O- I wasn't a fan of BORIS (poor palate?) But I wanted to give Hoppin Frog another chance. They really did redeem themselves with this one. I'm really glad this is readily available in Buffalo now."
""
"a solid imperial stout. i enjoyed this more than boris for sure. if this seen extended time in a bourbon barrel i think it could really be magical."

"O- This really is a phenomenal Impy Stout. With the unbelievably smooth chocolate and roast flavor and literally no alcohol present, i would put this up there with celebs like Dark Lord. No joke. Seek it out."
""

"O: Overall a very smooth and silky dark roasted treat with a well concealed abv%. Very nice and easy drinkability, great complexity, transition of flavor from start to finish and a silty smooth bitterness. Keeps getting better and better to the bitter end."
""
""
""
"O: There is some interesting complexity to this beer but it is not the easiest to drink. The flavors are extremely rich but it is a sipping beer."

"O: This beer is rather intense but is something that is nice to sip and savor."

"O: Wow, I'm impressed. It's sweet, smooth and delicious. Absolutely a must try."

"this is a monster. pours dark chocolate like herseys syrup, some serious viscosity here. thick as honey, with almost no head. smells like alcohol and coffee, tempered by dark dark malts and flaked oats. flavor is heavy on the coffee, also a little sweet like burnt sugar. bready grains, oatmealy. they oats still manage to find a place amongst all the heavy hitters in here. mouthfeel is just wild, maybe the thickest sludgiest beer ive ever seen, impossibly full bodied, its heavy in my glass even, just dense. almost no carbonatio, this is quite strange. like something id expect to see from mikkeller. this was my first hoppin frog beer but it wont be my last, it was an ambitious undertaking on their part, and i think its executed quite well. not a beer for everyone, but if you like these colossal stouts, this is your horse, or should i say frog?"
"Damned fine Imp Stout that reminds me of a more viscous Yeti. I thought BORIS was missing something...don't feel the same way about this one."

"originally reviewed: 03-31-2011"

"The mouthfeel was creamy and rich. Smooth and full bodied. Adequate carbonation. All around delicious."
"O - Drinks like a chocolate covered hop. Simply delicious."
""
""
"Pours a thick, dark black color with a small, dark brown head. Scent is a blast of chocolatey cocoa and some dark chocolate. Hints of vanilla and roasted malt. A bit of brown sugar. Taste is initially a lovely fresh coffee flavor with some lovely chocolate flavors. Not too bitter. Nice vanilla flavor and a bit of brown sugar. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is very high for the ABV...easy drinking. Overall, this is a great RIS. Thanks Bruce for sharing this one!"
"O: ABV is hidden fairly well. Not quite as good as BORIS, but still pretty damn good."
"O - Just delicious. Really almost a dessert beer. As with the BORIS, I could still wish for a little more complexity, a couple other things happening at the same time, but the richness of it is a feat of its own. And this one adds that woody element even though it's not barrel aged, so that's an extra thing happening. Unexpected, and I wasn't entirely sure I wanted it in there, but it does add another facet and gives it a signature, which is good if you're looking for something unique. I like this and would like to drink it again. At $15 it will probably not be soon."
"I like how it leaves you with bitter coffee and chocolate notes late, and they seem to stick around. Normally, I start getting this chewy malt thing really late in the beer, but not here. All bitterness all the way."
""
"Think Stone when going for this quality at a lower price point. Nevertheless, DORIS is a Hoppin' Frog true-to-style example for the Ohio locals to enjoy."
""
""
""
"DORIS might be my favorite stout from Hoppin Frog."
"DORIS is another outstanding stout from Hoppin' Frog. I probably won't buy this gain, but only because I prefer BORIS and Barrel-aged BORIS to DORIS. Still, fans of big, roasty stouts (and who isn't one?) should seek this one out, especially if they like bitter RISs."

"O - This is a really tasty DIPA. I may have to buy some more of this one soon."
""
"This was an excellent RIS so much flavor and well balanced. I would definitely look for this again."
""
"The dark brown body was opaque, and was topped by the darkest head I have ever seen in any beer. Smelling the beer revealed coffee, toffee, and lots of hops. The taste was not at aggressive at the beginning of the sip as the smell suggested. It started off as a sweet creamy coffee with vanilla, and then evolved into a very bitter chocolate. There was a some lactic acid sourness in the middle. The aftertaste was long, and very roasty. The body was oily, no doubt due to the addition of oats, and the feel was very soft and silky with no hint of harshness. This was a very good upgrade to B.O.R.I.S. Keep it coming Hoppin' Frog."
"Full bodied and chewy with below average carbonation. There is a good amount of alcohol heat in the aftertaste. Overall a good beer, but not as good as B.O.R.I.S. the Crusher, due to the alcohol heat, and too much dark roasted malt for my liking."
""
""
"Chewy, viscous mouthfeel with a really complex flavor profile. Deeply roasted dark malt flavor without becoming burnt or acrid with a decent amount of sweetness and a surprising hop component. Slightly smokey with hints of roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, burnt toast and oatmeal followed by some lactic cream. The hop characteristic is really interesting providing some nice bitterness that compliments the dark malts and a resinous pine flavor adding another level of flavor. Really complex and well balanced with an ABV that is excellently masked, making this beer dangerously drinkable."
""
""
"O: What a stout, what a beer, what an experience. I couldn’t imagine loving char in a bottle, but this is it, and I love it. Not quite sure if I’d prefer this over BA B.O.R.I.S.; only way to find out is to do a side-by-side, I guess. What a tough life…"
"I wish I could remember who sent me this, as a thank you is definitely in order!"
""
"cheers."
"O: another great beer! I have been on a roll lately, just loving all the RIS and imperial IPAs I've been drinking - this beer is no exception - jeez - I gotta say, this was a super smooth, very satisfying, just sweet enough, but not too sweet, with a hint of dryness and a real nice roasted malt character. Get it."
"O - very delicious veyr smooth, very filling beer, one of my new favourite stouts"
"M: As syrupy as they come. No carb. Slightly dry backend. Boozy warmth throughout."
""
""
"A good beer that lacks balance."
""
""
"Pours like motor oil, black with extremely dark brown highlights. A near-brown one finger head tops this brew but quickly dissipates to form a ring surrounding the inside of the glass. A strong aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, grain, with chocolate and toffee notes rises from the darkness in the glass. Dark fruit dominates the taste up front which gives way to roasted malt with some bitterness, finally finishes fairly smooth with chocolate and toffee notes. Heavy syrupy body which coats the mouth, low carbonation. Really fantastic RIS. Very balanced and very complex. Hoppin Frog sure knows how to put together some darn good stouts. Highly recommended."
"O: Good to very good RIS, a lot going on with this beer, I'm glad I got another one and that Hoppin' Frog is in WI now"
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking pour into a tulip - black with brown highlights and a short lived beige head. This is one sticky sweet beer though. There is a sheen, almost oily, left in the glass. Not lacing...Nice. Thick coating mouthfeel. Taste is what I would expect from a stout of this caliber. Not a huge coffee or chocolate presence, more of a malty roastedness. Aroma is not terribly fragrent, but the mouthfeel is good and coating. This was gone before I knew it. Alcohol is well hidden. Quite nice and a good value. I would buy this again. Nothing extreme or remarkable, but all round very good."
""
"Overall, very good russian imperial stout. I love the thickness and the sweetness, it really balances out the roasted malt flavor and helps cut the alcohol a bit. I like a little more sweetness in an imperial stout but this is still a very good beer."
""
""
"O- This is a pretty awesome RIS, thick and decadent with a good balance of char and sweetness, definitely give this one a try."
"O: This is a very well-crafted beer. From the way it looks, to the way it smells, to the taste, to how the mouth just loves it, it’s a great play by the brewery. I’m beyond happy that I was able to pick up two of these at the beer store; I just wish they’d had more, as I would have snagged a case if I could. If you’re a lover of stouts, do yourself a favor and pick this one up; I promise you won’t be disappointed."
""
"Overall: A heavy, sticky, wonderful, unique, slow-sipping DIS. Imperial Stout lovers should add this to their “must try” list. A nice, slow sipper for the cold winter months. I would seek this one out again and try aging it a year or so in the basement. Very well done Hoppin Frog…"
"Poured a super-thick, oily balck color with very minimal dark tan head. A pretty mild aroma, but it's full of burnt/dark sugars that give you the hint of richness. Absolutely smooth and delightful in taste. Hints of coffee/chocolate, but mostly heavy/dark sugars take over. Amazingly, the ABV is well hidden within the beer. The thick nature of the brew keeps on the tongue for a while. Excellent drink ."
"O - Overall, this was a very, very good beer from Hoppin' Frog. I liked this much better than BORIS."
"I feel that this one should be shared. The body is huge, and the taste is extremely bold."
""
""
"Poured from bomber into a snifter. A - Pour is dark and forms a thin mocha head which quickly dissipates. S - Chocolate, roasted malt and coffee with a nice boozy note. Some minor hops shining through. T - A nice mix of the usual chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt with a nice alcohol bite. Some bitterness from the hops, but overpowered by the above qualities. M - Smooth and creamy with a light carbonation. A great stout."
""
"D - Taste is not as good as BORIS but still solid."
"2011 gold cap poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Bought this bottle in October and have been sitting on it for a bit. B.O.R.I.S. was enjoyable, let's see how this one goes. Appearance is jet black with a nice light brown head, minimal, but present. Smell is big on coffee and chocolate, I also get a lot more booze in the nose (at 10.5%, I would think so.) Not sure if this is supposed to have the same oatmeal character as B.O.R.I.S. but I get a hint of it. BIG chocolate in the taste, more so than the coffee. Robust, thick, and full, I'm into it. Mouthfeel is syrupy, thick, and all around what I would expect from a big stout such as this. Overall, it's a great imperial, not sure if a whole bottle to myself is the best idea, it's rather filling. I'd say it was worth the $14 I paid for it. If you're able to obtain Hoppin' Frog brews like this, go for it."
"Great mouthfeel. Creamy, heavier, lower carbonation, nearly perfect for a huge stout."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a super dark brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with black chocolate and some green dry hops notes. Taste is dominated by intense notes of roasted malt with some dry black chocolate and some light coffee notes. There is also some green hops notes which I am not sure really brings anything more to this beer. Body is full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting, intense but I really could do without the hops profile in this one."
""
""
"O - Not bad. Prefer BORIS."
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this brew and look forward to picking up some more before I make the same mistake I made last year by not buying more than a bottle before its gone. the $13 price doesn't make it a everyday beer for me, but I am fortunate enough to be able to try it just for the sake of tying it and boy am I happy I did. I love this brew and have to say this is the first hoppin frog brew I tried and I am very happy with it."
"Mouthfeel: This feels like an almost perfect 10.5% stout thick and rather sticky it clings to the tongue well into the next sip. Doris is a fine representation of a double imperial stout, definitely Boris’s bigger sister."
""
"Feels very smooth in the front, there is a light alcohol bump at the back of the throat as it goes down."

"Overall I was a little worried because some reviews make it overly bitter, but I don't find that to be true.  It's smooth and yummy."

"Alcohol is certainly present in the nose, but roasted malt is also present. The taste is strong malt with some traces of coffee to go along. There is plenty of alcohol in the finish - it does not quite get unpleasant, but it is on the border."
""
"O: This was tasty, but not great. Pretty drinkable for how big a beer this is. Wouldn't turn it down if it was offered, probably wouldn't seek it out again, however."
""
""
"O - This brew needs some age on it to mellow out the harsh notes. I'm setting the other bottle aside for a year to see how it fares. This is worth drinking but it is not at the very top of my list for Russian Imperial Stouts; at least until it ages."
""
""
"Overall I like this beer as an imperial stout, however I have had better. Compared to my favorites it is a little bit too coffeeish. But it is still a great beer."
""
"This is a full bodied brew with a smooth, creamy feel to the mouth. It has a modest and enjoyable level of carbonation. Very good feel about this brew and well made across the board. This is worth checking out if you haven't already."
""
"After all that, Highly Recommended!"
""
"Overall - A good brew, but it all felt a tad bit muted to me. Perhaps with some more age it would mellow out a bit. The complexities are there, but just not shining through."
""
""
""
""
"Right now this beer is a bitter mess to me. It has IPA levels of bitterness from both hops and roasted malts, but right now is not balanced. It seems at though all of the elements are there, but they are both overwhelmed by bitterness and lack the complexion of some better imperial stouts I've had."
"It seems to pair well with mint chocolate candies as there's a nice interplay with the mint, gin-like alcohols, and citrusy-grassy hops. The chocolate on chocolate complements are obvious."
""
"O: This is better than almost any other RIS I've ever had. It's not barrel aged nor does it have crazy ingredients, but it is textbook RIS. Amazing."

"O:Awesome, buy one (or 5) of these if they are availible in your area."

"Pours black with the thinnest cap of brown head. Absolutely no light passes through this. Smells like dark chocolate syrup. On first sip the mouthfeel stunned me! Probably the thickest i have come across in my eight Years of legal drinking. Flavors include dark chocolate, nutty oats, and roasted malt so roasty that it adds bitterness! Mouthfeel as I said earlier is smoothly slick and coating. This is really drinkable due to a slight sweetness. I love it."
"A sweet chocolate goddess with a laurel of hops. Pours like hot tar or molasses. Pitch black. No head. Floral aroma. A special beer. I was honestly scared to drink a tall glass of liquid that trapped all light that entered the glass. I've never tried anything looked like it. However the taste is complex, not overpowering, well balanced, and unexpected subtleties exist. A rich and excellent beer."
""
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel giant tulip, very aggressively. Pours a amazing black, no light penetration at all, with a 4 inch sticky dark mocha head, that settles into a film of bubbles, with some lacing. Smell dark chocolate and roasted strong coffee, wow! Taste just about blows you away with what your nose hinted too, you realize that this is a special stout. Mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Large, but not over the top. Great life for it's abv and not overly dry. Easy drinking, but you wonder if it is higher in abv even if alcohol taste isn't present. This is one of the best beers that has touched my lips, truly a gem."

"4.0 D: I enjoyed this beer, but I prefer fresh BORIS by a long margin. That said, this can probably age like a champ. I think if I wait long enough, the hoppiness will subside and I'll like this a lot more. I'm going to get a couple for the cellar for sure. Whatever the case, Hoppin' Frog knows how to make stouts."

"O: Good"
"O- One massive stout to be sure. A touch too boozy for my preference but a year or two in the cellar should help to mellow that out a bit."
"O: I like this. I haven't had BORIS in awhile, but I think I like this one just a little bit better."
"overall: Very nice. Impressed by the Hoppin line-up so far."
"O: Overall, fantastic. It's too bad that this is a limited release, because it's awesome. Very much delicious."
"Full-bodied with a very slick and oily feel on the palate. Thin astringency left on the palate. Reminiscent of a dark-roasted, black coffee. Much more substantial and flavorful than BORIS, for sure. A relatively inexpensive, yet great-tasting stout that is worth the buy."
" B.O.R.I.S. Its got everything im lookin for in a stout."
"Very enjoyable beer, reminiscent to Expedition Stout with the rich chocolate notes and the pleasant hop flavor. DORIS is one to sip and enjoy, you are not going to drink it fast but it is rather easy to drink. There are better Imperial Stouts out there but this is one worth checking out."
"D = overall this is phenomenal. A bit bigger and bolder than the BORIS, this is one of my top two or three Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Pours that dark, viscous, almost black I think anyone would want in an imperial stout. Pour produces a big (for the style) brown sugar colored head that diss ages quickly leaving really no lacing at all. Nose is lots of dark malt, some dark fruits, chocolate and a surprising amount of hops. Taste mirrors the nose, dark malts up front followed by a nice finish of dark chocolate with a hint of hops. Full bodied with a sticky finish that's nice and not cloying. A great representation that does some things better than the standard."
"This is a great beer. I'm glad I have a few more bottles of this amazingness to have for years to come."
"D - Seems to me like a little something is missing from this one that holds it back from being truly great... Standard appearance and good flavor, but the nose is a bit underwhelming and the mouthfeel is a bit off... Not a bad stout by any means, but there are many better RIS to seek out..."
"Overall its a good RIS. Didnt wow me but its a lot better than some other stouts out there."
"I wasnt really blown away by this guy. I liked its little brother BORIS better. The flavors and aromas just came up imbalanced to me."
"Pours black as night. Small brown head. Nose is amazing. I can smell it from a couple feet away from the glass. Loads of chocolate and malt. Smells huge. Taste is very dark chocolate forward, followed by malts, nothing very extraordinary here, but very nicely flavored. Mouthfeel, believe it or not, I feel is too light. I thought this would be heavier, and thicker. It is easy to drink, and creamy. I wonder what it would be if Ohio didn't have that stupid ABV law. Not a trace of alcohol in this at all until I stand up. Overall, this is very very good. The flavor lingers in my mouth for a long long time. My tongue feels coated with the beer. I've wanted a bottle of this for a long time, and it did not disappoint."
"O: A wonderfully rich and chocolaty beer. I really enjoyed my bottle of this one and wouldn’t mind having another for the cellar."
"This is a fine imperial stout."
"O: Love this beer. Although it's not the most amazing RIS I've ever had, it's definitely worth getting and it's extrememly easy to drink. If you see it, get it."
"Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice beer."
"Overall: A bit roastier, a bit more bitter, a bit heavier, and a bit more alcohol. I'm sure it cost a bit more, too. Which, at first, sounded like a good idea, but, deep down, I think I would've been happier with just the BORIS. Maybe I'm just getting old."
"Overall, a good RIS but I prefer B.O.R.I.S. (top 3 RIS for me). Maybe I'd have a different opinion with some age on it. It sucks that they don't date their bottles. I rolled the dice that it already had some age on it but it didn't. Not available here in TX - got from Ummagum in a shipment. Rotation - would like to try an known aged one. [O;O]"
"This pours deep black and the viscosity of this is seen during the pour. A quick dissolving tan head leaves quickly. Smells is bursting of alcohol, chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Some sweetness as well. This has a huge flavor profile. Lots of malts as well as chocolate and coffee. The taste leaves a coating on the palate. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. Overall this is a really complex and good tasting. The thickness is almost too much but very glad I picked this one up. It will age forever."
"Awesome, rich sipper."
"O: Solid, but not spectacular"
"D - A fine offering from this brewery."
"D.O.R.I.S. the Destroyer infuckingdeed! What a GREAT stout! Found this at the Devon Whole Foods, and wiped 'em out of all they had. Boy am I glad I did. This is an instant favorite. Poured aggressively at room temperature into my trusty Guinness pint glass. This could easily be shared by many, but fuck everyone else, this one's mine. This pouted blackhole black. This fucker was perfectly opaque. The head was the darkest I've ever seen. I got a good 4"" of head at the top of the pint glass so I could get the best aromatics possible. This screams dessert beer. However, I've put down dessert long before dinner was done on many occasions. This will only ensure that trend continues. This is smooth as silk. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but I like that, especially since this one has a decent alcohol presence. I could sip or pound this. Very versatile. Strangely, I have a bottle of B.O.R.I.S, but I went this route first. I'm waiting for my Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S. to arrive so I can line all three up for a comparison. This is a must have for any stout fanatic. I found these for about $9 a bottle. I've heard talk about this being high priced, and I might be in the minority, but I disagree. I find a lot of value in this one. Cheers, mofo's."
"I have been very conscious about my waistline lately and for that reason was extremely hesitant about committing to such a strong, rich beer, despite my craving for one on this humid summer afternoon. But for every one of those flavours listed above, I feel a little extra cushioning in the mid-section (or a little extra jogging) is a fair price to pay for such delight."
"Overall, good, but not worth the hefty price tag."
"Hopping Frog continues to impress with their mastery of all things stoutish. I would for them to really explore the boundaries of this style and wow us with versions of stouts never dreamt of. If anyone can do it, these blokes can."
"Overall a great beer, maybe almost too great as you can only handle the intense flavors for so long before you palate is totally fatigued. Still, what a beer. Hoppin Frog makes some great stuff, I just wish they were a bit more reasonable price wise."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark chocolate milk colored head that fades to an oily cap. Random small spots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet dark chocolate, slight coffee, and some cinnamon. I really like the aromas coming off this beer. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and alcohol. There is a roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS that I think is about on par with B.O.R.I.S. I am glad I got to try this one."
"Poured into a tulip glass from a bottle. It's motor oil black with just a little more liquidity to it. A fast pour creates a pinky finger of dark brown with a reddish tint of head, but quickly fades. The aroma is immediate and strong - roasted chocolate and coffee smells and tastes, slightly sweet but more bitter chocolate at the tail end of the sip. hides the 10% ABV very well, and is very tasty."
"Poured a black color with a large frothy brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted chocolate, caramel and alcohol aroma. Heavy bittersweet toasted black malt flavor with a heavy bittersweet and small alcohol bite finish of long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is a standout beer."
"O: My favorite out of the B.O.R.I.S, BA B.O.R.I.S, D.O.R.I.S group. I love the over the top characteristics. It makes it fun to drink and experience. A beer that I need to come back to very, very soon!"
"D - I could slow drink this all night. The ABV is high so you cant have too many but damn this is a good one."
"O- The very smooth rich, inky black malt is supported by some nice malt qualities and the alcohol adds some good support."
"mouthfeel: goes in syrupy and smooth then quickly begins depriving your mouth of moisture. in the end the mouth is dry and the chest is warm."
"O- A very big beer and good to sip on. A very good RIS well-balanaced and great composition"
"This beer is great! I'd put it up against Abyss, Darklord, Speedway, Expedition or Breakfast stouts any day. It may be named DORIS, but it's a stud. Put this beer in a bourbon barrel for a year and it might be the greatest stout ever!"
"Poured into my bruery snifter. Dark black with one of the darkest 1 finger heads I've ever seen. Great lacing, thick and syrupy in the best way possible. Aroma of chocolate, dark fruits, hops and alcohol. Taste follows the nose, wow so smooth and hides the alcohol really well. Coffee,chocolate and hops, finishes very chocolaty. Great different tasting stout, while still keeping traditional RIS notes."
"Cheers..."
"Hmm a double imperial stout, sounds interesting. Pours a solid black and a very vigorous pour produced a reasonable khaki head that slowly receded. Aromas of dark roasted malts, a non descript hop character, and hints of coffee, chocolate and licorice. Not overly exciting on the aroma side. Taste is mouth-coatingly thick and sweet. Chocolate, coffee, and molasses jump out of the gate right away. Dark fruit steps up midway through. Charred coffee, a bit of ash, a touch of alcohol and hop bitterness linger on the palette long after each sip. Insanely thick body with a creamy motor oil mouth coating. Light level of carbonation. I enjoyed the hell out of this one but then again I do love me a big thick stout. If these weren't so expensive I would drink these all the time."
"Sharing a bottle with Goblinmunkey7. This is a bottle from the same vintage that I reviewed nearly 2 years go. Yes, it has mellowed. But it's still ridiculous. Not as absurd as some other beers (I'm looking at you, Marshal Zhukov), but it's still like drinking blended chocolate cake. Score unchanged."
"Cheers!"
"The CPJ"
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, a bit dry from the hops and lingering on the tongue. This drinks nicely, the hop presence was unexpected but welcome, and I thought the booze was pretty well masked. Not necessarily worth the price tag but a solid imp stout."
"Overall: Average RIS"
"O: Overall, a good imperial stout. A bit sweeter than I prefer and not really worth the price, but still an overall good beer."
"O: Almost exactly what I'd expect from a quadruple stout (2x double/imperial stout). Thick, heavy, robust, and very much over the top. DORIS is definitely a sipper and one that I could see myself enjoying from time to time. This one could use a bit more age though."
"A more than full body and moderate carbonation this beer is definitely thick but not sticky. Definitely a sipper, this beer reminds you that it is 10.5% ABV and is only slightly sticky."
"Mouthfeel is a full bodied onslaught of malt, chewy texutre slow bubbled carbonation pushing the body along. Overall wow factor is exponential but man I love their Silk Porter run through fresh coffee beans just as well. One of the biggest stouts I've come across to date, I will always love the Hoppin' Frog dark offerings including BORIS, BA aged BORIS, and DORIS."
"Overall - Strong....Not something to drink all the time. Sip and enjoy. Maybe a little to much for some but it is a imperial stout so. Slighty out of balance with the bitterness that the hops bring but other then that, quite the treat."
"Overall a good imperial stout but a bit out of balance on the bitter side. Also a bit harsh in terms of alcohol. BORIS is the better of the two."
"D: This is definitely more aggressive than the BA BORIS I reviewed, but I think it is equally as good. There is more of an alcohol flavor to it but it's not overwhelming. Hoppin' Frog stouts are becoming a favorite of mine."
"I like it, but its not amazing. I expected pretty much what I got. Tasty, aggressive, and in need of work. There are worse examples, but not too many that I've encountered as of yet. Worth the tick, never again."
"I really enjoy this stout. Overall, it may not be as solid as B.O.R.I.S., but it is really good. (After trying a bottle that was aged for a few extra months, it was much better. I revised the ratings a bit to reflect how good this was.)"
"O- I think I'll give the edge to Boris. I like this beer, but again the usually Hoppin Frog price tags keeps me away."
"D - Pretty well balanced for a beer this big, but despite its robust flavor it just isn't all that interesting. There is an earthy intensity to the aroma that is a combination of chocolate and wet dirt that is quite interesting. The roast malt and chocolate work well together in the flavor, but they never do much to create complexity. It is drinkable, but it never develops the depth of flavor that I would expect from such a beer. This is not the worst thing I have had from hopping frog, but it reinforces my dim view of the brewery."
"Very nice imperial stout overall, with the hops bringing balance and interest. Impressively drinkable considering the abv."
"O- Overall this is a good, thick, hoppy stout. The finish comes a little strong and can be a little harsh as this one is huge and full of character."
"O - This is a very well crafted double imperial oatmeal stout. It definately gets more complex as it warms up. I just wish Hoppin' Frog distrubuted to Las Vegas so I could have this one more often, but alas, I will definately enjoy this one. If I could, I would buy more, so a big thanks again to Ne0m00re for letting me expierence a great brew!"
"Overall, a very nice beer, toasty and bitter - my favorite types of RIS's. A reduction in the quantity of oats may reduce the overly slick mouthfeel. Hope they barrel age some of this like they do BORIS."
"Not really what I wanted to drink right now, but a crazy badass imperial stout."
"T: I wanted to like this one a lot, but there just wasn't as much to it as I was hoping. There is a ton of coffee/dark chocolate bitterness and a lot of coffee acidity that leaves a bitter aftertaste. As it warmed, the flavors sweetened up a bit, but there still wasn't a great depth to this one."
"overall D.O.R.I.S. is a tasty, enjoyable RIS and certainly worth a try (especially if you like B.O.R.I.S., which i enjoyed a lot more), however there are many better, less pricey options out there."
"Overall - Really fantastic, glad I was able to pick this up. Now need to finally get around to BORIS."
"Pours black with tinges of burgandy, thin brown lacing of a head that quickly dissipates. Smell is coffee, chocolate, oak, yeast, more coffee, slight dark fruitiness. Taste is coffee, chocolate, roasty bitterness, prunes and figs, slight oak. Mouthfeel is a tad on the thin side, but helps in the drinkability department. Carbonation is medium high which helps the drinking, but probably is what scrubs away the silky mouthfeel. Pretty good stout, but IMHO doesn't touch my local fave- the Abyss."
"Overall, a nice imperial stout. It's big, but not over the top. It's a little too much charry bitterness and black licorice for me. I think I liked the regular BORIS a bit better (both are better than the barrel aged IMO), but it would be fun to do a side by side."
"Pours a jet black color with a nominal tan head. Aromas of coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate and hops. Full bodied, with flavors of earthy hops, dark chocolate and roasted malt. Excellent."
"D - A sipper, but one that I would have night after night (never 2 in the same sitting!). Great beer"
"O: A 'big boy' beer, but one that is very well crafted and edges toward perfection a couple seasons past its release. Among the top RISs I've enjoyed, one I REALLY wish was available heer on the West Coast. With its creaminess and subtle alcohol, as well as its rich/complex flavor, the drinkability is about as high as one can go for the style."
"M - Nice, slightly thick. Smooth."
"Most of the HF brews I have tried don't even come close to justifying their cost. At $15.99 a bomber, this one doesn't either but it is a quality beer. I just would never pay that much for this beer again. It was nice to try, but there are too many other RIS that are just as good or better for less $$$$. If you like this style and have the extra $$$ to spend, give this one a shot. But if your budgets a bit tight, opt for something else that is cheaper and just as good or better."
"Aroma is strong and smoky with tones of unsweet chocolate and quality coffee, along with more than a hint of anchovies. It pours - woo-wee, utterly black with a thick, dark tan, fine-bubbled head that hangs around - there's no way they could improve on that, Dixie Darlin'! Flavor is WOW! Semi-sweet chocolate, quality roast coffee, hints of molasses and miso, even a touch of hops and a smidgen of anchovies. Hey, I like anchovies. Texture is fizzy, oily and thick, leaving a nice heavy mocha finish. This one is just a shade or two off perfection - at least in my book. OK, I'm prejudiced in favor of stouts and porters, but that's just the way I iz."
"MF- A good body, but I would've expected a little more after the look of the beer and the small head. Not thin, but just slightly lacking for what I thought it would be after seeing it poured."
"D - I could slow drink this all night. The ABV is high so you cant have too many but damn this is a good one."
"Poured into Snifter, Black & Viscous, with a small brown head that recedes quickly. Aromas of rich roasted malt and huge amounts of dark chocolate, molasses, with a small bit of alcohol. Taste is of dark chocolate with Sweet malty molasses. Sweeter on the front, slightly bitter on the finish. One of the fullest bodied beers I have ever had. Low carbonation but it fits well. A nice hoppy balance is noticeable when it warms. A small bit of alcohol burning with the finish, but well hidden overall. Very creamy and delicious. Hoppin Frog ROCKS."
"Serving type: bottle"
"In all fairness, I will buy two more and cellar each for 2-3 years to compare and update my review if it mellows nicely."
"D: Drinkable beer. A very nice beer. Although I think this would have benefitted from BBA (which I don't always advise) and a good year on the shelves in 12oz bottles. That would have made this beer great."
"Still thankful to have tried it."
"Drink- I want more. It was bold, big and easy to drink for such a high ABV"
"mouthfeel is alright. this beer honestly isn't worth the 10.99 i paid for the bomber. there's other beers in the same style for the same price that i think are alot better. worth a shot, but this isn't something i'll be returning too."
"D-very drinkable and a nice addition to the festivitiex"
"Pours a thick dark viscus with rddish tints. Not much head at all. Coats the glass. Smells hoppy and malty. Dry on the nose with some slight bitterness from the roasted malts. Tastes dry and bitter. A good amount of roasted malt and roast. The hops meld well into the malt profile. Not too overpowering but a nice addition. This one drinks really nicely!"
"m/d - smooth and silky while still being thick and chewy. this is a beer that you want to let sit in your mouth for your taste buds to mingle with. leaves a liquor-like after tingle. much thinner than BORIS and much less meaty, but really nice. really smooth. great great great beer."
"I poured from a bomber and it was split equally into to standard pint glasse. The pour was very much like pouring used motor oil, very thick and very dark, it has a thin little tan head that fades quickly. It has plenty of bitter sweet dark chocolate on the nose. The first sip is all dark chocolate. It also has mild coffee and dark fruit notes, it has enought hops to keep it from being overly sweet. The mouth feel is really aided by how viscous this one is, very full mouth feel. I liked DORIS. IMO better than BORIS, really glad I picked this one up."
"The first thing that stands out is the color. Black as tar and exceptionally thick with the darkest brown head I have ever seen. Smells of wood and alcohol. The taste starts with hops and bittersweet chocolate, a wallop of hop bitterness, hint of sweet, then a burnt finish. It's past roasted into burnt, and normally that wouldn't work, but it really does. A bit of alcohol late in the finish. A lot of RISs I have had feature some sweet currant flavors rather prominently, but this doesn't. The most surprising taste really is the burnt finish, but I'm digging it."
"M/D- Nice full mouthfeel from the high finishing gravity. There's no alcohol burn but a lingering sweetness and burnt popcorn flavor. I'll be finishing this within the first half of the Super Bowl, so I'd count that as good drinkability."
"The alcohol is present without taking away from the overall character. Aftertaste is full of roasted malts and pine resin from the hops. Delicious!"
"Overall- Fantastic beer, one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had. Highly recomended."
"Overall impression: The booziness is pretty unfortunate, as this seems very close to being a nice beer. I suspect some cellar time would treat it kindly; if I run into another one, I'll tuck it away for a couple of years to see what happens."
"This was a very slow drinking bottle split between myself and my brother over Christmas 2010. Didn't really have a hop presence, but I sat on this one for about 8 months. From my experience, it may be the slightly acidic coffee that left people thinking they were tasting citrusy hops."
"D - Great for such a humongous beer. Full flavored, easy drinking and quite complex, this sipper almost turns into a guzzler as it warms. Yum!"
"Drinkability: This is a very sticky sipper. The 10.5% ABV is definitely present, but the flavors in this beer are so well done, that it's tough to not constantly have the glass at your lips. I'm sure that one bomber will be plenty, but I'm also sad that the one bomber is all that I have. I would highly recommend this beer, and I'd highly recommend laying it down for 8+ months too."
"I enjoyed this. While not overly complex, this was still bold, brassy, and most importantly, well balanced between all that sweetness, roast, and hops. This is a nice counterpart to the B.O.R.I.S. and while I don't think that this is quite as good as that beer is; it still definitely holds it own with a lot of the more hoppy Imperial Stouts out there."
"This is a modestly drinkable beer. The first is easy but the ABV and havoc that it plays in your mouth leaves little room for more than one, as you don't taste. Still, very good."
"Decent brew, but there are better examples of the style in my opinion."
"After having DORIS, I do wish I had tried BORIS first as this is (to my limited experience) a beer pushing an extreme within the already extreme imperial stout style. Do not take this beer lightly; this is the kind of beer that the labels slapped on Arrogant Bastard and such really apply to."
"This is one unbelievable beer."
"D - a little too much alcohol feel and you MUST be in the mood for chocolate."
"Overall: A nice RIS, though heavier on the molasses than I prefer. Still, I can appreciate its quality. Was nice to try this next to Boris."
"Hoppin' Frog D.O.R.I.S. The Destroyer Double Imperial Stout is bigger than B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher Oatmeal Imperial Stout, but it isn't better. For my money, the bourbon barrel-aged version of the latter blows them both out of the water."
"Edit: I re-took notes on BORIS during the tasting and had rated it a 4.25 both times I reviewed it, and gave this a 4.20 so I guess BORIS wins, but I would love to have either again."
"Some notes of chocolate, some coffee, minimal oats, and a lot of hops and alcohol heat. It feels somewhere between a black IPA and an overhopped stout, with citric and piney notes that just do not blend very well, and then the alcohol heat keeps on coming. I was disappointed."
"Amazing legs on this beer - clung to the glass like fine liquor. A touch syrupy, with gigantic roasted malt, redolent of coffee and bitter chocolate. Alchol is warming, leaning a bit toward hot. A very big RIS, and it might benefit from just a little age."
"Pours a jet black with a dark brown head. Excellent lacing when swirled, head that stuck to the glass barely moved. Smelled and tasted like a stout should with a smoothness that followed. That's one of things I liked about this beer is the smoothness. Had a nice burn on the end but not a burn that overpowered it, just right. This beer is a definite example of what a stout should be and it's beers like this that just make me glad stouts is my favorite style of beer. I wish I could get this where I live or this would be one of my go-to beers."
"Maybe someone can remix the classic Who song, huh? Nah, maybe not. Anyway, this thing pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of burnt sienna foam. The nose comprises burnt rubber, fusels, roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate-covered raisins. The taste holds a surprising amount of hops, with some heavy pine, flower, and greens piercing the dark backdrop, which itself is composed of pretzels, dark chocolate, and light roasted malts. Honestly, the hoppiness really takes hold, and the stout-like qualities are overshadowed and buried. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick, chewy feel. Overall, I did not care all that much for this one. The hoppiness took away from what could've been a great stout and kept me from really wanting to finish my portion of the bottle."
"D - Hot and very bitter. Wouldn't have been able to drink this whole bottle myself. Glad I shared it."
"This beer pours an absolutely gorgeous abyss with a cocoa brown head. The smell is really very harsh. The nostrils smell mostly rubbing alcohol, which makes it hard to detect the coffee and lemon citrus in the background. The taste is of heavily roasted dark chocolate, a bit of lemon citrus, oats and an everclear backer. The feel, in spite of the fuel grade alcohol is rather nice and smooth. This beer is drinkable and can be enjoyed, but the fumes coming off it are really a turn off."
"Overall, I enjoyed it, but it would probably be better with a couple of years in the cellar."
" This stout tastes like a huge oatmeal stout, tons of malt and bitter cocoa with a mild chocolate malt tinge and subtle hop citrus adding to the bitterness of the malt with a slight dark fruit and subtle toasted element. The drinkability is very good for the heft of the malt and abv contained in this big stout. The taste doesn't stop providing interesting notes of oatmeal and dark malt from first sip until the last with very high quality drinking and enjoyment experienced."
"Overall, DORIS is good without being great. I'll pull my other DORIS out of the cellar around 2015."
"D: A solid beer. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Beer is medium to big in body with a nice lead off sweetness that finishes nicely into an ashy bitterness from the roasted grains. There is a minimal hint of alcohol on the front end of the palate and the finish is a little dry. I enjoyed this beer almost as much as BA BORIS, but I think I like the BORIS better."
"HV"
"overall, not worth the premium nor acclaim as far as my tastes are concerned. Saw it at a good deal and was hoping for something extraordinary. I think this is on par with, say, a Sam Adams Imperial Stout, which is cheaper for the four-pack than this is for one 22oz bottle."
"Overall, EXCELLENT and I look forward to hunting this down again!"
"D: This is a very smooth drinking beer with a very minimal alcohol presence. a real sipper."
"Ripping open envelope-- Hoppin' Frog's D.O.R.I.S the Destroyer. It is an Oatmeal RIS! Wow... Really very good. We get HF here, but the price tag makes me hesitant to buy it for myself! This is one that I won't mind grabbing to share with some one! Thanks for throwing this one in here Mike! I might not have ever picked it up otherwise!"
"Kingmaker. Excellent beer. I've been let down by a few RIS brews lately, even aged ones, but this is a standard-bearer. I vote for another round of D.O.R.I.S. brewing. Quickly."
"A very dark brown, almost black brew with a quarter inch of large bubble tan head which quickly dissolves. Not much lacing present. Smells of toffee, oats and coffee. Has a dark chocolate and toffee taste at the start. But tastes more like a black coffee later. Alcohol is definitely present and it takes just a tad away from a better mouthfeel. For a stout, this beer is a little bit hoppy for what I like in a stout, which makes gives it more of a bitter taste than expected."
"m/d- Extremely full bodied. it is a very sweet enjoyable drink that sticks around in the mouth well after the drink. There is a very strong coffee taste for an imperial stout. I expected a little more sweeter beer, but roasted malt is on the menu for this one. A nice beer to cap off the night."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rich, thick and smooth as butter. Even though this is a very heavy beer, it is so smooth it is no problem to get down. A textbook RIS."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer. I sipped on it a lot and it lasted me about an hour and half. I've been very happy with what I've had from this company. Seek out this gem and like their other bottles this is a diamond in the rough."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, silky smooth and drinkable. A great RIS, one of the better I've had recently! Thanks whoever you are, I owe you next DLD."
"OVERALL: Shit is good. A slightly bigger and bolder version of BORIS is what they were after, and a slightly bigger and bolder version is what they've achieved. They say this right on the bottle, and they didn't lie. Lots of great bold flavors, and a bigger palate to support them. This is one worth seeking out for sure. Unfortunately it's relatively tough to come by. Thanks for hooking me up with bottles of this Tom and Joe."
"Doris the Destroyer comes out black as black can get color wise. The heading is not substantial, about a half a finger. The look is very creamy, and again, very black. From the nose I get dark chocolate, molasses, a hint of dark fruit, and some tobacco. The taste is along the same lines as the aroma, with some smoke. The chocolate gets more bitter here as well. The mouthfeel is big and chewy. This is one big ass Imperial Stout, though still manageable as far as the tastes and smells, nothing too extreme. Weighing in at 10.5% ABV, this is one to sip and savor. This might not be as good as Boris, but it is not far off. Putting the two side by side would be very interesting. Cheers"
"D: Well not bad at all for what it is. Im really enjoying it. Great beer for a cold night. BUT I live in FL so w/e, Im drinking it anyways."
"The day after drinking this I literally did feel destroyed. The beer definitely gained leverage over me quickly after my first glass."
"Fred, when is this coming to Indiana?"
"Pours one shade shy of black with zero head. Nose is extremely malty at first impression, revealing molasses and licorice once the initial malt blast subsides. Taste consistent with nose; however much sweeter than suggested. One thing of note was that a slightly metallic character appeared at the finish; however, it disappeared after the brew warmed a little. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, silky smooth and had only the lightest touch of carbonation. A really great RIS. Maybe not quite as good as BA or regular B.O.R.I.S, but well worth a try. Might be interesting to see how the three differ side-by-side."
"Double Imperial Stout, huh? I don't quite buy that at only 10.5%, but it is a great brew. Comes in a level below the elite imperial stouts in my book. Being that this is my favorite style and this one probably scores better than 90% of other beers in the style, I hope to revisit this a fourth time, fifth time, and so on."
"overall a really nicely done ris. could have had a little bit more on the feel and a little creamier of a feel, but the flavor was there for sure. i liked boris better, but thats me."
"M + D: Big and heavy mouthfeel... carbonation is pretty minimal which suits it, even though I could maybe go for a little more. It doesn't seem to become sticky and heavy as it goes down, which is definitely a plus. Some can be akin to devouring an entire pan of brownies and suffering the stomach ache later. Alcohol warmth is certainly noted, though flavor is really not. A nice evening sipper, and a decent beer to finish the night with or follow up dinner with as a dessert."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. great depth and complexity. nice hoppy dimension. good stuff!"
"This is a massive rich brew that is well crafted, though it still feels a touch young. Still, this has to be one of the better Imperial Stouts out there, definitely in the American vein with all those hops. Love it."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"D- The hot alcohol taste makes this one a little difficult to put down. Something I hope would improve with some time as well."
"This beer is not fooling around - massively roasted with lots of malts, hops and sugary sweetness in the background. Definitely a sipper and probably not quite as good as BORIS for me."
"Very hoppy, quite bitter and dry with some coffee mate, chocolate, and plastic. There is a strange chemical quality here that keeps this from being particularly enjoyable. I had higher hopes for this. I can sense the headache coming as this beer becomes a chore to finish."
"Hoppin' Frog certainly did a nice job with D.O.R.I.S. It's not as good B.O.R.I.S., but it is worthy of your attention. Ultimately, the body's too thin and it has just a tad too much of an alcohol flavor. It's still a nice stout, and is a nice addition to Hoppin' Frog's lineup. If only it were more available."
"The taste was just as good, very oatmeal taste with a solid lingering aftertaste. Had flavors of coffee at the end too. A really good stout, I just wish I had picked up some of my own when I had the chance."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with dense but thin reddish brown head. Pungent from a foot away: dark roast, burnt notes, fig and plum, big earthy hops, a little smokiness ala smoked breakfast meats. Taste: syrupy dark chocolate, plum, a little anise, earthy and citric hopping. Sweet finish with almost syrupy feel but ultimately the hop bitterness and a little powdery roast cuts through as the lasting impression. Good but not better than BORIS as I remember it... definitely not worth the inflated price with this one."
"Taste is pretty good, not as sweet as some of the other big RIS's out there, big roasted malts, akin to burnt rye toast. A bit of hops at the back of the palate and on the finish, balancing out any overbearing sweetness. A pretty nice stout, not flashy, not difficult to drink. Feel is creamy, well-carbonated, but could use a bit more body to it. Almost no alcohol detected in it, an easy and interesting drink."
"D: This was pretty disappointing, actually. I really enjoy BORIS so I was looking forward to trying this beer, but I have to say I was let down."
"The abv is well hidden, but I found regular BORIS much more enjoyable."
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little thick fizzy tan head, with some oil slicks left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee, slight hop note, roastyness. The taste is sweet, malty, with a ton of chocolate/toffee, a nice roast note, slight hops. Full/Medium body, the ABV is kinda upfront with this one. Very Drinkable, a very nice/tasty brew, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I like it! Not too sweet and has a hop finish that sticks around the taste buds for awhile. I was fortunate enough to have picked up a few of these and will age one or two for a Fall campfire."
"Drinks great for the style & ABV, not as good as BA Boris, but nice. Having said that, at the price they were selling in NC $20 a bomber, I can do much better closer to home ( Oak aged Yeti, Schafly IMP Stout or BLVD ImpStout for instance ) & for cheaper"
"The drink is decent considering the alcohol content. But it is the alcohol that destroys this beer, it is too strong to drink this soon. I wish I had held on to this beer and let it reach maturity. Right now it is a defiant toddler/preteen lost in its rebellion."
"D. Not something i would crush, put a treasure to share! A new favorite! Highly Recommended"
"Drinkability is very good rich and full of flavor. Probably a hair less drinkable then the regular BORIS but very nice brew."
"Poured this into a tulip. Pour looks great. Pours solid black with about half an inch of great looking mocha colored head. The head didn't last long but some really nice lacing on this. Big nose full of roasted malts, rich chocolate and bitter espresso. Good earthy smell but I get a bit more alcohol in the nose than I would like, it's not overly offensive, but it is absolutely there. Big earthy flavors followed by a nice finnish of bitter cocoa and espresso. I get a little alcohol flavor but not enough to really put me off. The mouthfeel is nice and silky. Thank you oatmeal! Good carbonation and the relatively light body makes this real easy to drink. Minimal heat from the high abv is also a huge bonus."
"The frog brewers know how to put together a big stout. Excellent production!"
"D:Incredibly drinkable for a RIS. Proper aging might make this elixir something special!"
"Drinkability is EXCELLENT. This is going down well, and it is improving as it warms. It will not be difficult finishing this bottle, and I know that I am going to see if there is any left at Julio's. I want another in my cellarso I can see what happens in a year or two."
"D= crushed a bomber & that was more than enough. Big & heavy but so very, very good!"
"D- The sweetness gets to me after a while. This is still a fine brew and well worth seeking out."
"D - Bit of heat in the finish but a very excellent beer indeed. 4.0"
"Drinkability- REALLY dug the shit out of this one. It's so raw and grainy at times with a big oatmeal presence and a nice fruity American hop profile. As much as I love B.O.R.I.S I'd take this over it any day. It's just bigger and bolder and really really tasty. Thanks much Jeff!!"
"D-not heavey and able to be drinkin. has a decent balance between the roasted malts and the malty sweetness, not fantastic but pretty well done."
"Boozy and in your face! This one would work good with a brownie and a sunrise!"
"D - Would want another as would anyone it's that good."
"I am reviewing this as I am drinking it for fear that I am going to have this 22oz bomber down in the next ten minutes. This beer is simply beautiful. It is nearly pitchblack with a cocoa head. It tastes like dark chocolate with a hint of coffee with a creamy aftertaste. I love imperial stouts and had no idea what to expect from a Double Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout but needless to say this is excellent. Its sad that I have never tried anything from this brewery before yet they are only a couple hours away from me. That frog just had me doubting them. I have always heard good things about Boris but never got around to paying ten dollars for a bottle from a brewery I had never heard of but this is beauty at its finest."
"I haven't had BORIS yet but DORIS is a rock star."
"Taking into account the magnitude of this beer, drinkability is awesome. It's a sipper for sure, but dang if it isn't worth every minute. My only critique, albeit a minor one, would be a tad more burnt flavors. That would be nit-picking, though. This beer lost no luster as I drank it; I actually found myself more intrigued by it with each passing sip. For me, this is in the top-tier of the style. If you see it, don't hesitate."
"A great Imperial Stout - I was impressed - not at all let down - the packaging holds true to the contents."
"D- not as user friendly as BORIS. id love to see how a little time in the basement changes this. too strong to attempt more than one."
"Drinkability: It has been a while since I had BORIS, so I cannot really compare the two, but this is one powerful beer"
"D: This is a very smooth drinking beer with a very minimal alcohol presence. That being said, it is still a sipper. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up another bottle to age. I will say that I prefer BORIS to this though"
"Drinkability: D.O.R.I.S. is bold and very flavorful, but it lacks the delicate complexity I love in regular B.O.R.I.S.. I could imagine an entire bomber (or even half, for that matter) being too much. I'm happy I shared it."
"Pours motor oil black, well it doesn't really pour, it glugs out. Amazing. Traces of a mocha colored head. The smell of roasted malts and coffee are prevelant but then the hops start to take over. Dear Lord, this is the hoppiest imp stout I have ever had. Veryl well balanced, roasted malts and coffee with Dark Choclate mix well well with the hops. The mouth feel is phenominal, motor oil. This is an extrememly well balanced beer, it tastes great but I was struggling to get it down by the end."
"In general, it's good, but I'd take a BORIS over this one any day."
"D: Drinkable no, can you sip it for hours yes. I really liked it. I hope Hoppin Frog tosses this one in a barrel. The result may be as bold as any beer known to man."
"Overall, this is a big beer. I like it, but it is too straight forward for what is normally a complex style. The chocolate and oatmeal is just too much it seems when it overshadows the other flavors of the styles. Relatively drinkable, but very big."
"Drinkability is great for a beer this big, great beer glad I got to try it. The best offering I have had from Hoppin Frog."
"DB- The price ($13) was not surprising for a massive stout these days. I was very happy with all aspects of this one and hope to age some of these (but the oatmeal might not allow that to work very well). Will try this one on tap if I see it and buy another bottle for the next special occasion or tasting."
"An amazing beer from a great company!"
"Overall, a very nice Imp stout but I think I prefer the Boris."
"Im going to have to try these side by side next time, not sure which one im leaning towards, I like em both though"
"D: Very tasty and not too crazy in any direction."
"D- wow what a brew! This stuff has some bite to it but its all sooo good. The 10.5 abv is well done with only the smallest hint of heat."
"4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"D - Extremely drinkable, with 10.5%."
"D - Very drinkable, even at 10.5%."
"drinkability - while i did enjoy the beer i doubt i would ever buy this again wtih so many superior brews out there (boris being one of them)"
"F: Very sticky on the finish, my mouth can hardly open again to take the next sip. Some lingering bitterness from the charred malts more than hops. Dries a bit but lots of lingering sweet stickiness. Black patent malt there I think. More minerality and touch of soy sauce comes through on the finish as well. Wait... could it be... I think... yes! A touch of roasted malt and coffee. Yay, something there I was expecting finally, but really late on the finish and could just be my brain associating the scorched malt bitterness with roast. I got a couple to age so I hope it ages better than it tastes fresh at least. I can see why it only got an A-. Although with the heaviness and sweetness it did hide the 10.5% abv well."
"Overall, I like the direction that Hoppin' Frog took with this one...I think they are on the right track. If that cigarette flavor could get toned down a bit I may even call this one ""great," but I can't just ignore such a huge flaw."
"Bottle from Bruisn' Ales. This takes RIS to newer heights. I am underrating this beer I am sure. Let's start: appearance is black with crimson amber head that has to be seen. The aroma is hops, smpoke, soy bar-B-q sauce. Everything is well integrated in the taste, that carries itself with creamy mouthfeel. Declicious and so-drinkable smoke and liquid chocolate, alcohol there, coffee. New top 25 beer."
"Drinkability - it's been a while since I had a glass of heaven; tonight's bomber allowed for two. ;-)"
"Overall I wasn't blown away by this beer but it's a solid beer for the style with more hops than most. Worth a shot."
"Notes - Age should smooth this beer out and so I put a bomber in my cellar to see if I'm right."
"Overall drinkability is good. BORIS wowed me. This is good, but not ""wow"" good. Maybe the extra roasted malt dampened the oatmeal. Lacks the creamy goodness of BORIS. But, I bet this would be one killer desert beer with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!"
"Easy to drank but not a ton going on here. Session stout anyone?"
"D - Very easy to get down, the roasted malts are slightly bitter, but it's so easy to get down you stop noticing it."
"All in all, this is ok. BORIS is worlds better. If you like BORIS, then this would be good to try at least once. Definitely cannot compete in a sea of awesome stouts. Just ok for me."
"Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and oily, but a little bit thin from the low carbonation."
"D: Hmmmm, not really sure how I feel about this beer. The hops seem to be a bit too forward and appear to cover up the ""stoutier"" aspects of this beer. Things just are not gelling with me like I would have liked it too. Can't really say I'd give this beer another chance, even if to cellar, unless it was on sale again. I will say one thing about the beer though, it certainly don't feel as big as it portends to be."
"All in all, this is an interesting and well-crafted brew, but the roasted quality was just too much for me. It's unfortunate, since this beer is excellent in almost every other facet."
"Tastes a lot better than it smells! Very malty and thick, tons of heavy chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee notes. Carbonation is mild, great mouthfeel! Booze stands out well in the swallow. Has an extrememly tasty chocolate aftertaste! A very good stout!"
"I have a few bottles to keep on hand but I sure wish this was easier to get than it is. WOW!"
"D-a great beer with an excellent taste with a nice balance between hop presence and the usual RIS malt taste with the hops making this beer crisp and drinkable even for an RIS"
"Taste is rich and sweet, sharp and sweet with some very light hoppiness. Mouthfeel is really rich and full very creamy and tasty. Boozier than Boris but still tasty."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: I really dig the mouthfeel of the beer. The body of the beer is among the fullest I have experienced. Very smooth and slick while drinking. Long lasting bitterness cuts up the sweetness of the beer. The beer has a slightly alcoholic feel to the mouth and this blemishes the mouthfeel and the drinkability slightly. This beer disappeared rapidly from my glass. When the alcohol is tamed a little this will be a very potent kick ass Imperial Stout. Thanks Hopping Frog."
"It's still a bit young and warm, but still drinkable. Potential is high with this one. I'm sure this one will do really nicely in the cellar. Darkness, or Smuttynose Imperial likeness."
"O - When Hoppin' Frog decides to brew this beer again, I am definitely seeking it out again. However, I am a little torn on what to do with this beer. I think the alcohol could use a little age to mellow, but the hop flavor and aroma contribute a lot to this beer. This beer could be a little better if the alcohol was a little more blended with the rest of the flavors but the hop aroma and flavor was retained."
"great beer! thanks Hoppin' Frog"
"edit: now that i've had BORIS and BA BORIS, I can say this is nothing like it. HUGE hoppy flavor (at least when fresh). Its a great beer, but I'm letting this one lay down for a while."
"D: As advertised, this drinks like an amped up BORIS. Awesome."
"Smells of sweet coffee and tastes the same. This is a coffee dominant beer with hints of caramel and some mild spice hops. Definitely different than BORIS, not as sweet or fruity. Feels rich and smooth and is nice to sip on when you are in the mood for some coffee flavored beer."
"Worth the $10.99 price tag. Ill be trying to get a few more. This is one hell of an R.I.S. Bigger and better than B.O.R.I.S. It is good fresh; cant wait to see what some cellar time does."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with almost an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, but has the addition of some burnt/charred malt and a bit of booze. Also, the hop flavor is stronger in the taste (compared to the light hops in the aroma). This is a good and mostly bitter stout. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy, rich, coating, and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, but this is definitely a sipping brew. There's a bit of booze noticable that cuts down on the drinkability a bit. All in all I think this is a good beer. I think I'll be aging my other bottle for a while!"
"Overall, this was nice. But B.O.R.I.S. is such a perfect beer that this can't keep up with the bar that was set. It's good but not elite, glad to have a few bottles to see if it cools down and gels over the next few years. I'd take any BORIS (including all 3 BA batches) over this anyday."
"Serving type: 22oz bottle"
"D: Perhaps a bit of a sipper, this thing is a beast. I would almost like to see it subdued a bit, but I guess that is what BORIS is for. Wish I had another bottle to age for a year or three. Tasty and larger than life."
"mouth feel is thick and coats the tongue, this is a sipper of course, great beer i could handle two of these bombers cause i got to go to work in the morniing Cheers!"
"D - It was a good idea to split between two people as the entire bottle might have done a bit to impair my senses. Absolutely worth the treat if you can get your hands on it."

"Overall I'm a little disappointed. I can't get enough of BA B.O.R.I.S., and I hoped Hoppin Frog would approach that level of greatness with D.O.R.I.S., albeit at a lower price point. It seems to me, however, that the beer is just B.O.R.I.S. with the malt and hops bills ramped up, leaving a beer with odd hops presence and too much alcohol in the flavor. Oh well..."
"D- Definitely bigger and more evil than BORIS. This beer is here to rip your jaw off. I like it but I think I like her baby (if you can call him that) brother more."
