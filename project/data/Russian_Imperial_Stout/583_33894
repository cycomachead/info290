4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured too cold from a 750ml bottle.  Less than a finger of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Pours a deep purplish black like a deep BlackBerry.  Dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and bourbon in the nostrils.  Dark fruit but can't place it.  Raisins?  Guessing straight KY bourbon but it does over power the aforementioned flavors.  However, I like the taste of bourbon so this isn't bad to me.  Too thin in the mouth unfortunately.  Bourbon down followed by dark chocolate, vanilla, hops and roasted malts but bourbon aftertaste.  If it was creamier, I'd love it.  Letting it warm up.  Improves the flavors in the nose and mouth.  Not bitter.  A good effort.  No idea what the abv is but I'm guessing high.","uvachief","Jan 24, 2015"

3.89,-4.4,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall, this is one hell of a sweet beer; so much so that the sweetness is in place of flavor.  This is not to be confused with boldness, it is just very sweet.  It is only after you wait three to four minutes after the sip that you begin to appreciate its subtleties of flavor.  If we’re going to be extra picky here then we do have to mention that, if you’re calling this a Russian Imperial Stout, then it just simply isn’t bitter enough.  The oak tries to work you down, in all of its sourness and char, but this appears when the beer reaches room temperature, and not really a second sooner.  Once you get used to it, it does seem to go down smoother, much in the same sense that Choklat does.  Other than general quality of ingredients, what really sets this beer apart is the heavy oakiness.  This adds to nearly every aspect of the beer, obviously including flavor as mentioned above, but it is most notable through the feel where it effectively dries off an oily base.  This is a fine beer, and perhaps a fresher bottle would have given us more of that Russian intensity, bitterness, and balance that might have put this one over the top for us.","TheBrewo","Nov 14, 2014"

4.25,4.4,,,,,,"This is a big beer with tons of Bourbon character. The nose is a bit deceptive with some sweet tones of vanilla, coconut and the whiskey creaminess. The flavor is strong bourbon flavor as if some one spilled a shot directly into a stout. As it warms I get more chocolate from the base beer with barrel added coconut and vanilla. The finish is a bite of liquor with an after thought of raw whiskey. As bourbon barreled beers go this seems to have absorbed more of the liquor than any other stout I've had. That's a good thing for me.","KYGunner","Sep 21, 2014"

Taste is also dominated by loads of vanilla notes with strong bourbon notes and quite a bit of residual sugar notes with light black chocolate. Body is somewhat full with an oily like texture and medium carbonation with light warming alcohol notes.

It is a very 50/50 balance of a stout and a bourbon ale. A perfect blent of roasted malts and bourbon ntoes. The bourbon aspect of the beer is a very rye and sour mash flavored bourbon. It adds a lot of vanilla flavors and a slight dry wood character to the beer. The beer portion is more subtle then expected. A lot of roasted malt and and a bit of a dark chocolate.

4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"2008 popped tonight. Dark, smooth flowing beer w/ little head if any. Very calm beer. Yet inviting. Smells of bourbon, not overpowering, but just enough to be identified.. Some vanilla hints, dark fruit, raisin, figs, carmel. Neat bit of sweetness. Very smooth beer, that as it warms up becomes even that more pleasent. Never had one fresh, but I can tell ya that after 4 years, its quite enjoyable. I'd do it again...","vande","Sep 01, 2012"
3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The palate reveals a moderately oxidized beer, alternatingly excellent and average, with the blend of soy, chocolate and bourbon being rather excellent (bringing to my mind the incomparable 03 BA Speedway) being superimposed to a faint fusel and solvent-like unpleasantness. Allowing it to warm up and breathe lessens this aspect while bringing out the medium-dark chocolate. The bourbon character is mellow, with some heat, a some vanilla and pairs very well with the chocolate. The soy note is mild, and works well with the beer. A firming bitterness and roasted malt flavor are present on the finish, along with a little alcohol. Medium in body, mildly carbonated, this beer feels quite nice on the palate. This beer exceeded my expectations.","DefenCorps","Sep 01, 2012"

4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2011 vintage. This one pours a medium bodied dark, dark brown in color that turns to black when it fully collects in the glass. The beer featured no head at all and almost no lacing. The aromas consist of coconut, oak, dark sweet malts, vanilla, and it has a very, very light bourbon aspect. At this point the bourbon is almost gone but the nose is still pretty nice. This beer tastes of sweet dark roasted malts, with a nice amount of coffee and sweet chocolate, vanilla, COCONUT, with a nice oak component. It has really nice flavor and is well rounded. It could be a little thicker in body but it's ok like this. It drinks well and the flavor resonates and leaves a long lasting multifaceted aftertaste. It went very well with a double chocolate cookie!!!","WoodBrew","Aug 05, 2012"

Pours fairly clear almost pitch black color with a small tan head with good retention; that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, raisin, molasses, bourbon, earth, and light herbal. Fairly nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, oak, bourbon, earth, and light herbal hops. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, chocolate, toffee, toast, bourbon, oak, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity; and minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is fairly well hidden; with only a warming after the finish noticed. Definitely a slow sipper. Overall this is a nice barrel aged imperial stout. Nice balance and good complexity of flavors. It did not impress me as much as I would have hoped though.","superspak","Jun 19, 2012"

At first the body of it seems light, but the finish is a little 'hot' and boozy - an abundance of bourbon. Not such a bad thing, however.

4.15,2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an almost opaque super dark black with a 1 inch puffy dark tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A thick curtain of lace sticks to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and the barrel aged aromas - vanilla, bourbon, and oak. However, the smells are very subdued on the first pour but get better as the beer warms. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla, and a dry wood flavor on the finish. There is a very mild roast flavor that fades from the palate quickly after each sip. A slight alcohol kick in the mouth with each sip. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a lower level of carbonation.

At this point the bourbon is almost gone but the nose is still pretty nice. This beer tastes of sweet dark roasted malts, with a nice amount of coffee and sweet chocolate, vanilla, COCONUT, with a nice oak component. It has really nice flavor and is well rounded. It could be a little thicker in body but it's ok like this. It drinks well and the flavor resonates and leaves a long lasting multifaceted aftertaste.","aasher","Aug 10, 2011"

The aroma is at once both intensely alcoholic and full of intense dark fruits...dark currants, berries, and a bit of dark malt. The taste is also very fruity. Warm, borderline hot, and quite rich in flavor. Bitter, but not hoppy. The beer has a moderately full body, and is nicely enjoyable.","Suds","May 21, 2011"

First sip was all bourbon, but as I drank the glass down i was able to get malt and some smoke. The bourbon is almost too overwhelming to catch much else as far as flavors. Mouth feel is bourbon, heavy bourbon. It keeps me waiting to catch more tastes as if finishes, but once again, all I catch is bourbon, and a nice dryness through the finish. Not so much bad, just bourbon overload.

Big bourbon flavor, dark chocolate on the mid-palate, and a boozy finish. I would let this beer sit another 1-2 years before sampling again.

Great scent that combines burbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, roasted cocoa beans, roasted coffee beans, black cherry, hints of brown sugar sweetness. Taste brings the components of scent together nicely without being overly powerful, the bourbon has mellowed and lost its burn, but not its flavor, the burbon, vanilla and oak cover oup the underlying stout flavors, which can't be judged alone. Heaier side of medium bodied, but thinner than expected from such a big beer.

Taste full and flavourful in the mouth, chocolate and heat, nutty and sweet, some smoke; aftertaste is a touch too alcohol for my liking. But man oh man, does it linger!

Some darker fruits noticable as the beer warms. As the alcohol feel leaves the beer finishes pretty cleanly.

Didn't really get much of the oak flavor from the aging, maybe some of the oaked sweetness, but not near as much oakiness that i was expecting from something aged in oak.

This is a nice one. Pours a brownish black with a thin vrown head that sticks around as a thin cap/ring. The smell carries amazing aromas of vanilla, Bourbon, oak, sweet brown sugar, and some creamy and roasty notes in the background. Just heavenly. Tastes on the sweeter side - which I'm okay with- with more brown sugar and vanilla up front a nutty, slightly roasty finish and huge Bourbon notes throughout.

When held to light, it shone a lovely looking deep reddish brown. The smell is primarily of bourbon with sweet caramel aroma interspersed. The caramel sweetness comes forth in the taste as well, but is wonderfully blended with the savory flavors roasted malt and the lightly sharp bitterness of oak that lingers on the back of the tongue after swallowing--a bit sweeter than anticipated, probably due to age, but by no means cloying. The mouth feel is nice, but not as thick as I would like for a beer over 10% ABV. Slight carbonation persists throughout, making for a smooth tingly swallow, despite. As far as drinkability is concerned, this beer is nice--I could down a 750ml bottle in one sitting with pleasure--but for the price I'd probably stick to buying it once a year with each annual release.

4.28,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"It pours out basically black, with a ruby tinge to it when held up to a bright light. The head forms nicely and then fades a bit. The aroma is dominated by bourbon and alcohol. Notes of dark chocolate, too. The flavor packs a punch, with the bourbon and alcohol again, ripened dark fruit, and rich chocolate. Quite syrupy. The bourbon flavors linger a bit longer than I wanted. The mouthfeel is great - smooth and creamy. All the alcohol and the aftertaste prevent me from wanting to imbibe lots of it, but overall it's a good brew.","MDekker","Jul 15, 2008"
3.5,-14,3,3,4,3,3.5,"Bottle. Dark brown color, with a small extremely light brown/white head. Aroma disappoints, not revealing anything worth mentioning. Flavorwise, this is pretty nice. A good dose of tobacco and burnt toffee, with hints of caramel and butterscotch, bourbon and oak. This is a fine tasting beer, but doesn't come close to the best Bourbon Imperial Stouts. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing as well. Overall, this is just an ok beer, not something worth collecting.","Crosling","Jun 23, 2008"

Aroma is rich dark malts, with vanilla notes. Taste begins with the dark sweetness, goes a bit fruity and boozy in the middle, and then almost evaporates in the back of the mouth leaving the barrel character to linger. Mouthfeel is velvety and soft over the tongue, and drinkability is good for the style. Enjoying this one.","ppoitras","May 22, 2008"

3.8,-6.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"A few months on this 2007 bomber now. Impressive packaging and box. Pours a deep brown body, almost opaque. Small beige head falls into some attractive patchy lace. Nice aroma features vanilla, bourbon, and some roasty notes of char and chocolate. A bit thin in the mouth for an impy stout. Medium carbonation levels. Taste is much like the aroma. Vanilla dominates. Subtle milk chocolate notes lend a prevailing sweetness, mingling well with the bourbon essence. Mild notes of bitter dark roast throughout. In the now vast pantheon of bourbon barrel imperial stouts there is nothing about this that stands out. A minor disappointment here from a brewery that has wowed me for the most part over the past two years.","merlin48","Apr 07, 2008"

The taste is consistent with the smell, sweet when it hits the tongue and the alcohol warms as it descends. The flavor becomes more prominant as the temperature warms. It feels a little thin to be an imperial stout but drinks incredibly easy. I'll definitely get another one of these and age it a bit. A must try if you like impy stouts!","tiger88","Feb 21, 2008"

4.58,12.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"The much anticipated imperial stout from Schlafly. A severely burnt brown bordering black in color, a well defined 1/2 inch tan head that settles down and forms into bubbly and sticky lacing around the rim. A very boozy nose, sets up nicely--some espresso beans, fresh plums, fig and traces of vanilla are nice to locate. Piney hops, almond and creamy bourbon offerings, extremely oily and slick. The body is clearly full in nature, with a bourbon-esk feeling, sweet chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans are in the flavorings. The palate turns sweet in a hurry with more alcholish notes and caramel malts. Warming further reveals oak and dark malts. Dare I say that this is a great change of pace impy stout? It's sweet and boozy and not overly powerful. Incredible stuff.","GeoffRizzo","Apr 21, 2007"
3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured big black as night, nice small caramel colored head faded quickly but did leave befind a nice lace. Smell was very sweet of caramel and sugar, with roasted coffee. Great hints of vanilla and dark chocolate, with the alcohol content definatly visible. Taste was very nice. Not too thick, with nice carbonation. Very smooth considering the high ABV of 10.50% which was very well hidden. Flavor was very robust and full of coffee and chocolate flavors. A slight hint ok the oak flavors as it started to warm up. This was a very good Imperial Stout. Not too thick and extremely drinkable, with no real big alcohol flavor, it definatly does sneak up on you. Overall very nice only afterthought was it could be a bit creamier, but really a fine brew.","mikesgroove","Mar 19, 2007"
3.85,-5.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A relatively new beer to the Central Ky market. I stumbled across this brew a few weeks ago, but just getting around to enjoying. Turns out that I could have waited quite a while; the beer still has some comming-together to do. The pour is an opaque black or very dark brown color with low-lying carbonation and average head retention for a bourbon barrel Stout. Aromas of dark, roasted grain, heavy malts, and a dominant booze-ey swirl around; promising bold flavors and heavy alcoholic strength. The flavors are expectedly rich, bold, and rooted with espresso and coffee. These flavors are backed up with cherries, berries, lacose, toast, and a fruitcake mix. A mild tartness, oak, caramel, and vanilla persists from the boubon barrels and maybe a rouge bacteria / yeast. Agian the taste is dominated by rum-like alcohols. The feel is a heavy, moderately harsh, fusal feel with richness, slickness (I presume from oat additions), and easily mouth coating. Not overly sweet, nor hoppy (for balance only). A moderate roasted-grain astingency persists, despite the heated, abrasive alcohols. The beer proves the abv stated on the bottle, and then some. With some age, this beer will prove to be a winner.","BEERchitect","Feb 21, 2007"

A stout for nearly any time of year.","mcallister","Feb 13, 2007"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A nice screened 750ml bottle ... pours a dark, semi-opaque black into the wide mouth snifter. Fairly thin, medium-tan head with sporadic lacing in the inner rim. Retention wasn't too good here. The nose is a smattering of baker's chocolate, sweet vanilla, and alcohol. Nice, actually. The palate is, again, dominated by chocolate early on, but moving toward a sweeter vanilla-laced bourbon flavor in the mouth. Very sweet and velvety. The bourbon influence is greater the warmer the beer gets, and should really be served at cellar temperature only. Mouthfeel improves as the beer acclimates to the ambient temperature in the room, resulting in a nice medium mouthfeel stout with a very smooth, sweet finish. Finished sweeter than dry. In my mind, Schlafly's has come a long way in a short time, improving their beers exponentially over the last couple of years. This is a great example of a beer I, frankly, wouldn't have thought Schlafly's could have created ... very high quality, well-balanced, tasty Imperial Stout. I'm becoming a bigger fan of The St. Louis Brewing Co. all the time. Good stuff.","beerphilosopher","Jan 30, 2007"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium bodied. The alcohol is hot and makes its prescence known. This is not a negative to my mind.

I started with the beer lightly chilled. The remainder of my bottle I left outside in the cold night air. The second pour was way too cold.

4.27,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Deep, light absorbing black color, and topped by a thick, fizzy tan colored head. The head showed good retention, and left a sheet of lace on the glass as it receded. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate, followed by vanilla, almond, and a light bourbon character late in the nose. The flavor has more chocolate than I expected, a light touch of espresso, and more vanilla and almond. The bourbon notes are not easily found in the flavor. My only beef with this beer is the mouth feel. If this had a bit more body, it would be a truly great beer, but it is a little thin. Still, nicely drinkable. Overall, a well done beer. I was not impressed with this beer, when I first had it on tap, but it's growing on me. I'm not sure if the beer itself is changing, or if my palette is adjusting.
