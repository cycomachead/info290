The dark roast malts really stood forward in the flavor, with some coffee, dark fruits, and of course the alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy smooth  - very nice. Overall, Stone hardly ever disappoints, and this beer is no exception.","timontheroad","Sunday at 08:39 PM"

4.59,5.8,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Stone russian imperial stout 2014 release. Consumed 1-22-15. Look is black with a dark tan head. First taste comes black licorice, anise and a little chocolate. After 3-4 sips the palate is coated with fuzz, tends to hide the first taste flavors. All in all a good brew. Sweet tasting after the first sips and the alcohol burn isn't there. Great stout by a great brewery. Stone should do a collaboration with valiant or black market. Or do a triple collaboration with those two. Amazing what collaborations do to an already fantastic stout. Two thumbs up.","Gpartnoff","Jan 22, 2015"

4.9,12.9,5,5,4.75,5,5,"I've had this beer twice: once fresh, and a second time aged 7 months. Pours like tar from the bottle, so you get this ridiculously thick, BLACK liqiuid with a brown head stubborn to form due to the thickness and low carbonation. Smells of dark fruit, burnt coffee, chocolate, and, to my nose, a subtle peanut butter note. The fresh beer had this prominent black coffee taste with a licorice note elevated by a pleasantly hearty booze note. Aged seven months, there's a little more malt and the booze calms down a bit. The mouthfeel is fat and full, as should be expected from this style since it flows like syrup (or beerup as my friend jokingly calls it). Overall, I'm really enjoy this beer. I rated it strongly because I generally don't like hot beer but the warmth of this ale just helps it taste better. I plan on doing another review after aging another bottle for MUCH longer.","RyanTheLion76","Jan 15, 2015"

It was delicious though, real smooth, could hardly taste the alcohol. After 5 years it lacked a lot of the burn you taste in the '14.

Nationally, give me KBS from Founders or Bourbon County from Goose Island. Still, a solid interpretation of a challenging style that is getting reduced too much in the U.S. right now to obviously big flavors and alcoholic contents which do not always behoove the style. Frankly, this is another example that tells me Stone is a very good brewery, but not a great one (despite the hype).","Wobbly","Aug 29, 2014"

Aroma held vanilla and alcohol notes with some roasted malts trying to peek out...they remained covered until the first taste. The taste is bitter/roasted coffee and malts with the alcohol present but not over powering, deep roasted flavors and some wood hints show up as the tasting goes on. The mouthfeel is so dead on for the style, thick/heavy on the tongue while leaving a nice roasted mild coffee/roasted flavor at the end. Overall I'm very impressed with this offering, I love RIS as a whole and I've had a lot of Stones products...this is a winner and I will pick it up when I can.","Bear1964","Aug 10, 2014"

It is always nice to see Stone's IRS hit the shelves, yet the (odd year) varieties and W00tstout seem to eclipse the standard version. I've had this beer both fresh and aged (~2 years) and prefer it fresh since the fruity aromatics, subdued licorice/anise flavor and well-defined bitterness are more apparent when young.

For once, they did not let me down. Outstanding look and appearance, tasty and enjoyable and not to much punch despite the ABV. I enjoyed this one very much, while there are other Imperial Stouts I prefer, this one gets great grades due to cost and ability to deliver the ABV. I will probably buy a couple more and cellar (stash in the basement, but cellar sounds better) to share with others who say they like stouts. Closest thing to a go to for me from Stone (yea, I know everyone is shaking their heads to that comment)","JamieDuncan","Jun 03, 2014"

The scent is vanilla bean and espresso, quite strong. Hints of a dark, fruity chocolate. The taste is rather faithful to the scent, with a bitter finish. It's got a nice full body, easy to roll around in the mouth and enjoy in a voluptuous sort of way :). An enjoyable stout. I'm having this 3 months after its bottling date, but I think I'll take a cue from other reviewers in saying that it would be interesting if aged longer.","b_birra","May 29, 2014"

4.39,1.2,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. I finished the whole bottle myself over an hour and it sneaks up on you, taps you on the shoulder, and then introduces you to a whole Soviet armored division, Baba Yaga, and a bunch of other Russian traditions. Definitely a beer for a weekend or an evening when you have no other responsibilities. Alcohol is very well hidden but I definitely could notice it by the end of the first glass. That being said, this beer pairs very well with food. It has a stand-alone flavor that isn't overpowering, and doesn't linger forever on the palate. It went very well with salad, mashed potatoes, and sausage. I think it would pair well with a wide range of meats and a wide range of other foods as well. Overall an amazing beer, and I may have to start picking this one up every year when it comes out. I've had several people tell me to cellar a bottle or two so I may have to start doing that as well. Definitely a beer to celebrate.","damndirtyape","May 17, 2014"

I would rather have a 4 pk of founders imperial stout at $11.99. Overall they are about the same in quality and ABV, Founders being a tad better and a much better value. If they offered this at $4-5.99 comparative to Arrogant bastard it would be a deal.","Ohiolager","May 13, 2014"

Pours Dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malts with moderate earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength and some slight booziness. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal/roasted bitterness after the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate earthy yeast flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish, Overall this is outstanding imperial stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 05, 2014"

On the nose I get roasted grains that lend a coffee aroma, plus charred wood, smoked meat, earthy hops, and some alcohol. The taste has a creamy chocolate quality with black currants, coffee, more of those earthy hops, and an astringent taste from the roasted grains. It feels quite full-bodied in the mouth and goes down velvety.","itsscience","Apr 18, 2014"

Hop bitterness builds up nicely and lingers through the end. But it's the bold roasted grain flavors that tell the real story: big toasted malt flavors with a mild sugary sweetness and bitter chocolate tones. The ABV makes its presence known, too, but is well-blended with the malt and hop elements to make an overall harmonious marriage of taste and feel. Complexity and depth with a fairly easy drinking quality for such a heavy and high ABV ale make this stout a winner.","beergoot","Apr 15, 2014"

For that reason alone I could not give 5's straight across the ratings. However, I will dare to say that this specific mix of hops might just be the last ingredient that such an ale has missed in other brews, for me. It makes for a powerhouse ale, which is dynamic and full bodied. So what we have here is an Americanized RIS. I have probably enjoyed no less than 20 or 30 Imperial Stouts, and I have to say that this is, despite the unique variation, the best I have had.","datalager","Mar 26, 2014"

The ABV is well concealed. You get buzzed without tasting the booze. This didn't blow me away, but didn't disappoint. I would rather drink North Coast-Old Rasputin. Shameless plug but still. This is a great beer! Beautiful texture and aromatic wonders. Wish the taste was more exciting. Stone will remain a top five brewery in America though.

The balance is such that nothing sticks out. That makes it more subtle than blasty. Often I want something more robust, something harsher, but it's good to know this milder one is there too.","BrownNut","Oct 30, 2013"

So many aromas waft from the tulip - dark roast coffee, caramel, dried fruit, anise, soy sauce, and so much more. Extremely complex.  Nice sweetness hits the palate first - molasses, fig, vanilla, chocolate. Bitterness on the back end with lots of coffee, bitter chocolate and toasted coconut. Full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a textbook example of Russian Imperial stout, very well crafted, very balanced and super smooth, it's like drinking silk.","JohnG190","Oct 24, 2013"

Malty. A thick, sticky yet smooth-sipping beast of an RIS. Burn. Feels good like that. Maybe my prior sampling had more age. Maybe this beer is even greater with a year or several on it. I know I've had it in the past and it blew me away. Oh well.

The aroma held notes of molasses, dark chocolate, roasted malt with a slight hint of licorice and dark fruits. The taste followed suit with a strong note of molasses, dark chocolate and dark fruits. Obviously there was a lot going on in this brew and it deserves the strong reputation. The fantastic flavors only expanded as it warmed.

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, medium warming and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this isn't the kind of beer that I would drink multiple bottles of but I wouldn't mind having a bomber to myself and I think it's pretty drinkable for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this is a textbook RIS and nothing about it is out of place for the style. What I like the least about this beer was how warming the alcohol was, it wasn't overwhelming but I wish it was toned down just a little. I would buy this beer again, I think it's priced nicely and it's dead on for the style, i'm glad I bought a couple bottles to cellar, I might have to grab a couple more and I will for sure be buying some when it's released next year, I think this also has the potential to age well. All in all i was pretty happy with this beer, I had heard it was good and it didn't disappoint, it was a great straight forward RIS that I really enjoyed drinking and while it's not my favorite it is up there as one of the better RIS I have had. Good job guys, this is one great stout.","StoutHunter","Aug 02, 2013"

The head sticks around for longer and leaves a nicer lacing on the glass, while basically the same color, and it looks creamier. The smell is creamier and hides the alcohol better. The taste has vanilla and creamy milk flavors in it that I just don't taste as much with the original. I said yesterday that the Stone Espresso IRS drinks like a chocolate milkshake in beer form, and the original is a little less thick. Overall, for 50 cents more a bomber I'd go with the Stone Espresso IRS, it's just better. I'll have to snag a case of it and cellar for later!","ISmith87","Aug 01, 2013"

4.69,8.1,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Overall - This is one of the best standard Russian Imperial Stouts out there. Nothing unique or crazy or out there about this beer but Stone executes it with such quality and attention to detail that it stands right near the top of all Russian Imperial Stouts and is just an excellent beer","WiscoBrewsco","Jun 08, 2013"
4.08,-6,4.5,4,4,4,4.25,"Overall, this is a great russian Imperial stouts. I would have to say that it tastes very similar to the Espresso Imperial Russian Stout, except this one doesn't include the espresso bomb flavor that the other has. This is a stripped down version of its Espresso counterpart. This is as very smooth Russian Imperial stout. It goes down easy, and one can't taste the alcohol.","Tonmeister","Jun 08, 2013"

A good bit of booze is apparent. Roast isn't overwhelming in the flavor. I get a good bit of sweet, bready malts that stand out. Nice bit of chocolate and coffee as well. A little citrus rind from the hops. Alcohol is a little strong in the finish, but doesn't get medicinal. Mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, full, rich, smooth, with just a touch of prickly carbonation. Overall this is pretty awesome. It would be stellar with a few months to a year+ on it. WAY more drinkable fresh than some other Stone high abv releases. Can't wait to try this around Thanksgiving/Christmas.","goochpunch","Jun 02, 2013"

Not sure if I could recommend it over Old Rasputin, which is comparably affordable (even cheaper) and has the advantage of coming in 12oz bottles. The flavors are different between the two beers, for sure, but I'm not sure one is necessarily better than the other. Stone's IRS is certainly more complex. Very impressed with this...

The roast is kept pretty low and the fruit is maybe a tic below medium. Enough hops on the finish to barely be noticeable, and the mouthfeel is rich without being chewy. For something that has been around since 2002, it has really stood the test of time with flying colors. It may not be the best stout I have ever had...but for the availability, consistency and price - it is tough to beat in my book.","twiggamortis420","May 28, 2013"

However, if you don't want any coffee flavor this beer is so subtle, balanced, and tasty, with the perfect mouthfeel for the style. Would buy again it again in a heartbeat, and is a great value for the bomber.","ChrisKayler","May 10, 2013"

As for the aroma, I am primarily enjoying dark fruit esters such as raisin & fig. The taste is smooth and sublime... very balanced between the dominant aforementioned dark fruits, molasses, toasted malt, and even a faint hopped flavor that edges its way in. The mouth feel and alcohol heat are just right, not too heavy like you may assume. Pleasantly dry finish that leaves you thirsting for more... Overall a practically perfect RIS!","Neorebel","Feb 10, 2013"

Thank you for providing me with 2 of the 5 beers that I brought with me to live in the southern continent! Thankfully I have 5 more waiting for me when I return, patiently waiting to be savored over the next few years. I'm anxious to see how the hops hold up with age, and to see how the darker flavors come to the fore. As close to perfect as can be at the age of just under one year.

4.6,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D - A benchmark for the style to be certain. Everything about this brew is dead on, from the dark roasty profile, to the pungent bouquet, to the massive mouthfeel it packs. Well rounded, but assertive and even abrasive. This is exactly what an RIS should be. Interested to see what happens with my other bottle after some aging. If I had just one complaint, it would be that for 10.50% ABV, I expected a bit more flavor; I've had 9.00% stouts that pack just as much as this one does, and I was hoping the slight increase in ABV over some other stouts would provide even more flavor than a traditional RIS.","Converge","Dec 14, 2012"

The class Stone puts in this bottle is 2nd to none and can be enjoyed when first released or after it sits in your personal cellar awhile. Most Russian Imperial Stouts call for some sitting to get the smooth easy drinking brew, but not this one. It's ready to go from its release. Sure it would sit well and age nicely, but the sheer complexity and masterly crafted balance allow we snobs to bust one open right away. This is an expertly crafted imperial stout from one of the best breweries in the world. A yearly favorite of mine and IMO you can't find many better stouts than this. A top 5 for me any day. Absolutely flawless.","BradtheGreat7","Nov 27, 2012"

I get the impression that Stone was trying to push the envelope and sacrificed flavor for alcohol content. It's missing the roasty malt goodness and full flavor, balance, and body that smooths out the alcohol. If you want to try this beer, do it early in your session and consider making it a one beer session.","Nutwood","Nov 27, 2012"

Either this beer transforms amazingly with age, or my palate has been refined over the last half year, but this was much better than I remember it from the first time (and I still thought it was pretty good). Less of the nearly-cloying anise and licorice (much less, actually) and quite a bit more cocoa powder and even a hefty dose of coffee beans in the aftertaste. Decent roast from the malts and still a solid alcohol warmth after all these years. Mouth feel wasn't as amazing as I remembered it, though. No oxidation - wow.","tectactoe","Oct 15, 2012"

It has all the characteristics of a stout – nice roastiness, good depth of flavours, and an enjoyable thicker body. As per typical from Stone and west coast brewing, the beer offers a moderate amount of bitterness, and it’s easy to know where it comes from. I find this works well in contrast to the sweeter elements. Overall, the beer is a very easily drinkable package. Furthermore, these bombers are reasonably priced with good accessibility. All this combined make it a regular go-to stout. May not be as bold or rare as others, but it doesn’t let you down. Highly recommend to try.","EnemyWithin","Aug 19, 2012"

The hops settle out to this orange and grape-like smoothness that just tastes fantastic. It also starts to pick up some flavors like a nice Port. It's really hard not to drink what I have left of these.","estlinska","Jul 07, 2012"

The woodsy hops add multiple layers of complexity without being too bitter. The alcohol is well-integrated, adding yet another layer to the mix. A must-have for any beer stash.","KevinBrewer","Jul 06, 2012"

A rich but warming aroma of chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, roasted malt with some definite alcohol showing itself. Flavorwise, the alcohol was definitely a quite notioceable, just a a tad too much so, with some roasted malt, chocolate, licorice and sweet cream. An awesome full, creamy and velvety mouthfeel. Not flat but also not much activity. Overall, a very nice IRS. The alcohol presence was a tad too strong, the flavor a bit straightforward but a very nice beer overall. I'd certainly drink this again and at ~$7 a bomber a pretty fair deal.","denver10","Jul 01, 2012"

The nose was very impressive, probably one of the best smelling RIS (or IRS?) I have tried. The flavor is delicious and complex with notes of coffee, chocolate, fruit, oak, and toastiness. The high alcohol doesn't really show itself (although I find myself saying that more and more so it may just be my palate becoming accustomed to these double digit ABV'ers). Overall a great stout and at $5.99 a bomber, a great value. I will put one away to see how it ages.","NoLeafClover44","Jun 13, 2012"

Warming comes from deep within, not in the mouth or the throat. Allowing this one to warm up will accentuate the sweetness of the dark fruits and the tartness of their skins, along with the amaretto-like flavors in this RIS. I feel that the roasty characteristics are actually more present at cooler temps - I would recommend enjoying this one at about 45 degrees. They diminish beyond 50.

Not from the ashy notes, but perhaps a few more sugars, or an additional layer of flavor to help bring out what is already there. This beer seems, in other words, to cry out for a bit of barrel aging, as a bourbon undertone would nicely complement the alcoholic, ashy tones. Still, even without this, it’s still a very nice stout, and worth trying.","jondeelee","May 23, 2012"

The chocolate nose is excellent. Big chocolate and coffee notes on the palate, with hints of toffee and caramel. Excellent bitter balance to the sweet malt flavors. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel.

4.73,9,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours black with a creamy chocolate brown head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the glass during consumption. The alcohol smell is very forward in the aroma, but I can also catch dark roasted malts and coffee in the aroma. It's very inviting. The alcohol definitely comes through in the taste here. I can also pick up the roasted malts and coffee flavors that I smelled. I also pick up some dark chocolate flavor and anise as well. I might not have been lookign for anise if not for the description on the bottle. There is also some hop bitterness there to balance this big brew. The alcohol definitely has a warming effect and a bottle of this would be perfect for a cold winter night. This is a medium to full bodied beer and it is a sipper. It is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a good example of the style.","acevenom","May 17, 2012"

Not guaranteed, but in this case Stone comes through with flying colors. Pitch black with a thin tan head. Big aroma lets you know there is a serious stout sitting in the glass. Surprisingly drinkable, with lots of complexity. Flavors range from chocolate to vanilla, molasses to coffee to ginger spice. Flavors keep changing as you make your way through the bottle and as the stout warms. The Oskar Blues Ten Fidy is my favorite Imperial Stout, but the Stone ranks up there and is worthy of working into the rotation. I love the complexity of this brew.

If I see it I will drink it. Had the opportunity to try a 2010 and 2011. The 2010 lost some of the sweetness, and picked up a salty, soy sauce character. This beer cannot go wrong.

This "viscous beauty" as it's written in the side of the bottle is a dangerous and sinful stout (although Stone claims no sin was committed in the production of this brew) is worth to seek and drink.

Aromas are rich, with blackstrap molasses, dark roasted coffee, and old world fruit sweetness. The beer has a full, round body, and delivers an initial blast of dark roast coffee initially. Forward flavors are immediately followed up by a strong molasses and chocolate palate, with a deep, dark sweetness overall, and a slight hopping at the end of the flavor profiles. Cleans itself up very nicely, leaving a roasty and boozey aftertaste that has hints of fruit character. Very smooth, clean finish. Tremendous beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 30, 2011"

There is still some booze hanging around in the background which I imagine creates some of the heat that appears in the taste. Other aspects of the taste include dark caramels, slight molasses, and rich dark cocoa powder. This has velvety smooth flow, but there is a harshness that if removed would make this amazing. Overall this is a very good beer but it needs more time. I must say I enjoy it.","Vdubb86","Dec 04, 2011"

4.25,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"650 ml bottle. 2011 release. Pours a dark black with a small tan chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasty with dark, bitter chocolate. It has a bit of a floral hop presence as well. A bit of alcohol as well. The initial taste has some bitter chocolate, then comes a bit of coffee roastiness and a bit of hops. There is also some dark fruits, plum, and a hint of cherry. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and a hint of alcohol, but not nearly as much as in the nose. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. Low-medium carbonation. Great beer, especially when you consider the price.","jethrodium","Nov 28, 2011"

The taste is all roasted malt and chocolate. There is some anise and hop bitterness on the finish. Alcohol has already dropped since I first had this about six months ago but it's still a little hot. It is totally thick and viscous with fairly light carbonation. Really smooth going down. Can't wait to see this one develop further.","mikehblack","Nov 13, 2011"

The start definitely differs from the finish (finish is more bitter roasty taste while start is more bitter chocolatey taste) but overall I only got hints of three of four different flavors while it would have benefited from more! Overall, I recommend this brew and I would have it again.","MsRif","Oct 26, 2011"
4.35,0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Phantom Canyon Brewing Co. shaker. Thick, opaque black, reddish-brown around the edges, with a good three fingers of chocolaty brown head that receded to a mere ringlet about halfway through the session; soapy lacing throughout. Served at just about room temperature. Aroma rich with chocolate, roasted malts and coffee, with a touch of smoke. Luxurious taste of bittersweet chocolate balanced with a bit of bitter coffee, and subtle hints of smoke and and definite blast of alcohol warmth that perhaps is augmented when the beer is warmer. Thick and full-bodied, and very drinkable, if a bit on the strong side.","Rifugium","Oct 26, 2011"
4.72,8.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Split this bottle with a friend. It’s every bit the big, bad monster I remember it being. And oh so good. Pours a thick, solid black with very little foam but a big aroma of toffee, coffee, roasted chocolate on the nose. Tasty espresso and cacoa nibs on the palate. Black licorice? Oily, heavy mouthfeel. Deeply complex, like a multipart sympathy that hits every note. I let it warm, took my time, enjoyed every single sip. I’m not worthy!","elNopalero","Oct 26, 2011"
4.45,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"o: This is a big beer which needs to be taken seriously. The alcohol is not afraid of showing itself but it's a background presence and not dominant which I appreciate. A solid RIS which I'll seek out next year. And such a great value to boot. Perfect for a crisp, cool autumn evening.","Jaycase","Oct 22, 2011"

4.22,-2.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"22 oz bomber poured into a Sam Adams glass. Pours opaque black with two finger tan head, lacing is lacking for an RIS. Mocha and coffee aroma.

Overall this is a smooth complex flavored RIS.","coldriver","Oct 15, 2011"
4.4,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Overall: After all the RIS that I've tried, this is still a top-notch brew.

The SNPA of RIS.","JohnnyChicago","Oct 12, 2011"
3.66,-15.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall: It scores a little better because it is quite drinkable, and the hefty ABV is not detectable. But this is not the best version of Stone IRS/RIS I remember. Too much smoke, not enough excitement... it didn't wow me.","DoubleSimcoe","Oct 11, 2011"
4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel/Overall: Full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Pretty slick; good in this category. I would call this a very solid imperial stout.

But I definitely still enjoyed it and would have it again.","zhanson88","Oct 09, 2011"
4.22,-2.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O-- Not as cake like big as say Marshall Z is but this was big in feel. Big chocolate bomb in this. Glad I cellared this for a year. Long cellaring does wonders with this.

A year and a half of age has really tamed the beast, and right now its balanced mix of dark chocolate brownie batter sweetness and fruity hop bitterness is working beautifully. I'd probably give it a set of scores along the lines of 5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5. Terrific beer, and only $8.

4.45,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2011 Stone RIS poured into my Brooklyn tulip. Pours a pitch black, syrupy texture. Awesome brown/tan head, about 3 fingers. No light gets through this at all. Just black as motor oil. Smell- roasty, mocha, dark chocolate. Dark fruits, maybe some coffee bitterness. Taste- bitterness, roasty notes, dark chocolate, the alcohol is definitely here- not very well hidden, but I think I actually like my RIS to burn me every now and then. Something to hit you in the face and say "I'm a badass and you are a weakling". Back to the review...definite dark fruits and a warming alcohol presence. At the end, there is a bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel- this is slick, and although is a definite sipper, is nice and velvety. Drinkability- this beer is menacing, evil, and wants to impose its dark will upon you. I bought 3 bottles of this, and can't wait to see what it does after a couple years on it. Some of the alcohol heat will die, and it will be super super smooth.","lnashsig","Jul 31, 2011"

4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of Stone's best, The Russian Imperial Stout poured out as a deep thick black liquid with a brown foamy head on top. The lacing was very impressive here. The smell of the beer gives of plenty of roasted malts and chocolate, some hops, and even some sweeter notes from some dark fruits. The taste of the beer is packed with a heavy amount of malts and hops. The flavors evolve into a rich piney chocolatey combo with some fermented fruit in the far distance.

I reviewed this year's bottle release last week and was happy to get to try it on tap so soon after. There were clearly noticeable differences. For one thing the taste was more grainy/malty and nutty. The mouthfeel was lighter, more dry, and rather moussey--less syrupy than the bottled version. The lovely stout roastiness was dominant, of course; but overall, I'd say the taste was slightly weaker. Still, this is a terrific beer.","PhiloPsych","Jun 25, 2011"

The nose is incredible, a near perfect blend of rich chocolate, sweet, dark fruits, and a touch of tobacco. That great balance is lost in the flavor thought as the herbal taste of tobacco, and a bit of wet cardboard oxidation become a bit too prominent in the flavor blend. Milk chocolate as well as plums and figs and the like are still present, but a bit more subdued. There's also an unexpected but welcome espresso flourish to close things out. The mouthfeel is porbably the low point of this beer, as the body is too thin, and crosses the line into watery. At the same time, the beer is a bit undercarbonated. I've had experiences with less aged versions of Stone IRS in the past that I enjoyed a little bit more than this one, 2007's batch may have already peaked.","axeman9182","May 23, 2011"

Taste is very complex and wonderful. There are flavors of coffee, chocolate, toffee, molasses, cranberries, licorice, prune, and a slight dash of citrus. Mouthfeel is thick like heavy cream, slightly drying feel in the back of my upper palate. This beer sneaks up on you like a tiger, and the alcohol kicks your butt. From the first good swig, you feel the warming and it is a downhill rush after that. One at a sitting is surely enough, but the flavor is saying give me more.","beerprovedwright","Apr 27, 2011"

The nose is dark fruit, chocolate, coffee and some licorice at the end. The taste is amazing: Layers of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and again the licorice bringing up the rear. The mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety; the alcohol presents a slight burn but nothing to scream about. I would compare this beverage to a tasty alcohol-tinged chocolate cake. Overall, a great RIS which benefits with age. I have no doubt this would go great paired with a chocolate dessert - I'm thinking Chocolate Moose with a Stone IRS Bomber - MMM!","Hatzilla","Apr 24, 2011"

I will review it again when this year's release comes out. Pours pitch black with two fingers of roasted brown, frothy head. Decent lacing. Nose is mainly roasted coffee and brown sugar malt with nice cocoa and dark chocolate notes. A hint of alcohol can be detected as well. Very rich and full bodied mouthfeel but not too heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is right where it needs to be for the style. Malty sweet on the palate with a slight hint of alcohol. Bittersweet chocolate throughout, with a coffee and cream finish. The hops aren't quite gone either, keeping it from being too sweet and malty. Very drinkable for such a big beer.

Taste is perfect with roasted malts and coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, and faint soy sauce. There is a delightful bittersweet finish that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Carbonation is good but it seems a bit flat overall. Thick and creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is beyond exceptional. I am very happy I have been able to try their 5+ year aged IRS.

I've still got another '08, and based on this one, I think this beer can still go a few more years. That being said, I'm not sure if I like an aged version of this beer anymore than I do fresh, but if you're looking for something that drinks a little more easily and isn't in your face with intense flavors, then definitely lay a few down for 2-3 years, or more.

First gulp is full and intense, very warming. Loads of ripeness, rich, earthy, soaked currant raisin fig fruity, nice mellow roastyness and the slightest bitter edge cutting through. Images of smoke, leather, tobacco. Milky and voluptuous the palate with a slight chewyness and surrounded by a definite heft and warmth.

Your palate is met with rich heavy cappuccino flavors, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and hops manage to cut through leaving a lingering bitterness on the tongue.

Pours with a finger width, creamy brown head with a black body. Nice coffee aroma with a dash of nail polish/fusel alcohol. Taste is coffee and a lot of barely. Extremely nice creamy body, bitter hop finish. This is a great roasty, and slightly hoppy stout, with a few dark fruit esters. Alcohol is high, but I feel that it is over rated...Solid beer but not one of the best imperial stouts.

4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Reviewed from my notes. Pours a deep black and very opaque. There is a modest tan foam head that settles to a skim. Swirling the beer around left a filmy coat on the sides of the glass. I can smell roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate wafting off of the beer. It's a good mixture of sweet and bitter. The taste is of slightly creamy chocolate up front. In the finish is coffee bitterness and some effervescent alcohol. The flavor lets you know this is a strong beer. It has a creamy body. It isn't as full-bodied as some other stouts. There is a medium level of carbonation. There is a bit of coating, but not too much. Nor is it very sticky, which is nice. This is pretty drinkable as a single glass, and I think I could go through an entire 22oz bottle, but the strength and bitter finish are limiting factors.","ToasterChef","Aug 12, 2010"

4.2,-3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"From 2010 Vintage. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black with a two finger tan head that lingers for quite awhile and subsides to a minimal amount after awhile. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, coffee, chocolate, and bread. The flavor was of cream, malt, espresso, with a coffee followthrough. Upon warming up to just below room temperature there was a very strong aftertaste of bourbon associated with it. It was heavy, almost sticky, on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew from Stone. This was the first time I've gotten a chance to drink this one so it was a whole new experience for my palate. That being said, it was quite good but not what I was expecting to be #30 in the World at the time...

The first thing that hits my tongue is espresso and then some cocoa. It has a richness that I would think to find in maple syrup. Espresso flavors linger in the middle of the tongue. A little bit of alcohol but at 10.5, you gotta expect a little bit. Feels silky and rich in the mouth. A bit syrupy, but overall pretty amazing. Easy to drink with the 10.5 abv.

I have 4 others that I'm gonna age to allow to mellow out. The mouthfeel is amazing on this, and drinkability isn't too bad considering such high ABV.

There is a subtle sweet side tucked inside of this beer, caramel is dominate on the sweet side with a touch of vanilla powder.

3.88,-10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,3,"Limited Spring 2009 Release. This stuff is black. The fluffy dark tan head is the only thing that gives it away as to not actually being black. The head does dissipate rather quickly. I can't even discern color when held directly to my desk light. Lots of chocolate along with some strong coffee notes and hints of molasses. Only a hint of alcohol in the nose. There are also traces of dark dried fruits. Tastes of a smoky chocolate coffee. Alcohol is masked fairly well, but it is noticeable. Pretty good for a 10.5% RIS. That's what has kept me away from other RIS's such as Siberian Night, which I felt to be too alcohol forward. Oddly enough, I tend not to notice alcohol in high ABV strong ales or DIPA's. I'm also noticing a black licorice component as I get further into this. Creamy viscous feel with a fair amount of carbonation. Not typically a fan of this style, but I'm glad I tried this one. Nice sipper, but I could only drink it sparingly. The only knock that I have is that there is a building sweetness/richness that knocks down the drinkablity a touch for me. Unlike high ABV DIPA's, I'd rather have this in a 12 ouncer.","alkemy","Dec 22, 2009"

It is surprisingly smooth and palatable for a Russian Stout and could use a touch more body. The easy drinking quality of this beer makes it a good stout for people used to lighter beers. Due to the light carbonation combined with the perceived thickness I would give this style points and say it is a very enjoyable beer.

A lot has happened since and while I still like it, I don't find it as extraordinary as I once did. It might be part of the brew but certainly I have expanded my palate.

4.2,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"First off, the name to me is funny but a fitting, mocking style of names. Stone's Russian Imperial Stout, named Imperial Russian Stout, just begs for the chance to hear someone make the mistake of disorganizing the set of words. The beer pours a thick deep black with a mocha head that depletes into a brown soapy film with some lacing down the glass. The initial smell is a deep licorice, with some roasty dark chocolate. The taste of the beer is quite opposite, with a bitter black coffee and dark chocolate up front, and a licorice sweet with some alcohol heat on the back. It has an oily thick sweetness to it on the mouth. A very thick beer, perfectly low carbonation. Honestly, the 10% punch this beer packs is suprisingly masked. Stone comes across as a beer that pulls no punches so the lack of the alcohol heat is a pleasant surprise, although on second thought, such a drinkable beer at 10.5% is a touch sinister. Well played, Stone.","Lldeegan","Oct 23, 2009"

It starts too intense and a bit harsh, with sweet prune aftertaste and alcoholic warmth. It reveals nothing underneath. However, it then settles down into a more charascterful, more balanced and complex beer. It stays fairly intense, but not overly so, with strong charred leaves, strong alcohol, a bit rummy, slightly burnt prunes, some spice and leaves. It becomes much more drinkable at the same time.

The smell and taste were much more subdued than I was expecting. Coffee was present in both, but was fairly subtle. I was surprised at the subtly of this beer since Stone is so aggressive in other beer styles. I expected an aggressive coffee flavor. Instead, I tasted a rich complexity of coffee and chocolate balancing each other. It was suprisingly sweet and light even though it had a thick mouthfeel. It reminded me of a porter with more complexity. Dangerously drinkable for a 10.5% ABV. One really needs to be careful drinking this beer because the alcohol is entirely masked.

Poured nice and dark, nearly opaque, with a perfect coffee-like foam on top that was never-ending. The smell was absolutely sensational. Loads of sweet malty flavors, chocolate, nougat, caramel, vanilla and a slight smoky aroma. One of the most powerful aromas I've ever had in a stout, it just leaped out of the glass. The taste delivered pretty much what the aroma promised. The bitterness was more pronounced in the taste but well integrated with the malt flavors. The bet way to describe it is that it tasted like a Toblerone bar, midway between milk and dark chocolate with a nougat/honey biscuity quality. Full-flavored with a nice medium body. I couldn't find anything wrong with this beer. One of the best brews I've had in my life. As I said, I've only had the '06 vintage so I'm not sure how the new vintages will compare.

I have gone beer-less for four or five days so this is a nice beer to break the ice again. Priced at $7.69 at Midtown Liquors in Nashville, TN, it's respectfully priced for a beer with such a good reputation. Initially, the appearance is the best thing going. But I'm going to give this one time to warm up to room temp before I proceed on my review... Contrary to my wife, who believes all beer is the same, this Stone offering is an EXCELLENT example of an Imperial Russian Stout.

Ah utter bliss! They say don't let looks decieve you and this holds true with this beer! Very rich in the dark chocolate flavor with a fair balance of espresso to break through the boldness of the chocolate, smooth carmal flavors that flow over the peripherals of the tongue and a superb syrupy finish that coats the mouth.

I disagree with the back label's statement, as I don't feel any guilt/sin while tasting the ale, but I think it's to do with how mellow this bottled ale has turned into in less than a year's time~~ Compared with the other American RIS tasted recently (incl. Great Divide's Yeti, Flying Dog's Imperial Russian Porter, Left Hand's RIS, and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout), I find this one the most balanced amongst them all, as the hops seem to have melted in the magical mixture.

So smooth and creamy on the palate, balanced and flavorful. The roasted malt up front mixed with caramelized fruit and a threat of sweetness the never materializes. The finish is dry with lite hop bitterness. A beer so good you can't help but stare at the glass as you drink it, amazed by the goodness it contains.

Thick mouthfeel is viscous and chewy, becoming somewhat sticky at times. A year or two in the cellar should definitely improve the body, whose drinkability is lowered due to its behemoth nature.

The more it warms, the worse it gets. More cocoa and dark fruits in the taste, and again, loads of alcohol. The initial chocolaty sweetness turns to intense bitterness from heavy hopping. Slightly astringent as well. Warming alcohol-laden finish. Thick body with nice carbonation. Too intensely boozy to be very drinkable. This might have the potential to be nice after a couple of years, but a fresh bottle tastes like chocolate macerated in port with a few dabs of soy sauce added for good measure.

The brew is thick but not overly thick and filling. Carbonation is minimum and average for a good RIS and helps with the drinkability.

I'm guessing that not too many people in Isla Vista drink this stuff, so it was probably sitting there since the spring. Pours nearly solid black, but there's a little brown around the edges. No head, only some light brown lace. Sweet chocolate, vanilla, and almond aroma. Flavors of dark chocolate, prunes, roasted coffee. Doppelbockish. Thick and syrupy, but not overly so.

Nose is of rich roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffe, with hints of molasses. Taste is a little bit of a let down, i was excepting a little more bite in the taste, i don't know how much cellaring this beer hurt it. There is a strong taste of espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, but def. lacking the bitterness, I almost wish I would have drank this sooner, o well. It is pretty smooth on the mouth and is a silky velvet texture could be a little thicker though. The beer is listed at 10% and the alcohol is hidden pretty well, a sipper for sure just for the style.

A slot of roasty malt with a good amount of bitterness behind it. Bitterness in aftertaste is a bit much and as it opens up the whole drnk takes on a sort of bourbony, rum-soaked-raisins flavor. Good but not great. Mouth has a crisp carbonation bite, moderate viscosity and not too chewy like most RIS's. Its definitely good and quite tasty but you really need to be in the mood for it, its not something that could be enjoyed at anytime.

The taste and smell of this beer confirms that the appearance of this beer is not false advertising. Notes of vanilla dance in the perfect balance of sweetness and alcoholic strength.

A bit of alcohol. Taste is also good, medium-full, pretty rich, and rather sweet. Flavors like the nose. Ton of malt. Feels fine, but I'd prefer less carbonation. I'm going to score this lower on the drinkability scale, not because it isn't sessionable (which it's not, but what are you expecting from a RIS after all?), but because after I eventually consume the other couple of bottles of this that I have, I probably will not seek out again. Fun to try, but just not to my taste. A bit too sweet for how I like my RIS.","MacDomer","Apr 14, 2009"

First thing you notice is the fact that its so tightly concentrated that it almost burns initially (I'm sure that the 10% abv also has something to do with that!), and then opens into sweeter, chocolatey, burnt sugar notes before finishing with dark cocoa bar and roasty bitterness. We've all tasted these flavors in other stouts and porters, but few other beers can approach the sheer concentration of these elements that Stone somehow achieves.

I was amazed to get such an amazing taste and mouthfeel from a bottled stout. Many times, stouts are best suited to be poured only from the tap (like Guinness). The appearance is a beautiful black with red highlights around the rim of the glass. Beautiful brown head does not stick around, however. Taste and mouthfeel are freaking heavenly. Taste of prunes, pork fat (no joke), initially, and then chocolate all the way down. God damn it's a beauty. I can see why this is on so many want lists.

4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"First impression: With Stone, I was expecting a super-hopped imperial stout, and this is nothing of the sort. Dark roast malt that comes over as nice and sweet, without any real harsh burnt sensation (like charcoal that you get from some). The roastiness just lingers on the palate long after the beer is gone. Touches of coffee and chocolate, without either one particularly dominating. Something slinky lurks in the background, like a vanilla or sweet spice. Just enough hops for balance/cleansing, nothing more. Fantastic. Nice big body, very rich, if not super creamy, filling and cloying in a good way, yet slick and oily at the same time. Hides the alcohol super well, no burn, or even a hint of alcohol that high. Fantastic stout from a brewery that I'm not the biggest fan of, since I don't really care for super hoppy beers. This is sure to please all.","damienblack","Jan 24, 2009"

I have been milking this one for the past 90 minutes letting it warm to see how the flavors change. The pour resulted in a pitch black color brew with a limited but steady darker brown head that left nice lacing. The aroma is magnificent as the black roasted/burnt malt give off a intoxicating aroma of chocolate, dark fruit (raisin, dates) molasses and brown, slightly burnt sugar. Extremely inviting mixture along with a faint but present Alcohol smell. The flavor is very good, lots of burnt/roasted malts (not overly astringent) gives a thick but slick feel. Coffee, chocolate, dark berries come to mind. As it warms the flavors seem to come out even more, if that is possible mixed with a warming taste of alcohol with is fantastic. This brew aged extremely well, now I wish I let it age even longer but on such a cold night this is exactly what was needed!

4.85,11.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Limited Spring 2008 Release 12oz bottle. A thick, smooth Imperial Stout with phenomenal depth of flavor and a round, luscious mouthfeel. The liquid is opaque and black topped by a small but sticky dark brown head. The nose is rich with perfectly toasted malt. The flavor is vast and superior, in my opinion, to many fancily barrel-aged stouts, not that I don't love a good barrel-aged beer. Stone just manages to pack in massive toasted malt flavor without adding in outside complexity. The malt is mostly chocolate with some coffee on top of wonderfully burnt toast. It's not nearly as roasted as some Imperial Stouts but the roasted flavor is just right. There's still some hop bitterness without too much age on the bottle. There are a number of flavors that will take me a few more years of beer tasting to describe adequately. The feel is incredible, lush, smooth, thick but never cloying or sticky. It's a remarkably drinkable beer for the alcohol level and the depth of flavor. You just have to keep going back for more. I wish that I had a case of this stuff, and come Spring 2009, I will.

My first drink proved that the beer was too cold and i would suggest allowing it to warm slightly because it is only then that you can appreciate the caramelized sugars, dark chocolate, alcohol, but still could detect the malt and hops. I didn't think the mouth feel was as thick as the bottle described, but the texture and taste formulated a very drinkable beer.","SammyB","Dec 06, 2008"

Feels amazing in the mouth, thicky and creamy. The high abv (10.8%) is well hidden by the taste. I have yet to drink another stout that comes anywhere close to this one.","Vendetta","Dec 05, 2008"

The aroma is soft, and chocolate and roasted grains shine through. On the palate, espresso, bitter chocolate, and vanilla strike with force. The hops aren't very present until the very end, where it has a very mild, dry finish. This medium bodied beast could be a session stout, even though it has strength and body that rivals a Sherman tank.

Very nice aroma of ripe fruit, some raisins and prunes, also some caramel and chocolate, some alcohol evident in the nose as well. Hints of some ageing to with a bit of leather, smoke and meatiness in the aroma, though they are subtle and contribute to a very complex and enjoyeable aroma. Taste follows with a good dose of chocolate sweetness, some roasty smokiness towards the finish, and a bit of a bourbony alcohol bite in the finish. Some of the leather is also noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, somewhat syrupy up front, though not heavily so, and it is broken up by some bitter roastiness and alcohol warmth. Age has been good to this one and it could probably go a few years longer. The aroma is very delicious and quite complex, the taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma's promise but is very good nevertheless.

Hop bitterness on the finish. Medium to light on the body side given the style and gravity of the beer. Finishes with a drying hop and roast bitterness. Minimal alcohol noticeable.

Pours pitch black into my imperial pint glass reminds me of motor oil, very slick and thick. Large brown head that soon becomes nothing and leaves no lacing I expected this due to the very high abv. Aroma is fantastic blending sweet malts, dark roasted malts, licorice, and even smells like plums and raisins. The aroma also gives off an insanely strong alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best I've ever experienced, this is the fullness and thickness I've been looking for and a smooth finish to boot you can almost feel the alcohol evaporate before you ultimately swallow. Flavor is phenominal sweet fruity yet dark and bitter. Two opposites clash but yield a wonderful taste, if only that strong alcohol wouldn't kick so hard this is near perfect especially for this style. The licorice and dark fruits also repeat themselves in the taste. Surprisingly sweet and smooth this is nice on the palate, overall a truly wonderful creation.","kinger","Aug 04, 2008"

The taste in general is smoother and less sharp than younger Stone RISs. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and because of the age it has, this RIS is more drinkable than most.

Some hops add a nice bitterness to the mix, but never come close to taking over. Woody touch with hits of vanilla. Not as creamy as it could be, but still nice on the mouthfeel. Lighter body than I thought, but still definitely not light by any standards - it is an RIS after all. Suprisingly easy to drink.

I have seen some comments on an overly alcohol profile but I didn't sense it, at least in comparison to some other Russian Imperial Stouts. Yes, the alcohol is there and will kick your ass, but this didn't have the brandy/whiskey notes that overpowered the overall experience.

4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours pitch black with about a 1/4" of brown head that quickly fades. Aroma is chocked full of dark fruits, figs, raisins, plums, some light caramel maltiness, a touch of alcohol, and some very faint hoppiness. Flavor is complex with a vinous quality. There is alot going on here, some relatively restrained roastiness and a bit of caramel are first. These flavors are quickly overtaken by dark fruits (figs, raisins, and plums), which give this brew what, in my opinion, is a distinctly vinous feel. Some bitterness enters towards the finish to balance this brew out. The dark fruits linger in the long finish with a touch of roastiness, a noticable but not terribly significant alcohol heat, and a bit of malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied, with low carbonation. This beer appeared to be properly attenuated but at times it seemed a touch syrupy, though not at all sweet. Drinkability is pretty good, I certainly enjoyed it. Its a good representation of this style, complex and interesting but not quite all that I had hoped for. I'd be interested to see how it tastes with a bit of age on it, I think it may change for the better.

Is because the brewery itself is known for producing quality beers (this is the first one that has let me down, FWIW)?

The aromas are perfect: smoky, sourish malts mixed with strong fruits (raspberries) and coffee laced hops. I mean the smells are all over the map, but they are so wonderfully complementary that there really is a great unitary aroma. Taste-wise is also excellent with an incredibly savory bitterness that is a combination of coffee, mocha, espresso and wheat flavors. The mouthfeel helps aid in perfecting this beverage by making it very smooth on the palate. Its not light but any standards, but by making it almost milky with a medium carbonation, the flavors are able to express themselves quite well. By far, one of the best drinks I have had.

This stuff is very complex and spicy in a way with the high alcohol content but it wont overwhelm you as much as some of the lighter stone beers when i say lighter i mean that this has the highest alcohol that im aware of from stone but it doesnt seem as potent as a double bastard. anyways this stuff pours thick black and has a thick creamy head that tops off the amazing apearance and smells like coffee malt hops and some chocolate. And tastes like this also with some complexities i cant identify but id like to have a couple more bottles to really say for sure. This is heavy stuff for me i dont need more than one bomber at a time to enjoy it and trust me if you like stouts you will enjoy and probably love this one.I only wish i had the money at the time to buy another bottle or two.","calebmills","Apr 22, 2008"

What there is is roast and toast malt with some metallic copper alcohol smell. The roastiness comes out as it warms. A bit of coffee and slight hop fragrance. Taste is nice and smooth, roasty malts, coffee, vanilla, and alcohol come to mind, some dark dark malt flavors in here and a nice hop kiss on the finish. Not as hoppy as I would have expected for a stone brew, which is sort of refreshing as they tend to be a little bit obsessed, but still on the hoppy side (barely). A slight metallic astringency to it, and alcohol is a bit more pronounced than I would prefer. Vanilla flavor is apparent enough it has a bourbon aged hint in the middle. The alcohol heat is a bit strong fresh, but should mellow in just a year or two. Mouthfeel is good, but could be a touch more viscous, just a touch. Drinkability is good now, but will should vastly improve with just a little trip to the cellar. Overall a great imperial stout, maybe slightly overrated, but defenitely not one you want to pass up.

4.53,4.4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The nose is pretty awesome. Mellow with anise spice, milk chocolate fudge, a great blend of roast and coffee, this does also have a mellow port-like oxidation, which lends a little bit of a red-wine character. The palate opens moderately sweet, with caramel, toffee, tobacco, anise up front, along with some medium-dark chocolate. This just might be heading over the hill, as I'm starting to get a wee bit of papery oxidation/ aged thinness, but it's barely on the threshold of perception (IMO). What this means, though, is that this beer is near its peak. Medium-full in body, moderately carbonated, this is smooth and fluid on the palate.

The smell wasn't distinguishable from other fine stouts even though it claims anise and black currants. I don't know, maybe I have cerebral palsy, but I didn't notice those.

Aroma is of raisins, dark chocolate, and espresso beans. It's really complex as with most RIS's. Taste is huge up front with bakers chocolate. Slightly bitter. Then pours in the roasted (almost burnt) coffee beans and finishes with almost a Isles Scotch taste. This beer really is another amazing product that the Stone Brewery puts out.

Layers of coffee and chocolate, roasted grain, touches of oak and smoke finishing with a lingering bitterness. I'm thrilled this is not an overly hopped RIS, as I've come to really hate that. Overall, an incredible brew, one to really put up against my favorites: BCS and Expedition.","dreadnatty08","Mar 11, 2008"

I have to say I had very high expectations, not only due to the high rating of this beer but I am a huge fan of most all of Stone's offerings. This did not live up to those expectations and was a very mediocre beer. Pour was good, nice mocha colored head, dark as can be, decent head retention with some lacing. Smell was very disappointing. Stong smell of alcohol, particularly vodka which I found weird. Some smell of toffee and raisin, but mainly alcohol. Taste was of some coffee, chocolate, dark fruits but again a very sharp alcohol bite, especially as it goes down. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is great. Overall this was a good beer, but not great and not their best offering IMO. I was overwhelmed by the alochol presence and did not enjoy that.","bunnyhustle","Mar 01, 2008"

5,15.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This one pours BLACK like pitch with a thick tan head that sticks around for a while. The nose is roasted malt and coffee, fruitiness, nuttiness, and a bit of alcohol (hey, it's 10.8% ABV). The flavor is GREAT. It's a smorgasbord of roasted malt and coffee and chocolate and a touch of hop bitterness. Some people taste tobacco and if you look for it, it's not hard to find in there. Surprisingly, the alcohol is lost in the mix, despite being detectable on the nose. But even better than the variety of flavors in this beer is the balance. This is a truly exceptional Imperial Russian stout. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but likely thinned to just the right density by the high ABV. As filling as this beer is, drinkability is incredible, simply because of the superb flavor and mouthfeel. If you like stouts, you won't want to stop drinking this one. Highly recommended.","JWFokker","Jan 04, 2008"

The foam recedes at a steady pace leaving behind an impressive wash of sticky lacing. The alcohol in the aroma has faded a bit since spring. The first thing that hits the nose is the roasted malt character, a bit of bakers chocolate, a hint of coffee and a distant hop presence. The taste has mellowed a bit as the flavors have melded together a bit more. The alcohol isn't nearly as perceptible as it was 5 or 6 months ago. There is a robust bitterness that seems to be originating from numerous sources. Baker's chocolate, hops and coffee. There are dark fruit characteristics and a background sweetness that help to balance everything out. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth and somewhat oily with the perfect amount of bite. I really like this beer, but have been spoiled by a surplus of Speedways lately. This isn't quite on the same level, imo, but it's still one of my favorite stouts. I've got 10 more, and look forward to checking in on them a few times each year. It's really not even hitting its stride at this point.

Highly recommended if you're breaking into Imperial Stouts.

3.5,-19.4,4,4,3.5,4,2.5,"Looked great in the snifter with lots of carbonation clinging to the sides and a thick tan head, though this faded fast, as expected. Aroma was of sweet caramel, chocolate and molasses, with the characteristic roast and coffee smells as well. At first taste, earthy flavors in the front of the mouth gave way quickly to malty chocolate, followed by strong alcoholic warmth and a bit of herbal hop finish. I found that the malt intensity could be slightly overwhelming and out of balance (how else did they get a 10.8?) If I were Stone I would knock down the gravity just a bit to even things out. My drinkability rating was particularly low as I'm not inspired to knock this one back due to the combined alcoholic slap in the face and the overwhelming maltiness. Still, this is a very respectable and tasty beer in the style.","BabaJohn","Sep 04, 2007"

No matter, the 10.8% ABV is not really a factor here, unless ya like your beer to slowly sneak up out of nowhere and make it's presence known once it's too late to turn back. In that case, Stone has done their job wonderfully here and even though it's not hoppy like many of their well-known beers, it's just as good and worthy of it's own big bottle and limited release. Perfect for year-round quality beer-drinking sessions, or those who aren't afraid to get introspecitve with a stout. Highly recommended!","JerzDevl2000","Aug 29, 2007"

Feels full in the mouth with a perfect touch of carbonation. Smooth as silk and the alcohol is extremely hidden considering the high ABV.

Nose is lots of licorice, molasses, black current, spices, and a touch of light alcohol. Smells excellent. Somehow, the taste tops it. Coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, molasses, roasted malt, breadiness, and some light licorice. Body is full and creamy, with perfect carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, with a great flavor and body.

The flavors travel nicely through the sweet and bitterness, and ends with a wonderful smokiness. Nice, thick mouthfeel - perfect for the huge flavors at work here.

The taste is bitter, a lot more hops than I was expecting (though since this IS a Stone brew I suppose I should have known), with a strong coffee/toffee flavor, undercurrents of caramel and that same grape/currant flavor that I noticed in the aroma. Mouthfeel is very thick, but it seems like the carbonation and bitter hops keep it from coating too much. Personally, the 10.8 ABV on this one hit me like a load of bricks.

Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, some anise/black licorice, and some dark fruit - very nice. The taste is precisely what an Imperial stout should taste like, IMO - big dark roasted coffee up front segues into dark chocolate and a nice note of tart cherry & anise. The finish is dry and mellow. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick, but a could be a little richer. This is one mighty fine brew - very tasty and easy to drink.

As they so altruistically suggest on their label, "We recommend getting a case (of our expensive most expensive beer!) and opening a bottle every 3 to 6 months to enjoy it's journey." I opted for four, and will probably have 1 a year or so. As I often feel about young RISs, this was nothing that will have me clamoring to break into my stash earlier then I should.

Alcohol is a bit there as well, but not overpowering by any means. Taste, mmmMMM!!! Thick malty goodness dominates this amazing brew. Very mild hints of hops, but just enough to balance this one out just about perfectly. As this warms, it seems to become a bit sweeter with a more powerful roasted caramel presence.

I was fortunate enough to be able to taste the 2003 IRS the previous week, but they had just run out when I arrived today. They were also offering a 2005 IRS for growler fills only in the gift shop. The 2004 stout poured black with a creamy thick yellow-brown head and smelled of roasted brown sugar, alcohol, and dark chocolate. The taste was a little metallic up front, with notes of bitter dark chocolate, cocoa, black cherries, and woody hop. The beer finished roasty, with a powdery-cocoa, peppery tongue-numbing, and slightly syrupy medicinal finish. Despite finishing every last drop of the beer, the inside of the glass remained stained with a thick brown sugary glazing clinging all the way to the rim. A mellow-smooth relaxing buzz emanated from the 10+% ABV. I enjoyed a second 2004 IRS after brunch paired with the espresso drizzled cardamom coffee cake. Spectacular.","jletts","Apr 15, 2007"

Mouthfeel was heavy, but not too big on the alcohol despite the presence of it in the aroma. One bomber of this was more then enough for me. I have to say that im a bit disappointed by this release, as it is not as good IMO as the 05 or 06. Maybe a little ageing will complement this beer.

Smells is robust, salty, smoky, earthy, maybe some brown sugar, dirty coffee hints of caramel and that slight anise character typical in some RIS, but subtle and perfectly executed. Taste is big, chewy, meaty, yet immediately approachable. I get an excellent roasted flavor, colored by a nutty character that makes it sort of pop in my mouth. Bitterness is perfectly balanced definitely not as aggressive as some, but provides tasteful ballast. Mouthfeel is wonderful, well balanced, surly and big, yet so tasty and easy to drink.

Might not sound too appealing, but it really is once the other smells come out as it warms. Weak molasses smell and a big chocolate smell came out later along with a mellow anise/licorice smell. Tastes upfront of sweet chocolate with roast coffee beans and roasted but not burnt malt flavors. Almost perfect carbonation in mouthfeel, very smooth but faintly bubbly on tongue and creamy if left to hang around. Drinkability is excellent as the alcohol is well-hidden.

It pours thick and black, with a small, lightly fizzy orange/brown head that reduces to a collar, then fades away. It is quite aromatic, with dark and sweet chocolate, coffee, charred/burnt, nutty, smoked?, roasted, and sweet malts, tobacco juice, currant, blackberry, apple?, oranges?, other berry/tropical esters, and a bit of a lactic quality. Insanely complex. Just as complex on the palate, with cocoa, tobacco, leather, coffee, Jagermeister?, blackened/charred/burnt malts, roasted and vinous malts, plum, currant, blackberry, and green/piney hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is thick, fairly carbonated (thanks to bottle-conditioning), and incredibly smooth - swishing the beer in your mouth turns it into an almost milkshake consistency that you damn near have to chew. It leaves a long, roasted and hoppy finish and hides the alcohol surprisingly well (in flavor; you can feel it going down).

Dark, roasted grains, espresso, baker's chocolate, and a slight sweetness. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't knock me over. Palate is consistent with the nose, except the tastes are so intense they nearly overwhelm the senses. Incrediblly rich, thick chocolate, espresso, and dare I say ... tobacco-like flavors. Remarkably dry though all of this. There are hops in here ... never cloying. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. A man's beer throughout. All in all, incredible.

Taste is even richer than the nose lets on, hitting straight off the bat with an enormous malty sweetness that turns to roasty malt and coffee before leading off into the rich chocolate and alcohol finish. Leaves a slightly dry aftertaste, dry bitter roastiness paired with some warm alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, viscosity similar to used motor oil, slick and slippery on the tongue. Lower levels of carbonation, pairs well with the characteristics of the beer.

You can smell it when you pour it when you drink it, even when it's just sitting there. This definitely needs another year or two to age just to mellow out the alcohol in it. The color is rich and black and there is a roasted smell with the complements of coffee. The flavor is chocolate, at least what I could tell throught the hot alcohol flavor. Drinking this beer is like putting vodka in a stout and ruining the flavors of the stout. And I also think this definitely needs more hops added to it for bitterness just to balance out the sweet malty taste of it and the incredible alcohol flavor.

The smell of baking chocolate and roasted coffee beans predominated, with the taste being of bitter chocolate and espresso. There was very little carbonation and the mouth feel was at the same time heavy and silky, with very lttle carbonation.

Chocolate, burnt coffe, espresso, more chocolate, and warming alcohol; quite tasty and it really lingers. It has a nice thick mouthfeel, but it took me a while to get through maybe 5-6 oz.

Yes I just used that word but if you try the damn beer you will see what I mean. The Alcohol, though apparent in the smell, is masked well considering 10.8 %.

I just about cracked open my bottle of Old Guardian that I'm cellaring becuase I just needed a 'kick you in the ass and leave you for dead' kind of brew. But luckily I got ahold of a Russian Stout. The pour was slow and deliberate and it oozed out thickly to produce a nice head of tans and light browns, the glass completely impenetrable by light. I held the glass up in direct sunlight, and failed to see the sun on the other side....how fitting for this beer, so complex and complete it can block out the sun. I let the stout sit for several minutes to warm ever so slightly and took a whiff. Coffee, chocolates, a bit of an earthy tone and the flavors of heavily roasted malts. I prepared myself for liftoff, raised my glass and took a sip. Outstanding. Rich, smooth, thick, the mouthfeel was exceptional. Flavors of coffee, roasted fruits, alcohol, and malts. It is right up there with Old Guardian as one of my most favorite beers in the "Good God, how in the hell can this be over 10%abv" category.

It reminds me very much of Okocim Baltic Porter. Mouthfeel is smoooth, yet has a rich chewy note that sticks to the palate quite nicely. Drinkability is great for the high abv. This is a 10 abv?

It has a small dark tan head that leaves some light lacing. It has a bouquet of flavor that includes coffee, chocolate, spices and finishes with a light nutty scent. Wow Im not exactly sure how to describe the taste because of the many different flavors. It starts out with a clove/spice type flavor that lends way to a chocolate taste and then melds into a nutty coffee type flavor, although the alcohol is definitely present it hides the 10% quite well.

On the downside, the alcohol in this beer stings my mouth before I've even swallowed. It's too noticeable, from the time the beer's about halfway through my mouth and on through the following exhale.

It is almost like a syrup, it coats the palate and lingers there for sometime making you wanting more. Drink this beer slowly and enjoy one the premier beers in the world.","cameraman","May 17, 2006"

The gentle hops play off the moderate vinous taste. Alcohol is clearly present but is overwhelmed by a nice complexity. As it warms, green apple and vanilla notes make their prescence known. A giant among beers. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy. Drinkability is hindered because the alcohol does play prominently in taste.

This beer is very malty, with strong notes of semi-sweet dark chocolate, plus some coffee. But, it also has a stong bitterness (without an overt hoppiness) that defines the finish.

Intense raisin, black licorice, molasses and brandy character ending with a huge dose of anise and a hint of chocolate and coffee. All, somewhat put together by a well hopped profile and a cunning bitterness. Its a nice beer, no doubt, but to me, its too hoppy and its a little to fruity, thin and sweet.

The retention is excellent, holds a tight half-inch cap, but leaves only weak patchy lacing. Vinous dark fruit nose, with hints of bakers chocolate and cascade hops. The taste is boldy sweet at first, chocolate malt and roasted barley. Some fusel notes are perceived as it warms, but a dry, american hop bite in the aftertaste keep the ABV and sweetness in check. Finish is dry, but leaves some traces of fig/plum and a slight alcohol smack.

4.49,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Ahh the Stone Imperial Russian Stout. Always a good choice. Let's see how it has held up over the past 2 and a half years. Pours near black with a quickly dying half centimeter of brown foam that doesn't leave much behind. Just as expected. Swirling does bring back some foam. The smell hits me before I'm even finished pouring. Molasses, vanilla, raisins, coffee, rum, and oh so much chocolate behind it all. A hint of oxidation. Now to taste. The coffee and roasted grain bite first, you can really taste them on the tip of the tongue. Chocolate is there in force, as the smell suggested. Sweetness dominates in this beer after the initial bite - the molasses and dark fruit, especially raisins, really come through, with some vanilla as well. The sweetness is defnitely kept in check, however, by the harsh acidity of the roasted grain and coffee. Bittering hops are there too, but don't seem to play much of a role. Never does the beer as a whole actually become harsh. On the contrary, it is actually very smooth and easy drinking for such a big beer. Again, there is a bit of oxidation in the finish, but it is tucked in neatly behind the bitter coffee aftertaste and the chocolate. Very well blended flavors in this, one, but it's definitely a sipper. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for the style, and very smooth.","PatYoda","Oct 26, 2005"
4.62,6.5,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The first impression of this beer was the extremely dark body and dark head, with mild lacing. Even holding this up to the light gave little idea of color. It smelled of the typical roasty, chocolate, but was far more complex and very well balanced. The taste was also chocolate with hints of coffee, and one of the best balances of malts and alcohol Ive ever had. The smoothness was incredible, with minimal carbonation. It finished as good if not better than when I started it, what I consider a rarity among Imperials. This was drinkable to the very end. Overall, this was one of the best Imperials I have ever had. Even if youre not the biggest Imperial fan, give it a try, it might make you a believer.","sinistrsam","Oct 24, 2005"

About an inch and a half which diminishes to a nice ring of foam leaving lacing down the glass. Very impressive for 10.8% The nose is a symphony of aromas. Dark ripe fruits, unsweetened chocolate, with a faint roasted hint and some slight alcohol. Very very nice. Strong dark fruits up front blending seamlessly into a chocolatey bitterness with a strong alcohol warmth on the finish. This beer packs a punch, but does it with velvet gloves. You can tell the strength, but it hits you gently. Quite lovely, but it's going to take me the whole night to finish this bomber. Lovely thick and almost syrupy mouthfeel. Very minimal carbonation and smooth as silk. A very very lovely beer. I only wish I could get this more readily, I'd probably buy a case. Definitely something to cellar.

Moderate bitterness with a bit of hop flavour balances out the roasty malt and alcohol very well. This brew is full of dark malts, giving it plenty of roasty coffee flavour and a bitter chocolate. The alcohol flavour blends into the background along with a bit of acidic smoke. Finishes with just a bit of bitter dryness from the roasted grains with a fair bit of sweetness. Theres lots of alcohol warmth going down, but no harshness. Smooth and creamy, full bodied with low, well-integrated carbonation. Wow.

Some small smatterings of lacing were evident. It poured a thick almost motor oil like consistency. Aroma was of dark fruits, raisins, plums, and some roastiness. Alcohol in strong evidence. Taste was superb, one to sip, with all the above mentioned aromas figuring strongly as well in the taste profile. Thick and rich on the palate, with some chocolate notes I may add. This kicks your butt folks, I went right to bed after I had my bottle. More appropriate for a cold winter night but thankfully I had a coolish summer night to try it on.

Pouring forth from this dark bottle comes a fluid so deep, thick, and syrupy that pancakes are suddenly my deepest desire. The rocky, off-white head taunts me. I lift my glass to my nose, and am overtaken by a sweet caramel aroma, with hints of licorice, and sweet caramel. Visions of hop flowers enter my brain as I realize that the earthy character of this brew is more than palpable. The taste, where to begin? Hoppiness to the extreme, but a deep, burnt, chocolatey undertone hits me where it hurts the most: my palate. Undaunted, I realize that the complexities of this beer are too much to handle. I find many hints and flavors, all intermingling and forming a cacophony of sinful flavor in this hearty brew. Sip upon sip reveals nuances that had previously remained hidden. The balance between the hops and malts are striking, but just because there is balance does not mean that neither is too extreme. Both are in your face, both hit you like a ton of bricks, and both can decimate the palate if one does not respect this mighty beer. Smoothly it finishes, and is surprisingly easy to drink.

Some very subtle citric hops, a hint of coffee and a little alcohol. Almost sugary sweet like a milk stout. Hugely complex and intrigueing. Tastes of roast bitterness followed by that sugary sweetness that is evident in the nose. I absolutely love it. Sort of marshmallowy. Some acrid bitterness in the finish, along with some resinous hops. Very warming and alcoholic. This beer is a mouthfull, creamy and very thick. Mouthcoating is the word.

Smells of roast, chocolate, molasses, and alcohol. Tastes divine. Wow this is incredible. Starts sweet smooth molasses chocolatey before Ghengis Khan drives 1,000 screaming roasted barley grains through my mouth and down my throat. A detectable alcohol lays beneath these flavors and becomes more prevalent in the aftertaste. Super thick creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Further tastes reveal a great depth in the molasses flavor. Wet sweet to start with some fruits, but they are hard to identify before the roast appears. Plums or prunes and some licorice, too. The roast is dry and contrast with the malt in a nice power struggle. In the end, roast dry does win out, but the malt sweet hasn't completely given up the ghost. It's for this reason that I never became tired of this beer. I can't tell if I'm attributing some hop bitter to the roast character or not. If there are any hops here, they have settled. This is one fabulous beer. Many desirable flavors coming and going in an easy and well-blended flow.","mentor","Jun 03, 2005"

The first taste is a perfect follow-up to the appearance and smell; roasted malt, warming alcohol, heavy chocolate and java overtones. This is great sipping beer to cap off any day.

3.98,-8.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Black. It is black in the middle and around the edges. Even when I held it to a light there was no penetrating the dense liquid. Impressive. The head was a lovely brunette color. At the apex the tightly compacted bubbles reached about a half finger in height. The head retention was respectable; it faded to a skimpy cap, kind of naked in the middle with a bubbly collar. In my goblet this beer does look damn imposing. There was no subsequent lacing, which can be expected I suppose. Still it is a good-looking beer. The first sniff of the nose was a massive explosion of malty goodness. I set the glass down and exhaled. Ah, Imperial Stout. Only a prodigious stout could be so malty. I went back for more. Raw alcohol, completely unabashed, it is forceful and hot. Did Avery brew this? Thankfully there are *enough* ripe, dark, and tropical fruits to play with the heat for a while anyway. Continually smelling the beer after I poured it from the bomber, wore my tolerance of the booze smells thin. If the alcohol had a more complex aroma then, say, rubbing alcohol I might I have been more inclined. By the finish the beer returns to a chewy, sweet, coffee and chocolaty array of olfactory pleasing aromas. Random hints of burnt caramel. Plums. There is also just a tickle of sugar. Potency is bold enough, I want my big beers to scream; this one talks very loudly. Inviting even with the rubbing alcohol smells. The palate is warm and damn yummy. There is excellent depth. Sometimes alcohol heat detracts from the overall enjoyment of a beer. Rarely does a raw burn add welcoming effects. In this case the alcohol works, the heat adds depth to the flavors. Also it acts like a connective tendon between the muscular malt and the delicate fruit. I guess calling the fruit delicate is a bit of an understatement as it does come across dark and tropical with plums, raisins, peaches, and even some apples. Random spiciness. The meat and potatoes of this beer are the malts. Big, chewy, evil, tastes like coffee (spiked with brandy), chocolate that is semi-sweet, kind of chalky. I have nothing to complain about with the palate it is charming in an angry kind of way. Not perfect but very good. Imperial stouts should be bold. This one is. A little too raw? Id buy that. Still, it is very tasty, very complex but its lacking a little magic I think. Id like a little more roast, more char, and less warmth. Full/medium-full in body, amazingly creamy, silky mouthfeel. It is like swallowing liquid velvet. Low carbonation but it is fitting for this beer. I really like the mouthfeel. Maybe it could be a tickler fuller (I guess I want to drink motor oil) and a little less hot. But the absolute smoothness cant be ignored. It is drinkable, it needs to be sipped and savored. A tickle too raw maybe a theme is developing here. It is a very good Imperial Stout. Not perfection, though. More malt depth and less alcohol would be ideal. This beer makes me want to eat grilled meat and hearty cheese! I need to send a huge Thank You to meathookjones for sending me this long sought after beer.

A slight sensation of alcohol follows but it is pleasant and warming, not strong at all. Mouthfeel is gloriously thick. Drinkability is decent for a brew of this strength.

French roast coffee, scorched malt, dark fruit, toffee, raisin, black strap molasses and a big alcohol punch prevalent in the nose. Throw a lot of hops in there, too, but they're trying to keep their head above water like a mafia victim with concrete shoes that gets lost in the riptide. Malty, floral and sweet, with residual flavors complementary to that of almost any stereotypical dark ale; coffee, chocolate, dark, plummy fruits. But this monster does have some leafy and grassy hops manage to poke its head out like a prarie dog seeing if the coast is clear. Oops, the coast isn't clear, here comes the black patent malt monster. There's a mineral and salty background, not unlike Le Coq.

The smell is a sweet caramel/molasses with mocha beans. Hints of irish roasted coffee and toffee. Small tone of bananna as well. The taste was rich and full of mocha. The roasted malts was mixed with the powerful alcohol to create a monster. This is overpowering, but not to the point where it is undrinkable.

First smells that hit me were the bittersweet dark chocolate and the roasted coffee. After that notes of fruits and a touch of alcohol could be found. The taste begins with a bit of sweetness followed by the chocolate and roasted coffee. You get hit with the alcohol around the middle of the taste but not in a negative way and some fruity flavors as well. A nice bitter finish and this one lingers around a bit in your mouth well after you drink it. Mouthfeel is HUGE, a small sip seems to fill the mouth and it is so rich and creamy feeling.

4.57,5.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"2001 edition. Well, I've been rash enough in the past to scoff at Stone's beers, and the imperial stout style, deeming both of them as not-quite-worthy of all the heaping praise bestowed upon them. With this 3-year-old Stone Imp. Stout (Russian was on the label at that point), I am eating my words, or should I say, drinking them. And they're delicious. It pours a dark, dark brown (just shy of black) with the smallest head, belying the alcohol content. Brilliant aroma of chocolate and vanilla. The flavor is obviously enormous, with huge portions of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla bean. Undercurrents of smoke, spices, mocha, oak, wood, sherry, brown sugar, lightly burnt vegetables, slight anise, perhaps nutmeg, and black currants (misspelled on the bottle). Despite this bonanza of flavors, the beer managed to be somewhat mellow, and completely integrated in all aspects. None of the flavors jumped out and showboated; they all worked together as a team. However, the vanilla bean flavor was most noticeable on my palate, unexpected and supremely enjoyable. There was some lactic sourness throughout, and a big bitter coffee bite appeared towards the finish, but only for an instant. The mouthfeel was gloriously smooth, and not especially thick which surprised me. The alcohol was a big part of this beer, but perhaps from the aging it received, it was not at all out of place. The beer became thicker and stickier at room temperature. All in all, wonderful.

This is full bodied, no debating. One of the thickest beers I have ever had. Low carbonation, which is good in this case. Overall, GIVE ME MORE NOW! No doubt, one of the best beers I have ever had.

One of the most complex beers I have ever brought to my lips. Taste is more of the same, with the burnt sugar and raisin notes dominating and a bitter french roast coffee/bakers chocolate aftertaste. A warming alcohol feeling follows. This beer is incredibly thick - they compare it to Siberian crude on the bottle and I can't say I disagree. I think they should advertise this as the anti-Atkins - it probably has about 100g of carbs and every one of them is delicious. If I had to pick a beer to sustain me through a fast I would pick this one - it is as good a meal as I have ever eaten. Deserves every bit of praise that it has gotten.","ColForbin","May 28, 2004"

4.34,0,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Blind Tasting, thanks Jazz88 Black hue with almost no head, just a light brown ring. Aroma proposes a solid malt profile of dark chocolate and possibly marshmallows, perhaps a touch of salt as well. Bold grapefruity hops accompany this all. Up to now it's nothing special. In mouth, the malt profile is huge. Very full-flavoured caramel and brown sugar together with a profound grapefruity hoppiness. The difference is.. it works here, very balanced and intense at the same time. You don't realize how hoppy this is before a few sips. Mouthfeel is excellent, silky and full bodied with low carbonation. My main critics are the almost absent fruitiness and restrained roastiness. But as one who didn't particularly enjoy what he had from Stone, I was bound to recognize in a blind tasting that their imperial stout is world-class.

The only reason it isn't a 5 all around is that with that alcohol content, one and you're done...","euskera","Jul 10, 2003"

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"My favorite Stone thus far. As is the case with Speedway and Expedition, there is a rich body and sweet malt profile to balance the bitterness. I love the motor oil appearance, and the rich coffee-like mouthfeel. Certainly stronger and richer than Samuel Smith, but not as balanced or drinkable, IMO. However, I would rate this as good as any other imperial I've had, and if Stone ever becomes available in my area, this would be a regular purchase.","JohnnyDuvel","Jul 05, 2003"
4.63,6.7,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This stout pours midnight black. Opaque. As in absolutely no light gets through. A fizzy brown head sits atop the dark liquid, which is a beautiful sight. As the beer breathes for a bit, copious amounts of roasted malt, along with notes of triple-shot espressos, West Coast hops, and alcohol all seek attention from the nose. Taste is incredibly complex, with black currants, incredibly roasty malt, bittering hops, coffee, and alcohol all present. Mouthfeel is very nice and oily, but not overly so. For such a huge offering, this is the most drinkable imperial stout I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. The alcohol content is certainly there, but it never becomes overly prevalent. Overall, this is one exceptional imperial stout.","Jon","Jun 29, 2003"
4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"This is probably the darkest looking stout I've had. First scent to hit my nose as I uncapped this 22oz bottle was cocoa and espresso. Reminded me of an espresso gelato I once had. Very enticing aromas, from a deep black brew with a thin head resting atop. Chocolate, espresso, intensely roasted malts and hints of alcohol and yeast. Velvety smooth stout, extremely smooth and approachable with a slight dryness at the end. Superbly balanced and pure decadence. This is the best product I've had from Stone brewery. I drank this bottle at approx. 65 degrees.","BierReise","Jun 26, 2003"

This baby poured like 10W30 but had such a heavenly smell to it...hints of plums, chocolate and coffee without much carbonation. This sucker was black through and through, no light could get through whatsoever. I let it sit till it was just below room temp, took my first sip and was amazed. It felt like a thick syrup going down, then I tasted the chocolate and coffee flavors followed up by a huge yet incredibly smoothe alchohol flavor. This was a thick ass beer and it took my about 45-50 min to sit and enjoy the whole bomber bottle. This is one to seek out now and try, then geta couple more and cellar them!","Dmann","Jun 20, 2003"
4.67,7.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"Before I start my usual hyping up of the Stone Brewery, just stop me and leave the house and seek out this beer. This is not just any beer this is a beer to be experienced and relived annually like a tradition, only it saddens me to think about the batches from the last two years that have escaped me. This is the 2003 limited spring release, and I am in heaven simply heaven. Pours like crude oil (according to the bottle, but you must see it for yourself), honestly this beer is viscous and opaque it eats up the light that attempts to shine through it. Dark black body with the pleasant thin moccha toned head floating atop of this dark abyss. The aroma contains layers of light milk chocolate tones, dark roasted barley malt, hints of anise in the background, deep plum or any overly ripened fruit in a light brandy liquer all topped off with a light hopping of signature Stone hops to boast it's west coast roots along with an underlying nose of alcohol gracing my olfactory nerves. As the temperature rises so does the amount of alochol that shines through in the flavor of this classic Imperial Russian Stout. A creamy based chocolate/coffe presence along with sweet buttery notes that elegantly dance on my palate. An overall warming effect creates a sense of ecstasy, with notes of fruit tones and acohol notes that are in one word heavenly. Mouthfeel is full and heavy syrup esque, but goes down suprisingly very smoothly. Low carbonation that complements the overall quality of this beer, and definitely a one bottle at a time experience no session beer found here and none wanted from an Imperial Stout of any kind.","WVbeergeek","Jun 20, 2003"

The head goes away quick, and there is no lacing. The smell is a sweet malty flavor of coffee and spices. The taste is just fabulous. Hints of chocolate and toffee under roasted coffee and caramel. There is just the right amount of hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is just awesome, very heavy. This is still a drinkable beer at 9.47%. A really great example of an imperial stout!","SheepNutz","Jun 05, 2003"
4.08,-6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"With a beer that swallows all light, Stone has outdone itself with this fine interpretation of the style. I wondered if I should have dared to be selfish enough to take on the entire 22oz rather than share it with a friend; I perservered through the guilt. Black as the ace of spades, the beer pours thickly and smoothly with a consistency reminiscent of the bottom of a coffee pot lined with spent grounds. Atop sits a fluffy, dark brown head. A whiff of chocolate-coffee sweetness and alcohol are apparent throughout the beer's pint-plus lifespan. A soft-silky mouthfeel encompasses the tongue while yeasty flavors with roast coffee and dark chocolate nourish the senses before the smooth liquid drapes down the back of the throat. This is a delicious treat on its own or for dessert. It kept me warm and filled my belly - enough to where I wished I didn't eat the meal I did before hand! - and would pair perfectly with chunky chocolate chip cookies (which would probably stand straight up in the tasty stuff). Stone's Imperial Stout is an excellent flavorful beer that was easy to put to my lips and yet one that's best to take time with. Can't wait to taste this vintage once it's been cellared for a year.","Mess","Jun 02, 2003"
4.35,0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A monster, indeed. Im really curious to see how this beer tastes in a year. The flavors are not at all rough or segregated, even at this VERY young age. The beer flows seamlessly from the glass into the mouth, creating a uniform, though thoroughly complex flavor profile. Kudos again to the boys at Stone for not only brewing massive beers, but brewing beers with flavorsome substance too.","TXHops","May 27, 2003"

I found myself swirling this viscous liquid around the glass and watching it cling to the sides of glass like Jager. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a hint of spice. This was nice and fresh and should age very well. I tried like hell to sip this one, but it knocked me on my ass anyway. But it was in a good way.","irishmoss","May 19, 2003"

As I pour it in my Stone pint cup (hehe), I can see nothing, what i mean is the shadow it places as I set it next to me on my desktop proves a real deep dark caramel coffee color that gives reason to what is packed in this stout. The smell is rich raisin, deep malt and hints of coffee, Ahhh. The taste is a major kick in the a$$ with full flavor you would want to keep in touch and never let go. Some hints of black cherry and dates are also present. I would slowly savor the combination blast of this wholesome treat that i can see it to be addictive to my stout loving ways. Chances are I would even pour this on my ice cream for that fruitful candy taste. In all this is what I call delicious, maybe this is not the way to describe such a brew, but I can assure this to myself, this is clearly hands down one great Imperial Stout.

Had a real thick head on it at first, but then quickley subsided. The head was a real reddish brown color, and started out like an inch thick. The taste is that of dark coffee, some fruits(grapes), and chocolate. Kinda taste like a fruity chocolate espresso, which is kinda wierd to me, but I like it. It starts out smooth and finishes smooth. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 on drinkability, was due to the fact that it was so rich. Give it a shot, you might like it.","JISurfer","Jan 05, 2003"
5,15.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer is black, and pours with a minimal, but dense brown head. No color can be seen through this beer, it is so ominously dark. This may be to foreshadow the evil effects it will have upon your opinions of other beers. The aroma smacks you hard with chocolate, malt, hops, and some plum fruit. All distinct, but yet one aroma. It's as if this beer transforms it's smell continously to mesmerize it's victims. Upon sipping this silky smooth liquid satin (or is it Satan), intense plum, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors bind your tastebuds. Assertive but well balanced hops secure the knots as this deliciously evil brew takes you hostage. You are assaulted by such intense flavors that it is impossible to distinguish the beginning of one from the end of another. Now completely given in to the power of this beer, you have no choice but to drink every drop of it, and immediately search out some more. Beer may never be the same. I'm not even sure this was beer.

4.45,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"To me this beer is cast and mold for the style. The color is so dark no light can escape it and it sports a deep tan head. Chocolate malt dominates the aroma with a bit of coffee in the background. Chocolate and black malts are front-n-center in the taste with citrusy hops providing balance but utimately being overshadowed by all the malt. This brew exhibits more fruitiness than other imperial stouts I've tried. Roasted barley comes on late but takes a backseat to other flavors. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy.

Coffee, molasses, dark chewy malt, you name it, its in there.  And did I mention thick?  You could just about spread this on toast with a knife.

5,15.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This one has been waiting for me since last year. This is the Spring 2001 release, which is labeled as "Stone Imperial Russian Stout". Pours almost like the bottle jokingly suggests, like used motor oil! This is the darkest black I've ever seen in a beer (if varying degrees of darkness in black are even possible. They seem to be, when used in describing beer, so I'll go with that). It just refuses to let light through. Creamy dark brown head, but not much of one. Still leaves some lace. What a delicious aroma! I am thoroughly impressed. Very sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee cream, even a bit of cherry, along with underlying roasted coffee character. In one word, the aroma says "cream". Makes you want to jump right into tasting this, however, you still can't help but savor the aroma between each sip. On to the palate, very sweet malt with spicy alcohol accompaniment appears first, coating your mouth with a caramel sweetness. Roasted grain and chocolate with some hints of coffee come next. Some of what I'll call "dark fruit" flavor as well, including more cherry character. Hops don't come around much, which surprises me, this having come from Stone. This could be due to the aging. Of course, that's not at all a bad thing! As I expected, a very creamy mouthfeel. What an experience this beer is! Definitely a must-try for anyone who can get it! Great one to cellar, too.","hyuga","Sep 23, 2002"
4.57,5.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,4,"The virtually jet black hued and opaque brew is topped by a dense, thick, rocky, light brown head that quickly recedes into a thin layer.  Sparse lace is left.  The highly appetizing aroma is comprised of oaky woodiness, carob, dark chocolate, deeply caramelized dark fruit... roasted grains coupled w/ esters and subtle citrusy hops have had a synergistic effect on the aroma... the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  The rich malt profile is dominated by buttery dark chocolate and sugar coated nuttiness, with roasted barley bitterness lending a bittersweet undertone.  Hop bitterness, although secondary, sufficiently balances the residual sweetness, leaving the deeply chocolately malt character intact.  Full bodied w/ a highly dextrinous and viscous mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a hint of spicy alcohol and with more mellow dark chocolate lingering.  Soothing alcohol warmth emerges after a seemingly long deliberation. Stone Imperial Stout is a tremendously flavorful and rich brew.  I only wish I had waited until a cold winter night before drinking this fine beer.","marc77","Aug 12, 2002"

It has a terrific fruity sweetness without the pronounced roasty flavors of some other imperials. Chocolate flavor becomes more noticeable as it warms.

Strong chocolate malt aroma mixed with alcohol, figgish sweet fruit and alcohol.  Toasted wafer flavor, well-balanced between malt, alcohol and hops.  It took me several hours to drink it, which is impressive.  The flavor changed but sustained throughout.  A very tasty imperial but I still prefer Brooklyns.","Andy","May 24, 2002"
