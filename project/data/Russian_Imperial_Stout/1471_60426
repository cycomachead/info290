Aroma is of rich caramel, sweet bourbon, oaky wood and big roasted malts. Flavor is big bitter roastiness up front with a dash of coffee, then it hits with a wave of sugary sweet bourbon, toasted oak and finished with some roastiness and caramel flavors. Definite waves of flavor with this one. This one is full bodied with medium-light carbonation and a slick oily feel. Up there with the great class of BB stouts, very nicely done.","stephenjmoore","Mar 25, 2015"

I tend to not be a huge fan of the bourbon barrel brews but Dark Horse did this one right. The aromas and flavors are never overpowered by the bourbon, they're complimented by it. The mouth feel is a thick syrupy brew that coats the tongue and warms the face. The start is a heavy maltiness which fades quickly into a slightly bitter coffee and finishes with an ever so slight bourbon punch. The fingers on glass tell me this one is going to kick my ass! Really outstanding brew from dark horse","Misfit2209","Mar 01, 2015"

Not as much bourbon as some other barrel aged stouts but the flavor goes amazing that you get from it. Smooth nearly oatmeal stout mouthfeel. Would love to try this fresh and as my first beer.","Flight317","Dec 11, 2014"

A sipper for sure, the brewers took great care to not let alcoholic heat thin it or add too much bite, the body's richness and thickness or its robust fullness to get too sickeningly heavy or slick, and the sweetness to overcome the balancing dry notes that keep it in check. This is one of the silkiest, most smoothly slowing brews I've yet had the pleasure to drink.","Brenden","Jun 05, 2014"

4.42,-2.9,5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Big thanks to BA Dan for getting me this. Pretty sure this is a 2012 bottle. Appearance is dark dark black with a little caramel head. Nose is huge, bourbony, with a slight offputting sourness. Taste is sweet up front, a little roasty, with some bitterness. Nice lasting bourbony finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full. Overall it's above average for a BBA stout. Sourness notwithstanding, it's a nice piece de resistance to Dark Horse's stout series.","foobula","May 04, 2014"

The base beer Pt5 is already a great beer and the barrels add a nice integrated presence adding to the complexity and flavor. From my experience I prefer this beer fresh as it's still incredibly drinkable and hasn't lost any of it's flavors. If you do want to age it a couple years it will still hold up with the best of them, except maybe lose a little bit of the base beer flavor.","jaasen64","Apr 27, 2014"

Finishes with some milk chocolate and a good dash of bourbon. A ton of aggressive flavors in here, but none of them really take charge, which is nice. Instead, they all meld together, held intact by a velvety and just a touch slick mouthfeel. Really well executed.","notchucknorris","Apr 23, 2014"

Dark chocolate, dried dark fruit, oak, and bourbon on the nose. An explosion of flavor: dense dark chocolate, scorched malt, dried black cherries, hints of prune and raisin, mild vanilla, charred oak, all capped off by charred oak and pleasant, warming bourbon booziness. Full bodied, low carbonation. Ridiculously smooth, creamy and velvety mouthfeel; as close to perfect as possible. One of the most balanced barrel aged imperial stouts I've ever enjoyed.

Complex aromas of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, molasses, and dark chocolate. This is one of the best BA stouts I've ever smelled! Smooth dark chocolate hits the front of the palate followed by caramel,vanilla, and dark fruits. The bourbon isn't as pronounced as in other BA stouts and it's extremely smooth and mellow. As it warms the chocolate really comes out with hints of toffee and molasses. Finish is chocolate with a hint of bourbon heat. Full bodied and incredibly smooth. Not much carbonation to speak of. Sweet finish. Overall, this is the best example of a bourbon barrel stout I've yet had. Simply outstanding!","JohnG190","Jan 12, 2014"

Head is a crown of caramel bubbles which settle along the edges of my snifter. The smell is dark chocolate, coffee, burnt vanilla and a musty bourbon. Despite the variety of flavors, everything seems somewhat muted. I appreciate the aggressive (but well integrated) taste of bourbon in an aged stout, but that isn't the case here. I'm just a bit disappointed, and as it warms I get a bit more bourbon, though not as well integrated and a bit fusel. The taste is something I can appreciate. It's smooth and mellow. No alcohol burn, and a nice roastiness. Mouthfeel is silky but a tad thin. My bottle says its 11% despite the description saying it should be 14%. I attribute the thinness to this. This may have been a thicker beer, but this version is definitely a lot lighter on the tongue. Overall, I'm happy to try this. I am starting to realize rarity can elevate a beers score, but in this case the beer gets the job done and I am more than happy to enjoy it. Cheers.","PlinyBeMiney","Oct 20, 2013"

Then I was given a second chance. Pinch me. Anyway, this stuff pours a bedevilingly dark and murky black-brown topped by a short finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises bourbon, roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, light wood, a touch of booze, and the faintest hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, everything colluding to effect a luscious melange of bourbon-y, chocolate-y, and roast-y tastiness. The body is a light hefty, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, this is still one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever come across. Perhaps the beer gods will smile on me again in the future...?","TMoney2591","Sep 27, 2013"

Just the right amount of fudgey goodness paired with just right amount of barrel from the bourbon makes this beer ridiculously easy to drink . If you can't make it to 4elf, i'll let you in on a secret. Hit the brewery any time of the year and pay the money for the tour, you won't be disappointed.","WesM63","Aug 29, 2013"

4.04,-11.2,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"The stout had a mild bourbon aroma with malts lingering in the background. For a 14%ABV, I was anticipating a stronger bourbon aroma. In the initial taste, I detected vanilla, malt, bitter dark chocolate, burnt malts, and perhaps dark fruits. However, the taste just seems to end there with malts. There is a warming nature to the aftertaste, which one might find quite pleasant. In terms of taste, I just do not think this beer finished well. The thickness of the mouthfeel allow a sort of vacuum of malt which led to nothing more. For such a bold style, I expected more taste, and it just was not there.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 07, 2013"
4.14,-9,5,4,4,4.75,4,"Pours a dark brown, motor oil color with some tan lacing. The aroma leaves something to be desired. Although the normal constituents of bourbon are present on the nose (i.e. vanilla, oak, etc.). There's a faint ""saltwater"" aroma as well, which is a little disconcerting. The taste follows the standard bourbon profile, with big burned elements and a heavy alcohol warmth throughout. The mouthfeel is pleasant, although I wish it was slightly thicker. The finish leaves something to be desired, as the big flavors from the initial taste disappear rather quickly, leaving only the burn. A solid brew from Dark Horse, but I'm a little let down.","tbdkev","Jun 07, 2013"

It's a little sweeter which I expected, but it has so much more coffee presence and so much less bourbon. It really reminds me of KBS, which is not a bad thing at all but the first time I had it it reminded me of Parabola. I'm putting this one down as a beer not worth aging. It's delicious in its own right still, but I enjoyed it so much more fresh. Still a solid barrel-aged offering from Dark Horse, and one of the better barrel-aged stouts floating around in my opinion.

4,-12.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of light dry roasted malt notes with some black chocolate notes with medium bourbon notes with some vanilla undertones. Taste is also dominated by creamy black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt. Body is full with creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not as complex as I was expecting but very well balance overall with chocolate and bourbon creating an efficient mix.","Phyl21ca","May 06, 2013"

They are all extraordinary brews, but the thing that really sets BB Plead the Fifth apart is the incredible smoothness of the bourbon. Not ONCE, not even after warming up for nearly an hour, does the bourbon ever seem any bit stronger than ""warm"". So incredibly smooth and complex. Fantastic integration of the barrel flavors with the base beer as to not mask or hide any of the substantial flavors, either. Probably my favorite Bourbon Barrel beer.

This beer was black it had a brown head that was faded quickly but left a ring around the edge of the glass. The look of the beer is pretty typical for the style. The smell of the beer is surprising to me, I expected the barrel aging to stand out a lot more on this. There is some vanilla on the nose along with some other sweet aromas. The taste of the beer is also really subtle. I was surprised by this, Really thought you'd be able to get much more intense flavors of the barrel and the bourbon. It's a great tasting beer regardless. The mouthfeel is thick and gently carbonated, it's a very smooth beer. Overall it's much more balanced than I expected, it's a solid beer from start to finish. I would have enjoyed a little more bourbon on it though. It's good but I don't feel it's worth the 100% rating on here.","Knapp85","Feb 19, 2013"

Aroma of chocolate, sweet molasses, dark fruits, roast, and something off that I am not a fan of (similar characteristics to Tres). Thick viscous mouthfeel with medium low carbonation. Heavy dark fruit up front followed by lots of dark bittersweet chocolate. Slight booze, but don't get much of the bourbon barrel in this. Was expecting a bit more vanilla oak, though my palate might be tainted from the Kuhnhenn BA 4D I had right before this. I tend to prefer non-fruity stouts, but this is generally well done. Relaxing sipper. I find it strange that the regular version was so full of roast and chocolate and this one went more fruity despite the barrel.

Thick body with a creamy smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. A big thick stout, one of my favorites of the day.","johnnnniee","Aug 16, 2012"

Maybe a little more retention would've been nice, but I didn't expect much from such a high octane beer. Aroma of dark malts, moderately roasty, dark chocolate, heavy bourbon. Dark sweet malts in the taste, chocolate chips, toasted marshmallow, heavy yet smooth bourbon with notes of vanilla and oak. Full body, creamy and delicious, a great sipper. Not quite as smooth as a nicely aged BCBS, but a great brew nonetheless.","Rifugium","Jun 09, 2012"

Served from bottle into a Ommegang Three Philosophers chalice. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised roasted malt, sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, raisin, vanilla, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. The aroma on this one was really quite nice and very complex. All of the right components for the style were present in this one. The barrel really did a nice number on this brew as the regular version was quite good, but this turned that up to 11. The flavor was very well balanced and inviting making it quite easy to drink despite the high ABV. This could definitely get you in A LOT of trouble if not careful.

T has some fudge brownie to it, LOADS of chocolate. That said, there isn't much bourbon at all. The flavors are really smooth and chocolaty. Again, loads of chocolate fudge and brownie. There is barely any bourbon at all and moderate roast. Great flavor on the chocolate standpoint, but disappointing in terms of barrel aged imperial stouts. This is the most palatable chocolate I've ever experienced in a beer. It is pretty light in body, compared to others of the style. I would describe it as a light medium. It does however increase drinkability. Overall this is a very nice beer, but doesn't show the bourbon you would expect.

The nose and taste both had a ton of bourbon and chocolate, with the nose having more chocolate and the taste having more bourbon, though for 14% it isn't overwhelming.

Poured into a snifter the chocolate brown head dissipated quickly leaving no head to speak of, but major alcohol legs were present with each swirl of the glass. Smell on this was great. I must have looked like a junkie with the deep inhales I kept finding myself taking. Lots of deep roast espresso, dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Taste was even better. The integration of the bourbon into the base beer was exceptionally well done. This beer was exceptionally well balanced with great bourbon flavors present, but at no point did it overwhelm the stout. Nice coffee, roasted malt, and smooth bourbon on the tongue, with a great charred oak character right there. Vanilla became ever more present as the glass warmed up. I also got a hint of campfire type marshmallow. All of this had a great coating effect on the palate. I could drink this all the time. Definitely worthy of seeking out, and making efforts to go to tasting events to get a chance to try. Highly Recommended!","smokeypeat","Jun 12, 2011"

This is one of those few beers where the heat is well-incorporated in the flavor profile, mostly thanks to the huge body .Not as much soy on the palate, as the nose might suggest.

The smell was of bourbon, oak, and a well balanced malty sweetness. The taste was of bourbon and oak first with a very slight roast barley bitterness. This faded to a bourbon vanilla sweetness that coated the mouth. Finally, it finished with a bit of alcohol heat, but not too much, especially considering its high ABV. The mouthfeel was thick and rich, coating your whole mouth leaving a malty sweetness that lingers. For a beer this big it is surprisingly drinkable.
