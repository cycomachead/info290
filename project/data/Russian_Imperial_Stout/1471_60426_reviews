"Phenomenal beer. It drinks just like BCBS, but with a little less bourbon."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle, 750ml, 2010 vintage. Black pour with a small tan head. Bourbon and chocolate nose. Vinous with big cabernet, deep roasted malt, and bourbon notes. Good, but maybe not what the brewer intended"
""
"Pours a very thick, oily looking dark brown and settles into the glass with a very dark brown body and a frothy, mocha colored head. Aroma is of rich caramel, sweet bourbon, oaky wood and big roasted malts. Flavor is big bitter roastiness up front with a dash of coffee, then it hits with a wave of sugary sweet bourbon, toasted oak and finished with some roastiness and caramel flavors. Definite waves of flavor with this one. This one is full bodied with medium-light carbonation and a slick oily feel. Up there with the great class of BB stouts, very nicely done."

"Overall this is a big tasty beer, alcohol is pretty hidden for 11% but the bourbon makes itself known with all the wonderful barrel characteristics, I prefer the barrel aged version over the standard Plead the 5th, glad I got to try this"
""
"I absolutely love this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Needs more bourbon character, and very sweet. However this is delicious as it warms and is certainly very nice"
"extra silky like they added some extra oats in there.  made it so much better."

"O: unbelievable - and I'm not a huge fan of the non-BBA version, so this was totally unexpected - blew me away - if you dig that full-bodied, rich, lush bourbon barrel stout experience, then this is for you. One of the better BBA stouts. Highly recommended."

"Finally cracked this one open after holding on to it for a few months. Wow is this a surprise. I tend to not be a huge fan of the bourbon barrel brews but Dark Horse did this one right. The aromas and flavors are never overpowered by the bourbon, they're complimented by it. The mouth feel is a thick syrupy brew that coats the tongue and warms the face. The start is a heavy maltiness which fades quickly into a slightly bitter coffee and finishes with an ever so slight bourbon punch. The fingers on glass tell me this one is going to kick my ass! Really outstanding brew from dark horse"

"Overrated. I was definitely dissapointed. I thought that it literally smelled like nothing. I couldnt even detect bourbon on the nose and 2.5 may actually be a bit of a generous rating. As far as feel goes, it is thin. As far as taste goes, its all bourbon. i really can't taste much of the stout-ish qualities to it. It was like a completely different beer compared to the non BA version."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very nice and up there with all the other great BBA stouts. Hard to say which BBA stout form Michigan is the best as there are so many great ones you can't lose."
""
""
"I'm not a mega fan of Pt5 so this to me was ok, too much roastiness for my liking"
"This was every bit of a sought after barrel aged impy stout."
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding."

"this beer was good a lot of boozy tones.  big chocolate cherry malt with bourbon, chocolate cake as it warms.  I think it could've sat for a year"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very well made bourbon barrel stout.  Sweet but nicely balanced with a bitter finish that lingers nicely.  Truly worth seeking out, nose made me think this was going to be a little one dimensional but it is really complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is very, very good. The great dark malts with chocolate and coffee interact with the bourbon barrel very well without overpowering the malts or becoming to aggressive to be enjoyed. I like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty great stout but falls very short of any live bourbon character. Tastes like it's all had some age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Dam fine BA stout.  Not much room for improvement here.  Could maybe use a hint more bourbon if anything, but this is for sure a top BA stout.  Look forward to each year's batch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This, my friends, is a lovely beer that I will be happily standing in the Michigan cold to procure at the next release.  More balanced of a flavor than BCBS, but just short of the mark in the other spaces.  That's not to say I wouldn't hunt for another bottle..."
""
"Like others have said I feel the 2014 needs to age some. Pours dark and had a nice thick constancy. Just felt the barrel aged flavor was weak and tasted like breakfast stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had the 2014, seems a bit hot, can use some aging"
""
""
"Wow.  Blown away.  What an amazing beer.  The base beer is really amazing, and the bourbon barrel aging just takes it over the top.  A bit thin on the mouthfeel, but other than that, absolutely perfect.  I accidentally spilled a few drops on my sweatshirt, and for the rest of the night, I smelled chocolate brownies.  It was unbelievable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Damn this was on point.  My first Dark Horse offering and Im impressed. Need more immediately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All of the characteristics of a bourbon barrel stout are here but, there is an out of place and unpleasant herbal aftertaste. I'm not sure if the age of this bottle is an issue but, I am underwhelmed with this offering."
"O: Almost perfect. It's everything you could ever want in a bourbon barrel aged Imperial stout. It's such a delicious sipper in its own right that I fear any attempt at a pairing would only bring it down. Truly a stellar brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 was better, but the hints of bad fruit and ash are there to be tasted."

"Amazing beer, can't wait to try another one in a year."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is now one of my favorites, glad was able to get some this year... great BBA smell, taste, just overall really, really good... a must try if you like BBA stouts."
""
""
"I don't what anyone says, I think this is one of the best if not the best BBA stout out there."
""
"Notes of dry fruit and cherry. Tastes sweet and smooth with a nice balance of molasses and chocolate with some bready character. Glad I got a few this year!"

"Had this one a bit later in the night which is unfortunate. It was scary drinkable at 11abv and likely my favorite beer of the night. Not as much bourbon as some other barrel aged stouts but the flavor goes amazing that you get from it. Smooth nearly oatmeal stout mouthfeel. Would love to try this fresh and as my first beer."

"Was a lot thinner than I was expecting. Not much to the aroma. Taste was good, but lacking what I'm looking for in a BBA stout. Was really excited for this, but let down. Could be partial palate fatigue from the Black Tuesday before it though."

"Caps leaked, damaged plastic seal inside cap, sent email to Dark Horse and called twice with no resolution, i like the base beer and i like barrel aged beer, but i dont like poor quality control that leads to flat beer with no attempt to remedy the problem"

"truly delicious, and enormously better than the base beer. this is perhaps the greatest improvement from base beer to barrel aged edition i have ever seen, not that there is anything wrong with the base beer, but that its not so outstanding and one of a kind as this variant. beautiful stuff, high luster dark brown, with a milky thick mocha head. the nose isnt all barrel, but that vanilla sweetness is robust. it pulls the bitter out of the base beer and balances it brilliantly, all united in oak. i get some coconut and some dark chocolate in here in the taste, even some dark fruits, maybe dried cherries for a minute, before the bourbon slowly starts to take over the palate. amazing how mellow the alcohol is on this, especially considering its not all that viscous compared to others in the same style. the finish is long but only a little sweet, i could have another glass no problem. toffee and espresso to finish with the bourbon, its like dessert and an after dinner drink in one package. the best ive had from dark horse, one of the best bourbon barrel beers period. wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: easily the best beer I have had from dark horse, but with all the great barrel aged stouts out there, this one falls at the lower end of the upper tier."

"4 once sample on the brewery tour. I've had regular Plead the 5th, so I was excited to try this one. I was not let down. You can tell it is Plead the 5th, just barrel aged. You get all the great chocolate flavors and roasted tastes with a nice addition of boozy bourbon. I really enjoyed this one."
"O - Love it, glad I had it, going to try and get some more dressing like an Elf at the party in December."

"Looks like engine oil with a very chocolatey head. Aroma is chocolatey, oaky, and bourbon laden. Flavor is rich, roasty but not bitter, dark chocolate, with toasted notes, oak, and a smooth bourbon weaving throughout. A real treat of a beer."

"Overall beats KBS, BCBS, and scores a tad under Black Note for the past year vintages. Well done bottle. First of many from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Perfect pitch black with copper head lacing, silk in a glass.  Smell is dominated with typical RIS raisen-chocolate-sweetness.  Taste is so good, super smooth feel goes down way too easy.  Overall this is a really well done BB-RIS. Virtually no heat, but somehow I want more from it, still left hanging for that ""special"" quality."

"O - Perfect on a cool summer night… I want a case of this right now so I can drink it every time I get a fire going in the backyard. When I took my first sip after pulling out of the fridge I was a bit disappointed. DO NOT RUSH THIS ONE. Let it warm up and you will be blessed with an amazing beer. This is so drinkable for 11%"

"This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I have had. Close to Bourbon County in mouthfeel and not as sweet. I will definitely be looking for more of this next year and years to come."

"Seriously, DH does a damn fine job with this brew. The bourbon complements the base perfectly in my opinion and just balances everything out so nicely in this beer. There is a malty, roasty bitterness in the base that is not my preference but that is just me. I caught some molasses here, also, which was a nice surprise for my palate. Looking at it objectively as I can, this beer is so worthy of its WC status. Got to head to Elf Party for more this winter!"
""
""
""
""
"An exceptional beer. Totally worth going out of my way to try this on tap as i have little chance of getting this bottled. A real treat."
""

"2012 vintage - still very roasty toasty and chocolatey. Bourbon has faded slightly but still very delicious"

"This is very nearly as smooth as it gets. A sipper for sure, the brewers took great care to not let alcoholic heat thin it or add too much bite, the body's richness and thickness or its robust fullness to get too sickeningly heavy or slick, and the sweetness to overcome the balancing dry notes that keep it in check. This is one of the silkiest, most smoothly slowing brews I've yet had the pleasure to drink."

"Bourbon fudge brownies with a twist of vanilla from the oak. Deep and decadent with a great base of cocoa and roasted malts. The Bourbon flavor in this beer is quite possibly the best I have found. I feel like I am sipping a great shot of whiskey without the heat and ice/water."
"Big thanks to BA Dan for getting me this. Pretty sure this is a 2012 bottle. Appearance is dark dark black with a little caramel head. Nose is huge, bourbony, with a slight offputting sourness. Taste is sweet up front, a little roasty, with some bitterness. Nice lasting bourbony finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full. Overall it's above average for a BBA stout. Sourness notwithstanding, it's a nice piece de resistance to Dark Horse's stout series."
""
""
""
"I think this bottle may have oxidized."
"Overall – this is an excellent beer that will make it to my permanent ISO list. So rich, well balanced, and easily enjoyable. I also love the fact that such a great BBA Stout is available in a 12oz presentation. In my opinion this tastes & smells like a distant relative to Parabola."

"Bottom Line: Legendary brew!"
"O- I've had multiple vintages of BB Pt5 and it's among my favorite barrel-aged stouts. The base beer Pt5 is already a great beer and the barrels add a nice integrated presence adding to the complexity and flavor. From my experience I prefer this beer fresh as it's still incredibly drinkable and hasn't lost any of it's flavors. If you do want to age it a couple years it will still hold up with the best of them, except maybe lose a little bit of the base beer flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I had high expectations for this brew and it didn't disappoint. I kind of knew it would be damn good and it was. The base beer was great and they complimented it with a good barrel addition that didn't take away but stood out on its own. Very pleased with this brew and glad I have more."
"T: Dark chocolate with a bourbon bite right off the bat. Then settles into some roasted malt, espresso, toffee, light barrel char, and fudge. Finishes with some milk chocolate and a good dash of bourbon. A ton of aggressive flavors in here, but none of them really take charge, which is nice. Instead, they all meld together, held intact by a velvety and just a touch slick mouthfeel. Really well executed."

"The pour is jet black with a dark khaki head. The lacing is nonexistent. The aroma is crisp vanilla with a dark licorice complexity and beautiful bourbon notes. The flavor is booming work vanilla and bourbon with a common imperial stout complexity. There is beautiful licorice and roasted malt character and this is just great."

"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, but not quite the best barrel aged stout I've had. Definitely a worthy addition to the BA top 250, but not quite a top 25 beer in my opinion. But in the end, this beer is still excellent. Seek it out!"

"I've enjoyed Plead the 5th before but nothing like this. The barrel aging really makes this beer come alive. An excellent treat that is worth seeking out."
""
""
"One of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts I've ever had, this one has the upper hand most others due to it's smooth, creamy, balanced character and rich, bold flavor."
"Overall this is a really well done example of the style. If I could get it with some degree of ease I would do so regularly."
""
"This is strangely different than the regular Plead the Fifth as the barrel has truly transformed the flavors to a creamy, vanilla dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark used motor oil brown capped by a creamy one finger beige head. Excellent retention especially for a barrel-aged stout; light, splotchy lacing. Dark chocolate, dried dark fruit, oak, and bourbon on the nose. An explosion of flavor: dense dark chocolate, scorched malt, dried black cherries, hints of prune and raisin, mild vanilla, charred oak, all capped off by charred oak and pleasant, warming bourbon booziness. Full bodied, low carbonation. Ridiculously smooth, creamy and velvety mouthfeel; as close to perfect as possible. One of the most balanced barrel aged imperial stouts I've ever enjoyed. This brew is a true marvel year in and year out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I've become, instantly, a fan of this beer. There is a great deal of balance, and all of it's flavors are so well integrated. The only thing I could ask for is a tad more influence from the barrel. Just a TAD. Other than that, this beer is spot on. Good thing I have four left. Gonna see what time does to this beast. Cheers!"
""
""
""

"Very little mocha head on it. The taste was much like the smell... Bourbon goodness. Quite possibly one of the best bourbon imperial stouts I've tasted. Thanks a lot to Weaksauce for this as an extra!!!"

"O: If this was available in GA (or easily available anywhere!) I would definitely stock up on these. Fantastic. Saving the other bottle for a while to see how it changes...."

"Overall an excellent bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Not at the level of some of the best I've had, but definitely on their heels. Will be interesting to see how it ages."

"Awesome BA stout. Don't let the slightly amateur label job fool you- this stout is great. More and more people know about this winner of a beer- so it's no longer a ""dark horse."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an amazing beer, and absolutely worth checking out, but I enjoyed it for many surprisingly different reasons from what I'd initially heard. It's rich, robust, and contains all of the barrel characteristics I enjoy best in these beers, but it doesn't smack you upside the head doing it, which I enjoy. No clue how this would age, but it's pretty extraordinary fresh. Don't go too much out of your way to get some, but all fans of the style should have it at least once."
""
""
"Thanks MichiganderHB! 2013 vintage. Pours jet black with a super thin, mocha head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the glass. Good lacing. Complex aromas of vanilla, raisin, bourbon, molasses, and dark chocolate. This is one of the best BA stouts I've ever smelled! Smooth dark chocolate hits the front of the palate followed by caramel,vanilla, and dark fruits. The bourbon isn't as pronounced as in other BA stouts and it's extremely smooth and mellow. As it warms the chocolate really comes out with hints of toffee and molasses. Finish is chocolate with a hint of bourbon heat. Full bodied and incredibly smooth. Not much carbonation to speak of. Sweet finish. Overall, this is the best example of a bourbon barrel stout I've yet had. Simply outstanding!"
"Love this. Loads of chocolate with a nice touch of bourbon, but still isn't boozy. Extremely well balanced barrel aged stout."
""
""
"O: This is a great bourbon barrel aged stout. The buttery oak character in the aroma is slightly offputting, but the taste of this beer really makes up for it. I can't say that this is objectively better than regular Plead the 5th, which I love, but I definitely like this beer and am stoked that it comes in 12oz bottles."
""
""
""

"Poured from tap into a small tulip glass. Deep dark black. Thin beige head, dissipates to minimal rim, lots of tiny bubbles. Awesome lacing & retention. Beautiful nose of chocolate & coffee, burnt roasted malt. On the palate, roasted chocolate and coffee flavors dominate. Not as boozy as others. Alcohol is almost unnoticeable, but strong carbonation. Overall, a delightful experience."

"Overall, I really enjoy the base beer of plead the fifth, and while this is fantastic, I had imagined it might be just a little better. I am intrigued now to try this fresh and compare. I don't think this would benefit from further aging as it is very drinkable and far from hot. If anything, the barrel character might just be more subdued than I would appreciate, and thus perhaps it is better fresh. Regardless, a real treat to drink."

"This beer is ok. Like the fourth dimension I don't get it. If you compare this beer to Kbs, bcbs, cbs, Black Tuesday, it isn't even close in my opinion.

"Dark Horse Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th Imperial Stout is an unapologetically bourbon-forward beer that some (myself included) might describe as being a bit rough around the edges. Although the booziness and the charred malts were at times distracting, the many amazing aspects of this beer made up for these relative shortcomings."

"Nearly jet black, ring of tan head with no lace to speak of. Smell an incredible mix of bourbon, oak and roast, lots of vanilla and chocolate, a bit of coconut, coffee grinds and a bit of alcohol, similar to BCBS in the nose. Taste is bourbon and oak, coconut, vanilla, chocolate, fudge and a light sweetness, roasted malt with some dry coffee in the finish. Lightly carbonated, medium-full body. Incerdibly solid, up there with some of the better BA stouts, will actively seek out more of this stuff."

"Pours graciously with no apparent head until I force the last on the bottle straight down. Head is a crown of caramel bubbles which settle along the edges of my snifter. The smell is dark chocolate, coffee, burnt vanilla and a musty bourbon. Despite the variety of flavors, everything seems somewhat muted. I appreciate the aggressive (but well integrated) taste of bourbon in an aged stout, but that isn't the case here. I'm just a bit disappointed, and as it warms I get a bit more bourbon, though not as well integrated and a bit fusel. The taste is something I can appreciate. It's smooth and mellow. No alcohol burn, and a nice roastiness. Mouthfeel is silky but a tad thin. My bottle says its 11% despite the description saying it should be 14%. I attribute the thinness to this. This may have been a thicker beer, but this version is definitely a lot lighter on the tongue. Overall, I'm happy to try this. I am starting to realize rarity can elevate a beers score, but in this case the beer gets the job done and I am more than happy to enjoy it. Cheers."

"2012 vintage. Happy Barrel Aged Beer Day! Pours jet black with thin brown head. Still pretty boozy even after a year in the cellar. Aroma of bourbon, dark chocolate, soy sauce, and dried fruit. Flavor is chocolaty up front with the bourbon lingering in the finish. Slight undertone of roasted malts. Nicely balanced. Heavy without being syrupy. Moderate carbonation. Overall an excellent barrel aged stout. Not a ton of depth but very balanced."

"When I first had this beer many moons ago, even in the midst of other harder-than-usual-to-come-by barrel-aged stouts and such, I felt lucky as hell to have had the privilege of its acquaintanceship. Then I was given a second chance. Pinch me. Anyway, this stuff pours a bedevilingly dark and murky black-brown topped by a short finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises bourbon, roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, light wood, a touch of booze, and the faintest hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, everything colluding to effect a luscious melange of bourbon-y, chocolate-y, and roast-y tastiness. The body is a light hefty, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, this is still one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever come across. Perhaps the beer gods will smile on me again in the future...?"
"Here it is, beer 1000. Had to make it something epic. So here goes, an epic BBA stout. And epic is the word to describe this, it's a hell of a BBA stout. Vanilla up front yields to a huge of bourbon flavor, but doesn't choke out the big, complex fruit character that rides with the normal imperial stout roast/coffee/chocolate thing in the back. Very big and smooth mouthfeel, a great BBA stout."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A darn delicious bourbon barrel stout, the flavor profile is perfect, the amount of fruit and complexity is mind boggling. One of the most impressive bourbon barrel stouts on the market and the showcase of the Dark Horse line up, if not the showcase of the Great Lakes."
""
""
""

"O - Overall, very nice BA imperial stout. I like this quite a bit more than the standard version and actually think this is a smoother drinker even with the addition of somewhat boozy bourbon. Alcohol is noticeable throughout but isn't at all harsh and burning, just a very desirable warmth. Barrel works well to add some extra nuance in the flavor and aroma. One of the better BA beers out there."

"O: This is the pinnacle of BBA Imperial Stouts. Everyone does them differently and they all taste a tad bit different, but this one, this one is perfectly balanced. Just the right amount of fudgey goodness paired with just right amount of barrel from the bourbon makes this beer ridiculously easy to drink . If you can't make it to 4elf, i'll let you in on a secret. Hit the brewery any time of the year and pay the money for the tour, you won't be disappointed."

"The stout had a mild bourbon aroma with malts lingering in the background. For a 14%ABV, I was anticipating a stronger bourbon aroma. In the initial taste, I detected vanilla, malt, bitter dark chocolate, burnt malts, and perhaps dark fruits. However, the taste just seems to end there with malts. There is a warming nature to the aftertaste, which one might find quite pleasant. In terms of taste, I just do not think this beer finished well. The thickness of the mouthfeel allow a sort of vacuum of malt which led to nothing more. For such a bold style, I expected more taste, and it just was not there."
"Pours a dark brown, motor oil color with some tan lacing. The aroma leaves something to be desired. Although the normal constituents of bourbon are present on the nose (i.e. vanilla, oak, etc.). There's a faint ""saltwater"" aroma as well, which is a little disconcerting. The taste follows the standard bourbon profile, with big burned elements and a heavy alcohol warmth throughout. The mouthfeel is pleasant, although I wish it was slightly thicker. The finish leaves something to be desired, as the big flavors from the initial taste disappear rather quickly, leaving only the burn. A solid brew from Dark Horse, but I'm a little let down."

"O: I wish I had split this bottle because it’s absolutely going to sit in my stomach, but at the same time, I don’t think I’m going to get sick of it. This might get a few more points if it turned down the bourbon heat, but at the same time, it’s done an excellent job of making both the bourbon and the stout distinct, so what else can you want?"

"O- More than I could say I'm disappointed, I'm just so surprised. This is the same exact beer I had fresh 2 years ago, and it's completely different. It's a little sweeter which I expected, but it has so much more coffee presence and so much less bourbon. It really reminds me of KBS, which is not a bad thing at all but the first time I had it it reminded me of Parabola. I'm putting this one down as a beer not worth aging. It's delicious in its own right still, but I enjoyed it so much more fresh. Still a solid barrel-aged offering from Dark Horse, and one of the better barrel-aged stouts floating around in my opinion. For those of you that are aging a few: drink them."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of light dry roasted malt notes with some black chocolate notes with medium bourbon notes with some vanilla undertones. Taste is also dominated by creamy black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt. Body is full with creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not as complex as I was expecting but very well balance overall with chocolate and bourbon creating an efficient mix."

"After having this back-to-back(-to-back?) with KBS, Black Note, and BCBS, I think I can finally and honestly say that this is my favorite of the bunch. They are all extraordinary brews, but the thing that really sets BB Plead the Fifth apart is the incredible smoothness of the bourbon. Not ONCE, not even after warming up for nearly an hour, does the bourbon ever seem any bit stronger than ""warm"". So incredibly smooth and complex. Fantastic integration of the barrel flavors with the base beer as to not mask or hide any of the substantial flavors, either. Probably my favorite Bourbon Barrel beer. I love this stuff."

"Vintage 2011: The grand finale to the night spent with jzeilinger. Poured this between the two of us. This beer was black it had a brown head that was faded quickly but left a ring around the edge of the glass. The look of the beer is pretty typical for the style. The smell of the beer is surprising to me, I expected the barrel aging to stand out a lot more on this. There is some vanilla on the nose along with some other sweet aromas. The taste of the beer is also really subtle. I was surprised by this, Really thought you'd be able to get much more intense flavors of the barrel and the bourbon. It's a great tasting beer regardless. The mouthfeel is thick and gently carbonated, it's a very smooth beer. Overall it's much more balanced than I expected, it's a solid beer from start to finish. I would have enjoyed a little more bourbon on it though. It's good but I don't feel it's worth the 100% rating on here."

"Overall I was very impressed with this. I have had the base beer and enjoyed it but the barrel did an amazing job to this. Very smooth and rich barrel characters reminded me a lot of Parabola or Old Raspy XI. Possibly a bit better and more drinkable."
"Overall: Without Steimie's great generosity I would not have had the opportunity to try this sensational beer. I never would have thought I would say this but I have found a BA stout that gives my all time favorite BCBS a run for it's money! Like I said before this is just so well balanced it is an absolute enjoy to sip on. BCBS is an in your face bourbon bomb that I too enjoy but wow this is just a perfect balance with the bourbon complementing everything else."

"Another from my trade with deyholla. Pours viscous black with one finger brown mocha head. Aroma of chocolate, sweet molasses, dark fruits, roast, and something off that I am not a fan of (similar characteristics to Tres). Thick viscous mouthfeel with medium low carbonation. Heavy dark fruit up front followed by lots of dark bittersweet chocolate. Slight booze, but don't get much of the bourbon barrel in this. Was expecting a bit more vanilla oak, though my palate might be tainted from the Kuhnhenn BA 4D I had right before this. I tend to prefer non-fruity stouts, but this is generally well done. Relaxing sipper. I find it strange that the regular version was so full of roast and chocolate and this one went more fruity despite the barrel. Oh well, good beer just not as great as I had hoped."

"O: Wow. This one lived up to the hype, and perhaps surpassed it as far as I'm concerned. I'm very impressed. Highly recommended."

"Overall, a top tier barrel aged stout. It is a bit big and boozy at times, but I really like the big, sweet characteristics of this beer. The barrel is incredibly well integrated and really enhances the base beer. I remember not really loving this base beer, but the barrel makes this one of the best in this style."

"O - so yeah, I'm surprised on a few elements of this beer. I really didn't think the coffee was going to shine through so much, but this beer is really coffee forward. I kind of wishes for more bourbon notes, but overall, this beer is well-balanced and smooth drinking. Nice!"

Fantastic fresh, but for me, it just might benefit with a little more time on it. Looking forward to seeing if I am right. One of the best for the style hands down."
"O - Truly one of the best BA stouts out there. How anyone can trade this stuff after sampling it is beyond me. Compared to its major 12 oz competition, well I think I like BCBS a bit more since its a brash stout that is all about the bourbon. This beer is much more balanced with the bourbon complimenting the base beers notes. God dammit this is good stuff!"

"Overall, a very good beer, but as with the base BT5, I apparently like this less than the average bear. And in the pantheon of bourbon barrel stouts, stunningly, I would rate this as slightly below average. Worth drinking, and recommended, but I would not pay $7/bottle for it or trade for it at a high premium."

"355mL 2011 ed silver wax thanks to mikem409. Pours ink with a larger reddish mocha head settling abruptly to a bubbly layer. Nose is richer vanilla with thicker sweet bourbon. Very reminiscent of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Rich wood and mild dark cherries. Very inviting, dessert nose. Taste is silky, rich, spicy bourbon, big dark chocolate. Thankfully only hints of ash that sometimes plague Dark Horse beers. Bitter, thicker. Very enjoyable. Great palate. Lower carbonation with super rich, oily palate. Beautiful stuff. Glad to see this bumped into the Top 50 on both sites. 1/13/2012 8/4/8/5/16=4.1"

"O-I was hesitant to get this on a hot day but had not had the pleasure before so had to brave the heat to try this, very glad that I did. This is a winner, now I have another beer that I have to add to the hit list to try to get every year."
""
"Overall: A really great Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. Big, rich, and dark while keeping the sweetness and booze taste under control."

""
"Overall: Very much different from the base beer, as the bourbon is strong. I honestly think I prefer the base in this case, but that is not to say that they took anything away from it with the BB version."
"O: Very, very good bourbon barrel stout."
""
"This is a malt heavy, complex beast of a beer and the bourbon barrel components blend right in. I'll be savoring this slowly over the rest of the evening. Thanks again, Al!"
"O: The barrel aging really took this beer to another level with out sacrificing the complexities of the base beer. I'm glad it still retained the body that regular Plead the 5th carries. A must try."
"Sampled at EBF on Saturday afternoon. Pours a solid black with a decent tan head with some retention. Smell is heavy on the bourbon with lots of chocolate and roast, and some vanilla and wood. Taste is chocolate bourbon and roast. Thick body with a creamy smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. A big thick stout, one of my favorites of the day."
""
""
""
"I'll skip to overall impressions. This will be the barrel aged stout by which I judge all other barrel aged stouts, and they will all fall short. This beer was perfect, a fantastic blend of bourbon and dark chocolatey stout, with a thick, creamy mouthfeel. I honestly don't think it could be improved upon. 5 out of 5. Well done Dark Horse, I tip my hat to you."
""
""
"O: I cannot sing the praises of this beer enough. Though it would have probably scored higher if it had a slight touch of extra bitterness from the dark roasted malts, I find it very hard to fault this. If you can somehow get this, you definitely should. I'll be after you if you don't."
""
""
""
""
"O- very good BA stout. From the regular version I guess I should expect the as hipness and dark chocolate. Just didn't have that amazing vanilla, chocolate, bourbon combo I love from bcbs."
""
""
""
""
"O: Side by side these two beers are like night and day. While the original is good, the flavor profile on the barrel aged one makes it taste like it doesn’t even have the same base beer. Well worth finding a bottle or two. Thanks again, HosP, for sending me a couple."
"Black in color with a nice viscosity and a finger of dense brown head. Heavy on the bourbon and vanilla, as expected. Great chocolate character with hints of roasted malt, caramel, and molasses. Pleasantly sweet, but not cloying. Great milk chocolate and vanilla flavors all the way through with tons of bourbon as well. Not too heavy on the oak, but a little bit is present. Mild roasted malt and caramel flavors."
"Just another example of why the midwest conquers every other corner of the world when it comes to imperial stouts."
"Thanks to largadeer for breaking this, and many other gems out at the Solar Eclipse party."

"I prefer the base beer -- especially with age -- but this isn't bad. I hear last year's batch was much better (makes sense; the beer I'm drinking isn't anywhere near deserving of a 4.48 average). Hope I can try a 2010 bottle someday."
""
""
"O: Very nice bourbon barrel aged stout, but not my favorite. I much prefer this over the normal plead the 5th (which was a bit too smokey for my taste)."
"O: Really great beer. The flavors blend nicely with the level of bourbon presence being spot on. I can see why it is so sought after."

"Overall, this is a great stout that I enjoy just as much if not more than KBS. I would say if you like BBA stouts you have got to try and get this. It's a wonderful beer in this genre!"
"O - Fantastic! A perfect display of bourbon barrel flavors layered onto an excellent stout base. Thought this beer had more bourbon notes than KBS, which I didn't realize was possible."

"This guy eluded me for a while, but I finally caught it at Hawthorne's. Served in a Chimay chalice, I can't imagine a better looking beer: thick, dark black like motor oil, capped with a creamy dark chocolate head that quickly sank to a ringlet of bubbles. Maybe a little more retention would've been nice, but I didn't expect much from such a high octane beer. Aroma of dark malts, moderately roasty, dark chocolate, heavy bourbon. Dark sweet malts in the taste, chocolate chips, toasted marshmallow, heavy yet smooth bourbon with notes of vanilla and oak. Full body, creamy and delicious, a great sipper. Not quite as smooth as a nicely aged BCBS, but a great brew nonetheless."
""
"O: great beer. Worth tracking down. It's darkness and huge roasted and bitter flavors make it stand out from other bourbon barrel stouts. This is still very much a stout."
"Big thanks goes out to cmrillo for sharing this one after a ticking session at a local restaurant this evening! Thanks brother! Served from bottle into a Ommegang Three Philosophers chalice. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised roasted malt, sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, raisin, vanilla, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. The aroma on this one was really quite nice and very complex. All of the right components for the style were present in this one. The barrel really did a nice number on this brew as the regular version was quite good, but this turned that up to 11. The flavor was very well balanced and inviting making it quite easy to drink despite the high ABV. This could definitely get you in A LOT of trouble if not careful. An absolute must try if you are a fan of beer. Really glad I finally got the chance to try this one myself! Thanks again Rillo!"
""
"Overall it's just all around great "
"Overall: If you like stouts that taste like cheap bourbon this one is for you. There is no balance whatsoever in this beer and I don't feel like it even holds a candle to some of the high alcohol big stouts"

"Edit #2 - directly compared another 2012 vintage to regular 2012 Bourbon County. I must say, it didn't hold up well at all. Docking a number of points, as much as it pains me to do."
""
"This beer pours a full bodied, black chocolate black with no head but a dark khaki lacing around the rim. The nose is very rich and roasty. T has some fudge brownie to it, LOADS of chocolate. That said, there isn't much bourbon at all. The flavors are really smooth and chocolaty. Again, loads of chocolate fudge and brownie. There is barely any bourbon at all and moderate roast. Great flavor on the chocolate standpoint, but disappointing in terms of barrel aged imperial stouts. This is the most palatable chocolate I've ever experienced in a beer. It is pretty light in body, compared to others of the style. I would describe it as a light medium. It does however increase drinkability. Overall this is a very nice beer, but doesn't show the bourbon you would expect. If I had to guess, I would say that this is oak aged or just aged regular Plead the 5th. All of that said, this beer was delicious."
""
""
""
"Big-bodied and lightly-carbonated to style. Hot, even with a year down, but it's at a goddamn 14%. Still a great feel for the strength."
""
"Wow. This one didn't impress me out of the gate, but as it warmed - really warmed, after about 25-30 minutes - it became amazing. This is an excellent beer that really complements the excellent base beer. Worthy. Glad I have one more."

"O: Damn good beer. My only regrets are not realizing this was 14% (or how good it would be) and not sharing it with a friend."

"Overall this is phenomenal. I loved the standard Plead the 5th. This is even that much better and at 14% its balanced so well with no alcohol characteristics you'd never know it was 14%."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this brew. A friend and customer brought it in to share, having located a beer not available in my region. I was impressed with this find. The nose was pungent, with strong aroma's of vanilla, brown sugar, alcohol, and light hints of chocolate. The taste was creamy and rich, with just a slight bitter oak bite. The long finish was spectacular, with flavors of white, dark, and milk chocolates blending beautifully together with just the lightest bit of burn. Highly recommended, if you can find it."
"-GFunk"
"Overall: Really liked this one and it doesn't pack too much heat. Grab one if you can."
"Can't taste the alcohol, super drinkable. Lives up to the hype IMO."
"Reminded me a lot of BCBS and while this was a very good example of melding an imperial stout with bourbon barrel aging I'd have to give my preference to BCBS. That said, this is definitely worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style."
""
"Outstanding bourbon barrel stout. Bourbon is well integrated and not overpowering. The bitter malts I usually like in beers of this style aren't as present, but even though the flavor profile is on the sweeter side, it's not cloying or overly sweet. Will definitely seek this out again."
""
""
""
""

""

"This is a beer I will try and seek out anywhere on tap again. IMO, it's much better than Bells Black Note and KBS, and that is saying a lot!!"
"O: Very tasty, very drinkable, this is a very good RIS, I wish I had more"
"Pours an opaque black with a khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, cinnamon, wood, and bourbon. Taste is pretty much the same with an alcohol kick in the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it’s a bit hot in my opinion."
""

"O-- Slow sipper is a good starting point. Big, bold balsy beer. Not for the faint one bit. Beats the heck out of most BA RIS. Worth finding. Worth savoring"
""
""
""
""

"Drinkability: Fantastic. A really solid beer, with a very interesting flavor profile, despite the 14.0% abv."
"O: I have to go super high with this one. Solid A moving towards A+ for sure."
""
"2011 Vintage. Pours a thick, black color with a small, dark tan head that turns to bubbles shortly. Scent is out of this world! Such great bourbon...smells like expensive bourbon. Not sure what barrels were used for this beer, but it's fantastic. Sweet vanilla and toffee as well. Such a smooth, inviting aroma. Taste is just as nice...immediately I get sweet chocolate and vanilla. Then a nice transition into delicious bourbon whiskey with some alcohol flavors and toffee. This beer is sweet, but not overly sweet. At first there was a hint of soy, but as you take more sips it disappears. Great barrel profile with dark chocolate and a hint of coffee. Warm finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very warm from the alcohol...feel it in my chest as it goes down. Drinkability is surprisingly high for such a big ABV. Overall, this beer is stellar. Such an extraordinary imperial stout."
"O This stuff is excellent. Taste is pretty spot on with what I want in a bourbon stout and worthy of the hype."
"This may be the best beer I have had the opportunity to taste, especially when you consider that it was this year's release and would more than likely get even better with another year or two!"

"O - Complex, layered, and pleasant. Boozy, but very, very nice. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"O: A beautiful barrel aged stout. Smell and taste profiles are huge, massive. But this is so easy to drink, so good, one can be delighted for many many bottles!"
"O: This is absolutely fantastic. So rich and delicious, hard to not take big sips. I am simply blown away by how drinkable and how little heat there is for a beer this big. Easily up there among my favorite stouts to date. Will seek out more."
"Thanks Ryan!"
"O- Good ba stout. Nothing extrordinary. Lacks something, but can't really put my finger on it. Maybe a little more complexity would make this better."
""
""
""
""
"O: a good bbal stout, overall. I'd like some more bourbon presence and more depth of aroma, but it hides the alcohol very well."
""
"O: Want more, give me more. One of the better barrel contributions to a beer. Works out very well and you aren't hit with a bourbon booze monster or just a meager stout."

"Very good beer."

"(EDIT - I promise I never looked... I scored this the exact same score as Bourbon County Stout) Too frigging funny"
""
"O- This is bar none the best imperial stout I've had to date. Would i go so far as to say this is the best beer I've ever had? In this moment, yes, but it could change tomorrow. EVERYTHING is so well balanced here that i can't think of another imperial stout to dethrone this beast. Goddamn Dark Horse, bravo....bravo."
"O - A solid and quite boozy BA stout from Dark Horse. The barrel aging adds a lot of complexity to the flavor. I would like it to be a bit thicker and to cover its alcohol a little better as right now it's a bit hot. Curious to see how this develops in a few years."
"O: One of the, if not the best beer I've had. How is no alcohol detected in a 14% beer?"
"Overall a great beer and very tasty."
"7/1/12 Update - Dark fruits are showing up in the flavor, oak is still strong and the heat is faded. If you've been holding any of these for a while, you should really think about opening at least one of them soon. 5/4/4.5/4.5/4.25"
"O- great stout...top 5 for me and I've had a lot of them. One of the most impressive things was how much the barrel aging process changed the base beer. I thought Plead the 5th was way too sweet and not incredibly smooth, and this is the opposite of that. It tastes very similar to Parabola, just with a much different aroma. I've been a bit disappointed with a lot of BA stouts with hype like this one has, but this beer honestly is worth seeking out. Good stuff"
"UPDATE: Trying a 2012 and 2011 together tonight. Everything is the same in the 2012, though the palate is a little heavier and creamier. I'd give a solid 4 to the newer vintage in this department."
""

"Happy to have finally had this. An above-average -bal stout, but a bit hot and messy at this stage to be top tier."

"Poured from 12oz bottle with a gold wax cap (2011 vintage) into a tulip glass. Pours dark chestnut with thin tan lacing head that lasts throughout. Aroma of sweet oak, vanilla, bourbon, some blueberries. Really nice aroma! Taste some alcohol heat from the bourbon, sweet dark fruits, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and some chocolate. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Smooth and mild bitter back finish. Quite enjoyed this one!"

"O: Very tasty beer, not overwhelming for 14% , would definitely have again, highly recommended."

"Mouthfeel is liquid oil. Really smooth with full body and low carb. Im really impressed with this beer overall. Wish I had more of theses puppies. Damn fine brew."

"Great beer. Reminds me of the best attributes of all of this years Eclipses put together."

"O - Great BA stout. If the Bourbon wasn't so noticeable this would be an A+ beer. Nothing a little more time can't fix. Glad I got to try this."
""
""
"Overall, this is a really impressive offering by Dark Horse. I enjoyed this significantly more than my previous experience on tap at the Great Taste. A solid ba stout that is impressive as is and stands to potentially age quite gracefully. Well done!"
""
"Dark Horse has created a near masterpiece with their BB Plead the 5th. Like John Wayne in ""The Searchers", I highly recommend getting on your stallion and tracking this beast down."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a fantastic beer. The flavors came together extremely well in it and the barrel flavors complimented the beer perfectly instead of overpowering it. This one definitely lived up to the hype for me, one of the best barrel aged beers I've had."
"O: Truly a wonderful beer! Excellent barrel aging here. I thoroughly enjoyed the complexity and think it is a nice compliment to the regular (base) beer. I could drink this often and think it will age beautifully."

""
""
"Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good stuff. Thanks, kzoo."

"The mouthfeel has a bit of roasty bitterness which is nice when paired with the sweetness of this brew. It is creamy, mildly sticky with what I feel is below average carbonation. The Bourbon Barrel version is definitely better, and bolder, than the original."
"overall, a stellar imperial stout. almost unfair to lump some of these barrel-aged beers in with the general population, but this one stands out even among other -bals. special thanks to abanton for this gem."
""
"O - this is a great beer. It's huge, but works great. Tasty, complex, balanced. Much approval."
""
"O: This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had so far. It's huge in all areas. The taste is just a tad bit weak on the barrel notes or else this would be close to perfect. I will say as it warms it vastly improves the taste. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer is fantastic. I love sweet imperial stouts, and this is one of the best. Dark Horse takes an already fantastic base beer and hits a grand slam with it. After having it on draft last week at Ashley's in Westland, I decided to crack a bottle to compare. Draft and bottle versions of this are very comparable and equally impressive. I may even stack this alongside KBS and Black Note. One of the true gems of the Michigan craft beer community."
""
"A great flavor. Loving the toasted coconut notes, and the bourbon is very well-blended. A tasty, sweet, drinkable stout."

"O. This is true a top shelf beer. It's sweet but not over done, very malty but not dominating the whole beer, the chocolate is at a good level, and a nice light coffee finish. This is a beer I will be looking to get more and more of. I suggest everyone try this!"
"O - This is a pretty decent BA stout. I really enjoy the smell and taste, but the mouthfeel is slightly off putting. This is the first time I've had this brew, and while I like it now, I know that it'll be the bees knees in a few years. Thanks again Erik for the assist!"
"O: Overall this is a damn fine beer. Very glad I got to try this. I will be seeking out more of this in the future. Thanks to Dark Horse for making more of this and putting it in 12oz bottles. 5.0"

"really a wonderful bourbon barrel aged stout. the regular plead the fifth was such a well done impy stout, so i had such high hopes for this and i was definatly not let down. ill definatly seek out more of this for the cellar if possible. great beer, loads of bourbon, still i dont think i can say its better than bourbon county, although extremely close."
"O - for sure the best out of these stouts. So sweet and delicious."

"The nose is more complex than the nose with the sweetness mixing with the barrel perfectly. The taste isn't quite as nice but it's still excellent. This is a nice example of what barrels can add to a beer."
"o - overall i wish i had a regular plead to do the side-by-side as i remembered loving it and remember the flavors rich and bold much like this. i'm a big fan of this and glad i have a few more of these and really glad i got to try it and that dark horse made enough to go around this time. enjoyable beer for sure, but not as earth shattering as i had hoped...i actually prefer the 2011 fresh BCBS that i swapped for this, but again, glad to have a few of these to taste over time."
"Awesome! Bourbon Barrel Plead The 5th! First time having this beer and it sure lives up the what i've heard about it. Big thanks to Abraxel for another homerun!"

"Beer is medium to big in body, malty sweet with a strong bourbon character. Fudge and chocolate with minimal roast. The sweetness carries through all the way to the end. The bourbon wins in this beer. So sweet, so oaky, vanilla, booze but without heat. I really liked it."
""
"After 1 year, the 2012 has lost much of the barrel character but is still tasty enough. After 2 years, this has lost all barrel character, some of the chocolate notes, and has taken on more fruit and anise (not in a pleasant way); it's really gone downhill. Overall, I would say that it's at peak when fresh, falls off some after a year, and has gone completely downhill after two years. So drink soon."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great BBA RIS, and an improvement on an already fantastic base beer. I love the normal version and had high hopes for this one, and it did not disappoint. The nose and taste both had a ton of bourbon and chocolate, with the nose having more chocolate and the taste having more bourbon, though for 14% it isn't overwhelming. I think another thing I love about this is that they sold it in 12 oz. bottles. So many great BBA RIS's come in 22 oz/750ml bottles, and cracking a 12 oz. bottle of this tonight was just perfect. Very happy to have another bottle of this."
"M - Full body, somewhat viscous at times. Light carbonation."
""
""
"The beer is near black with a thin, beige cap. The aroma offers bourbon and roast, followed by alcohol, vanilla, oak, chocolate. Great flavor, with prominent bourbon throughout. Additional tastes of vanilla and chocolates. Moderately low carbonation, with a smooth, buttery feel. A bit of heat in the finish, but 14% abv feels pretty nice. Overall, very enjoyable. A top notch barrel-aged imperial stout."
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: Enjoyable, but this is just a bit too boozy at this point. I'll bet this will be excellent in 6 months if it manages to avoid becoming infected like many other barrel aged strong ales. A pleasure to try."
""
"Although this beer has had quite some talk behind it, its still under-the-radar in my opinion. Absolutely amazing and pretty much everything you could possibly want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. I'll definitely be seeking out more of this to lay down."

""
"O: Large margin improvement from regular plead the 5th. Glad I got the chance to try it. Not my favorite -bal RIS but still quite tasty. Worth a try."
"O- This is a very special beer. It drinks like a 9-10% when its really 14-15%. The Russian Imperial Stout quality and the Bourbon Quality are equal here. Something that is rare in a BBA stout-and the fruit is perfect not over or underripe."
"O: This beer is phenomenal. The hype is totally justified. I can't wait to see how this beer ages!"

"Overall: I enjoy the hell out of this beer. I think that some time will cool the alcohol noted only at the end."

"This beer is amazing. The base beer was already an excellent stout and the nicely integrated barrel treatment take it over the top. I'm not sure when this beer was bottled but it was released just weeks before I sampled it and it is already drinking phenomenal."
""
""
""
"Overall: Great effort by dark horse. This is my favorite beer that I have tried from this brewery. I love smokey dark beers and when barrel notes meet the smoke like they do in this beer its makes a really tasty beer."
""
"O: The best Dark Horse offering I have had to date. If you are looking for a bourbon forward stout I recommend this. It is a worthwhile offering."
"Drink- I loved the fact this came in a 12 oz bottle. I am a big guy but sometimes I just want one little beer for the day with immense flavor and appeal. This beer was smooth, bold and well layered. I will come back to this one many times."
""
""
"O- Despite how fresh this was, this wasn't overly boozy. The mouthfeel was the highlight as it was the perfect level of carbonation and the bourbon was integrated very well with the base beer. Can't wait to crack some more open in the future."

"Reviewed from a bottle this time to compare the the tapped version. Unfortunately I do not know the age of the keg, the tap version does seem slightly smoother. Very drinkable Imperial Stout. Despite the heat the alcohol is hidden rather well. Impressive beer."

"Honestly, this has to be one of the absolute best bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stouts I've had to date. The intensity and complexity of the flavors in this beer are missing in so many others in the style. You've got to like, or love, bourbon to enjoy this beer. It's nearly perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a thin coffee rim. The nose is a lovely blend of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and a bit of cocoa. The taste is a perfect meld of the bourbon, sweet vanilla, toffee, and a bit of cherry. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk. Doesn't get much better than this. Has a slightly bittersweet finish that lingers for a short while. This kicked in 40 minutes. A real privilege to try this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good example of the style. Chocolate and licorice sit fairly thick on the tongue then changes to hints of spices at the finish. Very smooth with no bite or sense of the high alcohol content. Pairs well with beef and sharp cheddar cheese. I have had this from the tap at the brewery every time it is on the tap list, which is not very often. One of my very favorite beers."

"Bottle poured a clear dark reddish brown with a small lingering brown head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, cocoa, light roastiness and light vanilla. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of bourbon, oak, maple,light vanilla and light roastiness with a smooth lingering bourbon finish."
"An incredible bourbon barrel aged stout to say the least."
"Draft. Sampled at Great Taste. Pours a pitch black brown/black color with a slight mocha bronw head. The barrel and booze is pretty evident in the nose along with the normal imp stout characteristics of dark chocolate and some leather. The booze is pretty in your face to me on this one with it being the first thing I notice upon tasting, followed by the barrel, dark chocolate, and slight leather. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I thought it a tad hot but otherwise pretty drinkable."
"O: Best at the beerfest. I understand the hype. Beats out the Blacknote."
"4.5 D: A great beer that would be worth seeking out if they made a reasonable amount of it."
"O- Loved it, got to the line early enough to be one of the first to try it, quality Barrel Aged stout that is very drinkable for how high the abv, very happy I was able to drink this."
"Poured a black color with an average creamy brown head that mostly lasted and produced excellent lacing. Heavy toasted malt, bourbon and chocolate aroma. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Moderate to heavy complex toasted sweet bourbon flavor with a heavy toasted sweet finish of long duration. Best of fest complex standout brew."
"Note: This IS the bourbon barrel aged version, not the Aigre version that is supposed to be sour."
"This beer is perfectly balanced. Pours extremely dark, smells of vanilla bean, bourbon, and rich dark chocolate with a hint of the usual bitter stout trappings (licorice, anise, etc) which just add depth. The taste is more of the same, with a huge vanilla bean and dark fruit flavor that is nothing short of incredible. This beer is worthy of the hype on this site and I'd love to see it become a standard in bottles."
"O: This is stellar. I hope I can get to the release of this beer if there is one in the future. Simply outstanding!"
"Jeez! This is one sick beer!"
"Finally got to try this at Capone's for the end of PBW. Poured into a snifter the chocolate brown head dissipated quickly leaving no head to speak of, but major alcohol legs were present with each swirl of the glass. Smell on this was great. I must have looked like a junkie with the deep inhales I kept finding myself taking. Lots of deep roast espresso, dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Taste was even better. The integration of the bourbon into the base beer was exceptionally well done. This beer was exceptionally well balanced with great bourbon flavors present, but at no point did it overwhelm the stout. Nice coffee, roasted malt, and smooth bourbon on the tongue, with a great charred oak character right there. Vanilla became ever more present as the glass warmed up. I also got a hint of campfire type marshmallow. All of this had a great coating effect on the palate. I could drink this all the time. Definitely worthy of seeking out, and making efforts to go to tasting events to get a chance to try. Highly Recommended!"
"The palate opens with a big boozy heat and plenty of bourbon working well with the chocolate and licorice. Plenty of malt and licorice bitterness as well. Thick chewy and boozy, this beer is sweet and hot on the finish with nice chocolate and vanilla. This is one of those few beers where the heat is well-incorporated in the flavor profile, mostly thanks to the huge body .Not as much soy on the palate, as the nose might suggest. A little overcarbonated, though, but that's personal preference. Letting it warm up and flatten out reveals how awesome this beer is."
"D - This one isn't for the timid or shy... A full bodied, full flavored, full throttled barrel aged stout... Lots of good things going on here... This one deserves a seat at the table of the best of the big time barrel aged stouts..."
"O: this beer is a rollercoaster of flavor, It starts off with the delicious base of plead the fifth and then tacks on delicious bourbon character. This is a rarity worth trying!"
"EDIT: Had this a second time at the Great Taste and it was not nearly as good. Dropped the taste -.5 to reflect this change."
"all 4.5's"
"(750ml shared at Dak's Final Four tasting!). Pours oily dark brown with think khaki head. Aroma has sweet bourbon, vanilla and oak. Taste is sweet with some sour notes. Full bodied with oily texture. Good, but I had higher expectations of this one.."
"Pours a deep impenetrable black with a good head that shocked me because every bottle of Plea The 5th I've opened has had a whisper of a head. This nice head leaves a subsequent nice lace. The aroma is plum, fig, vanilla, molasses, and plenty of deep roast. The flavor is loads of vanilla and chocolate with plenty of dark fruit and some nice fig and raisin notes with just a mild warming alcohol note. A delicious variation of an already delicious beer."
"The '11 has a richer nose and less sweet in the flavor. More balanced but less bright so you sacrifice a little in flavor expression for balance and tightness. Both are very solid, I would prefer the '11 with the 2 years in it. Rate from the '11."
"drinkability is good. nie balance. barrel is not all that assertive and works well."
"I had this at a local beer bar. It had very little head, and even that didn't stick around very long; there was also very little carbonation. The smell was of bourbon, oak, and a well balanced malty sweetness. The taste was of bourbon and oak first with a very slight roast barley bitterness. This faded to a bourbon vanilla sweetness that coated the mouth. Finally, it finished with a bit of alcohol heat, but not too much, especially considering its high ABV. The mouthfeel was thick and rich, coating your whole mouth leaving a malty sweetness that lingers. For a beer this big it is surprisingly drinkable. I couldn't resist getting a second glass, but the alcohol in this drink is well hidden, and could easily creep up on you."
"Medium body with a nice creamy feel. Some warming alcohol. Overall, very nice, but a bit hot."
"The easiest drinking 14% beer ever maybe. Very balanced, neutral , and creamy. The bourbon barrel aging is very light and not aggressive, I would of liked it a bit more aggressive honestly. Light vanilla, oak, hint of bourbon, chocolate, roasty malts, dark fruits, leather and tar. Very nice."
"Was impressed with the pitch black color and lacing that this growler pour revealed into my snifter. A beauty on the nose as well with a medium amount of bourbon touched off with some cocoa. The taste with the bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla characteristics from the oak really impressed me with the balance of this stout. The carbonation may have been a bit off due to the growler pour being the last out of the keg when filled, but still was a sludgy, creamy feel. I was surprised that it was around 14% as its drinkability was very high for me without the booziness some ba stouts can get."
"D-Crazy Drinkable. Would not have guessed 14%. WOW"
"Drinkability- A great sipper. Didn't realize they were serving a 14% beer in ohio ;)"
"Sampled at the '10 Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival. Jet black pour with a small, loose, off-white head. Smoky, rich bourbon, tons of dark fruit, raw cacao and massive dark roast coffee. There's a nice little whiskey kick at the end too. Creamy, oily, full body with soft carbonation. What a huge beer with incredible balance and layered flavors!"
"Pour yields a beer that is near black with a thin whisper of a mocha head without any real retention, just a few bubbles here and there.  The nose brings forward all sorts of delight with nice bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, and roast.  Also, there was a bit of a creamy peanut butter note that I really enjoyed.  The taste wasn't quite as nice and explosive but the bourbon did quite a few great things for the base beer.  Good oak and bourbon throughout, creating a really nice feel.  No hint of the huge alcohol presence. Drinks quite well and my pour was gone well before I had gotten enough of this to satisfy my thirst.  Thanks again, Eric!"
"This is one of the finest stouts I have ever had. The use of bourbon barrels is done to perfection. Bravo Dark Horse for making such an incredible drinking experience."
"This is especially good considering that you can't taste the alcohol in such a strong beer, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
"This was good, but not as good as tap where I was blown away. Worth trying for sure, but get it on tap."
"D - I never did get to try this on-tap, but I was very impressed with this out of the bottle. Def a top-notch -bal, no doubt about it. Still can't get over how easy this was to drink for 14%. Recommend."
"Note...When first done I understand Plead was around 14% abv,but so in could be exported to Ohio (etc) that got lowered to about 13% or a bit less...likewise for Double Crooked Tree."
"Great beer. Glad I got to tick this. I love me some -bal aged RISes, and this is a great example."
"One of the best examples of Bourbon Barrel aged beers in the sense that Barrel aging has made an otherwise average RIS excellent! Do not pass it up if you ever get the chance to try it!"
"I wake up craving this beer, even if I had this in bottles I could never age it because it would be impossible to resist."
"Deep fudgy chocolate and blackened, fried plantains dripping in brown sugar syrup. Not overly sweet, but with a vanilla barrage from the barrel. Dark roast and bittersweet chocolate figure large in the equation. Rich flavor, blackened roasted barley, toasted marshmallow, vanilla and chocolate intermingling, with a light sweetness peeking through in the middle. Even carbonation, and with a bigger swig the alcohol is evident, but creeps by unnoticed when sipped. It has an unwavering intensity that is impressive. A solid A+ RIS from Dark Horse."
"Plead the 5th is already a great beer, and this is even better. Impressive stuff."
"D: Overall I thought this was too easy to finish. So good, I could have drank two somehow if I wasn't driving. At 14% you're gonna get some burn, but I still think its deceptively drinkable. An unexpected and memorable stout from Dark Horse, gotta give them more credit from now on."
"At a great beer event at the Hulmeville Inn with a great tap list, I started with this and closed with this, with many beers in between. It was good enough to want to go back and have another, despite having many other high ABV beers in between. I can't wait to have this again."
"D - This is a beer that can kill you. At 14% it drinks like about something at 8%. I drank this quite easily and found myself having to concentrate hard on putting one foot in front of the other. A great beer that I would love to have again."
"D- Ok, 14% is very high and all, nowhere near a session beer. I drank my pint with ease. I would drink more but I have to stay alive, if I was at home drinking this, bourbon 5th would be a all dayer. Im not a big stout guy lately but this one is worth the damage that the alcohol will do over time. This one is a winner and possibly the best bourbon aged stout that I ever had. I drank this along with older vis and bourbon black and this one took the cake."
"D- for a 14 abv pile driver of a brew Im blasting through this pint. This is one amazing brew. Up there with the best barrel aged stouts in the world no doubt."
"Reviewed from notes, on tap at local option. Pours black into a snifter, no head and a very small ring of tan foam that sits at the edge of the glass. Smells of sweet dark cherries, vanilla, light bourbon, and milk chocolate. Taste is chocolate covered cherries, bourbon, and oak with a very slightly hot finish - not nearly as boozey as i would expect for 14%. Delicious. Mouthfeel is very thick and coating, light carbonation helps keep it from being too sticky, perfect for the style. For a massive, high abv stout, this one is surprisingly drinkable."
"This is an incredible beer. I almost question the accuracy of the ABV: 14%? Really? WOW!"
"Overall: This is my favorite beer to date. I was close to giving it my first all 5's but refrained. If I could choose one thing to drink all fall, winter, and spring, this would be it. This beer in every way exceeded my already high expectations and is proof to me that barrel aging an already great beer, if done correctly, can make it even better. I really hope they bottle this at some point. An absolute must try if you ever make a trip down I-94 to Marshall, are in Chicago anytime soon and can make it to Local Option, or at pre-darkness day at Stub and Herbs!"
"D: This is no session beer, but it is not limited to dessert and breakfast purposes."
"8/28/2010"
"Dark Horse has it's lynch pin here. While I quite enjoy Plead the 5th, the barrel wasn't just kind to this beer and to me, it gave it up on the first date, cooked me breakfast and paid for my cab home!"
"D - This was quite drinkable for the ridiculous ABV. I'm tempted to trek back to Local Option for another pour under more sober conditions. Also, kudos to Dark Horse for enhancing an already excellent beer with tasteful and well-integrated barrel-aging. They've also done a good job keeping the beer from thinning out too much or getting too astringent."
"Appearance is black and oily, with a thin tan head that leaves great lacing. Smells are bourbon, oak, some chocolate, smells delicious. Taste is some sweet malts, bourbon, oak and some smoke, very good. Mouthfeel is sticky, chewy and just enough carb or this style. This beer is really boozy, but in a really drinkable way. I only had one, because it was early afternoon and I didn't want to get too plowed, otherwise I could've had a few. This is a very good beer!"
"Overall, a solid -bal aged stout. Great flavors and very drinkable. Very impressed with DH on this one."
"D: So So good, I'm glad I opened up with this on it got me ready for the next 10 hours of drinking. Easy to drink, great flavors and complexity, and just delicious. I will be heading back to Dark Horse soon and hopefully i will be able to snag this again before its all gone"
"D- This to me was a perfect style of a bourbon barrel beer. The higher ABV (14%) limits this to a couple snifters at best. I do enjoy this beer and hope they do something like making a short bottle run of it. Dark Horse knows how to make their beers very drinkable and I have never had a problem doing just that. Cheers to you Dark Horse!"
"Taste is fantastic. This beer beat out CBS, KBS, Black Note and lots of other big stouts with major hype that were at the fest. We ended up going back for more of this. Our resounding favorite of the day. Theres nothing too frilly about it. Its just a big ass stout with dark fruits, coffee, chocolate, molasses soaked in oaky and vanillay tasting bourbon barrels."
