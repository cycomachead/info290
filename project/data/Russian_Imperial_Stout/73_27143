3.86,-11.5,4,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"This is one of a few barrel aged beers in which I prefer the regular version better. Looks and smells outstanding. I just think it drinks way too sweet and the body has a little bit too much carbonation giving it a soapy feel. I would guess that this is a Jack Daniels barrel beer. It tastes like cheap whisky instead of good bourbon. I also notice a lot more black licorice than in the base beer. Still above average, but pretty disappointed.","WesMantooth","Apr 03, 2015"

Whisky barrel aging makes itself an obvious taste upfront, and on each sip toward the bottom of the glass. Quickly mellows into semi sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Decent brew overall, but not a great example of an imperial stout. I’m don’t much enjoy whisky, so perhaps I’m not being exactly objective.","tekstr1der","Feb 11, 2015"

Aroma is some what muted, what is there smells of vanilla mixed with chocolate milk and light roast. But again it is very faint, however as it 'breaths' the aroma pronounces itself more. Flavor wins all the points here. Nice marriage of barrel to beer. Chocolate, roast, and vanilla mesh seemlessly with bourbon barrel vanilla and toffee. Velvety smooth mouthfeel and rich. Little hint of alocohole here and there, actually kinda hot-ish for a beer of 9.5%. That's it that's all, great beer here.","pmlondrigan","Jun 20, 2014"

Lots of roasted coffee on the nose. Notes of chocolate, bourbon, and some dark fruit, notably fig. Bourbon on the front of the palate followed by coffee and sweet, dark fruit. Milk chocolate and tobacco on the back end. Nice malty caramel aftertaste. Bourbon gets more and more prominent as it warms. Medium bodied with light carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Overall a solid BA stout, a little over-hyped, but I'd seek it out again!","JohnG190","Feb 20, 2014"

A fantastic russian imperial stout to begin with, gets raised to a complex degree when the booze and the wood are introduced from the bourbon barrel-aging. The nose comes big with notes of booze, tobacco, burnt sugar, and caramel with wood coming through in between. Same again when it comes to the palate. All those flavors with added pleasure of bourbon, and everything that that spirit brings to the table. An exceptional ale.","TheBullsHorn","Feb 17, 2014"

Aroma of loads of rich chocolate fudgy goodness, some roasty grains, bourbon, oak, coconut. Flavor is big sweet chocolate up feont with plenty of bourbon and roast, it finishes with huge vanilla from the barrel, some light coconut and chocolate and oh my lord so smooth. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation, heavy body. This is fantastic. The finish is one of the best and it is so velvety smooth.

The added oakiness (for better lack of term) was a grand addition to an already phenomenal brew. It added a great depth of flavor to the already great stout that Great Lakes has had brewing for a while. The mocha notes that start as you take your first sip are satisfying and enjoyable, while the finish hits you with notes of bourbon and vanilla. If you enjoyed the original, give this one a try. I do not think you will be disappointed.","ynsane","Sep 14, 2013"

Flavor follows suit: malts, oak, vanilla, oak, leathery, a bit of fig, a solid molasses undertone (nothing too overpowering, just a complement), and some nougat.

From the aroma, one gets the hint that this is going to be a good one. A generous boozy aroma jumps out of this one, with malts and dark fruits hiding in the background. In the initial taste, one notes the booze, vanilla, dark fruits, spicy malt, and sweetness that reminds me of gummi bears. In the aftertaste, the taste evolves into burnt sugar with boozy warm malts. The thick texture allows the warming to continue all the way to the belly. This is a really good example of what a barrel aged stout should taste like.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 23, 2013"

4.09,-6.2,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"many thanks to thebrewo for hooking this one up via trade. it is a real treat. pours not quite black, with a shiny glow and an inch or so of rich mocha lather on top. the nose is not alcoholic at all, very impressive. lots of deep roast, some lighter coffee notes, and a lot of vanilla from the bourbon barrel. some char too, but it isn't bitter to the taste at all, and is in fact more on the sweet side. some licorice notes in the taste as well, and a warming chocolaty finish that reminds me of some of the top rated barrel aged imperial stouts on BA. what I love the most about this beer is its feel, its not a big heavy syrupy sticky mess like so many of these can be. its still full bodied, but drinkably so, not weighty or overly sweet or boozy. almost reminds me of the eclipse series, with that touch of honey but pleasant lightness in a dark beer. it seems weird to call this an everyday barrel aged imperial stout, but it kind of is. its something I could see myself drinking a lot more of than many of the others. the buzz is nice, and the finish is glorious, staying on the palate for quite some time. probably the best great lakes offering ive ever had.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

4.14,-5,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"Overall: Excellent bourbon barrel-aged stout, not too over the top but brings plenty of flavour. Sounds like GLBC's modus operandi to me here. It's sweet, dry, hot, bourbon-ey, and bitter all at once. Very complex but not too over the top with any one thing. A true pleasure to sip on. Hopefully I don't black out tonight; that would be ironic. Anyway, this is a bit pricey at $30/4pk and I think I would rather pick up BCBS and hang onto it for a year. That being said, I don't think I would mind buying a 4-pack ever year if I lived close to Cleveland. So that's my 2 cents here- great beer for sure.","Stevedore","May 28, 2013"

While this component of the beer approaches comparability to the top of the heap beers like Bourbon County, the taste strays a bit, focusing much more on the outright presence of booze, and seeing how roasty and charred we could go with the malts. This swings things out of that perfect balance, with loss of necessary sweetness, and what are essentially burnt malts. Sadly this beer marks the rare case where the standard base beer is considerably smoother than the barrel aged version. That being said, this guy sips wells, is certainly palatable, and is a treat for any enthusiast.","TheBrewo","Apr 16, 2013"

There's a touch of sweetness in here, but it's beaten away pretty quickly by the darker, bolder flavors. A very tasty stout, but a bit much if you don't like them dark and nasty.

Excellent barrel-aged stout. Very smooth feel. Some well-blended oxidation really added a nice aged flavor. Great bourbon aroma with a big chocolate and roasted malt flavor.

3.74,-14.2,3,4,3.5,4,4,"651mL 2009 ed courtesy of beeranddogs. The pour is clear cola, not black, with ruby highlights. The beer is almost the opposite of normal Blackout in that you have to really coax a head out of this thing. Even swirling, pouring from ten stories high; the head is about a quarter inch of yellowish tan foam that has okay retention and leaves little swathy lace. I understand that barrel aged beers may have less carbonation and head retention, but after the beer is finished in the barrel, it gets put back into the brite tank for conditioning in the bottle. So it should have good retention and rise up healthily. But the pour is dismal, making it hard to get a big aroma out of the beer. The muted bourbon first comes across a bit oxidized, slight red apples, lots of cocoa butter, and marzipan. As it warms, the nose comes into play with big bourbon, coconut, vanilla. It is quite mellowed out but very apparent. The taste is thinning, a bit watery. Really lacks the richness and bitterness of normal Blackout. There is definitely milk chocolate, warming bourbon, slight oak, lots of vanilla and cream. But the body is not well integrated. Very little carbonation doesn’t help the mouthfeel and lack of bitterness makes the body rely on vanilla and bourbon with no drying oak, no spicy oak, no spicy alcohol even. Just sort of a sweet mess that is hard to fall in love with. 11/8/2010 8/3/7/4/15=3.7","tarheels86","Sep 01, 2012"

4.7,7.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5," The flavor is very full with lots of toffee, cocoa, wood with vanilla and bourbon interwoven with slight coffee and bready flavors from the yeast with a toasted and spiced taste which brings out some dark fruit toward the middle with mild earthy hints of raisin and chocolate toward the finish with oak blending well throughout the flavor. Overall this is a splendid oak aged stout, it satisfied from first taste and I didn't want to drain the glass, but it left me feeling satisfied and it is one of the most drinkable wood aged stouts I have had.","Slatetank","Jul 01, 2012"

4,-8.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from '10 bomber into tulip glass. Pours opaque dark brown color with a small off white creamy head. Smells like chocolate liquor, vanilla, brown sugar and molasses. Initial taste is a medium body that coats the mouth with caramel and roasty smokiness. Quite a lot of warming from alcohol. Finishing with chocolate and warming alcohol presence. Flavor hangs around for a while, but doesn't quite match up to the regular blackout stout that I really love.

My recommendation is to drink this beer at room temperature because this beer really needs time to open up so you can get the most enjoyment/flavor out of this beer.

I like the fresh bottle a little more than the fresh tap. A little more balance, not as much alcohol presence (though there is still some). Not quite as good as some of the elite BBA stouts like BCBS, but a great beer nonetheless.

The nose has probably started to tail off, but the flavors are still bold enough to showcase how well everything has blended and come together. If you’ve got a bottle this old, do something with it, as it’s probably not going to get any better. A very nice balance between barrel and base beer on this one, which we can’t say about every bourbon barrel stout.

The aromas consist of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and toffee. It has a great nose for a bourbon barrel aged stout, with nice complexity. The flavors feature an array of flavors. You get a good amount of roasted malt up front, sweetened by vanilla, bourbon and toffee. It has phenomenal flavor. The bourbon is just the right amount. It drinks very, very smoothly and has great flavor. For a RIS, and a bourbon barrel aged version at that, it has amazing drinkability. It drinks a little fine but it really is fitting.

A small burn from the alcohol makes this one a nice sipper. What an amazing beer.

I must say this is awesome stuff, just like the regular version. Aromatics big oak barrel whiskey aging effects hints of vanilla/toffee and oak going strong, a touch of anise and dark chocolate/coffee roasted malts with a hint of cherry fruitiness going on. Flavor is layered with a balanced whiskey barrel aging and rock solid big stout flavors, probably the most drinkable version out there beside fresh KBS. Again big alcohol but not overly boozey, just some whiskey barrel aged vanilla/charred oak/and hints of cherry to go with a big ol' stout from Cleveland. Dark roasted malts bring out some dark chocolate notes but not much in the way of strong coffee tones. Mouthfeel is full bodied defnitely warming and even carbonation some versions are almost flat this one had enough bubbles flowing to make each sip easy going on the palate.

The aromatics are a little on the bourbon side with some caramel malt mixed in. This is apparently still a pretty hot beer. The taste confirmed the punch of the bourbon, but the oak and the vanilla helped calm down. Interestingly the roast and chocolate flavors were secondary to the bourbon barrel notes. This was a tad astringent still, but not too much to not really enjoy this beer. It was a pleasure drinking this beer, and it goes to show GLBC can make good beer. Why they don't do it more often, I can't say.","Vdubb86","Feb 23, 2011"

The nose is dominated by chocolate and bourbon, though there are some traces of dark fruit lingering in there too. Taste is once again, big on the bourbon and dark chocolate, with the alcohol really packing a punch. Mouthfeel is definitely viscous and filling. A few sips of this brew warms the blood quite a bit. This one works well drinking wise if sipped over a long period of time, however the big body and the hot alcohol might make this a beer better to share amongst friends, or family in my case.

Smells extremely good...lots of chocolate and vanilla, with a rum/bourbon note, forcasting an alcohol filled deliciousness. Deep chocolate malt odor too, I can almost smell the crushed grain. Flavor is equally rewarding...big and chocolaty, with obvious oak and vanilla undertones. Barrel aging has not overwhelmed this beer, but actually improved it (and considerably, in my estimation) No extreme bitterness, just a hint of espresso.

So I asked if they mixed the batches or went straight from barrel to keg. Evidently they mix them. So, I rate with an emphasis on the good days. This beer can be impressive.

Aroma was a dead giveaway which one was oak aged. The oak aged was a lot more subdued and "earthy" than the regular. Side by side the barrel aged doesn't look any lighter than the regular. The mouthfeel of the oak is creamier than the original. There is a definite texture difference, carbonation is weak in both brews but is practically non-existent in the oak aged. This gives the oak aged a softer feel in the mouth. Regular is much more strong in alcohol flavor. This is why this brew is made for oak. The oak aged is smooth with sweetness to match. Alcohol is in the background but never detracts from the flavor profile. (Major weakness of the reg. b/o) Hints of smoke, oak, coffee, and licorice. This is one of the better stouts out there.

4.22,-3.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Huge thanks to miketd for so generously offering up a bottle of this rarity!! Dark, opaque black pour that holds a light to medium head poured into a snifter. Nose is rich and complex with dark semi-sweet roasted malt, an appropriate and not overwhelming amount of bourbon, and notes of spicy oak and vanilla. Very good job of incorporating the barrell, and not just the bourbon. Flavor is dark and roasty with a good amount of bourbon and a woodsy, light vanilla and almost spiced flavor to go along. Alcohol came into play as it warmed up a bit more than I'd like, but even with that, it was a fantastic beer, and most importantly, the bourbon barrel didn't ruin the beer, but added new complementing flavors. Fantastic.","JDV","Feb 25, 2008"
4.32,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A sipping beer here and quit high in alcohol. Not to thick a beer this is quite close to bourbon and coffee with crème in flavor and sensation. Still this is the sort of beer like KBS that is a one a night type of beer.","Zorro","Feb 14, 2008"
4.8,10.1,5,5,5,5,4,"I see quite a few outside the Cleveland area have got to try this one. I've never had it in the bottle, only straight from the tap:) It has all the characteristics of the regular blackout to me. I taste dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, and a hint of woodiness. The barrel aged adds the distinct flavor of bourbon, and also intensifies the woodiness. The first couple sips will definitely warm your throat. Probably not for anyone that thinks the average stout or porter is too intense. The only reason I gave drinkability a 4 is because of the abv% and richness, a couple will do just fine. I always look forward to this one every autumn. Overall, a very unique beer that any stout fan that can get their hands on some should try.","mwegryn","Jan 20, 2008"
4.56,4.6,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a midnight black with a one finger tan colored head that quickly dies down to an outter ring of bubbles. Thin webbing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is a wonderful blend of roasted barley, carmelized sugar, vanilla, raisins, bourbon, almond, and smoked oak. Sweet aroma overall, extremely enjoyable. Probably one of the best smelling RIS I've ever put my nose to. Smokey caramel malt up front with fresh ground coffee flavors. Bourbon and whiskey sweetness on the tongue from start to finish, but just the right amount. Aftertaste is almost oatmeal stout like with kick. Not the heavy body most RIS have, but for that reason I love the mouthfeel. Slick carbonation that coats the mouth. I really like this twist on the style. I could see some people not liking this because of the almost thin mouthfeel, but to each their own. I'm a bit up in the air as to whether or not age will help this one, but I have an extra bottle so what the hell, let's give it a shot.","BeerTruth","Jan 17, 2008"

4.35,-0.2,4,4,5,4.5,3.5,"This is not the barrel aged stout!... There needs to be a distinction created between the barrel-aged, which is a twelve year process, and simply, the annual "black out stout. " I've had both, I was at the brewpub on the 2006 release of the barrel... and i also enjoy it annually. Basically, the age provides the detph you might expect, but eitherway this beer is awesome. I have had both bottles and draft...it'll get you drunk! It's one of the best non-imperial stouts I've every enjoyed... BUT this is first Great Lakes I've reviewed...and (not to be arrogant) but I believe I have a complex beer pallate for a 22 year old, I believe the all Great Lakes beers have such a distinct and acquired/different taste, that once you dig in... your done, it's awesome...must be the water, but hopefully not Lake Erie.

4.23,-3,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a thick like motor oil black color with a light brown creamy head that sticks around to leave a fair amount of lacing on the top of my pint glass. Smell is like a cookie with milk chocolate and some dark coffee notes, as well as the roasted malt aroma. Taste is moderately sweet with a bittersweet finish. Medium mouthfeeling with a creamy dry texture, and soft carbonation allowing the bourbon notes to really kick in.","genog","Dec 03, 2007"

3.55,-18.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,3,"Somehow this beer is strangely thin; I would like it to be a bit more full, textured and rich. This does have enough complexity though to keep it interesting. This really needs to be served on the warm side of cool (no where near the 45°F mentioned on the bottle); somewhere north of 60°F / 16°C should do it; at this temperature it picks up a bit more fullness and perhaps a touch more round, malt flavors to help balance things out. Compared to the regular version though, this beer is really missing a lot of malt character & complexity; seems some how heavily filtered (which can actually mechanically happen inside a barrel) and stripped down. Not bad, just not the beer it was originally.","Gueuzedude","Oct 19, 2007"
3.43,-21.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This is a good beer, but the alcohol flavor, together with the thin watery mouthfeel is a turnoff. I thought it would age better, but I think I liked it better last year.","babyhobbes","Jul 23, 2007"
4.62,6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep ebony with a very pretty brown/tan head; the nose is as good or better than any Ive smelled before with sweet carmel, alcohol, and a little bit of carbon (almost the best part of the beer); flavors of chocolate, coffee, csndy sugar and, malt impress upon you a general feeling that you will want more; the body is heavy but not cloying; the finish tells you that it was aged in bourbon barrels and leaves almost the full flavor of the beer in you mouth. This is one fantastic beer, it ties for first in my book.","dankman38","Jun 04, 2007"
4,-8.3,4,4,4,4,4,"22oz Bottle. Rambling aroma of thinning nuts, fire and marshmallow. Coffees come forth, but fade quickly. Subdued and absent. Pours deep brown with ruby corners and a rim of tan. Light carbonation. A machismo of coffee rubs against the grain of background wood and toothy sugars. Chewiness absent. Bright and nostril burning. Fairly dry and not overly heavy. Nutty dry. Smack excels in this beer with a never ending carousel of left over coffee tannins, chocolate dust, chipotle and edges of earth. Thanks for sharing, Andy!","CharlesDarwin","May 14, 2007"

4.05,-7.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Bottle 360 of 900 from 2006 release. Pours black, an agressive pour yields a very small light to medium tan head that quickly fades. Aroma is somewhat smoky like burnt leaves, a light cocoa sweetness and cola aroma leads into a boozy and woodiness. Some soft sweet vanilla up front in the taste, slightly cola-y before a good bite of alcohol and drying finish. Leaves a nice roasty dry aftertaste with a small bit of tangy acidity. Medium to heavy in body, quite soft on the palette at first, finishes with a decent bite and drying hoppy and woodiness.

4.77,9.4,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"22 oz. bomber. 9% ABV. Bottle 51 of 900 from 2006. Big thanks to mcallister for picking this one up for me, and bringing it to me. Pours pitch black with virtually no highlights. Thick frothy mocha head trickles down to 1/2 inch rather quickly, but remains as a nice collar for some time. Roasty, oaky, and vanilla aroma. A bit boozy, bot not overly hot. Roasty flavor up front followed by burtn sugar, caramel, and finishing with a nice chocolate flavor. Throughout, the oak character compliments everything perfectly. The barrel flavor does not overwhelm, but sits in the background to lend a hand. Very smooth mouthfeel, a bit thin, with lower carbonation. Nice amount of sweetness. Warming, but not overpowering. This is a great example of how barrel aging can compliment an already solid beer, without overdoing it. Fantastic. Great Lakes never ceases to amaze me.","Bierguy5","Jan 24, 2007"

4,-8.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Smooth roasted dark chocolate in the fore is followed by a heavy bourbon blast which then rolls toward vanilla, roasted/burnt malt and milk chocolate flakes and creamed coffee.

4.53,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Pours a dense black color and thin layer of lace swirl. Not too much in the nose (this might account for being poured too cold) but faintly detectable notes of chocolate, espresso, and bourbon. The taste is outstanding with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, brown sugar and roasted malts all surrounded by a blanket of smooth bourbon character. Bourbon increases towards the end of the gulp and is even more apparent in the finish along with some sweet, chary, aged oak bourbon barrel notes. Mouth feel is very smooth. This brew is enormously enjoyable and despite its nine percent abv, it goes extremely easily.","cabsandking","Oct 30, 2006"

A rich creamy middle is consumed with a chocolate covered cherry, black curran, crème brulee, and burnt malts. Entry is a bit thin but it evens itself out. Smooth and viscous overall.
