3.8,0.5,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a very dark brown with some ruby highlights. Cocoa dominates the aroma but mixes with a  bit cedar. Tastes of cocoa and molasses with a curious caramel sweetness. Finishes somewhat dry, but sticky chocolate/burnt marshmallow sweetness coats the tongue but the bitter dark grains and hops seem to keep the beer from being too sweet. It's dryness makes it a dangerously drinkable imperial stout.","marcobrau","Mar 29, 2015"

4.21,11.4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Black colour, I mean really black colour, with light brown lacing that lasts. Aroma is roasted malt with definite cocoa and coffee smells. The taste is much like I discribe in the aroma but with a vanilla twist. Aftertaste is when the hops sneak through but is balances well with the sweet malts. Mouthfeel is light for a stout. Overall a quite enjoyable beer. I think I'll have another.","vikinggary28","Mar 06, 2015"
4.01,6.1,4.5,3.5,4,5,4,"Midnight black with very dark brown color when held to the light. Dark tan lacing that persists for a long time. The smell is faint, but noticeable smell of espresso and alcohol, which also predominates in the taste. An initial espresso sweetness turns into burnt toast taste with a nutella sweetness--not really chocolate. Anise and bitter earthy hops take over as a long-lasting pleasant bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent--viscous and creamy, easily oxygenated in the mouth.  Generally a very solid imperial stout, but not one of the best. I'd buy and drink again.","takusan1000","Mar 04, 2015"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/2/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, herbal, and roasted/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Russian imperial stout style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 06, 2015"

4,5.8,,,,,,"Lagunitas delivers a fairly typical Imperial Stout but with a touch of ""west coast"" thrown in. It displays dark bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, milk-chocolate covered espresso beans, almost burnt-sugar, burnt toast, dark caramel, dark skinned fruits, and some minor black currant backed by minty, piney, floral and leafy/grassy hops. It's a touch spicy as well but I'm not sure if that's from hops or alcohol, and there's also a minor suggestion of Bourbon as well. There's almost a smokiness to it just before the swallow, and then it gives off notes of licorice and ash. It lingers, slowly fading, eventually giving up a ghost of ashen-smoke, leaves, and Bourbon. The real flavor, however, is at the front where all of the chocolate is, and it's got great depth of flavor, if not as full in body as some might expect. For the price, this is a steal!","NeroFiddled","Nov 22, 2014"

Taste pretty much matches the aromas with the roasted coffee being upfront and most noticeable on the palate. Slight sign of carbonation and pretty solid medium bodied brew with a smooth/slick mouthfeel. I found this Imperial Stout to be better than expected. Well done Lagunitas!","dpgoblejr","Aug 05, 2014"

This deep, dark, and dense brew is opaque brown grading into black territory with a copious quantity of tan head. A rather fizzy stout and it smells absolutely astonishing. Quite smoky initially, then gets uber-sweet, redolent with burnt toffee, dates, dark chocolate sauce, vanilla, and a hint of citrus hop. Surprisingly almost no alcohol on the nose for such a big beer.... that shows up in spades on the palate though. Taste is a mosaic of aggressive dark malts, earthy tobacco-like hops, coffee grinds, a herbal note like licorice, and dry ash ... There is an initial warm sweetness like chocolate sauce and pecan pie but this does not persist as long as expected, at which point things evolve into a semi-dry oak wood ashy bitterness along with a large blast of aromatic alcohol that after a while starts to recall cinnamon extract (think those little red candies from Valentine's Day). My eyes started to water about half way though a pint, perhaps I should have shared this with somebody. Buttery, thick mouthfeel prolongs the experience. Rather whiskey-like in some ways. Tinges of hop resin put in an appearance. A sweet booze bomb. Solid Russian imperial stout if a tad coarse, astringent and aggressive.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 01, 2014"

BACS is one of the two or three best BA stouts I've ever had. This brew doesn't stand up with the former two, but it's still damn good. Rich and flavorful. I'm still confused as to why the aroma is so weak. Nevertheless, that's basically unimportant. Really good stout.","PieOhMy","Oct 11, 2013"

It does not have near the body thickness that it need to be an Imperial stout. It is much more hoppy than most r.i.s. I've had, not that r.i.s. cant be hoppy (Brau Brother's Ivan the Great is THE hoppiest stouts, [fresh of course] that I have ever had) There is not much of the normal aromas and flavor depths that you get from most r.i.s. either. some booziness and roasted malts and hops in the aroma and the flavor is pretty much the same, booziness not really well masked. the price is definitely the best thing about this beer.","Beerlover","Oct 03, 2013"

It does seem to drink like a beer that is too young. It would be interesting to see what time would do. The abv is there, but the beer just doesn't seem to have the type of malt body that would smooth and mellow out like some do. It's priced very well, but even still I don't see it making much noise in this market when there are other quality options readily available, particularly in the 4-pack 12oz format.","ryan1788a5","Sep 29, 2013"

Not bad, but it's just not as balanced as some of it's competition, it's a little booze heavy and the earthy hops combined with the bitter espresso tones just make it slightly off balance, but it's still enjoyable.","Roman5150","Jun 25, 2013"

Medium bodied, smooth at first but the alcohol is hot & burns the throat on the way down. Overall, it's different than other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had in the past. It actually seemed more like a Baltic Porter, especially with the fruitiness and lack of roastiness. Not bad, but unfortunately I wouldn't buy it again.","barnzy78","Feb 04, 2013"

Smell is very boozy, pungently alcoholic even. Nothing too exotic or unexpected with notes of bakers chocolate, espresso, wheat bread, caramel, dark fruits. Flavor is equally strong but well balanced. The malt and chocolate notes come through the most with a hint of sweetness making it very easy to drink. The alcohol is far less apparent in the flavor than the smell. This beer is overwhelmingly underrated in my opinion. Read my Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout review.

3.84,1.6,3,4,4,3,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a good RIS, I have had many beers from Lagunitas but all them have been pretty hoppy so I didn't know what they could do with this style but they ended up making a pretty traditional RIS where the roasted malts are the highlight and the hops take a back seat. This beer had good drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, wasn't overly boozy and if I wasn't splitting this bottle with my brother I don't think I would have a hard time drinking it by myself. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything too off or out of style with this RIS. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher then normal carbonation and the fact that it wasn't as roasty and robust as some of the better RIS's. I'm pretty sure I will buy this beer again next time they release it and I recommend this to anyone who likes the style. I was pretty satisfied with this RIS, it's not up there with my favorites of the style but it is still a good and tasty RIS that hit the spot on a cold winter night, I was unsure how good a dark beer from Lagunitas would turn out but they proved to me that they just aren't a tasty hoppy beer brewery, they have more range then I thought and that only further cements my feeling that they are one of my favorite out of state brewery's, keep making tasty beers and I'll keep drinking them.","StoutHunter","Feb 02, 2012"

It looks good, smells good and tastes good but I expected a little more when drinking a lagunitas beer. They are usually extremely out of the ordinary and very special to drink. You can definitely smell and taste the roasted malt character and it is a bit sweet. I have to admit for an imperial stout it is very smooth and east to drink. I just think about there cappuccino stout and how you can really taste the cappuccino and felt as though i was drinking an iced coffee. With this beer I was unable to find that defining characteristic, other than the roasted malt, that would make this beer really special.

I poured this into a snifter glass, however the aroma is not over the top. Some burnt coffee notes, dark toffee, and burnt malt. Taste has a bit of a smoky feel to it, with the dryness balancing out any sweetness in the malt. Like bitterness and acidity on the end of the taste. No real cream aspects to speak of, and nothing that screams stout to me per say. Mouthfeel is actually quite watery for the style. High alcohol percentage that is present in the taste, and I kind of enjoy for the smokey aspect of it. Overall I like this beer, but style wise I would probably go for some better representations of this style. Overall I generally love Lagunitas, and I find this beer to be good, but not quite what I was expecting.","ely2000k","Jan 22, 2012"

Lighter coloring than typical - with some translucence showing through. Aroma is subdued burnt caramel and coffee. Taste is a bit underwhelming for what I would expect from Lagunitas - some coffee and licorice but prune and molasses (not a good thing) as well. Alcohol well hidden. Mouthfeel rather dull - just doesn't have that tongue-coating-you'll-still-be-left-with-tomorrow-morning-when-you-wake-up that you come to expect with the better imperials stouts.

Decent lacing along with the viscous coating typical of this style. Many hints of flavor but nothing dominating: molasses, black licorice, coffee and chocolate, even a dried fruit flavor reminiscent of a dubbel style, but nothing is either overbearing or pronounced. Flavor remains consistent despite temperature change; warming does not reveal any nuances. A 22oz. bottle would have been good to share with someone, but was a little bit of work for a single person.

The nose is dominated by chocolate, coffee and a tinge of alcohol. The mouth is a little thinner than I'd like, but it is slightly oily and definitely not weak.

The liquid isn't really black, more like the darkest possible brown this side of black, razor thin aura of orange at the glass bottom. The nose is all about rich, milky chocolate, cocoa, vanilla fudge and caramel with a candied orange infusion, no substantial roast nor toast, just sweetness which also infects/infuses any hoppy pine, herb nuances, blindfolded you would think you were in a Hershey's factory. Full-bodied, softly contoured and expansive in the mouth, close to sloppy bear hug status. Cola, licorice and a lighter orange reduction swirled into the milk chocolate and caramel foundation. Carbonation is average to slightly below. Follows the nose with a good punch of pine and green matter, the hops sinewy and active under all the malts.

Taste was much the same, with stronger chocolate taking front stage. Sweet malts were also present. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy and was heavier than the appearance suggested.

Now clocking in at 10.14% I can't even remember what the 8.2% version tasted like. Considering the strength of the beer I was expecting something a little thicker and a little darker. The beer has a thin head and is a very dark brown color opposed to athe jet black color of other stouts I've tasted along the same lines. This beer dose however have a very pleasent smell and taste. The bitter aftertaste dosn't stay on my palate very long. Somewhat of a disapointment. I would have prefered something a little less dry with a stronger, longer lasting bitter aftertaste. The beer is very thin, goes down fairly easy. This one has a beautiful taste, not the best. But certainly not the worst. A worthy purchase and a great beer","michaeljasmin","Nov 22, 2010"

Although the coffee is not as stand-out as Peche Mortel (the alcohol takes up the lack of coffee flavor), there are a lot of similar features (mouthfeel as well). The chocolate and nuttiness along with the coffee make this a very tasty brew. As it warms, the alcohol makes itself more noticeable.

Definite dark roasted coffee, with a coffee bitterness that blooms on the middle of the tongue. Light chocolatey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little too watery for an Imperial Stout.

2.75,-27.2,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours a surprisingly clear deep brown with intense ruby highlights. The appearance has me a little concerned right off the bat when expecting a bit more depth and darkness from an RIS. The head created a slight and quickly disappearing layer of beige head. The aroma, although slightly roasted, also concerns me before I take my first sip. The slight diacytel and all malt smells immediately remind me of a dopplebock and not an RIS. Coming from Lagunitas, I was anticipating the always-present hop punch, but that was nowhere to be found. The taste follows suit on the dopplebock. A slightly buttery and metallic taste seems far from a stout and confuses my mental palate. There seems to be very little that resembles an RIS. I am not an advocate of style guidelines at all, but this one just doesn't fit the bill for me. Lagunitas has never failed me and I consider them to be one of the best West Coast brewers that have kept it real on the price gouging of other brewers. They have earned a great reputation, but this one is a definite miss. I LOVE a good RIS, but this one is a bit tough to put down.

Medium-bodied but a little thinnish for an Imperial Stout, the ABV is hidden well and it is more of a sweet and smooth malt taste with less dryness on the backbite than most heavy stouts.

Poured a deep dark brown, essentially black with a large tan colored head. Nice slow retention left behind copious amounts of side lace. Smell was full of roasted coffee, chocolate, and an almost Brandy like aroma. Very thick with a bit of a sweet note to it. The taste followed along almost exactly. Very full bodied, rich and creamy feel let you really enjoy the bold dominating flavors of dark chocolate and coffee and the long finish helped you find some of the more subtle hints of a hoppy finish. Just the smallest touch of an alcohol warming, but nothing that really took you over. Overall this was an excellent sipper, really had the dessert, or late night feel to it. An excellent big stout, very complex and nice and full. I liked this one a lot and would say it was definitely worth a shot.","mikesgroove","Aug 13, 2007"

The head was loud and fizzy, it was beige in color, and it looked like soda. Sadly the head made a lot of noise but it failed to hold well, in fact there was nothing left in a moment. This is disappointing. There was no subsequent lacing. The first sniff of the nose said Milk Stout. Is this an Imperial Milk Stout or just a sissy Imperial Stout? Im thinking the latter. Lightly roasted with kisses of cocoa and some coffee. Light herbal hop notes. Man, the nose is sad. Sure there is nothing bad about the bouquet but where is the big roasted qualities? BA labels this as a Double American Stout, so where are the hops, where is the alcohol? Where is anything that says, Im a big fucking beer! The nose is not inviting, it is not offensive but it is boring. The palate is dull; this is more of a Sweet Stout than anything else. This beer is mislabeled. The palate has sweetness throughout; there is light acidity, kisses of char, some chocolate, and some coffee too. None of the aforementioned flavors are loud. This beer is not tasty. Where is the 8.2% abv? Where are the burnt qualities? Where are the hops? Hello? Mr. Bitterness are you there? *Dead Air* The middle is empty, the finish is sweet and almost cloying. This beer is annoying me. What is the point of this beer? I fail to see one. I like nothing more than mediocre beer parading as something special. Unlimited Release that is too bad, this puppy should be shot like Old Yeller. Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation, the mouthfeel is warm and slick. Not Big Stout-like. The aftertaste is the strongest aspect of this beer; it is warm, mildly fruity with a kiss of hops. But this fails to save this beer. Drink with cheesecake or dont drink it at all. Seriously. It is not an Imperial Stout and it is a very average bigger Milk Stout. Find an alternative. Im very disappointed that I purchased this beer on-line from Liquid Solutions. I selected it because I wanted a couple beers from Langunitas but they were out of the others and I substituted, I should have dropped this beer while I was at it. Live and learn.

The flavour starts out with almost a cloying sweetness, coating the palate with a sugary film. It lingers until the finish, where a touch of roasted malt and chocolate make small cameo appearances, and some coffee lingers on the aftertaste. All the action seems to happen after the show, you feel like you ended up eating dessert first, ruining your palate for the surf n' turf to follow, even the salad bar. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, no real body to it. What am I drinking again? Mommy, this can't be an Imperial stout, can it? However, on the flip side, with the sweetness and small touches of chocolate and coffee, this would make an okay dessert beer in small quantities. Pour it into stemware, and get everyone else to help you finish off the bottle. They never have to know the real story.

Aromas start off sweet with hints of dark fruits and just a touch of roasted malt. The body to this brew is super thin which is adds to my dissapointment. There is almost no bitterness throughout, but there are tones of light coffee and cocoa in the mix. The finish consists of a strong lactic acid taste to it...

Flavors are not the chocolate/roasted/bitter flavors you expect, but more sweet caramel.  A decent brew that goes down easy, but definitely not at the top of the class.","jreitman","Jun 11, 2002"
3.03,-19.8,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Ouch.  Lagunitas Brewing really needs to consider removing this from their product line all together, or even better, start the recipe from scratch.  Thin bodied, withered malt/hop profile, subdued smoked fruit aroma.  Lagunitas is an excellent brewery, pray they are visiting beer advocate and will take what seems to be our unanimous advice.","Jordan","Apr 23, 2002"
3.25,-14,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Bottle is very charged, took me a while to get a normal presentation in the glass.  Very dark brown, not ruby, but not completely opaque.  Darker head is impressively sturdy, holds shapes well at many heights.  Musty smell, some impressions of smoke and acrid stuff.  Somewhat coating.  Not a lot of complexity, honestly some coffee and chocolate flavors and a touch of something evoked by the smell of flowers, like lilacs.  Looked for fruits or alcohol notes but didn't find much of a changing impression.  I don't hate this brew but it lacks an Imperial's promise of variety and complexity.","ADR","Mar 27, 2002"
2.45,-35.2,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"There's a decent roasted character in aroma.  That's about it. Appearance is very close to black.  Creamy brown head with no retention and no lacing ability.  This beer is medium to full bodied.  Should be fuller in my opinion.  The taste is very lacking for an imperial.  I've had porters and BROWNS that have been more complex (see DF Indian Brown and Rogue Hazelnut).  This is pretty weak for an imperial.  Pretty thin for the style too.  I get slight roasted and chocolate malt qualities.  Very little bitterness.  Not recommended.","Bighuge","Sep 12, 2001"
2.69,-28.8,2,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Aroma is fruity...an odd smell I've come to find in Lagunitas beers...It might just be me but I find it unpleasant..black with a creamy head..pretty creamy mouthfeel...slight tart hoppy bite on the finish..not super thick, tasty or complex...doesn't have the qualities of other imperials I have tried...some sweet milk chocolate taste...easy drinking but thin for an imperial...some fruitiness, and some sourness on the deep finish....I'm unimpressed overall...there are A LOT better imperials out there...A LOT...","ZAP","Beers"
2.76,-27,4,3,2,4,3,"The biggest mistake was putting the word Imperial on the label. Great sweet stout but it is seriously lacking in Imperial quality. If just said ""Stout"" on the label it probably would have gotten a 3.5 to 3.75 above average.","mattmaples","0"
