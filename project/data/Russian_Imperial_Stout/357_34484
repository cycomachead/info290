It's black as ink with a coffee head that will last long after the sun burns out. The smell is laced with coffee and dark chocolate notes. The taste is amazing with coffee and sweetness from the malt coming in at different times during the taste. It's complex, yet without being overbearing. The mouthfeel is pure velvet and coats your throat down to your stomach. This is the beer that I compare all other stouts to.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 03, 2014"

Let down my expectations a bit, I think this one definitely needs the bourbon-barrel to add some character and depth. There are so many other great ones out there, but worth a try to have once.

I also love that the abv isn't through the roof. it allows for more intake, and thus more reflection. overall this is an outstanding stout, a great illustration of the style, and a beer that I may never have gotten to try if it weren't for a great trade with thebrewo. cheers for this!","StonedTrippin","Apr 15, 2013"

Aromas are creamy, with a mocha blending leaning slightly on the bitter side. Flavors are supersmooth, with a healthy underlying kick from the ABV. Bitter and dark roasted coffee throughout, with some dark, bittersweet chocolate overtones and earthy, roasted highlights. There is a subtle sweetness that jumps in at the end of the palate...seems like a tangy caramel. The body remains smooth throughout, but is light enough to be drinkable. Another solid boozey bite in the aftertaste, as well as a roasty and bitter blend. The finish is smooth and bitter at the same time; creamy, yet sharp. Very dynamic, solidly brewed RIS.

One of the thicker Imp stouts I've ever seen, kind of reminds me of the pour I got out of CCB Zhukov. Smell- Dark chocolate, some graininess, ovaltine, mocha coffee. Smells great. Taste- WHOA. Dark fruits, Aggressive bitterness, the thickness of this coats my mouth with a super rich thick bitter dark chocolate. This is delicious, super complex, well made RIS.

Big roasted malt flavor to start, coffee too. Settles into a sweeter blend of flavors. Syrupy chocolate, molasses, cream and fudge. Hints of earthy hops, licorice, and ever so tiny notes of alcohol on the finish. Tasty blend of flavors, has all of the roastyness, the sweetness and the more unique RIS flavors that you'd come to expect from a good example of the style.","uustal","Mar 20, 2012"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"2010 vintage. Gotta love those glasses, baby. This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by a finger or so of dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, light brown sugar, and toasted caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the usual stout notes of roast and chocolate coming to the fore, taking charge without o'erwhelming everything else. The body is a light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth and lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice impy stout. That's all I can say. I think I was expecting something exceptional, though, and got something only really good. I hope that makes sense...","TMoney2591","Feb 04, 2012"

Very roasty and super enjoyable. I don't know how much the recipe for this brew changes from year to year but I can firmly state that I fully enjoyed this with ~2 years of age on it.

4.47,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Finally popped open one of my 2006 bottles of this coveted brew and was not disappointed. The color was a deep black mahogany with just a hint of translucence at the edges. Thick and dark, it produces a modest head that holds in a milk chocolate colored ring while the lacing is only fair. The aroma is sweet licorice and malt with a vague ham hint that is intoxicating. Definitely with an accent on sweet. The flavor incorporates these same elements with a definitive addition of chocolate coffee and sharp lemon on the front/middle of your tongue. Delicious. This is a heavy bodied brew but is exceptionally smooth and a bit satiny. The flavor invites considerable swilling but the constitution of this vintage brew keeps it as a flavor treat only. Booziness is really not significant in my assessment. I've had the 2008 before and this older sample was no disappointment. Once again, this proves to be one of the better imperial stouts around.","Durge","Sep 16, 2011"

4.37,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pouring a thick, inky black with a thick, dark brown head that recedes slowly leaving nice lacing, this is a good looking stout. The nose is fantastic. Rich, dark chocolate, creamy and bitter with a mellow coffee, a pleasing roasty bitterness and a mild yeasty spice reminiscent of anise, this beer has aged gracefully. There's even a hint of fruity tartness, not unlike a mild cherry character, that works wonderfully. These flavors are replicated on the palate, opening with the blend of dark chocolate, mildly sweet, some coffee and roast. Again, there's some fruit character here, a blend of the oxidative dark fruit character that's moderate, and just that hint of tartness. The spice appears mid-palate, working well with the chocolate, and lingers on into the finish. Medium-full in body, this beer is mildly carbonated, yielding a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with some wonderful flavors on the finish. A graceful beer, the only complaint I have with it is the price - $10 for a 12oz beer is a bit much, but oh well, I would gladly drink it again.","DefenCorps","Jun 13, 2011"

4.6,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5," The flavor is so malty yet layered with lots of different elements, sure there is the malt flavor which is pretty nice and caramel saturated, but the yeast gives a nice gentle fruitiness underneath the sweet elements and mild roasted tinges. The flavor has a good toasted grain tinge and accents of hops and alcohol buoy the overall Imperial quality of the stout, I will say again this is so well crafted it gives the impression of a mid strength not a high gravity stout. The smooth cocoa element is what stands out to me with some woody elements and gentle alcohol in the finish w/ some pine notes from the hops. The beer finishes semi-dry. I think Imperial Stout Trooper deserves all the praise it gets it is such a splendid Imperial Stout it is a great example of the style.

Way over the top with the hops, totally washing out the chocolate, coffee and roasted flavors. I've had less hoppy black IPAs. The balance of the hops and the base beer is not as finely crafted as say Darkness. The mouthfeel is nice, carbonated and not overly sweet like some RIS's. Basically, I didn't like this beer. They either covered over a bland base beer with mega hops, or they totally ruined a good base beer by over hopping it. Either way, I found it to be frustrating. A big saving grace is the complete lack of alcohol in the flavor.","seeswo","Apr 22, 2011"

A fair amount of floral hops in the nose accompanied by faint spicy molasses notes. The taste is just incredible as I was led to believe. Begins with semi-sweet chocolate and molasses flavors, hints of vanilla come through in the flavor profile. Fades to a roasted french vanilla coffee flavor with a nutty (hazelnut?) flavor lingering on my taste buds. Heavy is the word I would choose to describe the feel of this beer.

Upon first sip, immediately noticeable is the mouthfeel. The body is so thick and creamy, it can be felt on the lips and on the palate. Flavor at center is very roasty, coffee notes given off from the roasted barley. There are some woody aspects in the center, but the finish rounds out with a hell of a lot of sweetness. Earthy hop counterbalance cuts through the thick malt sugars at the finish, leaving some grainyness that mixes well with the roasted malts. Finish leaves an impressive flavor of enhanced chocolate flavor while the thick stout disapates from the palate.

First of all this beer start with a strong foot forward for a simply very cool bottle design. Bonus Points. The actual beer looks nice too! It pours black with about an inch of creamy looking mocha colored head. Nice retention and thin lacing. I'm impressed. Ah! A big roasty RIS, I've been dying for one. This has a big aroma of roasted malts that have a bit of a smokey aroma, followed by dark fruits, cocoa and what I can only place as leather. I can faintly smell alcohol, but I think I'm a drug dog when it comes to smelling it and it's not overpowering anything. This really smells great, I'm impressed once again. The taste is mirroring the smell mostly. Big dark roasted malts, a bit of cocoa and bitter coffee finishing with a slight syrupy sweetness and dark fruits. It ends with a slightly smokey and earthiness as well. The mouthfeel is silky and thick with subtle carbonation kicking in to nicely liven up the brew. One of the more drinkable and enjoyable Russian Imperial Stouts in my opinion. I'll certainly seek this out again.","Bendurgin","Sep 22, 2010"

Bitter chocolate, assorted starbucks coffee flavored beverages, roasted malt, and an earthy/woodiness. Unlike the less than powerful aroma the taste is the opposite. Tons of flavor, this one isn't messing around. Lots of chocolate and coffee, some smoke, and more of those assorted Starbucks beverages (frappucinos and the like). Its full bodied...Drinkability suffered a bit for me. I don't know why but it took me a long time to put down my helping. I was ready to be done with out after my 7-9 oz pour.

I tasted lots of dark malt and roasted coffee up front, the bitterness of which was balanced by semi-sweet chocolate like Nestle morsels.

The bitter earthy ""stout"" taste seems to linger with it, and a little more chocolate and dark fruit come out late on the finish. The taste also sticks with me for hours after I'm done drinking as it seems to have filled all the pours in my mouth and acted like concrete to just settle and never leave.

4.13,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Had the pleasure of finding this brew on tap the Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Received from draft in a twelve ounce pub glass. The dark atmosphere made it hard to get a good look at the color and opacity but from what I could tell it was jet black, allowing no light to pierce it. A short wispy, mocha colored head was fading away as I was handed the beer. It was served to me at a pleasantly warm temperature...glad they know what they are doing there. I can clearly smell coffee, followed by bitter chocolate and burnt maltiness. Faint hops and alcohol in there as well. Nothing too complex coming from this beer. The taste is what you would imagine from the smell; coffee and bitter chocolate with a slight hop and alcohol at the end helping to give it a smooth finish. Some pleasant fruit notes emerge from the darkness. It is very drinkable, evidenced by the three glasses I quickly drank. The body however was lacking. Maybe this is a tap issue? Most reviews I have read from the bottle say the body is great, but to me it was thin on the palate. I would have expected it to be more viscous, creamy and rich. Don't get me wrong, this was a great beer that I am really glad to have tried, but still not the best stout I have ever had and I was expecting a little more complexity from it.","mjn5036","Jan 26, 2010"

It's damn smooth with a stiff patent malt flavor. It's bitter and bold with a nice roasted/chocolate character. The hops are quite noticeable and really integrate well with the black malt character.

4.41,4.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours pitch black into a snifter at the Armsby Abbey in Worcester. One finger light cocoa colored head with good retention. Head is creamy with small bubbles and after it dissipates a small cloud coats the top of the beer. Thick lacing coats the glass as I drink this one down. Smell blasts me with coffee initially and then huge roasty malts. Earthy hops are also in the mix. I also get a burnt sugar/caramel malt scent too. This is a pretty standard RIS smell, nothing really jumps out at me. A bit more strength on the smell would be nice. Taste is gigantically roasty malts. They coat the sides of my tongue while earthy hops hit the middle. I like the earthy hops and how they work but I think they are a bit generic for a hop taste. Cant get the coffee in the taste but the roasted malts are good enough to satisfy me. I burp out fresh hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth medium thick bodied with lower carbonation. This level of gas suits the tastes very well. Alcohol is pretty non-existant in the taste and MF. Huge coat of hops stays on the tongue after sipping. Drinkability is nice. The taste is worth the price I paid for this on-tap. It is not too over the top for an RIS and is a great example of the style. The roasty flavors are what I look for in an RIS, no cocoa/coffee take over here. The hops are the only thing here that may be overdone/a bit generic. No real off flavors, I can't wait to try this one aged from the bottle (the hops die down and this may become perfect).","cbutova","Jan 05, 2010"
4.53,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Rather than detracting, the carbonation, coupled with the relatively low sweetness, inviting flavors, and pleasant aftertaste, make this a surprisingly drinkable brew.

Lots of dark roasted malts, along with chocolate and hints of coffee. Some sweet dark fruit aromas blend everything together nicely. Taste just as good as it smells. Lots of dark fruit sweetness hit the tongue followed by a delicious roasty finish. Dark chocolate and coffee also making themselves known. Can't really detect any alcohol at all.

Poured straight in to a tulip glass, this beer is pitch black in color, and has a fairly large tan heading. In the nose I get cake batter, extreme chocolate, licorice. In the taste I get some chocolate, a large amount of alcohol, some black currant, cola, molasses, more alcohol, overall very complex. As another reviewer mentioned, alcohol wise it feels much stronger than the 8.50% that is listed. The body on the other hand comes off as much lighter than expected when considering the large flavors going on with it. I am really enjoying taking my time with this one, and sipping it slowly. I have the admit that the first time I tried this brew a couple years ago, I was not the least bit impressed. This time around I am very impressed. It definitely ranks for me amongst the best of the New England Imperial Stouts. One final thought: Do you think Star Wars fanatics are seeking this beer out as a collector's item?

The aroma was a sensual mix of coffe, chocolate, and vanilla. The taste was smooth and silky with a nice sweet balance of roasted malt and hops. It finished smooth and creamy.

I wanted to like it a little more than I did, looking for places I could bump the score up half a point, but there just really wasn't anywhere it was appropriate, and I ended up focusing on what I didn't like as much about this beer more than on what I liked. To be sure, I liked this beer a little more than my score indicated (hence the 0.5 bump in the drinkability), but I feel like: 1) it could be a lot more than it is; and 2) it's just as complex as many beers that it's similar to and reminds me of. That being said, 8.5% abv isn't nearly as fierce as many of those ""similar"" brews, which also enhances the drinkability somewhat. Recommended? Definitely. A solid beer? Most definitely.

A stronger coffee flavor or a bigger hop presence would probably do the trick. It's tough to pick on it too much. It's a damn good beer. I'd love to give some extra points for the kickass label on the bottle, but that doesn't factor into the score. All in all, it's a very good beer that's worth seeking out. Top 100? Nah, not quite.

This beer is quite, quite good and I think lives up to the hype. I'd put it up there near the top for RISs. Pours viscous and absolutely black with a fairly thin head even after a hard pour. What head there is is chocolate brown- one of the darker I've seen. It smells nutty and quite chocolatey, with a powdery dark cocoa aroma as well as some cream, licorice, and even some spicy hops on the finish. Very nice. The taste is beautiful. Extremely smooth, almost syrupy, but only slightly sweet. Wonderful, rich cocoa notes dominate followed by some licorice notes, a touch of coffee and vanilla. Really well balanced, and very nice. A slight dustiness on the finish. Wonderful mouthfeel, that is silky and thick, and creamy but not overly sweet or unctuous. A tiny bit powdery, but to me that just heightens the interest and gives the tongue some purchase. Very, very nice and in fact perhaps a bit better than I expected.","Georgiabeer","May 01, 2009"

4.35,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark black with ruby edges, and a small head of panna cotta, whipped meringue, espresso foam. Aromas are familiar to us all. An imperial stout all the way. Dark roasted malts, various incarnations of dark/dried fruits, heavy wines (durif?), slight booze, and coffee. Taste is awesome with some nice dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and again a sort of heavy red wine vinous character as well. Mouthfeel is thick, but honestly it did not help to cut the slight booziness that I mentioned earlier. This knocks the drinkability down one notch as well. Still, as it stands this is a killer example of a northeast brewed imperial stout.","francisweizen","Nov 04, 2007"
4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"12oz. bottle: This one pours a thick, oily looking very dark (almost black) brown. There was just a touch of a brown head on it, but it didnt last but a few moments. Mainly roasted coffee aroma, with a bit of sweet chocolate also. The aroma is a touch milder than I expected. Maybe a touch of vanilla as it warms. A bit silky on the tongue. The taste is complex. Yes, there is a roasted coffee and hint of chocolate, but there is also a lot more going on in there. Some sweetness, definitely some fruits in the mix, but blending nicely together. A very nice brew.","Boto","Oct 18, 2007"
4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I wasn't disappointed. It is simply and delicious if you just drink. Lots of chocolate goodness. It is complex and delicious if you choose to experience it. Chocolate, coffee, hops, creamy, malt.","LittleBreeze","Oct 12, 2007"
4.7,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a chalice a thick black color, nice carbonation, small brown head, some oil slicks and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, chocolate/toffee, roasted, maybe some vanilla. The taste is fabulous, malty, nice touch of roastyness, and slightly vanilla (sweetness). The finish is slightly dry, the alcohol is hidden very well. Full body. Very Drinkable, this is another awesome RIS people should seek out, Highly Recommended. Glad to have 2 more bottles left.","Wasatch","Oct 11, 2007"

3.54,-15.9,4,5,3,4,2.5,"As for drinkability, I found this beer quite tough. The roasted character and the intense alcohol presence (I would estimate this beer to be around 11% ABV) were both a bit overwhelming (as was the $8 price tag).","Damian","0"

4.38,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Imperial Stout Trooper leaves its awesome bottle in an inky black stream on its way into my glass. This beer is darker than the dark side completely opaque black with an orange brown head, the head is darker than many brown ales, very imposing in the glass. The smell is maybe one of this beers few shortcomings. I'm getting chocolate and black coffee/espresso maybe a bit of vanilla and a good deal of alcohol, there maybe some figs and plums hidden in there as well I would have liked some of the dark fruit to be out front more. The taste is very coffee like a little sweet I'm getting some bitter chocolates and also a little bitter tangyness from hops this subsides as the beer warms. There is a little alcoholic warmth but most of the actual alcohol flavor is nicely masked not much in the way of roasted burnt malt bitterness. At first this was a bit too prickly on the tongue for my taste but as it warms some of the carbonation subsides and leaves a wonderfully smooth beer with just enough bubbles to keep things moving, the finish is a bit warm and dry but very satisfying leading perfectly into the next sip. I was really excited when I was able to find this at the store. It is great to see such amazing beer brewed right here in Connecticut two thumbs way up to NEBC and please brew this one again!","fank2788","Jul 31, 2007"
4.2,-0.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"How can you not love this bottle!! Pours an thick, oily, pitch black with a huge dark brown three finger head that takes a bit to die down, but settles to a nice thin layer. Stickiness is ok, not as good as I thought it should be for the style. Smell is somewhat weak, but what is there includes dark fruits, dark chocolate, and fresh black coffee. Tiny hint of alcohol in the nose. For some reason there seems to be a musty smell too, not very enjoyable. Taste is all about the coffee/espresso. So smooth and creamy on the tongue with a sweet caramel aftertaste. Midway through there was a very surprising hop tingle. I don't know what the abv is, but I can't taste any of it. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with very little carbonation. Great sipping brew, get your hands on it if you get the opportunity.","BeerTruth","Jul 19, 2007"

Aroma is strong on the roastiness, some twangy sour acidity mixes with a hint of booziness, a very subtle and soft powdered chocolate sweetness is also evident. Roast malts also dominate in the taste some soft sweet chocoalte at the front of the tongue blends with a tanginess and bitterness at the back. Finishes with a drying bitterness leaving a roast and smoky aftertaste and a hint of alcohol. Alcohol is fairly balanced and only slightly noticeable. Soft medium to heavy body, slightly oily, is cut by a tingling bitter bite before the dry finish. Very nice roasty and slightly smoky stout.

4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks again to cooperrip for a great DL day and for this in trade. One 12 oz bottle poured it into my brand new Three Floyds nonic glass. Head rose about an inch, now lingers a good two centimeters off the surface. Its milk chocolate colored with hints of gold. The body is pitch black and completely opaque. The aroma is big and grandiose with tones of roasted barley, notes of unmalted barley and oats. I cant really discern a specific hop presence over the intense roasted malt aromas, meaning I can smell a subtle hop presence, but I cant say what for sure. I get the usual (but very welcome) dry roasted coffee with both salty and smoky almost leathery notes, also hints of chocolate and earth. The flavor is equally as robust as the aroma with a malt forward coffee like flavor to start, balanced by a tasty bitterness shaped by that great dry roasted character, reminiscent of dry roast coffee beans cover in bitter dark chocolate. Alcohol is present really only in subtle and welcome alcohol warmth, just right for the style. The mouthfeel is very chewy and thick, yet still extremely quaffable. Although it is almost summer this is still delicious, but I can only imagine how great this would be in the dead of winter. They really should, just man up and make this stuff annually. Very drinkable I wish it wasnt so expensive though. And I just gotta mention the sweet graffic of the storm trooper such a cool name and a cool image. Well worth the experience.","mmcave","Apr 10, 2007"

4.65,10.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"First sip has all the makings of a nice stick stout. The retention of the head has all the makings of a fuzzy soft cappuccino head. Dark fruit notes are very present and fade well into a bitter coffee flavor that's mostly noticed on Sunday mornings upon waking up. A tad smoky with spicy undertones that almost shock the taste buds and finish with an apparent sourness. Interesting balance on this brew, which is almost quite perfect. Sweet caramel balances out the bitterness. Rich and thick with a full bodied mouth feel though extremely smooth. Very nice and extremely drinkable especially with the low abv. Another fantastic offering from nebco, but at that price for a 12oz., I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. Too bad it doesn't come in 22ozer's as I'd reconsider.","bjohnson","Apr 03, 2007"
4.11,-2.4,5,4,4,4.5,4,"taste is dark, sweet, very gonzo-imperial-porter-like in flavor, but a strange aftertaste is detected, possibly recognizable due to the temperature. Continued sipping made this less and less noticeable. Very tasty otherwise, sweet and semi-smooth with some charred taste, very complex...bitter chocolate and an explosion of flavors.. Not overly hoppy, multiple hop types going on here for sure...hard to pinpoint, some citrus and floral notes. Mouthfeel is full but not overkill. Not an alcobomb but very warming, this beer is especially good for style, not my favorite, but glad I snagged some and am hoping to see it offered again. Nicely done NEBco.","Liquids","Apr 02, 2007"

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Heard nothing but good things about this one. Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Poured a deep oily black color. Probably the blackest I've seen. About one inch of dark, coffee brown head rose from the glass. Somewhat thick and tight. Decent head retention. Smell: Tons of chocolate up front, some bitter roasted coffee, and a toasted maltiness, with no alcohol present in the nose. Some toffee/caramel aromas were also noted. Taste: mostly of bitter coffee and sweet chocolate with a touch of vanilla, caramel with a sweet malty backbone. A small hop presence, moderate carbination and a smooth, warm, slightly bitter alcohol finish. Not boozey at all. Mouthfeel is full, thick, and pretty complex. Drinkability is great. Great bottle and worth the money.","jaxon53","Mar 30, 2007"
4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"split a 12 oz bottle with a friend. Looks like any good RIS should. Black,thin tan head that lasts throughout the experience. The smell is great, roasty, toasty coffee and cocoa,maybe a hint of alcohol but not too much. The taste is wonderful, just like it smells. Burnt coffee and chocolate with a nice hoppy bite underneath the huge roasty backbone. The mouthfeel was pleasant. I like my RIS's a bit deeper and denser than this particular impy stout but this beer has a long,lingering aftertaste that does satisfy. I guess the drinkability is good for the style. I could easily drink a couple bottles myself. One of the better imperial stouts on the east coast. cool bottle as well.","magget","Mar 29, 2007"
