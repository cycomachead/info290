I didn't discern the smell of any fruit or other sweet flavor.  Taste emphasizes the coffee but there is a bitter hoppiness.  I've read other reviews but I'm not tasting any dark fruit. You can taste the alcohol but at 9% it's not overwhelming.  Good creamy mouth feel.  Overall, this is a very good imperial stout but I'm missing the dark fruit.","MacMalt","Feb 28, 2015"

4.26,1.2,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours black under a quickly diminishing beige head.  A bubbly ring forms at the edges.  Big roasted malt and dark chocolate aromas meet some hops and malted milk balls.  Dark malty flavors of molasses, black malt char, dark fruits, vanilla, and a little coffee on the finish.  Hoppier than most, but still secondary to the malts. Perhaps a bit less than full bodied, chewy, and smooth. A warming sensation grows deep in the throat, but things stay drinkable. Still a classic RIS - able to stand on its own without the addition of adjuncts or barrel aging.","wedge","Feb 17, 2015"

Any more hops and it would break into black IPA territory, any more malt and it would be lost among the mediocre stouts. As it is, it's tasty and distinguished.

4.27,1.4,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"BBD 5/13/15.  Pours black as a starless night.  Above normal head volume, excellent lacing and retention.  Nice complex nose of semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, roast notes, hints of vanilla and dark fruit (plum, date) in the background.  Almost full bodied with a nice creamy texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, very complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a wave of flavor that slowly separates into sweet dark chocolate over molasses, then flows into the subtle vanilla and dark fruit notes. The middle is a strong roast flavor over a roast and hop bitterness that puckers the tongue a bit over a caramel sweetness.  The finish is a slow fade of caramel/molasses sweetness over a lingering bitterness with just a hint of alcohol.   This one is an excellent example of a roast forward stout that is masterfully complex and reasonably balanced with sweetness.","tillmac62","Jan 14, 2015"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a very dark black, with brown hints around the edges as you move it under light. A light tan head caps it, lasting a good way into the beer and leaving nice soapy lacing. The aroma is a blend of deep roasted malts and dark fruits, (raisins, figs) and the taste follows closely along. It is much sweeter than I would have expected, but that is not a bad thing. The body is a little lighter in weight (not as slick or heavy) but still quite good.","delta490","Jan 11, 2015"

More complexity opens up as this warms. Great smooth, thick body and mouthfeel which falls short of oily. Retains minimal head, appearance similar to a cola. Excellent chocolate and hint of hop notes come through here. For the high ABV this is devastatingly drinkable, much like the other beers in GLBC’s stable. Outstanding.","Barnoloid","Jan 04, 2015"

It drinks more like a regular stout in mouthfeel and aroma. In fact, i find this strikingly similar to Deschutes Obsidian. It has a very traditional stout taste without any bells and whistles we often see in Russians nowadays. Other than that i really cant say anything bad about it. If this was labeled a regular stout id give it 4.5+ but as a RIS i give it a 4-4.25. Its a damn tasty beer regardless. Cant knock GL for playing it safe with this one","Bone53","Dec 29, 2014"

It was slightly tangy, with an unpleasant berryish flavor. I also got a tiny bit of soy sauce and some char. The beer did improve as it warmed up though, which is now making me question myself. The bottle was best by 4-15, I think? Not sure how far out GLBC dates bottles of Blackout, but I'm willing to bet this beer was mishandled at some point. GLBC has only been in our distro for a month. I'm being kind with this rating because I have a hard time believing this is what it's supposed to taste like. I'll have to try a different batch or a draft version to give this beer another shot.","JMUbrewz","Dec 02, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

I did not smell or taste the alcohol but I felt it. Texture is rather creamy. I had this in a bottle a year ago and thought it was solid but somewhat over-roasted. No sign of that here.

Pours dark brown to black with some light shining through the pour--a bit more than the BA version--and settles black in the glass with a half finger khaki colored head. Aromas of milk and dark chocolate, some roast, and more chocolate. Flavor is big roastiness with a nice balance of chocolate that is not too sweet. Lingering roast on the palate and a nice bitterness to finish. Velvety mouthfeel that is medium plus and super drinkable for the style. A really nice brew as usual from GL.

Its chewy and HUGE~ Taste is Chocolate, Coffee, Molasses, an army of malt, some dark bread, Brown Sugar, Licorice, Dark Fruit, Toast, Charcoal, Cookies and Cream and espresso~ Nice and silky smooth, however a huge alcohol burn lingers on the after taste, a bit too much for a 9%, I'm from Cleveland...

4.05,-3.8,4,4,4.25,3.5,4,"The beer pours a deep dark brown, and sits in the glass as midnight black. It forms a head of tan colored bubbles atop the beer, but swiftly whittles that away to a scrim. In body, the beer is slightly viscous and nearly perfectly opaque, which just hints of ruby light escaping through the edges of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of medium roast coffee, with baker’s chocolate and dark fruit notes dancing in and out of the nostrils. It smells almost like a blend of hot cocoa and coffee. Touches of creamy milk even show themselves to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly sweet and fruity in its beginnings, but dries out perfectly with bitter roast and a touch of herbal hops in the finish. Slightly tart acidity also shows its face at the beginning of the sip, but is bulled away by the rich roasted bitters. In flavor, the beer begins as plum juice, milk chocolate, and a touch of raisins. This moves forward into rich dark roast coffee notes and then char and a light bite of herbal hops on the finish. The dark fruit returns on the finish and aftertaste, and sits nicely on the palate for a while. In the mouth, the beer feels just below full in body, with a smoothness that borders on being thin given the beer’s alcohol percentage and style. The mouth is left coffee-bitter but with a lot of acid-canceling saliva swimming in the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice imperial stout. In terms of the Russian Imperial Stout, it falls a little flat for what I look for in the style, but it has some awesome imperial stout characters that work perfectly. I want more roast and charred malt flavors in this beer in order to see it as an RIS, but its deeply fruity and tart malt character at the beginning was really quite intriguing and made the beer interesting and complex to sip. The mouthfeel was a bit thin overall for what I wanted for the style, but that does make the beer easy to sip. This is a really nice imperial stout with some funky character. Not my favorite in the style, but a nice interpretation.","Maxwell","Jan 06, 2014"

3.97,-5.7,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,"The Blackout Stout is another solid offering from Great Lakes. The beer pours a solid opaque black with off white head that is leaving a lacing. The scent carries a roast and slight helpings of coffee, anise and chocolate. The taste has a nice balance of roast, coffee, toffee and peat. The mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid stout and perfect for those winter nights.","WoodBrew","Jan 05, 2014"

It's not as bitter as Plead the 5th, nor is it as hoppy as Obsidian Stout or Storm King, nor is it as rich as Founders' Imperial Stout, nor is it as complex as Darkness or Marshal Zhukov- but it's excellent and incorporates all the characteristics I have really come to enjoy from each of these other Russian Imperial Stouts. I highly recommend getting one four-pack of this beer for every winter.","Stevedore","Jan 03, 2014"

I actually see time hurting this a bit more than benefiting. that and anytime a big brew has a enjoy by date on it that appears to be only about 6 months from its bottled on date, I would say drink it. they know what they are doing.","Jimmys","Dec 12, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, rich, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it and I think it's very drinkable for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything wrong or out of place with this beer. I would buy this beer again, I'm pretty sure I'll pick up another bottle and I might get one to put in the cellar, but I'm not sure this one will benefit much from aging since it's pretty smooth and tasty right now. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Russian Imperial Stouts. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was a straight up good RIS and it's up there as one of the better beers I've had from Great Lakes Brewing Company, it was smooth and it did a good job at holding my attention.

Smells of milk chocolate, raisin, roasted coffee, dark bready malts, soy sauce, some pine. Taste starts with raisin, some dark chocolate, coffee. Then get more raisin, as well as plum, some pine, some breadiness. Then the finish includes, a little pine or grapefruit, roasted malt, some coffee, milk chocolate, little heat, some carmel, little soy sauce, maybe some licorice but I could just be imagining that. Pretty complex with a full body and a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation, but too much in my opinion. This is a very solid imperial stout that is on the verge of world class.","brewskis","Mar 23, 2013"

The head fades to a nice layer rather quickly and leaves some lacing on the side of the glass. I wasn't in love with the smell of this beer. I'm getting some sweet malt and dark fruit, but there is a slightly off note that I'm having trouble describing. Fortunately, the note that I didn't like in the smell didn't show up in the taste. While this was a very roasty beer, I thought the roast was quite smooth. I'm also getting dark chocolate and some dark fruit. The finish is sweet and roasty. The alcohol is quite well hidden. I'd have another bottle in the future.","oline73","Mar 09, 2013"

The aroma is largely a dark, sweet combination of caramel and molasses sweetness, with some bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is a bit more complex, with characteristics of roasted, almost smoky malts, brown sugar, and some peppery, herbal hops, but there is also some lingering bitterness that seems almost metallic, and a noticeable hit of alcohol. The fine carbonation does a nice job of not masking this varied flavor profile, and the body isn't too heavy. Overall, this beer has a lot of what you'd expect from a solid imperial stout, but it doesn't have anything extra to make it exceptional.","devilben02","Jan 07, 2013"

4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Beer pours black with a big fluffy tan head - a much bigger head than your average imperial stout. Smell is fairly subdued, but has a combination of roast and caramel malts, chocolate, oats and a little sweet. The roast doesn't overwhelm in the nose and instead plays a complementary role with the other things going on here. The flavor here is REALLY nice. It's not your average hit-you-over-the-head big roasty stout and instead does something a little different. It's a little bit sweet, smooth and chocolate-y up front, but brings a nice amount of roast in the finish to balance it out. It's incredibly easy-drinking for such a big stout. Mouthfeel isn't super thick for a big stout, instead it's more medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of my favorite non-BA imperial stouts because it's not the same as all of the other big ones out there. It actually reminds me a lot of Hill Farmstead Everett, a porter, more than any other big stout I've had.","starrdogg","Dec 14, 2012"

The smell and taste are very similar between those two beers for me. Coffee on the nose, and I get more coffee and chocolate in the taste. Black in color that pours a dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Has a medium body and I get some bitterness about this which seems to come from cocoa. My general opinion is that this is okay. I was expecting more heaviness, and I don't think the taste separates itself enough from Edmund Fitzgerald for me to really care much for it.

It is a decent brew, and priced reasonably, albeit in the middle of the pack. This would be a good ""beginners"" imperial stout...on the thin side, and not overwhelming.

It tastes of cane sugar, molasses, faint alcohol, caramel, and roasted malt. Not much else, but well balanced with the flavors that are present. Plenty of sugar, if that’s what you seek.

At 9% alcohol is fairly well concealed. It still ends up being a little boozy as expected, but its balance once again keeps everything in check. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.

Smell is where I was let down. It was really lacking a particular scent. It almost reminds me of a belgian dark ale yeast scent. There are also minimal traces of smoke. The taste is what redeemed the lack of scent for me. I'm getting nice toasted flavors, smoked malt, roasted barley, coffee, and chocolate. It's a really nice combo.

I have had the Barrel aged version of this on tap and that is an uber powerful beer. This version from the bottle is plenty all on it's own, a substantial heavyweight and unlike some American made Imperial Stouts that I have had, the sweetness is held back and not allowed to romp over the flavor profile.

The only thing holding this back from a really solid A or A+ is the Northern Brewer hops (which definitely do their job of hiding the ABV, by the way).

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had a feeling this was going to be good as I've had the barrel aged version quite a few times now and had never had the base beer (funny how that works out huh?).

This is almost the definition of a ""chewy"" beer to me, at the right temperature, it literally just takes over my mouth with a chewy texture.

This beer is heavy! It tastes like my French roast coffee every morning. If only I could switch them out. It's superb. Mad props to Matt for the growler.

Aroma is coffee and chocolate with slight citrusy hops in the background. The taste is huge. Chocolate is dominant than coffee. There is some slight licorice in the background and citrusy hop flavor. No noticeable molasses or dark fruit. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. I can't believe this is a 9% abv beer. Drinkability is also very good for a 9% beer. Carbonation is appropriate and the mouthfeel is luxuriously rich.

The vanilla comes through as it warms. This beer should definitely not be served too cold. It really improved and became more complex as it warmed. This is one of the smoothest RIS's I've ever had.

Doesn't exhibit a ton of nuance, in that there aren't a lot of surprises here, and, to be frank, it packs a hammer punch in terms of chocolate and coffee.

The nose is of deep chocolate, molasses, vodka (the hell?), dark malts, a hint of coffee, and some black cherries waaaay in the back. The taste is somewhat similar, with notes of dark oats, figs, raisins, bitter chocolate, and an alcholic burn thrown in for good pyromaniacal measure. The body is a heavy medium, with low carbonation and a surprisingly watery feel. In fact, it's this thinness that knocks it down a peg for me. Just too much water, y'know? Ask the gilled Kevin Costner...he'll set ya straight. Overall, a pretty solid stout, but I just don't feel it's all that excellent, nor does it live up to its hype.

3.85,-8.6,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a jet-black into my glass with some initial creamy lacing that ceases to reside for long. I like that it stays pretty true to its name. Right off the nose, I get some vanilla, coffee, molasses, nutmeg, and dried cherries clouded by a certain smokeyness to this brew; it's definitely pleasing I think. As with most Imperial Stouts by the nature of their complexity, I believe this beer opens up a bit with time in your glass. Immediately upon my first sip, I get expresso beans, dark chocolate, sugar, and some burnt malts. Sometimes the high volume of the 'burnt flavor' will overpower the beer, and I think this may be partly true on this one. I think the roasty malts take away a little from what the taste could be, but not that much. There is very little carbonation and hoppyness isn't even a factor. Ok, so a little alcohol does come through on the finish, but that's to be expected with beers with ABVs like this. The drinkability for this one is good, but not great. It's such a heavy beer and all the malts are a little overwhelming. Having said that, it would make a great winter-warmer all the same. Overall, it's a really solid beer that falls a little short of its expectations.","Nightwielder","Jun 08, 2010"

The aromas are coffee, milk and dark chocolate, and very darkly toasted malt. On the palate, the coffee and chocolate come through nicely, but there is definitely big alcohol. The beer is big bodied with a very long semi-sweet finish. Overall, this is exactly what I look for in a big stout.","wedgie9","May 11, 2010"

Bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee are the first things the nose picks up. In the background are hints of dark fruits and alcohol. Really earthy taste with a some smokiness. For me, the coffee/espresso taste is stronger than the smell. The bitter chocolate is secondary, but really comes on in the finish. It's almost a reversal from the smell. You can feel the warming alcohol more than taste it. It's got a very rich and creamy feel.","alkemy","Apr 29, 2010"

Light hints of dark chocolate, and mild hop bitterness, though not nearly as much as in Storm King or Black Sun Stout. MF is creamy and clean, a bit dry actually.

There is a nice ring and cloud atop the beer as I drink it and the head has nice retention and looks. Smells of roast malt, some caramel/sugars, a tiny pinch of alcohol, some cocoa and coffee. Needs a bit more strength but a good balance indeed. Much of the same in the taste. Heavy roast malts, cocoa a hint of alcohol, some sweets and a good earthy hop backbone to balance the flavor. Mouthfeel is very nice. An awesomely creamy and heavy body with great warming. A bit of oily feeling to it and a nice low amount of carbonation make for a perfect RIS mouthfeel. The tongue is left with a coat of roast malt. Very sessionable for a 9% RIS, ABV present but in a good way. The taste and price were good. A nice straight up RIS.","cbutova","Mar 21, 2010"

It tasted like molasses and honey wheat and roasted coffee, with some bitter chocolate and raisin. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a smooth bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a huge improvement over the fresh bottle. My what five years have done! It had a great scent and taste that were super smooth and rich. It was somewhere between a sweet stout and a very malty barleywine, and it worked. The body was a bit lacking, but this was otherwise a great beer.

Very smooth, no hint of the booziness. Not very hoppy for a RIS. May be a bit thin in the mouth for a big stout though, the initial heft doesn't really stick on the palate. Still, a good balance between creamy and slick, and if we could get this here, would be another great choice for sessionable imperial stout.","damienblack","Aug 02, 2009"

Aroma is rich and fills the nose with smoke, fine coffee, unsweetened chocolate and molasses. Flavor does not disappoint - rich and lip-smacking, it is like fine roast coffee mixed with unsweet chocolate, a hint of charcoal and a touch of molasses.

The hopping definetly mellowed with age. But the hops still impart an overall earthy falvor to thsi very dark and complex malt bomb. The coffee and chocolate are smooth and roasty bitter to almost brunt. Then theres this vanilla wood, peet, whiskey barrel flavor and soothing alcoholic heat to the finish. This beer is awesome.

4.83,14.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"My first experience with this particular seasonal brew came at last years Beerfest, (September 2008) in Rochester NY. Word was that this dark stout was only available for a very short period of time. A friend and fellow beer enthusiast and I, parked ourselves right in front of the Great Lakes podium and began inflating our pourers heads while scoring full glasses of the delicious brew. We found out that Great Lakes at that time was not being distributed in the Rochester market but, by chance, Great Lakes would soon be flooding the shelves of local grocers Wegmans and other local distribution centers. To our dismay, we found that Great Lakes offered a variety of great tasting ales, and stouts but the coveted Blackout stout was actually a seasonal brew saved over from the past spring! We tried to get a lead on where it was hidden finally contacting the brewery itself. Our efforts were in vein. There simply was none to be had. We gave up. I was at a local Bar/Restaurant a couple of weeks ago when in pure amazement saw Blackout Stout on the menu! A few inquires to the manager and I was informed that a small shipment made its way in from Cleveland and that, what was available to the public, was being rationed out at our local ""Beers of the World"" store. 1 phone call later I was informed by the clerk that 6 cases remained. I immediately finished my drink and headed over to purchase every last bottle. 6 cases and almost $400 dollars later, I had every drop in Rochester in my possession! I made a few calls to a few good friends and parted with a couple of the cases. This is the stuff dreams are made of! Dark,full flavor, slight bitter bite, with hints of chocolate, and nutty. Great served slightly below room temp. and paired well with fruits, chocolates, and sweet desserts. This is a sipping beer meant to be drank from a goblet. At 9% ABV it is nearly perfect. I don't bother to break this stuff out for the general house guests as few have the pallet to appreciate the quality and character of this fine, fine brew.","croc","Jun 02, 2009"

Very heavy mouthfeel and a little boozy, but a great sipper. I would definitely have this on tap again, but no more than one or two, that abv can sneak up on you.","flexinwext","Apr 07, 2009"
4.38,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours out a deep black with about two fingers of off white, creamy head. Excellent lacing and head retention. Smells are of dark sugars, roasted coffee, a slight hop smell and a bit of alcohol. Taste is roasted coffee mixed with a sweet and sugary flavor. A small amount of hop bitterness is detected, although it finishes off with the roasted flavor and a bit of alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel is heavy, but a bit thin compared to some of the other RIS's I've had lately. Of the RIS's I've had so far though, this one is easily the best.","kbeals","Apr 05, 2009"

Taste was extremely alcoholic at first with just a bit of burnt coffee and semi-sweet chocolate BUT let this one warm up a bit. The flavor heavily develops as it warms and the heavy alcohol flavor almost completely dissipates and you are left with some more desirable caramelized burnt coffee flavors which makes this beer very easy to drink.","Ohiovania","Apr 01, 2009"

There is so much I love about this brew but the bitter combination of burnt malt and alcohol combined with a cloying type licorice makes it harder to drink than it needs to be. I'd be happier if it were a smoother drink but that's the beauty of beer - that's just my taste! Try it and enjoy it. I will certainly enjoy the 2 I have left and look forward to it next year.","sgoodship","Mar 29, 2009"

The taste is of everything I listed in the smell. Taste and smell are identical. Very tasty. You can also taste the alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is of light/medium body. It's smoother than I expected. I could drink two of these in a row before probably getting a little tired of the taste, and also having to move on soon from the 9% ABV. This is another one of Great Lakes fantastic brews.","brianlg","Mar 29, 2009"

There's a very nice chocolate aroma, almost like tootsie rolls, the slightest hint of coffee, and a nice roasted malt character. Taste is all chocolate. There must been a copious amount of chocolate malt that went into this brew. There's also a nice bit caramel flavor a warming booziness. This is a very tasty brew and probably has more chocolate flavor out of any non-chocolate stout beer I've had. Body is slightly lacking for the style, in my opinion, but it's still medium-full. Nice brew and would love to try the barrel aged version.","KeefD","Mar 24, 2009"

3.57,-15.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is also very clean. Very little coming from the alcohol. A very calming imperial stout if you will. Almost like a milk imperial stout. If I had to drink a strong stout during the summer, this would be it. What it lacks in pure outrageous flavor, which is common among most stouts of this type, it makes up for in drinkability and overall niceness. This is turning out to be a weird review since it's late and I'm getting tired. Nonetheless, this is the first and last beer I will ever deem 'nice.' Try it for yourself and see.","wiseguy142","Mar 03, 2009"

Judging by the quality of Blackout Stout, I'm sad that I didn't pick up the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter while I was at it. I can't get this beer in the Kansas City area, which saddens me. This is a beer comparable in flavor to that old favorite, Old Rasputin -- only Blackout Stout is better. This is a triumph; I look forward to the day that I can drink this again.

They just dropped us all off at the gate at 8 pm without telling us why, and left us to our own devices.

The flavor profile follows the nice very nicely with upfront flavors of dark roasted grain, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, and anise. There is a hint of sweetness and smoke lingering on the back of the palate as well. I don't get any alchohol burn either from the 9%. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, but it still manages to render itself very smooth.

Head rises nice and even like a low rumbling freight train as with all stouts, levels off about 1/2 inch then dissipates leaving a nice creamy top layer. The coffee and toffee taste hits first then immediately followed by bitter dark chocolate, it's truly delicious! Although the high Abv is readily present, it's not overwhelming. The texture is perfect, silky smooth just like a real Stout should be.

Poured one shade shy of black; no light penetration on this one. Half-inch tan colored head lost cohesion and broke down into a skim of foam and ringlets leaving behind only specks of lacing as the brew receded. Nose suggests dark fruit and chocolate on a malt backbone. Taste reveals espresso and some chocolate flavors, followed by a charred finish; dark fruit is nowhere to be found. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied without being at all viscous with a bit of carbonation burn concentrated at the front of the tongue. Good drinkability. Very flavorful without being cloyingly sweet. Alcohol is well hidden for a 9% abv. A little lighter-bodied RIS puts this on the fringes of the style, but a very nice offering nonetheless.","Jwale73","Aug 19, 2008"

4.58,8.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Seasonal brew from Great Lakes, I was looking forward to it's release and grabbed a four pack soon after they hit the shelves. Great Lakes makes some very nice beers including this Imperial Stout. The beer is dark black once poured into my glass a thick head is formed. The head does become much thinner, but it sticks around for the duration of the brew which is highly unusual for a strong imperial stout, a real nice touch. There is moderate lacing. The aroma is a usual mix of roasted malts with touches of coffee and hops, but then the chocolate malts come alive and seem to dominate the thick aroma. Aside from the abundance of chocolate malts the alcohol can actually be detected with the nose, it seems to let you know that this beer needs to be enjoyed slowly. The mouthfeel is the one aspect where this beer falls short of greatness. There is an immediately recognized thinness to the beer especially thin for an imperial stout. The finish is satisfying and relatively smooth. Great taste with this one. All of the dark roasted malts create a nice flavor that is accented with a generous amount of hops that lead right into a well deserved bitter aftertaste. The chocolate malts also stand out in the overall flavor, but the coffee is more abundant than originally detected with the aroma. For an Imperial Stout Great Lakes has created a wonderful example, not the best around but surely worth trying. 5/12/06...Enjoyed the other two tonight mixed in with some other cellared Impy Stouts. Wow I upped my ratings in a couple categories, and for good reason. This is the most Aggressive Stout I have had, Absolutely killer.","kinger","Jul 31, 2008"

As I taste the beer, I am moved by the biting alcohol, the layers of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate, echos reminiscent of Kahlua, and hot vanilla. Roasted flavors are powdery on the palate and the hops are kept in check. The beer gives my tongue a prickly feel. Delicious.","DoubleJ","Jul 23, 2008"

The beer color was brunette/near black. The aroma had a hint of coffee, and I do not like bean juice. The taste had a hint of coffee, so it was not to my particular fancy...however, the taste was so slight that I could drink the whole 12 oz. myself without concern. The feel of the beer after swallow was a hallo of tingling about the other rim of my tongue with the hint of coffee hitting the tip.

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Blackout pours a deep mahogany brown with a big tan head. Nothing is visible through this guy when held to the light, bright brown highlights shine through the bottom of the glass. The beer smells of semi-sweet roasted/burnt malts with a really balancing fruity note. The stout is big and burnt, fully body of malts, caramel, molasses, hints of licorice, toffee, coffee, and dark chocolate. A warming alcohol presence and hop bitterness linger through out. Toasty malts and bitterness stay with you for a long finish. Blackout is a heavy, coating, lingering stout meant for the serious beer drinker. I sampled this one with my buddies who aren't stout fans. Safe to say this one was not the favorite of the night...

The aroma is pretty much dominated by roasted barley...very nice for an imperial stout. The taste also rushes forth with roasted barley and a bit of sweet chocolate. The sweetness never really takes off though because the hops provide enough bitterness to balanced it out and bite your tongue. The body is rather medium, not quite full bodied, and it is a bit drying. The carbonation is a bit lively as well. Overall, a very tasty and drinkable RIS.

The head was just a thin layer of beige that dissipated into nothingness within a few seconds. No retention whatsoever. The aroma isn't as big as may RIS's. Definite notes of roasted malts, chocolate and what reminds me of sour pie cherries. Taste is pretty straight forward also. It's really big up front with a huge roasted grain flavor that settles on the back of your tongue and lingers for a while. Then comes the bitter chocolate, black licorice and sour cherries. This has a really good flavor but nothing is over whelming like with many RIS's. The alcohol is very mellow only coming out in the very end of the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking. I enjoy big, chewy, beers. All in all this is a highly drinkable RIS.

Lingering dark bitterness hangs on at the end. It's really quite good. It has a nice consistency, too - not syrupy thick, but it has some chewy moments in the mouth.

Hints of coffee and espresso as well, can't detect any alcohol in the nose at all. Taste, wow...very balanced. Starts off with roasted malt then the coffee flavor dominates the tongue. Towards the end, hops emerge and balance out this one very well. This might be my favorite tasting Imperial Stouts by far. So smooth for 9% abv.

The smell was better than the taste in my opinion, but still had a great flavor to it. Mildly carbonated with plenty of warming alcohol. Had a somewhat thick and full mouthfeel to it. Seemed pretty well balanced. Very drinkable. A pretty solid beer in my book,","jaxon53","Jun 09, 2007"

Aroma of chocolate and coffee malt is well balance with a medium hoppy finish. Taste is really well balance between chocolate malt, some dry roasted malt and a medium bitter finish.

I am impressed with the balance of taste and smell with the ABV, you get the warming sensation of a high alcohol beer without the overpowering alcohol taste that drowns out the subtle flavors that this beer delivers. The mouthfeel is good, it has a small hoppy bite at the beginning that adds another layer to this great brew. This one is easy to drink and is an overall great RIS and a great beer.

Taste is rich, slightly sweet with creamy chocolate, some smooth tasting roasted grains, vanilla, and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is incrdibly smooth and creamy, like a milkshake- phenomenal!

Just delicious. Rich, sweet and roasty malt flavors swell mid-palate before dark/baking chocolate bitterness joins in and a renewed, strong coffee flavor develops. This roasted bitterness dries the finish out a little and complements the earlier sweet malt nicely. Hints of flint and smoke in there as well. Long, slightly warming finish, though the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Full-bodied with a chewy feel. Very well made and extremely drinkable.","alexgash","Apr 03, 2007"

I thought i might see in town one day since great lakes is now back in south bend, but i didnt expect it so soon. Pours black through and through so that's as advertised. Little khaki head hangs out for a while before just making a small ring. Very heavy burnt coffee odor. Smells like a malty campfire. Taste is very flavorful, in that its bold and the taste is very forward. burnt tasting and somewhat hoppy cocoa beans and coffee grounds. almost singular in its flavor and im a bit diappointed because i expected more or a fruity flavor. a bit too assertive with the char flavors and not enough fruity chocolates. Its a big think monster of a beer though and i think maybe i just caught it too early. I'll sit on the other 3 bottles for a while and see how they develop.","aforbes10","Mar 09, 2007"

4.79,13.8,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"obviously, it's black. the head is a mixture of tan and white -- they swirl around one another, never mixing, and eventually dissipate, leaving a white ring around the top of the liquid. at the peak of the liquid, a bit of purple/brown can be seen as the light comes through. in the nose, it's a sinus clearer. sniff it when you have a head cold. chocolate, charcoal, menthol, hops... first impression of the taste is tobacco. lots of tobacco. close behind is brownies, maybe with pot baked in. also present are walnuts, charcoal, menthol, bitter hops, citric hops. primarily though, the taste seems to be tobacco, mint, and chocolate. it's wonderful and bold. nowhere near as all-inclusive as others in the style, and it's for the better because of it. amazingly smooth in the mouth -- just the right consistency to support the flavor profile. slightly warming, but the beer never betrays its 9% abv.","schusterbauer","Mar 08, 2007"

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Purchased a four pack excitedly from Sams, but its readily available else where now, chilled it and poured into nonic. Off white/ light kaki head developed with shades of gray, decent retention and sticky melted marsh mellow lacing. The body is a highly reflective mahogany color, oily and completely opaque. Smells is robust, slightly salty, smoky, with lovely roasted barley notes. Both toasted and chard malts are apparent in the nose, which round out subtle hints of chocolate and caramel with notes of wonderful dry roast coffee. Hops on this are faint (more so than some other RIS), but provide just enough back up to showcase the malt quite pleasantly. The flavor is excellent big, rich and intense, yet immediately accessible and tasty as hell. Rich and sumptuous, round bitter sweet, smoked dark chocolate with hints of toffee and dry roasted coffee plus a bit of sugar for ballast. Bitterness is minimal, just enough to balance the sweet richness and add color to the bitter-sweet character. The mouthfeel is creamy surrounded by a slightly oily sensation and then a nice dry roasted coffee finish. I have to comment on this brews ability to utilize quite surly RIS characteristics so tactfully, not cloying in the least. This is extremely drinkable; I could have one for every meal and then some especially breakfast. Despite the ABV this is totally a seasonable beer, just be careful. I am so happy to have had this and will be buying in bulk in the future.","mmcave","Mar 05, 2007"

It smells mostly like roasted malt and coffee, with some molasses and chocolate too. It tastes pretty much the same way to me, but with some dark fruit in the taste. There's more bitterness than sweetness in the taste. There's also a hoppy bitter aftertaste and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and oily, but a bit carbonated at the same time. Drinkability is pretty good considering the 9% ABV. The alcohol is noticable, but not overwhelming at all. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent beer.","bluejacket74","Mar 02, 2007"

Very complex with a slightly sweet bitter dark chocolate, expresso coffee and a small undertone of vanilla to begin. Somewhere in the middle I got a little of molasses and licorice. The light hoppy flavor shine through the end that is complimented with a slight bit of alcohol to balance out the brew. The beer is very smooth, full body, oily and creamy and softly carbonated to make it a very enjoyable session. You can drink this all night, but watch out it packs 9% abv and it will creep up on you.

Undertones of roasted chocolate malts. Can tell this will be sweet with a very hoppy finish. Very complex taste. Starts sweet then overcome with hops, malty but really subdued by the hops, an almost grapefruit hop taste with a pine tasting finish. Perfect carbonation on this one. I think if they had allowed for more carbonation the higher alcohol taste would linger and ruin the taste, so not having such a large head may hurt the appearance of the beer but definetely works in its favor for the taste.

None of these jump out at you. It's a nice flow from one to another. My only complaint here is that the mouthfeel is a little thinner than I like out of my stouts. But thats splitting hairs, this is a terrific stout. This offering doesn't leave you with the mouth coating coffee aftertaste as well. Which makes this a highly sessionable offering. A very solid offering from a very solid brewery. A must try, even for non-stout fans.","FtownThrowDown","Oct 24, 2006"

It was a joy from the first look to the last drop, and the only thing I ever questioned was how fleeting some of the qualities seemed, but that is so small a knock as to be inconsequential. The ABV is a large intoxicating presence, and not to be ignored, though the warming way it has about it is more charming than daunting.

Beer displays pretty good lacing as well. Aroma has notes of dark fruit, tobacco, and a hint of espresso. Perhaps just a hint of hop spiciness as well. Flavor has a lot of dark chocolate and espresso in it; I mean a LOT. Very dry, almost like eating cocoa powder. Then it sweetness just a bit carried by a wisp of alcohol. A slight amount of bitterness balances out the package. Really cant believe how neutral the finish is. Most RIS will tend to have a strong, thick, lingering finish. This just leaves you with a bit of double-strength mocha. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected. The amount of dark roast flavors begs for a bit of thick malt to balance things out, but it never happens. Great finish for a dry stout, not sure about an Imperial stout. Not really bad, but typically the RIS reminds you of it's power and size. This one's more strong and wiry than a big brute. Drinkability is decent, but it gets a little tiring after a while.

Smells of highly roasted almost burnt malt mixed with chocolate, coffee and dried dark fruits. Tastes are similar with coffee being the main flavor. Alcohol comes flying through and is warming all the way down. Hops are a bit subtle but there is a nice roasted bitterness that lingers in the mouth. This stuff screams for some chocolate cake. It is smooth and creamy an although tasty it is a bit heavy to be super drinkable, but do not pass this beer by if you see it. Just drink it slowly and enjoy.","sabrills70","Jul 22, 2006"

The taste follows up nicely with a dry espresso taste and dark chocolate (not creamy like milk chocolate, more like a Hersheys Special Dark mini bar). There is a definite dryness to this that leaves your mouth with a taste that lingers only for a short while. On the exhale, I get a twinge of the 9% alcohol. The body of this beer is just too thin for me, and that is where this brew falls up a hair short. I feel a Russian Imperial Stout should coat your mouth and hang around for a while after swallowing.

Blackout Stout began as a dry hoppiness sweeps the tongue, then a flash of black licorice and dark, dark chocolate tones. Roasted malts and a background alcohol flavor round out this stout.

Brief bitter pine-sap hops at the beginning. Dark cherry appears in the middle, right after a slight touch of cabernet bite. The finish is all dark roasted malts, like the tastiest burnt toast and dark topsoil sandwich. The 9% alcohol is apparent but expertly melded with the density of the overall flavor. Medium body and a slick, chewy mouthfeel. I would love to have this available where I live, but its rarity for me makes it that much more special. Stunning RIS.","orfeu","Jun 16, 2006"

The finish has a certain roasted note that picks up an acidity similar to that in an espresso. This beer has quite a burnt grain character to it as well; adds a certain dryness to this beer that in combination with the acidity helps to balance the sweet notes. There is a nice compound bitterness here as well, a combination of both the roast grain bill and a solid hop level.

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Extremely solid stout. Huge roasted malt character and malt sweetness. Lots of complexity with unusual balcance. Light lactose additions help to mellow the rough 'stout-like' edges without contributing sourness. Oatmeal like smoothness does the same. Higher than normal carbonation combined with lightly fusal alcohols causes a scrubbing of the throat on the way down. This the only flaw.

3.62,-14,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"""Blackout"" pour. Head is very small and light brown, retains poorly. Sweet cream, black coffee and hazelnut in the nose. Alcohol is masked well initially, but a slow burn begins to emerge in the aftertaste as it warms and eventually makes itself very well known in the flavor. Mouthfeel shows just a touch of carbonation, making this nicely smooth. Chocolate malts, vanilla and a very roasty bitterness make this nicely complex, though I will say that this could be a bit young and might possibly benefit from a few months in the cellar to allow the flavors to meld together and for the alcohol to cool a bit. Nonetheless, a solid Imperial that at this young age would best be paired with food rather than on its own, to compliment and bring out its rich, roasty flavors. (Goes to the kitchen to find chocolate...or a roast duck)","IrishRedRock","Nov 07, 2005"
4,-5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Almost black, diminishing light brown head. Well roasted grains hit the nose, closing on coffee and having that oatmeal touch (whether they use any or not) that I love in big stouts, flour-like with strong biscuity aspects. Very cookieish palate, feels like pastries. Well rounded edges, strong dark fruit components (plums, blackberries..). Anise suggestions come in right before the chocolate ice cream light lactic aspect that miraculously fades away completely to leave way to the roastiness. Very subtle for an impy, yet multi-faceted and admirable imo. Mellow alcohol feels procures a gently fruit liqueur or grand marnier note. One of the best tasting imperials Ive had I would say, but the other aspects were not as admirable. Carbonation for one may be a bit too expressive rather than letting the flavours speak for themselves, it would fit on a smaller stout, here it seems to reduce a bit the punch of this medium body.","Rastacouere","Nov 07, 2005"

Has a lot going on in the nose: coffee, dark fruits, smoked wood and alcohol fumes. One of the most complex beers I've ever tasted: bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee grounds, smoked beef jerky, spicey dark fruit remeniscent of a belgian strong dark and a no-nonsense alcohol kick in the face. This stout means business. Mouthfeel is thick as oil but well carbonated and goes down smooth.

Mild alcohol notes mix with a bit of roastiness as it warms. Some vinous qualities are there. Bitter roasty finish, definitely one of the best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had.

It tastes a little of prunes and molasses, like the Baltic porters I experimented with the other day, but not nearly as offensive. Doesn't really live up to the nose until the end, with a bitter, coffee, toasty finish. I wish it was a little more bitter. Mouthfeel is outstanding, very smooth; this beer does an excellent job of disguising its 9% ABV. I would, however, prefered a little more bitterness.

When swirled, some residue is left on the glass like a strong whiskey. The aroma was filled with roasted malt, with bitter chocolate, alcohol, and plenty of coffee. A slight smokiness is also present, adding some complexity to the nose. Taste begins very smoothly with lots of malt - big and creamy. Some bitter coffee and burnt malt flavors are apparent as well. Some caramel and chocolate are floating around in there too. Slightly piney but definitely citrous hops make a short-lived appearance near the end before being overthrown by that great roasted aftertaste. A slight alcohol presence adds some warmth to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is by no means thin, but it is not as fat and chewy and some RISs.

4.8,14,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The flavor is roasted chocolate malts with hints of vanilla and caramel. This gives way to hoppy character with a slight vinous tone, then back to a little hop bitterness. Absolutely smooth, well balanced, very drinkable, and even ends a little tannic. I dare anyone to notice a slight trace of alcohol in this...it's just not there, in my opinion. Great job here, I can't believe that I've not picked this up sooner and probably missed my opportunity to stock my cellar. Very impressed...","irishmoss","May 14, 2004"

The smell is very roasted with a chocolate espresso note to it. The initial flavor I got was a strong roasted coffee precense. The roasted flavors turn into a burnt chocolate that is a little unsettling. Hops mix with the alcohol and provide a spicyness, almost fruitiness but then become more bitter the further I go. The finish is alcohol dry. The body was slightly thinner than I would have hoped for. This was a good complex beer but not my favorite in the Imperial Stout category.","granger10","May 06, 2004"

It seemed to have a slight coffee/chocolate aroma. Very dark with a tight frothy head. Delicious coffee and chocolate flavor with a full-bodied palate. It's listed here as 9% ABV, but this can't be right. It tasted as though it were 5.5 to 6.5% at most. If this is 9% ABV, GLBC should be given an award for masking alcohol content. Stouts are not my favorite beers, but this stout will force me to go to Frank B. Fuhrer Wholesale Company in the South Side to pick up a keg, assuming it is still available.","wbickerton","Apr 16, 2004"

Flavor is an absolutely amazing combniation of espresso, some notes of port wine, and spicy hops - bold and potent... with a noticeable alcohol burn.

The head quickly goes away. I get mostly a chocolate aroma from the beer. Another sniff reveals a roasted coffee aroma. Actually it smells freshly brewed. First sip reveals a very dry, woody tasted with more roasted and burnt notes than chocolate. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and not syrupy or thick at all. Alcohol bite doesn't seem present at first. Several sips into the glass a pronounced bitter aftertaste is developing. A beer for sipping. It will take a while to get through the glass. Still Bell's gets my vote for a better Imperial Stout in the Midwest.","mjohn27603","Mar 20, 2004"

4.55,8.1,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Black. Opaque. It is stunning in its depth; it is an abyss in my glass. The russet head reached a very modest ¼ of an inch before it quickly faded to a collar. No subsequent lacing. The bouquet was simply lovely, big roasted malt aromas, a hint of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of milk-like sweetness. I couldnt detect much in the way of hops, in other words it hasnt been too Americanized. The potency is strong enough to get its point across, which is drink me! The flavors on the palate are great. I could leave the description at that. It is simply great. Big, angry, burn malts, dry coffee, and tree bark upfront, in the middle a sizable malty sweetness emerges and the first notice of the hops slide into the finish. Before I could reach the finish however the alcohol reared its head, it brought some heat and a pleasant bite. This is an outstanding Imperial Stout, be forewarned though, this isnt a hop monster like Storm King Stout, its more a kin to the SS Imperial Stout, but better. The aftertaste is long, rich malty alcohol; a hint of chocolate covered cherries, espresso, the dryness is impressive. It is very tasty. The mouthfeel is thick and hearty; the bulk on the tongue can be described as full. Carbonation levels are low but natural. It coated my mouth like lacquer. The alcohol punch is perfect, it encouraged me to sip and savor. I gladly did. This is an outstanding offering and yet another masterpiece from GLBC. This one come recommended; seek this out!

4.63,10,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"On draught at Winking Lizard (served in a snifter). I didn't think my luck could get much better after learning they were finally bottling this gem, only to find it on draught mere miles from my home! The beer is an inky black color with a thin light brown head. The head dissipates but never dissapears, and the lacing is thin. Strong roasty aroma of coffee and chocolate as it warmed. Rich bodied, with a nicely balanced blend of coffee, chocolate, malt and hops flavors. The alcohol is well-hidden too. This Imperial is definitely on the hoppy side for the style but it is pulled off very well. Some Imperials are borderline cloying with the big chewy malt/alcohol flavors but that is not the case here. The finish retains the coffee and hops aspect and makes this abundantly drinkable. I don't think this version is really any better or worse than the bottled, but it's still a great beer.","Dogbrick","Mar 08, 2004"

4.6,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Appearance: Pitch black, nice sized tan head about two fingers width deep as it dwindles patches of lacing cling to the sides of my brandy snifter. Aroma: Loads of roasted malts, creamy edged moccha explosion, with the chocolate layers very complex alcohol is there but not in your face. Nice hop profile in the aroma that is blended between everything else that's going on. Taste: Great blend of dark roasted malts, alcohol, fruit tones, and cascades, awesome stuff. Very balanced despite being on the hoppier side of the Imperial Stout spectrum. Mouthfeel: Full bodied silky texture to it coats the palate very nicely. Drinkability: Awesome imperial stout doesn't miss a beat. Great flavor and the drinkability is it's greatest characteristic, I sometimes find the Storm King a bit on the hoppy side this one does it just right for my tastes.","WVbeergeek","Feb 17, 2004"

4.65,10.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Okay, I guess I will be the first to give my opinion on the lastest and greatest from Great Lakes. I believe this imperial actually replaces the Emmet Stout, but I am not positive. The beer poured as black as the night with no light even remotely penetrating that dark mass of liquid. It formed an dark tan foamy head that disipated, coating the glass with lace. The aroma was a heavy mix of hops, malt and roasted expresso coffee, which just a hint of chocolate. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate and a touch of raisins. The finish was a touch burnt and rounded out a bit light in the ending notes after showing a more medium body at the presentation. I will have to compare it to some others to find who it most resembles, but so far it reminds me of the non imperial, but great, Bell's Java Stout.","Wildman","Feb 13, 2004"
3.73,-11.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Good tasty stout on special tap at GLBC. Poured pitch black with a tan nitro head and plenty of lacing up and down the glass. Smell was almost cloying as there was nothing but huge estery sweetness and tons of alcohol, but it was perfect for the weather. Taste was smooth and extremely full bodied with tons more sweetness such as caramel and fake maple syrup as well as a hint of roasted grain. There was also enough alcohol to put a surgery patient under. Mouthfeel was great as it was a nitro pour. This baby was rough around the edges and could do with some good aging, but it hit the spot perfectly. When I took the tour I found out they are planning on bottling this under the name ""Blackout Stout"".","GreatPondBrewer","Nov 30, 2003"
