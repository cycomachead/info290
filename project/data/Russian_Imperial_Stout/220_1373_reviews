"Very good value."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with some ruby highlights. Cocoa dominates the aroma but mixes with a  bit cedar. Tastes of cocoa and molasses with a curious caramel sweetness. Finishes somewhat dry, but sticky chocolate/burnt marshmallow sweetness coats the tongue but the bitter dark grains and hops seem to keep the beer from being too sweet. It's dryness makes it a dangerously drinkable imperial stout."
"Best IS I've ever scored for $4. Would buy again... every time I see it!"
""

"Nice nOn bitter RIS. Not quite thick enough but enjoyable."
"This beer looked promising, though I didn't know what to expect. It turned out that the flavor was kinda strange, though not terrible. I would not get this beer again nor recommend it to anyone. There are some beers that you would not buy again, but are glad you tried it once. This is not one of those beers. I regret buying it."
""
""
"Nice blend of flavors. Mildly boozy, mildly chocolaty, and a subtle touch of coffee. All about those roasted malts. Almost no hop profile at all. Also kinda sweet at times. Caramel and toffee?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour a khaki sustaining head. I get a cherry and vanilla scent with roasted malt backbon. Roasted flavors With nutty undertones. Full bodied feel. Great beer ."

"Lagunitas is the shiznit PERIOD."

"Black colour, I mean really black colour, with light brown lacing that lasts. Aroma is roasted malt with definite cocoa and coffee smells. The taste is much like I discribe in the aroma but with a vanilla twist. Aftertaste is when the hops sneak through but is balances well with the sweet malts. Mouthfeel is light for a stout. Overall a quite enjoyable beer. I think I'll have another."
"Midnight black with very dark brown color when held to the light. Dark tan lacing that persists for a long time. The smell is faint, but noticeable smell of espresso and alcohol, which also predominates in the taste. An initial espresso sweetness turns into burnt toast taste with a nutella sweetness--not really chocolate. Anise and bitter earthy hops take over as a long-lasting pleasant bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent--viscous and creamy, easily oxygenated in the mouth.  Generally a very solid imperial stout, but not one of the best. I'd buy and drink again."
""
""
""
"This was some deliciously easy drinking. For 9.9% abv, it went down awfully smooth."
""
""
"Example: TheItalianStallion is a fucking idiot."
"O: Overall this wasn't bad, but it wasn't as rich and robust as I'm used to for beers of this style. It seemed more like a stout then an imperial stout to me. In my opinion the aromas and flavors were a bit too subtle."
""
""
"The coating I mention is a smoothe body, and the lingering finish is an interesting blend of softly bitter with intermittent pricks of sharply sweet moments."
""
""
""
""
"Nice dark color. Smooth thick head at pour. Sweet molasses smell with some chocolate undertones. Rich and smooth taste, with a warm bitterness towards the end."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce standard brown glass bomber with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Good, except that it tastes slightly burnt."
"Overall: This was a passable beer, just a bit disappointing for an Imperial Stout. I like their Cappuccino Stout a lot more."
""
""
"Pours a coffee black with little head it wasn't an aggressive pour mind you. Smells of roasted malts, coffee beans and a bit of molasses. Tastes of a roasted sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruits , and a bitter coffee taste at the end. Overall a good brew for a great price. Give it a 8.75"
""
"Overall: Great beer for the style, sweeter than many but delicious. Make sure its not too cold otherwise you'll miss a lot of the flavors - I will definitely stock up on this beauty. Thanks Lagunitas for this 'Unlimited Release' !"
"O:  Very nice basic imperial stout.  Highly drinkable, and very affordable. I need to add this to my list of regular stouts."
"But you cant always find that gem"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great, hearty, thick stout that will spin your cranium at 9.9 abv.  A bit on the sweet side, but I'm desperately searching for a flaw - awesome stout overall."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/2/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, herbal, and roasted/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light dark fruit, light char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Russian imperial stout style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt, earthy hop, and light dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Decent lasting head which laced my pint glass.  Sweet finish with nice roasty tones.   I could easily drink two in a night."
"Poured into a Hair of the Dog glass. Smooth, with the usual chocolate and coffee notes. Nice lacing. As mentioned, this is a great beer for the price."
"Great go-to stout, the price is always right."
""
"By no means a bad beer. However, it seems to me to fall between a regular stout and an imperial stout (regarding flavor, not alcohol), and does not come anywhere close to having the complexities seen in others (Stone RIS, Rasputin, etc.). Considering the price though it is a pretty good bargain. I would recommend this as a good beer to try for beginners before getting into some of the other RISs mentioned above."

"One of my go to stouts love the chocolate in this one"

"Honestly, I picked this up as a afterthought because the price was pretty reasonable for an RIS.  It proved to be a solid straight-forward stout that is not a wallet buster."
"O: [3.75] Overall this is a decent beer.  I think there are 12 oz. bottles that I would go to first - but this is a good one to share or sip over a long period.  The nose is a little off for me - but there is nothing offensive on the palate and the mouthfeel is in the really good range."

"Im not sure how this beer is rated so low on this site, perhaps there used to be a different recipe? It says in the notes is was 8.2% in 2010, now its 9.9%, not sure. Anyway, this is a bargain at the always low Lagunitas bomber pricing, and a very underrated beer."

"The more I drink this beer the more I like it, it must be the warming to the right temperature that is doing it (make sure you let it warm up to around 50).  Awesome stout and surprisingly drinkable at 9.9% abv with no hint of alcohol.  If you like stouts this is a must have, Cheers!"

"A most excellently priced and tasty imperial stout. I think this would benefit really well from time in the barrel, to add more layers of flavor to it."

"Lagunitas delivers a fairly typical Imperial Stout but with a touch of ""west coast"" thrown in. It displays dark bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, milk-chocolate covered espresso beans, almost burnt-sugar, burnt toast, dark caramel, dark skinned fruits, and some minor black currant backed by minty, piney, floral and leafy/grassy hops. It's a touch spicy as well but I'm not sure if that's from hops or alcohol, and there's also a minor suggestion of Bourbon as well. There's almost a smokiness to it just before the swallow, and then it gives off notes of licorice and ash. It lingers, slowly fading, eventually giving up a ghost of ashen-smoke, leaves, and Bourbon. The real flavor, however, is at the front where all of the chocolate is, and it's got great depth of flavor, if not as full in body as some might expect. For the price, this is a steal!"

"22 Oz Bomber.Pours black color into a charmay glass.Smell is a light chocolate with a hint of coffee.Taste is fairly smooth.Light chocolate with coffee.I liked it.It wasn`t what I would say was great but pretty good and you can`t beat the price at 5.99 a bottle.Nice ABV at 9.9.Give it a try.Great Value."

"The price is the true selling point here: $5 for a bomber. I have another one in the cellar but I'm going to pick up more to age and enjoy. Great RIS."

"Imperial Stout pours a black color with a small lacing head.  There is a nice malty aroma with some black licorice notes.  The taste is the same, nice creamy malty aroma, some notes of black licorice.  A little watery, but still nice creamy body.  Overall its a pretty decent beer, very creamy."

"Overall - You can barely tell this is 9.9% ABV. It drinks so easily and tastes so darned good, you'll put this one away and fall off your chair before you can say ""He's had enough!"" This could go down as one of my favorite Impy stouts, and since it's so easy to find, that's just icing on this dark, decadent beer cake."

"O:  A surprisingly good RIS; one I would easily recommend.  I'd pay twice as much for this terrific brew.  Well done, Lagunitas."

"Good there's just a touch of alcohol bite in this that keeps it from being top shelf to me. Body and appearance are great. Mild sweetness and a bit heavier on coffee notes than others I've had."
"9.9% abv, $4 all day for a bomber? Sold! Perhaps I'm bumping my score up a bit because of this, but it's hard not to take into consideration."

"This is a top notch Imperial Stout!"
"For the price, this is a great imperial stout. It doesn't really stand up against the big boys IMO, but at $5 a bomber, it may well be the best bargain in its class. 3.75"
""
""
""
""
""
"Full from start to finish, its decadent richness is sliced through with alcohol spice and thinning warmth. Its final bitterness is woodsy and as much of burnt coffee and chicory root as it is of hops. Its long coffee-like linger links up with the next sip effortlessly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this brew could use some thickness and could be more enjoyable in my opinion if the chocolate was more prevalent."

"O- A decent Imperial Stout that is enjoyable and makes me love Lagunitas all the more for it!"

"A good affordable big stout that does not really do anything exciting by todays standards. Just wish for a fuller body as that was the big disappointment."

"22oz bottle revealed a nice dark-brown, almost dark-black stout with small khaki-tan head. Smell is mostly of coffee with a hint of chocolate coming through as well as roasted malts, and a marshmallow sweetness. Taste pretty much matches the aromas with the roasted coffee being upfront and most noticeable on the palate. Slight sign of carbonation and pretty solid medium bodied brew with a smooth/slick mouthfeel. I found this Imperial Stout to be better than expected. Well done Lagunitas!"

"Nice Imperial stout from Lagunitas. Pours pitch black with light tan head that dies down to lightly clinging lacing. Nose of fudge, coffee, and deeply roasted grains. Taste is excellent. Smooth chocolate fudge like flavor without being overly sweet, coffee and dark chocolate on the aftertaste with a light hop background. Alcohol warmth on the aftertaste gives this one a big boost without overtaking the other parts of the beer. VERY nice. Cheers."
"Black as night, with a surprisingly light beige head that lingers. Aroma is roasty, with tar and dark cocoa chiming in. Flavor reveals a roast malt base, with hints of chocolate and a slightly metallic finish. It's a little light in malt complexity for an imperial stout."

"Pretty good beer. The alcohol is completely hidden, and this beer drinks almost like a 6% porter rather than a 10% Imperial Stout. Not blowing me away by any means, but the price is impossible to argue with. For better or for worse, this is also a really drinkable beer. It's not super interesting as far as flavor, but it's definitely enjoyable and ought to be tried, if for no other reason than the price."

"Dark dark dark. Midnight with no moon. Hoppy-bitter but not herbaceous. A drizzle of foreign oil. Thick and smooth. 18-ounce bottle: ""it's a sufficiency, mother."" I like it a lot. If you like a stout -- man or woman, you will like to try this. Then go dancing naked under that dark moonless sky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Somewhat bland malt profile combines with a subtle off smell to leave me unimpressed. This is a solid OK when defining the style, but its definitely unrefined and a little ""bold and boozy"" resulting from a yeast with high attenuation. Leave some of those sugars alone!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew is a step below Great Lakes Expedition Stout. But it's still very good."

"O-A very good big stout. Easy drinking, smooth with good flavor. Not a ton of complexity and the least hoppy beer i've had from Lagunitas. My favorite beer from them. It's a good thing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty underwhelming beer especially given that its an imperial stout. It doesn't bring anything impressive to the table on its own merits. You'd do better to pick up Old Rasputin or Storm King which are better RIS's for a similar price point."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad. I've had better and worse. Prob won't get it again."
""
""
""
"On the light side of medium bodied, for the style. Has modest carbonation, and there is a dark roasted malt aftertaste which is somewhat bitter. The alcohol is well hidden for a 9.9 % abv beer. This is a fairly average beer."

"pours a drak brown out of the bottle turning a drak brownish/black in the glass. thin beige cappuchino colored head that doesnt last to long with some bubble floating up top. wierd smell. i get almost a hint of vinegar. makes me question how the beer store kept this bottle. i also get some dark fruit rasins & prunes. sharp coffee bitterness on the front of the tounge followed by a watered down cocoa note and boozyness. and a soy sauce type flavor??? strange. finishing with a roasty note and more soy sauce. the mouthfeel is thin for me given the style. overall this not the best imperial stout ive had.. for the price ($4.99 in NY) its not bad. but the only thing imperial about this stout is the boozyness thats very present after each sip. the soy sauce flavor just kills it for me. i usually like lagunitas offerings. but i wont be buying this again. old rasputin to me is the benchmark by which i judge imperial stouts. this just doesnt cut it!"
"O: This is awesome. I was afraid I'd bought a dud due to the reviews, but no. AND it's so cheap! I will definitely be picking another one up soon."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent imperial stout but far from the best I have had. There is just not a ton of depth here and i would expect more with this style and a beer of this strength. Probably won't pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great Imperial Stout for the $$. Not as bold and distinct as some of the classics, but a solid beer.The scent is unremarkable, but the look is an appetizing dark, oily black. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than you might expect but nice and creamy. The taste is roasted malt and coffee, with a touch of chocolate. I know this doesn't live up to the greats but it really matches my palate well. It's a great everyday Imperial Stout. The low rating here made me reluctant to try it. Big mistake. Way underrated and a steal at $4.99 a bomber."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an impressive imperial stout, that only improves with temp. I let this one sit for 20 minutes or so to warm from the fridge. Even so, it gained character and strength during my evaluation as the temperature rose. Bold, impressive and at 9.9%, ""it gets you drunk!"" Check it out if you are into the style. Another fine brew from Lagunitas ."

"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when I first poured the beer. Not as heavy and black on black as I love in imperial stouts, and the nose felt overly sweet. But the taste is pretty solid, Black currant is the most dominant flavor followed by chicory and cloves. Not my favorite stout, but still a pretty good beer"

"I paired this bad boy with smoky roasted chicken and Harissa-spiced potatoes. Wow daddy! It's roasted malt and subtle dark fruit and licorice spice danced wonderfully with the earthy spices and subtle heat in the food, each bringing out and accenting the other. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this beer as much without the food pairing, but it was quite the experience. I will remember this beer for a long time."

"This comes across as more of a coffee stout to me. It is a flavorful beer, but I think throttling the coffee back a bit and letting the other flavors come through. The lack of complexity keeps this from being a truly great beer, but still worth checking out."
"I liked this imperial stout overall. Nothing to complain about."

"Lagunitas.They make several different beers.Cheers."

"Overall- when I see ""Imperial"" I expect to see boldness akin to the likes of an angry old Khrushchev, this didn't quite meet those impressions in the taste and mouthfeel categories. Even though Lagunitas tells me it weighs in heavy at an OG of 1.092, it feels much much lighter. This would have scored higher as a regular stout, but as imperial... the oomph just isn't there."
""
"Poured from a big ol' 1-pint bottle into the equivalent sized glass ... The only beer of the evening, needless to say. This deep, dark, and dense brew is opaque brown grading into black territory with a copious quantity of tan head. A rather fizzy stout and it smells absolutely astonishing. Quite smoky initially, then gets uber-sweet, redolent with burnt toffee, dates, dark chocolate sauce, vanilla, and a hint of citrus hop. Surprisingly almost no alcohol on the nose for such a big beer.... that shows up in spades on the palate though. Taste is a mosaic of aggressive dark malts, earthy tobacco-like hops, coffee grinds, a herbal note like licorice, and dry ash ... There is an initial warm sweetness like chocolate sauce and pecan pie but this does not persist as long as expected, at which point things evolve into a semi-dry oak wood ashy bitterness along with a large blast of aromatic alcohol that after a while starts to recall cinnamon extract (think those little red candies from Valentine's Day). My eyes started to water about half way though a pint, perhaps I should have shared this with somebody. Buttery, thick mouthfeel prolongs the experience. Rather whiskey-like in some ways. Tinges of hop resin put in an appearance. A sweet booze bomb. Solid Russian imperial stout if a tad coarse, astringent and aggressive."
""
"Good beer would not be my first choice for an Imperial stout, but for the price I definitely don't feel like I got bad about drinking one. I like aging beer and I may pick one up to store for a year and see what happens."
""
""
"o- Very pleasant, ABV is high, and not unusually it is more present in the palate than the nose. I'm not in love, but I did enjoy the tryst. Overall a pleasant, sweet and complex, malty and earthy stout that I plan on revisiting... especially for the price (paid $4.20 at Spec's in Dallas for a 22)."
"Tasty, standard fare for a RIS. Certainly up to par, but nothing particularly memorable or thought provoking."

"O: A really great beer, much more than I was expecting from a brewery that (from 90% of stores) looks like one focused on pale ales. Very dark and flavor-packed but not unpalatable-y bitter, even for those who aren't into IS's. A great value, too- 22oz for $6. Might become my new go-to winter IS."
""
""
""
"22 oz bomber. Pours black as you'd expect with a light brown head of foam that dissipates into what looks like an oil spill floating on top of the beer. Aroma is caramel, coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, hint of whiskey. Thick and almost creamy in the mouth, a tad astringent/acidic, mellow bitterness from the hops comes through in the end. More whiskey in the flavor than the aroma but it's surprisingly easy to drink given the ABV. Good stuff."

"O Lagunitas, in this reviewers opinion, makes the best IPAs in the universe. They also make some damn fine stouts. Cappuccino Stout is awesome. BACS is one of the two or three best BA stouts I've ever had. This brew doesn't stand up with the former two, but it's still damn good. Rich and flavorful. I'm still confused as to why the aroma is so weak. Nevertheless, that's basically unimportant. Really good stout."

"Hoppy just like the rest of their beers, i'd classify this as an imperial porter or a black ipa. It does not have near the body thickness that it need to be an Imperial stout. It is much more hoppy than most r.i.s. I've had, not that r.i.s. cant be hoppy (Brau Brother's Ivan the Great is THE hoppiest stouts, [fresh of course] that I have ever had) There is not much of the normal aromas and flavor depths that you get from most r.i.s. either. some booziness and roasted malts and hops in the aroma and the flavor is pretty much the same, booziness not really well masked. the price is definitely the best thing about this beer."
"O: solid beer, I've had better stouts, but this is excellent overall, perfect for after dinner with dessert"
""
""
"O: Not the big, bold, roasty interpretation that most brewers today have latched on to. Alcohol is a little too hot and forward, but this may diminish with time. It does seem to drink like a beer that is too young. It would be interesting to see what time would do. The abv is there, but the beer just doesn't seem to have the type of malt body that would smooth and mellow out like some do. It's priced very well, but even still I don't see it making much noise in this market when there are other quality options readily available, particularly in the 4-pack 12oz format."

"O: I mean it was good, but I was expecting greatness from lagunitas because of their other beers having such a well balance hop and malt combination, which I thought would come through especially well in a imperial stout. Still it was a solid beer, but just a little expensive for the other options out there"

"Not a very high retention beer, but leaves a great mark. Probably the best bomber that I could buy for $4.95. I'll continue buying this beer because of the fantastic taste mixed with the unreal price."

"Overall - 3.75 - This is being generous. I have an issue with breweries that I know use advanced techniques that I can't accomplish in my own home with a 5 gallon plastic bucket and a brew pot, who still come out with beer that's equal to my quality. This beer is a great example. At least Lagunitas has Hop Stoopid so it has one affordable beer to compare to top ranking beers."
""
""
"O: Fantastic stout for the price! If you know of a better stout that I can find in Cali for $5 a bomber, please let me know."
""
""
"O - this scores big points for value, and sticking to Lagunitas's style of hop heavy handed-ness, providing an experience that can be enjoyed again and again with reasonable availabilty and price. I think that this is an RIS I would opt not to cellar, the high hop aromas and flavors stick about from the standard heavy malt roastyness of the many examples of the style out there and make this unique."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid RIS here folks. Lagunitas has yet another solid beer. Another please."
""
""
"Overall, Lagunitas has done a very nice job with this Imperial Stout, offering a massive and well-balanced flavor range that should please fans of the style. There’s not necessarily anything game-changing about the beer, but what it does, it does very well."
""
""
""
"O: A solid imperial stout from a brewery known for their hoppier beers. Quite underrated IMO, but I don't mind anise and I know people that just flat out hate it. Not the most complex imperial stout either, but it's still solid and very drinkable. Great price point as always from Lagunitas"

"Overall – The 9.9% abv is actually hidden very well which when mixed with the roasted malt, low bitterness, and the stronger fruit/caramel presence, make for a surprisingly drinkable and enjoyable sweeter imperial overall."
"overall: A great take on an RIS, and for the $4.99 price, a great buy. However, I would rather shell out the extra $3 while the Stone is still around, and i'd easily pick a Ten Fidy, Expedition Stout, or even an Old Rasputin over this, which is arguably the only other widely (and always) available i've listed above. Not bad, but it's just not as balanced as some of it's competition, it's a little booze heavy and the earthy hops combined with the bitter espresso tones just make it slightly off balance, but it's still enjoyable."
"Overall, This is a very citrusy stout. nonetheless, this is a great Stout, I Liked Stone's Imperial version better, but this is up there. Lagunitas Brewing Company should market this as their Stout, because there is room for improvement. Not quite as balanced as I would expect from a RIS."

"Overall this is a pretty tasty brew, nice amount of hops to give it a rough and tumble feel. Definitely a nice price point!"
"A solid, good quality stout at a very economical price and worthy of repeat buys. Slightly robust stout with a dark appearance with possible evidence of Patten specialty grains, possible barley for aroma and taste with some pronounced (more than normal) hop tones such as cascade or golden."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent RIS not much else to say."
""
"It appears a jet black tone. The head disappears quickly, low carbonation levels. The smell consists of nutty raisins with a touch of chocolate. The taste reveals a syrup like texture with lots of dark fruit and some hop flavor to follow. The body is medium, but not syrupy. I'd say this is a solid imperial stout, but nothing spectacular."

"O - Likely best enjoyed with some vanilla ice cream or cookies, this is no session beer and it will dominate your palate. This is a good thing though. On the whole, I'd say it's a very solid and enjoyable beer."

"Mouth feel is full bodied. A lot of body and thickness makes it a very robust brew. Highly astringent in terms of alcohol and charred character."

"Khaki head quickly disolves to subtle reminders around the edge of my tulip. It light's up a deep rich chocolate but not the true black of an RIS. Vanilla and toffee notes hide the alcohol on the nose and smoothly roll into a bittersweet chocolate finish across the tongue. It's smooth, and very easy drinking, with a soft foam finish. An impressive beer."

"Lagunitas Imperial Stout ---4/5."
""
"This pours a very dark brown color with an average chocolate brown colored head. There are lots of robust scents in the aroma mixed with caramel, vanilla, and coffee. The taste is silky smooth and robust. It is not overpowering by any means yet delivers a full flavor taste. There is a very complex taste of malts, grains, and extracts. Not the best stout on the market but pretty damn good for the price."
""
"o - Overall a nice stout. Not too strong and not as big as I was expecting, but looks nice and has a greta mouthfeel, and a nice sweet vanill and chocolate taste. Worth checking out, would like to have it again."
"Notes: Decent beer, just wish they balanced the acidity. For $4 a 22oz, its still a sweet deal for a solid Imp. Stout though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad I tried it though..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- People always say Lagunitas should just stick to the hoppy beers, but this ain't bad. I wouldn't be pining for it every year around its release date, but I certainly think it's worth the dough I spent on it."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very good RIS for the price! Is it a great RIS no, but solid and will drink again."
""
""
""
"is only average in their lineup."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid Imperial Stout. Good burnt roasty flavors and a well balanced sweetness."
""
""
""
"O: Probably the poorest effort I've ever had from Lagunitas. Alcohol flavor is potent and ruins most of the beer for me, even though it is lower than some of their other brews (Brown Shugga). Not what I've come to expect from a this brewery."
""
"22oz bomber poured into a 25oz snifter. Pours near black with a rocky, tan head that holds excellent retention. Aromas are sweet malts, chocolate, molasses, plenty of dark fruit notes. Tastes are rich & sweet with dark fruits, chocolate, raspberry-like tartness, earthy, boozy. Medium bodied, smooth at first but the alcohol is hot & burns the throat on the way down. Overall, it's different than other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had in the past. It actually seemed more like a Baltic Porter, especially with the fruitiness and lack of roastiness. Not bad, but unfortunately I wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly bog-standard impy stout. expertly brewed and balanced however."
"Pleasantly surprised at how good this is. With Lagunitas, I would guess this was pretty hoppy fresh, but with the age, this has a very nice fruit/malt complexity. Drinks really easy too for the abv."
""
""
"Pours a typical opaque reddish brown. Durable tan head with sheets of lacing. The head is so durable in fact it never actually completely disappears; 5/5!!! Smell is very boozy, pungently alcoholic even. Nothing too exotic or unexpected with notes of bakers chocolate, espresso, wheat bread, caramel, dark fruits. Flavor is equally strong but well balanced. The malt and chocolate notes come through the most with a hint of sweetness making it very easy to drink. The alcohol is far less apparent in the flavor than the smell. This beer is overwhelmingly underrated in my opinion. Read my Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout review. Whatever Lagunitas is doing with their other beers is unknown to me, but they seem to have stouts figured out."
""
""
"Overall: This is a well crafted brew…it’s not dominant in any one category, but the overall package is fantastic…at 9.9% ABV, one bomber is a nice night of relaxing with a board game or hanging out with the wifey…it’s lower upper level for the field and easily recommended for your consumption…I’d consider buying another one of these for cellaring, just to see how it plays out in a year or two…(4/5)"

""

""
""
""
"Definitely well made, just not super exciting or stand-out. All elements miss just slighly for me, from a kind of thin appearance and feel to a little bit too much of an alcohol presence. But it's definitely drinkable and tasty."
""
"Overall: This is my go-to, easy-to-find (in Portland), great value beer when I'm in the mood for an imperial stout (which is fairly often). It's fairly well-balanced, slightly sweet but with the characteristic Lagunitas bitter finish. Not too complex, but definitely good and drinkable - again and again. I like this one a lot."
"O: good not amazing but good. simple RIS, not pretentious. But I like it."

""

"O - A slightly brash, unconventional RIS. Overall solid, and good for those looking for something a little different, or extremely drinkable. For those craving a large burnt bitter profile, this might not be their cup of tea. That said, I really did enjoy this, and might buy again when in the mood."
"Overall, this is a solid imperial stout and well worth the price, but there are other offerings that make this look a little lacking in comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Excessively fruity. Almost more of an export stout with dark Belgian fruit notes."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a big, sweet, malty, sticky imperial stout. It's actually like a Dark Lord 2010 Lite. I usually like a bit more bitterness as balance, but this is quite good for what it is. This is one I'd gladly drink again if I saw it. Perhaps I'll get my parents to pick up another one next year. Cheers guys!"
"Overall this RIS does not compare to most others out there. Too light in taste and body, just not enough flavor to make this a great beer."
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. I'm certainly not disappointed. It's unfortunate that people are trashing it, probably because today's uber imperial everything makes any traditional RIS pale in comparison. Not quite as thick or heavy as Founders, Siberian Night, or Expedition, but still quite tasty. I would buy it again, and am glad I bought 2 bottles before I read other peoples reviews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose of rich, heavy chocolate and roasted coffee. Roasted malts and chocolate syrup. It smells like my kind of stout. No booziness at all, which is nice for this high of an ABV. Taste is surprisingly heavy on the anise/black licorice. Coffee, dark roasted malts, anise and very slight chocolate. There is a warmth deep in my stomach but no hint of alcohol in the actual taste. The mouthfeel is much lighter than expected for an imperial stout. Its kind of bubbly. Still nice and heavy though. Overall its a nice stout (my first from Lagunitas) but I wish the taste reflected the nose more, I'm not always a huge fan of the anise-heavy stouts. Still delicious."
"O-- Straight forward and pretty basic RIS. Nothing special about it really."
"Overall- Pretty nice. Easy drinking for an RIS, and different enough to stand out. Good price point, too. I'll be picking this one up again."
""
""
"O) Nice beer... A pleasant sipper for the snifter. The 9.9 makes one bomber plenty for unwinding after a long day. Thanks Lagunitas, glad to recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - For a style of beer I rarely don't enjoy, Lagunitas really missed the mark with this one. A rather bland, uneventful representation of the style."
"Overall a decent offering but nothing special."
""
"O- At 4 dollars for a 22oz bomber you will be hard pressed to find one better quality. I would buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's quite good for what it is - a ""mass"" produced, plain Imperial Stout. I wish the nose had something interesting going for it, but it's a solid entry from one of the bigger breweries in CA."
""
"This is a great stout, one of my favorite beers, and it a 10%+ beer without a acidic taste. I always buy this beer, and really enjoy it. Nice creamy head and wonderful taste. I like some of the Oregon Dark Beers and Stouts but this one is much better, very smooth beer, even with the high alcohol content and stout, it is still very smooth."
""
"Perhaps Lagunitas should just stick with the Hop forward beers, or rethink this brew, because I'd to be able to purchase a really good stout from Lagunitas for 4.50$"
""
""
""
"O: A very different, fruity imperial stout. Definitely not what I was expecting, but enjoyable nonetheless. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty one dimensional in my opinion and just an ok stout compared to many of those on the market. Decent for the price, and I love almost everything Lagunitas puts out, but this just wasn’t very memorable."
""
""
"O: While far from being the most enjoyable, flavorful, or unique Imperial Stout I have ever had, it's still tasty. All the elements are there, if muted and hard to distinguish. This isn't awe-inspiring, but it's affordable, easy drinking and would make a decent introduction to the style. I recommend this if it's on sale, or it's the only Imperial Stout available in your area, otherwise keep your eyes open for something else."
"I have visited Lagunitas Brewing Co. 3 times and highly recommend it thy have a great tour and are kid and dog friendly."
"DOA"
""
""
""
"Overall - This Imperial pulls back on aggressiveness, and relies a bit more on sweet, balanced flavor. Lagunitas made the right call. It's just dark and thick enough to be called an imperial, but it doesn't sock you in the face and question your manhood like your average RIS. Sometimes, this is a good thing. The 9.9% is well hidden."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth. Creamy some roasty coffee flavors linger through the finish. I'd say it's pretty given the privce point of Lagunitas' beers."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Above average stout, prob won't get it again."
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer for the price. I got this beer for $3.21 and it was well worth it for a bomber. Not the best imperial stout, but not horrible."
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a good RIS, I have had many beers from Lagunitas but all them have been pretty hoppy so I didn't know what they could do with this style but they ended up making a pretty traditional RIS where the roasted malts are the highlight and the hops take a back seat. This beer had good drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, wasn't overly boozy and if I wasn't splitting this bottle with my brother I don't think I would have a hard time drinking it by myself. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything too off or out of style with this RIS. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher then normal carbonation and the fact that it wasn't as roasty and robust as some of the better RIS's. I'm pretty sure I will buy this beer again next time they release it and I recommend this to anyone who likes the style. I was pretty satisfied with this RIS, it's not up there with my favorites of the style but it is still a good and tasty RIS that hit the spot on a cold winter night, I was unsure how good a dark beer from Lagunitas would turn out but they proved to me that they just aren't a tasty hoppy beer brewery, they have more range then I thought and that only further cements my feeling that they are one of my favorite out of state brewery's, keep making tasty beers and I'll keep drinking them."
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a dark almost pitch black with a small tan colored head. The smells are of dark roasted malts and alcohol. The feel is medium to thick. The taste is okay not anywhere the best irs I've had but at least its cheap, some dark toasted malts and alcohol."
""
"Top-down forming head, dark mocha colored beer with a thin head. Smells like roasted malts and hops, nothing more than average. The taste is smooth and drinkable but nothing about it says IMPERIAL, not aggressive at all. Hop notes are present but not over barring."
"Overall, this is a good imperial stout. I'd make it a little less caramel sweet and more towards the chocolate end of things, but it's solid. Another good bomber from Lagunitas."
"B-"
""
""
"I have to agree with many of the reviews that I read. Lagunitas makes great beer and it is very good but nothing amazing. It looks good, smells good and tastes good but I expected a little more when drinking a lagunitas beer. They are usually extremely out of the ordinary and very special to drink. You can definitely smell and taste the roasted malt character and it is a bit sweet. I have to admit for an imperial stout it is very smooth and east to drink. I just think about there cappuccino stout and how you can really taste the cappuccino and felt as though i was drinking an iced coffee. With this beer I was unable to find that defining characteristic, other than the roasted malt, that would make this beer really special. Overall a good beer and I would recommend for a try."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer, but as far as Russian Imp Stouts go...very run of the mill."
"O-Pretty good. I have am hit or miss with russian imperials but this one is pretty freakin good. Not the best but pretty good."
""
""
"Decent overall. The look was not really what I was expecting... looks more like a Belgian dark ale or something in that vein. Not much lacing or head. I poured this into a snifter glass, however the aroma is not over the top. Some burnt coffee notes, dark toffee, and burnt malt. Taste has a bit of a smoky feel to it, with the dryness balancing out any sweetness in the malt. Like bitterness and acidity on the end of the taste. No real cream aspects to speak of, and nothing that screams stout to me per say. Mouthfeel is actually quite watery for the style. High alcohol percentage that is present in the taste, and I kind of enjoy for the smokey aspect of it. Overall I like this beer, but style wise I would probably go for some better representations of this style. Overall I generally love Lagunitas, and I find this beer to be good, but not quite what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid stout on the sweet end of the spectrum. I could see buying this again when I want a strong Milk Stout."
"This is almost like an imperial brown ale with a more roasted character. Not particularly complex...the lingering astringency really hurts the flavor overall. This just doesn't quite come together to me, and is a rare let down from Lagunitas."
""
""
"Overall: Has it's ""issues"" but not my issue if you know what I mean. Keep drinking and be blessed, this is awesome beer. Salud!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a good imperial stout at a really good price. In a world of increasingly huge stouts, this one fits right in, while not trying to be a copycat."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up a bomber and poured into my Afflihem chalice. Deep brown black with slight tan head which left only a slight lace around the rim. Smell them malts and coffee. Tastes rich and malty and mildly coffee au chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with alcohol warmth. Overall a pretty decent imperial stout. Sure there are several better examples out there but this is a reasonably priced example."
""

"It's good. It's a little thin, especially for an imperial. But it's a good beer."
""
" ~ There is a reason one is able to pick up a bomber of this beverage for around $5.00. You get what you pay for with this one. I'm not saying the ingredients in this bevy aren't up to spec but how do you otherwise explain an Imperial Stout for $5?"

"Pours a dark black with a foamy mocha head that settles to a thin ring and slight haze. Big aromas of dark roasted malt, berry jam, and chocolate. Taste is quite smooth, with more flavors of malt, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and dark berries. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a full body and lowish carbonation. Overall a solid RIS, very drinkable despite the ABV, and very affordable!"

"O= Really disappointed in this beer. I typically love all things Lagunitas but this is a weak imperial stout. No real smell or taste or even weight on it. There are much better regularly avalible RIS out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This was one of the less impressive Lagunitas brews that I've tried recently. I normally am extremely happy to sample one of their brews, but this stout was a little too simple. The sweet/smokey roasted malt was really the driving force behind this Imperial Stout and it completely dominated the beer."

"I can see people having differences of opinion on this but it's intriguing, it's powerful, and it's $5 for a big bottle."

"Overall: A fairly good beer, but certainly not as good as many others of the style. Basically, it exemplifies it well, but does nothing to innovate. Good brew for a great value (theme with Lagunitas)."
"O- Sat on this for over 7 months. Just another reason to be a fan of Lagunitas! Easy to drink. ABV sneaks up on you."
"A very tasty big stout from Lagunitas, and it actually took me by surprise at how much I enjoyed it. This is a great, inexpensive stout."
"O- Delicious. Full bodied with nice smells."
"O: Reminds me a bit of Ruben and the Jets which I was not a fan of. Just not a good IS at all. Amazing price for the style but not even worth it at that. I was scared when I saw the 1.092 OG this would be underattenuated and I was right."
"Overall - Pretty good, plenty of coffee and sweetness, moreso then standard russian imperial stouts. Alcohol comes out a little too much as it warms but other then that, for the price and how tasty it is, its soild and worth a drink."
"Everything about this beer excites me... until it hit my lips. The first thing I got was that burning flavor of a high alcohol beer. It was difficult to get passed that to further evaluate this beer. A good looking beer and a light roasted scent, big body but it wasn't pleasing to subsequently follow. I was actually a little disappointed I had a whole 22 ahead of me."
"It might not be the ideal specimen of an imperial stout, but it is certainly a great fusion version. I loved it."
"worth the purchase."
"Overall a pretty nice beer that might be a little better if aged longer (no date). Still a bit sweet, but otherwise very nice. This brewery keeps pumping out winners"
"O - Not quite to the excellent standard of the great imperial stouts, but it's good if you want a more affordable option and are craving something heavy- as this is 1/3 the price of Parabola."
"O- Pretty good IS in IMO. I like it, especially for the price!"
"Pours a straight black body with minimal tan head, even after an aggressive pour. Lots of caramel on the nose and a weird earthy/vegetal scent I can't quite put my finger on. There is a little bit of roastiness and chocolate on the nose but it is very subtle. The taste is a heavy hit of caramel, syrupy with a soy sauce flavor that is unpleasant. The mouthfeel is not as big as one would expect from this style but was okay. Overall not my favorite RIS. The only things that were unique about it, were not unique in a good way."
"overall, fairly average for the style. improves as it warms"
"Great appearance pitch oily black color nice thick tan, cinnamon colored head... great overall smell roasty, coffee, chocolate... alcohol is def present in the back of the mouth burnt coffee flavor slightly sweet... not as easy to drink as some Imperial Stouts I've had because of the heavier coffee and alcohol flavors... I'll spend a lil more time drinking this then most which isn't a bad thing since I'll be able to let it warm as I go... Mouthfeel leaves a slight alcohol burn and aftertaste... Over for the price probably buy this again but won't rush back to it if something else catches my eye..."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark, dark brown color with a thin layer or light brown head. Some lacing. Smells boozey and sweet with aromas of raisins, chocolate, caramel and some earthiness. Taste is a really boozey sweet chocolatey flavor. Some raisin and earthy flavor as well some burnt coffee. This is a pretty boozey and sweet RIS. Odd aftertaste. Not a huge fan of this one. Not much carbonation. Lagunitas rarely disappoints me but this one is lacking. Overall, there are a ton of better Imperial Stouts out there. Won't be in a rush to buy this one again."
"Poured into my 13oz tulip. Pours more clear then most imp stouts. Not much lacing, with a half inch light tan head. Smell is coffee, toffee, chocolate, & some black liquorice. Taste is same, wanted it to be bolder & thicker. It isn't bad, just very mild & lacking the greats body. Plenty of carbonation and easy drinking for the style. Wanted it to be so much more, then what it is."
"Overall a solid imperial stout. Not a stand-out but a good one at a good price."
"Well, another blah beer. There are a couple breweries that just don't agree with me, whether its water, yeast strains, or whatever. Unfortunately Lagunitas seems to be one I'm going to be avoiding in the future. This is a sub-average beer for me (& my wife agrees)."
"Poured a dark brown/burgundy, with a light tan head and light lace. Some chunky sediment and precipitated protein are evident. Nose has big licorice notes, hints of chocolate and molasses. Generally pretty sweet. More licorice, hints of smoke, some nuttieness and some cuprous notes. Lots of caramel as well. Moderate to full feel, with a sweet and roasty finish. Drinkable, but I would've like to have had this side by side with a fresh glass to compare."
"This is a perfectly reasonable drink. Nothing distinct or unique, but it goes down well and holds fine flavors. No complaints, just doesn't meet the higher standeards of many of their other beers."
"Deep brown colour, modest off white head, some lace left on the glass. Smell is of molasses, liquorice, fairly roasty with some lightly sweet notes. Taste is of liquorice, roasty malt, lightly sour lactic notes, some chocolate with raisin and dark fruits. Smooth feel, light carb, velvety texture. Pretty good stuff, not a top RIS but still a pleasant drink, wonder if this would be better really fresh."
"but hey for 4.99 i might pick this up again."
"O: A bitter Russian Imperial Stout that I consider to be a sipper. A decent representation of the style that doesn't particularly stand out."
"thanks to Ratman for this one. Bomber poured a translucent dark brown with a lasting brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, bakers cocoa, pepper and a hint of vanilla. Palate was medium to full bodied and smooth. Flavors of roasted malt,bitter chocolate, coffee and light vanilla with a smooth lingering chocolate finish."
"22 oz bomber poured into a Sam Adams glass. Moderate head dissapating quickly to ring but decent lacing. Lighter coloring than typical - with some translucence showing through. Aroma is subdued burnt caramel and coffee. Taste is a bit underwhelming for what I would expect from Lagunitas - some coffee and licorice but prune and molasses (not a good thing) as well. Alcohol well hidden. Mouthfeel rather dull - just doesn't have that tongue-coating-you'll-still-be-left-with-tomorrow-morning-when-you-wake-up that you come to expect with the better imperials stouts. Overall decent, but pretty bland for the style. I like Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout much better than this."
"Little head, but I attribute that to the fact that it was poured into a brandy snifter. Doesn't get much darker than this. Decent lacing along with the viscous coating typical of this style. Many hints of flavor but nothing dominating: molasses, black licorice, coffee and chocolate, even a dried fruit flavor reminiscent of a dubbel style, but nothing is either overbearing or pronounced. Flavor remains consistent despite temperature change; warming does not reveal any nuances. A 22oz. bottle would have been good to share with someone, but was a little bit of work for a single person. All the elements are there, but nothing really stands out in a positive way."
"Overall, probably won't be going back to this one. But I wil stick with some others from lagunitas which are delicious."
"poured from a 2oz bottle into atulip glass. a tan colored head builds up but drops quickly, with little lacing. Initial aroma is dark chocolate with a hint of black licorice and molassas. The taste is both sweet and bitter, just a tinge of alcohol heat. I think this is a very tasty imperial stout, and if it was available in my area I'd definately get it more, it's a terrific value."
"PP (Price Point) - $5.99 for a 22 oz bomber, this is a spectacular product, dont change a thing, even the price! Everything is 100% spot on for this one!!"
"I think that I hoped for a more traditional Imperial Stout from Lagunitas, but got something much more along the lines I should have expected from this brewery; high and fairly evident ABV and large bitterness. The fact that no one flavor is overpowering may not fit some people's idea of this brewery, but I think the flavor profile is well conceived."
"O: Not an outstanding imperial stout, but still a good one. I'd have another. Recommend."
"O: I think this beer is underrated; it's well-made, tasty, and everything an imperial stout should be. Just because it's not as over-the-top and majestically grand as some others of the style is not an indictment of this particular beer. Recommended. Would drink again."
"O: Not bad imperial stout. Its just not that much of a stand out."
"This beer is strong, but flavorful and good to drink. It’s fairly cheap for one bottle and one will probably do you for the night. If you come across it, don’t pass it up."
"O: I love it. Its flavorful, it's full, it's got all the right things and nothing that raises a red flag. I buy a new bomber every couple of days, but I've bought this one too every time the past week. I am happy with this purchase every time."
"Drink- I've had a lot of beers from Lagunitas lately and this continues the trend with good and tasty beers. I'd have this again on a cold day or for trying my own blend of stout/bourbon."
"Nice, smooth, and silky. A bit thin for the style. Overall an easy sippin, simple stout."
"Final thought - $3, 10% ABV and another amazing beer from Lagunitas!"
"O: This was a good RIS. Nice dark fruits like a Doppelbock, but the sweetness is mellowed out by hops (I would guess) that aren’t perceptible. Have no clue (except for slight buzz) that this contained 9.9% alcohol. Only being my 3rd RIS, the last two being this and a Yeti, I really want to try more of this style. Got a Stone RIS and Belgo Anise, and a Parabola waiting patiently. As I’ve read the hoppiness of RIS’s can vary, so if your into sweetness give this a shot."
"The price point of $5 is really attractive and therefore worth trying."
"Overall an average Stout...not bad...a good beer, not that expensive either. I just was expecting a little more."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 2 inch khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Nice distinct rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, and slight coffee beans. Taste is of dark roasted malt and dark fruits. There is a bit of an alcohol taste present too. Mild roast bitterness on the palate after each sip. A lower level of carbonation makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel but slightly flat. Overall, this is a pretty good RIS coming from Lagunitas, especially for the price."
"D: Lagunitas rarely disappoints. Including today. A well brewed stout, fantastic drinkability."
"Overall: Simply too sweet, too thin, not much roasted character and a bad aftertaste. Obviously, I think this is a sub-par Imperial Stout."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a fairly high amount of carbonation for the style. Drinakbility is alright, even if the sweetness is just a bit grating. Overall, this was a pretty alright RIS. For the cost, it's a great brew, but spending just a bit more on some Old Raspy would probably be a good idea. It's still a pretty good brew though, just not as good as the average RIS."
"Pours dark with head that comes and goes quick. Very carbonated. I am assuming a 2011 bottling as the label reads 9.9% abv and ibu @ 72.45. Does not taste like a high abv stout. Just a good average stout that happens to have a high abv. Toasted notes, almost burnt, really come out in this. However the price point, $3.69 on sale for a 24, makes it very good buy that I would do again. Overall not bad but not at the point where I gotta buy a bunch to put into the fridge."
"O - Overall, for $3.99 this is a pretty decent brew. It isn't my favorite for the style, but not bad either. I may revisit this again in the future."
"A dark reddish brown with a tan head and light lacing. Slightly sticky on the glass. Smell is a rich blend of chocolate, cherries, molasses, mocha, vanilla and roasted grains. Taste follows suit with a nice coffee bitterness in the finish. Some brown bread and a hint of earthy hops gives and English aspect to the brew. Feel is akin to a frothy, creamy hot chocolate. Nice. A heavy gravity gives it a lovely girth while the carbonation is excellent. A solid RIS at a great price from a brewer that may give the best value for your dollar anywhere. Cheers"
"Notes: This full-bodied sipper has loads of flavor, complexity, and mouthfeel. Despite it's ABV, it's not overpowering. Another solid effort by the folks at Lagunitas. A tasty brew indeed."
"Pours a black color w/ a very thin chocolate head w/ disappears immediately. Below average lacing and carbonation. Smell is pretty weak for this style, with roasted malt, coffee and chocolate the only things I can distinguish. A little thin on the taste, and the smells are all there. A little better on the taste than the nose, but not among the best in this category. Also a little thin on the feel. All in all a fairly average Russian Imperial Stout. Probably won't pick this one up again, but glad I got to try it."
"O - no life changing beer here, but not a bad go to for 4 or 5 bucks a bomber. barely qualifies as an imperial stout, but quite drinkable. Is it better aged? I'll probably never find out."
"O: This is a pretty good stout, but nothing special going on here. Usually I'd like a certain quality to stand out in a stout, and this one just has great balance, so I'm not partial to it. Still, a very good brew."
"Overall I am glad I picked up a second because this beer drinks fantastic. Kind of a nice change from all the chocolate and coffee bitterness to get more dark sweet fruits. Worth a try if you like the style."
"Kinda thin and weak for a stout. This brew truly suffers from an identity crisis, as it shares many more qualities with Gulden Draak than other stouts. Not the greatest by any stretch, but a helluva bargain for $4."
"Overall pretty meh."
"The mouthfeel is medium for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a very drinkable and flavorful stout. The hops really mixed with the stout flavors better than most versions that try and do that. Overall though it just fell short of the best versions of the style. It felt to thin and light without enough roasty, bitter character to it. Pretty decent beer overall but not an exceptional one."
"O - Very avaerage. Below average from a brewery as highly regarded as Lagunitas and I really wanted to like this one. In all fairness, they promote their FOE-tay as hops which they obviously do much better."
"In other words, I recommend the hell out of it, but if you're an avowed fan of the style (as I am) you'll still find yourself thinking of those uinque experiences other, greater beers have bestowed."
"O-This didn't knock my socks off, but it was a good beer that I enjoyed. Good value for the price (Think I paid $4.50 for a bomber). It didn't look or smell particularly impressive (slightly above average) but the taste was good. A more luxurious mouthfeel would really add to my enjoyment of this beer"
"BARGAIN ALERT! I assume it is like this in other places, but I can pick a bomber bottle of this up for less than 4 bucks. It admittedly isn't the best Imperial Stout in the world, but is nonetheless rock solid. It pours jet black with a thin tan head due to the elevated ABV. The nose is dominated by chocolate, coffee and a tinge of alcohol. The mouth is a little thinner than I'd like, but it is slightly oily and definitely not weak. The taste is robust with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and some darker fruits - maybe cherries. It's a very decent stout, and you get a lot of bang for your buck."
"Taste is fermented prunes and dark toast and otherwise only a nice, but faint, chocolaty creaminess and an alcoholic bite at the finish. It has a good feel with a nice slightly oily/creamy feel that is not too oily or heavy – creamy rather than slick or viscous. Despite the alcoholic bite at the end, it is otherwise not too alcoholic or boozy but it also is rather bland and one-dimensional. It’s good, easy to drink, but rather dull and boring, esp. for what it is and the high ABV."
"O. Not one that I'd buy again. On a purely personal level this one's a bit too sweet for me - I prefer a drier stout although I know sweetness is the norm for a RIS. On a style level I find this one lacking in several areas. I can't find any definition to it. It's missing all those roasted malt notes of coffee and chocolate and there's too much fruitiness. It's almost like an alcoholic Vimto."
"Overall: I definitely didn't want to bash this beer, and in fact was expecting to like it quite a bit. I've never disliked a beer from Lagunitas as much as this, although Hairy Eyeball comes close. There is nothing necessarily offensive about this beer, but it definitely doesn't deserve even an average rating. Bummer."
"Second thought (after it warmed): The beer tended to thicken up a bit, the mouthfeel improved, and the roasted malts overcame the coffee tastes to forefront. After warming, a few esters came thought adding another dimension to the beer."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink because for the most part the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Poured the entire bomber into a 28-oz Minnesota Renaissance Festival ceramic goblet. I easily kicked up a huge pillowy, thick-appearing, khaki-tan head that would have easily cushioned and supported coins dropped from above. Unfortunately however this was the pinnacle of this brew. Smell was weakly of watered-coffee and burnt molasses. Taste was mildy hoppy with an odd combination of barleywine style dark fruits..raisins, plums with stout-like coffee and chocolate. Summary : A bit too sweet, light bodied, and all over the place. Disappointing."
"A very different RIS, more dark fruit oriented than coffee roastiness. Berkshire brewing RIS is very similar which i did not like. That being said, this is more sucessful than that beer, even thought i probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Overall, I was not expecting much as I was not overly impressed with some of Lagunitas' other offerings, but this is one nice Russian Imperial Stout and I will be buying more of these, you should too. Enjoy!!!"
"not the darkest of the dark or most complex imperial stout but tasty and enjoyable nonetheless"
"My Lagunitas Imperial Stout was labelled 9.6% rather than 8.2%. It poured with dark brown colour and a 4 mm head that fades to decent lacing. The smell is roasty malt and also a bunch of hoppiness. The flavour is like a dark chocolate milkshake to begin with and has a bitter slightly hoppy finish. This is a very nice imperial stout, but it's not exceptional."
"overall: Very tasty, drinkable and satisfying."
"Nice to see a pretty good stout for less than a king's ransom. Recommended."
"Bottle has 10.14% abv., not the 8.2 as noted above. A thin black stout with a minimal head. The nose was first licorice followed by the roasted malts. The taste is well balanced. The malts are prevelant, coffee and espresso, and the hoppiness finishes the beer. The high abv is noticed in the stomach as a warm feeling washes over you. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Overall, a solid beer that is rather easy to drink. Not like a lot of other Imp. stouts, well balanced with subtle various flavors."
"O- Pretty good stout if you like them sweet, but I like the drier varieties. Might try it again, but I'd normally opt for another."
"overall, a decent beer, would be a regular with a richer mouthfeel and perhaps a more complex flavor profile. a tremendous value, and a decent brew, so one I would drink again. pretty easy drinking, and very little noticeable alcohol."
"This is a lovely stout that I'm sure will get more love as the years roll by. At least it's here for us while Stone wraps up its obnoxious Belgo phase."
"DB- A light end Imperial Stout with probably the least roasty/rich profile I have experienced from a good brewery. Drinks pretty well but not what I expect out of the style."
"Hard to explain. Still a decent IS from Lagunitas."
"D: fairly high given the abv, however given the overall richness I cant be above a 4.0"
"Notes: I don't think there are many Imperial Stouts in this price range, and probably not many quite as good. As usual Lagunitas hits it out of the park for the price range, just like their Hop Stoopid ale."
"I expect RISs to be over-the-top with their flavors and very heavy. Lagunitas' RIS does not have those characteristics but that does not detract from it. It is much more drinkable than most RISs yet doesn't feel ""light"" or have that watery characteristic to it that some poor porters and stouts have. Overall the beer isn't too complex but it has plenty of flavor and is well-balanced. And at a little over $5 a 22oz. bottle, there's little you can say about this beer to lessen it. If you want a quality RIS with good flavor, balance, and drinkability then pick this up."
"D: Little heavy to be in the regular rotation, but perfect for the odd cold night."
"Finger plus of very dark brown foam, somewhat loose with more than a few islands of larger bubbles frothing up and popping away under the surface, lacing much slicker than expected, barely registers on the way down the glass sides. The liquid isn't really black, more like the darkest possible brown this side of black, razor thin aura of orange at the glass bottom. The nose is all about rich, milky chocolate, cocoa, vanilla fudge and caramel with a candied orange infusion, no substantial roast nor toast, just sweetness which also infects/infuses any hoppy pine, herb nuances, blindfolded you would think you were in a Hershey's factory. Full-bodied, softly contoured and expansive in the mouth, close to sloppy bear hug status. Cola, licorice and a lighter orange reduction swirled into the milk chocolate and caramel foundation. Carbonation is average to slightly below. Follows the nose with a good punch of pine and green matter, the hops sinewy and active under all the malts. That said, this is definitely a stout built for visceral pleasure above striving for either complexity or sheer brute power. Earns its place at that table, simplicity is not always an insult."
"D: Not a bad beer but defiantly nowhere near the top of this list in its category."
"I really enjoy this stout. The perfect companion to a cold winter night."
"Lagunitas always puts out a quality brew, and this is no different. I'm surprised by the ""B" rating it has; one could do much worse than this RIS - especially when you consider this sells at $5 for the bottle."
"D- No alc. Easy to drink, well rounded, not filling. A great IRS at a awesome price."
"Poured into a Duvel Tulip. Pitch black with little beige colored head. Probably would have given it higher marks on the appearance but the head was pretty unremarkable. The nose is pretty boozy, coffee, dark fruit, maybe a little bit of port or sherry quality. The taste is more bitter coffee and chocolate than the booze that I got from the nose. High carbonation for a Imp. Stout. Overall a really tasty RIS and for $4.89 for a bomber you can't go wrong. I wonder what a year or two will do to it. Also, this version is marked at 10% ABV."
"Another bargain from Lagunitas. At the equivalent of about $8.75~ a 4pack, this beer easily competes with North Coast Old Rasputin and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in terms of bang for the buck (actually, I far prefer Black Chocolate Stout, but they're very different animals; Lagunitas could easily be the best of the 3 for any given drinker). Yeah, it's a little thin and not too complex, but the flavors are very bold and very good. If I saw this beer more often, I would definitely buy it again."
"This excellent brew pours as dark as the ace of spades with a diminutive head that dissipates quickly. The nose soars with the aroma of, well, a Mr. Goodbar chocolate confection. Yes generous aromas of milk and slightly sweetened chocolate along with salty peanuts gain your attention immediately! Not distracting to the experiance but nicely reminiscent of this ageless product. Lightly carbonated and well hopped under the thick layers of chocolate, malt syrup and marshmallow, the alcohol just peeks itself above the ceiling threshold of this well saturated and flavorful brew. Like most of Lagunitas products, this too is well made, well balanced and an absolute pleasure to consume."
"D - Interesting take on an Imperial Stout, I am usually a hop head, but I feel the hops took away from this beer. I look forward to trying it again in the future to see if my opinion stays the same."
"Medium mouth feel, great taste but somewhat low on drinkability due to the alcohol. This newer bottle is 10.14 abv."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: meh. Though I'm a big proponent of them, I think Lagunitas missed their mark with this one. It has a funky smell and taste that I just can't shake."
"D- Fairly drinkable."
"Overall very impressive and a great deal. No idea what age this bottle was"
"This beer may have changed since its introduction. The ABV is higher than that now reported on Beer Advocate."
"This beer pours a dark brown, to a lighter black. I actually expected it to be darker due to the 'imperial' tag. Nonetheless, the dark yellow-brownish head didn't stick around and lacing was not well formed. It smelled typical of a stout, with chocolate, coffee and malts. Taste was much the same, with stronger chocolate taking front stage. Sweet malts were also present. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy and was heavier than the appearance suggested. Easy enough to drink, but nothing that sets it apart from the other 'imperial' stouts out there, kind of in the ""B" or AA league, not bad though."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer as a nightcap. Enough alcohol to warm you a bit before bed time in January. And at 5 bucks for a 22 oz. bottle it's a pretty good buy. But a session beer, it def ain't."
"D - Maybe I've been missing out on the stouts that are like this one... or this one is in its own league. Either way, it is good but it is not what I know to be a stout. Consider me educated. Try it, just be prepared for a different stout."
"Drinkability: A solid example of the style and a flavorful sipper that hides the high ABV of a RIS well."
"Really enjoyed this beer, especially at $4.99/22oz. This brewery can't seem to miss."
"D: This was a bit on the sweet side for an imperial stout, but still pleasant and drinkable. A good effort from Lagunitas."
"This is worthy overall, but not my idea of bad-ass. This would be interesting with a butt-ton of late addition hops and cask-conditioned."
"I first tried this imperial stout earlier this summer. The beer that we had at that time was 8.2%. After a long dry spell, the beer is finally back in Alberta. Now clocking in at 10.14% I can't even remember what the 8.2% version tasted like. Considering the strength of the beer I was expecting something a little thicker and a little darker. The beer has a thin head and is a very dark brown color opposed to athe jet black color of other stouts I've tasted along the same lines. This beer dose however have a very pleasent smell and taste. The bitter aftertaste dosn't stay on my palate very long. Somewhat of a disapointment. I would have prefered something a little less dry with a stronger, longer lasting bitter aftertaste. The beer is very thin, goes down fairly easy. This one has a beautiful taste, not the best. But certainly not the worst. A worthy purchase and a great beer"
"My bottle looks exactly the same as this one except mine says its 10.14%ABV anyway it pours a rich dark non see through cola hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a thick two finger creamy head and nice lacing its abit thin looking for a RIS but netherless it looks nice,the aroma is abit of a let down considering how nice it looks with hints of milky mocha and bourbon and cola,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel which isnt as thick as i usually like my RIS's and exudes flavours of milky coffee,milky chocolate,caramel malts and finishes with a nice toasty hop bitterness,overall its not bad without being great and i can think of alot other beers from this brewery that id rather revisit."
"Color is very dark, almost black, with significant carbonation. Flavor and aroma was a combination of roast, toast, hops and a little bit of fruitiness. Overall, very well balanced in all areas and very easy to drink...maybe too easy. I will get this again and would recommend it to anyone who likes Imperial Stouts."
"D: OK. 22 oz was good."
"D: this beer is big and rich while being an incredible value (3.99 per bomber). I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable sweet imperial stout."
"Overall: Overall I enjoyed the beer. I thought flavor was great with a nice balance of sweet to bitter. I would definitly recommend this to dark beer drinkers. It might be too heavy for some IPA lovers out there."
"D- not my first choice for a RIS, but its not really undrinkable...just a little boring. Not very complex"
"This one is pretty impressive."
"Drinkable: despite the gravity, this is my session stout when I am out of big city jamaican, as long as I have eaten well that day. Food really makes the bad points of this beer disappear. i recommend pairing with food. Drink at your own risk."
"This brew may also have improved. The current ABV is pegged at 10.14%, it's listed as 8.2% on this site. The recipe may have changed producing a better RIS."
"D - the odd taste that I am calling prune would keep me from having it too often, but I would consider it any time that I see it."
"Bomber from WF nyc Bowery location poured into tulip glass. Smell is misleading that the chocolate malt is going to pour through. Not the case, tastes like simple syrup is slightly smoked and maybe a hint of dark cocoa. Mouthfeel is chalky and sweet which with the abv makes for a low drinkability for an imperial stout. Lagunitas' weaker showing in my opinion, should stick to hoppy ales and the Tumbler, Torpedo, and IPA are great."
"Verdict: Fantastic robust stout. Worth tracking down."
"Booziness brings down drinkability, definitely one you take your time with, and would only want a couple of."
"Drinkablity- very easy to drink and enjoyable, nothing super super complex but still really great solid example of the style which has nothing be ashamed of and i believe overall a bit underated on here, great value too, def worth a shot and one ill try again"
"2010 Version. 10.14% ABV. Pours an extremely dark brown. When held up to light it has a red hue to it. Medium tan head. Scent is roasted malt with lots of chocolate. I get a bit of nuttiness and dark fruit scents as well. Also candy sugar and alcohol. Taste to me is like a more boozy Peche Mortel. Although the coffee is not as stand-out as Peche Mortel (the alcohol takes up the lack of coffee flavor), there are a lot of similar features (mouthfeel as well). The chocolate and nuttiness along with the coffee make this a very tasty brew. As it warms, the alcohol makes itself more noticeable. The mouthfeel is not as thick as I was expecting, or hoping for... but still good. The drinkability is as high fairly high for an American Imperial Stout."
"One finger light tan head, quick dissipation, with minimal lacing on top of dark brown body with some garnet highlights. Nose is quite sweet, licorice, molasses. Taste features a good chocolate dose but not a lot of hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium full, oggd effervescence, not sticky despite overt sweetness. Not real drinkable at this point, may benefit from some cellaring."
"I don't know if I'd rate this a top tier stout but it is definitely an easy drinker. I almost want to call it stout training wheels as it is smooth and flavorful yet it doesn't favor any one flavor profile to make it more appealing to a certain palate. Lots for everyone in this one."
"overall a very nicely made imperial stout."
"Bottle: Poured a medium black color stout with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of coffee is dominating with some roasted malt also noticeable. Taste is a nice mix between some coffee and black chocolate from roasted malt with light vinous notes and dry raisin appearing as the beer warms. Body is a bit thin but has a creamy texture which I appreciate. Not bad overall and akin to a session imperial stout if such a thing can exist."
"The drink is very high and is actually a fav imperial stout of mine, lagunitas remains a stellar brewery always"
"Beer is medium in body and leads off with a strong sweetness that is followed by a growing and dark roast bitterness at the back of the mouth. Its coffee and mildly milk chocolate like. Its smooth in the palate and overall pretty good. Not sure what makes this an RIS but its a good imperial stout."
"D: Again, very smooth and enjoyable, I'll certainly be finishing the second half of this bottle."
"T- Pretty approachable for an RIS. Raisin and fig are light along with milk chocolate and weak coffee. A little bit of smoke as well. Mostly its all dark malts showing off."
"Reviewed on: 08-05-2010 22:01"
"D - This stuff is pretty much amazing. I absolutely loved it, and was quite impressed by this offering. Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me, and this one ranks up there with the rest of them! Highly recommended to any stout fan, and a wonderful digestif to any meal!"
"D: Overall a tasty drink. Very well balanced for the alcohol content. Will definitely have this one again."
"D - very impressed, the flavour are so tasty, and the feel smooth enough that you wouldn't guess it is an imperial, although there is just a little kick to remind you. Well done!"
"A: Deep brown to borderline black, some sticky spots of foam around the interior of the glass, thin layer of dense head over the surface of the glass, medium viscosity - 4.00, S: Dark roast, thick syrupy sweetness, molasses and golden raisins, slight alcohol burn present on the nose, rum infused chocolate cake, pretty hearty and intense nose - 3.50, T: Thick, semi-sweet chocolate, some prunes and raisins, espresso and quite a bit of charring, hop bite is noticeable but kind of lost in all the thick malts - 3.75, M: very smooth and velvety mouth feel - 4.50, D: A solid Imperial stout, quite drinkable - 3.50"
"Nose is singularly of sweet malty molassesy goodness. Flavor backs up the nose with caramel-y and coffee undertones with a bit of a dry finish. Generally a thicker beer especially as it warms up."
"At about $5 for a bomber, it is a good value."
"D - After drinking some of the beer, the alcohol starts to take effect and you don't feel the burn as much anymore, making this a very drinkable beer. Before that though, it was only moderately drinkable, the actual flavor masking the alcohol only slightly."
"$4.99 for a bomber, at Beverage World in Peekskill, NY. Read a bunch of older reviews, they are all over the place...pours darkest shades of mahogany, with ruby glimmers around the edges. dark tan, minor head, thick film, clinging collar and spots of globby lace. mild nose of some chocolate and dark malts. Mouth feel is a wee bit light IMHO for the style. Notes of more chocolate,, dusty dark malts, chalky dryness. Dry Impy, on the lighter side of the style all the way around. Flavorful, but lacking the real depth of flavors of the heavy hitters of the style."
"D: Not bad at all! I will get another."
"A decent Imperial Stout, though not quite on par with Lagunitas' Hop Stoopid and Lucky 13 Mondo Large Red Ale."
"Conclusion: All in all, this is a good stout. The smell of the brew was fairly strong. There's not much going on in this brew."
"Decent Imperial Stout, but not one of the best."
"Notes: Hmmm, it´s a nice Lagunitas offering, not a top tier bur still pretty fair. Funny how they seem to have done this trick around the mouthfeel being balanced by alcohol or extra carbonation in some other brews, it does not happen in their better brews but still works nicely."
"D: A somewhat unimpressive imperial stout which seems more constructed around its 8.2% ABV and clever story on the label than the complexity of the brew. Not a bad stout, but the spicy, floral fruitiness tarnished the semisweet after dinner sipper I was hoping for. i'll reach for the Cappuccino Stout next time."
"D - I could drink this all night, the crisp carbonation is quite refreshing and the fruityness of this one makes for a highly drinkable stout."
"Pours black with dark brown edges, thin tan head, not much lace. Smell: dark brown sugar, mild roasted note, a little date, in the background green spicy and leafy hops with a touch of alcohol. Taste: dark brown sugar, medium roast, greenish earthy and spicy hops. A rather drinkable and laidback, but not particularly complex RIS."
"Overall, a pretty mediocre Imperial Stout. Fairly disappointing, as the Cappuccino Stout is much more pleasing. Too boozy and with little comparitive complexity to match, this is perhaps one of the biggest let-downs I've had from Lagunitas. But at a relatively low price of just over four dollars, this bomber is a decent deal as far as Imperial Stouts go."
"Not a deeply complex or layered RIS, but certainly enough to be enjoyable. Not astringent, it does drink pretty well for abv that isn't exactly covered."
"Overall, I enjoyed this RIS. It isn't one of the best of the style, but it is still really good. For its price $4.99 a bomber it is a really good deal and I could see myself drinking this again."
"This is my first official Imperial Stout and even though I don't have anything to compare this to (yet), I find this particular beer to be plesant. I would drink this again and I'm also looking forward to some of the other Imperial Stouts that have graded higher than this example."
"I'm having this side by side with a another imperial stout that I've long enjoyed. Pours a very dark brown with a small brown head. It's neither as dark nor as foamy as others of its style. It has all the aromas, flavors, and complexity one expects from imperial stouts, but a major hindrance to my fully enjoying this beer was the obvious presence of alcohol on both the nose and palate. Overall not bad but not great."
"Nope, despite the almost sensible ABV for an imperial stout, this is no impish stout. I should have never doubted Lagunitas, as they seem to excel when it comes to the big stuff."
"Outside of a few hop bombs, I just can't get into any Lagunitas brews, the hop bombs are even a stretch."
"I have had some good offering from Lagunitas and was hoping for more than this beer delivered. a bit dissapointed. This beer is a bit boring"
"A fair amount of chocolate is present, as is a ceratain roasted malt quality, not as strong as I would like to see, but definately there. Very smooth and easy to drink, not nearly thick, and substantial enough for the style, but very pleasant and drinkable."
"D: A fine stout with a sweet body but a nice leafy bite in the end. Drinkable now for certain. I am a little worried that this won't hold up with time, but that won't stop me trying. Another excellent brew at an exceptional price from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: A great drinking stout by any means, although the mouthfeel can use some work, the overall presence of flavors in the beer make this an easy sipper. The coffee and chocolate in the aroma is spot on, and that slight touch of booze makes this a nice brew to enjoy a some chocolate dessert or even a good cigar. Not a stand-out stout but one to definetley try."
"worth trying but not the best beer this brewer offers, and for the price you could buy a better stout."
"*=Ideas from fellow taster"
"Feels a bit thin and watery. Smooth, without much carbonation. Easy enough to drink but not my favorite winter evening brew."
"D-it is a lighter imperial stout and extremely sweet. my idea of drinkability is wanting to drink it in terms of its style so the rating isn't great. still not a bad beer and is somewhat enjoyable."
"Decent beer, nothing to write home about. Good price though for 22 oz. Just lacking some elements."
"One of the less impressive RISs I've had, though it's certainly not a bad beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick and a little gritty. Pretty drinkable, but I think the sweetness would get to me after a while."
"From a bomber- vintage unknown. Pours a ruby hue dark brown with a fizzy mocha head. Nose- light roast, some molasses and anise. Taste- stewed fruits followed by a chocolate powder dryness. Lacking depth, rather thin body. Minimal roast flavour. High carbonation for the style. Drinkability is decent given the relative simplicity of the brew."
"Poured a dark brown with a modest head that quickly dissipated to a collar. The aroma was molasses. The taste was vanilla and molasses, no coffee to be found. The feel was medium bodied with good adequate carbonation. Drinkability was good. I was outside the bell curve on this one, I liked it. Lagunitas, not exactly known for their dark malt beers, more for the hoppy stuff, but they did a fine job on this one IMO."
"Other comments: Definitely IMPERIAL. Potent and thick. This is what people who only drink light beer probably think all stouts are like: strong, thick, and heavy."
"This one pours a very dark, opaque black with amber hues in the light. The head is thin which results in a thin ring of off white bubbles on the edge. The smell is very sweet with almost no roasted malts, hops or any defining scent that would make this an RIS. The taste is the same unfortunately. Its a little boozy with mostly chocolate syrup with a hint of sweet and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is alright but is a little thin and oily. Drinkability is low due to the cloying sweetness and weak body."
"Overall, an alright brew. A little bland and a touch too straightforward for what is usually an exciting style."
"C-/D+"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is good, not much lacing at all. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit and Whoppers malted milk balls candy. It's a very sweet and malty aroma. However, it tastes like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and smoke. It doesn't taste as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Luckily I still think it tastes good. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems a bit thin for a stout, and it also has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a decent overall brew, I enjoyed it."
"I would definitely seek this one out again or recommend, not a top of the line RIS, but it's extremely easy drinking and should be respected."
"Overall: Not what I expect from a stout, but totally worth drinking. As far as I can tell, there has always been a gray line between porters and stouts. This beer leans towards the former yet it's flavour passes as the latter. Odd, enjoyable. The focus here is dark malts with medial - minimal bitterness."
"Conclusion: Nice, solid, decently complex, good value"
"D: Very easy to drink, due to a good balance of flavor and not being super thick. This is not a heavy handed brew, but tasty enough to make me buy it again. A different twist on the style."
"D- eh."
"4.0 D: I like it and I'm not a stout guy."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, I wasn't expecting much from this beer but was surprised to find that it was a pretty good stout to drink for a while."
"Drinkability: This stuff if really good. I'll drink it again."
"Overall a very malty and uninspiring stout."
"The beer pours the expected darkish brown color with good head retetion and lacing. The nose is pretty exocitic, consisting milk chocolate, prunes, stewed plums and sweet licorice. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except the plum and prune flavor really come on strong. The beer is a bit on the sweet side, with a soft, medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good, though the sweetness and noticeable alcohol detract a bit. Still, this is a pretty nice, easy to appreciate stout from Lagunitas. While nothing spectacular, it's a nice enough beer."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into matching shaker glasses. Split with psycohops. The stout appears a dark brown color with about two fingers of fluffy, but quickly fading ecru foam. Smells and tastes of medium roasted grain, milk chocolate, mild coffee notes, a hint of caramel and vanilla, whopper candies. Barely medium in body with a decent amount of carbonation. Not bad, but it's just missing something."
"Pours pitch black completely opaque. A frothy, bubbly one-finger head tops the beer. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. First sip is quite bitter with dark, dark chocolate and coffee leading he way. There is a ton of tobacco here and it is quite hoppy for the style. Lightly bodied too."
"Lagunitas Imperial Stout pours black in color with very little head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is a bit of roastiness in the aroma. The flavor has a bit of roastiness too, but more of a toffee or caramel like flavor. The alcohol is noticeable to me. Not bad, worth a try."
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Ive tried so many RIS's now, why not just go for the rest? Pours a very dark brown, approaching black. Looks a bit thin for the style. Short light brown head retained well. Smells of chocolate, alcohol, nuts and plums. Flavor is of dark chocolate truffles, with hints of coffee, decadent chocolate covered black cherries, rich like pudding. Ethanol on finish. Medium to full bodied, velvety mouthfeel. Very tasty, grows on me as i drink more. Definitely on the fruiter end of the RIS spectrum, which wins points from me."
"all in all, a decent stout with a bit of funk, but a pretty mediocre RIS. It falls into the same category of other odd stouts (which Lagunitas seems to have a propensity for)... not quite what they set out for, but not necessarily horrible. I finished it and wasn't disappointed, but I certainly wasn't wowd. A decent cocoa licorice stout, but a weak RIS."
"I was given a bomber of this as a birthday gift. Decanted into a brandy snifter. Appearance is an oily black with brown edges. A small layer of brown foam that sticks around the whole time. Strong mocha aromas, with hints of bitter chocolate and burnt toast. Flavors are fairly mild for an Imperial Stout. Definite dark roasted coffee, with a coffee bitterness that blooms on the middle of the tongue. Light chocolatey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little too watery for an Imperial Stout. Overall, definitely drinkable, and not a bad beer by any stretch, but it's just not as big and bold as I like my stouts."
"D: I never thought that I would say ""Lagunitas"" and ""no thanks"" in the same sentence"
"I do quite enjoy Lagunitas' version of the style, as it is more laid back, and drinkable than many of its colleagues (but still nice and warming). I poured the last third of the bomber into my slowly simmering Irish stew, and expect that it will have a similar positive effect on tomorrow's holiday (in my mind, anyway) dinner party."
"D - This did not live up to my expectations as a RIS, but it was a good beer, and a good example. But, since it is not available here, I won't be looking for it again"
"This is a nice stout, but not a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"D - Not stellar, but good. Moderately drinkable, but hard to get through alot of."
"Tastes like it'd go well with a cigar."
"22oz bottle $5. Not black surprisingly, dark brown and transparent red when held to the light. Smells like dark grains and tootsie rolls, sweet. The flavor is more tootsie rolls (I get this from imperial stouts sometimes) and a creamy graininess. The mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking but this beer was worth the money I spent on it."
"OK, so its not with par to what your typical super RIS would be. If you remove the labeling of Imperial stout and take a stab at what ya think...it's like their Brown Shugga with a nudge of extra roasty stuff throw in."
"This poured an opaque mahogany with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like lots of bitter chocolate with roasted coffee and a bit of licorice and alcohol. It tasted very dry and earthy like burnt coffee and bitter chocolate with some soy and molasses. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was good but not great. The flavor wasn't as delicious as I hoped, and the body wasn't as big. It was still clean and pretty easy to drink, but it just needed more sweetness. Oatmeal could have really helped balance the flavor; I'm not sure if age could."
"D: Now I bought an Imperial Stout and this is more of a chocolate stout if you'd ask me. If it were called that it's be quite good!"
"Drinkability- Heavy enough flavor and high ABV enough to slow you down. Unfortunately, not a great example of the style or a good representative of Lagunitas beers."
"The parade of stouts continues, Lagunitas' offering reminds me somewhat of Samuel Smith's, i.e. more of a drinkable stout than a sipper (even though it is quite strong). Pretty good and a good value beer."
"D- This is a good beer, but I'm kind of confused with some to the characteristics. Barleywine? RIS? Wee Heavy? I just don't know. I'd drink this beer again, but I'm not going to be actively seeking it out. Cheers!"
"Overall, a good beer, but definitely not a great beer. I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered another, but I probably wouldn't purchase another."
"D: good drinkability with wide range of flavor keeps things intersting til the end."
"Unexpected was definitely the theme of the day on this one. Sometimes unexpected is good; this time, not so much. By far my least favorite Lagunitas brew I've tried so far."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice notes of chocolate/toffee/coffee. The taste is sweet, malty, with some chocolate, toffee, coffee. Medium body, the alcohol is very well hidden. Drinkable, this is a very tasty RIS."
"On the palate I like the soft, rich and silky mouthfeel that unloads a whallop of coffee, cream caramel flavors with a nice astringent, dry bite towards the end. Hops are barely noticeable and so is the high alcohol level. All-in-all a nice beer, but the nose is a little subpar and not as complex as I would have liked it."
"Overall this is a good deal (~$3.70), but if you're looking for a very good Imp Stout keep looking."
"This may not belong in the RIS style, but it's a tasty and enjoyable brew nonetheless."
"Imperial Stout needs a bumper-to-bumper overhaul and needs it right now. It's tempting to assume that this bottle isn't representative, but it looks like this offering is near the bottom for Lagunitas when sorted by overall score. Yikes, this is bad."
"Dark brown with a reddish hue, clear and not quit opaque. A two finger cap off the pour settled quickly to a solid, light tan collar and skim of fine bubbles covering the top of the beer. Sticky lacing. Malty aroma, mild roast character with sweetness, toasty and chocolate. Thin flavour for an imperial stout. Quite sweet overall with caramel throughout, some chocolate notes, but not much in the way of burnt or roast character (just a hint in the finish). Mild to moderate bitterness. A little brown sugar and nuttiness lingered on the palate. A little more than medium bodied with average carbonation. Definitely lacking the bold complexity I expect from an imperial stout."
"Pours a surprisingly clear deep brown with intense ruby highlights. The appearance has me a little concerned right off the bat when expecting a bit more depth and darkness from an RIS. The head created a slight and quickly disappearing layer of beige head. The aroma, although slightly roasted, also concerns me before I take my first sip. The slight diacytel and all malt smells immediately remind me of a dopplebock and not an RIS. Coming from Lagunitas, I was anticipating the always-present hop punch, but that was nowhere to be found. The taste follows suit on the dopplebock. A slightly buttery and metallic taste seems far from a stout and confuses my mental palate. There seems to be very little that resembles an RIS. I am not an advocate of style guidelines at all, but this one just doesn't fit the bill for me. Lagunitas has never failed me and I consider them to be one of the best West Coast brewers that have kept it real on the price gouging of other brewers. They have earned a great reputation, but this one is a definite miss. I LOVE a good RIS, but this one is a bit tough to put down. Besides, I didn't even get to reuse the bomber for homebrewing (twist off) :("
"Pours a brownish body with a one-finger tan head that stayed around for awhile and left a lace ring. Good whiff of some chocolate and roasted malts, as well as some coffee and sweet malts. Medium-bodied but a little thinnish for an Imperial Stout, the ABV is hidden well and it is more of a sweet and smooth malt taste with less dryness on the backbite than most heavy stouts. Still, the coffee and roasted malts make their presence felt along with the sweetness. A good beer all the way around, although not my first pick if I'm looking for a real heavy imperial stout."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as bad as I think the score suggests it should be, but certainly not the best RIS I've ever had. It's a lighter one, with a few fruity off notes, and I know Lagunitas's quality control isn't as good as it should be (I got a good bottle), but I really didn't think this one was terrible. There may have been a few light, lower molecular weight fruity esters from over-active yeasties, but still, this was a decent beer. The alcohol was largely well-hidden, the malt profile was decent and balanced ... hell, give it a shot."
"A smooth, semi-sweet easy drinking Impy Stout. Does not exactly fit the ""Russian IS"" category, but it does taste very good. I will be buying this again. Another fine offering from Lah-Goo-Knee-Tuss."
"D- this was alot better than i was expecting. the other offerings i have had from lagunitas have been good for bargin brews, but nothing too special. this one is something ill try to search out again. very happy for the opportunity to try it."
"A second bottle 5 months later came up nearly the same except for the mouthfeel. The body was weak and watery for an Imp. stout, more like a brown ale. I'm hoping this was an aberration but have knocked the mouthfeel score down from 5 to average the two scores."
"Have to say that this is not a RIS, or if it is really considered one, it is a very weak one."
"The beer isn't bad on its own, but it suffers from the competitive nature of the style. If you're going to do a RIS, you better go all out and get it right."
"Pours an oblique color, not much head or lacing. Tastes of coffee, toffee, and chocolate. Very appealing. Nice hoppy action, also on the back half. A bit thin in the mouthfeel, but full of kick. Nice price and I think if aged longer, this will be a great one."
"Still a bargain for the $2.99 I paid for the bomber."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin for an RIS. Not light like a dry stout, but not the chewy viscosity that I'm used to. Good tasting, but overall a bit of a weak slap for an RIS"
"Aroma is strong, of roast (not burned) coffee with an undertone of unsweetened chocolate. It pours a dark mahogany with a thick tan head. The flavor does not measure up to the aroma's promise, being about average for a stout and having less smokiness and chocolatiness than the aroma, but is still palatable and pleasing, and has a definite hoppy tone. Texture is smooth and a teensy bit thin for a stout. Worth a try nevertheless."
"D - nice, and rich, but really easy going down. 8.2% is hard to believe."
"The price won't set you back much if you give this a try, but I'll be reaching for something different next time."
"M/D: Thin side of full bodied, slightly fizzy, no hint of alcohol. It's a drinkable beer, but it only scratches the surface of what a RIS is and can be. Very average in every way."
"Drinkability: Average for the style. There really isn't anything to make it stand out. Still quite drinkable but you can do better."
"The 8.2% alcohol doesn't really make much of an appearance, so this went down real easy. An OK Impy Stout, but I doubt I would seek it out again."
"Pours a dark brown with a frothy head. Looks pretty bubbly. Smells sweet with not much alcohol in the nose. Taste is pretty underwhelming. Some coffee and roasted malts come out but not much else. Everything about this beer is pretty average. I don't think I'll pick up another one."
"D - it's different, and it's drinkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" brown head over the clear dark reddish mahogany brew. Foamy head lasts well, and laces nicely. Aroma is heavy on the dark grains, with maybe a touch of dark fruitiness, no alcohol noted. Taste follows the nose almost exactly. Way off base here on the style, almost more like a schwarzbier. Mouthfeel and drinkability are reasonable, but the label is so misleading per the style it is disappointing. Worth checking out as a brew, but stay away if you're looking for an imperial stout."
"I was not impressed at all with this beer and felt it just lacked in all important areas. I had had an ale just previous to this but I do not feel that the previous beer inhibited this review. I will probably not try this again."
"Disappointing."
"This one falls on the lighter side of the Russian Imperial Stout category. Fairly easy to drink for an RIS."
"Drinkable, and flavorful; near perfect, just lacking a big punch. Another winner from Lagunitas. It didnt bring home the championship like my beloved Eagles, but it is a stellar beer nonetheless."
"This is a lemon in every way. The Edsel of the Lagunitas line. It entirely lacks the features of other entries in its class."
"Overall I really like this beer. It is near perfect other than the head problems I had. It may have been my own fault for trying to pour all 22 ounces into a snifter that was not meant for that. Other than that, this beer is on my A list."
"D: Not drinkable for me - too rich. I'm going to have the fiance make it into bread."
"22oz bomber into a Duvel snifter. Pours a deep black with a frothy tan head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is some roasted malts and slight chocolate. The taste is a decent blend of roasted malts, espresso, bitter cocoa and some molasses and dried fruits. The beer is slightly heavy bodied with warming alcohol, still somewhat smooth. This is a decent Imperial Stout."
"D -This is a flavorful RIS and very affordable."
"D- Very drinkable, the alcohol isn't over-powering."
"Good body, and drinkable for sure. Really maybe a good one to start with if venturing into this style for the first time. I won't go back to it though."
"Good beer, but was expecting a little more from the style."
"I need more power!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's not really true to the style, but it is better for not being so. Why be like all the rest. This is a unique brew, worth your attention."
"Geesh, all I can say is this is dissapointing. Very thin and watery and lacking any substance, depth, or complexity. An odd hop flavor on the finish leaves a chalky bitterness that makes you think ""why""? Dark chocolate with less fruit than apparent in the nose. Some alcohol in the chest. Lagu guys should consider a change in recipe on this one."
"A very drinkable high gravity stout. At 3.99 a 22, I will be getting more of this soon, which is no surprise since Lagunitas is quickly becoming one of my very favorite breweries."
"Served in an Imperial Pint glass. Poured an opaque dark brown with red highlights. Half-inch coffee-colored head dispersed rather quickly, leaving a thin skim of beer foam. Scent of chocolate malt and dark fruit (reminded me a little bit of the 2006 Killer Penguin I had last week), with a hint of espresso. Taste similar to nose, with the coffee more pronounced and the dark fruit much less so; however, for an RIS, flavor and complexity was somewhat lacking. Effervescent mouthfeel, but lacking a bit in body. Not quite watery, but not as full as I would anticipate with the style. Alcohol was well-hidden, making the brew fairly drinkable, but if you are looking for an RIS this one is a bit on the weak side."
"D: Lagunitas just didn't get this one right. I'd probably never even think of this brew again."
"D: Interesting. I wouldn't label this a RIS, as the body, alcohol and malt depth isn't near the level of any RIS I'm used to. Yet it is a tasty beer, alcohol is well hidden. Not a great RIS, but a nice beer. It's just mis-labeled I believe."
"Overall a nice beer I'll revisit."
"D - ok; I've had better Lagunitas but this is good and hitting the spot since it's oh so cold outside. Would perhaps order again, though not sure I'd buy another bottle."
"D: one a day would be an understatement from this beer. i manage a bar and i have drank at least four cases in the past 2-3 months(which lowered my paycheck, but it was well worth it). any beer, from lagunitas, is absolutely 100% phenomenal!"
"Drinkability is low, my least favorite Lagunitas to date. Took me a good 1.5 hrs of letting this thing sit and warm up and it barely got any better...luckily, it was only $4!"
"D - since it wasn't very special, I was not too excited about it, so I gave it a low drinkability. No problem enjoying it, just not anything to get excited about. Last night I had Stone Ruination IPA, so perhaps I'm a bit spoiled."
"very little hop character. lagunitas doesn't make a belgian ale, but if it did i might suspect that this bottle had been mislabeled. no joke. must have fermented very warm. my scores reflect this despite the fact that it wasn't a poor drink. that is to say, i enjoyed drinking it but an RIS that acts like a strong dark belgian is just wierd"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It seems too light and thin for your typical imperial stout. Carbonation is good. It is smooth and drinkable. It's far being a bad beer, but I've had much better from Lagunitas."
"This beer is really a little disappointing. I like a lot of Lagunitas brews but this one doesn't measure up."
"Pours a very dark brown with red highlights, but not the black one expects from a stout, especially an imperial stout. Small tan head leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is black malt and green apples (acetylaldehyde). Flavor is sweet dark malt, without the warmth one would expect from a beer of 8%. Body is medium but the beer goes down very smooth and creamy. Tail is all black malt and chocolate."
"Aged a bit, at Volo. Black with a moderate head and significant lacing. Malty medium roasty,a bit of burnt sugar, nutty. Coffee aftertaste. On the sweeter side with toffee and sugar offset by sure bitterness. Overcarbonated, a sipper. Complex and rewarding."
"Pours a somewhat translucent black with some ruby undertones. A small tan head leaves minimal lacing. The smell is rather subdued with not much more then roasted malts to talk about. Much of the flavor is roasted malts, with hints of coffee, and fairly well balanced by some bittering hops and no alcohol to speak of. This is very thin for a RIS, but between the light mouth feel and well balanced flavor it becomes quite drinkable."
"Though I would hardly call this a Russian Imperial Stout it is a pleasant enough beer. Seems almost more like a porter to me. Enjoyed drinking this but expect much much more from an RIS."
"D: For a RIS this is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is hardly noticeable. On the other hand when I reach for a RIS I expect something thicker and to be more of s sipper. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad beer but I expect more from Lagunitas. It was on the cheap side so pick it up and give it a try especially if you are new to a Russian Imperial Stout."
"I bought this as a mistake, I had heard this was a less than spectacular beer, but in my excitement at a really good beer store I accidentally grabbed this one. This is not an outstanding RIS, or even a really good one, but it isn't necessarily bad. Kind of an oddball, it doesn't remind me of any other beer. Certainly not the best offering from Lagunitas, but enough of a curiousity to try at least once."
"Normally an RIS packs a punch, but this one doesn't. I don't want to take off too many points because it still tastes good, with moderate complexity, it's just toned down. It still has the same characterisitcs as an RIS, such as the deep bitter malt with molasses aromas, a bit of chocolate in the flavor, maybe the hops come up short. It's recommended, as long as you're not expecting a full bodied, ultra-bitter, thick, RIS."
"22oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a dark black color that looks dark brown when held up to the light with a really nice light tan head that has good retention and leaves an impressive amount of lacing. The aroma is definitely on the faint side for an Russian Imperial Stout. The aroma features dark roasted malts, cocoa and coffee. The taste is dark roasted malts with a bitter and slightly alcoholic finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent RIS, but it lacks the bold and aggressive flavors that I enjoy in some of the better examples. Nonetheless, it is still recommended."
"D: One of the selling points of this brew. Easy to put back, and hard to tell it's 8+ % ABV."
"The Imperial Stout poured as it should dark as night with no head at all. I did not see a freshness date on the bottle. The smell was of roasted malts but couldn't get much else from it. The flavor was average and it tasted good but there didn't seem to be much going on. It had a creaminess to it. In the mouth is was thinner than I like my Imperial stouts."
"22 oz bomber into tulip glass. A: Lighter than I expected, very dark brown, some fluffy head that doesn't stay around very long. Lacing is pretty short lived as well. S: Darker malts, grains, some grassy hops, some cocoa. Smells like a porter to me. Alcohol present. T: Surprisingly light. Pretty bitter up front, the hops are surprisingly present. Some coffee and cocoa flavors, vague citrus flavors toward the finish. D: I'm not well versed in the style, but it seems a tad thin to me. I'm actually having trouble finding things to say about it, the flavor isn't terribly deep. But still, it's very drinkable, and I wouldn't get the abv to be as high as it is. A surprising beer, but good."
"Freakishly offbeat for an Imperial. Incredibly effervescent, light enough to make it register as a porter in my mind. Ive read a lot reviews saying rum, but to me this is more woody that the spiciness I associate with that alcohol. I actually like the mouthfeel, but doesn't fit in to my imperial stout preferences (neither chalky like Dragonslayer nor oily like Old Rasputin). Pleasantly odd."
"The taste follows the trail left by my nose. Notes of dark fruits, chocolate, a bit of coffee. The malts are the key to this RIS. This is wonderfully drinkable. The alcohol starts to come through in a warming fashion as the beer reach's room temperature."
"Overall: This one was a pretty big let down which may have led to me being slightly over critical. I have really liked all the previous Laguintas offerings and had high hopes for this one. The taste and aroma are lacking and it is just too thin for an RIS. I will just put this one behind me and look forward to the next Lagunitas offering."
"So I had actually had this one sitting around for quite a while but I never got around to trying it for one reason or another, but with the onset of the cold weather upon us, I figured now was the time to give it a shot. Poured a deep dark brown, essentially black with a large tan colored head. Nice slow retention left behind copious amounts of side lace. Smell was full of roasted coffee, chocolate, and an almost Brandy like aroma. Very thick with a bit of a sweet note to it. The taste followed along almost exactly. Very full bodied, rich and creamy feel let you really enjoy the bold dominating flavors of dark chocolate and coffee and the long finish helped you find some of the more subtle hints of a hoppy finish. Just the smallest touch of an alcohol warming, but nothing that really took you over. Overall this was an excellent sipper, really had the dessert, or late night feel to it. An excellent big stout, very complex and nice and full. I liked this one a lot and would say it was definitely worth a shot."
"D - Bleh. I don't even want the rest of the bomber. Maybe my roommate wants it . . ."
"Overall a drinkable beer just simple overall. Good price for what you get I think."
"Pours a dark brown, with some dark garnet and amber hues, with a decent cream colored head. Not exactly the color you would expect from a RIS, normally a pitch black. Aroma is of chocolate, maple syrup, roasted malt, and a touch of hops. Taste is more like a brown ale with a touch of roasted, perhaps burnt malt on the finish. This is like a big brown, although even if this was classified as a brown, I've still had better. Not quite an RIS or a stout in my opinion. Not bad but mislabeled."
"In summary, it I think that for those who love to taste the hops, this will be an ok beer. If you're looking for more complexity, keep looking."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice chocolate and black roasted barley scent that is toastey with some residual sweetness. The taste is good as well. It has a rich, black malt flavor that is warm with a thick, roasted feel. It does have a little chocolate malt in there providing a bit of sweetness to balance the earthy patent malt. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's rich and flavorful; a fine IS."
"My only major complaint is that this is a bit on the watery side. For an Imperial Stout, it sure is a bit weak. A bit more body would make this excellent. As is, it is bordering on sessionable...."
"D- I enjoy the drinking of this beer but the taste didn't quite do it for my. Much too one sided with the cocoa without really any complexity that might follow from that."
"Smooth and a bit buttery for a stout. Not the typical chewy dry stout. Nice thickness, very nice consistency. Smooth, balanced bitter at the end. Delicious actually."
"reasonably smooth but thin. drinkable but otherwise underwhelming."
"As a general stout, ""eh"". As a Russian Imperial, way too bureaucractic. I expected more."
"D - A pretty well balanced, standard stout...but for an Imperial, I was expecting something inkier, heavier, and more complex than just your standard caramel twang."
"D: Compared with the many fine examples of Russian Imperial Stout out there, this lags well behind. Aromas and flavor are decent enough but mouthfeel really fails to match the robustness expected. The look of the beer also belies it's thinness. Despite the fact I've liked other beers from Lagunitas, I probably wouldn't get this again."
"Notes: If you told me this was an American Stout or even an Oatmeal Stout, this would have scored much higher. I actually enjoyed this beer quite a lot, but it surprised me -- it doesn't seem to have the characteristics that I associate with an Imperial Stout -- at all. There's no noticeable alcohol, no charcoal flavors, licorice or large body. The score reflects that failure to meet style expectations, but doesn't necessarily reflect my overall enjoyment of this beer. It was a solid stout, just not the big stout I was expecting."
"The beer pours black with a thick and creamy, light tan head. The foam fades, but never really disappears, and leaves thin lace sheets that cover the side of the glass. Held to the light, the liquid appears deep red. The smell has toasted grain, some chocolate, prunes, and a bit os smoke. Taste is nice, with a good flavor of roasted malt, sweet plums and raisins, just enough bitterness at the end. 8.2% alcohol well hidden with no burn or hotness. Might be just a touch thin in the mouthfell for such a big beer. Very good, but now that I have had other RISs to compare it too, it's rank is just a bit lower than others."
"Pours black with a slight head that fades all too readily. Smell is a little faint as well,but is a fairly balanced sweetness and roastiness with cleam lightly toated maltand a touch of chocolate. The taste is surprisingly light and very creamy. Milk chocolate, light roastiness, and an eggcream finish. Very creamy mouthfeel and restrained carbonation. Pretty drinkable- very smooth,but could use some more depth and complexity.Very pleasant, though."
"A very approachable example of the style. Drinkable in that it isn't huge and doesn't feel like an end-of-the-night beer. It's still pretty big and flavorful but not over-the-top."
"Overall a pretty poor example of the style. Lots of caramel flavors and aromas but devoid of any coffee or chocolate flavors or aromas. Mostly just a malt ladden beer with a nice mouthfeel and good drinkabiltiy due to the low (relatively) abv. Pass on this one for impy stouts and get something else."
"Drinkability: A reasonably tasty stout that falls short of the RIS category; a bit more like a Baltic Porter than a stout, frankly"
"Body was a smidgen thin, but it held the 8% back quite well, I knew it was more that 5%, but thats what I perceived from this great brew."
"Serving Type: 650 ml (1pt 6oz) bottle poured into Leffe glass."
"Flavor is taken down a notch by a weak body, but this is more than drinkable. A good but uneven RIS. Maybe it could some aging...I dunno."
"Drinkability: not a bad RIS, but this did not really excite me overall. Worth a try but one bottle is more than enough in a drinking session."
"A 22oz bottle, no date. It was a dark brown, with a small head. A chocolate, coffee aroma. Mostly coffee taste, with a little chocolate detectable. I thought this beer was way too timid and thin for a Russian Imperial Stout: not one I'd want to try again."
"D - Not a bad overall beer, just more of a thin sweet milk stout."
"An overall solid IS with good drinkability, but could use a little more body and carbonation."
"D: Eh, I expected more from Lagunitas. A bit too thin of a mouthfeel for an impy stout. Flavors were there, but quite subdued. Not bursting like the style should be."
"All and all, a disappointing Impy."
"Served at about room temperature, in a pint glass. Poured a very dark brown which turned black in the glass. Had about a half inch of tannish colored head that had little retention. Left virtually no lace on the glass. Smelled of burnt coffee, and some chocolatey notes. Very faint aromas coming from the glass. Taste wasn't really there either. Some malty, coffee, milk chocolate , and charcoal like flavors. Seems more like a milk stout to me than a Russian Imperial Stout. Very thin and watery in the mouth with no pop. Very little carbonation . Doesn't have that almost chewy feel like alot of other RIS's. Pretty drinkable but nothing interesting here.."
"I will be stocking up, oh yes..."
"I found the name ""Imperial Stout"" a bit misleading. If you open this expecting a big, bold RIS then you'll certainly be disappointed. However, you will find a solid, easy-drinking stout."
"Overall it doesn't have the big bold flavors of most Imperial stouts, but easy to drink and decent."
"I didn't rank this strictly to style because it would come up short. It's a well-crafted brew that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Bomber. Nearly black in color (garnet on the edges) with a nice tan head that lasted for a while and left big chunks of lacing. Nose is mostly chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is a lttle light for a stout, but still not bad. There is a touch of sweetnes, and quite a bit of hops showing through the dark malts. A good stout, although a little lightweight for an Imperial Stout."
"This would be a very solid dark lager. Very mild and drinkable with a smooth chocolate character. However, this is a terribly dissapointing RIS. I have been impressed with the other offerings from Lagunitas. What happened here? I've had porters with much more robust and complex flavor (Fuller's London Porter for example). This isn't a terrible beer but it is way off from the style..."
"Still a worthy purchase, however. Just don't expect a ""traditional"" RIS."
"too sweet for my personal taste, not bad but there are much better RIS' out there, for the money Bear Republic slays this. I can't call this ""bad"" by any stretch but it is very very average. pick up the cappucino stout instead, you'll thank me."
"Nice creamy, half inch, light-brown head that fully diminished, fast. Aroma is dark chocolate and strong coffee. Moderately sweet initial flavor. The texture was a bit of a dissapointment; it was quite thin and watery. This beer is listed to 72.45 IBUs. It certainly didn't smell or taste like that. Overal, this is not a bad impy stout, but not great either."
"I WILL SAY THIS: clean clear booze flavor, very classy and nice. leaves a pleasant aftertaste. the numbers I gave this beer, may seem low. but thats because I did not like it. I like it better than new castle."
"A limpy four-year old."
"The body isn't big enough for a stout; it reminds me more of a prickly tasting porter. It is too sweet for my taste, and the mouthfeel is a bit boring. I expect more from a beer in this category. It wasn't exactly horrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"The taste became less harsh and more subtle as the beer warmed, but the carbonation was too high and abrasive on the palate when it should have been smooth and silky."
"No bite to this, kind of watery feeling really. Not bad flavor, just weaker and more watery than I was expecting."
"As many have stated before, this is a stretch to put in the RIS category, and in my mind, it is barely in the American Stout category, closer to a porter in my book. But, that being said, it is still a good beer, and worth drinking, but not worth driving out of your way in search of the almighty Lagunitas Imperial Stout. Upon pouring I immediately noticed the dark brown with reddish tints, and not a jet black color, and the head just never devolped like I was expecting, about one finger, nicely tan, and lasted about a third of the drink. No lacing whatsoever. Aromas were nicely sweet, dried fruits and chocolate. Taste was good, with a nice rich malty flavor that focused on toasted grains and chocolate. Not much hop bitterness, but a little to balance the malts. Mouthfeel was decent, kind of thin and not at all RIS-like. Overall a good beer, worth drinking and the alcohol was masked very well. But if you want a kick you in the ass RIS, go elsewhere."
"Pours dark brown,with tiny head and thin lace. Smells coarse and grainy, with coffee malts, fusel alcohol. Weak in flavor. Thin grains up front; segues quickly into alcohol and toasted bread finish. Light-to-medium body, a bit high in carbonation and low in creaminess. Nothing wrong with it, but rather undistinguished overall."
"The feel is thin, but the 8.2 % ABV makes it a bit more easily drinkable than some of the heavy RIS."
"Drinkability: This is my take: Certainly drinkable and fairly tasty, but this isn't really what I'd consider an ""Imperial"" Stout. One thing did jump out at me right from the get-go - the well-hidden 8.2%."
"This is my first sampling of anything from Lagunitas. I am reviewing this beer at approximately 20C (68F). It was easily the lightest coloured RIS I have ever seen. It was still dark, but light could easily pass through it. An aggressive pour yielded a khaki coloured foamy head the should have been the result of a standard pour. Plenty of hops in the nose, with moderate malt and nuances of coffee beans. I like the reverse to be true with my RIS's, quite honestly. Taste is citrusy bitter hops up front, with a dry roasted malt making itself noticeable several seconds after the sip is swallowed. Mouthfeel is very thin for the style. Overall, I'm a bit dissappointed in this."
"The smell of the beer was light as well, with grassy and spicy hops, and sweet toffee. Not much roasted coffee or chocolate on the nose. The taste was clean, sweet, and lightly roasty, with tinge of acidity. In other words, it was near dead on for a Baltic Porter, and way too light to be a Stout. Thin and sticky mouthfeel was Porter-ish too, and the slight but noticeable hop bitterness wiped the palette clean after each sip. This was a remarkably easy to drink beer, considering the 8.2% ABV. Not the Imperial Stout to go for, when you are in the mood for a heavy nightcap."
"This is easily a highly drinkable and easily consumed beer. I commend Lagunitas for having created something as wonderfully tasty as this. Thanks!"
"D: This is a very light Imperial Stout. Fans of big beers like Stone will probably be disapointed, but this would be a good place to start for those new to the style (as I am). Not great, but drinkable and something I might get when I'm in the mood for a stout, but not in the mood for a big kick in the mouth."
"D: Even at 8.2%, this is very drinkable with a smooth sweet finish that yields hints of roasted malt."
"A bit lighter than I'd like to see in terms of body color. The first pour out of the bomber had no head at all. The second had a nice solid finger's worth. Reminds me more of cola than stout. Nose is mostly milky chocolate and alcohol. Taste is the same but with a tart sourness in the finish. Weird that Lagunitas makes so many good beers but can't get the style right here. I'm honestly surprised. Mouth is too thin for a stout. Won't be buying this again. Spend a lonely penny down a well and wish for a better beer."
"Medium-full body, low carbonation. Very smooth, mabye too much so. Alcohol is hidden very well, I almost wonder if it's really there. Only negative is, it really doesn't seem much like an imperial stout. Maybe a nice porter, or a very, very mild stout, but an imperial stout ??? I think not. It's really not a bad beer, and I wouldn't mind having another, just doesn't fit the style...at all."
"Overall, a damned drinkable RIS, and at the relatively low price at which my nearest supermarket is offering it, I should think I should often find myself drinking this beer. That is, were this not a bloody hot late-spring/early-summer. Move this release to winter, and I might choose to live off this stuff through the cold months..."
"Shared this 22oz bomber with some friends the other night, and I was totally impressed. Imperial Stouts are my thing, and I usually like them black as night with tons of chocolate overtones...but this one's a little bit different. It has a serious toffee, coffee, caramel nose and flavors to go with that as well. It pours brown with not too much head, and the finish is a little on the hoppy side, but that's what they're known for. Excellent version of an Imperial Stout. I was impressed!"
"Over all found this a very enjoyable Imperial Stout."
"Drinkability is ok for a beer not an Impy Stout again, who knows what they were thinking with this one."
"Overall: Sadly, this beer gets many points off for being completely out of style. This is a specialty beer - an imperial milk/sweet stout. I really like this beer, and it is a fantastic dessert beer, but it does not live up to the imperial stout name."
"Drinkability and Overall: Call it an imperial rauchbier and I love it. Call it an imperial stout, and I'll call you a liar. All I can taste is the smokiness. I'm reviewing by style here. If we drop styles and focus on how it tastes, this is a pretty decent brew."
"I know what this beer is. An imperial Milk/Sweet stout. this would go great paired with some chocolate."
"TMD. At 8.2 goes down exceptionally easy. Not very think, not very warming either. Altoghter not a bad beer, but at 4.99 a bomber, I'll pass next time."
"877"
"Ehh, this one was just ok. I could tell just after pouring that this beer was a tad thin for a stout. Not that everything within the style needs to be pitch black, but this was fairly easily seen through, with shades of red. Smell and taste fall just a bit short of interesting. A little too sugary sweet, not enough bitterness, and no real complexity. Definately a bit watery in the mouthfeel. I've had some good beers by this brewery for sure, but this one didn't hold my interest."
"I like this offering from Lagunitas."
"Pours a watery, lifeless dark brown colour, with a small, short lasting head. If you're expecting a full bodied, thick creamy and smooth stout, look elsewhere. What I had after the pour was a light bodied, somewhat watery stout, more reminiscent of a porter. Not much in the nose - some roastedness and coffee. Taste had some roastedness, hop bitterness, chocolate, some tartness, and some dark fruitiness. Overall, not a very good imperial stout."
"Pours black ruby in color with a tall foamy tan head that coats the walls of the glass with sticky lace as it dissipates. Nose is dark chocolaty malt but is a bit subdued. Taste begins with sweet roasted malts and fresh coffee followed by some notes of cocoa and mildly spicy hops. A decent enough beer but it seems rather reserved and subdued for an imperial stout in my opinion."
"A surprisingly tasty beer. i wasn't crazy about my first experience with Lagunitas, but this is pleasantly yummy. This is what an 8% abv session imperial stout tastes like. A perfect compliment for a rick desert or just something to sip while relaxing. A great beer."
"Here comes the big downfall of this beer: it's so thin in the mouth. Too much fizz on the tongue, to boot. I'm not surprised as to why this is a summer seasonal. Although the mouthfeel is lacking, it's thinness and flavor characters help make this a pretty drinkable brew. Not bad."
"Overall the beer is very easy to drink and tasty, I wish it were darker in color and a little thicker to be an ""imperial"" stout, but it is a tasty brew none the less."
"For a stout, it is up there with others while being uncomplicated. Not too filling so you could have it with a meal without getting bloated. I don't love stouts but I like what Lagunitas has done."
"Black color with only a little deep ruby red showing against the light, with almost nonexistent head. Smells like a porter with the roastiness and the coffee. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, bitter roasted (burnt?) malts, mocha, dark fruit. Mouthfeel is good and smooth but body should be thicker. Finishes dry. Very good beer, but again, wrong category."
"D- This is a very smooth soft drinking stout. I really expected quite a bigger bunch from a double stout. These flavors are really under-developed and subtle. Its quite amazing that this smooth beer is a 8.2 % ABV."
"The slight watery/syrupy texture is a turn off for me other than that this is a good drinking Stout maybe better on tap."
"Current CD: Jake Mandell - Love Songs For Machines"
"Poured the typical black colour with a tan head. Taste is a little too sweet and mouthfeel is a little too thin. Despite having an ABV of just over 8%, the alcohol is not really detectable. Its not necessarily a bad beer, but I've certainly had better tasting stouts."
"Thin mouthfeel, especially for the style. Light. Decent carbonation. Sweet aftertaste. Very mild and easy to drink (but not in a way that makes me want another). This seems mislabeled, and I am surprisingly dissapointed. Overall the best way for me to describe Lagunitas Imperial Stout is with one word....subdued."
"Drinkability- Lets just put it this way....I really did like this beer. Just not as an imperial stout. If they had some kind of imperial milk stout, or better yet a doppelmilk stout, this would get some pretty damn good ratings. For imperial it doesn't do it for me. Lots of better options out there. However, for a nice change of pace stout, pick this one up. It's very tasty...in a non-imperial stout kinda way."
"Opinion: Well, I remember really liking this beer last year, but now I think that it needs a bit of improvement. I have one of these from last year, so I would like to try them side-by-side. This beer seems to have a lot heavier water in it or something. Still not a bad beer, but it would be hard to put it up beside an Old Rasputin."
"This is a very drinkable Impy Stout, not the best I've tried, but good nonetheless."
"(Postscript(AKA--after reviewing and then reading the other reviews)) Yes, I have to go against the ""BA Grain"" on this one. I guess it is all about personal taste, but I seriously cannot think why so many rated this so lowly. Oh well, it does not affect my rating or my review: the fact remains that I enjoyed this beer immensely."
"pours dark and thin into me trusty snifter, creating a bit of whitish head that quickly settles down to a little lace around the edge. nearly opaque, but definitely lighter than most imperials upon close inspection. this russian's aroma has apparantly been suppresed by the state, leaving only a dubious suggestion of roastiness. as for taste, a paltry, almost nonexistent start gives way to a blunt, dry, displeasurable bitterness. it's somewhat reminiscent of a corner store chocolate popsicle: vaguely suggestive of what could be, but utterly unconvincing in its own right. mouthfeel is thin and watery, though not actively objectionable if i can distract myself from the taste. drinkability gets low marks because, having had other imperial stouts, i do not want this in my mouth."
"Light defying black in the glass, nice mocha cap, modest carbonation. Nice looking Impie so far. Nose is subdued, not as face smashing as most imps but the standard aromas are there figs, coffee, sweet treacle. Nice mix of malts you get lots of burnt toffee, molassass, cocoa, dried fruits and charred toast here...hops are trimmed back but thats OK...long malty finish of sweet date cake and metal tinniness...very nice...this is a drinkable imperial...very drinkable...in fact dangerously drinkable!"
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades slowly but doesn't leave much lace. Deep mahogeny color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is chocolate but not strong. Starts sweet, malts are up front, finish is a roasted coffee. $5.45 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma"
"Notes: It could have more stout but it was decent. The lace stuck to the side of the glass from start to finish. All in all it was decent but not what I was hoping for in an imperial stout."
"The color is deep, dark brown, almost black. Head is tall, creamy, and light-brown. Retention is very good, there was still a nice layer of foam left in the bottom of the glass after I had finished my pint. Aroma is mediocre, not-so-rich milk chocolate smell is joined by a very, very mild roastiness. The taste is primarily a moderately rich chocolate flavor with a little coffee thrown in amongst a mild roastiness. Taste is very good, however this isn't as rich and full-bodied as I would expect a double stout to be. This seems more like a more powerful sweet stout or something along those lines. Drinkability is very good, this would probably work as a good introductory beer for stronger stouts."
"This is very likely the last Lagunitas I'll EVER buy: they are just a consistent disappointment, for style, and for overall drinking, that I regret it every time I buy one. The only I think is worth a damn is the Brown Shugga, and even that is only a middling product in its style. In fact, I have to wonder if this ""imperial stout"" is an accident of the Brown Shugga brewing, where they tossed in a pound too much grain for their corporate quality control to let it leave the factory, but their market department through they could do something with it."
"Pours a near black but with some crimsone hue showing thru near the bottem of my glass with a big fluffy almond colored head,aromas of rum and butter are dominant with some light nuttiness in there as well.Like others who have reviewed this I also think the body is real watery for an imperial stout,it has good flavors for the style lots of rum and butter with a nice big earthy finish but the mouthfeel keeps the flavors from really kickin ass.Iam glad I tried this and its not all bad but man that is a thin beer for an impy stout for sure."
"I usually love everything Lagunitas does, but this one comes off a bit formulaic.. eh, with such stiff competition in stouts I don't think I would go for this one again."
"D - Very light and too easy for an imperial stout. I am torn. I want to give it a higher rating for the skill by which they made this beer with such high alcohol, yet made it so easy to drink."
"This was OK, but not worth it at over $4 for a bomber (in MA). I won't be getting it again. With Victory Storm King on the market this doesn't stand a chance. I'd also recommend Rasputin."
"Maybe it's not the most life-altering mind-bending (guess we're calling it an ""American double stout"" these days) but I appreciate that it shows a bit of restraint. It's easy to just keep piling in the OG, but I'm glad to have a beer that I can drink easily."
"Lagunitas is a fearless and innovative brewery and should be respected as such, but this one just didn't work. Tasty, but wrong."
"Mocha, corpulent head that dies quickly to a fungal covering. Not black but closed, deep red hue on the claret side. Which surorises for the style  expected inkiness. Malty jam with a sweet port fullness in nose that reminds me of a barleywine. The oak char touches to taste are almost overwhelmed by the sweet vermouth maltiness and raisin puckering on mouth. For an imperial, this one is closer to being a court jester."
"Slides down quite easily despite its strong alcohol content."
"Clear, almost black, well, it might be black in the middle, around the edges the liquid is shiny ruby-brown. The color is nice, for a Stout Id like to see a darker beer. The head was loud and fizzy, it was beige in color, and it looked like soda. Sadly the head made a lot of noise but it failed to hold well, in fact there was nothing left in a moment. This is disappointing. There was no subsequent lacing. The first sniff of the nose said Milk Stout. Is this an Imperial Milk Stout or just a sissy Imperial Stout? Im thinking the latter. Lightly roasted with kisses of cocoa and some coffee. Light herbal hop notes. Man, the nose is sad. Sure there is nothing bad about the bouquet but where is the big roasted qualities? BA labels this as a Double American Stout, so where are the hops, where is the alcohol? Where is anything that says, Im a big fucking beer! The nose is not inviting, it is not offensive but it is boring. The palate is dull; this is more of a Sweet Stout than anything else. This beer is mislabeled. The palate has sweetness throughout; there is light acidity, kisses of char, some chocolate, and some coffee too. None of the aforementioned flavors are loud. This beer is not tasty. Where is the 8.2% abv? Where are the burnt qualities? Where are the hops? Hello? Mr. Bitterness are you there? *Dead Air* The middle is empty, the finish is sweet and almost cloying. This beer is annoying me. What is the point of this beer? I fail to see one. I like nothing more than mediocre beer parading as something special. Unlimited Release that is too bad, this puppy should be shot like Old Yeller. Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation, the mouthfeel is warm and slick. Not Big Stout-like. The aftertaste is the strongest aspect of this beer; it is warm, mildly fruity with a kiss of hops. But this fails to save this beer. Drink with cheesecake or dont drink it at all. Seriously. It is not an Imperial Stout and it is a very average bigger Milk Stout. Find an alternative. Im very disappointed that I purchased this beer on-line from Liquid Solutions. I selected it because I wanted a couple beers from Langunitas but they were out of the others and I substituted, I should have dropped this beer while I was at it. Live and learn. I cannot recommend this beer."
"from the ottle poured deep mahogany with brown head. aroma, cocoa, chocolate, molasses, dark cherries, malts, honey, alcohol, floral, coffee. flavor bitter sweet chocolate, cherry juice, grapes, hints of honeyhints of alcohol. dry mouth feel. all flavors were on the weak side"
"Enough though! Time to get down to the beer. Pours out an inky black with a thin creamy tan head with minimal retention. Held up to the light this imperial stout takes on a red cola hue. Not very impressive. The nose is sweet and boozy, small hints of roasted malt, a whiff of cocoa, and then back to boozy sweet. The flavour starts out with almost a cloying sweetness, coating the palate with a sugary film. It lingers until the finish, where a touch of roasted malt and chocolate make small cameo appearances, and some coffee lingers on the aftertaste. All the action seems to happen after the show, you feel like you ended up eating dessert first, ruining your palate for the surf n' turf to follow, even the salad bar. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, no real body to it. What am I drinking again? Mommy, this can't be an Imperial stout, can it? However, on the flip side, with the sweetness and small touches of chocolate and coffee, this would make an okay dessert beer in small quantities. Pour it into stemware, and get everyone else to help you finish off the bottle. They never have to know the real story. Hmmm, for the price of one of these imported bad boys I don't think I'll be partaking again. A word to the wise: never trust an Imperial Stout with the Soviet emblem on it, it's a sure sign that it's a fake!"
"Bottle. Just too sweet and milky, all the action was happening at the front of the palate, a bit metallic like some of their other beers. Too sweet. I shared the bottle with 3 other people and it was a bit of a struggle to get through at times. Just a bit to sweet, not a good impy stout."
"As said in some of the other reviews, this is hardly an Imperial Stout. But...it's not a bad stout, so I am being a bit middle of the road in my review. Pours a dark chocolate brown with ample head and decent lacing. Smell is burnt malt and light chocolate. Flavor is about the same. with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is light for the abv. I wonder if the abv is accurate. Easy on the drinkability scale. If you like regular stout...worth a try."
"Notes: The logo has the word ""Imperial"" in massive letters across the label. I have been misled. This is not as imperial as I thought it would be. As someone has said before, this would be a good beginner's Imperial Stout. As for someone looking for something challenging and exemplary of the style would be advised to pass this one up."
"This beer pours a deep brown to black with definite ruby highlights. A light tan colored head gives way to virtually no lace as the beer settles. The aroma has a licorice character followed quickly by chocolate malt. No real hops to detect in the nose. More licorice, and chocolate malt when I taste the beer, a little alcohol heat, and something else. Man I almost swear its chicory or something of that nature. This beer is thinner than I expected. Ive been recently turned on to some great Imperial Stouts, and one of the things Ive begun to expect is a rich, velvety mouth feel. This beer isnt close. Its decent, and drinkable, but not a great representation of the style."
"Pours a deep opaque black color with a large frothy white head that leaves no lace. The aroma on this beer just smelled putrid: a mix between sweaty oats, slight roasted malts, and some lactic acid tones. At first I thought this brew just may be contaminated but after tasting and checking some other reviews this seems to follow most peoples opinions. Aromas start off sweet with hints of dark fruits and just a touch of roasted malt. The body to this brew is super thin which is adds to my dissapointment. There is almost no bitterness throughout, but there are tones of light coffee and cocoa in the mix. The finish consists of a strong lactic acid taste to it... Overall this is a really bad attempt at a milk stout.. This is no way in hell an imperial stout, so don't be fooled by the label.. Overall this beer is truly a dissapointment for the brewery, considering I absolutely love brown shugga and maximus.. Hopefully someone will inform them as to what an imperial stout is supposed to taste like.."
"Pours a very dark color with a moderate head that doesn't stick around long, but leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma has a lot of chocolate malts in it, but that's about it - very enjoyable, but subdued. The flavor is all about the chocolate with just a hint of coffee/roasted flavor. Finish is slightly bitter and the body is thick and creamy. Extremely easy to drink for the alcohol level."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with 2 fingers of head that falls to coat over the beer. The nose is rather subdued, with some chocolate coming through, but not much else. The flavor is full chocolate with the slightest coffee finish, that may be in my head. Nice flavor. The feel is moderate, with a very slight creamyness. Drinkability is really nice. For a beer at 8.2%, the alcohol is not even on the radar. Damn. Nice beer,"
"Comments - This beer is worth a try, but it can be improved upon. Compare it side-to-side with other imperial stouts to assist yourself in picking out aroma and flavor differences."
"Good brew, but not exceptional for the style."
"The finish is not as dry as I would like, and the taste doesn't stay with you like in other beers of the style. I respect this beer, but don't know if I will pick it over another Imperial again."
"Pours out with a light to medium brownish head that settles over clear deep chocolatey brown liquid...not the darkest Imp.Stout I've seen. Deep malty nose with complex dark fruitiness and some chocolate notes and not much hop. A thinnish (for the style) mouthfeel offers flavors of light chocolate, subtle roasted grains, light fruitiness and abundant hoppiness. No sign of alcohol here, quite drinkable with a nice latent bitter roastiness. Finishes pleasingly bittersweet. I'd say this makes a decent Baltic Porter, but a poor Imperial Stout, speaking strictly style-wise."
"Very unusual all around, but none the less, enjoyable."
"I'm a fan of most of Lagunitas' beers, but this lacks complexity. It's really nothing more than a stronger typical American stout."
"The taste was fairly simple, and great. Smooth chocolate and coffee but not as bitter as you'd expect. It had a thinner body than the bottled variety, and was dangerously easy to drink. It was good on cask, but didn't really shine like I'd expected it to."
"Mmmm....chocolate.... Light chocolate nose with a dark chocolate taste. Fat tan head that disappeared in about 20 seconds, deep brown with just a hint of red hiding in the darkness. Not a very complex beer (though a well-balanced one), tastes like semi-sweet chocolate and not much else, has a bit of roasted coffee aftertaste though. I disbelieve the 8.2 ABV. Pretty tasty stuff if you're in the mood for chocolate, but doesn't quite measure up to what I expect of an Imperial stout."
"Pours out dark brown/black into my snifter. Not too much of a head to it. Smell is the usual for an Imperial Stout, lots of chocolate hints with coffee; not very intense though. Taste is OK, not well defined and a little bitter for the style. The well defined flavors of other Imperial Stouts just wasn't there; what I was left with was a brew that tasted a heck of a lot more like a porter. Too many other unbelievable brews in this category for me to seek this one out again.."
"I love most of Lagunitas beers, and I can't say I am disappointed in this one. Maybe not traditional ""Imperial"" by most means, but a very nice Stout nonetheless."
"Appearance: Dark caramel brown thin tan head leaves specks of lacing. Aroma: Relatively bland lacks much of anything but mild chocolate tones from this one. Taste: Once again where's the imperialness this doesn't like a big stout of Russian decent that I have come to know and love. Dulled down chocolate, wood herbal finish weak flavors watery in a sense what the fuck. Mouthfeel: Medium to thin for an imperial stout pass on this one. Drinkability: I have tasted many Imperial Stouts this one is lacking in every department after falling in love with a couple Lagunitas brews I picked up this one, disappointment."
"Very dark opeque black/ruby color. 1/8 inch light tan head that settled quite quickly. Not much nose at all just a touch of roasty malt sweetness but it is faint. Roast malt taste but it is very light and there is a slight hop sharpness to the finish. Seems a little weak and watery in the mouth and in the taste. Its ok but that is about it... not one I would seek out."
"Coming up somewhat short of being an imperial makes it pretty drinkable."
"Quite a nice drinkable stout..though its odd with this much alcohol..there is no real Imperial taste..I liked it though and would consider buying again."
"There is little roastiness or abundant flavor to speak of here. Any balance that is achieved is defined by its absences, not its imperial richness. This is not a bad beer per se, but I certainly would not present it to the Czarist Royal Family."
"Pours a deep ruddy brown...in the glass it has a hint of mahongony transparency, but otherwise mostly black-not imperial black . A minimal head formed, but disappeared quickly. Aromas were not too powerful...soft toasty malts. Tastes were also mild for an imperial..gentle malts, some chocolate and low bitterness .Good, but mild. Mouthfeel is thin for an imperial. It is quite drinkable..alcohol is well hidden. This is a good stout, but does not have any imperial qualities!"
"The beer pours to a charcoal black with an immoderate head that is frothy in texture and a beauteous light tan color, as it fades rather quickly the lace left behind forms a thin but complete covering upon the glass. The nose is saturated with the aroma of toasted grain, sweet malt, light hints of bittersweet chocolate and the start sweet and nicely malted, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity with the hops delightful in their spiciness. While a drinkable stout, certainly not the most Imperial of Imperial stouts, but worth a sample, maybe a beginners Imperial Stout!"
"Comments  I guess you have to wonder about an Imperial Stout with an Availability rating of, Summer Seasonal."
"In all fairness to this beer, I was given two bottles by a store which was not going to sell them since they were over a year old. I found nothing wrong with the first bottle, and rated the second."
"Doesn't have the punch of a good Imperial. I totally agree with the majority of other reviewers of this beer. It's an enigma of the Imperial Stout style. A poor Imperial Stout but a tasty brew nonetheless."
"stout, as strange as that might sound. If I want Imperial, and I have lately, I'll go for Old Rasputin every time over this."
"Not a bad imperial stout. Perhaps ""imperial"" is a stretch; not quite thick enough to warrant the tag. A creditable attempt, though."
"Dark Mahogany color, small head. Aroma is fruity and chocolaty. A lighter bodied imperial stout. Flavors are chocolate, coffee and fruit. VERY mild for an imperial stout, not very malty or very bitter. As an imperial stout this beer is lacking, for a ""regular"" stout its pretty good. The flavors intensify, as it gets closer to room temperature. It well balanced and tasty. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. The 8.2% alcohol is not at all evident."
"Drinkable, but not up to a Sam Smith's which I had later in the night, just to give myself some comparison."
"Pours deep brown, almost black, with a thick, creamy light brown head. The aroma is roasty and chocolatey with hints of coffee. There is a bit of astringency. It is full in body and somewhat warming. A definite winter brew. It was an okay Imperial Stout, but I wouldnt search it out again."
"The feel is a little oily. Man, this beer needs to be bigger all around. I was expecting more everything."
"Pours black with a light brown head that leaves some nice lacing down the glass.  Slightly alcoholic aroma with some vague roasted bitterness in an otherwise boring aroma.  Nice chocolatey taste from beginning to end.  There is also some too subtle roasted coffeeish bitterness but not nearly what is called for to balance the chocolate flaovrs.  Very thin and simple flavor profile, especially for the style.  Medium, WTF???, body to this brew but a nice creamy feel across the tongue.  Not a bad beer but certainly not a good Imperial Stout.  I'll be sure to pass this up on my next trip to the beer store."
"I would really have trouble calling this an imperial stout.  Mouthfeel is extremely light for the style and the color is a light copper.  Flavors are not the chocolate/roasted/bitter flavors you expect, but more sweet caramel.  A decent brew that goes down easy, but definitely not at the top of the class."
"Ouch.  Lagunitas Brewing really needs to consider removing this from their product line all together, or even better, start the recipe from scratch.  Thin bodied, withered malt/hop profile, subdued smoked fruit aroma.  Lagunitas is an excellent brewery, pray they are visiting beer advocate and will take what seems to be our unanimous advice."
"Bottle is very charged, took me a while to get a normal presentation in the glass.  Very dark brown, not ruby, but not completely opaque.  Darker head is impressively sturdy, holds shapes well at many heights.  Musty smell, some impressions of smoke and acrid stuff.  Somewhat coating.  Not a lot of complexity, honestly some coffee and chocolate flavors and a touch of something evoked by the smell of flowers, like lilacs.  Looked for fruits or alcohol notes but didn't find much of a changing impression.  I don't hate this brew but it lacks an Imperial's promise of variety and complexity."
"There's a decent roasted character in aroma.  That's about it. Appearance is very close to black.  Creamy brown head with no retention and no lacing ability.  This beer is medium to full bodied.  Should be fuller in my opinion.  The taste is very lacking for an imperial.  I've had porters and BROWNS that have been more complex (see DF Indian Brown and Rogue Hazelnut).  This is pretty weak for an imperial.  Pretty thin for the style too.  I get slight roasted and chocolate malt qualities.  Very little bitterness.  Not recommended."
"Aroma is fruity...an odd smell I've come to find in Lagunitas beers...It might just be me but I find it unpleasant..black with a creamy head..pretty creamy mouthfeel...slight tart hoppy bite on the finish..not super thick, tasty or complex...doesn't have the qualities of other imperials I have tried...some sweet milk chocolate taste...easy drinking but thin for an imperial...some fruitiness, and some sourness on the deep finish....I'm unimpressed overall...there are A LOT better imperials out there...A LOT..."
"The biggest mistake was putting the word Imperial on the label. Great sweet stout but it is seriously lacking in Imperial quality. If just said ""Stout"" on the label it probably would have gotten a 3.5 to 3.75 above average."
