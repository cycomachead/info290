"Very smokey, not much else going on in terms of flavor, but still very solid and would drink if I didn't have a more coffee vanil centric stout."
"FEEL THE POWER!!  Imperial stouts usually tend to taste more like spirits than stout, this one = a happy medium. This was really far out, 10 and one half percent or so, it'll get you drunk.....and after having the four pack, you'll probably say to yourself, ""two of those.....WAS QUITE ENOUGH", followed by a galaxy of stars.  Amen."
""
"O - A very good imperial stout that is smooth and full of flavour. More like a dessert though with its very sweet finish. Definitely one to try and enjoy after dinner on a cold winters night"
""
""
"This was strong but didn't really feel it but I noticed the warming coming over me once I made my way through this beer. Not overly spicy or boozy, this was a welcome departure from Sierra Nevada's other offerings while keeping up their level of quality that  they've come to be known for. Those looking for a thinner Coffee Stout with hints of vanilla or a Russian Imperial Stout along the lines of the Old Rasputin will find that this straddled the line between the two, but quite nicely as I am looking forward to giving this another go! Certainly worthy of the Sierra Nevada moniker."
""
"It's really malty with a hint of coffee, for some reason I think it has a rubbing alcohol taste to it as well which really bums me out, otherwise it's good."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability suffers a bit in my eyes because of the sweet finish. If the sweetness was muted just a bit this could bey favorite ever."

"2013 bottle poured into a snifyer an cellar temo. The hops have faded significantly but not enough for my taste. Nice body with a one-finger head that dissipated quickly."
""
""
"Thick, boozy RIS. A fine RIS to get if you want to get to buzz town quickly, but definitely not in the top tier."
""
"A good beer."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/5/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, licorice, leather, tobacco, light pine, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, licorice, leather, char, tobacco, herbal, light pine, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/char and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, char, leather, tobacco, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Russian imperial stout. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: I thought that this was a decent stout. Taste wise its not the best of its style but it is certainly solid. I’ve also heard that it ages well so I may have to find another bottle to age a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So good and a very heavy mouth feel! This stout is outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
"Love it! Very delicious stout!"
"This is an awesome stout. It reminded me of FBS in a lot of ways. It's sweeter, and maybe not quite as smooth, but it's damn close. I was shocked to still find a couple 4 packs of this in the store. I'll be saving the rest for a later time."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer but make sure you age it for at least a year.  Pulled out one I had aged for three years recently and it was well worth the wait.  Smooth, chocolaty and rich."
"Love this stout....Nice job Sierra Nevada!  The beer pours opaque with off white head with slight lace.  The scent has slight roast and espresso.  The taste is has a slight maple syrup, dark chocolate and coffee flare.  The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall this is great!"
""
"Very well constructed and balanced RIS, with the coffee, chocolate and roast flavors playing equal parts. The coffee does emerge as slightly predominant as it warms. For the price point, a high quality product for a very reasonable price."
"This is okay. Narwhal has a significant amount of  anise or licorice flavor. I like black licorice and ouzo, but somehow I just don't like it in this beer."
""
"An Imperial without the feeling of ABV for ABV's sake. Oh my. Supremely drinkable and luscious. Someday I hope this is what humanity envisions when they hear the word ""beer"". Except then the world will be half-drunk all the time."
""
""
""
""
"-overall a great beer that is a palate experience love the coffee roasted malts and the hot alcohol warmth that follows every sip"
"Overall: complex, smooth yet full body texture.  Great with a dinner"
""

""

""
""
"'13 vintage. Spongy caramel head. Smells of red velvet cake and heavy molasses. A little hotter than expected with a year on it, but nice buttery feel. Very malty with slight roasted coffee tones. Excellent imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O.  At first glance after the pour I thought to myself "" this looks nice "".  Then the nose didn't present as much as it doors on the palate IMO.  I'm usually not a huge fan of Sierra Nevada but this is my first stout and they got it right.  I'm looking the mouthfeel and the taste alot.  A good beer.  Will be looking for the BA."
""
""
""
"Small and quickly reducing head that is dough like and caramel brown. Mouthfeel is abrupt but not over powering."
""
"Overall a nice beer. I think it's a little too bitter for my liking. I tend to like the richer stouts in comparison to the more bitter kinds. However, this beer is actually pretty good. I could see this paired with a porterhouse steak in a mole sauce. I give it a 89/100."
"Great stout to sip on"
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy, chocolatey, delish. Better than more affordable Old Raspy, unfortunately."
""
""
""
"Cocoa and coffee.  Intetesting and well crafted-just not for me.  Had trouble pairing it with food.  Heady like Boris' woman on the screen."

"Will not seek out or purchase again."
""
"This is a very god imperial stout."
"Great stout. Great balance of flavors, PERSONALLY think it's a bit hoppy for a stout but every beer is different, and I respect that. Still is one of my favorite stouts nonetheless."
""
"Thought it was plain.  One taste all the way from start to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was truly Intense!"
""
""
"You get a lot of medium toasted malt flavor, with some outside hints of roasted coffee.  You can sense some hops in there as well, and some residual alchohol peaks through.  Mouthfeel is smooth.  Aroma is lacking, mostly just the toasted malt.  Overall a good stout but not exceptional."
""
""
"Very, very good & highly recommend. A high standard for stouts."
"One of the better stouts I've ever tasted. Smooth and rich. Full, amazing flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A dark roasted masterpiece with incredible drinkability"
""
""
"Solid. All hail the toothed whale!!"
""
""
"Nice long finish, w a little bit of warmth"
""
"Fresh and a bit boozy."
"12 oz bottle poured into tall tulip glass.  Oily black with about 1/2 inch of brown head that slowly dissipates leaving nice lacing.  A bit sweet and roasty in the smell with molasses, brown sugar and dark roast.  Taste is somewhat different from the smell and hard to describe - dark brown sugar mixed with dark brown bread??  Mouth feel is delightful, probably the best aspect of the beer.  Overall, I'd have to say I really like this one.  Can't wait to try the barrel aged version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another excellent stout!  Massive flavors of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, dark molasses, coffee, licorice, brown sugar and some nicely balanced hops, awesomely blended together in a chewy, smooth quaff.  Fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
"Very dark color,  slight beer aftertaste, overall pretty good"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours midnight black but I do not have my high intensity flashlight to inspect for clarity, however if it is like many of these very dark brews when inspected closely will likely be a very dark brown with a ruby tint. More when I find out. The pour produces a 2+ finger, moderately lasting, tightly bubbled, mocha head that leaves almost no lace. Aroma is dark malt, Hershey's Chocolate Syrup & undertones of unsweetened bakers cocoa, coffee, figs, prunes, burley tobacco & thin floral hop tones. Taste is sweet Hershey's Chocolate Syrup followed by semi-sweet dark chocolate, toffee, roasted (burnt) malt, dates, figs, fruit cake & coffee. Finishes much like the rest of the sip but rapidly develops more intense coffee & burnt notes, with hints of chocolate covered cherry cordials, more intense alcohol warmth & developing an alcohol/hop bitterness & peppery spice. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with medium carbonation, thick, creamy & wet with a tiny spice prickle in the finish. A heavy, rich, complex & very desert type brew."
""
""
""
"Very thick, more after taste tan I care for.  Will not purchase again."
"Overall: Quite unique in its fruity component; and toned-down a bit in its chocolate and roast as compared to many examples of the style. It has finesse! Balanced, rounded, and satisfying. Without question, one of the best Imperial Stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer"
""
""
"Poured pitch black in color, tan head. Zero lacing on glass. Smell is of malt, chocolate, espresso. Taste is very velvety, with the espresso coming thru.Overall this is excellent. One of my top 10 favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent and delicious.  I haven't tried a fresh sample yet but I'd bet waiting until this is about 2 years old is a wise move."
""
"Update #2: After 4 months cellared this beer is very creamy and mellow with a mild to moderate bitterness in the finish that blends really well."
""
"I find this beer to be better tasting than Old Rasputin.  Continuing my quest to try more Imperial Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is fantastic, when i first bought it i thought it was good but I'm so surprised at a few months in the cellar has this beer drinking really well now. Went back to the store today and they were out..I better savor the last few bottles until next year."
""
""
""
"Poured into an oversized pilsner glass from a 12oz bottle. Pours almost pitch black, not too thick as far as consistency. Head is minimal, a redwood color that leaves just a bit of lacing as you sip. Smells amazing, you'll know that this is going to be a delicious brew as soon as you catch a whiff. Velvety smooth, alcohol warmth present, but does not feel like you're drinking a 10%er. Has a chocolate richness to it. Very impressed with this beer. Definitely buying a six pack next time."
"Very roasty, black licorice, dark chocolate, dark cherry, bitter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic stout, full bodied and full of alcohol!"
"Pours pitch black with a small tan head, smells of roasted malts chocolate caramel slight hops, tastes boozy malty chocolatey caramel slight piney hops, thick chewy mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Overall - It is sweeter (not too much) than other stouts but I actually like that. This is a big boy though and it is thick and rich. One of the best RIPs I have ever had.  Fantastic beer that exceeded my expectations. And at 10.2%, worst case scenario is you feel great afterwards. In other words, try one."
""
"So I have been seeking this out for a while, did try the SN Porter and the SN coffee stout. Never had the regular stout, never see it around although I'm sure it is similar to coffee stout. saw this last night and got very excited . Much anticipation. Tried to not get my hopes too high as stouts always have that ""filling"" Maltiness to me and I drink iPas mostly. Wow. This beer is incredible. Very smooth. DEFINATLY not able to detect the 10.2% abv until it leaves your mouth with a chocolatey Bite.  Not nearly as carbonated and ""airy"" as the Porter and stout. Perfection. Like a silky chocolate smoothness. Not sure if I could have more than one because of the sweetness. But, still, after the first sip I was already wondering how I'm gonna secure another 4 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours really dark with a thick creamy head. Faint smell of chocolate. Taste of dark chocolate and mild coffee. Medium creamy mouthful with mild carbonation. Has a nice balanced taste with a nice finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything about this brew is just incredible."
""
"Not my favorite imperial stout but a wonderful beer!"
"O- Really great. I was expecting a fair contribution of hops, but the sweetness, dark chocolate character was a good surprise. And stronger than one would think."
""
""
"I know I've reviewed this before, yet another review that was lost somewhere in the BA changeover some time ago. But I'll do it again for kicks and giggles. Here's the abridged stuff you need to know. It's an imperial stout. It has all the characteristics of an imperial stout. Noteworthy here is the well hidden ABV. Awesome beer. Get some."
""
"Lots going on here. Coffee, berries and chocolate."
""
""
"Great price beer ....that is not hard to find"
""
"Color great smell awesome taste better than expected for non barrel aged version. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a good stout but nothing over the top.  Flavors are there but don't pop or hit very hard and the aroma was nearly non-existent compared to what you'd expect in a big RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Bourbon flavor with just the right notes. Very smooth. Pricey but worth it."
""
""
""
"All in all, I had high hopes and this beer was even better than I thought it could be."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the finest imperial stouts money can buy..."
"I think you either love or hate this beer. Personally, I think it is good and the bottle art is great. If you like Sierra Nevada and stouts, dive in."
""
"Every taste keeps saying to me ""no kidding around"". A real swashbuckler & I'm really enjoying it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinking this 1 year aged (2013) at Owl farm. Ages really well, though a little boozy.  A roastiness still aparant in the finish.  12 oz pour might be a little much for this one..."
"O: Excellent beer. I will need to try this again with a proper pour from a good tap or bottle. This beer is a truly dark monster of complexity and challenge, but in all good ways. For those who like Rasputin for its sweeter malts, this is not the beer for you, but if you like Rasputin Imperial for everything else, then Narwhal is a must have."
""
""
"As always, I find barrel aged to be TOO much flavor in the wrong direction. As this special brew breathed the barrel aged flavor became too overpowering. Not my cup of tea!"
""
""
"Just wasn't what I was looking for.  I had been drinking some ales beforehand so maybe that affected my taste buds. But this just had too syrupy a taste for me."
""
"viscosity heavy in feel...love the chocolate as it rolls across...smoother than Ol Raspy...and, on some days....better"
"Molasses and chocolate. Alcohol seems a little more forward in this than in the BA Narwhal. Sweet and mildly bitter. Good to drink anytime but great in the winter."
"smokey alcohol malt, very smooth"
""
""
"Overall, another solid entry from SN. This is a very good example of a ""good"" RIS; doesn't execute any aspect perfectly but does them all very well. A good beer on a cold winter night. (Incidentally, my curiosity caused me to look up what a Narwhal is. Fascinating creature)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown almost black, this head has a chocolate color. Roasted barley or malt odor, not much else ""pops"". Burnt coffee taste gives way to nice roasted malts you also get some bitterness like you would from dark chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle; pours black with minimal head. Roasty, malty scent. Taste is mildly sweet at start, but finishes with coffee and bitter hops. The bitterness is more pronounces than any sweetness. It's a smooth drink, creamy, with nice carbonation despite the lack of head."
""
""
"Just slightly to much bitter threw it a little out of whack.  But the bitter was probably a strong component to how well the ABV is hidden.  Extremely tasty with loads of malty deliciousness, seems like a bit of coffee within the bitter finish.  Very smooth and creamy, overall an outstanding beer that I would gladly have again."
""
""
""
""
"Value:  Reasonable price for a quality beer."
""
"Good at all that it is supposed to be. Not as complex as many new stouts on the scene but very drinkable. Smooth. And I love the way it changes as it Warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice kick for a good bargain."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is outstanding. Period."
""
"2014 edition.  12oz bottle, dated 08/13/14, served in pint glass.  Beer pours pitch black and slick like oil, with nearly zero head.  Dark aromas suggest molasses.  Flavors are immediate and complex: layers of toasted barley, burnt toast, treacle, and of course ethanol, but there's also an assertive hop flavor.  I find the combination spicy, very appropriate for winter, and decided American (a high gravity, high IBU stout?  why not!).  Mouthfeel is great, low carbonation, which is perfect for the style."
""
"Overall, this beer is delicious. Now on to BA Narwhal!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Burnt malts on the front, boozy on the back. Not too bitter, and it's got a lighter mouthfeel than I expected it would have."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really drinkable Imperial Stout that's full of flavor without being overpowering, and at 9 bucks or so for a 4 pack it's a bargain."

"Overall: Probably my all-time favorite Imperial Stout, and I'd go far to say favorite beer of all time. It's great taste and mouthfeel are definitely its best attributes, while it's 10.2 % ABV is also a plus. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; well-worth a try.  (4.25)"
"Medium body and not quite as heavy as a lot of stouts. Very smooth and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- At $9.99 a 4-pack, this is a bargain buy stout! Wouldn't expect anything less of Sierra Nevada."

"This is a beautiful Imperial Stout, black with little head. I served it from the refrigerator so it was cold. As it warmed up I could pick up on more of the licorice. Nice maltiness, and the presence of hops which gave the beer a little bite, but just enough to fill out the balance and overall taste. I can see how this stout could be dangerous with over all ease of drinking and the ABV T 10.2%. Overall, I really like Narwhal and will pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, very smooth, dangerously drinkable. I can imagine this  could cause a lot of embarrassing evenings to less than controlled drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would certainly recommend this to anyone.  I really enjoyed it and now look forward to trying the BA version."
"Very smooth for an imperial stout, mild carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good imperial stout and worth getting when it's available. The taste is more complex and certainly different from other stouts because of the greater focus on the toffee flavor as opposed to the roasty and chocolate flavors that most other stouts have. I would definitely recommend picking this up when you can."
""
""
""
""
""
"Expectations might have caught me slightly.  I thought this was a solid beer, but not as exceptional as I've heard people state (hopefully not confusing with BA plaudits).  Definitely will grab this again when available but a four pack is enough for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"heavy, but the right balance for a stout.  a little more bite than new Holland's dragons milk"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a fizzy tan head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate, toffee notes, slightly roasty. The taste is very nice malty, with lots of dark stuff, slight vanilla, some roastyness. Medium body, with a nice bitter finish, ABV hidden pretty well with this one. Overall a very tasty brew, glad to see it here in UT, would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is not a competitor to the really ""Big"" stouts, but it is certainly a welcome member to a market saturated with IPA's.  It lacks any single defining quality that makes it stand out above the rest, but it is more then worthy of a spot on the shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - terrific offering from Sierra Nevada! To me this is a cross between an RIS and a Black IPA! The price point gives this one the nod over many other stouts! I'm anxious to try this alongside a few of my favorite Black IPA's, like Wookey Jack, Sublimely, and Mountain Standard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Impressive IS"
""
""
""
""
""
"Narwhal is a very enjoyable Stout and one that any Stout lover must try.  Nice job Sierra Nevada!"
"O:  A good beer.  Not great, but good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"They have blended the vanilla, chocolate and espresso so smoothly with a luxurious taste that it makes you crave for more. And I learned from my 12 year old what a Narwhal is. But this may be the priciest beer I have ever bought at $21. While a great beer, I can't say its worth that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most complete imperial stouts I've tried.  Not too smokey with a fine balance of cocoa nibs, dates and mild heat.  Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cold into the snifter, poured midnight black with a cocoa-tinged head w/small bubbles. Can't see the letters on the glass... nice. Aromas of roasted malts, coffee, some chocolate, and the clean SN bitter note. Deep, complex flavors. Some nice coffee on the end, and excellent balance, not afraid to have so E bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, not chewy like other big stouts. Nice and crisp. I have waited a long time for this beer, and I was definitely not disappointed. Did anyone else notice, though, that this didn't necessarily get smoother, more complex as it warmed up? My only small concern. Would recommend."
""
""
"12 OZ Bottle.Pours a black color.Smell of Coffee and chocolate.Taste is Chocolate with the Coffee slightly up front.Slight bitterness.I liked it a lot.Nice combination of flavors with a nice 10.2 ABV.I would recommend this to anyone who likes stouts.Give it a try."
""
"First time trying, 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Poured with almost no head, jet black and not as thick as I was expecting.  Mostly roasted malts on the nose.  Paired with some 72% dark chocolate which is pretty much my standard for RIS.  Taste was the biggest miss for me - mostly malts and some fruit, very little else.  Mouthfeel was thin in my opinion for RIS.  I had this one night after a 2014 Expedition, which was spot on, so maybe just variations on the style with my preference being a bit bigger RIS than Narwhal."

""

""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours a deep black color with a large frothy tan head.  The head dissipates into a thin film that is quickly revived with a swirl of the glass.  Aroma is great, comprising of coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt.  Flavor follows suit and adds a sweetness and bitterness into the mix.  Thick texture and chewy.  Full bodied yet incredibly smooth and drinkable for the high ABV.  Great imperial stout that I probably would not go out of my way to seek out but would enjoy anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is a pretty good imperial stout.  Pretty typical for an imperial stout.  Chocolate, anise, booze, roasted malt bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very similar to Old Rasputin however the ABV gives it a slight edge that once you finish the beer, you're left feeling some warmth in your body."
""
""
"O: [4.25] This beer has a lot going on in the taste.  Coffee, chocolate, malty sweetness - some bitterness.  It is a great melding of flavors.  The nose wasn't that pronounced - which surprised me.  However, the taste and the smooth body made up for it."
""
"Overall - Awesome stout. It has some very interesting fruity and notes that you don't see in a lot of other imperial stouts, and is really dangerously drinkable. It just doesn't feel all that heavy and ""chewy", like drinking your dinner, which, while some may disapprove of, I enjoy."
""

"Very nice.  If you love imperial stouts, you'll love this one.  A great beer to sip and enjoy, especially in the cooler months."
"This is a damn fine stout. No complaints from me...."
"This beer is very likeable, but I was a bit disappointed by the flavors all blending into one compination that I just could not decipher. I would get this again but it's meant to be enjoyed in small gulps."

"Overall- Tough one to wrap my arms around, almost hard to get around the fusel alcohol profile in the aroma and smell. An intensly bitter beer, from the malt profile, hops, down to the hot alcohol notes. There is a warmer and sweeter note as the beer warms up in the aftertaste, almost chocolatey vanilla, but the bitterness still remains. This beer begs to be aged."

"2013 into a snifter. Some sharp bite on this despite being a year old. Might have to admit that I prefer Ten Fidy..."

"First of all, the bottle imagery is badass. I mean a narwhal is like my second favorite kind of whale, OMG! Seriously though, narwhals are badasses, and so is this beer. Pours completely opaque black - like a very deep, briny ocean, this beer does not let light through. Has a small, short lived, dark brown head. Clocks in at a 10.2, and the aroma doesn't hide it. Definitely detectable alcohol in the nose, with a deeper nuttiness and malt, choco-caramel, and other dark, sweet things. Taste reflects all that, and is almost bridging into a liquor-filled chocolate cordial. Really nice and I'd for sure get this again."

"Overall: Where I live its easy to find, I purchased this one from a local grocery store chain for $10. It is well worth that considering everything, and that is why I have become a SN fan. Anyway, the store also had Snow pack, Celebration, and all the other 12 packs on sale for $12.99, so I may be heading back there to stock up!"

"Drinkability – An easy drinking stout, that goes down well for 10.2%abv.  I prefer stouts with a touch more alcohol, but this is nice."

"Jet black colour, ring of tan head with a bit of lace. Smell is roasty, lots of chocolate and coffee,  well hopped with some earthy notes, light dark fruit in the periphery. Taste starts out with some dark fruit, light roast with some bitter hop mid palate, chocolate and coffee flavours linger into the finish. Light carbonation, medium-full body, good feel. A solid imperial stout, nothing groundbreaking but a nice and flavourful stout that is a pleasure to drink."

"i accident bought this brew - narwhal imperial stout along with other brews IPA & Double IPA.  i drank this brew first and i kinda like bitter-coffey kind. it hit my tongue smooth and strong kick on end note. i also ate Heresy chocolate nuts bar during tasting it. great beer for stout category"

"Pours super black with little to no head. Smells dark and fruity. Raisins maybe? Tasted chocolate and roasted. Changed the longer I sipped. You can taste the alcohol for sure. Not a bad thing though. Not the same as some other Imperial Stouts that I have had. Delicious though."
"Pours opaque black with a head that quickly fades and leaves some nice Lacing.  Smells of roasted grains,  some dark raisin aroma.  Tastes of roasted grain,  slight chocolate notes, a little coffee.   Not as thick as I expected,  pretty easy drinking and the high ABV is well hidden.   Overall,  good Imperial stout, would buy again."

"Draft.  Deep brown, almost black with about a 1/2 finger of head that dissipated quickly. Smells of chocolate, bread and roasted grains.  Little coffee.  Surprisingly light in the mouth.  Not as creamy as you would expect.  Tastes of dark chocolate, roasted malts and light coffee.  Not espresso.  Not thick.  Not what I was expecting.  It is light and good.  Drinkable.  Doesn't feel like a high ABV but it is.  Good imperial stout but lighter than I wanted.  I like mine thick and creamy."

"Overall I liked the year old one more. Though I had not realized the piney character being so strong last year also given the factor of how much my palate has changed which I know it has a lot. The fresh one is very good and a nice imperial stout to have and reasonably priced too. But if you have the means I strongly recommend giving that a try because its well worth it."

"Overall:  A great representation of the imperial stout style.  All the roasted flavors are present and has great balance.  Theres little bit of alcohol but not overpowering."
"Poured an unbelievably thick black.  When held up in front of a light, the light did not shine through!  One and a half finger caramel-colored head faded fairly quickly.  Not a lot of aroma, surprisingly. Beer had pleasing amount of taste, caramel and malts, with a slight alcohol ""burn"" on the finish.  Not massive, though.  You know you have a stout, but it isn't slapping you upside the head.  An attribute that makes the 10.2 ABV prone to sneak up on you.  Alcohol taste faded as beer warmed.  This beer has absolutely the best mouthfeel of any beer I have ever had; a wonderful thick blanket of creamy malty caramel that gets even creamier as you savor it.   A fantastic imperial stout, and I am very much looking forward to the three that are left!"
""
""
""
"Very impressed by this beer. A sipper that can go down quickly if not careful. The sweetness obscures the alcohol a bit and adds a wonderful note to the malts without getting in the way of other flavors. Highly recommend."

"On draft at Chuck's 85th St.  Thin, meager head, with some lace as you drink.  Very dark, inky, opaque.  Aroma is coffee, smoked malt, raisins, fig, molasses, some herbal notes from the hops.  Sips bitter, a bit green, then sweet malt into the finish.  Some hot alcohol flash, drinks thick, finishes medium.  Overall very good,  could be exceptional with some more aging on it."
""
""
""
""
""

"o: this needs to sit for a few years or months me thinks.  i can taste a real nice base beer in here, theres just a lot of alcohol in the flavor right now.  as it sits in the glass for a bit, those flavors do shine through.  its a nice beer, that will be made better as the alcohol flavor dies off"

"Delicious aroma of chocolate with a hint of coffee. A med/full head on the pour supported by the dark chocolate brown body. Smooth and sweet with the bitterness of dark roasted coffee to finish. This doesn't hide it's 10.2%ABV Imperial kick for very long. I left this to chill on the porch for a bit [58 degrees] for about 30 min before I opened and poured. it.  Delightful !"
"Pours a dark black, only a little foam that faded to a light film, left no lacing.  The aroma was of dark chocolate, slight coffee, sweet malt, and just a hint of dark fruit.  Taste was of sweet chocolate and coffee, with some bitter hoppiness and alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with some alcohol, but not too much. Just right.  Overall, this beer is super tasty, can't wait to see what a year of cellaring has done to it."
"Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout -----4/5."
"Yum! A great version of one of my very favorite beer styles. The last one I had on draft was SO GOOD that I didn't actually share it as intended, oops."

"Just the way I like my Imperial Stouts; rich, smooth, full bodied, heady aroma, malty finish. Bought it as a 'pick a pack' selection from a borough distributor. Pleasant surprise. Definitely will purchase again!"

"Nice deep chocolate brown that just doesn't want any light to peek through, nice!! Relatively light aroma, with maybe a hint of sweet chocolate malt coming through. Taste is bold with hints of bitter chocolate and a touch of sweet malts. I know that the ABV is high, but the mouthfeel is predominately alcohol, taking away I think a little from what I would imagine to be quite a spectacular flavor. Burns ever so slightly as it inches its way across the tongue and down the gullet. Overall, a pretty balanced with what I think is just a touch too much alcohol feel that slightly numbs the mouth..."

"Bottle from mike67. Pours a deep slightly viscous black with a small brown head. Aroma and Taste of dark roasted caramel malt, some mild liquorice notes, dark fruit with some notes of dark cacao and mild espresso flavors with a dark toasted malt bitterness on the end for balance. A full bodied, creamy body on the palate with moderate carbonation and sticky mouth feel. A good full flavored brew, rich and creamy. Overall this is very good, delicious and flavorful brew."

"O- overall one of my go to faves in the style, would never pass one up. This review is on a 2013, had a few fresh and saved this for a bit. It seems to have taken on a musty dampness to it, not terrible but makes me not feel bad for drinking them fresh.."
"Overall- Great imperial stout with nice roasted malts and sweet chocolate balancing each other out. Only downfall to me is the roast/coffee malts linger at the end which I could do without. Definitely worth picking up again. (90/100)"

"O: 4.5 I really like this stout. It’s definitely one of Sierra’s best brews and up there with some of my favorite, easy-to-get, non-BA stouts (think old rasputin and ten-fidy). Super easy to drink and develops a lot as it warms. I’ll be looking forward to this every winter."

"Taste / Palate: The mild aroma gives way to a big bold full bodied malty sweetness on the tongue. There are notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, and raisins. It’s 10.2% abv is noticeable but mellow and adds to its overall character. The palate feels smooth with light carbonation in this big heavy offering from Sierra Nevada. It finishes slowly with just a touch of earthy hops."
"Pleasantly surprised that one of my local haunts had Narwhal on tap. She pours an inky jet black with a thick looking tan head to boot. Very nice, almost perfect for what I want in a stout, in fact. The aroma is quite roasty, with a fairly large presence of bittersweet chocolate as well. After a highly anticipated sip, that baker's chocolate satisfied my taste buds fully, along with very pleasant fruit esters (predominantly plum and dark fruits). What I like is how wonderfully bitter the overall package is. There is perhaps some hops detectable in the flavor here. Very full on the mouth feel. Overall, a very solid Imperial Stout."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good imperial stout, and while I'm usually remiss to compare specific beers directly, I can't help myself. The body, look and feel remind me so much of my favorite RIS, Founders' version, that I think it's fair to note that they are cousins from the same family of oppressive (in a good way?) full-bodied stouts, but take different paths when it comes to aroma and taste. Where Founders is a bit drier, with a focus on cocoa, roast and coffee notes, this one leans more towards fruit and anise. My personal preference is towards the former, but this is surely top of the list when it comes to stouts that incorporate those dark fruits."

""
"Overall - Just a delicious and very satisfying RIS, a sipper for sure. Take your time with this one to fully enjoy the complex flavors here, and the wonderful transition from mouthcoating and creamy to lightly astringent and bitter, then repeat... This is a fairly easy RIS to get your hands on - do yourself a favor and get about 2 years on a few of them, well worth the wait. My favorite by far is FIS, and after 2 years this comes Really close, just a tad lighter, but not light by any means. An excellent RIS, highly recommend."

"To the beer itself, very smooth, coffee, chocolate, some licorice, and a definite alcohol presence in this one, it literally warms your innards, no joke! This beer leaves you feeling very smooth, and very relaxed at the end of the evening, a perfect beer at the end of a cold/cool night in fall, winter, or early spring.. or whenever!! Very sellarable as well, this thing can last for many years if you want to sellar it."
"Flavor: coffee, expresso, dark chocolate, smoke flavor similar to grilled meats, strong citrus peel. Overall: this is not a training wheel beer. A finely crafted product from Sierra Nevada, this beer is outstanding on a cold day when you want something to sip in front of the fireplace."
""
""
"Overall- outstanding offering, especially from Sierra Nevada, which doesn't have many offerings that appeal to me."

"Narwhal is one of the thickest and gnarliest beers I have gotten through. It was well worth it but boy was it heavy. It looked beautiful like black coffee in my glass. It tasted bitter as all hell. Very nice."

""
""
""
""
"As far as imperial stouts go, this stands among the finest."
"O: I think that the alcohol comes through strongly, so if you either don't like the flavor of alcohol or can't get past it, you'll have a hard time enjoying the beer. It has a lot to offer and what I really appreciate is how it has a roasted flavor without being overly bitter. It has a nice balance of flavors without pushing anything over the top. Unfortunately this balance could be considered a downfall if looking for something outside of the box. While it is a great example of a RIS, it doesn't feel as unique as its namesake suggests."

"OVERALL: Pretty good stuff. Lots of burnt and charred notes with tobacco definitely give it a European tough. If you like this one, you'll probably like the stuff coming out of De Molen in Holland and various Danish breweries that deserve some praise. The feel is slightly lighter on this, which holds it back a bit. Fill that out and it would support the flavors that much more. Still, this is a solid effort worth checking out if you get the chance. If it were reasonably priced, I'd go back for seconds."

"Easily one of the darkest stouts I have seen in a while. Beer pours a DARK black molasses color, making light impossible to penetrate this brew. The beer has a beautiful, smooth aroma, topped off with a nice amount of lace and head when poured into a glass. A slight hint of chocolate is abundant and the beer is extraordinarily smooth. Sierra Nevada never let me down and in my opinion it is a toss up between them and Widmer as the best American brewers. An absolute must have, so far the best new beer I've tried in the last 6 months or so."

"Overall: A great beer, and I was surprised to taste as much bittering hop as I did. When I burped, you could definitely re-taste the hoppiness (gross, I know). While hops aren't the dominant profile here, they are certainly assertive in their bittering qualities. But we wouldn't expect anything less from Sierra Nevada, would we? A great brew, and one I recommend. Definitely a sipper, and definitely a once-in-a-while beer, not something I could stomach any time any day."
"Overall, really solid and to style."
""
""
"Had this on-tap, 10 ounces. One word: delicious. Have since had it from the bottle and it's just not the same. On tap, it was syrupy, complex, wonderful. beautiful espresso head. I'm really sad that I didn't get another glass of it, but, ya know, driving... Strong coffee flavors, plum, chocolate, just rich and tasty."
""
""
""

"O - A very good example of an imperial stout. The incorporation of 10% alcohol and 60 IBU into a beer with this kind of balance is well done. Everything is in good proportion to one another."

"o: Absolutely a top notch stout, and a relatively inexpensive one at that. Sign me up for a case next year."

"Overall this is a nice big stout from Sierra Nevada. Totally drinkable and something I would have again."
""
"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Deep, dark, black color, with very thick tan head which dissipated to thin veil. Excellent, consistent lacing. Smell is incredibly rich aura of burnt/roasted chocolate malt and coffee/vanilla hints. Unfortunately, the palate was not quite as impressive (to me). A little too much dank hoppiness, with the result that the balance was out of kilter. Carbonation and mouthfeel was good, but I could not get past the uneven bite and apparent conflict between the hops and the flavors trying to compete. Maybe I had a bad bottle, or just need to let it sit and warm up a bit more. Willing to try again, as I love so much of what SN does."

"Poured from a 355 ml bottle. Pours black with thin tannish head. Notes of chocolate, fruit and nuts on the bold rich nose. Huge, rich taste hits similar notes with a big, boozy finish. Tons of bitterness on the finish to balance the ample sweetness. Full-bodied. Great sipper."
"Really enjoyed this one. Pours dark with a decent head. Smells of chocolate and fruit. Was very smooth as the amount of chocolate was just about perfect. One of the best stouts I have had to date. Very impressed with this Sierra Nevada beer. Interested in cellaring some to compare the difference."

"O: I really enjoyed this. I would love to see a barrel aged version of this. I think Im going to let my last bottle sit to see if aging mellows out the hop bite a bit. For the price defiantly pick this up."

"Overall it's enjoyable, about standard for the modern day definition of an American imperial stout."

"Pitch Black pour with a creamy two finger caramel-colored head with nice retention and lacing. Unique, sweet, roasty nose with hints of espresso, licorice, toffee, cocoa, and a fair amount of hops, almost like a Black IPA. The taste is quite unique as well. Rich, roasty espresso and dark chocolate fudge dominate along with hints of piney hops, licorice, toffee, cocoa, sweet caramel malts, and some subtle soy sauce. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy with absolutely perfect balance. Overall, I am totally amazed at how good this beer is. It's absolutely right up there with any Imperial Stout. Probably has taken over Ten Fidy's spot as the best readily available Imperial Stout out there!"

"Fantastic beer. Not much else to say about that. Underrated, in my opinion. Stands up well to some other, perhaps more popular, RIS's."
""
""
""
"Pours a four finger tan head that slowly fades leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose and flavor is roasted coffee, higher ABV is hidden. $2.60 for a 12oz bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Definitely a sipping and savoring beer, but also appealing enough that I could drink it faster and not mind, but I would probably pay for it later. A good imperial stout, and was good with butter/sugar cookies - probably would be great with a steak."

"Overall this is a very nice RIS, well balanced with a slight sweetness off setting some of the dark bitterness. This is a nice sipping beer on a relaxing evening."

"Just about everything I try from Sierra Nevada has the same ale taste and this Imperial Stout was no different. The stout pour nice and dark with a head that reminds me of chocolate but the pour seemed a little thin. The aroma is ale and the taste had the same bite to it. Maybe too much carbonation as well. I started the the beer being served cold and as it warmed, the taste seemed to improve a little but not to the extent that I try again."

"Narwhal proves itself as a quality stout with a begging for barrel aging."

"O - I'm not usually a fan of the style, but being out of SN, I thought I'd try it. This one may just entice me to sample more RIS. Thanks Sierra Nevada!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: About what I expected, nothing special, but nothing bad. Won't buy again, just really wanted to check it off my list."
""
"O: This is a very good beer, but the fruity part of the taste really threw me off. I'll have to pick up another bottle and see if I got unlucky or there's just something that I don't like. Everything but that one flavor is fantastic. Definitely didn't live up to its hype for me as far as taste goes, but still an enjoyable, if a bit disappointing, beer."
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorites imperial stouts from one of my favorite breweries. This is at least, an outstanding beer, if not world class. A lot easier to drink after cellaring it for 5 months, still have some bottles I will open at the end of 2014, or maybe in between. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall, really spicy for a stout. Of course SN loves to overuse hops. And they didn't make an exception just bc they made a stout. Too much for my taste, but with the tasty chocolate upfront, still makes for a good spicy ""holiday stout"""

"Poured a blackish body with almost brown head that is one-finger high and leaves a little ring as it goes down. First thing that hits my nose is coffee, then a bunch of roasted (I won't say toasted or smoked) malts and some bitter chocolate (or dark). The body is heavy, and while I would not list heavy/stoutish beers as some of my faves, I really like this one b/c while heavy it still passes easy (slightly chewey as well). I get mostly a roasted, coffeeish malt experience but the addition, and then due to addition great balance, of some dark chocolate makes this a dry and sweet experience and thanks to the easy passing this beer is by no means a chore to continually sip on. This is a great stout that even not-stout fans should try."

"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, this feels on the slick side even with the viscosity and has about average carbonation for such a bold beer. It’s bitter, it’s smoky, but it’s damn tasty and a really good RIS that went down easier than it should have. I really liked this beer when I bought this 4 pack last December and feel it got better with age. A high recommendation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, chewy, and barely carbonated. Drying finish, smooth, but with a cloying aspect that is annoying. No warming to speak of strangely."
""
""
""
""
"Another fantastic brew from SN. Complex and very well put together. Highly recommended."
""
"Very good overall. Full of flavor. Though, over the top in some areas of the flavor profile which confuses the RIS style."
""
"O: SN did a great job with this. It's a very nice, balanced imperial. Great value at $10/4pk. Makes a great sipper on cold evenings. Paired well with thanksgiving desserts."
"Well done Sierra Nevada."

"prost LampertLand"
"O: Definitely one of the best RIS's I've ever had. I like the nice hop presence that many other RIS seem to be lacking. It's cheap ($8 for a 4 pack), available, and really damn good. Will probably be a future mainstay in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" -I didn’t give this beer a perfect five because, as stated in the first section of my overall comments, the only thing keeping this beer back from perfection is the need for a slightly more pronounced malty taste and a little less of the alcoholic “bite.” Everything else was delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice imperial stout with well balanced flavors, great appearance and mouth feel"
"Terrific example of the style..."
""
""
""
""
""
"The only reason I didn't give it 5s across the board is because the smell, while good, wasn't as aggressive as it should have been. This is as good a beer as I've had in a good, long time."
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow, a great mix of smooth flavours with a lingering bitter finish. A really satisfying beer that is a great sipper. Once again Sierra Nevada impresses."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: There are a lot of really nice elements in this beer; I would prefer more chocolate and a fuller mouthfeel but those are minor issues"
""
"O - It's definitely bold in both a flavor way as well as in the booze. It's a good sipper for sure."
""
""
""
""

"Deep dark black and big fluffy head. All sorts of stringy patches cover the glass once it recedes. Aroma initially brings creamy sweetness. Then digging deeper there's caramel, tobacco, coffee, toffee, and a touch of something like black raspberry. Pretty straight forward Russian imperial style. Taste is milky caramel, chocolatey, a bit smokey, and bitter only subtly through the finish. Mouthfeel is key. Very velvety smooth. Like hot cocoa in beer form and cool of course. The higher ABV is totally hidden as well. I haven't been in a stout-porter/dark beer mood for awhile however this beer might be changing that."

" A very nice Stout that is easy to put a pint down."

"O - One of the better stouts I have had. Well done Sierra Nevada!"
""

"This is quite nice. While not incredibly complex, the flavors mesh very well and are properly proportioned. The mouthfeel is great. This is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice imperial stout, but nothing too mind-blowing. I will be sitting a few down for some aging."

"UPDATE 2/4/14: Had another from the same fourpack and it was very smooth with more dark chocolate and less smoky taste, Some chocolate also in the aroma. The more I do these comparisons bottle to bottle of the same aged beer, the more I am convinced that it is difficult to predict how some will react to aging, and in fact they may react differently from one bottle to another. Doesn't seem to make much sense, and perhaps it's my own senses that are varying, but I find quite a difference sometimes among bottles in the same pack. (Lagunitas Brown Shugga and Brooklyn's now discontinued Monster come most immediately to mind). In any case I'm raising my ratings based on this second bottle. a: from 4-4.25; s from 3.5-4; mouthfeel from 4-4.25. And overall from 3.75-4."

"O-Not a bad brew, honestly not my favorite for the style, booze is pretty apparent. Interesting to try"
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma: thick, rich chocolate malts, black grains, subtle smoke, coffee bean oil and resin. Appearance: pitch black with fantastic lacing. Taste: smooth, velvety thick roasted chocolate, burnt caramel, continuous coffee, toasted bread, plums and red grapes. Overall, amazing alcohol finish smooth full bodied and rich"
""
""
"Really amazing imperial stout; quite different from other stouts I've had"
""
""
"Note: 2013 vintage"
""
""
"Narwhal pours a black color with a small tan lacing head. There is a boozy aroma with hints of licorice. The taste is very bold, lots of coffee, chocolate, and some black licorice flavors, with a big boozy end. Very bold flavors great body. Overall a fantastic big bold stout."
"Overall: Wow. Serious yum. I'll be seeking more. It's a monster with a friendly face. You note alcohol, but it doesn't taste like the 10% it's swinging. A nice long evening sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good RIS. Loads of flavor and complex. A bit too sticky."
"O: This is a really nice big stout - the alcohol is well hidden but this is definitely a sipping beer (and best served on a cold autumn/winter evening by the fireplace). Nice roasty flavors but a little ashy so folks that don't enjoy that would be better off not grabbing this one."
""

""
""
""

"An outstanding and delicious imperial stout. Superb chocolaty and coffee flavors. a smell that doesn't disappoint. Rich and smooth. Perhaps my favorite beer from SN. What can I say? I love this style, and Sierra Nevada delivers on my high standards for stouts. Will make this a regular in my rotation, along with Ten Fidy, FBS, FIS, and others. Well done."
""
""
""
"O - Very solid RIS. Bittersweet, creamy chocolate is abundant. I remember it being a lot more roasty and boozy fresh. Definitely something to age."

"O-Glad I picked up a four pack instead of just a single. Now I can compare it to the Old Rasputin which is another favorite RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really Impressed by this beer. Really dug the darker fruit and chocolate notes. Excited to see where this goes in a yea or 2."
""
"Black as night, no light gets through. Smell is a slight mix of coffee, chocolate, and toffee, slightly burnt. Taste is similar and the mouth feel is lighter than expected for an imperial stout and more carbonated. In this style, I prefer a flatter beer. I really like it though, a definite A-, but I don't think it quite lives up to the other world-class beers in this style. But hey, it's a cheaper and a great runner-up if you want to save a couple of bucks."

"Overall this was an awesome imperial stout I see why it rated so highly. Very boozy but it has some great flavors and aromas. I feel like this would be perfect to age, definitely putting some away."
""
"Jet black oil with a dark tan head. The smell is of a plain stout, but hides all the flavor to come. The taste is a rich cocoa coffee. Mouth feel is of light weight oil that hides the high octane it carries. This is an outstanding stout that could be called a coffee stout. Sierra Nevada has one that I will never turn down. Try this one and you will be pleased. once again thanks to the mind!"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): A great Russian Imperial Stout that fires on all cylinders. It's not brewed with any additives–no coffee. No oats. No cacao nibs or chocolate added. No bourbon barrel aging. Sierra Nevada proves with Narwhal that complexity can be gained through great craftsmanship just as it can be gotten through adding complementary ingredients."
""
""
"A decent beer overall, I could see this being a go-to Imperial Stout. Worth aging just a touch to see what happens."
""
"I love the straight-up stout feel for this one, big roasty dark malts and alcohol with low sweetness (ala Old Rasputin, Ten FIDY, etc.) Definitely worthy of a 4-pack purchase every year - drink 2, age 2."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Accessible. SN's not going too crazy with this, and that's probably a good thing. Still definitely worthwhile, and very reasonably priced for the category. Sic this on your friends when they talk about Guinness being ""oh so dark""- they'll be pleasantly surprised rather than sickened."

"I really enjoyed this and it is available at a decent price. I don't think I'd pick this over ten fidy or stone RIS though ."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: if its on the shelf....grab it!"
"O: Not a big fan of the mouthfeel on this one. I don't know what to say about this one. It's not really appealing to me. Not a big fan of the flavors here. Nothing compared to the BA version. Good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a bold, flamboyant imperial stout whose gusto may be too great for its own good. The spicy booze masks what is actually a quite nice roasted, chocolate malt flavor. I could see myself drinking it again, but for a style brimming with superior beers, this is only above-average at best."
""
""
"Overall: Finally got to have my first Narwhal, and I'm happy to say that it lived up to its reputation of being a great stout, worth the $10/4pk price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A drinkable brew that does not hide its 10%, but still manages to be quite drinkable. Suggests many of the qualities of a barrel aged imperial stout, which is a real trick since it was not. The alcohol does cloud somewhat the complexity below, so I cannot say it is the best imperial stout I've had, but it is a good one. A very good one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.5 - Fantastic. Sierra Nevada just doesn't disappoint. I bet you could go through the gallery of beers that didn't make it out their door because they didn't measure up to their standards and find a bunch of great beers. Because the ones that make it out the door are just flat professional. These guys are master craftsmen. Their way is not the flashy way - it's the balanced, understated way, which delivers top quality humbly. Their touch is so deft and delicate."
""
""
""
"A superior Imperial Stout I hope to enjoy again for years to come."

"Overall, this is a solid RIS. Definitely one of the more extreme examples, but a great one for those who love huge stouts."

"Nothing to write home about, really; just a nice, aggressive double stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit boozy, which holds this back from being great. I've had higher ABV beers that have hidden their ABV much better. Still decent, but with all of the other great imperial stouts out there, I probably won't get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a very well put together and nice imperial stout. Not at all too sweet and the alcohol is barely detectable. An awesome, and affordable, imperial stout from Sierra Nevada."
""
"O-I wish SN would do more malt forward beers like this, one of their best. If you love imperial stouts this is a must have."
"Velvety black in color. Poured with a short dark tan foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Dark roasted malt and powdery dark chocolate aromas with ripe dark fruit and delicate hop notes. Thick, rich, viscous feel with subdued carbonation through the middle. Dark roasted malt flavors first followed by dark chocolate. Sweetness malt and chocolate is quickly overcome by bitter dark roasted coffee and pine hop bitterness. Finishes with a tangy, bitter, pine hip aftertaste with u.derlying dark roasted malt. Beautiful color, delicate aromas, and a rollercoaster of sweet and bitter flavors. "
"O - What a cracking beer for the price. Took Old Rasputin to the cleaners. Did a good job of civilising its 10% Abv which always wins brownie points with me. I was concerned I might be overpowered by this beer a I was recently by Rochefort 10 but this was not the case. Underrated."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't ""just another"" Russian imperial stout to me. It has some of the aroma notes and flavors of a Belgian strong dark ale, but still retains all the essential requirements for retaining stout status. And all of it's distinctive qualities mesh together beautifully. Not to mention it kind of has the consistency and taste of a chocolate milkshake, to my delight. Just as a Narwhal is a unique whale, but still a whale, this is a unique stout, but still very much a stout... and a very nice one."

"Overall: Pretty solid RIS by the boys from Stone. Might have to move up to their 22 RIS and the espresso version as well. This beer definitely got better as it warmed up too."
""
"Overall: Narwhal, while not particularly rare, was somewhat of a whale for me. It's been hyped quite a bit by both the internet, and a few friends of mine, and it did not disappoint. I'd really like to taste it back to back with Old Rasputin and Stone Imperial Stout. Regardless, it's a fantastic brew I'd recommend to any fan of the genre."

""
""
"Poured pitch black into generic snifter with small brown head. Aroma is roasty chocolate, and more roasted chocolate. Flavor follows with bittersweet chocolate and a very nice roasted finish. Extremely smooth with just the right carbonation. Thick but easy drinking. Like velvet. I would compare this closely with Oaked Yeti, with less sweetness and more bittersweet. This is a phenomenal brew feom SN. Easily rank this above some of the more hyped impies. I really can’t find anything wrong with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"A supremely righteous Russian Imperial Stout. Chewy, STRONG, and delicious. Tons of coffee and chocolate right up front. Complex, multi-blend of 6 different malts. The only con would be the strength of the alcohol coming through but that is forgivable given the greatness of this brew. You will be hard-pressed to find a better example of this beer. Enjoy and cheers!"

""
""
""
"Overall, the high abv kind of scared me away....and at first your like wow this is boozy but im loving how that is taken over in the end for a really smooth finish.take your time drinking this and enjoy it... this is a big, deep beer."
""
""
""
""
"Don't get me wrong, this is a very solid stout/porter, but not quite up to the level of luxury and complexity of something like an Expedition Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a very enjoyable RIS, as I like boozy stouts, though I could see how some might think this is too hot. Looking forward to see how this changes with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep, dark black color with a lean tan head that drops to a luscious, creamy covering. Smells dark and malty...spicy fruit, licorice, molasses, and a slight oxidized/aged aroma in back. Somewhat rich, but definitely big and roasty malt flavor. Char, cocoa, espresso, and dark fruity esters. Again, a particular spiciness permeates the flavor along with a heavy bitterness in the finish. Booze is thankfully low, though there is an expected warming deep down in the throat. Big bodied and creamy, but dry. I liked this a bit more during the first half, but the bitterness is becoming a little distracting. A solid RIS that I think is worthy of aging a couple more bottles for longer to see what happens."
"Not as heavily bodied as I thought it would be but a pretty good beer. I expected a bit more from sierra, but it's a pretty standard imp stout. Faintly creamy, bitter black chocolate, dark roast coffee, herbal hop, low astringency, bitter malts and bitter hops finishes dry. Overall good, clean tasting, on the heavier side of medium bodied, lingering burnt coffee, black chocolate and earthy hop flavors. A touch soapy and minty."
""

"Narwhal is destined to become a top value imperial stout, widely available and of high quality. Compares very favorably with Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout in that regard. Another great beer by Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty, well balanced and enjoyable imperial stout. Would definitely drink again."
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer, but definitely on the less sweet side of imperial stouts. It's still quite drinkable if that's what you like."
""
""
"Final Thoughts - $12 bucks IS high for a 4 pack but at a 10.2% and the taste, why the heck not?!!??!"
""
""
"O: great imperial stout, rich flavors"

"I've only had this beer once before, last fall. Remember enjoying it a lot more then than now. This seemed a bit uninspired. Nothing offensive about it, just a bit bland really. A bit disappointing. Does go down easy for a 10.2abv."
""
"O - I wanted to let this age a little more but I suppose I got a little excited with the weather cooling down so much at night these days. I will definitely let the last bottle I have lay down for a some months. Good stout but not as great as I was expecting."

""
""

""
""
""

"Dark black in body with creamy tan head that floats on top for the duration of the drink. Aroma of roast, dark chocolate, dirt, and cocoa powdered mint leaves. Flavors aren't as aggressive as I thought they'd be: fluffy chocolate mousse, roasted malt leads to dirt, some tobacco towards the end. Milky body with light carbonation. A smooth stout that masks the big booze well behind layers of cocoa and crushed autumn leaves. Dangerously easy to keep picking up over and over again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, this review is for the 2013 batch as I forgot to review the 2012 which I actually thought was better. Dark black, brown healthy head. Aroma is alcohol, roast malt, not bad at all. Flavor is alcohol, dark malts, fruit, mild notes of chocolate. Overall pretty good but a little astringent for my liking,"
""
""
""
"As stated in previous reviews, the alcohol presence is obvious and certainly detracts from this stout's potential. A bit of a disappointment."

"O: This could be my biggest letdown of 2013. It had many things going for it to be topnotch - SN's reputation, well received on BA, inexpensive - but in the end was nearly ruined by the generic harshness. My other bottles are going in the cellar; there's a very good RIS underneath this all, and aging it may be exactly what the doctor ordered."
""
""
""
"Very much like Old Rasputin, which isn't my favorite RIS. I like them sweeter than this. The simplistic aroma is the weak spot, here. But at this price point, I'll drink this regularly. Wish there were more chocolate and/or vanilla involved."
""
""
""
""
""
"Because of my disappointment pls refer to my numerical ratings rather than a written breakdown of this beer. I will leave you with this thought. Sierra Nevada has gotten larger and as a result only bottle conditions the pale ale and a few seasonals. However, this conditioning in the bottle is what made their products really pop and highlighted the craftsmanship and quality. Simply put, this company's beers cease to be interesting since they have stopped bottle conditioning."
""
""
""
"O: I dont love this one, kind of a weird flavor profile. I expect it to get much better with age and will revisit this in a few months."
""
""
"I was slightly disappointed in the Narwhal. Whether you consider it a Russian Imperial Stout (Beer Advocate), an Imperial Stout (Sierra Nevada and Rate Beer), neither lived up to what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended Vertical: Fresh to 1 year (Both vintages worthy; age 1 bottle, drink 3)"
""
""
"Utterly black, the ale is thick and intense. It has a thin, light-brown head, with an intense smell and a heavy alcohol punch. The smell is of licorice, wood, fleeting smoke, and booze-soaked raisins. The taste is very dry...and very bitter. The bitterness begins in the foretaste, combined with an immediate intense warming. Lots of alcohol. Roasty flavors...bitterness and some woody resin-like characteristics. Full in body...luxurious and heavy. This is one powerful brew, in almost every sense of the word."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love imperial Stouts and the narwhal is probably one of my favorite. might even be better than old rasputin, but as all intelligent beer drinkers know they only way to tell how good a stout really is, is by having it on tap. Until that time i'm surprised how well it tastes out of the bottle. Definitely will have to buy it again if i can find it"

"Luckily once it hits my lips, all concerns aroused by the aroma are put to rest. Beyond the silky smoothe mouthfeel contrasted by tiny pinpricks of carbonation, there is a an inital sweet dark cocoa note that fades into more of the char and roasty malts before finishing bitter as bakers chocolate. Excellently blended, and immenently smoothe on the palate. This is another extremely well done beer from a reliable brewery, and one that I am excited to see how it transforms as it ages. Go and buy it if it's available in your area, it is WELL worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good, solid beer. Definitely should give it a try. It looks as if will be my highest rating for a Sierra Nevada beer, knocking off SNPA. I will definitely be buying this again. And also aging a bottle."

"O - Great RIS. Excited to set up a verticle."
""

"O: The smokiness is a little strong, but otherwise I really enjoyed this beer. I'm a bit dismayed that I forgot to pick up a 4-pack before I left; the price point is pretty good."
""
""
""
"Overall- First time I've seen it, and its tasty. Not the best RIS but a very good one that would make an excellent entry to the style as it hits all the right points, but could be more complex. I could see myself grabbing some more, maybe even to age for a while."

"This is an offering that is way out of balance and a big disappointment considering I generally have a profound affection for SN beers."
""

"Drinkability is ok, this is a big, brash, old school RIS. I like the fact that it's all malt and not hoppy, but it's too hot."
""
""
""
""
"Dark black like crude oil. Even the minimal layer of head is tinged black. The nose is very appealing dark roasted barley. This is not to be taken lightly. Mouthfeel is silky and thick. Dark roasted barley, treacle, and molasses. This might be better in February rather than the middle of August. This is a real treat for imperial stout lovers like myself. A must try!"

"O: Can't believe its a 10.2 % beer, first sip seemed like I was drinking a nice smooth roasty chocolaty oatmeal stout. Will be buying this again, especially for its price. Definitely a hard choice between this and Old Raspy... Need to do a side by side but highly recommend this beer. Prime example of why Sierra Nevada is as great as they are."

"This one is legit. Malt and stout heads should seek it out. Nothing but praise."

"O - Great beer. Definitely up there with Stone Imperial Russian Stout. Not as good as Stone Espresso Russian Imperial Stout or Oskar Blues Ten Fidy. For the price (8-9 dollars a four pack) this could be a great winter beer if I still lived back in Michigan, but I'll drink it in the Arizona heat too. I'll have to try Old Rasputin again to compare, but for the price from what I remember this could very well be a permanent replacement for it."

"Dense, dense, dense. Marshmallowy with a harsh bite on it. This'll sound like a swipe but it's a ""managable"" RIS. Kinda mean, little heavy. But I should've had this colder."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Big stout with a really chewy body. Excellent night cap. One bottle would be fine for sharing with someone else. I can see how with more time, if the sweet malty notes keep coming out, this could turn into some almost port like material. Curious to try one again in six months and see how it's progressed."
""
"Has a jet black appearance with a finger length dark mocha head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick lacing. Smells of lots of bittersweet chocolate, good amount of coffee, nice roasted element to it, some oak, molasses, maybe some dark fruit as it warms. Taste starts with the bittersweet chocolate and molasses. Then in the middle, a huge dose of roastiness comes through from the roasted barley, along with more molasses. Then the finish is more of the roasted flavors, almost like a smokiness, along with lots of bittersweet chocolate, more molasses, some coffee or expresso, a tiny bit of hop presence, get some fig as well. Definite alcohol presence on the finish as well, but does not detract from the other flavors. Pretty full body with a sticky and creamy mouthfeel. Decent amount of carbonation that livens up the body of the beer. This will age nicely. Nothing too flashy, but a solid imperial stout at an affordable price."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"Dark roasted malt flavor, medium body, notable clarity and overall thinness. Thin tan head, hints of soy sauce and mild bitterness. I tested this beer in a selection of a dozen stouts and it was near the bottom of my list."

"Overall this is good. Personally, I enjoyed it more fresh, but could also be better with more time on it as well."
"Overall: if any United States-based brewery was going to produce an exceptional Russian Imperial Stout, I would have put my money on Sierra Nevada. The outcome is a rousing success - rich and complex in flavour, full in body and with a fantastic drinkability. One of the best Russian Imps I have had to date."

"Overall/Comments: This is a very fine representation of the style that is robust and very complex. Does a good job masking the alcohol. May pick up a few of these to put away. Classified as a Russian Imperial Stout @ 10.2 ABV. Consumed 2/26/13."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Rich and full with equally strong malt and hops character; simply an excellent beer. I'm hoping this will be easy to find than Night Stalker where I live because Narwhal is running neck and neck with it as my favorite Imperial Stout. There will have to be a side by side tasting to for me to call a winner though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just like most of what Sierra Nevada does, they have set a standard for the style. When I think of an RIS, this is exactly what I expect it to look, smell, and taste like. Just a perfect example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A fantastic stout from SN with the standard roasted coffee and chocolate flavors, with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Nice bit of alcohol warmth as well despite it being quite drinkable."

"The elusive Narwhal, this is 2012 brewed according to the coding system they use it's bottled on 2285210:23 that's 2012 285th day on the 2nd bottling line at 10:23 am. I couldn't pass this up even though they had fresh Hoptimum I sided with the Narwhal since I hadn't yet tried this imperial stout. Pours with a black velvet smooth texture, pitch black body fills up my Stone Imperial Russian Stout glass nicely. Big smooth creamy texture mocha tan head follows the body with fine speckled lacing, this beer has some legs as I swirl it around in the chalice. Aromatics are killer dark ripened vinous fruit notes with dark chocolate and roasted coffee, it's an excellent combination brewed in this glass. Even some brown sugar/molasses like malt character kicking in with subdued earthy hops well hidden by the roasted qualities of black patent malts. The perceived sweetness comes off as dark partially fermented cherries or plump juicy raisins or a combination of those two fruits, but there is a fruity sharp sherry character going on here. Flavor rides a wave of those dark malts but has a surprisingly sharp sweet slightly salty breathe of ocean quality, maybe a bit of soy sauce that I get from some imperial stouts...it's not overkill but a nice dose of something to offset the dark malts acrid roasted malt character. Definitely sweet cherry hidden in there with well blended alcohol, caramelized brown sugar, earthy herbal hops in the backend with some added bitterness bitter dark chocolate and hints of espresso bean reach the palate as well. Like I said initially this is a killer complex ale, full bodied even smooth carbonation it's a joy to have on the palate with each sip cleansing any lingering harshness away it's drinkability is downright dangerous one of the biggest easiest drinking imperial stouts I've ever come across."
""
""
"This beast pours a pitch black with a thin layer of foam. Aromas of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate and a sharp espresso dominate. The flavor has a hop forward bitterness as well as the coffee and espresso characteristics. An earthy mushroom taste develops as it opens as well as some soy sauce characteristics. The body is sharp but somewhat off balance. I get a dark chocolate flavor and sharpness, when what I want is more velvety smoothness to ease such a rich brew along. While it holds up to warming it is still hot with a noticeable alcohol presence. It strikes me as having some rough edges that could be softened with a little more time to rest."

"This beer is very carbonated, must be what keeps it from bogging down. It is medium-heavy bodied. Leaves a light coating on the tongue."

""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a nice dark color with 1 finger of tan head. The aroma of this beer is quite delicious. However, the flavors do not come together well and it is a bit boozy. Worth a try but don't expect much. I won't be buying this again."
"Poured into a snifter. Color was a very dark completely opaque brown, with a nice light brown 1 finger head. Didn't last long, but had a bit of side cling. Aroma was slightly sweet a bit of lactose, with some smokey grain as well. Flavor was smokey, but not overly so. A tad of dark mocha flavor finished up in the mouth. Felt great in the mouth. Coated nicely, just a bit of carbonation. A tad to much acid in the back of the tongue was the only downside. Overall, a great stout. Well balanced, nice and thick."
""
""
"O - Pretty good Imperial Stout, nice flavor profile and aroma. Could use a little more body and maybe a little of that woodiness from the scent in the taste. Would be willing to have again, and certainly gets you feeling good."

"A nice Impy stout here, would I grab it over Expidition, FIS or old raspy? Probably not, will I buy atleast a 4 pack every year when it comes out.... For sure!"

"This beer poured up a deep obsidian black with a lucious black appearance, one to one and a half finger foamy head, and lots of spotty lacing left behind. Smell is coffee, roasted nuts, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is pretty much the same as the smell. There is a sweet maltiness that is pretty well balanced by the taste of coffee, roasted nuts, a smoky flavor, and alcohol. The finish is a little too hot for my taste. This is not bad as you'd expect from a Sierra Nevada product, but it is nowhere near as good as Ten Fidy or Ol' Raspy."
""
""
""
"O - Balanced. Half a beer would be good for me. The true test is a full pour. Do you like the beer as much at the end as you did at the beginning? This beer did not pass that test."
""
""
"O: Flavor is dominated by dark chocolate. Smells much better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I must say this one disappoints me, run of the mill RIS. I don't think I would buy this again, unless there was a hell of a deal. I'm just looking for stronger notes and this isn't the beer for them. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Damn good. A little too boozy young, but some age might do this some good. Also, the cut on the roof of my mouth might be causing issues."
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell had much more chocolate. Same great brew."
"The feel is thick, rich and robust. Somehow very heavy isn't too heavy for this beer, as it doesn't just sit on the palate or weigh it down. Instead, it moves very nicely, with a downright velvety creaminess on the tongue through every sip. There's a crisp nip that doesn't get too much in the way."

"2012 version that has been sitting in my fridge since November. Poured into a snifter this brew comes out of the bottle looking like motor oil topped with a dark tan thick head 1 finger wide with good lacing. Aromas of chocolate and roasted malt. Fairly simple but delicious. Taste is also chocolately with some nice roasted slightly bitter malt. A rather thick yet smooth mouthfeel. Really clean for a 10%+ beer. This is a fantastic RIS. Favorite beer from Sierra Nevada"
""
""
""
""
""
"[O] For whatever reason, Narwhal performs a little better out of the bottle than it did on draft two months ago. It was really underwhelming at that point. Today, while a bit better, it still isn't as good as some regularly available high gravity stouts, like Yeti, for example."
""
""
""
"O - An ok RIS but there are far better examples. Not sure why its ""exceptional"" Would rather the Sam Smiths or Courage over this one"

"overall, i was a bit underwhelmed in the grand scheme of things when sampling this. perhaps a bit of age would benefit this? or maybe i'm just let down with the overall nose and flavour profile. the interaction between malt and yeast leaves me wanting despite the bitter hop blast, which i was expecting. an egnigma...nonetheless, it's a tasty treat that has potential in the cellar."
""
"Overall, I wouldn't buy this again. It's exemplary of the mediocre rut SN's beers can sometimes fall into. They're capable of better in my eyes. In my needs for an imperial stout, there's no need for me to return to this one. However, it's not terrible and what will save it are the leagues of SN fans."

"Review is from written notes. Dark aggressively black-brown pour with mocha foam. Smells loaded with semi-sweet chocolate, crispy toast, lightly burnt coffee. Very nice. Taste follows with thick dense toast and biscuit, char, heavily roasted coffee, baker's chocolate, dark dried cherries. Medium heavy body, creamy mouthfeel. Enjoyable and a nice RIS from Sierra Nevada."

"Served on tap at the Falling Rock. Appearance is opaque black with generous finger of head and heavy lacing that leaves layers behind. Smell is dry and roasty with dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and grain. Taste is deep and roasty with light sweetness, heavy cocoa and coffee character at the end. Nice well rounded stout. Mouthfeel is heavy with medium carbonation. Overall, a very solid offering from Sierra Nevada."

"O- Great mouthfeel, but not one of my favorite imperial stouts. Pretty boozy and the sour finish is odd."
"Dark brown with a low beige head that settles out quickly. Inviting aroma of cocoa and espresso, some raisin. Rich flavors upfront, dark chocolate, espresso, root beer, molasses, smoke and leather, some rough-edged roasty malt, sharp bitterness, interesting mix of flavors. Full mouthfeel, but slightly tannic and warming. Good beer."
""
"Overall – A nice, big and roasty, stout that is on the drier ad thicker side. When in the mode for a great. not too sweet, sipping Imperial stout, then this is a great one to go to."
""
"A funny thing happened last night while I was consuming Narwhal - I came to the sad realization that I really have no place in my cellar for a RIS not aged in some sort of barrel. Narwhal brings the heavy roast, chocolate, very dry, roasted and charred malts. It's just been done, and it's boring to me now. This would have been a great addition to the lineup in 2005, but it does nothing for me now."
""
""
""
"That overall harshness hurt drinkability a great deal. I had a tough time finishing my 12oz. Overall, while a decent brew, this isn't the Old Rasputin killer SN has seemed to position it as. I won't be having it again, I'll just buy a 4pack of the smooth, even, nearly flawless Raspy."
"Mouthfeel is as smooth and rich as you could expect at this abv. Overall an excellent RIS. Well work a try."
""
""
""
""
"This one is near the top of my list as I get more and more into stouts. The abv being where it's at is almost indistinguishable. This is one I'll revisit when I go for more stouts, just as a constant when I try others."
""
"D: This had great looks and body, but the scent and taste weren't as impressive. It was hot and unrefined, so it wasn't very easy to drink. Maybe age will help tame this beast, but fresh is kind of rough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was not let down, and I was definitely given a unique experience. I will drink this beer again!"
""
"Deep brown with a mocha head. Good retention and lacing. Malty and roasty aroma... somewhat campfire like. Taste is more aggressive with a solid kick of bitterness derived from both, hops and roasted malt. Long burnt finish. Medium body, apt carbonation. Will drink again."

""
""
""
""

"Overall quite a lovely beer. I'd definitely have this again, wish they'd import it properly."

"O: Glad to have caught this big fish. A great imperial stout. Another winner from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm beginning to like this genre more and more. This is one of the better offerings I have recently. Will partake again!"
"Absolutely outstanding"
""
""
"Taste is indeed rich, but oh-so-smooth. More of the roasty, charred chocolate, with some fruit near the finish. The 10.2% ABV is well-hidden here, and this is an exceptionally smooth and satisfying imperial stout. Outstanding."
""
""
""
"While it may not be the greatest imperial stout out there, it is still a damn good one and one that must be tried."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I really enjoy this RIS. Really nice flavor and body."
""
""
"O - One of the smoothest and drinkable Russian Imperial Stout I have had. A definite must try."
""
"luckily I have my bro and his current girl to help me out with this growldog, cause otherwise I am taking a trip to passoutville. damn, this is one deep dark sucker, maybe not my fave RIS but it is bold, any RIS fan needs to check this out, it might be the spanish fly to your.. well.."
"Poured a deep black with a nice two finger, creamy head. The aroma had a perfect balance of dark chocolate and coffee notes with hints of dark fruit and licorice. The flavor followed with a balanced earthy hops against a background of mocha and notes of vanilla and dates. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Rich, deep, and balanced. Nothing super complex, but perfect balance. Excellent standard example of the style."
"O - a very good example of the style."
"Trying it side-by-side with a Baltic porter, albeit an unique one like 3Beans, confirms that I prefer this style. While there will always be a place in time for the porters that can traverse the oceans, I can begin to imagine what the Russian Czars came to expect from the stouts sent their way."

"O- Good beer, just had a not-so-great flavor aftertaste. But was worth it, would get again."
"D - Strong on the burnt bold flavors but still complex. Nicely done."
"Overall this is an excellent non barrel aged imperial stout by Sierra Nevada that is well worth seeking out. I just wish I had more."
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic Imperial Stout, though it should be noted that it’s not for the faint of heart. This is mostly due to the tobacco ash and black malt notes, since at times they were so powerful that I felt like I had a mouthful of cigar smoke – especially in the aftertaste. But for fans of the style, there’s really not much else one could want in this beer, except perhaps some barrel aging. I did find the mouthfeel more watery than I would have expected, but almost everything else in here is excellent. Well worth trying."
"Great balance in the finish, deftly pairing strong roasted grain with a thick and full malty body. Alcohol is well hidden behind this very solid malty RIS. This is a straight shooter that doesn't fool around with quirky flavors and nails the balance of drinkability just right."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is heavy to medium heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a slightly foamy, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel. Only minor ethanol is felt in the nostrils and back of throat. Closes fairly dry, with modest stickiness across the palate."
""
"I most certainly will drink more of this!"
""
""
"O- Very nice beer. I really enjoyed this. Taste wasn't superb though. Might like to get another bottle and age it."
"Although one thing I'm not entirely keen on is this: I can't think of the name of this beer without thinking of ""Rock Lobster"" by the B-52's."
""
"A beer like this should make you re-evaluate why you spend $10 on a bomber of imperial stout that probably isn't as good as this."
"O- Maybe the best smelling beer i have ever had. I really had high hopes for it based on the aroma. Unfortunately, the beer took a step back in the flavor. Maybe my expectations were that this would be on the same level with other imperial stouts as Old Rasputin from North Coast, but it is a step or two below that in my opinion. I can expect some alcohol presence with an abv of 10%, but it was a little too boozy for my taste. None the less, still a good beer, but just a little underachieving in my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
"Off my first sip, I can tell that this is a beer that would benefit from some aging. Bright berry tones seem to show quite large with a lot of malty sweetness. Mild roasted thing going on too. Extremely smooth feel. Excellent level of carbonation. Way too easy to drink for a 10.2% beer. Definitely a good brew. I'd get a case and let them rest for 1-2 years, if I was going to invest the coin."
""
""
"Overall- Above-average, good-tasting double stout that comes with fairly complex flavors. But it's running rather hot and I think some age will do it some good. I'll stash a few away for next winter. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A damn fine imperial stout. I'd buy one of these for the same price as the 4 pack."

"This is an amazing imperial stout from sierra nevada. It is a very complex brew. This is actually my first imperial stout , and I'm in love with it. The color is amazing: pitch black, very dark. The smell is awesome, chocolate and coffee are the most predominant ingredients I can smell. The taste is amazing with a delicious chocolate after taste. It is not as strong as I was expecting. I highly recommend it!"

"I knew this would improve with time !! So much better now then when it first came out in nov(?). Pours thick and dark, no light, soft edgy lacing. Smell is slight in my Duval Tulip but the flavor burst's. There's vanilla here, sweet dark malt, and everything I want in a beer. Roasty coffee bitterness, cascade (and maybe willamette) hops. The rest of these will sit in basement till next winter. Perfect for 15 degrees."
""
"Had this from a bottle into a tulip glass. Good beer, great example of the style. It pours black, no light coming through. There is no head (but a more vigorous pour might produce one). Taste is lovely, everything you would want from an RIS. There is a noticeable, but not overwhelming, smell of alcohol that comes at the end of each sip. I personally don't mind this, but the alcohol is more aggressive than some other beers of the same style. I'm interested in how it ages (if any of mine can survive that long."
""
""
""
"The appearance is near black with an oily beige head. The aroma offers dark roast, full bodied coffee, molasses. The flavor follows suit. Thick and rich. A touch of dark fruit. Big time dark chocolates and a touch of cacao bitterness. Palate coating with moderate carbonation. Zesty finish. A really nice example of the style."

"a rich and creamy full body, slight alcohol warmth, mild carbonation. as the beer warms up, it develops more and more. i love drinks like this because they can last you a good amount of a night, tasting different every 5 minutes. you can barely taste or smell the alcohol. really bitter for a stout, which makes this one right up my alley."
"Medium body, with soft carbonation and a bit of a creamy feel. A bit of warmth, but not very much for the strength of this beer. I love the roasted, bittersweet feel of this beer. Very well done."
""
"O: What a great beer for the cold months! Would definitely recommend."
"I felt like this worked out as a very good sipper in the evening. I would like to get more bottles for aging."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. In the aroma, dry coffee and notes of chocolate. In the taste, dry coffee and a chocolate malt that rides all the way through. A small bite and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and roasty coffee in the aftertaste. Big coffee, nice chocolate notes, and hides the alcohol."
""
"O: All around an excellent example of RIS. Nothing is lacking. It is bold and very flavorful, but you dont' have to struggle through a glass. Very complex with lots of varying flavors and aromas to ponder. I'd love to age a few to see wha they're like in a few years."
"O- One of the better Sierra Nevada brews. I could drink this quite often. This is not my favorite style but I enjoyed this beer very much."

"This is a pretty darn good stout. I was hoping it was going to be good enough to compliment that awesome label and it did. No extreme to it to separate it from the pack, but it goes on the list of super solid imperial stouts."
""
""
"Overall: A beer that's tastes good, is priced well, and is reasonably accessible. Sierra Nevada does good tasting value packed beers as well as anyone."

"Pours a midnight black with a chocolate creamy three finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is cocoa,dark coffee,dark malts and booze,the mouthfeel is full bodied,creamy and moderately carbonated and has tastes of dark cocoa,black coffee,turkish delight,vanilla and finished with a bitter hoppy finish and overall this a massive stout and definately the night cap i was looking for will buy again cheers."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Lovely beige head, good retention, on a black body, soapy and sticky lacing. Aroma includes roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, toffee, licorice, some alcohol and chocolate. Mouthfeel is lush with high viscosity. Taste includes notes from all of the aforementioned aromas. A ton of flavor packed in the liquid, slightly warming but also quite fresh. Purely delicious...what else could you expect from the crew in Chico?"
"O – This is a nice imperial stout. The dark fruit and chocolate sweetness is nicely balanced with the bitter roasted malt. It’s also ridiculously drinkable considering the high ABV. I’m glad I got to try this one out."
"An excellent beer for a windy cold night such as this. The weather's getting worse, the night's getting better."
""
""
""
"Big roasted malt chewy mouth up front explodes across the palate with coffee notes and leaves a chocolate coating. The nose was small, but the flavor is huge. The alcohol is not noticeable until it warms your belly, but the flavors are heavy with a thick and chewy mouth. Plumb and raisin, and rum come out in the back end almost hidden. One of the best imperial stouts I've had."
"O - SN knocks it out of the park on this one (as usual). The smell is a bit lackluster, but everything else top notch here."
"O: SN Narwahl RIS is a very complex and enjoyable, sweet, strong stout. It packs a ton of flavor into that 10.2% ABV while not slowing you down with too hot of a hop or alcohol burn. Perfect beer to serve as dessert or to accompany a raspberry chocolate torte. I'd love to try it again, or one of it's aged varietals."
"""Goodbye Mr. Narwhal."""
""
"(O)- This is one solid stout. Personally, I do prefer my stouts less in the hop level, but this one has enough deep and rich flavors to mask and balance that out, and that is how the style can traditionally be. Definitely would be curious to see what some time will do to this one."
"O - Well done SN, well done. Continually impressed with how this beer comes alive as it warms."
""

"O: just a big, bold brew that has a terrific balance. and is a perfect fireside beer. One of the best offereings that I have had from Sierra Nevada."
""

""
"Overall its not as bad as say fresh Old Rasputin but it's still very strong with the ashy roast and hop aspect. If I was able to find older bottles of this or age them myself for a year this beer would be quite exceptional. Glad I don't love it since I passed on a second bottle."

"Impenetrable black with a deep brown head. Creamy retention and a whole load of lace. Nose of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, carmel, dark fruit liqueur notes. Light anise and a bit of alcohol. Relatively sweet, but spot on for what I enjoy in imperial stouts. Taste has heavy dark roasted character, dark chocolate, light tar, charcoal with some back end sweetness to prevent everything from getting away. Full feel, some alcohol warmth. Medium low carbonation. This do es well as is and could be great with some time."
"Age for years and I plan on aging a few. Interested how it will change."
""
"Mouthfeel: it's at the height of my viscosity tolerance level. It's not very carbonated, but it tingles the tongue nicely. It's more drinkable than many of the other Imperial Stouts. Some imp stouts I have a hard time drinking 12oz... I can finish this one, which is a plus in my book."
""
"O: A good RIS, not the best I've ever had, but solid. I would recommend it."
"O: I've always loved SNPA so I may be a bit biased towards SN products in general, but this is an excellent beer. While I have yet to taste some of the harder-to-find stouts talked about on BA, I imagine that this beer measures up quite well, especially given its availability."
""
""
""
"This one was rich and tasty. The alcohol snuck up on me at the tail end, but this one was one I enjoyed through and through. I hope to see this around often, as I would like to have stock of this one at all times."
""
""
""
""
"O – A great RIS, not burnt and tarnished like some others. Not sweet but has nice licorice and chocolate notes. A solid offering, just wish it wasn't so darn hard to find on shelves."
"O: A very good imperial stout, dense and heavy and intense, and its ABV is really felt."
""
""
""
"A fantastic Imperial stout. Sierra Nevada pretty much always does it right."
"The body is moderately full and carbonation is medium; the feel has just a touch of creamy smoothness. Again, it’s not particularly massive, but it drinks like a charm. Overall a real winner. Not going to make anyone forget the heavy hitters but you could do a lot worse than grab a four pack of this for your stout fix."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Rather a hefty beer very good for a cold night. Cheers."
"Overall - Nice beer, but drinks closer to a american stout then a ris. Really smooth, and the alcohol is masked really well. Honestly, i expect big flavor and plenty of alcohol with ris's and this is really tame compaired to something like a yeti or a founders ris. Still good but id pass this off for the others mentioned. Worth a drink though."
""
"Narwhal tastes very good and left a great aftertaste, which is the most important thing; however in every other category, it is average or a only bit above."
""
""
""
""
"A really interesting beer. I do like the cocoa flavour there and the earthiness is interesting. The anise is overbearing but the whole is good and it isn't an alcohol bomb."
"o- seems easy to drink (the taste continues to beg successive sips), although the full body of the beer would catch up with me after awhile I think, thus cutting down the drinkability; SN has done it again- another great beer! would definitely have again; 4/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of those beers that I love because of the style and the classic flavors that it brings. However, it's not as memorable as certain other versions of this variety. It's imperfect, but it is definitely a great addition."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer overall and highly recommended. SN keeps on making high quality beers and this one actually has little to no hop flavor :D"
""
"O: Outstanding beer, for a 10% beer it is very well executed. This beer is addictive, makes me wanting to come back for more."

"Overall this is a nice tasty beer. It is impressive that SNBC can continue to brew these large brews on the scale they do yet keep a very high quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium to full body. Creamy. Light carbonation. Somewhat sticky at times."
"O: Good stuff, as per usual from SN. More roasty than I prefer in my stouts, especially when cold - it's almost Imperial Porter-like in that regard - but not off-putting in any way. Sure, I've had better stouts, but for the price ($10.49 for a 4-pack), I'm not unhappy with this new release."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty decent value. Came in a four-pack, meaning you can share. Great for the season of stouts. If you like roasted malty notes, then this is good. I happen to be in that category."
"Like Hoptimum and Bigfoot, a seasonal that should make value-minded beer drinkers very happy."
""
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest amount of carbonation. It is relatively smooth and easy drinking for something above 10%. I think Sierra Nevada was well overdue in putting a RIS into their regular lineup. This one fills the void in their catalog quite nicely. I would and will drink this one again when it is made available to me. Thank you for sharing Heath!"
""
""
""
"D: This is not a bad beer, but not a great one either. For the price, and with the other two entries in the ""High Gravity"" series from SN that I really like a lot, I expected a lot more from it."

"Taste-Baker's chocolate, dark roasted coffee. A big, rich, flavorfull stout, full of character and complexity. Good stuff!"
"O: I had a taste of this on tap a few weeks back, and I was really impressed. Out of the bottle, not so much. Not a bad beer still, but there are many better RIS options out there."
""
"This is a quality RIS. Sierra Nevada seems to have staked out Old Rasputin's territory and made a credible play for it."
"O: I'm a big fan of Sierra Nevada and the style (RIS). Is seemed like they were more focused on the high ABV than anything else. This one conjured up images of the dead sea. I like a little more life in my beer. Maybe I would have better luck with it on tap. For now I will stick with the offerings from Old Rasputin and Stone."

"O: Great Imperial stout, especially for the price range. Not super sweet, roasty bitter character is still fairly prominent."

""
"O: A really smooth velvety brew, definitely well executed, I'd love to see how this ages. A great sipper to have on a cold winter night. Probably the best value RIS I've had to date. I will have to buy this again to drink and cellar. Try it if you can, a real winner from SN."
"O: A solid RIS, but not great."

"Beer pours black with a fluffy brown head. Smell is quite nice, a mostly chocolate and cocoa with hints of roast. Flavor doesn't come together as well as I'd hoped after the nice nose. It's got a lot of flavor with a lot more roast than I had expected. It starts out smooth and chocolatey, but halfway through it punches you with a bitter roastiness that overwhelms the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. This is a nice stout, but the balance could be better, and the overwhelming roastiness in the finish is a bit much. It leaves a not-so-great flavor lingering on the palate as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied; even though the tongue and cheeks are coated with an amazing coat of malty goodness, the alcohol definitely cuts through and cleans the palate. I'm definitely getting a warming effect from this brew, but at 10.2% ABV, I wouldn't expect anything less. Overall an amazing brew with complex notes of bitter chocolate, black licorice, and some ash. The alcohol was a bit hot, but needed to clean the palate. I recommend this beer and can easily be paired with a good maduro. Cheers!"
""
"Overall mixed, it has some good points, the hops come in nicely, the fluffiness, booze is hidden fairly well, and it will surely age well. However, too much roast and black malt flavors for now, a bit acrid, little soy sauce, etc. However, I think this will be a great beer in 2-3 years so I'll probably bunker a few down in the cellar."
""
""
""
"Thick black pour with small tan head, aroma brings notes of nice cocoa powder, coffee, roast, alcohol and maraschino cherry. Taste is very sweet with prune juice overtones. Very soon the coffee and dark chocolate tastes kick in followed by some alcohol burn and some floral bitterness. The taste is very promising but rough. I have two bottles left from the four-pack and these are definitely going to be stored for a couple years. The palate is perfect with medium carbonation and chewy texture. Full body. Overall it is good, but as I mentioned, it should get smoother with some age. I very nice beer in light of the price. Once again, SN gets props for staying true to their micro-brew heritage."
"o - Overall a really nice RIS; I love that it comes in 12 oz. bottles and would definitely buy a 4 pack of this if I saw it on the shelf. Loads of roasted notes and some bitter chocolate dominating the taste, it's quite nice and something I'd like to have again."
""
"A well crafted RIS. While it has a very enjoyable flavor profile, I can't help but feel there is nothing particularly memorable overall in the big picture of Imperial Stous."
""
""
"Overall, not really something I will seek out, but not something I will pass up if offered either. I have just never been blown away by SN stouts."
""
""
"O- This beer has a big complex rich flavor but it is very well blended. The alcohol offers a nice support to the big flavors and texture. It taste great now and I can’t think of a reason it would need any age. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This isn't bad mind you... it's just not what I consider the style to be, and I am a stickler for rating on style. If they said this was a black ipa, it'd be at least a 4! I'd put this up against Wookey Jack, Black Watch IPA, Hop Noir or some other really good Black IPA's. A world class, or even good RIS it isn't. Sorry SN, you usually wow me. Redefine it, and I'll re-review it!"
"o - overall, went into this with no expectations other than that it is a beer from sierra nevada. not surprised that they were able to tackle a big batch RIS with class, flavor and quality. not the greatest RIS, but certainly one that i would pick up if it manages to show up in NY."

"best russian imperial stout ive had in as long as i can remember. on tap at j. ryans in syracuse, ny. poured into a pint glass jet black, inky and thick, with very little head at all. the nose is moderately sweet like a milk stout, with all the familiar roasty coffee and unsweetened chocolate malt flavors i am used to in a big heavy stout. somehow the alcohol is also absurdly well hidden from the smell and taste, would never have put this at over 10%. coffee is the first flavor note, but its bitter and short lived. sweeter malt and chocolate flavors come in next, followed by a mellow carolina fres tobacco vibe that sets the whole thing off. maybe not the most complex stout ive ever tasted, but certainly one of the most elegantly put together big stouts out there right now. maybe just shy on the carbonation, but the feel remains light despite that and despite the full body because of a light silky texture to the liquid that just makes this way way way to drinkable for me. what can i say? another hit from sierra nevada."
"O - I love the mouthfeel of this beer. The anise flavor isn't my favorite, but it isn't overpowering. It seemed to have a pronounced hop presence on tap which is not present in this bottle."
""
"A very drinkable RIS. Disappointed that this is seasonal as I would love to have it as an option year round."
""
"Probably the thickest beer I've ever consumed. Dark fruit tartness was a bit overpowering. Fairly boozy, as well. Good roast malt character. I'll probably like this better with some age on it."
""
""
""
"The first time I tried this I thought it was exceptional. Certainly one of my top favorites in the RIS style. The neck label says ""2012"" so I hope it will be an annual delight. From the 12 oz four-pack bought at Ibis Market in San Diego."
""
""
""
"O- I usually like most Sierra Nevada beers, but I'm not usually overly impressed by most of the ones the brew. This one was really great. It was a lot thicker than I figured it would be and had a smoothness throughout. It's an easy drinking stout and I'm glad I grabbed a bottle."
"The taste begins with dark malts and yeast with a resounding bitterness balancing it off at the end. The bitterness lingers and burns slightly but the alcohol is well-integrated. This is a highly recommended stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yep. Pretty exceptional stuff here, although the mastery and skill of Sierra Nevada should have stopped surprising me years ago. This beer gives the impression that it was designed exactly this way—it perhaps doesn't take the risks that could make it superlative, but you understand that this beer from the moment of its conception was going to be very good indeed."

"Went prefectly with a chocolate Xmass desert bon bon kinda thing"
"This is a great winter Imperial stout. It's strong and warming and not too sweet. the roasted flavors make me want to drink this in front of an open fire. I'll get more of this beer."
""
"For an off-the-shelf and reasonably priced RIS from a major brewery, this was pretty damn solid! There is lots of flavor and complexity here and this just feels like it’s going to age marvelously over the years. I need to grab some more of this for the cellar before it’s gone."
"M: Full bodied. Nice and creamy/oily mouthfeel. Easy to drink."
"I understand this is an Imperial Stout, and I know how well stouts are loved on this site, but it's not my favorite style. I can't give this a 5 until I try more stouts. I still like Hopworks Belgian Style Abbey and Optimator better..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"A behemoth RIS worthy of the Sierra Nevada name."
"On tap at Rustico's in VA. Pours jet black with a nice and dense tan head. Nose of sweet charcoal, coffee and chocolate. Flavors of a mocha forward stout with a fair bit of roast, dark nuts, and chocolate. Nice finish of bitter roasted coffee and hop bitterness which helps give it some length. This is a nice and complex stout from Sierra Nevada. A six pack of this is very reasonably priced as well. Welcome, Narwhal."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer, but I'm all for old raspy!"
""
""
""
"Really hits the spot for an imperial stout."
"Poura a dark brown with a nice tan head. Excellent retention, and laceing. Aroma is of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Body is thick and creamy, with a bit of carbonation. Taste is of dark semi sweet chocolate, and roasted coffee. This is an excellent version of this style. A must try."
"O- This is an impressive effort from one of my favorite ""go-to"" breweries. It is a huge imperial stout that I suspect would even do well in the cellar. I won't be able to find out though, because I drank all of mine!"
""
""
""
"Wow. Sierra Nevada is consistently great, and this actually exceeded my expectations. This is genuinely better than some pricey, hard-to-get Russian imperials. And the scary thing is that this will only get better with age. It tastes like... potential. I want to swim with the Narwhals and learn their secrets."
""

"Pours midnight black, with a 1/2 finger mocha head, that thins to a lace around the glass, very classic Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate up front, bitter coffee bean and espresso follow, subtle hoppiness sneaks in and out. Milk chocoalte in the mouth, bitter dark chocolate follow up, big hop profile found mid sip, coffee notes, very well round each second of the sip breathes a different taste. Big and bold in body, full and lightly carbonated, smooth flow that finishes semi dry. Overall; great Imp Stout, well rounded, well balanced, complex, delicious, whats not to like about this beer?"

"1552"
"O: a real nice R. I. Stout. Silky and smooth with a mellow alcohol burn masked by layers of roast. Hides it's true strength well. Lightens it's body by it's high octane nature while simultaneously hiding said nature in waves of roast. Let it warm some to bring out more depth and dark chocolate notes."
"Very enjoyable RIS. Keeps you wanting for more. Strong and powerful. To be enjoyed slowly. Let it warm a bit and let it sit. Let it linger in your mouth for as long as it can."
""

"One of the best imperial stouts ive had. Sierra nevada knows how to please. very dark in color, can hardly make out any light through the other side of the glass. rich finish and texture as is expected but plenty of carbonation to balance it out. i really loved this one and am on the lookout to buy it again if i can find it. amazing, rad label too."
"Pours a very dark opaque with no absolutely no transparency. A finger caramel dark foam which didn't stick around for too long, alright lacing. Smells of Strong bready malts, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon spice, a trace of hops and some alcohol. Taste of very bitter roast coffee, tart chocolate, and a touch of hops. Feel is full bodied, thick, and creamy. Nice tinge from the carbonation. Overall a solid brew from Sierra Nevada, going to enjoy the rest of my bottle with some chocolates"

"O- nice, but pretty over-the-top. i am really glad i have another that i am aging. i have a feeling this will be just incredible in a year or two. it's good right now, but there's no way it doesn't get miles better."
""
""
"I was shocked at how delicious this was, but at the same time, I should have expected it. Sierra Nevada puts out a damn good product, no matter what it is, and Narwhal is no exception. For this price, this is a steal. Great flavors, huge body, amazing mouthfeel - if you like RISs, give this one a shot."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really balanced and tasty off the shelf imperial stout. It does feel a little boring and one note at times. The smoke and roasted malt characters create a nice background and the booze is very well hidden. I could use a bit more sweetness to offset the smoke and earth tones. A good buy but not up there with my favorite stouts."
"Tried this beer side by side with a Founders Breakfast Stout. Both were great but I have to say I enjoyed the Narwhal more. It's much different and cleaner than the FBS. At the same time you don't lose any of the complexity from the malt. Not quite as much chocolate. A great beer with a smooth finish. I'm just starting to enter the world of RIS and it's off to a great start with this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice surprise. I'll definitely get a six-pack next time."
""
""
"O- the first 3 of the 4 pack i drank fairly quickly after i bought it and each time it was way to boozy, so i decided to sit on this one for a while, and it seems that's all this brew needed. It was pretty good and the booze had subsided considerable and i think if i would have waiting even long it would have been even better. Still IMO it's nothing to write home about and i have had better."
""
""
"Of these latest ""extreme"" offerings from SN, this is one that I preferred a hundred times over Hoptimum. There's an incredible amount of balance going on here, which is saying something as this one of the most intense takes on this style I've had since Old Rasputin. However, it is quite easy to finish, but it requires patience. That alcohol will get to your head if you're not careful, and it's dry enough to be taken slowly but never gets astringent so that it will left alone. Even though I definitely won't be having this every day, it's truly fantastic one from SN!"
"O - I prefer a bit more sweetness and less bitterness for an RIS that chooses chocolate as its most prominent ingredient. That said, this is an enjoyable RIS I would not mind having again. Good job Sierra."
""
"O - At 10.95 a 4 pack, this is an incredible deal. I have payed that price gladly for bombers that weren't as good. Give this one a try if you see it. Great job, again, by Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I would call this a highly drinkable RIS. This brew certainly isn't some barrel-aged, bourbon-wannabe monster, but it hit a sweet spot for me. The flavors are well integrated and reasonably complex and, when combined with the lighter mouthfeel, I could definitely see myself drinking this again on a chilly winter evening."
""
""
"This beer is weird. Based on comparisons to other reviews, I wonder if I got a bad bottle. Or maybe my sense of taste is just that different. As it warmed up, the bad flavors faded, and it became, well, okay."
""
"Would probably buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything is spot-on. A very well-crafted RIS. A fun and tasty sipper."
"Overall: I like this beer quite well, but I am not sure it is worth more than double the price of Old Rasputin. I need to taste them side by side to be able to do a better comparison. Utah really screwed the pooch on pricing on these (4/bottle retail). I am glad to have had one, but unless Utah lowers the price, I cannot purchase any more. I imagine this would age really nicely, too."
""
"O: Enjoyable, solid RIS. I wouldn't expect less from Sierra Nevada. I would buy again. 1 is enough for a night. I'm interested to try it aged to see if the slight booze calms down."
"Overall a success, would definitely buy this again - a great deal too @$10 or per 4/pk for such a big beer - one to enjoy around the christmas tree!"
""

""
""
"Overall a rock-solid imperial stout. Well done Sierra Nevada. Once again a no-nonsense, straightforward, excellent beer."
""
""
"Outstanding Stout! I didn't think I'd ever find a replacement for Founders Breakfast Stout, but this is damn close. This beer opens up beautifully as it warms. A great aftertaste with plenty of coffee kick. Thick tan/brown head into a Duvel ""tulip"" glass. I'm not sure what the official style term of that glass is. I've been holding out to try this guy, and I wish I hadn't, because Sierra is known for it's more hop forward beers. I'd love to have one of these year round or daily.."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer for the colder winter months (forget this in the warmer months). Was well balanced, smooth, and the alcohol is well hidden considering the abv. For you casual stout (guinness) drinkers, this one might be too big, but if you love real stouts, this is a keeper. Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very nice example of a Coffee Imperial Stout. It could use a little more body, but overall it's very good, especially for the price. I will be buying more."
"Overall: An above average roasty RIS. If you like your RIS to have big coffee flavors, this is the beer for you. I would like to see a bit more creaminess with this. This is not a bad beer, but with so many great RIS, this is just above average for the style."
""
""
""
"One of the best bang for the buck RIS on the market. Very impressed with the quality. Would love to try it on tap at some point. I'll have to cellar a few to try this time next year."
"12 oz bottle. Pours black with a thin, short-lived, creamy, light brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready, toasted malt, espresso, dark fruit and citrusy hops. Body is full and creamy. Taste is burnt toast, brown sugar, cappuccino, chocolate dark fruit and a lot of citrusy hops. Finish is long and very bitter. This brew should improve with age."

"O- Shit, pretty cheap and easy to get. If your in the midwest, grab some Blackout Stout by Great Lakes to stay local; If you're more west, this is a must-have in the fridge for the winter months. I'm not writing grandma about it, but I'm sharing it with my friends. Indeed, it surpassed my expectations; SN usually has the good macro option when you can't get a micro. This one is better, relatively, than their usual offerings. So easy to drink... I guess I'd have to say a kinda laid-back imperial, but an awesome stout none-the-less. And most importantly, a great beer, regardless of the words on the label."
""
""
""
"I'd say it's very good beer, and worth a try. There are other imperial stouts I prefer, but this is very good and certainly worth a try."
""
""
"O - Overall, I'm completely convinced that Sierra Nevada can do no wrong. In my opinion, this stout had a one of a kind flavor. I don't know how they managed to make the flavor seem as though it melts in your mouth. I'd definitely have again and I wouldn't mind aging one."

"Dark pour, seemingly pitch black, capped with a small tan head; good retention and lacing. Roasty aroma, dark malts, cocoa. Roasty malts and coffee on the palate, somewhat charred, toasted grains, cocoa, notes of licorice/anise and fig-like dark fruits. Smooth mouthfeel, heavy-medium body, softer carbonation, making for a good drinker overall."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a little above average for the style. Overall, it's a very solid beer. It's a little hoppier than prefer in the style, but it comes together very well. The roasted malts were very bold, which really liked. Very nice beer overall."
""
""
"O: This was an enjoyable and worthy RIS. Unfortunately, it didn't supply anything extra that left a lasting impression on me. Overall, I'd say this is worth trying out if you can get it."
"12oz bottle, pours black with slight chestnut hues at the edges of the glass when held to a light. Light brown head is thin and leaves some lacing down the glass. Big roasty nose with dark bittersweet cocoa powder and coffee. Smells powdery if that makes any sense? Tastes are complex and bold with lingering dark rich cocoa, espresso, booze, roasted barley, slight anise and pine on the finish. Mouth-feel is smooth and nearly full bodied, nice carbonation allows for palate coverage and depth of flavors. Overall, a very nice RIS. I'd buy this again, and hope I see it again next year!"
""
"The beer pours a deep, thick black with a dense foamy tan head that laces. No sediment or oily residue. The nose is a pungent mix of roasty, chocolatey malts, piney hops, and a touch of caramel. The roast really punches forward while tasting, followed by a cascade of fresh hoppy bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness and bite from the alcohol that palate-coats, but it's otherwise very smooth and drinkable. It's almost as hoppy as a (weak) black IPA, but I like the bitter contrast against the rich, sweet, roasty malt base. This is an exceptionally priced, widely available example of a hopped up RIS done right."
"I thought maybe they would of went safe with a RIS. But this is a big, bold stout that is not afraid to flex its muscles. Approachable flavors that just about anyone could appreciate."

"Solid stout with sharp, big flavors."

"Pretty impressive brew by Sierra Nevada. Rich and creamy with some nice roasty coffee notes. Good RIS."

"I was pretty blown away by this stout and would put it up there with my favorite RISs that don't come from a barrel."
""
"O - Not a bad, but there are much better imperial stouts out there. I had heard some good things about this beer, but was slightly disappointed. Too much hops/bitterness, and not enough malts to balance it out. Reminds me a bit of other highly hopped imperial stouts like Sweetwater's Happy Ending, and Victory's Storm King. Needs time to sit and mellow out."

"Overall: This is probably the second best beer I have had drank that is brewed by Seirra Nevada; only trumped by the Black Barleywine they put in the large format bottle a few years ago. This is a well made Russian Imperial Stout. It got an hier about it; to me its an approachable beer for people new to the style and its good enough to satify some people with those ""hard to please"" palates. Bold flavors and smooth drinking. Sierra Nevada would be wise to make this a seasonal beer no doubt in my mind! This one blows away old raspy by north coast."

"On tap at Capone's Restaurant. Dark brown with no head. A rich aged beer aroma. A good carbonation and full mouthfeel. Chocolate is important, coffee-like roasting is incredible. Fruity, a little syrup. Very good drinkability, no obviously booziness, other than its slight resemblance to the new Manhattans."
""
""
""
"Beautiful black, with a thick dark tan head, which leaves nice lacing. Smell is chocolate sweet with a whiff of hops. Taste is chocolate, smooth roast, slight licorice, some dark fruit, and roasted, bitter finish. Defintiely some booze noticable. Mouthfeel is thick, yet soft and smooth. Overall, I really like this a lot. Very nice sipper."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada hit this one out of the park. It's got everything that an Imperial Stout needs."
"Overall - Well, it's Sierra Nevada, so it's always going to be well-made. I might have to stock up on this the way I do Bigfoot. I could see myself getting a hankering for this in June when it's not on the shelves anymore."
"The mouth feel is very creamy and I don't notice too much alcohol warmth. Overall this is a great example and unique as well."

"For 10% abv this is a quite drinkable beer. Well balanced with full flavors as the beer warms."

"O: A top notch imperial stout. The coffee, chocolate, and roasted barley flavors mix well together and provide a solid backbone to balance the earthy and spicy hops. It is a fairly complex tasting beer, but each element has its own characteristics, and together they create a bold and pleasing imperial stout."

"O- What a bold offering from SN. It's sure to please stout lovers everywhere. I guess they figured, why mess around with dainty versions of the style? Go for the jugular! I'm glad they did. Great price tag for a 4-pack of high ABV beer, too."
""

"O: It's solid. To be readily available this one is a beer I'll go back to again. Very affordable and available. I think a BBA version of this would be phenomenal. Bravo Sieera Nevada, this is quality beer."

"Beer is medium in body, sweet, pretty nice for an off the shelf RIS. I'd have it again for sure. There is a mild sweetness, mild alcohol, nice bitterness, overall a nice beer. Yum."
"O: This one is right up there with Stone IRS and Old Raspy as far as RIS's go. Serves as a good night cap or fireside sipper. And as with all SN brews, a great price-point"
"Narwal is a decedent ale that's sure to be a staple all winter long in the cabinet of all lovers of stout. With its taste that should be reserved for those special occasions, there's the price of the ale that makes it somewhat ""everyday"". It's simply a low-guilt, guilty pleasure."
""
"Overall: I like this beer. I don't think it's a go-to for a lot of evenings, but something I'd like to keep on hand for that once-in-a-while change. Side note: one of my favorites is SN's Torpedo. This is worlds away from Torpedo, but enjoyable none-the-less."
"At first blush, the nose and look of this beer reminded me of Bells Expedition Stout, however once tasted, it's just not as cleanly fermented. This is a good RIS on par with Blackout or Victory , but just isn't on the same level as Expedition, Founders, or Siberian Night."

"o - another terrific west coast take on the RIS. really loved this beer."
""
""
"Overall: Overall, I'm not impressed by this beer and I think I'll leave it to the fanboys. All I know is that for me to want to drink this, I need for the hop character to be almost completely gone... and for the price point for the 4-pack, I can buy a lot of other things."

"Overall impression: Immensely drinkable given the style and size of this beer. A perfect 700th review. One of my favorite styles and one of my favorite breweries so this was appropriate. I hope they make more of this."

"Drink- I liked it. Couldve been just an off day for me to rate a little low. Might have to grab a 4 pk to sit on."
"Pours a dark, deep black with a central dome and accompanying rim of tan foam confluenced by etching about the remainder of the surface. Smells of sweet malts, hints of graham, some bits of cocoa, a good nougat character and a bit of milky character. I like the nose,but it is lacking in the hops I usually associate with a fresh RIS. Taste is more bitter than I recall, and rightfully so, it has a good earthy, spicy authoritative hops charm and then some toasted malts, bits of bitter chocolate, coffee and a hint of graham still. Full bodied with small, sharp and fleeting carb. A thick, wet finish. Nice beer, should be a year round beer, rather than a seasonal - it's nothing special and I like my seasonals to taste and be special."

"-Overall 4.5: I don't remember what I gave Ol' Rasputin, but this baby is a close second. Wonderful, huge beer that does not seem to be as big (in ABV and other areas!) as it really is. Deliciously smooth and robust, but at the same time very complex and nuanced. A chip off the old block. Recommended."
"Great beer, good price for the ABV, easy to drink, easy to find. No complaints about this one. Not as big and bold as some other RIS, but still a high quality drink."
""
"O - This is another solid entry into SN's line of higher-alcohol 4-pack brews. It's a big Imperial Stout that's pretty similar to the 30th Anniversary Stout (I believe it was Ken & Fritz's). Chewy, high-alcohol, sweet, big, sticky... all of those characteristics that make a good Imperial Stout."
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had just about all the aspects that I look for in the style with some good complexity, but it didn't seem to be as balanced as some of the better RIS's. This beer had ok drinkability, it's a sipper and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, but I think one would be enough for me, it might start to be to boozy after that. What I liked the most about this beer was it's complexity and it's appearance, they were both pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel and the drinkability, it was a little rough around the edges and it would be nice if this beer was smoothed out a little. I would buy this beer again, it's pretty solid and affordable for the style, I might keep a couple bottles for the cellar to see how they change overtime and I would get a four pack if it's released again. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid Russian Imperial Stout, but it lacked the balance and refinement that some of the better ones have, it's good but It can't hang with the world class RIS's like Founders RIS or Bell's Expedition Stout. Sierra Nevada makes some solid beers and this one's no exception, they seem to be one of the most constant breweries and I respect that. 2013 Edit, I had a year old bottle recently and it smoothed a little with some great chocolate flavors, ages well so far."
""
"T: A big charred malt hit right off the bat. Molasses, burnt coffee grounds, baking chocolate and charred grain. Maybe a hint of smoke and earthy hop resin on the finish. A really great RIS. Mouthfeel is big and chewy without giving away the ABV. Solid stuff."
""
"D: a good stout for sure, unfortunately for myself i expected a little more. maybe an additional dimension of flavor that i couldnt find. however i do appreciate the lack of alcohol heat on such a recent, high abv stout. good, definitely worth grabbing for a solid stout experience."
"Inky opaque black in the glass with a one finger dark khaki head of fine bubbles and good lacing. The smell is quite roasty with black patent and chocolate and brown malts coming through. A bit of smokey character, dark fruits and alcohol are all in the aroma as well. The taste is also dominated by roasted character it is actually quite overpowering at first as acrid bitter notes from the dark roasted malts bounce around. Also in there is dark chocolate, black coffee, molasses and a touch of alcohol. All of this is balanced by a dash of hops which are only in there as an attempt to balance the strong malts. Mouthfeel is pretty good as this beer is thick and chewy with low to moderate carbonation and excellent body. The finish is quite dry with puckering burnt malt bitterness and a touch of alcoholic spice. Overall this is a great beer and very surprising coming from sierra nevada a brewery that tends to specialize in hop bombs rather than malt focused beers like this. It appears as though I can now look forward to two great SN winter releases every year."
"I must say this was quite a surprise and I'll be buying this again."
"Pours up black. Great lacing. Dark tan/light brown lacing. Whatevs. Smell booze, shattered dreams, my upper lip, toasted malts. Taste toffee, coffee, and bears. Oh my! Slightly boozy. Thick burnt malts. Big ol body. Smooth carbo. A tastey treat. I dig it"
"O - at last! We get a great imperial stout from SN. Sure they have the beer camp stuff, but with a brewery that does about everything right.. Including making a solid stout and porter that's easily to locate. this is massive and thick winter stout and lets hope it's a new tradition at SN. Like all good big stouts it's capable of Having the pop topped from day one or can sit in your cellar for as long as you'd like. This RIS has the quality, complexity, and depth to rival anything in it's category. An instant classic for me and one of the best I've had. It may not be better than some, but it's great enough to be in the conversation. Sierra Nevada is world class."
""
"Overall, very good. There isn't a unique character about this one that makes it jump out like some of the classics in the country, but it has that perfect RIS taste, while masking a large amount of alcohol, and competing with others at a very affordable price. Well done."
"O - Sold stout, but I was a bit let down till I let it warm a bit more. Very solid, especially for the price."
""
"A nice take on the style, I need to do a side by side with old Raspy, I don't this quite beats that , but kudos to Sierra Nevada for spreading its wings. Would buy again to be sure, a little less boozeyness would help the cause. Will age great I'm sure"
"Dope release!"
""
"Very smooth mouthfeel, medium to thick in texture. Nearly no notice of the alcohol. This is a top-notch RIS. Highly recommend."

"Narwhal poured out thick, a stout is a stout, this one has a very dark black color and a sturdy inch of dense dark tan bubbles like chocolate milk. It fades away into a small cap up top leaving minor splotches on the glass. Smell is pretty balls deep, scents include bakers chocolate, earthy hop tones, licorice, roasted malt, smores, and some minor dark fruit. It smells great. Taste is superb, just a big RIS, no bells or whistles. With so many RIS out there they kind of run in circles with one another. Narwhal does the same. Taste includes most of the scents up above, but the two characteristics that stand out to me in this specific RIS is licorice and dark fruit. Body is full and carbonation keeps the beer going after some warming, while this indeed does warm up to me. A one and done beer in a sitting with the body and alcohol. This is another RIS that I will be keeping in touch with during the cold months and possibly building a vertical down the line, which seems like the right thing to do."
""
"O- A decent to good imperial stout. I always like SN offerings and even if this isn't one of the top examples."

"As if I needed another reason to love this brewery SN delivers anyway."

"O - If you like your stouts in the ""burnt and bitter"" style, it's hard to find better. It might not be the most complex stout I have had, but it's perfectly presented. A stunner."
""
""
"Outstanding ! This is up there with my other 3 favorites: Rasputin RIS,, Bell's Expedition, and Ten Fidy. You are not going to find any better imperial stout than this for the money. Very reasonably priced here in Ohio @ about 11 bucks/4. Very rich, thick mouthfeel, about a two finger head, and very pronounced burnt chocolate and coffee notes."
""
"I loved it in the bottle and have been picking the four-packs up as I see them. Great now...only time will tell for later."
"I've been looking forward to trying this beer since I first heard about it. 12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours an inky black with a fizzy and effervescing two inch, mocha-colored head that sizzles and pops as it gradually collapses into a sudsy slick with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Nose expresses dark, roasted malts, chocolate and brewers licorice - there's also a slight artificial sweetener character that reveals itself towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, there's also some smokiness in the flavor profile as well as molasses. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with slightly oily texture, as well as a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a very solid RIS from a very solid brewery. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden, and balance is great. The only detracting qualities for me are the slight, artificial sweetener presence in the nose and in the flavor. Also, while the carbonation is not overly assertive, I would like to see it dissipate a little more. All and all, this beer is well worth your time if you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, unsweetened cocoa, alcohol, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and full bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors but I think the mouthfeel is the best part of the drinking experience with this one."
"Overall I really like this beer, great combination of flavors, and even though the alcohol is noticeable it is not overbearing"

"o - pretty damn enjoyable, but a little hot and rough around the edges. quite drinkable for 10%, but certainly could use some time to mature. gonna pick up some more of this and sit on them for a while. definitely a welcome addition to the imperial stout category."

Granted, this is purely subjective, so to anyone who reads the review: please treat it as such. The overall experience is excellent, and I am very pleased to have finally picked up a bottle of this beer. The fact that it's named what it is acts as an added bonus!"
""
""
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Dark chocolate and figgy fruit sweetness fills in. Becomes more earthy, peaty, and bitter. Herbal, piny, numbing hop bitterness lasts through the finish. Vanilla and licorice around the edges. Warming. Full-bodied with a smooth, satiny feel. Very nicely done."

"This beer poured out as a dark black color with a decent tan colored head on top. The retention and lacing was moderate. The smell of the beer was roasted with some chocolate and burnt aromas. The taste of the beer was also a little on the burnt side with a dark chocolate bitterness in there with more roasted malts. The mouthfeel was on the heavier side but not the smoothest of stouts out there, it's carbonation was good and it finished dry. Overall this beer was decent in my opinion. I may need to revisit this beer one day to get a better grasp on it."

"D - Mediocre. Though I'm sure the cost is reasonable, there's just no reason for me to buy this when I have stuff like Breakfast Stout available. The only thing that impresses me is that this feels and drinks like a 6% beer, not 10.2%."

"O-the flavors aren't unique. They're not strong, but they are flawless. It's really just an easy drinking strong stout that remains true to it routes. The ingredients taste very real and genuine.i love this. It's one I could get by the case."
"O: Sierra Nevada waited too long to release an RIS. This should be considered a standard. I’ll be buying more to age."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Sierra Nevada has done a nice job on this style, not surprisingly. I’m going to enjoy savoring the other three, and I’ll see how one evolves with a year’s worth of age."
"Medium bodied with a deeply roasted dark malt flavor that's complimented by a bitter, earthy hop presence that lingers into a slightly boozy finish. The hops aren't as strong as the nose hints at but there's still prominent in the flavor with sticky pine needle bitterness and subtle citrus. The dryness of the hops compliment the bitterness of the roasted malts. Hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, bitter dark chocolate and espressoo/coffee bean followed by lighter chocolate and alcohol sweetness. The high is relatively well masked but there's definitely some warmth lingering in the finish. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but the strong hop character hinders the malt flavors a bit too much for my preference. Decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Great value for the price of the four pack though."
""
"Overall (4.5): To be honest, this is quite a bit better than I was expecting, and I was already expecting that Sierra Nevada would do a pretty good job. Turns out, they did an excellent job. This is a full-bodied, full-flavored, but attractive and pleasant-drinking imperial stout with a couple of unexpected and very welcome turns here and there. I’m not into most aged beers, but I’d be willing to bet this would be a good candidate. Outstanding, and a job well done by Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"O- A great imperial stout. I enjoyed the 30th anniversary stout more, but I am very happy see Sierra Nevada brewing an imperial stout."
""
""
""
"Overall: Started out looking like a dream, but didn't deliver excellence in the aroma or taste. Some might be my personal preference in that I like imperial stouts to be a little sweeter than this, but it still didn't give a particularly memorable experience. Kind of middle of the road, not too sweet, not too hoppy."
"O - Sierra Nevada Narwhal employs dark, roasted malts to create a deep depth of flavor throughout this imperial stout changing as it warms. A welcome addition to Sierra Nevada's seasonal line up, Narwhal is a wonderful sipping beer that encourages reflection on the malts' presence and use."
"Note: Had an aged one from 2012 on 2013-10-19 and the brashness has mellowed significantly. I like it better with a year on it.  Had a 2013 vintage on 2014-11-15 and am finding it's equally delicious this time after aging a year."
"O: A very nice Russian imperial stout from Sierra Nevada; is this a new seasonal? a one off? Interesting as its kind of out of nowhere. Big and bold and somewhat reminiscent of Old Rasputin - that's what it initially reminded me of, at least. A good beer, even with the slightly off mouthfeel. I'd have another - maybe on a cold winter night!"
"Because of the carbonation, I really had a hard time feeling the complete mouthful and then the final after taste."
""
""
"Finally! An imperial stout from the wonderful Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. What should be a recurring rotational release, Narwhal is a textbook imperial stout, only better. It is deep black, huge roasted malt smell and taste. The hops come into play in the complex palate, just enough to bring a pleasantly strong bitterness - if you let the sip sit in your mouth a bit, you will be able to pick it apart. The mouthfeel is ridiculously creamy even out of the bottle. I'm glad to see this one come to life. Sierra Nevada is an excellent brewery and it only makes sense that they would make a great RIS."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very impressed with this imperial stout. Not as rich and creamy as some of the top imperial stouts but still very enjoyable. Might have rated this a 5 overall if the color was black versus very dark brown and if the texture was more creamy and oily. One of the most well balanced and enjoyable imperial stouts that I've tried. Highly recommended."
""
"O-This is a very OK version of an Imperial Stout. I feel that Sierra opted to side more with the Chocolate Malt than with the Roast Malt, which is fine, but just not my preference. Still, this beer has a ton of character and only intensifies as it warms. There are zero flaws in this beer. I was hoping for a little more excitement in the flavor. If you name a beer 'Narwhal', to unicorn of the ocean, it should have a little more pizzazz. I would have liked to seen a more estery yeast, maybe a little less baker's chocolate or chocolate malt, and a touch more roast malt. After your first or second sip the flavors don't change, which is something I look for in a beer capable of being so nuanced and complex."
"Overall I love SN and they always instill to impress me with every new brew they craft and this one doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
"Just had Narwhal on tap at a local bar. They paid attention to glassware, and proper serving temp. I enjoyed this beer significantly more on tap. Still a tad on the bitter side of where I enjoy my Imperial Stouts."
""
""
"O- I am actually surprised with how different this beer tastes than other RISs. Very complex combination of flavors that border on cluttered, but make it a unique offering."
""
""
"O - I love SN and this one delivers. It is a sipper that is great in the cold weather season. It to bad it is hard to get a-hold of at this point in time. I believe this beer will become better with age because it has a pretty bitter aftertaste that kinda distracts from the dark flavors which I believe is from the hops. Also, this beer has some alcohol which will fade with age. It may get a higher rating when cellard for a while, but for now its just excellent. Cheers!"

"It's a really pretty stout. The head is a thick blanket of brown foam. Fine bubbles stick to the walls of the glass with each sip. The body is jet black. It's hard to see any color even at the edges of my glass. The aroma is full of chocolate and coffee. There's some caramel and roast beneath those initial notes. It smells rich and sweet. A touch of hops blends into the background. The taste is also quite good. Heavier on the roast and coffee than chocolate. Starts with lots of caramel and chocolate sweetness before the more bitter flavors take over. Mouthfeel is soft and full. Excellent. This is a great example of the style. I wish it was a bit more chocolatey and even less bitter, but I could see my score going up even higher upon subsequent tastings."
"Review #2700"

"Addendum: as the beer warms it improves. Boldness emerges and becomes much more like a Russian Imperial Stout. A bit of a sour character that seems to accentuate the experience, but I wouldn't miss it if it weren't there. I feel the alcohol, so it must be there. I certainly don't taste it."

"Overall, I expected this beer to be average and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a well-constructed RIS, though just a little bitter for my taste."
"O - I'm in a bit of bind with this brew. The ABV sits between two of my favorite RIS (Ten Fidy and GD Yeti). You would think it would take some of the better qualities of both of these beers, but it fails. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the beer (It's a heavy stout, after all), but I will be aging a couple bottles just to see if maturity is what this beer needs all along."

"O - This is a really nice Russian Imperial Stout."

"A very dry, roasty RIS. Reminds me a lot of Old Rasputin. A nice change to a lot of sweet RIS's, but i feel like its a little one noted. Should be interesting what a little age does to this beer."
"This imperial stout is a nearly jet black color with a nice light brown head and good lacing. The aroma offers clean, muted malt, nothing prolific. The flavor is full of thick malt and medicinal grass bite, mineral water and charcoal blended into a unique mouthful of stout. Sharp malty goodness, and not much else to say. Full bodied I'd say with a somewhat oily feel. Very tiny bubbles for a subtle but adequate carbonation. Quality stuff though not something I would have to revisit. Classy brew none the less."

"O- Sierra Nevada has proffered a great little Russian Imperial Stout. It's not the best RIS out there, but it is a great value and I'd put it up there almost with Stone's RIS. I might try picking up a 4-pack of bottles so I can age this and see how it develops into next year."

"SN has done a great job here. I've had the pleasure of going through a 4pk and was lucky enough to land a case. The price point is on the mark. I'm hoping this will age well in the bottle...that's if I can stay away from it."

"Didn't see getting a taste of this tonight, but I'm sure as hell not gonna argue. It pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of golden brown foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark coffee, earthy greens, and dark chocolate. The taste brings in more of the same, with some heavy bitterness being balanced by the depth and relative sweetness of the roast and the chocolate. The body is a light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice, bold stout. It reminds me a lot of Ten Fidy, only drier, less creamy. Good times."

"Pours a very deep dark brown topped with a two and half finger fluffy beige head. Above average retention, considerable amount of splotchy lacing as the head slowly recedes. Bakers chocolate and phenol alcohol on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate, roasted dark chocolate malt and a with just a hint of dark fruit midpalate. Finishes dry with a touch of roasted espresso, warming alcohol, and continued notes of cocoa. The lighter sider of full bodied, moderate carbonation, slick mouthfeel. A decent Russian Imperial Stout, but not very complex. The roasted chocolate malt flavor tends to dominate and at the same time lacks depth. I'm looking forward to revisiting this brew again to see if it delivers more the second time around."
""
"O: Despite my inclinations, this beer gives itself over to easy-drinking. This is neither a criticism nor a compliment...This is one of the most supremely drinkable RIS I've ever encountered."
""
""
"O: This is a well rounded stout, one that doesn't disappoint and lives up to the standards that Sierra Nevada have for great beer. Without wowing typically, this beer has stepped it up a notch from some of the other recent releases that SN has. I am sure I will have this again in the future, well done."
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on October 12, 2012. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with a half inch tan head that sticked around for a bit. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, anise, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and a little bit of piney hops. I think the taste is just like the aroma. There's a bit of sweetness, but also a lot of bitter roasty goodness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden, you wouldn't think it's 10.2% ABV when drinking it. I think this is a pretty good imperial stout, at $9.99 a 4-pack I know I'll be buying this again."
"A dark tan head fades quickly from two fingers with minimal residual lacing. Insert cliche of choice for the color black here. Nutty, chocolaty and vinegary to the nose. Closer inspection reveals a nice fusion of dark grapes and cocoa. Tastes silky smooth with milk chocolate notes that are quickly countered by a semi-rough woodiness. Black coffee, subtle hops and burnt sugar provide a fine follow up to the preceding notes. Fusel alcohol heat plays a big part in this burly one; demanding respect, but remaining fairly welcoming despite its 10 plus percent. Narwhal is simple one more notch in Sierra Nevada's belt of excellence and consistency. Few breweries do it better."
"Overall, this is a nice imperial stout but I think it needs to sit a while. Its somewhat boozy and abrasive. With some time I think it will mellow out and become much smoother and easier to drink. I will say this, I thought it would be a more hop forward imperial stout given Sierra Nevada's history of producing excellent IPAs, but it is very malty which is nice. I don't want my review to sound to negative, this is a good beer and I would recommend it, I just think it needs to age a little."
"This is a solid, delicious stout with a great flavor profile. I feel like I could drink a lot of this even at 10%. It has a great malt character and the hops are noticeable but balancing. This is just an all around good beer."
""
"O-Glad to see Sierra Nevada making an Imperial Stout. Now to try aging some."

"Next to Celebration, my favorite SN offering."

"O/D-Like Hoptimum, this brew is a textbook Imperial Ale. Also like Hoptimum, Narwhal does not attempt to do anything that hasn't been done before. That is my only true criticism of this brew. It is a scrumptious and blameless Stout, but it offers no unique qualities. Regardless, this brew is a beast!"
"Overall an OK beer, but they didn't balance out the Patent malt enough so it ends up a little unbalanced."
"Midnight black pour, thick tan head that dissipates to form a lasting ring. Gigantic, deep nose of roast coffee, cacao, prunes, dates, figs, plums, and cedar shavings. Flavor is similar with great hops in the endless finish. Massive, syrupy body that coats the mouth with all of the above. I’ve never been a fan of black IPAs, and this is reminiscent of those, but with the needed addition of the fruitiness, which transforms it into something amazing."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very solid Imperial Stout at a very good price. It tastes like a Sierra Nevada beer. The hops are trademark. If you see it, pick it up. I'll be grabbing up more of these, and aging them a couple months. I imagine age will make this an even better beer. 4.5/5 (Taste and Mouthfeel a little more important than Appearance and Smell for me personally.)"
""
""
"O: A cheap, kick-ass RIS. This is a step from the norm for Sierra Nevada – it’s definitely the thickest and most slow-drinking beer from these guys – but it works at every turn. If this were more than limited release, I’d buy it all the time; over Old Rasputin, Storm King, and even Plead the Fifth. Put this in a barrel and this would stand up to the best of them."

"Overall: A very good take on the Russian Imperial Stout. Big, roasty, and sweet while avoiding becoming cloying. Very solid."
""
"O: This is just another damn good beer from Sierra Nevada, but what else should I have expected?? I mean everything they make is delicious and they knocked this beer out of the park."
"All over this beer is killer and I hope she is around for years to come...and you feel the ABV about 50 seconds into the drinking. B*tchin Russian Stout."
""
"An exceptional Imperial Stout overall, with a succulent mouthfeel that is perhaps its best quality. Nothing outlandish here, just solid Imperial Stout as it should be. Why Sierra Nevada took so long to release a beer like this is beyond me, but it displays all of the attributes of quality brewing that the brewery is known for, and will undoubtedly become a quick favorite for cellaring and general wintry imbibing."
"O: Pretty good imperial stout, easyish to drink, lots of nice stout flavor."
""
"Overall: The finish had enough bitterness but the rest of the sip could have used more. The smell was a bit off but the rest of the beer was pretty good. Not sure I need more."
"O wonderful. A nice big one from Sierra Nevada. Very impressive."
"Sierra Nevada brings it Like a Boss. This is fresh and bursting with raw but perfect flavors for a fresh Impy. I would drink this for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! For the price point, It's a no-brainer. I will be buying ALOT of this. Thanks again Ken!"
""
"O: In a couple months to a year this beer will be drinking great. I love it now, but for those who want the bitter hops and the slight alcohol presence to fade away, sit on a few bottles. Thank you SN for release this as a four pack."
"D - A decent beer with room for improvement. Sierra Nevada should dum down the carbonation and let this beer speak for itself. This would be better between 8.0-9.0% abv and would benefit from a dark chocolate flavor profile rather than the dark/unsweetened cocoa profile that is pronounced here."
""
"I've enjoyed my time with Narwhal. I have one more I'm going to age. I think time will do this stout very well."
"Overall a great balance between hop action and roasted malt, a very controlled and fun beer, with not a boozy taste either for 10, a real fantastic stout very enjoyable."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a pitch black color with dark brown hues and a ring of brown head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, and maybe even a bit of bubble gum. The taste is dark bitter chocolate and espresso. Smokey, roasted malts as well. Some vanilla and an overall sweetness flavor. Hints of caramel. Dark chocolate and coffee finish. Full bodied. I really liked the 30th Anniversary RIS so I was glad to hear they were releasing another Russian Imperial Stout. Overall, solid beer worth seeking out."
"O: I really like this one balanced taste and true to the style the abv is well hidden. Above average imperial stout and good for being readily available but not my favorite"

"Pours jet black with a thinner deep mocha colored head atop,no light got thru even when held to the light.Deep roast,char, and smoke dominate the nose with underlying bitter chocolate,it smells a bit raw and in your face.Wow alot of different stuff going on on the palate,dark roast coffee,deep char and smoke, with a molasses,licorice, and alcohol induced sweetness that really hits home,I was right this is in your face.This is a big brash imperial stout,it's a little rough around the edges...in a good way."

"2012 vintage, this was poured from a bottle into a mug. The beer is almost completely jet-black, with some chestnut highlights. No head, but there is a touch of bubbly filmy ringing around the surface. Aromas of chocolate, roasted coffee, a touch of booze, and earthy tones. Flavors are strong and rich, with a heavy roasted coffee backbone supporting a boozey and oaky highlight. Very deep and layered. Bittersweet chocolate laces throughout the palate, as well as a touch of bourbon. The aftertaste is bittersweet and roasty, with a slight booze linger as well. The beer is rich, but very smooth in mouth, and fairly light for an RIS, which makes it extremely palatable. Smooth, bitter, and rich finish. Very easy to drink despite the increased ABV and ""big"" flavor profiles."

"Overall, this is a very good stout that is definitely worth checking out."

"O) Excellent RIS right here. I enjoy a little extra hops in the flavor, and kind of expected that from SN. I love their regular stout. This one is a fantastic sipper for the cold months ahead. Glad to recommend this beer..."

"Would be worth aging, in order to mellow out some of the bitterness."
"O: very nice beer for $9 per 4-pack. Delicious stuff, would buy again, and I'm excited to age some of these."
""
""

"Overall - Well executed RIS. Fantastic all-around balance for the style. A bit of heat does shine through, but at 10.2% it's nothing unexpected. Looking forward to drinking this again, and comparing to the likes of the Lagunitas Imperial Stout, as well as others."
""
"I'm now on my 3rd bottle and my like for it grows and grows. There's really nothing I'd change with my review *other than* the scores. Onward and upward!"
"Great RIS. Loved this and glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Considering this doesn't taste up my alley, I can at least appreciate the well-made aspects of it. The sweetness and bitterness balance well in the taste, although I think both are a little heavy. Alcohol is not very noticeable for a 10% plus beer. My score turned out very odd for this one."
"O: I was big fan of this one. Pricewise, it beats everything else in that range and can really compete with some of the higher end imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer gets everything right, even as a fresh beer. Plus its SN so its at an amazing price and distribution. It seems less hoppy and intense than the the 30th Anny stout, but I really like this beer a lot."
"O - I have been waiting for this to land in my area for a few weeks. Balanced flavor that improves as it warms. The more drink it, the more I like it. A very good RIS that is right up there with Old Raspy in the RIS 12oz. 4pk under $10 category. Sierra Nevada rarely disappoints. Hopefully this becomes a shelf staple so I can grab it whenever I choose."
"Poured down the middle of a 16 oz snifter, bottled on the 279th day of the year, and close to room temperature like the brewer would suggest. Pours a slick midnight black, with a massive 3 inch brown head that coats the sides of the glass with lace. The smell is anise, coffee, chocolate, and hints of smoke, balanced very well. Taste is very aggressive with all those flavors, probably will mellow with time, I will definitely hang on to a case of these to see what time will do, not complaining. Body is medium large, plenty of life especially for its size, a little dry as you should expect, and very approachable. This is a wonderful and affordable imperial stout at $8.99. Sierra does it once again!"
""

""
""
"Overall, another stellar beer from SN. I haven't had the regular stout, but I imagine they built off of it for this one, and it makes me excited to try some."

"Much smoother than fresh and the roasty chocolate flavors are holding up real well."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Incredibly smooth for how big it is with great overall balance."
""
"A very nice effort from Sierra Nevada! Not the greatest Imperial Stout and I would have liked a little more complexity, but an extremely solid example of the style."
""
"O- everything that I was expecting, body and heavy, intense chocolate with notes of coffee, and just enough piney hops to balance out this massive beer. Certainly drinkable for the ABV, a slow sipper and a great beer for a cold night."
"Like most Sierra Nevada it's not surprising or different, it's just really good. I was drinking this and my wife was drinking Founder's Breakfast stout and I liked my beer better if that says anything."
"Pours a solid black color with a huge fluffy tan head that slowly recedes to a cap on top. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate with a hint of caramel. Earthy citrusy hop aromas meld nicely with light aromas of dark dried fruits. The flavor is sweet with caramel and chocolate with a nice shot of espresso. A bit of earthy citrus hop flavor but mostly a roasty bitterness in the flavor. Light dark fruit flavors with a hint of alcohol round out the flavor quite well. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy velvety mouthfeel. Very nice Imperial Stout I really enjoyed this one and I guess I need to get back to the store to buy a few more to lay down."
""
""
"O: A solid RIS, it reminds me a lot of Old Rasputin with a bit more licorice in there. The price is great, well made, well worth a try."
"Very tasty and rich Imperial Stout from Sierra Nevada. Drinking very good in its fresh state, will put some back to age as well."
"I will be picking up as much of this as I can at 9.99 a 4pk this is a great buy."
"Well done RIS. Especially with making it drinkable and not overwhelming for a beer of this size. I tend to like a little age on these, and I will give some bottles that opportunity. But having said that, this works well this fresh"
""
"Poured into a snifter, this is very dark, thick, and viscous. The smell is powerful with some traces of roasted grain, graham cracker, dark chocolate, alcohol, and piney hops. Initial taste is very sweet with some dark chocolate and molasses. More graham cracker and roasted malts round it out with a slight bitterness is left at the end. The alcohol is masked very well, keeping this very drinkable. I'm pretty happy with this one, it's definitely a very solid RIS."
"I would say this is in the same ball park as Founders Imperial Stout, but has more hop presence...I'm really liking the level of roast in this beer with the chocolate finish. I'm buying this beer again and would recommend you do as well, but will certainly put some in the cellar for a year or so to lessen the hop bite."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice RIS. Very thick and full, I loved that part. Excellent complexity, has some of pretty much every roasted malt characteristic that I've had in any stout. Balance is decent though it's a little too smoky and maybe a little too much anise but it's also very fresh (and a little hot, as noted). Overall, quite excellent. Looking forward to storing some away."
""

"A solid beer, and possibly one that will benefit from some age. For now however, not among my favorite impy stouts."

"O: It's enornous, it's velvety smooth and it doesn't punch you in the mouth but it can probably put you down after a few. alcohol is very well hidden. This beer is absolutely phenomenal and a steal at the price point it sells for. Buy it and then buy some more to keep in the back of the fridge for a few years. I want this beer in a bourbon barrel!"

"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head with good retention and slippery lacing. Mild aroma of toasted malt, chocolate and a hint of coffee and anise. Flavor is much more intense, very toasty and slightly charred malt, bitter chocolate, licorice and burnt coffee, especially in the finish. Nice medium to heavy, creamy body. Flavor tends more towards the charred spectrum, but the the other flavors support it. Not quite a smoked beer, but leaning in that direction. Wow, this one will be on my regular list, delicious"
""
""
""
"The beer pours a deep coffee black with a dark khaki head that fizzes away quickly. The body is opaque and dark with no carbonation bubbles present. Lacing is sticky and cloud-like, though thin. The beer smells like dark coffee and dark chocolate. Roasted malts are very present in the nose and give the beer a beautiful overarching feel of “Big Stout” which is precisely what I want from this beer, but there are also some slight notes of toffee and caramel which add complexity to the nose. The beer tastes wonderfully rich with roasted malts that suggest black creamy espresso. Chocolate is also present, equally as creamy, and very dark. The bitters are light and slightly citrusy in the background of the taste, but there are some rough charred notes in the flavor. The beer begins as black coffee, transitioning into dark chocolate with light citrus bitters from the hops. The close is bitter black coffee and slight hints of the citrus hops which come through strongly if you force yourself to belch. The alcohol is pretty hidden in this beer, with just a hint of it showing through at the open of the sip but quickly being lapped up by the roasted malts. The does return lightly in the aftertaste as a weird slight burning tingle. This flavor is very classic as far as imperial stouts go, though I’m not quite sold on the Russian imperial stout bit. The beer is a perfect example of the style but nothing above and beyond it. The mouthfeel of this beer, however, is one of the best I have ever felt. Creamy and thick, this beer sits on the tongue as an angelic liquid; it leaves the tongue coffee dry, with light wet notes on the very fringes of the mouth. Saliva is thick and chewy when it does run, and it begs for more. This is legitimately what makes this stout. The mouthfeel is incredible, even if it is a little strange for a stout. Overall, I’m pleased with this stout. I kind of wanted more in terms of flavor, especially in the hops category, but the mouthfeel makes up for most of my complaints. The taste is classically average, but the mouthfeel is above and beyond. This beer is worth a try, especially since Sierra Nevada does so few stouts. I know I’ll be cellaring at least one of the bottles for quite some time. This beer is obviously not the top of the style, but it is fantastic, drinkable, and has a mouthfeel to die for. Try this beer and you will not be displeased."

"O - A really good beer! SN has a winner here. I recommend any stout drinker to grab a 4 pack and try it out!."

"Sierra Nevada finally has a (good) shelf stout. And there aren't many imperial stouts in 4 or 6 packs aside from Ten Fidy so thats cool too. Pours midnight black with a thick brown head and nice lacing. Nose is strong roasted coffee, smokey malts, char and just a hint of raw cacao. Pretty basic imperial stout but it smells fantastic. The taste is surprisingly bitter. Bitterness, chocolate, roasted coffee, charred notes, smoked malts and some definite booze in there. The smokiness and bitterness are a bit strong but I think some age will mellow that out and the roasty flavors and coffee will come forward a bit. Still an awesome stout. Full body, heavy mouthfeel and light carbonation (typical stout style). Go Sierra Nevada!"
""
"In my mind, the direct competition for this beer is the Samuel Adams Imperial Stout that comes in the blue and black four pack, are similarly priced, and even features some similar artwork and stylistic themes. The Narwhal is a terrific Imperial Stout, the mothfeel is absolutely spot on, and while the flavors are strong, the taste never gets over bearing like some Imperials do. However it is nothing overly exciting or novel, and personally I feel that something like the Samuel Adams Imperial Stout would be a better overall choice. Again, I want to reiterate that this is a TERRIFIC BEER, but it has some impressive competition that just slightly edges it out. If you're looking to mix it up or just to try something new, you won't be disappointed."
"This is a very different stout. It's quite good now, particularly as it warms, but my guess is that in 12-18 months this will be incredible."
"O: a pretty good imperial stout, nothing earth shattering but a very solid representation of the style.... Good fresh, interested to see how this one ages, I could see it getting pretty good with a bit of time."
"The beer pours a black color with a large tan head. The aroma has some roasted malt as well as some dark fruit. The flavor is very similar. There is a good bit of smoke and heavily roasted malt. I also get some sweet chocolate and cherry notes, as well as a good dose of alcohol. I also get a bit of tobacco in the flavor. As the beer warms I get a huge amount of black licorice flavor, which I am not a huge fan of. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Just picked this up at my local Whole Foods. Pours black as my ex-girlfriend's heart with a lingering 2 fingers worth of head. Smells of burnt toast and coffee. Suprisingly smooth taste (easier drinking than old Rasputin) with coffee and chocolate notes. Noticable, warming but not boozey alcohol aftertaste. Exceptional example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
"Overall: totally unique. I've never tasted a beer like this, especially one that isn't barrel aged."
"Dark brown pour evolved into a near pitch black opaque liquid in the glass, with ruby highlights. The head was quite small in size, but it left some awesome khaki lace. The aroma of the beer showed off the roasted malts, with the smells of coffee, toffee, and chocolate. The taste was an extension of the smell, but with amped up intensity. The coffee taste was thick in this beer, with a bitter, astringent finish. If I let the sip linger in my mouth, some powder cocoa notes crept in. I usually dislike ""Imperial"" stouts that have runny, weak mouthfeel. Luckily this was not one of those namby pamby beers. The body was as thick as they come. Sierra Nevada has delivered another awesome product to the mass market."
""

""

"This isn't going to shatter a tongue or a mind, but damn if it's not one of the most drinkable RISes on the market. A bit of edge will temper the hops and really allow the malt flavors to shine. Great fresh and I can only imagine how great it will be when it's aged."
""
""
""
"Taste is smooth but bitter roasted malts, some chocolate, and ever so slight smokey booze. No doubt this would age well, maybe mellow this out a bit. A bit bitter now, but still really nice stout. Although, compared to some ""top"" RIS, its not quite up to par. Still tastey, but not an RIS in my opinion. Maybe an American Stout is more suited to this brew.It just doesnt have the body and personality Ilike in a RIS."

"Overall, a very well made Imperial Stout. For mass produced RIS, this is going to be hard to beat, another winner from the fine folks in Chico."
"A very well done imperial stout all around. Very well rounded, but nothing stands out a ton to me to make it elite. Doesn't matter, this is a satisfying imperial stout that will fit the bill for the upcoming winter months."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black like motor oil with a tall, brown head. The head retreats very slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is filled with dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. It's a good smelling stout. The taste follows the nose. The dark roasted malts, the chocolate, and the coffee are prominent without all being strong and overpowering. There are some hops on the back end just adding some back end bitterness to help balance this big brew. The body is full and thick with light carbonation. The beer just coats the mouth and allows the aftertaste to linger. You know this is a big beer when you encounter it, but it doesn't hit you over the head. It helps make this is a very drinkable stout. This is an excellent beer."
"Over all this is a great effort and yields a nice thick stout."

"Overall I like this stout; it's big but also subtle. I will put a couple of these away and will be interested to see how it ages."
"Overall: Can't believe it took Sierra Nevada so long to make an Imperial Stout (not counting the one-offs). Worth the wait. Will be fun to see how this ages alongside other affordable 12oz Imperial Stouts (Bell's Expedition, Founders, Brooklyn Black Chocolate, Victory Storm King, Old Rasputin)."
"Solid, straightforward imperial stout for those who want the classic roasty vibe. Job well done. And the price is great."

""
""
"Overall this an enjoyable everyday stout. The flavors are subtle, with good balance between the alcohol and malt. The mouthfeel is to my liking and a big plus to me. It's always nice to find stouts in a 12oz offering, and I could see myself rotating between Narwhal and Old Rasputin as far as stouts to keep on hand in a smaller format."
""
""
"I believe this is a very good example from Sierra Nevada. I wonder if they'll do a yearly release like Bigfoot? They could certainly bump up the ABV, age it in oak, etc. As long as the base beer is done right, anything is possible."
