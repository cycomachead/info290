4.91,12.9,4.25,5,5,4.5,5,"Poured in a snifter. Dark black but not quite as pitch black as other imperial stouts. Nice mocha colored head that settles. Nice aroma with solid but not overpowering bourbon. I think I pick up a pleasant hop aroma buried in there as well. Flavors of roasted malts, coffee, bourbon and even a hint of hop bitterness smoothed out with the bourbon and alcohol. One of the most well-balanced bourbon-barrel aged stouts I've had. I still put the Bourbon County Coffee and regular stout ahead, but this one might top the rest (including KBS) for me. Tough call there. Anyways this is truly well done.","redsahx","Apr 03, 2015"

You can also smell the bourbon but it isn't overpowering. Great mouth feel, viscous and chewy.  This is a delicious stout.  I'm partial to dark fruit and this didn't disappoint.  You can also taste the sweetness of the vanilla.  The bourbon then hits the palate.  Overall, this is one of the best imperial stouts I've had.  I'll definitely have it again and will serve it to guests.","MacMalt","Mar 07, 2015"

Even holding it up to the light, there is pretty much no light that comes through. The smell is sweet with some alcohol, as expected with a 12.4% abv. The first sip and you feel like you are having some dessert. I tasted some chocolate, vanilla, and maybe even some bacon. It is a stout, so there was definitely the malty flavor. Very interesting beer to taste and want to try it poured over a scoop of vanilla ice cream.","Jerebeer","Mar 01, 2015"

From that first whiff of authentic Kentucky bourbon, to the rumbly warmth and robustness of flavor, to topping out the feel with such creamy, milkshake frothiness, this is an intensely satisfying beer.  Even when compared to many classic, standard Russian imperial stouts, its booze and strength to each aspect are remarkable and clear.  You love that the alcohol is so spicy and hot, just for the sake of how fantastic it tastes, and how well it blends to the rest of what’s going on here.  It does beautiful justice to its base Narwhal, while expanding its universe.  It’s like Narwhal’s favorite grandfather; mystically wise and amazing to hang out with.","TheBrewo","Feb 10, 2015"

Aroma is that of vanilla and oak, with a nice smokey note. Taste follows the nose well. The bourbon is prominent with the sweet vanilla. There is a chocolaty aspect hidden in there, and it warms quite well in the end with a strong alcohol presence. Feel is creamy and thick, carbonation is spot on. This beer is extremely well balanced and an absolute pleasure to drink. I do think I like the regular version a little better, I'm not completely convinced it needs the barrel aged aspect, but this beer is definitely worth trying.","ZebraCakez","Jan 11, 2015"

Aroma is a nice subtle hint of whiskey, booze, barrel, and chocolate. Flavor is also mild chocolate and whiskey.

The aroma has wood, bourbon, vanilla, charcoal and chocolate.  In the taste, the whiskey is evident, cocoa and mocha like flavor also.  More complexities than standard Narwhal.  Vanilla and alcoholic flavor develops as it warms.  Full bodied, smooth, intense lingering flavor. A strong beer for strong beer drinkers.  Slightly hot, may mellow with a bit more age, but it has already aged a bit now.  A barreling project gone right.","Stinkypuss","Dec 28, 2014"

Although I personally like the whiskey characteristics to resemble more of a sweet bourbon (in that regards, I'll give a nod to BCBS), BBA Narwhal's overall complexity in aroma/flavor give it immense personality, allowing it to stand proudly on its own to garner many a bragging right.

4.41,1.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A friend picked this up for me from the brewery.  An aggressive pour yields a one finger beige head that fades quickly with a pitch black body and nice lacing.  The nose is earthy and roasty with a ton of bourbon along with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, oak, vanilla, and toffee.  The taste is roasty and boozey with nice chocolate fudge notes up front along with hints of bourbon, oak, cocoa, espresso, vanilla, subtle dark fruit, and leather.  The mouthfeel is moderately thick and mouth-coating but velvety smooth with very little warming or burn considering the ABV and boozieness. Overall, Narwhal is a great beer, but this BA version is world class.  Bold and flavorful without being hot and boozey.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Dec 14, 2014"

Light dark fruitiness with a pleasant warming alcohol that lasts long into the finish. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a silky creamy mouthfeel. Nice sipper, I enjoyed it for a couple of hours. I would have liked a bit less cardboard especially with the enormous price tag this bottle came with.

The flavor has a bit of a sour wood element not needed.  Sure the beer is still amazing, it's aged in bourbon!  It is a a great stout, but you won't compare this one to bourbon county stout or other epic examples.  Add in the body is a bit light.  The nose is too much bourbon not enough stout.  Well, it's still great beer but for those looking for the BEST bourbon barrel beers (to me a style but not here) this one is a B.

4.36,0.2,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"750mL bottle. Pours a viscous black color with brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is bourbon, wood, chocolate syrup, espresso, vanilla, and earth. The taste is lots of chocolate syrup and bourbon at first followed by the espresso. Really chocolatey but not overly sweet. Lots of wood and warming alcohol. Some earth and charcoal. Maybe a hint of coconut. Finishes with espresso, chocolate syrup and bourbon. Heavy mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. Probably one of the most drinkable BA Stouts I have had, which is surprising considering it is 12.9%. Overall, amazing.","PicoPapa","Nov 27, 2014"

4.83,11,4.75,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"Been looking forward to this one for a long time.  Pours a jet black, thick but not too thick that it has no carbonation.  A medium-hard pour will leave you with about a 1" head that dissipates quickly.  The nose gives you almost exclusively bourbon with a small amount of coffee and cocoa mixed in.  Now for the taste:  Upfront is a strong bourbon taste that stays with you the whole time you're sipping, and lingers well after the brew is empty.  The secondary taste has got to be dark chocolate, which blends nicely with the mild coffee flavors and provides the BA Narwhal with a hint of bitterness.  I love sweet stouts and some of the more bitter ones, but this beer seems to be in almost perfect balance with it's tastes.  As my glass gets lower I notice the beer just keeps getting smoother.  This one is definitely a mellow, relaxing sipper.  I put it right with BA Biscotti Break as one of my favorite stouts.  My only regret is that I didn't buy more than one.  I highly recommend giving this a try if you can get your hands on it.","Pourharddrinkslow","Nov 24, 2014"

The aroma is phenomenal, with big chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasty malt and bourbon. Also caught some very slight coffee notes. The flavor is also outstanding, also with chocolate, bourbon, woody flavors and lots of dark roasty malt notes as well. The mouthfeel was  thick and silky smooth, with just a slight bit of alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Overall, this ranks right up there with any of the best BBA Imperial Stouts. I'm impressed!  I've hid one in the cellar to see what a little age does to this beer.","timontheroad","Nov 09, 2014"

Hints of bourbon, but the toasted malt and other toasty aromas make the most of the aroma. Taste is bourbon and booze up front with some chocolate and vanilla. Toffee comes next with more oak and robust flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied... just would you would like in an imperial stout. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I am a huge fan of Narwhal, and the bourbon barrels just increased its complexity and depth. Need to buy more of this.","DovaliHops","Oct 25, 2014"
