"O:  Very nice stout. Might have to pick up another next time I see it."
"I thought this beer was rather thin and sweet.  Not too nuanced.  I'm not a huge fan of this style."

"2008 edition. Just as wierd as other schlafly ba stuff."
""
"Poured too cold from a 750ml bottle.  Less than a finger of head.  Dissipated quickly.  Pours a deep purplish black like a deep BlackBerry.  Dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and bourbon in the nostrils.  Dark fruit but can't place it.  Raisins?  Guessing straight KY bourbon but it does over power the aforementioned flavors.  However, I like the taste of bourbon so this isn't bad to me.  Too thin in the mouth unfortunately.  Bourbon down followed by dark chocolate, vanilla, hops and roasted malts but bourbon aftertaste.  If it was creamier, I'd love it.  Letting it warm up.  Improves the flavors in the nose and mouth.  Not bitter.  A good effort.  No idea what the abv is but I'm guessing high."
"Holy cow. Cellaring this paid off. It's a 2010. Barrel flavor comes through super good. Thin. Little foam. Not sure if I liked the 2010 last year or this year the best."
""
"2013--very good. Can see this being incredible after proper aging for a few years."
"O. A good BA stout. The are better and certainly worse. I like the way the hops mesh with the other variables to create a bitter coffee character. I dig the smell but the taste and feel fall short from the booze on the end. It's not as hot as others, but enough to influence the overall scores."

"Had a little bit of this last weekend. Good stuff! My notes from Untappd: ""Creamy, milky, a lil' funky, boozy ... lots going on here."" I was impressed. Not a perfect RIS or barrel-aged beer, but very enjoyable, smooth and delicious. I'd like to try more at some point. 4-4.25 (I rounded up to 4.5 on UT)."

"Overall, this is one hell of a sweet beer; so much so that the sweetness is in place of flavor.  This is not to be confused with boldness, it is just very sweet.  It is only after you wait three to four minutes after the sip that you begin to appreciate its subtleties of flavor.  If we’re going to be extra picky here then we do have to mention that, if you’re calling this a Russian Imperial Stout, then it just simply isn’t bitter enough.  The oak tries to work you down, in all of its sourness and char, but this appears when the beer reaches room temperature, and not really a second sooner.  Once you get used to it, it does seem to go down smoother, much in the same sense that Choklat does.  Other than general quality of ingredients, what really sets this beer apart is the heavy oakiness.  This adds to nearly every aspect of the beer, obviously including flavor as mentioned above, but it is most notable through the feel where it effectively dries off an oily base.  This is a fine beer, and perhaps a fresher bottle would have given us more of that Russian intensity, bitterness, and balance that might have put this one over the top for us."

"This is a big beer with tons of Bourbon character. The nose is a bit deceptive with some sweet tones of vanilla, coconut and the whiskey creaminess. The flavor is strong bourbon flavor as if some one spilled a shot directly into a stout. As it warms I get more chocolate from the base beer with barrel added coconut and vanilla. The finish is a bite of liquor with an after thought of raw whiskey. As bourbon barreled beers go this seems to have absorbed more of the liquor than any other stout I've had. That's a good thing for me."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of vanilla and strong bourbon notes with sweet roasted malt notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of vanilla notes with strong bourbon notes and quite a bit of residual sugar notes with light black chocolate. Body is somewhat full with an oily like texture and medium carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Bourbon notes are quite dominant but there is just too much residual sugar for my taste at the end of the day."

"Mouthfeel is week also. Made the mistake of loosing this one in the cellar until recently so I'm sure this is better fresh."

"O-A bit too old. It's aged into a beer that isn't all too Stout-like in flavor. Aside from the Oxidization, I was impressed that the whiskey barrel flavor still stuck around rather well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a-typical, especially in this era of craft beer. It just doesn't taste like a huge imperial stout loaded with bourbon. It tastes like a well balanced stout with ample, but nuanced barrel notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bros were right this is not a 90 plus bba stout.  The pour is high carbonation, but more transparent coloration than you want in a bba stout.  The aroma is quite nice with very strong coffee and chocolate with something of a coconut undertone.  The taste is weak and does not do justice to a stout more like an imperial porter, the smoothness of a bba stout is consistent.  The mouthfeel too watery but good carbonation.  Overall a sub par bba stout."

"This one is at the top of my list. It's a fine celebration brew but not for a night out. It's heavy. You need to be prepared to sit and really focus on it after dinner. Heavy malt notes. Excellent aroma and oaky undertones. You can drink it alone but you better not be needing to drive. A Thick creamy head with a nice finish."
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Just a very well made beer, which is a pleasure to drink."
""
""
"Dark black colored with just a smidgeon of light getting through when held up to a light. Brussels lacing. Nearly a half inch of khaki colored head with a few large bubbles of carbonation mixed in with what is otherwise a tightly knit head. Aroma is a luscious blend of fig, plum, black licorice, bourbon and roasted barley. The taste is a very compelling blend of sweetness along the lines of fig, black licorice, bourbon and plum. You then get the roasted barley component on the back of the palate along with the warmth of the alcohol and then it's right back to the sweet notes of fig, black licorice, bourbon and plum on the fade. The mouth is silky as well as a bit warming on the back of the palate. In summary:It's complicated, but in a good way."

"o - overall this vintage had probably seen its day. A bit thin and the stout base seems to be lacking balls, but this is fairly old for a stout."
"2013 Vintage. Poured into a snifter. The color was a little muddy and the head was very light. The smell is of the bourbon with light roasted malt. The taste is light with the bourbon coming through later. On the whole a very light stout with a small amount of bourbon. Not to be repeated."
""
""
""
"O: Schlafly puts out some nice beers, and this is no exception. But compared to many other BA brews (e.g. KBS, BCBS, Cafe Royale), this one is a little behind the curve. Not bad by any means, but simply good and solid."
""
"Appeared pretty much like a typical stout: dark brown-black color, absorbing all light except around the edges; a lively tan head sank to a wispy layer, lacing the glass slightly. Aroma of dark roasty malts, and pretty hot with bourbon. Flavors of bourbon, dark malts, roasted coffee, unsweetened cocoa, ash, with some subtle dark fruit sweetness. Medium-full body, somewhat smooth, somewhat hot...10.5%ABV was not hidden. Overall a solid BA stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a very good and interesting beer. But it's too hot. The 2010 is too hot in 2014. So some of the complexity and layers are hidden under the boozy heat, or it might be amazing."
""
"Overall: A good BA stout. Lots of traditional checkpoints you would look for but nothing is truly elite about it. The barrel character is definitely the strongest point of this brew, provides a ton of smooth creamy vanilla tones."

"O - 4.25 - This is a good beer, very unique. More dark fruits and red wine than the other imperial stouts. Not my favorite but a good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Weird beer. Its very tasty, which I guess is the most important thing. But goddamn it needs some body. Worth a try."
"O - Overall this was a fun stout, awfully sweet. Probably past its prime."
""
""
""
"Despite the appearance and a rather thin feel for this kind of brew, this beer has wonderful flavor and is a joy to drink. I passed on it several times until they offered it at my weekly beer tasting. Once I tried it, I decided to buy it the next time bottles were in stock (that was today). No buyer's remorse. None. Just good drinkin'. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Due to the presence of alcohol and the strong bourbon flavors/aromas, this is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped. Nice flavors but quite rich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bourbon, caramel and sweet vanilla dark malt flavor up front. No heat at all. Not much roastines either, maybe it's been in the cellar too long. Super smooth and velvety initially but dissolves into a too sweet syrupy mess after sitting in my glass for too long. A slow sipper but don't sip too slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, really starting to enjoy BBA stouts & RIS. But would be wonderful to taste it after 2-3 years aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - no problem knocking this one off tonight solo, but if I had to do it again, I'd make sure to have one or two to share with. It could rest a few more years but I'm not sure that heat will tame down much."
""
"Aged since 2008. Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of bourbon, sweet malt, roasted malt, yeast, alcohol, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, slight yeast, hint of hop, slight bourbon, and hint of syrup. Overall, smooth body, mellow flavors, very tasty."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this stout. Very smooth, loads of flavor, and strong presence. Will definitely order again!"

"Pretty rich flavor profile. Age would serve this beer well to tame the alcohol and open uit up. A little too sweet and bourbony. Becomes better the next day."
""
"D: a very drinkable bourbon barrel aged stout. haven't had this fresh, but I don't think time has done any damage here. very smooth bourbon stout. really enjoy the drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm always hesitant when I pull some of the older bottles to open, especially with other people, but time and again I am surprised at how good these beers develop. A nice one that I'd love to have again."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-A nice barrel aged stout but it needed to be a tad heavier and the nose was much better than the taste."
"A big, boozy, and very smooth RIS."
""
"O- not in love with this. Just seems...kind of there"
""
"O - I believe this was a perfect Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout and if you can get your hands on any, definitely pick up two."
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent barrel aged stout that I will seek out again."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad bourbon-barrel stout. Bourbon is tasty and strong, almost too strong. My main complaint is that the roasted malt isn't strong enough to hold up against it. The bourbon isn't even that strong, it's just that the malt is too weak to counter it. Overall, however, it is tasty, mellow and decent complex so I can't knock it too much. It's just on the razor's edge of going from being a good bbal stout to a great one."
"Not the most awesome barrel-aged stout. Does have some interesting aspects. Maybe I should of waited a couple more years and hoped the alcohol mellows out some."
"The '10 was my favorite, followed by the '08, the '07, and the '09. The '10 had the best nose and the best mouthfeel, though the flavor was slightly muted compared to the '07 and '08. A fine imperial stout, though it really should be thicker and bigger on flavor."
""
""
"O-this might be the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. It's so smooth and just flows down my throat. It's almost quaffable at 10.5% while some 8% RISs must be taken by the sip. I really respect that. I do think it lacks some complexity that some expect with -bal beers. it's also less bitter than many RISs, though to my pleasure."
""
""
""
"O: While this is the “Reserve” series, it certainly isn’t the best stout Schlafly has released. The body is a little too thin, but it had the flavor to instantly attract me. Not sure how this would age, but it’s a little too typical a stout to warrant the price right now."
"Overall, the bourbon barrels really play the star of this beer, and they are fantastic characteristics."
""
""
""
""
"[O] This is definitely a quality barrel aged RIS. And at a great value, I would gladly purchase again - but I don't see the need in aging it as long as I have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid offering from Schlafly. Just wish it was thicker."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber red color but turns black in the glass. Red around the edges. A slight off tan colored head. The beer is obviously bourbon forward. It is a very 50/50 balance of a stout and a bourbon ale. A perfect blent of roasted malts and bourbon ntoes. The bourbon aspect of the beer is a very rye and sour mash flavored bourbon. It adds a lot of vanilla flavors and a slight dry wood character to the beer. The beer portion is more subtle then expected. A lot of roasted malt and and a bit of a dark chocolate. The flavors are not too bold but they are balanced with the bourbon profile. A great bourbon stout and an entry to barrel aged beers."
"2008 Release -- Assertive chocolate aroma. Lovely bourbon presence. You can really taste the vanillin and some caramel notes from the barrel aging. Chocolate for days. Nice oily mouthfeel, although I would prefer a bit more viscosity as found in others in this class (e.g., Abyss, FiftyFifty). Overall, a tasty RIS! Will seek out again."
""
""
"M: A thinner full bodied. Coats the mouth."
""
"O – Thanks to RHORNER for the trade. Don’t chill this much before drinking! A good brew that was lacking on the mouth feel. RIS flavor was all there, but thinner than I’d have liked. I enjoyed the forward bourbon barrel characteristics. 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is very sweet chocolatey syrup, spices, a bit of vanilla, and just plain sugar. Its way over sweet for me but easy. The bourbon really shows in this. The flavor is good but I expexted a lot more diversity instead of being so one dimensional. Its just too sweet for me. Good but not great."
""
"O: this is a very solid brew all the way around. the complexity isn't all there for such a big brew, but it makes up for it in its fantastic balance. i feel like i'm more critical to barrel-aged stouts more so than any other style, and this one receives a thumbs up IMO. Schlafly did a great job displaying this style and I'll definitely try to pick a couple more up to sit for another year or two."
"O: A good beer. The bourbon isn't as balanced within the rest of the beer as it could be, but it's tasty. Worth checking out."
""

"86....best at room temperature or darn close"
""
""
""

"OVERALL: A fine bourbon barrel aged stout with moderate complexity. Certainly a fine brew, worthy of cellaring or consuming fresh. Impressive."
""
""
""
""
"2008 popped tonight. Dark, smooth flowing beer w/ little head if any. Very calm beer. Yet inviting. Smells of bourbon, not overpowering, but just enough to be identified.. Some vanilla hints, dark fruit, raisin, figs, carmel. Neat bit of sweetness. Very smooth beer, that as it warms up becomes even that more pleasent. Never had one fresh, but I can tell ya that after 4 years, its quite enjoyable. I'd do it again..."
"The palate reveals a moderately oxidized beer, alternatingly excellent and average, with the blend of soy, chocolate and bourbon being rather excellent (bringing to my mind the incomparable 03 BA Speedway) being superimposed to a faint fusel and solvent-like unpleasantness. Allowing it to warm up and breathe lessens this aspect while bringing out the medium-dark chocolate. The bourbon character is mellow, with some heat, a some vanilla and pairs very well with the chocolate. The soy note is mild, and works well with the beer. A firming bitterness and roasted malt flavor are present on the finish, along with a little alcohol. Medium in body, mildly carbonated, this beer feels quite nice on the palate. This beer exceeded my expectations."
""
""
""
""
"D - not bad, the whiskey stands out. The base beer is a bit anemic for how strong the whiskey character is."
"Overall: I unfortunately am very sensitive to the pseudo-butter flavors which this one is strong in the finish. For this reason, my review is lower than average."
""
"2011 vintage. This one pours a medium bodied dark, dark brown in color that turns to black when it fully collects in the glass. The beer featured no head at all and almost no lacing. The aromas consist of coconut, oak, dark sweet malts, vanilla, and it has a very, very light bourbon aspect. At this point the bourbon is almost gone but the nose is still pretty nice. This beer tastes of sweet dark roasted malts, with a nice amount of coffee and sweet chocolate, vanilla, COCONUT, with a nice oak component. It has really nice flavor and is well rounded. It could be a little thicker in body but it's ok like this. It drinks well and the flavor resonates and leaves a long lasting multifaceted aftertaste. It went very well with a double chocolate cookie!!!"

"Review 800! 2008 vintage 750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly clear almost pitch black color with a small tan head with good retention; that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, raisin, molasses, bourbon, earth, and light herbal. Fairly nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, oak, bourbon, earth, and light herbal hops. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, chocolate, toffee, toast, bourbon, oak, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity; and minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is fairly well hidden; with only a warming after the finish noticed. Definitely a slow sipper. Overall this is a nice barrel aged imperial stout. Nice balance and good complexity of flavors. It did not impress me as much as I would have hoped though."
""
""
"Overall, very good."
"O - Solid! This BBA Impy stout delivers! Not the best but it's in the elite category."
""
"Drink- I knew I was mad for a reason when I gave this bottle up to a trading partner. I am glad Matt hooked it up with this nice treat."
"O: Overall a really impressive bba stout. I've tried 2010 and 2011 vintages as well, and while I liked them all quite a bit, this vintage may be as good as it gets. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium full bodied, just a little chewy. Moderate carbonation. Maybe a bit of a cola feel to the body. Overall pretty drinkable for the style, mostly due to the toned down alcohol heat and slightly thinner mouthfeel. Not exceptional but very good nonetheless, a step down from the really heavy hitters, mostly because of the lighter weight body. It’s not uber complex but it’s damned good."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, 2011 vintage. This doesn't appear to be a very thick pour, anyways this pours mostly black color with light able to penetrate the edges along with a decent foamy mocha head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of bourbon and alcohol, not much of the traditional stout. The feel is medium, almost thick but thinner than most IRS. The taste is of bourbon, alcohol, along with some dark roasted malts."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not too shabby, wonder what more recent vintages are like? May just have to seek some out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Overall it was a pretty good beer, but not one I really found outstanding in it's class. The woody oak overshadowed the beer flavors a little in my opinion. Pretty good beer overall though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice bourbon barrel imperial stout. Not outstanding, but better than most. A beer I would have no problem drinking again."
"O: A big let down, I mean I start with their Pumpkin beer which is world class number 2 alltime and then I get slapped around for trying other stuff. I was hoping for alot more with this beer. It tastes almost exactly like EVO XO Bourbon barrel stout. Good stuff for a sweeter imperial."
""
""
"Drinkability: Picked up out of state, this is definitely a one of. A rich and flavorful beer, glad to have had it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm very pleased that I got to try this beer that's been aged in bourbon barrels for several years. The aromas and flavors are nice, but there's still quite a bit of heat within this beer. While I don't regret trying it at this time, I bet this will get even better with a bit more age. Overall, this is a solid offering from Schlafly, and I look forward to trying more of their creations."
"O- A really nice bourbon barrel aged stout, very easy to drink. Definitely will have to pick up a bottle of 2011 to see how it is fresh, but I am really liking how the 2008 is drinking right now."
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice barrel-aged stout with a pleasant balance of flavors. It would be even better if the alcohol presence were more muted."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good bourbon stout, but would probably have benefited/mellowed from some aging."
""
""
"B+"
"Overall, this is not a bad tasting beer, but sort of a letdown for a barrel aged beer in this style I think."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown into my pint glass. There is hardly any head on top. The aroma is sweeter than expected with hints of berry, dark chocolate, raisin, and a definite bourbon zing. There's some lacing present on the glass as it goes down, and the beer definitely coats the mouth fully as well. At first the body of it seems light, but the finish is a little 'hot' and boozy - an abundance of bourbon. Not such a bad thing, however. The flavor is similar to the aroma yet there are traces of vanilla I did not pick up until sipping. I would have liked more of a roasted malt character to come through stronger. All in all not bad at all though."
"Just a super strong and tasty Bourbon barrel-aged Imperial Stout."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: ts way better on-tap than the bottle. ts awfully powerful and ts comparable to a great mpy le Founder's or a Russian impy like Raspy."
""
"D: This was a super well balanced bourbon stout that had a nice scent and taste. The body was great, and the alcohol was hidden pretty well, so it was crazy easy to drink. Less bourbon-y than a lot of other beers in this class, but still really tasty. Not quite my favorite of the style, but still recommended."

"Overall: Great nose/taste but underwhelming mouthfeel."
""
""
"O: Seems the age has really mellowed this one out compared to other reviews I'm reading from newer vintages. I need to drink one fresh as this one was good but not great...probably at it's peak if not past."
"Good stout, but I didnt think it quite lived up to the hype of the ""Reserve"" title"
""
""
""
""
"Full body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue, a little dry too. A really nice example of the barrel aged stout - it's still pretty hot, but not over the line. Even better, this is pretty easy to find."

"Notably, I haven't changed the ratings over the five vintages I've tried. The look is generally iffy between 3.5 and 4 though; the '06 really had a good head for such an old beer. The rest has been very consistent (maybe not identical though) from year to year. Honestly I probably liked the 06 version best but that may just say that aging this beer is the way to go."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this stout. I picked up a few bottle after trying it at a bottle share get together at Linwood Liquors with my buddy Jake. Thanks for turning me on to this one I have a couple in the cellar for the future. I would recommend this to everyone, but wish I would have tried this one fresh. Great brew 9.5 out of 10 in my opinion."
"Taste is on the desert sweet side. Nice chocolate and milk balance with a good bitter finish. Really easy to drink with a nip in the carbonation. Lots of alcohol on the side!"
"Overall - I like it. I usually like - not love - Schlafly’s imperial offerings, with a small handful of them blowing me away. This one, I could see aging very well. I remember the 2009 (maybe 2008?) version being excellent. This one has a sweetness and some yeasty heat that, in my opinion, could use some calming down - and would, with age. A good imperial stout, bordering in many ways on a strong ale and having a lot in common with the brewery’s own barleywine."
"O-A great well balance beer, a true treat that should be savored. Strongly suggest letting this one sit. Had a taste of a 2010, and it was ok, this 2008 is a gem. Wonderful brew."
"Overall: a lovely beer at close to room temp."
"Mouthfeel is rather light for 10.5%. Smooth texture and surprisingly drinkable. Overall, a solid barrel aged stout. Maybe a little boozy for some but I'm digging it."
"The sweetness makes it somewhat easy to drink, despite the high ABV. It's a good beer that everyone should try, but it is strong and I have a feeling the alcohol will hit you without notice."
"O: I believe that age has done some favors for this brew as the bourbon is strong, but comes through smoothly with no aggression. This beer is proof that a high quality bba stout can be produced and released with out a exorbitant price tag or endless amounts of hype."
"Overall: This beer bummed me out. I might have expected too much, but I could not drink even half the bottle. I just think its past it prime or it might be infected."
"O: 3.5."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark black with a 1 inch puffy dark tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A thick curtain of lace sticks to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and the barrel aged aromas - vanilla, bourbon, and oak. However, the smells are very subdued on the first pour but get better as the beer warms. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, some dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla, and a dry wood flavor on the finish. There is a very mild roast flavor that fades from the palate quickly after each sip. A slight alcohol kick in the mouth with each sip. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good RIS with a really good aroma that comes around as the beer warms but the taste is not as good as I was hoping for."
"O: Other than the thin mouthfeel, this beer is very well done."
"I’ve been hanging onto this bottle for several years. I don’t know how it was fresh, but it’s simply excellent at this point. I do think it would benefit from a bit more body, but that’s nitpicking. The flavor rocks. If you bump into a bottle of this, pick it up and put it back for a few years. You’ll be glad you did."
"Medium body, maybe a tad thin, but that is really being picky. Some alcohol burn still, but not overwhelming. Very well rounded. A very well made beer. I enjoyed this one as much as the barleywine."
"My second Schlafly beer, and my second great experience with this brewery. And, admit it, you know you're a hopeless beer geek when you can not only spell Franziskaner, Weihenstephaner and Westvleteren without looking, but also spell Schlafly without screwing it up."
"O: I've had my eye on this for a while, I was pleasantly pleased to find bottles of it sitting around for $11. This is a great value and a beer that's easy to find where it's distributed. I would say this is great at this 2-3 year age, any longer and it might lose it's luster."
"Good brew that could use a touch of tweaking. I hope I can grab one to cellar, but I got it online ($10.99) so who knows."
"Overall- I live in STL and get to have this all the time and while it is not the top tier BA RIS out there it is one of my favorites and would recommend it to any one."
"O - It tastes good, but is too boozy and too thin."
"(D)- A rockin' stout with a hefty barrel character in the profile. Despite it being around 2years old, its got plenty of life left to go in it. Solid stuff. I can imagine this would be very hot and boozy fresh."
"Barrel aged imperial stouts are like sex; when it's great, it's great. And even when it's not, well it's still pretty good. File Schlafly Reserve Imperial Stout under the latter, not the most tantalizing around but still has its good moments."
"OVERALL: This is an average bourbon barrel aged stout at best, and the thinner look and feel certainly don’t help. I’d heard good things about this beer, but then again, I’ve heard good things about a lot of average beers. A worthy brew that would be good to share with friends, but not something worth getting worked up about. Thanks again for the opportunity to give this one a go Craytonic."
"O: My first ever beer from Schlafly and I'm quite impressed, they just need a name that's easier to spell."
"2008 vintage. This one pours a medium bodied dark, dark brown in color that turns to black when it fully collects in the glass. The beer featured no head at all and almost no lacing. The aromas consist of coconut, oak, dark sweet malts, vanilla, and it has a very, very light bourbon aspect. At this point the bourbon is almost gone but the nose is still pretty nice. This beer tastes of sweet dark roasted malts, with a nice amount of coffee and sweet chocolate, vanilla, COCONUT, with a nice oak component. It has really nice flavor and is well rounded. It could be a little thicker in body but it's ok like this. It drinks well and the flavor resonates and leaves a long lasting multifaceted aftertaste."
"O: I respect Schlafly immensely, I've been floored by some of their efforts, and I really wanted to love this one, but I ultimately was not impressed. Additionally, considering this was the 2008 version, one has to assume that this is about as good as this beer is going to get. That said, this was a real letdown to me. :("
"O: Overall this was a thick,smooth and tasty Imperial Stout that was well blended and balanced, Nice warming sensation in the finish, great flavor.... Thanks again Steve."
"O: This hits the spot as it is very well crafted. Perfect for a quiet evening."
" as far as the style and process go -- there are quite a few better options -- but as far as this beer goes on its' own merit it is great. i would love to try this on cask. for the price and availability -- i would go with an Old Rasputin -- but try this if you get a chance."
"The beer is dark brown and somewhat transparent. A thin, tan head rests atop the beer, leaving minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roast, caramel, malt, oak, and booze. The flavor brings subtle bourbon, which grows more present as the beer warms. Light roast and caramel, as well as some oak in there as well. The body is relatively thin for the style. Overall, an enjoyable brew, and one that seems to mellow nicely with age. I would have this again."
"O: On my first sips I was ready to be blown away, but this drops off to pretty average after a while. Flavor just isn't big enough, bourbon isn't present enough. Very close to top notch but not quite there."
"O-- Not bad but needs time to develop. Base beer was a bit hard to find at times. Very young and thought the older vintages would be more developed. Worth cellaring."
"Overall: A decent aged beer that was probably a bit better a year ago."
"I can’t say if this is aged in high grade bourbon barrels, but it doesn’t matter. I like it, a lot."
"The mouthfeel is a liitle thin for an imperial stout and there is a little heat with the alcohol. But, these are minor flaws in an otherwise superior brew. Looking forward to aging a bottle or two as I expect this will only improve with time. Way to go Schlafly."
"If you like malty, bourbony, sweeter stouts with negligible hop bite this one's for you. I've consumed and reviewed many great Imperial/American Stouts and this one ranks with the best of them. It's rich, smooth, and the alcohol is warming. Recommend it be enjoyed as your only beer of the evening. Life is good and this beer celebrates it!"
"was hoping for a bit more on this one. not having had a fresh version before, I can't tell if the bourbon qualities mellowed over time, but reading other reviews I think that may be the case. the licorice/anisette was not what I was expecting, but it was good."
"This is a very boozy, vinous imperial stout. The beer pours a little fizzy, with almost no head. The color is intensely black, with only a slight reddish hue when held to a light. The aroma is at once both intensely alcoholic and full of intense dark fruits...dark currants, berries, and a bit of dark malt. The taste is also very fruity. Warm, borderline hot, and quite rich in flavor. Bitter, but not hoppy. The beer has a moderately full body, and is nicely enjoyable."
"2010 vintage. Dark black in color with next to zero head. Smells of malt and bourbon, maybe a little maple in there. First sip was all bourbon, but as I drank the glass down i was able to get malt and some smoke. The bourbon is almost too overwhelming to catch much else as far as flavors. Mouth feel is bourbon, heavy bourbon. It keeps me waiting to catch more tastes as if finishes, but once again, all I catch is bourbon, and a nice dryness through the finish. Not so much bad, just bourbon overload. I am going to buy another bottle to age for 2 to 5 years hoping that the bourbon mellows some and I will be able to taste more of what the maker intended me to taste."
"Would think it would mellow out with some age, but this bottle was already 3 years old."
"Pours a very dark black. Light tan head. Looks thin overall for an imperial stout. The smell is big on this one. Big bourbon notes, chocolate, roasty, coffee. The bourbon sticks out as the main aroma though. This beer neeeds time in the bottle, maybe 1-2 years to mellow. The taste follows the aroama. Big bourbon flavor, dark chocolate on the mid-palate, and a boozy finish. I would let this beer sit another 1-2 years before sampling again. It has potential though, and really this beer isn't bad, just needs some time."
"In it's extreme youth, this is a bit awkward of a beer, but it shows immeasurable potential to benefit from age. It's a touch sweet and sopping with oaky bourbon- as evidenced by that huge coconut aroma- but the combination of the sweet and smoky meat flavors should be brilliant and mellow in 5-6 years. Overall, not a bad brew at all. Glad I got just a taste this time, and next time I'll cellar one for some years."
"Overall, I found that I may have started drinking the bottle too cold as it got more and more good as it warmed slightly. A toffee flavor really starts to prevail with the warming."
"Full bodied and firm. Sweet and rich, but not quite cloying. Enough balance to prevent it from being overwhelming."
"Pours a rich, near black color with thin cap of khaki colored head, little retention and lacing. Great scent that combines burbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, roasted cocoa beans, roasted coffee beans, black cherry, hints of brown sugar sweetness. Taste brings the components of scent together nicely without being overly powerful, the bourbon has mellowed and lost its burn, but not its flavor, the burbon, vanilla and oak cover oup the underlying stout flavors, which can't be judged alone. Heaier side of medium bodied, but thinner than expected from such a big beer. A nice beer that showcases the bourbon barrel againg and is quite drinkable with the burn aged off."
"D - Good beer, and a pleasant surprise. Big fan of BA stouts and would drink this one again."
"Saint Louis is the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch, one of the world's most commercial, industrial breweries, but Schlafly Reserve harks back to a time when craftsmanship and individual ingenuity still had merit. The use of bourbon-barrel - even four years aged - has a commanding, overarching influence that adds intensity and complexity to the standard American strong stout. A beer for those in the mood to shun the conventional."
"Gift from biegaman at least a couple years ago, 2007 edition. Pours black as tar with a two finger tan head that reduces but never goes away, solid foamy ring with sticky sheet lace. Hmmm, looks good! Aroma of malted milk chocolate prevails, sweeter tones imparted from the bourbon, lots of nutty impressions. Taste full and flavourful in the mouth, chocolate and heat, nutty and sweet, some smoke; aftertaste is a touch too alcohol for my liking. But man oh man, does it linger! This is alternatively sweet and delicious, bitter and biting, smooth mouthfeel, creamy texture, a really pleasant Imperial Stout with a kick-ass finish,"
"O- Seemed kinda of a mess. I struggled drinking this one."
"Dig it."
"O: Overall, not a bad beer, but this beer tastes more like the barrel it was aged in than the beer that went into the barrel. It at least avoids being cloyingly sweet or extremely alcoholic like some other bourbon barrel stouts."
"2010 vintage. Pours jet black w/ a 1 finger caramel head which quickly goes away. Smells like chocolate, malt, and bourbon- great smelling beer! Bourbon is definitely in the forefront on the taste, w/ chocolate and malt in the background. Not as thick and chewy as I thought it would be, but a great tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very smooth, but not silky. Goes down very easily, although at 10.5% it's a sipper. Nice beer, and it would be good to age one of these for a few years."
"Drinkability: The beer is not bad but it's not really a winner for me. The flavors just are not big enough for style. The barrel aging delivered, but the rest of the beer did not. Perhaps some age would mellow the barrel aging components and this beer could balance out."
"Overall this is the perfect description/example of Russian Imperial Stout on the planet. Not the most complex by any means but the best to style, well-balanced RIS I've ever had. Get it, cellar it, enjoy eventually; highly recommended!"
"Highly recommend this beer, even if you don't really like stouts generally, this style is like nothing you can find out there and this beer is a great example."
"I was very impressed with the dark, earthy tone of the beer. There was almost no head, which kept this from a perfect score. The smell had the strong tones of Chocolate, coffee, and I believe cloves and ginger. Yet, there was a very strong alcohol smell. I guess at 10% alcohol, this should not be a surprise. The taste was great. Very smooth with the rich chocolate and coffee, but very hot due to the alcohol. The mouth was nice and oily with a richness to the tongue. Finally, it was very drinkable and I found myself going back to the glass for more."
"D: drinkable but somewhat flat in middle and needs a bit more depth all-around"
"overall this is a solid beer for what i paid for it."
"Bottled in 2008"
"I can't recommend this."
"D: I think this beer is well crafted, but not great. I am interested to see how it develops over a couple years. I know that the baseline is great, but unfortunately the barrels carry the beer right now, it's not consensual."
"Nice dark stout poured from a huge 750 into a snifter. This really is a nice Bourbon Barrel aged Stout. Lots of Carmel, vanilla,and bourbon. Not real boozy, but the booze is there in the background. I'm pleasantly impressed with this beer and hope it remains available for future consumption."
"Overall, I would go for it again in a second if I found it in a store and would be curious to try their other yearly batches."
"D - Okay, but I was expecting a little more from a decently graded BA imperial stout. A little thin with muddled flavors and a little boozy - especially for having a couple year's age on it."
"Very drinkable for it's strength, drink with caution. A solid imperial stout. Different than expected due to less roasted character but still very enjoyable."
"This was a great Christmas present, very smooth and yet full flavored with loads of bourbon. This has aged very gracefully and I hope I can find some more to store away in the cellar."
"Notes: This is my first review of 2011 and it's good beer to pick up. A great sipper or it could even be enjoyed as a dessert beer. Cheers."
"Notes: All and all a good beer, with a nice balance of vanilla/oak/bourbon flavors and dark-malt/chocolate flavors. I had some chocolate with it, which made a lot more vanilla come out in the beer, and made the chocolate taste like it was coated in caramel. Yummy."
"At 10.5%abv, this one is dangerously drinkable. I served it at about 50F and that seemed to be the perfect temp for this one. I would go no colder. Suicide Silence's ""Wake Up!"" is busting my eardrums and this beer certainly screams Wake Up! as well. Highly enjoyable."
"The thickness hindered me at first, and then the ABV kicked in, but the beer comes together and makes for an incredible drinking experience."
"d - A very good RIS that smells outstanding. I loved this one and think the 08 is drinking phenomenal right now. Going to pick up another of these."
"Suprisingly thin bodied and watered down with lots of oak and peaty bourbon notes. The maltiness from the aroma is there bu once again it's kind of disappointingly faint. The flavor is overly dominated by bourbon/alcohol sweetness and heat. This beer was way too young at this stage(sampled when fresh)."
"Overall it's a nice beer, but it will not be my first choice for an imperial stout."
"It's a little thin on the mouth for so much flavor and alcohol, but the alcohol is pretty well masked. Doesn't taste like a 10.5% stout. I'm glad I got to try this one, not disappointed at all."
"Was a tad underwhelmed with this one, but it is a decent beer, and something I'm glad I was able to try."
"Sampled this at Savor '10 (sorry for the delay in reviewing...my notes are all over the place). Black with a thin beige head, though good retention and lacing. Smelled of sweet milk chocolate, with only a modest hint of coffee and anise. The taste also was decidedly sweet chocolate, from the start through the finish. Feel was a little on the thin side for an imperial stout as well, though smooth due to no carbonation. This beer would benefit greatly from a more robust flavor profile; way too sweet for me now."
"drinkability - the flavor is up there with the best KBS, BCS - the body being so thin ruins it a little"
"good but not my favorite BA beer. Not too pricy and not ridiculously high ABV, but a little too boozy for me. I prefer a BCBS than this."
"dark brown color, seemed like there was some dark purple showing up when it was pouring into the glass. Rich dark tan head at pour diminishing to puny thin tan lacing on the glass. Heavy malt and chocolate in the aroma, I like it. Thicker, heavier mouthfeel. Little alcohol up front, but heavy on the finish, very warming. Malt very prevalent in the beginning of the drink. Chocolate night quite as noticable on the tongue as it is to the nose. Some darker fruits noticable as the beer warms. As the alcohol feel leaves the beer finishes pretty cleanly. Soft sweetness left, not really much in terms of bitterness or funky flavors to leave you with. Didn't really get much of the oak flavor from the aging, maybe some of the oaked sweetness, but not near as much oakiness that i was expecting from something aged in oak. Overall a good one to help shake the cold off and sip on. I would expect this one to cellar well, I think I might try it myself if I can resist that long."
"It is a little thin on the tongue, but suprisingly smooth."
"nigh black, the dankest of browns, froth of tan. vanilla, oak, chocolate, some bourbon, a little roast. It tastes wonderful, the barrels becoming one with the beer. Time has done this beer justice and probably would for some time. The roasted chocolate vanilla thing going on in the flavor makes it lovely as it somehow finishes with very little astringency, opting instead for a silky flow. Damn nice, one of the standouts of the first night."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a light enjoyable level of carbonation. The bourbon flavor included in this brew was very enjoyable and it's something I would certainly enjoy again. During our tasting a number of highly praised beers were sampled and this one was one of if not the most memorable for me."
"Bottle from 2009 Pours dark choclate brown with a one finger tan head that left spotty lacing. Very strong aroma of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and has a hint of caramel. Taste was silky smooth with soft carbonation with flavors of oaky bourbon, chocolate, dark roasted coffee, vanilla and wood with a full body and has a nice warming finish. Excellent imp stout."
"D - much milder that most bourbon stouts. The bourbon flavor is not in your face like most others. However, it slight lack of Imperial Stout flavor is a negative. Quite drinkable if it is there, but quite passable as well."
"Pours a deep black with a thin mocha head that lasts around for a good period of time. The nose brings bourbon, oak, roasted malt, vanilla, and some chocolate. The taste adds a bit of booze and really emphasizes some nice bourbon and roasted malt character. Good alcohol heat to match a bit of sweetness and dry oak. Overall, a really nice and drinkable beer; the best that I've had from Schlafly."
"D - The modest bourbon presence keeps the drinkability of this RIS pretty high. Tasty stuff!"
"Despite some odd qualities, it was overall enjoyable. I finished the whole thing, but probably would have been a good bottle to split with someone."
"High ABV detracts from drinkability."
"2007 vintage is holding up quite well. Some residual whiskey notes are still barely perceptible, blending more with the alcohol note in the beer rather than presenting an independent flavor. Charred oak, bitter chocolate and deep roasted malt flavors are predominant. Surpisingly less substantial in the mouth than one would expect, but still sufficient mouthfeel."
"D: Very drinkable for the style. I found the taste quite pleasing and while this brew is not elite, it is very good."
"This is a solid brew that isn't overly complex, but can still hold your interest."
"drinkability - was eager to try this, not at all disappointed, could have mellowed a bit for a 2 year old brew but overall lots of complexity and taste."
"Holy Moly, this is a beautiful liquid poem. What pours looking ok (almost no head with a dark brown cola color) hides an impressive imperial stout with characteristics much like the bourbon barrel it slept in. In the scent lies many smokey sweet notes like peach, raisin, the scents I notice with bourbon. Taste is simply overwhelmingly of bourbon, it tastes like makers mark. This beer is incredibly thick but considering the ABV, it masks much of that well. Overall a good beer (first sake, now bourbon, what will I find that they've aged my next brewski in?)"
"D: Very drinkable. Almost dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is not tasted and the flavors are complex and rich. Not as drinkable as 2007 but very close."
"I had no problem drinking it surprisingly really. Everything about this beer is below average. That said an interesting attempt and well hell who doesn't love bourbon in their stouts?"
"I did it; I gave Schlafly another shot and it came up short."
"Mmmm, velvety smooth chocolate. Bourbon barrel character is evident, but far from overpowering. Has just enough roast, hop and alcohol bitterness on the finish. Not overly complex, but the flavors really work nicely for me. Could use a bump in body to get a nice, viscous and creamy feel, but that is really the only complaint I have. Vanilla flavors are really nice as it warms and a nutty aspect appears that I am really digging. Schlafly has achieved a smoothness that is rarely accomplished in a big Impy Stout. Fantastic brew, I really enjoyed this one and was quite surprised by how much so."
"Overall/notes: Ah, I've avoided good Missouri brews for too long. I've only had Schlafly's more common brews such as the Pale Ale and APA, but this is a really fine Imperial Stout. I think it'd be perfect to drink in the winter time... You know what that means: Time to get another bottle!"
"D - Neither blew me away, but still both were good solid RIS. Would have like more flavors from either malts or barrel aging, they all seemed to blend together. Still wouldn't be a bad beer to hang on to for a few years."
"D: Good"
"overall a very nice imperial stout."
"I'm a bourbon guy and a stout guy so I may be a bit biased. I also really like schlafly's products but I would recommend this to anyone that likes a stout. It is a tad sweet but not overpowering. I need to acquire a few more bottles for aging. This was a 2009. Doubt I could let them age much though."
"overall - very drinkable and tasty. i had a good pour that night, but could drink the whole bottle without much problem."
"Excellent marks for drinkability. I had this 750 mL bottle mostly alone... I gave about 1 ounce to my father... but dang, it went down VERY easily. The alcohol wasn't noticeable, until I stood up. This goes down DECEPTIVELY easily. Damn, I could have done a growler of this, given the time. Easily the best barrel-aged RIS I have had to date."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Carmelized brown sugar and black liquorice, with a porter-like sourness. The aftertaste is made of a cedar woodiness and alcohol spice."
"Pretty nice barrel aged stout although it's not in the upper echelon of the class. The hot booze definitely makes this a sipper. A good beer with an experience that I am enjoying."
"This Imperial Stout is heavy in body, moderately carbonated, a little slick, and has a warm but not too boozy finish."
"D - Not terrible, but in the realm of barrel aged stouts this one is lapped by the field... For a beer that takes itself so seriously (packing in a box), this is no prime time offering... An average at best RIS that is not worth the price of admission..."
"If this beer is this uneven, I don't think I'll gamble on other bottles."
"I will write a revised review if I drink a bottle of this 2008 vintage that is better. I have more in my cellar. This bottle, though, is very solid - a damn good beer - but far from spectacular."
"Note: 2008 vintage"
"Poured a murky dark brown, like a roasted chestnut color. Pretty light colored actually. Scant head left no lace. Nice roasty and coffeelike aroma, hint of sherry from oxidation. Touch of vanilla as well, but oak is muted. Decently malty, hint of metallicness. Roast comes after the vanilla and caramel sweetness and brings a touch of leather and smoke as well. Bourbon gives it a bit more complexity so I'll bump it up half a point. A bit light however. The carbonation is moderate but nothing like what a velvety RIS should be. I wouldn't buy this for the price tag it comes with."
"D- i found this to be very enjoyable and something that i wish i had more access to this one. its excellent for the price. something i consider to be under rated. check this one out if you havnt or get the chance. too strong for a second bottle. but i savored the one that i had."
"Overall, I don't know if I got a bad bottle or this brew is on the way down hill. In any case, I did not enjoy this one and was very disappointed, as I really liked the Barleywine Reserve."
"Overall, a really nice bourbon barrel aged stout. The flavors really develop nicely and there is good complexity. The sweey bourbon is a nice highlight, but the vanilla and chocolate notes really stood out as great in my mind."
"D- A very drinkable beer for such high alcohol... but the booze will catch-up to you. Good now- but I think a few more years of age may do wonders for this one."
"overall another solid beer from schlafly....hands above the bottle of black ops i opened saturday and i have no problem admitting it...would seek this out before black ops again....very very solid"
"EDIT: i am now...2 hours later.... at the end of my bottle...this beer has grown on me and i appreciate it more now then at first pour. slow is the way to drink this. very enjoyable evening."
"This is a steller beer! I am completely surprised. Very smooth, creamy, medium to full body. Tons of velvety chocolate, bourbon, and malty. By the way, this is a 2008 vintage. Age probably mellowed this out slightly. A great drinker...incredibly smooth! Booze warmth is mild...but noticable. I would have this again in a heartbeat!"
"Vintage 2008. Pours black, translucence along extermities, small to medium tan head, finely beads cling to the edge of the glass and long retention, splatters of lacing around the glass. Aromas of oak, raisin, somewhat hoppy or dry maltiness, touch salty, doughy, little bourbon. The bouquet is a weak point, though the flavor delivers more. Tastes of oak, cookielike malt, fairly assertive bitterness, bit leafy, maple, finish has licorice and heavy caramel malts. Moderate to full body, carbonation is similar, net effect is a bit too light on the palate. Enjoyable barrel aged stout, not spectacular, but something I would buy from time to time. Full flavored and meant to be drank."
"The beer is medium body and really tastes like woody liquor. Nice sweetness up front, really smooth overall. Its probably the best beer I tried from them so far. There is a slight heat to the whole thing that is a little off putting but that would probably fade if someone would bother aging this beer."
"Drinkability is not to bad but for the money you good do a lot better."
"The beer isn't bad by any means, but I think it may not have benefited from this much age. It just seems to have lost some of the luster that is implied by the bolder bourbon notes toward the finish. It seems a little thin overall, or at least thinner than it was intended. Not bad; I just wish I had drunk it sooner."
"D- This beer is very good to say the least. The tap version is amazing and the bottle is something I need to get into. Good beer for the cellar and the $12 price tag is good for a BA beer."
"D - On the low side because of flavor intensity and ABV but high on the goodness."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and light, oily and with a fair amount of carbonation."
"Taste is huge on the oak and wood, very sharp. Mouthfeel is very smooth and crisp. The light booze from the bourbon is ok and really just lubricates it down your throat and keeps the drinkability pretty high."
"D: Overall, great tasting beer but highly lacking in all other aspects. Not much to look at, a bit too bourbon forward on the nose, and honestly, an utter fail in the feel. Great taste though as this is one of the few beers to achieve a nice balance between the bourbon and other complexities in the flavor. Still, I wouldn't recommend this one to others. It just doesn't stand up to some of the bigger, bolder, RISs."
"A decent beer, but not on par with the big boys when it comes to barrel aged stouts."
"Pours an extremely dark, nearly opaque ruby black-brown with a frothy tan head that dissipates quickly into a small surface whisp. A small bit of sudsy lacing is produced. The nose is brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, dark chocolate, and a hint of smoke, but is mostly pretty sweet with an alcoholic kick. The taste kicks the bourbon up a notch, adding in some of that brown sugar, chocolate, and smoke, and introducing some wood as well. Again, there's an alcoholic burn, but not quite as much. The body is a very heavy medium, with a light kiss of carbonation and a smooth, almost oily feel. Overall, a solid, very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability pretty good, a robust bourbon barrel beer that's a touch hot but fairly smooth in spite of the obviously high ABV. I'm sure the age has done this well, I'm not sure there's enough malt for it to run too much longer though (I've found bourbon barrel beers to sometimes swing to heavy towards the bourbon as the malt fades over time)."
"Impression: Love the fruitier aspects and less roasty/chocolaty/coffee aspects of this beer. I'd love to try this again, but Shlafly makes only brief, and quite expensive, appearances here."
"Loads of booze present up front here mingled with the dark roasted malts and licorice flavors of this RIS... It's almost cloyingly sweet at this point and has me wondering if a little time might calm this one down... The bourbon is a bit overwhelming at this point... Still a good beer but just needs a little more time to mature.. I will be back to this one for sure once its had time to settle down a bit...."
"Drinks really well. I keep wanting more. ABV and the overall filling quality of the stout leave me fairly satisfied without overdoing it, but then again, I find it much easier to consume than many of it's brothers in bourbon stout styling. Perhaps one of the more easily consumable of these that I've had for a while, though such drinkability requires a fondness for bourbon and a tolerance for the alcohol."
"Overall, a great bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stout. I'm glad I got to try this and would gladly have it again. The only problem is after having Barrel Aged Czar Jack earlier in the day (Town Hall) this doesn't hold a candle to it..."
"Thanks Brad!"
"Overall Impression: It's actually a good beer, but not a great value. Definitely worth trying, but only if you have the cash."
"D: Good drinking beer. Best Schlafly beer I have ever had."
"The mouthfeel seems to become more aqueous the more I sip on this, but I think it's mostly from the carbonation. Yes this beer is drinkable, but I don't really want a drinkable bourbon aged imperial stout. I want something that bold, complex, and mind numbingly difficult to put words to all the flavours I'm experiencing. I'd say it's just a really well done balanced imperial stout, yet nothing I'd go out of my way to obtain. If you like imperial stouts, then check this out; otherwise, it's not worth the money. You won't be blown away."
"D-this beer is so well put together in terms of smell and taste. Great complexity with everything blending together very well. Nothing is too dominant; but everything has a presence. Wish it was a fuller body and better color."
"D: A totally under the radar RIS that doesn't get the respect it deserves! Very nice."
"Consumed: 2/3/2010"
"I thought this one has some of the better tasting bourbon barrel character, but if you don't like the taste of bourbon I can't see you liking this."
"Man, this is one nice barrel aged stout. This is drinking beautifully at somewhere around 18-24 months in the bottle. This is a great example of how to do bourbon barrel aging right; it's complementary and does not dominate the flavor. It's maybe just a touch too sweet to be exceptional; some more roasty flavor may just take it to that level, but that's nitpicking because this is a great beer. Well done Schlafly."
"This 2008 bottle was left at my house by SurlySober, so a big thank you to him!"
"this is a straight sipper, even after an entire pizza i was put in my place by this bourbon barrel stout. i find this is much smoother on tap than in the bottle."
"thanks to my brother who brought this to me from st. louis over thanksgiving."
"D: The alcohol is not really present, so it's not as though this beer is hard to drink. It's got some good things going on, but it didn't seem to come together quite as well as it could have."
"D: For 10.5% abv the alcohol is not overpowering. Its there, and you feel it creep up slowly with that familiar warming feeling in the pit of your stomach, but the alcohol never wallops you at any point. Polishing off this 750mL will be plenty for me NYE, but it is an enjoyable task and for the price I paid for this bottle ($8.99) I am quite pleased with the finished product. A nice RIS to ring in the new decade."
"Initially the bourbon seems to dominate, but as it warms the other subtle flavors emerge. This one could use a little more time aging and it will continue to get better."
"Pours dark brown with a beige head. Aroma is alcohol and chocolate with some oak and a little bit of smoke. The flavor is heavy on the chocolate and vanilla. You get some alcohol warming and the mouthfeel is very creamy, even though it is a little thinner than expected. For some reason when I drank this beer it reminded me of Black Xantus, but since I have not tasted them side-by-side I am not sure how accurate that is."
"2007. Very dark brown, not quite opaque with ruby highlights. It had a fine, light tan cap and left lots of spotty lace behind on the glass. Aromas were of vanilla and whisky, not overly boozy, with some roast and caramel in the background. The flavour was more of the same with mild bitterness. There was a hint of leafy hops, mild alcohol, chocolate, and a lot of sweetness. Full bodied with low, smooth carbonation. Overall, it was pretty good, but not as bold as I expected."
"Only slightly syrupy with an edge of carbonation that hides the thickness well. The bitterness on the back end makes you ache for that next sweet sip."
"Drinkability: Not low, but not too high either; love the smell, flavor and feel; the ABV is a bit high for too much; I could definitely sip on this for a couple of hours though on a cold night."
"Impressive. I've had better RIS, but there's no denying that this is excellent stuff."
"I would imagine scores will vary widely depending whether you want your barrel flavors to be dominating or just something to add to the complexity. I prefer the latter option, so this did not impress me as much."
"Inky dark brown body, topped by a finger of creamy, thick, bright khaki head. Nose of molasses, bourbon, vanilla, roasted barley, smoky peat, and sherry. Nice. Charred malt and roasted coffee bitterness up front. Quickly gets pushed aside by rummy fruit sweetness and semi-sweet chocolate. Oak, vanilla, and bourbon make their presence known before a tannic, woody, herbally bitter finish. Great balance and perfect bourbon levels (i.e. not too hot and liquor-y). Full body with a creamy, smooth feel (gentle carbonation). Very nice."
"Thanks to bort11 for the opportunity to try this. Poured the color of cola with red highlights when backlit. No head, just a soapy skim. Nose is malty with hints of vanilla, cocoa and coffee. Taste follows nose - the barrel-aging definitely comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light, but lacking viscosity and chewiness. An easy drinking RIS with some complexity, but not really a bold BA beer."
"D - A very subtle yet complex beer which has drinkable aspects, yet not over the top. The bourbon barrel is utilized well and makes this a drinkable example"
"hop bitterness is good and appropriate to keep the big beer in check. i must say, too, the heat on this bad boy is well disguised"
"The dryness actually makes it more drinkable seeing as we wanted to take another sip sooner rather than later. The alcohol is there but never reaches too high. We are sure age will do this beer good, but drinking it now was a treat for sure."
"Drinkability echos the carbonated bourbon analogy. This is a sipper for sure. The alcohol makes itself known and dictates a laid back approach to the glass. Smooth it is, intolerant of carelessness it is not. Take your time and plumb the depths of your glass. Enjoy the better than bourbon sensation. This is a brew to be savored and enjoyed for what it is. A meeting of bourbon and beer at a genteel but visceral level. That said I did drink it myself and am ready for more. I got this on sale for six bucks a bottle, down from thirteen. This is a good buy at the original price. On sale it is a gift. Buy four for a song and cellar three. This one will only improve with time and right now it is a very good beer. The future is so bright ya' gotta wear shades."
" A well balanced beer that is perfect with chocolate or as a dessert beer. What warmth and excellent balance this beer contains."
"D - I have had this at FOBAB and remember it being better than this sweet, boozy, vanilla mess."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Bottle from Party Source (2007 bottle). This beer, part of the ""Reserve"" series, pours nearly black with a medium thin tan head that dissipates slowly. Patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate malt, bourbon and coffee. Rich, chewy body with flavors of chocolate liquer, dark fruit and malt plus some coffee. The finish is rich and malty with a coffee aftertaste. Solid all around."
"But then it starts to exceed what I expect. I had an instant reaction to the taste. It has the bitter coffee taste right away, but the is not just about the immediate taste. It develops over a few seconds in your mouth, leaving behind an immaculate aftertaste of coffee, roasted nuts, chocolate and a hint of bourbon: a perfect balance. The feel is also surprising. Though it is slightly carbonated, which I usually don't prefer, the robust bourbon flavor really helps and it goes down easily. The drink is similar: for all its small faults, it's that perfect balanced flavor that develops over time in your mouth that makes this drink a treat."
"D- I could see this one getting a little tough to drink the whole 750ml. but I will have no problem drinking my 12ish ounce pour. the bourbon tastes a little too boozy not bourbony initially so I could see that becoming a little annoying. not a problem for me as my allotment was gone quite quickly."
"Pours translucent dark brown. Doesn't even look like a stout. More a porter or a strong ale. Plenty of carbonation. Smell is sweet bourbon, coconut, and toffee. Reminds me of some of the Firestone barrel-aged brews in the smell department. Tastes of bourbon, coconut, and toffee as well, but not a very complex brew. And doesn't really taste like a stout either. More of a catch-all ""strong ale."" Very thin body for a ""stout."""
"Highly recommend."
"Notes: Tremendous bourbon stout. If one happens to like the style this is a great pleasure to be had. It might be too boozy for some, not so much in the % but in the way it feels, personally I quite enjoy its kick. The way it has been aged/blended with the bourbon barrel is exemplar, great oak presence. Maybe it lacks a few nuances to take to another level, but actually there is little to criticize for such an enjoyable brew."
"D - Perhaps it was because it was the last stout in the lineup, but I had a hard time finishing my glass. It's still kind of hot, even two years down the road. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt."
"Mouthfeel is silky creamy fantastic! I loved this more than I thought I would and was my favorite out of five killer stouts sampled at the CE release."
"In the land of barrel aged Imperial stouts, this falls short. Even at $15 a bottle I wouldn't buy this again."
"Pretty darn drinkable for a 10.5% abv beer."
"Poured a dark brown with red tints and had a small head that dissipated quickly to the barest collar. The aroma was boozy with some coffee too. The taste was sweet vanilla, a little coffee and a little alcohol. The feed was medium bodied, little carbonation and very smoothly & creamy going down. Drinkability was reasonably good."
"Overall: A silky smooth, velvety creamy mouth feel. The body of the beer is thick and full. The finish is medium to medium full. I am really surprised how well this beer is. I am glad that I got to try it."
"Drank August 7,2009 Vintage 2008. Pours dark brown with medium tan head. Okay, must admit this is my very first barrel-aged imperial stout. Alcohol hits the tongue along with smoke, vanilla, caramel, coffee. Just a wee bit out of the ""beer"" category for my tastes. To me the alcohol is not hidden, it smacked me right off the bat. Do not think this style will ever be high on my list."
"A really good beer, but it couldn't elevate itself to the elite. It's still worth trying and even worth seeking out."
"Pours the perfect black with a light tan head, leaves a nice layer on the beer with perfect carbonation and light lacing. Smells of a perfect blend of bourbon and coffee roasted malts, amazing imperial stout smell. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and roasted malts, just like kentucky breakfast stout. Mouthfeel is medium to thick and the carbonation is perfect for this style. Drinkabilith is great here because of how delicious this tastes, makes me wanna get into bourbon. KBS + carbonation = amazing."
"Shared by glid02 at the Brick Store Pub among the usual suspects. Thanks for the chance to try this. I'm pretty much a sucker for bourbon barrel aged stouts, I just love the interplay of flavors, and I think the roasty, chocolate, vinous and coffee flavors of a good RIS can stand up to and blend well with the Bourbon flavors. This is a nice one. Pours a brownish black with a thin vrown head that sticks around as a thin cap/ring. The smell carries amazing aromas of vanilla, Bourbon, oak, sweet brown sugar, and some creamy and roasty notes in the background. Just heavenly. Tastes on the sweeter side - which I'm okay with- with more brown sugar and vanilla up front a nutty, slightly roasty finish and huge Bourbon notes throughout. Silky and drying toward the finish in the mouth. This is rich, but very satisfying and smooth and I found myself draining my glass quicker than I had intended."
"This is not as bad to drink as I thought, being its 10.5% and aged in bourbon barrels. But there is no way one could have more then one in a sitting. I would maybe pick one up to cellar and see how it turns out, but as far as this being a must try beer, I would consider passing on this."
"D: Very disappointing. Heresy and Old Rasputin XII had convinced me that barrel/bourbon aged imperial stouts were pretty much foolproof. This beer did a nice job of disabusing me of that notion."
"A really nice bourbon barrel aged stout right here. Not as intense as BCS, this one reminds me more of Old Rasputin XI with the vanilla, though I think (thankfully) this is slightly more toned down. Definitely recommend this one if you are into these types of beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, mildly carbonated, and slick on the finish."
"This is a fine beer. I'm surprised this hasn't been viral on BA..."
"750ml 2007. A dark brown pour, not quite black. Tiny bit of tan head, but bubbles are present throughout. Quite a bit of caramel, vanilla, oak in the aroma. Accents of roasted malt and chocolate. Gets a little boozy as it warms. Tastes definetely displays the barrel aging. Quite a bit of caramel and vanilla. Some wood, toasted malt, light chocolate. Pretty sticky, but with some carbonation. Near full bodied. Finishes pretty sweet. Warming is definetely there. Drinkability is as good as could be expected for a 10% abv. The only thing holding this back is that the stout characteristics are pretty mild. Could use some more hop and roast characteristics. You should try this though if you get a chance, especially if you like barrel aged beers."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer by any means. The abv% is definitely up there - definitely - but it's actually sort of well-hidden for the level. I'd say back the barrel aging off of this one just a little and you'd have a really solid beer. As it stands, it's still great though, and definitely recommended."
"Normally I like my BA brews more subtle than this (I'm looking at you BCS) but this one works perfectly. Awesome brew. I'd be happy to have this one any day, night, morning, whatever."
"Pours a very deep brown color with a small tan head. Nice nose, smoked malt, very toasty and charred, rich with chocolate, subtle coffee and raison notes. The moderate alcohol heat plays nicely with the barrel, although this is a sipper for sure. Medium/full bodied and a surprising amount of carbonation. Great beer."
"Overall this is just a tad better than the barleywine from the same series, but both are very well done beers. Worth a shot."
"Built a fence last weekend with my dad and split this with him. 2007 vintage brew. Poured into a snifter. Poured a black viscous color with a chocolate head. Smell is dark fruit and and dark chocolate. Taste is outstanding... dark fruits - mainly cherries, chocolate, slightly medicinal and ends slightly bitter. Very complex. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Fantastic brew. Glad I popped it when I did."
"D - Might do this one till it hurts."
"2007 Vintage received in the Black Booty Bif from jtrockchalk, Thanks for the opportunity. Pours a solid dark brown with deep dark ruby highlights when held to light and a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and roasted malts. Yum. Taste is chocolate and alcohol, followed by some brown sugar, roast and a lingering roast and alcohol finish. Thick creamy mouthfeel and body, low carbonation. Even after a year this one is a touch hot with alcohol. Great sipper."
"A: Looks like a glossy cup of espresso, deep black with a sign of ruby along the edge of the glass, minor layer of head of thick foam - 4.25, S: Unquestionable bourbon on the nose, sweet grain, chocolate - 4.25, T: The bourbon on the nose comes through on the palate, heavy on the alcohol, strong flavors of rum-soaked raisins, a little cherry and the flavor of dates - 4.50, M: A touch grainy, medium-bodied - 4.00, D: This is a excellent bourbon stout, quite complex and loads going on, I don't want to take away from this beer, but when set side-by-side to Goose Islands Bourbon Stout it just doesn't stand up, at the same time I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it - 4.25"
"I know where I can get the '08..."
"this beer pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head that fades to lace that doesn't want to go away. the aroma hits you with a lot of roasted character and the bourbon isn't too suttle. the taste is good for an imperial stout, plenty of malt character, and the bourbon, this beer is a little excessive with the bourbon flavor, or maybe it's just just the alcohol in the finish that really brings the bourbon flavor home. the full body and high co2 make it an easy drinking stout... dispite the alcohol... 2007 and it's not mellowed yet?"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful black, chocolate, and roasted malt aroma with a kick ass bourban barrel aroma. The taste is good. It has a typical Imperial stout profile; warm, dark, and very malty. The barrels provide a nice level of complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a smooth, slow, drinker with lots of character."
"I'm surprised there isn't more hype behind this one, it is an excellent, excellent beer. BrewCzar, you win."
"08 vintage courtesy of bulletrain76. Gorgeous ruby black color with a huge cascading tan head. Excellent retention. Aroma is obviously bourbon-soaked with wood and coconut accents. Flavor is, again, lots of bourbon underpinned with cocoa and a little bit of roast. A little thin but very drinkable and full of flavor."
"D- average for an imperial stout, but maybe slightly higher since it is not as thick as most RISs."
"2008 vintage, bought in January from the Bottleworks and kept in my fridge."
"Recommended. Schlafly is not often my favorite brewery, but this was a nice effort. Give it a try."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable and even dangerous considering we are talking 10 percent here, this is a sipper though, one to savor each sip and try to appreciate the complexity, this beers an amazing treat one to have occasionally to really enjoy and celebrate a big event or good day, really good surprise and i think one deserving of more attention and trys"
"A very good stout which I would recommend"
"(This is for the 2006 Batch) The beer was a dark opaque brown on the pour and yielded a short, thick, tan colored head. When held to light, it shone a lovely looking deep reddish brown. The smell is primarily of bourbon with sweet caramel aroma interspersed. The caramel sweetness comes forth in the taste as well, but is wonderfully blended with the savory flavors roasted malt and the lightly sharp bitterness of oak that lingers on the back of the tongue after swallowing--a bit sweeter than anticipated, probably due to age, but by no means cloying. The mouth feel is nice, but not as thick as I would like for a beer over 10% ABV. Slight carbonation persists throughout, making for a smooth tingly swallow, despite. As far as drinkability is concerned, this beer is nice--I could down a 750ml bottle in one sitting with pleasure--but for the price I'd probably stick to buying it once a year with each annual release. It's more of a treat than a sessionable beer, in my opinion."
"I have another bottle of this in the ""cellar", this one will definitely age well. Recommend cellaring."
"2-12-10 Revisited in an impromptu stout tasting and have to drop the mouthfeel a little on it comparing it side by side to a dark lord."
"D - i love barrel aged imperial stouts. I'd definitely drink this again, but at $10, I think i won't be drinking it as often."
"Overall, it's a really drinkable Imperial Stout with a good girth to it (but not over-done) and lots of balance - fruitiness, malt, oak, Bourbon, hops - it's all there."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, nice touch of bourbon/oak, toffee/chocolate, vanilla. The taste is very nice, malty, very nice touch of bourbon/oak, nice vanilla sweetness, lots of toffee/chocolate. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is a nice one, thanks Tim."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, a little filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this one is definitely a decent sipper but I've certainly had better big stouts than this one."
"The ABV is not well hidden at all - but it works within the taste profile very well. A very nice sipper."
"Not a bad beer, but it could be so much more with age."
"D - This is definitely a sipper, not a session beer in anyway. I split the bottle with a friend, and dont think I could have had much more of this. The alcohol taste and the ABV are a very strong presence."
"A pretty smooth Russian Imperial Stout. Very creamy. The hops and alcohol don't show up much but you know they're there. Well rounded and complex. Recommended."
"Really nice beer, the years have done it proper service. I wish I could get some more and do a vertical tasting."
"Deep dark brown to black. Very opaque. But no head at all at all. Suckage. Smells faintly chocolaty and smoky. Not much gong on. Ah. But it tastes pretty good. Sweet chocolate milk. Some coffee. Smoke thrown in like, hmm. Like coals from the fireplace. Interesting, complex, subtle. Largely well balanced. No carbonation. Suckage. So... To make this the beer for me you need a bit of bitterness in that balance, carbonation and head. Carbonation to help balance out the sweetness. But I'im sure it would if it were there. Sadly, this bottle is nearly flat. Bleh."
"D - I can't finish this one... This is way too boozy for me. Each drink gets a more and more of a cough syrup taste... think cherry flavored robitusson."
"D--Sip this beer. Its a bit rough tasting but is a textbook representation of the style. Not as good as the pale ale of the same company but this shows they know how to do beers other than bitters."
"Great beer. RemInds me of the gi bcs for about the same price."
"Mouthfeel is coating and heavy. Moderate carbonation cuts through the weight of the beer. Nice balance. Very drinkable for a 10.5% beer."
"There is a faint alcohol burn and the booze is a little strong, but putting down a bottle of this was not a problem."
"D: I rated this rather low becasue of the sweetnessand total lack of carbonation. It was so sweet I could not take more than a glass. The Barley Wine Special Reserve is much more drinkable and that's what I had expected out of this stout. I can only take this in small amounts."
"2006 (aged 5 years) - bourbon has subdued, the molasses has increased quite a bit in the nose and on the tongue and has pretty much be come the dominant flavor. A bit of oakey coffee comes through on the finish. This has really mellowed a ton and become a really smooth drinking RIS - the spicy bourbon is pretty much gone. I would say this could go longer. Great stuff!"
"D - This is a really good impy stout. I had it fresh a year or so ago and would like to try another after more aging."
"D_This is a fun imperial stout, what an ABV! I'm trying to drink this fast because it tastes so good, but the heavy body is prohibitive. Also the ABV really shows through in its effects"
"This drinks well and is quite comforting. I think the vanilla and bourbon oak (and a slight butter/diacetyl(?) note) is a little overdone and detracts somewhat from the true stout character of deep, dark roasted malt...a vertical of this would be interesting to see."
"Jim Beam casks used here. Nice - very good, even - but not quite what it could be."
"M + D: Body is on the richer side of medium... or even fuller, but there's a bit of a slickness that kinda keeps the feel from being all too heavy, which is a nice touch, even though it means the beer gets to play catch-up soon after. Nice sipping brew, very nice tasting... well worth checking out."
"Pours a near black color with an average light tan head, that settled into a ring around the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt with light oak, vanilla, and bourbon. The aromas mix well with each other, none standing out more than the other. The barrel aged characteristics come out more in the taste. Big bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors dominate the roasted malt. Sweet overall but the barrel flavors meld into the malt after a few sips. The feel is chewy with semi-soft carbonation, that has a bit of a crispness to it. A very nice stout, sweet with nice bourbon flavors."
"Flavor-wise, this RIS is insanely complex, with rich layers of caramel malt that give way to oak, charred bourbon, raisin, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is a bit dry from the barrel-aging, but crisp and surprisingly bubbly. The body is medium-thin, and could stand to be a bit thicker to live up to the style. I would have liked there to be a touch more chocolate n this one, too, but its still a fantastic beer. In my book Schlafly is 2-for-2 with big, bourbon-aged beers, as their Barleywine Reserve was equally as impressive."
"750 ml bottle, 2007 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Not much head retention or lacing. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, caramel, vanilla and oak. Very nice sweet and malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a burnt/smoky taste noticable. There's also a slight bitter coffee taste in the finish. All the flavors work well together, there's no one flavor that overpowers the others. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's silky and smooth with decent carbonation, but it seems a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is pretty good, for a beer this strong it's very easy to drink. It should be a sipping beer, but it's so good I'm sipping this a little too quickly! The alcohol is hidden well. Overall I think this is a pretty good brew, I'd definitely pick up this again."
"One of the better imperial stouts I've had. I'd likely go back and pick up some more and see how well it does age."
"Bottom line: An excellent BBIS where the bourbon does take center stage. If that's something that sounds appealing to you, you won't be disappointed. I know I'm not. This one makes me want to seek out the 2008 edition..."
"D- Overall very high. High ABV is masked very well with the bourbon and other flavors. I enjoyed this brew very much."
"Pours a nice black color with a light beige head and the smell is strongly of smooth bourbon and lightly of chocolate. Taste is balanced with lots of chocolate and bourbon. Medium to full body with a medium to light amount of carbonation. Flavorful, semi rich and smooth with no big flaws at all. Very solid and enjoyable!"
"D: Overall, this is a pretty good beer. It's a sweet, bourbon aged imperial stout that packs a punch. If anything, I'd say the base for this brew could use a little more malt to balance everything out."
"I am a sucker for big beers, also for bourbon barrel aged stuff, and lastly imperial stouts, that said without being biased, this beer was awesome and delivered on all levels, I plan on buying some online soon and putting some down for a few years and see how they evolve, cannot wait to drink again, definitely recommended"
"Head is a biscuit like medium tan that stands at three fingers leaving some scattered lace as it fades. To look at the body is like looking into cats eyes, pure shining blackness. Nose is a nice mix of soft bourbon notes with more prevalant spicy chocolate notes, tobacco in the raw, and zesty alchol. Enters the mouth like a silk blanket, it really is that smooth. It brings along with it nice bourbon soaked coco notes. Really rich carmalized malt tones lay thick on the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Toffee and molasses are on the back of the palate. Bourbon tones become more upfront as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and very carmel like sweet. This is a super drinkable stout. Yum!"
"I found this to be very drinkable, a very good example of this style. I would not hesitate to have this again, very nice example of the style."
"The body could definitely be fuller, but really can't complain too much. The carbonation is just right, slightly warming. In all, I was a bit set back when told the price, but stuck with it, quite pleased with the result. This is a fine, fine beer, one I'll certainly have to have again."
"The drinkability is quite high. The flavor is good, and the flavors have mellowed into a nice manageable little beer. I've heard these are going south so if you're holding anymore of them drink them up!"
"Pours a deep brown with some ruby highlights and a big off white/light tan head that leaves good lace. Nose is all bourbon and some dark fruit. Taste starts out with roasted malt and dark fruit but quickly becomes all bourbon. Some notes of bitter chocolate, and slight coffee. Very boozy but not as hot as it should be for the boozy taste. Wierd. But don't get me wrong, this one is still hot. Improves greatly as it warms, so let this one get up to the right temp. Mouthfeel is suprisingly viscous for the appearance. Drinkability is good, but is really hampered by the booziness. I'll get through this bottle, but another would be pushing it drinkability wise. Overall a good beer, but suuupppeeerrr boozy. I defenitely will be letting the other bottle of this sit down for a couple years at least. This is a bourbon stout lovers stout. A nice beer."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"Got this one from johnnnniee in a recent trade. Thanks!"
"D - Very good."
"Overall, very drinkable. I haven't had too many barrel-aged imperial stouts, but this is right up there in terms of quality. I would definitely pick up one of these again."
"It pours out basically black, with a ruby tinge to it when held up to a bright light. The head forms nicely and then fades a bit. The aroma is dominated by bourbon and alcohol. Notes of dark chocolate, too. The flavor packs a punch, with the bourbon and alcohol again, ripened dark fruit, and rich chocolate. Quite syrupy. The bourbon flavors linger a bit longer than I wanted. The mouthfeel is great - smooth and creamy. All the alcohol and the aftertaste prevent me from wanting to imbibe lots of it, but overall it's a good brew."
"Bottle. Dark brown color, with a small extremely light brown/white head. Aroma disappoints, not revealing anything worth mentioning. Flavorwise, this is pretty nice. A good dose of tobacco and burnt toffee, with hints of caramel and butterscotch, bourbon and oak. This is a fine tasting beer, but doesn't come close to the best Bourbon Imperial Stouts. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing as well. Overall, this is just an ok beer, not something worth collecting."
"D: The overpowering bourbon in the taste takes away from the drinkability a bit. That said, this is a very good barrel-aged stout and I would recommend it."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the clear, barely translucent brown brew. Head recedes sedately, with leggy, slow-falling lace. Aroma is rich dark malts, with vanilla notes. Taste begins with the dark sweetness, goes a bit fruity and boozy in the middle, and then almost evaporates in the back of the mouth leaving the barrel character to linger. Mouthfeel is velvety and soft over the tongue, and drinkability is good for the style. Enjoying this one."
"Good drinkability for a stout this big, a good beer all around."
"This is a good offering from Schlafly. One I would not hesitate to pick up again. I have another in the cellar to mellow for a year. I can't wait to give it another go. Good job on the barrel aging."
"A few months on this 2007 bomber now. Impressive packaging and box. Pours a deep brown body, almost opaque. Small beige head falls into some attractive patchy lace. Nice aroma features vanilla, bourbon, and some roasty notes of char and chocolate. A bit thin in the mouth for an impy stout. Medium carbonation levels. Taste is much like the aroma. Vanilla dominates. Subtle milk chocolate notes lend a prevailing sweetness, mingling well with the bourbon essence. Mild notes of bitter dark roast throughout. In the now vast pantheon of bourbon barrel imperial stouts there is nothing about this that stands out. A minor disappointment here from a brewery that has wowed me for the most part over the past two years."
"D: Easy to drink, but way too easy to go overboard with its' 10.5% ABV. It would be best to split it with someone."
"A good sipper, courtesy of Tomthompson98. This is a story about bourbon, imperial stout is a term thrown about loosly. Creamy bourbon stout. Greatlace. Muted sourness. Grows on you. A bit of smoke and moderate roast. A winter fire warmer. Boozy. Ageing would mellow the bourbon but there's not that much underneath it to be patient for."
"A wonderful imperial stout. This is rich and delicious. I would love to try this after it has been cellared for a couple of years, but as is this is a great beer from the start. Something to seek out if ever in the Midwest."
"A solid brew which I would have liked a bigger body for the style. That aside I'm glad I had the chance to try this beer!"
"This impressively packaged special release is the best beer that I've ever had from Schlafly by a country mile. If I had known how good it is, I would have cracked the crown long ago. Any brewer who has designs on aging a stout in whiskey barrels should drink a bottle of Reserve Imperial Stout and take copious notes. Thanks jpm30."
"Pours an opaque brown/black, red edges, thick light tan head forms, settles to thin layer, leaves behind some solid lacing. Smell is nice, sweet, sherry, bourbon, caramel, chocolate roast, vanilla and oak, some sweet fruits, and coffee, bit of alcohol as well. Taste is dates, cherries, chocolate, some roast, sweet brown sugar middle, raisins, oak and vanilla, alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, super smooth, very drinkable for such a big beer. Thanks a lot Russ!"
"Great example of a bourbon barrel aged Impy stout. The pour is a deep reddish black. It smells of sweet bourbon but is not overwhelming. The taste is consistent with the smell, sweet when it hits the tongue and the alcohol warms as it descends. The flavor becomes more prominant as the temperature warms. It feels a little thin to be an imperial stout but drinks incredibly easy. I'll definitely get another one of these and age it a bit. A must try if you like impy stouts!"
"d: Not an elite imperial stout, but still very good. Get the feeling it will really improve with a little more aging."
"D: The abv is high but hidden behind the stout and bourbon flavors, if that is possible. The beer's drinkability would be greatly assisted by a fuller, lasting flavor."
"Excellent stout, very complex flavors and nice overall example of imperial stout"
"drinkability is excellent. great balance. nice level of bourbon that doesn't overpower. good depth to the solid base stout."
"Mouthfeel is slightly chewy and sticky, lightened by the gentle carbonation. Quite nice, and frighteningly drinkable for a beer of this strength. I have put away several glasses before I realized it was becoming difficult to type accurately!"
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick and nice, the drinkability is alright, but prob not something I will reach for again any time soon as the Jim was a little overpowering for me."
"Drinks great considering the abv, went great with my liebekuchen (german x-mas cookies) . Very nice, maybe a few more months would've yielded perfection?"
"Poured a dark brown with hints of ruby in a Chimay Chalice. Aroma is of dark chocolate, vanilla, and freshly cut wood and oh yeah booze. Lots of alcohol in the nose. Taste is of Bakers chocolate, you know the bitter kind, Coffee and bourbon barrels. The bourbon is a bit overwhelming in the beer, but not necessarily to its detriment. Mouthfeel is great. Plain and Simple, full bodied with a great mouth coating. Drinkability, well I finished the bottle in about 1 hour so..."
"Drinkability would be good if it weren't for all the alcohol we have here."
"An aged Schlafly reserve should be in YOUR wallet!"
"This is a very impressive Imperial Stout and well worth spending a long quite evening with."
"from Vancer for my bombing"
"Dark fruit flavors burst right away with hints of molasses, chocolate, and caramel. Sticky and thick mouthfeel--coats the mouth quite well. Dark fruit notes of prunes and figs mostly. More sweet than it is roasty due to the abundance of fruit notes. Spicy and a tad hot with thick booze. Pretty damn high abv is noticeable, but only slightly. A nice sipping brew and drinkable, but there are better Russian imperial stouts out there."
"The much anticipated imperial stout from Schlafly. A severely burnt brown bordering black in color, a well defined 1/2 inch tan head that settles down and forms into bubbly and sticky lacing around the rim. A very boozy nose, sets up nicely--some espresso beans, fresh plums, fig and traces of vanilla are nice to locate. Piney hops, almond and creamy bourbon offerings, extremely oily and slick. The body is clearly full in nature, with a bourbon-esk feeling, sweet chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans are in the flavorings. The palate turns sweet in a hurry with more alcholish notes and caramel malts. Warming further reveals oak and dark malts. Dare I say that this is a great change of pace impy stout? It's sweet and boozy and not overly powerful. Incredible stuff."
"Poured big black as night, nice small caramel colored head faded quickly but did leave befind a nice lace. Smell was very sweet of caramel and sugar, with roasted coffee. Great hints of vanilla and dark chocolate, with the alcohol content definatly visible. Taste was very nice. Not too thick, with nice carbonation. Very smooth considering the high ABV of 10.50% which was very well hidden. Flavor was very robust and full of coffee and chocolate flavors. A slight hint ok the oak flavors as it started to warm up. This was a very good Imperial Stout. Not too thick and extremely drinkable, with no real big alcohol flavor, it definatly does sneak up on you. Overall very nice only afterthought was it could be a bit creamier, but really a fine brew."
"A relatively new beer to the Central Ky market. I stumbled across this brew a few weeks ago, but just getting around to enjoying. Turns out that I could have waited quite a while; the beer still has some comming-together to do. The pour is an opaque black or very dark brown color with low-lying carbonation and average head retention for a bourbon barrel Stout. Aromas of dark, roasted grain, heavy malts, and a dominant booze-ey swirl around; promising bold flavors and heavy alcoholic strength. The flavors are expectedly rich, bold, and rooted with espresso and coffee. These flavors are backed up with cherries, berries, lacose, toast, and a fruitcake mix. A mild tartness, oak, caramel, and vanilla persists from the boubon barrels and maybe a rouge bacteria / yeast. Agian the taste is dominated by rum-like alcohols. The feel is a heavy, moderately harsh, fusal feel with richness, slickness (I presume from oat additions), and easily mouth coating. Not overly sweet, nor hoppy (for balance only). A moderate roasted-grain astingency persists, despite the heated, abrasive alcohols. The beer proves the abv stated on the bottle, and then some. With some age, this beer will prove to be a winner."

"D: This beer would make an AMAZING salmon marinade above and beyond being a tasty beer. Enjoyed quite a bit."
"Ahh there we go. Thin for a RIS but very pleasing and drinkable with no signs of alcohol. You basically get what's in the nose x4. Roasty milk chocolate flavors, sweet vanilla, hints of mollasses, black currant, hints of tobacco, with toffee and caramel. The thin body actually helps drinkability. A stout for nearly any time of year."
"A nice screened 750ml bottle ... pours a dark, semi-opaque black into the wide mouth snifter. Fairly thin, medium-tan head with sporadic lacing in the inner rim. Retention wasn't too good here. The nose is a smattering of baker's chocolate, sweet vanilla, and alcohol. Nice, actually. The palate is, again, dominated by chocolate early on, but moving toward a sweeter vanilla-laced bourbon flavor in the mouth. Very sweet and velvety. The bourbon influence is greater the warmer the beer gets, and should really be served at cellar temperature only. Mouthfeel improves as the beer acclimates to the ambient temperature in the room, resulting in a nice medium mouthfeel stout with a very smooth, sweet finish. Finished sweeter than dry. In my mind, Schlafly's has come a long way in a short time, improving their beers exponentially over the last couple of years. This is a great example of a beer I, frankly, wouldn't have thought Schlafly's could have created ... very high quality, well-balanced, tasty Imperial Stout. I'm becoming a bigger fan of The St. Louis Brewing Co. all the time. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium bodied. The alcohol is hot and makes its prescence known. This is not a negative to my mind. I would have preferred a slightly heavier body. The beer disappeared from my glass is sips and gulps. This beer treat is easy to drink. The beer is very temperature specific. I started with the beer lightly chilled. The remainder of my bottle I left outside in the cold night air. The second pour was way too cold. When it is too cold the beer taste like a boozey mess."
"The appearance has a pretty good head with a good lacing. The smell is very light with a slight molasses and coffee flavor. The taste was pretty nice, but there was a giant alcohol flavor that turned me off, a kind of bitter sweet combonation. The mouthfeel was kind of alright. However, overall I might try this again, but outlook is bleek."
"Good mouthfeel, sweetness holds it up a little, it's definitely one to sip. Not as outrageously heavy as many other RIS. This is a good one to share, I wouldn't want to try to finish a 750mL on my own..."
"Overall: Thanks to karst for the great beer. I am splitting this bottle with a good friend on New Years Eve. Good beer and good company make for a great day."
"Deep, light absorbing black color, and topped by a thick, fizzy tan colored head. The head showed good retention, and left a sheet of lace on the glass as it receded. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate, followed by vanilla, almond, and a light bourbon character late in the nose. The flavor has more chocolate than I expected, a light touch of espresso, and more vanilla and almond. The bourbon notes are not easily found in the flavor. My only beef with this beer is the mouth feel. If this had a bit more body, it would be a truly great beer, but it is a little thin. Still, nicely drinkable. Overall, a well done beer. I was not impressed with this beer, when I first had it on tap, but it's growing on me. I'm not sure if the beer itself is changing, or if my palette is adjusting. I just know I like it."
"I definitely want to get more of this and put some away for next year"
"Many many thanks to JPM30 and my 06 SS Vancer for several bottles of this great brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours opaque black with a foamy whipped light brown head. Nice aromas. Oak, bourbon, smoke, soil, vanilla, marshmallow fluff. Wonderful bitter chocolate flavor. Finishes with a strong dose of bourbon. Really silky smooth on the palate. This beer is really easy to drink. What a nice surprise from StL."
"Definitely worth the 9 bucks for the bomber. I will repeat my purchase. I love this beer."
"A big hit with the local homebrew club members - excellent when served with dark Belgian Chocolate."
"Drinkability: Great. Waaaay too easy to knock back a growler of this stuff!"
"Dangerously, this could be a great ""session"" beer. While the body is full, it was a very smooth drink. Slight chocolate and hints of coffee. It is a far smaller stout than other imperials, ie Rogue, and I think that may be a major part of its appeal."
"Drinkability: Another anticipated Schlafly brew. Well balanced, with the alcohol controlled nicely. Try this one if you can."
"This is a very dark, black stout. Opaque body topped by an outstanding beige head and loaded with lacing. The aroma is strong and hints of alcohol and a bit of the hops content. The feel is very full with a smooth character expected from an imperial. The drinkability is limited by the fullness and the ABV that must be in the 9% range."
"Jet black color with a small head, strong roasted coffee fruity bread aroma. Thick and full bodied, rich chocolate, plum and coffee flavors, this is a great example of an Imperial Stout should be."
