I suspect this would benefit from some aging but as it comes it's absolutely stunning. The first beer I've had from Nøgne Ø and it certainly won't be the last - this should be on the shopping list of any stout enthusiast.","interzen","Mar 27, 2015"

Not in a super hoppy DIPA way that kicks you in the face with a huge amount of some flavor, but in that it's supremely hard to pin this one down. It's crazy because it's so many contradictory things at once. Not only in that such a huge beer can be subtle, but also that beneath that subtlety lies a complexity that is like a gift every time it hits your tongue. Well balanced and extremely flavorful, strong and yet dangerously drinkable, this is a beer that I will want to come back to again and again.","BucBasil","Jul 15, 2014"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, toast, raisin, fig, licorice, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with big balance, strength, and complexity of dark roasted notes and light fruitiness. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, fig, light molasses, toast, licorice, oats, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, light molasses, toast, licorice, oats, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark roasted flavors and fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout. Great complexity and balance of very dark roasted malt flavors; and extremely smooth and easy to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering!","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

I also get slight spice, like sage. Taste consists of burnt toast, licorice, bakers chocolate, some caramel, and slight oak in the malt. The beer bitters out well with grassy hops, perhaps the source of sage I sniffed earlier.

The bitter dark chocolate and roasty coffee dominate the taste as well, along with hints of dark fruit, leather, tobacco, molasses, licorice, and some burnt espresso.

Licorice, black coffee, and dried fruit aroma betrays very little alcoholic potency. Roasted malt flavour is up front with dark roast coffee and char notes, which are then joined by molasses, raisin, and black plum. This gives the beer a bittersweet flavour profile. That charred flavour holds on long into the drying finish. It shows very little of it's 9% ABV. The flavour shows great depth. Full-bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

Actually poured smooth and creamy w/ touches of oak and chocolate before a large, chewy chunk of bready, roasted malts hit my toungue for the dryness I was expecting. Finishes dry and crisp, more perhaps due to the large amount of roasted (bordering coffee) malts and ABV than the somewhat muted floral hop bitterness.

The aroma is whisky and molasses with a dark Cavendish tobacco character that really as the beer warms becomes the most prevalent aroma. There is a good bit of fruity hoppiness to the aroma as well. The flavor starts off with a good cherry and malt sweetness which gives way to lots of molasses and Cavendish with light hints of vanilla and wood. If you were to tell me this was barrel aged I would have no problem believing that. The beer although starting off a little malty sweet finishes with a straw like dryness, perplexing.

The taste is very burnt...like burnt malts with an amazingly delicious coffee aftertaste. The initial taste is not as great as I was expecting (lacking that huge, thick imperial stout mouthfeel I love), but the aftertaste is a thing of beauty.

Poured a dark, dark, brown, brown (brown), with a medium head that faded slowly to a foamy skin. The aroma was coffee, chocolate and sweet. The taste was lightly coffee, lightly chocolate and lightly sweet. In other words, Nogne refused to make any kind of statement. The feel was medium bodied (light for an imperial stout, do I sense a pattern here!), with little carbonation. Drinkability was OK. Overall, it reminded me of Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast as a disappointment. Nogne wasn't as pretty, but tasted better. Bottom line...about the same in a very competitive group.

As the head might suggest, the liquid is pure jet black, fully opaque and devoid of any real color anywhere. The scents burst into your nose fast enough that it takes some time to separate them, more plum, cherry, black grape fruit scents than expected, palpable graininess as well, the hoppy bite there for sure, of course oodles of coffee bean, dark chocolate, mocha powder, fresh milk, shaved coconut, it's big enough that you can't differentiate between ""lift"" and ""cling"" in your nostrils. Full-bodied, however, lighter and more flowing based off the nose, the roast/toast factor much higher here which crispens things up. Dark chocolate, mocha, coffee, black licorice, on the dry side as a whole, dusty feel upon the tongue. The alcohol evident, on the boozy side. The grape, plum, blackberry fruit more in the background. The carbonation has a fat feel to it, adding creaminess to the texture.

You can also get hints of anise, nuts, and fruit. But the mouthfeel/drinkability is what I love about this beer.

3.45,-16.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Notes: This is a decent Russian Imperial Stout, but honestly, I was a bit let-down. The burnt malts combine with the hops to impart a bitterness that seems to muddle things up a bit for me, which results in the stout flavors not being able to shine as brightly as they could. In my opinion, it's definitely not worth the $8.39 that I paid for it, which was the fear that forced me to keep putting it off for so long. It's got potential, though. Maybe a year or two in a cellar would do it some good. As is, though, I'm unimpressed.","sweetbrew82","Aug 16, 2009"

No lacing is left on my glass at all as I finish the beer. Smells of roasted malts, roasted coffee, a bit of hop presence and an alcohol kick, which was strange considering the taste. Taste here is a very good example of a non-coffee explosion, non-chocolate filled imperial stout. You get a lot of roasted malts, a bit of hops which adds a nice element to it, some roasted coffee and some sweetness from the malts too, it all adds up to a very good taste. The mouthfeel here was a tiny bit thin for my preference on an imperial stout, other than that the roasted flavors coat the tongue very well leaving you with a nice aftertaste. Drinkability is good, I judge an imperial's drinkability by its taste mostly since they are very heavy beers, this one isn't overly filling and since its taste is very exemplary for a russian I will buy it when I see it and gain $$$.","cbutova","Aug 10, 2009"

Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, except the flavor profile is dominated by coffee and licorice. Mouthfeel is long and very smooth, with the alcohol fairly well disguised. However, the combination of licorice and alcohol is a bit much, and detracts somewhat from this beer's drinkability. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty decent beer.","John_M","Jun 30, 2009"

Taste is like the aroma where roasted grains dominate. There is some coffee, a good amount of dark chocolate and some slight burnt tones. There is a rather soft malt profile that hints at the substantial backbone it provides. The dark fruit esters are much less prevalent in the taste than in the aroma. There is a bitterness that serves as a good counterpoint to all the malt in this brew. Mouthfeel is pretty good with a full body, moderate carbonation and a velvety texture.

As this beer warms, the flavoring becomes more pronounced - smokiness is the most detectable, followed by a dominant roasted coffee presence, touch of chocolate here, and finishes with a bit of a bite. This is a medium to heavier bodied beer, goes down nicely - touch creamy. You can feel the warmth of the alcohol, though it is not detectable in the taste.

Almost smokey, burnt tasting at times, which I'm not too fond of. Aside from that being at the forefront a little too often, this is solid.

The smell isn't overly aggressive, but its rich with a barrel aged character. A combination vanilla-cherry Tootsie roll chocolate with tempered roasted malt note. Not sweet but rich and creamy. The mouth feel is medium-light bodied, primarily creamy and smooth with a tingle of alcohol. Full flavored, the taste matches the nose yet has a licorice aspect also. The barrel aged character lingers nicely. The 9% ABV warms gentle on the way. A real nice drinker; this one is going in the cart again on the next pass. Really glad to find it at Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. Bumping the 'drinkability' to increment the taste up half a notch.","jjayjaye","Jul 14, 2008"
4.11,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"As pretty much every other review mentions, the first thing that will grab you about this Norweigan beer is its color: none more black. The mouthfeel and taste follow suit- its very thick and chewy and it has a rich dark taste, like dark choclate or black coffee. The flavor is very nice for an imperial stout, as some may totally overwhelm with the darkness and there does seem to be a nice balance in the hops to the obviously strong malt character. The thickness does, however, take a bit away from its drinkabaility, by the last few sips you almost cant imagine having much more. ITs basically like drinking a dessert. Not much noticeable to write about for the smell. In the end, it tastes good, and should be enjoyed whilst listening to Norweigan black metal. As desolate as the barren, snowy fields.","BirdFlu","Jul 07, 2008"

4.03,-2.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a beautiful opaque black with tons of medium brown head, dense and sticky. Aromas are quite unique for an RIS, more leaning on the dark toasty notes than roasty. However, there are notes of raisins, olives (strange but I get it), rubber, chocolate, and a bit of burnt esters (my imagination). The rubber could be a mix of medicinal/chemical like notes, perhaps thrown off by yeast or just the malt/hop combination. On the palate, this beer is THICK, mouth coating deliciousness. The use of wheat and oats has made is incredibly smooth and there's no roasted harshness but a noticeable hop bitterness. This reminds me a lot of Oat from ST. A slight vanilla, oaky, smoky oxidative note really brings complexity to this beer making it unique in a sea of RIS's that are all the same. Just a touch low on carbonation, but I prefer it to the overly carbonated American versions.

Medium-bodied mouthfeel. A little subdued for an RIS, but very pleasant. Virtually no carbonation and a little bit of chalkiness at the finish. Drinkability is good. Alcohol is very well-hidden.

Flavors are good, but not as fleshed out as I'd like. Overall, quite light-bodied for what I was expecting. There's a long, lingering roasted flavor in the aftertaste.

The beer has a great smell and is pleasing to my nose. The taste matches the smell, the chocolate is even more powerful. The label on the bottle recommends several deserts with the beer, and I feel these are fantastic suggestions. The aftertaste finds the presence of the roasted barley, and even a healthy dose of hopes. This is a very thick beer, and for many people this will take away from its drink ability.

The taste confirmed the relatively dry nature of the beer, as there was little to no sweetness to counter the astringency and bitterness. The higher than typical carbonation was quite apparent in the taste as a lot of chocolate sparkled across the tongue. Hops presented themselves in a citric and spicy manner.

Slight hints of alcohol, but not much. (There shouldn't be at 7.5 a/v.) Body could use a boost. It hovers around medium, maybe a little better. Good looking, good smelling, good tasting.

The only room for improvement in my mind is upping the ABV and it would be in a big competitor to the other big boys in the style.","beckje01","May 26, 2007"
4.17,1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"16.9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. As others have previously mentioned, the bottle reads it is 9% ABV as opposed to the listed amount. Pours a pitch black color with a tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and chewy. The taste is rather roasty with some dark malts, chocolate and coffee and a bitter finish. Overall, this is a very solid RIS that I certainly would not mind having agian.","cjgator3","May 23, 2007"
4.73,14.5,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Mouth: Huge roast flavors balanced by heat and an almost floral fore flavor. Plums and grapes marry coffee and charcoal with some heat in the exhale and an espresso aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and very easy to drink. Works chilled on a hot day or room temp on a cold one. No alcohol flavor to expose the 9%, just the wee touch of heat that works well with this beer. Terrific!","clickpush","May 23, 2007"
4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a five+ finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Totally black color. Licorice nose. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet licorice and hints of burnt coffee. Nice beefy imperial stout. Slight bitter finish. $8.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me. Label has ABV at 9%.","jdhilt","May 22, 2007"
3.53,-14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this is a decent big impy stout. It's a little too much on the charred side for me.","Beaver13","May 21, 2007"
4.36,5.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Beautiful black color with a very nice powdered cocoa looking head on top. Deep grainy and roasted aroma. Almost licorice like in spots. Deep, rich espresso flavor. Roasted grain and burnt toast. Somewhat metallic and ""ink"" tasting but in a great way. Very impressive. Nice, slcik and chewy mouthfeel-man get me a spoon! Just a killer, killer beer. My second offering from thses guys and who boy they kick ass. Great, great beer.","lackenhauser","May 17, 2007"
3.5,-15.3,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Overall, a nice IS - although not overly complex. A nice finish to an eveining, although the sweetness and slightly syrupy body hinder the drinkability. Certailny woth a try, especially for fans of the style.","MaltyGoodness","May 08, 2007"
3.98,-3.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head isn't going anywhere fast, with lingering dark brown lacing. Aroma is dark malts, maybe a whiff of anise, and some lightly fruity alcohol. Taste reflects the nose, with roasted coffee coming on, and a moderate bitterness that lasts at the end. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, but a tad prickly, maybe a bit overcarbonated for the style, and drinkability is nice. Another enjoyable offering here.","ppoitras","May 03, 2007"
3.9,-5.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Last Nogne we sampled the other night. Poured a deep pitchblack night color with a deep brown head and solid lacing on the glass. The nose threw off some distinct chocolate and roasted notes. The taste was sweet and had bitter chocolate tones as well. The body was very filling but pleasing at the same time.","ggaughan","Apr 27, 2007"
4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Would definitely have this again. Am curious as to what else this brewery has to offer. Back to Beertopia for some new beers...","mbutter1997","Apr 25, 2007"
3.96,-4.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Good, particularly after a long day like this one. I'd anticipated planning out my 300th review, picking something in advance, and all that, but after such a long day this did just as well.","hunteraw","Apr 16, 2007"
4.16,0.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. Body is an inky black topped by a sizeable, creamy, deep tan head. Rich aroma of roasted malt, with a hint of lactose sweetness. Palate is rich, smooth, and slightly sweet. Roasted malt is the dominant flavor, accented by mocha, dark fruit, and a touch of licorice. Finish is mildly bitter, as a few hops come out at the very end. Body is thick, creamy, and slightly oily, making this beer a slow sipper. A pleasure to drink, especially in tandem with a slice of chocolate raspberry cake.","ElGordo","Apr 15, 2007"
3.78,-8.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a very nice smooth carbonation that helps to give this a great drinkability.","RedHaze","Apr 02, 2007"
4.15,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Imperial pint glass and allowed to warm up for 15 minutes. Appears an opaque deep brown color with about an inch of thick dark tan foam. A thick layer of lacing coats the inside of the glass and doesn't budge. Awesome smokey nose. Aromas of dark chocolate, espresso beans, smoked and roasted grains, and black licorice. Taste is rather sweet at first, leading into strong mocha notes with a heavy lean towards dark roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa. This is followed by a light smokiness, a touch of alcohol, and a pleasant bitterness. This is a nice full bodied beer that reminds you that you are drinking something with some substance. Carbonation is in line with the style. A very rich and satisfying Imperial Stout, albeit a little pricey for a 500ml bottle, but certainly worth trying at least once.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 29, 2007"

4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of black chocolate with subtle coffee notes was well balance and very enticing. Taste is a perfect balance between some black chocolate malt with a very subtle hint of sweetness and some subtle coffee. Creamy texture is incredible with a thick body à la Bells Expedition. No alcohol was detectable and carbonation was low. Definitely the best beer I have tasted from this brewer up to now.","Phyl21ca","Mar 28, 2007"

3.75,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I don't believe this is retired, it was readily found and delivered by Papsoe. A 500 ml. with very thick body and head, dark brown. Straightforward quality RIS, some chocolate and coffee, roast, but not too much of anything. Roast and anise aroma. Bittersweet chocolate mostly. A bit acidic in mouth like having unsweetened hot cocoa. Very nice.","Sammy","Mar 10, 2007"
4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Very good drinkability with this one. This is one to be sipped upon and enjoyed for quite awhile. Make sure you end the evening with this one. Your tastebuds will be cashed!","GbVDave","Mar 04, 2007"

4.47,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This review goes out to my friend Daniel, from Norway. I didn't even know there was beer like this in Norway. Anyway, this was on tap last night at Amherst Brewing Company last night. It was poured into what looked like a tall curvy pilsner glass. It was completely black (black as Norway black metal), with not much head at all. Smell was incredibly rich, with loads of cocoa, coffee, and some peppery spice. Taste brought out some dark fruit characteristics reminiscent of plum and blueberry. This was a pretty damn big beer, and the alcohol really did sneak up on me. Either way though, I would love to try this again at some point. It is a shame that it is retired. Hopefully they will still have some of it lying around next time I journey over there. Bam!","jamie2dope","Feb 16, 2007"
4.47,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Nøgne Ø is a very enjoyable imperial stout that I found to very, very drinkable on this hallmark holiday that became a day off. A beer that you should seek out and stash away for a day to remember.","86sportster883","Feb 14, 2007"
4.13,0,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"a really nice RIS, not up there with the big guys (rogue, stone, rasputin) but pretty damn close. this is very drinkable. A nice RIS for RIS fans.. a definite recommend.","Ego","Feb 02, 2007"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,5,4,"Aroma is burnt malts and sweet fruit (very blueberry accented) that is highly concentrated. Deep black with a compact mocha head. Fore is fruit accented chocolate...rather like one of those fruit filled Cadbury Bars. Mild coffee...dark chocolate and ripe dark fruits last through all ranges...very different approach than the American Imperial stouts. I rather like the variation and that nearly blueberry fruitiness is a compliment to the base burnt dark malt and coffee flavors. very nice.","Jredner","Jun 06, 2006"
4.2,1.7,5,5,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle, courtesy of ""Venner av Nøgne Ø"". Like all NØ beers bottle conditioned. Pitch black colour, impenetrable for light. Large and thick brown head. Lovely aroma with vinous qualities, also notes of Colombian coffee, liquorice, chocolate and dark dried fruits. Flavour is dominated by strong notes of bitter coffee, mixed with a substantial malty sweetness, hints of molasses. Also some acidic notes, Im not sure if they are wanted or not. Strong ""coffee"" bitterness in the long aftertaste.","Sigmund","Feb 08, 2006"
