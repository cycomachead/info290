A roasted cocoa presence first greets my nose and then possible burnt or coffee notes as there is a little more than dark chocolate in aroma.  This how beer tastes as it is not your typical RIS in terms of being overly dry, roasted, burnt, charred, but while there is a dry malt presence (and hidden ABV), there is more of a dark, bitter chocolate vibe that adds balance and sweetness.  Pretty enjoyable beer that hit the spot for me.","clayrock81","Feb 15, 2015"

4.24,2.9,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"the barrel aged version of this is apparently something splendid and worthy of the top beers in the world designation. the base beer is really nice too, although not what i expected. sometimes i see top beers biased to region, like the people here cant get the stuff the bruery does, so this becomes the best stout out there, or the toppling goliath people, or the central waters region, they all think their own beers are the best, so they get jacked up on here. fine with me. this one to me comes across a lot more like a black ipa than it does a stout, really interesting dryness and hop intensity not normally found in the style. its got a salted cocoa sort of flavor to it on the malt, and only a little bit of front end bitterness. the hops are heavy in the finish, pine family and aggressive. it wipes out some of the richness and nuance built in the grain profile, but i like that its so different. im not sure how the barrel would effect this, sweet whiskey and the hops, they must fade out a fair bit in that edition, or else its entirely unique to itself. fuller medium body but not at all sludgy and heavy, which i like. impressive overall, but its hard to picture the acclaimed barrel aged edition from the base beer in this instance.","StonedTrippin","Nov 04, 2014"

The IBUs are absurdly high, 85, why would you do that in a stout? This is brittle, miserable and painful to drink. It's a struggle not to drain pour.","MonkeyBread","Sep 04, 2014"

Sticking the noise into a snifter revealed notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, booze, and sweet tobacco. Taste went well along with the smell. Chocolate and a touch of vanilla and coffee. Mouthfeel was just a bit lacking for a stout, but good carb balance. Overall a pretty good beer which I would try again.","toppoop","Jun 03, 2014"

3.87,-6.1,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a viscous looking black with a thin tan head that provides some lacing and minimal residual oil. The nose is roasted toffee, bitter cocoa, slightly resinous hops, and a hint of ethanol. There is almost a cloying toffee sweetness in the taste, which is followed by abrasive bitterness (fades with time), lingering roast and background chocolate. It's medium-heavy bodied with average carbonation, big roasty sweetness, minimal overt chocolate, heavy bitter hops, and burning ethanol that dissipates over time. This beer is tasty and I can easily see how it could withstand/improve in the barrel, but reminds me too much of a more pricey choco yeti.","ThePorterSorter","May 24, 2014"

Abyssmal black color, with two fingers of rocky mocha head that settled to a ringlet, leaving some soapy lacing on the glass. Dark roasty malts in the nose, distant raw cocoa, some herbal hop bitterness. Taste was surprisingly bitter, roasted dark malts and espresso, toasted grains, char, raw cocoa was present but quite muted, herbal and citrusy hops. This was really a let-down. Basically a plain stout, and pretty homebrewy, which is mostly the impression I've gotten from all of Foothills' beers thus far. Really neither sexual nor chocolate. Body was medium, mouthfeel thin, bitter and somewhat harsh, well, far from smooth anyway. The higher ABV was on the subdued side at least. I was glad to have gotten to try this, but it was a major disappointment.","Rifugium","Mar 02, 2014"

3.59,-12.9,4.25,4.5,3,3,3.75,"I was fortunate to find this beer at a local shop. It was however rather expensive, but due to the scarcity of this one I figured I would bite the bullet and shell out the cash. I chilled it to around 45 degrees and then pried off the cap. I poured it into a Imperial pint glass and let it breath for 10 minutes or so before I tasted. The glass was held up to a light and no transparency. It was very dark nearly obsidian in color. It smelled really nice and rich lots of chocolate, molasses and some coffee but not too much. I do not care for coffee stouts but since this one was more of a chocolate stout I figured I would give it a try. The first taste had a strong molasses taste not too cloying but more molasses than chocolate or coffee to me. As it warmed slightly the chocolate and coffee came in as well as the licorice. However, it still had an overpowering molasses taste. Which for the price and hype of this beer was its downfall. I would have expected more of a cocoa backbone. In regard to mouthfeel it was slightly watery but nothing that was overtly. I felt it was pretty well balanced from a texture point of view. Nevertheless, I would not give this beer as high of remarks as others in its category. Also, for the price it is overrated. As most stouts in this category I imagine this one could be aged. I just wonder if it would improve with age?","humuloner22","Feb 08, 2013"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and some char aromas. Taste is much the same with a fairly high level of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 18, 2012"

I will preface this by saying, I got the last fill out of the station. Actually only got about 3/4 fill on my growler. It had quite a bit of a metalic taste to it and strong booze quality. With all the hype, I was wanting a smooth mix of booze, chocolate and malts but it just wasn't there. Feel was nice and creamy, like a good RIS should be. Adequate carbonation.

From the strong cocoa smell, to the dark color with the thick tan head, to the smooth finish. The taste was a good balance of malt, cocoa, and slight hops.

I had the pleasure of experiencing the 2010 Sexual Chocolate Barrel Aged over Cocoa Nibs last Saturday @ the 1st Annual Raleigh Rare & Vintage Beer Tasting. Now that 	was 1 hell of a great beer. The 2012 draft version was not that impressive. Don't get me wrong, it's a great NC 	beer by a great NC brewer. But as far as a great beer in the grand scheme of Russian Imperial Stouts, it's excellent; but not great. While it is a brilliant marketing ploy to release 4000 bottles directly at the brewery 	only (which would piss me off if I was a store carrying all Foothill's other brews). Lesson learned, don't buy into all the hype/local cultist following; judge for thine self. There are just to many superior Russian Imperials (Old 	Rasputin, Brooklyn Dark Chocolate, Stone, Samual Smith's, Founders, and Siberian Night .. to name a few) that are readily available seasonally to even consider standing in line for 6+ hours (although I'm sure the beer share in line is way cool) on pre-release morning. Don't get me wrong, I am not bitter, nor mad; I like Foothills and 	love thier brew pub. It's just dissappointing to experience my 1st Sexual Chocolate year, with all of it's hype and 	national news coverage and then to experience it and have your sails deflated. If this brew came out of Wyoming, they would be lucky to sale 4000 bottles in a season, but here in NC that amount dissappears in less than a dozen hours. Kinda sad really. I'll try it again on tap if it's available, but for me; actively seeking it out is not on my things to do list.","RedneckBeerz","Feb 09, 2012"

4.22,2.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D/O - Drinkability is pretty high. I'll start with a disclaimer: Overall and generally, I felt this was a damn tasty beer throughout and really enjoyed drinking it. The issue I take with it, however, is that I don't think I got an overwhelming chocolate presence that would justify it being named after it. I'm not bashing the beer or it's name at all; for all I know, Foothills could've just picked the name based on it being catchy and exciting and because this beer actually does exhibit a semblance of chocolate. That being said, I can't say I didn't come into this beer expecting dominant chocolate ala Chokolat. I love coffee and coffee stouts, though, so I didn't mind the hostile takeover performed by the espresso in the taste. I hope I get the chance to try the barrel-aged version of this, because it seems like the bourbon would really transform the nuances of this beer.","nhindian","Sep 14, 2011"

Chocolate only comes out after 6oz or so. Otherwise, I have to fight to find it. I'm not going to kill the score because I find it to be unique and it does get a lot better as the glass empties. Less smoke is my request. However, I can see how some people could really enjoy this. I think this is a smoked beer drinker's paradise. Unfortunately, it isn't my preference. I think the BA version will probably benefit from the smokiness though.","claaark13","Beers"

The average look and feel were a drawback perhaps, but the nose was enticing and the flavors wonderfully put together. This stout told a story, which sets it apart from many of the other imperial chocolate stouts out there. Unique in its conception and impressive in its execution, this one is well worth the hunt. In fact, its unique qualities led me to enjoy it more than the barrel aged version, which, while being a great barrel aged imperial stout in its own right, had dominated much of what made the base Sexual Chocolate special. Regardless, both are worth checking out if you can. Thanks again for sharing Doops, and thanks for sending these over John.","Jeffo","0"

It pours a very dark black-brown (almost obsidian, but not quite) topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, light coffee, light oak, and light molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis on the chocolate, the coffee, and some added maple syrup. Everything's almost too sweet, clashing with the roast in a strange, though not altogether offensive way. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that edges to the brink of watery. Overall, a pretty decent impy stout, but it's much too thin and the flavors just don't work together very well. It's good, but nowhere near worth the hype.","TMoney2591","Aug 28, 2011"

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," The taste has a lot of roast but mild chocolate, the nose carries more cocoa with a subtle spice note perhaps a bitter cocoa nib taste. The yeast adds a gentle twang of dark chocolate and slight coffee-like acidic note with slight berry undercurrent and mild toasted graininess. The dark malt is slightly astringent with a hint of hop bitterness coming in at the end of the taste. This was a great stout, I enjoyed it and was looking forward to having it in bottled form. I enjoyed a small sample on draft at Extreme beer fest, but that was years ago - this was pretty high in drinkability with some nice complexity and fits the style well.

It's not bad, but odd and unexpected. Very earthy tasting, hoppy, some anise, licorice, and more dark bitter chocolate than the nose let on. Very interesting, very dry.

Great mouthfeel, tastes rather like licking bittersweet chocolate which has been dipped in strong coffee. Not really complex, but tasty. I don't think it is amazing, but a very good beer which buried the 10% alcohol expertly. The gentleman next to me offered that ""that's a good beer"" and followed with ""all beer is good - it's wet and it has alcohol"". I discovered he had downed three of the Sexual Chocolate from his forelorn looking wife when he went to the bathroom. Prost!","yessri","Feb 10, 2011"

4.15,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"2011 Vintage! Served from firkin into a shaker. Poured pitch black with a minimal khaki colored head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and vanilla. THe flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, and slight sweet malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew as always. This could probably use some carbonation, which made it better from the tap in my opinion. Had the tap version right after a glass from the firkin and enjoyed it quite a bit more due to the additional carbonation. Good well balanced flavor and aroma going on here. An absolute must try for sure.","thagr81us","Beers"

The most surprising thing was the body, which was thinner than expected, though very smooth. My gut reaction was that this beer would benefit greatly from a little more flavor and texture balance.

Some dark fruit character is noticeable as well, with some plum character. Mildly bitter on the finish with a great dark chocolate bitterness, this beer tastes great. The mouthfeel is borderline exceptional. Medium to full in body with a soft, lush carbonation, this feels exceptional smooth on the palate, a lushness which works beautifully with the delicate chocolate character and the bitterness.

There were complex layers of roast, chocolate, caramel, and molasses. The toffee caramel flavors were more pronounced in the 1 year aged bottle. That's why I preferred the aged bottle more.

The body is thick like most, but there's enough bitterness to keep this from getting too sweet. The hops also add a pleasant, mild citrus taste, which aid drinkability, though this is a tough beer to do anything with but slowly sip... but I suppose that's ok.","tempest","Feb 14, 2010"

This showed up in smell and taste, and the sweetness lowered drinkability some.

Taste closely follows aroma with the dark fruit and heavy chocolate being the most prominent on the palate. Minimal carbonation with a thin, creamy mouthfeel and goes down exceptionally smooth. For a 10% abv brew, this is one highly drinkable RIS....and it gets so much better as it warms up.

It pours jet black with a nice 3 fingers of dark tan head and leave a nice foamy lacing on my Founders 10 Anniversary glass. The smell is a bit off putting because it has a rather large burnt grains smell with lingering hits of chocolate, carmel, booze and earth. The flavor is much better as the burnt grain smell is replaced by the taste of bitter sweet chocolate, sweet grains, toffee, carmel, coffee and earthy flavors....overall the taste of chocolate and roasted grains is most prominent and quit delicious. This beer is thick in my mouth like a bitter chocolate milk shake. I really enjoyed this beer, much more than I thought I would. The chocolate is there, but over powering and all the flavors really meld together nicely.

4.02,-2.4,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"RBSG09 Grand Tasting notes (thanks to whoever brought it). As much as this was a good beer, it still disappointed me. I hadn't read reviews or heard much about it beyond general hype for a good American impy stout. This is a pure chocolate bomb, in my humble opinion. While it does a great job with creating a good chocolate flavor, I didn't find the complexity that I need to nudge my scores above a four. Well, the aroma is very good, still chocolate but so intense it broke through. This beer tastes like rich, high quality semi-sweet to milk chocolate, and there's not a ton else to say. It's the best chocolate flavor you can find in a stout, but as someone who likes good dark chocolate, a chocolatey stout will never live up to the real stuff, which is a good thing because I wouldn't want to drink anything with the bitterness and intensity of good dark chocolate. I should go back and downgrade all of the other chocolate beers that I've reviewed because this is better, however it's still a one note stout in a field of deep, dark, gigantically complex entries. On a fresh palate, alone in my room with a growler, I'd probably give this beer a higher score, but the RBSG09 Grand Tasting gave me quite a bit of perspective on reviewing and showed me that I need to leave more room in my scores. I had a Cigar City 110K+ about fifteen minutes before this beer, and while that wasn't the best stout ever in all the world, it was still significantly more interesting to me.","popery","0"

This does not have a ""strong"" aroma, though. I really have to try to get some smells. Taste is of bitter coffee, bitter dark chocolate, espresso, some raisin and a bit of a hop bite at the end. This is quite a bit more bitter than I was looking for. Could be the espresso. Not the creamiest IS I have had either. Overall, a good Coffee/Chocolate stout.","DrDogbeer","Beers"

The head is thick and brown and it rises up and stays around. There isn't much lacing, but that's about the only thing that's missing. The smell seemed immediately to be full of carbonation, it smelled kind of dry which surprised me. There is a decent bit of roasted and sweet notes, but the smell doesn't keep you all too interested. The taste is definitely full of roasted barley, which is very nice (better than a bunch of black patent). The chocolate nibs fills this one out, you get the taste of chocolate, but not a lot of sweetness, and it fills the whole thing up. It has a bit of lingering sweetness mixed in with some roasted coffee bitterness. Very pleasant, but just a bit more chocolatey sweetness, like chocolate malt or dark crystal, would really put this out into outer space, but at this point its a bit dry. The taste is really just like a bar of bitter black chocolate. Like I mentioned, this is very full, really wonderful, like thick, viscous syrup. I love the feeling, until the dryness hits. I mean, for a style like an RIS, dryness just isn't nice. I really couldn't pull myself away from this. There's room for improvement, but I really enjoyed working through this growler, and would do it again in a heartbeat. $20 for 4 pints, I think that's better than everyone who waited in line paid.","taylorhamrick","Feb 21, 2009"

It sure looks incredible, and smell doesn't let down either, the intense chocolate, burnt coffee, and strong malts combine to make quite the enticing aroma. This 2008 vintage blows you away in the taste department. It seems the alcohol has muted enough to allow all the other flavor components, the chocolate, the coffee, the malts, to overtake the flavor. It is a dense beer, but far thinner than the 2009 release, I assume due to aging. The subdued carbonization is also nice.

The taste is what I would describe basically as a pretty good but not too unique imperial stout. Compared to what I think of as the ultimate chocolate beer (Choklat) it falls way short. Compared to a standard IRS (for example the Port Santa's Little Helper I had just before it) it exceeds it by a small fraction. It holds a little more sweetness than most IRS's, and the chocolate comes across in the bitter variety. Don't get me wrong, it tastes good.

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep black color with a moderate amount of tan head. Slightly burnt, somewhat port wine and plum aroma. Heavy, though mellow roasted flavor. Lingering bittersweet chocolate taste. Very grainy tasting. Solid mouthfeel-the heavy grain flavor comes thru as a nice chewy, bready feel to it. Very, very good and enjoyable beer. I am a tad dissappointed overall but I think I just hyped myself up for it. Thanks to brentk56 for this great trade. I wouldnt have been able to sample it otherwise I am sure.","lackenhauser","Mar 17, 2008"

4.77,15.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours an opaque brown color with a huge foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. The smell from beneath the cap is Hersey Syrup chocolaty goodness, from the pour a wonderful distinct dark fruit character comes through and hints of vanilla. As it warms you get more of a cherry vanilla barrel aged treatment. The initial mouthful is conditioned by the rush of alcohol. The fire is dampened nicely by the full bodied rich chocolate flavor dispensed in a silky creaminess. Big chocolate flavor mixed with the fruity taste of a barrel age treatment. Finishes with a chewy semisweet maltiness that lingers appropriately. Way too easy to drink. This one is labeled 9.75% ABV. Integrated well, has a really nice complexity that's a kick to consider. I never know where the line falls between a RIS and a Double Stout, but this is what i think a Double Stout is shooting for. Really nice effort. Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Mar 01, 2008"
4.63,12.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This beer is about as dark as a beer could be. Black with a nice thick tan head. The smell is coffee, a little oatmeal and a ton of chocolate. The taste is chocolate. No hop bitterness, just mainly a ton of chocolate and a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just a hint of smoke. Served at room temp. The abv is not too noticable and the beer has a long lasting aftertaste. I will certanly try this beer again sometime.","Enola","Feb 28, 2008"
4.77,15.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours black like an overdue oil change. Brown head falls quickly to a ring around my glass. Strong roasty smell of chocolate and coffee. Some pine and licorice aromas were also detected. The first initial sip, I tasted flavors of dark chocolate followed by black coffee. Finishes with a bit of crisp citrusy hops. Some bitter chocolate lingers. Alcohol is barley noticeable, just some slight warming in my chest. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and slightly heavy. Overall, drinkability is fantastic. I would agree this Imperial Stout lives up to the hype. Highly recommended!","DavidEddie","Feb 28, 2008"
3.98,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"This puppy is black, with the darkest ruby-hued head I've ever seen. Aroma is a high quality dark chocolate, maybe some espresso or coffee grounds. Taste is the same great dark chocolate, slightly sweet, turning astringent on the finish. Really no harsh alcohol to this one, just a nice warming feeling. There's something in the aftertaste I'm having trouble putting my finger on - astringent, metallic, I'm not sure. It's got a surprising little hoppy kick to it, keeping it crisper than most RIS's. Quite a bit of fine carbonation, too, keeping it light on the tongue. Glad I split this bottle with a friend - Very enjoyable, but I don't think I could really do justice to a full bottle.","malthead","Feb 26, 2008"

4.47,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle 186 of 500. Pours black with a pumpkin pie, dark tan and orange head that recedes to a ring. Aroma is sweet and sugary, some cherry and apple fruitiness wrapped in chocolate. Nice roastiness and a bourbony twang, just a hint of leather as well in the aroma. Taste is a somewhat smoky, ashy roastiness blending with the sugary chocolate and sweet fruitiness before a decent amount of piney hoppiness. Finishes with a small bite of alcohol at the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, slightly sticky sugary feel is balanced by the hoppiness, roastiness and alcohol, somewhat drying finish. A very drinkable beer, glad there is another on the way that can age for a little and see what develops. Thanks to Xak and to Pete.","hoppymeal","0"

Alcohol is hidden well. A flourish on the palate releases some sweeter flavors. I can only imagine how killer this would be on tap. Worth the wait and the price.","ByTor2112","Feb 10, 2008"
4.88,18.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"It's a great stout. For being so strong it still drinks very well, and it also has many flavors buried within. The chocolate is very pronounced though well blended. I seldom can drink two pints of this type of beer, though I managed to do it with this one and I could definitely feel it. It's a very tasty beer with great drinkability, especially for the abv.","HighestGravity","Feb 09, 2008"

4.85,17.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"The beer arrives in a standard pint glass branded with a Foothills logo as black as the beer itself. The head is the color of cappuccino foam hinting at some of the aromas and flavors awaiting the drinker. The head eventually dissipates to wisps of foam, leaving traces of lace down the side of the glass. In addition to coffee notes in the smell, there is the distinct aromas of dark chocolate coming together to remind you of a cafe mocha. Roasted barley is also evident, rounding out the nose of this beer. Upon taking a sip, all of these aromas come to full life on your tongue. Coffee hints with huge amounts of dark chocolate provide a perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness usually provided only by the finest chocolate makers. At 10% ABV, the lack of alcohol presence on the palate is surprising and evident of proper maturation by the brewer. Swirling the beer around the tongue gives the drinker the chance to fully appreciate the full body of this beer that combines with subtle, even carbonation for an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Sip after sip, this beer is a pleasure to drink. As it warms, flavors of dark fruit present themselves and the aromas become more alive. With the high ABV, you would think that this beer would beg to be drank slowly, but the perfect balance of flavors and incredible smoothness urge you to continue drinking. Chocolate in beer can sometimes be overwhelming and when combined with sweetness, even cloying at times, but Sexual Chocolate is constructed with such care that it just continues to please over and over again. To quote a buddy with me at the time, ""There is not a single aspect of this beer that I do not like."" If that does not motivate you to get a pint of your own, I do not know what will.","MSchae1017","Feb 06, 2008"

The mouthfeel was exceptionally thick, velvety smooth, perfectly carbonated for the style, and left a sticky, bittersweet aftertaste that, like the title, can only be called ""sexual chocolate"". I would gladly have this beer again, if only it weren't brewed in such limited batches.

4.67,13.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Tylers in Durham as part of its 08 debut. Pours jet black, no lite penetrating at all as its held to the light. A quarter inch dark tan head escapes not long after my first sip. A ring of steady lace remains. The aroma at first is more subdued. At first just hints of semisweet chocolate and roasted malts. As this beer warms the aroma's really get much more complex, Caramel and charred fruit. Faint hints of anaise as well. The taste starts with a soft bakers chocolate sweetness and caramel undertones. The hops sneak in and assert themselves on your tongue. A warming begins down your throat after a few sips. The mouthfeel is moderate and extremely creamy and smooth. By the time you start to realize the strength of this beer you look down and your Foothills tumbler is almos empty. This beer is much too easy to drink for it's strength. A complex brew that's hard to keep away from your nose and your gullet. Highly Recommended.","drunkmonk","Oct 21, 2007"

There was a good blend of dark malts present as well, with some coffee flavor, but once again, chocolate dominates. The mouthfeel was heavy as expected at 10% abv, but the alcohol was also well hidden by the chocolate bitterness. There was a pleasantly low carbonation as well. This was a great sipping beer.
