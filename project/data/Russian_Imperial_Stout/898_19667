3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 2/10/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light licorice, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light licorice, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, molasses, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial stout style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 24, 2015"

The smell is strongest with hints of chocolate, coffee, raisins; the taste is very sweet, slightly grainy, typical carbonation for a stout with this high a ABV. Very sweet finish. Overall, a good imperial stout for the price.","oldirtycaffrey","Jan 20, 2014"

3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.75,"Heavy Seas never lets me down... unless I get an old batch of Hop3. This beer was exactly what I wanted at the time, a Malt bomb. I taste zero hops, and while that is normally a scary thing for me, it was actually quite nice. To call this an Impy Stout, is wrong IMO. Its more of a doppelbock. Reminded me of the malt character in Celebrator. Very caramely, very smooth, nice and chewy/thick. Hidden alcohol character could make you have a few too many before you realize it! Very little head, but thats how its sposed to be with impy stouts, which like I said, I dont think thats what they should call this. Its almost a brown in color, I expect a stout to be opaque and black. I could *almost* see through this one. All in all delicious caramel candy beer. If you want a malt bomb, get this one.","Jay_Ulreich","Jan 12, 2014"

However happily surprised that it did have a notable pleasant bntaural carbonation. Beer took off with rich aromas of nicely roasted malts; some dried fruit and smokiness, but just accents ...not dominant in any sense. Moved over into the taste very nicely. Here the dark malts let loose with hints of coffee, darker slightly bitter chocolate and the dried fruit aroma became a restrained sugariness more like molasses. The mouthfeel was "spot on"...decadent, rich and medium/medium full body. Great sipper. I thought this was one of the better casked ales I have had. Would get in line for this one. Also, regular Peg Leg is good, but this is absolutely the only way to really enjoy this beer. Cask really elevated the beer to top flight.","BillRoth","Nov 22, 2013"

No real alcohol presence, except for a very light warmth. This beer is listed as a Russian Imperial Stout, but it seems like anything but that to me. If anything, it reminds me more of a regular American Stout. It just doesn't have the robust flavors, aromas, or mouth feel you should expect from this style. It falls kind of flat and doesn't really give you anything that would make you come back for more. Thanks again to Jeff for sharing.","tectactoe","Apr 25, 2013"

There may be some who prefer it with age, but it really doesn't hold up. It doesn't do poorly (like thin out, sour, or oxidize repulsively), it just begins to de-evolve.

When I think of RIS's I think of a thick, roasty, and robust brew and this beer just didn't live up to that. It wasn't robust enough for an RIS and the watery mouthfeel didn't match up either, I find this beer to be closer to a normal stout then a RIS. The price of this beer was pretty good, but unfortunately everything else about this beer wasn't.

The smell of black coffee and dark chocolate with some toasted breads. Maybe a bit weak without the required dimension of a good imperial stout, more reminiscent of a classic dry or american stout. The taste follows the nose, with the chocolate and coffee really dominating beyond that there is a touch of dark fruit but not too much else. I find the hops to be a delicate addition rather than a major player. The note on the bottle says they are targeting the more British end of this style but it may fall short of that mark as well, using Sam Smith Imperial Stout as the benchmark. Mouthfeel may be on the thin side the finish is slightly sweet but too clean and overall the body is a bit on the light side. The alcohol is well masked for a beer of it's strength which does add to the drinkability. So I'm not entirely impressed overall, this is a very tough style as it is done so often and so well by a number of breweries that anything short of good doesn't seem to be worth one's time.","fank2788","Apr 17, 2011"

It did not matter how I held this one up to the light, nothing was getting through. Nose was rich and roasty, like coffee and dark chocolate combined. The neck label mentioned "... notes of coffee and dark chocolate" also. I agree. Mouthfeel was smooth, not quite creamy, but very reminiscent of an N2 pour. The chocolatiness was prevalent on the tongue and in the mouth, but it was not as bitter as the nose led me to expect. Instead, it had a mild smokiness to it in combination with the chocolate.

Pours black with red/ruby highlights around the edges. Has a one finger light tan head that goes away almost as soon as the pour is done. The smell was roasted malts, chocolate, almost a hint of some alcohol. These smells were pretty dominate, nothing else seemed to be there to me except maybe a very small hint of coffee. The taste was very sweet, mainly some roasted malts and chocolate. Like in the smell a small hint of alcohol. Didn't seem very complex but I think that's good. I don't know if it was so sweet because it sat so long or if it's like that fresh as well. Mouthfeel was slightly above average. Upon the pour it looked to be thin but it was actually a little thick which surprised me but it was nice. At 8% ABV there was only a slight hint of alcohol and in no way did it take away anything from the beer, very well hidden. Overall a pretty good beer. It might not contend with the big RIS' but it's definitely something I'd pick up again.","dismal","Nov 19, 2010"

The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, subtle coffee bean, and cream. The flavor was of malt, coffee, caramel, with a subtle hop followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. Only downside was that it had a very light feel on the palate compared to what I would have expected.

The flavor is perfectly balanced, malty sweet yet not sickeningly so due to the appropriate balance of hops. The alcohol is only noticeable in a burning effect after a swig, but is not present in the taste at all. The mouthfeel is not quite as full as I had expected but the carbonation is right on at minimal.

The body on this is full yet it feels a bit thin all the same. Flavor is fairly long lasting, that malt sweetness being the dominant flavor in the aftertaste balanced by some bitterness from roasted grains and black malt. Coffee is there in the aftertaste as well to lend some balance. This is one I'd consider drinking again, yet I think I'll prolly be going for the Yeti in the future when it comes to these two. Feel is overall lacking, and I think it has something to do with the overtly sweet charcter of this beer, there's not enough roasted grain bitterness, the style should have more. At first I could find it, but after drinking Yeti, I can't even place it, that's how low in character that roasted grain and black malt bitterness is. Again I feel that there is some creamy milkiness in here, and yes it works well with the sweetness.

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle with two identical labels, conditioned, with June '08 notched; sampled a month before that. Brewed with English pale, crystal and chocolate malts, roasted barley, and hopped with Fuggles and Styrian Goldings. The beer is just about black, with an inch of fairly frothy head that eventually reduces to nothing, and leaves little lacing. Dark and sweet chocolate in the nose, with roasted and coffee notes, some earthiness, a touch of ethanol, and some slowly-emerging green hops. The flavor is almost identical, but with the addition of a medium bitterness. The body is dry and at times powdery, with lively carbonation and a medium finish. A very easy-to-drink imperial stout. Not a huge, over-the-top version, but solid.","mmmbeer","Feb 16, 2009"

The mouthfeel is fairly thick with some fine carbonation. This is a pretty heavy sitting beer, but I wouldn't expect anything else from a Russian Imperial.

Too much fruit and not enough roasty, chocolatey goodness to think of this as a RIS.

Medium-bodied, fizzy so that things don't quite congeal. Thin flavor array, the coffee, cocoa powder notes dry, grape, raisin, fig, plum fruit flavors.

Its got the upfront chocolaty and coffee notes for sure but there is a bit of hop presence as well. The sweet maltiness of this beer is very tasty and there is a sense of the high alcohol content, but nothing too crazy. As it warms a bit I really get a lot of the rich flavors hidden in this dark and mysterious brew. This beer is absolutely delicious, I think I can leave it at that.","indiapaleale","May 22, 2008"
3.38,-7.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Got this one as an impulse buy as I hit the counter at the Wine Specialist. Pours a near pitch black with the slimmest of highlights along the edges of the glass. Tan head that dissolves down to very limited film fairly quickly. Nose is mild roasted malt, some coffee, and a hint of sweet caramel or chocolate. Nice, but too subtle for RIS, in my book. Flavor is fairly bland as well. Overwhelmingly roasted malt and coffee aromas, with maybe some light dried fruit and a bit of hops in the end. Not bad, but again, not bold or complex enough for my liking. Body is solid, although not quite as thick and full as some. Overall, not a bad brew, but definitely one of the least consequential RIS's I've had.","soupyman10","May 20, 2008"

Smells a little dull for an impy but a little hint of chocolate an subtle coffe come up the olfactory. The taste doesn't differ too greatly from the smell. It's a little bitter but not too bad. Chocolate malt comes up first then rolls back and makes way for a little dark chocolate. Pretty smooth feel, goes down easy.

Thin mouthfeel and leaves behind average lacing. At 8 percent ABV is packs some punch. Overall another fine product from the Baltimore brewery.","grees20","Apr 30, 2008"

Root beer like appearance in both body color and head. Not much of head with slight lacing, but nice dark body with nice clarity. Not as thick as many other RISs. Aroma slightly roasted with almost a touch of roasted coconut. Mild coffee and bittersweet cocoa. The taste is sweet up front and leads to a bitterness that spreads. Both the roasted malt and hops add a nice sharpness, but nothing too acidic. Finish reverts back to sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit over-carbonated and thin for the style, but this also leads to a dangerous level of drinkability. Way too easy to drink this quick -especially at cellar temp!

It tasted like caramel and oatmeal malts mixed with mild coffee and milk chocolate, creating a surprisingly delicate and subtle flavor for an imperial. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation and had a lasting, bitter aftertaste with some slight alcohol warming.

Aromas are very roasty, lots of chocolate malts, coffee notes, very little hop aroma, relatively high ester production as well given all the dark fruits. Alcohol notes are subtle. On the palate, the chocolate and black malts continue to provide the bulk of the flavor. Incredibly smooth however so I imagine roasted malts have been kept low. Fruity esters provide the only counterpoint with a slight floral hop note in the finish. Body is only medium high, low for an RIS, but given its interpretation as an 8% abv, understandable. Carbonation is also spot on. Not as big as I like my RISs, but a solid beer nonetheless.","dreadnatty08","Mar 02, 2008"

Warm rich tastes of dark cocoa and coffee, the molasses is definitely present. Raisins on the finish really make this interesting. No real strong tastes of the high alcohol, which is enjoyable.

The chocolate is now heated by a bit of hoppy alcohol. Mouthfeel was decent, clean yet a bit chewy, definitely not a BIG Imperial Stout.

It has caramelized malt flavors with a hint of chocolate. It has a roasted taste that comes out in the back along with a slight hops taste but has little bite. It certainly has a heavy taste but the mouth is clean and smooth. Its a heavy beer with little carbonation but it finishes crisp rather than coating the mouth. I thought this was a very tasty beer.

It starts out with a very pronounced and clean roasted taste. I've had some that have a really dirty, fiery, charcoal taste, but this is heavily, and slow roasted grain from what it tastes like.

I was wondering if this could have been my glass even though I usually do see this problem so for the next brew I hand washed a new glass to make sure I had no soap or chemical build up but had the same result. Anyway, the aromas where ok with highlights of coffee, chocolate and I think a little cherry or some other dark fruit. Good smell, just seems to be missing something here, for a imperial stout I would think things would stand out but they dont. The taste is also ok, seems quite pedestrian to me but the highlights are chocolate with a slight coffee feel with a break to a noticeable hop flavor that lingers somewhat. Over all this is a pretty ok brew but for it to be in the category of an imperial stout it just seems to be to blah for my expectations.

No hint of alcohol at all, and at 8%abv thats saying something! This was an easy drinker and a good RIS. Would definatly drink this again!","mikesgroove","Jan 24, 2007"

Heavy aromas of black patent malt, baker's cocoa, and roasted barley. A clean alcohol scent emerges as it warms. Sweet tasting upfront and full of caramel and roasted notes; then comes burnt malt flavors, dark chocolate, and a snap of nuetral alcohol. Dry aftertaste, faint american hop flavor and mild bitterness balance well with the big malt prescence and hint of booze. Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation, perhaps too thin and crisp for an Imperial stout; but this also aids the relatively clean finish. Only slight residual chocolate and coffee flavors remain briefly, which are then quickly lifted by the drying hops, charred malt character, and hint of alcohol. This possesses a great drinkability and has a respectable malt complexity, but it might not satisfy the BA seeking an enormous Russian Imperial Stout.","PBRstreetgang","Nov 18, 2006"

Coffeeish aroma with hints of chocolate and nuts. Something else, as well, which I just can't place though. The taste is delicious. Molasses-sweet (but not too sweet) with almost a smokey hop finish.

It did tie nicely with the other flavors to create a well balanced taste. Mouthfeel was medium body and very smooth, with fairly low carbonation.

Taste is very unique for an imperial stout, yet still quaffable; roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, hops, grain, earthy notes of wood.

Rich chocolate and coffee flavors but it seemed a little thin in taste to me. It had very little aftertaste and didn't make a stong imperial image to me.

3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Coming in a 12oz. bottle with a notched in best by date of Jan 06, the beer poured way too thin and light brown for an Imperial stout. Didnt look bad in the glass sideways, but the short lived, thin, fizzy, brown head, and a lack of viscosity made for a rather puny looking Imperial Stout. The aroma was nicely hoppy and chocolaty, but not very roasty at all. The taste also continued along the same theme, with sweet toffee, pine sap, and chocolate fudge flavors, which made for a very interesting and drinkable beer. As tasty as it was, the lack of a chewy body just kept reminding me how far off style this was. More of an Imperial Porter, it is hard to dislike this sincere attempt at a big, dark, beer. I would keep drinking it, despite the mischaracterization on the label. A big plus is the complete lack of alcohol burn and a well hidden 8 percent strength by volume. Drinks easier than many regular Stouts. As an Imperial Stout, this has barely one leg to stand on.","rajendra82","Oct 03, 2005"

3.23,-11.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"12 oz bottle pours out a mahogany brown, but sits in the glass opaque and ebony. One finger khaki head retains well enough and leaves some minimal sheets of lace. Aroma is subdued, with a small measure of coffee, chocolate, and grassy hops. Mouthfeel begins creamy and full medium bodied, but thins way too much as the glass empties. Carbonation is crisp and moderately high for style. Taste is a bit jumbled. Mild notes of coffee and chocolate, but lacking dark roasty malt character, overall. Mild presence of grassy hops in the finish, but nothing substantial. Alcohol is concealed quite well, but this one just lacks any significant character to earn a decent score for drinkability. The USA produces the best imperial, or double, stouts in the world in my opinion. This one needs some recipe tweaking before it can aspire to any semblance of respectability.","merlin48","Beers"

The taste is of a bit of dark chocolate, and some roasted coffee and some hops at the end, but the flavor is not as strong as I would like.

These flavors, except for that sweetness come out in the drinking, with an agreeable aftertaste. The mouthfeel runs a bit on the thin side, which I am guessing is rather the norm for a dry stout which is something I'm still getting used to. A well made session beer, and one I would consider putting on tap at home.","stingo","Jan 08, 2005"

Not bad for any old brew, but one labelled as an Imperial Stout needs more than this going on.

It does form a nice sized moccha tan head leaving ample lacing around my pint glass. Aroma: Light chocolate, caramel, and chocolate notes along with an herbaceous hop profile, seems a bit repressed with minimal fruit tones shining through. Taste: This brew was more reminscient of a roasty brown ale or your run of the mill porter rather than an Impy Stout. No one taste jumps out at me reminiscient of somebody's first attempt homebrewing their own Imperial Stout where they underestimated the malt bill completely. Chocolate, coffee, tart raisin, touch of vanilla compromises many of the flavors I can pick out once again leaving me with an herbal tea note for a hop profile. Mouthfeel: Thin and light bodied for the style maybe good for beginners in craft brew but hard to consider this brew a true imperial style stout, I mean c'mon a light bodied imperial stout isn't that some sort of contradiction. Unoffensive on many levels nice even carbonation not much else to note.

Flavor is similar with a chocolate malt sweetness being dominate. A bit weak for an Imperial Stout, maybe a porter or regular stout but this is the smallest tasting Imperial Stout I have had. There were some roasty notes on the finish. Mouthfeel was silky with a medium body. Decent drinkability as a beer but not as a RIS. Its maybe a light Imperial Stout but not what it claims.
