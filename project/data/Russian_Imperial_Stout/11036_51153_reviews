"Tastes of smooth milk chocolate, with an outstandingly creamy, mouthfeel, brownies and fudge, along molasses and nougat, blending together very smoothly and convincing. These flavors get successfully balanced by calming, earthy, slightly toasted malts. The chocolate then gets a alcoholic Bourbon note to it, just as in the nose, with hot wood blending extremely well into the rich chocolate qualities of the beer. This reveals molasses, wood and a well wrapped up rich chocolate character. The beers incredible chocolate richness gets joined by a hot, boozy peak in the finish with caramel and a well fitting, lower carbonation, and a hot dryness."

"bottle from 2012. Medium body, lighter than expected. With all the barrel aged beers around right now, this beer still stood out. Not overly boozy with a nice caramel oak flavor. Not much head. Would definitely try again."
""
""
"2012 version.  After wanting to try this for several years I was greatly disappointed.  Very little barrel.  It's decent enough but certainly not worth waiting in line and paying $20 a bottle for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Shocker, it smells like chocolate. Bitter dark chocolate, dark fruits and subtle barrel flavor. Getting mostly oak dryness. Wish there was a bit thicker and had more barrel presence. Oh well. It's still pretty good."
""
""
""
"Great bourbon smell. Smooth bourbon flavor. Plenty of chocolate too. Yummy, first beer of the year!"
"As soon as I open the cap, I smell the bourbon. It is jet black with a dark mocha head that dies down and rims the glass. You smell is standard: bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, some roasted malt. However, each scent stands out which makes this beer unique. The taste is similar to the nose. A little bit of burn from the alcohol, but not too bad. I'm sure with age this balances out nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not huge on stouts but this was good. Got better as it warmed."
""
""
"A really nice effort from Foothills."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, it sure it chocolatey. Loads of cocoa from start to finish. The sweetness and booziness of the bourbon helps to cut it pretty nicely. Otherwise a fairly simple brew (but I really wasn't expecting anything else)."

"Nose is similar to a Russian Imperial Stout - the BB flavors take over once you taste it, heavy dark licorice and slight roasted chocolatey flavor will take over your mouth.  I appreciate chocolatey stouts that keep it smooth and sweet, this does both extremely well!"

"I've been feeling a little burnt out on RIS lately. I can't even look at the Marshall Zhukov in my fridge. That burnt sugary sweetness they all finish with has just fried me out a bit, become just a bit too much, too cloying. That said, this is obviously a great beer. If anything, I wish the bourbon was even a little more forward, to cut into that RIS sweetness. A great beer, but in a style that's fading from favor with me a little."

"lots of Bourbon coming through.  I did enjoy this, but I like the non-barrel aged better"

"Though not as thick as my fav BCBS, this brew has a lot going on and really hits the high notes for a BA stout."

"I like Sexual Chocolate, the regular one, it's a good, solid beer. The barrel aged version raises the bar exponentially. It smooths out the licorice notes and adds tremendous depth. The barrel aging is more a compliment to the base than the main component as it is in so many other heavy handed barrel aged beers these days. If you see this beer anywhere, take it and drink it."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery on the release day.  The beer was served in a snifter, and it pours a jet black coloring, with a tan halo of head.  Nose of chocolate, booze, vanilla, oak, and coffee.  Extremely rich.  Flavors are heavy booze and coffee forward, with a blast of bittersweet chocolate, wood spice, and roasted notes.  Heavy and velvety, with a bittersweet cocoa nib aftertaste.  All chocolate, with hints of bourbon here and there.  Perfectly balanced and huge.  Roasted and rich chocolate linger on a smooth finish.  Great beer!"
"Great Beer!!!"
"Amazing beer!"

"O: This is a great beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste it. Some of the other reviews I've read on here mention slight oxidation. There was no oxidation with this bottle."

"2011 vintage poured into snifter. Pours a dark brown with cocoa colored head. Opaque in appearance. Nose starts with mellow vanilla, some harsh barrel notes, and a bit of oxidization present which brings on some sherry like notes. Dark chocolate and roasted malt is present beneath the barrel. The taste is smooth and starts with dark chocolate. Next comevanilla and charred oak with more oxidization. Dark fruits come out. Tons of flavor here that is very well balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, a nice beer that pack a flavorful punch. The oxidization is a slight drawback, but still a tasty brew."
"O: This beer is unbelievably good. The alcohol is non existent in aroma and flavor. I received this as a 'surprise' beer from my wants list, and have to say it's the best surprise I've ever received."
""
"O: This is a pleasant stout to sip and savor the aromas and flavors imparted by the bourbon, although it is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is mostly well masked from the taste."

"Overall - A vast improvement over the base, which is a good beer by itself."
""
""

"Bourbon barrel aging is apparently exactly what Sexual Chocolate needed. The barrel cuts the bitterness of the roasty base and adds a terrific sweetness. I'm not sure how much of that smoothness comes from the 20+ months of age but I hope this isn't the last time I get to try this."

"O- the bourbon is nearly perfectly integrated with an already solid base beer. I wasn't blown away by the original Sexual Chocolate, but I was really impressed by this version"

"Not sure on the vintage. Stout-like appearance, black and opaque, with a nice cap of dark brown head that retained as a ringlet, leaving a few streaks on the glass, dabbed with light lacing. Roasty dark malts in the aroma, dark chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. In the taste, good blend of bourbon/vanilla/coconut sweetness and chocolaty/malty roastiness, with neither really taking dominance, lesser notes of coffee, cocoa bitterness, and toasted oak, slight hop presence in the finish. Medium-full body, smooth, not too hot, quite drinkable. I didn't really think this was too distinctive in the world of barrel-aged stouts, but what it was, was a good and tasty beer overall. A major improvement over the rather lack-luster regular version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My preference in barrel-aged stouts is for a more subtle Bourbon character so I like to age a beer like this for a while to see how it mellows; based on this experience, my guess is that it might take three or four years to get to the point where I would really enjoy it"

"D) Overall, this one is pretty solid. The barreling seems a bit on the young side, though."
""
""
""
""
""

"Balanced with bourbon being a complementary adjunct. Its what I really enjoy about certain barrel-aged stouts. There are some where the bourbon and barrel pretty much taking over the entire beer, and I do not enjoy some of these beers. This one, however is perfectly balanced while providing a complex palette of flavours. Very enjoyable to drink this one!"
""
"A good dessert brew with lots of chocolate. The bourbon notes are quite subtle as the beer offers mostly sweet milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Roast and nuttiness round out  the brew."

"O: Overall not nearly as ""hot"" as it has been in previous years and much smoother... The bourbon is very complementary rather than dominating. Delicious and definitely worth trying - I would get this year's vintage again."
""

"overall much better than original sexual chocolate. very very drinkable. the flavor doesn't approach a parabola or KBS, but still very good and very impressive."

"Good, and exceptionally drinkable, but I wouldn't seek it out or trade for it again. There are just too many good or better available, local options."
""
""

"O: I love living down the the road from Foothills because it makes getting this beer so easy. There is a reason it has hype behind it and why it has won awards. It is def one you should try and get your hands on to experience."
"Overall I found this to be an above average beer. When compared to other top tier barrel aged beers, though, it does not compete."
"O: Excellent beer that I would drink any day if I could. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid barrel aged aromas and flavors."
""
""
"O - A really good beer and much better than the regular version. Good integration of the base beer and the barrel."
""
""
"O: I'm so glad I live close to the brewery and have a chance to try all of their great beers. The Sexual Chocolate is a great beer, but this is even better. I'm an IPA guy, but beers like this make me second guess my beer choices sometimes."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of bourbon and dry bitter black chocolate is quite interesting. Aroma of medium bourbon notes with some pretty dry and bitter black chocolate notes makes for an interesting drink. Light butterscotch notes could also be detected and I wish more notes of vanilla could be found here. Body is pretty full with a good creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I could see myself having this again."
"Overall - Really happy to have had the chance to try this one. It was a touch on the bitter side but still very flavourful and you can really taste the quality ingredients used. The bourbon is subtle but still present."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer quite a bit i had it at brewvival last year i don't remember it being that good at all. very impressed with this years vintage"
"The taste is solid. Strong vanilla heavy bourbon. Loads of full flavored wood heavy bourbon really dominates. vanilla is the main barrel flavor, and in a good way. Boozy in the middle as well, with a good bit of accentuating barrel flavors. I know this was aged in Pappy 20 barrels, and it shows. The bourbon ALMOST takes over the original beer, but it needed to. The base was SO bitter that it needed to mellow out, and it did beautifully. The base malty bitterness has turned into a beauty of a malt. It would be a 5.0 in terms of taste, but BA Blackout takes that. Its just not as sweet and balanced."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer and I am glad I had the privilege to try it. To me its not as good as Kentucky Breakfast Stout, but definitely worth drinking if you have not had it before and I will seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"In my honest this opinion this was a notch above ba people porter which doesn't say much"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - the bourbon is very well integrated into this beer. The BASC cuts out some of the monotony of the regular version. This is the epitome of a barrel enhancing a base beer."
""
""
""
"D/O: Pleasant in its chocolate quality, but without much bourbon influence beyond the initial burst of flavor to distinguish it as the value-added version of this imperial stout. Not the most well-rounded representative of its style, but hardly a dessert beer."
""
"O: A good BA RIS"
""
"Barrel treatment turns a good beer into a great beer. Wonderful complex flavors. We mixed the normal and BA versions as well and the result was pretty cool. If you are trying side by side try it."
""
""
"I much preferred this one to the regular Sexual Chocolate. The barrel and cocoa nibs definitely added another dimension that the base beer seriously needed, in my opinion. I'd seek this one out again for sure. Good stuff."
""
"A very tasty barrel-aged brew, but it’s absolutely not worth the hype. I’d rank it in the middle tier of BA stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor- The beginning"
""
""
""
"Cost: $15 for a 22 oz beer."
""
""
""
"O~ Great BA treatment to an already solid beer. The BA version is right up there with the big boys of BBA beer."
"22oz bottle, very distinct bourbon aroma. Very roasty, strong bourbon, and a slight hint of roasty chocolate on the backend. Completely different than the regular version, much more vanilla imparted from the bourbon and very little of the subtle chocolate of the regular version. This ain’t too bad at all. The rarity of this makes it hard to get a ton of, but its worth trying and IMO right up there with the rest of the BA Impys."
"O-- Very good BA treatment to a very average beer. Was not a big fan of the regular version but this was quite good. Good to knock off one of my top wants."
""
"O: Very nice aromas and a complex taste. The feel is disappointing but I'd still recommend it if you can find one. Big thanks to advent for sending this one to me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am really glad to have gotten to try this beer. The taste is really incredible. The only area that this fell short was in the body. If it had a thicker body this would have been near perfect."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"A bit of a disappointment after hearing so much about it. This is just an average BA imperial stout. Mouthfeel was too thin and it was over carbonated."
"4, 3, 3, 3, 3"
"O- This is the second time I've had a '11 bottle and while this beer is enjoyable, it isn't one I would actively try to search out as there are plenty of other RIS's I prefer that are easier to obtain."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - MUCH better than the non-BA version. The flavors were all very we'll balanced and made this a great BA RIS to sip on. I hope to get to try this again some day."
"O: I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, yet I wish there was a more going on with it. It is possible that is was swallowed by the other Russian Imperial Stouts at the table, but I will be happy to try my other bottle standalone (or possibly compared to the regular). Another thought is that it might just need to age a bit - which I can happily do! Will definitely return here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a near black with a thin cream head, minimal lacing. Aroma is dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, tangy dark fruit, lots of booze, and roast malt. Generally very mild and bland. Flavor follows the nose, fruity and bourbon with charred and roast malt that isn't well blended with the barrel. Sorely disappointing after the 2010 sample I had, this reminded me more of some of DuClaw experiments at barrel aging stouts than a world class, refined example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one was better than the regular version, but still underwhelming given my expectations. These beers may be living off of the reputation of past batches."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor profile is very similar to the aroma. Medium bodied with an excellent balance of bourbon barrel and dark roasted malts. Lots of sweet bourbon along with so some toasted coconut, vanilla and dry oak. The bourbon flavor is very prominent but it's well integrated into the beer and not just a bourbon bomb. Underneath the bourbon there is a nice roasted malt character with hints of dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal and roasted gourmet coffee bean. Really well balanced and even though there is a lot of bourbon flavor, there is little heat. Very impressive."

"The barrel aged version is better than the standard, just a shade better than the 09. Easy to drink and enjoyable, I just wish the body was a bit fuller."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- very impressed. Don't waste your time on the non-barrel aged version-- only go for this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first beer from Foothills Brewing Company and they can make a really nice beer."
""
""
""
""
" Overall I am glad I have another bottle and will continue to trade for this the next release well worth seaking out and sharing with some friends."
""
"When I sampled Sexual Chocolate a few years ago, I remembered not being very impressed. This barrel-aged version really won me over me however. Do not anticipate this beer to be the biggest, baddest imperial stout on the market, but do expect to be happily surprised."

"D: I enjoyed this way more than the standard offering. Not the best barrel aged beers I've had, but probably one of the better barrel aged treatments considering the level of improvement this version has. Some nice blending as well, I'd say this was bottled ready to drink, I don't see this really going anywhere with age."
"D: Much improved over the regular version, but still not top line. Alcohol has been kept in check, so this is ready to drink now"
"Just a knockout BA stout from Foothills and it's no reason this beer has medaled in the last two GABFs (Gold in '10, Silver in '11)."
"O: Amazing beer. Lots of chocolate and toffee."
"This beer blew me away. I can't believe it took me this long to try it. It's one of those BA stouts than really uses the barrel perfectly - i.e. integrates it well with the underlying beer as oppose to overpowers it. Fantastic brew."
"O - Good, a touch hot at the end."
"Taste is rich, chocolate, oak, vanilla, and the light hint of coconut which is really kinda unique. The mouthfeel is spot on, full and creamy with a really mellow finish. Really a fantastic beer, sadly i had this before the non BA version, so I'll probably be a bit underwhelmed by the regular one now."
"Black with a dense, dark brown head with good retention. The nose has a nice milk chocolate character with coconut, vanilla, and bourbon. Apparently the bourbon was intense, but what really stood out for me was the excellent SC chocolate character. The palate opens with bourbon, plenty of cocoa and chocolate, with plenty of milk chocolate as well. Medium-light in body, this is too dry, with the thinness of the base beer, and the accompanying powdery dryness reminiscent of cocoa powder not really standing up to a fairly intense barrel character. Moderately tannic on the finish, this is solid, but I don't think it's an improvement on the base beer."
"OVERALL: This is definitely a great barrel aged imperial stout. It is not, however, a great barrel aged Sexual Chocolate. If that makes any sense. The great story the base beer told, what with the sweet and roasted beginning and the bitter, chocolate overloaded finish, just gets totally drowned out here by the bold and albeit wonderful flavors of the PvW barrel. They could have put any base stout into the barrels and it would have turned out the same, so they should have bottled more of the base beer and got it into more hands. Nevertheless, if you’re a fan of PvW barrels, you will love this beer. I loved it for sure, but wish it had been more of a barrel aged Sexual Chocolate. This was an awesome beer night though, so thanks heaps for making this happen Doops. Thanks to John again as well."
"You da man, John. Jeff thanks for helping me drink this bad boy!"
"O- One of the top BA stouts out there. So smooth and balanced and full of flavor. I have a few more and can't wait to see.how this ages and do some verticals..."
"O: Its one of those beers that is almost perfect in every way that you can't accurately describe it. If you like Abyss, FW14, Zukhavs, Dark Lord, etc. You will like this."
"The mouthfeel is on the thinner side for the style with higher carbonation. Overall I thought it had some fantastic flavors to it. My only criticism is that the beer seems overshadowed by the bourbon. Luckily the PVW bourbon flavors that dominate are fantastic. Loved it overall, but more for the bourbon flavors than the base beer."
"O: Foothill's Barrel Aged Sexual Chocolate trumps the base in every way. It's literally a delivery device for one of the best Whiskey's in the world, and judged as such, it's fantastic. As previously noted, there are better beers coming out of the same barrels, yet it doesn't keep this one from being delicious in it's own right."
"a very good beer, the bourbon definatly dominates over the chocolate. i wouldnt mind one of these for the cellar, could be quite interesting with some age on it."
"Overall this is very nice and kind of lives up to the hype I would drink this as often as I could."
"Worth the hype. Worth the money. Worth the line and the eight hour drive. A damn fine brew."
"Drink- Amazingly better than regular Sexy Choc. This was big, bold, smooth and creamy. As stated I loved the coconut and the vanilla. So much goodness in the glass."
"O - Not a great beer at all. Maybe the 2011 PVW version is better, but this is an average RIS at best. Didn't care for it, and not interested in acquiring another bottle."
"Glad to have tried it but I’m also glad I didn’t get up at the wee hours of the morning and stand in line for it. Good, if not very good, but not in the top-tier of barrel aged brews."
"Overall: The aroma is really nice, but the flavor doesn't match that quality. By no means is it bad, rather it's a bit muted. Okay to try but not something I'd seek out again."
"Great beer and one that should be chased. Well done guys!!!"
"Shared this one with beeruser and funkydelic at one of our tastings. 2011 Vintage! Bottled 6/26/11! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured pitch black with a two finger light brown head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, wood, vanilla, and sweet alcohol. The flvor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, wood, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, caramel, and vanilla. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew without a doubt. I am really impressed how well this one carried across in the bottle as compared to tap. Probably one of my favorite BA Stouts I have had to-date. While this one is not the most robust RIS out there the flavors make up for this by being perfectly blended and enjoyable to keep you coming back over and over. This bottle did not last long between the group that evening. So good that my guest kept the bottle to remember it by... The mouthfeel was a little thin though, but meh, you can't win them all I suppose. Get this on your palate if you have not already. If you have, you already know what I'm talking about."
"Overall fantastic, will age supurbly"
"4.0 D: Really tasty beer. There's a lot to like with only one nontrivial issue - the astringent char flavor. It's not wholely distractive, but it's strong enough to make a great brew into just a damn good one."
"I’ve been waiting a while to finally try this one and for the most part, it did not disappoint. That thick mix of chocolate from the base Stout and molasses flavor from the barrel really helped make this something special and I was impressed by the overall integration of the flavors considering that this only spent about 4 months in the barrel. This was really good and a hearty thanks again to Adam for sharing it!"
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest level of carbonation. The feel of this brew is quite smooth and super easy drinking leading for a very enjoyable brew straight across the board. There is lots of flavor to take in along with a pleasant roasted quality from the grain that persists throughout. Fantastic stuff here."
"O - Easily the best beer offered from Foothills and it's easy to see why this one won the gold at GABF. An extreme beer meant for extreme enthusiasts. Anyone interested in this style it's a must-try for sure."
"O: Honestly, I've had better. I've recently tasted Parabola, Boris Royale, and Great Lakes BA Blackout Stout, and all were significantly better than this one. By no means is this a bad beer, but it's not particularly memorable, except for the hype that went with it. Eric said it best when he said ""it's good, but even if this were available at the Total Wine down the street, I'm not sure I'd go back to get another"". A disappointment, both in hype and in style. Try it if you can, but nowhere near worth what people are asking for it. I'm not one to judge other people's opinion, but the A rating this carries surprised me. ""Tasting the rare", indeed."
" The quality of bourbon flavor right up front is very good with nice bourbon and malt cohesion. I really like how the bourbon is strong but not so strong to cover or obscure the base stout, it accentuates it well. There is slight cocoa elements with a bitter accent to the light caramel and roasted elements with some sweetness and creamy tinges in the flavor a slight dry woody astringency carries through the mellow cocoa which is slightly bitter and combines with the hop spice in the finish. Overall I was well pleased with the taste as I sipped this over and over it was great to taste side by side with the original since you got the pleasure of tasting how much the barrel aging can add in only a 4 month period of time, it doesn't really need any additional time in the cellar IMO, it is great and I consider this a top notch barrel aged beer."
"O: A great beer that I was happy to spend my time waiting for in line. I find the bourbon a tad bit strong (not hot really just shows itself to be one of the strongest flavors) I am sure this beer will age beautifully."
"Pretty nice pour, dark black with khaki head around the glass. This smells of roasted malts, wood, dark chocolate, slight sweetness and touch of alcohol. smells great. Taste follows the nose well. Regular sexual chocolate with a nice balance of sweet vanilla bourbon that works really well. The mouthfeel is a little thin on this..would like it to be a little thicker, but the flavor is exceptional nonetheless. Overall this is a great beer and I am looking forward to cellaring a couple bottles to see how it mellows out. Definitely give this a try if you get a chance."
"Pours a very dark, black, with little head. The nose is very dark chocolate and some acrid burnt something or other along with the oak. The tannic quality of the oak and some sort of charred malt or baker's chocolate is ruining the flavor for me. Not enough of a sweetness to balance the bitterness. All of the group I was with apparently had this beer before and remember it to have been better. Regardless, there is some chocolate, oak, roasted malt and some mild bourbon/vanilla character. Big rich mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. I might be overstating it above, but this beer lacked that 'chocolate punch' the name would seem to imply, going with more of an acrid, bitter (not hoppy bitter) character from the barrel or overroasted malts or dark chocolate or something. The sweetness mentioned in other reviews was not present for this bottle, but would have been welcome. Didn't work for me, but maybe fresh its better."
"This beer is a terrific, well crafted RIS. Definately one of the better examples of the style. I think some brewers go overboard with this style to the point of the beer being hard to drink. Foothills has not fallen into this trap, just the right amount of big bold flavor, alcohol burn, and bourbon presence while still being amazingly drinkable. Good stuff."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I think it should be appreciated for it's unique qualities and well balanced bourbon stout taste. Cheers to foothills for making another great beer."
"7.2/10"
"D: This is truly delicious. Complex and well balanced. Despite the touch of heat at the end, I don't think it's necessary to let this one sit before opening, although I can't wait to see how well it ages. Wonderful beer, well worth the drive!"
"An excellent barrel-aged sipper that's on the quieter side of the ledger, & the sweeter side. Lovely."
"The awesomeness of this event cannot be captured in any manner possible. While walking around with my bottle of 2011 SC pouring for anyone with an empty glass, I bumped into someone pouring the BA version of this beer and since we were both down to our last few ounces in the bottle, we just swapped beer bottles (I hung onto the bottle at the end of the event… it is autographed by the brewer!!!). appearance is same as SC, and I was surprised that this beer had a head since that is a rare event for a bourbon barrel aged beer based on my experiences. Smell is sweet bourbon on top of the chocolate malty goodness of the base beer, really nice. Sweet dark fig, almost…the bourbon sweetness is really nice. OH WOW. This is by far one of the finest bourbon barrel aged beers that I have ever tried. The mix of bourbon with the sexual chocolate is magic in a glass…smooth as day, overall this is a fantastic beer and a 5 across the board."
"Really a wonderful beer and certainly my favorite Foothills offering. Looking forward to trying this again."
"2010 Bottle served in snifter."
"Black pour with a dense, tan, 1-finger head. Creamy chocolate aroma with lots of vanilla, a nice dark fruit backbone, a little molasses and a note of sweet bourbon. The flavor is dark chocolate with lots of coffee upfront. Notes of cocoa, brown sugar and dark fruits in the middle. Finishing with some smoke, vanilla, almond and a little bourbon kick. Creamy, medium-full body with soft carbonation."
"Medium to thick motuhfeel and low to medium carbonation. Very nice."
"The aromas and flavors are more refined then the normal sexual presence you are used to, i am getting a light berry note, in the vein of raspberry and other light berry flavors that incorperate well into the chocolate and stay secondary, and there is a distint roast in here too. The time in the barrels has improved this thankfully and there is prominent oak throughout."
"O: Overall the barrel aging did this beer well. I enjoyed it and would gladly have it again, although it’s a top tier bourbon barrel stout in my opinion."
"D-well balanced, very rich and creamy texture and flavor with a great presence of barrel. great stuff!"
"O - A solid Barrel-Aged stout, but not overly impressive. I do prefer this to the regular Sexual Chocolate and while there's a bit too much barrel/oak, it helps the overall quality of the beer (compared to the base). Give it a whirl, but don't go crazy giving up your cellar to obtain."
"D. This was surprisingly good. Not a huge fan of the regular Sexual Chocolate, but I do like this."
"Pours a dark black brown with minimal head and lacing with some Bubbles on the edges of the glass. Got a lot of dark fruits, cocoa, vanilla and some bourbon. Tasted of chocolatey nibs, dark fruit, toffee, vanilla and bourbon. Not as bitter as the regular Sex Chocolate. Mouthfeel is not too thick with good carbonation. Definitely enjoyed this better than the reg Sex Choc and would like to try this again with new release."
"O-very good. Better Han the regular but not much burbonon it..."
"Pours a very pretty dark dark brown with a light brown head. Smells very chocolately. A bit of dark chocolate bitterness. The bourbon scent is really light. On the tongue there is a great dark chocolate and bourbon. It is a bit bitter but very tasty. Good mouthfeel. A bit thin but overall quite tasty"
"Drinkability: I assume the abv is the same as the reg sexy chocolate. The alcohol is only warming in the slightest. I could sip this beer all night. So thankful to have tried it. Compliments bison chili very nicely."
"Bottle shared by Josh. Thanks! Pours black with tan head. Aroma was chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and coffee. Medium mouthfeel. Flavors followed the nose and all seemed subdued. They were there but not what I was expecting. I wonder how long the beer aged on the wood. It could have used more time."
"Notes: A damn fine example of a bourbon barrel-aged Imp stout. A lot drier than other examples, but it maintains that rich, thick mouthfeel that I've come to expect. Very very well crafted."
"O: I thought this was a very good brew, and one I would have again. The bourbon is not overpowering and melds very nicely with the base beer. Recommended. Skal."
"Overall, one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had. Incredibly smooth and complex, this beer was definitely peaking in my opinion. Near perfect and could definitely compete with the tops in this category."
"Drink is decent, a bit of booze but not a lot, smooth and creamy, luscious, not too heavy or sticky."
"So, though I preferred how it tasted fresh, I think the forced carbonation does something for the appearance and mouth. Still a fantastic beer, either way."
"drinkability is great. great balance against the barrel. regular sexual chocolate is a beer i've had a few times and always been underwhelmed by, but the barrel-aged version more than makes up for it. great stuff!"
"Pours a deep brown color almost black with a thin brownish white head and a little lacing. Smells of dark cocoa and coffee and roasted malts. Tastes like regular Sexual Chocolate with a little wood added in. Like big coffee and roasted flavors with hints of bitter chocolate and dark fruits with oak or some wood. Mouthfeel is oily and a little odd. Drinkability is okay. No better than regular Sexual Chocolate and not anywhere close to being as good as its hype."
"Overall good but not outstanding, at least to me."
"D - Good beer, but not blowing me away by any means. I definitely wouldn't mind having more of this, but probably won't go out of my way for it either."
"D - Quite drinkable. Tasty, smooth and quite satisfying. Certainly lives up to the hype, with only a slightly dissapointing mouthfeel. Otherwise delicious."
"MF/D: like silk on the tongue, this could be drunk all night. so incredibly smooth."
"Thanks to BucketBoy for the trade. Pours one shade shy of black with a half inch, loose, mocha-colored head that dissipates into a skim. Lacing was present during the tasting, but no legs. Nose suggests artificial sweetener, cocoa and a trace of bourbon. Taste is really fantastic - cocoa, coffee, bourbon and a kiss of hops at the finish. Truly decadent, but a wonderful balance to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a carbonation that falls short of lively. This is a phenomenal beer. In my opinion, it blows the doors off of regular Sexual Chocolate. Great balance and flavor without being cloying. I personally don't see this getting much better with age, so drink up."
"Quite drinkable. The barrels add a nice layer of complexity. I enjoyed this more than the regular version. Maybe not the best BA stout, but it's still quite good. Would love to have another bottle for the cellar."
"big chocolate, some vanilla, and a lot of fusel alcohols - bourbony. the chocolate totally dominates this beer and then the bourbon kicks in. I was actually hoping for more vanilla, kind've a bit more of a swirl mix bringing some heat, but it was not the case. Not bad, just not as insane as I thought it was going to be here. A good barrel aged beer."
"O: Great beer overall, really glad I got to try it."
"D: A very good BA stout. I'm not sure if my scores reflect it but I think I liked regular SC better."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The color is very dark with a nice creamy mocha head with a pretty good retention time. The nose is rich with nice amounts of chocolate and vanilla underneath a really fantastic bourbon presence. High-quality barrel-aging hits the spot with nice notes of oak and vanilla plus a smooth elixir. Taste is the same with the smooth bourbon character permeating the beer. This is quite a bit better than the regular Sexual Chocolate and something I will definitely seek out again."
"D - Brew this delicious is by definition way drinkable."
"Had on tap at the release. Insanely drinkable for such a strong beer. Strong bourbon nose and taste. Still a stout, still a dark beer. Don't have much to say except that it's on of the best BBA stouts I've ever had, if not the best period. Should be A+ in my book."
"Fairly thin for the style. A little bit of dryness on the finish. Highly quaffable for an RIS."
"Bottle. Un-numbered. Pours a dark black with a slight tan head. Oaky is the first aroma that comes to mind. Dark chocolate, coffe, toffee, and caramel in the nose as well. Boozy in the mouth after I swish it around a bit. Fairly sweet up front. Flavor wise the cocoa, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon make their presence known. Nice blend. Very solid. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, a decently enjoyable beer but just like some other barrel aged beers, this one is a tweak or 2 away from being really good."
"I hate to say it, but could this be a bit buggy? I don't know, but the thinness and light metallic notes definitely detracted. Nonetheless, it was quite solid overall."
"Overall, the barrel aging improved this beer a bit, but it didn't go to well with the base beer. I wasn't overly impressed with this one. It was alright, but nothing spectacular."
"D - Sooo drinkable... I wish I could drink this all day, barrel flavor is up front but so smooth. I wish I could have so much more. Similar to the regular SC I think you have to want a nice chocolatey stout to really enjoy this."
"Thanks Chris for this one! Pours a fairly lively dark cocoa, clear when held to the light. Nose was dry, bitter chocolate shavings, vanilla, some smooth malt. Really creamy in the mouth, the vanilla flavors are really nice and rich, the chocolate is dry and well done. Bitter chocolate in the finish. Light barrel, well done and well integrated. Carbonation was a bit high. Not overly complex but very drinkable and very good."
"I enjoyed this quite a bit, though it's somewhat flawed overall; Sexual Chocolate may simply be too thin of a beer for barrel aging."
"D: I think I preferred this to regular version, despite its pitfalls. The nose was really quite nice, and the beer tasted good as well."
"Good beer overall. A good tick, if not one of the best versions of this style I've come across in my epic quest."
"D: I think these guys know their way around a barrel; if they put in a heftier beer, I could see this being top-notch for the style. I like this one but I'm more impressed by the promise than the execution."
"D-Every once in awhile."
"I enjoyed this one and it is a great beer, it just needs a year or so in the bottle. Wish I could have tried the PVW version."
"d- I ended up getting to tag along to a brewery rep party with a complementary keg of this thanks to hanging out with the right BAs at the right time, so I literally drank this all night. I definitely felt how drinkable this one was the next morning. I don't think I'll have the chance to drink ""too much"" of this one again, but you bet your ass I could. this stuff is great."
"Beer is medium bodied, bigger body than the regular sexual chocolate. Its sweet with a vanilla oakiness to the back of it. The bitterness is minimal, there is some mild sweetness and of course nice chocolate. The liquor character of this beer is quite forward but its not hot. Its the kind of big ass stout you could drink all night on a cold winter night. Its truly an amazingly well balanced beer. Again, its sweet without being cloying, its not TOO heavy, its not thin, its bourbon but not hot, for as young as this beer is its amazingly good. I may need to get some of this."
"D: This is an awesome beer, and one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've had. Highly recommended."
"d - I loved this RIS; I enjoyed every aspect of it a lot. We tried a few great barrel aged stouts (BA Blackout, Ivan the Terrible) and I thought this was by far the best one. I find normal Sexual Chocolate a very good beer and thought this blew it away. Loved everything about it; would love to try again sometime."
"Finally getting around to actually drinking and reviewing this bad boy. Poured from the bottle into my Portsmouth balloon glass. A hard pour reveals a lovely black body with a huge billowing khaki head that sticks around for quite awhile. Leaves some lacing along the glass. Smells absolutely exquisite. A nice balance of sweet bakers chocolate and bourbon. This one isn't a bourbon bomb at all, but rather achieves a nice balance with the bourbon integrating perfectly with the other aromas. Taste as good as it smells. Dark chocolate, sweet dark fruits, and a light roasted malt flavor as well. All the while being balanced perfectly with the bourbon. You can definitely taste the bourbon but none of the normall ""hotness"" you get with it. Very nice job of barrel aging here. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue nicely. With the perfect amount of carbonation. Although this is a big barrel aged beer its never overly sweet or cloying, and the alcohol doesn't get in the way at all making this one dangerously drinkable. A definite home run from Foothills."
"What a tasty brew. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"D- I really enjoyed this brew! The barrel aging did well for this one. I would have no problem polishing off multiple bombers in one sitting :)"
"I'm curious how distinct the Pappy Van Winkle version was, but I guess I'll probably never know."
"Another let down."
"D: Small sips only, a rich, strong stout that hits the right notes."
"This beer is epic! A seriously tasty beer, and worth seeking out. It blows it's non BA sibling out of the water. Thanks for bottling this Foothills, and please make more soon!"
"D - What can I say, I drank my serving and my buddies serving and could have easily had a few more. This is an outstanding beer and a phenomenal merging of chocolate and bourbon (these are a few of my favorite things...). So happy to have made it to Winston-Salem on release day, can't wait to see if we can do it again next year!"
"Black pour with coffee brown highlights that I may have just been imagining. Slight ring around the top of the glass where a head might once have briefly sat. Rich smells of straight alcohol becomes more palatable as the beer has a chance to warm up a bit. Dark chocolate syrup, bosco, fills the air. The alchol heat is still present, but more identifiable as bourbon. And underneath it all, the roastyness of a stout. Taste is not as sweet as the nose would imply. The chocolate is more of a dark syrup than the milk chocolate taste of a Young's Double Chocolate. This is quite hot. The bourbon is aggressive and gives each sip a slight afterburn. Mouthfeel is nice, but I have had better - Speedway and Ten Fidy come to mind immediately. Drinkability is good, but not great. Again, this is a hot flavorful monster, and it drank slow. This was fine stuff, and I can only hope the bottles drink as well as the keg."
"Low carbonation and very, very smooth. Alcohol is well hidden as one could easily polish off a few pints of this in a session. This is the real deal and a perfect example of how barrel aging can take a good beer and make it incredible."
"I think I like this a tad better than the regular version (I usually prefer original versions over barrel-aged ones). The fact that the bourbon isn't intrusive, and that the extra special treatment makes everything glow a bit brighter, it's clearly a very special version of an already special beer. Rock on, Foothills."
"All in all, this is a phenomenal beer. I'm interested in trying the regular SC to see just how the bourbon barrel changed it."
"This is a very easy drinker. Restraint was hard to come by as this one just sat on the table egging me on and teasing me. Another outstanding beer from the guys at Foothills!"
"overall a stellar beer, one of the best for sure."
"D: Drinks nicely and is plenty balanced."
"D: The first time I had Sexual Chocolate, I was very disappointed and I immediately thought that it needed something else. Perhaps this barrel aging was it because this beer is far superior to the regular version. More robust, more complex, smoother, and simply more drinkable. Not all big beers do well after sitting in the barrels, but this is definitely one of them!"
"First glass served on-tap at the bottle release! This batch is aged in W.L. Weller barells. Served a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a bit of oak in front of roasted malts and smooth cocoa. The taste is a wonderful blend of oak and Bourbon in front of bitter cocoa and roasted malts. The beer is very smooth, and easy drinking with its alcohol quite well hidden, bit it is still a real sipper. While I was hoping this release would be Pappy Van Winkle aged, this is almost as good, hands down one the best beers I've ever had."
"D - I finished the 10oz. glass so quickly that I could have had at least a few more, but one was perfect."
"Still good and worth trying if you can."
"This beer is fantastic and easily one of the top 5 barrel aged stouts I've ever had. I hope to taste this beer again and will actively seek it out."
"D - Simply delicious and so easy to drink, especially given the high ABV%. I really enjoyed the coconut presence here. I could have drank this all night."
"D-Regardless of the carbonation loss this one still tastes great and is a real head scratcher when you try to figure out all of the flavours. I was glad to share this awesome beer with some good friends."
"Overall: Yes, please! Again and again and again, all night long. It's a Rated-R dessert in a glass."
"Unfuckingbelievable! Poured in my Double Bastard glass. Nice rusty brown, root beerish color. Tiny bubbles danced about with virtually no head. Smell was incredible. Light chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon was mized in nicely, did not overwhelm the beer. Taste was equally great. It mimiced the smells almost exactly, with an expectional balance. Man, do I love BA beers, especially Stouts aged in bourbon/whiskey. This beer got better as it warmed up, and was very easy to drink after awhile, which with it's high abv can cause problems. Definitely on my top 5 beer list. Pursue this incredible beer with the utmost of vigilance."
"Just a great, great stout. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to try it."
"I figure there will be more of this next go round. Make your deals, for you shan't be disappointed."
"Side Note: How I ended up in Hollywood, California drinking a super rare beer from North Carolina is an amazing testament to the power of the beer trading community. Thanks to the efforts of Khiasmus, myself and 6 other West Coast BAs were able to share a Growler of this remarkable beer."
"Barrel Aged Sexual Chocolate gets my highest recommendation."
"It is awesome."
"All in all: outstanding. Bravo Foothills."
"Drinkability - Well, I had three (3) glasses. If quantity is any indication of drinkability, then have at it. Well done Foothills."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. Draft. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma of bourbon and chocolate. Flavor of bourbon initially with a fudgy chocolate finish. Pretty good for a barrel aged beer with a mellow bourbon flavor that blends well with the base beer. Nice beer."
