Nose of bourbon, molasses, smoke, bittersweet chocolate, and old-world fruit highlights of plum and date. Flavors of roast and bittersweet chocolate forward, with rich molasses and fig in the backbone, hints of smoke highlights, and a bittersweet coffee and chocolate linger. Smooth, robust, but still crisp and dry in the finish, with a roasted, rich, and bitter aftertaste, and a fruit and chocolate linger. Fantastic!","GarthDanielson","Apr 10, 2014"

Taste and mouthfeel offer more on the aroma as the beer is smooth, medium bodied, but at times sticky like there's molasses in there (tastewise as well), and mostly this is like drinking a tamed stout as there is some heaviness and dryness thanks to roasted and coffee malts but it comes across more like java or coffee with a dash of chocolate (which sounds odd, I know). I did appreciate this beer for the light price and it works as a dessert sipper but not your textbook RIS (I will say I had no idea it was 10% either b/c it didn't come across as boozy).","clayrock81","Jul 28, 2013"

The liquid is a standard black or just maybe the darkest brown imaginable, close to impossible to gauge the carbonation level visually. The nose is overloaded by toasted dark chocolate and mocha powder, supported by licorice, vanilla bean, café au lait and challah bread notes, good amount of mixed apricot, cherry, plum fruit, ends via a suggestion of leafy sous bois and earthiness. Full-bodied yet creamy enough that the weight melts off quickly. The carbonation is appropriate for a beer of its size and it doesn’t feel heavy. The chocolate once more dominates the rest. However, the almonds, coffee, vanilla, mint and cola bean ain’t shabby. No alcoholic burn and the roast and toast isn’t as potent as in the nose. Possesses good flow and the finish is tactfully succinct, which may not be desired by all. Here the plum, cherry, blackberry fruit tends to hang off to the side, not overly sweet. High level of drinkability, not going for the jugular in the “wow” department.","farrago","Jul 26, 2013"

Tastes of bitter chocolate and treacle are expected, but there is a citrus hop flavor beneath the surface that surprises. The bitterness from the hops and slight astringency from the roasted malts combine for a very bitter finish with a drying impression. The nose gets a little boozy as it warms, but for 10% ABV the alcohol stays well-hidden throughout. Dangerously drinkable RIS.","BeerZack","Mar 23, 2013"

Then there is an interesting, tart flavor that I'm trying to put my finger on. Immediately switches to tasty biscotti and dark chocolate with just a hint of vanilla. Some lovely espresso notes as well. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than expected, and a bit...fizzy? Definitely not what I'm used to in a RIS. Drinkability is fairly high...ABV WELL-HIDDEN.

I know this may not be the most traditional Russian Stout, but, to me, it certainly is the most tasty. It smells like caramel and hops. It's pitch black with a quickly dissipating head. It tastes like ripened fruit and chocolate. For 10% ABV, its an awesome session beer. I can't imagine all the money I wasted looking for this beer. It can't be done any better.

A mild roasted bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with some solid aromas and flavors.

Dark chocolate less in the flavor, roast gives a pleasant and quite pinching dry finish to complement a slightly sweet and round body - nails it for a RIS. Only real detraction is this slight metallic character, almost minerally which is especially noticable in the first half a dozen sips and then fades out. ABV is hidden with just a slight warming in the finish. Really classic character to this stout, well balanced between roasty and fruity, dry and sweet - a really well made interpretation that has nothing fancy but focuses on hitting all the right notes.

3.3,-16,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Rabid Duck pours an impenetrable black, with about two and a half fingers of mocha foam topping off the beer. Retention is a bit brief, and there's just a touch of lacing left around the glass. The nose is of slightly burnt espresso, and some seriously bitter dark chocolate. The flavor is carried by those same notes, and while it's not as bad as beers that have a straight roast flavor, this one tastes like it's leaning a bit heavy on the dark specialty grains. The surprisingly dry finish and lack of sweetness only accentuates this. Despite that, the body, while a bit less robust than I'd normally expect, is still comfortably full for the style. This is probably aided by the appropriately subdued carbonation that manages to keep itself out of the way. I usually enjoy Duck Rabbit's offerings, but their crack at an imperial stout was just a bit of a miss for me.","axeman9182","Jun 24, 2011"

And with the first taste I wasnt wrong for waiting. This beer opens up with a lot of graham cracker, mocha, and a bit of roast. It also has a lot of nice sweet malt character to it that balances the roast in the beer. In the aroma you get a lot of graham cracker, sweet ginger, and a bittersweet dark chocolate. I am really impressed with this beer, because not only have a great taste and intoxicating aroma, it has a great foam stability for a stout. Even after the one finger head dissipates it keeps a nice layer of foam on the top of the beer. The mouthfeel is the best part, it coats the tongue and eases down the esophagus. Overall, this beer really beat my expectations and really surprised me. This beer is definitely worth trying, and trying again. I am going to age a few and see how the profile changes. Now, only if it was barrel aged it would be amazing, especially with the added oak, vanilla, and bourbon/whiskey components. Duck-Rabbit please do a Barrel-Aged Rabid Duck.","PaulStoneAnchor","Jun 02, 2011"

Bitter malt and alcohol makes up most of the flavor. However there are subtle hints of chocolate, tart fruit, and coffee. Plenty of alcohol warmth. Just too harsh to be considered one of the premier RIS. The body is where this beer completely disappears. Far too thin to carry the ABV. The low carbonation helps but it is not a satisfying drinking experience. Plus it tastes harsh and is too boozy. Only my second Duck-Rabbit beer.

Not knowing what to expect, I poured this thing into a pint glass, and it was quite dark, nearly black with just a touch of light coming through the edges. Luckily that smell I first detected went away as it was poured into the glass (shew) and opened up to some chocolate, sherry, and lightly oxidized notes. Taste is straightforward with the chocolate, roast is there, but it's more on the toasty side rather than the bitter charred side. There's light sourness/twang on the back end that makes this beer seem like it has a cherry-like flavor, but then is overtaken by a creamy, chocolaty finish. It's quite good, but there's something about the middle of this beer that's throwing me off. Mouthfeel is superb. Ultra creamy with low carbonation, but still enough there to produce delightful belches.

Very aromatic, but rough around the edges, with lots of dark malts that contribute licorice, coffee and leather, blended with a bit of green hops and peppery alcohol which emerges later. Densely-packed with flavor, there are lots of dark malts which give bitter and acidic notes, along with chocolate, coffee and licorice. Light hop flavor to boot, and it has a medium body that finishes roasty and dry. This is a tasty brew, and the alcohol is well-hidden on the palate, but it needs to mellow a bit.

Huge fluffy mocha colored head that recedes down to a pleasant collar after a few sips. The aroma is equally impressive with notes of chocolate, marshmallow and peanut butter. Really delicate vanilla aromas of malted barley and cocoa powder. The flavor is complex and has a very deep dark fruitiness that lends itself to chocolate and espresso notes. The booze stings just a touch on the aftertaste but this is being drank around 60 degrees. Very nice and creamy otherwise. Mouthfeel has a dry finish with an alcoholic bite but is masked well by the dark chocolate flavors. This is over carbonated for the style and does show in it's huge head. For this it's uncharacteristic of the style and my preference. Drinkability is above average and gets my vote As a great Russian imperial stout.

Frankly, appearance-wise, it doesn't get much better than this in a RIS. The nose is impressive, primarily due to the rich intensity of the aroma profile. I get a considerable amount of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. In fact, the aroma really reminds me of a baby version of the Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island. Flavors generally replicate the nose, except the chocolate flavor leans towards dark chocolate, and the light hoppy bitterness seems to give the beer something of coffee ground flavor component. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner then I was expecting given the flavor profile, but nevertheless, it's still pretty full, rich and long. Drinkability is pretty good for a 10% beer, though needless to say, with a beer this rich and boozy, it's slow going working through my cheater pint.

The lacing that will eventually form is very nice. The smell is of dark malts (grainier than usual), coffee, chocolate, and even a hint of vanilla bean. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of light coffee, slightly bitter cocoa, faint tobacco, and those dark malts from the nose, though they're wheatier here than before. Up 'til now, things have gone according to the usual RIS plot. Where things deviate is in the mouthfeel. Usually these dark beasts are thick, chewy, even crunchy, and coat the mouth very thickly. This guy is decidedly lighter than usual, more toward a light medium than anything heavy; the low carbonation is pretty normal, and there is some coating, but not as much as one would expect. Still, despite this unexpected variance on the style, the overall brew is very tasty and very drinkable.","TMoney2591","Apr 26, 2010"

The hazelnut has a small presence that lends itself at the end. The taste is a combination of the cocoa and coffee flavors. I can't really get a sense of any hazelnut in the taste. Good strong combination of flavors that blend well together and form this beer. For its ABV this beer hides it. It is because of that that this beer could be dangerous if consumed in mass quanities.

Smells of molasses, floral hops, dark caramel, milk chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes of prunes, molasses, slightly sour, cocoa powder, raisins, figs.

The smell is a roasted malt type of RIS, definitely not what you'd call a hopped one. The taste was a little better, a little bit of fruit esters mixed with the roasted malts. Almost similar to Blackout Stout but only in spirit, it really wasn't near as fruity as Blackout. I'd say the body's good too, thicker than average.

If I were handed a pint of this and didn't know what it was, I would guess the abv to be in the high 7's, low 8's perhaps. Mouthfeel is heavy and *almost* oily, but not quite. In fact, if I could improve upon one aspect of this stout, I would want it oilier / thicker. When it comes to high abv super-heavy stouts, especially when it's starting to get chilly at night, they cannot be too heavy, imo. Outside of that, this is an absolutely brilliant stout!","SilentSabre","Oct 14, 2008"

Taste has dark burnt chicory in it, molasses and soy sauce (seems like it would pair very well with barbecue). Alcohol adds a bit of mild fruit beneath the smoky barbecue aspect of it. Body is not bad at all, but doesn't quite measure up to the strong flavors present in this beer. To me, if the tastes are that strong, so should the girth of the beer, body and alcohol wise. Drinkability is lowered slightly by some of the strong numbing flavors, but is still very respectable. This is my first beer from the guys at Duck Rabbit, and I am not disappointed.

Quarter inch tan-colored head quickly dispersed into foam and ringlets as it eventually coalesced into a band around the edges; only spots of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is big, sweet and malty. I picked up coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and brown sugar. Taste is consistent with nose; dark fruit really comes out in the mouth and there is even a bit of tartness that is revealed. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied and is silky smooth with a little effervescence in the background. Drinkability is good, but not great. Flavors push the fringes of the style, but alcohol is fairly well-hidden. Fruit flavors are a little too big, however, and overwhelms the palate.

The brown head over the body was quite thin. The smell was a little too mild for what this was. I detected coffee, cocoa, and toffee in the nose. The taste was where this seasonal release started to come into its own. The level of roasty and hop bitterness detected in the first sip was completely unexpected based on the smell. This was followed by a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish was astringent and grainy. Quite dry for the style with not much in the way of fruit or residual sugars. The alcohol was apparent due to the warmth but not blatant. Quite a bit thicker feeling in the mouth than it looked. Quite American in character with a heavy West Coast style hop profile.

It had a pleasant sweet caramel flavour with notes of licorice, sour cherry, semisweet chocolate, and roast throughout. The sour cherry and roast, along with a bit of alcohol, really lingered. The carbonation was on the coarse side, but the texture was still alright - a bit creamy with a full body.

Some sour dark fruit notes are there that resemble plum and grape skin in the underripe form. Almost as if it were brewed with sour cherries. The sour and bitter really battle on the mouthfeel.

Three full fingers of thick, tight, bubbly coffee brown head formed, and stuck around almost all the way through. Generous amounts of lace clung to the sides of the glass. Awesome nose on this brew. Thick chocolate aromas dominated, some roasty/toasty notes, and just a hint of freshly brewed coffee. So far so good. Taste was on point as well. Very bitter up front with some thick coffee flavors, tons of semi-sweet chocolate, some nice roasted malt flavors, and a little bit of hops and smoke in the background. Finishes a little boozy but is pretty smooth. Has a thick, full bodied, almost chewey mouthfeel. Drinkability is great despite the high ABV.","jaxon53","Nov 06, 2007"

Taste has loads of roasted malts as well as coffee, chocolate and alcohol is quite present also. As the beer warms up a bit I also detect some dark fruits like prunes, raisins as well as chocolate covered cherries.

What depth with very complex tight wound flavors. Same black currant, plumy flavors as the nose showed. Without any sign of red cherry however. A bit of an herbal quality on the finish as well.

A roasted flavor mixes with an acidic tanginess towards the finish. There is anise flavor throughout the taste. Heavy in body, smooth and rich up front with a tanginess and drying finish.

4.27,8.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a siniser deep deep brown color, only signifying that it is not black through a weak crimson highlite at the bottom of the glass. A half finger of dark tan head falls to a very spotty coat over top. Only a few stray bubbles are seen streaming upwards through the liquid. This is a good looking beer. The aroma is intense. I get huge notes of blackstrap molasses, with a touch of soy sauce, backed by a solid foundation of dark chocolate and a touch or roast. This one is still a little cold, so I will see what it does as it warms up. After letting it sit for a while, the chocolate notes sweeten up and come through a lot stronger, displacing the molasses as top dog. The first sip brings a big strong chocolate covered espresso bean combination of chocolate and coffee. The hop is a bit piney, but blends really well with deep roast and chocolate sweetness to really nail the coffee flavor in there. A touch of soy hits right after swallowing the beer, but then things move to a very smooth chocolate after taste, with a slight bitterness clinging on. This is really tasty beer. Mouthfeel on this one is where things are a little interesting. it is well to the thick end of moderate, but with a touch of slickness and a light to moderate carbonation that really makes this one feel a lot less robust than I feel it needs to be. I want this beer to be chewy. That said, I don't think it detracts from the overall experience more than a little. There is no clue in the aroma or flavor that this is a monsterous 10%, leaving it very clean and easy drinking. This one is just full of aroma and flavor.

Another nice dark brew from Duck-Rabbit, who'da thunk it?","ppoitras","Mar 03, 2006"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Body is big, creamy, and goes down like silk. Texture is thick and oily, very mouth coating. Just a hint of the 10%, quite a nice sipper. Wish I could find more of this, it disappeared off the shelves way too quickly.","AlexJ","Jan 31, 2006"
4.35,10.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, moderately heavy. Full-bodied, pleasant and highly drinkable for the style. This one's a winner from an otherwise unnoticed brewery, it could stand with the best in the US. I could definitely session a few.","assurbanipaul","Jan 30, 2006"
4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,5,4," Very drinkable for a 10% brew... unfortunately the thickness (which I love) makes it difficult to stomach more than a few of these over the course of a night. However, all in all, D-R's best offering in my opinion. Very nice work.","nickss","Jan 27, 2006"

4.11,4.6,5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is really a delicious Russian Imperial Stout. It pours out a beautiful black beer with a lush reddish brown head that stays firm to the glass and never disappears. The smell is roasted with lots of coffee like aroma. Very traditional to the style. The taste is great. A lot of brewers try to put too much hops in this great style, and this beer has the perfect amount of hops. Just enough to balance out and sweeten up the chocolaty roasts I taste, and yet it doesn't overshadow. A very floral and roasted taste. Mouthfeel is pretty typical of the style. Thick enough to notice and separate it from some other beers. An excellent beer to chew on for awhile if you can take it. No alcohol to discourage the palate, and only a slight warming of the esophagus.","cracgor","Jan 25, 2006"
4.65,18.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The aroma is intense. Very concentrated dark roasted chocolate, molasses and cocoa. Pours deep black from the 12 oz bottle and settle down to a thumb thick dark brown head that is mostly creamy with a few dispersed bubbles. Dark burnt chocolate in the fore. Quite rich and thick like dark chocolate brownies. Hints of quality espresso and a flavor that approaches marzipan..that isnt quite the flavor, but it something almond/nutty and sweet. Its flipping delicious whatever it is. Also get some fig/date notes and a strong coffee/esspresso finish. Damn nice brew. So glad NC popped the cap if this is the beer they are going to put out","Jredner","Jan 24, 2006"
4.15,5.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is oily but feels a bit thin, probably medium in body overall, like most russian impy stouts. Coats well and the flavor really hangs in there. Drinkability is good, the in your face flavor could become overwhelming. A very good brew and a awesome first shot by the "dark beer specialists".","blitz134","Jan 08, 2006"

4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The long awaited high gravity brew from Farmville does not disappoint - The hops are evident upon opening and it pours a thick viscous almost jet black - The nose is of dark roasted coffee with nuances of bitter chocolate - This is definitely a beer drinkers beer - Look forward to trying it with a good brownie","Cindirene","Jan 06, 2006"
4.12,4.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"10-08-07: Still good but certainly downhill. Harsh on the tongue, seems to have lost some malt and become more roasty and rough...with a souring aftertaste. A little muddy. Aroma has held up better, but is still a touch behind what it was.","blackie","Jan 05, 2006"
4.23,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Purchased a bottle at Whole Foods for $1.75, think it rang up wrong to my benefit. Pours a midnight black color with am immpressive 3 fingure head that last throughout the drink, also tons of lacing. Immdiate sweet smell of chocolate and liquor. Sweet toasted malt chocolate tatste, with a slight alchohol finish, not as powerful finish as the 10% hinted. Good mouthfeel and balance. In my opion the best brew by Duck Rabbit. Keep up the good work over there in Farmville.","buckiflyer","Jan 04, 2006"
4.5,14.5,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Been looking forward to this one for a while now. Pours thick black with amocha colored head that quickly drops to a collar. Smells of molasses, maraschino cherry, with nice stab of deep roast. Tastes very nice. Flavors are very well melded. Starts off sweet with sweetened roast and molasses, moves into dark fruits, raisiny, cherry, then it immediately gets roastier and earthier, and a bit spicy as its dries. Lots of roast through the finish, with some definite grain bitterness as well as hops, yet still completely smooth. Mouthfeel is oily, chewy, moderate to low carbonation, viscous, but not overly so. I like it. Alcohol is present in some very pleasant alcohol spiciness but nowhere else. This is very drinkable, and one of my favorite imperials thus far as it fits a lot of the characteristics i enjoy in a RIS, particularly the drying finish. This also happens to flesh out wonderfully as it warms.","numenor1","Jan 01, 2006"
4.15,5.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark, impenetrable black topped by a creamy two-finger tan head. Rich aroma of dark roasted malt, grassy hops, and light peaty smoke. Palate is dominated by a blend of rich chocolate and sweet caramel malts, balanced by a touch of grassy hops. Notes of peat, cracked black pepper, and dark fruit peek out on the finish. Body is nice and creamy, holding the flavor well. I have to say, Duck-Rabbit is fast becoming one of my favorite breweries anywhere, much less in North Carolina.","ElGordo","Dec 30, 2005"
4.02,2.3,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Nice to try a new offering from DR,poured and opaque black with a tight mocha colored head,big roasted malt aromas and French roast coffee a touch of dark fruit and the alcohol seemed to creep in a little as it warmed.I found this to be quite earthy for and Impy stout quite good but Iam not sure if thats on for the style,anyways dark roasted coffee and raw earthiness mainly in the finish dominate here just a tad of dark fruit.Alcohol becomes more evident as it warmed all in all not bad,thanks to hoppedup for sharing last night.","oberon","Dec 30, 2005"
3.78,-3.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Glad to see this beer in NC! A sipping beer for sure. Worth trying. I'll set a couple of these in a corner of my basement and try them around Halloween, 2006.","ncbrewerbun","Dec 30, 2005"
4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours jetblack like motor oil with a milk chocolate head that dissapates quickly. Heavy roasted malts, chocolate, and burnt coffee aromas, mmm. Very slight hop flavor to start, then a strong takeover of roasted malts, coffee and some nutty undertones. This leaves with a bitter dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surprisingly oily and lighter than what it appears when pouring. As already noted, this beer gets much more complex and smoother as it warm's. This beer has definate "velvet hammer" potential, as the alcohol (10%) is surprisingly well hidden. An excellent beer and proud to say from NC. Go get you some.","drunkmonk","Dec 28, 2005"
