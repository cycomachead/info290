"When I am in the mood for an imperial stout, this is a go-to.  So dark, rich, flavorful - one of the local gems for a dark beer lover."
""
""
""
""
"Just epic beyond belief, this is my favourite imperial stout hands down l, if you can find this exceptional stout buy some. 5/5 O.B.D91"
"Truly Exceptional!!!! An utterly delicious imperial stout!"
"Everything you would expect from the style...robust chocolate malt aroma, velvety mouthfeel and a great balance of flavor with the sweet cacao, roasted malt and the pinch of light hop.  One of the best of this style, up there with old rasputin."
""
""
""
""
""
"An impressive stout for sure!"
""
""
""
"GREAT stout. A notch below Founder's BS in my estimation, but really up there with the best of them."
""
""
""
"Great Imperial Stout! Buy this every chance I get."
""
"Black pour with thick brown foam; lots of lacing. Toffee and chocolate pudding notes. Toffee and chocolate balanced with hop presence. Medium/ creamy with a little alcohol bite on tip of tongue; hop resin finish. Nicely balanced, rich and delicious."
""
"very good, but a little harsh and a little too thick for my liking, but still an amazing stout. its pricey though"
""
"2013 can poured into a snifter. It's no surprise that Brah-lorado (aka, ""The Bros."") gave this a perfect score. Its far from a subjective perfect, but it is damn good. For anyone interested, the 2009 can I tasted from a few months back was among the tastiest non-BA imperial stouts I've ever tried. With just 18 months in the cellar, this one pours a deep, dark black with the viscosity of freshly changed motor oil cycled through a 30-year-old Buick for a few days. The nose reminds me of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. At this point I'm reminded of how much the head lingers and contributes to the heavy lacing, presumably due to the heavy body. Flavor-wise, there's a good amount of sweetness, with baking spices, honey and brown sugar at the forefront. There's also some chocolate, some coffee and some lingering floral hops. I couldn't drink this exclusively, nor could I drink it all day, but for an occassional treat, it really hits the spot."

"Exceptional, so smooth for such a big beer. Probably the best stout I have had."
"Overall: Would pick this up all the time if it were readily available. Pricey, but a must-try for any doubters in regards to how great cans are. This brew is a testament to how far craft has come in complexity of flavor in such a seriously intricate style. IN A CAN. Great job."
""
"Wow, impressive offering from Oskar Blues."
"Has the chew.  Reminds me of tootsie rolls, carmel, light coffee that linger then faded into an very faint iron taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my first one, but this one is 18 months old and I gotta say, it might be even better than the fresh one's I had initially purchased.  I'm a little surprised by this as it is in a can and you don't often here good things about canned beer aging."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark, espresso-like, full but not obnoxious flavour; not much head to speak of, great taste and mouthfeel"
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer totally exceeded all expectations. Probably the best RIS I have had, and one of the top ten production beers I have drank ever. Although the price can be a turn off, it is worth the coin to grab a four or six pack of these. Its a religious experience."
""
"O: Very impressed with this beer, lots going on, it's big, definitely a sipper and one to keep in the fridge as a stout lover, if you love big stouts this one is definitely worth a try and most likely to become a regular Russian Imperial Stout, very good stout."
"This is what a baseline RIS should taste like. Pours thicker than motor oil and just as black. It can't compete with the new breed of special craft imperials like Hunapuh and Abraxas, but in that top tier of baseline Russian Imperial Stouts with Speedway and Marshall Zhukov."
""
""
"An awesome beer!"
"Wow.  That was a super tasty stout.  Giving you a punch in the face of hearty flavor without trying too hard.  Absolutely delicious.  You could drink packs of these if your liver could keep up.."
""
""
"Looked forward to this one.  First beer from Oskar Blues and it didn't disappoint.  A well crafted RIS and a titan among stouts."

"Delicious, chocolaty, stouty goodness.  Love everything about it, one of the best stouts I've had the pleasure to try and will drink many more in the future"
"Can't beat the price and the quality. This is one of my favorite stouts."

"really enjoyed it"
"An extremely tasty stout…very well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Sure, I suppose that what classifies one as a Russian Imperial Stout, what some might call a ""classic"" RIS, is its ABV and other factors. Still, I find any RIS with a thin body just plain weird. So sue me. If you're like me, then you'll have no worries with the Ten Fidy. This is a roast milkshake that is perfect for a nice, slow drink. I enjoyed every bit of this."
"Ink Black with a thick tan head. Licorice aroma.  Dark chocolate, coffee, licorice flavor and a hint of cherries. Thick mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fucking big ass flavour. Knocks my socks off"
"I drank this on 03/09/2015."
""
""
"12oz can poured into a snifter. Pours an oil-black color with dense tan head. Carbonation bubbles cling to the bottom of the glass. Much lacing. Roast coffee scent but also vanilla-like sweetness. The carbonation gives the beer some texture.  Coffee taste with bitterness in the finish. Very good beer. (9.0)"
"Very full bodied imperial stout.  Its a great treat for a special occasion, but I wouldn't drink it every day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours like motor oil out of the can with thick brown head. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, ripe dark fruit (plums/prune). Tastes sweet up front with a tangy, smoky malt with a hint of coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit leathery and smoke. Hops balance the sweetness with a pleasant mid note bite. Full bodies, creamy, a bit syrupy but not unpleasant – sweet finish. Overall a great winter warmer, meant to be sipped and savored. I was really surprised by how good it was, and I will make this a go to for warming up on a cold day."

"I've had this in the taproom before, and, while it was good, I don't recall it being this good. Perhaps my tastes have matured. Whatever the case, this was a real treat...a perfect beer to sip on. I don't detect the smokiness that others have described (""not that there's anything wrong with that"")...just roastiness, as expected and appropriate, with some very earthy notes. I'm not a big fan of sweet beers, but this one manages to tread the line...I'm almost turned off by it, but yet it still manages to be so good. Lovely."
""
"very overrated. smokey and not in a good way"
""
""
""
""
""
"A Great stout. Enough said."
""
""
""
"This beer was a pretty impressive offerings from Oskar Blues yet again. Drinkable, and more importantly enjoyable, throughout with plenty of flavour packed into the can whilst managing to keep a good balance too. For an imperial stout I didn't think the beer was overly complex but I did like it, I just don't think it's one I'm likely to return to all that often since there are several other American brewed imperial stouts out there that I prefer to this one."
""
""
"When you pour this beer, it's a deep, thick Black with a Tobacco coloured head with absolutely great Head retention for this style. It even leaves sticky lacing on the sides of the glass! I don't think I've had an Imperial stout, apart from this one that had such great retention and actually left lacing on the glass! On the nose there's lots of Roasty Malt notes, Coffee, Chocolate and a light bit of Alcohol in the background. How does this beer taste? Where do I start?! Smokey flavours, Raisins, Roasty Coffee and Chocolate notes, Light toffee and a touch of sarsaparilla and molasses on the finish. The beer is quite thick and viscous, lightly carbonated and finishes Medium dry."
"mediocre at best not sure why its in the top 250"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- World class, I now know why people flip over this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A: Black, thick dark head, no retention. S: Molasses, unsweetened chocolate, smoke, and grain.T: Smokey, coffee, raisins, roasty, molasses, burnt bitter finish, leafy hops, a touch of esters and cutting acid in the margin. Hints of rootbeer upon warming.M: FULL-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation, O: Amazing appearance, layered aromas and flavors, a great beer that’s not in my favorite style."
""
"Pours viscous and bkack as night with a two finger brown sugar color head.  Aroma is chocolate and maybe faint coconut.  Taste is rich!  Chocolate, roast, and then more chocolate!  Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy.  Overall a delicious, delicious stout that matches the best I've had.  A wonderful treat."
""
"Best big beer/stout in a can. Nuff said."
""
"Great stout. Great flavor very well made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a great beer, don't get me wrong. It was just to chocolate-y for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
"This is, by far and away, my favorite stout...and perhaps my favorite beer.  I dig the motor oil comparison, and the cappuccino hued bubbles that cling to the sides of my glass.  The drink tastes like a well prepared meal with lots roasted and toasted bits.  It pours and drinks like a 3% milk.  A four pack of Ten Fidy is a beautiful way to splurge on a Saturday night by a roaring fire pit. Skol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite stout!"
"O (4.25) - So I'm not quite digging the Oskar beers.  But I do like this one.  I for sure will drink this again, and will probably buy again in the future"
"O - Thickest beer I have ever poured out of a can.  Thick and a huge head for a stout.  Smell and taste were great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stunning color, with a strong smoke flavor this time around"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An iconic RIS and well worth the per can price!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite consistent stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over-rated, IMO.... Won't buy again."
""
""
"Lots of roast which I am not a fan of."
"Pours viscous and darker than dark. Clingy brown head. Smells of roasted, slightly smokey malt, coffee, chocolate - all with no hint of alcohol. Amazing. Taste is more of the same as the smells translate to a sweet, roasted, incredibly well-balanced flavor. Is this really near 100 IBUs? Remarkable. And dangerous. This goes down way to smooth and easy."
""
""
"What a stout should be. Smooth and rich.  Had both growler and can.  Growler a bit better but both some of the best beer be ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a great beer"
""
"This is the second 5 that I have given.  The first - being a hop head - was heady topper.  Trying Ten Fidy today was tie with Heady for being the most profound moment of my beer drinking experience.  Amazing beer!  Jet Black, toasty smell.  The taste and feel are what catapults this to the stratosphere - taste is creamy, chocolate, coffee.  The feel is like well carbonated motor oil that coats the mouth goes down ridiculously smooth for 10.5%!?!?!  There is no hint of alcohol at all.  Truly a glorious beer.  I will buy this every time I find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome dark ooze.  Nice dark tan head that sticks around.  Smells of heavily roasted malts, a slight sweetness, and a little boozey.  Tastes roasty, decadent dark chocolate, some coffee, maybe a little caramel sweetness, and a hint of booze that's covered up nicely.  Feels so thick and creamy.  This is the kind of shit that preserves dinosaurs for eons. Awesome!"
""
""
"stellar"
""
""
"This oil can colored, potent stout resembles what a world class stout should be. Don't bother pouring it all into a glass. It sips fine out of the can--all the way to the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Must warm for full flavor. Dark oily beer with little lace or head. Bold roast aroma when warm. Coffee and dark malt flavor. Silky mouthfeel and boozy finish."
"Excellent product from Oskar Blue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very easy taste for an imperial. Not to sweet but still not too bitter"
"A lot like a German Dopplebock.Syrupy finish, happy backbone, intense but very approachable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid stout.  Better and more flavorful as it warms."
"I have to say this is a really really nice standard stout."
"Tried this at work recently. One of the best beers I've ever had hands down. Everything you want from a Russian Imperial Stout. Chocolate, coffee, roasty flavors. Perfectly rich and creamy with plenty of booze that will warm you up."
""
"Pours oily black and clearly viscous with an ample two finger brown head.  Smells slightly sweet with dark cherry, dark chocolate, brown sugar and roast malt.  Tastes really nice, blended nicely between the cherry and sugar and some hop bitterness and malt tang.  Mouth feel is viscous but has just enough carbonation to offset that thickness.  Overall, this is a really wonderful imperial stout....best I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very solid RIS, certainly the best available in a can! Will be a go to for camping, tailgating and any other time a can is more practical."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a Awesome stout. Its the gift that never quits giving. Every time I have it I am reminded, yes, there is such thing as a superior stout over all the other good stouts."
""
"Doesnt get any better out of a can yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Wow, just wow!!  What a beer!   What a stout!!  MASSIVE, bold flavors, all wrapped up in an extremely smooth and creamy beer.  Truly one of the best non-barrel-aged imperial stouts that I’ve had and equal to Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout, Founders’ Imperial Stout, Great Lakes’ Blackout Stout and Left Hand’s Wake Up Dead.  Truly Spectacular!!"
""
"The best imperial stout I've had...So far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Some what over hyped.  A great beer but let me down just a bit.  Dark roasted malts, chocolate followed by mineral, dry dark fruit.  really good not great."
""
"I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile.  I can say this beer did not disappoint me at all and I will search it out in the future.  Definitely worth trying."
""
""
"Extremely good Russian Imperial Stout.  I can't think of one I've had thats bigger or better than this."

"I first tried this with my wife. She is not a stout person! But to my surprise she loved it. I took my first sip and was in love. It pours like it's name makes you think like motor oil. The taste is almost overwhelming so much happening coffee, chocolate,  licorice... it goes on and on. It has the best finish and can hold its own to any other stout!"
""
""
"Pours like motor oil with a distinctive taste and feel.  This Imperial Stout is not for the faint of heart.  As the can says, ""this dog'll hunt."""
""
""
"Try this.  It's really good."
"Tracking my beers in 2015, haven't had this one yet. But plenty in 2014, and expect to have one soon, readily available for me it seems. I am a hophead but open minded. The first time I had this beer wasn't expecting too much, esp from a can, and I wasn't well versed yet in Oskar Blues beers. Then bam!  Eyes opened, eyebrows raised and taken aback! Holy crap, what the heck is this???  Dark, deep robust, all the favors others describe. Dark look, nice pour, strong but smooth dark stout taste. This immediately became one of my top 5.  Amazingly well made beer, like liquid oil bliss in a can. I've had others of similar style, but this one stands out. I have since become a huge fan of Oskar Blues, almost all their beers are well made for each style. You gotta try this beer, even if strong beers are not your style, but, as with any beer per the style, keep an open mind. If you know beers well, you will appreciate how well this beer is made."

""

""
""
"O: Very well executed for the style and a great drink!"
""
"This is a big, big boozy imperial stout. Pours from the can with a thin mocha head and dark body. The aroma is just as BIG. I can sense an anise/licorice undertone on the nose as well as the chocolate piece. Coffee notes comes out as this beer warms, with a rich, deep thick mouthfeel making for a very satisfying, sticky finish. The bold roasted flavor with the expansive, smooth texture elevates this stout. This beers’ reputation precedes it, but for good reason."
""
""
""
"One of the best Imperial Stouts in the U.S.!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite stouts, love it on Tap"
""
"Outstanding example of an Imperial Stout"
"I guess there was a reason this came in a $13 four pack of 12oz-ers. With the first glimpse of this blacker than black thick as molasses brew pouring from the can to pint, to the end finish of the most intense roasts and malts, this beer is everything and more. Stay in from the bars for a night and have one of these guys."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick solid black with a strong tan head that remains with excellent lacing and retention. So thick and dark you cannot tell the carbonation level, but the head retention suggests fairly active. Smells of oatmeal, brandy, and decadent dark chocolate. On the nose, coffee and cream. Mid-palate some acidic coffee-- Ethiopian and Kona. Back palate deep cocoa and cooking chocolate-- heavy, deep, and bitter but not overwhelming. Tartness plays well against malty bread notes. Deep toffee. Vanilla. Some pepper and cream. So much going on. Every sip is another level. This is brilliance. This is the work of the Beer Gods. I'm finding hops and esters. Some raisins. A little brandy. Some oak and some smoke. The rabbit hole is deep. The alcohol is subtle. The smoothest stout at this ABV. Then the ABV hits your brain. Warm fuzz. Warm chest. I could go on. There is no point. Buy it. Experience it. Then put it on BA. 4.5 out of 5. Excellent. Recommended."

"Smooth  strong better ad warms. Suprisingly good."

"almost everything i am looking for in a stout. black as tar, dark fruit & licorice smell, wonderful taste & coating. would definitely buy again"
"O - A really great, super accessible Imperial Stout."

"O: an outstanding beer plain and simple.  Glad I saw it this evening and even more glad it's in a 4-pack."

""

""
""
"Pour black with a dark tan head. Smells of dark roast malts, dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla and a bit of oak. Tastes of very rich dark roast malts, coffee, dark chocolate and a  Medium carbonation with full body. Dark malt, coffee and dark chocolate with a light pine on the aftertaste. A very light pine resin left on the lips. I do not really detect any booze which is impressive with 10.5% abc. Outstanding imperial stout!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, hot damn, this stuff is absolutely awesome. I can only imagine what this RIS is like when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a session but an experience beer. Maybe the perfect beer. It's EXCELLENT warm, comes in an aluminum can(glassware mandatory) and you get a buzz from one 12 ounce beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer blew my mind.  It's as black as soy sauce and even has a hint of that scent as you first sip it.  Awesome mouth feel with tons of extra dark chocolate notes.  No sense of the alcohol content.  It's a sipper through and through.  Just picked up 64 oz. of it for Christmas Eve dinner.  Hope I remember to put cookies out for Santa Claus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks like used motor oil, smells of chocolate. Silky smooth tastes like a stout with very little carbonation has an alcohol bite at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an awesome stout. Just trying it for the first time and I love it just as much as founders imperial stout, and that's my favorite.  Very thick and dark with a somewhat small head that is deep brown. Smells of everything a great stout should smell like, coffee, dark chocolate, and slight hops. Taste is the same. Everything is balanced wonderfully and I can't wait to get some more. Thanks Oskar Blues"

"O:  Good beer but not as good as I was expecting.  More dark fruit and licorice than chocolate and toffee."

"Definitely a quality beer."
"one of the best imperial stouts on the market if you can find it. I was very lucky man today. Nice rich dark coffee and chocolate notes with a beautiful dark brown head wonderful aromatics."
"Amazing beer but I would have enjoyed it a bit more bitter, but for a 10.5 very smooth. my friend said it best. you could drink it all day till you stand up."

"This beer is blacker than night when pouring. You can see your soul in the blackness that is ten fidy. This is one of the best if not the best imperial stout and its in a can. Beat that pretentious bottle heads. This is a must for anyone who thinks most stouts are malt foreword this has hops. It's really just a decadent creamy chocolate bar that you can drink. Fuck Industry Do it Yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
"One isn't enough, two is too many!"
""
"O- Undoubtedly a fantastic imperial stout, but at nearly $4 a can, the value (or lack thereof) is hard to justify against other stouts (some barrel aged and/or brewed with adjuncts) in the same category. However, if you are in the mood to treat yourself, Ten FIDY is certainly worthy of a try. (4.5)"

"I'm pretty sure this was first year of Oskar Blues arriving in the Twin Cities.  I've had several of their styles and been very impressed.  Nothing prepared me for Tenfidy though.  Very impressive stout.  If you're a fan of the style, this is a no brainer.  Amazing mouthfeel, thick and oily.  Just amazing.  Nothing bad to say except the fact that the cans are only 12 oz!!  Welcome addition to the Twin Cities market."

"Wow, what a beer. Pours like motor oil(good luck trying to see anything through it. Head is light coffee colored with tons of agitated bubbles and tremendous lacing. Aroma is rather light with malt tones, roast coffee and chocolate cake. Taste is very creamy with some sweetness, roasted coffee(espresso) and some toasted chocolate(just to the edge of burnt, but not). Overall, this beer is a mouthful and brings out lots of coffee, chocolate and a touch(ever so small ) amount of hop bitterness. This beer lingers on the palate, and U know what????. That's ok. Full bodied and the epitomy of an amazing imperial stout !!!!!!!!!!!"
"Overall: One of the best readily available stouts out there."

"I've had this beer on tap and I'd probably give it a 4.5. But the can version, which I've had twice is just not the same in my book.  Just a 4."

"This is a true classic among Imperial Stouts, a masterpiece...  powerful, uncompromising, demanding, this is the Death Metal of beers, and much like that musical genre not for everyone's taste, but very rewarding for those willing to explore its dark depths."

"Overall a superb imperial stout - pretty much the benchmark for me.  Have had this a year old and it does evolve nicely, but fresh is pretty much just awesome, so not sure how many will see a birthday from this year in my cellar!"

"If I want a dark chocolate beer I'll just stick with my girly Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate stout. :) I had no idea that this beer was going to be this bitter (95 IBU!!), I would have never paid 15 dollars for a 4 pack if I had known. I need to grown a thick beard and ride a unicycle before I can enjoy this level of manliness. I don't know how someone can pretend to enjoy this. I can't imagine what sort of food they call ""good food"". Meh, to each their own I guess."

"Pours pitch black with a dark coffee colored head that lasts and lasts. The smell is full of coffee and dark chocolate. The taste was divine with espresso and chocolate in the beginning with slight bitterness before coming into a semi-sweet toffee like middle. The finish, in regards to the rest of the beer was actually very refreshing and the mouthfeel was heavy but not overly syrupy. Absolutely adored this beer, a must try."

"O: This is a huge beer with big flavors of roasted malts and an alcohol presence throughout. A hefty 98 IBUs, but I smelled the hops more than I tasted them, personally. If you like massive imperial stouts you will definitely fall in love with this beer. Something nice to slowly sip on all night."

"I'm not a fan of the seasons, I wish it were always Spring and Summer, but Fall and Winter are not all early sunsets, cold mornings and messy commutes.  This is Stout and dark beer season and that is a good thing.  Ten Fidy is a true treat of roasted chocolatey goodness.  The smell is amazing, but not quite as good as the taste.  Lots of roast, chocolate, molasses, coffee and a hop presence that cuts through this like a spotlight on a dark night.  It looks like a glass full of black paint with a nice rich brown head that leads to some very full lacing.  The mouthfeel is thick, just what I want from a stout.  You can tell that there is alcohol, but it's partially hidden behind the rich smoky flavors.  The dark night just got a little warmer.  This is very complex and best of all, very enjoyable."

"Overall (4.25), a fantastic beer and easily the best big, bold russian imperial stout in a can that I've had. This would be a great nightcap to have around the fire after a day of camping and drinking more heat-friendly canned beers in the sun. As the night comes over and the air starts to chill, whip out your can of Ten FIDY, pour it into your metal mess kit cup and sip away by the light of the fire."

"Update 17/3/2015: I was recently able to try the 2013 edition, aged for over a year. Age mellows out the earthy notes, and replaces them with more dark fruit and some metallic tang. This ages well."

"Quite simply the finest stout one can ever hope to come across in this life. Words do not do it justice. So while I can wax poetic about its oil-like pour, the alluring brown head, the notes of chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and what can only be called ambrosia, and the smoothest, richest mouthfeel this side of Kathmandu, I'll refrain, and return to enjoying this true nectar of the gods."

"I recommend drinking it fresh. I had a few cans that were over a year old. With age, the dark fruit takes over the aroma and taste and it becomes a different beer altogether. I prefer the chocolatey awesomeness of a fresh can. Have this beer after a hard day for an immediate delivery of cheer."
"12 oz can poured into a 12 oz Chimay goblet.Pours jet black with a Brown 1 finger head.Smell is chocolate with a hint of coffee.The taste is a thick and rich chocolate with Coffee in the background.I have to say this this a very nice stout.With a 10.5 Abv it has plenty of spirit to help you out when you get home from a hard days work.Give this a try.If your a big stout fan you will love it."

"Overall (4.55): This is a big beer, but not as big as i remembered. I would prefer a little more roasted malt and less bitterness-- that's nitpicking though. At $17 a four pack, i could do better for the price such as Founders. I had very high expectations for this beer, and they were met for the most part, with minor flaws that kept it from being an absolute favorite. Still among the best russian imperial stouts on the market"

"This is my favorite Imperial Stout.  Its appearance is stunning - PITCH black and with a beautiful dark khaki head.  It has a HUGE amount of all the flavors and aromas that you expect from an Imperial Stout - dark chocolate, coffee, earthy hops on the finish.  Ten FIDY balances these flavors extremely well.  What sets this beer apart for me is the mouthfeel and the alcohol burn.  It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel that has no equal in my experience.  The alcohol is hidden by the huge malt bill, but you can feel it burn ever so slightly.  Ten FIDY has absolutely mastered this understated burn; it's tantalizing and entices you to keep sipping it.  I often take 2 or more hours to get through 12 ounces; it's worth it to savor it as long as you can."

"Pours blacker than a banker's heart. Nice, fluffy one-finger tawny brown head. Aroma was phenomenal, with coffee, chocolate, licorice, and dark fruit smells emanating from the glass. The taste is big, with lots of black licorice, coffee, slight cocoa flavor, raisins, with some piney bitterness. The alcohol was also present in the taste, not surprising for a 10.5% beer. The mouthfeel was thick and oily, really lasting on the palate. Overall, this is one of the best RIS out there, and one of my favorite beers."

"As typical with the style, this is a huge beer. Not as complex as something like Alesmith Speedway Stout, but a winner nonetheless and a delite to drink."
"Tidy Fidy pours a black color with a nice large lacing head.  There is a big creamy malty aroma, with big licorice notes.  The taste is the same, creamy, big malt notes, some good black licorice notes.  Nice big and creamy, very thick.  Overall its a very nice sipping heavy stout."

"This beer pours like motor oil, wicked dark, no see through. The taste is pretty pleasing, this is a robust and flavorful stout make no mistake about it that this beer will take over your palette in a very good way. There are definitely noticeable chocolate, coffee and caramel flavors in this beer and they are blended just right. This is a complex beer that drinks very well. The can indicates a 10.5% ABV yet the taste is smooth and slightly sweet,I liken this to a ""velvet hammer"" or a robustly mellow hit to the taste buds, if that's even possible...yes it is! Excellent beer, I will definitely drink it again. If you like stouts it would almost be criminal not to try this one. Two thumbs up as this beer definitely pushes the envelope. The folks in Colorado at Oskar Blues have a winner on their hands, I'll definitely be tossing more of these back...Long Live Ten Fidy Imperial Stout."

"Oooh. Wow this one packs a whollop. Bitterness is beautiful, coming from the alcohol, hops, and burnt malt. Almost purple hugh in the head which sits on a thick black body. The alcohol is hugely present underneath the malted chocolatiness. Dirty hops and molasses. This is incredibly complex. Thick mouthfeel and huge on the hops. I like it."

"Probably the best stout I've ever had.  Fricken awesome pour.  I love how it cascades up like a storm while pouring.  Two finger head that rebuilds after each sip. Dark as night yet not super thick and offensive as some stouts can be.  Tasted it at a brew event last night and out of the at least 20 beers (8 stouts) I tried, this was the best by far.  It kicked my ass and I loved every second of it.  The Oskar Blues rep gave me a generous pour and I went right back for more.  Heavy malty chocolate flavor with a sweet smoke behind it.  Slight hints of dark fruit and hops.  Excellent mouth feel; no sourness or bitterness.  A+ beer all the way.  If you have the chance to try this handcrafted beauty, please your tastebuds and do it!"

"Appearance wise this beer is a black hole.  Light goes in and doesn't come out.  Big dark brown head settles to a cap and laces nicely.  Smell is of roasted grain, dark chocolate, espresso, toffee, oak, and some smokey charred earthiness.  Taste is amazing, so complex.  Big wave of sweet and bitter chocolate, toasted grain, smoke, anise, espresso in the finish and that lingers with an oaky earthy edge.  Creamy and thick as can be, leaves the palate coated.  This is just an amazing stout all the way through.  I enjoyed this one aged exactly one year to the day.  Canned 9/19/13 and drank 9/19/14.  Still one of my favorite beers of all time and a pricey indulgence I'll spend my money on from time to time."

"Overall: This is what an imperial stout should taste like."
"The barrel-aged version is even better but this stout is truly amazing."
"Pours thick and black as they come with a Mocha brown one finger head. Smells like sweet chocolate,  caramel,  and slightly bitter like roasted coffee. The taste begins with an overwhelming creamy, smooth, thick mouthfeel. It tastes slightly nutty and a lot of that sweetness comes through. The finish is a mild roastiness.  This is a fantastic beer. One of the best imperial stouts I've had."

"Another imperial stout.  I have a stout problem.  Pours to a dark solid dark brown, almost dark black cherry.  Full finger of draft brown head.  Aromas of chocolate and coffee.  Smell complex layers malt.  Taste biscuit layers of dark roasted malts.  Chocolate and coffee again.  Good European coffee.  Italian.  Hides the potency and alcohol really well.  Like an American breakfast stout on steroids.  Really clean and smooth.  Like a twenty something year old seriously on his game in a bar.  Can't describe how good this is.  My new favorite imperial stout."

"O: I'm having a hard time processing my thoughts into words right now... I've always held Stone's offering of this style in the highest regard, but I think it has been replaced. I don't know what the folks down at Oskar Blues are doing, but they're doing it right. Every aspect of this brew is so powerful and each flavor is so intense that it borders unbearable, but then it transitions into something new and it just all adds up to a divine experience. I'm simply in awe right now, and slightly sad that I've taken the last sip whilst typing my conclusion... If you haven't had this yet, stop what you're doing right now and buy it."

When I got home I went out to a pub and THERE IT WAS! Since then I discovered you could get it in cans (cans really? Normally I only look at bottles) and although you can't beat tap the cans are still better than whatever is in second. If you like stout as well as other malt drinks there is nothing better than this!"

I saw another review that commented on a great price for these, I beg to differ as they run between $15-$16 a four pack here.. a little steep, but a great brew."

"The appearance is dark and oil like. Rapidly dissolving head. Smell is coffee and roasted malts. Taste is heavenly! First couple of sips are followed quickly by another. Very filling. Aftertaste is a little off but nothing to bad. Mouthfeel ... possibly one of the smoothest stouts I have ever tasted. Possibly smoothest beer overall! Overall the price is high but a great beer for special occasions."

"A thick, fruity and smooth RIS, but I miss some carbonation."

"A very good RIS from Colorado. The first taste, prior to warming up a little bit in the tulip glass had strong notes of chocolate and hints of coffee taste. As it has warmed it has smoothed out. Color is pitch black, as a RIS should be. Good head, almost creamy with a color like chocolate. Overall a very good RIS. This was from a can, and this can had been sitting in the basement on concrete for a few months prior to chilling a little and serving."

"Pours dark black out of the can with a solid head which died down quickly. A bit of lacing around the glass. Nice boozy nose up front with chocolate and roasty malts on the back. Taste is pretty consistent with the smell. A bit of booze with nice dark chocolate and burnt caramel on the finish. Good mouthfeel for a stout. Covers the entire mouth and hangs for quite a bit. Overall a solid beer and even better in a can since I can sneak it onto golf courses.!"

"I'm not sexist BUT THIS BEER IS A MAN's BEER!!! Probably one of the best beers I've ever tasted in a can. This beer here will grow you a full beard and hair on your chest... Good stuff here. I got a four pack and split it 2/2 with a friend. It just took two beers for me to feel nice. I could have a low tolerance but damn. This beer tasted strong.. Well brewed."

"I enjoy a good imperial stout. I like them any time of year, not just fall/winter. This is one of the best out there. The flavor is what it should be, with everything playing well with everything else. Well worth seeking out."
"12 ounce can into snifter, canned on 9/16/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt notes with light-moderate fruitiness; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, raisin, plum, light char, and roast/toasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruitiness; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors and light-moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- I waited to review this until I had my second can. I'm glad that I did because in the interim I read the BA section on proper beer serving temperature. It took me 40 minutes at regular room temp (approx 70) to get this to 50 degrees. It was worth the wait. The first can was enjoyable but served at proper temp, this stout is outstanding."

"This was a very fresh can. Opaque black pour with a small creamy brown head - very pretty - and amazingly thick. Strong, sweet, boozy aromas of chocolate and coffee. Taste is a little boozy (might just be because it was so fresh), sweet and creamy, lots of chocolate and coffee with some vanilla and sweet fruits. The sweet notes are balanced by some bitterness though, making it well-balanced and not overwhelming. Very, very tasty, and one of the thickest stouts I've tried. Definitely a favorite."

"The beer blind won against Founders Imperial, and Stone Russian Imperial was a distant third. I would imagine this beer does wonders with age because the molasses, umami, metallic notes must die down. Truly one of the best beers one may find the shelf."

"O- I have heard great things about this beer and wasn't disappointed. Well done!"

"O - Great beer - especially for the price. A 4-pack in California can be found for roughly $12-$15. You'd expect a 22oz bomber in a glass bottle with this type of quality to come in around that price alone, but you get twice the beer for the same price with a 4-pack of this stuff. Fantastic quality for the value. I look forward to aging a can, and picking up some more."

"O - This was a good can. I've had the occasional bad can which were heavily soy saucy, but a good can of TenFidy is one of the best IS there is period. Hell, even beer's there are period. I'm not sure if the 7 months of age helped it's cause since I never really paid attention on my previous tasting."

"O-Excellent beer. I've been craving a good imperial stout this spring for some reason and this really hits the spot."

""
""
""
"O - Good to finally try the widely lauded Ten Fidy. I'd like to try a fresher batch which hopefully won't be as soy saucy. I'll try this again but in my book Narwhal still reigns supreme amongst shelf imperial stouts."

"Pours a midnight-black color with a medium light-brown head. Pretty good lacing to boot. Thick, creamy, and vicious is how I would describe this brew. My first Oskar Blues beer and I am impressed to say the least. Smells of coffee, vanilla, and maybe dark fruits. Tastes of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and some toffee. A chewy, sticky mouthfeel that is extremely easy to drink and oh so smooth. The ABV is very well hidden yet there is an alcohol burn that's present at the end. Oskar Blues hit this stout right out of the park. I've been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. Became more enjoyable as it warmed and I can't wait to find this stout again. Superb!"

"Overall: A memorable looking stout with a thick, heavy body. The notes of paper/cardboard were not too distracting and were starting to take on some nice nutty chocolate tones not unlike an aged barleywine/old ale. Surprisingly it was boozy and had some residual herbal hop bitterness on the finish."
""
""
""
"COD 1/15/14. Pours used motor oil black with a massive head that has excellent retention and lacing. Mild nose of chocolate, roast and a touch of dark fruit over an alcohol base. Full bodied with a thick creamy texture. Below average carbonation level with no effervescence on the finish. The exceptional flavor profile is complex and balanced. It begins with a blend of chocolate and roast, flows into a touch of smoke and dark fruit then finishes with molasses. The finish is quite smooth and leaves you with a pleasant bite of hop bitterness and alcohol."

"Poured a jet black used oil viscous look. Something to be admired. Aroma is awesome - lots of roast, booze, caramel, chocolate, espresso, toffee, and molasses. Taste is on point with smell. A sweet jar of molasses mixed with espresso, slightly bitter coffee/chocolate, some bourbon, booze and toffee. This one is a real winner. I plan on aging some as well - sounds like it can even improve with age."

"O: Unbelievably good! Don't let the fact that this beer is in a can scare you away. It is amazing. Though the price of the four pack is a bit high, it is worth every penny."
""
""
""
"Pours out pitch black with a thin, brown head. Smells of cane syrup, heavily toasted bread, loads of American hops, booze, and roasted malt. Flavors are a bit more subdued than the aroma, which is good in the case of the alcohol heat. I get much more chocolate and deep roasted malts and a lot less hop character, as well. I get a good bit of fruity esters as well, which gives off some gummy bear quality. Mouthfeel is full and fairly creamy, with a bit of prickliness at the end of each sip. This is a very good stout, but I can't see myself buying 4 packs of this at the price it's going for."
"Drinkability though all considering is better than average because there are things worth exploring in this brew for sure."
""
"Thick and very, very rich, with smoothness that develops in layers but remains constantly creamy. While smoky, woody notes dry it out a little, malts and sweetness keep it semi-dry and a real pleasure to sip. With no indicator of the high alcohol, it would be easy for one to think he or she could drink more of these in a sitting than he or she should."
"Overall: Solid basic Imperial stout. The high abv is not noticeable until it warms up. Not much depth in the flavor which is why I say it's a good basic imperial, but overall it is a decent beer, would buy again but I do have many other favorites ahead of this stout. $14 for 4 pack of cans."

"Poured from a can into a wide mouth glass. Oil-black with a very small head. Smell is a bit smokey and bit of roasted grains. Taste starts with some chocolately sweetness followed by a little hoppy blueberry tartness, or maybe green apple. Mouth was similar to the look, thick and satisfying. A little hoppier than other stouts but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours black, black, black with a thick tan head. Scent is not super strong - coffee and roasted malts. Taste is similar with a touch of cola and bit of alcohol. Texture is pretty sludgy, though there's a suprising bit of carbonation. A really solid beer, though I think you can do just as well for less $$$."
""
"Overall - Good beer. To me this beer is unique. It's not predominantly a chocolate flavored stout which is nice sometimes. Will be buying again."

"Overall? This beer deserves SOME of it hype. Its very well crafted, I love everything about it except a)the price and b)the over apparent presence of alcohol. $16 for a 4 pack? Really? Id rather spend another buck and get 6 Expeditions. Worth a try tho. Its all about the chase, man. Cheers"

"Roasted malt and chocolate! That's what this beer is to my palate. And let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, it is outstanding! 10.5 percent alcohol and it is difficult to taste a single drop of it over the chocolate explosion in my mouth. It's quite essy to see why this is one of the top imperial stouts on the market. Thank you Oskar Blues for deciding to distribute to Minnesota."

"Overall-  Definitely one of the best and unique imperial stouts out there.  Really couldn't offer another example that mimics this flavor profile and quality in which it uses these flavors.  Only thing keeping this from being a higher score for me is the huge emphasis on the roasted malt and the bitterness (almost smokey) it adds. I enjoy that aspect, but I don't love it and there isn't something else really balancing that out.  Overall though, this is must have beer and its worth the somewhat steep price tag."
"The first time I took a wif of this beer, I knew it was special. The color, after pouring it in a snifter, was pitch black with a cocoa head. The taste was strong with malt and chocolate, and I could taste the alcohol on the back end, but it didn't linger as long as I would expect. Definitely one of my favorites. Bought a case of it after the first tasting... Cheers"

"I love this beer. Dark and beautiful with a dark cocoa head. The head dissipates to good dark lacing. The smell is toast and roast with very slight raisinets. The taste is fruity like a plump raisin with a little cherry, roast barley comes thru with a good cocoa and it finishes sorta tart. Great taste balance good abv but its really hard to detect. Clean and lingers in the mouth and makes you want to keep hitting it!"

"A formidable Imperial stout. Can't remember having a much better one in this style"
""
""

"Pours black as motor oil, easily one of the darkest stouts I have ever seen. Thick brown head that lingers for a while with great lacing. Rich chocolate malt and dark roast coffee on the nose. Chocolate and coffee dominate the palate with some hop bitterness on the back end. Some warm alcohol as well. Full bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is no lightweight. One of the finest Russian Imperials out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Motor oil dark pour. Wow! From a can no less. Looks very enticing with about a finger of dark caramel colored head. I smell roasted malt and dark fruit. Taste is awesome with that roasted malt and chocolate caramel. This is 10.5% ABV but I don't detect the alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, not sticky. An outstanding stout!"
""
""
""

""
""
""

""

"Pour out of a 12oz can into a short glass (drank in two servings). The beer poured a deep dark black color with some thickness (although I remembered it being a bit thicker in previous tastings) with a small about of drank brown lacing that dissipates very quickly. The aroma is of dark fruits, rich dark chocolates, espresso, and roasted malts. The taste, which mirrors the marvelous smell, is extremely satisfying with it's complex mixture of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, dark fruits, toffee, and even a subtle hints of mocha and sweet chocolate. Rich and full flavored from first to last sip. I am extremely found of this beer, haven't had it and sometime but it is just as good now as it was the first time I had it. Great beer from beginning to end."
""
""
"Overall, a really well-rounded stout, deeply imbued with those bitter-sweet flavors we love. Alcohol is almost nowhere to be found. Only in a slight, lingering cool after-vapor is it maybe perceptible. Very impressive for a 10.5% brew. This one might have just dethroned Expedition as my favorite non-barrel-aged stout, and even gives BCBS a good run for its money."

"Again, I can't speak highly enough of Ten FIDY. Sure, there may be people who do not like this beer, but they can't say it's because this is a poor example of the style. It's an excellent American version of a Russian Imperial Stout. More, please."

"This ones for roosty and it's been sitting in the fridge eyeing me off for a while and pours a nice jet black hue with a creamy two finger head and lacing all over the place quite the looker,the smell is tobacco,dark chocolate,rum and a boozy herbalness,the feel is full bodied with light carbonation and has tastes of dark fruity chocolate,milky coffee,roasted malts and finished with a sticky pudding sweet boozy dryness that makes you want more and more and overall definately a beer every beer nerd has to try cheers."

Taste%3A Up front it's coffee which moves to malt and finished boozey. The mouth feel is perfect. I get hints of coffee%2C hazelnut%2C malt%2C chocolate%2C and alcohol. This is in my top 3 stouts I've ever had. Right up there with Stone's Russian stout. It is absolutely a must try"

"O- Ten Fidy lives up to its reputation. Truly a top notch Stout. A big beer but not over powering with its 10.5 abv."

"O- Big time appearance, aroma, and initial flavor wave left me expecting more from the finish. But admittedly, the bar was set extremely high. Overall, an outstanding beer."
""
""
"Overall, this is an audacious imperial stout that takes no prisoners. The presentation and viscosity are exemplary, but it's a little heavy-handed in the taste department, even for me. There's no shortage of traditional RIS flavors (which are nearly on steroids), but it could do with a touch of nuance and complexity. If you're looking for a milkshake-thick imperial stout that will punch you in the face, look no further."

"Had my second set of Ten Fiddy's for the year ..... ITS BACK  LOVING IT"
"O - This beer is one of the best stouts that I have ever tried. It adds more depth then other great imperial stouts and delivers in more then one. Definitely one to try even with a $4 price tag. Highly recommended for stout lovers, Cheers!"

"Oskar Blues was new to our area, and after reading the reviews on this page, I had to pick some up. Between Ten Fiddy, G'Knight, and Deviant Dales I have to say they are a pretty solid brewery. And I love that they come in cans and I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever poured a true heavy duty stout from a can. Ten Fidy pours pure opaque black with just some hints of orange tinge on the edges. Very thin khaki head that quickly dissipates to a thin halo around the edge of the glass. Smell is mostly dark chocolate, mocha, brown sugar and fairly mild as stouts go. Taste is fantastic! Pretty straightforward, chocolate and brown sugar up front, with toasted coffee and malts finishing it off. The coffee really lingers which is great. No booze what so ever. Mouthfeel is creamy, but lighter than most RISs or heavy stouts, and the higher than average carbonation really brings to life the bitter of the coffee and keeps the sweetness subdued. Overall, supremely drinkable and a very solid stout. Not too sweet, some good alcohol warmth in the gut, great coffee flavor, and no metallic hints even poured from a can. Very, very good!"

"overall; an excellent stout, lots of flavor but they are well balanced, and no aspect of the tastes overwhelm the others, but they sing together instead. all in all a wonderful experience, and would definitely something i would buy again when I'm willing to pay top dollar."
""
""
""
"Overall, the number of reviews and overall score for this beer should tell you all you need to know. It took me a long time to get around to it, mainly because it's not available where I live (I ordered it online in accordance with a free shipping deal) but now that I have it, I feel like one of the missing puzzle pieces in my life has fallen into place. This is an absolute benchmark of the style. The flavors and textures are so powerful, so in-your-face, yet so expertly layered... it's near perfect. If a bourbon barreled version of this exists... its power... I don't even want to think about it."
""
""
"I feel let down by this Holy grail stout. Dissapointed. Sad. Oh well. Oskar blues needs to tweak this one. Too fruit/ester/off flavor-y for me. Oh well."
"O: Fantastic offering for the style. A little sweeter and boozier than some, but in a good way."
""
"Whoa. Now I know why I paid 15 bones for a 4 pack! This should define the term, ‘Imperial Stout’. Just, wow. I’m finding it hard to criticize this beer…"

"Good Googalee-Moogalee, this sh*t is incredible! Deep black pour into a chilled pint glass. Thin beige head, lots of tiny bubbles, and nice even lacing which recedes rather quickly. The smell is a beautiful nose of roasted chocolate and coffee. On the palate, the alcohol is omnipresent, but is nicely by the malty mouthful of toffee, caramel, butterscotch, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is full and lingering, almost chewy. Overall, this is one of the best -- if not THEE best -- stouts I've ever had the good fortune to experience. Don't miss it!"

"Midnight black in color with a fine minimalist cap of beige colored foam. Complex,but inviting sweet aroma of figs,plums,and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is silky smooth,but there is definitely an alcoholic presence! The flavor is more on the sweet side with fig and plum notes and then a bit of bitterness from the roasted barley. I still cannot believe this came out of a can! Taste improves with warming. Much mor roasted barley comes to the forefront."
""
"O: I was weary of the steep asking price for a 4-pack but after having a can, I wholeheartedly and confidently recommend this OB offering. The roasted, slightly boozy nose, the rich dark chocolately taste and the robust mouthfeel make this perfect for a chilly night by the fireplace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My favorite beer to date. This beats all of the yetis I've had, backwoods bastard, Samuel smith's Russian imperial stout, Founder's breakfast stout and so on. Worth the 4$/ can without a doubt."

"Rating: 10.0"

""
""
""
""
"O: I've had this beer a while ago when I was first getting into beer. Now that I've had it again when I know what a good beer is, I can see why this one is so revered. I expected a simple stout with a one-dimensional flavor profile, but this beer is very complex. The price is the only thing that bothers me. I'd give it a 100 no doubt."
""
"O: A beer to seek out if you have never had it. Otherwise, not a top beer in the style, but very good. For the price of it, there are much better options to find. Possibly the best part of the brew is the ""SHOW ME YO FIDDY'S"" on the bottom of the can."
"O: A sweet, velvety, and downright drinkable stout. Now, while it’s not exactly complex, Ten FIDY is enjoyable and wonderfully accessible – I can’t imagine someone sipping this with a sour face."
""
""
""
""
"Might be a bad batch, but it has way too intense acetyl aldehyde flavor. Tastes like green apple in a bad way. I also aged a can and it's still not very good. I didn't want to drink it."

"buy it if you see it!"
"12oz / Snifter / Victoria Gastro Pub, Columbia, MD"
""
"Thick black pour with minimal lacing and no head. Chocolate fudge, chocolate syrup, molasses, a big deep roast and a bit of soy sauce. Sweet but not overly so. There is a touch of astringent bitterness on the finish that becomes more apparent as the beer warms up. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel but not cloying. It's carried by a perfect effervescent carbonation. Overall, quite nice."
""
""
"This is an excellent RIS, however, for the money, Bells Expedition, Founders and Great Lakes are better and cheaper. Recommended."

"taste - holy cow. this improved so much over time, not sure if it was a different recipe or the aging but 2008 was absolutely fantastic. more sweetness involved but still very boozy and syrupy. was my favorite of the fest. all I can say is that it tastes like a sweeter MUCH more balanced Ten Fidy."

""
"12oz can with 9-24-12 and ""Haulin' Oats"" stamped on the bottom of the can. Pours a super viscous dark black color with an inch of dark brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, caramel, and hints of vanilla. The taste is chocolatey booze upfront followed by some roasted malts and more chocolate. Notes of coffee and earth. Hints of caramel. Bitter dark chocolate and malts at the end. Good amount of alcohol flavor throughout, but time has mellowed it a bit. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, classic beer worth seeking out."

""
""
""
"I'll split the difference and say Ten Fidy is quite drinkable with loads of good sweet chocolate, espresso, burnt/roasted barley notes -- and the 10.5% ABV is no joke. i'm definitely going to enjoy the second half of my 4-pack. (and bonus points for selling this in 12 oz. form -- a bomber of these things is always pushing it for me, so I love the 12 oz. can serving ... perfect!)"

"Really like this big stout, from a can nonetheless. A bit pricey but worth it in my opinion. Haven't really taken to BBA stouts yet, so this is my go to stout. Beats old raspy which I had for the first time last night because its smoother and more mellowed out to me."

"I was in Boulder at the Liquor Mart back in ""07"" and Oskar Blues was there doing a beer tasting. They said to me ""would you like to try some local craft beer""? I said ""no thanks, I don't like canned beer"". Their response was ""These cans are made by Ball Areospace and have a polymer liner. Light and oxygen are harmful to beer, and you can take it with you when camping""! I was impressed so I had a taste. I did not think I liked stout until I tried Ten FIDY."
""
""
""
"O- Man this thing is good. Possibly my new favorite Imperial stout, sorry Old Raspy and Expo, will have to drink the other 3 to know for sure. Took forever to get this stuff in my area and finally got it. While this is one of the more expensive non-BA stouts out there, it is quite worth it and I prefer it to some of the BA stouts I've had."
""
""
""

"O - Very solid stout. Best stout I have had from a can."
""
"Overall: This beer is an experience. Incredibly complex and balanced. No doubt the best Stout I've ever had. Now, I'm going to age a couple over the next few years to see what happens. This one will be a regular for me."
"Typical for the style, but I was hoping for more with one year of age on it"
""
"O - I first had this over summer and it was great, but I couldn't drink it in warm weather. Now that the temps are dropping in NH I'll be drinking this regularly."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the most drinkable 10.5% RIS I've ever had. This is pretty good, and I would definitely like to have another on a cold winter night."
"O - Was reluctant to buy due to the high price tag but after hearing so many good things about it I had to try it and I'm glad I did. Not necessarily something I would purchase again with so many equally good RIS options, but definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One crazily drinkable (maybe it's just the can, vs. a bomber), and enjoyable RIS. The chocolate and more standard malt interplay is civil and agreeable, benefiting all. And the alcohol, how about that - 21-proof, and barely a tic. All in all, one of the best, and certainly most balanced versions of the style that I have yet to encounter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a very good example of the style, it was pretty spot on for the style with none of the aspects seeming out of place and there was some really nice balance and just enough complexity. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth for the style, clean, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, this might be one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had, I could get in some trouble with this beer since I don't think it would be pretty easy for me to drink a few of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it may be the best mouthfeel I have encountered in an RIS and it has everything that I would want in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change. I would for sure buy this beer again, I will be picking up some more next time I go to the store so I can throw some in the cellar and see how it develops over time, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. I would for sure recommend this to anyone who likes the style, this is a pretty great example of an RIS. All in all i was very happy with this beer and I think it's safe to say it lived up to my expectations. I still think Founders Imperial Stout is my favorite RIS, but I think this one is close to be as good and I would say it's up there as one of the better RIS's I have had. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer and this is another beer that I will anticipate the release of, keep up the good work guys. This is now my favorite Oskar Blues beer."

"Standing in front of the poured glass on the counter, I could clearly smell the strong aromas. It's just so wonderful. Rich. Heavy. Chocolate. Dark chocolate. Roasted. Mature. Thorough. Molasses. Thick. Rest well on palette. Aftertaste lingers. Worth every single penny."
""
"Overall one of the better RIS I've had. Three more cans sitting in my cellar, this should really be something in a year or two"

"Big dark chocolate, brown sugar and alcohol on the nose. Pours black as spent motor oil with a creamy, dark brown head. More dark chocolate and brown sugar on the front of the tongue. Extremely thick, coating mouthfeel. Long-pulled espresso bitterness gives way to slightly overwhelming alcohol on the back end. Nice warming effect, but a touch too booze-forward for my taste."

"SImply put, this is one of the best beers I've ever had - any style, bar none. IT pours motor oil black with a thick creamy head. Taste is chocolate, coffee, with plenty of hop bitterness. The best that Oskar Blues makes, and they make several excellent offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will drink this forever. In the world of craft beer where there are thousands to try, I normally don't buy many over and over again. However, Ten Fidy is my baby. The mouthfeel is perfect. Only problem now is most other stouts seem thin to me. I gave a 4.75 for taste because although I love it, it could have had just a tad less hop bitterness for me. Buy, smell, drink, enjoy, REPEAT!"

"10.50% alcohol - Ten Fidy. Get it? I have loved this beer for years but only recently got the joke - and that was only when a buddy of mine pointed it out. Pours like motor oil, tastes like heaven. Ten Fidy stands out in so many ways: the beautiful black can, the nearly complete lack of carbonation, the amazing flavor that effectively hides the 10.50% alcohol. Like many imperial stouts, I always get a hint of cherry on the finish of this one. The only knock I have is this: while this is my favorite imperial stout, I'm completely terrified of aging it because of the packaging. I've never gotten a good answer on how cans hold up over time."
""
"Can and on tap numerous times. Pours an opaque black with a deep tan, one finger head that has good retention and leaves some good lacing. Aroma is black licorice, cherry Twizzlers, maple and brown sugar oatmeal. Taste upfront is oily and velvety on the palate with chocolate milk, espresso gelato but then goes to dry, bittering hops and ends with a long, dry, roasted barley and raw cocoa finish. Not a super outstanding impy but the best RIS on the planet that comes out of a can so that deserves some bonus points."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick oily black with a two finger mocha colored head that fades fairly slowly. Smell is roasted malts, coffee and a little chocolate, nose isn't very strong. Taste is expresso with a little dark chocolate and a hint of bourbon? Mouthfeel is full with a lower amount of carbonation. Nice and creamy and very smooth. Overall a great stout just wish there with a little more nose."
""
"O: Don't even bother drinking this beer cold. Let it warm then let it WOW you. What a great offering from Oskar Blues. I'd love to try one fresh. Thank goodness they've opened up a brewery on the East Coast. In North Carolina, no less. Looking forward to my next visit to Brawley's."
""
""
"O. Amazing brew. I had it with food, I felt like a King. A little pricey though, 15 bucks. But worth the money. I would consider this one of the best stouts I have ever had. If your are hesitant to shell out the cash for this brew. Just remember you pay more at the pub for four beers that will never be of this quality. Respect the beer."

"O: Fantastic brew! Heard great things about this one and it's one of the few brews to love up to its hype! A lot of breweries put coffe or BA a stout like this but it's great to see a stout stand up by itself and knock it out of the park! Great beer! Must try!"

"The beer pours a very vigorous head that is a dark brown color resembling that of cocoa. The beer itself is an opaque black with dark brown notes. The beer has a very roasty smell with hints of dark chocolate sweetness to it. The beer also has a cocoa note that mixes well with the roast and dark chocolate sweetness. The beer taste is very roasted with cocoa and bit of dark chocolate swimming underneath of all the other notes. The aftertaste is very bitter, which is similar to the rest of the beer. Additionally, the earthy hops also make an appearance to offset the malts, cocoa, and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with some biting carbonation. While it is smooth, the beer also has a bit of texture to it as well. Overall, a fantastic beer that I come back to every winter and it still hasn't lost its appeal."

"O - Best imperial stout I've ever had, hands down. While I enjoy a lot of imperial stouts, I usually can't handle more than one glass at a time. I could drink this stuff all night. Well, until I pass out from the 10.5% alcohol that is."

"O - Wow, caught the nose from 2 feet away! Mouth is outstanding - everything you'd want in a delicious stout. Taste briefly starts sweet but quickly transitions into a dry carmel/ almost a dark chocolate flavor - very very good. Love the thickness. Balance of flavors is awesome."

"UPDATE 12/21/13: After being a bit intimidated by my underwhelming experience with my first Ten Fidy, I finally had a second and it was much more enjoyable. I have also had several more RIS's for comparison since this initial review. and it has added to my appreciation of the style. Based on this I am raising the original ratings, which were t: 3.75, m: 3.5, o: 3.75."

"The second I cracked the can it smelt like coffee. With that coffee forward smell there was a certain sweetness to it also that overtook the metallic smell of the can. The appearance was like motor oil, with hardly any head. What the head did compose of was dark bubbles with more of an aroma of coffee. The first sip gave me a roast forward taste followed by notes of chocolate. Mouthfeel on it was quite amazing too, which was very very sludgy. Overall it was a very good beer and I love me some Ten Fidy!"

"Overall this is really nice. Being the first RIS I've had out of a can I will say I'm impressed. Lots of flavor and complex. Not the best I've ever had, and at $18 a 4-pack it is a little disappointing, but still very good. Worth checking out, but maybe only buy one"

"O: This is a great stout and it is a steal at its price, abv, and convenience (since it is in a can). I wonder how this tastes with a bit of aging. I don't see too much changing, since it isn't too complex and the alcohol is very subtle and seems a part of the flavor profile."

"Holy how do you do! It tastes great! Mouthfeel is velvety and thick, creamy and smooth. Bit of alcohol on the palate, dark chocolate, nice and sweet. Toffee malt, a little grainy, a little sugary, coffee, a bit of dark fruit . There is a tiny bit of hop bitterness and roast and just enough booze to make you want more. I really love this and would say that of all the stouts I have tried some of them drink a little hard. Not this. This is elegant, aromatic and full. Superb."

"O: Very impressed. One of my favorite imperial stouts, and my favorite imperial stout I've had from a can. I was a little worried by how syrupy the beer looked at first when I opened it, but this is a fantastic beer. My only worry is that, at ~$5/can, it's going to lose out due to being twice the price of Old Rasputin. It's also a bit more expensive than Stone IRS, but I believe this is the better beer."

"Can to snifter-hybrid. Pours a used engine oil brown with just a small dark toffee colored head that doesn't hang around for long. A quick swirl coats the sides of my glass. As expected from an imperial stout, the aroma has a powerful roasted malt character with a significant backbone of dark chocolate and just enough alcohol to let you know this beer isn't effing around. The taste backs up the smell and then some. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, a hint of alcohol, a moderate sweetness, and just enough hops to balance it all out. Ten Fidy is heavy but not too much so. It's a thick velvety liquid that coats my mouth like fine grade A maple syrup. As the first sip touched my lips my stubble grew to a beard that would make a Viking blush, my wife became instantly 6 months pregnant, my enemies felt a chill run up their spines, and a battle ax appeared before me. This is a mans beer. On the can a message reads, ""this dog'll hunt."" And it will."

"This one is as good as its rep. It poors up a gorgeous black with a 2 finger mocha head, not much in the way of retention, not much lacing. The nose is very sweet and malty, some soy sauce, and chocolate. Taste is complex. I detected notes of cola, licorice, roasted nuts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and just the smallest hint of alcohol, mostly being well hid. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy. This is now my favorite RIS, even better than Ol' Raspy."
"Overall, I loved it. I really hope that they're starting to distribute here in MI. The price tag is the only bad thing about it, but I would certainly splurge every now and then."

""
"Simply divine stout- what an imperial Russian should be, in my opinion. Ive had the pleasure of getting my hands on a 2010 1050 in the can and it was even smoother, silkier than a more recent vintage. Gets better with age. Delicious cold or room temp, flat or spirited. It is simply- honestly, the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I worship this particular beer because it has earned all of my praise and these accolades. The pinnacle of the art form, at least in the world of stouts."

"Overall: My first Imperial Stout from a can, and it is an exceptionally good beer in every way."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: An old can, set aside since 2009, yields a Ten Fidy experience worthy of the praise that led me to buy the pricey 4-pack in the first place. While this beer was found to be chokingly laden with shoyu qualities when it was young, it wears its maturity well in its fourth year. The heavy-handedness of its origins will never fade entirely, but this sample's profile falls well within the accepted--if not preferred--parameters of the style. Surprisingly good, compared to the last encounter."
"Overall a great can of stout. An good value at about $10/4. Also I find this beer to drink best with a little age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
"What an excellent imperial stout. May take the place as my new favorite russian imperial stout, I will have to do a blind side-by-side with founder's imperial stout. Reminds me of a non-ba version of bcbs. Recommendable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: To me, this is very much what I'm looking for in an imperial stout. The sweeter notes fit well with my tastes and makes for a very enjoyable beer. This is personally one of my favorites, and I try to always keep some on hand. It is a little on the pricier side at $15 for a 4 pack in my area, but in my mind it's well worth the price. I would highly recommend trying this one."

"Pours pitch black out of the can, big dark mocha head - fantastic looking beer. The smell is huge - bitter dark chocolate and coffee, and a nearly dominating grapefruit and pine hop character. Some chocolate covered tart cherries as well - serve as the middle man between the coffee/chocolate and hops. Taste is incredible - full and vibrant. Dark roast coffee beans, chocolate, hop bite, burnt caramel. Very bitter and sweet beer, in fact. Amazing, super delicious stuff."

It definitely holds up to any other RIS on the market. And its really nice to know that I can pick this off the shelf anytime, anywhere in WI. I plan to get some more tomorrow. (4)"

"O: i've been reading and hearing about this beer for awhile, so imagine my delight when i scored some cans while in TN recently. this is my favorite RIS to date. reminds me of an old sign that was posted outside a diner in camden, maine: no ferns, no quiche. downhome, downeast. this is just a solid, well done stout that i'll be sure to savor on special occasions . . . like a wednesday in march, damn it. Well done Oskar Blues. Well done."
"Smell is great. Taste is dark and is very balanced between coffee, normal stout flavors, and a hint of sweet/chocolate. Incredibly smooth. Easy to drink a lot. Hits pretty hard with the high ABV. One of the better Stouts I've ever had (and Stouts are my favorite type of beers)! Only thing better I've had so far is Founders CBS + KBS, Bolt Cutter, and maybe 1 or 2 others I can't remember off the top of my head. It's REALLY GOOD! But the one thing I noticed is that it doesn't have anything unique or that stands out, just really really solid, smooth, great tasting stout! Get SOME!!!"

"O: Not bad at all ! If you are a fan of Russian imperial stouts you'll like this brew and again it won't let you down. Favorite thing about this one is at 10.5 the alcohol taste is well hidden. Least happy about what I paid for it though. Better and cheaper out there for this style."

""
""
""
""
"Overall - good smooth mellow imperial stout that I would definitely recommend. It non offensive, to the first time stout drinkers, to get them kind of into stouts."
"Overall-first things first, for 4 beers your looking at spending 14 bucks. A little math and that comes too $3.50 a can. It's a little pricey. Okay with that out of the way, with this beer you get one of the smoothest imperial stouts you will drink. You will also get one of the best can beers available as well. If there is ever a session RIS this is it. So if you don't mind the price this has Saturday night written all over it. 4.75"

"This one's been in my cellar for a little over a year. Thick, pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head that fades quickly with great lacing. Roasty malts dominate the nose along with hints of chocolate, mocha, coffee, and some subtle dark fruit. The taste follows suit with loads of roasty malt, milk chocolate, and espresso along with hints of toffee, molasses, cocoa, and just a touch of licorice on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick, and chewy with a nice bitter finish. Overall this has to be one of the best readily available Imperial Stouts on the market today."
""
"Pretty bitter roasted, maybe burnt in places, malt flavor from front to back. Warm oily palate. Bitter dark chocolate finish for sure. Good sipping beer, but not as good as the hype in my opinion."

"O-Having had Old Raspy and Narwhal recently, I was curious to see how Ten Fidy would hold up (especially against Narwhal, which I thought was a great brew). The canned beer does just fine, thank you. The flavors here are complex, the heat is nicely integrated, the appearance is right, and the feel is a great match. The only let-down (and I use that term loosely) is the smell. The nose just doesn't match the rest of the beer."
"If you are fortunate enough to have Ten Fidy in a nearby store, please send some this way! Why did I only buy one can?"

"O - This a big bold beer full of roasty flavors, thick body, and high ABV. One of the best imperial stouts available for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out so black and thick that it literally looks like used oil. Soft pour in the center of my glass leaves a half finger dark brown mocha head that doesn't stick around long. Smells like a typical imperial stout, dark malts come through most. Slight alcohol burn on the tongue but its nice. I don't see much difference in this can with 7 months on it than fresh which I had many times. Overall this is my go to Imperial Stout, to me it doesn't get much better than this for the style."
""
"Overall: Glad I got to try this. Not my fav imp by any means but it's a quality beer."
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown, with a diminutive light mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. If the head was a bit larger, and I tried to create that with my pour, and long-lasting, this would have been an extraordinarily gorgeous beer. As it is, it's just really, really sexy. The nose is huge chocolate with some British yeast notes wafting at times. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous. It dries out like Baker's chocolate at the finish. There's also a bit of carbonation bite that occurs late. The flavor is a bit lacking. There's definitely some dark cholcolate, a bit of lactose, and some tart cherry that emerges in the middle and lingers after all else has passed. Some coffee bitterness is also noted after the beer has been swallowed. This is a very good RIS, but not as good as, say, Old Rasputin."
"My only complaint about it is that at around 5 bucks a can...it's pretty steep but at 10.5 abv you don't need all that many to have a good night."
""
""
""
"All I can say is wow.... it poured a very dark/black colour with no head whatsoever. The combination of flavors was very good with hints of chocolate and espresso in it. There was some sweetness on the tailend of the beer but it was not as bad as other imperial stouts I have tried. Overall an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark and thick...pitch black beneath a squat, brown head. Deep, dark chocolate, heavy roast, sweetened coffee, syrupy molasses, and a touch of oxidation in the nose; all very nicely melded into one heavy, yet not overpowering aroma. Big, malty, chocolate-forward flavor...dark cocoa, toasted caramel, subtle vanilla, bread, and some coffee bitterness. Purply berries, raisins, vinous notes, and hint of port in the end. Properly viscous and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and bitterness to keep things lively, but not get in the way. Not so rich that it loses it's appeal after six ounces either, nor is the alcohol ever readily apparent. Very good..."

""
""
""
""

"Very complex brew. Roast malt and dark fruit are in good balance. Not overly sweet or boozy. Just enough chocolate to accentuate the sweetness and detract from the roast bitterness."

""
"Pours a dark brown, not quite black with a thick finger and a half of fluffy tan head. Surprisingly, there is little retention in the head and only a trace of lacing on the glass. Nice roast in the nose and a modest sweet note as well. Stout bitterness combines with the smooth and silky body of a classic RIS. There is definitely some mild chocolate notes present as well as a hint of raisins and other dark fruits. The finish is roasty and bitter with only a trace of alcohol present. This is a complex offering that hides its powerful 10.50% ABV very well. Tasty and dangerous!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"WOW!!! Poured black as tar with a beautiful two-finger milk chocolate head, which receded quickly. Smells of sweet malt and a bit of chocolate. Taste is fairly complex, much like the aroma. Subtle chocolate, some molasses, maybe pumpkin skin bitterness. Not as extreme as BCBS and such, but definitely not a “standard” stout. Nice medium mouthfeel for a stout, but somewhat creamy. Very balanced…a real winner."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth malty syrup. Carbonation is just right. Overall.... all I can say is just wow, this beer really lives up to the hype. By far the best Imperial stout I've had in this price range so far. I'm sure it's not the best in the world, but I picked up a 4 pack for $13. So it get's my vote based on value. Once again, well done oskar blues, well done."

"This is a damn fine example of an imperial stout. It has no fancy additives or gimmicks. It is just a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is good. Dark and intimidating appearance. Fair head, but no lacing. Nose is a collection of coffee, chocolate, and molasses. Flavor even more so, a great combination of coffee, malt, sweet and bitter notes. Very well-balanced. Heavy alcohol content is deceiving. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"O: If you can try it, do so. It's cheep and absolutely delicious. One of the best values out there, too."
""
""
"O- One of my favorite beers, period. This is what I look forward to after a long day! I have never been disappointed by anything from Oscar Blues."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black pour with quickly receding brown head. Smells so chocolatey! Some sweet lactose smell with it. Big chocolate flavor with creamy mouthfeel, fading into a bitter finish with a bit of black currant. This is incredibly smooth and beautifully thick. I get so much chocolate and roast from this with just the perfect sweetness. Very nice, and from a can!"
""
"Just a great beer all around. This is easily one of the best widely-available big ABV stouts, and certainly the best one in a can. Dare I say, it's worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, pretty good especially for a stout that can be found everyday."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one I pick up every so often (you do pay a premium). While I really like licorice in the form of the candy, I never enjoy that flavor profile so much when it's part of a beer...but Ten Fidy is the exception for me, as the variety of other flavors complement the anise aspect so it doesn't overpower. That make this a greatly unique imperial stout."
""
"O: Wow – excellent imperial stout. Great flavors and aromas."

"Overall (4.25): This is a great beer—and imperial stout that’s full-bodied, full-flavored, and still something of a crowd pleaser. I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in getting into the style, because it’s not too sweet or syrupy but it’s also not so distastefully charred and bitter as some can be. But the earthiness mentioned above, which is like the intersection of the chocolate flavor and the hop component of the beer, is what really gets me—it adds a very nice depth to the experience. Really, really tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic beer, my favorite from Oskar Blues. Huge beer, probably the best canned beer available ATM that is a staple in my house. Big huge smooth creamy chocolate/coffee bomb."
""
""

"WOW TEN FIDY is the best beer ever, can not get enough of this great beer. This is worth every penny."

""
"I really should be picking these up more often."
""
"This is one of the greats. Simple as that. Black liquid, dense brown head that leaves sticky spots and streaks. Smell is Godiva meets Starbucks. Taste is as good as it gets with a huge chocolate front that is followed by a heavy roasted grain coffee finish. Hops are plentiful but because of the huge sweetness of the malt they are balanced to the point of playing second fiddle leading into a coffee like finish. The wonderful blend of dark and chocolate malts just lays the floor on this one. A touch of licorice. Finish is surprisingly clean and dry with an extra bold coffee taste lingering. A touch of grapefruit skin as well. Feel is smooth and chewy while remaining light enough to drink way to fast. Satin on the tongue with a perfect and subtle carbonation. One of the best RIS I've ever had. No barrel needed, just vision and expert brewing. WOW!"
""
""
"Overall, this is an impressive impy stout. I've been looking forward to getting this one, and being near the Ohio border over break provided the opportunity to go get it. Nothing is too out of the ordinary as far as flavor goes, but the weight and feel of this one is pretty good. The only small drawback is the alcohol heat in the back of the throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this for the first time last night. It was nothing short of amazing. It had an amazing texture, very smooth and velvety, without being overly viscous. The flavor was intense, without being overly rich. That being said I tend to avoid stouts due to the aftermath, but please give me more!"
""
"O: I am by no means a stout expert and got this based on its reviews here...however if this is at all representative of the fine Russian Imperial type I am sold!! Definitely a ""dessert beer"" This one could catch up with you! Left me with a warm feeling"
"Overall: One of my favorite imperial stouts that I've trie thus far. Very drinkable for 10%, great beer for after dinner to appreciate all of the complex flavors of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is seriously black in color with a wispy dark tan head. Aroma is roasty. Lots of sweet chocolate, somewhat creamy, milky. No presence of alcohol burn. Taste is just as roasty as the aroma. Like burnt chocolate underneath milk chocolate. I get a little alcohol presence, a bit harsh before fading quickly. Some burnt toast follows with dark chocolate. This thing is seriously chocolatey. There is just enough hops to bitter out the dark chocolate: they work in tandem. Great finish, slightly dry. No wonder this is so highly rated. I only hope the carbonation is similar out of a can."
"o: Overall, an excellent russian imperial stout. The taste itself doesn't betray the 10.5% ABV that its name does. The flavor doesn't seem as complex as a North Coast Old Rasputin, which I had recently, or as distinctive. Still an excellent winter beer."
""
""
"Highly enjoyable brew here. Could sip it all day. Went well with a chocolate chip cookie I broke out towards the end of the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall experience is a stout lover's dream. Be ready for a robust, extremely flavorful and significant brew. This is not one of those sneaky, ""deceptively strong"" beers. Ten Fidy makes no excuses for its hugeness...never hiding anything, starts and remains delicious throughout. Imperial, indeed!"
"Overall- mmm, good. Drinks like a meal, but I still want another one for dessert."
""
""
""
"O- Certainly one of the finest RIS's I've ever had. Will seek this one out."
"Overall this is an excellent beer, the mouth feel is spot on and the abv is undetectable. I'm not sure about the price though, about double that of old rasputin."

""
""
""
"Overall - This is a fantastic beer in every respect. One of the best stouts I have ever had. The taste is just decadent and defines excess in every sense. Everything you could ask for in a beer from the malt bill to the hops and the rich chocolate. This is a beer to be treasured and not ignored, simply because it comes from a can. Most likely the best stout on the market that is available year round"
""

""
""
"The aroma is very vibrant, with wonderful dark fruits, such as raisins, dark chocolate, fresh coffee, grains, and smokiness. There is a zesty hint of some sort of citrus fruit tucked away in there somewhere, too. Now for the first sip... after a big mouthful I pause to take in just how rich and overwhelming this is! It's like a mouthful of devil's food cake. I actually pick up very sweet cherries initially, before the roasted, doughy chocolate and espresso flavors wash over it. Still, in the finish the cherries and bittersweet hops sneak out for a second. As the beer coats my mouth and goes down, it is very warming with the alcohol presence very apparent. Although being full-bodied is an understatement here as well, I can't put it down. One of the best stouts I've ever had. Not for those who are intimidated by very big beers."

I'm in CA so coming across such a gem come rare unless paying premium at a bar, which is worth whatever price at any bar just to try. Great great beer. And it come in a CAN!"
"10% abv and a nicely hidden 98 IBU complete this as a winner. I love hops and Whoppers and I'm glad i pulled the trigger on this one. 4 pk apx $15 could make this an every now and then. Some say way to hyped, but I'm sassified . Will purchase again."
""
"Notes: Thanks to Oskar Blues for finally distributing to Ohio. I had to travel to Atlanta before now to find this. Now it is at my favorite bottle shop!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall: at face value, I enjoy this. I have to say that I'd take Old Raspy 10/10 times over Ten Fidy, especially for the price. I would like to try this on nitro at some point."

"Overall: A really great Imperial Stout. Very rich and has a good balance of roasty bitterness and sweetness."
"i've heard a lot of great things about this beer.. it's good, but i've had way better. it's a little too bitter/burnt tasting for my liking. the body is perfect, and the abv is masked well. maybe some aging will do this one justice. i'll save the other 3 cans for a later ""use"""

"This imperial stout is one that deserves recognition. I poured this from a can into a tulip shaped beer glass. Color is very black and the consistency is thick and heavy. It smells like dried fruits with toasted dark coffee beans mixed together. It is a bit alcoholic tasting, but not overwhelming. When I first sipped this beer, I was immediately reminded of my love for imperial stouts. Oscar Blues did a awesome job with this one. If you see this beer in your area, I highly recommend sampling it!!"

"Fantastic beer. I actually like it better fresh than aged. The flavors are much more present, melded, and explosive when fresh. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't know that it's worth the hefty price, but it's a unique imperial stout in the least. Too much of that bitter anise / black liquorice flavor dominates much of the flavor profile. If I were looking for that, I'd grab a glass of absinthe; Lord knows I've had enough in my time. It's not undrinkable, and I appreciate it's originality, but all-in-all it's not what I look for in an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The complexity here is wonderful - I love the flavors here, there is so much going on. However, the malted milk ball and molasses sweetness is overpowering - it needs more dark chocolate and roast to balance. Either way, a solid RIS.i"
""
"What a joy it is to finally get to try ten fidy. Bold, assertive, and complex. Perfect for the autumn/ winter seasons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: What an amazingly rich stout! I can see why people rave about this one. A slow sipper on a cool fall night (and would be good this winter, good thing that I bought a 4 pack) and I think would be great with food. I had it with a banana butterscotch muffin at the end and it paired pretty well. Definitely a one at a time beer - the ABV is notable pretty quickly on after starting to drink this one. It warms you up. I can't say I want another one right away....and yet....I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to go to work in the morning. One does sate though. Overall I'm very impressed with this beer from start to finish and I will definitely have to hunt this one down again when its in the area."

"Ten Fidy is one of the best stouts out there, and not too difficult to find. It's a bit pricey at about $15 for a 4 pack, but this one is worth shelling out the money when I want something special. A+ Will drink again."

""
""
""
""
"Ten FIDY is simply outstanding. One of the first Russian Imperial Stouts that I truly fell in love with. It's quite a shame that I can't get this regularly in my region, or you can bet my fridge would be stocked with it all the time. If you're a fan of big-ass, robust RISs, do yourself a solid and seek this bad boy out - you won't be disappointed. Plus - it comes in a can. How fucking cool is that?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Alcohol heat is fairly high so that might turn off some people, but I think the thick malt compensates. Very good, dry, chocolatey and roasted."
""
"11/30/2012 EDIT: I've had this several times since I reviewed it - it's becoming one of my favorite beers."
""
"O: Very solid Imperial Stout -- the look of this is the winner. The smell and taste back it up. If you're looking for a heavy stout, then I'd suggest this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - well, not my favorite beer style, but this is amazing, and definitely lived up to the hype. I love stouts/porters that don't smash you in the face with coffee taste, and this is one of those. The beer is beautiful, the taste is complex and subtle, and the mouthfeel makes you want to light a fire, throw on pajamas, and watch football with snow falling outside. An incredible beer."
""
""
"Overall: An excellent RIS that I have waited way too long to try, on the list of stouts with a dark fruit flavor component this one falls just below Peche Mortel, which I consider pretty strong praise (as it’s also nicely cheaper than Peche)."
"O – One of the best things to ever come out of a can. A tad pricey ($15/4pack), but I would say it is worth it. If I had more money, I would stock up on this and see if it ages well in the can. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. I normally am not a fan of stouts but this is helping bring me around. I would say this is a little heavy on the roasted flavors…some may like it, some may not. The beer is damn good but not perfect…worth picking it up and I enjoyed every sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- my second beer from OB and I'm very impressed with this RIS in can. Smooth, creamy, chocolatey and a tad boozey... MY TYPE OF BEER!"
"Very possibly the best beer I've ever had. Ignore my insane ramblings and just try it if you ever get a chance. You'll never be the same if you don't."
"Overall: Tons of dark chocolate, like I sat down to munch on a brick of bakers chocolate."
""
""
""
"Pours black with a nice dark brown head. A roasty aroma with some nice chocolate and coffee. Taste follows through. Taste thick and rich, roastiness that travels into some burnt and bitter territory (which I love), some nice thick chocolate, and some coffee. As it warms the chocolate becomes stronger and more upfront than the coffee and a little something else shows itself in the middle there, perhaps molasses? A little alcohol shows itself but much tamer from what I have come to expect from fresher bottles. A nice full, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a great beer new or old. Arguably Oskar Blues's best offering."
""
"Just when you think you know what to expect from this style, a beer like this one comes across your path and surprises you. I did not anticipate how sweet this beer was, but combined with the roastiness of the style, it works and doesn't seem cloying or syrupy. While some RISs display lots of burnt fruit flavors, this one is all about coffee and chocolate. It's almost like drinking AleSmith's Speedway Stout. It's not really roasty enough to be my favorite RIS, but it's awfully high up on my list. Moreover, at this price point, it is a superb bargain."
"Re-review:  love this beer. Needed to raise score to match my ever-increasing enjoyment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - One of the best readily available RIS's I have had. This is very comparable to Expedition stout, but with a bit more sweetness. I now know that this beer kicks ass. Canned stouts...its a wonderful thing!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This stout is well balanced it is not overly coffeey or too thick for an imperial stout it is incredibly drinkable, I really like this beer it is not my number one but it is damn close. I thought there was no way I would love an imperial stout out of can but I'm a believer now good stuff oskar can on."
""
"Overall, terrific. This one definitely lived up to its reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - first time having this and im not opposed to paying 14 bucks for a 4 pack. though, it does remind me a lot of breakfast stout, it seems like the bitterness from the hops really make the difference here. also, there is that slight dark fruit flavor which i love, and the key for me to really make this beer amazing is its creaminess. i think after a year of aging this beer would really come together perfectly, after allowing the hops to mellow a bit and the alcohol to really cool down."
"Any argument against canning high quality brews ends here. Just an incredible example of the style, and a welcome addition to the Chi-town market. Will definitely be getting again."
""
"O- Before it went into my mouth it was just ok but the taste and feel of it is soo good, looking forward to enjoying this with some age on it."
"O: This beer is pretty fantastic across the board. I'm not sucking it down, but instead its like an elongated delicious desserty meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - No alcohol harshness anywhere in this one. The fruit elements clearly is what I'll remember about this one. It's akin to Founder RIS and Dark Horse Plead the 5th, only with more sweetness and less roast that I imagined it would have. Good thing I want to revisit, since I bought a 4 pack. ;)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I expected great things from this beer, and it's definitely a nice RIS, especially if you like the focus to be on more of the roasty and char flavors. It's a very good RIS, but not great in my opinion. Great flavors, but not the balance I'm looking for, this one is definitely roast/char forward - which is great if that's what you like. Complex yes, balanced, not so much. For $15 dollars a 4-pak, you could do better."
""
"Great beer, happy I finally got to try some. I bought an extra 4-pack to sit in the basement for a year or so to see how it does with some age."
""
"Overall this is an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is the s**t. I have nothing else to say. Well worth my $15 for a 4-pack."
"Wasn't sure that the $16 for a 4 pack would be worth it (BCS used to be 22) but it is a excellent world class sout"

"Different than North Coast Old Rasputin- smoother, more balanced, and rich in liqueur- candy aroma and taste. Buy it!"

"Tastes tits smooth and balanced, but at the same time austere in its weight. It is as though the discomfort of Old Rasputin is replace with sheer joy while losing none of the character. Absolutely brilliant. The can ensures freshness. The can is a cool black and silver mural. I find myself going back to this when I want one, good, beer. This always does the trick. Oddly enough this is par for the course for Oskar Blues."
"Overall- The off flavors really deture from the beautiful look and mouthfeel of this beer. Very sad because this could have been a 5 star beer for sure otherwise."

"O – For me, this is one of those style defining beers. I always pick some up if I see it."

"Overall, stouts are not my favorite style, but this is outstanding. Great for a cold night!"

"Such an epic beer. Stouts are not my typical fare but this is supreme; Black velvet supreme. The fact it is aged 2 years makes it all the more delicious."

"The beer pours like a black-coffee ooze. Thick and without bubbles till you get to the top of the glass and there is develops some serious tan head that reminds me of maple syrup and only appears as a skim and fades away quick. I can’t see within the beer to report on haziness, etc… but I can tell you that there are little bubbles bouncing to the tops of the beer to refill the ring of lacing. When the beer is given a swirl it leaves long hill-like patterns of alcoholic legs along the sides. The beer smells fat with charred wood, charcoals, and a heady dark chocolate hiding behind everything. The booze also peak through slightly with a spicy slight burn at the end of the whiff. The smell in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran by Brew Dog. The beer tastes fat and oozing with roasted coffee and sweet charred wood. The aftertaste resonates with dark chocolate, some slight charred wood and an oh-so-slight burn to remind you of this beer’s ABV. From the can the beer tastes mildly sweeter with a mellowing of the charred wood and more of a sweet boozy taste. This beer seems to taste better in the glass overall than in the can for me. The mouthfeel of this beer is heavenly. As I said before it is fat and oozing on the tongue. It is beyond-velvet smooth as it oozes through your mouth and it runs down the throat like molasses. This beer leaves the mouth high and dry and begging for more with only faint wisps saliva on the tongue trying vainly to put out the smoky chocolate fire in your mouth. Overall this beer lives up to its reputation, it was a delectable sipper that holds up to the Founder’s Breakfast Stout that I had last week. This beer in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran beer without the bourbon flavor linger. This is a fantastic Russian imperial stout and is well worth a drink."
"O - Thick, roasty, and chewy. One of the boldest big distribution craft stouts on the market."

"O: I associate this beer with motor oil for a few reasons: 1) it comes in a can 2) it’s black as night with little carb and 3) it’s THICK. But it is a perfect example of how to do aggressive levels of roasted malt that really work. Awesome tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
"o: I've held off this beer for a while now and I'm kinda pissed I did. Incredibly solid RIS."
"Very impressed with this one. Flavors meld well, taking this to the next level. Alcohol well hidden for the ABV. Curious to see what a bit of age will do."
""
"O: don’t find this one all that complex, very straight forward. Thought that this is a solid beer all the way though. Glad that this is coming to Chicago in the near future"
""
""
""
"I’m not particularly gung-ho about this Imperial Stout, but some people seem to love it. The mouthfeel is impressive and it’s gained an almost legendary status for its thickness. The year and a half aging has really mellowed this out and brought out a lot of dark fruits in the flavor profile. Try it for yourself."

"This was poured on tap at TAPS in Petaluma, CA. Dark tan head with thick lacing that stuck on the glass. My first impression of this beer upon smelling it was molasses, coffee, chocolate, and everything black with a rich overall smell and subdued alcohol. The thing I really liked upon tasting this beer was the complexity - very chocolatey and thick, charcoal, molasses - and it subdued the alcohol well. This is, in my opinion, one of the finest imperial stouts out there."
""
"Overall: I can see why this is the go to for many. Really enjoyable. Preferable to Old Rasputin in my taste."

"This is a big beer and one of the biggest I ever had in a can. Really amazing RIS and an example of what it should be. It has a lot of personallity but maintains the correct character of a RIS. Nice job!! I will continue to buy this brew. Just not sure how it would age in the can. I would love to have a glass bomber of this to age!!"

"O - An amazing stout, and probably the best I have ever had. I have been reading about this for a while, and NOW I see what all the hype is about. Nearly perfect. Kudos to OB for this amazing stout."

"Ten Fidy has been on my bucket list for awhile and finally made a trip to Ft Collins and brought it back along with quite a haul of others we can't get here in S. Dakota. It sure didn't disappoint me at all. I'd say its world class!"

"Drinkability: A very smooth, very tasty, RIS. Good job on the aging Brick Store, good job on the beer Oskar Blues."

"Overall a serious stout in a can. Really lays on the flavor in a strong drinkable way. Would certainly recommend to any stout fan."
""
""
"This brew is a dark black color with a respectable light brown head and fantastic lacing. The aroma says beautiful licorice malt, so deep it nearly suggests a minty grass hop with a slight bubblegum sweetness. Very nice. The flavor just brings more of the same with juniper malt licorice, smooth as silk and nearly as thick as motor oil. Goes down easy and feels like such a velvetty masterpiece you have to just savor it’s malty splendor. Not much more to say. Classy stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall this is very good. I'd love to try a barrel aged version of this if it exists. Full flavored, complex and very drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden. I'd pay the $4.25 again for the can the next time i see it. I did age this one quite a while and will have to see it it was worth it to age it, by trying a younger one soon."

"Good beer that I have been wanting to try for a long time. Glad the Piggly Wiggly had this waiting for me in Myrtle Beach! With all the hype, I expected more."
"O: a good RIS, but not the best - neat to find something like this in a can - this is actually my first can review! But I would probably choose other RISs over this. Worth the buy and try for sure though."
"O: Awesome RIS. Great flavors. Well done, OB."

"Pours black (duh), with a finger of dark brown head with a purplish tinge to it. Light retention. Nose has chocolate, brown sugar sweetness, coconut and syrupy dark fruits. A bit of almond liqeur and caramel also - really complex stuff. Taste has chocolate, dark sugary fruits, a bit of vanilla, syrup ans some nuttiness. Large roastiness too. A little less complex than the nose suggested but still fantastic. Some alcohol and warmth carries into the finish. Full feel, extremely smooth. A brilliant IS, whiskey BA'd version of this would be absolutely marvelous I'd imagine."

"Overall, a great beer. Not exactly my favorite type of beer, but a beer that has a lot of character, with difference experiences as it goes down."
"O-A solid brew, most likely would be better fresh as the coffee would be even more present."

"O - My first canned stout I've had, and it was pretty damn good. I was worried about a residual metalic taste from the can, but none exsisted. Really solid RIS, thanks Chris!"

"(lightly modified with tasting at the Brevard NC brewery in Sept. 2013)"
"Thanks to EgadBananas for this can dated 11-14-11. Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a two-finger length dark brown head that dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malts, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. It's mildy sweet smelling as well. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and alcohol featured prominently in the flavors. The hops are also present on the back end to balance some of the malty sweetness. The aftertaste is mildly of coffee and chocolate. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. It's creamy, but not too filling. The drinkability is very high for a style generally more suited for sipping. It's full of flavor and very easy to drink for such a big beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer and an excellent example of the style."
""
"O: one of my favorite imp souts... One I keep going back to again and again."
""
""
"Highly recommend."
"Overall: Goddamn what a beer. A lot of flavor packed in that can. Roasty, sweet and bitter."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is nearly unsurpassed - toasted wood, mild coffee, fig, vanilla bean, more brown sugar, soft booze, it pretty much incorporates a piece of every memorable impy stout I've had. Not as if that makes for a perfect beer, but definitely a good one."
"Overall: This is an expensive beer, but one that I suspect is expensive to make. I will gladly try this beer again as it did not disappoint. Maybe a little hard to recommend to new beer drinkers. Very solid!"
""
""
"O- This is the benchmark of what a Russian Imperial Stout is and should be. It's truly a fantastic beer. It has a great complexity and goes down shockingly smooth. I would definitely purchase again and again regardless of the $12.99 (4 pk.) price."
""
"On-tap at the Tasty Weasel. Oskar Blues does big beers well and this is no exception. Everything the style demands is present. Thick and creamy, but not overly sweet. Strong espresso, chocolate covered coffee beans, char, and a blast of herbal hops. Black as night with a lasting collar of tan foam. I wish I could get cans of this in Oklahoma..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Obviously not a Night Stalker - but, hey, I wasn't really expecting much. Think I'd opt for some other RISs instead of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised at this ""can"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very complex aroma with a beautiful appearance. This is an excellent Russian imperial stout."
""
"The RIS was poured from the can into a pint glass. The color and the thickness of the stout reminded me that it is almost time to change my oil. It was as dark as used motor oil and had the same relative thickness. A slight mocha colored head formed at the top of the drink. Aromatic impressions included dark chocolate and burned malts, though the scents were light. The initial taste was a spicy dark chocolate with hints of dark fruits and the burn of tobacco. The smooth maltiness coats the tongue nicely. Tart flavors really hit the sides of the tongue nicely. These flavors are allowed to linger with the lack of strong carbonation. The aftertaste is moderately warming, lingering several minutes in the throat before fading. The dark chocolate continues in the aftertaste with hints of prune and a certain degree of chalkiness. This is a very well structured RIS that is fairly accessible."
"O: Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was perfect. Rich and creamy with enough carbonation to scrub off the richness. Well done."
""
"An outstanding imperial stout. I'd forgotten how enjoyable it is. A tad on the pricey side but sure a pleasure to drink. It'll be nice to see how the other 3 from the pack do at 12, 18 & 24 months. This is a must try for ant fan of big stouts."
"originally reviewed on: 09-07-2010"

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I won’t lie, I was taken aback by this beer. I’ve never poured a beer this color out of a can. It threw me for a loop. With that said, it's solid. Ages quite well."
""
""
""
""
"Coffee flavor is overshadowed by the booziness. Mouthfeel is quite nice. If I weren't on the verge of puking from an evening of overindulgence, I'd probably enjoy this quite a bit."
"O: This is an exceptional stout. My only problem with it is the price and the fact that I couldn't drink anything after having this because it was so heavy. Not a downfall really, but I drank it after a few IPAs so it was a little tough to finish. Not sure if it's worth the price tag, but it's at least worth it if you can get a single can."
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy bodied, with detectable carbonation that has very ""small"" bubbles, resulting in a very fine, gentle tingling across the palate. Very pleasant, somewhat velvet-like mouthfeel. Finish is dry, a bit sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is my favourite beer, the mouthfeel in particular is just incredible."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is truly excellent fare; beer so good that it’s hard to believe it comes out of a can (much, to Oskar Blues’ credit, like all of their offerings). It’s difficult to imagine much more flavor being cranked out of a mash tun, much less being squeezed into a tiny can. Any serious fan of Imperial Stouts has to put this one on their must-try list."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Such a great RIS. I wouldn't believe it was canned if i didn't know beforehand. Easily the best stout i have had so far, but the list is rather limited. Well worth the $15 for a 4 pack"
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Ciros on Garnet Ave in San Diego."
"Pours a two finger brown head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Malty nose, flavor is similar, malts and burnt chocolate. High ABV is hidden, decent IS, close to a RIS. $4.95 for a 12oz black can (yes a can and it is very drinkable) from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH. Canned 9/21/2011."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good beer and definitely an RIS that stands out."
""
"O - This is one of the best imperial stouts that I’ve ever had. It looks, smells, and tastes great, and it has the best mouthfeel by FAR of any stout I’ve tried. Plus, for 10.5% ABV, it hides the alcohol extremely well. This is an excellent beer. And it’s in a can!"
""
"O- Ten Fidy has a different flavor profile than almost any other imperial stout. The only beer it slightly reminds me of is World Wide Stout. The complexity and balance of the flavors is great."
"Overall – The only imperial stout I ever had delivered in a can and it was fantastic!!! A huge and wonderfully delicious stout."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is an excellent stout. A great year-round offering and one of the best if not the best value for an imperial stout."
""
"On a side note-now understand my wife is NOT into beer, especially ""big"" beer. Mid review I had to stop to help her with something and she didn't know I was drinking a beer in the basement and I just walked past her and she said ""oh your breath smells, are you drinking a beer""? Now I just walked past her and she picked up on this beer and at that point I had only had about 4 sips! I believe this is a testament to the bigness of this beer and one that I love!"
""
""
"O: I always seem to have odd carbonation/head/lacing with cans, might be me. Like any good RIS its complex, but this one is incredibly smooth. More sessionable than others in its category. Still probably overpriced, fresh I would expect bigger hop flavors/robustness, maybe not as smooth though. A must try but still overpriced."
""
""
""
"a little heat needs to be worked out and perhaps my glass was dirty because zero lace is odd for style, but when a beer tastes this good its got to be a good thing. I need to thank the very awesome Rutager for sending me this"
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe the beer was defective, maybe I'm defective, but while I didn't dislike TenFidy, I didn't like it nearly as much as many recent revierers. Everything was right there where it should be except for a raw, unapologetic wood-grain alcohol aftertaste, which took away some of the fun of drinking the beer.It is a beauty to look at and incredibly smooth in the mouth. But the final taste was just raw booze. I will try it again."
"Overall: Holy shit! Also, spot-on for the style."
""

"Picked this up at GBX on the growler station. Serious stuff here. The pour was just what you would think. Dark and thick, it look more like 10w 30 than a beer. Motor oil dark with a nice 2 finger mocca head. Good spotting and lacing throughout. Looked great in the new snifter. Smell is a chocolate bomb with some coffee notes. Very inviting on the nose and couldn't stop enjoying the aroma. Taste follows the nose with initial chocolate followed by some coffee and sweet dark fruits. Thought it would taste more bitter chocolate or over the top, but it was a nice blend and a true RIS. Feel is creramy/silk with adequate carbonation and full bodied. Overall- A great RIS with just the right amount of chocolate/coffee/figs/fruits/malts and hops. It hides the 10.5% ABV well, but it's a sipper for a chilly evening. Not over the top which is a nice touch. Top notch-"

"A great RIS overall. This beer has aged well thus far. Everything comes together really well and nothing takes over anything else. One of the better RIS's out there, although not my favorite."

"A really nice RIS that is bready, roasty, thick, earthy, and complex. Not one of my favorites but nice nonetheless."
""

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very very dark brown, but not quick black, and was completely opaque. Poured with a nice 2 finger thick foamy head, that slowly dropped down to a thin layer with good cling. Aroma was sweet, slightly lactosey like a milk stout. Hints of brown sugar and coffee, almost a mocha undertone. Flavor was sweet and creamy. Very well balanced, not at all acidic. Seemed like a slightly burnt milk stout. A little thin in the mouth, didn't cling at all like I would have expected it to. Not terribly so. Overall a damn good stout, and damn good stout in a can. Definitely worth its weight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid, solid stout. One you shouldn't overlook for a true to form RIS. I like it, and I'm not crazy about pouring beer out of cans!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing presence in the glass. Dark black with a healtht brown head that remains for most of the beer. Malt, chocolate, coffee on the nose. Rich, deep stout taste. Touch too much alcohol presence on the finish. Otherwise, quite the solid imperial stout."
""
"Overall this is a fine example of an imperial stout. I've had this beer fresh and aged and it's great either way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an outstanding example of the style. Well worth the cost if anyone shies away from it based on price alone. If you're curious about this beer, you've gotta just bite the bullet and try it. It's excellent."

"O- Whoaa. Oskar Blues is showing everybody why canned beer is not the runs of beers. More? Yes please."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. The flavors are very complex and the mouthfeel is one of the best I have come across. I really want to try one fresh to see how the flavors and carbonation have changed in the last 15 months. It is a once in a while type beer, but I will definitely get it again."
"Had it at Cannibal in NYC"
"O- This was a fantastic beer. Imperial stouts are one of my favorite style of beers and I'd say this one definitely ranks as one of the better ones. It has a great taste and goes down perfectly smooth. Would definitely purchase again. Wish it was cheaper though, kind of expensive at $16.50 for a 4-pack in Boston."
""
"Overall: Until I get me some whales, this is the standard by which all other Imperial Stouts shall be judged."
""
""
""
"I don't think I would buy this one again. Its a shame cause their scotch ale is amazing, but maybe this one isn't for me."
""
"This is my favorite of the canned beers and one of my favorite imperial stouts. Pours as black as motor oil, but there's the right amount of sweetness and hops for a stout. Big flavor, but it still drinks much easier than you'd expect from a 10.5% abv beer."
""
"Beer was good. "
"O overall a very nice IS, would love to try it barrel aged. Very nice beer but its a bit of a reach at its price point."
""
""
""
""
"This is an amazing beer. If you see it, go ahead and pick it up. It even works well for aging. This can is about a year old, and I set aside the other three cans to open every six months for the next year and half."

""
""
""
"o - I love ten fidy! better not quite as old, but still sippable!"
"-Overall 4.0: Very good to almost excellent Imperial Stout. Certainly not a session beer for me, but I would definitely buy a six pack of this brew. An outstanding offering from Oskar Blues."

"o - fantastic and dangerously drinkable for such a big beer. if this were distributed in michigan i would buy it all the time."
""
"Absolutley jet black, no light coming through this at all, small ring of tan coloured head, no lace. Smell is nice and roasty, big bittersweet chocolate presence, some burnt malt comes through as well. Taste is roasty with tons of chocolate, coffee, bakers chocolate flavour leaves a nice bitter edge, comes off pretty hoppy at points as well. Thick and full feel, incerdibly smooth, light carbonation makes this really easy to sip. Great stuff, a solid imperial stout, certainly something I will have to get more of."
""
""
""
""
""

"By far, this is my favorite imperial to date. It took a lot of courage to open a can containing Imperial Stout.... Really? A can? When i popped the tab, I thought the beer might be flat, as there was no release of pressure. Upon pouring it into a pint glass, the motor oil appearance got my hopes up a bit; though I was concerned by the lack of head. All doubts were put aside on the first taste. Caramael, roasted malt, chocolate, as each sip went down, I waited for the usual let-down of excitement or back-end bitterness... That never happened. This beer is incredible! Thank you Oskar Blues for bringing this stout into the world! Oskar Blues is not currently distributed in Ohio, so I will seek it out in my travels. Cheers."
"This is very good beer, especially for the value at around 11 or 12 bucks for four twelve ounce cans. It is fairly easy to sip on and enjoy the changes it takes on from cool to room temp. I wouldn't buy it regularly, but definitely snag a can or two every so often given the opportunity."
"O - I was a little intimidated by the look of it coming out of the can but man, it turned out great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"T: Big flavors of dark chocolate, molasses and rye bread with some espresso and faint hops on the finish. Big and chewy mouthfeel really worked for me. Tasty stuff."
"O: I would love a bit more on the nose (it was about halfway between fridge and room temp when I drank it). But overall just a gorgeous beer that I wish we could get in Ohio; I will definitely get more the next time I am in a state it's distributed to!"
""
""
""
"O - a great beer. Didn't realize this can was so old, but it is very good at this point."

"O- this is a fantastic Russian imperial stout from a can."

"o- i've been wanting to try this beer for a while, but even though the price per oz is awesome, i've never been up to cough up $15 for a 4pack (stupid, I know). Now that i've tried it and enjoyed it I doubt I'll have that problem. Great beer and awesome that it's in a can."
"Overall, exceptional offering worth seeking out, love that it is available in cans so there is no danger of light damage, one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I've sampled. Delicious!"

"Overall: I was really excited to try this beer but I was extremely disappointed. I hate licorice flavors in imperial stouts and hate when you can taste the alcohol and you could REALLY taste both in this beer. It overpowered everything else. Not a fan."
""
""
""
"O- Great beer. Oskar Blues did good."
""
""

"Verdict: Great Russian Imperial Stout from Oskar Blues. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but it’s definitely one to try at some point. I’ve got a few more and I’ll be really looking forward to how this one ages."

"Overall: Ridiculously smooth 10.5 ABV Imperial Stout. Well balanced with a full body. Cheers."

"Great Imperial Stout"

"O: I enjoyed this beer and think a tiny bit more aging/cellaring would probably do it good but am not sure that cellaring a canned beer really has a lot of effect. It is very enjoyable today so I will likely enjoy the rest of the 4 pack this winter and not worry about cellaring."
"O: This stuff brought a whole new meaning to the stout style for me. I will pick this up whenever I can get it, and I highly recommend it to anyone out there."

"O - Glad I picked up 2 4-packs of this. It will either be lovingly enjoyed or traded for something equally awesome. Bitches Brew anyone?!? Highly! recommended!"

"Highly, highly recommended and is one of the ""must try once in your lifetime"" beers."

"I'm totally blown away with how complex and satisfyingly balanced this is, despite many indications that it could be an aggressive experience! $4 for one of the best RISs you could get, honestly. Should NOT be consumed straight out of the can, however: this is the kind of beer meant for wine glasses due to the various flavors it produces, and due to its refined drinking experience that it provides. I'll have one or two more please! (And then NO MORE unless you're willing to carry me out of the bar!)"
"O: This was a great RIS. One of the better ones I've had to date. It is pretty much what you'd expect from a good RIS- lots of roasted and burnt malts, big feel, high alcohol. Bonus points for the can."

"Canned on 11-11-10, this Ten Fidy pours a thick, syrupy black, with a light brown head that is well-retained and provides pretty good lacing. Sweet licorice aromas blend well with a big malty backbone, molasses, and a hint of nail polish? Big roastiness out front, with dark chocolate and light smokiness pushing into a slight hop bitterness in the background, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. Very low carbonation helps the big and creamy full body of the Fidy take center stage in this easy to drink 10.5% Imperial Stout."

"D- crazy drinkable for the abv and sheer size of this Imperial stout. Thank you OB you guys kill the Imperial stout and resurrect it just so you kill it again. World class."
""
"O: Great year-round brew from a brewery I am anxious to try more from."
"O - Best stout I've ever had, and far and away, the best canned beer I've ever had. I need to get my hands on more of this!"
""
""
""
"I don't get it. People hold this up as a holy grail stout. It didn't even taste like stout to me. It didn't really taste like beer. I can't figure out what it tasted like but it was a taste that shouldn't be in a beer. Not quite fruity - maybe some kind of perfume? It wasn't necessarily a bad taste but I guess it's like when you go to take a sip of your coke and you're thrown off for a second because you had forgotten you were actually drinking iced tea. I loves me some RIS but this one must be an acquired taste. I've never had anything that tasted similar. I wouldn't order it again."
""
""
""
"Probably the best imperial stout I've ever had that didn't spend time in a barrel. And it's better--and smoother--than some that have."
""
""
"O: The BA crowd didn't steer me wrong with this one. A bit pricey ($15/4pk), but worth the occasional treat. A bit thicker and more tasty than Old Raspy, so I don't mind paying the extra $$. Very odd to see such a terrific treat in a can. A solid A+ overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Impressive imperial stout that withstands the test of time of being abused in my liquor store. Good, but worth 11.99 (sale price for being old) for a 4 pack? Eh, possibly. But 14.99? I'll take a yeti. Still good though, best canned beer I've had yet."
""
""
"Had this on draft 06.Feb.2010 and it was amazing."
""
""
""
"O: Having had this beer only once before and remembering it to be great, I was not let down. I may have enjoyed it in the wrong venue and would have liked to share it with a friend, but I didn't mind having it all to myself at all. For the pricepoint, you cannot go wrong and I wish I had picked up an extra can or four to age for a while longer to see what happened to it. The educator in me gives it an A-."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I have to give it an average rating. The smell is off putting to me and the slightly sour tang from the citrus notes comes across as asorbic. Definitely pair it with a protein."
"Overall, a fantastic example of a RIS. I'd like to get some age on this to see if the alcohol will mute a slight amount, but that's really the only complaint I have with this beer."
""
""
"Smell is dark fruits, roated malts, and a little chocolate. Taste is dara fruits, roasted malts, a little pine, and a TINY bit of chocolate. Really a great beer with a nice thick mouthfeel. Not very many other easy to get stouts."
""
"O: Rich and delicious. Not my favorite Imp. Stout (tough category!) but it's up there. So decadent. Makes a great nightcap."
""
"I'd buy this beer once in a while, and I imagine when I'm in the mood, it'd be worth the $14-$15 for a 4-pack."
""
""
""
"Well, this is a great beer. I don't think I could ever pass up another opportunity to sip on this masterpiece."
""
"Midnight black & an evil looking fine orange like khaki head. Minimal lacing but of course boozy legs. Big sweet dark chocolates, caramel malts, nuttiness, a cream like coolness, and breadiness. A perfect blend of the aforementioned - no character is dominant, rather everything blends together in unison with a nice accent of vanilla bean & hop bitterness at the finish. Heavy body, but expected for a RIS."
""
""
"Oskar Blues TenFidy Imperial Stout: Simply amazing! At $15 for a four pack of bland looking cans, you really go out on a limb hoping that this oddly named brew will be good, and it delivers. It pours out of the can black as crude oil. A thin mahogany brown head rises to the surface. The aroma is mellow, pleasant to draw in. There is an amazing feel to the first sip, it coats your mouth like a vanilla malt. The flavor is well balanced, long and luxurious, super smooth. The balance is the key, the flavor is not overwhelming at any point, but very satisfying for the whole experience. Do not be deterred by the name and can, this Stout should not be missed."
"O: Very impressed with this beer. Instantly became one of my favorite imperial stouts. Well worth the price and I highly recommend picking this up."
""
"Edit: Super aggressive pour gave this a huge head with nice lacing."
""
""
"O: My first taste of the Tin Fidy, having put it off for to long do to price i can finally say its totally worth it. try it with something chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"		Imperial stouts are my favorite style and Ten Fidy is a good one. I hear a 	lot of complaints about the price of this beer but at less than $8 for the equivalent 	of a bomber of a great 10.5% stout is well worth it too me. I am curious how it 	will age in a can so I grabbed a few four packs and I will let you know in a few 	years! Overall a great beer and worth picking up if you can."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my absolute favorite imperial stout, but I'm still a fan. Given its price point (it's not insane, but a little high), I'm more likely to gravitate toward Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, but it's still a great RIS."
""
""
""
""
"Leaves a very chewy feeling from the oats and malt bill. I actually like it better out of a can than on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An extremely drinkable Russian Imperial Stout, my sole complaint is that it could have a better mouthfeel from having a higher level of carbonation; which would give it a better level of head as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the palate the Ten Fidy is thick and viscous, yet very easy to drink. Tons of roasted malts dominate my palate with a clean toasty finish and just a touch of dry bitterness. This really is the monster of all Imperial Stouts as the beerAdvocate reviews state!"
"This stout by Oskar Blues has excellent mouth feel and the alcohol content lingers in the background. One of the finest stouts I have personally tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Easy enough to say the best RIS in a can I have ever had. As far as the best RIS it holds its own. Really reminds me why RIS is such a great style of beer. Monster flavor, thick mouthfeel, and hidden alcohol warmth."
"1427"
""
""
"O: A hefty beer to be sure, and not one for the faint of heart. I'm happy to say that I see no evidence of aluminum tainting the brew. It is deeply roasty, both sweet and bitter and thoroughly delicious. Maybe not all it's hyped up to be, but definitely a tasty, tasty brew."
""
"You can smell and taste the roasted malts, very pleasing, and very easy drinkability. I would love to try this on tap."
""
"Update, 1/11/12: warmer was better. Inch of head, more coffee aroma. Body was much fuller."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O - I think this is an excellent beer. I think if you like stouts you should try this one for sure. This is my first one, but I'll be sure to get it again."
"O - This is a solid stout, but not one I would run to often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite stouts hands down. If you are a fan of big beers I'd seek this one out. Sadly for me its not available in my state so I have to travel to get it. If you can obtain this beer grab it in a heartbeat because it is hard to be disappointed by this beer."
"This is one of the thickest stouts I can recall drinking and is very smooth. No substanital notice of the alcohol. I had previously posted a while back that I wasn't as fond of Ten FIDY as other stouts. But, upon having it again (maybe two years later?), I can say this is definitely an outstanding RIS."
"this is a HUGE beer. pours muddy fudge black into a full pint glass (wow) with a dark brown head and inch high. smells really really strong, bittersweet coffee notes, and bread grains. taste is really bold, heavy dark roasted malts up front and a stiff bitterness on the back end, molasses and espresso in between. mouthfeel is great here, carbonated just enough, and really smooth for such a strong brew. overall a very impressive imperial stout, maybe the best ive had. got to be careful with these though, can get loose pretty quick with the abv. fresh at the brewery in lyons this was epic"
""
""
""
"O: So balanced. A pleasure to drink—and it is drinkable despite its 10.5% ABV. Took an effort to slow down. Dangerous! Delicious."
""
"10/19/2014.  From a can bought at Chuck's 85th into an ale glass. Pours murky black, with tons of tan head that lingers, with lace on the sides.  Smells of roasted malt, cocoa, licorice, a little must. Flavor is sweet, with a mix of bitterness and sweetness in the finish.  Big mouthfeel, yet smooth and drinkable.  Long finish.  My go to beer for backpacking trips - concentrated goodness."

"O - Boy do I not get the hype and praise this beer gets. So far I am not all that impressed with Oskar Blues. This was simply an unpleasant beer to drink."
"O: I feel like I'm finishing a bowl of coco puffs with chocolate milk; fresh bready grain flavor with an intense amount of malt flavor. The oatmeal reminds me of breakfast and the fruity presence makes it over the top. Reminds me of Expedition from Bells brewery, just not as potent. Would love to have side by side."
""
""

"Overall Drinkability - Strong, balanced, complex and enjoyable. Slow drink. I feel a buzz coming on after only a few sips."

"O-extremely well put together stout. I'm still a little dumbfounded that this is distributed in a can and is this good."

"This is a great beer and also the blackest beer I think I've ever had. It was a real treat drinking this one. (Reviewed from last night's notes)"
"In my RIS Top 5. Epic brew."
"Overall; I think this is a phenomenal beer and I love how comparitvely easy it is to get this brew. It is consistently fantastic, and I could likely drink this every night without it becoming routine. Anyone who is a stout fan should at the very least try this, and I feel any stout fan should have several in their cellar at any given time!!"

"Worth a shot if you are into stouts. If they aren't your flavor, you could stand to be a bit more selective, but still not an unworthwhile beer."
""
""
""
"I am very pleased with this beer. There is quite a bit going on with the flavors and aromas. A great stout for a cold winter day. Probably going to drink my last can with a beef stew."
""
"I'm pretty sure I'll still be tasting that fusel-like finish when I wake up tomorrow, not to mention I could run my car with this beer. Freaking amazing. And considering the only other things I've had that taste anywhere near this are the the Stone RIS and the DFH WWS, at $6.99/22oz and $10-12/12oz respectively, I think this is worth the price."
"O: A total slap in the face. A decent RIS, but it's not good enough to justify the price tag for me. The hype surrounding this beer seems to be all about its intensity rather than its quality."
""
"Over all, I love this beer. It has given me a new appropriation of the RIS family. I found a four pack of this at a grocery store on the East coast. Unfortunately it was about $17...I almost cried."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O-this is really good. a bit to boozy, but hell, thats a good thing. if thats my only complaint on a beer then thats probably a good sign."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll be honest, this just isn't my style. I don't need to taste my alcohol to enjoy it, and although this beer does a better job then most at masking it, it seems a little bit too much like a chocolate flavored rum...with a lot of body. Still, I would say this is one of the best of the style that I have had."
""
""
"O - its a really good beer. expensive but very much worth it every once in a while."
"O: Overall, a fantastic RIS. The appearance was pretty standard, and the aroma nothing spectacular but then you take the first sip and realize this is a special brew. Incredibly smooth, with a flavor profile that gets better with every sip. Very well done."
""
"Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Good lord. Pitch black with nutty, tan lacing. Looks like used motor oil. Hints of espresso and dark toffee on the nose. First taste is like eating dark cocoa and coffee with a milky chocolate finish. Rich and creamy, I could bathe in this guy. Still waiting to have it on tap. Simply a must try beer."
""
"All in all...a fantastic beer. Glad I finally got some."
"O: This is my second craft can experience. Ten Fidy is intense. I can't imagine drinking a 6'er of these... maybe a 666'er, i don't know... only because it is strong as shins... UFC fighter shins... wow...i'm glad i bought this can."
""
""
"O - Great RIS from OB! Maybe one of the best I have had yet! But like I am with most RIS's, I wouldn't really go for more than one of these."
""
""
"O - Delicious and bold imperial stout. Thick but 10.5% alcohol is extremely well hidden. Really really enjoying this"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic beer that is worth the hype and I hope that I can get more in the future."
""
"Overall - I have had this a few times and always enjoyed it, but never thought it was as good as the ratings suggest. Definitely a quality and easily obtainable stout, but my money would go to Old Rasputin before this. I also have a few older cans that I'd like to try. I'm hoping the hops will fade a bit to let the malts shine a little more. We'll see."
"Overall : This is a very solid beer and worth repeating. Whith its high alcohol percentage I thought this to be would be a little hot but is very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is like the Jules Winfield of Stouts. If TenFidy ever got a movie made about it, Sam Jackson himself would play the role of TenFidy: it's that damn smooth but it will assert itself with great vengence and furious anger if you try to destroy too many all in one sitting. I like it much and it would be remiss in not buying it again if I ever spied it on the shelf of my local purveyor of fine beers."

"pours straight, thick black with a thin layer of dark brown soda like head that quickly recedes to a thin layer around the rim of the glass, check that, it has now receded to an almost non-existent single line of bubbles most of the way around the glass. The aroma is tons of strong roasted malts and a hint of alcohol. Not a lot of nuance but pleasant. Taste is more of the same, pretty straightforward, lots of roasted, chocolately malt with a touch of acridness and a good dose of warming alcohol that manages to avoid being harsh. Carbonation is medium-low which gives a good smooth and full mouthfeel. Overall this is a super nice, very accessible RIS, it lacks some of the complexity of its more specialized brethren but it does not disappoint."
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid RIS. Some interesting savory notes that seem out of place but quite well balanced and the best concealed booziness I've ever had in a RIS. Would definitely drink again!"

"O- an awesome impy stout here, it blew my mind honestly, because this might be the most drinkable beer for it's abv I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall: One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts on the market. I've had this fresh and enjoyed it, but aging this beers makes it incredibly smooth. Certainly worth buying and sticking in your fridge for a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. I really enjoyed it and will keep an eye out for it on draft again in the future!"
""
""
"O: Finally bit the bullet after a couple years passing it by and bought a four pack. Not regretting it. A great stout to sip on those cool nights."
""
""
""
"EDIT: Opened an 09 tonight. I was searching for off flavors. Maybe some slight metalic notes, but still right on. I would say the nose has gone up to to a 5. Everything else is about the same as above."
""
""
"D/O: Great RIS. Hopefully this one will be around AL in the next year...at least from what I hear. I think this one could easily go another year or 3."
"Finally shelled out the big bucks for a 4-pack of this, and I'm quite happy with it. The flavor is very nice: it isn't too bold, so it leaves room for subtleties in an oft over-the-top (or at the least, rather extreme) style. The alcohol doesn't make me shudder either. Very glad I picked this up; great job, Oskar Blues!"
""
""
""
"Overall one of the best RIS's I have had. Loads of malt and really flavorful. Even with a high ABV it doesn't overpower the rest of the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my first ten Fidy, but first time reviewing it. Looks as black as oil, and just about as thick with dark coffee colored head. Full robust, flavorful with a fair amount of alcohol, letting you know where the name came from. A great RIS, noy a bad value considering you can get it in a 12 ounce can instead of bomber. A great beer for winter or after a day of skiing."

"I'm not a big stout guy, but this one is fantastic. And it comes in a can. I'm gonna bring this to holiday parties and stun people."

"D - This is a fantastic beer; you need to try this if you're an RIS fan; A in every category; very easy to drink and smooth; makes an awesome dessert"
"Pours jet black with a creamy two finger tan head that seems to be sticking around. There was a nice cascading effect as the head was forming. Aroma is much more coffee/espresso centric than I remember it. Still a great smell though with caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and dark fruits coming through. A tinge of alcohol on the nose. Taste is like the smell. Tons of espresso and dark chocolate coming through. There is definitely a licorice or dark fruit behind the espresso and chocolate. A nice overall bitterness to keep this from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and carbonation is mild. Overall, the perfect representation of an RIS. I remember tasting a lot of caramel in the last session about a year ago. I would have liked to seen a more pronounced caramel flavor, but this is an amazing beer. Recommended, but you already knew that."
"This beer pours a pitch black color with a very thin brown head. the smell is roasty and malty with a slight sweetness. the flavor is roasty with chocolate and coffee notes, and a nice booziness in the finish. the mouthfeel is thick and viscous with low carbonation. overall this beer is great."
"I love Ten Fidy."
"M: Full bodied; the mouthfeel is good, very thick and somewhat syrupy, but in a good way. The carbonation isn't high, but the alcohol helps to refresh and cleanse the palate."
"O: I know it seems that I keep saying how incredible this beer is but thats because it is!! I was shocked because it was in a can but I guess I just underestimated what can be done using aluminum! Great job on this one!"
"Overall, it is a dessert beer. Too sweet with no balance to be good for anything else. Good when you have a sweet tooth."
"This has got to be one of the best non-barrel aged stouts i've ever had. I will always buy this stuff. Excellent!"
"Overall this is a readily available hyped Imperial Stout that lives up to the clamor. Well done, and no need to tweek this one Oskar Blues."
"O. Very good Imperial stout, gets better with age."
"Thick, oily body. Drinkability suffers a little from the alcohol. All in all, a solid RIS."
"O-Overall this is a very well made stout. Very tasty, pretty complex flavor, easy drinking for the ABV. Well done, I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
"DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"O-Great RIS. One of the best out there that is easily attainable. Oskar Blues is really doing something right with this one."
"All in all, this is my go-to RIS. I will never judge it for being in a can. As soon as it gets in a nice tulip or snifter this beer is more beautiful than Mila Kunis in a tight sweater under your Christmas tree."
"O: This beer pretty good. I think for the money there are a lot of better RIS, but this is a very solid and tasty beer."
"Overall I'm a believer now. This is my first ten fidy, and I'm already thinking about my next trip to the store so I can stock up on more so I don't run out. Great stuff. Very different than Old Rasputin or Yeti, less burnt/roasted malt and more chocolate and coffee, and equally delicious in its own right."
"B"
"Overall - A very enjoyable beer and RIS. Not quite world class in my book but I could go back to this one on a cold winter night anytime. Easy to drink as well."
"O- Amazing beer! The more of OB I have the more I wish it was available in IL. Will be making my parents pick up more when there out in AZ this winter! Thanks mom and dad."
"This is one good beer, and a beer that'll put hair on your chest for sure. I really like the extreme canned beers that Oskar Blues puts out. They seem to avoid any off metallic flavors, and the beer always tastes fresh, as well as always being unique. Thanks again guys."
"O- A great imperial stout. Very well designed but a bit pricier than I'd like."
"O- I have heard/read a lot about the cost of this beer and whether or not it was worth it. I must say, I didn't think it was overpriced when I bought it. Now, if anything, I think it is well-worth the money."
"Thanks Brian!"
"I really dig this one. It's powerful in flavor with a mouthfeel I won't soon forget. Super sticky lips, holy crap!"
"Overall: This beer did not start out good, but it really picked up and became a damned tasty beer. I get the hype behind this brew. However, I can't help but feel like the canned RIS aspect adds to its appeal. At the outrageous price ($4/can) I don't know if I'll be buying this one again, despite how good it is."
"O:Very good. One of these will knock you out for the night. It is a heavy dessert style stout. Would be nice paired with chocolate cake."
"Poured into VIJF Duvel 20 oz giant tulip. Pours a midnight black with a inch of beautiful dark tan head, with some nice lacing. Smell chocolate, coffee, toffee, and pine. Taste is all that, huge hop piney presence, canned on September 23 wow this is bold in a great way. A beer that makes you crave next sip. So happy that the shop a mile away got 4 cases and $14.49 a four is solid. Body is on the medium to heavy side, with a nice amount of carbonation for the style and abv. This is a great beer, not sure if my buds are changing, but blown away this time around."
"Oveall: I'll never forget this beer. Dear god. It's amazing."
"I loved this beer. Even though I’m probably conforming with the status quo, I can certainly see firsthand why this beer gets exceptional ratings."
"O - Overall, I feel like this beer SHOULD have been incredible. Instead, its almost a mess for me. I dont know if it was just a bad batch, or not handled propperly, but this was incredibly dissappointing. No where near worth the $5+ I paid for the can."
"O- For the price i feel there are better out there, but definitely seek this out if you can. Especially to bring to a party to keep your friends guessing why a beer fan brought canned beer."
"First of all I can't believe it took me this long to try this.one of the best RIS I've had in a long time. A pleasure to split with fdkayti. Thanks for the try crushedvol!"
"O - A big beer with big flavor and definitely worth every penny"
"This is definitely better as it warms up a bit, maybe in the 55-60-degree range."
"Overall it reminds me of a good example of a big RIS - like a more flavorful Old Rasputin is the best way I can describe it. I recommend drinking this within a couple degrees of room temperature - the flavors expanded in a big way"
"Overall: A lovely stout with a pretty unique character. A little on the sweet side, but excellent as a dessert beer."
"John thanks for sending me these awesome beers I bet they all beat that sour crap I send you."
"Overall: I prefer the BA version, but this one is still very good. I would have liked the finish to be a bit smoother."
"O: Upped score. I enjoyed this much more this time, plus the aging must have helped it out. A good impy stout, still not a favorite of mine, especially at the price point."
"been waiting to taste this beer for awhile now finally got my hands on a four pack yesterday. It poured the color of motor oil with basically no head to speak of. The smell wasnt as bold as i was expecting, going by the reviews i was expecting a more pronounced nose. The taste was good with dark choclate roasted malt carmel and coffee coming through. My can had little to no carbonation but a very smooth mouthfeel. i was surpised also to see that this was a 10.5%er because i dont taste the booziness at all. Overall I would have to say that although this beer was good i was hoping for more. It had the feeling of a highly hyped pay per view event that ended in the first ten seconds. Leaving you with the sense of "" i paid how much for that!"" Im not saying that i dont like this beer i do, maybe it was my can, maybe it was my mind hyping this beyond what it could produce. Or maybe it was the $16 dollar price tag for a 4 pack that is leaving me a bit empty. In the pockets that is."
"For a Imp stout and given the price its a good one but when compared to many other it would fall short....for me"
"O - A great beer. Not too overwhelming, yet still rich and complex, with a dynamic palate that keeps you guessing."
"O: Not sure what this is like fresh, but but this 4 year old version was amazing. Best thing I've had from a can."
"Very, very classy. Ballsy, distinguished and balanced. Enough said."
"O- If this beer were non-alcoholic I would still drink it. I just might by a case of this next paycheck. I would not only suggest this to my friends, but I would give it to them for free just so they can have one of the best beers they've ever had."
"O: beautiful rendition of the RIS. After having Founders Imperial Stout and Cigar City Marshal Zhukov in the last month, this one stacks up with the best of them, but I'm not ready to say it's the best. Worth buying at $3 a can or whatever. Also, it's in a can - I can take this hiking without the glass weight and space. Awesome!"
"(O) It's a fantastically made imperial stout that tastes awesome...and it's in a can. I don't know why that strikes me so much, but it does. This is a great, bold brew and definitely goes well with the changing of the weather. This is one that I think would be really well with ice cream."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is definitely a sipper. The body is full and robust, allowing your taste buds to experience every nuance this beer has to offer. The carbonation is only slightly noticeable, does not interfere with the flavors, and helps to keep this beer from becoming a syrupy mess. It coats your mouth well and is rather sticky but the mouthfeel is still smooth overall."
"I was lucky to find this one. Only heard about it. Pours a inky thick black. Head has ruby red highlights, very attractive. Scent is of burned but not to much chocolate chip cookies. Maybe some ripened dark brandy soaked fruit. Taste is wow! Molasses, but so sweet, has some char and some expresso flavors, roasted malts are ever present. Mouthfeel is thick, almost syrupy. Overall, great RIS!"
"O - really delicious, readily available RIS that is good fresh off the canning line or aged a few years."
"Overall: Gotta love an imperial stout from a can! Especially when it's aged in that can for 1+ year. Nothing bad to say about this beer. Actually--on a good note, it was fantastice! Would be intersted in trying a fresh one of these next to one that has 1+ year of age on it. Highly recommended!"
"O: Very interesting vintage stout. Admittedly this is my 1st TenFidy. However, I'm now motivated to anny up the $17.99/4pack."
"O: makes a great beer for a fun night. wonder if it makes a great beer bread."
"O: A great beer. A good balance between sweetness and bitterness. Alcohol was sneaky in the sense that the beer was so smooth and easy to drink."
"Ultimately, I'd say this is worth aging, as I can imagine now that it has mellowed a bit it may become a more accessible beer. Also, the aroma really is quite improved. That said, for my tastes, two years may have been two long. I would like to try aging one for just a year."
"O: Out of the cooler, I was not all that impressed with this, but, as it warmed, the character of this beer came out. I will let the next can warm a bit before drinking... overall a very nice RIS."
"This pours a nice oily black color with but a sliver of a head. The aromatics on this stout are marvelous. This is a chocolate bomb beneath the nose. This tastes incredible. Chocolate, malt, and vanilla come together with so many other lovely flavors. This is dessert in a glass. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy. It coats your tongue and the walls of your mouth in all kinds of goodness. The can looks so bad ass and ominous, yet what's inside is so subtle and nuanced, it's really a lamb in a lion's suit. I used to have a stigma against canned beer. Lately, I'm having some of my best beer other in a can, and wishing more brewers would embrace the storage format. I'm going to need more of this. ISO: Tons of Ten"
"Served in a snifter from a can. Pours a deep black with minimal head. A slight mocha head remained around the edges. Smell is sweet and chocolatey. There is a nice roasted flavor to the beer. The chocolate notes come through along with some vanilla sweetness. There is a slight and pleasant malty bitterness. This a thick beer with very little carbonation that lingers on the tongue. Overall this is an excellent Imperial Stout. It has a nice warming feel going down and packs a nice punch without having too much of an alcohol taste. Highly recommended."
"O: Great RIS. One of the elite."
"Canned 11-29-10. This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a half inch of dark brown foam that recedes quickly into a thin ring of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and cocoa powder. The taste is similar to the aroma with a noticeable alcohol burn in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a thick, chewy texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good RIS, but I can't quite call it great. It is flavorful, but lack true complexity in both flavor and aroma."
"An exceptionally simple yet divinely delicious RIS. I want more!"
"Overall: Good beer but not great it is a Russian Imperial I could drink everyday and I highly recommend it"
"pours the thickest pitch black with a one and a half finger mocha colored head that will not go away. everything about this pour reminds me of changing the oil in my truck, especially the thick slapping and glug glug noise it makes as it hits the glass. smell is better than used oil, theres chocolates, roasted notes, and alcohol. taste is outstanding, again with the chocolate, roasted mocha and the warming alochol with a long slightly bitter bite on the end. mouthfeel is thick and rich and creamy. i think my insides are good and lubed up now. overall this is an outstanding r.i.s., everyone should have unlimited access to this beer."
"O- great look and feel. Intense taste.. Want to try again soon"
"Overall I thought that this was a very good but not quite world class imperial stout. However I would drink it again."
"Update (2/17/14): Drinking a 2009 can. This ages unbelievably well. Holy crap."
"This Beast pours crude black, thick, thin, slow rising brown carbonation that only really forms as a thin ring around the glass, with some marbling on the surface..you know you are in for a treat when you pour it into your glass...huge sweet molassas nose, a bit of smoke,anise, dark chocolate...right up my alley...the first sip is intense charred malt, some bitter chocolate,molassas, smoke, no alchohol burn either forward or back...lingering bitter chocolate still...the mouth feel is formadable, heavy and chewy, a bit of a chore..but very satisfying...I must admit I love this beer..event though it's a sipper..."
"O: Who knew my favorite RIS to date comes in a can? I enjoyed the subtle nuances of this brew and I wish I had access to this beer 24/7."
"Thanks due again to beerbeerbeerbeer. Pours just like oil. Jet black, almost no head, some brown lacing. Smells very heavy of malt and roasts. Smells of coffee, toffee, and burnt sugar. Also smells a bit boozy. No booziness in the taste. HUGE malt, followed by coffee and a dryness on the finish. Almost no carbonation, very thick and full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth. A sipper despite the smoothness. This is almost over the top for me. I like it, but even a 12 ounce can is almost too much. It's just SO heavy. I find more drinkability in WWS than this. If ever I was curious as to what the inside of a black hole tasted like, this would be it. Very glad I got to try this. I'd like to get more and let it sit for a few years."
"O- This is a fantastic beer. Not the best RIS I've had, but it is really good. Highly recommended if you haven't checked it out."
"This is sold in four pack cans which is damn genius. Selling it in six pack cans would be stellar. This is something to add to your wants list if you ain't had it yet. Like their T-shirt says, ""fuh-CAN-eh!"""
"Probably my favorite imperial stout. So much complexity here to entertain the palate for the entire can of beer. If this beer weren't so available it would be considered on par with Dark Lord and other ""famous"" imperial stouts (in my opinion)"
"O: A really good offering, rich and roasty, with a touch less hops than I'm used to from a Russian Imperial Stout; however, its a good balance for me."
"Overall: Super-""Solid Brew"". Excellent lacing looks like something that came out of Spiderman."
"Overall, it's not too bad. I've had better Russian Imperial Stouts, and I was hoping for more from Oskar Blues. I would probably have enjoyed this more in the winter instead of summer. I'll revisit."
"Overall, a fantastic imperial stout, one of the best I've had. I really wish Oskar Blues distributed to Michigan..."
"Overall: Without a doubt this beer lives up to the hype. Who knew something so delectable could come from a can. I tip my hat to Oskar Blues because they sure have a winner RIS here. This is a ""must try"" for RIS fans. With all that said, one can of beer is plenty for this slow sipping 10.5%'er."
"O: Nice, but after half a glass I'd had enough. 4"
"O- Great example of an IRS. Heavy, alcoholic, black as night, delicous! A must try for any stout lover."
"A very nice stout that is decently priced."
"D-The ABV is only detectable in the mouthfeel as some warming but this a really easy drinking RIS... I'm sure it would catch up to you pretty quick if you had more than two of these."
"O- An incredible beer, one of the best Russian Imperials I've ever had. It's thick and hugely complex. If you had to survive in a cave wrapped in an animal skin this is the kind of beer that would keep you alive."
"O: Awesome beer. Just like drinking motor oil. Super complex all around. Top 10."
"O: Outstanding beer. One that has earned it's place on the beers of fame list. Mmmm. I have had this beer countless times, and have yet to have a bad experience."
"O: Was expecting something good, and not disappointed at all. If this were available in Iowa, I'd be getting it frequently. Meanwhile, I'll look forward to the next trip to a state where I can purchase. A really fine brew, get it and enjoy."
"Overall: Enjoyable, but more oxidation than I expected, especially from a canned beer."
"D-Overall this is a wonderful Russian imperial stout. Don't think i could drink more than one in a sitting. it really is a kick in the face. I love this brew and will get again and again. It would be perfect to take on a alaskan camping trip."
"Overall: Based on appearance and smell, I originally thought that I needed to set aside an hour or so to tackle this one, but it is actually very drinkable. Only downfall is the slight inconsistency in the flavor profile from start to finish. A superb example of the style. Damn, I wish I had more. Looks like I have a new ISO to post."
"This was a delicious sipper. Nice and complex."
"o-great treat at OB's. Really glad I had the chance to try this beer. Really good example of how this can age well in the keg. Hope it's still there next time I go!"
"This is right up there with many of the best imperial stouts I have had. So happy I have 3 more cans!"
"Overall – I've yet to see a beer that looked so syrupy while being poured. The appearance really does look like motor oil. The taste is well balanced and it would make a great winter warmer beer or after dinner drink. I'd buy it again."
"Overall: Fantastic brew! Everything melded nicely and the alcohol provides a nice little warming touch at the end. I could drink this everyday and never get tired of the complexities. Superb example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"O - really awesome like really really awesome lol"
"O/D-This one is great. I would not put this in the upper echelon of my top big stouts. Perhaps the alcohol is a bit too aggressive on the tongue. Nonetheless, this is beer is big and bold. Tastes great to boot. Finally knocked this one off the list."
"overall - kinda pricey (bought a single of this for $4.50, the 4pk was $16), but if you like RIS's, then this is a must try. Really good example of the style and comes in a can to boot! I'm usually skeptical of beers that get a lot of hype but this one lives up to expectation."
"I've had another can of this, and its even better, this is a beautiful imperial stout and I'll be sure to have cans of this sitting around the house."
"Can to pint. IT'S ALL GOOD! Appearance was good, but nothing special. No head to speak of. Can is still a turnoff too (I can't lie.). Smells and tastes of chocolate and espresso, with notes of caramel. Mouthfeel is as fluid as oil going town a funnel... A must-try!"
"This beer was very good but it is very potent. I could only see myself drinking one or two at the most because of how heavy it is and because of the alcohol content. I would highly recommend trying this one!"
"O - Really quite brilliant. The best canned imperial stout in the world! It holds its own against the greats of the category. While it'll never be Hunahpu or any of the other titans, it is definitely on the short list for best widely-available stout. If the price came down a bit, it'd be a big competitor for Old Raspy. At around 6.00 a can in NY, it's stupid expensive."
"Overall: This is a very good imperial stout and a good beer to give to people who swear by bottles and their seniority to cans. It’s everything I look for and like in a big stout."
"I had seen an article about this beer in a magazine a few weeks before I saw some at my local shop. The magazine was really talking it up so I had to give it a try. This beer pours out as black as a moonless night in an abandand coal mine. The thick black liquid chugs it's way out of the can as a dark brown head forms on top. The smell of the beer is very roasted and has just a touch of dark berry and hop aroma mix with a ton of molasses. The taste of the beer is very rich, it's deeply roasted with a subtle sweetness up front that fades into a burnt bitterness in the end. The taste in the middle is kind of earthy. The mouthfeel is very thick indeed. Overall it's a really damn good Russian Imperial Stout. really worth looking into."
"Overall.. This Russian Imperial is one of the few that all should be graded on. It's availability and reasonable cost should also play into it's overall score (IMO). I haven't even mentioned that it's out of a can!! WOW!! My advice to all you campers and hikers is, remember this one on your next outing and remember, ""pack it in, pack it out""."
"Overall a drinkable RIS that is a bit on the sweet side. Alcohol and chocolate really come on strong."
"A pretty solid Russian Imperial with its only real weak spot in the nose."
"O: This is a good beer but I am not seeing what is so spectacular here. I definitely wouldn't pay the $15 dollar price tag for a 4-pk, but not a bad stout overall."
"O- Excellent beer. A great purchase for a RIS lover! Fits to the category well and does not disappoint."
"Overall: quite a good Russian Imperial Stout. The fact that its in a can is definitely interesting. That said, its a little overhyped on this site. It doesn't measure up to other easily accessible and more affordable IRS's like Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout or Old Rasputin. Still, if you're a stout lover like me, I would give it a go. Cheers!"
"O - Pretty good RIS. Not my favorite and I don't really see the hype even though it is quite delicious."
"Like this but not in the same league as the other big ris."
"O- So glad I finally got some of this and that it lived up to my expectations. This is right next to Plead the 5th in my book. A fantastic brew."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a DFH Signature glass. This beer pours a thick,like old motor oil,jet black with the slightest dark tan head. There is virtually no carbonation. The aroma is heavy with lots of sweet fruits like black cherries and plums. There are also hints of chocolate and roasted malt. The brew has a deep roasted character,there a flavors of coffee grinds and expresso with a slight bitterness that gives way a little malty sweetness and dark chocolate on the finish .This beer is well balanced,no flavor really overpowers the rest. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a creamy texture and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. This is one fantastic drinking Imperial Stout. But this brew is no light weight. "
"I'm really impressed by this beer. I'd say it's the best year-round imperial stout I've had. No gimmicks, just a really good, solid, tasty beer. And the mouthfeel is amazing. Sure to become a staple."
"I don't want to rate this beer perfect, but I can't mark it down in any of the categories in good conscience. At $8 for 12 ounces that is a bit steep, but I'll gladly pay for a couple of snifters full to revisit this gem every winter."
"Poured out of a 12oz can into a Duvel snifter with no head at all. On the nose I get a ton of chocolate and some dried fruit, maybe a little prune. Upon first sip I'm hit with loads of smooth bitter chocolate and a nice malt sweetness. I'm left with a really nice lingering aftertaste. The alcohol doesnt seem to come through at all on this brew, and at 10.5 percent, that's saying something. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but the carbonation is lacking a bit. I don't expect a huge head for this style of brew, but this was a bit unexpected. In the end, the lack of carbonation on the brew really doesn't turn me off all that much, it's still a fantastic Imperial Stout. And, with the expansion of canned craft beer, I'm definitely excited to see more great brews like this one from Oskar Blues."
"I was hesitant to purchase a 4 pack of cans for fear of that tinny taste but this brew certainly withstands it and delivers very nicely. I would certainly recommend this to anyone Russian Imperial Stout fan or otherwise. Enjoy!!!"
"Whoa nellie! The menu said that ""there are few beers that make us say HOLY SHIT""...well, now I understand why the kind folks at Holy Smoke included that as part of the menu description. Let me state that I am NOT a huge fan of RIS. I'll try, and usually enjoy, anything; but if I had my pick, I'd go with a Kolsch. The RIS anti-thesis. But this beer blew me away. The head was so dark, heavy and rich that it gave off a purple hue. The color of the beer was as dark as anything I've ever seen. Smell was to die for. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, a good stout should have. Coffee, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramel. At 10.5, I wasn't knocked over by the smell or taste of alcohol. Smoooth...and the perfect ending to a fine BBQ meal and four tasting flight."
"Pours out thick and viscous, motor oil consistency, with a dark tan frothy layering that forms rather quickly, then fades to a wispy covering. Smells of raisin, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. Taste manages to mimic the aroma fairly well. Raisins and plums hit the palate in a thick caramel sweetened blast of flavor. Roasted malts and bakers chocolate manage to break through heavily, with a slightly smokey character. Slight astringency mingles with the hefty booze presence, followed by a hint of bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Coffee and toffee appear after each sip to accent tje slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Creamy character with moderate carbonation. Overall, this viscous oil like concoction is amazing and multifaceted. Layered with character and flavor, this RIS is sure to please."
"Overall - This is one of the best stouts I've ever had and I love showing it off to non craft drinkers. They all see can and think it's just like theirs and are BLOWN AWAY. I'd recommend this any day of the week."
"Pours and oily, pitch black, with a finger of dense brown head that laces nicely. Smell of coffee, ash, and licorice. Taste of dark roasted coffee, cocoa, licorice and molasses, with a rummy alcohol kick. Bitterness from the coffee notes lasts into the aftertaste. Full body and good drinkability. Very good stout."
"Ten Fidy pours a very dark color, and almost looks like its motor oil. This beer is amazing from the beginning to the finish. The smell and mouthfeel are incredibly strong and are certainly the highlights of this beer. The taste is much sweeter than I expected, but towards the finish it becomes much more bitter. There is a mocha/caramel sweetness to Ten Fidy that I haven't had in any other stout. Definitely one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had."
"O- A very well made RIS that is insanely drinkable given its ABV. This beer is immensely smooth and creamy as well. Definitely something I will have various vintages of at all times in my fridge and cellar."
"Overall - Very impressive beer out of a can! This one is definitely a sipper and may get you in trouble if not careful as it hides the alcohol very well."
"O: Wow, always impresses me. I try to forget about it but I cant. Dark and sexy. Sweet and salty. Amazing. I love that you can always get your hands on this beer."
"Overall an excellent example of an imperial stout."
"Thanks again to woodychandler for yet another beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of chocolate. Taste also has malts and chocolate, hops are definatly present, a hint of sweetness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O: A spot-on imperial stout. Definitely one of the best I've had in the style."
"A very good beer out of a can!"
"O - Some snobs or critics might tear this beer apart, but I really really really like it."
"Pours a viscous black with a layer of dark brown and orangeish foam which almost completely dissipates within a few minutes. Smell is dark cocoa, roasted malt, and as it warms, coffee. Very good stuff. The taste has similar flavors, with a long finish, tinge of bitter sweetness, and a little heat (though not much considering the ABV). Smooth mouthfeel, with light carbonation on a medium-full body. Overall, this is a pretty straightforward, excellent, well balanced stout."
"Delightful stout and definitely pushes the extremes of its class in both alcohol content and flavor (which is an impressive feat). I love the feeling of just pouring this motor oil black beverage. The price is also fairly reasonable at $4 a can (if I were paying that in a bar...call the ambulance). Lastly, I am a fan of can packaging over glass, just a personal preference!"
"O- Overall, this is a great brew and I still can't believe it came out of a can. The beer tastes better as it warms up. I would definitely grab more of this again as it is very drinkable."
"Ah, canned beer, the best thing since the best thing before sliced bread so what the wheel? All things being even this is a bit too big and sugary for me. If I wanted something this sweet I’d eat things like cake. So now I think I need to go run and go no carb for a month to make up for this glass. Still extra points for canning as nothing is better than pouring a beer from a can into a snifter!"
"Picked up a can of this while traveling. Chilled in the hotel ice bucket and poured into the hotel cup. Not ideal but I really wanted to drink it. Pours jet black with a small dark tan head. The smell is chocolatey with some molasses and some general sweetness. A little alcohol. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, a little vanilla toffee and heaven. Coats your mouth and hangs for a bit and finishes with a little bitter to balance out the sweet. So good, would be dangerous if I had access to this all the time."
"O: This goes directly into the top 10 Imperial stouts that I've had list. Quite amazing, and the most complex and stunning thing about this is the nose."
"This is the second time I've had this beer, both times from a growler. This is truly an amazing beer! Thanks to my buddy Matt S. for hauling this back for me."
"O - Overall this beer dominates the style. Everything about it is wonderful except that I would only drink one at time for inebriation purposes and because of how thick and filling it is. This is definitely a winter brew."
"Pours an extremely thick black color with a 1 inch super dark khaki head that fades to an oily cap on the top of the beer. Chunky dark khaki streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and dark fruits. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark cocoa powder, dark fruits, and slight coffee on the finish. Very little bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and creamy. Probably one of the thickest beers I have ever had. Overall, this is an awesome RIS and my favorite beer from Oskar Blues."
"O-> Overall, I'm really not sure why this beer garners so much of the praise it receives. Maybe it is better fresh? Or with more age on it? Not sure. What I am sure of is that this was far too bitter for my liking and way too overdone on the chocolate. I didn't get any of the coffee notes others were finding. I wanted to like this, I really did as I enjoy Imperial Stouts quite bit...I just couldn't force myself to enjoy it....it got a little less harsh on the bitter chocolate as it warmed but then the booze just took the reigns from there. Either something was up with my can or I just don't care for this brew. Different folks have different tastes and I just don't share others infatuation with this beer...I can think of a handful of RISs that I would rather have for less dough. I will have to revisit this in the next winter but for the absolutely absurd price I really don't feel compelled to do so..."
"Overall. Pretty good above average stout, not sure if its worth the price point but I am not a large fan of stouts."
"The mouthfeel is extremely thick and full bodied, with a light, yet noticeable amount of carbonation.. Absolutely perfect for the style. The drinkability is absurd for the ABV, this goes down way easier than the 10.50% on the can claims. A superlative RIS from Oskar Blues. Seriously. Drink this. It's so good."
"TenFIDY sips like a big heavy glass of toasted grains and syrup finishing up with a taste rather like fresh biscuits. It's incredibly sweet--much more so than I was expecting. This isn't one of the sharply bitter imperial stouts with the emphasis placed on the charred barley; this brew has a softer side. Full-bodied. The epitome of a big, thick stout."
"Overall, pretty good impy stout but that metal taste was a bit off-putting. I would like to try this fresh to see if there is a difference."
"O/D: Easy to drink for it's ABV. Great in oatmeal when backpacking."
"Overall, I like it, wouldn't pay for another 4 pack but I like alot... Also I loved the can, just saying..."
"Quite possibly the best beer I've ever had out of a can (with Surly Furious as the competition). If I were to dream up an imperial stout with all my favourite elements, I don't think it would end up too far off what Ten Fidy tastes like. Wish I had easier access to this, I'll be buying a bunch of this next chance I get. Thanks a ton viggo!"
"Pours from the 12 oz. can a thick, dark viscous black (yes, just like used motor oil) with minimal tan head that quickly fades into a light collar. I'm holding it up to the brightest lamp in the room, and absolutely NONE of the light penetrates this beer! Aroma is surprisingly faint, but has hints of unsweetened dark chocolate & black coffee. 1st sip is surprisingly sweet...more dark chocolate, black coffee, malt roasted almost to the point of being ""burnt", and a slight hint of smoke. On the swallow, there is a bitterness of alcohol and the the dark chocolate/coffee notes with a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, silky, and thick...the consistency of syrup or honey. Overall? Two words...simply amazing! This is the best beer I have ever had up to this point, and I want more!!!"
"Notes- This thing assaulted my taste buds. holy crap. The stickiness, which is something I love in a stout, sticks around forever. This being in a can, It will be interesting to see how this ages. Will be holding on the other 3 of the 4 pack for a good long while. although, not drinking them will be a challenge...."
"O - Excellent flavorful and complex RIS. If you like sweet strong stouts It doesn't get much better than this in my opinion. Priced at about $8 a pour at Frisco its not an everyday beer. I may have to go our an buy some cans of this to keep around. It's too good to ignore."
"O: This beer has a great appearance and mouthfeel. The unbalanced sweetness and the tamari put me off. I occasionally pick up miso/tamari/soy sauce in roasty imperial stouts, but this was way too much. [On a later occasion, I sniffed some actual soy sauce while drinking the beer, and that helped me break the soy sauce association somewhat. It didn't help me enjoy the beer any more, though.]"
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the aroma and the general drinkability. A common theme throughout this tasting was that this beer is highly boozy. They don’t try to hide this point, but rather play to it. In the aroma the fusels are well integrated into the heavy, dark malts, while in the taste, there is enough push from the background to keep it from being unmanageable. Each sip brings a stickiness to the lips, with generous coating throughout the mouth. All of these characteristics help to bring the beer to its full potential, and make it greatly enjoyable all around."
"O: Pretty good, not the best I have had, but very good. The flavors blend quite nicely, if the finish was a little less bitter it would be spot on."
"O- Really like this beer. Its a nice stout and the smokiness is refreshing."
"D: An excellent example of a RIS, goes down smooth, a great dessert beer and a something that would be perfect in front of a campfire. Highly recommended."
"I'm going to have to get a fresh can and compare the batches cause i read that some changes were made."
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"sweet sweet Jesus..2006 on tap at The Gate. Beautiful. Some sweet roastiness in full midnight. The bitterness of the brew is still solid, all flavor hops faded totally removed. Some chocolate and coffee behind the roasty bitter. Very good with this age on it. The bitterness finally balances the rest of the beer out. The more recent batches seem to have been way too heavy on the roast but this one is right on."
"-Cheers"
"The very definition of a dessert beer, very sweet, chocolately, creamy and even some booze to warm the stomach. Love it."
"I had high expectations for my first time trying this and they were easily exceeded. This is by far one of the if not the best RIS I've ever had. It doesn't destroy your palate with gigantic, mouth puckering notes of one thing or another. Instead, it's extremely well balanced through and through while still being incredibly flavourful. I'll have no problem buying this again, and again, and again."
"Pours a motor oil black out of the can. Milk chocolate brown colored head which quickly gives way. Aroma of coco beans, dark cherry and roasted marshmallow. Flavor is outstanding. Dark cherries, coffee beans and the slightest hint of crisp hops to start. Beer quickly moves onto huge rushes of roasted chocolate, cream and marshmallow. Molasses as it warms. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Excellent, drinkable RIS. Alcohol is dangerously hidden."
"This RIS leans more toward the dark fruit side than dark chocolate, but there's plenty of both. Overwhelming amounts of flavor as you'd expect from the style. Highly roasted and the high ABV is well masked."
"Overall a very tasty brew, highly recommended."
"No doubt this belongs up there w/ the best stouts."
"O: This is a really good beer. There's nothing new with that. I'm still quite surprised on how much more balanced the beer is versus the idea I had after smelling it. Very drinkable even considering the massive body of the beer. No alcohol in sight. A must try considering it's only 4$ a can."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is every bit of full bodied; thick, chewy and creamy. Everything an imperial stout should be. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Overall, a very good imperial stout that I'd love to have full time access to. Very unique and pretty tasty."
"D - as if 10.5% alcohol wasn't enough reason to take your time with this beer, the depth and complexity rewards contemplation."
"O - This is a delicious imperial stout, that has some serious heft behind it. The name is completely apropos cause it looks and pours like used motor oil. Its wonderfully balance, and the high ABV is well hidden other than the fact that i has a nice warming effect. I'm glad this is so easily available to me. I will definitely buy this again and again."
"drinkability: this one is a sipper, very full flavored and intense. if youre not experienced with this bad boy, take it slow."
"O- Good Imp Stout. I could drink it every day."
"Overall Ten Fidy was a pleasant experience. It's not the best imperial stout that I've imbibed but it is certainly a good one. I could wish for a heavier mouthfeel and a longer lasting head, but when push comes to shove what really matters is the taste. In that respect, Ted Fidy delivers. It's a high alcohol brew and the cans are not cheap so you will not likely be sessioning this one. But as a dessert beer it is a fine selection. The winner and still canned beer champion: Ten Fidy!"
"Finally, MY first Ten Fidy! This beer pours like a champ. It's a black viscous potpourri of dark roasts, milk chocolate, and coffee. Generic adjectives yes, generic presentation of the aromas, no. The flavors are of roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and sweet chocolate. It isn't as well blended as it could be. This beer drinks exceptionally smooth, almost too smoothly. It's very tasty and a fine stout out of a can. I do like it and I'd recommend it."
"Overall very nice and surprising. Could be a bit cheaper at $5.50 per can. But supremely tasty."
"I'd definitely buy more of this. Must be nuts on tap."
"Overall...this beer is fantastic, big and rich with a lot of great texture, beautiful aromas, sweet balanced with bitterness and roasted malts..."
"Overall - My first canned beer... (craft.) Very good!"
"12oz can dated 10/12/10. Pours extremely dark, blacker than any other beer I've seen. Dark brown head that fades quickly. Aroma of molasses, dark fruits, roasted malts, and chocolate. Taste has more chocolate, malty sweetness, and a touch of coffee. I would've liked a little more bitterness. Thick chewy body with light carboation. Alcohol is well integrated. While it's not the best Imperial Stout I've had, it's still good stuff. I wish more stouts were available in cans like this."
"O: Best RIS I've ever had from a can! Pretty solid overall. Heavy, but balanced."
"Hides the alcohol very well. Complex, and the quality comes through. A pleasure to sip. Props for packing it in; I pack it out."
"Overall good beer, pretty easy drinking for 10.5%"
"D- Ten FIDY may be the best canned experience in the history of craft beer. A roasty candy-like experience in a can. Although there is a slight sting of alcohol at the end, there is way too much drinkability to not give the brew credit. What a great brew that will be a camping staple if I can get some"
"O - Very solid overall. The can I had was about 5 months old. Will hold on to the others to see how this ages."
"D - A nice solid RIS by Oskar Blues, another beer I wish I could get in Hawaii and have all the time. High abv is very will hidden, and could be dangerous if I had the other three cans."
"Pour a beautiful, motor oil black. A great chocolate brown head forms and lasts for about a minute before crawling back into the rest of the beer. This beer has a great lacing on the sides with every drink. The smell is very complicated. I get a strong smell of chocolate, a little bit of coffee, and a strong alcohol smell. Strong taste of chocolate and alcohol. The 10.50% really shines, but that isn't such a bad thing. Mouthful is very good. Decent carbonation and very thick, just like a stout should be. Very good offering by Oskar Blues. Looking forward to drinking one more and then letting the other age for a bit to let the alcohol wear down."
"O: Overall a decent RIS,a little boozy but I'm not complaining,I would drink it again."
"M/O - With a super thick mouth and complex flavors, Ten FIDY is a great sipping, after dinner brew. Insanely complex and a joy to drink. Please do yourself a favor and get ahold of this beer!"
"O: A great RIS! I think it coming from a can makes it even better. I have never seen a beer pour like that! Really thought I was adding oil to my car,"
"same appearance, aroma is a bit smokey, less sweet than the 1 year. taste is a bit more earthy and subdued. smoke and cocao flavors are more subtle. same body and mouthfeel. overall, the 1 and 2 year are different, but I have a hard time deciding which is better."
"O - A truly insane stout. This beer is delicious and addicting all while being ruthless and mean, punching you in the mouth and face. Get this beer."
"Very drinkable, considering the thickness and ABV, but I probably couldn't drink more than one can of it."
"This beer pours the blackest I have ever seen, with very little tan head with no lacing. The aroma is strong with roasted malt and some sweetness. The taste starts with chocolate malt and then goes to strong malty sweet flavor and then finishes sour. The mouthfeel is veltvety with a slight bit of burn. Overall worth a try if you afford the price."
"D - Overall very drinkable, although perhaps a little heavy flavor and alcohol wise to drink a lot of."
"Overall-Amazing beer. I'm lucky to have found this. Easy to drink for 10.50% and balanced perfectly. I'm going back tommorow to get whatevers left. Funny thing is the guy who worked there said it was a combination of Vodka and Motor Oil tasting. I wasn't sure why he would tell a customer that but still bought it. Glad I did. Happy St. Pattys Day."
"O: Alcohol is well hidden in the taste and nose. World class, delicous. Love this beer."
"Yes, this is my favorite Imperial Stout. EVER!! I think I like it better canned than on tap, and definitely better than the whisky-barreled version."
"This is a solid RIS, with great chocolate and roasted malt flavors and aromas, and subtle dark fruit character to back those up. As far as RIS in a can goes, this is boss. Bravo."
"Poured black with a dark tan hide head that rises nice and slow. Smelled like wet tin cans. Flavor is a rush of sweet toasty malt, followed by warm alcohol down the back of the throat. Just the right amount of carbonation, wet drink. Drinkable, but not leaving me yearning for more. Overall a good beer, but stay away if you don't like this style."
"A little pricey as usual, but worth it without a doubt. Just not an everyday beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Finally got to try this, and all I can say is WOW! This is one heavy hitter of a stout. Not for the novice beer drinker, but a rare treat for an avid BA."
"Bought 4 of these hoping to age 3 of them, but enjoyed the first one so much I had to go back for seconds with dessert. I've heard great things about aging in cans so I'll leave 2 in the cellar to enjoy later."
"So rich and smooth that the alcohol is undetectable."
"D - Great overall. A bit too malty for my preference, but no downgrades for that. One or two of these in a sitting it plenty for me due to the sweetness."
"D- I have 2 left. I want to drink them now. This beer surpassed my expectations. I've only had a couple OB beers, but it's no wonder they're growing so rapidly, and it's not just the cans. These are some high quality brews. Ten Fidy can hold its own against any stout out there."
"Drinkability is great. Hard to put down, hard to notice the ABV until afterwards."
"P.S. Take a big swig of this right from the can, it will scramble your expectations concerning 12oz cans wonderfully."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer.My favorite style,I'm going to cellar some of this I think it will be badass All RIS lovers this is a must try, great job Oscar Blues."
"Pours from the can like motor oil into large snifter. About a quarter inch of chocolaty head which quickly dissipates leaving islands of residual lacing on the glass... This beer is sexy. Smells of molasses, chocolate, raisins intermixed with slight alcohol vapors. Tastes of sweet chocolaty malt, molasses, raisins, coffee, slight soy with a touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and thick with the perfect touch of carbonation, this beer begs to be sipped and enjoyed slowly."
"putting this on the record as the best RIS that i've had between DFH WWS, Old Rasp. & this"
"D- This beer is dangerous. Between the delicate aromas, powerful flavor and high alcohol content you'd think this would be a slow sipper to appreciate and move on but then POW! You've had 3 or 4 and you're face is numb. I'm fairly certain that feisty stout is about as much fun in a can as you can have."
"Full bodied, softer carbonation, rich sticky texture with slight chewiness. Drinks nicely, the flavor and feel is excellent. I've had this aged and fresh; I think its safe to say I prefer it on the fresher side."
" I was really looking forward to this beer and I found it to be an amazing canned product but not on par with the hype. Bitterness is creeping and doesn't mesh well with on the finish with other competing harsh flavors."
"D: So far it's the best beer I've ever had, drink one but prepare yourself for it. If you don't like it, it may just be too much for you."
"Drinkability. Grabs your attention and holds on to it for a while. Not a fast drinker but it doesn't get boring either. Good for the style."
"D: Overall a very drinkable RIS, but maybe that is a bad thing (reflected in my taste score)."
"drinkability is good. not outstanding. not sure what the hype is about. not a benchmark as far as RIS goes. good, not great."
"Would try again. Solid Russian imperial stout. Good buy to pick up."
"Speaking of those, Mouthfeel is ridiculously thick and creamy, and the foaming of the beer when swished around in the mouth adds to it immensely. Syrupy and viscous too, which is awesome for the style. Drinkability is crazy good, as the abv is flat out not there, and the coating this one leaves after each sip is delectable. I will say that the pure roasted character of this beer can get to be a bit much, but not for a while. Love this beer."
"A-4, S-4.5, T-4, M-4.5, D-4"
"The appearance of this beer is quite dark, if I hold it up to the light I can see very very feint mahogany/purple hues on the very edges of the glass. That being said, it is almost pitch black. The head is a dark tan, almost brown head comprised of lots of tiny bubbles. The aroma is hoppy more than anything else. I pick up earth tones with a roasty malt background. Taste is fantastic! Big on roastyness with subtle coffee/espresso and chocolate flavors. Texture is thick, and I mean THICK.. like syrup! good carbonation but it's almost unnoticeable because your palate is adjusting to the syrupy quality of this beer. For drinkability I would have to give it a lower rating due to the high 10.5% ABV and texture. This is a sipping beer."
"I love Ten FIDY stout from Oskar Blues! You really need to drink this with some heavy food like pizza or pasta. This is not for the faint of heart. Really thick, heavy flavors, almost thick like syrups. One of my favorites, but super hard to find. You get a nice molasses flavor going on with some hints of burnt caramel."
"Cheers"
"This is a slow sipping beer and an ear and face warmer, to be sure. It is not one that I would ever think of having several of in a sitting, simply because it is so heavy. It is, however, a beer that I would be thrilled to have from time to time."
"DRINKABILITY: This was unquestionably the best, most memorable Russian Imperial Stout I've tasted. This is definitely a sipping beer, but by the end I found myself wishing I could stay for another. Such repeatability in a big beer like this is rare, at least for me. The brewmaster deserves high praise indeed for melding the flavors so as to make this a relatively smooth, easy drinking beer. Would I buy it again? In a New York minute!"
"Drinkability - This would be a nice dessert beer right along side a piece of german chocolate cake. However, I can't see drinking more than one in a night."
"It's just a great example of the style. If you haven't already, put it on you ""beers to try"" list."
"D: unbelievably drinkable beer for a beer with an abv north of 10%. This is a world class imperial stout and it's crazy that I poured it out of a can."
"Wow, what a beer! This is up there with Stone IRS and BCS as one of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had. Rich flavor, full body, great mouthfeel. This is a high quality brew."
"Overall a nice, surprising beer, flavorful if not exceptional."
"Drink- It's big from a small can. I could see myself drinking all 4, blacking out and asking WTF just happened? Very tasty beer though."
"D: thick, rich, and delicious. a little lighter on the carbonation then im used to for the style, but works well on such a meaty body. i know i said this would be a great dessert beer, but right now im using it as an appetizer and loving it. get some."
"Yowee. (Again, for good measure)."
"M/D - This has one of the thickest bodies of any beer I've had. It works though. Ten FIDY is incredibly rich and therefore it's a definite dessert beer and drinkability is pretty low."
"Final thoughts: This is a definite must for any imperial stout fan. This beer is worth every penny of the five dollars I paid for it. I will certainly buy a few more cans to age."
"Cheers!"
"This goes down way too smoothly, with very well hidden alcohol. Even so, the intensity of flavor and fullness of body makes this a definite sipper."
"D- Everything about this beer makes it easily drinkable. If not for the heat this would be quaffable. I think the appearance could've been a lot better had I driven home more carefully, but I blame PA roads. Great tasting, sweet aromas, and superb mouthfeel."
"I could have 2 of these, but I'm not sure about more."
"Drinkability: The flavor sticks with you and does not demand the next drink. Still there is nothing stopping you. It's rich without being overwhelming. You can sip on this for an evening, or it can be a candidate in a evening filled with drinking assuming the other offerings aren't quite as tall."
"Drinkability - It's a great beer, but I would probably only have about 2 in a single session."
"D: Best canned beer I've ever had. A great stout for a nice cool evening when you just want some but not a 22 oz. love it."
"D: Not too bad. More than a can or two would be too much."
"D: One is more than enough. I love sippers and Ten Fidy definitely falls in that category, but it is such a massive beer that I labored for at least two hours to get through 12 ounces."
"Mouthfeel is thick and rich with a low/moderate carbonation that allows everything here to sit, settle, and linger. I wish more stouts achieved this sensation."
"Poured from a can like a batch of motor oil, the beer is jet black, and just looks thick. There was a thin, chocolate colored head that lasted about thirty seconds, and then it retreated to just a ring of film. The beer has aromas of coffee and toffee, but also some booze. The flavors are milk chocolate, coffee, and smoke. Some bits of sweet malt/molasses and some bitter characteristics, as well, and of course a bit of alcohol. As it warms, you get some dark fruity sweet flavors, also. The beer is heavy and thick in mouth. Very viscous and lingering in the mouth, which is fantastic given the amazing flavor combination. The finish is creamy and smooth, despite the alcohol flavors. Aftertaste of bitter coffee. The beer is extremely smooth and easy to drink, and fabulous on a cold night. Great dessert beer, also!"
"D: Absolutely enjoyable through-and-through. This is everything an RIS should be, and is widely available. The price is a bit high, but I kind of like that. I can only imagine what would happen to my waistline if this stuff was affordable..."
"Overall, I prefer the fresh can but the aged one is by no means bad. I enjoy the hoppy and coffee flavors of the fresh beer more than the smooth, chocolaty flavors of the aged. Both are good, though."
"considering it's in a can, this might be the greatest backpacking beer ever. campfire cooked steak, pull a ten-fiddy out of the cold spring? yeah, that'd work."
"D:This had a can date of 12/10/09 and you can tell it smoothed out a lot since there was no hint of alcohol and was very easy to drink. Big flavors come thru and make this a good drink."
"Pours a dark motor oil black with nice 1/2"" dark tan head that dissipates in a few minutes leaving mild sticky lacing behind. Smells of chocolate, soy sauce, sweet, caramel and a bit of smoke. Tastes of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted, the soy flavor shows through but not too overbearing or anything. The mouthfeel was a bit flat and thin, leaves a lot to be desired. Besides the mouthfeel this beer was amazing, oskar blues does not disappoint with this beastly beauty, drinkability could not be better."
"D - 9.5% will reduce drinkability a bit, but this a well crafted RIS.Nice combination of earthy and slightly sweet with just enough hops. Been wanting to try this one for awhile and was not disappointed in the least. Excellent."
"D - The drinkability is quite good. The flavor is great, and it has a smooth velvety feel. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. This is a really good beer, and I recommend trying it. This was my first craft beer in a can. Delicious."
"Ten Fidy is chocolate like bittersweet, slightly acidic, and rich, with sweetness coming (seemingly) more from alcohol than from sugars. Low on carbonation, high on silkiness, the roast doesn't affect the thick mouthfeel negatively. A very delicious aftertaste of roasted coffee beans lingers after a medium finish. Could and would drink more of it. Good stuff!"
"Taste matches the aroma nicely. Rich balance of the sweetness is matched be an assertive bitterness. Something else pops as i contemplate this one further. Anise or black licorice comes through rather subtly as I swish. Finishes with a lingering bitterness that is both pleasant and restrained."
"While I'd never describe the heavyweights of this category to be highly ""drinkable," Ten FIDY does what it needs to do to avoid demerits here: it hides its alcohol reasonably well, doesn't overwhelm the palate with repeated sips and doesn't smother you with its oil-slick consistency. Unlike some extreme stouts, it lets you move on to another beer."
"Mouthfeel was thick and viscous in both with moderate carbonation. Both of these are enjoyable, and I'd like to try it against one that is really fresh, but it seems that once Ten Fidy hits the 2 year mark, it really smooths out and takes things to the next level."
"D-Still one of my favorite RIS. Thick and delicious, very nice full mouth feel, one of the more important aspects for me in these beers."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Well rounded in flavor and complex. The initial pour was insane, I have never seen such a black beer. Kudos to Oskar Blues for this finely crafted beer."
"Poured a muddy black with a very small medium brown creamy head that was fully diminishing and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of burnt cereal malts and a leathery doughy yeast with notes of dark chocolate, coffee and an mild alcohol scent. It tasted sweetly bitter with a coffee flavor at first and finished with a nice bitter-smooth flavor of coffee and chocolate that stayed with you for a nice while. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a GREAT Imperial stout, lots of flavor and no taste of the high alcohol content."
"Poured incredibly thick and syrupy and was difficult to get a head on it but when I did it looked great. Black as night. Smelled of powdered ovaltine then as it warmed it smelled of twizzlers/licorice. Tasted good, with a present ethanol burn which was a little off putting. Felt great, thick and present not very drinkable for me."
"D - Awesome. Oskar Blues proves yet again that beer in cans does not have to be bad!"
"This is what I would describe as a perfect example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"But I am marching, glass in hand, into the dark"
"D: The whole RIS in a can is an interesting concept, typically if I drink out of a can (hardly ever) you see a light colored beer, not an oil colored one. That being said, this is an excellent beer."
"d 4-4.5 flavorful as it is, it needs every bit to keep from being overtaken by its body. needs the touch of acidity in the finish, needs every degree of roast, etc. makes me think this beer is probably best fresh. ten fidy is dangerously gulpable (and this coming from a certified hater of most stouts)--could use a few more bittering hops to slow me down if for no other reason. the degree of roast is just fine. i actually would love to try this with a little bit more bitterness--uber fresh, perhaps?"
"What an RIS! This has taken the classic stout to a new level of perfection."
"Pours a thick black with a dark tan finger thick foamy head. Nose is smooth coffee and chocolate, roasted malts, burnt and toasted. Taste is smooth on the palatte. Cocoa flavour upfront then a slight bitter bite which smooths into a dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel, medium to heavy body. Good drinkabiliry, well hidden ABV. Not sure I agree with the can appeal here and quite pricey for a four pack. Glad to try it though, great beer!"
"D: Not to sweet, not too bitter, carbonated perfectly. Imperial or not, this is way too easy to drink. I'm in trouble."
"Poured out of a can into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with the consistency of motor oil. That experience alone lets you know this beer is to be respected. Smells of licorice and molasses. Mouthfeel is very thick, almost chewy, but still lends itself to be very drinkable. While thick, the alcohol content is still present along with licorice, molasses, and espresso flavors. This is a sipping beer and in my opinion the epitome of what an imperial stout should be. I've enjoyed this beer cold and at room temperature, and found it's opened up more at room temperature balanced with a frosty pint glass. This beer demands your attention and respect."
"Pours a deep dark black color with a thick brown russet head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is low because of the heavy booze flavors."
"D-I dig this."
"D: Quite drinkable; the sweetness of the beer when it was cold was a bit much, but around room temperature everything is very enjoyable."
"D - I finally had the chance to try this and it was pretty good...I don't think it lived up to its hype for me...but don't get me wrong it's delicious...and I couldn't see having more than one since it's 10.5%"
"I love the thick viscous body this has, virtually no carbonation, I almost want to call this chewy. Given the ABV, this is really drinkable, but on the filling side."
"D= I would only want to have a couple but that kind of goes with this style of beer."
"D- Good drinkability despite the chewy thickness. This is a soul warmer. I would love to try a fresh one of these."
"Pitch black pour with a thick tan head. Very reminiscent of a cup of espresso (in appearance). Aroma really opens up the instant I poured it into the glass. Roasted barley is obviously present with some notes of dark cherries, very slight salty soy sauce, and charred wood. Flavor is very roasty, sweet, with similar flavor notes to the nose. Molasses and some espresso dark chocolate cake present as well. Finish is sweet with some earthy, floral hop notes. I really enjoy this beer: always have eve since I got into craft beer. Just wish the price was the same as it was when i first discovered it."
"D: A sipper for sure. A very well done Imperial Stout"
"0- overall this beer hits me with a ton of great flavor. I really want to try more oskar blues beers so that I can get more of this quality. What a world class beer."
"D - Tough with this big a beer to level set for the style, but I'd say it's as ""drinkable"" as a huge RIS should be."
"Love this beer. Try it."
"O: I have to give this a SOLID A- on this. Awesome canned RIS"
"Poured from can into snifter. Pours as black as used oil when you have an oil change, viscous, opaque, dark brown head that falls and turns into a ring, lacing. Aroma gives off roasted malt, molasses, candied fruits, hops quite present, strong coffee, dark chocolate, liquorice, light pepper, light alcohol, light smoke. Mouthability is thick, viscous, roasted malt, lots of resinous hops, dark chocolate, strong coffee, molasses, liquorice, light pepper, light alcohol, light smoke, finale in roasted malt with a big presence of hops, quite astringent, quite bitter, full body, oily texture, not much carbonation; overall: quite good but not enough to make my top stout list."
"Drinkability - The alc is very hard to notice, I really could drink this all the time if it was available."
"You've gotta look past the can appearance, what hides inside is golden... Well, black really.."
"Dark chocolate goes especially well with imperial stouts, and this is easily going to be the best pairing with Ten FIDY. A chocolate ricotta pie is a really delicious treat anytime, but an intense stout will compliment the creamy, richness of the pie. Use high quality dark chocolate and farmstead ricotta if you can, then you'll never eat a regular cheesecake again. If you would prefer a savory pairing, try it with a chocolate mole sauce over duck. I never said it had to be dessert... it's the chocolate that matters!"
"D - At 10.5%, I wouldn't have more than two, but for the style, this is excellent, I will go back for another."
"Such a great surprise. I got a few cans for christmas and I've been enjoying it like crazy. Also my 1st craft beer in a can."
"12 oz. can that is over two years old; brewed with flaked oats, two-row, chocolate and roasted malts and hopped to 98 IBUs. It pours very thickly, deep black, with a tiny collar of dark tan foam that leaves a bit of lacing. Lots of hops in the nose give way to very roasty dark malts that contribute bitter chocolate, coffee and blackberry. The flavor starts with charred malt, almost too much so, with tobacco and old leather that then moves to green, citric and spicy hops which shift the balance too far to the bitter and hoppy. Very thick and full, dry and rich, with a long bitter finish. The alcohol is very well-hidden, but this style should be more about the malts than the flavor and bitterness of the hops."
"...first review in a while so may be a little biased"
"Every sip is a treat, though by sip 6 or so I was pretty drunk."
"0 - This is a great transitional brew that really opens up as it warms in your hand. If Oskar Blues operated oil rigs, the next Gulf Coast spill would have Texas paying OB billions of dollars, and the international outcry would be replaced by an elated global cheer."
" Final thought - If you haven't had one, try it."
"Pours from the can an inky, dark opaque black, through which no light can shine. Minimal amount of light brown head. Big aromas of alcohol, roasted malts, anise and black licorice. On the palate, full bodied and rich, lightly carbed, with flavors of alcohol, bourbon, dark chocolate and roasted malt. Maybe the best canned beer I've had."
"Cheers!"
"D-a delicious Imperial Stout, aged well. i'd have another, but not in the same sitting."
"D - Very drinkable I would say, great tasting and not to much alcohol."
"Drinkability: I could tell after the first sip that this was a beer I could drink all night. Well balanced, without going too strongly in any direction, I am glad I have a four pack of this."
"Great, great stuff. I would encourage aging this as I have tried it numerous times and it definitely gets better with age."
"Ten Fidy drinks quite well for its size and strength. I did not detect any alcohol and aside from the thick and coating nature it has, I found this to be very drinkable. It is a little different than your usual imperial stout. This is a beer that I will certainly re-visit."
"Absolutely delicious and very drinkable; this one is up there with my favorite RIS's."
"And out of a CAN!"
"Drinkablility: Very drinkable! Alcohol is well hidden. But, it shows up later and makes its self know when you finish drinking the entire beer."
"The CPJ"
"D- Extremely easy to drink. No alcohol burn."
"Taste is outstanding. Bitter chocolate and roasted malt, caramel and little molasses sweetness. Great body and mouthfeel that coats the tongue, with a slightly sweet, chocolately finish."
"I served this at a football watching party, populated by those who drink that unnamed tastless pablum. Most turned their noses up just watching it pour into small sampling cups. I found this brew smooth, complex with chocolate and carmel aftertastes. Not sure I'd drink more than 2 at a sitting, but definitely worth putting on the list when sampling and comparing with Other Imperial Stouts."
"Pitch black with a dark brown head and high retention. I smell and taste dark chocolate since it has a little sweet kick to it. It goes down smooth with no alcohol burn at the end which can be pretty dangerous with the ABV being 10.5% This is a great stout, if you have a chance to try this try it!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. can. Sampled on January 15, 2011. The pour is a deep,dark black with hints of syrup hues when held to the light. It builds to a two-inch, fluffy brown head that takes its time to settle but never goes away. The aroma is full of chocolate malts and black cherry fruitiness. A nice full body to tease the palate. The taste is magnificent with its soft chocolate maltiness making way to a distant background of hops. Its higher ABV is virtually unnoticed. What a wonderful beer and one of the best I have ever had."
"Conclusion- Toughest looking stout I have ever seen. The Ten Fidy looks like you're getting ready to be beat into a gang. It's a no bullshit stout. It just about stained my pint glass. It turns Guinness into bud light, and makes all other stouts into it's prison bitch. If Old Rasputin is the pretty alpha whore, Ten Fidy is Clint Eastwood."
"D: The beer definitely tastes like it is strong, but nowhere near 10.5% because the alcohol is well masked."
"This is my first review since I joined, and the only reason I wrote it is that i found this beer to be so enjoyable, that I simply HAD to write one."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV, I'm impressed."
"D- A solid, easy to drink RIS. Don't let the fact that it is in a can foul you into thinking it is a lower quality beer, it's not. I will get this again when I am looking for a chocolate flavored stout."
"There's a slight nutty taste, and a pleasant sweetness with a slight hop bite. My slight ding on ""appearance"" stems from the imprint of the ""Ball"" logo on the can."
"Overall, for how thick it is, this is an extremely drinkable beer. For those who aren't fond of the thickest of beers, I'd advise to steer clear, because this syrupy monster almost needs to be cut with a knife. Overall an extremely fabulous beer. Oskar Blues never ceases to amaze me!"
"Drinkability- i would never know it was 10.5 percent. Very drinkable"
"This beer is like a milkshake in a beer can. What I mean is that it is very drinkable as far as the 10.5 ABV, but after you finish one it feels like you just drank a milkshake especially if you had any food at all with it. I do like this beer a lot, but after having it a few times whether it is out of a can on tap or from a growler, I highly recommend someone just having this for the night and sipping it to truly enjoy what this beer has to offer. I also wish it was slightly more affordable than $14.99 per 4 pack."
"Great RIS from OB, very worth trying and seeking it out."
"drinkability - while this is a heavy beer it is still very drinkable, just over a long period of time, if i had access to this on a regular basis, it would be something i enjoyed over the entire duration of a tigers game, when im in a state where this is sold i will be picking up a case of this"
"but I'll definitely be buying this again."
"D - Due to the detailed craftmanship, the alcohol is magnificently hidden within this surprisingly refreshing stout."
"D - this is a very good stout and to answer the question, yes, it is worth picking up a 4 pack. This stout can be included in a session without destroying it in my opinion, because the profiles are intense but don't destroy the palate. IBU's hidden deceptively well behind huge malt. Well done!"
"Drink: For a big beer this is an easy sipper. I'm a bit bummed out by the body but all's forgiven when it comes to the taste."
"d- sipper for sure, slight boozy taste detected but hey its 10.50 after all."
"D - A very drinkable RIS. Nice work."
"Good smell like usual imperial stouts. Coffee, chocolates caramel, but not that strong. Black, as in pitch black, with half to an inch in head, brown to tan in color, and fades right away. Taste is great! The hop will kick in right away but goes away smoothly. It's creamy, a little sweetness to it, but overall it is a little light. Very, very drinkable, like drinking a milkshake."
"D. Heavy duty imperial stout, a serious beer. Hard to drink more than one or two, but since it's an imperial stout, that's just perfect. I'd put it right at the A-/A borderline."
"Overall I had somewhat high expectations for this beer and it exceeded them by a long shot."
"This is really one one my favorites! Highly recommended and alway welcome at my place."
"D: Great stuff, good drinkability but i can't see drinking too much sludge lest I become one of Captain Planets enemies."
"Ten Fidy pours a jet black with a small caramel head that fizzles down to a nice ring. It smells of roasted nuts, coffee and slight booze. Tastes of roasty coffee and chocolate with a small alcohol note. Mouthfeel is very chewy yet smooth with low carbonation. Drinkability is quite high due to its smoothness and flavor. Excellent beer."
"D - I would buy this more often, the price is a bit high, but it is worth it"
"D: Very drinkable, I'm quite please to have picked this one up and I may very well be going back for more."
"WOW....so pumped to try this. The can pops with little fanfare, but the pour, my god, the pour, is thicker then anything I have ever seen, a black serpent pooling lusciously into the bottom or my Surly Darkness goblet. Pitch black glass of stout. No light shines. A finger thick milk chocolate head crowns this midnight oil. The smell is big for a stout, chocolate covered cherries and peanut butter, with some coffee. The taste is very nutty, with bittering hops, then peanuts, dark chocolate, some sour cherries and a dark roast coffee finish. The mouthfeel is full and rich, and the drinkability is fine for a stout of this heft."
"Pretty easy drinking Imperial Stout. Smooth, balanced rich, tasty, and not too boozy. The roasty character, including the bitterness, is a key player, but not overdone. Really tasty. Wish I had more, or could get it where I live."
"D-- Quite good and quite drinkable. ABV is very obvious but it is ment to be a sipper and a night cap. Great way to end a night. A big beer that brings you back for more and more."
"An excellent example of an RIS, a great offering from Oskar Blues."
"I bought several of both the 2009 and 2010 brews and have put away and will pull out from time to time to sample as they age."
"All in all, this is a great brew. This is sure to satisfy any stout lover. This has some cream malts like a mild stout but it also has the bitter roastiness like an intense stout. Very well balanced brew. Definitely worth trying."
"This is not the most drinkable brew, but the complexity and rich flavor makes it. The best double stout I've had from a can!"
"Overall impression: excellent imperial stout! be ready for the alcohol."
"This is the second Oskar Blues brew I've tried and thus far they're great. I hope I'll have the chance to sample more in the future."
"... end of December 2010 -- Aged imperial stout in a can: check! Definitely a smoother beer, but still nice and roasty. Aroma has improved. Far more drinkable and less sweet. Bumping this one up a few points. Cheers!"
"The taste is syrupy, thick bodied, more so than I would prefer, with tobacco flavors, masking the alcohol well, some malt, with a good finish. There is also a very nice smoked meat/sausage quality on the finish which is great. I would like this more if it wasn't so syrup/thick in consistency. A miss for me to be honest..."
"Can't rate this too high because of availability and ABV. Although it's dangerously drinkable if you had easy access to it as the alcohol doesn't feel too prominent. A perfect stout for someone who likes something more sweet/choc dominant."
"M: Mouthfeel is very good. A very full RIS with a well hidden ABV that makes this beer very drinkable."
"d: I usually think imperial stouts go down pretty easy, but this one is especially smooth and easy drinking. If you look at it like a cordial or a desert beer, it is quite amazing how much each sip just has me going back for more. High abv and price are the limiting factors for drinkability--not the beer itself"
"D - Pretty good. Only the taste lets you know it is 10.5% but the smell and mouthfeel are quite welcoming. Its a really good stout for being straight out of a can, but stouts are kind of all starting to taste the same to me lately. The most noticable feature that stands out is the slight chalkness, which is kind of odd any drying, but overall a pretty good brew."
"Pretty disappointed with this overall, would not buy another one, but glad I got to try it. 3.45 overall."
"Tasty obtainable canned stout- love it!"
"Comments: So glad I tried it and I can't believe it took so long. A Russian Imperial Stout in a can? I'm a believer."
"drinkablility is that of a light sipper, very heavy beer"
"From the can into my Cigar City snifter. Pours jet black with a minimal light brown head. Looks like used motor oil. The nose is roasted sweet malt and cocoa. Taste is chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit and bitter hops. A bit of alcohol makes it's presence known, but the beer is not as hot as I had anticipated. Feel is full and viscous, befitting a brew of this ilk. Drinkability is fair given the ABV and magnitude of the beer, but I couldn't drink many of these in one sitting. I'll have no problem enjoying this 12 oz can, though. Another excellent beer from Oscar Blue. Perfect for a cold, rainy, Southern California evening. Cheers!"
"Pours jet black with thin brown head. Some mild lacing. This beer just looks really thick somehow. Smells of huge roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Flavour is huge alcohol, bitterness and roast. The beer is quite thick for a mouthfeel. A completely awesome imperial stout."
"D-Well its very thick, so its definitely a sipper. But wow I feel it might get better and better as it goes down. I hope to be getting this again some time soon!"
"D - I think one is enough at a time for me. Liked it quite well but didn't want a second one."
"D - a very aggressive brew. It took over 2 hours for me to finish the can. Not something to have often but on a cold night it would be a great treat."
"D: I've only had ""The Abyss"" once, and I remember drawing a parallel between that brew and this one in terms of balance, full taste, and smoothness. I can't believe that ""Ten Fidy"" is 10.5%. I refuse to believe it! This is my favorite RIS available in my local area."
"This beer was poured vigorously like the motor oil that it is into the glass to produce the finger of foam that is a deep brown color to top of the black as night body. The smell is of bourbon, chocolate, cherry, and a hint of orange zest. It's rather nice and doesn't come off too hot. The taste has a sort of rum raisin quality found usually in port with a coffee like roast in the back along with a touch of smoke that makes in real nice in the finish. The mouth is super viscous and still finds a way to be carbonated. This beer is truly a sipper of the highest order, but damn if it's not a really good beer."
"D - Yes but with that ABV you will start to feel a couple in a hurry. Not that its a bad thing!"
"Highly drinkable and packed with flavor, this beer is fantastic. A definite recommendation that lived up to the hype and was extremely complex and tasty. This is a very expensive 4 pack of cans, so this is a beer to sip and savor."
"Good stuff that is a staple stout 'round here, and very aptly priced for what you get."
"* Looked at the bottom of the can and noticed it had, ""Hahaa, Darkness"" written on it! Oh, those Merry Pranksters!"
"m/d - i didn't really know what to expect since beers that are hyped can be hit or miss. this beer in my opinion lives up to the hype. it is a really thick and balanced RIS. it is rich and indulgent and filling...like a hunk of double chocolate cake or a cup of gourmet coffee. aftervibe is a touch bittery and my mouth feels coated and a bit tingly. i don't think i could drink too many of these in an evening, but damn fine beer."
"For those of you in SoCal, rush on down to SmoQue, get one of these on nitro, maybe follow it with an Arrogant Bastard or Union Jack, then grub on some amazing BBQ!"
"the drinkability in this is about as good as it can be with this kind of a beer. definite sipper but that's a good thing so you can enjoy it"
"Notes: Great beer, one of the better RISs I've had. This can was just over a year old. I would like to compare a fresh one."
"Good Russian Imperial Stout from a can. Actually best beer I've had in a can."
"the beer pours a very dark black color with one of the darkest heads I've seen on an RIS. the head is extra bubbly and the lacing is excellent. big roasted malt and chocolate in the nose. taste is quite smooth and again more of the big roasted chocolate in the taste. only a slight burn from the alcohol. slight bitterness. the mouthfeel is very thick and creaming. the drinkability is fantastic given the ABV. I've heard great things about this RIS and was not disappointed."
"Unlike other reviews, I poured mine into a tall glass and got a 2 inch head that was colored brown. The beer is so dark you can't see through it. It tastes thick and chocolatety with a slight bitterness from the hops. A big, full body beer at 10.5 abv which masks the imperial booziness under thick layers of complex dark malts. A worthy addition to the imperial stout line. Seek this out."
"Overall, very good Impy stout."
"Poured from can into New Belgium globe. Vigorous pour yields pitch black with a small creamy mocha milk chocolate head that settles to a collar and a partial cap with good retention. Smell is hoppy and roasted bitterness, black patent malt, olives, a hint of fusel alcohol. Taste is heavily roasted, almost like a burnt marshmallow. Carbon, smokey malts, some hop bitterness present, graham crackers. If this was a bit sweeter it would be like a s'more in a can. Finish is earthy and a bit hot. Mouthfeel is heavy and coating but not sticky, with a light carbonation, near perfect for the style. Drinkability is good, but the smokiness and burnt flavors may wear me down after a bit."
"D: A good beer, I am not a Russian imperial stout drinker, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone that like imperial stouts."
"Overall a nice change of pace from other RISs, but I feel it's a bit too sweet for my liking, and I am a stout lover drawn to the coffee flavors. A good beer, and I'll certainly get it again, but I won't make a special trip for it."
"Awesome Imperial Stout, and you can take it hiking, to the beach, the pool, although I wouldn't advise shotguning it... would I?"
"Taste was really pleasant. Roasted malt, sweet molasses, dark chocolate, a slight bit of mild bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel was very creamy, velvety. This was one of the sweeter RIS's I've had, and if I could ignore the per-can price I could see myself drinking a few of these."
"DB- I would be interested in taking some notes on a fresher can. I can taste a bit of the age on this one but it is still a solid, no gimmick RIS. Superb example of mouthfeel in a big stout."
"Highly recommended."
"I'm proud to be from the state that this epicness eminates. Beyond all expectations from other Russian Imperial Stouts. Sad to hear that they may be changing the formula next season."
"At my local, this was listed at 9.4%. Wonderfully woven in. Coal black with a virtually everlasting dollop of chocolate-mousse-y shaded foam - it does eventually settle out, but leaves a hot-cocoa-y swirl in the middle, a frothy collar, and luscious thick lacing. Intense, dense, deep down hazelnut-coffee-roasty aroma - wouldn't quite add chocolate to that yet. Those roasty coffee notes really do dominate here, though not actually smelling like real java was added - amazing. Add to the joe, a little bit of cocoa in the taste and a whole lot of subtly sweet cream - this drinks/feels almost like a milkshake - how the hell did they do that?! The presence of alcohol in the taste and overall experience is just about ideal for the style. I will, without a doubt, go back to this, and I'm excited to dig deeper into the wonders and complexities of this magnificent drink. Thank you, Oskar Blues!"
"Cheers."
"Unbelievably today was the first time I have had this offering.Poured into a way over chilled pint glass at Sticks and Stones a jet black with a minimal mocha colored head that was gone quickly.Aromas of dark fruit,vanilla,and dark roast mainly stood out in the nose,a bit of char also showed thru as the beer warmed up to the right temp.Sweetish and rich up front with vanilla,and dark fruit standing out,the chocolate flavors are more bitter along with a hefty roast in the finish.Its thick and chewey and glides down easy,it is a big brash IRS,one to savor."
"Overall: This one was a little too hot for me, so I should put one down for a year to see how it tastes when the booze settles a bit. Not a bad beer at all and I can see that its complex flavors could make for an enjoyable drink. However, this one is a little too rich for my blood."
"Overall, Great beer. I can definitely e what the hype is about. If you are a beer enthusiast, don't miss Ten FIDY. ;)"
"Notes-All in all, a damn near perfect RIS and one that always makes me look forward the the late fall/early winter; it isn't the season until I've had some Ten Fidy in my snifter."
"The high booze feel gives it a great thick and warming quality. Excellent for a 10 degree winter night. The beer works its way around, coating my whole mouth. Such a great feeling. While it's a huge beer, I never have a hard time finishing the glass / can and I would never mind getting another (unless it's already warm from being in the sun on the river :) )."
"Good beer. Not my style, but certainly an excellent...ah, yes, ""Russian Imperial Stout."" I'd congratulate Oskar Blues, but I'm pretty sure everyone and their mother already has."
"T/M: What it lacks in the nose it makes up for in taste! Coffee and chocolate syrupy goodness! The flavor is very stand-upish. Thick mouthfeel, very much like syrup--a bit of a bourbon touch in the middle with a plum/prune backdrop. The beer is fairly drinkable--the alcohol is not over-bearing, which allows the flavor to flouorish--but it is very heavy and filling."
"Poured into a regular pint glass. The deep dark color shows a love of quality malt that one comes to expect from OB. I have had this beer once or twice before, but I enjoy it so much that I have review it. This is one of those cold night brews. You know the one you can open while watching football as the snow is falling outside. The aftertaste lingers with you in a sweet chocolate notes. And the mouthfeel of this brew is honestly enough to win it all the awards it has garnered already. Don't try to have too many in one sitting, but it is very much worth a try."
"Drinkability is dangerously good but at the abv it will take its toll for sure!"
"D: As good as it is, I have to take a break after a while. A great one to share."
"almost a cult classic? oskar blues is known for making good beers in a can. not just a marketing ploy! great stuff."
"In all I've been very pleased with the Ten Fidy. I'm glad to have found another great Imperial stout which is relatively easy to find and exceptional drinking..."
"Overall a solid brew, quite a roasty bugger that is very bold and enjoyable but blends very well with all the flavors incorporated and a nice contrast of sweetness verse bitterness. Medium to full bodied with a modest level of carbonation. It is very enjoyable and I would have it again. It leaves a lingering aftertaste of sweet dark chocolate coupled with bitter grains hops and alcohol. I'm not sold on the nitro presentation altering much of this experience. If anything it might be perceived as a bit smoother in the feel than the norm but not 100% smooth like all nitro could."
"Overall, a great winter time Russian Imperial Stout. This is my go-to stout during the Winter when I am out and about. Dark Lord and Hunahpuhs are obviously Gods of the Stout Genre, but they are extremely limited, obviously. If it is November through February, chances are I am drinking Ten Fidy if I am drinking Stout."
"D - Remarkably drinkable for the ABV. This will become a regular in my cellar as long as I can find it."
"D: Keep it coming. A must have for the imperial stout lover. Highly recommended."
"Drink this beer!"
"Had from a can dated 29 Oct 2009. Very good, with rich dark color. Poured no head and drank well with flavor notes of coffee and for some reason hints of roasted nuts. Kinda pricey but for a brew of this caliber reasonable to say the least! Tasted great and had an alcohol content to compliment. If you are planning on having more than one dont plan on driving."
"D. If you take away the mouthfeeling and you set aside a chunk of time and don't rush this beer its delicious."
"Wow, best stout I've ever had in a can. This thing pours black, black, black. I poured hard knowing the high alcohol would probably lead to lower carbonation - I was right here - just a small head. The smell is a heavy mix of coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. This is a sipper - each sip coats and overwhelms the tongue. I taste chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and alcohol. The flavors meld in a good way and take turns as you swallow each sip. Definately opens up with the alcohol as it warms. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. I can only have one of these but will go back for more when I recover from this one. Great beer and definately a good choice for days like today where I just want to stay out of the snowstorm outside."
"D- Definitely a sipper, but rich and complex. Thick and chewy, a bit chalky. High alcohol makes it a sipper, but it isn't boozy. Alcohol well hidden. One of my favorites."
"D - This beast is most definitely a sipper, delicious, but takes some time!"
"D - You can have one of these. You want another? Well you can't appreciate it if you try to have more than one at a time! You'll like the one you have, but you shouldn't have another. If one wasn't enough it's YOUR fault, not the beer's."
"It is definitely worth the money"
"Mouthfeel is just amazing. Although it has a nice carbonation level the mouthfeel is liquid velvet, just coats the mouth and doesn't let go. The strength of the beer can be tasted but it's not distracting, it's just great. Drinkability is above average for the style but because of the fuller mouthfeel this beer lends itself to be a nice sipper and enjoyed for a good 30-60+ minutes. Just wonderful."
"Pours blacker and thicker than anything I've ever seen. Motor oil comes to mind. No highlights whatsoever. There's a half-finger head from an absurdly aggressive pour (about 2 feet from can to glass). Wish there was more head, it's a beautiful cedar-colored bubbly layer that sat around atop the beer for about 30 seconds. Smells as dark as it looks, with mocha, dark chocolate, and roasted grain dominating the nose. The first sip is predictably thick. There's a massive roasted barley flavor, coffee & dark chocolate blending into sort of a mocha character that finishes bitter and warm."
"Mouthfeel is full, chewy and smooth. Overall, Ten Fidy is tough to beat for widely available stouts. Not the cheapest but worth the extra few bucks."
"Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored foam head. Has an aroma of smoke, dark fruit, and cocoa. Sweet up front, nice malty mouthfeel for a IS. Sweet on the backend too. Could use more bitter. The bitters are there but very subtle. A nice smooth IS but not complex."
"I can't imagine this beer becoming better with age as it drinks really well when it is fresh."
"First off I have to say the used oil comparisons are spot on, that's how this pours, no exaggeration. Pours black and is completely impermeable to light. Has about a half a finger of brown sugar colored head that disappears quick leaving no lacing. Roasted notes with tons of cocoa in the nose. Taste is phenomenal, a little bit of everything you would expect. Predominately cocoa and sweet/roasted malts with nice hints of espresso and some faint charred notes. Full bodied to say the least. I want to say the 10.5% alcohol is well hidden but that may not be all that accurate given how much is going on with this one. I absolutely love when a beer lives up to the hype that surrounds it. In fact I might even say this one exceeded my lofty expectation."
"D: Ridiculous. I bypass the buzz and almost always drink two of these (making sure not to step foot near heavy machinery)."
"D: Tasty. Not my favorite of the Russian Imperials I've had, but easily gets the job done. Will have to try this one again."
"As I drink this one only gets better. Mouthfeel is perfect for an RIS, and it's as if my palate got used to it and I really began to enjoy this through the pint. The drinkability is good for the style... I would grab a few of these to try again..."
"Meh... I agree that they hit the marks with the style and all, but I can think of several RIS' that I'd go to well before this one. It's not bad, but there's better IMO"
"Really, the only problem with this beer is that at $13 for a 4-pack, it doesn't stand up to Old Rasputin (at $8 for a 4-pack). Admittedly it's a completely different beer, completely roast obsessed, but still ... Raspy is better, and cheaper ... and that's really the bar for a RIS, in my humble opinion."
"Poured the can into a Chimay goblet. One half inch of dark roasty head. Plenty of chocolate maltiness coming off the nose. Sweetness and dark chocolate filled my mouth on the first sip and the alcohol was there but not in your face. really impressed - this was purchased a year ago and has aged gracefully."
"Taste is upped a bit from the smell. Again, deep, rich chocolate notes. These then round to show complexity with coffee, dark fruits (bigger than the smell), some caramel, big time roasted grains. Slightly burnt. Nice flavor. CRAZY thick mouthfeel. Soo heavy, big, thick, sticky. Awesome mouthfeel."
"D: One of my favorite RIS and an exceptional beer. Rich and extremely smooth. Sad to hear this one is leaving California."
"D: Ten FIDY is definitely a sweeter RIS, but I like it that way. It's got great flavor, the 9 percent ABV is only noticeable when it's far too late to care and it comes in a can! What's not to love? In the top tier of readily-available Russian Imperials."
"."
"Cheers..."
"Ten Fidy is complex and delicious, with an accessability that makes it a refreshing, and potentially, every-day stout."
"Dark as molasses, pours a motor oil consistency. Minimal creamy tan head with a vigorous pour. Aroma is sweet tangy burnt caramel, fruity raisin/date tone at the end. Creamy mouthfeel with hints of roasted coffee burnt undertones and dark chocolate. 9.5% abv is all but lost with rich flavor yet creeps up as it warms your soul. Very well balanced as it was tangy in the front, yet smoothe and sweet in the back... (Did I just say that?.. Hahaa) A special chocolate mum cupcake accentuated the experience... Loved it..."
"Damn good beer. Period."
"D: The alcohol hits fast and hard, as you would expect from an ABV this high. As Cookie Monster would say, this is a ""sometimes beer."""
"Pours about as dark brown/black as you can get. Very rocky, brown head forms on top. Smell is roasted malt and milk duds. Taste is huge! Very roasted malts, and I mean roasted. Charred might even be a better term. Full, creamy and very velvety on the mouthfeel. This has a close feel as a weak milkshake as you can get. This would be very complimentary to a good dark dessert. Can't get over the amount of roast, chocolate and coffee that is here. Over the top, but good beer."
"Mouth feel is smooth and creamy. Light carbonation. Drinkability is high as the taste made me want to keep going back for more."
"D- this is one of the classics. Its super accessible and a beast of a brew. This one seems just a touch on the wet cardboard side."
"D: Goes down wonderfully for the style. I'm usually expecting a meal, but this is delightfully lighter and easier to drink than many."
"The beer is nearly black with a tan, dense head that sticks around for awhile. Despite the alcohol content there is very little evident in the nose. The smell is left to the roasted malts that give a sweet and mild coffee odor. The alcohol does show up in the taste, giving the overall impression of a coffee liqueur in a beer. But the mouthfeel is what really sets this one apart. It's creamy, thick and viscous. The booze show up here as well with a bit of a tingle on your tongue. This beer will definitely make its way into my beer fridge one of these days...when I can afford it."
"This is worlds beyond Stone RIS in every dimension, and I would place it above Speedway and Old Viscosity as well for that matter. A bourbon barreled version of this might actually take away from the superb balance OB has pulled off here. I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying the can aspect - but you can't argue with a beer that retains its temperature as you snifter shot after shot. Also, no worries regarding QC in this format. What an amazing brew!"
"Taste is super rich and malty, decent amount of booze but it's not too much in your face given the high abv. It's got a fairly light hop presence but it well balanced. Very thick and full mouthfeel, super easy drinking given the abv."
"Overall this is a great RIS! Perhaps a bit pricey but I can't say I regret the purchase. Roasty and chocolatey and very full. Great job here"
"This is actually a favorite imperial stout of mine now. To be quite honest, the overbearing roasted and bitter qualities many RIS's have can be a bit much to handle...but this one doesn't have that edge. In fact, it seems like a really rich and sweet rendition. Thankfully, it still has the consistancy of motor oil...which I do love."
"Picked some up from Whole Foods. Very dark from the can into a glass. It has a very small espresso head. The aroma is nice, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee - could be a little bigger though. Taste is solid with a subtle slightly acidic undertone that gives a bit of bite. Mouthfeel feels a little thin for the style. Drinkability is solid."
"D. I really like the aroma and the flavor is good, but the carbonation level really takes away from the drinkability. On the other hand I'd more than happily drink this again should it cross my path."
"I'm glad my 1st experience with this one had a year of age on it."
"Alcohol a bit warming and forward, dry finish. Low carbonation, medium mouthfeel, but not as creamy and heavy in the mouth as the color might've suggested. A bit of a rough heated finish from the alcohol. Decent, but not killer to me; probably would've liked it more if the alcohol didn't feel so harsh to me. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood..."
"I love imperial stouts and have been waiting to try this one for a while. It definitely lives up to its reputation. This is easily in my top ten now."
"Overall, a really solid and sweet imperial stout. Not the best I've ever had but solid in every respect and really tasty. Definitely worth seeking out."
"D: Can't write anymore, going to go open another one."
" stout in à can ? Never had one before , but this stout is just awesome . Wow"
"The flavor on this is huge, the alcohol is totally there, but very tamed with everything else going on. Killing a 4 pack would be easy. Super drinkable stout. Sadly, I had only 1 can."
"Drinkabilty - Really tasty. A very sweet ris. The alcohol is really masked, drinks like a 6%'er. Malts are roasted, caramely and work great with the sweet brown sugars and mollasses. A really nice beer, a little different from regular ris's. Only negitive is its a bit pricey, seen this 3-5$ a can. Theres no way id pay 5$ for this when i can spend the same amount for a kbs, or the much cheaper old rasputin. Worth a drink for sure."
"(16th)"
"best RIS i've ever had from a can!"
"2009 Vintage. Served from tap into an imperial pint. Pours black with a one finger dark tan head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, dark chocolate, and caramel. The flavor was of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and dark fruit. It was heavy on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was an excellent stout. Lots of surprising flavors in this one which kept me going back for more. The aroma was also quite excellent on this one as well. This is a definite must try whether out of the can or on tap."
"In my mind it is not just a top shelf stout but an epitome of the style. Oskar do the Midwest a favor and distribute to Chicago!"
"Oskar Blues has it figured out. Their entire lineup is class and the cans are just an added bonus. Ten FIDY is worth seeking out. If it were a one day brewery only release, this would be get a lot more credit."
"in the end, an excellent RIS. would have scored it even higher but for the competition within the style. the can takes nothing away. if this were bourbon bbl aged i could have a new favorite stout."
"Excellent brew."
"Pours jet black with a small, dark chocolate brown head, In the aroma, chocolate and dry coffee. In the taste, starts with dry coffee, and a sweet chocolate end. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, roasty, small chocolate aftertaste. Big beer, big flavor and quite good."
"Appearance: It pours absolute black with a bit of dark khaki head that recedes quickly to the collar. We have mainly chocolate on the nose with some hints of espresso and alcohol esters on the back end. More chocolate to the taste with some figs, caramel, and roastiness included. The mouthfeel is rather disappointing. It was slightly watery and flat to me (and I usually complain about too much carbonation)."
"D: smooth, the booze is hidden, and the beer is drinkable."
"D- RIS in a can?!?! Great beer, if the price in FL was more reasonable, it'd get a higher mark"
"Interesting beer, I detest cans but this is one I may seek out in the future."
"D - More carb and I would like more. Its an excellent taste when an ""ehh"" mouthfeel."
"D-Quite good for a RIS, especially from a can. Nice that it comes in a 12 oz. serving. Wouldn't want a bomber all by myself. A definite sipping beer this one."
"Cliché, but this pours just like old motor oil. There's no real hint of carbonation in the pour. Head is dark brown/burnt orange, but really dissipates quickly. Really smells of dark, dried fruits like prunes. Intermingled with this is a burnt sweet malt aroma reminiscent of crème brulee. Silky smooth feel. The burnt malts are the dominant taste for me. Prunes and raisins also show themselves. I also get an overall sweetness that has hints of both chocolate and vanilla. The alcohol is pretty well hidden. I'm not a huge RIS fan, but this is pretty good stuff. I've yet to be disappointed with an Oskar Blues beer. Too bad I can only get the stuff when my father-in-law comes back from Florida."
"D - Quite drinkable for the ABV but I really wish this was thicker and had better carbonation. Definitely a great stout, but I'm surprised by how Expedition-like this is. Granted, I did love Expedition, and imitation is the most sincere form of flattery..."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable and tasty stout. I see why it's so highly praised, especially compared to the other chocolaty molasses flavored stouts. Lots of flavor and a good body on this one. The head could use a little beefing up, but a solid brew all around. Thanks again for hooking me up Jojo!"
"Can, thanks to HogtownHarry. Thick, dark, black pour with a bit of brown head. Aroma is a malt bomb, heavy with chocolate. Some hops and licorice too, reminescent of Bells Expeditions stout. Taste is quite bitter, some roastiness and hop bitterness with a fruity finale. Palate is rich and thick, quite boozy (lots of alcohol warmth). Slightly overdone even for an imperial stout."
"Certainly not eminently drinkable because of the aforementioned viscosity, as well as the propensity for a high alcohol content. However, I marvel at the ability of such a delightful drink to come from an aluminum can."
"D- Amazing beer. if you can get your hands on it GET IT!!"
"D - I've never been let down by Oskar Blues, but this is one helluva extraordinary offering from them! Any true beer aficionado would be sure to appreciate this brew!"
"D: Pretty darn good, one of the better RIS's I've had."
"The beer pours an absolute, soul sucking black. I swear the lights even dimmed when as I filled my glass. A dark caramel head forms, only about a finger in height, and sticks around for a minute before fading. Retention is average, but there's no real lacing to be found. The nose is simple but awesome, super rich dark chocolate and a very smooth, but noticeable warm alcohol sensation. The nose did not prepare me for the blast of pine and hop bitterness on my first sip, and to be honest I prefer my stouts with a little less prominent hop influence and to be all about the malt. Not to worry though, there's still the megaton of dark chocolate promised by the aroma, and the alcohol is a bit less pronounced (though still present, and not necessarily a bad thing). The mouthfeel is absolutely luxuriant, spot on low end of the spectrum carbonation and probably the thickest, chewiest stout I've yet encountered (and this is not a bad thing). The hop flavor isn't too much, but it's more than I prefer, but other than that everything about this beer is very well done and as a result it's disappearing almost alarmingly quickly from my glass."
"Overall it is a middle of the road RIS, perhaps a bit too blunt and too sweet for my tastes in a RIS."
"D- i couldn't have another one of these right now. one is enough. i need something that will wash the much of my palate. nevertheless, the complexity of flavors and the feel of this brew keep me comin back for more. the smoky dryness and sticky graininess incline me to take sip after pleasurable sip to relieve the roasted condition of my lips and cheeks but the only that could do that would be a toothbrush and lots of toothpaste. so in that sense, one can is entirely drinkable and in many ways too small, but this brew is too rich and powerful to be anything but a treat for me."
"Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"D - This is the way I like my RIS's to look and taste. Strong complex flavor and dark as night appearance!! Great thick bodied and mouthfeel that coats the whole palate and leaves the flavor hanging long after the swallow. For an RIS in a can, I dont think this can be beat (until they start putting Old Rasputin in cans!)."
"Semi slick mouthfeel, followed by crisp boozyness, full body and medium light carbo."
"Big density and light-medium carbonation actually leads to a great mouthfeel and perhaps the most drinkable stout I've had. Stupendous beer."
"This one puts the ""A" in ""Holy crap!"""
"Pours pitch black with almost no head. Tan lacing coats the glass and my taste buds begin to water. The aroma is roasty and malty. Slight hints of coffee and almost a hint of smokiness like it has some rauch malt. The taste is a deep roast balanced with a residual sweetness and a warming alcohol sensation. It almost has a bourbon taste to it or like it was aged on oak. It feels thick and smooth, it paints your mouth practically. This is a phenomenal brew but I don't think i could slug more than one back. Too much of an alcohol taste for me."
"This is good stuff indeed. Not overly complex, there is flavor to spare. More bitterness would be ideal, in my opinion. Other than that, no complaints. If you're going to do a very sweet Imperial Stout, this is how it's done. Recommended."
"It's good to see beer like this come out of can."
"Pours jet black with a quickly disappearing chestnut head. Tiny little tan ring remains. Nose of big toasty malts, coffee and chocolate also some licorice. Again big roasted malt flavor, coffee and chocolate notes, some hop presence. Warmth of alcohol is clear too. Liquid smoothness over the tongue, this beer is thick and rich. For such a strong stout it is very pleasant to drink, thanks in part to the great mouthfeel and in my opinion appropriate carb level."
"From the can to the glass, this beer is pitch black. Great mocha colored head, about two inches. Dark roasted cocoa, molasses, toffee, expresso, Thick and creamy, with a dry finish. Don't be thrown off by the fact it is in a can, this RIS is absolutely fantastic!"
"overall this beer is pretty good. reminds me alot of black chocolate stout from brooklyn brewery. not sure if i'd seek this out again."
"D: I drank this beer on a 10th mountain division hut trip in the rocky mountains. After carrying this beer 13 miles into the woods I was disappointed by burnt and alcoholic flavors. For me this style should be be about roasted malts with dark fruit or chocolate flavors and slight alcohol warmth. This beer did no have those characteristics."
"D: Very high. The pleasant taste and lighter mouthfeel make this a very, very drinkable imperial stout. There is absolutely no alcohol ""hotness""."
"Pours a motor oil like viscosity jet black with a small/medium mocha colored head. Deep black body with zero light able to pass through. Smell is unreal. near perfect for me. really has that deep dark chocolate, almost brownie like aroma going on with some nice fudgy sweetness comming through and an oreo like chocolate note. Taste is very nice as well. Big bold mocha flavors. really glad this isnt heavy on the coffee flavors. Has a deep rich mocha chocolate component with a touch of acidity to balance the sweetness out. Real nice texture on this one. actually more carbonated that i thought from the appearance. Rolls well of the tongue and would pair well with some spicy food for sure. Drinkability is very high. really this is enjoyable and delicious enough to replace red wine for every dish i canthink of. would love to have this with some waffels."
"Pours dark, dark black. Not much head, but the head is tan and thin. The first taste is smooth with a hint of chocolate followed by coffee. The end of the sip is sour. There is a good hint of sweetness in both the smell and taste. A very good and heavy beer. Must be sipped an not chugged, though no good beer drinker would do such a thing. Highly recommended."
"D - Awesome! Kicking myself for spending $5 for a single can instead of $15 for the four pack. You must try this beer and to think it comes from a can is even more impressive!"
"D: A little hotter than similar beers I have had."
"Drinkability -- The fact that this beer came from a can still boggles my mind. Rich and sweet with enough acrid char character to prevent it from being cloying. More importantly, not a trace of metallic off flavors from the can. I loved it!"
"D: Very drinkable Imperial Stout, perhaps the most approachable RIS I've had. It's nice because it's not overly sweet, more drier."
"D - Very well-balanced Russian Imperial Stout overall with little flaws and is deceptively easy drinking despite the 9.5% ABV. Today's a Friday but still, I am, admittedly, very impressed by this brew. This is definitely setting a very high standard for the Stone and Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout that's presently sitting in my fridge. (4.5)"
"Totally black color with a thick cocoa brown head that slowly dissipates. Sweet roasted malty, chocolaty, aromas, with hints of maple syrup and coffee. Thick and chewy feel. The carbonation slowly fights through the thickness to provide the full body feel. Big dark roasted malt flavor with a very smooth finish. The high ABV peaks through in the aftertaste, but is generally hidden in the big thick dark malt flavor. Very enjoyable."
"An outstanding beer worth having time and again. The can is unflattering on the shelf, but its hold on the carbonation can't be beat."
"Pretty drinkable, but not overwhelmingly so, the balance keeps it from getting cloying, but this isn't the type of beer that screams at me for another one, more like the kind of beer i'll have one of over an hours time."
"D: For what it is, this is quite drinkable; a very delicious big stout in a can...awesome!"
"D - The alcohol is well hidden here which makes it that much more enjoyable to drink. I think a can or two could easily be done by one person."
"Very good beer."
"D: After 9.5% ABV, an abundance of flavorful malts, and the sensation that your mouth was just paved with thick, fresh tar, i could only drink 13-14 of these beers in a row."
"Pours a dark black with a nice thick one inch layer of caramal brown foam. The taste is of nice roasted malts with coffee and dark chocolate lingering in the finish. Very fucking smooth and drinks so damn well. No hint of the 9.5% alc in any sip of this at all. Hope I get the chance to pick up some more of this in the future."
"D - Very, very drinkable. I split this can with FluffyFactor, and I certainly would have had no problem drinking at least one or two cans on my own. The alcohol is well hidden. All in all, this beer has certainly exceeded my expectations."
"Once again, thanks to jgasparine for this great brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 9/25/2009. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention is decent, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some dark fruit and licorice. Great malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, coffee and a bit of dark fruit. Starts off sweet, and then has a slight bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's velvety, sticky and creamy. Drinkability is pretty good, it's nice and smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, luckily I have 3 cans left so I know I'll have some to try another day."
"Hats off to Oskar Blues for creating an excellent beer!"
"Notes: This surpassed the expectations I had for it, and they were very high because I have come to love everything from Oskar Blues. The flavors are just so big, descriptions can't do it justice."
"I have begun trying some of the Oskar Blues offerings and this is a very good one. A very nice tasting and easy drinking RIS beer that I plan on having again."
"Looks great. Poured this into a tulip. Pours black with about an inch of mocha head that isn't retained very long. The nose isn't very strong buy familiar RIS smells peer through; dark fruits, cocoa, and a hint of coffee. Dark fruits are most prominent and I feel like I'm really fishing for other aromas. Roasted malts and coffee take charge in the flavor. This beer is hot. I really tasted the alcohol and it lingers all throughout my mouth. After another sip and I notice more dark fruit characteristics, especially on the finish. Mouth feel is pretty nice but the burn makes it tough to really appreciate. This guy is a sipper, and I kind of regret opening this on one of the warmer days of the year. At 9.5 this beer is surprisingly hot to me. I feel like I had bigger beers with less noticeable alcohol presence."
"Served in an 8 oz. glass (too full for a full pint) at Homemade Liquids and Solids. Jet black with a plentiful dark latte colored head. Coffee, oak, and caramel aroma. Taste is similar to aroma with a very slight smokiness, as well. Medium mouthfeel. Alcohol sweetness or burn nowhere to be found front, middle, or back. Worthy of a second."
"Extremely rich flavor; notes of coffee, chocolate, licorice...basically everything you could ask of a stout. Creamy, syrupy mouthfeel adds to the experience. This is close to the Platonic ideal of an imperial stout. Fan-fucking-tastic."
"A great beer, probably my favorite RIS so far. (We will see how the Stone cellars) Not sure how it got any subpar reviews (maybe drink it in the sun on a hot day?), but they should seriously consider revisiting this one. Mine was canned 12-10-09, find one of these and you may want to update your review.."
"Dark oily brown, literally, as it gives the distinct impression of cracking open an oil can when this beast is poured. Tan head is small. Smells of rich dark chocolate and raspberries. Bittersweet dark chocolate and red fruit again make an appearance in the taste, accompanied by burnt brown sugar and coffee bean. Minimal hop bitterness and extremely smooth. Impressive and delectable!"
"D - Got through one can no problem, other than the alcohol made me tipsy and it was fairly filling. But was game for #2."
"Overall: Excellent representation of the style. This has just about everything you'd want from a stout. If you see it, ignore the price tag and buy it."
"Black body with coffee-head. Aroma of coffee beans, alcohol, dark chocolate. Strong flavors of dark chocolate, alcohol, coffee, prunes, slight tang. The tang slicks the palate as the aftertaste. Light carbonation tickles the tongue with this medium bodied brew. I'm diggin' the can for this RIS. This chick don't look too good but what's inside is alluring. I'll get her number."
"D- The drinkability is good for this ABV. It is still a slow-drinker, but it works well for that. As the beer warms the roasted malts take over the alcohol burn more and more until is really isn't noticeable. That could also be the alcohol taking effect, but either way, gets better as it warms."
"I really liked this beer when I had a small pour during a tasting, but polishing off a whole glass is not quite what I'd hoped. The alcohol taste is just a little too much and leads to a slightly unpleasant finish. For the same price, I could get 2 Old Rasputins or a 550mL Samuel Smith, which are much more drinkable to me."
"Definitely not cheap, but well worth it. This beer pours near black with a dark espresso colored head at the end of the fast pour. Not a huge head, but nice. Smell is intense chocolate and toffee - very sweet and bright. The taste is fantastic - full of caramel and lots of chocolate. I'd like to taste the aged versions for a darker overall taste. The feel is incredibly creamy without being too heavy - not too thick - very easy to take down. I would never guess that it is 10.5% alcohol (other than the name of course) - feels more like 7-8%. The smooth and not too intense overall feel of the beer makes for an exceptionally drinkable RIS for me. If it was cheaper I'd be drinking this all the time, but at $4.50/can, it'll remain a once-in-a-while drink."
"Overall - This is one of my favorite RISes when I don't care about subtlety. There are others that might be more nuanced, but when I want a powerful example of the style, this is where I turn."
"D - This is a heavy hitting beer, has huge amounts of flavors, great mouthfeel, terrific smell and appearance. Definitely seek it out, but you definitely have to like a sweet beer to enjoy it."
"Overall, a stunning beer for the $3-$4 price tag. As a stout lover, anytime the fridge is empty I know I'll reach for a Ten Fidy."
"Pours thick pitch black with a nice 1 inch brown head consisting of tiny packed bubbles that leave a spotty lace. I think the beer is too thick to leave any more lace. Rich roasted malt aroma with a hint of sweet fruit. Very good but big roasted chocolate malt initial flavor that finishes with a chocolate, slightly alcoholic aftertaste. I started typing mouthfeel before flavor. It is excellent, thick and smooth, not too syrupy, but thick. I almost want to chew it. I don't ever really want more than one of these, but I would take one at any time - winter, summer, right now. What does that mean for drinkability? This is a great beer. Perfect for dessert with a little dark chocolate."
"D = I'll keep it to this one can and call it good. For my money, there are WAY better malt liquors in the same ABV range out there."
"Doesn't mean it's wrong for you. I recommend you try it. You may find it's just your cuppa BIG BREW."
"D: drinks pretty good but it is really boozy and has a decent sweet flavor. I swear I get a little metal taste from the can. I probably will have some more soon."
"Buy this. I know it's approaching 20 bucks for a 4-pack. But buy it, for the love of God, BUY IT!"
"Intelligence will dictate a limit of one a night I'm afraid. Yum. There might be a taste bud blowout if you were to have more than one. 4"
"This is an imperial stout and it pours real thick, like oil. It has a dark brown head and smells fairly mild, a little roasty. It tastes smooth and rich, hints of chocolate and a thick feel in the mouth. It has a bit of a warm alcohol feel on finish. This stout is quite good."
"I resisted trying this for so long, $16 for a 4 pack of cans just didn't seem right. I was wrong."
"D: One of the best Imperial Stouts I've had, goes right up with Stone's. The thickness and ABV limits drinkability, but you just need one and call it a night. This is what I expect Imperial Stouts to be. Too bad this beer is costly, because I would consume it often. This is a rare treat to myself whenever I feel like giving my beer-lovin' soul a high-five."
"Overall: Incredibly good. Very accessible for such a rich flavor that belies its strong alcohol content. The only hint if its strength is how quickly your head will start spinning. I would definitely drink this again and would drink it regularly if it wasn't so darn expensive."
"D: I would like to eat this with an expensive bar of chocolate. I will definitely drink this again, probably just 1 can at a time because it's relatively expensive."
"Wow, what a beer. I found the aroma to be a bit boozey and lacked some of the usual characteristics of an imperial stout but everything else about this beer is excellent. Drinkability is really high for me as it has a very smooth finish and a soft mouth feel. The only downside is the price and amount you get per can."
"D Very tasty stuff and I would love to have another one after this. The higher ABV would probably limit me to just that one more though."
"Excellent stout. Just about the best I've ever had in any 'stout' category. There is a hint of alcohol, but it is so well masked at 10.5% ABV that this is just incredible."
"Thin but closely woven head of dark brown, modest retention and lacing. True to form, presents an impenetrably black liquid, a starless night in your glass. Heavy nose that texturally pushes outwards to gain as much ground as possible, licorice, white cake mix, toffee, baker's chocolate, café au lait, not overpoweringly sweet nor sugary, as much white grape and apricot fruit as cherry or plum scents, vanillin booziness, brazil nuts, there's plenty of different scents in there but they don't quite cohere into a choral whole. Full-bodied, dense and slooow moving, oily texture. Coconut, butterscotch, caramel, coffee, carob and chocolate covered raisins, darker complexion to the fruit here, cherry and blackberry with only a brush of apricot. The carbonation itself is slow if steady, more like a drip from a leaky faucet than a steady stream. More roast to it when warmer but, conversely, sheds some weight. More intensity of flavor and it's a right up with the best."
"Verry drinkable. I cant belive something this good came from a can."
"It's really nice to know that this RIS is widely available in many stores nearby. A very solid, enjoyable stout. We search the country looking for limited release stouts and this beauty can be had just about anywhere---thanks OB!!"
"Looked like well-used motor oil coming out of the can, seemed almost thick as it came out out of the can. I was wondering if any head would eventually appear but after about half the can was poured a small head appeared for about as long as it took me to smell the beer. The smell is vague but could pick up slight notes of burnt fruit, definitely not as strong of a smell as other beers of this style. The first taste was surprisingly complex considering the simplicity I picked up in the nose. Roasted toffee and malt at first, bit of burning sensation on the way down and leaves a dark chocolate and coffee bean taste in the mouth after swallowing. Minimal lacing through the glass as I finish."
"This could be served after dinner in a snifter or cordial and impress the finest port and brandy drinkers, and yet is drinkable enough to enjoy a few full glasses. The price is kinda rough, but I have to admit, I'm likely to buy it again for special occasions. And I have a loose definition of special."
"I must say it slmost unnatural to see something that dark come out of a can, and I mean that in a good way. I wonder if this gets a few bonus points for being from a can but overall it is a pretty easy drinking imp stout that is hard to stay away from."
"With this mouthfeel this beer is very drinkable especially for a 9.5% Imp Stout."
"Summary: This is a good stout. Very well balanced. I hope to try this again sometime soon. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"High Marks all around on this one."
"Overall I'm a bit disappointed - this is a solid stout, but not something I'd necessarily seek out again in most cases."
"(D)- A solid to great stout, but more importantly, probably the best beer I have had out of a can! Definitely fits the style well; just an all-around good stout I would love to always have in the fridge if I could. I was very surprised by this one."
"Very good. Don't let the can fool you. Has to be in my top three RIS that I've had so far. A bit strong to drink a lot of, but superb."
"I like this beer. But I don't know why its in BA top 100."
"Pours a thick molasses droopy glug into the glass which creates a nice tight bubbled tan head. Aromas of Dark chocolate ice cream and hops come into play. The flaovr starts off chocolatey a turn into a culmination of molasses and hops. Sure, there are background notes of coffee, roasted bread, (yes, I meant roasted bread) and chocolate, but the molasses really sticks out in this one as the backbone flavor. Maybe even some soy sauce in there. The drinkability of this beer varies. Sure its a nice Imperial stout, however the weight leaves to a one serving beer."
"Very nice, I am not an RIS fan, but there are some very interesting oat characteristics here that other RIS's don't showcase."
"D- A pure sipper, but a nice one that's one of the best choices to ever come in a can. I'll definitely pick some more of it up to enjoy, and share."
"D - a great stout, still very hot after this time. remember all my other 1050's had a bit more carbonation. big and bold."
"The nose was only thing on this beer not up to a very high standard. A little off and burnt and not indicitive of the lovely beer beneath. The complexity of this stout is married with a real smoothness that makes drinking it a pleasure. Chocolate notes are all there with some dryness coming into the finish to keep everything in check. Will look for more of these in my travels"
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is pretty high."
"Well rounded offering. Hits all the marks of a well made RIS. A bit hot and boozie, but not a bad thing. Brew is well deserves honors of top 100."
"D - Easy to drink, definitely a sipper due to ABV, and the alcohol in the taste is present but relatively mellow for it's level"
"D: Not sure where to rate this. I had one, but don't see myself drinking a lot of them. Perhaps this backs the outrageous price of 16 dollars for a 4 pack. If you can, just buy a single before you shell out more."
"D - Very tasty - but 8 dollars for a pint!!! Damn! Good thing my buddy picked up this round."
"Overall a good RIStout. A little pricey IMO. I'd pick it up again, but not something I'd get often."
"d- fairly low. I had no problem drinking a twelve once glass and definitely drink a healthy pint of it but a bomber might take a while to sip on. it's really quite a beast of a beer."
"D: While this beer is a bit filling, it is incredibly easy to drink given the ABV. The price jumped a bit in the past year, but is still an amazing RIS that will continue to be a go to for me when available"
"Black pour with a small tan head. Very roasty aroma with some hints of milk chocolate, black coffee and dark fruit. The flavor has a great dark roast, bitter coffee and dark chocolate character with delicious background notes of fig and plum. The body is creamy, oily and full with moderate carbonation and a faint alcohol warming. It finishes remarkably light for such a big and makes it scarily easy to drink."
"Pours pitch black with a small tan head. Aroma is like a fudge brownie. The taste starts out the same way. Semi-sweet Dark chocolate is dominant up front. Loads of roasted malt takes over from the chocolate. There is an espresso-like bitterness that dominates the finish. This is a very good RIS."
"D - Needless to say along with my sinister stout from the Rivertowne Pourhouse, three cans went down that night and the last the next night. If I found a single that was actually affordable (2-3 dollars) I would love to try it again fresh."
"The taste is spectacular. Would probably be a great beer on very cold evening."
"D: A good beer, but not overly impressive. For me, the reason I drink stouts (and Imperial Stouts and RIS's) if for their complexity and this beer is lacking complexity. There is nothing wrong with it, no off flavors or anything of that nature, but between the flat, black liquid look to the relatively simple and quick finishing flavor, I was left wanting more."
"The beer pours a black color with a brown head. This is what an imperial stout is supposed to look like. The aroma is heavily roasted malt chocolate. The flavor is very nice, with heavily roasted/burnt malt, bitter chocolate and some nice hop character. The alcohol is more present as the beer approaches room temperature. You also get some dark fruit and molasses notes. The mouthfeel is very thick and creamy and the carbonation is pretty low. An awesome beer."
"D- A simple formula, great straightforward taste and excellent construction make this a joy to drink. This may be my new regular in the winter months. I loved drinking this."
"Overall: A very good imperial stout, verging on overly sweet but solid overall."
"aroma and taste is stone fruits, dark chocolate, a little smoke. the alcohol is there too, and it's a little too hot for me. there is that textbook RIS stickyness. i could use some more carbonation to liven up the tongue and make things less syrupy. i'm glad i tried this one but i won't be going back again often."
"This is a well rounded imperial stout. Does a lot of things that too many breweries don't do. Like, for one, keep it simple. Complexity is great, but in moderation.(If thats not too oxymoronic) This is a smooth, rich RIS that one could drink all the time."
"D: Gonna keep this one on the list and in the fridge. I like having a big beer like this in a 12oz serving."
"D: I'm only 1/4 way down the glass as I write this and I'm feeling the effect. A nice big beer. I will drink this again."
"This beer is so smooth going down,sip by sip, you can drink alot of this. Then after awhile the 9.5% kicks in...Good Night. This is a very good beer, one of the better stouts I've tasted. If you see it in your local store, pick some up and give it a try..."
"Overall, its a very tasty/smooth imperial. Definitely drink again, a little on the pricey side though."
"D- My feelings are mixed. I've had worse Imperial Stouts, and I've had better. This falls somewhere in between. Oskar Blues is nearly impossible to get in southcentral PA, but on a journey somewhere else, I'd be willing to pick a couple of these up for the unfamiliarity factor."
"D-an amazing beer that not only tastes out of this world but is also very delicious and hides its 9.5 behind a combination of huge tastes"
"Dark brown nearly opaque body, dark tan head slow dissipation with some nice spider leg trails down side of glass, a really nice looking beer. Nose is big chocolate hit, some roast, and a healthy dollop of floral hops for good measure. Taste is yummy, chocolate with a bit of smoke, quite a bit of hoppiness on back end. Mouthfeel is full and sticky. I believe I could consume several of these. In my limited experience this is by far the best canned beer I've had, and a really interesting RIS. Highly recommended."
"Pours a dark black with great mocha head. Hints of butterscotch, chocolate and dark brown sugar aroma. Incredibly sweet with molasses flavor. Medium body, incredibly smooth mouthfeel. I've put down a growler of this in a night, so it's incredibly drinkable."
"Notes: Overall I like this beer, I really do...but It doesn't really catch me the way others have. Will I recommend it? Yes, but after I recommend others."
"Notes: Hmmm, it had been a while since I had it last and I did not remember it this good. I´m a bit disappointed with the aroma, temperature was fine and the can fresh, I wonder if they all behave like this. Very nice RIS on a can in any case."
"This is so incredibly drinkable. But it's also 9.5% ABV. And it's expensive. So, sadly, this is not a beer I can drink a lot of, though I do think it's worth it's price. Instead, it's a good start to the night. Mmmm. Mmmm. My mouth is SO HAPPY."
"D-Smooth. ABV is mostly well-hidden."
"Very full mouthfeel with nice carbonation. It was chewy yet drinkable. I was ready for more after finishing this. Excellent beer."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.5 - Big, bold and satisfying. Lacking a little in complexity compared to some other Imperial Stouts I've had, but this is an incredible beer for the price! The convenient cans are grat, too."
"Poured from can into snifter. Dark as night with a decent, almost 2 finger tan head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is very complex of some chocolate, coffee, cream, and burnt grain. Taste is also wonderfully complex. Dark milk chocolate that almost has a creaminess too it with some coffee beans and toasted grain and dry malt. Very nice! Mouthfeel was full and thick as expected, very creamy. Overall a great beer. The ABV is well hidden and even for a RIS, its very complex."
"Pretty much everything I want in an RIS. It's not over-the-top like a lot of RIS's, but it's still an exciting beer to drink."
"Definitely a classic... and what a treat to get a beer of this quality in a can."
"D- This is a very drinkable stout that tastes better than most flagship stouts. The higher ABV limits this beer to just drinking a couple before moving onto something else."
"I don't know how old this can in. Other reviews suggest that Ten FIDY usually tastes more intense than what I experienced. This is a very, very nice beer regardless. Who knows; maybe the other can I have will be even better. If so I will revise this review."
"D: Convincingly good out of a can, but was deceptively carbonated, even out of the snifter."
"Mouthfeel is just thick and murky, like a blended up piece of chocolate cake. Carbonation is very low, which is kind of a bummer, but the remainder of the brew is so well executed that it more than covers this little flaw. This is an incredibly rich, roasty, delicious stout, and the alcohol plays a nice background note to all the complexity"
"SkÅL!"
"D = Exceptionally drinkable. A tad hot, but not nearly enough to detract from how smoothly this one goes down."
"D: makes a fine line between sipper and drinker very easy to put down yet i dont want to rush it."
"D- Ten Fidy is world onto its self I've never had a stout quite like it and probably never will not to say that it's the best I've had but by far one of if not the most unique. Every craft beer drinker should experience Ten Fidy."
"Poured into a snifter."
"If there is an imperial stout that goes down easier than this, I for one have yet to try it. This went down WAY too quickly."
"Among the best ""regular"" Russian Imperial Stouts I've had, and much easier to obtain than most of them (even if I have to drive out of state)."
"What a deceptive beer - first you notice it because it is a RIS in a can, then it looks and smells great, and then it just lets down big time in the taste. Weird."
"Poured from can to snifter. Thin brown head fades quick atop the pitch black oil in the glass. I get the scent of chocolate and a little molasses and perhaps toffee late. Roasted malts are also present. The taste is what I expected ecept for maybe a little more chocolate and a slight alcohol warming in the throat. This beer is big and full-bodied. Dangerously drinkable though a water break is needed between pours to restore the pallate. Another great beer suggested by richbrew."
"A RIS in a can - as an old-school bottle guy, still seems a bit odd. Perhaps the darkest pour I've seen - like squid ink. Nominal head. Very sweet malt flavors - molasses predominant, with some toffee in the background. ABV well integrated and lends a touch of pepper. Sweetness seemed a bit out of balance and bordered on cloying."
"Overall I'm impressed by my first Imperial Stout out of a can. I can only hope that the other Oskar Blues brew I traded for (Gordon) is as good as this one was. Thanks to JosephLondon for the trade!"
"D: Might be hard to get through more than two of these, although it does sip quite nicely. So flavorful that you'd want to grab another but they are quite strong. Think I'll savor the rest of this one while finishing up a movie."
"Very enjoyable and very smooth."
"This is an extremely good beer. Almost perfect. Would love to try a barrel aged version."
"pours pitch black with a dark copper head that fades away, only to leave some lacing around the edges. A little fizz here and there, but nothing noticeable on site. There's a few different aroma categories/groups I associate with stout and this one hits one of them on the head. Roasted malt, dark/semi-sweet/bitter chocolate notes. It kinda gives the illusion of some alcohol scents, but it didn't fool me this time. This one is smooth. The flavor leans more towards the dark and roasted flavors. Just enough carbonation to stir things up but not disrupt each sip. It works well with the roasty aspect. i would definitely sip this one. At 9.5%. I think the can also helped the pour. I've had a few other Oskar Blue beers and it's even easier to get a good pour with a can. Anyways. This is a smooth, highly enjoyable (and accessible) top notch stout."
"Only gets better as it warms, definitely something I'll sip and savor, took about 45 minutes to drink...will be trying this one again!"
"I wish I had steady access to this in IL, but unfortunately I don't. The good news is that I have friends in the area and visit it on occassion myself, so our luggage just got heavier."
"Drinkability is hindered a bit by some alcohol heat, but it's not overbearing and does add the nice cherry flavors. Also, it's so thick that it constantly reminds you how big it is. Overall this is one of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts for being so unique, and it's probably one of the best beers to drink when you're feeling cold and dreary."
"This is quite a massive stout and it's constantly on the edge of collapsing into a sweet and bitter mess, but for the most part I think it manages to deliver. I had this at room temperature and I think I would have liked to have had it served a few degrees cooler."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth."
"D- I'm really enjoying this one. Not drinking it to fast. I'm just taking it all in after another cold night in Florida...yup 40 degrees. This one is warming me up from the inside out. I still can't believe it came from a freaking can! I will def be buying this again. I'm gonna hold onto one for a while to see what happens to it."
"A big fucking beer right here. from a can. A smokey mocha milkshake. Love these in the winter."
"Overall Impression: Don't let the can fool you, this is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that's not barrel aged that you'll ever have!!! In truth, I would have thought that it was a barrel aged beer based on the complexity and depth of flavor."
"Ever seen the commercials with the engine sludge? I think Oskar Blues found a way to CAN that stuff. OK, seriously I think I'm going to order this tomorrow morning at Starbucks. **NOTE** I'm not a fan of Imperial Stouts but this one caught my attention, maybe cause its in a can and I love that a good beer can come from a can. Although the taste is very good, strong like a double shot of espresso but calms down rather quickly. A MUST TRY!"
"Highly recomended."
"Not a beer you expect to come out of can. Finally, an imperial stout that you can take to the beach!...hahaha"
"D) Overall, excellent. At 9.5% ABV it is way too easy to drink several. For some reason I seem to recall this being more coffee tasting and less fruit tasting when I had this before. Which is what I would like. However, this was still a definite pleasurable RIS."
"Overall, this beer is a fine ris. Its sweet, which is fine but if it was balanced out better with either some hops or a more robuse coffee it would be world class."
"D - Great imperial stout...only a bit of alcohol heat holds this back from being extremely drinkable. Very complex and well rounded stout...definitely a go to RIS...highly recommended."
"D - While not a big fan of the style, this is the best imperial stout I have tried to date."
"An excellent beer to celebrate 50 with, I look forward to trying the can next time..."
"This is a really nice stout. One of the better ones i've had. Definitely worth a try if you can get it."
"Pours a black we'll only see when we're staring at the back of our eyelids while lying in our graves. The walnut head is not too much to speak of, rising up to about a half-finger at its zenith, but this completes the image of death: no head can survive when the presence of The End is so omnipresent. The aroma reeks with elements of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, even an only slightly perceptible hint of smoke. The taste relies heavily on that dark roasted malt flavor, with bits of vanilla, cocoa, and, yes, even that smoke making cameo appearances. This guy sits heavily on the tongue, yes, but not so heavily as to give the experience a negative connotation. Regardless, he's very smooth for his weight and ABV, allowing him to rise above the preconceived notions of his character, ascending to a lofty, relatively drinkable plateau of beery goodness."
"D: A sipper for sure, but a great one. I think this may have just overtaken Old Rasputin as my go to big stout. I started a forum discussion a few weeks ago asking if this brew was worth the $4+ per can. In short: yes, it is. Go buy some, NOW."
"Drinkability - enjoyable, unique for a stout, very tasty"
"d - Overall I really enjoyed Ten FIDY. I thought the bittersweet chocolate smell/taste was great and the only small knock I'd have against it would be a small amount of heat from the alcohol smell/taste. I will definitely be buying more of this and will be putting a few cans in the cellar to see how it develops."
"Looks kind of dark with a good-looking mocha head. Very lovely aromas of chocolates and fruits, chocolate-covered fruits, s'mores, alcohol, and just enough soy sauce. Very rich and thick, but just barely sweet. Bittersweet chocolate taste graduates to roasted coffee on a slightly warm finish. Rich enough that you have to take your time with this one, but it's far from tiring. Easily up there with Stone as a top-notch RIS."
"The alcohol is quite well hidden, and it's an all around very enjoyable stout. I'd actually pit this against some of the more hyped up (non-BA) imperial stouts of all time."
"Ten FIDY is an excellent Imperial Stout. Perfect for a bitter cold night like the one it was consumed on."
"Smell is nutty with hints of chocolate and molasses. It's obviously better as it warms, and the chocolate and malty flavors show through. I think this is an excellent stout--it's a bit pricey, but there is no questioning the quality. It should be enjoyed as a nightcap, and goes well with a lot of different food choices."
"edit: I just realized that this is an imperial stout, not an RIS. Therefore, my minor complaints about floral/fruityness and more harsh/alcohol taste are, well, duh. I guess my main disappointment was due to the fact I thought this was an RIS."
"Overall very drinkable, an excellent beer."
"D - This is not a session beer. Take it slow or it will knock you on your ass. Hell, it may knock you on your ass anyway."
"There is something so utterly decadent about an Imperial Stout in a can, but I love it. In fact, I love Oskar Blues...they seem to nail every style on the head in a robust and flavorful way. This may be my new favorite RIS."
"This is by far the biggest, most viscous, syrupy, blackest, and roastiest beers I've had. The line about ""would you like a fork with that?"" might actually apply to this one. Not dry at all, it just lays there on your tongue. Alcohol taste is there but not objectionable. Can't imagine what the original gravity is for this one. I just bought one can to try it, don't really see myself getting this again. Trying not to be too hard on the score since I don't want to be judging the style vs the beer, but this almost didn't seem like finished beer, more like dark malt extract."
"Overall, an excellent choice, despite the high cost and outward appearance."
"This beer has a rich flavor with heavy chocolate notes and hints of coffee. The blend of malts balances the flavor and while the beer is high in alcohol content there is little to no heat on the pallet. It has a full body mouthfeel and a sweet aftertaste that lingers. An exceptional Russian Imperial."
"I just wish this was available in Vermont."
"It was ok and weird at the same time. In many ways you really couldn't put your taste buds on it.Drunk from a chilled point to room temp with a heavy alcohol after taste.Almost like a thin winey stout I got used to it in the end and at 9.3 per can its a fast buzz."
"never tasted anything quite like this. excellent beer. definitely the best stout I've had to date. on my top 10 list of all time!"
"D: WOW, this blew the roof of my expecations, the hype is true! I was expecting a great brew, but the price for a canned beer threw me off a bit. I can now safely say there is no need to be afraid, great brews can come in cans!!!! This was one of my top brews of all time, an amazingly complex and serious yet smooth and easy drinking brew, a tour de force! Amongst RIS's, I rank this equal to Founders Impy as the best I've had and could not recommend it higher. Go out of your way to find a can of this bad boy and pop the top, you won't be disappointed."
"Smooth with a capital smoo, rich and creamy texture. Full bodied. Wish for a bit more nose. Sip and enjoy cause this beer rocks!"
"Overall- very sweet and strong flavor. lots of chocolate and fruit, not much roast or bitterness. a great character but sweet and filling."
"Drinkable stout based upon flavor, but can only handle a few per night due to the MF. Will keep stocked!"
"This impy definitely puts me in mind of Bells Expedition in its massive body and flavor. Tons of bitter chocolate, coffee, toffee, figs, dates, plums, roast, and a dash of smoke are beautifully set of in the finish by some mightily citric hops. The creaminess is off the scale, and the finish is nearly endless.This sure as hell ain't no session ale, in fact its about as definite a sipper as I've ever tasted. Ten W Fidy is absolutely the best nickname for this flavorful beast!"
"Drinkability: This is probably the first and last RIS that I will give a 5 to drinkability. The thick, creamy, chewy body's alcohol is so well hidden you'd thick you were drinking chocolate milk. This beer is absolutely amazing."
"Drinkability: This one should be one to sip because of the ABV, but the carbonation makes you want to drink it more like a soft drink (though obviously the flavor is too heavy to drink it quite THAT quickly)...but I'm not sure I would be able to get through the whole thing that way. So I'm presented with the quandary of trying to give this one a drinkability rating....keeping in mind that it's also a 9.5% ABV...it's quite difficult. I think, though, that with the combination of all the factors at hand, the drinkability is pretty high."
"Ten FIDY is a very good Russion Imperial Stout and well worth trying when available. Very drinkable and full of flavor. The best RIS from a can I've ever had!"
"This is officially my favorite RIS, with sincere apologies to Rasputin. Velvety, rich, knock-you-on-your-ass powerful, it's sex in a can. I've been a member of BA for awhile now, and it was so good I had to honor it with my first public review."
"If you find this beer: don't walk, RUN to check it out!!! You won't be dismayed."
"Smooth ebony with a dark chocolatey milkshake lid of dense foam that melts slowly leaving sheets of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is big and rich. Anise, black strap molasses, dark fruit and rum mixed with a bit of roasty grain. The flavors are full and rich, mirroring the nose with an added charred bitterness and warming alcohol in the finish. Sticky feeling full bodied, chalky mouthfeel with mild creamy carbonation that adds to the drinkability. Nice. I wish I could get this in Indy because I could see enjoying Ten FIDY on a regular basis."
"D.) Not as drinkable as its lower-octane cousins like Guiness Porter or Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but far and away the most drinkable high-octane RIS I've found to-date. I'd call this a session beer..., if you paced yourself and didn't have any obligations the following morning. I will be buying this beer again."
"Libation: Very, very nice. The smell was quite impressive but concerned me because I didn't want it to taste exactly like the smell. Fortunately I wasn't disappointed after the first sip. A very robust and complex stout, this is unexpectedly smooth and drinkable given the high ABV. I like this beer a lot, no one flavor dominates, rather they combine nicely for the flavor punch. Tasty."
"Overall - Really good, top class, Russian Imperial Stout. One of the best examples of the style in my opinion and very highly recommended."
"This beer is not made to be ""drinkable"". I am wrapping up my first and only beer now and I don't want another one tonight. Ten Fidy's battery of my palate has rendered it useless for longer than I care to say awake. Still, I have to give it a 4 based on the fact it is not supposed to be drinkable."
"I had this at Plan B in Glastonbury, CT, paired with a moderately spicy and creamy veggie burger. The garlic mayo and beans in the patty made the veggie burger predominantly creamy, so the warming alcohol and roasted, occasionally hoppy bite of the Ten Fidy provided a perfect accompaniment."
"finaly had the chance to get this one and it was worth every bit the wait!!!!"
"Drinkability is rather good given the tasty character and the well-hidden alcohol content. I would definitely have another one, but the prohibitive $5 a can price keeps me from having another, which is probably a good thing. Still, Ten FIDY is a worthy example of a RIS, something I'd definitely not mind having again."
"VERY GOOD! Got it from a friend who was under the impression it was a Pale ale, hope he isn't too disappointed. Doubt he will be!"
"Drinkability - Very rich and boozy; filling. Nice sipper though."
"Drinkability- I would love to have another, but I only picked one up. I know a solution to that problem...."
"that being said, i'll still buy this again, even at 5 bucks a can."
"well worth checking out."
"Pours deep black with little head,minimal lacing,thick smell of prune and rich malts,slight cocoa but much more like a big bowl of roasted smokey fruit,taste is true to form and not as boozy as thought,smoothy mouth feel a tad rich and thick but highly drinkable,outstanding RIS"
"Drinkability is that most subjective notion where we consider things like experience and price. At $14.49/4-pack, my lasting thought involves this costing more than FBS. As the template for stouts the Ten Fidy fails to compare. Though this beverage is far thinner, I'd easily and enjoyably down two FBS before I'd consider reaching for this. With no prior attention to the malt liquor-like marketing (""Ten Fidy--Half-Baked. Fully Roasted.""), perhaps my expectations were falsely elevated. In fact, the more I ponder it, the more the marketing strikes me as apt: this is like the malt liquor of Russian Imperial Stouts."
"D: This beer is DANGEROUS. You will find yourself cracking open another can after this, and then you will find yourself trying to hold yourself back from cracking open another. After failing to do so, you will find yourself falling into a deep sleep filled with dreams of Ten FIDY and a fluffy chocolate, roasted malted, beer land."
"Pours a thick black body with a one finger tan head with lace patches on top of a roasted malt aroma with hints of coffee. A smooth, creamy not too harsh beer that doesn't have a really dry quality but is more laid back and smooth. Hints of coffee and chocolate underlying a mild roasted malt finish and a touch of dark fruit lead to an easy to drink RIS with a well-hidden ABV and crisp finish. I like my RIS a little stronger but for availability and price (and I can't believe it is canned) this is a must try."
"Another can from 11-11-10, poured on 11-29-11. Excellent. None of the bitterness noted above except for roastiness. Rich bittersweet chocolate. Bready, heavy, sticky."
"For a RIS, very drinkable, pleasant. Doesn't strike me as particularly complex, but it gives you more or less what you'd expect from a RIS."
"The taste is simple. Nothing offensive at all, but nothing special. I bet the barrel-aged versions add some complexity. Definitely try those if you have them available. But, unless you really have a need for the can packaging, there are much better imperial stouts available."
"Wish I had more than this 1 can. Thanks to Viggo for sending it my way!"
"D - Obviously not one to bust out for a day at the beach, but it is real good so it is real drinkable."
"If ""Reputation"" were a category, Ten Fidy would surely rate a 4.5 or 5.0, and the hype is not unjustified. This is a supremely good beer. For me, though, it sits a notch or two behind the likes of Bourbon County, The Abyss, Speedway, but remains a definite winner, by any means."
"This is a stout you have to get no matter what format but the draft is not to be missed."
"D- This is, so far to me, one of the great RIS's. The character matches the style to a tee. The alcohol is mildly present but never obnoxious and it had that dark complexity that I sometimes can't get my head around with a wonderful balance. This beer, to me is on par with the most hyped,well known, and infamous stouts- but this is readily available and a must-try for the style. The only other widely available RIS I have found that is this good is the seasonal Stone IRS"
"Aroma 4, Appearance 4.5, Taste 4.5, Palate 4.5, Drinkability 4.5"
"D: High ABV and just overall ridiculousness would prevent more than one can in a session but oh my goodness what a fine brew."
"Mouthfeel is full and chewy with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Ten Fidy pours a deep, dark, obsidian - with a slight, tasty looking brown head that dissipates pretty fast, leaving a ring of lace around the glass. Smell is mostly of sweet, roasted malts, chocolate and a hint of alcohol - with a touch of coffee. Taste starts with dark chocolate, followed by a robust roasted flavor - a sweet finish is followed up by a well matched hop bite. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky smooth - low carbo and a little sticky on the palate. Its very drinkable for the style - just watch out for the 9.5% - a good one to have on a cold winter's night!"
"D-overly sweet but still has an ok balance of flavors. the nose is sweeter than the flavor but the sweetness does dominate."
"A very fine Russian Imperial Stout, but I'd recommend Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout over this because it's a bit better and cheaper."
"D - I'm drinking this down no problem. I don't taste any alcohol.. carbonation is low.. very chewy, thick, sweet and malty.. i'm glad i reviewed this once again.. This is an ""A" beer no doubt!"
"The feel is medium bodied that is pretty surprising for an Imperial stout but it is the first that I have had a can. It does down easy and has a limited aftertaste."
"Couldn't drink it every day, but a damn fine drop."
"Anyway this beer poured thick with a heck of a head, reddish dark brown with a massive tan head, Smell is smokey a with hint of molasses. Taste is bitter sweet, kind of like chicory, walnuts and a few other flavors. This beer is quite thick and coats the tongue.. Kind of heavy to drink alot of but goes down easy none the less."
"(Without a doubt, the best beer I've yet had from a can)."
"Drank one and I thought it was impossible to handle another. I had a slice of some frozen chocolate pie then had another. I felt fine. I'm sure if I was on an empty stomach I would have been knocked out!"
"D- drinks like a ""big"" beer should yet never really shows the 9.5% ABV, quite a complex brew, tastes different w/ every sip & makes you have to keep drinking it"
"D - This is extremely delicious but due to the high gravity and alcohol it is a sipping beer. One can usually lasts an hour, and it's enough for the night."
"D- Very solid brew and its pretty cool that it comes from a can."
"Alcoholic warmth, dark fruit (black currants, cassis), burnt caramel and roast malt are like four good friends guiding you on a tour of awesome town. Licorice and toffee support. Still a little young, this has 5 potential. It's a kitten puncher and a half."
"This beer has very mellow flavors after one year. It is nicely balanced between the sweetness and bitterness of the malts. I would be interested to try a fresh one to see what it is like with more hop presence. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can get this beer at stores near me, as I bought these year-old cans at a store while visiting family for the holidays. I do have a couple more to age for another year or so, it will be interested to see how much more mellow this can be by then."
"Drinkability:I've been really wanting to try this brew a while this definitely appeared in the glass as labeled. Looked like thick motor oil. This was a very enjoyable brew just a bit spendy. Age would do this wonders and probably unmask plenty of flavor."
"On the whole, this is an excellent brew, and goes a long way toward showing that canned beer should not be looked down upon."
"MF/D: A little bit thin for a RIS, I still give this beer a 5 on the MF aspect because it really is one of the smoothest, most well rounded stouts I have had the pleasure of enjoying. A four pack of these bad boys on a cold night and you are set."
"Huge thanks to SpdKilz, Carleton is the man. Cheers!"
"Very well balanced and drinkable for the style. Elegant. It's so strange that this beer comes from a can."
"the rotten fruit is really bugging me. i dont remember it from previous tastings, so ill take that into account. but its odd that it comes when im first taking notes on it. this was the second disappointment in a row after founders breakfast stout came through with charry, ashy, and bitter characteristics that i didnt recall from past experiences. if i find on future tastings that these characteristics were specific to the can i shared last night, ill alter my scores. but this one was a strange disappointment."
"D - It's a pretty well hidden 10.5%. I could definitely see drinking another...if I had one. But that's a different issue. For a widely available stout, this is pretty good to always be on the shelves."
"How can such a heavy brew have so many light flavors? Both complex and compulsively drinkable. Just made an instant fan."
"The drink is luxuriously full-bodied with just enough carbonation to keep any sugary stickiness to a minimum. Highly drinkable even considering the burly ABV. Russian Imperial Stout in a can? Hell Yeah!"
"D - Very god beer. Very complex and robust. Alcohol is not up front but present. But you'd never know it's 9.5%. Be careful...it'll sneak up on you."
"D - This is without a doubt the tastiest RIS I've had so far. Booze is hidden fairly well. Very complex and robust."
"Tastes like dark fruit and liquified roasted barley. I knew upon the first sip that this is my favorite RIS so far. Up until now, I've mostly had coffee/oatmeal imperial stouts, which I generally thought I preferred to regular RISs, but I haven't had that many RISs, mostly old rasputin. I prefer this to old rasputin. I prefer this to every RIS i recall having. Wow. I never thought I was an RIS person. This actually tastes really good to me. Maybe I just don't like old rasputin. i should try to find other RISs. I'm craving another ten fidy."
"I always enjoy this beer. I like it because it is so well balanced and not one flavor dominates."
"12/12/10 - Drinking a 2009 can that's exactly 1 year old. Really dark brown head on this one, one of the darkest I've seen. Alcohol on the nose and moreso in the taste is harsher than I remember it being, still it is reasonably blended with an excellent roasted malt/cocoa profile. Definitely some anise and hints of fruit and hops present. Mouthfeel is very nice and creamy with medium carbonation. Extremely warming on the stomach. A big, boozy, robust imperial stout for a cold winter night."
"My first thought is that it is from a can. After that first thought passed and I took my first sip all i could this is this a pretty d@mn good beer. Inky black look, smells of chocolate and sweetness. Nice smooth taste, just a beautiful feel across the tongue. Nice beer I'd have again, just not so sure how many I could handle all at once."
"This is an excellent RIS. Full of great, hearty flavors, and never too sweet. A winner all around."
"Although this is a very good beer, it's stupidly overpriced. $5 for a single can? C'mon Oskar Blues."
"A great RIS. If you're a fan of the style, do yourself a favor and give this one a try. Even if you're not a big RIS fan, give it a shot."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Unibroue tulip, can date 11/25/09. Huge mocha colored head (beautiful) rests atop a ""black as the night itself"" body for quite a while leaving sticky, soapy mocha lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts, coffee and a touch of chocolate malt. Taste is warming, chocolaty, roasty, coffee-like, and very smooth considering the ABV and freshness of this can. Aging plenty of these for down the road, I'm excited that a fresh one is this tasty. Perfect pairing with the cold weather thats finally moving into Florida."
"No for the uninitiated but for those who understand a beautiful stout,"
"I will be recommending this to my friends who like IRS. Try this one and I think you will like it."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just ok for this one. The super heavy feel combined with the high ABV will limit it. Overall, this is a really good beer. Complex, chocolatey, and smooth, highly recomended. Skal."
"drinkability: met expectations. it's world class"
"Overall - A delicious RIS, highly worth a try!"
"This is probably my second favorite RIS behind Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. But damn $18 for a 4 pack...before tax!?!?!?! Count me out. I will maybe, maybe buy one more 4 pack before the season is up but that will be it. Still can't deny it is a fine and nearly perfect brew. Have to give it up to the name and can too. Love the ""this dog'll hunt"" on the back."
"All in all, I'd say go for it. This is a great brew and one that I will no doubt be returning to. Cheers."
"D: Basically perfect. Lost a point here simply because it's a heavy hitter and if you haven't stopped after 3 or 4, you probably should."
"D--I hate to say this, but as high as the ABV's are, I would gladly work on a few of these on a cold winter night. One of the best beers I have had in a while and a terrific version of a RIS. Highly recommended."
"I'm pretty impressed with this brew. I'd put it in my top 3 RIS, behind only Old Rasputin & Darkness. (Yes, in that order)"
"Pours a jet black color out of the can with a bold, creamy brown head. Aroma is of coffee, oatmeal, chocolate and molasses. Taste features a prominent oatmeal taste, with bitterness coming from the coffee and some hops. With a little bit of sweetness coming from the chocolate and molasses. Rich, hearty, mouthfeel"
"D- For being as high as the ABV is, it goes down really smooth. You get a little bit of warmth from it which makes it a great beer to enjoy on a cold night."
"The can seems like a novelty at first but I'd pass over quite a few stouts in a bottle for this one, the best of the Oskar Blues in my humble opinion."
"I have purchased a 4 pack of this several times now and always enjoy each can. My friends are always impressed that something like this can come out of a can."
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the cloying sweetness. If that element had been toned down, it would make for a much nicer RIS. Still worth picking up, but I'm tempted to age the other cans further to see if it will mellow."
"Overall I find this to beer on-tap to just slightly edge its canned brother and it has certainly become a favorite and staple in my fridge for years to come. The complex full flavors with great drinkability give many of its bottled brethren a run for their money. If you see this on-tap it is a must. Highly recommended."
"D: I opened one with largadeer, who wound up leaving early and making me finish the can on my own. It was very hard. That, and the price increases, and my decreasing tolerance for sickly-sweet RISes, have made me a little tired of this beer overall. I don't see myself buying this again."
"Overall this is a good RIS, however, not top 100 beers in my opinion. Good beer, above average, but not great. Rather have an Old Rasputin. Like many Oscar blues beers, overhyped."
"Overall: I have personally been hit or miss on Oskar Blues' beers. This, along w/Dales Pale is definitely a hit!"
"Better than the Abyss I had tonight."
"Poured a deep oily black hue with a one finger creamy brown head. There was good retention and sticky lacing. The smell featured an upfront sweet caramel with background noted of coffee, dark chocolate and smoke. The flavor consisted of a rich burnt grain with sweet malts, coffee and cocoa. Some good dark fruits detected as well. The mouthfeel was very heavy and chewy with a slight warming alcohol."
"D - Hearty beer and the best stout in a can period."
"D-The alcohol is hidden much better than the expedition, coming in very smoothly with the finish only (as opposed to being evident up-front in the Expedition). Very smooth for an RIS of this strength and for how young it is."
"Poured into a tulip OIL black, with a nice two finger tan head that stayed put for a good while. Great lacing all the way down, just as an RIS should be. The smell is just as an RIS should be, however I would like it to be a little stronger. The roasted carmel scents are there, but it's just not kick you in the butt like the taste is. And the taste is well balanced, with no noticeable spice that might throw out the style. Just perfect. The mouthfeel is very nice as well. There is a alcohol warmth to this, but for it's age it isn't all that overwhelming. Another perfection. Which all in all makes this a very nice RIS sipper."
"Thick bodied and well carbonated. Great complexity and delicious flavors. I am thoroughly enjoying this stout. Not sure why I'm picking up the anise smells/flavors...thankfully I love black licorice. It still tastes a tad young, so I think I'll age the other two cans I have left. I can only imagine how tasty this will be with a year on it."
"Woa, talk about impressive. Only the 2nd beer I've had from this brewery, and I'm still most impressed. This is one of the greatest looking beers....ever. From the can into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass this beer pours out completely black in color, really no highlights to it. I had a huge foamy head that was one of the most unique colors I've ever seen. Similar in color to coffee with a slight amount of creamer to it, but almost had a reddish tint to it and it provides some decent lacing, spots all over the glass from top to bottom. The smell consists mostly of roasted malts and heavy amounts of chocolate slightly blended with some coffee. I actually expected to smell a touch of alcohol, but nothing. You can pick up on the hop aroma, but I couldn't notice it until it was room temperature. Excellent taste to this, absolutely wonderful. Same combination as the smell, it really has heavy amounts of chocolate, almost like fudge. There are roasted malts which adds to the initial sweetness. The hops are much easier to single out in the taste than the smell, pine. I noticed the coffee hints right before the hops. Extremely well balanced flavor with all the different flavors, well done! The mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Full bodied with an excellent texture to it, heavy, sweet and a bitter finish. All of this blended together so well leaves this an extremely drinkable beer. 2 for 2 from Oskar Blues in my opinion."
"This might be the Star Wars geek in me, but my favorite part of this beer besides its ink color is the ""join the dark side"" quote on the bottom."
"D: A fantastic RIS, the cherry and wood/nutty flavors complement each other so well. Highly recommended. A very different RIS with fantastic flavors. Check this one out!"
"D - This is exactly the kind of beer that make big RIS and American Imperial Stouts my favorite style of beer, just when I think another style of beer is making its way up, this comes along and blows my taste buds away. Excellent job Oskar Blues"
"God made Oskar Blue's. Oskar Blue's made beer. Perfect 5."
" Drinkability is also good for this style. Light enough to keep 'em coming for most of the night. Well played Oskar well played."
"This is a beer to be savored. It lives up to the hype and the somewhat hefty price tag. I highly recommend it to lovers o the RIS style."
"M: Not that much CO2, but that works just fine. A real god imperial stout, will drink again if it ever gets to Sweden..."
"Beer is full bodied and sweet. There is a lot of roast at the end of it. Beer is thick my mouth, like syrup. Mouthfeel is good though and drinkability is high. No aftertaste to speak of."
"O: way too sweet, aftertaste is very good but sweetness makes it difficult to drink"
"If not for the high ABV I could see drinking this all day. This is amazing stuff."
"BAM! Big beer in yer face n down yer gullet! Served with a nice fine foamy, frothy tan head and good lace. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is very malty, roasty, burned sugar, dark ripe fruits, and a bit of chocolate. Flavor's the same but way more intense. There's a sharp blast of bittersweetness upon first sip. Body is full, rich, and like very ripe fruit. Excellent carbonation too. Boozy at the end. Ok for a long slow sipping session. Careful though!"
"D- Could have a few of these without doing too much damage but more then that and i would either start getting too full or too plastered."
"D: A full bodied, well-balanced Russian Imperial Stout. Despite the high ABV and IBUs, the beer is wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Definitely a must have for the approaching winter months--this will keep you warm on a cold day! Plus it comes in a can, and we all know that everyone likes it in the can!"
"D - Excellent sipping drink. High abv presence is not felt at all which makes this drink desirable."
"I went through this can pretty quickly and was tempted to grab another."
"D: Ten FIDY doesn't hide its alcohol quite as well as some RIS's but it is tasty enough to keep me raising my glass."
"Best beer of the night, even if you count the Three Floyds tasting later that evening."
"In my opinion this beer is a sipper. A little too hot to want to drink another, but likable for an occasional beer diversion."
"Seriously one of the best stouts I've had.. a contender to the FBS by all means. A definite brew to look out for and have a try. Aside from the price, it's worth buying and poured into your glass."
"J"
"My previous review of this beer was quite a bit lower, I don't know if palate has just changed substantial since last year or this can is just way better. But I am finding this beer very enjoyable."
"Overall, the drinkability is very good for a stout this strong. I could easily have a couple glasses at one sitting, but it is rich and filling and will catch up to you. Bravo, Oskar Blues!"
"D - This is real nice would definately drink some more as this has excellent drinkability."
"Pours a viscous black with a creamy tan froth. The head isn't too thick, but provides nice lacing. The nose offers aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, black licorice, spicey/slightly piney hops, slight irish cream liquor, dark berries (prunes?), & chocolate cake. Very thick on the palate with great carbonation and sweet, but not too sweet flavors of everything I got on the nose. There is an alcohol presence on the back end and a subtle bitterness in the beginning that lingers to the finish. Overall, a great brew that'd be good for an after dinner/dessert beer...one is definitely enough."
"I had this at a place called fatheads in Pittsburgh, if you ever have the chance you got to visit. This beer has a very very dark appearance with a thick dark brown head to it. This also has a pretty high ABV and you can feel it on the taste buds. Chocolate and coffee flavors try to balance it out but comes up short. Overall a good beverage but could not have many glasses of this stuff."
"Honestly, I'm not sure why this gets such high marks. It's an okay imperial stout, but there are so, so many that are far better (BT, DL, GI BCS, Abyss, KBS, Expedition, Old Rasputin, Serpent's Stout, etc). I don't know when I will get around to drinking the other three cans I have of this brew."
"Drinkability is fantastic! It goes down very smooth and is quite tasty. I'd want to say its a great session beer but the abv seams quite well hidden and could probably sneak up on you easy if you have a few. Overall its definitely one of the best examples of this style I've had and will always be welcome in my fridge!"
"D- Wow. Very very drinkable, despite the ABV... just scrumptious, and it goes down dangerously easy."
"picked up a 4-pak in hudson..poured a thick black velvet creamy blanket with black cherry sticky lacing and ring.. canned on 102709 ..the smell was chocolate with dark fruit and molasses/ amaretto smells along with fig and coffee..the taste is malt/roasted coffee and sweet and creamy chocolate that fills the mouth and senses with flavors of currant fruit and toffee a little caramel some hops all blended for a superior and smooth RIS..this is one of the best in the US..as it warms as im writing this it just gets more complex in the layers of flavors and just gets very smooth and creamy..highly recommended"
"drinkability: good"
"I like danger."
"D: Definitely a dessert sipping beer. A high alcohol content keeps this to maybe one or two in a sitting. A most delicious beer!"
"The sky is the limit with drinkability. The 9.5% ABV is extremely well hidden, but this beer really shines as the weather drops. And not to mention its the best canned beer I've ever had! Superb job Oskar Blues!."
"d - ive only had one after a four pack i would be feeling quite nice"
"Drinkability: As for as 10% ABV, it's certainly felt a bit by the end of 12oz, but it's also a very friendly drink. Rarely does the alcohol ever peak through, and if it does, it's never off-putting. Worth seeking out and spending a few bucks for a 4-pack, as it really makes an excellent beer for cold nights, desserts, camping trips, or really any occasion."
"Very nice aroma with vanilla bourbon, cinnamon, milky chocolate and roasted malt. Nose is complex and light. Taste is all milk chocolate, breakfast blend coffee, brown sugar, maple and roasted vanilla beans. The mouthfeel complements the character well. This beer was very whip creamy as if it came from a cask. Creamiest, low bubble stout I've come across but it was close to perfect."
"Pours a thick black liquid with a two finger head, deep brown with reddish tones. As expected it dissipates fairly quickly and leaves some streaks of lacing. Aroma is rough and abrasive, primarily burnt, roasted notes with a potent alcohol presence. Background ha some sweeter chocolate and coffee aromas as it warms up. Medium bodied, creamy and smooth, with soft carbonation. Very nice, but not quite as thick or syrupy as expected. Finish has more of the roast barley and burnt malt flavors, little hop or sweetness. Flavor starts a little harsh, strong hop presence and burnt flavors. Middle and finish mellows out with mild milk chocolate and sweeter malt before the finish described above. I'm conflicted about this, I had high expectations for it and it's not bad, but I can't really decide what's holding this back from really exciting me. I'll chalk this up as worth a try for the novelty of being canned, reputation, etc but at this price I'd much rather have Rasputin, Storm King, etc."
"Drinkability: very complex flavor. i thought the nose had too much alcohol. its a good sipping winter warmer."
"D - fairly high for the style."
"This isn't bad, but not all that good either. B-/B and not worth 15 a 4 pack, though I wouldn't mind getting to try it again"
"D-Good but there are many other stouts out there that I would rather drink but still it was good and easier to finish than a stout bomber."
"Drinkability - Honestly pretty damn drinkable but when I think about it I would have to say one and I'm done. Granted I had planned on this being the end beer of the night, but even if it wasn't I don't think I could do two of these in a sitting. This is a great beer and is a great way to end the night so it is fitting that it is a ""one and I'm done"" type of beer for me. Can't wait to bust one of these out on a cooler fall evening."
"I promise to re-review if I ever get the chance to do so!"
"Glad to be able to try it and review it. Not a beer I would share with less seasoned palates."
"An excellent well balanced RIS, compares well to all but the top-level of bottled examples of the style."
"Overall, a very good beer that's worth seeking out."
"mouthfeel is creamy and it's unbelievable this is a 10%'er...so smooth."
"F: Finishes pretty stouty and dry, and like super bitter dark chocolate. A chocolate milk comes to mind, chocolate milk that would conjure up the depths of oblivion and demon spirits from beyond the gates of Grenach! I can feel the lost souls escaping from the thick syrup into my tongue and trying to run away and but getting swallowed by the richness."
"D - At 10%, this would kick my ass if I opened another can. That said, it's very approachable for the style and ABV. Great things do come from cans, there's no doubt about it with this one!"
"D - Incredibably drinkable. This is smooth,big and well balanced. The alcohol is completely covered up and the taste is awesome. My only complaint would be how sweet the first sip is, but the hops kick in right away and provide a nice balance."
"D=drinkable for the style,however a little sweet and too potent for too many."
"I wasn't expecting this to be such a huge dessert beer, and it probably wouldn't have been a problem if I hadn't already had two helpings of pie. Just too much sugar all round. Tone it down and call me back."
"Drinkability: As with all imperial stouts, its not really a beer for an occasion, however this is more drinkable then many even for being a 10% motor oil looking 98 ibu monster. Will drink again especially as winter dawns defiantly a fireplace sipper. Ones really enough to fill your stomach."
"Pours a deep dark black. Full frothy khaki head, retention is good and lacing is nice. Smell is of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, earth, dark fruit. Taste follows smell with a focus on the coffe, chocolate earth and dark fruit. Oily, viscous, full bodied. Not too sticky and little aftertaste. Very good tasting RIS that leans a little away from tradition."
"D - A great example of the RIS style. Very nice combination of malt flavors and well-balanced with ample hop bitterness backing up the richness. The only thing that would hold me back on the drinkability is the 10% abv, which could be dangerous in such a delicious brew. I will definitely be adding this into the winter rotation."
"Finally! I've been meaning to pick this up in Hudson for ages, but every time I go, they are sold out. Thank you so much, Adam, for the chance to try this great beer!"
"Amazing, top of the line Imperial Stout here! Pours a dark black with the look and consistancy of used motor oil. Rich chocolate-colored two-fingered head. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate. Normally I am not a fan of imperial stouts. Generally they taste like burnt coffee with alcohol added. This isn't like that. This is strong, as an imperial stout should be, but extremely tasty and drinkable. Not something a frat boy is going to chug. Instead it is a very savory sipping beer. Huge delicious chocolate taste with hints of coffee and malts. A slight alcohol burn on the back of the throat after a drink, but not something you are going to taste. Left a dark brown lace on the glass after each drink that required the pint glass to have a second quick rinse afterwards. Generally the imperial stouts I have tried have a very up-front alcohol taste. Not this one at all. Works extremely well after a nice meal as a dessert. I would not give any beer a perfect rating unless it absolutely deserved it. This one does. I have had top-rated imperial stout DarkLord by 3 Floyds Brewery at three seperate beer festivals, and I have to say I prefer Ten Fidy to it. Ten Fidy should be every bit as celebrated as DarkLord! Ten Fidy should be the gold standard that all imperial stouts aspire to."
"~ Purchased this 12 oz can from New Beer Distributors in Manhattan, NY. Pours a syrupy motor oil black with a nice brown head. Aromas are of chocolate, coffee, and licorice. The taste is pretty much what you would expect from a well-crafted RIS. I still cannot get over how this heavenly goodness just poured right out of a can! Who would have thought? This stout is big, bold, and powerfully flavorful. At 10% ABV, it went down smooth, but at this level, you are confined to one, maybe two at best. A great nightcap. Highly recommended. ~"
"A great beer that I would buy over and over again if it were available here in Ohio. Probably the best beer to come out of a can."
"EDIT- despite my glowing praise, I rarely find myself coming back to this one. Price hikes suck. Jumped from $2 a can to $4 a can. No thanks."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable for 10.00% ABV. Smooth, creamy, and just downright good. I'm glad I bought a 4-pack. I'll be keeping an eye out for this bad boy."
"A: Thick cottony head with a deep froth that reminds me of espresso, lots of sticky patches along the edge of the glass, dark in a black hole sort of way - no light passes - 5.00, S: Strong chocolate and espresso aromas, burnt molasses and brown sugar, some pitted fruit smells - 4.50, T: Loaded with cocoa and chocolate, solid hops bite, there's a raisin like sweetness to this beer and some nice roastiness, alcohol is noticeable but quite nicely masked, this is one tasty brew - 4.75, M: Creamy and heavy body - 4.50, D: Another exceptional beer from Oskar Blues, very drinkable though the cost almost edges this outside of my price range, definite a beer for those special occasions - 4.50"

"D- ""This dog'll hunt""...pretty awesome."
"D - A standard Imperial Stout. There was no shock value other than the awesome can. But overall, this was a very good brew."
"Drinkability: Treat it with respect. The alcohol can creep up and bite you in the ass if your not careful. Pretty much what you would expect from a quality RIS. Bear in mind this one is sweet, so if your looking for a dessert beer this one's for you."
"D - Average-plus for the style."
"Poured absolutely black and as much as I don't like the analogy, this actually looked like used motor oil coming from an oil can - very cool effect. Head was fairly thin as expected and was milk chocolate in color. Aromas were of burnt and roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, and a hint of sweetened anise perhaps. It was instantaneously boozy, but not overly, with full notes of roasted malt, dark bakers chocolate, and bold espresso, with the hops providing a somewhat spicy finish and a prickle on the tongue - a very pleasant dark chocolate taste lingers on in the bittersweet finish as well. At 98 ibu, this is tremendously balanced and the bitterness seems to be more burnt and roasty. Alcohol is present, but well concealed and provides some fruity esters resembling ripened dark fruits. Mouth-feel was absolutely excellent - thick and full bodied - one of the best I've had. Overall, this was better than anticipated and fully enjoyable! EXCELLENT!"
"Drinkability: between some of the flavor characteristics and the huge alcohol, this cannot rate super high on drinkability. It's still quite good though."
"Drinkability: Considering the full bodiedness I would definitely have another and probably another after."
"Overall, this was great. I have a bunch more coming in a trade, and I asked my parents to look for some in their local store, as they are in a state Oskar distributes to. Worthy beer and is now my favorite canned offering!"
"Overall, I really like this beer. I think this beer would be awesome if they aged it in bourbon barrels, but I could be wrong. It is a great priced RIS that really packs a ton of flavor. My glass is going faster than I would like it to."
"Thanks again, Wayne!"
"D: A very impressive beer, I'd have this again in a second and actually can't wait to have my next. Being presented out of a can just makes it all the more impressive."
"D - Very drinkable for 10% ABV. A solid RIS that I would buy again."
"I'm still struggling to comprehend the fact that a RIS this good can be found in a can. The appearance is pitch black with a good sized brown head. It has a thick aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. It boasts an impressively complex flavor with lots and lots of dark chocolate, toffee, and brown sugars. Massive mouthfeel and quite a bit of booze make it a bit of a sipper."
"D- Drinkability is good considering the ABV. You would be doing this beer an injustice to do anything but sip due to the nice complexity of flavors. Not to say I couldn't drink a four pack if I had enough time."
"This is one black beer. No light penetrates and thead is about as dark as I've seen. The aroma is roasty, boozy, slightly sweet, and creamy. Notes of coffee, chocolate, and smoke. Like the body, the flavor is full. Roasted malts, tons of coffee, prune, cocoa, wood, and raspberry. Nice bitterness throughout to balance the rich malts. This beer coats the mouth to say the least, and so much flavor makes this one a nice sipper. This has to be the biggest beer in a can and Oskar Blues did one heck of a job!"
"Hats off to Oskar Blues. I thought this would probably be a decent RIS, given the ranking, but it has blown past all of my expectations. Maybe it isn't the most complex RIS out there, but damn is it tasty and highly drinkable for the style. I will definitely be picking up more."
"I am very pleased with this beer. For an RIS, Oskar Blues certainly met the mark."
"A really fine beer that drinks like a port, a real sipper for this cooler evening. So rich and sumptuous. Not overly roasty or even too in your face, yet it has all the rich flavor notes you're looking for in a world-class stout. Best beer in a can."
"blown away by this... when i poured it i knew i was in for something special. i enjoyed every sip of this. everything a RIS should be!"
"Drinkability: due to the strong alchohol presence I have detract from here. It is difficult to have more than one due to the strong flavors."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. The 10% ABV is almost nowhere to be found. Maybe a slight twinge on the swallow, but overall, this beer is pure bready malts and chocolate flavors. It's a shame this beer isn't distributed more widely, as this could become a staple in this Kansas home."
"Still can't believe this beer comes out of a can, I will be picking more up soon."
"Great stuff and in my top 3 Russian Imperial Stouts. I buy at least a 4 pack anytime I see it on the shelf."
"Overall in 5 words - sipper, great can, solid stout"
"D- This one is a sipper for sure. I would love to have more than one can of this. Will definatey look for another."
"D- Delicious brew that is worth seeking out. I really enjoy this one. Thanks to alleykatking for this one!"
"Overall, a very good imperial stout - I wish we got this in Ohio, will definitely be on the lookout for it in the future."
"I must say, it is easy to pass these stupid, cheap looking cans when you are beer hunting if you aren't familiar with OB, but ALL of their beers are extremely delicious and I think the cans add charm and personality to their products! Well done!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the pure size and intensity of the beer, and from how green (and prominent) the hops are."
"D- Its taking all my strength to not chug this all down right away. Its so good! Alcohol is barely perceivable. A very very drinkable RIS."
"D: One of, if not the, easiest drinking Imperial Stout I have come across."
"Overall thoughts: I am partial to a good RIS and have really used AleSmith's Speedway Stout as my basis of comparison for all others. I have read the buzz on Oskar Blues (and this beer in particular) and had to give it a go. What a pleasant surprise...the can, the price, and most importantly, the taste make this one of the most intriguing beers I've had."
"Overall, amazing. Drinkability is awesome, even with the ABV. Very, very easy beer to drink. Wow!"
"Poured into a pint glass. The pour was like a dark motor oil into the glass. Very black. The smell is freshly roasted. Nice. Interesting smell. A definite roasty taste but not overwhelming. It has a nice taste to it that is getting better with every sip. After hearing good things about this beer here, I had to go try it. It is definitely a good beer. Nice overall taste."
"One of the great beer surprises I've had in quite some time. I had this once a while back, and hadn't seen it since. I found it in an unlikely place and grabbed a four pack. I was so knocked out I went and bought up a case. I have had this head to head with Expedition, Stone, Peche Mortal, and Yeti espresso - and it (at least) held it's own with all of them. Maybe the best balanced stout I have ever had. Pours black as motor oil, with a thin but lasting head. Smells and tastes of coffee (and I mean good coffee!). This beer is so smooth it's dangerous! This may be the biggest sleeper in the beer world (in a can, no less!). Long live Oskar Blues!"
"- Hugely drinkable... bit sweet but it must be needed to hide its strength so well... a great all around imperial stout."
"M/D: Tingly carbonation and a medium texture, despite the appearance. Remarkably smooth finish, and the undertones of the mild flavors give it a nice complexity. There is a lot to look for in this beer, and it's texture is light enough that it doesn't make you feel full. The alcohol is non-evident."
"The mouth is smooth and creamy. I think I started drinking this too chilled as I was getting a wallop of soy sauce and this weird sour note. As the beer warmed more to room temp, I could sense more of the roasted characteristics as well as the deep chocolate. Aftertaste was of Tootsie Rolls. Pretty heavy brew that took awhile to consume. Drinkability was hindered for sure. Not bad, but fell short of the hype."
"D: No alcohol in the flavor, and it's like drinking an espresso-brownie beer-shake with some molasses thrown in for good measure. Simply a delightful beer, and I'm glad I've got a couple more cans of it aging."
"This one came in the 12oz can shown in the photo. Pours a dark black color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all chocolate and coffee with just a touch of dark fruits. The flavor has lots of chocolate with some other dark malts following. Also has some dark fruit and tobacco characteristics. Not very bitter. The alcohol is slightly apparent, but not overwhelming. Very smooth. The body is on the heavy side of medium and the drinkability is good. Pretty awesome for a beer in a can."
"12oz can obtained at The Liquor Shoppe in Tygsboro, MA. Pours a completely opaque black with a half inch of short-lived tan head. Roasty dark chocolate, coffee, toast, date, hints of nut, brown sugar, toffee; the slightest hint of alcohol toward the end. Toast, dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee hit the palate right away, with some brown sugar, burnt, dark roasted coffee, toffee nut, and date, along with just the slightest tinge of alcohol warming dominate the exceptionally long finish for this beer. Rich full mouthfeel without being too viscous or syrupy, with light to medium carbonation. While this is definitely a sipper (true to style), one sip most definitely invites another one due to the complexity and tastiness. I am literally floored by this beer. It more than lives up to the hype. Possibly the best RIS I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, this beer is practically perfect in every way. and in a can to boot! Absolutely stellar."
"Great brew that I will continue to stock."
"Drinkability is great in i would love to have a case of this but at 10% couldn't have many at a time though, even though my taste buds are yelling for more. Many thanks to merlin48 for letting me have this little gem to take home with me, the best IRS in a can no doubt but no slouch among the bottle versions either. If you haven't tried this what the hell you waiting for."
"This beer poured from a can on a hot afternoon has a most likely smell of burnt chocolate. Delivers a twice candy bar taste, but not refreshing taste. Buy and store in the winter and save for treats. For friends that will enjoy more than a simple stout."
"great beer for a dessert. excellent."
"This beer pours from the can thick and dark pretty much black in color. There is a nice thick dark tan head. Very nice roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel aroma. The mouthfeel is moderately heavy, but not syrupy and there is a mild buttery feel of alcohol on the lips. The taste is of roasted caramel and dark chocolate with a very mild alcohol taste and warmth in the finish."
"This might be the smoothest Impy stout available...awesome beer. Creamy as hell and milk chocolaty. Alcohol is detectable, but well hidden and deceptively drinkable. A bit of roastiness and coffee flavors, but not as much as most of this style. One fine stout."
"This is a big beer. Pours engine oil black into a glass with a dark brown head. Loads of roasted malt presence in the smell with some hoppiness to balance. The taste is filled with hints of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel, coffee, and toasted grain. The residual sweetness is balanced by the bitterness of roasted grain and hop character. Thick and full bodied in the mouth. This is a fantastic stout."
"Love it"
"This beer's too big for it's own good, and I find it rather boring. Not something I'll be running back to."
"Drinkability - certainly not drinkable, take a 33cc can for 2 or 3 friends, it's too much heavy in mouth, not refreshing at all (even from the fridge)."
"overall a decent beer, probably a tad overhyped, doesnt rank in my top 5 of RIS's but drinkable none the less."
"Pours impenetrable blackness like a Rimbaud poem. A very dark tan head covers the abyss and fades quickly with little lacing left behind. Various aromas of deep dark chocolate, charred wood, licorice, roasted nuts, pine and even honey waft to the nose. Sweet chocolate and caramel reach the tongue first, followed by some spice, a nice hit of hops, more dark chocolates, some alcohol heat, roasted malts and vanilla extract. The aforementioned alcohol heat lingers for a while, but is not bothersome. The creamy smoothness is second to none going down; almost dessert-like, and while the body of this brew leans toward heavy, it doesn't weigh on you like some stouts can. A rich complex brew that goes great by itself, but would pair well with a great meal, and that is coming from one who usually gives a rat's ass about beer pairing with food."
"Delicious and drinkable, although it will slow you down. Cheers!"
"D: Although this beer is exceptional, I can't drink more than one of these. Rich and flavorful with a high ABV, makes this one a sipper. But that said, it's still fantastic."
"Drinkability is limited for me, very rich and very strong with the ABV. More than one I wouldn't probably do, but that one is awesome."
"Pours to the typical RIS appearance, dark brown/black, thick and syrupy. Small tan head, decent lacing, typical appearance. Smell is typical too, slightly sweet dark malt. But the taste sensation is where it really kicks in. Overall, it encompasses a very nice balance. Some roastiness yet not too roasty, but not to sweet either. The thing that really puts it over the top is how creamy it is. Just silk-like in its delicacy. No bitterness at all. Just a bit of hop balance at the end, but nowhere near as hoppy as I've heard. Mouthfeel excels because of this, the perfect level of coating. Super drinkable for the ABV and subject matter. Forget Rasputin, this has become my favorite of the sessionable imperial stouts!"
"This beer is definitely full-bodied and full flavored. I am tasting the dark chocolate and molasses that were only hinted at in the aroma, but I'm also getting coffee, dark fruits and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. I'm actually surprised at the lack of alcohol flavor and burn considering the ABV on this thing. I could drink plenty more of these. This beer goes down really, really well and I don't know that the wonderfully creamy smoothness could be improved on, or that anyone should even try."
"D: The one critical thing I could say about this beer is that the taste isn't amazingly distinctive or complex. If you want a knock it out of the park RIS that is super well balanced, look no further but it is not going to challenge or surprise you. Don't get me wrong, this beer is easily going to one of the top spots on my RIS list. Thanks Oscar Blues and nice to have a beer in a can for a change."
"This one gets a nod from the dessert gods. Wow. Ryhmes (check). Hip-hop slang (check). We just need some gold teeth."
"D - this has got to be the sweetest RIS ive had yet, ill drink this for a dessert."
"Pours an oily, viscous black with probably the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer- morethe color of espresso than crema. The head seems to fade a bit quicker than on the draft version. On the nose are notes of fine, vinous chocolate, a deep roastiness, and long bitterness with hints of coffee waftinf in and out. Very nice. The flavor is a knock-out. Big flavors of bitter chocolate, espresso, a massive roastiness, long complex vinous notes and a gritty cocoa powder finish. Just magnificent. Huge mouthfeel, a bit grittier than on tap- it lacks a little of the creaminess of the beer served that way, but huge, with a bitter and vinous finish that goes on for a long time. Just as delightful as the first time I had this. Wonderful stuff, and my absolute favorite beverage for a winter camping trip."
"Summary, while I can taste the quality, I just can't get as fired up as most for this carbonated chocolate syrup."
"Pours a deep black, hints of brown around the edges and initially a strong brown head that fades fast to nothing... very attractive. Smells smoky, roasted, chocolate, pungent of thick darkness. Tastes chocolaty, roasty, sweet, coffeey, full, boisterous, bold, bitter. Mouthfeel is thick as motor oil. Drinkability is great for such a huge stout!"
"Future outlook: Quite worthy of it's high ratings. I (sadly) can't get this stuff around here, but it might be worth it to find a way to snag some more of this canned gem."
"Drinkability: A wonderful sipper, too bad it doesn't make it to Ohio. I would love to age a can of this and see how beer in cans ages."
"A delicious and eminently drinkable RIS."
"oh and congrats to me for having the 666 review of this beer in the can."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best. I'm sipping and already feeling it. It isn't as overwhelming or big as others in the style so that's nice."
"Definitely a sipper, but I could have more than one in a sitting. This is a very good imperial stout, makes me want to try more Oskar Blues brews."
"Drinkability: Pretty high for a big heavy stout - I would have enjoyed an entire one to myself, but it's always better to share."
"Draught at The Big Hunt. Super dark with a brown head that leaves some oily swirls in a couple minutes. Rick chocolate mousse, coffee and hoppy aroma. Some alcoholic fruit, dark chocolate, and a good hop presence. Thick and smooth. Nice imperial stout. The components seem a bit at odds at times, but it mostly comes together quite well."
"D- This was a pretty tasty imperial stout. Not my favorite but it looks great and is very solid."
"Obviously I am in the minority here, seeing all these other reviews. But I am comparing it to other Imperial Stouts I've had, so who knows."
"but its very good for a stout, like syrup and coffee.."
"Drinkability - One of the best-drinking 10% RIPs that I've ever had, and from a can yet."
"Drinkability is good. It's almost too strongly flavored, too intense, for a higher drinkability score."
"The flavor is an improvement on the smell. Oily body of a high-alcohol beer. Black patent malt flavors with notes of cherry and strawberry. Some hoppiness is present. Overall, this is a syrupy and malty beer where the bitterness comes from the burnt grains."
"D: If you are looking for a beer, or a meal this one will do.. Not sure I could do a pack in a sitting, but a killer night cap, or cigar beer.. Undoubtedly the best beer I have ever had that came out of a can!"
"D: Pretty good, but this one fails in comparison to the truly great RIS's. It's lacking in deep complexity, but is not a bad beer by any means. Actually, quite good."
"I gave it a simi-vigorous pour into my Chimay goblet producing a nice two finger head, so close to overflowing but it didn't. Color is deep and dark and the head is a soft brown color with minimal lacing. Smell of chocolate, coffee and molasses. Tastes of nice roasted malts, molasses, alcohol and some sweetness from the malt. Low carbonation and very thick making it nice and smooth. This is a great tasting beer but the 10% makes it a sipper that i will definitely want to have a gain."
"So I'll stick with two per sitting and spout more coherent ecstasies. Great beer overall, with an A- for the mouthfeel due to the easy consistency on the palate, with the high ABV nowhere to be found in the flavors."
"D: A very good IRS. It's tasty and smooth as hell. Crazy to see this thing come out of a can."
"Wow for as many good reviews I can honestly say I am boggled. I do not think this has anything over any midwest stouts like northwind or blackout, and those arent even in the top 100. It looks awesome and has an awesome mouthfeel but is lacking in smell and taste as far as I am concerned.Just pretty standard in those areas. High drinkability but still disappointed."
"D: I really wish this beer was more readily available for me, this is an excellent imperial stout. I have yet to be disappointed by a craft beer in a can. This is one of my favorite imperial stouts."
"I was very impressed with this beer. It met every expectation that I had from things I've heard on different podcasts over the past year or so. It has just taken this long to get my hands on some. I love this beer and will sing its praises to anyone who will listen."
"D - amazing beer. best mouthfeel for any of the RISs that I've had. one to seek out and stockpile."
"had the opportunity on trying this fresh..canned on 9/25/09 and honestly the floral hops really diminish the quality of the brew..the year old can i had was top notch..i think ill age my remaining 10 cans for some time.."
"Strong malts smell but a hint of hops in there as well. Molasses, carmel and alcohol (9.5%) smack you right in the face. The burnt carmel flavor takes over from there and coats your mouth. The aftertaste lingers for quite some time. I love my stouts and this is definitely right up there with the best of them. This is extremely smooth but more than one or two in a sitting would be tough to handle."
"Pours dark black with a thick looking body. Just a very small head that quickly goes away. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Not that great looking RIS. The aroma however is very pleasing. Dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, and coffee. Has a bittersweet quality. Nice roasted malt flavor. Again it has a bittersweet quality. Hops make their presence known. Alcohol warming in the finish and it helps to cleanse the palate without dominating the flavor. Thick and rich body. Just enough carbonation to liven up the body. One of the better tasting RIS I have had."
"is next"
"Drink - Very drinkable, this is an outstanding RIS."
"The drink is smooth and soft, but leaves a bit on your tongue. I am a dark beer fan and this is DEFINITELY a fun beer. It goes down smooth but in no way would I be able to have more than two."
"Mouthfeel was almost velvety in texture and it went down smooth and not all harsh. The 10% alcohol is definately there and does not keep itself hidden. A very good beer."
"O - Thank you to whomever for finally bringing Ten FIDY to California. This is a great go-to RIS. Probably best canned beer I've ever had. Can you imagine tail gating at a baseball game with a cooler of these bad boys?!"
"Pour is the darkest of darks, color looks absolutely amazing, with minimal head that disappears after a short period of time. Smells like sweet roasted coffee with chocolate undertones. Taste is amazing: wonderful chocolate and coffee taste, with sweet dark fruit back there as well. Perhaps the richest beer I've ever tried. The mouthfeel is the best part of this drink. It is a silky smooth, and a tremendous treat going down. While I had no problem sipping what I opened and completing it, I could not see myself having more than one of these in an evening: each can is pretty much a dessert, and much like a sundae, consuming multiple would be overkill."
"D: This is definitely a sipper. I had a warmed chocolate chip cookie and mocha java ice cream to pair. I look forward to trying more from Oskar Blues."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Alcohol is well masked on this one."
"Pours black hole black. Very thin dark brown head. Smells like alcohol and sweet fruity burnt coffee. The initial taste is of sweet alcohol mixed with a candylike fruity hop flavor. Very sweet and candylike, almost too sweet. Then comes an extremely strong burnt coffee flavor that lingers along with alcohol and bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a very strong beer. Definitely a sipper. It burned all the way down and I think it is burning a hole in my stomach right now. A heavier mouthfeel to this one. As the beer warmed up, the fruity hop flavor became more apparent and the burnt coffee flavor died down a little."
"A very nice Stout which I would recommend"
"I poured from a 12 ounce can into a standard pint glass. It pours pitch black with a 1 finger tan head. A bit of tan lacing is left. The aroma is coffee and chocolate. The flavor is pleasantly bitter and has notes of coffee and chocalate, with the faintest hint of sweetness. The beer is full bodied, adequete carbonation and has a pleasing creamy mouth feel. The brew is meant to be sipped. A solid RIS, but a bit overhyped."
"Observables: very dark black oily pour, maybe the thickest beer I've ever seen, GIBCS is close. The defining characteristic of the beer to me is the sweetness, which limits it's drinkability. It leaves a coating on the glass and your mouth, and has a looong after-taste. There is no balance at all and its the most syrupy/sugary beer I've ever had."
"Best beer I ever had so far that came from a can. I dont think I could have more then one of these though."
"This is a drinkable RIS. However, it's a little more bitter than I like."
"Pours a pitch black with a creamy, tan head. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass all the way through. Smells of honey and toasted bread. Taste is richly malty, with a smooth roasted bitterness in the middle. The finish is lightly bitter, with a hint of earthy hops. The finish is also slightly metallic likely from the high alcohol levels. Mouthfeel is smooth, very rich, with nice carbonation levels. Drinkability is pretty good, being 10 percent abv makes it tough to drink more than one can at a time. Not my favorite RIS, but a very good beer, and definitely worth a shot for lovers of the style."
"D-Damn nice Impy that ranks on the top tier...I like a couple others better than this but that is no knock on this beer because there are really some kick ass impy's being made these days...A must try if you like this style.."
"I need to find and keep a little stockpile of this to have around!"
"D: 10% ABV is not at all hidden. Definitely a sipping beer -- which is fine, but I'm not sure I'd want to sip an entire can of this rather one sided brew, much less another."
"Drinkability: This is not as sweet as other RISs. It is a complex sipping beer. One of my favorites in the style, but not quite there...A very very good beer."
"I was sure this was going to be a slam dunk after pouring and smelling. The taste, although not bad, was simply average. Nicest mouth feel I can remember. I have two more cans of this so I'll try again another day."
"This is an amazing Russian Imperial Stout. Not really a whole lot else to say. I'm almost ashamed of myself for not buying some sooner."
"D: The best beer to come from a can? I'd say so...for what that's worth."
"This would be in the running for my regular RIS if it was available in Ohio."
"Overall this beer is definitely deserving of its status. It could use some improvement to really make my palate happy, but I was pleased."
"Thick, mildly viscous and very full body. Minimal carbonation. Good drinkability."
"Brought to by the masters of good canned beer, the Ten Fiddy Stout holds up excellently in spite of any initial reservations. A thick, smooth black pour and near to no head/lace sat like dark oil. The aroma was thick, with a bit noticeable alcohol that blocked the other wet, burnt wood & burnt malt aromas. The flavor was akin to the aroma, with additional plum-raisin elements and a near-liquor quality that brought on a nice chest warmth. A bit flat & heavy on the alcohol, but otherwise a good sipper."
"I'm very, very impressed. This may be my favorite RIS. Now, that's not saying a whole lot, since it's just not my style, but this guy is really pretty damned good. The balance is what does it. Some nice chocolate and fruit, without all the burnt bitterness or coffee notes that usually turn me off. Oskar Blues makes the best beers in a can, bar-none."
"Can't give it a perfect for drinkability because one was enough, but it was nicely drinkable for what it was: a big, over the top bomb of aroma and flavor that was a joy to imbibe."
"Verdict: Ten Fidy is an experience, to say the least, and the best Russian Imperial I've tried yet. A massive body with a brilliant malt profile and a nice flourish of hops. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts whatsoever and can find this in your area, buy it. If you can't find it in your area, move."
"D: Hugely intense on all levels. One is about all that I can take, but I'll be looking forward to finishing the 4-pack later this week."
"D: A very interesting Imperial Stout, up there with some of the best of the style. It doesn't quite climb that very final step, with beers like The Abyss out there."
"Finally got ahold of this beer on a trip to Sconny. The beer pours with the look of used motor oil with a thick tan head that disolves rather quickly. Carbonation is subtile. The nose is boozy at first, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Wow! The instant this brew hits the tongue, Coffee, chocolate, and vanilla notes overwhelm all else. It finishes dry with a nice hop bite. Creamy and thick, Ten Fidy is a full-bodied sipper. Very drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. It's definitely made my top ten Imperial Stouts list."
"Even gave a taste to my Dog Archie. He wanted more."
"Very drinkable for the style."
"Terrific drinkability, slow and sweet. Sip this puppy, and enjoy!!!"
"D - This is a good beer. It could probably use some hops to tame the sweetness."
"D: I bought a 4-pack, sweet."
"Very thick pour, completely opaque, very small head, but it's the darkest foam I may have ever seen. Smell is fantastic! Lots of sweet roastiness, some chocolate and light coffee with some brown sugar and burnt caramel in the background. This beer completely loaded with chocolate milkshake flavor, it's pretty sweet, with a very nice roastiness, some light bitterness in the background, and just a touch of roasted coffee beans. Flavor just coats the mouth, one of the thickest stouts I've had and is up there with some of my favorites. Alcohol is barely noticeable and I find myself drinking this one a little fast because it tastes and feels so good! A+ indeed."
"Thanks again Keith...Fantastic."
"An excellent stout, but I was expecting something earth shattering given my previous experiences with Oskar Blues. Still, this is definitely one I would buy again."
"Ten fidy is extraordinary. The blackest of black with a dense brown head that smells like a smore that was hit with a blowtorch. Appearance smell-wise it is not very different from other RISs, but its taste sets it ahead of its kin. Very rich chocolately and coffee flavors, both of which have sweet AND bitter expressions coming through depending on whether its on the front of your palate, swished around, or the lingering swallow. Its body is dense but has a luxurious, velveteen texture. The first sip literally gave me goosebumps. This beer has ""quality"" written all over it. Props to Oskar Blues for shunning microbrew conventions by putting such a grand masterpiece in a can."
"Overall: Wonderful stout that is one of the most drinkable I've had. Very good flavor and smell. If you're able to get one of the bad boys expect a great overall RIS"
"D- One of my favorite brews to date! I would love to pick up more and sit a few down although its great right now."
"D - One of the best RISs on the market, IMO. This was amazing on nitro. Ten Fidy drinks supurbly for a 10% beer. Yum!"
"Drinkability: A very good Imperial Stout. Glad I sought this one out. I like it, but there's something about it I can't place that bothers me. I'd probably have it again. This one did go down dangerously quickly."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for the ABV, but this isn't the most interesting or delicious RIS out there. Quite possibly the best beer I've had out of a can, though."
"This is the blackest of the black. I get a very dark head, a true medium brown with some off white. ITs a thick head but quickly shrinks to a half finger size. Lacing is lasting and everywhere on my glass. I'm a swirler! Aroma is tremendous, earth, malt, dark chocolate, strong alcohol, tree bark, and blackened char from the grille. This is a very complex brew. I can see how this one can be someone's favorite stout, it has a unique taste to it. There is some syrupy feel but it is not sweet overall, or is it?. Sweet and bitter battle it out and I feel differently with each sip. There is a definite smokiness to this one. There is a nice chewy roasted characteristic to this one. The aftertaste is a bit harsh and the alcohol is quite prominent. I will revisit this one from time to time one at a time. Drinkability is very low for me. I'm impressed with this, and I want to like it more than I do. Overall, many other stouts are ahead on my list, but I see the allure for sure."
"Delicious! On par with Old Rasputin and Brooklyn BCS. I couldn't say which of the three I like best."
"Flavor is roasted malt and molasses and some brown sugar mixed with chocolate. Big hearty flavor and texture. The booze is fairly subdued due to the rich flavors that meld perfectly in this beer. No real hop presence either. This is one beer I will buy again for sure."
"Pretty drinkable for an imperial stout. Sometimes they're so thick and heavy they're hard to get through, but this is pretty nice."
"D: This beer has a lot going on. The bitter aftertaste makes it a little bit of a pallet killer in my opinion, however very complex and enjoyable."
"D - For a ten percenter, this beer is all about the smooth. I don't know what else to say other than -- this beer simply rocks, and I wish I had it in the running when I did my last RIS blind tasting."
"Finally a beer that puts a can to good use!"
"Now this is a beer from a can worth buying. And a very big beer at that!"
"I saw this today for 5.99 for a four pack so I figure I would pick it up since I have already had the bourbon aged. Pours like jet black motor oil with a nice brown head and decent lacing. Slight bitter chocolate aroma with roasted malts, coffee and some espresso. One thing I noticed right off the bat is that the roasted malts do not take over the whole beer which is nice. The bitter dark chocolate taste is their as well as the coffee but I do detect some hop bitterness underneath the coffee. I not the biggest fan of RIS but this is a rather nice and dangerously easy to drink."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is coating and creamy. The body of the beer is full. The finish on the beer is medium full with slight bitterness. This beer is well round and very well made. It is one of the better RIS that I have tried. I am really surprised that this came out of a can. I like the full body of the beer with complex flavors. I would have like to seen the hops play more of a role in this brew, nonetheless, it was good and easy to drink."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Dan"
"Ten FIDY finally showed up in Hudson so I had to give it a try. It did not disappoint, a big stout nicely balanced between roast, sweetness, and bitterness. Good stuff."
"proves that can beer is not strictly a macrobrew container"
"Mouthfeel is full, thick, and rich but then kept in balance by the hoppiness. Over all a very ""clean"" extremely flavorful stout I will make a regular."
"As with many beers that are a bit intense at first, this one gets better as I get deeper into it. Is my palate adjusting? Is the alcohol making me more forgiving as it kicks in? Probably some of each. Either way, over time, I've upgraded the mouthfeel from a 3.5 to a 4 and the drinkability from a 4 to a 4.5, so if you actually care about my opinion and are experiencing similar sensations, be patient. This is a very well executed, approachable example of the Russian Imperial Stout."
"Later"
"Pitch black body. Thin creamy brown head. Lace is sporadic. Bubbly islands of brown cream form on the surface as I drink. The aroma is pretty thick, oily and greasy, and roasty. Also notice some hints of black licorice and dark currants. Oh, as I first taste this, I realize this thing's got some viscosity. This is some viscous shit. In a good way. I like it. Imp. stouts should have a very full and viscous body and mouthfeel. Carbonation is appropriately low. and the alcohol doesn't really surface much. I think it's hidden behind some of the bold flavors of this beer. I really like the flavors of anise and licorice and currants in this beer. It's got some of the requisite char and roasted malt bitterness. But the beauty is really in the dark fruitiness. Best imperial stout I've ever had from a can."
"D: Definitely a meal in a can. I'm glad I finally tried this."
"By far the best of the Oskar Blues I've tried so far."
"Hoppy and roasty makes this stand out from some other RIS's. A very nice RIS. I can think of a couple others that are better at a better price point as well. Very good beer and it comes in a can."
"Mouthfeel, as expected is thick and creamy. Impy stouts don't tend to be crinkable, but this one is good. I'm taking my time because I'm enjoying, not because it's a chore."
"This is a standout beer. Thanks Brad!"
"An incredible imperial stout, worthy of being ranked up there with the best. I'm not sure if the can imparts any particular characteristics that serve to make this such an amazing brew; it would be nice to be able to sample a bottled or draft version so as to make a comparison. The can isn't hurting anything, though, and if anything it adds to the allure of this blacker-than-night beer."
"Drinkability- A strong beer that pours very nicely out of the can and a not over whelming of alcohol beer considering how strong, a good well balanced stout worth checking out and getting again if you can get hold of these hard to find gems"
"Drinkability is great and I will buy 4 packs of this for as long as I can."
"This is an amazingly enjoyable beer. Recommended if you're a Russian Imperial Stout fan!"
"Even thought I cringe when I hear some wangster pronounce fifty as ""fidy", I thoroughly enjoyed this stout, and will thoroughly enjoy the other three, so long as the woman in it remains clean."
"Thanks kiefdog for the share. I can't believe that a world class beer comes out of a can. Dad gum it Osker Blues! It pours motor oil black with a dark brown head. Nose is roasted malt, alcohol burn, coffee, some coffee, slight licorice flavor, and dark fruit. A ton of yellow lace lines the glass when you swirl. Flavor is velvety smooth- very light on carbonation- with lots of ripe dark fruit, sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee bitterness. Starts sweet, and finishes with coffee bitterness. Slight bourbony alcohol flavor throughout. Thoroughly enjoyable beer! If it spilled I would lick it off of almost any floor."
"Probably the first canned beer I've enjoyed."
"M/D: this is a very smooth delicious IRS its thicker and more potent than a lot of supposed stouts, but isn't overwhelming so very good."
"Pours out a pitch black with huge brown head that laces well. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coffe, and a sweetness makes this stout very inviting. The taste is huge, yet fairly well balanced. Big roasted malts, almost a barley wine type taste in there nice hops help round out the huge malt backbone on this one. Molasses, coffee, chocolate, burnt bitterness, well crafted brew here. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel with nice light carbonation makes this extremely drinkable. One of my favorite RIS, must have again and again."
"D: It's a 10% beer, how drinkable can it be? Actually, it's pretty drinkable for it's type."
"D: If I didn't know this was a 10%er I would find it really easy to drink a couple of these. Well done Oskar Blues!"
"On tap. Dark black with a brown head. Lookin good. Really not that much inthe nose. Roasty. Sweet, caramel. Sweeet flavor, almost cloyingly syrupy. Tasty though. Slick mouthfeel. Smooth amd lush. Overall decent, strong. I feel overated; other neers of the style are much more drinkable."
"Ten FIDY is a pitch black ale with a dense, caramel brown head that has excellent retention and really makes a mess of the glass. It has a resiny, roasty, chocolate-licorice aroma. It smells a touch sweet like molasses. It is heavy and smooth. The finish is clean and very dry. It tastes very roasted, like medium roast coffee, but it doesn't get too astringent. Once again, there are notes of chocolate and licorice. It is well balanced and action packed. The aftertaste is like sweet resin. It's a formidable beer."
"A delicious meal in a can."
"A very drinkable brew and a knockout for a canned stout."
"D - It's just huge on flavor and feel. I can't imagine drinking more than one, but a lot of RISs are that way for me, so it fits my idea of the style. It would almost feel like stealing to get this at less than $3 for a single can(granted, I'd be more than happy to oblige), so it was worth it. I'm giving it a 4 because while I wouldn't drink more than one, it's certainly one of the best RISs I've had."
"Pours like motor oil, to use a style-cliche, thick and black. Forced pour encourages a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Solid retention on a tip of the glass. Nose is filled with dark, rich roasted malt, followed by a strong smokeyness. Love this aroma. Palate is surprisingly light on the front end and the sweetness of the malt comes through closer to the finish. Great roasted malt, but a bit light in the front of the palate, and a bit one-note. Mayeb a tocuh too sweet, could use some more hop character to cut it. A tingling effervescence is somewhat troubling. It isn't a strong carbonation, but fairly persistent. I'd prefer a touch less. Still very creamy and silky. Alcohol is well hidden behind the roasty malt goodness. A very good rendition of an imperial stout, and certainly the best I've had out of a can, but not in the upper echelon of the style in this reviewer's opinion."
"This is a big ass imperial stout. Very happy with the 12oz serving size. Although I could handle a couple of these in a sitting. Nice desert beer. Or pre dinner beer. Or with dinner beer. Very happy with this one. WIll be seeking out again."
"D: I love the fact that this comes in a can. It looks cool and it drinks damn finely. I had heard alot about this one and it lived up to the hype. Highly recommended for drinkers, tokers, trippers, procrastinators, hallucinators, and the like..."
"Drinkability was perfect, nice balance of great malt taste and 98 IBUs. The 9% ABV was revealed at all the right moments. Savored every sip and going back to the store to get more!"
"Note to self: Ranked #74/100 Top Beers on Planet Earth when I tried it"
"Sweet Jesus, this is one hell of a thick pouring brew. My wife even took notice while I was pouring it. Just dense opaque black with some brown head. The aroma has a rich chocolaty, rocky road, fudge ripple, marshmallow fluff thing going on that is pretty irresistible. Hell, if you take the time to find them, there are some hops in this bear. Coffee and char are the major flavor components. Oh, don't even trip. All of the character of the aroma are there in one way or another. Theres a strong bitter finish. Thick and rich on the palate. Ten FIDY is sooo insanly easy to drink, its criminal."
"40/50"
"D= Very very high too good for my own good."
"Alcohol slightly bears its head on the finish, but overall it's extremely (and dangerously) well-hidden. Carbonation is low, but it's so creamy and rich it doesn't detract at all. Perfectly well balanced with a great bitter coffee-like finish and aftertaste. Top notch RIS."
"The best value in the catagory as far as i am concerned!!!"
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink for such as big, dark beer."
"russian imperial stout in a can! obviously you have to love that. jet black with minor head... chocolate and alcohol on nose, black patent malt and creamy chocolate in taste. rich, heavy, yet drinkable. i'll definitely be bringing a six-pack of ten FIDY with me next camping trip..."
"This beer is massively dark and murky. It pours inky black, with a thin, caramel colored head. The brew smells like brown sugar, caramel, and a hint of maple syrup. It tastes very malty, like a boozy malted milkshake, thick and creamy and chocolatey with a bit of bitter aftertaste. Most Russian Imperial Stouts like this one are quite strong, and while Ten FIDY does come in at about 10% alcohol, it's not quite as intense as I expected -- it's quite drinkable and perfect for a cold winter night."
"This one pours like motor oil--dark dark brown, almost black, with a very slight tan head. Smells mildly of chocolate and coffee. Tastes moderately of dark chocolate, coffee, malt, caramel. The flavors are well-blended, but they are on the mild side for an imperial stout. Mouthfeel is a bit watery for an imperial stout, but carbonation is about right. Overall, a good imperial stout which I'll drink again, but they could have ramped it up a notch."
"Note: The metallic aftertaste others refer to is present only upon first opening - it seems to ""blow off"" as it warms."
"Overall: For a RIS this is pretty easy to drink. The alcohol is there but not overwhelming. I would say this is a pretty good RIS, nothing too special but definitely worth trying at some point."
"Pours an oily black in color, hardly any light gets through this one. A small tan head rests a top. Big nose, lots of roasty malts and whiffs of alcohol. Big sweet burnt malts invade initially, fruity mid palate with a bright hop character on the finish leading into a drying alcohol wave. Good weight to its body, low carbonation makes it feel 'bigger' than it really should i think, very good drinkability nonetheless. Im not quite sure this one lives up to the hype behind it but Ten Fidy is reasonable in price and definitely worth trying."
"There is a big chocolate presence, espresso hints, small note of smoked flavors in the first sips. Hops are present, but very mild - however gives a nice blend of bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, medium to full, but not sticky. Drinkability is good. I highly enjoyed this."
"After many recommendations about Ten Fidy I am stoked I bought one. This one took me my storm...definitely a wonderful beer in the Imperial Stout category from my experiences."
"It's a tasty imperial stout...from a can. And you can bring it beaches that allow alcohol. Not too expensive for an out-of-state RIS, $8.99 for a four pack of 12 ounce cans."
"D: This is a drinkable, well made and easy to drink beer."
"Poured from its can absolutely jet black and incredibly thick. Nice. No head to speak of. Smell is big baker's chocolate with maybe a pinch of coffee and little else. Taste is dominated by dark malts with some nice hop bitterness showing up at the end. Very heavy, almost oily in the mouth. The 10%abv is very well concealed, too. A very, very solid stout."
"9.5% ABV (that's what it says on the can) is superbly well-hidden, lending only the most minor sensation of alcohol warmth. Makes it dangerously drinkable. I'll hunt this down again and see what happens. This hit the spot and has plenty to recommend it."
"One of the best commonly available RISs out there. Not complex enough to be among the upper echelon, but still very, very tasty."
"I still can't believe it comes in a can. This is an very good beer to enjoy and savor. It will leave you satisfied if you like good stouts."
"Initial review on 2/5/09. After a few more RISs under my belt I revisited it. The above is the newer review. It's fairly similar though I reduced the scores a bit, I was a bit starry eyed with this brew since it was one of my first RISs."
"Perfect desert beer!"
"With all the hype, I was expecting a knock out with a smooth feel that would hide the alcohol under the stoutiness. I was wrong. I am not saying this was bad at all, just didn't live up to the BA hype put on it. I will buy more next time it comes around. It's a beer that I'll drink if I want beer and it's too late to make a session. Dark..couldn't see through it. Roasted choc and coffee malts with lingering alcohol taste...the only bummer. Would and do recommend for special occasions for cans."
"to enjoy with the game."
"4.0 D: Damn good. Best RIS I've had thus far. Also BY FAR the best beer I've had from a can (I've also had Old Chub)."
"Overall impression: A big, hoppy, American slant on an RIS. I would have this in my regular rotation if it were available. The hops and alcohol would make this something I'd only have once in a session but this is a full flavored palate pleaser."
"D - Not by any means a session beer (10 ABV), but I end up buying a 4 pack every time I pick it up because one isn't enough. Do yourself a favor and spread these out and savor them. You'll enjoy it more and not fall down enjoying one too many. Great beer for the price and ABV."
"Poured black, very opaque with ruby around the top edge. Just about zero head, just a few brown bubbles. Roasted malt, roasty coffee, chocolate and port aromas, excellent. Real nice full body, forms a film on the sides of the glass as I tilt it. Roasty malt, coffee and bakers chocolate flavors, the smell doesn't lie. Finish clean with some lingering cafe mocha. Drinkable, with the alcohol non-existant. A big beer with a nice balance of malt and hops. The only thing I would say could improve this would be slightly more carbonation, which could make it more creamy than oily. Still deserving of the good reviews. In the top 10 non-barrel aged Imperial Stouts."
"The body is massive and thick. Viscous even. Uber creamy and slick on the palate. Chewy and dense. Drinkability is good for a beer this powerful because I want more! Impressive beer in a can."
"Notes - I've had a couple cans of this from the CBE and having it on tap really adds a lot of depth and at least some perceived freshness to the taste."
"Guess I'll just have to finish this one and wonder..."
"Best beer from a can i've ever had."
"Poured from 12oz can courtesy of kiefdog. Pours motor oil black with a finger of creamy mocha colored head. Smell is sweet like hersheys chocolate. Taste is a little bitter up front like drinking straight chocolate syrup followed by coffee undertones. Very thick beer, possibly the thickest I've ever had. Covers up the alcohol very well. I don't think I could drink more than one or two of these because of the thickness but it's flavor is so good I'd love to try. I didn't know what to expect with this beer but every drink is better than the last. I look forward to getting my hands on more of this."
"D: The drinkability is exceptional for its ABV and IBUs. Warming is important to avoid the metallic aftertaste, but with patience, this is a complex, full-flavored RIS. I like Bell's Expedition Stout better, but Ten Fidy is still a great stout."
"Good craft beer in a can, thank you Oskar Blues! This review is after my first Ten Fidy. I have been hearing good things about this brew and has been told that I must get into it soon. Love the can concept and was very excited to see a pitch black motor oil come pouring out to leave a nice head that only stuck around for a bit. I should have known from the dark as night look that I was in for a sensational ride. A slightly bitter, great hoppiness, smooth & creamy sip was one I dragged out as long as I could. The beer got better as it warmed up a bit and the last sip was greatly missed. Slight alcohol grab at the finish which lets you know that it is not just dark chocolate and caramel that lace this brew. Can't wait to get my hands on another soon."
"Thick and black, a good thick head forms, but then it is gone. nose is coffee and chocolate with figs and raisins. some tobacco too. taste is outstanding. coffee chocolate, a bit of a smokiness. real rich and damn good. hops fade to the back and hit just at the finish to balance out the sweetness a bit. mouthfeel is perfection. its like a milkshake. alcohol is really well hidden. i was surprised to find that it is 10%."
"D - Share one of these with your friends when they graduate from something."
"The Ten FIDY finishes rather smoky and carbonated. The smokiness is reminiscent of the Stone Smoked Porter, however, with less single-flavor dominance."
"Creamy and exceptionally smooth, a thick beer that coats the palate nicely. My apologies for ever saying that good beer can't possibly come from a can...clearly there are exceptions. I never would have imagined this would have been so good but I am pleasantly surprised. An amazing RIS and one that you would be an absolute idiot not to try if you had the opportunity."
"Pours a jet black color with a creamy brown head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is of a nice roasted malt and chocolate, some rust, hops and booze. A velvety smooth chocolate flavor, perhaps chocolate liquor, mixed with roasted malt, a viscous old ale sweetness, and rust. Very bold flavors. The feel is very smooth and chewy, big malty sweetness and a noticable alcohol kick. A very tasty stout, a bit boozy but good for a cold night."
"Mouthfeel is a little gritty, and the alcohol is very dominant. A little overwhelming, but that is what I was wanting."
"Great beer!!!"
"While I prefer the more hop-forward character of Old Rasputin, Ten FIDY holds its own very well. This is a very good example of the style, and the best beer I've tasted from Oskar Blues."
"I would drink 2, 3 or 4 of these easily. The caramel character in the flavor is amazing. I liked it as did my wife. My wife is a beer review enabler if I position it just right and this review saw some benefit of a dual input system. Cheers to Ten Fiddy fans and my wife! This is my first 4.5 across the board review. All so good but just couldn't give it a perfect 5 on any level."
"As so many have said, this is a great drinking RIS. If you like big tasting stouts you'll enjoy this."
"Wow this one pours like liquid night. Black with a dark creamy head. Smells like coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes is similar to the smell. Dry roasted flavor with some bitterness that is well balanced. This one is a sipper and a very good one. High abv makes it only a couple at a sitting."
" The taste sits on the back of your tongue and waits for your to catch up...but when you do, you're glad you took the trip. Moments after you finish your swallow, you will notice the sweet reminents familiar to a nice square of chocolate."
"Brew pored thick, very thick coming out of the can into the glass. Color is pitch black, head is quite small with a dark tan head that has some retention. The smallish tan head leaves a nice amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is rich, black/burnt malts, chocolate, coffee, licorice all come to mind with a warming and welcoming alcohol scent. The first sip shows off an astringency that is a little bit of a surprise as the aroma did not prepare me for it, it is good though! The feel is thick, slightly syrupy but does have a slick property till the end then the astringency really comes to the forefront as a charcoal feel. Flavors of burnt malt, coffee up in front of the chocolate flavors, some fruit. As it warms here alcohol seems to come out, but it mixes nicely with everything. While drinking this brew I am unaware of the alcohol% but feel it must be up there a bit, but with that being said it drinks quite well for a big beer. Very good showing for the style and overall an excellent brew."
"Overall- This is a pretty good imperial stout. Maybe a little rough around the edges but it is still pretty good. Though it comes in a cute 12 oz can this one will take some time to drink."
"Great RIS. Very drinkable for the style and ABV."
"Not so drinkable at 10%, but amazingly smooth."
"Honestly, first time I have ever had this one. One of the best Imperial Stouts I have come across....get it if you can."
"D, notes: Ten Fidy is another beer that helps cement Oskar Blues as one of the standout breweries in the United States."
"Drinkability: Its decent, but nothing special."
"Drinkability - In lieu of dinner, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Fine example of an Imperial Stout...and out of a can, no less."
"Overall, very impressed with the RIS out of a can. The real stand out for me was the mouthfeel. I can't remember having many RIS that had something as close as what this beer had to offer. Just a solid RIS."
"Not my favorite RIS - but nonetheless very tasty. Well constructed, and I like the fact it's on the bitter side of the equation."
"Mouthfeel is heavy. Lower carbonation only lends to it. Viscous body and well masked alcohol makes this one of the more drinkable RIS."
"One to keep coming back to. My motor oil of choice this 10% social lubricant will keep me runnin for 5000 miles for sure."
"My first taste of what Oskar Blues has to offer, and I'm impressed. One of the better RIS's i've had."
"Wow. I thought I'd found all I could ever find in a stout or a porter until I tried this one. When I see it coming out of the tap it reminds me of The Beverly Hillbillies - ""Black gold, Texas tea. Well the next thing you know old Jed's a millionaire"". This stuff is black, black, black!!! Very dark brown head that subsides quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. It shouts ROASTED MALT at you from ten feet away. It's like drinking an old ash tray, but in a good way. Somewhat sweet. Almost no carbonation. It really is like motor oil. Liquid engineering. I couldn't drink more than one of these in a session, but that's the way it should be. You don't drink port all night, you finish off the evening with it."
"Overall impression: The crazy mouthfeel alone makes this an easy recommendation."
"ok..used motor oil, thats what this is... any car person knows whats up... It's Sunday, fuckin sunday, your one day off a week and you fuckin deserve it. You work hard and you play hard, not only that you motherfucking drink hard too... Ten Fidy is the choice tonight... your crest on your chest, the dark black stuff is smooth, maybe too much so... I want to see this beer in the mainstream... on racing cars in the strets of milan, david beckham shotgunning tins on the corner, the pope doing cartwheels in a Farrelly brother movie starring brad pitt ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GplLqg-EwoI ) and the olson twins in heat.. . this beer is good..there.. dark as the night, tasty as hell, great aftertaste and such.. buy it ..worms..I got worms! We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms...thank you oskar blues.. great brews all around..axiom-carpe noctem... Come on United!!.."
"An excellent RIS...a must-have experience."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Ten TIDY is a great beer, especially for the price. Don't let the can fool you - this RIS competes with the best of them. Well rounded characteristics make this a beer worth keeping on hand."
"D: I've got to enjoy Ten Fidy a couple times before but just scored a 4 pack from bhalter8 (thanks again Ben!) and thought I should review it. I wish I could get this stuff around here. I love that it comes in a can and I just love this beer!"
"D- good beer balanced but leaves me feeling more like I had an IPA then a stout, good balance 10%ABV is hard to taste but would definitely catch up to you."
"Drinkability is good as I would have this again, and it's novel to have a high quality brew in a can, however for your Russian imperial stouts, I may shop around a bit."
" How in world do they get this level of deliciousness into a can on a consistent basis? I have had Dale's and Old Chub before, and now this. I am truly blown away by OBB. Thank you for letting me enjoy more than a hockey game on a cold Tuesday night."
"I'm just glad that smell doesn't factor in that highly when compared with the overall score because this beer has a lot more to offer than looks. The aroma sort of reminds me of a dopplebock mixed with an imperial stout, the maltiness is that pronoucned. The alcohol is well hidden at 10% really only comes through in a mild warmth toward the middle and end of each sip. Meanwhile the intense roastiness, balanced by an epic malt sweetness make this an intensly quaffable brew. Glad I have more than one, but sadly only one left."
"Overall -This is a was a very complex and strong Stout. Its a sipper through and through. The flavors are almost to much, and it seems that time would be in its favor. But nothing is overpowering. Very Good Russian Imperial Stout."
"This was one of the slowest beers I have ever drank. A nightcap indeed. The 10% abv is big and omnipresent throughout this experience."
"The taste is smoky (almost a Rauchbier quality), mild hop, and a little licorice."
"Note: Check out your glass after you take a sip. This brew turns the side of the glass brown for a minute. Talk about thick. If there was such a term to describe it, I would borrow one from wine-lingo: legs."
"Finally got a chance to try this beer and it does not dissappoint. Pours with a gorgeous head so dark creamy and luxurious it is had to distinguish from the black oily body. Smell is dark chocolate with some coffee notes and this is echoed in the taste. No bitterness nor soy sauce offness detected at all. The body is pure Oskar Blues goodness - crushed black velvet in a glass. The alcohol becomes more than appearant as it warms, but this is a 10% impy stout - that is to be expected. An oily film is left in the glass as a testimony to the power contained within. All I was hoping for and more. A contender with Speedway Stout for the best Imperial Stout I have ever tried. Simply amazing"
"Oksar Blues continues to impress me with their beers. This is now their fourth beer I've sampled from a can, and every one of them has been excellent. Strong stout lovers should seek this out."
"An odd note on this one, to finish my review. On my third sip, I caught a bit of this thick, gooey, dark black sludge right on my lower lip but it squirted out onto my shirt. What the hell? This was like some slimey black snot that must have come out of the dredges of the can. Honestly, for about a quarter of the beer, this weired me out, and I even thought about pouring the rest through a seive to make sure it was the last bit of it, but after a while I just forgot about it and just carried on. Looking back, pretty funnny, especially the nice spot on my shirt..."
"Pours a deep, opaque sable with minimal, fine-bubbled tan head. Rich, mocha-like aroma is just a bit sweet and a little smoky, and very appetizing. Superb coffee and chocolate flavor is mouth-filling and delicious, smoky and lively. Texture is thick and tingly so it satisfies on the way down the pipes."
"Pours ink black, with a bit of a satin sheen. The head is dense and dark brown. Great lacing and retention. This looks just perfect. Smells like sweet chocolate and alcohol. Good smells for an RIS, nothing outstanding or out of the ordinary. Oftentimes a good thing. The taste is great. The first taste is a bit harsh, but then the sweetness comes forward. You get the bitter roasted barley taste, the sweet chocolate taste, and a kick of alcohol. Again, there aren't really many out of the ordinary tastes, like licorice or fruit, at least not in the obvious places. You can find them if you search. The flavor is really well executed for the style, and the alcohol and any harsh flavors it may carry along are held in check. Really great complexity. I would never call this one-dimensional, but it doesn't try too hard or get muddled. I could really sit and savor this beer, but I just want to go back for more. I feel lucky to have another can, and can't wait for it to finally hit the shelves in Charleston full-time."
"Black color with a brown head that retains well and has excellent lacing. Smell has plenty of molasses and hops. Quite roasty in the nose as well. Taste starts out burnt and a little ashy, some molasses comes through, and then a hoppy, roasty finish. Light carbonation and medium body. Good beer, I'd like to see how this one ages. I could see myself getting more of this."
"Overall a great selection for the start of a Christmas evening. Drink it slow, and it opens up in some style as it warms."
"Ten fidy does a nice job of masking the alcohol while keeping true to the IBU's of an imperial stout , while also providing a rich flavor to balance it all out. Would buy again , especially in the winter. I love this beer"
"I'm going to start looking for Oskar Blues other brews quickly...."
"I'm glad I finally got to try this great imperial stout."
"This is one of my favorite RISs."
"This is one heck of a complex beer. This may go down as my favorite Russian Imperial Stout to date."
"Maybe it's been awhile since I had a RIS, but this seems a bit sweeter than most. Still a good beer, and a great dessert beer."
"Opinion: As I mentioned above, this beer is quite bold. It has a whole lot of flavor and big alcohol, so this one is hard to miss. This can isn't all that carbonated, so it would be good to try this beer on tap when properly served. So far, it is a pretty good beer, but it could definitely use some more carbonation to soften the overall presentation. Either way, a good beer, and I would drink it again."
"D&Notes: I think this is the biggest beer I have ever polished off one pint of. Indeed, this one awesome brew, meant to be consumed very slowly, with small, thoughtful sips (I took one hour to finish the pint). Obviously, at 10%ABV, one of these is plenty, but this beer is by no means just another big beer to try to satisfy beer geeks. Yes, it's a huge beer in every aspect, but it is superbly balanced, especially when taking its ABV into consideration, and as warming as can be. That said, a word of caution, as this brew definitely sneaks up on you in a hurry!"
"If you want a pretty good example of a Russian Imperial Stout this would fit perfect"
"Whiffs of dark fruit (cranberry, pomegranate, cranberry), fresh baked sugar cookie (no vanilla), baker's chocolate, and roasted coffee. Taste brings flavors of cooking caramel, chocolate dipped cranberry biscotti, and cocoa cappuccino dusted cordials. Leaves with medium dry finish and tiny lingering of hops."
"Pours pitch black with very nice looking brown head. Smell - cocoa, chocolate malts, toasted sugar. Taste - alcohol stands up, then chocolate and caramel. Agressive, but still pretty interesting sipper. Rich and smooth. As for drinkability, I'd say it's not very drinkable. 1 can is more than enough for me, but I enojoyed it."
"1 or 2 would be the max for me."
"d- yeah,,,really not bad. typically high alc. make drinkability a negative for me. this one as said is balanced but this beer is just so much that i don't see drinking more than one."
"Notes: A very solid RIS, for sure. Very tasty and easy drinking for a high ABV beer. But, the best part of this beer, in my opinion, is the mouthfeel. It feels so damn good that you just can't wait to treat your tongue to some more! Sorry Old Rasputin, but you've just been replaced as the RIS that will be regularly stocked in my fridge. Highly recommended!"
"Tap @ Pizza Port SB. Pours midnight black with a 1 cm cap of tiny brown cascading bubbles. Lovely rich aroma of coffee, baker's chocolate, brownies, and tobacco. Earthy. Full, velvety mouthfeel. Taste is unbelievably good. Loads of dark and milk chocolate blended perfectly with strong, black coffee. Its tempered by the sweeter caramel malt and roasted oats. Its like eating a rich chocolate cake, while having a strong coffee and finishing it with a nice single-malt. I'm in love with this beer. If they don't get cans of it in San Diego soon, there may be civil unrest."
"An incredible beer. I wish I had better access to this in Iowa. Hard to imagine that little restaurant in Lyons can make such good beer."
"Amazing feeling to this brew. It is thick and smooth with a subdued carbonation that really lets the darker flavors shine and doesn't strip the taste off your tongue. The aftertaste of this beer is all that I love in beer. It is better then the actual flavor of the liquid and its due to the viscus nature of this one. It sticks to your palate and coats with a lasting flavor that really redeems the beer."
"D - once Ten Fidy warmed a bit it became quite delicious. Although I gave it a 4 for drinkability, it is hard to have more than a couple if you want to stay sober. One of the better RIS's I have tried. At first the flavors were too tuned up for my liking, but once I started sipping this one down it became a pleasurable experience."
"First imperial stout in a can i've tried and what a great start. I am lucky 2 have a couple of more of these sitting in my fridge. Recommended!"
"The body is medium, the carbonation subtle...for having an ABV of 9.5%, this stuff drinks like a champ. Thoroughly enjoyable! (a little tastier on tap)"
"I've never had such a top notch beer in a can before. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: A delicious and hearty brew for the stout lover. It lived up to the hype."
"It's a wonderful party going on inside this glass but you might not want to park your car right out front, if you get my drift. Things get kind of rough in there."
"D- Not a session but very drinkable."
"Overall: Thanks to Russpowell and OHLRangers for both generously hooking me up with the beer. It is another fine beer to drink on the 75th anniversery of the repeal of prohibition."
"Overall, I will not be buying another 4 pack of this stuff or anything else from Oskar Blues in cans."
"Man, I could drink these all night long! Damn, I love a good stout."
"tastes of rosted malts, Chocolate, coffee, slight alcohol. Little hop bitterness tasted. Feels thick and syrupy in the mouth. A nicer sipper beer would be hard to drink fast considering the thickness of it, but i Could drink these all night if the alcohol wasnt so strong."
"Too drinkable! But a great ale."
"D) Like a tub that's too hot, getting in feels harsh and punishing, but once you're in: oh momma it's good. Dark heavy handed professional brings the skills; clean, bright hop profile that's unique without being charring, This beer doesn't just scratch that spot, it hammers it. Bravo, and thank God you've made it to Texas."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Chewy and active, just enough to engage the palate and demonstrate the effectivenes of this beer's overall bigness. Slick and mouthfilling, this will literally stain your teeth brown. Alcohol is completely hidden beneath the hops, a real winner for the style."
"UPDATE: Had on tap at Plan B (suspect it was on nitro). It had a much larger and creamier head than from the can. Much smoother and easier to drink and there was less roastiness/bitterness than I had detected previously. Definitely prefered the on tap version, so sample on tap if you can! 7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Didn't think it was all it was cracked up to be. Have another one but I don't know how well a can will age..."
"The 10 % abv is not overwhelming. This is a nice RIS that I could easily drink again."
"D - A calorie dense beverage that feels sweeter than it is. I like this one a lot but it is a bit too much after a couple. Increasing the abv and the bitterness and I would stick with this one all night."
"Couldn't have much more than the pint I had!"
"Wow, this beer is intense. Pours very thick dark brown/block with chocolate brown head. It tastes almost like a cafe mocha at first, getting more bitter as the beer warms. The alcohol is differently hidden well in the taste (although i definately felt it), and i don't get as strong a roasted malt taste as i do with other stouts."
"Pours pitch black with huge foamy beige head. Malty aroma of roasted coffee, chcolate and toffee. Excellent easy drinking stout. ABV very well masked. Very complex with lots of roasted coffee and chocolate maltiness, oatmeal, toffee, caramel and a nice bitter hop finish."
"To quote my mother-in-law, this beer is very ""beery"". I guess that means it'll grow hair on your chest... or that other place, huh huh. Very thick malty presence, hardly any hops, but a warming feel of alcohol as it goes down your throat. You could say it's like pure dark chocolate in a bottle. Very nice on these cold nights in the VA mountains."
"Easily the best beer I've had from a can. Right up there with other great imperial stouts."
"When pouring this deep dark oilish looking beer into a pint glass the brown head given is quite appeasing. When it reduces to a great amount of lingerence of lacing. The aroma of cooking chocolate, smokeyness and licorice great the nose and tantilize it. While this beer has a bold and flavorful taste of cooking chocolate, toffees, and smoke. The aftertaste of alcohol stays on the tongue and roasted malts."
"Drinkability: Many flavors, but none dominates. Surprisingly mild aftertaste for such a big beer makes drinking easy. This is an extreme beer, but still is quite drinkable. Works better with food though. Highly drinkable, though I wish it had something in it that made me want to savor it just a bit more."
"It's a keeper."
"Overall, Ten Fidy is a great beer, but it is surpassed in its style by others."
"There are a lot of flavors working here, it's complex and interesting and warrants some attention while drinking. I will save the remainders for special occasions, and get some more as well."
"I am so glad Oskar Blues moved into my beer-turf. Ten Fidy is amazing. I bought this can in Boston at the BBF and flew it home to find that a month later Ten Fidy was available locally. I wish more beers came in cans. The airplane-loader guys would have to outdo themselves to detriment a can."
"Overall impression: This is a very bitter stout, but in a good way. The bitterness never overshadows the complexity of flavors. I want my stouts thick and this is one of the thickest, creamiest stouts I've had. Of course the 10% abv contributes to this being a sipping stout. Oskar Blues continues to impress me."
"D - A sipper... This is a very nice RIS... The look and smell are near perfection... There is a slight drop off in taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability, though all are solid... Best stout from a can I've ever been privileged to sample... Another solid offering from Oskar Blues..."
"Reviewed 11/6/2008 (Tap @ Flying Saucer, Houston, TX): Pours an inky black hole color body. Big tan head, good lacing, somewhat diminishing. Coffee alcoholy aroma, dark fruitiness, some dustiness. Coffee taste, watery, hot. Dusty. Warming up...Still a little hot, dusty. Malty, dark chocolately taste. Eh, not a fan."
"This is definitely my Christmas night beer this year, when I save something special to enjoy (hopefully in front of the gas fire, if it's cold)."
"Overall, this is a goodbeer. Definitely better after it breathed some."
"Drinkability: Slightly better out of the can than on tap, in my opinion, much smokier and more intense. Plus, it's out of a can! I wonder how much that's factored into the various reviews. Anyway. This one's good, very good, very drinkable, very flavorful, creamy, milky, smooth, aromatic, pleasant to look at, and though the alcohol's double digits, it's expertly hidden. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel was impressive, carbonation was fitting with the style. As far as drinkability, I have to say this was perfect. Its 10%, but if I weren't rationing these beers due to its availibiltiy and cost, I could have 2-3, maybe 4. I was craving another can after this, but I restrained myself. Now, I keep thinking about the taste and can't wait to have more."
"D= An excellent Russian Imperial Stout, one of my favorites for sure. I found this to be damn drinkable and dare I say sessionable, if you consider a session to be two beers and a long nap. Would make a great nightcap brew."
"This one is scary in the drinkability and is well doen for sure. Quite a nice one to find regularly in 4 packs."
"Excellent beer, one can is all I want but I will enjoy every sip."
"Drinkability- A RIS in a can. I love it. Overall pretty darn drinkable given the style."
"[Tap @ Hop Devil Grill] Poured a deep, dark, black color with a super dark, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, buttered toffee malts, smoke, and a floral hoppiness. Taste was rather viscous, dripping with roast, smoke, and chocolate, with a fair amount of alcohol, and a super thick mouthfeel. After sampling both batches, the first batch is preferred. Creamier, sweeter, and fuller mouthfeel. More enjoyable over the drier, roastier 2nd batch."
"A big monster of a stout. Everything about this is huge. I can't say that it is something I will get again, but interesting to try once."
"Pours a deep black with a dark chocolate head. One of the darkest heads I have seen! Head comes alive from deep within the beer mountaining up to build a three finger head. As the head falls, a thick sheet of head remains on the glass, legs for days. Smell is sweet, very fruity. Dark fruit dominates, raspberry, fig, plum covered in burnt brown sugar, mollasses and some roasty smoke. So sweet. Taste is so smooth! Begins with the tiniest bit of burnt toast before giving way to dark fruits... raspberry covered in syrup, chocolate covered raisins, old red grapes. Beautifully drinkable. A bit thin compared to some of the top RIS's but almost sessionable (nevermind your head swimming!). Texas loves the Ten Fidy!"
"Probably the biggest beer I've ever had out of a can. Crazy...."
"With that said, it would be tough to choke down many of these in one sitting. On the other hand with the high alcohol content one beer is probably enough."
"After being very underwhelmed by Oskar Blues' Gordon's DIPA, I was a rigid skeptic of Ten FIDY's hype...until I popped the top. Ten FIDY is not only the best beer in a can, but it might be the best RIS i've had yet."
"Undoubtedly the best Russian Imperial Stout ever poured from a can. For some reason I feel dirty just admitting that. The beer slowly crawls out of the can and carefully eases itself into the glass with a more-viscous-than-most appearance. Low on carbonation, but releases an firm yet terse foamstand that laced and retained quite well. The beer is as dark and opaque as they come. The motor oil comparison that others have used is a good descriptor. Bold aromas of roasted barley malt, espresso, cocoa beans, and sweet alcohols garner attention from the nose. The flavor profile is much the same, but with the major emphasis on the roasted malts and espresso notes that just dominate the beer. Light hoppiness goes largely unnoticed, as do the esters, phenols, and any other delicate yeast qualities. Not overly complex, they have given this stout very few jobs to accomplish, but to do so larger and bolder than anyone else. They've largely succeeded. The beer is heavy, thick, and nearly syrupy. The light carbonation gives just enough lift to make the beer palatable. Finishes as you could imagine with a long lingering of espresso, cocoa, and warming alcohols."
"An Oskar Blues brew I would recommend, vs. condemn, what a concept! Not an outstanding RIS, yet decent, and worth a try. Might be better in the can if it holds the carbonation better, will pick up if I can find a single..."
"Smooth as hell and full bodied. Perfect carbonation and smoothness make this an easy sipper and an easy drinker. Another winner from Oskar Blues."
"D - Excellent cold weather beer. Could probably use some age and it would be interesting to see if it ages well"
"An exceptional beer at an exceptionally high price, but worth it. Pours dark, thick, and slow into my favorite stolen pint glass, almost no head, but leaves a deep lacing that is still present at the end of the glass. A beer to be drank occasionally, tastes of a dark roasted malt with a hint of alcohol that can not be hid, due the high content, smells as it tastss, with a bit of an aftertaste that does not really fade away, smooth in the mouth, a very nice beer all around, and if you can pick it up for under $13 a four pack, you are doing well"
"D - This is an outstanding brew. Really one of the finest beers around."
"this is the definition of easy drinker. i have finally found the alcohol in this beer as my belly is nice and warm. i love you ten fidy. come back to me again soon."
"Can sample- very viscous pour, really lives up to the name. Dark stuff. Reasonable tan head. Nose- licorice, oats and dark chocolate. Taste- incredibly thick bodied. You could cut it with a knife. Very well melded flavours lap over the tongue, big chocoalte and licorce flavour, extra kick from the oats. Surprised to see this is 98 ibu, hops seem to swallowed by the black hole of beautiful malts. Finishes nicely."
"Drinkability - super stuff, that it's in a can just adds to the convenience and aura that is Oskar. Kudos to Yesac for pushing me to put this can in the fridge and check 'er out. Enjoyed this during Game 3 of the World Series, Tampa vs Philly. Toasts to both teams are in order for a fine game and one of the most competitive series through three that I can remember. Booyah!!"
"Overall: One of the best RIS's around; I want to have a 6-pack in my fridge all the time now!!! This is truly an amazing beer, and one that I will seek out and obtain. A must try."
"Notes: Glad I'm sitting on a couple more of these. I don't think it'd replace Expedition if it were available here, but I'd sure as hell buy more of them. Totally worth finding/buying."
"The beer is prodigious, complex, and loaded with character. It is chocolately, has thick roasted coffee malts, charred cherry flavors, and a strong ABV backbone that tastes like a roasted liqueur. There are some hoppy notes towards the finish, a throaty ABV burn, and a really oily mouthfeel coupled with the ABV presence. The aftertaste is quite pronounced. For me, this is a sipping beer and that's it. I can't handle the strength of this beer, but for what it is, it is a great representation of the style. L'Chaim."
"poured into a dfh goblet, this was a thick, opaque black; no seeing through this even when held towards the light. minimal, quickly diminishing brown head. coffee and chocolate dominate the aroma with suggestions of dark dried fruit. alcohol is well-hidden, which is a plus for me. thick, sweet, dark malts are well balanced by a bitter roastiness. a bit of warming alcohol down the throat. so well balanced i couldn't put the glass down for more than a minute. mouthfeel was viscous but not overly so; lightly carbonated. hands down one of the best of this style that i've had. good fucking shit and well worth the money."
"Overall the Russian Imperial Stout in a can is big, complex, and heady. It's worth it -- I'm impressed."
"Overall this is even better on-tap than it is from the can. Now if I can only find it on cask."
"Had on tap and appropriately served in a small snifter. Pours pitch black with a dark toffee thin head of small bubbles. A lot of chocolate and coffee here, but everything in balance. Also a hint of vanilla that tastes very natural-not the artificial taste that is often present in many stouts. Drinkability is on par for the style--it is rather heavy in body, but the 10%ABV is not as apparent as expected. Great with a chocolate based dessert or as a dessert by itself."
"Very good for an imperial stout. Not my favorite, but close. One of the best beers I've had out of a can. Try it if you can find it."
"D: On a cold night by a campfire, hell yes. My favorite Oscar beer by far."
"Pairs well with chocolate."
"D- Not for faint of heart, but this nails the Russian Imperial style, which I could drink until my eyes melt."
"I don't think Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy is my favourite RIS, but it makes a very convincing case. It is stupendously tasty and absurdly drinkable. As good as it is on its own, I really recommend pairing this with dessert, chocolate brownies make a marvelous match. Regardless, be sure to try it one way or another, you'll be quite glad you did!"
"not bad, but expecting just a little bit more from a ""top 100"" beer. bitterness slightly overpowers the pleasant sweetness and other nuances."
"Black, black as night. Almost too black. Drank straight from the can. Smelled sweet and roasted. It has a thick mouthfeel but goes down very smooth. A slight bitter aftertaste doesn't last long and leaves you wanting more. Small chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Doesn't kill your mouth. Try it!"
"This was hands down the best American beer I've had out of a can yet. I was impressed by the dark, thick appearance. It had a nice roasty flavor, and was incredibly drinkable for a stronger imperial stout. I'm interested to try some of their other offerings to give me a more balanced opinion of their brews. The can is an incredible marketing strategy for a craft brewery."
"Pretty damn good RIS. Certainly worth a shot if you can get it."
"Drinkability: Not for the faint of heart. Flavor is extremely rich. Watch out for the full body and high ABV. This might just kill you."
"this beer pours a midnight black with a thick cascading brown head that turns into a rocky foam sticking to the sides of the glass. the aroma is not only malty as expected with an imperial stout, but also presents a very distinct hop character. the taste is all that the nose promises with smooth malt and a hoppy sweet finish. with the low co2 and heavy body the alcohol pales in comparison to the great taste of this beer. a very drinkable ten fidy"
"Overall: awesome ... in a can"
"D: This is dangerously drinkable. 10% ABV, and you can't even tell. I literally could pound these down, except that would be blasphemy, because it's way too flavorful and enjoying. This RIS is best enjoyed slowly, although is definitely something you could EASILY chug."
"This beer poured an inky black with a single-finger dark tan head that lingered for a while. The smell is big on roasted malts with hints of milk chocolate. They taste starts off with deep roasted malt that gave way to dark chocolate and coffee with some pleasant bitterness. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden, and there is not as much heat on the back end as I expected. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with very find carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, a good mix of Russian Imperial flavors without the huge bitter punch that can be offputting at times. A great beer."
"Finally got around to purchasing supposedly one of the best Russian Imperial Stout's around. At about $12.99 a 4 pack I would to wait until I got a good paycheck before I went out and tried some of these. Pours the darkest black you can imagine and smells of roasted malts. The taste is very smooth and has a slight alcohol warming at the end. It's very flavorful and I'm glad I tried it, still no sure if it totally lived up to the hype though."
"D: Not too high up there given the intensity and high abv. I never know how to rank drinkability for these beers. There's no way you're drinking more than one or two of these. But they're awesome."
"Good lord, this is a meal of a stout. Tar black with a ton of head when you pour it. Really strong smell of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Tastes the same, and I was also getting some black licorice in there. Phenomenal. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, without coming across as syrupy."
"D: This is a great stout from Oskar Blues, I knew I had to jump on the chance to try it at Beachwood. It wasn't mind-blowing like Oak Aged Yeti or Abyss, but it was still great stuff."
"Poured the can into my Dogfish head snifter, pours a pitch motor oil black with a tan head. This beer left a bit of lace on the glass the entire time. Smell is dark roasted chocolate, toffee, caramel, burnt tree and also alcohol. Taste is pretty impressive, I drank this beer over a 3 hour time, as it warmed nice roasted flavors came out with hints of espresso, chocolate, bark, and a nice hop finish. This has an oily/slick taste to it, as it went down. Overall this beer is amazing, hops make a good balance between the roasted character of this beer."
"D: Almost too good to be true. Alchol is well hidden, almost dangerous!. One of the better RIS's I have had. Highly recommended."
"Ten Fidy is an exceptional imperial stout and possibly one of the greatest beers ever to be put in an aluminum can."
"Beer poured black as night with a strong brown head. Nose is sweet malts, chocolate, and coffee with a hint of alcohol. Taste is of roasted malts and coffee with a beautiful bitter chocolate finish. Warming alcohol was present with the initial sips. Mouthfeel is creamy perfection. It is full bodied yet light at the same time. Each sip is incredibly smooth as there must be some oatmeal in the recipe. Overall drinkability is perfect. I have to believe this is the best RIS I have had to date!"
"Drinkability is great, especially for an RIS. It just goes down so nicely, and I'm crying inside because this was my one and only Ten Fidy. I will definately seek this out in the future. A fabulous brew. Even though Surly is my first love, Oskar Blues fricking rocks!"
"An excellent brew, possibly the best in a can. Highly recommended."
"D-Highly, for the ABV and style"
"This poured (from a can) totally opaque, pitch black with dark tan head. It smelled like alcohol, roasted coffee beans, licorice hops, and milk chocolate malt. It tasted like very bitter burnt coffee with strong licorice hops, and a bit of roasted chocolate malt, with sour alcohol taste. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a very bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful and potent beer. I would typically suggest aging to mellow out the character, but I'm not sure if that would work for this beer, since it comes in a can? Regardless, it was very clean and complex, with great flavor and body."
"A couple extra notes. Open the can carefully. I write this review as it is the last of the 4 pack I bought to drink right away. Each can, no matter how slow and careful I was, was so full that I always got some on my hand. They filled these babies to the top and then some. Also, since they are in cans, I will start cellaring them to see what happens after aging them a bit. A can is totally air tight and no chance of light so... we will see."
"12 oz. can. Pours a black color with a frothy brown head, fair lacing. Aroma is heavy roasted malts, caramel, dark chocolate, lots of coffee, and a touch of pine hops. Flavor is sweet dark chocolate, coffee, a bitter hoppy finish, and a touch of alcohol. Full bodied, creamy on the tounge and the coffee sticks with you for a while."
"cheers"
"This beer pours oily pitch black in the glass with a carmel colored head that quickly disapears. The smell is chocolate and alcohol which not suprising considering its high abv. The taste is bitter, chocolate and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, not as carbonated as I would like. Drinkability is good but obviously hindered a bit by its high abv."
"Poured in glass with a pitch black appearance. with carmel foam head and oily lacing around the glass. Smell is coffee/chocolate/alcohol and taste matches. Mouthfeel is thick and oily, good malt/hops balance, a very good RIS. Once again it's impressive what Oskar Blues is putting into vans...wonder if it woul dbe any better in a bottle."
"D- Almost no hotness from the alcohol comes through. It's a sipper because of it's massive consistency. Overall, a really nice, classic example of what a Russian Imperial Stout should be."
"Drinkability- The abv and heat keep the drinkability down a bit, but only because I don't want to sweat off 10lbs and do something to get me arrested. The flavor never gets old and doesn't ware on the tongue. Come winter, I will be trading for more than a few of these guys to keep me toasty."
"D-Could have a couple. Not one of my favorite IS."
"If this doesn't end the ""no good craft beer can be in a can"" argument, nothing will. Can, draft, bottle, a mighty fine Imperial Stout everbody should try at least once."
"If Willy Wonka had this running through his factory I would have stabbed Augustus in the eye with a candy cane and jumped in before he could get his mitts on it."
"D - I would try to drink more, I want to drink more, but it is 10%..."
"D: I drank this on an empty stomach and was surprised at how ""non-invasive"" the alcohol was. I found this to be supremely drinkable and one of the most enjoyable Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"D- its a beast with this much alcohol, but its a pleasure to drink. i really wish it was available in this area so i could drink it on a regular basis. id have more of this whenever i got the chance. recommended"
"Fingers crossed this makes it out west. Stellar brew. As other notes state, coco, coffee, roasted malt with very slight sweet and vanilla. Where this wins for me is the texture and thickness though refreshing and never feeling that heavy. Quality in a can!"
"I had a few of these, and was full, but very, very content."
"I couldn't wait from the time I first tried this beer a few weeks ago to write a review about it. I was picking up some beer to-go tonight and figured it would be worth it to get a can and write up a few lines about it. First off, I LOVE CRAFT BEER IN A CAN!!!! There is something almost romantic about a can of beer and now that I can get good beer in a can, it makes that romance even hotter. I poured this bad boy into a 16 ounce pint glass. There was a little head straight outta the can, a milky chocolate color, which slowly dissipated. The aroma was full of dark roasted malts with dark chocolate. The taste was mellow...no bite for a beer that boasts a 10.5% ABV. If you get the chance to try a can of this EPIC brew, don't put it off...this dog will hunt!"
"D - A huge stout that should not be taken lightly. Certainly worth picking up, and perfect for that first cold night of fall."
"All in all a very impressive stout...damn its good."
"Exceptional brew! I am very glad that I recently picked up a whole case of this. That will be a well enjoyed case. I cannot believe how all these good beers from Oskar Blues come from a can. Great job! Don't underestimate what can come out of a CAN!"
"These guys make fucking awesome beer then they put it in a can! I know it shouldn't be a surprise to find beer this awesome in a can these days but i still do. Don't let it deter you, buy anything by Oscar Blues!"
"D: At 10%, and with the heavy body of this beer, I could not drink more than one of these in a session. It probably didn't help that this was the conclustion to a session that included (2) Stone Ruination, ABA, RIS, and Green Flash IPA."
"Pours a deep opaque black with a thin tan head that diminished to a ring. Aroma was roasted malts and slight bitter chocolate. The taste was a smooth blend of roasted malts, fresh ground coffee beans, bitter chocolate and slight molasses. The beer is medium bodied and smooth with well hidden alcohol, there is also slight carbonation that only makes it smoother. This one is certainly a sipper, but it is quite enjoyable, I imagine it will be even better on a cold winter night."
"M,D. The mouthfeel is extremely chewy and lacking some carbonation. Thus, the drinkability is quite low, but this is a great brew nonetheless!"
"D - This came in as a very hyped beer and it was pretty solid. It's a great RIS with some good flavors in it. If you can get it defintely give it a taste."
"Drinkability - I love the IPA's from Oskar Blues, and this is another good offering as well. Not my favorite from them, but definitely worthy of it's following. A mean hoppy brew if your looking for a big bitter chocolaty RIS."
"This beer is one of if not the best imperial stout I have ever had the pleasure of driking. God bless Oskar Blues!"
"Finally had a chance to try this beer. Ordered a can while at Sunset this past Saturday. Poured into a tulip glass. First thing you notice is that it comes out of the can like motor oil. Probably the thickest beer I have ever seen. Dark black body, with a large brown head. Smelled like roasted coffee beans. More coffee in the flavor, mingled with chocolate and malt. A perfect example of an RIS. Even at 10% abv, it still seemed smooth enough to drink a few. Maybe it's a good thing it only comes in 4 packs. Definitely has earned it's reputation as a worth stout and a must-try."
"This is a good, strong stout. I love the can. Can't serve it too col and a touch more CO2 would be welcome. It kinda reminds me of the Le COQ."
"d: a decent istout and certainly the only i stout i have had from a can which is pretty cool. maybe i'll take some next time i go backpacking"
"single can from Norm's Vienna"
"As far as mouthfeel is concerned, it feels like it looks: thick and syrupy. Also, it's very lightly carbonated. This is a fairly big beer, so I doubt I'd have more than two, but I'd certainly enjoy the hell out of those two."
"This is an incredible beer and deserves to be held in high regard. Please, Oskar Blues, don't let this one go retired."
"A killer beer that you can really savor for at least 40 minutes."
"This beer is a dark black with a small tan head. The smell is a nice blend of chocolate, oatmeal, coffee and more. The taste had some sort of funky medicinal taste that detracted from the brew somewhat. the abv show and there is a nice roasted aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. This is a slow sipper and a very filling brew that is a unique find in a can."
"Aroma is a sweet malty chocolate. The taste is a fantastic balance if malt and hop, with great hints of coffee, fruit, and burnt malt. Very little carbonation (almost silent when I popped the tab), this is a thick, syrupy delicious meal of a beer. A little pricey, but this would make a fantastic treat of a beer on a cold night."
"Awesome Imperial stout. I will be getting more."
"Old Chub is easily one of my favorite scottish ales, and Dale's Pale Ale is pretty damn good when I had it on tap too. Looks like Im gonna have to try their Gordon!"
"Whoa! This little can packs a punch! Quite possibly, no... without question, the darkest beer I've ever seen! BLACK. No light gets through. Creamy dark brown head. Exceptional retention given the strength. Nice lacing. Dark malt aroma. Some dark fruit. Some cocoa. Some background 'spent' hop. Mainly just dark malt. Coffee-like. Black coffee like. And that carries over into the flavor. More black coffee. Rich. Blanketing. Somewhat acidic, but not too much acidic. Solid mouthfeel. Firm and oily smooth. Flavors become more apparent as it warms, revealing more fruitiness (fig, burnt currant - which means dark berry-like fruitiness but with a bit of a tang, raisin, prune), lots of bittersweet chocolate, more coffee in a less roasty/acidic vein, more 'spent' and earthy/leafy hops, black licorice, burnt sugar, and alcohol. Solid bitterness. Quite the beast! Impressive. My fellow drinkers are satiated at one sip... ... I, however, could have another! Drinkable in the summer heat in Brooklyn? Yeah, with air conditioning! I'll have to grab some of this to enjoy as the leaves fall or the snow sets. Wonderfully super-rich libation! WHOAH!!! DAMN, I just looked at the receipt - $8 a can!!!?? Better make that just a 'few' cans for the entire winter season ;)"
"D- Easy to drink, even easier to drink in a can, I'm glad it comes in a can."
"D - This is everything a good imperial stout should be awesome taste thats very smooth I think I'd try to drink this all night long or until it kicks my ass worth hunting out to try"
"Hard to believe beer from a can is this good! Bravo! Oskar Blues has a winner with this one!"
"This was a decent beer but did not want to finish it."
"Pours super thick as you would expect, pretty dark tan head. Smell is thick and roasty, alcohol, chocolate but nothing really sweet. The taste is just a soup of roastiness and bitter chocolate but it's really masked by the alcohol and slickness of the body. It's pretty flavor and not so in your face, except that it's like drinking sludge. This would be hard to drink a whole glass of, and I probably would never want to do it. There are other Imperial Russian Stouts that I have drank whole glasses of and have loved, so Ten Fidy gets marked down in that area."
"Poured from a 12oz can (no dating info) that my buddy shipped me from Colorado. I let it warm up to proper temp before popping it open. It poured out like motor oil into the pint glass. It was pitch black and thick. It had a 2 finger dark brown head that slowly settled into a constant foam. No visible carb but great lacing that stuck around till it was finished. The smell was coffee, roasted choc malts and alcohol. It had a bit too much of an alcohol smell for me to rate higher. The taste was also impacted by the high alcohol. I had other RIS with same or higher ABV that masked it better. Not bad but kept me from really enjoying it. The rest of the taste was really good. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy but the alcohol left an oily feeling on the tongue. Overall, a good but not great beer from OB. Will need to try again to make sure the sample was proper. Also would love to try on tap again. I had it in a sampler at the brewery/restaurant and seem to remember it being better.+"
"D- This is a big engine oil body with a dark roast smooth and creamy flavor. Not really complex but enough depth to keep this monster interesting."
"D. Very enjoyable, would certainly have again. The ABV is hidden in taste, but noticable after drinking."
" Drinkability is diminished slightly by heavyness and high alcohol content."
"Pours a jet black with a large brown foamy head. This is really a special looking beer. The lacing is fantastic and the color is so dark no light can shine through. The smell is pungent with roasted malt,alcohol,cocoa,chocolate,and a hint of dark fruit. The taste is very creamy,like hot chocolate or chocolate milk. Like the smell,the taste has alcohol,roasted malt,dark fruit and of course,chocolate. The m/f is very heavy with all the flavors mixing well. This is a true Russian Imperial Stout. Thick,strong,flavorful,if you want a special beer, here you go."
"Good beer to drink at Ten fidy at night, or early morning. Drink it now, and how."
"Pours completely black, with no highlights and a small khaki head composed of very small bubbles. Nose is fairly mild, with a nice milk chocolate aroma, some coffee and cream and faint brown sugar. Taste is a nice, hefty roastiness, balanced by chocolatey sweetness, a hint of smoke, and an appropriate level of hop bitterness. Drier than other stouts in its class. The mouthfeel on this one is really exceptional for a non-oatmeal stout. It's quite weighty without being too sweet or sticky, and the high ABV is nearly invisible. A fantastic example of a by-the-book imperial stout."
"The words that come to mind with this ""thing from a can"" are big, oily, grassy, pungent, thick, thick, bittersweet chocolate, subtle coffee, caramel, thick, tons of roasted malt, thick, and unbelievable... even smelled some marshmellow smores in there... Awesome brew, but not one to drink all the time it's so over the top!! Everything an imperial stout should be."
"Drinkability is good for the style but only a couple of these is more than enough for a night."
"Wow. motor oil into my glass. I could smell this fella two feet above the pour and into the glass. Two finger head, poured like oil into my car. Dark black and tan head then dropped to a thin head after a few moments. Lacing on the glass is great, a constant coat around the glass. Complex smell and taste. Coffee, chocolates, and sweet smells, lots of roasting here. Sweet at the front, bitter on the sides of the tongue, good mild hop profile with the roasted malts. Not tasting the alcohol on the palette or in the nose, deceptive in hiding, could cause trouble robocop style. Lots of bittering notes and dark malts in this one. Excellent caned brew. Recommend for heavy stout drinkers."
"dark, thick and wonderfull can all be used to discribe this fine brew, this one is so dark and thick that i cant even get the light to shine through this one tiping it all the way to the rim, this one is all about the dark carmal and robust malt with no real hop to speak of. this one realy lookes like moter oil in a glass, this is how a stout should be, and after i felt like i had a meal in a glsss."
"A real good smooth drinker. One can can last you a good long while. I am giving this one a 5 for drinkability, which I actually don't think i've done before, certainly not for anything imperial!"
"Pours motor-oil-thick, black, impenetrable by light, tiny dark brown head rises and fades, leaving a light coating on the beer with decent lacing. Smell is big-time cocoa, dark fruit, molasses, some coffee. Taste is dark roasted coffee, some burnt edges, a hint of spicy alcohol on the lips. This one is thick and chewy, coats the inside of the mouth, and the flavors linger, especially the burnt coffee. I'm a huge fan of this beer...easily one of my favorite Imperial Stouts."
"""Blackened is the end."""
"Pretty decent RIS. I wouldn't put this up against the big boys in my personal pantheon, but it's a good beer."
"Pitch black Imperial Stout. 1/2"" chocalate milk of a head with good retention at 1/4"". Leaves full lace and thick rings. Nose is full of rich malt, molasses, tar, and dark fruit. Big dark chocolate, layers of malt...bitter roasted malt. Coffee. Some fruit soaked alcohol. Leafy hops in the finish. Full body. Thick and velvety mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Very good drinkability -- excellent. Thanks to doulos31 for the can."
"An adventure to enjoy. Intense and complex."
"Definitely very warm, but not outright boozy. One of the better RIS's out there. The fact that its canned is just icing on the cake."
"It smells and looks amazing, but taste wise it's VERY much out of balance. All the flavors are there, but it's just so overly burnt and bitter as to make it hard to want to drink more. I love Oscar Blues, but think this one is a pass."
"Seek it out."
"Very, very nice. This is a beer absolutely deserving of it's spot among the elite Imperial Stouts in the world. I'll be buying some of these again."
"Poured into my gigantor sniftor dark as night with a small brown head leaving nice lacing with just a little swirl. Strong odor of coffee, dark chocolate, and oats. Tastes about how it smells with a little booze kick added. The chocolate and the oats seemed to dominate at first with the coffee and moleasses flavors coming out stronger as the glass warms a bit to room temperature. Thick and chewy feel in the mouth. Overall a solid RIS and another hit from Oscar Blues. Also, it comes in a can... how can you go wrong there. They could one up themselves by putting the BA version in a can that would be twice as awsome."
"I probably would have rated this higher, but I had some Kate the Great in the afternoon, and when I got home wanted to continue with a RIS. Poured into a tulip glass the beer was a black color with a medium-sized orange/tan head. The aroma was chocolate, coffee/roasted malt, a little vanilla. The taste followed aroma. I thought the coffee dominated, as well as showing some late, espresso-like bitterness. The beer filled me up, and was maybe a little on the harsh side. It was still a very good beer."
"Notes: Excellent. One of my favorite imperial stouts to date. Very glad I bought two 4-packs, even at not-so-cheap prices (I think it was $14 per 4-pack). . . . Worth seeking out."
"Thanks to tprokop7 for the one can."
"Very drinkable for the style and being in a can adds to the drinkability imo, b/c cans are more friendly to certain drinking situations. By far the best canned beer I've had and I'm hoping more breweries put quality stuff in cans."
"Drinkability is without a doubt the best thing here. I will definitely recommend this stuff not only to my father (who loves stouts) but all of my beer drinking friends. What a great brew!"
"Poured a viscous, deep brown-black color with a strong head that left behind some stringy lacing. The viscosity of the beer was enticing and uncommon. Aromas of cocoa, expresso, and hearty grains stood out for me. The subtle sweet aroma was quite interesting. The taste is just incredible with hints of chocolate, baked bread, and roasted coffee beans coming out at different moments. The sweetness of the beer is tempered by a hop-derived flavors that transition into deep grain-like flavors. Rich and textured in my mouth, I really enjoyed this beer, but wouldn't be able to handle more than 1 in a setting."
"Wonderful stuff."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer. Not the best impy stout I've had but a solid one for sure. Plus it comes in a can! Yeah it does!"
"A great beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Gford217: Poured a deep pitch-black color stout with a huge deep brown color head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of roasted malt with some vinous notes and some sweet notes. Taste is a mix between some vinous notes with some roasted malt and a quite sweet finish. I could not detect much coffee or black chocolate notes that I usually associated with the style. Full body with average carbonation and no discernable alcohol. Interesting sipper but I am not sure what the hype was all about really."
"Full body, almost creamy. Seems a bit too dry for me. Alcohol is very much evident. I liked this, but maybe not as much as others. If nothing else, then love this for being an imperial stout in a can!"
"This is intense above all else. The smokiness quotient is raised above any stout I've had, and pushes towards Rauch-status. It's like a mouthful of grill-scrapings chased with a Laphroaig 10 YO Scotch with an double black espresso sidecar. I love it, but one can at a time and slowly."
"Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers."
"Sips well, not overally as thick as it looks, goes down smoothe. The 10% ABV is well masked but I""m not sure i could do more than of these. It compares well to Darklord, but do not like it as much as I do the GI Bourbon County Stout. Very interesting for my first craft beer in a can. I enjoyed this beer alot, just had a few issues with the raisins, and some of the tastes on the front of the tongue."
"Oskar Blues has done what most thought impossible... they put a delicious RIS in a flipping can."
"D: For an imperial stout this is quite drinkable. Could easily have a few of these. Would pair well with a nice chocolate dessert."
"This is one of the most balanced RIS's I have ever had. Most have an big sweetness to them, this is the first I have had that throws the hops in your face. A tremendous brew, easily the best RIS in a can and one of the best out there period."
"A solid imperial stout. I am still adjusting to the fact that this came from a can. Seek and Savor."
"This is an ""in your face"" beer but falls short in balance & drinkability."
"gift from shivtim. Actually, i was saving this can for kkulacki, but he got his own 4 pack, so now its mine! Pours massively black and tarry, with a thin, very brown head. Smells fruity and chocolatey, thick malt and alcohol odor. Massive burnt malt and dark chocolate flavor. rich and creamy. roastiness fairly intense, bordering on bitter or metallic. Almost fruity, but not quite, if that makes sense. thick to the point where im expecting lumps, but no lumps appear. huge, as a good RIS should be. A big beast of a beer...in a can! Not as supremely awesome as Gordon, but still awesome."
"My first can was enjoyed 3 nights ago on a camping trip with 2 of my buddies. I shoulda brought more then one can, it went down to quick. Was a colder rainy night around the campfire."
"Ten FIDY pours from a twelve ounce can as an opaque black with a milk chocolate colored head that faded almost as quickly as it formed. The aroma is black malt. There is a very thick mouthfeel. The hops are barely noticeable, this one is all about the malt, dark chocolate and hints of coffee abound. Not particularly complex, but very tasty."
"Big thanks to Gleix for bringing this back for me. Glad to see that OB is making its appearance here in PA - I'll be on the look out for this!"
"12oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours an extremely thick, pitch black color with a nice tan head. The aroma is dark and roasty with a lot of chocolate. The taste starts out smooth and creamy with some sweet malt and chocolate. Then, BAM! The hops kick in to make a very bitter finish. The mouthfeel is the best part of the beer in my opinion. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and chewy, one of the better textures in a beer that I have had. This is a sipper for sure, but I could see myself enjoying a couple cans on a cold evening. Despite it being June and balls hot in Florida, I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. Overall, Ten Fidy is another kick ass offering from Oskar Blues that is highly recommended!"
"Pours out a deep, dark black color with a dark brown, thick head. This is an extremely viscous liquid. Roasted coffee, espresso and dark chocolate in the nose. The taste is incredible, burnt coffee beans, dark chocolate, cherries, bananas, and oak. It is heavy in the mouth and has a very full body. This beer is hands down the most fun beer to drink. I think it has to do with the fact that it comes in a can and it's an incredible beer. I can't stop drinking these things. They're so good and fun. It's weird, but I feel that's the only way to explain it."
"They made one minor error when packaging this beer, the got the name wrong. It should not be Ten Fidy but 10-W-50. Poured from a can to a pint glass like dirty motor oil out of an '87 Cadillac Brougham. It stained the glass with it's blackness. Had a sweet roasted malt, chocolate, coffee smell. The taste was sweet coffee, toffee, roasted malts, syrupy deliciousness. This drank like a muddy maple syrup. Wow I can't believe that was just poured out of a can. This is a slow sipper but very good. I look forward to introducing this one to friends."
"Wow, thanks ColoradoBobs. Great, great stuff."
"Over the top flavors, but one you should get your hands on."
"Pours about as dark brown/black as you can get. Very rocky, brown head forms on top. Smell is roasted malt and milk duds. Taste is huge! Very roasted malts, and I mean roasted. Charred might even be a better term. Full, creamy and very velvety on the mouthfeel. This has a close feel as a weak milkshake as you can get. This would be very complimentary to a good dark dessert. Can't get over the amount of roast, chocolate and coffee that is here. Over the top, but good beer."
"D - A very smooth easy to drink (if a RIS is easy to drink) beer. I can't see how I would ever need this beer in a can but I love the can idea."
"I poured a 12oz can into a pint glass. It poured a very viscous, opaque BLACk. They may as well call it 10-W Fidy because it looks like used motor oil. Very thin brown head left a small amount of lacing on the glass. It smelled of roasted coffee, molasses and a mild hoppiness. It tased a bit sweet with caramel and coffee and a slight alcohol warmth on the back of the throat. It was a very sticky beer that was a bit much for me. I am glad to have had it, but I am not in any hurry for more."
"Hard to believe this came in a can. Very impressed with this one. This would make a good breakfast beer, if you did not have to go to work that day."
"Strong roasted barley and coffee flavors up front. Numbing herbal hop bitterness as well. Some dark fruits get lost among the intense bitterness and roasted malts/coffee. Aggressive alcohol bite and very warming. Lingering dark candy sugar and plum sweetness. Did I mention warming? Full-bodied with a thick, creamy feel."
"The body is big. Full palate for sure. A lot going on here but with the silkiness makes it easy to drink. A definite must for stout lovers."
"The taste starts with citrus bitter hops, then has a soft floural essence, with a sweet caramel feel that finishes again bitter hoppy dark chocolate syrupy mouthfeel. Decent imperial stout something I might visit again overall a bit sloppy and not what I expect from a great brewery like Oskar Blues."
"Like sludge. Gurgling sounds emanated from the can. I think there was a tire and a boot in there as well. Not really. Smells like caramel and molasses. Some chocolate and coffee in there too. Up front on the taste is those 98 IBUs, but they actually fit pretty well here. The alcohol taste is also a little prominent. Then there's the taste of roasted barley and chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is thick and appropriate, with low carbonation. This one's a slow sipper."
"Pours dark brown with a thick one finger head. Aroma of chocolate, oat, toffee, and hops. Huge bitterness. Flavor inititally of dark chocolate, but the hops quickly present, and the finish is seriously bitter. Great mouth feel. A really good, huge Imperial Stout. Note: I had a second tasting on 3/27 and let it breathe for a while (15-20 minutes). The bitterness still lasts, but all that chocolatey, malty goodness presented right up front and went along for the ride."
"Notes. I only drink one of these in a single session.Two would be over the top and ruin the first experience."
"Update June 1, 2009, the same beer sampled from a can. My notes would be almost the same but there is a molasses smell in the mix and I would rate the drinkability and mouthfeel a half-point higher as the astringency is not quite so dominant without sacrificing the full flavours. Again, a very long finish and the alcohol again is well handled. Cheers!"
"Lack of carbo hurts the smell-score, but I just can't bring myself to give it lower than a 4, on anything. Creosote, toffee, leather, briquettes, gear oil, and all other delicious dark liquids find their way into the flavor profile of this beer. It's just that complex."
"D: This is such a mixed bag ... it looks and feels great. It could smell great if it was more pronounced. The taste ... hard to say, but the alcohol burn is just too prominent to mark this very high. I plan to hold on to one or two cans to see what six months does to it."
"This may be the finest example in the style that I've ever sampled. I simply love this one."
"Pours incredibly black, with a slow-developing black-to-brown head that froths like a well-poured stout out of a nitro tap. The smell is powerfully woody and chocolaty and noticeable inches away from the glass. The taste is everything an Imperial Stout should should be - charred wood, bourbon, chocolate, raisins, coffee. It has a lingering bitter, smoky finish that clings to the tongue. The mouthfeel is amazing - rich, clingy, and luxurious. This is a beer to sip and enjoy over a long period. The beer's vast character, however, hurts its overall drinkability. Not everyone is going to want such a beer and even die-hard stout fans might find it too heavy under many circumstances."
"it is thick and coats the mouth with a velvety smoothness. very chocolatey, carmel flavors come out as well. alcohol slightly warms the throat. very smooth and drinkable for an IS."
"Drinkability: If you appreciate a solid RIS, this is a must drink. I wish it was readily available in my area. Finishing off my pint was like the end of a roller coaster ride - I was satisfied, relaxed, but mostly disappointed it was over and damn thankful I had the experience. This beer doesn't leave you wanting, just wanting more."
"Drinkability: 10% in a CAN?!? I'll down a sixer at my local. Sweet!"
"M/D - Full bodied and super smooth. Just a little carbonation. Very drinkable RIS."
"Huge roasted notes picked up immediately in the flavor: burnt coffee & cocoa. Resinous hoppy bite on the finish is balanced by a syrupy alcohol warmth. One of the better usage of hops you'll find in an RIS. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, creamy, uber-thick and well-carbonated. Lingering burnt malts and hops last a bit too long on the finish...I'm still tasting this beer fifteen minutes later. All in all, Oskar Blues delivers yet another enjoyable brew. The alcohol is noticable, but at 10%, I'm suprised that it doesn't detract from the experience. Definately worth seeking out again."
"Impressive, and very worthwhile. Not a lot of beers tating like this out of a can."
"D: High alcohol detection, overly thick oily feel leads this to lower ratings. I far favor the Storm King and may not just be my style here."
"What can you say about Ten Fidy that hasn't already be said. This beer pours like used motor oil, and is only ever recognizable as beer when the espresso colored head forms. The head clings to the sides of the glass, but never really sticks around. The aroma is big with it's notes of coffee and dark chocolates. The flavor certainly follows suit with the aroma, but the chocolate notes really seem to dominate the initial flavors. The mouthfeel is really deceiving as initially the beer goes down smooth, but leaves a sensation of the back of your throat being coated with syrup. This may sound unappealing but only adds to the experience with an intense after tast that hangs around for quite some time. This beer comes across as immensely drinkable, but with the high ABV. it is wise to refrain. Overall this beer deserves any hype that it may receive, and I am always on the look out for it. This beer has really opened my eyes to what an imperial stout can taste like, and has got me even more excited about whats next."
"If you like full body, super heavy roasted, smooth, creamy stouts overflowing with chocolate and roasted coffee and smoky goodness, perfectly blended with delicious juicy piny hops, stop reading this and go drink some of this right now. This is one of my favorites. I really wish they had this in NC. Each one I have, I like better than the last. The heavy roasted character, is a bit of a shock at first."
"D : It's a sipper but one I plan on getting more of to drink."
"The beer poured coal black with a good bit of light brown head that stayed throughout. The smell was of roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste was of toasted malt a little sweetness on the back end and bit of coffee mixed in. The feel was heavy and dry. This was a very nice drinkable RIS, very enjoyable, but I would have preferred a bit more sweetness."
"This is a very easy to drink, full flavored stout. It hides its 10% abv very well."
"Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors are easy to consume, however they are too strong to down in large quantities. A well crafted stout, and I love the canning idea."
"D: A definite ""occasional"" beer, and by ""occasional"" I mean on the occasions when I can find it. A slow sipper but a good one."
"D - I'm impressed. Quite smooth and drinkable."
"D- Wow! My first canned craft beer, and I have to say it was a good choice. This must have some great ingredients to have the smoothness, and blackness that it does. My only qualm was with the strengh of the smell, but even that was delicious. Highly reccomended."
"D - A great Imperial Stout so full and complex w/ a boozy spicey edge and a drinkable beer in relation to the style and excellent Imperial Stout in a can that you are encouraged to try"
"Anyhow, it pours up looking like Texas crude, black as night with a nice chocolate milk brown head. I chose my Duvel tulip for this one. The head is two-fingered and lasting, leaving good lacing behind. Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, black patent and chocolate malts, some vinous notes, a touch of espresso, and a hint of cashew or shelled pistachio. Really viscous at first sip, with a full-on roasty character, some astringency, floweriness and smokiness in the finish. Again, really thick, yet soft on the palate, slick on the tongue. A nice change of pace is that it's pretty hoppy, very bold for an IS. I was expecting a tinge of metallic taste from the can but I'm not really picking up on that, and there are just bonus points for said lack of metallic taste. I'm just amazed that some significant hops came through in this viscous mass of a stout. A very nice slow sipper."
"MF&D - A thick and creamy full bodied RIS. The alcohol warmth makes this one a sipper. Check it out if you can get it. The only drawback is it's a bit pricey$$$."
"deserves all the internet buzz :D"
"Overall, this is a solid RIS, but could be a bit better. Spinal Tap references aside, this could use a little less roasted malt. It simply tasted burnt. That being said, it is an impressive beer, and well worth picking up for $3 a can. I'll hold onto a couple of these for a year or two, and they should do quite well. Until then, this is just a little unbalanced. Oskar Blues usually does a great job of ""overdoing"" beers, but this is just a little too far to the burnt end of the spectrum."
"D: Very drinkable. Tastes great and is quite easy to drink considering ABV. Still can't believe this came out of a can. Don't know why, cans just have bad stigma. Oskar makes me a believer that a good beer is good beer no matter what it is poured out of."
"Can picked up at By the Bottle here in the 'Couve. Black,like 5,000 mile old oil. Tan head that never makes more than a cm or 2 of showing. Lots of nice aromas coming from my glass. Malt, roast, chocolate, all the Imperial Stout smells checked off the list. Really sweet beer, nicely held down with the hops and roast flavors keeping it from getting too chocolaty. Smooth to drink, just a bit of heat in the aftertaste belying it's 9.4% ABV. Really Good Beer. Best Motor Oil I've had in a while. Beats the hell out of Mowing the lawn this afternoon...thanks rain."
"make sure you let this one warm up good. i started too cold and a good bit ot taste was hidden. i'm adjusting my review. .5 as a result in that category."
"This is an incredible beer. Between this and Old Chub I can't help but put Oskar Blues toward the top of my favorite breweries."
"Luckily this can be found now and again in the NYC area, so I'll be sipping this again...but not too often since it's priced a bit over the top."
"Drinkability- Even with the great aftertaste, it doesn't quite reach the heights of Stone, Speedway or some of the other top notch RIS's I've had. Overall it's very good and definitely worthy of seeking out though. I wouldn't turn down one of these."
"D: Excellent brew but not as big and bold as I would have expected from a 10% ABV but perhaps that is due to the complexity of the ingredients."
"Drinkability: A really fine Imperial Stout, with plenty of complex flavors"
"Drinkability: Ten Fidy is definitely one of those sipping beers and one of those once in a while brews. It's far to overpowering to drink on a daily basis. Not a beginner beer! If you want some Ten Fidy, make sure your tastebuds are up to the challenge."
"Wow this is the first craft beer I've ever tried out of a can, it almost doesn't seem right seeing anything but clear yellow macro swill. Cracked this open with a pull top and watched this viscous black liquid pour into my oversized wine glass. Looked dark as hell with a rusty brown looking small head with a subtle aroma of coffee beans. Sweet dark chocolate taste and small amount of carbonation at first, followed by a surprising hoppyness, and finishing with dark coffee and left a lingering smoky taste in the mouth. By far the best beer I've had out of a can... ever!!!"
"Were it not for the persistent alcohol I would have rated it higher. I know this is partly what typifies the style but I wish it could have been covered up more."
"also, really tough to clean the glass afterwards - an intense beer!"
"drinkability: very nice, you want another sip but you probably wouldn't be able to drink a whole ton of these just because of how heavy they are. I really like it."
"This was the one beer I was looking forward to trying on my trip to denver. It only took me one stop at falling rock tap house, where they had one left for $5. Dark as oil and almost as thick. Nice tan head, almost too easy to consume to watch out! Alcohol is not noticeable, some raisins and plums. I have enjoyed better imperial stouts, but never in a can. Worth it."
"Altough a little over the top for me, this would be a must try if you're an Imperial Stout fan."
"D- pretty damn good,"
"Poured from can. This was black in color with very fine brown bubbles that dissipate quickly. The nose is quite hoppy with grapefruit clearly poking out along with dark chocolate. The grapefuit edge makes this very strange for me. There is more of the same in the mouth with the grapefruit, sour cherry and dark chocolate lingering to a bitter finish."
"Overall, the flavor profile and aroma are different than the average RIS. And for a 10% beer, it's pretty drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden. However, for such a big beer, I'd expect bigger flavor."
"D = This is a drinkable beer but with the ABV and the mixed tastes of RIS and IPA, I think this is one where I really have to be in the right mood."
"Poors black with a dark tan/light brown head. Coffee, malty and carbonic aroma. Smells a little soy saucy, like it's going to be super syrupy. Tastes very dry though. Lots of chocolate and coffee flavor, not too sweet. Very drinkable. The roasted malt is a little biting, but I could still drink it all night. I'm really glad I got to try this beer. If it were local, I'd stock it regularly."
"The first comparison that comes to my mind is Brooklyn's Black Chocolate stout. For the money I'd say I'd have to choose the Brooklyn version, but for a more definitive comparison I'd have to do a head to head taste test."
"Overall: A ""dessert"" beer that if given a little more finishing hops would be perfectly balanced. It's production probably explains the high price of grain right now!"
"Drinkability is hurt by the alcohol being too prevalent. Not really my thing unfortunately, but tasty enough"
"d - wow! unbelievable beer and i could go crazy with this one as it is so drinkable. but i'll have to ration the three i have left..."
"This is an incredible flavor rush. Very well balanced for a 10% abv. Just a little burnt for me but it is a strong contender."
"D= great for maybe 1 or 2, a definite must-try for beer affectionados."
"This is a great beer. I give it props for having a classic roasted malt profile. Those flavors are more prominent in this beer than in any other Imperial Stout I've had. The only thing keeping this from the very top of my list is a slight lack of complexity. The roasted malt flavors are great, but they're all this beer has to offer. It lacks some of the fruity character present in some of my favorite example of the style. Anyway, that's just a personal preference, and I'm really nitpicking at this point. Bottom line: if you like stouts, seek this one out. Highly recommended."
"One of the best stouts I have had. Near perfection in a can."
"Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with a bit of carbonation. Smooth all the way through."
"D: It's a pretty easy one, considering the ABV... the flavour can start to seem a little big after a while, but until that point, it's quite smooth and sexy."
"Ten FIDY is quite the beer. One can only chuckle at the thought of an RIS this tasty being canned. But, Oskar Blues has pulled it off and crafted an extremely fine beer. It's every bit as good as advertised and perhaps a little better."
"Mouthfeel is rich, dense and viscous. It coats the palate as it goes down and the oats lend a smooth creaminess to each sip. Mellow carbonation works well here too. Overall, this is a solid, tasty imperial stout, but there are still plenty of others I'd grab first. This just doesn't have the depth of flavor I normally enjoy in a rich imperial stout. Thanks to warriorsoul for the cans."
"A very solid RIS that's forcussed more on the ashen roasty end, but restrained enough so that it doesn't go overboard like The Abysss IMO. Very drinkable and accessable."
"Big huge sipper. A very worthy beer to put among the better impy stouts."
"Drinkability is still high here despite the 10% alcohol. mmm good."
"This is a really nice and drinkable beer. I would highly recommend it."
"Very happy to spot this one on tap at the local watering hole. I hope to see it again."
"If it's dark, earthy, and deeply brewed, it seems to be in here, like rich loam in a can. It's wickedly complex, it's deceptively well blended, and it can't help but inspire a warm smile with every eager sip. And speaking of warm, the ABV is present but still slightly subversive. Yet, it drinks especially well because it tastes so damned good, and feels awesome going down. For my money, it is well wirth the $3.50 a can it cost me, and I'll be buying it again, and gladly at that."
"I am impressed with this brew. Flavors are great and the mouthfeel is unearthly. If you can find this consider yourself lucky. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is huge and chewy yet soft, with the perfect amount of carbonation. A very drinkable RIS."
"This beer is amazing, so I'll just start off with that. Pours a motor oil pitch-black with a deep amber/brown head. Mediocre looking lacing that drips the whole way through. Looks excellent. Nose is all over the place. First off lots of roasted malt, then a crazy hit of drying hops. Loads of cookies, chocolate, and some swirling dried fruit. Light spiciness. Incredibly sweet and delicious. Flavor's a lot hoppier; tons of coffee, crazy roasted malt. Dried fruit, very light alcohol flavors that come on stronger as it warms. Body is thick, although a little thinner than some other RISs I've had. hen I don't care that it's 10% ABV. It's absolutely amazing. An exceptional brew, and one of the better RISs I've had. Love to try it on tap."
"Great beer!!!"
"Well, this is indeed a nice RIS, but it just doesn't meet the hype that surrounds it (and I'm not sure it even merits the retail price)."
"When you pour the beer I think to myself I've gotta take this back to the store, this oil is already used. Glossy black like ink. Head is three fingers of rocky chocolate colored head with great retention. Leaves lots of lace. Nose is just as big with smoked malt, toasted bread crust, and even a hint of black licorice and vanilla. A big bitter toassted malt feel coats the entire mouth on first sip. Dark burnt blackness really drives the palate of this brew. A bit of a nutty feel develops twords the end along with a bit of warm Belgium waffles dripped in molases. This Impy really does lack sweetness that would balance it out and score even better with me. It drinks best quite warm. Alchol is well hidden but warms the belly well. Mouthfeel is an ashey burnt bitter feel. Drinkabilty is very much a sipper like straight esspresso."
"D: Given the high ABV this brew is dangerous. Well balanced with alot of flavor. I would like to revisit this beer again but next time out of the can. Recommended."
"Drinkability: a totally satisfying RIS. Having this style available in a can is great. Easy to drink and enjoyable despite the high cost for it."
"Perhaps the best beer I have ever had out of a can."
"D: Remarkably drinkable for something this big & bitter."
"Drinkability - definitely a pleasure for an impy lover, will have more, and will recommend"
"Updated. After drinking 4 more over the last 2 months, I have become more and more impressed."
"Pours a nice brown/tan head that fall immediately leaving behind no lacing, but this super black color with brown/chocolate edges. The smell is very coffee roasty. Taste is sweet and roasty with a good bitter aftertaste that makes me think of a hoppy bitterness which may be. Very drinkable with a great smooth mouthfeel that's heavy on the tongue. I enjoyed this fine brew. Thanks Ave for the trade."
"I definitely wowed some friends pouring this amazing beer from a can. Pours motor oil black with a thick, mocha colored head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Taste is very similar with a majority coming from the chocolate and roasted malt taste and then a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is very thick and expected of an RIS. The alcohol is hidden very well in the smell and taste for a 10%ABV beer thus it is pretty drinkable but I can't see having more than a couple in a session."
"Mouthfeel is massive yet smooth, and the drinkability is pretty good consider the high alcohol and the huge flavors."
"D-A great representation of an imperial stout. Of course everyone knows its from a can, but I don't really care. I love Gordons and Dales, and this one is no exception. This is the best way to enjoy an imperial stout after a 10 mile hike to your campsite."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkeable. RIS are generally not that drinkable by nature (1-max), but this one is very...very smooth. Find yourself a case of this stuff to stash away...and don't be fooled by the cans."
"I recommend sharing this, as 12 oz seems way too much."
"Poured a thick dark black color, with a creamy deep brown head that settled very quickly. Smell is a combination of roasted smell of chocolate, malt, some woodsy aroma as well. Taste is a bit stronger of roasted coffee, cocoa, vanilla, tobacco, even a faint ""peat"" flavor. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth all at the same time. A very good, flavorful HIGHLY drinkable RIS. Fans of the style won't be disappointed. The 10% abv is well hidden in this one, so be careful drinking more than 1 or 2."
"A solid RIS from Oskar Blues and a decent deal at around $3 a can for what you get. It's not quite up there with some other top ones in the style but the uniqueness of a RIS out of a can has to earn it some brownie points too right?"
"D: not the strongest RIS I've had, but definitely up there, a sipper in a can"
"d: Ten Fidy is to impy stout fans what an absolute hop-bomb is to a hop-head. Big, delicious and flavorful, but a bit one-dimensional. Not much to decipher, but plenty to enjoy. If ever there was a sessionable impy stout, this is it."
"(raisins, figs), and a little alcohol is noticable. Big oily mouthfeel. An impressive bitterness actually shines through. Dark candied fruit is buried by the roasted malts and high AA hops. Nice and burned, almost smokey. Aftertaste is burned and the bitterness really starts to grows. Booziness also in the aftertaste. A huge, superb beer that live up to its hype. An absolute must."
"Drinkability is high because while it is somewhat bitter, the alcohol is hardly noticeable, which is odd for a 10%."
"This is a very robust RIS that probably tops them all in terms of bitterness and mouthfeel. The can seems to be a perfect fit for this one. The glass just seems to ""designer", too classy, too delicate for this beer. It was a bit of a search for this one, but I feel it was worth it. It dumps the malts on you with still allowing for the hops to join in. After all that, there is still room for dry fruit and chocolate to add to the complexity. After reviewing 522 beers, some better than others, this one finally wins a perfect score from me. If you ever run into the brewers at the Oksar Blues grill, tell them Chris said, ""Thanks."""
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, pretty filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a good stout to drink for a while until you get too full, but I think it's very over-hyped. There are definitely other RIS's out there that I like better."
"Overall, good, but not as good as I hoped. Still, it's the best beer-from-a-can I've ever had."
"A tasty addition to the ranks of those beers of the style I've managed to drink. This would make an excellent nightcap. Still, after sampling it, I think I prefer the Abyss. This is certainly no slouch, however, and I'm glad I've got three more for later consumption."
"I used to think that Oscar Blues brewed the best canned beer in the universe... until Surly Furious, Bender and CynicAle came along. Ten FIDY, however, can stand toe-to-toe with some of the best RISs out there. Since Surly Darkness will most likely never see the inside of a can, this brew seems destined to be the finest canned Russian Imperial stout the planet Earth has ever known."
"A flavorful, robust Imperial Stout. Slightly young and rough around the edges, but some very promising flavors. I wonder how long you can 'cellar' a can for."
"D- As good as any other RIS. Heavy body does not allow quick consumption and frankly, you'd probably die if you were to pound it. Glad to have one more in the fidge."
"Poured the black liquid vigorously into a Duvel Tulip (thick enough that it didn't splash at all!) creating a deep brown thick, creamy head. Black body that light has no chance getting through. Awesome aromas of chocolate, coffee and tobacco. Flavor is wonderful! I had no idea this was almost 100 IBU because there was SO much malt. Incredible! Mouth feel was thick like cough syrup and hid the alcohol surprisingly well. A damn good beer that I wish I had while it was -20 degrees outside. Hopefully it cellars until next winter."
"WOW. I hate it's taken so long for me to have one of these beauties. I'm so glad I have 7 more to enjoy. It looks like the thickest of used motor oil as it comes out of the can. Into the glass, a thin dark tan head forms then quickly disappears. The smell is sweet and burnt. Hitting the tongue, you experience sweet alcohol, dark coffee and sweet, dry chocolate. I would love to be able to drink this every night but I don't want to spoil this treat."
"The black and silver can cracks open, emitting very little carbonation. I proceeded to pour it into a snifter (how often are cans poured into snifters I ask), releasing the jet black liquid with a creamy tan-brown head. The head holds nicely leaving beautiful lace. The smell if full of roasted espresso with slightly burnt notes, figs, and alcohols. The taste is sweet up front. Coffee dominates giving way to bitter dark chocolate. A fruitiness lingers throughout. The body is full and creamy with subtle carbonation; fantastically smooth. This is a great imperial stout. The draw is only greater due to the can. The high amounts of roast and possibly hops impart a significant amount of bitterness to this beer, if it were a bit sweeter, it might be more drinkable, but regardless I would love to have this one again, and will certainly pick it up again in the future."
"Drinkability - I enjoy RIS offerings. If left on an island with only one style of beer, it would be an RIS. In my opinion, this is a good Russian Imperial Stout. I very much wanted to try it due to the reviews present on this site, and was glad I did. In my heart of hearts, I was expecting more. I purchased two four-packs to further review at a later time. I've heard it ages well."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy and lacks, in my opinion, the proper level of carbonation. This is coming from someone who prefers lower levels of carbonation for the style. Overall this beer is not bad and certainly above average, but not one of my top Russian Imperial Stouts. Overpriced for my tastes."
"(Mad props to goryshkewych for allowing me to try this bad boy.)"
"All in all this is a very tasty Stout and well worth trying should you cross paths with one. While there are hints to the potent nature of the alcohol in this brew, while drinking one it's hard to believe it is 10%..until you've managed to have a few."
"Oh - one more thing: if you live in a state where this is unavailable, happen to fall ass-backwards into a 4-pack, then share it with friends, you may regret it later."
"This one's for quality, not quantity. Sip, savor and enjoy in moderation."
"Good drinkability for such a high abv. Very rich and tasty - a work of brewing art!"
"D: Very drinkable and well balanced for a big stout."
"A good RIS the hoppiest I've ever had. Drinkable as a RIS can get, you better be sipping this at 10%.Not the best I've had but not the worst either .I would recommend it. Truly a hopheads RIS"
"Layman: Yeah, I can drink it! What am I queer?"
""
"This is a sipping stout by all means. All-in-all, a superb imperial stout."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer and very drinkable."
"Extremely excited to finally try this one out! Pourd from a can into a shaker pint. Pours out like good maple syrup, slow and steady. Produces a wonderful looking creamy tan/brown head that looks like you could float a quarter on. Smells of burnt malts, smoke and some vanilla light at the end. Taste is sharp for a syruppy beer. Nice chocolate and molasses flavor with a bite. Not my favorite style, but this one can grow on me. Beer mellows a bit as it warms- I think it took my 45 minutes to down this one. Great beer to sit by the fire with!"
"D:Very good. IT is like eating a big fat peice of rich chocolate cake."
"D: The alcohol, while well hidden starts to get on you by halfway through the second glass..."
"Drinkability: Cmplex flavor lowers the drinkabilityof this brew."
"All I can say is that if you're a fan of stouts like I am ..GET THIS BEER. I have had some brews from Oskar Blues before but this one is the crem dela crim..Chocolate roasted malts exceptional mouthfeel,over the top flavor it's all here. Pours a thick oil black without the soy sauce mouthfeel. Jumps to a finger to a finger and 1/2 chocolate beautiful head...Hmm all I can say is I want this to be a staple in my fridge for sure! Well I guess you can tell i like this offering..SOLID STOUT ALL THE WAY!"
"It's so wonderful I want everyone to try it, and yet, so wonderful I'm not sure I can bring myself to share these other 2 cans. Even my husband liked it."
"D- At 10% alcohol I wouldn't drink many, but the sweet, thickness of this beer would fill me before I had too awful many."
"3/23 - I'm still disappointed by the carbonation, but this sample turned away my doubts about delivering a 4.5 for taste. With a stronger pour, the head was of course bigger and it held a bit longer but it was gone after a third of the beer left the glass. Lacing however improved markedly. It could have been victim of a less-than-perfectly-clean glass. Appearance could be bumped up to a 4.0. Taste, feel and drinkability remained the same."
"D_This is a very tasty stout. The alcohol makes its presence known but doesnt detract too much from the overall appeal. Thanks go out to rblwthacoz for giving me the chance to sample this one."
"Overall, felt it was a bit hyped up though, as the taste was not as assertive as it could have been and didn't really go beyond some of the other RIS I've had, but the can doesn't lie, ""Half-Baked. Fully Roasted""."
"When this came in the delivery drivers put the Beer Advocate rating and information on the shelf with it. Very helpful, otherwise I would of never bought this beer. Dark, looks like oil coming out of the can, so said an onlooker. Taste is amazing, similar to some Stone Brewery beers, but much darker. Comes in a four pack and that will do the trick!!"
"Drinkability: An RIS to seek out, though don't if you can't handle it, because this thing's insane. This is the Arrogant Bastard of RIS, and I'm surprised they don't have a lengthy sermon on the can or website, because it deserves one. I picked up a 4-pack, and I have 2 cans left. I can't see the brew holding up for a while in the can, so those will probably see the light of day soon."
"My only gripe is the lame can. A beer as good as this should be in a wax-sealed 750, ready for a ten-year nap on it's side."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer and worth the hype. Hats off to OB."
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: Wow. This is quite a concoction. The ABV here will definitely catch up with you before long, so I don't know how many of these you could have in one sitting before becoming completely incapacitated. It's definitely a sipper, but quite exceptional for the style. Perfect for a cold winter night, or when you need to feel warm all over. The beer definitely has a ""sweet spot", however, as the last few sips of warmest beer couldn't stand up to the earlier, cooler draws. Definitely a keeper!"
"D - Execelent beer that I would love to have access to here in Texas but sadly is not so. First of the craft brews that I have had out of a can, and it did not disapoint. So smooth that the ABV might sneak up on you, but in the end who cares."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style. I think the deceptiveness of the hidden alcohol and it's smooth texture."
"Ten Fidy goes down smooth. Way smoother than I was thinking it would. The rich malty taste is complex and the high alcohol content is extremely well hidden. I'm glad I'm home for the night since I am sure its going to hit me when I least expect it."
"Good drinkability, but defiantly a big sipper that's more of a nightcap. Lacking somewhat in complexity, but has great straight-forward flavors. Very nice."
"Served into a tulip. Pours dark black with heavy, lingering tan head. Smells of coffee and maybe some dark chocolate. There's also some orange hiding in there as well. Taste starts with mild chocolate with coffee and smokey, roasted malts coming later. There's also a faint bit of cream. Very complex with a lot of bitterness at the end."
"12 oz can. The brew pours a sinister black color into my glass, leaving a slight coating of head over top of the brew. This beer is dark. No light was making it through the stream pouring out of the can. Wow. The aroma is ashy burnt roasted maltwith some sweet molasses notes and just a hint of chocolate. This one smells promising. The first sip brings a strong burnt malt backbone that moves to a light molasses sweetness, followed by a solid pine hop that brings notes of coffee to the party as it mingles with the burnt notes. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on my tongue well after swallowing the beer. I'm pretty impressed with this one. It pulls all the flavors together; I had it on draft and was not at all impressed, so this is a pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is very thick, with just a hint of carbonation. This certainly fits the brew. Overall, this brew delivers. I think the deepness of the burnt malt really works well with the hop profile of the brew to bring new flavors from the marriage that would not otherwise develop. Glad to have had this one."
"D. Except for the 10% abv I could drink this all day! A great RIS from Oskar blues!!!"
"Marvelous. I still have quite a bit left in my glass and plan to savor this one to the last drop."
"A nice take on the style, but far from my favorite. That being said, if you're an Old Rasputin fan, you just may go nuts for this beer."
"Overall I am pretty damned impressed by this beer. Personally it goes in my top 10 of all time."
"Overall impression: Wow - this is definitely going to be a staple for camping this summer. Amazing to get this quality of beer in a can, and it seems to be readily available on the shelves in Colorado now."
"pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head, smells like a floral chocolate milk, an inviting one anyway. nice thick mouth-feel, and a flavor of chocolate malt, minor hop flavor, and a hint of caramel. the scary thing about it, is it drinks like milk, skim milk, in other words far, far too easy for it's abv. wonderful brew don't pass it up."
"The beer pours motor oil black with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, black and chocolate malt scent that's bitter and roasted. Some hops sneak through the darkness. The taste is good. It has a very bitter, black malt and hop flavor. It's got a nice roasted character also, but the black malts prevail. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a FULL bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I have to say that it's a bit over-hyped. It's about as black as a beer gets. But where is the complexity? All in all, I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this one. Thanks JJ."
"drinkability - Pretty good beer, I would buy this again, seems like a hot little item."
"Again, I would love to have access to this beer. Very rich, filling, smooth, full and flavorful. Thanks again to RustyDiamond for the trade."
"D-Very nice but a bit too big to have many of. Glad to have had it on tap."
"Kudos to Oskar Blues for continuing to put out very good beers in my favorite vessel, the can."
"Pours a deep black color with a thick tan head that laces the glass all the way down. This beer smells of deep roasted malts and some hop bitterness and a little bit of alcohol. It tastes of sweet deep roasted malts but there is a slight burnt taste along with some hoppy bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is good - very thick rich and creamy. The drinkability is good as I could have more than one of these in a night."
"D - a yummy treat."
"Pretty much black with faint brown edges, looked pretty thick during the pour. Fine, dark brown foam that left some streaky lacing on the glass. Though there isn't a lot there, it had good head retention. Chocolate/toffee aroma, some licorice, roasty, with faint fruity hops. Spicy? Super malty with solid, balanced bitterness. Lots of bready malts, bittersweet chocolate, slightly burnt, with citrusy hops hiding in the middle and lingering with toffee in the finish. There's a dark, ripe fruit character hiding in there too. Roast was milder than expected, letting the richness of the malt stay in the forefront, but it did manage to fill out the finish. Delicious. Awesome mouthfeel. Thick and creamy, silky texture, fine carbonation. Chewy and very heavy. Luxurious. Wow. No hint of alcohol at all, making this an insanely drinkable (and dangerous) imperial stout. Highly recommended."
"What a mouthfeel. Thick and creamy with a juicy, dense, syrup feel. It's essentially like sipping extremely tasty, aromatic motor oil but with a slight fluffy feel in the finish. This is one to savor, especially on a chilly, snowy nigh like tonight."
"Pours pitch black, impenetrable to light. The beautiful head is what gets me right away. Nice thick mocha foam on top with incredible retention and great lace. My this smells good. Roasty and toasty. Just the way I like it. The taste on this is simply divine. Roasty toasty malts, nice coffee and chocolate flavors through the middle. followed by (IMO) the PERFECT amount of hop bitterness on the finish. This is one wonderful stout. The mouthfeel is flawlessly viscous and creamy. Drinkability cannot be beaten. I strongly recommend this stout to everyone. Anyone who doesn't think great beer can come out of a can, this beer will change your mind GUARANTEED!!!! (If you like impy stouts that is). Defenitely one of my favorite beers. This four pack is not going to last long. I'm going to Colorado. Honey! feed the dogs!"
"Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, viscous, moderate carbonation. Definitely not lacking in texture."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation is low but appropriate. The has a pleasant smooth oilyness. This is a dam fine RIS. I enjoyed the beer from the moment I poured it into the glass. Well played Oskar Blues."
"Overall: I don't know what it is yet, but I hope I get the chance to buy more. Just for kicks, I am going to guess what I think this one is before looking. Ok, I think it is the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout... Ok, I was way off. This one isn't nearly as intense. I forgot I had this one in the back of the fridge. Wow, what a great beer."
"a really good beer (really), recommended. it wasn't cheap, I would probably still default to Old Rasputin given availability/price but this one is worth seeking out if you like the style. I really enjoyed this beer and almost feel guilty for nit picking it's bad points. The bad points here are almost an afterthought really."
"This is quite the enjoyable RIS from Oskar Blues and perfect for a cold snowy night. I'll definitely have this one again when given the chance."
"Pours pitch black, completely opaque with a good size dirty brown head. The lacing is apparent throughout and a darker shade of brown. The smell is nutty with dark malts and some light chocolate and some spent coffee beans. The flavor is again heavy with the dark and chocolate malts, and the coffee is a bit more evident here. I catch the smallest hint of some bittering hops, but one of the things this beer dose well is hide the heat. I would think it was 8% if I diddnt know better. The carbonation is light. making the mouthfeel light for the style, and the drinkability is right up their fro the RIS. This is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had out of a can."
"D- Rich, but very smooth and tasty. Very impressive for the style. Not the best I have had, but thoroughly enjoyable."
"Poured into a snifter. Ten Fidy poured a deep black, like old motor oil, with a nice rich tan head that lingers for a little bit, with some light lacing. Aromas are of molasses, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, coffee and dark cocoa. Tastes are of coffee, rich chocolate, strong alcohol tons also linger. Some hop characteristics, but the malts just take over. Very complex. Mouthfeel smooth, creamy, and a little thick. Mild to low carbonation level. Outstanding stout, not a session beer by any means, but I could drink this consistently."
"I picked up a 4 pack and the other 3 will last me a long, long time. It's a bit like a really strong rauchbier in that respect; even though it's good you need it only on occasion."
"Served in a smallish goblet, presented a dark black color with a finger of dark chocolate brown foam. Lacing splotched all over the glass, and lasted for as long as I nursed this drink. Rich smell, which carried over into the flavor. Almost a little too bitter, but in a good way; I would compare it to a really well made espresso. Thick on the tongue with a full body. Not an everyday beer, but nice as a dessert. Quintessential stout."
"Thanks to shuajw for this one."
"Pours black as oil with a small brown head in a snifter. Oats, chocolate, cocoa powder and something creamy almost like peanut butter, in the nose. Taste was dry baking chocolate, bittersweet cocoa powder, some creamy oats, but drying. Body was thick, creamy and oily, yet quite drying in the finish making for a unique experience on the palate. Mild bitterness, alcohol was very well hidden, and a slight chalky aftertaste. A great roasty big beer all around."
"D: It was too rich and full-bodied to be a session drink, however, it is a great one and out brew worthy of repeated sampling."
"A sipper to be sure...one I must have more of. With just a bit more of the dark fruit coming through here I'd be tempted to give this a 5 for taste. Excellent and highly recommended!"
"The level of carbonation was not great either. Just a thick, cloudy, syrupy mess. I would not have this beer again, and I would definitely not suggest this beer to anyone."
"Some how I missed this at the Extreme Beer Fest this year, so I had to pick it up. It pours an inky black, completely opaque when held up to the light. There is a nice deep brown head that lingers leaving a dirty looking lacing down the glass. The aroma is dominated by deep chocolate and roasted malt, with just a hint of caramel. The flavor is just a bit sweet with tons more dark and black malts. There is some hop bitterness but its hard to differentiate from the astringency from the dark malts. The carbonation is light but fine for the style. This is all around a great imperial stout and a good deal too."
"All good. Black with very little dark reddish areas under light. Thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, hops and alcohol in good balance. Combined it produces a licorice smell that I get in my more preferred Imperial stouts. Flavor is a repeat of the aroma which is good - I love when beer tastes as good as it smells (when it smells good that is). Full body that is at the same time easy going in the drinkability dept. Roasty finish with a dash of coffee, chocolate and hops. Yes yes ya'll, very nice."
"D - A nice sloooow sipper, but a brew that keeps you coming back. Great after dinner drink. Good for relaxing on a cold night as well."
"D: This is delicious. I could drink them all day. The flavor profile is so strong however one as someone that is not a fan of coffee may get tired of the taste."
"More traditional in style and much different than others I have tried of late."
"This stuff is really worth trying if you find it. I could drink it for breakfast, but its great after dinner. It is very intense, so if you prefer beer that is easy on the palette, beware."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but not bananas, like this beer. Still a bit more roasty then I'd prefer, which seems to hinder it's depth, but still very nice and enjoyable. Worth seeking out, particularly for the novelty of such a big beer in a can being so good (e.g. once it's poured you'll never be able to tell it was canned)."
"D: A rich, delicious treat that makes you wish you could have more. Case worthy for future enjoyment."
"Overall: I have had this several times now and each time it has just gotten better and better. The first time I had it was 2 days after canning and it was very bitter and phenolic, almost like eating powdered aspirin. That was a one time taste as it has now become one of my favorite Imperial Stouts."
"Moderate to low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel but not too bubbly, not a great deal of body. This is a tasty beer and pretty drinkable, but IMO it's being elevated a bit by the hype it's been generating."
"This is definitely a premium imperial stout. I could drink this as often as I could get it...though I guess I would get pretty smashed doing so."
"D: I feel the alcohol after 1/4 pint! Only one for me. An eminently enjoyable beer though."
"D - did this really pour from a can? I have to get over that. This was a quite pleasant beer and I'd definitely have it again."
"Not bad at all but I may have had my expectations a little to high for this beer based upon word of mouth. Nice and very smooth what it lacks it that extra layer of complexity that the best Russian Imperial Stouts posses. Still this is a good beer and no doubt the best RIS in a can."
"M/D: Big, full bodied, extremely velvety on the tongue. Drinkability only hampered by the big ABV. This one is very, very smooth and extremely tasty. Bring this baby to NC!"
"Pours, well black as hell, completely opaque, with a solid quarter inch of dirty brown head, and some nice tracing. Gorgeous so far. Aroma's are not as strong as expected: cocoa, roasted coffee, black patent, creamy bourbon (if there was such a thing), and quite a bit of citrusy hops. On the palate, the roasted barley tumbles the tongue, chocolate malts develop finishing with some high alcohols and those west coast hops. It finishes almost minty and vodka like. Incredibly chewy in the mouth with moderate carbonation and heavy mouthfeel. Very refreshing after recently having Storm King and Black Bear stouts finding them just way too hoppy. Hops here are quite evident but very balanced. Not much bitterness from the malts, I imagine a low percent of black and roasted malts, making it very smooth. This is a very enjoyable RIS from a brewery who has such a solid lineup."
"Big thanks to Dev (BuckeyeSox) for this can. I poured it into a standard pint glass, and admired it's looks for a while. Honestly this is one of the most appetizing looking beers, dark dark brown with a thick frothy foam colored like chocolate milk. Really good lacing on the glass too. The aroma is roasted malt, very rich smelling. The flavor is roasty with just a touch of sweetness, and quite a bit of bitterness in the after-taste. The mouthfeel is thick, giving a nice match to the rich flavor. I recommend this beer, but the only drawback is that I'd prefer a little less burnt bitterness in the taste."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Many of the Imperial Stouts out there are very sweet, which is ok, but this one is dry enough to session, if you can handle the booze. It brings a flavor that is hard to get tired of and I would recommend it to all that are unafraid of dark beer."
"Drinkability is just great. Glad this came to Massachusetts so I could buy a bunch of it and drink it regularly, instead of having to trade for it. Down with rare beers--this is a great one. But rare beers aren't reviewed by the macro-swilling masses, so this one's overall rating is being pulled down by people who don't like imperial stouts. Food pairing: Ten Fidy would go great with a glazed doughnut!"
"this is a lot smoother than a lot of other russian imperials; it does not have a huge hop presence, and there is not an abundance of flavor that might make you feel full; it doesn't have that huge pallet coating that keeps the taste of the beer fresh in your mind for hours and it isn't out of this worldly alcoholic. and yet, for each of those categories it's easy to envision a beer that fits the description. with this one? it's from a can. sometimes its good to be average. right?"
"This was a very nice brew overall, but it just didn't live up to the hype that has been built around it. I was expecting to try something that would rank amongst the best beer I've ever had, which is always difficult to live up to for any beer and for anyone. Instead, I got a rock-solid excellent example of the style that just couldn't get to that tip-top level for me. Needless to say, this is a no brainer to try, should you be able to find it."
"D: At 10% this is a whopper. One can is more than enough at one sitting."
"i've read lots of hype about this beer over the last few months. it lived up to it, excellent example of the style! need more..."
"D: Super easy drinking like anything else in a can. Took my time with this one and really enjoyed it."
"M&D - for a highish ABV and a big and bold coffee flavor, this beer is very smooth, silky smooth, and easily drinkable, well done, this beer is worth the hype, makes me wish i hit this up at the EBF first, damn, maybe next year"
"D - oh wow Ten Fidy is amazing! Oskar Blues have made one hell of a beer! It's smooth and creamy and delicious. Definitely very warming due to the ABV. Obviously you wouldn't want to just kick back and drink these nonstop (though there was one rather fun night at the pub when I had several in a row hehe), but this truly is something special IMO. Highly, highly recommended on tap or in the can!"
"I think this stout gives old rasputin a run for it's money"
"Quite good. Quite good."
"Overall- 1 of the best beers you'll ever have from the can, and 1 of the best RIS out there! A few of these smuggled in your backback on an overnighter would make the end of a long hike even more enjoyable!"
"The notes say this beer is retired, but it can still be found in Western, MA at Table & Vine"
"Poured a dark, thick black with a one-finger dark mocha head. Very thick and hearty. Head slowly dissipated and left some heavy lacing. The smell was not as strong as I had expected but my wife was sitting next to me and she said it was potent. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee with a hint of sweetness. The taste starts out with very bitter, burnt chocolate flavors but slowly leads to a creamy, sweet milk chocolate. The bitterness is strong at first but slowly fades as you make it through the glass. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy but still not a sipper. Overall a great RIS but not to be over indulged. Have a can left so I think I'll hang onto it and see if it mellows out any."
"Pours black as night, brown head, very rich looking, tons of lace, nice legs as well, head settles to a thick layer. Smell is wicked, roast, chocolate, toffee, coffee, dark fruits, vanilla, biscuits, wood, alcohol, excellent. Taste is just as good, thick roastiness, chocolate, toffee, biscuits, vanilla, dark fruits and dates, alcohol but well hidden, solid roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with silky low carbonation, way too easy to drink. Fantastic Impy Stout, one of my favourites. Thanks Marc!"
"D: High ABV but chocolate flavor makes it easy to drink."
"A 5 year old can, my last one. My notes above are accurate in terms of flavors, but not for feel. Despite a fullness, there's a lightness/wateriness interspersed with the thicker, chewier finish. Pretty solid. 4/4/4/4/4"
"As a side note, I've heard that this beer was created combinig ultra-premium ice cream, and Whoppers malted-milkballs..."
"Wow, for a ten percent beer it has great drinkability. If it's in such short supply I've got to get back to the store from which I purchased it and purchase as much as they'll let me have. Yes I did like it. The pour at first gives no indication of the head that will first endear you to this interesting rendition of an imperial stout. The pour at first seems to produce no head to speak of with a pour so slow and with a viscosity to mirror that your heaviest of black gold (choose what weight of oil you will), in the end from the gathering of bubbles in the glass appears a thick medimum brown head (a good half inch in a conventional pint glass). The head allow for the perfect lace to form on the glass with each sip. The head does however disapate into a fine brown ring a each sip bring you closer to the bottom of the glass. The nose is of alcohol and deeply roasted grain. The taste is a wonderful roast and, chocolate flavor with an aftertaste who lingering roasted nutty flavor sits on the back of your tongue wishing for more. While I did detect a slight alcohol nose the drinkability is not impaired by the 10% ABV, yes that the scary part I could have turned this into a sessions beer very easily. Oh! Yea one after another. Yes it has the ability to make you forget that you are drinking a 10% ABV beer and visiting the far side of the moon. While some high gravity brews of late I've not found worth their weight in gold (and yes you will pay your weight in gold of this one). In my opinion this is by far the best yet from the little brewery from Lyons."
"I have heard that this beer is available in very limited supply. My local liquor store has quite a few 4packs on the shelf and with a price tag of almost 13$ it doesnt look like it will be moving very fast. I grabbed a 4 pack the other night and I have to admit I am very glad I did. Ten Fidy is easily one of the darkest, thickest beers I have ever seen. It almost looked like I was pouring used motor oil from the can. A nice dark copper colored head formed after a few seconds. Overall I give this beer a 9.5 everythign was perfect from the color aroma and taste. Get this beer while it lasts!"
"It is very drinkable if you are looking for a meal in a glass, this is by no means a light russian imp."
"Pours a deep, dark impenetrable black, that strongly resembles used motor oil, with about a 1/4"" of sturdy dark brown head that exhibits decent retention. Aroma is very restrained, good but noting too out of the ordinary. Roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and some dark fruits are present with just a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is much like the aroma. At first I am hit by a sticky sweetness which is followed by the arrival of roasted malts and, towards the finish, some dark chocolate and hop bitterness. The dark fruits don't appear until after the bitterness. In the late finish I get some alcohol, not hot or overwhelming, but noticeable. Mouthfeel is ok, it was a bit too thin IMO. This brew is medium, maybe medium-full, in body and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, there was a nice alcohol warmth (a good thing) but overall I just wasn't that impressed. Its a solid brew and one that I'll revisit (since I have a few more cans) in the hope that tonight was just a bad night for FIDY."
" Mentality. Worth a Try!"
"Often when searching out elusive beer, the result tends to be disappointing. Ten FIDY lives up to expectations, and then some. This is a seasonal brew from Oskar Blues, with an unknown availability. Luckily it is brand new in the area, and there should be enough supply, at least for now. Don't let this one be your white whale, cast off the bow lines and sail over to the store and pick up as much of this as you can get your hands on. This is definitely one of the best beers I have had this year."
"D - I wish I had more, so that must mean the drinkability is pretty high, right?"
"The mouthfeel is like liquid silk, and although it displayed a serious head, the carbonation is low and it goes down very smooth. Very drinkable despite the high abv. I haven't been this excited about a RIS in a long while. Get this if you can! No pun intended."
"This beer pours a slightly viscus black. The pour was absolutely incredible. The thickness of the beer took minuets to disapate. Which worked good in the long run because I enjoyed the malts even more as the beer wormed to room temp.Intimidating at first glance, but opens up nicely as reaches room temp, and becomes very inviting. Up front on the taste is a bold burnt malt taste which follows the beer down. Just when you think the beer is done, the alcohol comes back on the finish with reckless abandon, with a hint of hops. Great beer for those cold months."
"A good dark , complex brew to sip on a cold Feb. evening with snow falling outside and the UCONN women beating someone's ass on the tube."
"drinkability is fairly good, but the burnt bitterness takes it's toll. this beer would do well in a 4 or 5 oz serving after dinner type setting."
"im surprised to see that this beer is retired i just picked it up a few weeks ago"
"This is my first review so bare with me. The color is a black like motor oil with a nice baige head. The head was not very tall but leaves a nice lacing in the glass.I am a fan of R.I.S style beers and this one is high on my charts.The can looks like it should be in a corner store somewhere next to the colt 45 but thats one thing I like about it. I would recommend this R.I.S to anyone"
"OK. If you have a chance to try this, don't pass it up. And if you work for Oskar Blues: For crying out loud, tell someone to bring this back next winter, willya?"
"Pours like motor oil, a thick, pitch black with about 1/2 of creamy chocolate milk colored head, good long lasting retention and great full coating lacing. Smells big of coffee and chocolate, with some hops and a hint of alcohol. Tastes like an espresso with lots of roasted malt character that gradually changes into a nice chocolate shake. A smokey and hopped finish with a slight alcohol heat. Full bodied, low in carbonation, smooth and creamy with a nice bite. One excellent RIS, big in coffee and chocolate and very thick, hides the ABV nicely. Glad the folks at Oskar Blues decided to can it this year, hope they continue to do so."
"Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability despite the high ABV. Drinkability seems to get better as the beer warms. Overall pretty good, but different RIS. Lives up to the hype in my opinion."
"@13.99 a 4 pack."
"Retired? Bummer I thought this was going to be an annual thing. Anyway..Jet black with a beautiful dark tan head on top. Simply a great looking beer. Deep roasted aroma. Very grainy flavored. Heavy, heavy dark chocolate. Heavy roasted and somewhat burnt taste. High level of hops in here. Very complex flavorwise. Not overly full in the mouthfeel. Quite smooth and creamy. Very dry in the finish. Almost too much at once. I cant see having a lot of this in one sitting. Great beer but in moderation for sure."
"Ten Fidy isn't awfully drinkable, but then it's a 10% Russian Stout. In a can. A can I say! Goodness. Perhaps the most intense beer to ever see the inside of an aluminum cage, Ten Fidy is something you should seek out and release. I also proclaim this the ultimate cold weather camping beer."
"A jet black beer. Has a thick foamy dark brown head with some lace. The aroma starts with a solid grapefruit hop character with notes of licorice and chocolate in the background. A roasted malt bittersweet chocolate character covers your tongue. On the finish there is a hint of coffee just before a double snap of piney the citrusy hops wash down the back of you throat. Didn't really capture me as an imperial stout. But tasty none the less."
"I've had a handful of Imperial Stouts in my beer drinking career...and this is my favorite so far."
"D - Overall it's a very drinkable brew for one a night I think...it's high ABV certainly makes it something you don't want to try all night"
"This was good stuff. Sorry to see it retired."
"D - Obviously not a session beer, but a bit hard to drink even for a 10% ABV stout. The aroma is very nice, but the overwhelming malt bitterness in the taste is a bit out of proportion despite the heavy body and residual sweetness. A very complex and interesting beer, but a bit over the top on roast character, in my opinion."
"Beer shared with Dave Blanchard at the Brick Store Pub. On-tap aged for a year firken. Good mouthfeel and much lace and dark het black. Rich coffee and chocolate, roast and great bitterness in the background well balanced by the other tastes. Half worth the trip to Atlanta."
"D- This one works best as a slow sipper, but the taste is such that I want to sip over and over again, even once the beer is finished. The high ABV is very obvious but the flavors shine through nonetheless, making this a very drinkable brew. Enjoy this one warm; it is phenomenal, and to do otherwise would be a waste of such a fine brew."
"I would definitely recommend this beer to be sampled around 50°F / 10°C as this allows the roast to be well mellowed & integrated; as it warms up towards 60°F / 15°C it becomes a touch more harsh, though still quite tasty. While this brew is has an amped up roast character, it never becomes overwhelming; the sweet malt base is able to hold it in check and allows the mellower dark malt notes of chocolate, roast fruit and woody coffee notes to come through quite well. This is much more engaging and interesting than my first experience with this brew. A really nice sipping brew and a perfect way to end the night."
"Although I'm a bit fan of RIS's with dessert, I think this one is best by itself. I couldn't have more than two in a sitting, but this is a very well balanced and enjoyable beer."
"jet black with a coffee with cream colored head that holds very well and leaves some serious lace. i was expecting the mother of all noses after reading some of the other reviews, but i was a little let down to find that the nose was a little subdued. georgeous, nonetheless, it exhibits some smoky malt scent as well as some caramel and sweetened creamy coffee. to me, the taste was a fairly complex mix of smoky caramelly malt followed by a sharp espresso like finish with some super bittersweet dark chocolate and maybe some fruit in the middle, as well as some earthiness for good measure. nice medium-full mouthfeel, although i was hoping for full-full. i had no problem knocking a few back, and i still feel like a few more, but i took some points off the drinkability because i know that high abv and seriously bitter/coffee bitter/smoky/roasty doesn't appeal to most. by far the best ris i've ever had from a can, and definitely a great stout."
"I'm not sure all the hype surrounding this beer is warranted. I've had PLENTY of better imperial stouts."
"The reference to pouring oil isn't too far off. Really dark with a huge foamy dark tan head that resists fading, leaving a nice amount of lacing in its wake. I thought the smell was reserved at first, but the aroma is nice. A kind of creamy RIS without all of the sharp edges. Lightly roasted creamy maltiness. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated, medium bodied and again quite creamy. The flavor is quite good also. Not a lot of sharp flavored edges from the ingredients. Funny, how I was thinking how easy this is to drink! Then the ten little fidos sank their teeth into me. I also noticed that the bottom of the can smelled more like alcohol too. The last couple of drops seemed to warm the chest. An interesting complexity worth considering. Highly recommended."
"The pour of Ten Fidy, the long awaited Oscar Blues Imperial Stout, started out like a can of motor oil. The body was pitch black, and the head was small, brown, and short lived. The smell was burnt and smoky and full of coffee that has thickened due to having the pot left on the burner for too long. Some bakers chocolate in the smell as well. The taste was a full on roast fest. The bitter, acrid, and astringent taste was much closer to a American Double Stout the the sweet and prune like flavors I typically see in a Russian Imperial Stout. Not too many hops, but the dried up body didn't need many anyway. Quite soft and oily on the palette, and avoided the harshness than some of the style sometimes display. Quite warming, but otherwise not flaunting the high ABV. I'd love to pour this for a Guinness loving friend to expand his horizons."
"This expensive stout pours a pitch black color with a modest tan head that softly lingers around glass for a while. The nose has a big dark coffee/cappachino aroma mixed with wet bark woodsy twang. The taste hits strong with rich chocolate and coffee that fades into a l.t soy sauce finish. The final aftertaste is a whisper of nutty, salty dry finish. The alcohol is noticable but well intergrated in the mix. I've had the ten Fidy with fresh cherries on tap.This plain version was a nice way to experience the dark roast coffee flavor!"
"well-carbonated I expected a little more thickness. Maybe that's just me."
"Overall- I have read and heard the hype, and I must say that this beer is worth every bit of it! Very nice representation of the style and one of my top beers I have ever had. I love it and it is great!"
" This is my kinda brew, Bad-ass brew in a 12 oz can."
"Wonderful and a true pleasure to drink and discover."
"From the can, this beer pours extremely thick and basically opaque, with a small, very dark tan head. Relatively little on the nose aside from roasted malts, a splash of chocolate and vague milky-sweet smells. On the palate, however, things get more interesting. Very smooth, with a quick rush of hop bitterness and raw alcohol, alongside plenty of roasted malts and a bit of caramelized flavors. There's a bit of spiciness in the background, but little in the way of fruitiness or other esters. It's a rather straightforward beer. This isn't to say it's mediocre; quite to the contrary. While the malts are relatively straightforward, they strike no wrong notes, and instead envelope the tongue with rich, really huge, malt flavors that are perfectly balanced by hops. It's an uncomplex but satisfying, comforting and hugely enjoyable beer. Very well done."
"D: Given the 10% ABV & the massive charred finish, it's not as drinkable as other monster stouts, yet it's still an amazing representation of style and well worth seeking out."
"Pours a... good lord this is dark... Completely opaque. Some of the darkest brown bubbles in the head I have ever seen. Smell is of blackstrap molasses, cookie dough, and a hint of charcoal. Creamy mouthfeel. Great meld of flavors that were in the nose, with none really standing out too much until the finish. A touch of hops gives way to 70%+ dark chocolate and charcoal. Never thought I would describe a charcoal flavor or finish in a good way, but here it is. Great beer, and one of the best imp. stouts out there."
"This is an outstanding beer from a brewery that has done nothing but impress me since I had my first Dale's Pale Ale."
"Drove to Marty's in Newton Mass to grab a four pack of this stuff today. Have had it twice on tap so far, but never out of the can. Liquid comes spilling forth from the can a pitch black, with a lovely big brown head. It almost looks like the can is spewing this stuff from its mouth. Smell has traces of roasted coffee, earth tones, and a bit of fudge. Flavor is dominated by the roasted coffee, with lots of dark chocolate bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is slick and thick on the palate. This one seems harsh at first from all the bitterness, but becomes more easy to drink with each sip. All in all, I wouldn't say this is one the top IMP stouts I have had, but certainly enjoyable, and interesting for a number of reasons (the fact that its a can being one of them). Good job to Oscar Blues."
"D. Masks the alcohol with the best of them... never would think that you're drinking a 10%er"
"Pours like motor oil out of the can. Dark tan/brown head. Nose is malts and coffee, but nothing crazy. Flavor is amazing. Thick and robust. Loads of coffee tones married with malts. Noticeable alcohol. Feel has a decent liquid feel and a good level of carbonation. Nice. Very nice. And gee. I have 22 left of this case. Whatever shall I do."
"I am very impressed by this beer. I love Oskar Blues. Now I can take amazing beer with me to the golf course, pool, or beach! I think more brewers should consider using cans because they offer many benefits for storage and convenience."
"Pours a solid black that doesn't let any light through. Has a creamy, fluffy light brown head that laces itself onto the glass on the way down. Aromas of bitter chocolate and spicey hops. Tastes of coffee, chocolate right up front, then some hop bite then a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. Creamy full mouthfeel. Great Imp Stout."
"Overall a great beer, and VERY drinkable for a stout. The 10% was very well hidden. I can confidently say its one of the best stouts i've tried to date, and its out of a can! Now my problem is getting more of it!"
"Overall, an outstanding brew. This beer is just as good out of a can as it is on tap. Another great beer from Oskar Blues."
"Thanks Dan . Again ."
"Served in a standard pint glass (thanks msubulldog25). Can opened with a slight spurt that my dog Sonny was happy to lick up off the adjacent couch. Poured an extremely dark brown with red highlights noticeable when backlit during the pour. Only way I knew it was brown was by looking at the liquid immediately below the rim of foam. Quarter-inch coffee-colored head quickly dissipated into a murky skim of light brown beer algae; plentiful sticky lacing throughout the tasting. Tremendous aromas of chocolate and malt. First sip was truly a beautiful experience. Sweet and chocolatey with a hint of coffee. Silky smooth, full mouthfeel culminated in a slightly astringent alcohol finish, while the fading memory of chocolate and malt lingered until the next sip. My only regret is that I didn't save this one for my 100th review. Outstanding imperial stout."
"D: In no way is this offensive, but it will catch up to ya, quickly that alcohol is a sneaky devil. I'd limit it at one to actually enjoy it, two would be pushing it. Very good brew though!"
"Drinkability/Notes: Definitely one of the better Impy Stouts I've had in a long while. The malts play a balancing act between fruity and chocolatey sweetness and dark roasted bitterness with the hops playing the encore in the finish with a big dose of hop bitterness. Dangerously drinkable at 10% abv. Fantastic in the mouth with a very good aroma profile. The best beer I've had in a can for sure, but also one of the best Impy Stouts I've had regardless of serving vessel. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it. Thankfully Oskar Blues will be distributing this beyond Colorado in the near future. Seek and Enjoy."
"Ten Fidy is a solid Imperial Stout from the guys over at Oskar Blues. They know how to make good beer and this is no exception."
"Overall: I reaalllly liked this beer. Nice straightforward flavors that are big and bold like I like them. Add in the touch of hops and you have a masterpiece. Younger35 sent me two others that got lost in the ABYSS between here and Idaho. I would give my left hand to have them right now. There is hope on the horizon, as I have heard that OB is going to start canning this one full time. If they do the availability will make this the #1 RIS in America for those not so long cold winter days here in Florida, at least in my book ;)"
"If I could get this all the time, it would be my go to RIS. Nothing else to this point measures up. It is following a Victory Storm King and seems to be in a class by itself."
"Highly recommended. Definitely one of the better imperial stouts."
"Between this and Surly Furious, I have a whole new respect for beers in cans."
"Pours a deep black color, very nice carbonation, huge two finger creamy tan head, which leave some awesome sticky lacing. The nose is big on malts, toffee, chocolate, nice slight vanilla, and caramel. The taste is absolutly delicious, malty/toffee/chocolate, nice little bit of sweetness, and some caramel. The alcohol is hidden extremely well, could drink a few of these easy. Full-Medium body, a well rounded brew. Very drinkable, very smooth, this is an exceptional brew, highly recommended."
"drinkable?: it sure is. this is why i drinkablem, cause of beers like this."
"D- Love this! Could drink this all night until I fell over! If I could only find it here."
"This balance makes Ten FIDY quite drinkable and a damn good RIS. Gotta love getting a quality brew from a can."
"D: I do love my Imperial Stouts and this surprised me in that I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. The hype here may be justified, but my personal experience = less than 'wow'. Besides that gorgeous appearance, this fell somewhere in the middle for other categories. Fortunately I have another one to try...scoring adjustments will be made, if warranted..."
"Overall I really thought this was pretty good. Now I will admit I have had better stouts, but I would say this was still more then decent and really showed off what this brewery can do. I would have to say it is more then deserving of its high ranking and is a nice contrast to a lot of the sweeter stouts I have had as of late. A solid effort and a really nice example definitely go out and get this one."
"Edit: Why and the hell can I get Ten Fidy and Gordon (both wood aged) on tap yet not get a can of either in Boise? Distributors aren't giving Boise the credit it deserves ... we ""should"" be able to get them.. damn it."
"Md-thick body and creamy smooth silky mouthfeel. Alcohol helps clean the palette. Needs a bit of time for the alcohol sting to settle and the dark grain flavors to blend. Great cellaring potential."
"Thanks again, John, for including this in our trade!"
"It was worth it."
"I thought this beer was very good, and quite easy to drink for a heavy stout. It wasn't amazing in it's complexity but it doesn't really have to be. I like the fact that it wasn't too cloying or alcoholic. I would love some more of this, too bad that was my only can..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown (almost purply black) head above the opaque black brew. Head hangs on, with average lace, which actually is pretty good for the style. Aroma is surprisingly minimal, but what is present is the expected dark maltiness with ample hops. Taste starts with sweet darkness, but quickly goes almost acrid bitter, in a good way, then giving way to sharp hoppiness, and closing with gradual warmth. Mouthfeel smooth and creamy, but the acridness does hamper things a bit, and drinkability reflects the same, but still very good overall. I'm really being picky here, but that's just me. Regardless, way kudos for Oskar Blues for continuing to be on the cutting edge on putting new style in the can."
"Thanks to tayner for including this in a trade!"
"Mouthfeel is not as creamy or full bodied as I had hoped. Some dryness. Very good stout that comes in a can. If you see it on-tap don't pass it up. If someone offers you a can, take it. You won't be disappointed. Another fabulous job by Oskar Blues."
"D: Not a bad RIS. Not sure if it lives up to the hype or not."
"What an amazing looking brew. Complete onyx black with not a single bit of light making its way through. Huge 2.5 finger dark brown thick head with lots of crazy bubbles on top. I have a feeling it's gonna take a while before the head on this one dies down. Stickiness is all over the place on the sides, holds on like molasses. Perfect looking brew, can't say much else. On to the nose. Big chocolate malt and toasted oat up front, almost like an Oatmeal Stout, that's a huge plus in my books. Scents of molasses, brown sugar, roasted barley, caramel malt, and a hint of wheat bread appear as well. Not nearly as smokey as I thought it would be, but my god is this a good smelling beer. Ok, time to take a sip of this monster. First taste I get is smoked almonds, and I love it. Roasted barley and chocolate malt slide over the tongue midway through. French roast coffee flavors in the aftertaste with a hint of charred wood. There is a tiny bit of alcohol on the tongue, but for 10% abv, I'm not complaining. Mouthfeel is huge and creamy with an almost non-existant carbonation. Wow, this beer is incredible. I have two cans left, one I have to age and the other I'm sure I'll drink pretty soon. I'll have to drink the Dark Lord soon to see how they compare. Thanks again Dan, I can't thank you enough for this treat."
"All in all, it's marginally worth $13 for four of these: that's $3.25 apiece. If you haven't had any and can find it, get some."
"The aromas and flavors this beer has from a can are just phenomenal."
"Poured a 12oz can into a chalice. Poured an India Ink black with a dark brown 2 inch head. Smell is of dark chocolate, molasses and roasted espresso beans. Taste is bakers chocolate, burnt coffee beans, alcohol, and a surprising bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is heavy, full bodied. This beer is definitely a slow sipper."
"Drinkability: This one is a beast to tackle. It is quite tasty, but I don't think it is as good as some people seem to tout. A better aroma, perhaps with a bit of dark fruit would put this one closer to perfection. Certainly worth obtaining, but not at all costs. I have another can that I will sit on to see if it hatches in a few years."
"The drinkability is good. Not a bad impy stout but i am not sure this can lived up to the hype. Prosit MK"
"First beer from Oskar Blues and it was amazing, I think it grea that they have been canning all their beers for over five years now, cannot get over how a beer in a can tastes so good, yes this one was better than the two Surly beers I had in a can this past year, the best canned beer yet, I could not recommend this premium beer any more, do whatever you can to get one and you will not be sorry, now if only I can try the bourbon aged version of this"
"Very solid imperial stout."
"This brew is amazing. Whats so amazing about it? Well first off it comes from a 12 oz can. Hmmm, I at one time thought all beer from a can wasn't worth the time it took to open it. Secondly, this brew is so full of coffee, chocolate, and hazel nut. The mouthfeel is full and heavy. I would love to grab more of these! Its extremely drinkable and tasty."
"This is a heavy beer, and very fitting of the RIS style. I can understand where the high rating comes from, but i doubt i will be seeking this one out again, one try was enough for me at this point."
"Thanks to Jay23 for sharing some of this!"
"Poured like a can of motor oil into a snifter. Little carbonation with the 1/4 inch brown head quickly dissipating. Aromas of freshly baked bread, soft notes of caramel, vanilla & toffee. Taste...wow. What a concoction of so many different tastes- espresso, dried fruit, bittersweet cocoa, strong hops. I found the flavor to start sweet, then to roasty, then big hoppy finish. Enjoyed the hell out of this can!"
"This was much better than the can I had the other week. If you luck & find this on tap, enjoy!"
"D - I'm happy I have more in the fridge, but I think I'll have to savor them for a later date. I will cherish this beer. Besides, with an ABV of 10.00%, by the time I got half way thru the 2nd can I wouldn't be enjoying the beer anymore. It's worth the experience and enjoy the ride!"
"This one glugs, glugs, glugs out of the can a dark ruby/obsidian black with a nice small tan head of foam. Aromas are run-of-the-mill imperial stout with no real stand out aromas to mention. Dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, maybe a bit of toffee or caramel in the malt backbone. Anyways. This is a ncie smooth, yet big and bold imperial stout. A bit more raw and less refined than I usually like them, but than again it is nice in it's own way. The mouthfeel is thick and coating and the drinkability is good, but not the best because honestly this has all been done before. Stilll, for a canned imperial stout, this is pretty damn good !"
"Drinkability- Well for having a 10% ABV, Id say this bad boy is about as drinkable as its going to get. I dont remember it being this thick but damn, it is! This is definitely a sipping brew meant to be slowly enjoyed. Thanks again to Domingo for this fantastic treat!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced and enjoyable. the alcohol is hidden well. this one feels just a bit overly bitter and slightly disjoint, but i can definitely see it mellowing and meshing together with time."
"Overall, another solid offering from OB. I suspect this one may develop a little more character and complexity as it ages, and I plan to stash a few away to test that theory."
"This might be one of the thickest beers Ive ever drank. When I opened it out of the can I almost thought it was flat and then a dark brown head formed. It had that raw coffee smell with a little of black liquorish mixed in. It drank like a chocolate malt. It taste like dark chocolate and a little hazelnut to it. I m not sure how it would age in a can, but this would be great sitting it down for about 2 years. It was the best beer Ive ever had in a can, period."
"EDIT: Recent cannings of this have been much more aligned to my personal tastes. The most recent I had (#4, canned in 12/08) was unbelievably malty and the roastiness had been toned down to work as a balancing element. It was every bit as good as any other RIS on the market. Another new wrinkle is that the price has been dropped to $8 for a 4-pack. That's essentially the same price as offerings from Stone, Great Divide, Founders, etc. Ten Fidy has gone from being good to wonderful, but I'll keep my original scores up there just for reference."
"Pours a thick motor oil black as night color that slowly seeps out of the can. Virtually no head is present on this one at first. However, with every swirl of the glass brings a reddish, brown tinted head. Once this one warmed up I could smell some Molasses, and sugar with some strong roasted coffee scent. Honey and toffee are also present. Delicious rich, dark coffee flavor that is intially sweet, then a heavy bitter finish lingers on the tongue. No trace of alcohol on this one with a creamy soft carbonated finish."
"On another note, the use of cans by Surly and Oskar Blues is pure genius. Cans prevent spoiling from light, are durable, portable, crushable and more environmentally friendly than bottles. Glass was first manufactured in 3000 BC, support the canning revolution."
"Drinkability- Oh my god yes! I could drink this baby all day. Sadly, this just wasn't meant to be, but Ten Fidy, I will always fondly remember the times we had. The opening, the smelling, the drinking. I hope we can have those days again. But now you are gone. And I will have to live with that until our paths cross again. Or your burbon aged sister comes over to visit."
"Exceptional beer experience."
"D- I think this is a great beer. I would try finding this again and thank you to Franksnbeans for this in a great thank you package."
"Can. Poured a murky dark brown/black color with a medium brown head. Strong lacing. Strong aroma of dark, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is awesome. Flavor is rich and roasted-malty. Strong aftertaste of coffee. This is an amazing beer. Glad I got my hands on some."
"A nice winter sipper on a cool night, very welcome and inviting."
"Very good beer all around. For some reason, the first few drinks were phenomenal and after that, the flavors started to get a little muddled. Not quite on the level of the ""elite"" Impy stouts (ie Dark Lord, The Abyss, KY Breakfast, Speedway), but not far behind. Well worth seeking a can or two of this out."
"The body isn't as heavy as it sounds but it's still on the heavier side. This is a great beer and I'm glad they finally decided to can it."
"Very bitter tannic coffee notes on the finish, which I will add is quite long. Again very roasty in flavor which actually seems to drown out many of the flavors. Some anise and burnt caramel, with a hint of dark chocolate. Thick, creamy rich delectable mouthfeel. Smokey and earthy and huge. A beer that I think could use some time, but how will time in a can deter the aging process?"
"Looks just awesome glugging out like pitch black motor oil out of a can. Big chocolate milk head that goes absolutely nowhere. Smells very roasty, little chocolate and coffee. Taste is huge on roast, coffee grounds and a hint of chocolate. Perfect bitter finish. A little thin in the mouth making this feel almost like a porter. Insane drinkability, I dont see how this is 10% ABV. A must try."
"Many thanks to xmarcnolanx for trading this to me. It's surprisingly fun to watch a jet black and oily beer with a mega huge brown head pour from a can. Truly. Ten Fiddy's appearance is nearly unbeatable. Carbonation is relatively light but the head remains an inch or more thick for several minutes before coming to rest at about a 1/4 inch. Aroma is deeply roasted with faint cherry and vanilla notes. Caramel malt is also present in the aroma but coffee and chocolate are both mysteriously absent. The flavor changes things up a bit as that intense roasted malt character leans towards coffee. I emphasize leans because coffee character in this beer is subtle at best. Chocolate too is minimal if present at all in the taste. Again , however, cherry is quite pronounced with some vanilla as well. Creamy is an understatement as to mouthfeel. As stated, carbonation level is low, and the bubbles that are around just seem to roll of the tongue. Nice bitterness in the finish. Extremely smooth, creamy, and luscious. Not as depthful as I would like and lacking a couple of those key RIS atributes, but...this is still a wonderful beer. It's so easy to drink, looks and feels great, and taste pretty decent. If this becomes available around here I could see picking up a 4-pack with some regularity."
" Nose is heavily roasted malts, sweet and sugary, with bits of cocoa. Taste is a heavy fire-burnt malts implosion, some sweet dark chocolate, and alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is great; very full and foamy. Drinkability is about average; this one is a sipper. Definitely recommended for those of you who love a toasted malt-bomb of a beer."
"Doesn't seem like much has changed with being aged 2 years, the aroma and flavors certainly mellowed out and I really liked the aroma, but I think this one is still going strong."
"Got a can from a friend who bought one of the last cases from the brewery. I was exited. Love the silver can with the simple one color black print. Smelled like cappuccino and chocolate hiding behind fresh cream. Tasted the same but the first aftertaste was home-brewed coffee that had been sitting in the pot all day. Final thoughts - burnt buttered popcorn that you can't stop eating."
"Overall, an excellent impy stout. It was even better on tap though."
"I have had this beer exactly one time before which was on tap at the brewpub. This is straight from the new can which is mostly black and silver, Raiders colors, not fucking cool. The beer really looks like oil pouring from the can. The head was dark brown and the beer was obviously pitch black. The smell is excellent, roasty dark chocolates maybe a coffee bean as well and powdered cocoa. The taste is very nice, oaty for some reason, burnt, the smell is the best part. This stuff is definitely strong but i can not get over how good it smells. Buy this when you see it."
"Amazing beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability was moderate. While this beer was quite good in some aspects, I found the combination of deep, charred roastiness, alcohol sharpness and intense hoppiness to be quite overwhelming."
"Overall a very tasty RIS. The complex flavor profile masked the large ABV."
"Originally reviewed on March 21, 2007. On draft at the brewpub and from a fresh growler. Nice somber cherry and wicking Cascade aroma, over creamy pine malt. Lots of dusky hops present in the aroma. Pour is a weird milky brown soap, with the darkest brown heap Ive ever seen! Flavor is a sweep of mid-roasted malts, lots of nuts, toasted caramels, sweet orange candies and fat almonds. Mingling of dry malt and high hops works surprisingly well. Palate and smack are most impressive. A smooth, quenchable pour, with nice attenuation and astounding drinakbility amongst a deftly concealed 9.4%. Dry, yet fulfilling smack, with quafs of light crisp piney grass over an effervescent nut oil character. Pecan skins and cherry pits lingering in the higher alcohols that rise to the nostrils. Well-balanced, however somewhat middle-of-the-road, somehow. It doesnt have a singular, unique character, aside from its entire build, that makes it a unique Imperial Stout. However, its beautifully built and brewed and certainly the most drinkable of ANY Imperial Stout. This strays from the classic sippers of the style to a near sessionable big beer. Mightly delicious."
"Excellent beer. Very faithful to style. I would certainly like to drink this again, but not something you would do in quantity. A ""dessert beer""."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with anise, roasted nuts, and bitter coffee swirling around the palate."
"Draught @ the Boulder Strong Ale Fest. Pours pitch black like every good Imperial Stout should. Extremely dark head, which rocks. Awesome nose. Complex flavor, extremely malty and satisfying, with big flavors of chocolate, roast and coffee. Hoppy as well, especially on the finish. A fantastic brew."
"This one is great. Got Fidy?"
"I don't want to rate this beer perfect, but I can't mark it down in any of the categories in good conscience. At $8 for 12 ounces that is a bit steep, but I'll gladly pay for a couple of snifters full to revisit this gem every winter."
"On tap at the Hop Devil Grill in NYC, this large and tasty RIS poured an enticing shade of oily black with a forceful looking dark tan head, leaving behind messy lacing. Nose of dark grains and strong coffee. Soft in the mouth, overload of flavors, more coffee, dark burnt grains, rich,complex, heady brew, well worth a try if you are lucky enough to see in your area."
"Drinkability: Occasional, This is a perfect example of a Russian Imperial Stout! Thus being such a bold beer, I would expect to enjoy this on special occasions or weekend trips to the pub! Another great beer by Dale and crew!"
"The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy. Just what I like in an RIS. I could definitely have had more than one of these with the exception that I was there for lunch. Excellent beer and one of the best RIS I have tried. Worth seeking out!"
"Thanks to pugman for sending this my way. Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Appears a pitch black color with three full fingers of dark brown dense foam. Moderate lacing is left on the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of sweet cocoa, vanilla, alcohol and fruity notes. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, roasted coffee, and bitter citrus peel. Finish is bone dry and bitter with a medium alcohol burn on the tongue and throat. Full bodied and rich with medium to moderate carbonation. This was a really good beer , although it was on the hot side. I'd love to see how this does with a year or two of aging."
"Finally got to the Brick Store to try this and was blown away by this beer. Incredibly thick brown head and jet black appearance. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, smoke, oak aromas. Mouthfeel was very nice with a soft carbonation. Very thick with no alcohol taste, very long finish. I think this is the best impy stout I've ever had!!"
"The taste was marvelous. I definately would make a special trip back to enjoy another glass!"
"This review is from a counter pressure filled hand bottled sample. Thanks pugman for the opportunity."
"Overall: It was a pleasant RIS and is in line with Bell's Expedition and others in its overall profile."
"Super easy to put down, hardly any alcohol hints. Superb flavor and mouthfeel. Really good stuff. I've been really impressed with Oskar Blues bigger beers outside of their two normal mainstays."
"Thanks to Jeff at Fathead's for getting this one to the Burgh, only four 1/2 barrels but damn that's good enough for me. 3 went to Fathead's and 1 made it's way to Mad Mex Robinson keep your eyes peeled. I love the name and it happened to remind me of one of my favorite imperial stouts from Southern Tier their IS from the long long ago Blackwater Series. Appearance is opaque literally black eats all light with a two fingered sized dark moccha tan head leaving behind fine lacing unevenly around the glass. Aroma is full of deep dark chocolate mild butterscotch undertones, cocoa, and an espresso coffee barrage. Other subtle notes found were some soft edges a touch of vanilla and oat grains maybe some molassess and the herbal pine hop bite definitely expresses itself with a bang. The flavor brings huge hop bitterness among waves of dark roast espresso bursts, dark chocolate, herbal pine hop flavors and succulently sweet butterscotch, molasses, and oatmeal with vanilla notes. Huge impy stout worthy of any hype this low distributed beer may bring, I hope it makes it on the canning line. Mouthfeel is huge engulfs the palate even slow chugging carbonation barely can handle all this malt with a sticky mildly chewy character about it also noted were some streaks of hop oils. Drinkability was amazing I savored every drop definitely a conversation sipping beer complex and tasty, I want some more of this stuff, damn."
"D - extremely tasty RIS. Wish it were made more frequently and distributed in bottles."
"Drinkability: This is one outrageously flavorful, exceedingly well done brew. Almost too much fun for one beer. Fantastic work, Oskar Blues!"
"I'm not an expert on imperial stouts, but this one was incredible. I only hope I can enjoy this one again sometime."
"This is the first truly great beer Ive had in a long while. Ive had a couple that were worthy of a 4 or so in my scale, but most not even worth that. This is a truly pitch black liquid. The head looks like a dark chocolate milk cloud floating on the coal dark sea of beer on this one. I lean in for a sniff and am greeted with loads of chocolate, toffee, and espresso over a lurking bit of grapefruit hops. I take a sip and am shocked not by the flavor, which was precisely what the aroma had suggested, but by the mouthfeel, which was more like whole milk or a thin chocolate malt than a beer. A truly creamy mouthfeel, yet this wasnt cloyingly sweet. This was heaven."
