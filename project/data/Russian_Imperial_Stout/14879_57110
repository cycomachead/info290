Then a sweet note of glazed toffee, fudge and molasses gets mixed with the bready flavors, while fluffy cream is still providing a smooth mouthfeel. The finish then is defined by coffee and warming caramel, standing in perfect balance to each other, while the beer seems to be quite aggressivly hopped, as a recognizable dryness appears from the coffee, providing a gentle bitterness. Concludes with an interessting aftertaste, formed my cream and earthy, slightly slick coffee.","aleigator","Feb 15, 2015"

I have to say I've had this beer with various ages on it and they are all delicious. This is a very drinkable beer that I would recommend sharing with friends, but a bomber could by consumed by a beer lover on their own. It has all the intangibles of any great RIS.

Looks like motor oil when poured, but it does have a quick brown 1 finger head that lasts like 10 seconds...brown lacing remains. Huuge roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and dried fruit aroma but its very crisp. Taste is bitter sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts with a somewhat high hop character - especially for an older bottle. Its slightly oxidized raison flavor is really nice. Its very dry, viscous, thick, oily, and heavy - but strangely drinkable. Well worth having this brew...its pretty fantastic.","DrinkSlurm","Dec 29, 2013"

This particular bottle though was excellent. The pour into the glass was thick and black. The smell was of huge malts, chocolate and dark fruits. I assume a fresh bottle would have more roasted malt and hop presence but I don't know that for sure. The taste was incredibly tasteful and complex. If this beer was this good a year in, it seems to me that it would be a great candidate for aging. Hoppin' Frog beers sometimes seem a little too pricey for me but after having this offering tonight, I am starting to think that the price is worth it.","mjpolzin","Dec 24, 2013"

Aroma is boozy, sweet and roasty with dark fruit and floral notes. Gets sweeter and boozier as it warms. Upfront it tastes very sweet, boozy, dried cherries followed by lingering roasty/coffee flavors with dark chocolate, burnt sugars, toffee, and herbal/citrus notes. Gets sweeter as it warms and the roast flavors mellow a bit. Medium viscous, coating mouthfeel but not as heavy as some other RIS. Overall a solid RIS, the roast can be a little astringent at times, especially when cold. Very good and should age well, some oxidation and time to mellow should do the brew well. Will definitely drink this one again.","jreindl","Jul 22, 2013"

Aromas of biscuit, dark baker's chocolate, coffee, toasted grains, a hint of smoke, and some earthy/woody tones. Booze hints on the nose, also. Flavors are extremely rich, with a base of dark, bitter baker's chocolate and a hint of bitter, roasted coffee. Ribbons of earthy and woody tones throughout, with a vanilla and molasses highlight, also. Very reach and smoothly blended. There is some bitter hopping that cleans the palate nicely at the end, which is an impressive feat given how rich and robust everything is. Roasted grain highlights show through every once in a while, too, which also helps to balance the rich and dark flavors. The aftertaste is rich chocolate and molasses, with a touch of smoke and bitter hops. Slick, smooth finish with a rich, robust linger that coats the palate and the mouth. Very strong, but surprisingly drinkable. This beer definitely opens up as it warms. Wow.","GarthDanielson","Jun 11, 2013"

Nearly full-bodied, hop bitterness prevents it from being too smooth, but overall, it's quite good.","Rifugium","Dec 15, 2012"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, char, roasted malt, toffee, caramel, coffee, molasses, herbal, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance, complexity, and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted malt, coffee, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, char, toast, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; with nearly zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Very rich and robust. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Unexpected, and I wasn't entirely sure I wanted it in there, but it does add another facet and gives it a signature, which is good if you're looking for something unique.

There was a some lactic acid sourness in the middle. The aftertaste was long, and very roasty.

A near-brown one finger head tops this brew but quickly dissipates to form a ring surrounding the inside of the glass. A strong aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, grain, with chocolate and toffee notes rises from the darkness in the glass. Dark fruit dominates the taste up front which gives way to roasted malt with some bitterness, finally finishes fairly smooth with chocolate and toffee notes. Heavy syrupy body which coats the mouth, low carbonation. Really fantastic RIS. Very balanced and very complex. Hoppin Frog sure knows how to put together some darn good stouts.

Appearance is jet black with a nice light brown head, minimal, but present. Smell is big on coffee and chocolate, I also get a lot more booze in the nose (at 10.5%, I would think so.) Not sure if this is supposed to have the same oatmeal character as B.O.R.I.S. but I get a hint of it. BIG chocolate in the taste, more so than the coffee. Robust, thick, and full, I'm into it. Mouthfeel is syrupy, thick, and all around what I would expect from a big stout such as this. Overall, it's a great imperial, not sure if a whole bottle to myself is the best idea, it's rather filling. I'd say it was worth the $14 I paid for it.

This is an instant favorite. Poured aggressively at room temperature into my trusty Guinness pint glass. This could easily be shared by many, but fuck everyone else, this one's mine. This pouted blackhole black. This fucker was perfectly opaque. The head was the darkest I've ever seen. I got a good 4" of head at the top of the pint glass so I could get the best aromatics possible. This screams dessert beer. However, I've put down dessert long before dinner was done on many occasions. This will only ensure that trend continues. This is smooth as silk. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but I like that, especially since this one has a decent alcohol presence. I could sip or pound this. Very versatile. Strangely, I have a bottle of B.O.R.I.S, but I went this route first. I'm waiting for my Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S. to arrive so I can line all three up for a comparison. This is a must have for any stout fanatic. I found these for about $9 a bottle. I've heard talk about this being high priced, and I might be in the minority, but I disagree.

Chocolate, coffee, and molasses jump out of the gate right away. Dark fruit steps up midway through. Charred coffee, a bit of ash, a touch of alcohol and hop bitterness linger on the palette long after each sip. Insanely thick body with a creamy motor oil mouth coating. Light level of carbonation.

The first sip is all dark chocolate. It also has mild coffee and dark fruit notes, it has enought hops to keep it from being overly sweet.

It's past roasted into burnt, and normally that wouldn't work, but it really does. A bit of alcohol late in the finish. A lot of RISs I have had feature some sweet currant flavors rather prominently, but this doesn't. The most surprising taste really is the burnt finish, but I'm digging it.","McNealc31","Feb 02, 2011"

The taste holds a surprising amount of hops, with some heavy pine, flower, and greens piercing the dark backdrop, which itself is composed of pretzels, dark chocolate, and light roasted malts. Honestly, the hoppiness really takes hold, and the stout-like qualities are overshadowed and buried. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick, chewy feel. Overall, I did not care all that much for this one. The hoppiness took away from what could've been a great stout and kept me from really wanting to finish my portion of the bottle.","TMoney2591","Nov 13, 2010"

Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, silky smooth and had only the lightest touch of carbonation. A really great RIS. Maybe not quite as good as BA or regular B.O.R.I.S, but well worth a try.

It is nearly pitchblack with a cocoa head. It tastes like dark chocolate with a hint of coffee with a creamy aftertaste. I love imperial stouts and had no idea what to expect from a Double Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout but needless to say this is excellent. Its sad that I have never tried anything from this brewery before yet they are only a couple hours away from me. That frog just had me doubting them. I have always heard good things about Boris but never got around to paying ten dollars for a bottle from a brewery I had never heard of but this is beauty at its finest.","beerhan","Jun 02, 2010"

My only critique, albeit a minor one, would be a tad more burnt flavors. That would be nit-picking, though. This beer lost no luster as I drank it; I actually found myself more intrigued by it with each passing sip. For me, this is in the top-tier of the style.

A touch of roasted malt and coffee. Yay, something there I was expecting finally, but really late on the finish and could just be my brain associating the scorched malt bitterness with roast. I got a couple to age so I hope it ages better than it tastes fresh at least. I can see why it only got an A-.

Also, the hop flavor is stronger in the taste (compared to the light hops in the aroma). This is a good and mostly bitter stout. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy, rich, coating, and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, but this is definitely a sipping brew.
