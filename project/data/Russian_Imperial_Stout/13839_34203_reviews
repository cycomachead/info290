"O: Overall a great beer to have during the holiday and the winter months, well balanced and flavorful, thoroughly enjoyed this one."

"Overall: A passable imperial stout at a good price. Definitely prefer the ""fresher"" version though. Cellaring this for ~1yr didn't improve it. [3.5]"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Molasses, mint, vanilla, what more do I need to say?"
""
"Overall well worth the 8-9 dollars a bottle and should have picked up a second. Ow well their is always next year!"

"Pours brilliant dark brown with an exuberant 3” tan head that persists and leaves heavy lace. The nose is prune to plum with coffee and a hint of chocolate in the background. The beer is clean and the bubbles are so fine that they suggest a nitro beer. A very effervescent, creamy palate starts malty with a dark, nutty biscuit background coupled with big grain flavors seasoned with chocolate and coffee finishing with a dry bitter chocolate astringency joined with grain on the finish. Big body with very fine, soft carbonation."
""
""
"Overall - A fine brew, though personally I prefer a bit more roast and depth in my impy stouts. That said, this thing is as smooth as Sammy Jackson and should not be overlooked as one of the many other gimmicky holiday brews with catchy names and labels; this one's the real deal!"

"Dark brown and opaque with a two-finger head of rocky foam that lingers long. Aroma of dark malt, caramel, cocoa and coffee. Deep, rich flavors of darkly kilned malt, not to roasty or bitter, but very flavorful, with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, licorice, root beer, and charred bark. Subtle hop flavors and bitterness balance it well.  Full mouthfeel, a bit tingly.  Nice beer."

"While not a particularly enthusiastic fan of the style, drinking this has turned into an annual tradition each Xmas Eve.  Slightly sweet but not overpowering... alcohol is also manageable.  Not bad."
"Very tasty with great mouthfeel. Enjoyable."
""
""
"O- two years of age has mellowed this beer out amazingly, with big dark chocolate and cherry flavors, very good RIS!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  yum.  Balanced well.  Great beer."
""
""
""
"12/15...from the bomber. Pours dark black with high tan foam, thick and creamy, loads of lacing. Rich roasted nose, vanilla notes. Hearty thick dark malt taste, heavy bitter. Thick mouthfeel, real filling, like a milkshake. Smooth and bitter. 10.5 packs a wallop."
"(If I understand this series correctly, there's the oak aged version, and the whiskey/bourbon barrel aged version; I believe I have now had both, and this is the former.  There is possibly an un-aged version, as well.)"
""
""
""
"2012 bottle. Very smooth. Surprisingly foamy."
""
""
"Also looking forward to trying this year's barrel aged version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer. Good pour, good smell. Roasted cocoa and coffee."

"T/MF: Quite smooth (though, not as smooth as Pecan Pie Porter). Grassy roasted coffee flavor dominates, with a touch of char and graphite on the end. A spike of sweetness going into the finish. Slight dry cocoa note on the frontside of the finish. Cocoa, char, and graphite hold at a medium intensity for a good while. Not bad. I look forward to the barrel-aged version. This beer seems like a good foundation for it."

"A beautiful black beer that smells of roasted malt, licorice and hints of chocolate. Taste is similar but there's are much bolder hop presence than you expect with a Russian Imperial Stout. Somewhat medium-bodied for an RIS and more carbonated as well. A different take on the style. Might work for some but not really my kind of stout."
""
""
""
"Outstanding"

""

"o; Cellaring does not seem to have hurt this powerful brew.  Bitterness builds somewhat and the high ABV becomes more evident early on.  But it's a helluva holiday beverage which packs a big flavor, hop and alcohol wallup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost black color, with an inch plus foam.  Very Foamy!  Caramel and coffee notes."

"Overall - It pushes the line of too one-dimensional on the roasted malt flavor, but it still works."
""
""
"The non-barrel aged version is a lot smoother and very drinkable. Solid, not too demanding take on imperial stouts. The bourbon one is a lot sluttier, the oak is (too) heavy and goes down a lot slower. The age in barrels didn't make it better IMO."

"O: Worth a try and a decent beer. Of the RIS I've had some have been better, this is right in the middle of the pack"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:it seems that you really need to let this beer warm up as the complexion in the beer become stronger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant but flawed imperial stout that has complex aromas and taste. The saltiness was too much in my opinion and took away from my overall enjoyment."
""
"O: I'd previously tried the bourbon-barrel aged version of this twice - which I thought wasn't too shabby - but having tried this, I can see that the base beer itself seems to lack refinement and/or distinction"
""
""
"Overall a good beer, but one enjoyed much more as it warms. The booziness resides and the beer becomes more expressive."
""
""
"Overall- Very good beer. The flavors really come out as the beer warms, very drinkable despite the high abv."
"Notes: What an imperial stout should be; a slap in the face."
""
""
""
""
"Delivered in all its burnt umber opacity in a conical pint glass from the tap at Monk's Cafe. A thin, tight, dark tan head caps it, leaving a fetching, persistent coating on the glass as it recedes in succeeding circles with each sip. The taste is surprisingly free of cloying sweetness: full-bodied, but almost sprightly compared with what I was expecting. Further analysis reveals a backbone of bitter baking chocolate, moderated by dark bread notes. A mature, subtly bitter aftertaste rounds it out. Pillowy mouthfeel. A delight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a jet black with a slight oil and dank characteristic with a slight tan head out of a 22oz bottle. Smells of malts, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is chewy (in a good way) with flavors of dark chocolate, espresso, toffee, and toffee. This is a full bodied beer with a lot of dankness to the mouthfeel. This was a really enjoyable brew almost a slight twist of older viscosity (a personal favorite), am definitly going to try to grab another bottle before I head back east."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich, oily jet black with a frothy mocha head. Strong nose of leather, anise, burnt caramel, baking chocolate. Flavors of licorice, sweet espresso, and molasses. This is a very smooth and tasty RIS, almost like an American Brown on steroids. Would drink again!"

"Santa's Little Helper....is a big beer and one bottle will be enough to help anyone pass the time with in-laws! The beer poured a opaque black with big foamy tan head that is lacing like a naughty Ms. Klaus. The scent is a typical of most stouts....roasty with touches of coffee. The taste is a warmer fo shizzle. There is a strong roast quality with hints of espresso and perhaps chocolate....the abv...numbs the pallet. The mouthfeel is full bodies and big carbonation....which I think is affecting the taste somewhat....perhaps a tinge overprimed. Overall this is a winter warmer sipping by the fire beer. No way one can session this bad boy."

"O - I really enjoyed this beer. Nice holiday RIS. Not a RIS I would seek outside of the holidays but for the season I really enjoyed it as a change of pace."

"Overall a good stout but nothing I would seek out again. The flavors just seem to battle eachother. I thought it did get better as it warmed though."
""
"O: This one is decent. It's a bit harsh in its bitterness and the mouthfeel is somewhat lacking. There are much better RIS's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall.... I was expecting some Christmas fall spices to be happening all im really getting is darkfruit, bitterness, and a ton of alcohol heat. This beer kinda let me down. Also not to big into russian imperials, but if you are give it a try cause the people that are into these, really really dig this beer."
""

"enjoyed 2011 and 2013 vintages side by side. this drinks better fresh than aged, with the older one losing a lot of its body and pop. deep dense brown color, not as viscous as some big stouts, but not by any means thin. it doesn't hold on to its inch of mocha foam very long either, but it looks tasty enough. nose of burnt barley, milk chocolate, and English style hops. not as dark as some, but the booze is well disguised, at least in the nose, and a residual sweetness abounds. the flavor starts with the heavy roasted barley and moves into a coffee and hop bitterness complex, before finally being rounded out by a little candy sweetness as it finishes. I like this, but ill bet the bourbon barrel addition has a few more layers that make it amazing. as this one stands, it could use a little more body, maybe some oatmeal or something. also, nothing about it really says Christmas to me, no spice or anything, so its hard to judge it in that context. heck of a buzz on it too, better to share this than drink it solo."

"Update: 1-8-2014 - updates based on a 22 oz bomber bottle. Upped the 'Smell' rating from 3.5 to 3.75 (richer, more pronounced character)."
""
""
""
""
"This Imperial Stout looks and feels beautiful but, there is something in the aroma and taste that is slightly bitter, somewhat metallic and is out of place and unsettling."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pouring jet black with a dense, dark brown head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is excellent. Big, roasted malt character with mild acridity (pleasantly so, lending a nice acidity), there's cocoa, cream and a pleasant coffee grounds character. Mildly hoppy with an earthy and faintly herbal note, this really is a very nicely done straight up RIS. On the palate, the blend of roasted malt, burnt toast, black patent bitterness and acidity dominate, enhancing the unsweetened cocoa character that's present. Faintly creamy, this really is all about dark malts without any unnecessary sweetness. Medium-full in body with moderate, creamy carbonation, this beer finishes long, dry and roasty with more than a modest grainy bitterness. Enjoyable, recommended."

"Excellent."
""
"what a great brew. I'm going to have to pick up the bourbon barrel aged version soon. I'd also love to compare this to Old Viscosity, but this is great"
""
"The feel is medium-heavy, the body just falling shy of full, and it's got a bit of a bite to it. Crispness doesn't supercede smoothness, but they're even."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste - Tons of deep chocolate, fudge, cocoa overtones with dark roast, campfire, burnt sugar, burnt caramel, charcoal and slick molasses. Overall, this is a dark roasty treat. Very nice, rich stout."
""
"this is a beautiful-looking brew when poured; can I find it on draught, I wonder?"
"This seemed to be less than stellar and might have simply been this one bottle, unfortunately they are hard to come by."

"O - An excellent Imperial Stout. A little highly priced, but will definitely shell out for a pint around Christmas time."
""
""
"O: For such a strong beer, does not seem to be complex enough, and the hot alcohol is off-putting. Maybe I'm just not feeling it tonight, but I am not finding it pleasant at the moment."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/27/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown sugar, char, candi sugar, raisin, light coffee, and earthy hop spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes with moderate hop balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, char, caramel, toast, brown sugar, coffee, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, char, toast, brown sugar, coffee, pine, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors, dark malt sweetness, and piney/spicy hops; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Russian imperial stout. All around nice complexity and balance of roasted/dark malt flavors with moderate piney/spicy hop balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"O - Great appearance and nice complexity in the nose. Nice spice notes in the flavor profile, but I'm ambivalent about the mint flavors I'm picking up in the beer."
"This beer drinks more like an American (very) Strong Ale or barleywine. It's good, but I swear if it didn't say ``Imperial Stout'' right on the label, I wouldn't have been able to identify the style. I'm sure the age has something to do with it, but I wouldn't think that roastiness would vanish and bourbon flavors would intensify and the color would fade. At any rate, a very enjoyable beer, but not one I would trade for again. Cheers!"
"Overall pretty enjoyable beer. Definitely something worth sharing."

"Overall: A good Imperial Russian Stout, no doubt! But one that lacks complexity and oompth to make me want to call it world class. Still probably one of the most pleasurable mouthfeels i had the pleasure of experiencing on an Imperial Russian Stout."
"O: This one I really love; complex and full in smell, taste as well as body. Extra plus for the fact that the alchol isn't an issue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a khaki colored head. Good head at pour disappates to a thin layer on top but remains. Nice lacing. Smells of dark malts, chocolate, anise, and coffee. Taste is good but somewhat disappointing compared to the nose - chocolate at the very front but quickly followed by anise and that lingers through the end and overtaking the other flavors. Gives presence to the alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is constructed so beautifully! Hints and sprinkles of everything that a well balanced RIS should bring to the table. Not too much coffee, not too much chocolate, nor dried fruit. Not to thick or thin. This would be my everyday day stout if... well, ya know... it was available to me everyday!"
""
""
""
""
""
"a good beer, if it were creamier and thicker I think it would handle the flavors much better. there are big flavors here but they seem out of place, not totally, but just enough compared to other RISs I dig."
""
""
"Overall. Too much charred and bitter flavours in this one for me. Not my kind of big stout, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
"This is the first beer I’ve had from Port and I think it was pretty good beer overall and I had no problem finishing the bomber. It’s not one of the best imperial stouts I’ve had but I’d be happy to drink it again sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a nice imperial stout that is a slow sipper and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22oz bottle into wine glass. Pous a oil-like black with creamy tan head. Look is fantastic and creamy. Aromas of subtle roasted malts, cofee, and chocolate; very mild. Taste is awesome roasted creamy chocolate with nice coffee bitter finish. Its just a nice stout...high abv is not noticeable at all. All around great brew...and just super creamy."
"Overall, what a great imperial stout, and a great beer to have for the holidays. Too bad I can't get this often or regularly where I live."
""
""
""
"Makes for a real nice Holiday night capper."
""
""
""

"Sip this baby next to a warm fire for best results and of course results will vary."
""
""
"Not a standout, but an easy drinking, powerful brew. On tap at Local Habit in San Diego."
""
""
"O-this is a good stout. nothing christmas to it (in case you were hoping for a novelty stout). more flavors come out as it warms up. nothing negative to it...just a tad boring really. might be a stout for the IPA fan, despite lacking a flavor of hops."
"O: The Port Brewery's Christmas Imperial Stout offers an average, uninteresting palate dominated by medicinal alcohol notes with little nuances and subtleties which are needed to make a good a beer."
"Really, this is not ""good", it is great. One of the best stouts I've had, simple yet suburb, does what it wants to do. More beers should take this as an example, Port killing it, as always."
""

"OVERALL: This is alright, but not nearly as good as I remembered it. Either the beer has changed or I have, and the real answer is probably a bit of both. The flavor is alright and the mouthfeel above average, but the thin look and slightly odd nose didn't work. A decent beer that was worth revisiting, but not something I'd have to drink again. Thanks for saving this one Doops!"
""
""
""
"O - overall, this is a pretty darn good offering, although it's a little simplistic; I expect a bit more complexity in an imperial stout...I mean, it's good, but it's pretty much all chocolate and coffee here, with an emphasis on the latter; I'm almost surprised they just don't call this a coffee stout...it's like an espresso beer on roids."
""
""
""
""
"O:a really tasty stout great for the holidays not my favorite and small hint of alcohol but definitely would buy again"
"O - Have had some mixed results from Port Brewing, but overall, this is a very enjoyable Russian Imperial Stout offering from them."
""
"Poured this thick stout very slowly. A load of dark tan foam with a decent amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts, along with dark chocolate, molasses and a hint of spices. This stout had the feeling of just a slight burnt flavor of the roasted malts. Also the taste of chocolate, molasses, spices and vanilla was evident. Couldn't taste the alcohol becasuse of the bitterness, but it did have a kick!"
""
"O - Overall, a very solid stout that doesn't do anything to distance itself from the vast pack of RIS. I enjoyed the robust flavors of chocolate and dark fruits and I thought the $6 price was reasonable. I may bring a few bottles to my Christmas gatherings because it is pretty good and my non-beer friends/family will appreciate the festive nature of the name and artwork."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very good Russian Imperial Stout, I'm going to buy more bottles and tuck them away in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
"O: a tasty beer worthy of being consumed on international stout day. we'll see how a 2012 bottle drinks at the end of 2013"
"O: I wish I could try this fresh, because I wouldn't recommend it after a year. It's just an average RIS to be honest and too expensive for its worth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unfortunately, this reminds me of grainy coffee and unpalatable chocolate. I actually like it, but the feel is really throwing me for a loop. Maybe I need to have the barrel aged version..."
""
"Overall: Whoa!!!! I should of waited a few more years, but this beer was well worth at two years of aging in a bottle. Mm, mm good. Will be looking next for the barrel aged version of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is decent enough. Really an enjoyable beer. I got this as an extra in a trade and very glad to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a good choice for an RIS, not top tier, but a very strong second and would definitely compete with a lot of other great beers."
"O: A drinkable, pleasant, big stout that merits reconsideration, but only just. Tentatively recommended, but virtually no complaints."
"D - Surprisingly dark and dry, I expected something in the big, sweet complex stout range but this is dry and subtle. The aroma lets lots of interesting grace notes flow through the roast character, but this is never quite achieved in the flavor profile because of a much stronger carbonized flavor that blocks out much of the potential subtlety. Nonetheless, a nice imperial stout and I'm really interested to see what the barrel aged version will be like."
"Overall: well balanced beer and hides the alcohol well. Drinkability may be hurt for some by the coffee and bourbon but for me its excellent."
""
"Drinkability: Bold, smooth, sweet, and high ABV. All around good brew from Cali."
""
"O - Pretty darn solid for a 2005 vintage. Was suppose to be my ""bad beer"" for the tasting, but ended up being decent. I'd drink again and it's cool to try one of these with all that age."
"Taste is rich and chocolaty with a milder fruit than the nose would indicate. Still a fair amount of alcohol and the loss of carbonation give it a bit of perceived thin-ness, at least when cold. When it warms it continues with the cocoa and marshmallow theme, albeit with plenty of adult beverageification. Sadly, the heat will never leave this beer and become truly world class, but still it is a tasty treat that is a joy to drink on a Monday evening."

"O= I enjoyed this quite a bit. A very ""drinkable"" imperial stout that I am able to sit back and enjoy on a rainy night. If ya can try this do it. I wouldn't mind a few more bottles of this I actually like it so much."
"O: This brew is decent but doesn't stand out from the pack at all. Very middle of the road but still drinkable and enjoyable."
""
"O: I am a little shocked by the good reviews of this beer. It starts out strong, but I thought it was average at best for the style (once it hits the lips). The alcohol and bitterness were high, and detracted from what I expect in a good RIS. I drank the whole bomber, but it was not particularly enjoyable and I would not choose this again."
""
""
""
"Pours a viscous, black and forms a thick, creamy and foamy mocha-colored head. Pleasant aomas of sorghum and sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is heavy and viscous, but not unpleasant. Sweet chocolate covered cherries that finishes in a somewhat unappealing manner. It seems that the hops interact with the alcohol and the lactose to yield a peculiar plastic taste. Save that, the beer is an excellent concoction. I'd buy this one again. Particularly for the price I paid at Whole Foods. Very reasonable."
"Overall I really enjoyed this winter time treat even though it is spring time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is able to pick it up."
""
"M: a bit cloying but it is a 10 ABV IRS, another 3-4 years and it will probably be perfect, some creaminess"
"Overall – This brew has some very nice taste and mouthfeel qualities, although I do find it a little one dimensional in taste as it only gives way to more burnt-bitter flavors. It is worth a try especially if you are looking for a roasty imperial."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a deep rich black color, dark brown edges, with a chocolate brown head. 1 finger with some retention and lacing. The nose is a rich mix of roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruits, molasses, and a hint of coffee. The flavor starts with a dominating roasted malt character. Chocolate, dark fruits, coffee and molasses emerge to create a nice blend. Mild bitterness. Alcohol heat more prevalent as the beer warms. Finishes smooth and creamy. Full bodied with some carbonation. Overall, very nice. Rich and flavorful. Would recommend."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a fine imperial stout that should be sought after for the winter season. While I am enjoying it after a few months aging in the spring, I will undoubtedly purchase a few more bottles for the coming winter season!"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice big imperial stout. The malt profile is strong and complex, but feels balanced with the body and alcohol level."
""
"That said, I am going back to the place where I purchased this bottle to see if there are any remaining. I think that this offering would be a great candidate for cellaring. If I can find another, I will store it for Christmas 2012 and see how it tastes with some aging on it."
""
""
"O - Pretty enjoyable and I'm glad I picked one up, but I wouldn't pass on Rasputin for it. Old Viscosity is a superior brew to this seasonal, but it's certainly worth a try if you're into Impy stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably would have been better 6 months ago. Not a favorite at this stage."
""
""
"2009 bottle poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black. Half finger fine light brown head dissipates to a ring around the glass and light lacing. Rich aroma of dark and roasted malts, chocolate, coffee. Great flavor of dark and roasted malts with dark fruit, chocolate and light coffee notes. Nicely integrated and the high ABV is not noticeable. Medium to heavy bodied and creamy. Tasted next to a fresh 2011 bottle. This stout has aged extremely well and I like this two year old bottle much better than the fresh one. I still enjoyed the fresher bottle, but it rated a half point lower; a good candidate for aging. Excellent"

"Overall, not a true classic among imperial stouts, but a good and enjoyable one."

"Roasted malts start dominating with light warming. I wish the spice came through a little better. It’s a fine hoppy imperial stout that may benefit from some aging. An okay sipping beer to while away Christmas eve. Aside: I’m getting very tired of overhopped Imperial Stouts."
"O - Way to bitter and acrid for my liking, this was a rare drainpour for me. I'd almost be willing to see in the Barrel-Aged version is better, but that's a risky $16 gamble that I probably won't take."
"Port Brewing Santa's Little Helper is a pitch black ale with a thick, lumpy, waxy light brown head that has eternal retention. The aroma is very roasty and perhaps ashy. There is a note of licorice and something fruity-- maybe cherry. More smells come out as it sits, like mint and vanilla. It's quite full bodied, very soft and smooth. The finish is clean and delicate. Wow, this is a really smooth flavor. There's no sweetness in play here. It's roasty but without any coffee flavor. There's a touch of licorice and caramel. The aftertaste is kind of like toffee... but without the sweetness. The flavors are really melded to make a single, simple taste. It's moderately bitter and the bitterness hangs around for a while after the swallow. This is along the lines of a Pennsylvania style imperial stout. It's very full flavored, but it can be just guzzled at room temperature. Thanks to Josh and Lisa (and ask4jenny) for this one."

"Really liked this beer. Smooth rules the day here."

"O: Definitely a complex mix of flavors with each sip. Sweetness, pepper, bitterness, coconut/vanilla. The alcohol is a bit more foreward that I'd consider to be ideal, but overall a very enjoyable brew!"
""
""
"D: Although this beer had some good aspects, overall it needs to either sit and age or just have less alcohol to mellow it out and make it easier to drink."
""

"O- good imperial stout. Not a big wow factor but still a solid beer."
""

"O- A nice easy drinking RIS. The booze is very well masked. A few aspects could be improved upon to make this great, but it will do as my first review of the new year."

"Full bodied with a medium-high level of carbonation that keeps things moving. Finish is a bit rough with the high ABV coming through."

"On tap at 1702 Speedway. Poured into a tulip tasting glass; pours opaque black with a small, medium-brown head that falls to a nice foamy ring. Aroma is of rich roasted coffee, charred wood, licorance, and baker’s chocolate with some mild smoke. Moderately sweet flavor up front, though there is a decent amount of coffee bitterness underneath that bounces in and out of the flavor profile. Finish is sweet and reminiscent of molasses and brown sugar. Moderate alcohol tingle in the lingering aftertaste. Very mildly carbonated with a sticky, full mouthfeel. Great winter brew!"

"BIG Stout!"

"O: This was a very nice treat and a fine way to start the holidays. I will definitely pick this up again next year."
""
""
""
"Overall, im glad I had the willpower to hold on to this as long as I did. I havent had it fresh but I cant imaging it getting better than this."
"Poured jet black with only faint ruby hue when held up to the light,a large mocha colored head atop.Dark fruit stands out most in the nose along with bitter chocolate and dark roast,the fruitiness is the main component going on here.A little more sharp than I like in the feel but it's not overly annoying.Dark fruit and black licorice flavors at the start with some earthy tones and unsweetened chocolate as well,a nice complex palate.A good close to great RIS,tweek the mothfeel and it is great,I enjoyed it."
"o: decent RIS. Does seem to get better as it warms. Don't think I'll seek this out next year but worth a try."
""
"Poured aggressively into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip. Pours a complete black with a huge 4 inch mocha head, that slowly settles into a fluffy layer of foam, and a good amount of lace. Smell dark malts, chocolate, earthy hops, and maybe a little licorice. Taste is lots of dark chocolate, expresso, smoke, and a hoppy finish. Body is a touch heavier than average, very dry, plenty of life, and for the style goes down fairly easy. This is a very bold flavored Imperial Stout and I would love to have it around the holidays for many years."
"DOA"
""
""
""
"1/2 finger brown head, small bubbles, medium dissipation with minimal lacing. Cocoa nibs dominate the nose, offset by a bit of vanilla and caramel. Chocolatey goodness tastewise, cocoa nibs and bittersweet chocolate, some caramel in the middle, and good citrus hop notes though I think these have faded a bit. Mouthfeel is medium, slick and viscous, not sticky, still a bit boozy. Not the best RIS The Alpha King makes, I like the barrel aged version a bit more."
""
"O: A nice Imperial Stout. A bit hot, but nice balance of malt and hops; a classic imp stout hopped properly, not aggressively. Nice flavors. I would buy this beer again."
""
"O- Worth a try, but I definitely won't be buying this again."
""
"Cost: $8.49 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
"O - This is a smooth RIS and for 10 abv was quite easy to drink. This one may become a yearly holiday tradition for me; I highly recommend this one. Definitely a great winter warmer."
""
"The beer is dark brown with a quarter inch of lasting beige head. The aroma offers chocolate, roast, alcohol, malt. Good flavor with some hop bitterness in the finish. Well balanced, with some bitter chocolates and roast. Warming finish. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation level. Overall, a solid beer."
"O: Good beer at a good price. Port never seems to disappoint me. I have a bottle of the bal aged SLH and am looking forward to comparing the two."
"Good 4  "
"O- a very good imperial stout. Strong in the flavor department which is what I really like. A snifter would be enough. The 22 was more than enough 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours thick black/dark brown color. Nice sized head. Aroma was sharpe, lots of bourbon, chocolate, dark malts. Taste is pretty heavy on the bourbon, some smokey qualities. Nice warming alcohol. Overall good beer, not great. Definitely glad I got the chance to try it."
""

"Overall: Not terribly complex, but well executed. Great chocolate/roasted malt aromas/flavors. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
"This one isn't super complex, but it's delicious nonetheless. This may be one of those cases where less is more. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
""
"overall a very solid RIS, flavorful and quite enjoyable. the B+ range sounds about right."
""
"overall, for the cost ($10) i wouldnt seek it out again. lacks some of the complexity i look for in a RIS and is so dry that its slightly off-putting."
""
"Awesome example of the style."
""
"I poured the brew into my trusty sniffer and watched as this pitch black liquid overwhelmed the inside of my glass. The beer poured with just over 2 fingers width of a coffee colored head and left behind decent lacing. The first aroma to be noticed is the coffee followed by chocolate notes. This beer is a bruiser at 10% ABV but you can't really smell the alcohol. However after the first sip you know it's there. Surprisingly the body of the beer is lighter than expected however it does leave a light coating on the tongue. There are plenty of hops used in this brew but only can be noticed in the bitterness of the beer and not the aroma. Overall a good Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Big roasted note right away. Some subtle molasses and chocolate sweetness, followed by a lot of roast bitterness and a bit of hop bitterness. Pretty good stuff."
"Poured a super black color with a huge Guinness-like pour. The brown head created some nice lacing. Aroma is faint, but of milk chocolate. Taste is supermalty and roasty. This is a little boozy but I am okay with that! Feel is moderate thin but the carbonation helps. Drinkable but boozy. This needs time. I'm aging the rest of my bottles."
""
""
"Santa’s Little Helper is better from the barrel. The flavor’s decent, but isn't forceful enough to push into the next score categories. It’s drinkable, though. Santa would have a hard time flying after a bomber."
""
""
""
"A must try for fans of Imperial Stouts. I'll likely be picking up a bottle for my cellar."
"Final thought - for $6, 10% abv and a seasonal? Port has done it again"

"Overall this is a great seasonal Imperial Stout. Won't miss out on this one next year!"
"This is truly great beer. I let it warm a bit out of the fridge first. Then poured from the bottle an expansive, tan, foamy, frothy, fluffy, textured head with loads of gobby lace. Color is an absolutely pitch black. Aroma is roast, malt, caramel, toffe, cocoa, coffee, licorice. Flavor's very close to nose with the balanced, rich bittersweetness on top, followed by an expertly placed tang, then the other stuff. Finish is pretty long, a bit boozy, and yet easy to swig some more."
"Overall: It's well-rounded in that you've got your boldness, bitterness, and more than enough booze in this one. I'll (pass out) like a baby tonight!"
"D - I could drink alot of this. Age has done this one well."
"overall: smooth mellow. Good not great (well even a good imp stout is great imo but....relatively speaking)."
"O: A- on this one. After trying Parabola, this one doesn't stand at that level....but still very very good RIS. I was happy with this purchase for sure."
"2010 vintage poured into a standard pint glass."
"Overall a solid attempt for the style. I think it could be optimal at about 2 years out so it has a way to go."
"O - An excellent RIS."
"PP (Price Point) -- On clearance at the local Nugget gourmet grocery store. $5.99 for a 22oz bomber, looks like I will be heading back for another 3 or 4 to add to the cellar!! Buy it while you can!"
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and I am super psyched I did not have to cellar it for this long to enjoy. If you have the patience, definitely but and cellar for at least 2 years to let the bitter hoppiness subside, otherwise I have read this drinks like a black IPA (which I think is a miserable style/fad, please go away). Most normal Imp Stouts cannot stand the test of time that this one has but thanks to the ample IBU's this one is stellar after 4+ years."
"Overall a bit much. Chocolate syrup fans will enjoy. Please enjoy with 2 to 3 peoples!! Yumyum."
"Robust and dry, overall this is a good stout, one which I feel a little age would do some good."
"D-Not very drinkable at all; the roasted notes are over-whelming and the hot alcohol notes doesn't help the flavor here at all."
"It was set down before me with 1.5 fingers of thick, dark-brown head with marvelous retention. It later resulted in phenomenal lacing. It was thick and chunky in the glass, like My-T-Fine Instant Chocolate Pudding. Nose was rich with fudgy chocolate, smoke and charcoal. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin, given its appearance in the glass. The taste was like biting into a really rich brownie. Intensely chocolaty on the tongue. My asthma began to give 'way to diabetic shock. The finish was an ashy, dusty, burnt charcoal flavor. Just not my bag."
"Overall a great tasting beer. I don't drink a lot of stouts but I did enjoy this one and would drink it again."
" I've had a few bottles from 2009 and can say its definitely better with with some age. I've really liked everything I've had from Port Brewing. The prices are a refreshing reminder that good beer from California doesn't have to double in price when it crosses the Mississippi. Sometimes its even cheaper than equivalent local brews."
"SkÅL!"
"O: Overall its pretty good"
"It gets a little to harsh as it warms, don't let it get to 55*"
"Overall a tasty brew. Would get it again for sure."
"O: I really wanted to like this and there was a bit of depth and complexity (wood flavors, hop bite on the end), but I just couldn't get past the acrid, burnt coffee, dry chocolate, bit hop clashing, and heavy alcohol presence. I was actually pretty shocked that a 10% beer at 3 years of age still toasted so boozy."
"O: ok, nothing special or abhorrent."
"I like this quite a bit. It's not on the top of my christmas list, but it's definitely a welcome gift, and a much better treat than those weird sprinkled spearmint gum drop things. And it's miles ahead of coal."
"D: The alcohol can be smelled and tasted, but not like you'd imagine a 10% ABV beer to be. Well balanced all around. A VERY good imperial stout that I will look for in the stores. Give it a try!"
"Pours a thick pitch black with a tiny 1/2 inch chocolate milk colored head. Smells of roasted coffee/espresso beans, bittersweet chocolate, molasses. Very rich and delicious smells. Taste is of roasted coffee, cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate. Pronounced bitterness on the tongue after each sip. I was not expecting this level of bitterness from a RIS. Light to medium level of carbonation allows for the beer's smoothness to come out. Somewhat of a medium body on this beer. Drinkability is good on this Christmas seasonal. Something I will buy every year from now on."
"A nice and powerfully roasty RIS. It is both hoppy and very toasty which brings the drinkability down. A nice beer, but not top notch. Under $8, a decent price for a big beer such as this."
"drinkability is good. fairly well balanced with decent depth, but i think it may be a little past its prime."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, kind of oily and slick, low carbonation. Goes down pretty easy, smooth, bit of heat from the alcohol. Not a bad beer, pretty enjoyable."
"D - Whoa. Been a while since a single bomber got me this buzzed... did I forget to eat? The bitterness really accumulates which makes the experience a bit unpleasant. Downing the whole thing is a labor worthy of Hercules - maybe after a hard day of labors."
"D- This beer was a nice sipper. A huge ABV and strong malty overtones might make this a pint or snifter beer before going onto something else. I didn't find it worthy of all the praise but also at the same time I didn't see all the flaws that some people like to point out in it. Overall a nice beer...like I said...a sipper."
"Pretty much a pitch black appearance with a reasonable thin tan head and good lacing. The aroma brings a deep blackberry licorice malt. Nice. The flavor involves juniper licorice and more malt. It's deep and pretty much full bodied with a low carbonation, smooth, near glassy feel. A slight resin idea with molasses sweetness. Not highly drinkable but very enjoyable as an anytime brew full of flavor. Great quality and recommended for sure"
"Can I have a re-do?"
"Overall: This was a great example of what cellaring can do to a beer. I have never had it fresh, but from the smell, I know this must have been pretty hot three years ago. This, however, is a delicious, smooth treat."
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info other than its the 2010 vintage. I bought it back in early December and wasn't planning on aging it this long. Oh well. I should have held up alright. Pours pitch black with one and a half fingers of thick, frothy brown foam. Some lacing. Nose is complex and pleasing. Sweet, roasted malt with essences of dark chocolate and even a little bit of hoppy vibrancy to round it out. Mouthfeel is not a rich as you might expect. Carbonation is nice but maybe a touch too much for this style. There is a lot going on on the palate. I'm a hops guy and this definitely delivers there but this beer might be going a little too far with them. The hops kind of drown out the roasted, chocolatey flavors. On the plus side, they seem to give the malt a lighter, toffee-like sweetness that is great and makes it easier to drink. The finish is moderately resiny and where you get most of the dark chocolate and some coffee flavors. This is my first time having this one and I am a fan. There is something for everyone even if it doesn't come together perfectly."
"The reveal: Port Santa's Little Helper 2009! I've had this before, I do remember it being a darn hoppy stout."
"I love this one a lot, despite the fact that it is actually all over the board..."
"Nice, better than most stuff I had from this brewery and related breweries, but still far from great. I quit trying."
"2010 vintage at 1 year old: head is not as thick, but still good retention and lacing. aroma and taste is about the same, but it might be even smoother to drink."
"Mouth: Super viscous, roasty, dark chocolate. Nicely carbonated, smooth. Lingering coffee flavor. Velvety. Enjoyable. Mocha goodness."
"D- The drinkability on this beer will have you responding to ""shawtay!"" At 10.5 ABV the alcohol is hidden under the wrapping paper if you will. If you unwrap too many of these you'll be acting naughty for sure."
"d - I thought this was a good RIS; a sipper for sure. Lots of bitter chocolate, bitter coffee, and light bitter hops, this definitely isn't too sweet of a stout. If you like that bitter coffee/chocolate in stouts, you'll probably love this one. Have another bottle I'm going to put away for a while and see what happens."
"D: Definitely drinkable, though I think I would save this particular one until next season before having it again."
"Wish I could find this in the tundra (Minnesota)."
"D- This one is a sipper. The alcohol does not hide and it is very honest."
"D) A nice Russian Imperial Stout. I'd definitely have another one, but tomorrow. 22 ounces at 10% is a bit much for this thin man's tolerance."
"D: I was able to drink a bomber, but over a good amount of time. When I had the 2009 fresh I couldn't drink the whole bottle. Drinkability definitely improved with time."
"note: dated 2010"
"2010 Vintage. Pours a pitch dark black with a nice, big espresso-colored head. Scent is inviting with espresso and very sweet sugar notes. Nice milk chocolate aroma as well. Smells very tasty. Taste is initially a bit bitter with espresso flavors, immediately followed by sweet chocolate. A little hoppiness to this IRS, but a very nice combination of sweetness and bitterness. Very delicious. The alcohol is VERY well hidden, but tends to make itself more noticeable as this beer warms up a bit. Mouthfeel is nice and full-bodied with a creamy finish. Drinkability is fairly high for such a big beer. A lot of people complain and have bad things to say about Port Brewing, but I've really enjoyed every single beer I've had from them."
"drinks pretty well. a bit too booze-forward for me, but it does well to warm you up on a cold winter evening."
"Overall, this beer is fine, but there's so many Russian Imperial Stouts out there right now that are worlds above this one. A good beer, but not a great one."
"Nice thick dense head with a fine beading. Blackish coffee color with alight only visible at the edges. Pleasant mild nose. Distinctive charcoal maltiness wich almost turns minty as soon as the generous hop kick emerges. Finishes with a good alcohol presence but not overwhelming."
"It pours deep Blackish Brown with light edges, the caramel colored mousse that forms on top looks so scrumptious. The nose is firm with dried plum, chocolate, and alcohol notes. Taste is full bodied with similar characteristics. Its a hot one, almost bourbon like. Dark fruits and cocoa are quickly overpowered by a bitter coffee/bourbon flavor that lingers for a minute or two. All around a great RIS, but is still a little hot, might benefit from some time in the cellar. Hope to get another one of these next year."
" D- This beer has a nice stout richness but not a lot of depth. On the second pour there was a large slimy gelatinous lump that popped out of into my glass. Even after fishing it out and examining it I couldn't finish the beer."
"I wasn't in love with this beer, but I can appreciate a good beer even if it doesn't hit me right. Putting that out there, this was pretty easy to get through. Definitely worth a try or three."
"Santa's Little Helper is pretty drinkable, especially with its slightly thinner than usual body. It is kind of a forgettable beer though. It is a nice seasonal stout, but nothing to go out of your way to track down."
"Full bodied, chewy, with low carbonation. This is a nice RIS which I recommend trying."
"This is as drinkable as the ABV could be. The astringent nature is a bit much to make it extremely drinkable. But this is solid."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is black, with amber tinges when held up to the light. No head to speak of. The beer has smells of bittersweet chocolate, spiced meats, and dark molasses. The flavors, not surprisingly, are very sweet and heavy initially, but balanced on bitter coffee foundation. The coffee and bitterness carry through to the aftertaste and the finish. The stout is a bit dry in mouth, but not unpleasant. Decent beer for the cold holiday season."
"D- This is a very good beer. A sipper for sure and I'd like to grab some more of these."
"Appearance is black with a thin light brown head. Its smell contains raisins, dark chocolate, coffee. The taste hits with roasted malts immediately, then some hops come out, along with some of those raisins. Its finish has some bitterness, metallic along with alcohol warmth. MF is medium. Drinkability is good for a RIS. My brother and I enjoyed sharing this beer."
"Everyone that sampled this beer liked it-- a few people even came back for more."
"Drinkability: Silky smooth for an RIS with this potency. Surprisingly drinkable for the gravity. I have another bottle of the same vintage I'll revisit next Christmas."
"Would buy/ dink it again for sure."
"I am not impressed with this. There are two different bitterness flavors going on, and it does not mess well. Not something I would recommend."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours jet black with an intense thick light brown olored heading. Smell is all roasted malts with a slight vanilla note. Taste is a bit much. The warming alcohol hits you immediately and is quickly followed up with a heavy bitter bite. Linger of burnt malts stick around for a while. A smooth full bodied beer but is a bit much on the palate. A decent RIS but nothing too insane here."
"Note: When pouring the remainder of the 22oz bottle after my first glass, a gelatinous black and white blob, like a melted combination of dark and white chocolate flopped on top of the liquid. It had the consistency of petroleum jelly and seemed to be mold. I'm obviously not certain what it was, but it was definitely gross! I've removed points from the appearance section to compensate."
"D: This is my first try, I poured about 5oz into my snifter, took three drinks and called the store and had them set the remaining six aside. This is gonna do me good for a couple years to come. And if the risk of drinking this is to receive a lump of coal, I'll take two!"
"This is some top tier stuff here; big, complex and balanced enough to drink a few of these despite its high alcohol level. A perfect brew to enjoy on a cold night such as tonight. Great stuff here."
"D: For a big beer like this, it's pretty easy to drink and quite enjoyable (probably the best of the Santa's vintages I've tried)."
"D: Overall, this a very easy-drinking RIS."
"Overall, a nice stout with some solid flavors, but I truly expected more for this. The espresso and smoke in the taste can become a little one note and get a bit monotonuous. Solid but forgettable would be my best way to describe. As someone who enjoys stouts, I would say its worth a shot."
"A fine imperial stout and excellent for a cold winter's night with just enough traditional character and remaining big and warming."
"Thanks again to Andy for sharing all his beers! Poured into a tulip. Pours near black and thick with about an inch of mocha colored head on top. The aroma is pretty sound on this. Roasty with lingering aromas of coffee and chocolate with a slightly molasses undertones. The taste is a lot more straight forward than the aroma. A big bitter coffee bomb, masking pretty much any other flavor to this. It's tasty; but for all intent and purpose; I'd expected a bit more than a roasty coffee bomb. Overall the mouthfeel isn't bad. I'd generally hope for a big RIS it could be a bit smoother but not bad. Drinks well enough, but the one dimensional flavor becomes tiresome after a while."
"Good texture on the mouthfeel. There is a bit of crispness to it. I enjoy Port's beers, haven't been disappointed."
"Port Brewing Company has brewed beer all over the spectrum (in terms of quality). Santa's Little Helper lies somewhere in the second tier. There's no question that it's good beer, but it could easily be better. More coffee, more body, and a few more bubbles would really drive it to the next level. This is pretty good stuff as it is though. At least at two years of age it is."
"I would consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of the imperial stout style (don't let my beer karma score fool you) so when I say 'this one isn't my favorite' I'm not knocking it or saying it's not a great beer. I'm just comparing it against soooo many others. In fact, this isn't even my favorite Port Brewing imperial stout. But again, it's a great brew, maybe just too smoky for my taste. The most helpful thing I could say if you haven't tried this before & are thinking about getting it, is this... If your palate prefers smoked porters over vanilla porters, then trust me, this is the imperial stout for you! But if you prefer vanilla porter over smoked porter, then there are so many great imperial stouts out there that you should spend your money on another one instead. Cheers!"
"Heavier body, sticky and chewy on the tongue. Drinks well but a little sweet for my tastes. Also, I noticed a distinct smack of apple in the middle which wasn't bad but kind of curious."
"D: A very creamy brew that would love to grab more to hold on to. Flavors have me coming back."
"In other words, I guess I liked it!"
"D--Not too bad, but not blown away by this guy, got bottle as a gift from a friend, so why not? Worth trying if you enjoy the style but there are better ones out there..."
"I once had a knockoff version of this. I shoulda been tipped-off by the name ""Santos L. Halper"". This genuine article pours a straight black-brown topped by a healthy brown foam. The nose comprises chocolate, roasted malts, molasses; just a nice, rich RIS smell. The taste brings forth more of the same, but with an uptick in roasted malts and a few extra pinches of cocoa powder. The body is pretty thick, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, a lovely impy stout, one that seems to live up to a good amount of the hype."
"This beer pours a nice darkness that had the once vigorous foam die rather quickly. This beer smells pretty good. The notes would be lots of roast and chocolate. I didn't find it to be much more complex than that. The taste consisted of chocolate, some coffee notes a hint of hoppy floral and the booze flavor in the background. The mouthfeel is rather astringent due to the higher ABV and this beer's drinkability suffers due to that. I've had some cheaper whiskey's that are smoother to drink than this, but it does go with the style, and honestly it's not that bad of a beer, just not one of my favorite RISs. I think that this beer could do with some aging as of right now it is far too hot."
"in the end, not the best RIS but certainly no slouch. pick up a bottle even if just for the cool label."
"Drinkability - This is a beer you want to sip, sit back and relax with. A bomber is the perfect size. Enjoy one on a cold winters day."
"D - Despite a pretty good balancing act, the sugariness runs away a little, and ultimately transforms the bottom of the first bomber into a waving chequered flag."
"Overall a solid RIS that is enjoyable when the weather turns cold. Nothing outstanding, but very drinkable and I love the label. I'll pick up a few of these each year."
"Drinkability is good. Very solid RIS, not in the upper echelon, but easily in the second tier. Good stuff."
"Lot's of dark chocolate, roast bacon, coffee ice cream, pepper, raisins, rum, smoke and wood with a a very creamy body, and soft carbonation. After awhile, a bitter roastiness develops in the finish, but it's never overpowering. Excellent stuff, highly recommended."
"Nicely done RIS but nothing to write home about."
"D: Not quite a sweet stout, not quite an over the top RIS, but a good beer for someone who likes stouts but finds some RISs to be overwhelming. This could be considered a good intro to the style (and I don't mean that as an insult). A very nice beer that hides the alcohol very well. Definitely worth trying for anyone who is a stout fan."
"This was an easy drink for the ABV that is listed. I had a vintage keg, so the ABV was higher then what is listed on the site as the standard. It was an amazing drink, and I would enjoy more. The ABV is bit high for the average beer drinker though, so trying this stout of the bench might be a bit tough. Once again, another great brew that I have had from Port Brewing."
"This one was really good, especially because it stood up to the Abyss we had tried a bit earlier. I thought that the Abyss would make this one just syrupy and sweet, but it's actually like an Abyss light. Roasty malts dominate, giving enough bitterness to balance out sweetness from the chocolate and sweeter flavors. A bit of oak to it too, some piney hops in it too. Glad to have tried it, sorry that I only got one!"
"Drinkability: a pretty drinkable stout for its ABV, this beer does grate a little bit with its astringency. I don't feel like I need a whole bomber of this (not that I won't drink it all anyway)."
"D - Sentimental holiday favorite for me, but the burnt malt finish keeps me from enjoying that much more."
" Drinkability took a hint as although I'm OK with the strength, I'm not drinking much if I'm not in love with it."
"D: it pretty good but not as drinkable as I thought it would be. Real tasty brew but was not really diggin the bitter finish. I think I like the barrel aged version better."
"Taste: Slightly sweet up front with a dry finish. Solid, balanced roast character overall, but standard RIS characteristics that don't stand out. However, the finish has a nice licorice note that lingers well alongside coffee. Notably full mouthfeel as well, but overall pretty bog standard RIS offering."
"Drink- It was a decent attempt. I so far havent been all that gung ho about PP, but wanted to try them again."
"The taste brought a good dose of booze as well as some roast and chocolate. Additionally, I also got some slight dark fruit and the smoke coming back again. Body was nice and full with a bit of smoke and then there was a light amount of carbonation. Drank fairly well, but not up to the caliber that I expect from Port."
"D: This is a nice beer. It's not my favorite, but it's tasty. I think this bomber is gonna be just the right amount."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability - This is a sipper. I taste no alcohol in the beer itself, though I do get some warmth. Not bad at all, and the Mouthfeel is just great. I'll be sure to age the one I just picked up for a while to make sure it is just as delightful next time I have this."
"looks like a stout. smell has a big chocolate backbone to it and a hint of booze. taste is bitter right off the top, followed by roasted malt and some chocolate on the way down. Booze is apparent as well and lingers as a burn well after you've stop taking sips. The mouthfeel is very lively, very slippery/oily and buttery. too carbonated, which is strange for a stout. drinkability is OK given the high ABV, but the bitterness, aftertaste and carbonation cancel that out somewhat. Not my favorite."
"Linger: 2.5"
"a little to much head and i poured it well. Very nice coffee and tobacco aroma deep roasted malts. The taste is buttery sweet chocolate really coats the tongue, has a caramel espresso taste. Really good, I would love to try a barrel aged version! mouth feel is refreshingly smooth for an imperial stout."
"D - Good for the style. Creamy, full flavored and satisfying. This is a sipper, but i should find it rather easy to finish the glass :)"
"Color is dark brown and almost black. Chocolate, coffee, sugar, bread, and alcohol in the nose. Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous, but cut by moderate carbonation; with a little swishing, the mouthfeel turns nicely moussey. Taste includes thick espresso and chocolate, just a touch of smoke without tasting burnt; also includes a bit of dark fruity sweetness. The alcohol in the smell is reduced, though still noticeable in the taste. Maybe I'm extra thirsty, but for all its richness and high ABV, it still seems very drinkable. I love drinking with friends, but tonight I'm glad to have the bomber to myself!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, very solid RIS."
"Pretty darn good, a very rich dessert like beer which is Tomme's specialty. Would go great with a dessert or a sweet tooth."
"Black with a minimal head and low head retention. Aroma was dark caramel and raisins. Carbonation bite up front that quickly faded. Bittersweet and complex middle through finish. After the carbonation sting wears off, you're treated to caramle with raisins that morphs into coffee and finishes with bittersweet chocolate post finish. No alcohol heat, but it is definitely noticeable. On the thin side for a RIS. The flavors carry this one, however."
"D: medium"
"D-I'll try one again in a year and see if it's any better. Can't say I'm thrilled with this even after a year in the bottle."
"D: Really boozy. Gets more boozy as it warms. I couldn't finish the 22oz bottle I had. This surprised me because I've finish 10%er 750ml in the same category before this with no problem. Personally, just didn't do it for me."
"Duvel glass pour and I am met with an oil black ale with a scoop of mocha on top...er...a two finger frothy beige head that is going nowhere fast. Lacing all over the glass. The aroma consists of roasted malts, raisins, caramel and some seriously nice dark chocolate whiffs. The taste has a lot of chocolate going on and a major bitter black coffee taste after the swallow. For all that's going on, the mouthfeel was a tad thin. I was hoping for a little creamier but that is just my preference. The label says 10% alcohol but I am getting none of that. No boozy character at all. This is a nice Imperial Stout and I am happy to have one aging for enjoying in a year or two. Also, less than $7 a bomber is a steal!"
"The body is extemely smooth except for the bite at the end from that alcohol flavoring, it's thick to the point of chewiness which is pretty sweet. I'm a huge fan of this brew"
"Get this baby now, she is a downright steal."
"I have a 2008 in the cellar. Curious as to if it's better with age."
"D: This is a nice stout but didn't seem like anything too special to me. It hid the alcohol fairly well, so it was easy to drink. But it wasn't bold enough for me to think it would benefit from aging. I'm curious how different this would have been totally fresh, but about 1 year aged it seems like a Speedway wanna-be."
"This beer is a great winter warmer or a great night cap."
"Overall, a wonderful offering from Port Brewing. I can't wait to dip into my '09 Old Viscosity."
"D: at 10%, in 80 deg F weather, this beer will put up a fight, but of course, i'll drink it."
"Drinkability: This is a very good imperial stout, and one that I wish we could get out here on the plains on a more regular basis. While it's definitely a sipper, this RIS is smooth enough that it never gets to the overwhelming point, constantly begging you to take another sip, and another..."
"Drinkability: A slightly above average RIS, that I would not turn down nor seek out. Chocolate takes the lead here, but most flavors are standard for the style. An OK beer."
"I bet the barrel aged version works excellently with the somewhat dry nature of the base brew."
"Thanks, mreusch (from the other site), for the opportunity"
"The pour is kind of a flat black with a very thin head. Smell is of roasted malts a dark chocolate. The taste is big roasted malts, some dark fruit and chocolate. The body is a pleasant medium feel. Drinkability is pretty decent."
"Good drinkability for the abv."
"Poured a very dark, motor oil like black in glass. Very small head but definitely carbonated. The smell of nuts comes thru the glass. Taste is a strong coffee stouty flavor. Alcohol is definitely there. Nice. Mouthfeel is a lingering stouty taste but not too strong. Drinkability is good with an interesting taste lingering in the mouth. Overall, a very good Imperial Stout. A take time to drink beer as its a bit potent in a good way. Very good on a cold night or any night."
"I think this works great as a holiday Imperial Stout with the different flavors and aromas going on. While I'm not such a big fan of the chocolate flavor in general, it works really well here."
"Pours a deep opaque coffee brown, not much of a head but still appealing. Aroma is more like a barleywine but still has smoky and unsweetened chocolate undertones. Rich flavor is chocolaty with hints of coffee, licorice and molasses and a firm alcohol bite. Texture is thick, smooth and tingly and has a fierce alcohol edge."
"Medium carbonation;full bodied and syrupy. Definitely mouth coating and heavy at that. A very sippable, smooth brew."
"Thanks to Mike for the bomber! Definitely worth a try."
"I would reccomend this beer to stout lovers and especially as a dessert or after dinner beer as I am enjoying it currently."
"Great drinkability--the slight sweetness is very enjoyable."
"Overall this was a great Imperial Stout that only was lacking in its intensity of aroma. Thanks again Esther! Recommended."
"This is a tasty RIS, but not the world's best."
"Drinkability: Oh so good, but after on glass, I had enough. Intense and alcoholic."
"Consumed: 2/12/2010"
"Overall a pretty decent RIS, really doesn't have much to set it apart from all the other similarly priced RIS' out there. Had the 2009 on tap recently and have to give the nod to the 2008 vintage, it has smoothed out a bit and some of the alcohol burn from the '09 has calmed..."
"D is pretty good. I drank this with some sweet desserts (cheesecake) which was really nice since it was bitter but had some sweet notes. And the 10% alcohol was not too noticeable. It was tasty and enjoyable, but not something I found to be outstanding or super exciting. Just a nice, decent, Winter, stout. Go for it."
"Overall, a very good RIS. Not the best I've had to date but a better than solid offering and quite complex."
"Drinkability: I found this RIS to be boring and a bit weird, but it was still worth the try."
"D: High. If I had more time, I would have certainly ordered one for myself. Fantastic RIS."
"Tremendous treat, for while I expected this to be good, Santa's Little Helper was considerably better. Refreshingly complex but amenable RIS, a gem from Port."
"Knocked down points for drinkability because even with food in my stomach I feel a light buzz, though I am a lightweight."
"A: Loads of espresso-like head, some seriously sticky foam that leaves lots of lacing - 4.50, S: Tons of dark chocolate and cherries, alcohol is noticeable though at 10.0% it is generally masked well, dark fruits including dates and dried plums, brandy-soaked fruit cake - 4.00, T: Sharp hop bite and significant alcohol, dark espresso, pureed dates and raisins, a thick ashy sweetness, ever so slight hint of a lactose base, some smokiness and molasses - 4.25, M: A creamy mouth feel with a little grittiness - 4.25, D: A very drinkable and pleasing brew, one I'd gladly have again - 4.00"
"Reminds me a lot of Great Divide Yeti. A very nice Imperial Stout."
"On cask at Papago Brewing in Scottsdale, AZ. This one was served in a goblet, dark dark brown with a half inch tan head which quickly dissipated. No lacing at all as I worked my way through it. Smelled mildly of chocolate and licorice, and the taste was mild also, more suggestive of a porter than a stout. Chocolate, licorice, a hint of coffee, but all in all the flavor was lacking. I was not in a big hurry to finish this one, and it was disappointing overall."
"Perfect cold winter xmas brew. Tasty, very hoppy for a RIS, Awesomely bitter and flavorful."
"Lots of fruit and chocolate flavors. Pretty complex. Carbonation is nice. Semi-creamy mouthfeel. Fruits are lighter sweet fruits...apricot maybe? Great stout!"
"What a mighty fine winter brew. Pours a awesome chocolate colour, leaving light lacing. Nose of a usual stout, chocolate, coffee, toffee, malts...but there's something special about this stout..I purchased approximately 2 cases of bombers in the last 5 weeks. This is the sleeper hit of the season....so highly recommended by moi, just taste it and you'll agree!!!!"
"In short, this is a well put together RIS. It has all the characteristics of the style, but I feel like it doesn't quite belong in the A range. It needs a more defining characteristic to separate itself from the many other great RIS's out there. I will most likely pick it up again when I see it next year, but I think Old Viscosity is a more impressive beer from Port Brewing."
"I am debating whether I find this more appropriate as an imperial porter or stout. Either way, it's quite nice. A year more on it would be interesting."
"Drinkability is completely a personal opinion and I know many will disagree on this one. Santa's Little Helper is big, boozy and abrasive. It is challenging yet enjoyable. While there are those with in the style which are incredibly smooth and all too easy to drink it is nice to see the opposite end of the spectrum every now and again. This may not go down as easy but is every bit as enjoyable as the smoothest of the style. Great beer and highly recommended."
"Reviewed last night, from notes. Pours pitch black with a one finger dark tan coffee colored head. No real retention at all on the head. Clouds of dark tan stay around to coat the beer. No lacing but the suds drop very slowly on the side of the glass. Smell is hugely sweet roasty malts, cocoa and a bit of coffee. Very roasty and imperial stout-like but nothing special sticks out to me. Some earthy hops come into play under the roast. The taste is hugely roasty and cocoa once again. Some coffee notes in there but the sweetness is way too high on this. It distracts me and makes me grimace sometimes upon sipping. The nice imperial stout flavors are there but the sweets are masking it. Some earthy hoppiness and towards the end I get a licorice, molasses flavor. Mouthfeel is good. Thick and creamy body with medium carbonation and a huge coat of roasty malts. Tiny alcohol warmth. Drinkability is decent. The price and flavor are alright but I probably wont have this again. There are other imperial stouts that I enjoy much more than this one."
"Beer pours opaque with a light tan head that reduces to a ring around the brew. No lacing. Smell is roasted malts chocolate slight alcohol and coffee bean. Taste is all of the above with some molasses, licorice, and more cocoa-esque flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty creamy and warming."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile is quite pleasing and really brings me back for another sip. The ABV is well incorporated as well which is always nice to see. All in all it's a really solid RIS."
"Mouthfeel felt slightly thin, but the drinkability was good. Became a little more aggressive as it warmed, but definately a delicious beer."
"Dense and dark; very little light gets in around the edges. The coffee aroma is very strong, but gets decent competition from licorice, charred grain, vanilla and some nutmeg and cinnamon. Very powerful taste, yet no flavors are overpowering-- an impressive feat given the complexity of this beer. Would happily drink another. Drink it slowly as the ABV will sneak up."
"Fantastic Imperial Stout. It's excellent fresh, but I'd be curious to see how this might change and develop over time."
"D- good, not great. I had one 12oz. glass and I think that was just enough and I wouldn't want more"
"D: Really good. Easy drinking for a big beer. Nice for a cold day."
"Leave it up to a brewery in southern California to design the ultimate cold-weather winter beer. Its richness (both in terms of calories and flavour) and warming nature is ideal for the long, frigid winter slumber. The Christmas holidays are indeed a time to indulge and I can think of nothing that's been more indulgent this holidays than Port's Santa's Little Helper."
"From a taste perspective, this is among the finer RIS I've sampled, stay off the naughty list and try one of these sometime, you'll be glad you did."
"A nice ale, but does not deliver much over and above traditional RIS, except lighter and dryer. I liked the tap version over the bottle. Tap version has more fresh fruit notes that seem missing in the bottled version."
"Overall/notes: This is my first experiences with an Imperial Stout, and I must say, it was quite tasty. Maybe not my favorite style, but certainly enjoyable enough. As a Christmas brew, this is all there. Decent job overall."
"D - Beacause of Availabilty it would be hard to have this in a regular line up. That being said if it were easily attainable would want another."
"Pours as black as the coal I got in my stocking when I was 11. A nice thick tan head sits on top, after some drinkage it thins down but leaves some good lacing. Smell is pretty strong of roastiness, coffee, alcohol, a hint of sugar. The tastes are the same as the smell, although it is a little average for a RIS, the alcohol is a little overpowering, a bomber of this is more than enough for me. The mouthfeel is pretty creamy and thick but the taste overall is a bit average for the style. I was hoping a beer called 'Santa's Little Helper' would have more of a Christmas feel to it. Good overall though."
"Despite the heaviness it is very drinkable and smooth going down. The mouth feel is thick and rich and the residual tastes to cling to the palate."
"All in all, this reminds me of a less intense Papier mixed with a FBS. Very good brew, but not much makes me think it should be called a Christmas brew. This is a good one to have on a cold wintery night to warm you up. If you like hoppiness and a good amount of alcohol that still retains some good flavors, then this one is for you."
"I found this beer to be exactly average for it's style across the board. It was black, had the expected roast and coffee aromas and flavors, the body and drinkability were exactly what you expect from this style. The only thing that stood out was that the beer poured with little to no head and had no retention or lacing. The beer was very enjoyable otherwise, so I chose not to dock them any points for this. A good, enjoyable beer, worth trying if you see it, but nothing sets it apart from it's stylistic peers."
"Drinkability: It's been so long since I've had a non-barrel aged RIS, so it's hard for me to determine if the reason I enjoyed this one so much was because it was a bit of a pleasant shock to my system or if it really is just a damn good beer. Perhaps a little of both. This is a classy brew, well-made, tasty, creamy, aromatic, and - when carbonated - a delicious, tasty brew. At 9.5% or therebouts, this one's gettin' up there, but isn't unbelievable for the style. Either way, it's highly recommended, and I truly hope that my bourbon-barrel version of this is carbonated (though I know it won't be ...)."
" will grab this one at next opportunity"
"Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. It's an ok beer and I would definitely try it again, but only on tap."
"D: this is a great imperial stout with bold flavors and good drinkability, it has nice balance"
"D - This is a really interesting Imperial Stout. Strong chocolate flavor without an overpowering sweetness."
"Drinkability: The drinkability on this one is high in that each sip is a new beginning and a taste that renews the dark chocolate bitterness only to have it fade away. Although the ABV is high I'm ready to have another (but I won't). I certainly won't hesitate to have this one again given the opportunity"
"M/D: smooth and silky initially changing to a dry character like cocoa powder was poured into the beer. Heavyish texture and low carbonation, a great sipper or after dinner beer."
"2008 - 1 year old. Very good imperial stout, big, relatively dry, roasty. This beer pours black, opaque with very little head. This beer has a bit of wet cardboard in the aroma, so I really wouldn't age it much longer. However, the aroma is otherwise great. Raisins, roast, brown sugar, whisky. The flavors come out even more in the flavor. The beer is relatively dry for an impy stout and has aged quite well. The mouthfeel improves as the beer warms. Very good."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but there are similar stouts out there that are better."
"Pours a rich dark, near black. Minimal head. Smell is very unplesant, almost pure rubbing alcohol. Taste is thankfully a nice blend of rich bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted espresso beans. Lacks charachter - needs fruit flavors to be a true RIS in my book. Body is full but very smooth and clean. Good beer, but the unrefined scent and lack of charachter hurts."
"The mouth feel is very thick and slightly bubbly, it goes down warm and has a kick, this is a decent beer for a long winters night."
"Next year..."
"(2009) Pours a very dark and deep black lettting no light escape. A full thick brown head formed and remained throughout most of the beer. Not very much lacing left behind though, this beer looks fantastic in the glass! Smells of deep roasted coffee, booze, and some sugar as well. The taste is fairly intense, full and deep. The dark roasted coffee is the most dominate flavor, but there is some bitter chocolate, licorice, and perhpas some anise in there as well. The finsh is very long, but wonderful. Absolutely lovely beer!"
"D) a little high in price for a non barrel aged beer... but i have had many worse barrel aged imperial stouts for twice the price (dark lord, darkness, etc ). This is a solid beer."
"Mouthfeel is good, some nice thickness for an imperial stout. Very drinkable as well despite relatively high abv."
"Re-tasting several times shows complexities and consistency. Still a bit alcoholic but I've adjusted my scores based on recent tastings in 2013."
"Overall, even in the thinner state and the brightness of flavor, I still found this to be a real sipper. The bomber was more than enough for me, and although I enjoyed it, it became a task to finish at the end. A very decent stout that I'd have no problem revisiting, and would easily share with someone. From 2009 batch."
"Cheers!"
"Medium bodied with a low amount of carbonation, well this is a port beer so it's to be expected. A bit hoppy with some small bitterness in this fresh bottle. The ten percent is not in the taste at all but it's still high so sharing a bottle might be more doable. Hopefully next ear is better."
"D-it is decent to drink, the taste is pretty nice, nothing special, and is so thick which is nice. However, I couldn't drink two or I'd be completely stuffed."
"22 oz. bottle, brewed with 2-row, wheat, US and UK crystal, roast, black and chocolate malt. Hopped with Phoenix, Challenger and East Kent Goldings, and fermented with WLP001 and their house strain. It settles to a jet-black body, with a thin khaki head that dissipates with time and leaves no real lacing. Alcohol, chocolate and licorice lead off in the nose, followed by molasses, coffee, leather?, tobacco?, and some dark fruits. The boozy character fades with time, but doesn't disappear. On the palate, the loads of dark malts lend an acidic tone to the brew, along with a dose of chocolate. There's also some green hoppy flavors, a pretty good bitterness, a sweet backdrop and some late esters. Warming and drying, with a long finish, but a little thinner than I would like. This is too young for full enjoyment - it needs time for the alcohol to mellow and the flavors to marry. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar would do the trick."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit but it tastes like it has a higher abv than it does its still worth checking out though"
"Overall, a pretty solid RIS. If I had this available to me on a regular basis I would have one every now and then. Since I am in Ohio, I'll probably just leave it alone."
"D: I enjoyed this beer very very much. I liked it a lot better this year then i remember from years past. Opened an 08 recently but the 09 was head and shoulders above the 08. I guess the fact that I easily drank the entire bottle says a lot."
"Drinkability- Great beer for a cold night."
"OK, so it was summer when I tried this! What's wrong with some Christmas in July?! The colour was absolute black with no head. The aroma was coffee and sweet malt with brown sugar. The palate had loads more coffee with plenty of bittersweet chocolate, bitter edges and a very long finish that went on and on and on!"
"22oz bottle, 2008 vintage. Near black with a small beige head. Dark chocolate, dried fruit, and hoppy aroma. The flavor has plenty of hop bitterness and some dark chocolate, with dried fruit and alcohol. Full-bodied, but not too thick for style. A hoppy and bitter version of the style, but with a nice malt character."
"drinkability is crazy - i think i could have drank another bomber but then i would not have been able to function"
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Bottle from Park Lane Liquor in Lancaster, CA. This beer pours pitch black with a medium and foamy light brown head that diminishes slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla in the nose. Full-bodied with flavors of coffee, cocoa and roasted malt, plus some vanilla and raisins. The finish is rich and flavorful with a nice vanilla mocha aftertaste. Good all around."
"D: A snifter seems like the right amount"
"The Kings of Hop"
"O.. Solid beer. The bourbon was strong and I love that profile so I am a bit biased. The dessert that accompanied this beverage was a sugary,peanut, chocolate, stout cookie and a small glass of Sazarac RYE. Boozie fun..."
"Overall a very fine imperial stout. An excellent example of the style without getting too crazy. I love how all the factors you look for in an imperial stout kind of contribute during different parts of the ride across the palate. Really much better than i expected. I would love to see how this one is with even a little bit more age on it. Could go for a year or two more i'd say. A very nice imperial stout."
"Reviewed on 7/21/09. 2008 bottle. Pours black with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet chocolate, molasses, nougat, and roasted malt. Flavor is sweet and rich initially, lots of molasses, toffee, and chocolate. Slight booziness. Overall, this is a decent imperial stout."
"After the pour I was a bit skeptical and the aroma was not as bold as I like. Yet after the taste, this RIS really improves, and as it warms it just gets better. Unfortunately this beer is currently not available in Oregon, but next trip to Seattle in winter I'll be looking for more, especially since it's price tag was only 8.99"
"Very good RIS. Nothing to set it apart from the pack of good RIS in the world, but something I'd never be disappointed to see glaring back from me out of my glass. Definitely the first rather ""routine"" brew I've had from Port!"
"2008 edition. Pours a dark brown color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly chocolate and malty goodness, perhaps a touch of dark fruit. The flavor is extremely malty chocolate and dark fruit with lots of leftover sweetness. It's almost totally flat. The mouthfeel is on the thick end of medium and the drinkability suffers a bit from the alcohol and high sweetness."
"An easy drinker for the abv. You sip it except for the occasional greedy gulp and then relax a savor the art in your glass"
"A great big delectable Christmas cookie of a beer. Look forward to having this again."
"Meh. Not one I'd care to try again."
"Overall it is a nice way to end (or start) the day, but there is nothing mind-blowing here."
"Drinkability? 10%abv tells you to watch it but since it's a rather obvious 10%, I won't have a problem there. The taste is all fine and dandy but the lack of carbo is really hurting my session with this RIS. I'm kind of glad I didn't buy more than one bottle.."
"D - One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had, it encompasses all that I enjoy about them w/out pushing too hard on the hops for flavor, it lets the malt do the majority of the work w/out an overly alcoholic taste a very well crafted Stout I wish it were more available."
"D - Not bad but for the thin feel of the liquid, I wonder if some aging to let the alcohol mellow a bit would not help bring more of the malts to the party."
"Very thick IS. Pours black with white head. Roasty aroma, instense, with coffee and chocolate. Bold taste has East Kent Goldings, Mt. Hood, Liberty, and Challenger hops. On the sweet side, with brown sugar. Drinkable though alcohol is powerful stuff."
"Looking forward to the barrel-aged version of Santa's Little Helper and curious to see how this one does in the barrel."
"Overall: Nice mix of flavors, but they seem compartmentalized (for lack of a better word) limiting the complexity. It's pretty good, but I'd likely choose other ISs over this one."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"Overall quite nice, would prefer a little creamier mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is slick, reserved carbonation, medium-full mouthfeel."
"Pours a two finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving traces of lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted malty nose. Flavor is molasses and bakers chocolate. Smooth, high ABV is hidden. On sale at $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Shared a 22 ounce bomber bottle with psychohops that he picked up at Abe's in Bethlehem, PA ($8 I think) 2008 vintage. Poured into a shaker glass. Appears a dark brown, almost black color with a healthy two fingers of thick tan head. Very nice looking pour. Smells of rich roasted grains, cocoa, molasses and dark fruits. Tastes of mocha, dark chocolate, molasses and caramelized malt. Full bodied, creamy and satisfying. Very smooth as well. We enjoyed some Ghirardelli Espresso Escape with this stout. The pairing was Edward Dinero..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was an opaque black, with a 2 finger brown bubbly head. The head left a thin layer, and clung to the sides very well. Aroma was burnt chocolate with some expresso hints, and a touch of alcohol. Taste was slightly sweet, akin to a mocha milkshake with a bit of alcohol aftertaste. Felt extremely good in the mouth. Coated wonderfully, and just the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink at a mellow pace, hid the ABV well, caught up over time though."
"D - So very very drinkable, I would love it if this were year round."
"drinkability: ok"
"Pours pitch black completely opaque with a small quickly receding dark caramel colored head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, toffee, with a wisp of alcohol completes the nose. First sip is thick, heavy, and full with a ton of complexity. The coffee and dark chocolate are quite balanced while vanilla, burnt malts, and tobacco are supporting. The mouthfeel is terrific as the thick milkshake-like heaviness makes up for the lack of carbonation. A strong coffee flavor finishes with a bitter aftertaste that is welcomed and appreciated. World Class."
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a delicious, great tasting, smooth Impy stout."
"D: An excellent RIS. Everything going on in this beer makes up for the sneaky alcohol heat which doesn't really interfere, it just makes its' presence felt."
"Overall: An amazing beer. It seemed to develop into a more intense beer as every sip passed by...which is something I'm not accustomed to and it also reminded me of something I've had before. Just couldn't put the finger on it. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"This is a very tasty RIS."
"D - Excellent beer for slow sipping. A little alcoholic heat, but otherwise very smooth."
"Another fantastic beer from Pizza Port! Pours dark, jet black with a nice tan head. The aroma is full of roast, charcoal and some fig-like esters. The moutfeel is exceptional - full bodied and thick with appropriate carbonation. The taste is very rich. There are dominant espresso and bittersweet chocolate notes. The alcohol comes in slightly at the end, but is expected with a 9.5% RIS. The finish lingers, and begs for another sip. Very drinkable, and one of the better RIS I've had."
"Overall: A little too hot for 9.5%, and a little too much coffee... but still a nice RIS."
"Pours just a tad under opaque with a thin tan head. Nose is very understated for the taste of this beer, but as the beer warms the alcohol begins to emerge. Roasted coffee and chocolate dominate. Hit is a little shy, but the beer finishes strong with the coffee and the volume of alcohol taking over. Very dry in the mouth."
"Overall I think this is a very good RIS not at the elite level but for something that is realtively available it is great."
"M&D - heavy and smooth, like liquid ball bearings pouring down the gullet, well done Port, if this is a standard seasonal, i HAVE to get my hands on a limited release!! (EBF?)"
"Poured from a 22oz bomber (2008 vintage) and served in a snifter. This stout poured pitch black with a very thin head of dark tan foam. A small amount of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma was made up of cocoa, caramel, heavy roast, burnt sugar, rum-soaked raisins, and also some licorice. The flavor included burnt wood, anise, bittersweet chocolate, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, and some warming alcohol. Long, ashy, lingering finish. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and a bit oily. Lightly carbonated. A nice sipper. The long-lasting finish does make it somewhat tiresome to finish a whole glass, though."
"cocoa came through again with some oily chicory and bite of ETOH. Green hops with mocha and vanilla flourishes to finish. Chewy brew with just enough bubbles to keep it honest. Drinkable as all get out, washing down some volcano dessert with no problem. Overall, wouldn't mind having these locally at all."
"D= This was even better than I hoped it would be. I found it very drinkable and it hid its alcohol well. I really appreciated that the brewers filed off the sharp edges that so many others leave on (such as roasted grain bitterness, tanins, etc.). Highly recommended!"
"D- This is a very nice RIS. One of my favorite's so far. The ABV is very well hidden which makes this even more drinkable. Will definitely hit this up when it comes around again next year!"
"I was pleasantly surprised to find this bottle today on my way home. so I thought it would be a nice cold day for a IMP stout and I was right. The bomber was quite enough in on sitting but I would by it again next year if I saw it"
"D - smooth and easy to drink. Drink slowly, as to fully enjoy this tasty treat."
"Medium full body is accentuated by the low carbonation. This beer with more gas would probably not be quite as drinkable. Even with the strong alcohol content, this beer would be tough to walk away from."
"The flavors come across as extremely bulky. My guess is that this is partly due to the unbalanced, straight-forward alcohol presence. Based on the positive feedback, I am disappointed as this one falls short in aroma, flavor, texture, and drinkability."
"D-This is not a bad beer by any means, but when compared to some of the great RIS and double stout out there it just doesn't stack up. I probably wouldn't drink this one again."
"For a 10% RIS, this is great on the drinkability scale. And holy freaking crap, is this good with cheesecake."
"Not a winter warmer or Christmas beer as the label would suggest but a very good all-around russian imperial stout."
"Really overpowering but great, one would be enough, a full 22ozer that is!"
"Black in color with a dark brown, the liquid is a little watery looking though. No head or foam. The aroma is black barely dipped marshmellows. Plus black currants and roasted plums in espresso. Alcoholic marshmellow espresso hit the tastebuds first. Roasted currants and plums, plus a few chestnuts. Very roasted and warm. Nutty and fruity espresso with some noticeable but well integrated alcohol. The kind of warmth leaves a happy feeling in the bottom of your throat."
"Very good and very enjoyable. One to sip when sitting in front of the fire."
"This beer poured a dark brown (almost black) color with a thin head. A few bubbles stuck around, but it mostly dissipated quickly. The aroma was coffee, malt and spicy ( we couldn't peg the spice - perhaps a spicy hop). The taste was bitter, malty and coffee with that undetermined spice note yielding to a slight welcoming alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is full and lush with a slick aftertaste. This is a fantastic beer. Would love to come across it more often."
"A very tasty Imperial Stout, and at a nice price. While this won't make me forsake Abyss anytime soon, it's a bit more approchable and easier on the wallet. If it were brewed regularly, I'd buy it regularly. Good stuff!"
"Pours a very dark brown to black with a reverse cascade of tiny chocolate brown bubbles rising quickly to form a short head. Head falls off fairly quickly. Cool melted chocolate and coffee nose, hint of truffles. Flavor is rich and somewhat bitter. Big heaping chocolate flavor, sticky and rich. Bitter coffee grounds and alcohol, held up by the chocolate base. Barest hint of dark fruits on the finish. Lingering bitterness and roasted chocolate malt. Full bodied. Drinks well. Overall, its quite good but it doesn't stand alone in any particular way."
"Overall a good sipping beer that paired well with the cookies. Not overly complex but enough depth to make it worth your while."
"d - solid beer and goes down very easily."
"D: a bomber at most based on ABV, or one to share. solid flavors for the style and another delicious brew from Port Brewing."
"For me personally, this is a very drinkable brew. Then again, I love Imperial Stouts, though. This one is a good solid example of the style, flavor-wise."
"Quality but middle of the road Russian Imperial Stout. Recommend drinking this one aged, as I find it a little abrasive fresh."
"Enjoyed this one on Christmas Eve 2008. 2008 vintage served in my Terrapin snifter. Poured one shade shy of black with a half inch mocha-colored head that quickly dissipated into a swirl of foam and clusters of ringlets. Some random spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose was coffee, cocoa, malt and some alcohol. Taste follows nose with a subtle hops bittering detectable towards the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly carbonated; not at all viscous but a nice slick sensation across the tongue that lingered between quaffs. Easy drinking and flavorful RIS. Alcohol was well-hidden and flavors exhibited a nice balance. Definitely in my top 10 for the style."
"Pours a nearly pitch-black in color, faintest brown highlights around the edges, decent size mocha-colored head fades into a foamy collar around the glass, sheets of lacing hang on for dear life. Big dark chocolate aromas, rich roasted coffee aromas, espresso, all slightly charred around the edges. Taste follows right along, strong black coffee flavors, and some spicy alcohol heat on the back of the tongue. Perfectly carbonated for the style, some nice belly-warming alcohol, maybe a touch thinner than some Imperial Russian Stouts, but not to the detriment of the beer. Really probably as good as any Imperial Stout I've had, and I love the tie-in to the holiday. Fantastic stuff!"
"In my opinion, this beer is on the same level as many of the top imperial stouts. I'll be looking forward to this every year."
"2009 bottle this year: Excellent. Medium frothy brown head, less chocolate, more bitter."
"Big flavor...10% abv immediately noted. Big Mexican cocoa flavor, dryish coffee notes. Hop bitterness and cocoa bitterness with the 10% slightly stinging the tongue. Long lasting bitterness. This one is a little ""all over the place."" A little too jagged for my liking...I'll try another bottle in a few months."
"D - Very easy to drink, but stll missing a full mouthfeel. Good, but wishing for more viscous."
"2007 bottle saved for a year and opened for the weekend before Christmas. Pours pitch black with a thin head. Notes of raisins, caramel, chocolate, and a slightly beefy aroma. The flavors are deeper and add roasty notes and some treacle as well as some lingering bitterness. Bitter chocolate is also pretty prominent. The flavors are pretty well integrated but don't seem blunted by the time that has passed. The nice bitterness is also not subdued. This is a powerful beer with big flavors, but the alcohol has been tamed a good bit by time. Mouthfeel is big and rich, but not thick. A very nice winter sipper."
"I really hate to say this but I had a hard time getting through this bottle. I think maybe this is a bit young, because it's really rough right now. The roasted flavor dominates, but to the point where it gets astringent. The alcohol is also quite prominent. This has absolutely nothing on Old Viscosity. A disappointment for sure."
"Great way to start my winter Stout hibernation."
"Drinks pretty easy, but the abv & thickness show up to the party early enough, to give pause. Not a perfect IMP stout, but damn good, bet you this gets better with some age on it"
"I thought this was a pretty decent RIS but that damn vinous character coming through hurts it for me."
"D - Pretty darned tasty."
"Cask @ Solana. Dark brown pour with a short creamy brown head. Aroma dominated by chocolate and crystal malts. The barley gives it a chicory-like quality, both in the aroma and flavor. Lots of chocolate and hops give it a more complex taste than the normal overly-chocolate stouts. The alcohol is almost undetectable Very, very enjoyable."
"Overall, I'm not too impressed. This is a pretty weak impy stout - it's light in color, subdued in the nose, and watery in the body. The flavors aren't bad though."
"taste is thick, bakers chocolate, malt, touch of coffee, roasted nuts, ends a little bit dry and bitter, leaves the mouth thick."
"A nice winter beer, no real traditional x-mas spices, but no complaint here. A solid RIS, the only knock being the chalky finish. Would drink again."
"D: Thick, rich and well done RIS."
"This is a well balanced, tasty beer that hides it's 9/5% alcohol very well. Other than the flat appearance it's top notch."
"D - in general very good for a big beer"
"My biggest qualm with the Helper is the mouthfeel, which doesn't seem to fit the epic proportions that I found in the rest of the brew. Either way, it's one hell of a beer. Get yourself one of these before winter's over."
"A great stout from Pizza Port that should age very well. Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head. The nose has sweet malts, piney hops, fruit, molasses, chocolate, coffee and anise. The taste has a nice bitter hop and molasses presence to balance out the big chocolate malts. Full, thick body drinks well. Good stuff."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pub glass. It was dated 2008. The appearance definately looked like an imperial stout with a very black thick molasses pour with a thin tan head. The head disappeared as it sat and there was little if any lacing. The smell was of mostly sweet, mostly chocolaty. The taste was very chocolaty and malty, the 10% alcohol was definately hidden by the strong flavors. For an imperial stout, it was very easy to drink and left a nice after taste of an oak, nutty and chocolate taste. Great beer for XMAS time !"
"...Happy Holidays to all, and to all a good night!!!"
"D- an easy drinker. the alcohol is well hidden in the taste. trouble some to have more than one, but something im glad this area can finally get."
"D - Rich and easy to drink. One of my favorite Port beers I have tried."
"d - good."
"22oz bottle 2008 $7 This brew is dark black and has the most measly coffee-colored head. It smells roasty, alcohol and tastes roasty, something burnt also, like burned coffee. Overall this is not a bad imperial stout but it is nowhere near my favorite RIS."
"D- I could drink this all the time. Too bad it isn't a year round brew. Port makes some great beers, both dark and IPA's."
"D: Christmas is a cool time of year except for the lighting of a lame tree named after an even lamer person (John D. Rockefeller, Jr.). But outside of that its a good time of year to fight the new world order and drink russian imperial stouts. I debated on leaving one of these for Santa but I'll keep up my history of being naughty."
"Poured a deep, deep dark brown - I would say even black. It is opaque in nature. I gave an easy pour, and it was about half an inch and a coffee color head that disappated quickly. Sticky, wispy lacing left on the side of my pilsner glass. Scent is of deep chocolates and coffee....malt and slight grainy background. Taste is overwhelming coffee with slight chocolate notes. With 10% alcohol, it is apparent in both the taste and smell. It doens't necessarily detract from the beer, but it is present. Mouthfeel is of lighter body than I would have expected, slightly carbonated. This is a very good beer - with the high alcohol content, definitely not one for a long session."
"D: I wouldn't recommend drinking more than one! If you are into RIS-style then I think you'd be pretty happy drinking the whole bomber. About what I would expect for this type of brew."
"This is a sweeter version of an RIS that I really enjoyed. It's definitely a sipper with the heavyish mouthfeel and big flavors."
"Smells like a chocolate doughnut and hot wet hops, hot alcohol and a cold cup of coffee, but hops dominate and beg for your attention. Dark spicy fruits, milder malt sweetness than other imperial stouts that sort of has to fight for attention against the hop bitterness. Alcoholic heat is pretty high on this one and at 10% ABV I'm not really that surprised. Looks very regal in a Duvel tulip, and even better with the little bit of lacing that is left behind on the glass. I just can't get all that excited about this beer, it just seems a bit unbalanced to be rated any higher."
"Black with reddish edges. Looks thick on the pour. Not much in the way of carbonation was evident up front based on a meager collar of fine bubbles, but there was some spotty lacing. Aroma was roast, caramel, tootsie roll, hops, chocolate. Same in the flavour, but with moderate bitterness, lots of roast, mild alcohol in the finish, and a lingering hop and malt combination with a dash of bitterness to keep things interesting. More chocolate too. Very low carbonation, sort of heavy, pretty smooth, some astringency from the dark malts, and warmth. Even slightly out of season, this is a pleasant winter warmer. I'd be happy to have this again."
"Notes from 10/19/07"
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight bite, good drinkability as well."
"A very decent RIS."
"D - Nothing really hinders this one other than sweetness. A very nice brew."
"A very nice full flavor with some silky textures and minor astringency. The silkiness is boarder line DMS to me but hard to pick out with the body. Overall a good RIS, but not their best. Still tasty."
"this would be a great beer for a cold night. I would drink it again and am excited to see what ging a bottle for a year will do."
"Cheers"
"Taste follows the nose accurately. Chocolate and roasted coffee, a touch of alcohol and a bit of peppery spice on the close. Body is somewhat thin for the style and the carbonation is higher than expected. Yet without a lot of malty cover the brew drinks very easily for its size. Finishes with lingering roasted chocolate malt notes. Very nice."
"Overall I have to say I really thought it was excellent. For a nice seasonal release, this was pretty damn good. Solidly positioned in the second tier of the big RIS's, I would not want to miss this one."
"My tummy is warming up like a stove top as I type this. Nothing too compex here, just a good double stout to sip and enjoy during the night."
"Buy two, one for now, one for later."
"This was poured int a half pint glass. It poured a dark chocolate black with pretty much no foam and an almost hair thin lacing. Upon pouring you can see the full body before you even try it. It just looks like a good beer to warm you up. The aromas in this beer are heavy roasted malt and some chocolate in the background. The malts don't have an aggressive presents and mixes well with the sweeter aspects. This isn't very sugary in feel, and doesn't have an oily residue like I was expecting. The brew goes down smooth without much bite. This almost tastes a wee bit like an oatmeal stout or a chocolate stout, but does stand up to the IS standard. With a beer like this, the holidays are gonna be good. I purchased a second one to see how it holds up until next year."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a light foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of black chocolate is quite intense with some light roasted malt notes also discernable. Taste is somewhat vinous with some great black chocolate notes, light dry roasted malt notes. Full body with some good carbonation and no discernable alcohol. Creamy texture is really enjoyable. Very complex but still very enjoyable and easily drinkable."
"An excellent RIS. Between this and Stone, tough to say. But I'd gladly take this anyday."
"Drinkability took a hit due to the hefty ABV and ultra-rich flavors..."
"A very nice offering, but sure to get lost in the shuffle of so many great imperial stouts. Give it a try if you can."
"Flavor is quite delicious right before it reaches room temperature. After that, Santa gets a bit too boozy & hot. Dark, bitter chocolates galore give way to some wooden, bourbon-y notes in the middle. Both yield to a boozy, dark fruit finish that's dry and bittersweet. Mouthfeel is warm and inviting, especially around the back of the neck and stomach. The body gets a bit acrid after a while, but it's fun to chew on and nicely carbonated. Port Brewing rarely disappoints; although Santa's Little Helper is a sipper, it's no exception to the aforementioned rule. This beer (at nearly 3/4 of a year old) could use another year or two to fully mellow out and loose some of its hottness, but I certainly wouldn't mind getting one of these in my X-mas stocking."
"Update: I just cracked open my first 2008 SLH. Definitely different from what I presume was a 2007 bottle I had back in September. Not as much carbonation as I recall having in the 2007 bottle. More like a traditional RIS, with deep roasted, chocolate, and coffee flavors going on. Perfect for a cold snowy night in a cabin, or something."
"Almost three fingers of chocolate brown head are achieved with a violant pour. Decent retention with a few dots of lace. Body is black like a winter blackout. Lots of alchol soaked dark fruit are all over the nose. Some dark coco notes are ther also. The taste profile holds very true to the nose with that same rich coco feel, dark rich fruit and a very dry but hot alchol feel. The alchol hotness really overtakes the taste of this beer. I really think it could use a year or two in the cellar. Does give a hint of actual bourbon whiskey in the flavor from the alchol harshness. Mouthfeel is also sharply alcholic. Drinkability is along those same lines. Just a little to hot right now."
"On tap at RBSG at Lost Abbey. Pours pitch black with a cocoa head, displaying great retention and streaky lace. Lactic cocoa aroma with a roasty undercurrent. Flavor is boozy fudge with a red fruit twang and a roasted coffee finish. Oddly light-bodied and airy on the palate like mousse. Atypical, drinkable, and interesting."
"D-Nice overall. Glad to have it on draft. Good stuff, all in all a bit ""light"" by PP standards....but not by most places. They are a victim of their own success! I expect ALL of their beers to be killer!"
"Black, but dark brown around the edges. Somewhat fizzy tan head develops but recedes almost as quickly. Smell is quite roasty. I also get sweet molasses, coffee, a hint of piney hops, and a little sweetness. Roastiness paired with smoke is what I get on the tongue first. From there there is just a touch of molasses; I get quite a few different charred flavors. Highly carbonated and less than medium bodied."
"SLH had a couple components that held it back. Bitterness levels were unchecked, and the body was thinner than I'd like in an imperial stout. The bitterness was very harsh in the finish, it covered some good flavors a bit too much."
"This is a phenomenal stout, one that I'm glad is available in MA."
"Alcohol burn in the finish detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability a bit, but it's only a minor complaint as this is a good beer that I'd love to have again."
"Drinkability- Quite drinkable to say the least. Abv seems undetectable. Would have gone great with a chocolate-fruit dessert. One of the better RIS I've tried of recent."
"d: This was a pretty good offering, but I doubt that I'll revisit it. There are much better impy stouts to be had out there."
"Good RIS overall. Not overly complex, but a pleasure to drink."
"This is very enjoyable - not a treacherous sipper, but not sessionable either. Well-made, excellent representative of the style."
"Yet another great beer from Port, they can really make any type of beer and do it very well, one of the better imperial stouts for its money avialable in my area, will drink again next holiday season, recommended"
"Never met a IRS I didn't like, this one had lots of licorice, dark bitter chocolate, almost too dark but got much more enjoyable as I acclimated. Alcohol is not hidden very much, astringent almost until you get used to it again. Overall a nice way to celebrate at the top of a mountain."
"Beer pours black as night with a 2 finger tan head on the initial pour that dissapated quickly. Nose is sweet, of chocolate, roasted malts, and hops. Taste is quite good, of cocoa, roasted malts, oily hops, with an warming alcohol backlight. Mouthfeel is thinner than usual for the style but is somewhat smoothe. Drinkability is good. I was fortunate to stumble into the last bottle available and am glad i had the opportunity to try. Recommended to RIS fans."
"Pours black as can be with a thin tan head that fades rather quickly. Flavor is thick with malts and a tangy sweet tone. It's kind of an unusual citric edge, but after you first get used to it, it's not so noticed. Feel is about right. Overall this is a decent RIS. There aren't any insane roasted characters or anything real unusual going on, but it's nice enough to drink."
"Bought at South Bay Liquor. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Extremely dark with very little head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, cream, and a general sweetness. Taste had lots of chocolate and sweetness, along with coffee, malt, and alcohol. Aftertaste is extremely sweet. Mouthfeel is thick with very little carbonation. Too much alcohol apparent to drink more than one pint of."
"Full body, and a bit creamy. Alcohol is very well hidden, as this disappeared rather quickly. Very smooth and easy to drink. A very approachable RIS."
"Full throttle stout. Rich, flavorful, smoke, dark chocolate, more burnt grains, a hint of mint and crunching/drying hops in the long and flavorful finish. Thick, viscous mouthfel. More high octane/high quality brew from the fine folks at PP. Night capper/sipper/aging prospect. Go get some and enjoy"
"Wanted to hit this one while the season was best for it. Pours an opaque brown color with a big and fairly tight foamy tan head that fades slowly. It leaves behind a good amount of lacing. I think the smell is nice. The residue on the lip tell a chocolaty, brown sugar and molasses story. The aroma from the pour lends a note of roasted malt. As it warms you can pick up a vanilla from the alcohol. Lightly carbonated, with a solid but not overwhelming sparkle from the alcohol, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied with a smooth oily texture. The chocolate flavor up front is sweet but more subtle than nose and mouth feel. Finished with a warming dark fruit idea that lingered nicely. I wanted to put the taste at 4.25, because it was better than good, but that's how the cookie crumbles. Man, this was way too easy to drink! Highly recommended."
"Not really a great imperial stout; disappointing from this brewery."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful imperial stout. Most of the time, when I can taste and feel the alcohol in big beers, it hurts drinkability, but every once in a while, I kinda enjoy abusing my palate and sobriety when the beer is this good. It must be the chocolate."
"Drinkability - I caught a bit of alcohol at the nose but that disappeared once this RIS hit the tongue. This is an exceptional brew and a represents a major accomplishment from Port Brewing."
"D: Very complex brew but it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. Mouthfeel and smell are a bit weak, too. Enjoyable and drinkable nonetheless."
"Flavor is deep chocolate some rum and bitter coffee bean and molasses. Very complex and a little hot. A definite sipping beer that is great hanging with some friends in a cabin with a fire. Hops dont make much of an appearance at all. This is great for winter. Give it a shot."
"The flavor has a prominent dark grain notes, some touches of sherry, and even some tamarind to it."
"Pours a very dark and viscous brown in color. Almost black. Smell is black patent malt, some coffee. No head appears on the beer. Taste is coffee, some mild chocolate, some molasses. The mouthfeel is full, but has a bit too much carbonation for me. Another solid brew from an incredible brewery."
"Drinkability - Quite good. A solid RIS to enjoy for sure. Recommended!"
"Indicated 9.5% abv. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, with some hop undertones. Typical stout coloration with a finger width darkbrown head that diminishes fully. Flavor is very nice, I like to see stouts with their coffee and chocolate elements a bit concealed and this one does that well. Creamy mouthfeel upfront, with a nice little carbonation caused bite out back. I like it."
"Very warming brew. The body is very thick, but smooth and nice. Saddly, this could be too much of a good thing if consumed too much. The abv. is quite high, and it's such a good brew, that the abv could sneak up on you!"
"Overall: I love West Coast brews, hops, and RIS' and let me tell you Port Brewing combined them all in one bottle with this one. Tons of flavors mingled in with booze and hopped to the max. Holy shit this one has kick. I can't wait until next year now that I know what Pizza Port brings with this one. I will order a case, as there will be no coal in the stockings of my BA Buds. Each and everyone will receive a bottle of Santa's Little Helper. Joey Thanks and put me down for a case on 08!"
" This one is right on. Although I can only imagine what it would be like after 10-12 months of cellar time. The 9.5% ABV feels more like 15% but it's a sipper."
"D: I'm conflicted since this is very easy drinking for a near 10% abv RIS and it's different than others but there's just something off in the taste that I don't enjoy. I will try cellaring my remaining bottles of this and trying again in a year."
"Poured from 22oz bottle at Churchills Pub on 1-9-07. Poured into pint glass a midnight black with heavy mocha head with good retention. Smell is roasted malt, currant, dark fruit, a hint of coffee. Taste is heavy roasted malt flavor with chocolate and hint of vanilla, again faint coffe flavor. Mouthfeel was full body but not to dry or cloy instead a nice satin creaminess. I had to drink this beer pretty fast to catch our movie so with that said while not a chugger, it is still very drinkable for an IRS."
"D-A wonderful beer if you limit yourself to 1 bomber. It is not nicknamed ""Santa's Ltittle Hangover"" for nothing."
"Pours a nice deep black color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, very little sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, smoky, roasty, slight oaky/bourbon, vanilla, toffee, chocolate, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, big roasty/toffee/chocolate/caramel taste, nice touch of vanilla/oaky/bourbon. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium/full body, complex brew. Very drinkable, absoultely delicious, highly recommended."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Not the best imperial stout I've had, but also not the worth. If you have a chance, pick one up and try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find this one...."
"Not very drinkable. I think it could be, though, with some age. I'm going to get another bottle and cellar it for awhile."
"D: At 9%+, this is no pounder. I'm gonna try my best to finish this before midnight, as my last beer of 2007. If this is how it ends, it was a pretty good year."
" For me, Christmas is today with this Port treasure!"
"Screw the milk and cookies. Santa needs to take a load off his feet and polish off a bomber of this wonderful stout before going back out into the winter wonderland to pass out more gifts. Thanks to Port Brewing for giving me my Christmas present a few days early."
"This is a nice Imperial Stout, and a good representation of the style, from Port Brewing. Ultimately though, the amount of heat this guy finishes with hurts the drinkibility for me somewhat and keeps it from being great. It's still a good drinker though, especially if your going to use it to warm up on those cold winter nights."
"Nice beer but there are plenty of better ones out there.Nice try thought PP."
"Purchased at Yankee Spirits in Attleboro, Mass. Served at cellar temperature, into an Imperial pint glass, from a twenty-two ounce brown bottle. Poured a deep thick black that had deep ruby highlights when held up to the light. Beer was topped off with a rich, creamy tan head that had great retention. Plenty of thick sticky lace was left behind on the glass. Excellant nose on this brew. Nose was a thick roasty/toasty chocolatey aroma. Notes of wood, smoke, and just a bit of bitter coffee. The smell is almost like a fresh baked chocolate cookie. Taste was a little different than the smell. Tons of semi-sweet chocolate, some bitter espresso like flavors, and a little more smoke that was noticed in the nose. Finished quite smooth with quite a bit of alcohol heat, and some tingly carbonation in the back of the throat. Mouth was pretty much silky smooth untill the burn starts. Nice full rich mouthfeel. Better than average drinkability, but definitely a sipper in my opinion. A very well made Russian Imperial Stout. Good and strong like it should be."
"Drinkability. A nice, RIP."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style even if it wouldn’t my first choice for an RIS. Overall, however, this is a nice beer to chill out with late on a cold night as you unwind in front of the TV."
"This is a thouroughly enjoyable stout. The flavor is very good but not as one would expect from an Imperial Stout. As a regular stout, this would be an excellent session beer."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque black brew. Head lasts well for the style, with plentiful lasting lace. Aroma is roasted dark malt, slight anise, and fruity alcohol. Taste follows the nose, with the anise and alcohol hanging on at the end. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is good. Enjoyable seasonal offering here."
"Finish is long with cocoa powdery chocolate flavors. I'm falling for this beer."
"D: This is a pretty solid imperial stout. Not my favorite, but pretty tasty, and worth drinking from time to time."
"Busted out the tree and the wife decorated the place so its only appropriate to crack open this Christmas brew. '06 bottle. Pours out jet black with a pillowy cocoa head that sticks around for awhile. Sheets of tan lace along the sides of the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, some dark fruit, a smidge of vanilla and coffee. Taste starts big on chocolate and bakers chocolate, gives way to a little dark fruit then finishes with a bitter hazelnut coffee finish. Lots of layers and nothing overpowers, I think the age has done this wonders. Velvet in the mouth with an insane drinkability with no ABV noticed. Early Christmas for my tastebuds."
"I like this well enough but not as much as several other RISs. Definitely worth a try from a premier brewer."
"D- Very nice. One of the better RIS I've had, perfect to ward off the winter chill. I love the boozy character it has to it."
"Pleasant to drink."
"D: A good Imperial Stout from Port overall. A little weaker than what I usually look for in this style, but still very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Decent."
"Good beer overall, i'd definitely buy another bottle."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, on the lighter side for an imperial stout, but still nice and that makes it more drinkable. Good carbonation. A tasty, relatively easy drinking brew for almost 10%. I will have to get another bottle again sometime!"
"Pours an absolute onyx black with an unimpressive one finger brown head after an aggressive pour. Stickiness is very good, almost a complete blanket on the sides. Smell is of licorice and fresh french roast coffee. Big caramel malt and molasses apprears in the nose as well. Taste is pretty damn smokey but not all that strong. Santa must like his brew with a good charcoal burn to it. Starts off with a charred wood flavor and a nice espresso-like sting. A toast flavor then emerges with some caramel malt on the tongue as well. Pretty slick across the tongue with a lighter than expected mouthfeel, but I really like it. Very solid brew in a tough style of beers. Definitely a must try."
"Appears a very dark brown, almost black color, no light shining through at all. Pours with very little head and a ring of tiny bubbly tan foam with little lacing. Smells very sweet and somewhat charred, with hints of cherries, molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. Taste is very bitter from the start, but with enough sweetness from cherries and the molasses flavors to give it a nice balance. Very thick in body and hides the alcohol content wonderfully. A beer I will definitely be seeking out again when it's released later this year. Not the greatest RIS out there, with some imbalances, but extremely tastey and very flavorful."
"3/15/2011: Revisited this beer, don't particularly care for it anymore. Found it ashy and acrid."
"Beer is good and big. Happy RIS beering."
"While not the best RIS I've ever had, this is still a very good stout."
"The body is quite thick. The carbonation is very smooth and creamy. Lots of residual sweetness, though it is very well balanced by the lingering roast and hops bitterness. Very little alcohol flavor for 10% and what little there is actually accompanies the other flavors very well. Very easy to drink considering strength and intensity of flavors. Very well done. I love Pizza Port."
"Mouthfeel has a nice slick body to it. Very enjoyable"
"D: A nice-for-sipping RIS, warm and agreeable. A little out of context on a warmer than average May evening in Oregon, but a pleasure still. This isn't the smoothest or richest RIS I've had, but it's still well-done and is one worth seeking. Thanks go out to metallitone1 for sending. Recommended."
"D- easy drinking and awesome flavor, well masked alcohol, complex as any imp stouts, highly recommend this brew"
"Note: I lined this one up against 16 imperial stouts, and this was the only one we all hated. Sorry, such a great brewery, but no cigar here."
"Definitely a solid sipping beer. But it's very well balanced so it's approachable on it's own but also a great match for spicy food or a big thick steak. Very nice."
"Drinkability: There's a nice depth of flavors in this Impy, but it's not an over-the-top-in-your-face type of IS. It's quite drinkable actually."
"The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. The carbonation was spot on. The drinkability was good. This is on the lighter side for American brewed Russian imperial stouts and that helped make it very drinkable."
"Pours black with a thin reddish tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is somewhat smoky, nutty roastiness and a nice dose of bourbon and whiskey. chocolatey and sugary up front in the taste, followed by a smokiness and roasted flavor and finishing with a nice acidic tang that gradually gets stronger mixing with some bitterness and a warmth of alcohol in the back of the throat. fairly good size body, smooth up front, a very small amount of dryness in the finish. Tasty stout, I am not blown away flavor or aroma wise, but extremely drinkable especially considering the alcohol content."
"D: Very tasty beer. Good balance with flavors hitting all over the palate.. Unfortunately, there has been a monumental amount of good imperial stouts on the market recently and this one could get lost in the crowd. Ha, 4.35 and it could get lost in the crowd. I suppose I drank too much Abyss and Darkness ;)"
"D - Went down real easy. Not even a wiff of the 10% ABV in this one. One bomber was plenty for an evening. I would gladly drink this again. Luck west coasters!"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable, excellent RIS that, like Big Bear Black Stout, would serve as a good stepping stone for Hopheads looking to get into stouts. Even on its own, however, it is a very interesting an excellent example of the style."
"A good beer this is nearly a clone of Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter."
"Quite drinkable and overall a very good beer. I really like the use of hops in this one. I really would like to try this one on tap."
"Notes: Imperial stouts are grand in their very nature so its a tough style for me to judge. This is Very good and enters the elite in my opinion. Whats lacking in appearance it makes up for bigtime in the 2 other big categories."
"D- It is a nice bitter stout. It's a really well balanced and complex stout. Wish it was easier to get a hold of"
"Happy Fin Christmas. Bah Humbug!"
"I like it, but the alcohol keeps me from loving it. Good stuff."
"Originally reviewed November 26, 2006. On tap at Port Brewing Company. Light, yet piquant, aroma of touching bold cherry aroma, with some kirsch-like syrup qualities. Pour of dark, deep brown, with a ruby glint and a rim of tan. Flavor continues in a boldly cherry and bright red fruit line, again holding an amalgamation of chocolate and cherries, all in a sweet, and tart, and dry way. The dryness of the pits combos with the light roastiness to yield character. The sweetness creates delicious sippable boddy. Well rounded and excellently balanced."
"Excellent beer for the holidays and the cold Winters months...this is a top-notch brew that I know will turn some heads. Fricken cheers and happy holiday's to all !"
"Bottle # 411. It has a definately Belgian aspect in the head, flavor and aroma. The color is black with a very large, frothy and creamy head of light tan foam. The aroma has a definate winey fruitiness along with hints of chocolate, coffee, roast and brown sugar. The flavor again has a Belgian aspect to it with an extreme amount of dark fruitiness, candy sugar and possibly a Belgian strain. Notes of chocolate and roasted malts. Silky, full body and mouthfeel. This is such an unorthodox way of approaching the style but it straight up rocks and there is no denying it."
"Pours a very deep brown to blak color. No light comes through, but when pouring it looked brown to me. A finger of tan head falls to a fairly solid yet patchy coating over top. Nose really works for me. I'm getting a good dose of chocolate and incredible dark fruits. There is a very slight puff of alcohol, but not big. Flavor is very nice as it progresses from sip to finish. I first get a blast of sweet chocolate and a light touch of soy sauce twang and figgy fruityness, but this moves very quickly to a nice dark roasted maltyness, not quite coffee, but very nice and roasted. This hangs on to the finish leaving a dark chocolate flavor as things dissipate. I'm really enjoying the flavor here. Lots of complexity from the start to the finish. Mouthfeel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Its almost a touch slick and syrupy, but it works well with the beer. Really no hint of the 10% in this beer other than a light puff in the nose. I think this is a very well built beer. Best part is the development of flavors from start to finish. Tasty beer."
"Pour a nice dark body with a slight tan head, no real lacing noticed. Smells winey and alcoholic with some roasty bits of malt. Taste is very winey, more like a sweet barely wine laced with alcohol and a roastedness more like a regular stout than an Impy. The hops are really not there and I wish it was a bad bottle or something but it does not taste oxidized at all or anyhting else that would constitute a bad bottle. The body was thin and wel carbonated. A sipper for sure but not something worth seeking out."
"Yeah, I've been sitting on this one about a year and I finally encountered the right time to crack it open. Thanks to OstrungT for the bottle and three BAs for sharing it at a BA gathering organized by crosling. Pours a one-finger brown head over a pitch black liquid. No edging when held to light. Smells chocolate and toffee with a hint of alcohol sting. Coffee upon further examination. Tastes sour tart black patent, but also sweet caramel and toffee. Coffee is understated compared to the other flavors and I picked up either some falling apart grassy hops or some developing cardboard (ie; oxidation). Dry coffee roasty aftertaste. Md-heavy to heavy body and moderately carbonated."
"Overall impression: Nice imperial stout - plenty of backbone to this one. Stands up well to a cold winter night and a cigar."
"I have been sitting on this bottle since Christmas, and I just couldnt wait any longer. Luckily, I still have a bottle left. This beer pours jet black with a dark brown head. When held to the light, no light shines through the thick tar like liquid. The head is very thick. It fades very slowly leaving very thick laces. This beer smells very strongly of coffee. Also, I detect a very strong chocolate aroma. The alcohol is also very present in the aroma. It smells slightly of caramel. It smells sweet. That beer tastes very strongly of coffee. The alcohol warms my throat as it goes down. It has a chocolate flavor. Also, is tastes slightly of caramel. The malty sweetness is also present. I dont detect much in the way of hops, but that is probably because the strong malty flavors are so present. This beer is still carbonated well despite the 10 months of ageing. It goes down smooth leaving a warm, coffee flavor on my palate. I dont think this beer would make a very good session beer because it is very aggressive, and the alcohol content is high. But this beer is wonderful. It is great in small doses. This is one of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever had."
"Black as midnight. Huge foamy head, big lacing lasts as long as you want it to. Weird nose of brown sugar, grapey, juicy fruits create a really vinous atmosphere, lots of yeast in there, I like that. Zesty orange, coffee Belgium reminiscent stout, perhaps inspired by Hercules Poirot as well? Nutty, more brown sugar.. I assume they havent used any spices, but the yeast procures interesting spicy nuances, from cinnamon to licorice, from flour to anise Interesting to say the least, the finish passes swiftly from the very vinous side to the smokier one. Highly yeasty all the way, it procures obvious warmth. Slight acidity all the way is just another aspect I cant quite decide if I like or not. Full airy body, perhaps its strongest point, excellent carbonation, light charred smoky malts. Well well well.. this is one beer Ill definitely enjoy sampling again to settle my opinionIve yet to have a Pizza port beer that doesnt ask for reflexion after having been drunk.. of course Ive mostly had their special bottled stuff, but still.."
"Finger licking good."
"Tasty!"
"I seem to remember a little less sweetness, more coffee, smokeyness, & complexity last year. Maybe a little age will help it."
"Dark black color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. A medium bodied Imperial Stout. Malts are chocolate and coffee. Hops are slightly bitter. A nice not to over the top Imp Stout. Nicely balanced. No alcohol bitterness. Touch of vanilla at the finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"The beer pours as black as a crow with the head majestic in size, creamy in texture and a winsome chocolate brown color with the resident lace a thick and sticky sheet that welds itself to the glass. Nose is deep roasted grain, Starbucks coffee, sweet milk chocolate, what a treat for the ocular and olfactory senses; start is thickly malt, somewhat sweet and the top full in its feel. Finish is delectable in its hoppiness, acidity light to medium with the aftertaste bitter-sweet chocolate dry, a real treat, I sampled this one four or five times, what a great stout."
"Overall, not a bad imperial stout, but not one of the best at the fest. The alcohol stood out a bit too much and the raw feel was a detractor. Still, Id be interested in seeing how Santas Little Helper would age."
