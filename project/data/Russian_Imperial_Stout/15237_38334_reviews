"Pours black with a thin brown head. Smells of mocha, roast malts, molasses and cocoa nibs. Tastes of dark malts, dark chocolate, some light astringency, a little boozy, light vanilla and hot chocolate.  Smooth/velvety mouthfeel, dark chocolate malt aftertaste. Full body and medium carbonation."

"This is probably more true to the Belgian stout style than Russian imperial.  2007 bottle, I believe ('07 or '09)."
""
"O- really love the way this beer drinks. Flavors aren't out-of-this-world good, but solid, nonetheless.  Really super drinkability but watch out.  Got some booze here."

"Another fascinating beer from Struise- the few beers I've had from them seem to indicate that they really don't care about styles, which is cool."

"A new favorite in terms of stouts!"

"Really good."

"Pours very dark, silky, with moderate viscosity. The nose is big on grape/berry and dark malts and char. The taste is dark malts and tart berries. Not sweet but not a sour either. Very natural and well balanced. An extremely well crafted. ."

"A dessert in itself and an enjoyable way to start watching Thursday night football."
"everything points to - World's greatest beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall - Alcohol is very well hidden and the beer has a nice belgian type twist on a RIS flavour.  Kind of like a RIS meets a quad if that makes any sense.  If you're in the mood for a non cloying high ABV RIS, this is your brew."
""
"Notes: Bottle June 2007. This has held up very well. Flavors have melded together very well. Make a nice Baltic Porter type stout with the dark fruit. Tasty and somewhat unique in the combo of flavors. Enjoyable beer."
"D: Quite drinkable for a beer of this size."
""
"O-good imperial stout and nice flavor, but lacks range of flavor of other stouts in its class"

"MF â€“ Great mouth feel. Creamy, dry with some slickness. 4.25"
""
""
"O - 13% ABV is deceptive as the warming is ever so slight making this a dangerously drinkable beer. Being it's a 2010, this bottle is very mellow which was expected. World class."

"Talk about a well built beer. Appearance and mouthfeel are world class, and the taste isn't tht far behind (flavors meld great together). Recommended for any stout fans or strong dark Belgian ale fans who are trying to get into stouts. Thanks MaxSpang, wherever you are."

"Overall- I enjoyed the Black Albert, I'm glad my local store owner recommended it. Would I seek this beer out again? Probably not, but I would pick up another if our paths happen to cross again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a ruby black body with a humongous, rocky mocha head that recedes to a bubbly thin cap like a freshly served espresso. Smells strongly of chocolate and lightly of roasted malts. I get a lot of Belgian quad-like yeast qualities, bringing forth dried fruits, plums, and leather. Flavor is of raisins, chocolate, earthy bitterness, coffee/chocolate ice cream, light acidity in the finish. Alcohol is noted, but very well hidden. Bitterness is not as pronounced as the 100+ IBUs insinuate. Mouthfeel is creamy, full, and rich. One of the greats. I wish more US breweries made bigger stouts of this caliber and finesse."
""
"Nice dark head and nice lacing. Smells like a somewhat sweet, dark berry black coffee. Fair amount of sweetness in the taste. Dark fruit, cacao, and black coffee pretty early on, but not too bitter A hint of alc., but super well hidden consisdering. Can't really put my finger on everything else I'm getting; I just keep thinking berries and fruit or something. Hint of bitterness shows up on the end, and a very slight ashy roasted aftertaste pop in for a second, but disappears quickly. Awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great example of a Russian Imperial Stout. It's appropriately thick and creamy, with a strong presence of malts and hops. The alcohol never becomes hot, and it drinks well for its strength. Well designed in my opinion. The Belgian take on this style is great, and a wonderful departure from the usual stuff from America. I like the Belgian yeast and what it does here."
""
""
"Nice beer. Given its price, it's a one-and-done experience, but it's worth the experience once."
""
""
"O: This big honkin' imperial stout gets its identity from both massive syrupy malt character and some subtle Belgian influence. The latter creates a layered fruity impression and some clovey/medicinal bitterness that provides a bit of balance. The bourbon barrel aged version of this must really be something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really excellent RIS with a sweeter flavor than I expected (100 IBUs? No way!). It's very reminiscent of Ten FIDY, with just a shade taken off the feel. It might even be a little sweeter than Ten FIDY. Whatever, I really enjoy a good RIS and this is a darn good one."

"The Black Albert was given to us by Chris himself and it tied for 4th highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.25. This was a beer with some age to it. Date code indicates it was brewed back on Nov 6th 2007. Age didn't seem to hurt this beer one bit."

"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 1/2013. Pours dense and murky pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, raisin, prune, dark bread, molasses, herbal, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, raisin, prune, molasses, herbal, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; with big flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - A massive full flavoured RIS , with well the alcohol content well hidden and is balnced perfectly. A pleasure to drink and a must have to try."

"very yeasty, Belgian accent. roasted malts, british malt flavor. very bitter. some funky sourness, but I think it is a result of the yeast. covers the 13% very well... interesting stout. dark fruit. fig. plum? what's the deal with the sediment at the bottom?"
""
"Pours a very dark brown with reddish tint, thick ultra dense crema-colored head with a quarter inch sticking around for the remainder; sheet of thick lace for several inches. Smell: a bit subdued and underwhelming... espresso note, plum skin, dark brown sugar, milk chocolate. Taste: dark fruit and big earthy hopping... overripe plum, fig, raisin; dark and milk chocolate, roasty espresso, toasted grain; caraway seed / anise coming in the finish. Viscous body made extremely creamy by slowly advancing carbonation... luxurious. Very tasty beer, well made and with 13% completely hidden."
""
""
"Nice."
""
"Interesting, I don't like licorice that much but as an overall beer, it's done quite well and if you like licorice at all, you'll enjoy this one. I'm not going back to this one, but won't fault the brewers here- this is what they wanted to make here."

"Overall: This beer is the lovechild of an imperial stout and a BSDA, and it is beautiful. Manages to be powerful, complex, and assertive in its flavors, but absolutely balanced at the same time. This beer is so damn near perfect in my mind. It's a well executed work of art, not to mention a combination of two of my favorite styles. I must say this is one of my favorite beers of all time, and I'd drink it again in a heartbeat."

"O-The burnt malt and the dark fruits were nice and subtle. The alcohol was hidden well."
""
"O - Very nice beer that is surprisingly easy to drink for 13%. Lots of different flavors going on. Not worth the price, but a guilty treat. Let this one warm up a bit."
"Overall: This beer is a disappointment and proof that scarcity and rave reviews are often times misleading. It is by no means terrible, however, I wouldn't seek it out again, much less pay the exorbitant price."

" In a nutshell: Chocolate covered berries soaked in a world-class belgian quad."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Delicious, bold and downright impressive. The high ABV is a bit of a detractor for me as it gets hot and abrasive and overshadows the complexity that this beer has achieved. That being said, this is a great work of brewing art."
""
""
""
""
"O: To style and taste this scores phenomenally across the board. It ranks as one of the - if not the - best sippers I've ever had, rivaling the best Port or Sherry anyone can bring to the table [ I apologize for the overly enthusiastic soap boxing]. Furthermore, this beer is unquestionably unique - which is something I give much importance to - and also surprisingly drinkable! Have i mentioned it's also insanely complex?"

"definitely pick this up if you can, it is outstanding."

"Pours black as tar with a three finger head chocolate laced head and some leggy lacing,the smell is booze,rum,currants and dark chocolate,the mouthfeel is big,full and lush with big tastes of rich dark chocolate,molasses,dark fruits and finished with a dry boozy roastiness and overall what a big beer and perfect for today's grey outlook cheers."
""
""
"O: World class. Nice having this fresh as I have only had it with age on it. $10/bottle is a bit stiff, but I bought it anyway. Wish this was an every day beer for me..."

""

"The taste runs just as spectacular as the vanilla rushes through. Whipped cream, praline, caramel malt, coconut, light chocolate and touches of coffee make me wonder how this is not barrel aged. True taste complexity comes out in a smooth slightly viscous package. 13 percent ABV? Absolutely lost in a creamy, tasty, wonderful beer!"

"O- While the aroma is incredibly too full of booze, the taste and mouthfeel are just about spot on."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Being a huge fan of Quads and Russian Imperial Stouts, this was not a fusion I adore. That said, I have high standards for Struise. It simply does not compete with the top-notch Quads or Russian Imperials I have sampled. Certainly not a bad beer, for I will keep a few for a cool evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured deep thick black with a big dark brown head. Aroma of roasted grains, some spice, bitter chocolate, and hints of licorice. Big full mouthfeel. Bitter chocolate and roast with some slight spiciness to it. First time I have tasted definite charred tobacco. Lingering bitter chocolate and dark dried fruit mixture left on the palate. A nice impy that reminds me of Pt5."
"O: Not sure of the age on this bottle, but it's not hot AT ALL. Quite impressive. A very good mix of roasted malts and dark fruits, with a good balance of the two. Definitely a sipper, but it's difficult with the flavors and lack of alcohol heat. Highly recommended"
""
""
"O: A treat. Let this warm to enjoy the multi-layered complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Seriously one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had - yet for different reasons than most of the really great ones out there. This aims to be more drinkable, more subtle, and more approachable than others, while retaining its bigness and complexity. One to seek out, plain and simple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Roast dominant, with enough dark fruit and tar character to keep things interesting. Good balance of sweetness and roast. Fairly complex. Would love to see how this ages. The char was a little much for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste and aftertaste are very powerfull. The roasty character and the high abv make this a beer to sip. I had it with some chocolate and strawberries on the side, and I really enjoyed myself."

"Overall, this was quite a tasty stout, and perhaps one of the best stouts I've tasted outside of North America. It's really nice to see a Belgian brewery strive to branch out beyond the typical styles that they're known for and this was a big success."

""
""
""
""
""
"A fine beer but a bit too pricey for what you get. This is something I would enjoy once in awhile perhaps."
"This is a big ol beer in a little tiny bottle. Gigantic fluffy khaki head despite me pouring it as slow as possible, and it stays for many minutes. Absolutely black beer. Very sweet aroma, molasses and vanilla, some malts, and you can smell a hint of the booze. A little less smell than you'd expect. Strong roasted flavor with lots of cocoa, but surprisingly not super sweet. Some fruits and cloves too. Flavor starts relatively benign and explodes at the end. The roasted malts really linger and rise up into your nose. Very rich, and not super boozy but you get some nice warmth. Thick, rich and creamy, a touch sticky. Overall a great example of a RIS and one of the best overall I've had. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: drinks fantastically rich right now and I do not think this is too old. just a big bodied stout with an interested complexity from the Belgian yeast? smooth and delicious. recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"[O] Good beer. Not great. But this beer has been aged for awhile - and time may not have been too kind. My next Black Albert will most definitely be consumed fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick, viscious pitch black. A fluffy two finger light brown head rises above the brew. Fantastic retention; a fair amount of lacing. Big, bold aroma dominated by dark fruit especially prunes and raisins, roasted malt and grain, a hint of bakers chocolate and boozy alcohol. Again a ton of dark fruit, black cherries joined by chewy prunes and raisins. Robust roasted malt joins in; finishes with slightly bitter dark chocolate and plenty of warming alcohol. Huge, thick full body, chewy finishes with some creaminess, gentle carbonation. This complex and satisfying brew delivers everything one can expect from an RIS. Exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter this brew is black as a bowling ball with a little head that is mocha in color-no lacing present as the head quickly recedes. Smells like a big RIS, heavy boozy malts with notes of molasses. bourbon vanilla. Initial taste is big smoky, heavily roasted malt with an alcohol kick. As it warms I get a hint of that estery Belgian yeast but it is dominated by the wealth of malts. Dark fruity character as it warms, lower in bitterness than most. A rich heavy body but not sticky or oily. Low carbonation. This high alcohol content volatilizes the beer through your nose very noticeably. This is a big fucking beer. A beer to sip and contemplate. A must for fans of big rich RIS."

"O- one of the best RIS I've had."
"Overall. A somewhat lighter bodied, but fantastic ris. Lots of nice tasting tobacco, fruit and roasty malts combining in a very smooth and tasty way. Adam, you fucking kill it with the extras. Cheers!"
""
"O- Starts sweet and ends bitter. very pleasant. and that coming from someone who doesn't like coffee! It is very, very easy to drink. Truly hard to believe this was 13ABUs."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's pretty solid and enjoyable. And the finish and aftertaste is very long and lasting. Quite impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is a solid RIS. Well made and balanced, very drinkable. However there is nothing too mind blowing in the taste that will blow you away."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I think this one sat for a little too long in the cellar...still a solid beer, but not overwhelming like I expected"
""
""
""
"Inky black with hardly any light coming through. Tan head that lasted quite a while. Huge aromas of dried fruit of the prune and currant type with lots of velvety smooth cream, chocolate, and espresso. A touch of biscuit starts off the palate and quickly becomes the aforementioned fruit and finishes with the burnt toast and espresso. Huge and rich body with subtle carbonation. When compared with Kabert, I think this beer is more expressive for sure. A lot more of the dark fruit flavor here than I expected and certainly more fruit flavor than Kabert, which was also a surprise. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is really a dessert in the glass, displaying a perfect balance between sweetness, hops and roasted barley. The finish is long, tenderly bitter and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very pleased with Belgian stout. I think a few years of age has rounded things out nicely. At 13% abv, this is still a beast of a beer. Nice slightly bitter finish. Well done."
""
""
"Would buy again if I could find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Basically one of the most solid stouts out there."
""
""
"O Nice big hoppy stout in a little bitty bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a true pleasure to drink. The sour not is a little odd, but doesn't hinder its drinkability. A great imperial stout that I hope to drink again."
""
"O: One of my favorite tasting stouts. I will be searching this one out in the future."
""
""
"O - The alcohol is too well hidden, which is made more apparent by my inability to type. I have wanted to try this for a long time, and I was lucky enough to stumble onto two bottles at my local store. They're a bit pricey, but I'm glad I found them. I had this one ""fresh"" and I'm going to age the other one for a year or two."
""
""
"O- An excellent beer, has some nice complexity of flavors and a richness that I really like in stouts."
""
"overall a solid stout. no complaints love its simplicity"
""
""
"O- At first I thought this might be a bad bottle, but the other bottles of Cuvee Delphine/Kabert all had the same chalkiness and weren't overly flavorful. Overall I wasn't that impressed and there are a lot of better stouts out there. Perhaps drinking Kate the Great right before kind of ruined it a little bit. I'd like to try it a little bit fresher and see if that makes a difference."
""
"O: I don't know why I didn't have high expectations for this beer but everything but the aroma was pretty freaking good. Really solid taste but I wish the flavors were stronger but I'm surprised I didn't have to age it to get rid of the alcohol taste. Furthermore the mouthfeel was one of the best I've had. I would definitely try this beer again and I recommend you try it."
"Black Abert pours a thick, viscous midnight black with a big and creamy, dark mocha colored head. The nose is rich and smooth. There is plenty of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream, and not a hint of alcohol. Upon your first sip you noticed how full bodied this beer is, and just like it should be. The flavors are very rich and very well balanced. It features a nice, nearly perfect amount of roast without resembling coffee at all. It has a great chocolate aspect that merges the flavors of both dark and milk chocolates. While not the most inquest descriptors this beer nails them. You can tell that this beer is big but don't get any of the 13% alcohol that this beer boasts. It's really pretty remarkable, especially this bottle is fresh. I can see this one aging gracefully. Overall this is a fantastic beer and a great representation of the style."
""
""
""
"A pricey brew, but one that won't let you down!"
""
""
""
"O- Eat a rich and delicious 85% chocolate bar, while drinking Kona coffee and sucking on cranberries while sitting in a stall at Saratoga Raceway... that's it... and it's perfect! The ""subtleties"" will slap you in the face... and the ""in your face"" tart/manure/cocoa notes will KISS you gently and make you close your eyes and forget where you are! If you've been searching for a RIS with everything you want, and even things you didn't know you wanted... it's perfection in a glass!!! Who knew tart poop and chocolate went so well together? I don't want this glass to end! DAMN!!!"
""
""
""
"A very good beer - pretty darn tasty. Rich and fruity, with a lovely Belgian twist, especially in the nose."
"Very dark brown/black appearance. Aroma has raisins, figs, and caramel. There's definitely some alcohol present in the nose. The taste is sweet and very malty. It kind of reminds me of a Thomas Hardy ale or a J.W. Lee's in that sense. Some of the high alcohol content becomes apparent in the taste especially as it warms up. It's a good beer and I might try one again with some age on it to see if that calms the alcohol down, but only if I can get a good price on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Black Albert delivered. Smells a bit hot, but really nice stout aromas. Drinks pretty damn smooth and balanced for 13%. More sweet than bitter which is my personal preference. To be honest there isnt much that I can find wrong with this beer."
""
""
"Drinkability : a very nice beer in the style Russian Imperial Stout. The 100 IBU ! are hidden behind alcohol (13 ABV) & roasted malts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: June 2007 Vintage (BA No. 14)"
"O: I am surprised, the high (13%) ABV is extremely well hidden making this beer much easier to drink than one might have expected form the ABV on the bottle. Almost feels like a hybrid between a Russian Imperial Stout and a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Complexity increases as the beer warms up."
""
"Poured into my DFH tulip from a bottle I picked up in maine a year or two ago (can't remember, I have two bottles from two different trips!). After deciding it's about time to drink down my cellar I figured I'd start with this. Pours a jet back with little to no head (though I poured slow because of the sludge at the bottom of the bottle). Smells like belgian candied sugars with a hint of booze, very nice. Very good taste, quite bitter from the 100 IBUs and not as much of an overpowering booze aftertaste as I anticipated, just a very well balanced imperial stout. Another great beer from de struise, just wish I could get them here in VA!"
""
""
""
"Pours nice dark black with a solid mocah sheet of loose bubbles. Smells of chocolate, date, nougat, graham and hints of licorice. Nice nose. Flavor carries leather, tobacco, dates, figs, brown glazed molasses, some bits of dark plum and a hint of toasted graham cracker. Slightly thin body and low carb with a semidry finish. Nice beer, I would drink a bit of this on tap at the right price. The alcohol is surprisingly absent in the beer despite the hefty 13% marking."
"Overall - A really great hybrid of BSDA and stout. The fruit flavors blends extraordinarily well with the deep chocolate roast. The booze is forgiven for this quality of flavor."
""
""
"O: A great beer. I was expecting a lot from it and don't know if it really lived up to the hype, but it is well made and full of flavor. Definetly would recommend, especially if you prefer sweeter stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O - Sweet with a porter-like body."
"O: A very good robust RIS. Perhaps a little more sweetness in the taste would be good, but other than that this is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"First time cracking a bottle, would not seek this out agaim."
"Overall, very good. Not sure how far out they put the best before date, but this one clearly has a few years on it. Perhaps that is what has made it so smooth. It is a very nice beer but the thing that is most remarkable is how hidden the booze is- I just can't believe this beer goes down as easily as it does."
""
"Decent, though not as good as the hype led me to imagine. Fruity and boozy - a daunting concoction. I was expecting there to be a more obvious roasted malt character with a defining bitterness, rather than the sweet fruitiness that is actually present. Both the aroma and flavour lacked something undefinable; the result was a well-constructed but sub-par RIS. Worth trying, just lower your expectations a little."
""
""
"O: What a unique brew. It tastes like a quad blended with a RIS and an english barleywine (all that sweet molasses) and then aged in a wine barrel. I don't know what to think, I've never had anything like it. I prefer my RIS to be super roasty and creamy. This beer definitely straddles some lines when it comes to style. You would honestly not expect this to be an RIS at all if you tasted this blind. It's still very complex, well balanced and tasty. Just a total hybrid style that's hard to judge. Super dangerously drinkable, I will say. Smooth as all get out."
""
"D - While this is undeniably a unique brew, and a very interesting concept to approach an RIS with, it's not quite my style. That being said, I can't imagine an RIS with a Belgian twist being any better than this. True to its Belgian roots, this brew is rich, fruity, and not overly abrasive. I suppose I just prefer a more roasty and astringent profile with my imperial stouts. In the end, this probably wasn't worth the premium price, but I'm really happy I got to try it. While it didn't quite live up to the hype for me, it was still a very unique experience. Thanks to De Struise for crafting this one-of-a-kind brew!"
"Black Albert ranks among the best off-the-shelf RIS. Always happy to pop one of these :)"

"Can't say I hated it. It is very different; their own style. But it doesn't do it for me. However, I got to try it, and check it off my kist."

"Drinkability â€“ This is an amazingly drinkable beer for 13% abv. The alcohol is well hidden and it goes down easy."
"O: Overall this is a very complex Russian Imperial Stout! Very smooth and hides the 13% ABV very well! I will be looking for more of this in the future! Thanks again Barry!!!"
"O. A fantastic RIS here. Very fruit forward and complex without being over-the-top or cloying. The 13.0% ABV is hidden very well. The traditional chocolate and roasted malt notes are abundant, but the fruit presence takes this in a new and interesting direction. Reminds me quite a bit of KtG. Definitely a keeper here."

"An outstanding beer with lots of complexity and fantastic flavor."

"330ml bottle. Oversized glass. Enjoyed on aprÂ´12. Black color, crowned by a thick, small bubbled, lasting head â€“beige in color- & lacing collars. Toasted coffee, hints of chocolate, figs & floral fragancies to the nose with sugar hues. Involving sweet toasted malt flavor & gentle warming sensation in mouth. Velvet palate. Slightly bitter finish overwhelmed by ripe dark fruits. Brandy notes. Full body, soft carbonation. Fruity & warming aftertaste. Mandatory beer to understand what a Russian Imperial is!!"
""
""
"O - an interesting beer that is a bit different for the style. Definitely not as Belgian as I expected. It does have an interesting lemon aspect that you don't expect for a stout. Worth a try because it's different but not world class."
"Overall: I might actually prefer Black Albert to Cuvee Delphine; though I haven't done a proper side by side and have only drank the latter in the wrong context. Either way, this one will not disappoint."
""
""
"Moderately full-bodied but not viscous or particularly chewy; medium-low carbonation. Overall very creamy and smooth. I really enjoyed this flavorful stout, itâ€™s a bit of a change of pace with its reserved Belgian influence. Very easy to drink considering its very high ABV. Definitely wish I had a few more bottles."
"Beer is medium-bodied with gentle carbonation that creates a foaming, but rolling effect that makes this very pleasant on the palate initially. Ethanol heat felt from mid-palate through close, in nostrils and throat. Closes with a spicy ethanol burn on the back of the throat. Finish is expectedly dry, but a bit sticky from the sweetness contained in the beer."

"O - A sipper of a beer. If you're not open minded and expecting something else then you won't like it. From what I gather, this beer should be aged and I could only imagine it'll get much better."

"Overall: This is a very nice beer. Impressive (lots of flavor, well-hidden alcohol, well-balanced sweetness) and enjoyable. Not quite as excellent as Struise's Pannepot, but close."
"*Allow this to warm to room temperature for full enjoyment."
"D - It would be very easy to get bent out of shape on a beer that hides its alcohol so well. Finesse and a clever touch are present everywhere. They are fast becoming my favourite brewery."

"O-> A tremendous beer. I didn't even realize I had a five and a half year old beer sitting in my cellar until after I opened this. having never had a Black Albert, I am very impressed. Quite enjoyable. Perfect thickness, not syrupy and the alcohol is melded perfectly. Great example of the style with that unique Struise twist. Chalk up another ""Highly recommend"" from this guy...."
"Overall: This beer is better than your average stout. It just seems a little bit off though. Nice beer. I should give this beer a try when its a fresh batch."
""
""
""
"pours out a flat dark brown, no signs of a head, just some faint bubbles on top. smell is mostly dark fruits with hints of chocolate and some belgium yeast. taste is different, but good, not your typical ris. taste is more like a complex wine at this point. no signs of roasted malts, coffee or chocolate. just a funky sour dark fruit almost wine like taste. mouthfeel is ris like, full body, creamy yet oily. this is a weird beer. definatly worth the try, and would probably drink again if i could get a fresher bottle to try. this one says it's batch no. 14."
""
""
""
"T: Lots of dark fruit and espresso, some rye bread, raisin, black licorice, charred malt and some hints of milk chocolate. Really complex and it only gets better as it warms. The mouthfeel is slick and velvety without being too syrupy and the beer hides the alcohol like a champ. Highly recommended."
"O - a very good example of the style."

"O: A world class beer by any standard. Truly original in character, a brew that I eagerly look forward to drinking again."

"Overall a very well done brew. Not my favourite style of beer but you can wake me up for this one. It is just a shame I spilled probably 1/5 of the bottle... It is too expensive and rare for that."
""
"Big on fruit and chocolate â€“ delectable. Tangy with cherry and blackcurrant, rich with espresso and port, savory with walnut and rye. Delightfully rich and powerful, yet somehow restrained and balanced. Oily and tight on the palate, a good mouthfeel to convey such a masterful harmony of darkness and light. An impressive, exemplary, and worryingly drinkable imperial stout."

"O - fantastic. an incredibly interesting and flavorful beer. the bold flavors meld seamlessly with the subtler notes making me wish i had more of this. A truly great beer."
"They didn't have it in stock when we visited Ebenezer's, but I finally broke down and purchased the bottle from Teresa's fridge. Split between myself and the wife, I poured my half into an Ebenezer's snifter, and her half into a Pinocchio's tulip glass. The beer poured out a thick, oily black, with a pinky finger of chocolatey brown head that receded to a mere ringlet, leaving a few trails of lacing behind. Smell was booze-heavy, with notes of cocoa and dark fruits. Taste improved as the temperature rose, with a blend of dark roasted malts, molasses, rum-soaked dark fruits, charcoal, and hints of dark chocolate. Pretty complex, but still a bit more thin than I'd expect overall, so I felt the full range of flavors didn't completely come out like it should have. Medium body, and pretty drinkable, but not as good as say, a DFH World Wide Stout...not that many things are."
"A wonderful, complex, big RIS. A joy to drink, particularly because of the rich mouthfeel."

"Really delicious beer; absolutely lives up to its reputation. Must try for any beer fan."

"O - Finally got around to cracking the much hyped Black Albert. A very interesting beer. The Belgian yeast mixed with the big stout flavors make for a thought provoking drink."
"This is a very good dark beer. It pours black. There is chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol in the nose. It tastes as it smells, a balanced mix of coffee-like bitterness with chocolate and alcohol, yet very drinkable. This beer has a solid mouthfeel, but it is not extremely thick. Very good, and I am looking foward to drinking the other bottle I brought home."
"One of the best Belgian stouts, definitely."
"Overall, a good RIS that Iâ€™m very happy to have had the opportunity to have tried. Not a phenomenal, mind-blowing item, but definitely enjoyable and approachable."
"Interesting stout with a very well-integrated tart component."
"O: This is a very solid, enjoyable sipper that I imagine would be great for a cold winter evening. While I do like this beer, I am left with the distinct impression that it is substantially overrated (it only moved me to an overall impression of quite good as opposed to amazing). This is one that is sure to please the fans of bitter, hoppy stouts."
"Can't wait to try the others from De Struise."
"amazing the carbonation level if this is an 07. seems pretty fresh to me except the chocolate and dark malt rule."
"O- This is a definitely a well-made stout, really enjoyable, nice complexity, and easy drinking especially since its 13% abv."
"First time i had tried this one, been on my radar for a while, and just scored 2 through 2 trades over the last week. Aggressive pour produced a little off white head that quickly diminished. The smell had that traditional RIS smell of dark fruit, little coffee, and definite alcohol presence. Taste was a little sweeter than i like for a RIS, but in no way unpleasant. The mouthfeel was the weirdest part of this beer. I hold all RIS to CCB Zhukov standards, black albert was just very thin feeling, almost felt more like a brown ale. Just didn't blow me away this one. I'll let the other one i have sit for a year or 2 til i come back to it again."
"Cheers!"
"Pours jet black, solid ring of tan head, retains at edges, no lace really. Smell is full of roasted malt, chocolate, hints of coffee, dark sugar, bakers chocolate, something similar to soy sauce, lots of fruity notes as well, dark fruits/berries. Taste is big and roasted/burnt malt, lightly sour the funkiness is no doubt the work of the yeast, almost lactic if the malt bill wasn't so dominate, touches of alcohol but far less than I expected, bittersweet chocolate, moderate bitterness. Medium carbonation, smooth and full bodied. Really drinkable but I stuck to slow sips here, not exactly what I was expecting but was still very good."
"Overall, this is an unusual and fantastic stout that I am gratetful to have tried for my 1 year BA anniverary. But there is more to come!"
"I liked it, didn't love it, but it is a solid brew. Thanks Alex."
"Overall: Overall, this one's not bad. Lots of complexity here, which one will not find in a run-of-the-mill imperial stout. As I mentioned above, though, there is a lightly tart component, which I didn't really appreciate. If this one were ~$5 a bottle, I'd recommend trying it. Definitely a great beer, but the $10 price tag prevents me from purchasing again."
"A huge RIS."
"O: Overall, quite a damn good brew. Right up there, and maybe even passing up Beer Geek Brunch Weasel as my all time favorite RIS. Awesome aroma, and a complex and delicious flavor profile. The one drawback is the price, running $10.50 for an 11.2oz bottle. That, combined with its limited availability will make it something I donâ€™t drink often, but when I do Iâ€™ll be sure to enjoy it. A must try."
"1398"
"O- Very delicious beer which is just getting more complex as it warms. Amazed at the lack of alcohol presence. Seems like 4 years in the bottle has served it well."
"O: Simply excellent"
"Overall this was a slight miss for me, but I think it could be a batch issue. I had one of these the other day where the roasted bitter maltiness was tamed by the dark fruits, but the burnt, acrid flavors dominated my palate and the entire beer here, not even the dark fruitiness from the Belgian yeast/malts can save this over-the-top RIS monster."
"Overall: This is quite a letdown. A sourish, not very roasty RIS with Belgian yeat notes."
"Pours jet black with a brown-ish head. In the aroma, chocolate and alcohol. In the taste, chocolate, dark fruit and a small alcohol burn at the end. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol and hint of coffee in the aftertaste. What a great stout!"
"O: A flavorful stout with surprising drinkability for such high ABV. If you love chocolate and coffee in your stouts than you'll love this."
"Amazingly full body and somehow dry. No presence of the high alcohol content, not hot just perfect. Really such an exceptional beer = period."
"Dark brown/black body, opaque, no visible carbonation. Dark brown head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing. Some chocolate in the nose, dark, balanced by faint vanilla notes and assertive candi sugar notes, and surprisingly very little hop aroma which evidently faded after aging. Taste is pretty complex, chocolate, a wee bit of chocolate, burnt sugar/caramelish sweetness, if anything the hops are fairly floral at this point. The resiny hops became noticeable once the beer got close to room temperature. Mouthfeel is well on the full side of medium, like chomping down on a good brownie, slick, pretty sticky finish. Wow. Whether it was the De Struise yeast or the barrel aging, this was a very nice, tres complex beer. Dope."
"Overall, this was an outstanding beer. I was lucky to find this bottle locally, I don't think Shelton Bros. distributes in Washington anymore. Hopefully that will change soon."
"O- Very complex RIS and appealing to all senses. This is what I was looking for in Belgium or the Netherlands. But I must say it needs some aging because I bought it straight from the brewery. It felt like it was still to young."
"Overall this is a very interesting beer, i like the belgian style spin. Alcohol is very well hidden. Definitely an artisinal beer, glad i had the opportunity to try it!"
"O - A bold brew and certainly not for the faint of heart. A great tasting brew and glad I picked up a bottle before I left Alberta."
"I've had the pleasure of this beer a few times at Ebenezer's and I'm glad that my girlfriend bought out Nikki's of their BA stock. Hooray GF."
"Quite bitter with dark fruits galore. Pretty good, but fairly overated, IMHO."
"O- A lot of detail in this beer. I like that this is a big bold stout, but still had subtle nuances of Belgian origin. Very complex and appealing to all senses."
"O - This was a stellar stout in my opinion. One of the top Belgian beers I have had, and that says a lot. This is definitely more than I was expecting from a Belgian RIS. If Black Albert were more readily available to me (and somewhat affordable), I could see myself frequently drinking it. Definitely want to have it again, and would recommend to snag one if you see it."
"O-Unique to say the least. A great beer that everyone should try once, though I don't think I would cellar it more than 5 years or so. There's a hint of tart oxidation mid-palate that suggests this might start falling apart over the next year or so."
"Notes: Over-hyped? Maybeâ€¦ But not to the point of making it detrimental. This is a great complex stout worth enjoying if one is into this range."
"O - I'm glad I ordered this, but I was surprised to see I traded all of my bottles away except for this one when I dug into my cellar. This beer will be a good memory not for just being a good stout, but inspiring me to keep a cellar inventory."
"terms of the 13% ABV and the fact that it's going to be hard for anything else I open tonight to live up to this."
"pour is like a RIS but would have to say that it sort of dwelling in the interesting in between of a quad and a ris that i love so much as a night cap. there is a equal part of chocolate and coffee and dry roastiness with a hop drying quality as there is complex ester of dark fruit and pollen. there is a tad meaty and a hint of sour note that are quite subtle. sour like coffee is acidic... sour like plum. nose of forest fruit and coffee. beautiful head. wonderful balance and a mix of two worlds of beer. abv totally undetectable but think in this case that could be something that is not letting out some constituent in the nose. it does open up for about a half an hour though."
"This hides the 13% very well. Good flavors, and my glass was empty before I realized it. Wasn't the world changing stout I was hoping for, but a very good one nonetheless."
"This is certainly a stout that errs on the roasty versus sweet side. I thoroughly enjoyed the earthy yeast and wood character that is not present in many of its counterparts. Overall, this is an impressive beer."
"Overall: I think there's too much sweetness here. Could be toned down a bit. Also could use a bit more hops to balance out the sweetness."
"O - Great brew, wish I had more than 33cl to enjoy. Only reason I rated this a bit lower overall is because the other versions with this base are much better IMO, Coffee Club, and especially Mocha Bomb."
"O - Really enjoyed this. The strong earthy and slightly burnt flavors would prevent me from having more than one in a sitting, but this was a great RIS."
"O - Very drinkable considering how much alcohol is in here. The flavor is very full and rich, but doesn't become too sweet or too much."
"Overall this is one of the best stout in the world. I would like a little more sweetness as well as some carbonation but other then that it is near perfect."
"It's my second sampling of De Struise's brew (Tjesuus being the other one) and what can I say, seems like this brewery can't miss. Highly recommended."
"O - Just a really odd and unique stout. I think the Batch 0 is a notch better than the later batches. Just seems to be a bit more integrated. I can't imagine this improving with age though. 4.0/5"
"Split a bottle of this with my Grandfather who's name happens to be Albert. I felt that it was a fitting situation. This brew poured out as a deep thick looking black color. The head was pretty big at first but settled pretty quickly. There was a pretty good lacing along the glass and some oily brown tinge on there too. The smell of the beer is heavily roasted and had a pretty strong booze aroma too. The taste of the beer is rich with dark chocolate and roasted malts. The other flavors are a little sweetness that fades into a burnt bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel has a good thickness to it that coats the mouth nicely. Overall this brew is impressive. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"One of the beers I forgot in my mother basement for a couple years and I was stoked when she brought me my stash for my B-day. I could see this one improving for years too come and I could see it sitting on some shelves for a few more years here in Alberta at 13$ a 330ml. Great beer but be prepared to bust the bank buying a bunch more to age"
"Overall â€“ A good beer that hides the alcohol quite well. However, I would prefer a BCBS over this to be perfectly honest, which is both cheaper per bottle and more readily available by me. Cheers!"
"O- I find Black Albert to be a very tasty RIS. It goes down easily and tastes better and better as it warms. Alcohol is masterfully disguised by the complex tapestry of flavors woven into this offering from De Struise."
"Pours an opaque black color with a 2 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Nice thick rings and dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, dark fruits (raisins/plums), and bittersweet cocoa powder. Taste is surprisingly somewhat sour. Dark roasted malts, cocoa powder, and dark fruits coming through on the finish. There is a slight soy sauce flavor that comes out as the beer warms. Very mild roast/cocoa bitterness on the palate quickly fades after each sip. Good level of carbonation with a silky and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS from Struise but the sour flavors I get from this one threw me off."
"O: A dangerously tasty beer at 13%! Not overly heavy, but has a great flavor profile. Could drink this one all the time."
"D: Very easy to drink despite being 13%ABV. In fact, as it warms up it only gets better. I look forward to seeing how this one tastes down the road."
"Taste is bitter and viscous, with a hint of tartness and coffee like flavors. Beautifully carbonated, particularly for a beer of this ABV, the finish has a bit more of the roasted malt acidity. This is an outstanding beer, one that I wish was more readily available in these parts."
"Cheers"
"Overall, I think this beer is falling victem to being in the wrong catagory. I am judging this as an RIS but the brewery calls it a Belgian Royal Stout... The thing that really sets this one apart from the RIS crowd is the sourness. I feel that this beer needs its own subcatagory because this is a one of a kind beer to me. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and you sure as hell could have fooled me that this was a 13% abv beer. I highly recommend this beer despite the A- avg that it carries. Very pumped that the liquor store by my gf's apartment carries this. Plan on drinking many more in the future."
" A rich, full bodied imperial stout, with great drinkability."
"33 cl bottle. Batch 14. Pours a pretty dark black that is a lighter cola brown at the edges when held up to the light. One finger relatively dark tan-chocolate head that has pretty good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big molasses and licorice. Smells sweet with a little bit of coffee, but not much roast. The taste is very sweet with a lot of licorice and molasses. The alcohol is pretty strong as well. Not much else. The sweetness tends to dominate everything. Light bitterness on the finish. Medium body. It does manage to not be syrupy for how sweet it is. Low carbonation. The beer was overall just too sweet with nothing to balance it out for it to be enjoyable."
"Batch 14. Pours as one of the most beautiful stouts I've ever seen. Pours a dark black with an AMAZING brown-tan head that is nice and frothy. Scent is VERY boozy with some lovely espresso and vanilla aromas. I also get some dark chocolate and toffee... Oh wow, this taste is genuine. Such profound alcohol and coffee flavors, blended nicely with chocolate, dark fruits, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is where this beer shines the most...oh so creamy and full-bodied. Just magnificent. Drinkability is fairly high for such a high ABV beer. Overall, this beer is pricey, but worth it IMO. It's an awesome imperial stout!"
"Enjoyable, but at almost $1 an ounce, this one has many more options of comparable quality at a much better price, which takes its overall score down a smidge."
"I was excited to try this, but really let down. Way out of balance."
"O - Nice and smoth. I ate a brownie with this and they paired perfectly."
"Overall, one of the best stouts out there, IMHO. I will always keep an eye out for more, and will eventually see how the ones I have are aging from year to year, Probably only gets better."
"Cheers!"
"Plain and simple; this is a super beer!"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. Much better than normal Black Albert but can't say it's a favorite of mine. The flavors aren't amazing and in my opinion the yeast clashes with the typical stout flavors."
"O: This was ok. It isn't great and overall sort of weird, but there isn't anything wrong with it. Is it worth the price it goes for? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall fantastic. Definitely a top 5 all-timer, and probably top 2 for the ""style"" whatever that is. This honestly tastes nothing like most american ""russian"" imperial stouts. Fruity in the way that a quad is fruity (must be the belgian yeast strain). At any rate, seek this beer out. IMO De Struise makes better beers than Westvleteren, and they're actually relatively accessible."
"O: This was my second try of the Royal Albert and it definitely lived up to it's name sake. Though some might not dig the tart cherry and belgian flavors, I think it's a welcome change. I'd definitely try to get a couple bottles if the opportunity presented itself."
"D. A beer clearly designed for sipping. This is certainly an interesting beer, but I don't think it diverges enough from an RIS to be considered its own style (Belgian Royal Stout)."
"Absolutely phenominal! Reminds me of Rochefort 10! Rich, smooth, dark chocolately velvet wrapping dark cherries, plums and currants. Roasted coffee sways through it with a tiny hint of smoke. The taste follows the nose of dark chocolate, toffee, sweet malts, and dark fruits. complex! Earthy notes, and a hint of smoke. Velvety smooth like liquid chocolate. Thick, dark, black, oily with a great pillar of head that has great retention and beautiful sea foam lace! Only beaten by the Rochefort for hiding the alcohol better."
"I have another bottle that I will let sit for a while. Can't really see that it will go to a personally more enjoyable place beer-wise, but I'll take my chances."
"D: This is a very good beer, it is very smooth (for 13% ABV) and well balanced, between the sweet and roasted malts. As mentioned above, the 13% is not unnoticed, but it is only slight."
"O: overall a complex beer that reminds me of the Rochefort series with the sweet fruit flavors"
"Pours black, creamy tan head with great retention, legs but not a lot of lacing. Nose of dark fruits, some raisin, port qualities, vanilla, chocolate and brown sugar. Taste has a complex interplay of dark chocolate and this dark fruit/port character, that suddenly takes on a roasted and coffee like flavour about 2/3 of the way through the mouth. Dark fruit returns as it finishes and lingers. Dry finish. Solid and full feel to it. Well constructed and very nice overall. My first from De Struise."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is so rich in flavors that the only way to drink it is slowly and in small sips. Taken on those grounds its very drinkable and Iâ€™d not hesitate to have another, but on another night. The richness is almost too much. My overall impression is of a nicely made beer that pushes the extremes of what a stout is. So Iâ€™m glad to have tried it but it is definitely a beer for a once in a while treat."
"From my limited experience I have thus far surmised that Struise is a brewer of truly world-class beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, good variation of style, this is a nice beer to sip on for a long time if youâ€™re in the mood for a high-octane Belgian stout."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and creamy but not as heavy as expected. Overall, Black Albert is a top notch beer, which I really appreciate having a Belgian twist on the style."
"D - excellent RIS. Easily drinkable, extremely flavorful. The surprise in this beer for me was the lack of extreme bitterness that you often find in a RIS. It's not cloying at all though, without all that much sweetness up front. I'd call this one a ""roast bomb""."
"Impenetrable black under three fingers of dense, persistent tan foam. Initial aromas of jam-like fruit coated with a nice layer of chocolate. Sticky toffee, hazelnut, and whiffs of licorice and wood...any roasted maltiness has really smoothed out to a bittersweet, fruity dessert. Tastes of fig, raisins, and plums alongside dark chocolate and berries. There's a good amount of roastiness before the smack of a somewhat acidic sourness in the finish. Very easy to forget this one is 13%. Creamy, rich, lightly tart mouthfeel. A very interesting RIS."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel with a great resonance of flavor. An exceptional beer that would age gracefully for years. Absolutely divine."
"Thick black beer with some tan hues. Large fizzy brown colored head. Lot's of carbonation. The bottled spewed all over my floor when I opened it. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and bananna. The combination smells much better than it sounds. The flavor is very rich and complex without being too strong. In fact it's the smoothness of the beer that impresses me the most. Dark chocolate, black coffee, Belgian yeast flavors with some tropical fruit like hoppiness. The mouthfeel is thick yet velvety smooth with lot's of carbonation. Great beer. Worth the price imo."
"13%? could have fooled me. Easy to drink, incredibly complex. $11 for 12 oz bottle. Won't pass my lips again, sadly, but loved every drop."
"Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who loves Imperial Stouts and Belgian beers."
"m/d - as smooth as humphrey bogart but heavy handed on the booziness. Leaves a soft tingle, but the chocolate coats my mouth so it is almost like eating one of those booze filled chocolates. The chocolate richness is fantastic, but this is a sipper. As with all of these huge beers...once the alcohol warms you, you don't notice it as much and the flavor really comes out without distraction. this is a great beer...just hot as hell (although the label says black as hell)."
"Verdict: With minor flaws and a hefty price tag, this is a tad below top tier, but its wonderful and worth finding."
"overall: this is definatly an interesting beer. lots of classic RIS qualities with something else thats hard to find words for. a good try for sure, i would recommend it."
"EDIT: this is 13% ABV? Damn. +1 on the drinkability. It had me fooled. I was guessing around 10."
"glassware: trois pistoles goblet"
"D: Very drinkable, especially for a beer of 13%. Personally, I think it could pass for 9%. Glad I have another bottle in the cellar."
"D: I would love to try this back-to-back with some of the most coveted RISs in the biz for a taste comparison. On this particular occasion, I felt that this was the bomb diggity!"
"The hassle and anxiety of hoping my order makes it from the Struise online website was worth it for me. I'll have to save up and do a larger Order next time to really make it worthwhile."
"D: The alcohol is entirely hidden here; a great feat for a 13% ABV beer. Both the high quality of the flavor and its complexity have made my glass interesting to the very end. Only wish it wasn't so expensive, then this could be a staple beer in my fridge."
"Medium bodied, with smooth tiny-bubbled carbonation. Nicely balanced, easy to drink."
"Batch 0, poured at right around cellar temp into a snifter. Poured an impenetrable black body with a HUGE milk chocolate colored frothy head after a semi-vigorous pour. Just like a good Belgian ale, the retention was superior and lacing was great. Smells like dried plums and raisins with molasses and vanilla. Burnt caramel, bitter chocolate, and earthy aromas round out the nose. The taste is largely the sweet sugary fruits at first, followed by the acidic cocoa and coffee flavors expected in a stout like this. Interesting characteristics from the Belgian yeast strain used, somewhat spicy. Very clean and balanced flavor profile, but rich and complex with bold flavors. Feel is about as thick and heavy as I'd expect in a RIS, but carbonated like a dubbel or tripel, which lightened the body a bit. An all around exceptional beer, and it lives up to every bit of hype it gets. Now I'm really curious to see how Cuvee Delphine compares."
"Wow this one was fantastic and what an easy going drink for the high alcohol content.Superb suiting."
"D- This is by far the easiest drinking beer I've had of this strength. Extremly hard to put down. A sipping beer this was not! It just kept getting better and better, had to adjust my score by the end."
"This beer has a bit of everything, and melds them together in truly spectacular fashion. I'd get this JUST to experience the exquisite texture and drinkability, but the fact that it offers up world class aromas and tastes takes the cake."
"Drink- Very good indeed. A belgian sweet treat that was highly drinkable with a huge ABV. A very good beer."
"Drinkability is quite good, especially for a 13% brew. Alcohol is felt but not noticed in the flavor profile. A treat for sipping, especially as the temperature is dropping outside. Don't really At $10 for a bottle, I can't afford to drink this often, but it is definitely worth having again."
"D - 13% ABV is big but don't let that stop you from grabbing a couple. This is a great brew and very drinkable."
"Recently got a few bottles of ""Batch 0"" and I must say, this is one hell of a stout. The mouthfeel is much improved, with a silky, weighty texture and fine carbonation. Noticing more hops too, odd for a beer this old. It's amazingly drinkable for a 13 percent impy. Easily the best Belgian-made stout out there. Bumping this one up from a 4.25 to a 4.5."
"batch '0', meaning already aged for almost 6 years now,can't wait to try.... Pours and extremely black colour with nice dark brown head. Smell is dark chocolate,roasted malts and some dark fruits.taste is very much chocolate,malts,some dark fruits and some coffee bitterness in the end. Medium carbonation,very smooth. This one is even better than the fresh one!"
"33cl bottle, Batch ""0", ordered from the Struise Yeast Shop. Pours a jet black with a huge tan head that recedes after a few minutes. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a little alcohol. A bit heavy on the palate with average carbonation. Flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, and a little bit of hops. The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer. This bottle is pretty fresh, but I think it would be better with a bit of age on it."
"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer. It is an interesting take on the RIS style. Not mind-blowing, but this is definitely worth a try. On another note, it definitely seems like it would mix well with Kate the Great, but I doubt I will ever encounter Kabert."
"Not my favorite imperial stout, and that nose is ""wowful", but worth trying, and definitely interesting/different."
"Cheers"
"Bottle. This little guy has been in the cellar far too long and it is now time to try it. Lot B6BB, whatever that means. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a very large, fluffy tan head that is rather slow to dwindle down. As the head settles out enough for me to stick my nose in it, I get whiffs of dark fruit, dark bitter chocolate, and in the end some notes of booze. The head finally dies down, leaving an abundance of sticky lace on the glass. The one concern I have with this is that both in the nose and the taste there is an almost mild sour apple smell and taste, but really no other indication of infection so I think this is how it is suppose to be (?). The flavors are really blended quite well though and this is pretty smooth for a 13% beer. Starts of with dark fruit and slightly sour apple flavor that smoothly transition to a mild roasty flavor. Ends with some lingering bitterness. Overall, this is rather enjoyable even with the strange apple smell/taste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Overall: Perfect, except for the mouthfeel. Seeing as this is the only ""Royal"" belgian stout i've had/heard of this is purely amazing. Highly reccomended. If you see this, pick it up. It's worth a try, even at 10.95 a 12 oz."
"D - if it were cheaper I would have one every night out."
"The CPJ"
"Overall an excellent drink, my all time favourite beer by far (so far, out of about 30 beers. edit: after 325 beers, this is still true) however I could not drink alot of it which is perhaps a bonus due to the price tag! Yes, definitely I will purchase again when I have some money to spare and want something decadent."
"D - 13%... whoa... no freakin' way... very well hidden and I could see myself having no issue what so ever finishing this one and if I had another it would be hard to hold me back."
"D- For 13% ABV it goes down really easy. I won't even call it a sipper. This is a great and really worth trying. The only thing is was disappointed by was the complexity, I was really thinking this would be very complex being a RIS and Belgian."
"Poured from 330ml bottle (batch #14) into tulip glass. The enormous light brown head makes this beer hard to pour. Underneath this mattress, a fully sedimented almost black liquid. Its aroma strikes as immediately vinous, fruity and sugary with its molasses, fig, licorace, anise, vanilla and sharp alcohol tones. So, fruity and vinous. While there's a fair dose of hops, they mostly serve a balancing purpose, never really becoming major in the global character. Instead, its dark malts impart a powdery chocolate feel that reminds of mocha and the malts are sweet to boot. Its vinous side includes a fair bit of acidity, but the roastiness remains restrained enough for any clash to be encountered. Beautiful lacing. A complex, very sweet, medium-full bodied, heady offering that is a sipper indeed, but to me not quite a top offering even among Struise's product line."
"D- Wasn't expecting this after reading some other reviews. Couldn't get past the boozy taste pretty much. Liked what little flavors I did get. Maybe one day I'll try it again and see if I get something else from it."
"Overall I couldn't drink a bunch of this. It's tasty but I think I prefer a traditional IRS type yeast to the Belgian take on it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The body is slightly over medium with quite a bit of carbonation. It seems like a lot of De Struise beers have this feel, but I'm not sure it works perfectly with imperial stouts. Still, not bad. This is a pretty drinkable beer. It's a different take on an imperial stout, but that's not a bad thing."
"Cheers.."
"D - Very enjoyable and aside form the surprisingly sneaky 13% I would definitely buy this and drink this more."
"I love this beer!"
"D - Kind of a boring RIS. The variable in reviewing a RIS from across the pond is that conditions make a huge impact on the beer. This beer may be great in Belgium, but it doesn't hold up well in travel."
"Pours a dark jet black with caramal foam forming in a brandy snifter. Tastes of dark roasted malts and chocolate, with a hint of dark fruits in there too. Honestly, its a little on the hot side with the 13% alc. I was hoping for more from this big stout. But the flavour isn't wowing me away."
"I am very happy I was able to try this and would definitely do so again, it was very smooth and easy drinking for 13% ABV."
"D - You can certainly tell this is a strong drink. The alcohol gives you a bit of a bite in the aftertaste, but quite enjoyable."
"D--This is pretty fresh, it could use some aging. I really enjoy this beer, Highly recommended, though the price tag tends to make this a rare treat. Great brew!"
"Not very drinkable. 13% and sweet. Does not make for a drinkable beer."
"A good flavorful stout. Not exactly what I look for in a stout but its well made."
"drinks pretty well. definitely boozy, though not terribly harsh, with a plethora of flavors that keep me sipping and the 330ml just does not seem enough."
"Picked this up at City Beer in San Francisco. Pours an opaque dark brown, as close to black as you can get. Very thick brown head, great head retention. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of huge roasted malt, with caramel and some faint chocolate. Lots of bitterness in the taste, still sweet though because of the huge malt. Alcohol doesn't seem to be in the taste, which is surprising. Smooth mouthfeel. Amazing stout."
"Bought @ Beer Planet in Brussels Belgium. For 6 euro this was a great steal. No shipping, no nothing, just walk next door from my hotel, buy, cool, crack open and enjoy. Deep black and what is expected. I am not a huge stout guy, but I had to drink this when I was there and it was fantastic. I actually drank 3 of these and should have brought back some extras, but oh well. A stout lover would really enjoy, and since nobody is going to read my post and either buy or not buy, I am through...."
"This beer has a ton of flavor and aroma. It hides it's 13% abv very well and is quite drinkable. However, each sip should be savored. It deserves to be drunk out of your best snifter glass."
"D - A touch boozy, but overall a nice beer."
"Picked this up at an awesome beer store outside Ghent, Dranken Geers. Deep, dark brown, almost black pour with a slight reddish tinge. Gorgeous three finger coffee colored head and excellent lacing. Earthy, roasty malt and booze dominate the nose. I'm also getting some coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The taste is much the same. The roasted malt and alcohol are dominant again, with lots of cocoa and dark fruit. The hops are overpowered by the sweetness of the malt, which hurts the balance for me and imparts too little bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent, but leans towards being a little syrupy. The sweetness hurts the drinkability for me. That coupled with the booziness makes this just an average beer. I have to admit that it did get better as it warmed, but I don't really understand all the hoopla with this one. I'm a big De Struise fan, but this was disappointing..."
"Huge roasted malt flavor balanced out by subtle dark fruit notes, spice and alcohol warmth. Hints of chocolate and caramel along with toffee, espresso bean, licorice and oatmeal. Subtle hints of dark fruit along with sweet alcohol heat that creates a nice warm finish. This beer is dangerously drinkable considering the high ABV. Very well balanced with a dry hot finish. Excellent but definitely a sipper. I know a lot of people aren't into this beer but I think it definitely lives up to the hype."
"Notes: Really good on a cold night with some hearty food and a light sweet dessert. Drinkability is a 3 because while one of these goes down quite handily over an hour, having a second one is just about out of the question considering that its 13% abv."
"Mouthfeel is huge and creamy. I thought this was going to be flat given that the head was underwhelming, but it's thick and has the perfect amount of carb. What a beer - this is easily the best stout from outside of America I've ever had and probably the best dark beer from Belgium I've ever had. Killer stuff, buy on sight when it's up at Struise Webshop!"
"Overall this is a pretty impressive beer that can be enjoyed by both stout lovers and those who aren't as fond of the style."
"D= Very drinkable if enjoyed like a fine scotch. Sipping gingerly the 13% was noticed quickly."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I can't believe this is 13%. I would have put it more in the 8-9% range. I really like the quad-like qualities that come out in this stout. A bit pricey, but I may pick up another one down the road."
"Overall I am pretty pleased with this offering. The mouthfeel is a little overbearing for me but otherwise it's very good."
"D: Drinkability is good. Hey, 13% is hard to make drinkable, but Black Albert definitely hit the mark."
"So let's say A- for the Black Albert and A+ for the Batch 0."
"Been waiting to grab a bottle of this. Pours a black color with a tan foam head. Has an aroma of dark fruit and chocolate with hints of citrus. Sweet and creamy from the dark fruit, then the gentle carbonation kicks in with some nice roasty maltiness. Finish citrusy sweet. Some chocolate notes on the finish. Very excellent brew."
"D= The thin mouth on this leads to huge drinkability. This is such an up and down beer as far as the rating categories go but it is still amazing. One of a kind beer that I have never and possibly will never have anything like again. I'm happy I found a spot that carries these because I'll be going back for more that for sure."
"D - How could you turn down another one of these? Packed with flavour and the alcohol doesn't make itself all that apparent but still shows up to class."
"I am surprised, Black Albert actually lived up to my expectations, superb beer and one I'd love to have again."
"Ultimately, I don't get the hoopla behind this beer (or this batch). While focused and well-structured, it's ultimately not that interesting. Cuvee Delphine, OTOH, is where it's at."
"D - This is definitely drinkable, but i don't want to ""drink"" it, i want to sip and savor it for as long as possible. For a 13% high abv, it doesn't burn at all. Has a slight warming effect, but again is extremely smooth. Someone else said it well, this beer blurs the line between Quad and Russian Imperial Stout. The cost is a bit prohibitive, but really, who cares with so much awesomeness going on."
"For such a bold brew this brew is ridiculously smooth and drinkable. The grain is heavily kilned and leaves a lasting roasted dark flavor residing in the mouth with each sip. There is a moderate bitterness that equally matches the solid alcohol presence. Full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. If I haven't said it enough already, this is a very drinkable beer. Despite any hesitations about infection issues or variance from batch to batch, you gotta give this one a try."
"Big thanks to Lunch and nyrangerfan for sending a bottle each of this as extras in past trades! Lot B-6-BB per the bottle. Served from bottle into a Delerium Tremens snifter. Poured pitch black with a three finger fluffy tan head that very slowly resided to a one finger. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, molasses, alcohol, and a sublte sour note (infected?). The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, molasses, sugar, alcohol, and a very very sublte sour note. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Was it infected or not? Maybe a little bit, but to be honest it didn't really kill any of the flavors in the brew and also helped to cut down on the booziness quite nicely. This brew infected or not is definitely worth trying for sure."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability -- Blurs the line between Quad and Russian Imperial Stout. Very interesting. Has the hallmark burnt malt flavor of Belgian Russian Imperial Stouts along with estery Quad qualities. The Belgian RIS to beat for certain."
"D - Overall, this stuff is good but I really dont think its worth the price point. Now that I've tried it, I dont really think its worth all the hype, either."
"drinkability: not nearly worth the hype and price. worth seeking for anyone who likes RIS..."
"overall: I am glad I got to try this its a very good beer I would like to have more roasted character to this beer. thats my only complaint."
"D - Surprisingly good considering it is 13% ABV. A very different stout, but done exceptionally well. I have no doubt I will be going back to this one soon."
"D: Eh... pretty good. One is enough. Overall, this beer rocks."
"O - This one was pretty hyped, and while it didn't quite live up to that it was definitely a nice beer. If it weren't for the price and rarity I'd drink it a lot more."
"This one is a highlight reel bodycheck to the taste buds."
"Just an incredible beer. I have not been crazy about the other De Struise beers I have tried. This one set me back about $12-13 for 330ml, and I put it away for a couple years (has a best before of April 2013, so I think this is about 2.5 years ago). The wait was so well worth it. Exceptional!"
"Drinkability is surprising for such a big stout. Even with the alcohol burn the abv sneaks up on you."
"D: What a treat to have this on tap. Very tasty and highly recommended. It is 13%."
"Smooth, creamy, medium bodied, and the carbonation is a little higher than I would normally expect. Overall, this is a nice beer."
"D: The taste is flat. Carbonation and mouthfeel team up to hide the 13% almost completely. If you like the taste, then drinkability will be good for you."
"The taste has notes of berry, toast and slight sugar with a hint of vanilla and toffee, mild cocoa elements and slight sweet currant and bitter coffee with a mild candy sugar accent and alcohol tinge. The beer is a good drink, a 'Royal Stout' that is best in small quantities which is why the 11.2oz bottle size is perfect, I don't think it is great because the alcohol could be more hidden, but it certainly is enjoyable."
"One of the greats."
"Considering this is a monster of a stout, it's very drinkable Glad I have another one of these for later."
"Drinkability: My first thought is to just say moderate due to the weight and ABV, but the flavors are so complex and good and wonderful, that I would forego the oncoming intoxication and sip on this all night. I really wish this beer was available to me on a local basis, but if anybody is looking to trade for it, I would say it's well worth it."
"D: Overall very well done RIS. Easy drinking and super flavorful."
"It has a surprisingly good and extremely dangerous drinkability. It comes on with some sticky feel, and pretty thick, but it's pretty smooth, a nice dry finish, and drinks remarkably well for 13%, as it seems more like an 8%er."
"D - Not a touch of the alcohol comes through in this beer but it is fairly rich making it a decently drinkable stout. Better split for sure."
"Fantastic brew."
"Another winner from De Struise, I need to track down more of their beer..."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being on the lower side. Drinkability is very good, it's a fantastic imperial stout. It had such a range of flavors to it but managed to be very balanced overall. I also really liked the smokiness that came through in it. Excellent beer overall."
"Surprisingly, this isn't exactly what I'd call an ""intense"" RIS; it's just ""full"" of everything. I'm pretty sure this is the best RIS I've ever had - no exageration and I've had quite a few."
"As a side-note, any beer that uses artwork from www.beautifulfreaktattoo.com on it's label ... is an insta-win. Can't wait until the other bottle gets done sitting around getting better for 2 years."
"D - Every now and then you come across a beer that is hard to fault ... This is one of those. We need a Belgian Royal Stout Category as well because this beer is in a league of it's own."
"D: Definitely a little different from a standard RIS, but oh man is this one good! One of the easiest drinking beers out there that contain this much body and flavor. I can only wish this bottle was bigger (and cheaper) so that this glass can never end."
"I've had Black Albert only once before, but this is much, much better than that bottle. Less of the quad characteristics, more of the stout. Worth seeking out. If Struise releases more Batch 0, I will be all over it. Highly recommended."
"This is stout number two from the young brothers and based on comparison with the bourbon aged Cuvee Delphine I do prefer the whiskey aged monster. It might have been the traditional Flemish surroundings or the four or five beers that I had before it but the Cuvee takes pride of place as the best Flanders stout I've had thus far."
"D - Pretty awesome RIS. The more I drink it the more I like it. Nice notes of chocolate and coffee and a a bit of a warming boozy feel as it goes down. I haven't had any of the later batches of this but I hope they can come close to this one."
"I think this might even be better than the bottles from the original release. Which potentially are the same thing, I guess."
"Have to be honest I let some of the anti-hype concerning this beer convince me it might be a dud but it's actually interesting and suprisingly drinkable."
"D: Amazingly, at 13.00% I'm getting no booze whatsoever. It's going down VERY smoothly! This is really nice---not a big, syrupy RIS but the dark fruit presence melds nicely with the coffee/chocolate."
"I cant drink a ton of this stuff and Im not quite sure it's worth the price of admission but it's a well crafted stout that strays a bit from the 'sameness' of most rizzes out there. The belgian yeast and slight quad aspects will throw you for a loop."
"D: Can't even detect the 13% alcohol level. Very drinkable and quite balanced and flavorful."
"Well this is definitely the best, and most balanced stout Ive ever had. I really do like the coffee and chocolate stouts, but this stout is something better than that - complex yet highly drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a fairly thick viscosity and a head that is tightly beaded and light brown and lingers quite awhile. Smells like a fairly typical Belgian stout, but with quite a bit more licorice notes, and some marzipan as well. beyond that, its got the typical subtle roastiness and spicy/sweet Belgian yeast notes. Rich, and with the same notes found in the nose. There is licorice, cocoa, some light roastiness, some Belgian yeast notes, and a touch of grainy sourness. It all comes together very well. The mouthfeel mis a bit dusty, and then opens up and becomes more vinous. Smooth and slightly viscous. I enjoyed this, but probably not quite as much as the hype machine would have me do so."
"D: With almost no hints of the alcohol presence, this beer drinks very well. I am very glad I made the purchase, and if it still remains on the shelf I may pick up one or two more. Simply an outstanding example of this style. Very dangerous as well, with the high abv but a very enjoyable beer."
"Not too bad overall. Boozy and bitter though."
"3.5 D: Pretty good beer. Interesting taste with a great smell. Average mouthfeel. However, I doubt I'll have this again because the $10 price was nowhere near worth the size and quality of the beer."
"Poured a very dark brown with marron highlights that had a half finger of brown head and left nice blotchy lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was quite nice consisting of chocolate malts, roastiness, lacto notes, dark fruits, slight spice, and underlying coffe notes as well. Upfront the chocolate and lacto characteristics jump out first alongside roastiness, dark fruits, slight coffee, and spice accents, the brew was full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, and creamy finish. It drank really good considering the ABV but its not one of the beast RIS that I've had either. Overall it a good beer and worth trying for sure."
"Jet black pour with a very dense and frothy, 1-finger, brown head. The aroma is bitter black coffee with lots of roastiness and subtle notes of dark fruit, candi sugar, and brown sugar . As the head slowly fades, strong high percentage cacao dark chocolate notes come out. There is a slight metallic, noble hope tinge in there too. It's all very soft and mellow though. The flavor is much more powerful than the aroma but still with all the complexity. The dominant flavor is strong, spicy, bitter dark chocolate. Lots of espresso also blends with caramelized sugars, raisin, dates, and molasses. Generous hop bittering and some notable alcohol finish it off. The body id full and oily with lots of tingly carbonation and alcohol warming."
"Bottle from the 2010 batch, pours black with some light coming through the corners, and a spotty tan head. Nose is focused on a nice Belgian quadrupel yeast and has some charred, ashy elements of an imperial stout. Very light roasted coffee and maybe some cherries. Flavor is an interesting mish-mash, more roasted malt than in the nose, of course that smooth Belgian yeast, and some bittering influences rising up in the finish. Bitter coffee perhaps even some hop oils rising up there. Pretty nice, kind of zesty and bright, but the flavors aren't focused as they could be, so while tasty, it's kind of unfocused."
"This is a wonderful brew! I just wish I didn't have to travel 350 miles to get it! It's everything an RIS should be, and more. Not coffee...not chocolate...sort of enigmatic. 13%...yup, it's in there! It's a cornucopia of malty goodness and well hidden alcohol. IF you smell it close up, you will smell the booze, but, it's highly drinkable. If you're at Ebenezer's, don't pass it up. One of the best beers on the menu!"
"Overall, a pretty well balanced big beer with a lot of complexity. The tart fruitiness seemed a bit out of place to me and was very distracting."
"At 13% the alcohol is deadly hidden and when combined with all of the other outstanding characteristics makes this extremely drinkable."
"M&D - smooth and complex, flavorful, well done RIS, this one is worth trying at least once"
"Wow. I recently had a fresh Black Albert in a bottle and thought it was great. This however was mind blowing. It had all the flavor characteristics of the Black Albert I had but it was was cooled down. The big fruity dark cocoaness with the belgian yeast must was there. But the alcohol was present but not nearly as overwhelming."
"D - A fantastic beer, although I don't think it has the same revisit value as other top imperial stouts. Nevertheless, a must try for fans of both stouts and Belgian beers."
"Lives up to the hype, not that this is the most hyped beer, but it has its followers for sure. And if Batch zero is even better, I'm really looking for the right day to crack one. I also have extremely high hopes for my Cuvee Delphine."
"Pours a rich, dark black color with only a faint ring of brown head. Scent is very vinous with notes of dark fruit, chocolate, coffee and tobacco. Taste is more forward of the dark chocolate and coffee, dark fruit rounds out the taste along with an earthy quality. Both scent and taste are quite complex and offer different angles on the beer. Medium bodied, maybe a touch thinner than expected from the bold flavors, but still smooth. Overall a great tasting beer, that if it wasnt for the high price, would be a regular."
"Very sweet and thick, malty with a bit of booze but it's pretty subtle. Sweet and drinkable. Better than the bottles I've had in the past. It's much creamier and more palatable I felt like some of the older vintages I had were a bit harsher."
"Overall, this was very much a wow beer. Unique flavors, but without deviating too much from the stated style. I think I'll snag a few more and see how they age..."
"As with a lot of imperial stouts, this Belgian 'royal stout' is very much a sipping beer. I can only imagine this getting better if aged as the alcohol harshness was very present."
"Very impressive brew. Too strong to drink more than one at a time, but a great one to savor. Get it if you see it!"
"A winner in my eyes, but of course there are naysayers."
"D - Very drinkable, almost surprised at how good it was to me. Read the reviews and maybe my expectations were low because many reviewers rated this between a RIS and a Quad. But this was top notch IMO. The heat if any was well hidden if any, but would still classify this as a sipper."
"The best stout I have tasted to date."
"Pours a one finger tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving traces lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Molasses and chocolate nose. Flavor is sweet and bitter molasses. Dry chocolate finish. Tastes better than the first tap at Ebenezers Pub in Aug 2007. High ABV is completely hidden. Way overpriced at $10.99 for a 330ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Was recommended this one at the Charleston Beer Exchange, living up to everything I was told it would be. Wish I could get this one here - but then again with the hefty price tag, maybe not."
"Drinkability is a horrible factor to rate but I doubt I would, or could drink another."
"Overall an excellent beer, but a little less spectacular than previous batches; however, this is still an excellent Belgian-influenced RIS. Very good drinkability for such a big beer."
"Drinkability is good. Nice sipping beer. Tried it because of its notoriety, but becasue of cost and ABV will not be a regular."
"Taste has plenty of yeasty esters to go along with the roasted malt and coffee. Bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder also come into play. Just enough sweetness but finishes quite dry. Carbonation is fine-bubbled with a very nice mouthfeel, although not thick for the style...lets settle for solidly medium. Probably not worth the $11 for such a small bottle, but damn tasty nonetheless. Drinkability is high, the 13% ABV is barely noticeable."
"D: I would drink this all the time if it was available to me. Damn good stout. The ABV is a bit high to drink more than a few if you were so inclined."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Jet black with a thin tan head, slight lacing. Lots of chocolate and dark fruit on the nose, there is also a slight alcohol warmth. The flavor is full of dark fruit, slight coffee, and slightly boozey. It must have a ton of malt to cover its 100 IBU, not bitter at all. It has a pleasant lingering chocolate loaded finish. A full bodied beer that is dangerously smooth, given its 13% ABV. A great beer, but at 12 bucks a bottle very overpriced."
"(D)- A solid to great RIS. Not sure how old or fresh this is, but its a great example of the style. Rich, and a good roasted malt and raisin profile. The ABV gets to you after awhile, but this is a sipper anyways. Been wanting to try this one for awhile and I am glad I did!"
"As with later versions of Black Albert, I canâ€™t really tell if I loved or hated this. It has its good and bad qualities. Maybe Iâ€™m just not a fan of the style. 3.5"
"Not sure if I would pay $1/oz for this to revisit this, but I'm glad I was able to sample it..."
"This is surprisingly drinkable for its ABV. A creamy medium body with a medium to high carbonation is pleasant but not outstanding. Nevertheless, one would be hard pressed to find a more drinkable ""big beer."""
"Not your average big stout at all. Its very interesting. Ill leave this on my wants list. I would welcome another bottle."
"D- a sipper that I would sip on anytime!"
"D- Completely ridiculous. At 13% this should be illegal. No heat at all. Very enjoyable. With the other flavors you don't have to be sitting in front of fire to enjoy this one."
"d - I thought this was a great RIS. I thought it had a great dark fruits smell and the alcohol was very well hidden for 13% ABV. Would love to try it again."
"Overall, I would give this a few more years to ""lay down"" that I think will assist in pulling out more of the complex flavors underlying this beer."
"D: I'm not getting any of the alcohol and this is going down ridiculously easily...excellent beer."
"Mouth feel is very creamy. Drinkability suffers since the alcohol is upfront. Otherwise this beer is well done."
"Been lookin' forward to this guy for some time now. It pours a deeply opaque bit o' black soup topped by a half-finger of dark tan foam. Once this has faded, a nice halo lingers at the surface. The nose comprises raisins, figs, molasses, chocolate syrup, sugar cane, and chocolate-covered strawberries. Pretty nice so far. The taste holds a stark combination of bitterness and fruitiness up front and dark sugar, coffee, and bitter chocolate in back. I've gotta say, the whole taste experience here did not go well. The bitterness and fruit up front knocked what could have been a very dark and tasty stout down a peg. It seems as though a stout was blended with a BSDA, resulting in a genetically inferior bastard child. It wasn't entirely objectionable, but not great, either. The body is a heavy medium, with an active carbonation and a surprisingly dry finish. Overall, the odd flavor combination and bubbly nature hold down what could have been something special. A bit of a let-down here."
"D: Goes down easily for 13%, not much of a boozy kick, but it definitely has a kick. Great RIS! This is a definitely a beer that I will seek out again."
"Poured from a bottle into an Ommegang glass. Dark black color, thick tan head, with lots of sediment. Strong taste of figs with a hint of coffee underneath. This is a very different beer, as it has characteristics of both a RIS and a Quad. At 13%, not a beer to drink all night, but it hides the alcohol well."
"Black Albert stands as one of the finest acheivements in beer that I've been able to try. Though I might just have a natural affinity for Belgian yeast in Imperial Stouts, judging by my review of Boulevard's Dark Truth Stout in relation to the rDev here on BeerAdvocate. Whatever the case may be, Black Albert is a beer that I will marvel at now and in the future. I see myself buying quite a few more of these. This is a treasure that you must seek out for yourself."
"The mouthfeel is the best aspect of the beer. It's well carbonated and nice and thick. Very low drinkability results from a combination of its high abv and its disappointing flavor."
"Great taste, and I don't give a 5 just b/c of the style designation here, although it probably should warrant it. The dark fruit and malt are there, but the chocolate wanes a bit. Great job hiding the alcohol, this is a very easy drinking beer. Short bitterness gives the flavors a jolt of freshness. Nice beer"
"4/4/4/4/4 - B+"
"The label 'Russian Imperial Stout' is quite misleading, maybe 'Belgian Royal Stout' should be a separate style category. Pretty good but not what I expected."
"DB- Very pricey and very unexpected. I dont even know what to say. It is a good tasting beer but feels like someone mixed a Quad and a RIS with wine. It is drinkable for 13% and I will probably try future batches at some point. Surprising..."
" I thought I might've been going crazy to pay $10.95 for 11.2 oz's but with a beer this rightous, i have no guilt. A beautiful and beastie brew for the ages!"
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not too much special here. Ok brew. Way too boozy and roasty than I would've liked. Not really worth hunting down. Many better in the style."
"D: A very impressive beer. Very easy to drink, with loads of complexity, I enjoyed this one thoroughly from start to finish."
" I've tasted imperials similar to this but I've never tasted better."
"D: Generally, disappointed. The flavors were simply too muted and the it didn't finish well. My last big stout was Parabola, which absolutely blows this away."
"Quite dark with swirling head, aroma of dark malt crossed with rubber tires and licorice. Flavor is a bit rough, with some burnt caramel malts. Decent but not as I remember it from a big bottle years ago that Chris Q determined was not perfect and I deleted my review from Ratebeer, but I thought it was very respectable. This bottle is decent, but not stellar like a Alesmith Speedway Stout or even a Yeti or Left Hand Imp Stout."
"D: As this one comes to temperature, the alcohol becomes more noticeable and the bitterness becomes more of an astringency. Not my favorite, but certainly worth trying."
"Recommended."
"The beer pours black into my Duvel tulip, not the darkest I've seen but pretty close. A 1.5 finger milk chocolate cap quickly forms and briefly lingers before fading without leaving much in the way of lace. Not particularly impressive, but for the style/ABV I can't complain too much. The nose is of dark chocolate, dark fruits, and a definitely perceptible alcohol hotness that has me a little bit concerned. The first sip catches me off guard, as Black Albert leads off with a shotgun blast of hop bitterness, with some appreciable citrus notes at the end. This is followed by the dark chocolate and fruits from the nose, but thankfully no alcohol, and the result is a very tasty beer. The mouthfeel could be said to be a little thin, but it's not a big issue, but the beer is definitely too carbonated for the style. Lackluster mouthfeel aside, this beer drinks nowhere near 13%. It's quite remarkable that each sip brings no alcohol flavors whatsoever (which makes me noticing some in the nose even more odd). Black Albert is a solid beer, quite good in some regards"
"Overall - I was a much bigger fan of this beer fresh. I remember it being smooth, mellow, with a nice coffee finish. Now I get muted dark fruits (figs, raisins) with a sour bite at the front. Again, recommended fresh but not with a few years on it."
"D- Not bad to drink just not my favorite. Not sure how often I'll seek this one out. There's just something different about this one."
"It's decadent rich qualities, with the sweet and creamy flavors lend to the drinkability as a dessert beer. At 13% it is deceivingly easy to drink."
"D- Unbeliavably tasty and intriguing. One of the best. I wish this was cheaper (I paid $12 for 11.2 oz) and available in Michigan."
"D - As far as Imperial Stouts and 13% beers are concerned this is pretty easy to drink it is a little warm but the taste is very good and makes up for that this is a beer that if you have the chance to get some you need to get it"
"Drinkability is surprisingly high. I guess I quickly adjusted the the high ABV (which, honestly, is quite clean), and got to enjoying the rich qualities of this Belgian Royal Stout. Suddenly this bottle seemed way to small, even though I was carefully savoring each sip. The price of course is prohibitive, and not something I'll be buying on a regular basis, but it's definitely yet another great beer from De Struise. Really impressed by this beer, especially how it evolved as it opened, or at least my palate adjusted."
"The alcohol is well hidden. This is a really interesting and tasty beer that works really well as an after dinner drink."
"I'm not sure what I expected, beer is smooth, finishes clean. Not too dry not too sweet. Nicely balanced and easy drinking. Some carbonation in the mouth, not roasty at all. Like a smooth quad of sorts. I'm really enjoying this beer. Very very smooth. For 13% you don't notice at all. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This beer is best served on the warmer side. If served too cold it tastes infected to me. Let this one warm up a bit and enjoy what it has to offer. Personally I like the draft version much better, but that can be said for many beers."
"D - This is a phenomenal brew; a paradigm of the Belgian Imperial Stout style, a style which seems currently to be ascending. Plus everything about this day sucked, except this beer. That is worth a lot in my book."
"Overall, a really unique and sweet stout. The dark fruit flavors really come in full force and mkae this unique. Definitely worth the tasting. Certainly memorable."
"One of the best beers on the planet."
"Tastes like a dry stout at the very beginning, moving into a middle of sweetness that's like a blend between a chocolate lambic (assuming such a thing exists) and teriyaki sauce. It's a whole hell of a lot all at once, and all of it is pleasant, but it doesn't really cohere into any singular thing. It's like a big explosion of goodness, which is mostly nice, but sometimes people don't want to explode."
"Bottle sample from Adil. Thanks friend! Midnight black in colour with a creamy, dark beige head that quickly subsides to a thin cap. No lace on this pour. Smell and taste are strong vinous aromas, Belgian yeast, herbal and fruity American hops, dark grapes, red wine, and a burnt grain chalkiness to end. Quite a bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is viscous, velvety, somewhat chewy, dryly parched finish. A unique take on the style, not as roasted, smoky, or bitter as US versions. My least favourite of the four stouts that we tasted, though still a great beer."
"D-this is a delicious brew. I was thrown off a little by the nose with all of the sweetness and yeast. However, the taste was beautifully done and brought a fantastic variety of flavors. Great feel and so smooth!"
"This beer pours a very dark black with a tall head that hangs around and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet with a strong blend of molasses and roast. The flavor was a much stronger than the aroma foretold. Licorice and molasses sweetness upfront. Also notes of dark fruits and a hint of spice that is probably from the yeast, some coffee, dark malts, alcohol. The huge sweetness makes it very heavy on the tongue. The alcohol is huge and the mouthfeel is very thick. The drinkability is ok, but I don't think I could have more than one in a day."
"Very much a sipper. A nice RIS. Definitely more European than American for the style. Glad to have tried, but wouldn't need it again."
"Tastes like a Belgian style Stout. Lot's of great strong flavored fruits up front. The fruits really take the bulk of the flavor, followed by a completely thick, viscous, and boozy mouthfeel. The carbonation is slightly high, surprisingly...but definitely not overkill! Big malty characteristics. Sweet and medium to full body. A great and tasty beer from De Struise!"
"M/D - Rich and creamy mouth that leaves a sugary stickiness on the top of the mouth and tongue. Overall, an enjoyable beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it!"
"Black Albert is strange. Ok, it's really different from your everyday Imperial Stout. If you're looking for something REALLY different in the style, Black Albert could be the cure, but the price and lack of availability aren't going to encourage me to seek a bottle for myself."
"D: This beer is a legend as a it briefly took the No. 1 spot on the BA 100 a while back, but currently is on the outside looking in. This is a very different Imperial Stout, the Belgian influence is clear. Think of an RIS mixed with a Quad 50/50. An intriguing beer, I wish this was available here so I could buy a bottle to go over all by myself."
"O: Very drinkable for a RIS, but seemed to be more like a baltic or Dubbel with more chocolate malts. This is a fun beer as it doesn't fit a style. Check it out, and ride the soy sauce!"
"M/D- Full bodied and chewy just the way i like my RISs. low carbonation. very nice moutfeel, almost silky smooth. good drinkability as well. gonan cellar the other one i have and check it out in a few months."
"D: A truly unique beer that I will always look forward to."
"D - I could sip on this all night. I wouldn't have guessed it was packing 13%. I would recommend this to any BA I know."
"D- Delicious. A beer to savor on a special occasion."
"would not seek out again"
"Need More Like this."
"Taste of cherries, cough syrup, booze. The finish is dry and sour. A very thick oily beer that has an after taste of cough medicine. I don't find it to be as well balanced as the label states. Perhaps some people like it but it's a bit to boozy for me."
"The flavor is super strong with lots of booze, dark fruits, espresso, oak, and maybe some smoked wood. Somewhat sour, but nothing too overbearing. Bitterness comes through, with a long finish. Great beer, but over-rated."
"I can't find any faults with this beer. I really think this may be my first perfect score. I'm going to sit here and enjoy the rest of this beer and decide on what my final score is going to be."
"Overall a nice beer but the downfall of this one is its consistency... Its way way too thin and watery... It tastes plenty rich enough but this has almost a pilsner like thinness to it that's quite off-putting..."
"An excellent, fairly available RIS. This is one of those beers that everyone needs to have multiple times a year. Delicious."
"Poured into a snifter. Pour yields a quarter inch of mocha head with a little bit of retention. Smells of dark cocoa and dark fruits. I get a little bit of roasted malt/smokiness too. Bitter chocolate up front and a decent hop presence throughout. Finished with dark fruits followed by dark chocolate that lingers for a while. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are true to the style. An excellent RIS."
"D: Overhyped, overspiced, and overcarbonated. I understand that this is a Belgian imperial stout but the flavor carbonation and body don't work for me. I won't be having this again. I expect and like coffee and heavy chocolate in my stouts. This one delivers that, but cancels it out with other flavors that don't meld quite right."
"Overall, a good but not great RIS. I waited till the hype died down on this one before getting it and glad I did. It's good and worth trying but doesn't make the top portion of my RIS list. Recommend if you can easily get and not overpay. Rotation - not avail here in TX so got from ummagum. If here, I'd not get another as there are better RIS out there [1x-taste;BOT]"
"Overall this quite an interesting take on an Imperial Stout and certainly one that has many features that make it stand out along with some inherent Belgian qualities that add great depth. Highly Recommended."
"D- A bit too big and too boozy for me to quaff. A small bottle is best split with a friend IMO."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer. I wish there would have been a little more in the roasted malts department as flavor goes but this beer is something that should be tried by as many people as possible. I will look forward to trying my other bottles and hope to trade for more."
"Roasted figs, sweetened chocolate malts, candies, and rounded with peppered lemon bread. Licorice and rum. As this warms closer to room temperature the flavors develop and with 100 IBU's the hops finally kick in. A Sneaky 13%."
"This is a very drinkable 13% abv for the style that comes in an 11.2 oz glass - no doubt because of the amount of hops in this, this is a very drinkable great RIS> I had to restrain myself with sips due to its high drinkability and small botle size."
"ive only had a few ounces of this before but thanks to ottovon i got to savor an entire glass..when and if i see this on the shelf again i will pick a couple up to age"
"This is a night capper at 13 percent ABV. However, the alcohol is not so evident in the taste (until after you drink it), and is balanced by the delectable strong flavors."
"i will have to try another bottle and update my review if needed."
"Poured from a bottle nice and dark and inky. Head was amazing at least 3 fingers tall, and dissipated at a good rate. Smells like a typical RIS coffee, chocolate, malts and fruit. The taste is balanced and no alcohol make it odd. I can taste the chocolate, malts, and coffee. It actually is rather watery considering the ABV. Had a velvety smoothness to it though. I could drink these all night and not care. Mainly cause if I did that I wouldn't remember the next day anyways."
"Bottle. Damn, this is quite the night. Roasted coffee aromas, but not in the american or mikkeller way, a sweeter and meatier coffee. I also get grapes, figs and alcohol here. Malty taste, quite sweet with a yeasty finish. Nice mouthfeel and overall very good beer. Highly drinkable for what it is"
"Black Albert pours with a huge 4 fingers of head that hangs on for several minutes. Through the course of sipping this beer there is always of layer of head on the top that never goes away. It also leaves a thin boozey lacing on the side of the glass. This stout smells of dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, sugar, alcohol and roasted grains with the dark fruit smell blending with the chocolate smell to give this ale a desert like sweet smell. The off putting smell is a bit of oxidation and metallic flavor that seems out of place with the rest of the aromas. The taste is much of the same with tastes of dried fruits and chocolate roasted grains dominating out front. The bittersweet chocolate is a little much and and takes away from the drinkability the mouthfeel is medium and what I would expect from a Belgian Stout. Black Albert is a very good stout and the 13% ABV is hidden very nicely in the flavor. Side by side I perfer the Cuvee Delphine a little more because the Cuvee is a much more interesting ale. Black Albert is very solid and the fruitiness is unique, but its not a stout that blows me away. Good Effort all and all."
"D: I shared this bottle with a friend, but I have no doubts that I could polish off a few of these, which could be quite dangerous at 13%."
"D - pretty good for a 13%. Strong, competing hide most of the alky from the taste, though you can smell it of course. Then again the flavors themselves make this best suited for small doses."
"Overall a very good beer, but nothing overwhelming. For the price point, there are a number of IS's i'd rather have. For being 13% though, its pretty drinkable, but I can't say I would want to have more than one at a sitting."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"D - Does this beer live up to the hype? not quite: Personally, I would desire a bit more complexity out of liquid sex than this beer offered to me. That being said, this was an excellent, assertive version of its style with plenty of roastiness that I feel takes the Belgian Imperial Stout style to a whole new level. Apperence and mouthfeel were fantastic. Not crazy about the price, but very happy with the result."
"Drinkability is helped more by an attempt to grasp the style than by the beastliness of 13%. Overall sweetness keeps this beer from being great, but regardless remains an interesting experience."
"D: This is good stuff. Looking forward to more."
"Drinkability - excellent stuff, worthy of enjoyment fresh or aged."
"Overall - I came in to this beer not expecting anything great. Boy was I surprised on my first sip. I'm hooked. This beer is amazing and it deserves every bit of hype it recieves."
"Pours dark brown to black with a dark tan head. The head stays around throughout the entire drinking process. Aroma is strong on the dark fruits along with some coffee and chocolate as the beer warms. Very complex. The flavor is heavy on the roasted malt, almost burnt in flavor. You also get some more dark fruit and coffee and the beer finishes with some alcohol and sweetness. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"If you like bitter chocolate, coffee (the real one) and beer, this one is for you. A masterpiece from the Struise brothers. A Strong but drinkable one, with unforgettable flavor. An ocean of coffee with bitter chocolate islands on it. A powerful taste hits you. It remains on your mouth like a dark kiss."
"Very tasty beer. Not as complex as I expected, but still delicious and very enjoyable."
"I could drink this 'til I dropped!"
"Poured a pitch black color, with a deep beige colored head, that is quarter inch thick high. The head has tremendous sustainability and clings to the glass. The first scent is the strong fragrance of alcohol hits the nose that is followed by a rich chocolaty fragrance. There is the light spicy scent of Belgian yeast and fruity esters. The taste of dark bread, malt, and chocolate come out at the front. Then a dried fruit flavor comes out, mostly of raisons. That is followed by the yeast spiciness and finishing with a mild grassy bitterness. The texture is thinner at the front than one would expect, the expectation was one of a more syrupy feel. It gains weight as it crosses the palate to have a heavier feel. A unique take on a style with a Belgian twist, the color and aroma are strong and inviting. Each taste brings robust and complex flavors, the only let down would be the mouthfeel. The feel was thinner than I expected, it but takes nothing from this beer. This I must try beer, not because of its limited availability, but its unique and fantastic characteristics."
"While cool, it actually reminds me a little of the fresh Expedition I had recently with more body and less flavour/alcohol burn. If I have this in the future, I will be sure to serve it substantially warmer from the get-go, probably around the 55-60 degree range as that's where the flavours seem to start to peek out."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that lasts. The aroma is awesome. It has a powerful black malt bitterness as well as a complex aroma of roasted and chocolate malts. It's warm with a Belgian yeast character. I suppose that there are a shitload of hop present also, considering it's rated at 100 IBU's. The black malts and alcohol warmth go a long way in hiding it well. The taste is sublime! It's incredibly smooth with a fantastic malt character; warm and toasty. The black and chocolate malts work in harmony to create a true masterpiece. The hops are more obvious in the taste. It's quite a bitter brew which only adds to it's complexity. Lastly is the yeast character. What a tremendous finish. Warmth, malts, hops, and a killer yeast character to boot. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. I love the concept here; a Belgianized Russian imperial stout. This one is in a class all it's own."
"Pours jet black and somewhat viscuos looking. Very nice dark tan head that lasts and lasts. Nice roasted aroma-somewhat licorice and wine like. Outstanding roasted flavor mixed with a deep licorice like flavor. Black treacle/molasses tinge to it. Has a heavy dried fruit flavor. Good solid hop bite to it though not overly done. Slight, lingering sweetness. Very well balanced between all the flavors. Extremely solid mouthfeel-somewhat syrupy and slick. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Lives up to the hype for sure though quite pricey."
"Overall this is an excellent stout, that I would recommend to anyone."
"Picked up a bottle at Bier Temple in Brussels. I'm immediately impressed by the huge boozy dark fruit nose. This is very comparable to a Baltic Porter. In fact, after tasting it I would have certainly assumed as much. As the beer warms chocolate and molasses shine through in the scent but the beer remains dominated by sweet/sour prunes, dried apricots, and currants. The flavor follows - booze soaked plums and raison served over espresso. This one is hot, full bodied, and at times syrupy. Very good beer but not as interesting as I would have guess from the hype. Not particularly drinkable. Too boozy and syrupy."
"Like most anything thats not horrible, I am glad I tryed it...but its not worth what I paid for it ($10) and I will not be getting it again..."
"Drinkability: Thankful for the smaller bottle"
"Overall, this is a really good beer, but it is just so massive and dry. It is filling me up rather quickly. A big time sipper. Very good, but not something I would normally like to drop over $10 on a small bottle. Worth a try though."
"Mouthfeel was full bodied and silky smooth. A nice amount of carbonation. Spot on."
"D- Wow I wasn't expecting much out of this one since I've read so many conflicting reviews of this beer but this is outstanding. Not sure which variation or year I have but this has one of the highest levels of complexity and most interesting flavor profiles of any stout I've ever had."
"An 11.2 ounce bottle purchased at State Line in MD. Uncapped and poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a dark brown color with a good two inches of fizzy, creamy tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of fruity gumballs, molasses, bakers chocolate, dates, figs, slightly sour, prunes, alcohol is hidden quite well here. Somewhere between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation levels. This is a tasty beer, but I find Weyerbachers XIII to be far superior. Good but certainly not worth the price."
"This beer is quite drinkable. It has a high ABV that seems reasonably enough hidden and the flavor is intense but it is smoothed out by a nice mouthfeel and dose of carbonation."
"Overall: I had this beer while at the Trappist in Oakland CA. I have wanted to try it for some time, and was pretty happy to get the chance. This beer was pretty good. It was cool to try a beer from Belgium that is not typically available."
"Pours an extremely dark brown colored body, with a huge foamy tan-brown colored head, lastingish. Aroma of dark fruit, dark grape, fig, and floral, somewhat sweet. Not much roasted notes, but the floral is definitely muted by something. Dark fruit taste, immediately followed by roasted and chocolate flavors. Roasted aftertaste. Dark grape. Like a combo Belgian ale and an imperial stout. Tasty."
"D and overall impression: I'll give this just above average marks on drinkability, the dried fruit and belgian influence is just a little much for me. I'm glad I shared the small bottle with two other guys. Overall, this is a good beer, but nothing to write home about. Would have again, but won't go out of my way for it. Skal."
"J"
"Overall, a decent brew. Definitely not my favorite RIS but it was interesting. Thanks again Chris!"
"Tom and Analise"
"Not my favorite RIS, but definitely worth a try."
"D: Very smooth drinkability especially considering the 13%abv which went down like a 7-8%. Well toned and you never feel the alcohol coming. Amazing drinkabilty considering its relatively high abv. Overall this was a good drink but probably not worth the price of admission $10 for a 12oz bottle. Good but ultimately not that good."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is really really good, showing very little intervention of carbonation but still healthy & soothing in terms of fizziness. The 13%abv. alc. is definitely nowhere to be found, not even in the form of a belated kickback... In many ways, this RIS rings a bell of a young vintage English RIS that shows a good level of staleness and a settled profile of roastiness, albeit with a little bit more yeast presence, while the texture is still ""young"" and not quite to the level of being oily or lubricant. All in all, I find it a truly remarkable and well-crafted strong imperial stout that might NOT be so appealing to those hopheads who crave for their excessive hops even in this rather traditional beer style."
"Simply put, Black Albert was one of the finest beers to have ever touched my lips. I am perplexed as to the reason behind this beer's quick descension down the charts. (I did hear however that different batches taste remarkably dissimilar. This may explain some of the discrepancies.) If you have not tried this beer before, I suggest you to do so. If you have tried it and did not experience what I did, I urge you to try it again."
"D - It is surprising to find that, according to the bottle, this beer weighs in at 100 IBUs because the flavor is all about malt. The bitterness is hardly descernable and it barely manages to contain the sweetness of the finish; though it does a good job of masking the 13%ABV. The nose is pleasant, but a bit mild; while the flavor is quite complex, especially the finish. A nice, big stout that hides its borderline insane alcohol content dangerously well; this is a great beer, but not one that I could or would drink very often."
"MF&D - the feel is kind of off by a long shot. the belgian candi sugar doesn't do this brew any good, it makes too much small scale carbonation. the is necessary, however, because the body of the beer is light, and in order to bump it up to a medium the excess carbonation is needed. a pretty good beer, but not one for which I would again pay a ten spot."
"Some characteristics on this brew were spot on in my opinion, but lacking in others. Still, this was a pleasure to quaff. Thanks, Cameron, for the opportunity."
"D- Would drink this beer every day if I could. It goes down probably to easy for the ABV."
"Drinkability: I must admit, I went in to this one wondering how much would be hype, but am now a believer. A great beer, in all respects. I wish I could get this in Ohio. Or maybe I don't because I would be on my way to buy several cases right now."
"This black bodied beer has a fluffy brown head with great retention and substantial lace properties. Nice aroma of anise oil, cocoa powder, rummy alcohol and oily black malt. The flavor and mouthfeel are letdowns right from the get go. Body is medium at best. And gaseous and over carbonated. Oily feel to it, which is not bad in and of itself, but there's not much substance to it in the mouthfeel or flavor. Roasted chocolate malt flavors with some black licorice and winey characteristics. Tannic astringency is noted as well. I was expecting more out of this."
"Very tasty, good sipper, scary smooth for such high ABV. Thanks to barleywinefiend for pssing this beauty my way."
"After trying this beer, I am now anxious to seek out some more De Struise offerings, and would love for the opportunity to cellar some of this stuff."
"D- Moderate but tasty . I like this beer, it's very good. Worth seeking out... belgian royal stouts kick ass!"
"This beer pours a jet black like motor oil. There is a nice two finger tan head that is present after the pour that eventually fades into a small nonexistent head. There is a good cling in the glass that stays around till the end. The only smell notes I am getting from this is alcohol. The taste is remanisent of a mainstay RIS. There is a subtle coffee undertone which has a mellow undertone followed by an strong alcohol finish. The strength of this beer is nowhere near present as you drink it. The mellow flavor of the beer masks the very high ABV and this could make the beer very dangerous if you were to drink more than one or two. As far as taste goes this is seems to me to be a run of the mill RIS but the strength of the beer is where it seperates itself from other Russian Imperial Stouts. I am happy I was able to have this beer finally but it is probably not something I would trade for again."
"D: It wasn't offensive, but I have no desire to pay $12 for this again."
"D: A tough drink with a heavy pricetag. It is certainly imperial, an ale that isn't afraid to shatter boundaries. Based on that, I kinda like it."
"Drinkability- This is a beast. Truly a sipper, one is more then enough."
"Well, I didn't know what to expect and this certainly wasn't what I was hoping for. Complex, had some good flavors, but also several unlikable characteristics. A bit too light on the body. Nice to try it but I wouldn't make an effort to get it again."
"Drink, 1 is plenty thanks."
"11.6 oz. Deep black/brown pour with a lingering dark tan head. Roasty aroma, malt, light coffee. Chocolates and dark fruits also very apparent. Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit foamy, but not nearly as bad as some other Belgian Stouts, which frankly I have not cared for. This one thankfully, is much better. Flavor is very vinuous, chocolate covered fruits everywhere. Thick and slick, something to drink slowly. A slightly fruitier take in my opinion. Would not make it a regular, but worth trying."
"The black pour, opaque body, and khaki head were prototypical of the style. The head was small and very short lived, which I am sure was the result of the high ABV. The smell was like molter chocolate and very intoxicating. The taste was like dried berries soaked in coffee. There was a up front hint of sourness which gave way to roasted grain astringency. The beer felt simple at first, but after realizing the amount of alcohol hidden under there, I became of the opinion that the seeming simplicity was actually due to the extremely elegant balance that felt so natural. Glided off the tongue after each sip, leaving a chocolate aftertaste. Simply amazing."
"Oily and slick, lightly carbonated. The high APV makes this a slow sipper, but one to savor."
"This one beer that in addition to flavour, really brings all of the senses to play. Pours thick and sludgey, motor-oily, just spectacular. Like a black hole in my goblet. Smell is kind of sweet, a bit boozey, and very yeasty - doesn't really smell roasty or anything. The taste - it's chocolatey, rich and creamy. Smooth, and easygoing. Almost like a beer float, hints of vanilla, anise. Some dark fruit to it,some quad-like notes buried in there. Not a lot of huge roastyness or zomghops, but damn tasty for a big Belgianized stout. Tastes like velvet on my palate. I can see why this is a bit expensive, one of the most easydrinking big beers I've had, and there is no trace of the 13% ABV. Fantastic."
"Drinkability: This was tough for me, because it's one of the most expensive beers for the amount in the bottle that I've ever purchased, but it's been one of the best experiences I've ever had with a beer, through and through. Huge alcohol, almost indiscernible at every angle, balance with the subtleties of flavor and complexity that seem almost unparalleled to me in most other beers. This is definitely worth the $10-ish price tag, especially if you're looking for something worth that price, because more and more often I'm finding I'm not displeased as much as maybe very slightly disappointed with the price to quality ratio these days. Here? Not at all."
"Drinkability: This is an absolutely delightful RIS. It's so well done that there is almost no alcohol taste. Some might see that as a bad thing since it's 13% ABV. I, on the other hand, love the craftsmanship that makes just such an instance possible. This could quickly become a staple brew in my cellar. Can't wait to try an aged one in 6-12 months."
"D: The 13% ABV, while relatively undetectable in the nose and flavor, made itself known as I tried to finish this guy off!"
"I guess if it were $4 or so, I might like it more and rate it higher, but honestly, didn't enjoy it and felt cheated."
"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a thick tan two inches of foam that recedes at a glacial pace. This is a very nice looking beer. The aroma is roasted malt, and graham cracker. For a beer that clams to be 13% ABV this is a very weak aroma. I would actually expect more aroma from a 5% ABV oatmeal stout. The taste is more of the same, but with a harsh alcohol presence. A hint of alcohol is something I would except from a beer with so much alcohol in it, but here it seems to be a major part of the flavor instead of something in the background. Again, this taste is weak. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a huge disappointment. This beer is simply poorly crafted. Good beers with high alcohol content have the high alcohol content so they can have stronger aromas, and stronger tastes. This beer seems to be strong in alcohol simply to be strong in alcohol. I can't see myself ever being in the mood where I what to drink something strong and flavorless. But if for some reason I find myself in that mood I think I would head for a a malt liquor, and save twelve dollars."
"All hail Black Albert! A dark dark soy sauce color with a thin head. It has a sweet smell with hints of fruit and coffee. The taste of this one is amazing, the best part being the signature De Struise Belgian-style sweetness that I think makes this stout exceptional. The mouth feel is very slippery yet nice and thin and easy to sip on. I have tasted great Belgians and great Imperial Stouts and this seems to be a hybrid of the two making for the most unique and delicious beer I've had to date."
"Taste very interesting. First things I'm getting are the belgian flavors coming through. Hints of plum, figs, and other dark fruit flavors as well. Then those typical stout flavors shine through with lots of burnt roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. But some how these two different blend together to make a very interesting beer. Can't wait to try the Pannepot later."
"Poured a deep rich chocolate, almost black, left a creamy head, had to wait a minute or so until the head subsided to finish pouring the bottle. The nose was of a sweet coffee aroma, taste had the flavour of roasted malts and roasted coffee, and somewhere in there a sweetness of fruits, perhaps cherries. Mouthfeel was creamy goodness running over the palate. A very tasty Stout, and worth drinking every last ounce!"
"Overall a really interesting and unique beer. I loved the Pannepot so much and while this is very good, it's not to that level. Extremely special and worth a try."
"black pour with a thick khaki head. Aroma has strong grapes, green apple, and sugar. Flavor is very complex. I got chocolate, tofee, tannins/white grapes, green apple, light hops, tobacco, and cherries. Finishes lightly sweet, oily. A bit of alcohol bite rounds it out. I was expecting a bit more, but it was a pretty good try."
"D: If I had to describe this beer in one word it would be unexpected. There is nothing overwhelming, but very unique tasting. With its medium body, it is very drinkable, but this is definitely a nice sipper."
"This is a very nice, big beer and I'm glad I got to try it - but I don't feel the need to run out and get more the price."
"I am going to age the other that I have."
"For all the hype (it is Top 100 after all!) I was certainly expecting a little more. It hides the alcohol well and certainly drinkable but all in all - a little bit of a let down (especially for the price!)"
"The appearance, though, is great A midnight black on a moonless night with a large mocha head that leaves a lot of lace on the way down. Its how a big stout should look. The nose is quite sweet, with toffee and treacle upfront, with the roast underneath. Flavours are full and satisfying, with cocoa, treacle, anise, and vanilla dominating, and the roast being far more subtle than I expected. The alcohol is still evident in the finish, but not to the detriment of the beer. Moderate body and restrained carbonation. Decent, but perhaps not the greatest I've come across."
"This is a monster of a beer. One I think would benefit greatly with some age. Though it is stll a very enjoyable beer. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a pretty good RIS, nice balance, and great flavor. I will be buying this beer again."
"Pours a dark, almost opaque brown, with a light tan head that isn't that impressive in head or fullness and disappears rather quickly. Aromas of roasted coffee, rich plum, and dark chocolate. The taste starts out with a mix of sweet dark fruit and coffee and hints of coffee, with a roasted malt finish. I was expecting a fuller body from 13% alcohol, moderate carbonation. I was expecting a little more from this beer given some of the hype around it. Not a bad beer I just don't think it is worth the price tag, many other better strong stouts out there"
"Drinkability is a different but enjoyable stout with a Belgian influence, want to think merlin48 for sharing this one with me."
"I was impressed by Pannepot, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll have to try more from these guys. Cheers."
"Unique, enjoyable, sweet and fruity but balanced with a roast and incredibly smooth for such a big beer."
"This is the second time I've had this beer. I don't get it."
"Drinkability- Can't even detect the 13% alcohol level. Very drinkable and quite balanced and flavorful. Not the best RIS I have ever had, but among the best."
"D - The high level of tastes and alcohol make this is areal sipping beer, so I can't give it super-high drinkability marks. However, it is superb."
"Pours ultra dark with a HUGE stiff dark brown head that resists fading like an ice cream sundae. Sheets of 3D Belgian lacing left behind every mouthful. The really good; licorice, molasses and a hint of chocolate...a supporting role as opposed to the star attraction. The mouth feel is nicely carbonated, somewhat oily with a tang of alcohol. Full flavored, the nose is repeated in the taste. A nicely balanced licorice/molasses blend. Coats the tongue well and adding a mild roast malt note behind. The 13% ABV warms some but is not distracting. A really fine beverage...highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Highly Drinkable - not heavy. I highly recommend - it is unbelievable. Quite possibly my favorite beer I've ever had."
"Taste is dry up front with baking chocolate, burnt caramel in the middle, warming alcohol on the finish. Bitter aftertaste detracts somewhat from the overall performance. The balance of the IBUs and malt hides the 13% remarkably well but is still a sipper due to the size. Enjoy this for it is a rockstar and knows it."
"Most beers don't live up to the hype, I've gotten used to this. So as I purchased my 10 dollar, 330cl bottle, I was not expecting anything that revolutionized beer to me. It happened anyway. The big kicker on this beer is the thick and creamy mouth, it really brings together all facets of this wonderful brew into an orgasmic package. Dangerously drinkable, the chocolate and belgianesque funkiness really play like best friends here. My words do no justice, believe the hype."
"Drinkability: Pretty good overall. Probably way overrated when you consider the onslaught of fives that it originally got. A great beer though."
"Seems to have influences of a Belgian tripel with the candy sugars, and of a Belgian IPA with the hopping. Very interesting and complex, but not one of my top ten stouts."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass. Only got about 2-3oz, as I was sharing with a few friends. Body is a deep dark black with garnet highlights, topped by a dark tan head. Aroma of chocolate malt, a light hoppy bitterness, and some sweet dark fruit. Palate has a strong raisin component up front, along with bittersweet chocolate, dark malt, and a whiff of bittering hops. Lingering raisin sweetness lasts for a while on the finish. Body is thick, rich, and creamy, but not oily. A thoroughly enjoyable offering from a consistently great brewery."
"Very nice RIS. 13% never makes itself known. Very smooth for a beer of this strength. Maybe expected a bit more body. I traded a Dark Lord for this. Would I again? No. But I'd definitely drink it again."
"An interesting take on the style and worth a try, but to me it lacks complexity to match its big alcohol bite and bitter finish. Would certainly improve with age."
"Big thanks the Wildone for this CanBIF5 treat!"
"D: This is actually a pretty easy drinking 13% brew. I am constantly reminded it is 13% when I take a whiff, but otherwise its not that bad in the other categories. It goes down pretty easily and the warmth is rather comforting. If I had a 750ml bottle, I would be more than happy to tackle it. The flavors are nice and just a touch different from your typical RIS, which is always nice. Good brew."
"The mouthfeel is superb, smooth, not too heavy and very well carbonated. The beer is surprisingly light and crisp for a stout with this kind of appearance and there is no alcohol present in the taste. This is a very drinkable beer and I wish I had more than one."
"The more I get to have this beer, the more impressed I've become. This is delicious stuff."
"Drinkability - A little bit of heat and rather rich, but still very drinkable."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, heavy, thick and chewy. The body of the beer is heavy and thick. The finish on the beer is full and pleasant. I have been waiting to try this beer and I am very pleased with. I really enjoyed this beer a lot."
"Served in my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' First Anniversary Party. The beer lives up to its name, it is black as night. There is a tan head that settled to a thin coating that lasted until all the beer was gone. It has a roasted malt smell that I rather enjoyed. The first thing that I noticed about the taste was a chocolaty sweetness, followed by roasted malts (of course, this could be more from the aroma than the taste) and a bit of caramel. The beer is 13% alcohol and you can taste it and feel it's warmth, but it isn't overpowering or distracting; in fact, it's quite nice. The beer has a heavy body, but is very drinkable. You don't want to consume this one too quickly, even though it is tempting. This exceptional beer should be enjoyed slowly. Seek out a bottle as soon as possible, or just head to Ebenezer's Pub and get it on tap."
"This poured a nearly opaque black with tan head. It smelled like dark chocolate and prunes, with some creamy vanilla and grape and a hint of coffee. It tasted like bitter dark chocolate and sweet prunes, with some roasted coffee with cream. It was somewhat thick with mild carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had an interesting smell and flavor. It tasted very clean and masked the alcohol disturbingly well. It had good body too, but not as full as desired. The prune/grape character really threw me off and kept me from loving this, and there wasn't much depth or complexity beyond that. Definitely an enjoyable stout, but it didn't quite seem to live up to the hype."
"Poured in to my Portsmouth Tulip glass. The apperance was very surprising as I expected more of a dark belgium look and taste to it. The beer poured a very thick and black color with a serious amount of Head. The head was a light brown color and helped releas allot of the aroma. The aroma was mainly a sweet chocolate and dark fruits. The thickness of the brew was actually decernable from the aroma. The taste was a very thick stout that was a welcome surprise. Again I expected something totally different and was pleasantly surprised. The taste came threw with allot of chocolate and dark fruits in the background. The carbonation level was a perfect level and helped lift allot of flavor in the brew. The only down side was this was not a larger bottle that I had....Will be getting more later in the future. Must have stout."
"Drinkability - Not too bad but at $9.99 for an 11.2 oz beer maybe just once a year. . . maybe."
"D - I like this RIS, but it's not in my top-5. Overall, would drink again if I get more, but not going to search around for it."
"I'm getting through this one pretty fast: it's one to savor, but the flavor's so enticing I want to go back for more each time. I have a feeling the high ABV's going to hit me all at once. I like this a lot, but would never guess that it's a stout: way too much fruit flavor, not much in the way of malt/roast/coffee/chocolate character that I look to in a stout. Don't get me wrong, I really like this & can appreciate it on its own terms, but wouldn't call it a stout."
"good, but not great. oh well. lightning can't strike the same place twice?"
"Like the aroma, huge coffee flavor and really little else. A little malted chocolate and sweet candy in the middle. Heat in the back with nice carbonation. Somewhat of a dry, over-roasted coffee mouthfeel. Alcohol hidden well, but overall too coffee dominated for my tastes."
"33cl bottle. Black with a medium tan head and brown edges. Alcohol, burnt sugars and malt, and oxidized coffee grounds that come across somewhat sharp and solvent-like. The flavor is sweet with a bitter and sharply alcoholic finish exhibiting more of the stale coffee of the nose. Full bodied and a bit slick with medium carbonation. This was a real surprise. Nowhere near the malt or yeast depth that I was expecting. I hope that this was an off bottle because I can't ever see myself wanting this again."
"Drinkability: The ABV crept up on me quick with this one. Beware friends. This was an awesome beer however. I was bordering on 5 in both Appearance and Smell. Very interesting, unique, and delicious. Highly recommended."
"Mouth is thick throughout, enough light carbonation to keep it from being overbearing, quite smooth throughout. In all, a fine RIS, but I'm not sure what all the hype was about."
"this twelve ounce bottle came from Jonmich, thanks for the opportunity. Cool looking label with 4-14-09 written in black marker. Pour reveals a totally black beer, with a huge, billowing, frothing brown heading. Smell is of light cocoa, char and smoke, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is of dark malt, chocolate truffles, dry grains. Body is much lighter than one would expect considering the high ABV of 13%. The best way I would describe the body is as velvety and smooth. Drinkability is good, though this is one to sip and savor. Worthy of the hype? No, but certainly a good stout that I would purchase again. I would imagine the blend between this and Kate the Great that was planned would be very interesting and damn tasty. Cheers"
"4, 4, 4.5, 5, 4 = 4.3"
"D: A very powerful and rather complex stout with an interesting character. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Thinner in the mouthfeel than I was expecting based on its appearance. Great texture, excellent combination of flavors and aromas. There's something in there that's a little unpleasant and reminds me of plastic, but it's not very pronounced and I'm sure it will blow off. Nice, long bitter finish, but not so bitter that you can't taste all the yummy flavors. A really well made beer, albeit expensive."
"Drinkability gets bonus points for hiding the alcohol fairly well, but the heavy roast/meaty notes get to me after awhile."
"Very drinkable, though the alcohol is somewhat noticeable."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel. High ABV make this hard to drink more than one. Is this worth the $9.00? Tough to say... Good beer, but I don't know if it's $9.00 good."
"D: Very good. Gets better as it warms, although it is a bit much to handle that much of. Glad they had this on tap, as I'd really wanted to try this beer, but found it hard to shell out $10 for a 12-ish ounce beer."
"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head and lacing. Right away I'm struck by the long bitter roast aftertaste. The aroma is pure dark chocolate bar. The flavor takes off on the chocolate then hits a bitter, pepper and citrus hop note before diving into dark espresso and coffee roast that lasts and lasts. As the beer warms, the hops come forward with a lot of grapefruit and lemon flavors. And for 13% this beer is recently drinkable. I split the bottle with a friend, but could keep going."
"Man this is an incredible beer. All-around fantastic, one of the best brews I've ever tasted. An experience."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. Perfectly balanced and tremendously enjoyable. This is my third offering from De Struise, and stands alongside Pannepot as one of the most well balanced, subtle, complex and flavorful beers I've ever had. Nearly every sip offers something new. Highly recommended!"
"This is a standout beer."
"Pours black with a thick brown head that doesn't go anywhere. Thick molasses nose. I mean distinct as all get out. Flavor is intense malty molasses with slight coffee tones as well. Robust and hearty. Nice thick flavor that gets even better as it warms. Feel is thick on liquid and carbonation is lower. Very easy to drink, even though it is quite hearty. Could go for way more than 11.2 ounces of this."
"D: The way I've described it above, this has all of the hallmarks of something that's a real chore to drink. Not so. The booziness takes a little getting used to but once you forget about that concentrate on the other things going on here you'll be rewarded. I've been lucky enough to try this on draft and I'd say I prefer the bottled version. Plus, it doesn't hurt that I've been sitting on this bottle for almost a year!"
"D: Extremely drinkable. Never would have guessed 13% ABV if I hadn't read it off the bottle myself. Without a doubt a truly exceptional beer."
"This brew is exceedingly unique, and absolutely delicious. I want more. De Struise rules."
"The beer is caught somewhere between a hoppy American Stout, A Sweet Stout, and a Belgian Double. Though the beer shows slight hints of a Belgian yeast, I expected more Belgian character througout. Maybe the intense hops threw it off."
"Really need to try this on-tap over at Eb's at some point."
"D: Very drinkable. Goes down way too easily. The 2nd best stout I've had to this point next to KBS"
"D= Not at all what I expected. I thought this would have a lot more Belgian character to it and though it was not unexpected, the huge amount of boozy alcohol was a bit much and made this one less drinkable. Still an interesting beer though!"
"Poured a black as fuck with a super huge brown frothmaster of a head. Aroma is of dark fruits and apples. Tastes like a mix of a strong dark belgian ale and a russian imperial stout. Taste is chocolatly and malty as fuck. Just hoppy enough and super yeasty. Feel is smooth and stickey. For 13% alcohol this goes down easy."
"Drinkability: huge alcohol levels knock this category down a notch as this is a true slow sipping beer. But it goes down smoothly and a must have for every BA."
"Pours nearly black with ruby red observable in direct light. Nose is incredible with Black Forest Cake - chocolate, dark fruits, and breadiness. Palate offers a nice correspondence with the nose - chocolate, dark fruit, bready, and some light vinegar/sourness. Finish is slightly chalky, in a good way."
"D - Extremely creamy and delicious. Definitely a different experience then most normal stouts. Worth the try, very good, but theres better out there!"
"D: Despite the ABV this is very drinkable. I could only imagine how much smoother it could get with age."
"Has a creamy mouth feel, with perfect carbonation. Rich and complex. Excellent brew!"
"D: This is a fantastically balanced and tasty stout. Incredibly well done. It's a sipper at 13%, but it doesn't drink like a brew that strong."
"D--HOO boy. 1 and done. Not that it's the beer's fault. It's a KO and you know it."
"I'd love to have more of this as it's great. Problem is, $10 for 11oz (of an uncommon beer) makes this something that isn't for every day. Hopefully a larger bottled version will be more common."
"D- I wasn't loving this beer completely. It was good but I wasn't wanting more than my half bottle."
"So is it worth the price? For $9 a bottle it is pricey but I would buy it more than once as a treat. There is really no other beer like it for better or worse. Taste is uncanny and I feel it was money well spent, will buy more to lay down, I am sure it will age incredibly well."
"D: Price being the biggest issue and a beer this big probably has a tendency to kill the esophagus. Interesting flavor,but not a favorite RIS for me, worth trying from hype."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is on the plus side of medium. The carbonation is low. The alcohol is well incorporated. This is a very smooth drinking beer. Is Black Albert that good? I enjoyed drinking this beer. I probably wouldnt seek this out again but this is well worth the try."
"D: A well done RIS that would be excellent as a nightcap. If I smoked, I would like to try it with a cigar. Is it worth the hype (and price), though? I don't think so. That's kind of my problem with Belgian interpretations of American craft beers in general, though. They're usually quite good. But I can get an American version that's as good or better at a significantly lower cost."
"The beer isn't worth the price but is a delicious must try IMHO."
"Overall: It's just a bit too bitter and too hot for me, especially given the relatively thin body for an Imperial stout."
"Appearance is black tan head that thas at least 1 1/2 finger lacing . Smell has coffee dark chocolate feeling. Taste is exceptional. Mouthfeel is typcial of a high ABV stout but delicious non the less. The drinkfeel is great if you can get your hands on this beer it is highly recommended !!"
"Pours an opaque black with a large tan head that leaves tons of lacing. Aroma is a bit subdued, but coffee/dark chocolate and a bit of a belgian yeast smell, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is intense. Sweet molasses is the stand out. Dark fruits and huge bitterness balance. Huge viscous mouthfeel and an almost astringent aftertaste from massive bitterness. This was a treat. Like nothing I have tried for many reasons. Everyone needs to have a shot at it."
"This was so dangerously tasty I feel I could have put back atleast a few before that 13% comes back to bite you in the ass... AMAZING BREW"
"I did my best to regress the blind tasting experience, but even on it's own, this one does not deliver for me. The remaining three will age in my cellar in hopes that time will treat this one well."
"This beer poured pitch black with no head, and little lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, toffee, and a hint of vanilla. Full frontal taste of chocolate, belgian yeast, slight alcohol, with a nice, subtle coffee finish. An excellent brew, and a difficult one to come by. Well worth the 12 dollar price tag for an 11 oz."
"Black Albert, however, undeniably takes the cake. When you're drinking a beer this powerful and unique (not to mention rare and expensive) it should offer you a strong sense that the experience you're having is distinctive rather than mundane. Certainly, the fine people at De Struise accord us just that. Find a special occasion - birthday, holiday, the unfolding of a paper clip, whatever - and treat yourself like royalty. Thanks MasterSki!"
"D: This one is quite hot and needs some time to mellow. Otherwise, the smoothness of the flavors and mouthfeel make this one a winner."
"Wow, what a piece of work. This is a delicious beer, and proof that brewing is art. It's not the best beer I've had, certainly in that ballpark though, but I am just amazed that this beer even exists, because it seems to contradict style while transcending it altogether. At a glance, this is just a real handsome stout. Robust blackness and a healthy brown head of foam. But the norms end there... The aromas coming from this beer are pretty out of this world, roasty, ripe, delicious. And something reminiscent of a can of paint. Some common stouty flavors of licorice, dark roasted chocolate malt, and coffee, combine with a ripe tangy pungency of the Belgian yeast. It sounds like almost too many flavors, too complex, but it all blends together in quite a sophisticated way. It is amazing how light on the palate this beer is considering the intense flavor achieved. If I did not know it to be true, you would have a damned hard time convincing me that this beer is even close to 13% ABV. Every sip I am saying in my head, ""how did they do that?"" ... An enigma of a beer. Belgian Royal Stout indeed."
"A tasty beer for sure, but perhaps a little much."
"This reminds me much more of a Belgian strong dark ale than what I know as a Russian imperial stout. The dark fruits and sweetness are present, and the mouthfeel reminds me of Rochefort 10 in an excellent way. Alcohol is barely present, which I find to be the defining feature."
"D: Drinkability only suffers here from the slight alcohol flavor in the finish. Otherwise the flavor is solid."
"A extremely drinkable RIS, an 11 ounce bottle is just not enough."
"D-This thing is 13%? No way! No alcohol heat. Not crazy boozy or anything. If it wasn't for the aroma this thing would've been near perfect."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, formed a 1"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Pillowy head is going nowhere fast, with a thick coating of froth lacing throughout. Aroma is dark malt, anise, and alcohol. Taste is unexpectedly restrained. Dark malt sweetness upfront, light lactic tartness in the middle, creamy roasted close with alcohol wamrth lingering. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is way too easy for 13%abv. Possibly even worth the hype, if anything can be worth this beer's hype."
"EDIT: I'm not sure which batch my original bottle was, but both subsequent bottles I have had since then have been a huge step down in quality. My most recent batch which was bottled in March of 2010 is flat and watery and burnt and a mess. Not really good at all, I would probably give it a D. I'm going to drop my rating for this beer due to the extreme lack of consistency."
"D = A sipper, but one to come back to time and again."
"A very impressive and interesting brew; definitely a walk from the normal RIS."
"Small bottle, no feshness/vintage info, except for more marks on the side of the label which are of no help. Purchased at Julio's in Mass. all I remember about about the price was it was a lot! Over $5 for the 11.2 ounce bottle at least. Cool art on the label. Pours BLACK. Creamy, rich/dense dark mocha head, unrelenting retention and plenty of sheeting/lace. The nose is intensly and impresivly of dark chocolate, and double expesso. Thick and luxorious, loads of more bitter dark chocolate, expresso, nuts, brnt grains and everything doubly stouty and boldly delicious. World class stuff, go get some and enjoy."
"The beer yielded a beautiful, frothy two-finger head with an amber/butterscotch hue; the lacing held for a while and made the sides of the glass appeared frosted and shimmery. True to its name, Black Albert remains black in appearance even when held to light, making for an appealing contrast to the colorful head. The smell was sweet with a smoky aroma and scents roasted malt and coffee that manifest also in the flavor. Tasting was a delight; not only was the mouth feel thick and velvety, but all flavors seemed to compliment each other very well. The balance was superb, and at 13% ABV the alcohol is relatively hidden amongst the other flavors. One can tell immediately that this is a big beer, but ""booziness"" does not permeate (not to say that this isn't sometimes enjoyable in other heavy beers) the other flavors. I could drink a lot of these; they're delicious! However, at ~nine bucks per 12oz. bottle, this beer is a bit out of my sessionable price range. I would buy again for a special occasion, hands down. A definite must-try for fans of the imperial stout or darker/heavier beers in general."
"This was a very nice beer. The alcohol was well hidden and it had good balance. The flavors were a bit muted though, even after it warmed up. I'd surely have it again, but not at the price I paid for this bottle (near a dollar an ounce)."
"Out of a bottle this beer was an opaque, jet black color. The head was two fingers of mocha-foam brown and retained nicely as a thin layer. The lacing was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but consistent and thorough. The aroma was of roasted malt, wood, nuts, light alcohol (similar to dark rum), and some malty sweetness. The flavors were complex and rich, hiding the 13% surprisingly well. I tasted lots of roasted and toasted malt with some hints of smoke (almost like smoked meat in its depth) along with some spiciness (black pepper in particular), wood, black walnuts, molasses, coffee and espresso, baking cocoa, tobacco and hints of yeast. Complex and concentrated. As it warmed up the dry, malty finish became more clear, and rather clean. An impressive and challenging offering, and deceptive in its finesse. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full but not too heavy actually and the carbonation spot-on. I admit it, I'm impressed."
"Pours black with a huge tan head that stays until the end and laces nicely. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste is faint chocolate with roasted malts up front, maybe a little too roasted. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth, creamy texture. Drinkablity was good too, it went down the hatch fast and easy."
"This is a very good stout. Is it one of the best that I've ever had, I don't know. It's the best of the style that I've had. I'll be interesting to see what some time will do to this beer."
"Taste is milk chocolate with a hint of roastiness to balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth as it goes down. Very drinkable as this is incredibly smooth. No sign of 13% ABV here."
"This is a drinkable RIS--rich but so delicious."
"Dark brown as it's pouring, but black as night when it's in the New Belgium globe, an inch of brown foam, but not the darkest foam I've seen, good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is a lovely mixture between Belgian yeast, dark fruits, chocolate, dark honey, light coffee, rum, booze, and molasses. The chocolate aroma from this beer is amazingly good smelling. Alcohol really comes out as it warms. Taste is very interesting, and not quite what a normal RIS tastes like, as this is a ""Belgian Royal Stout."" Chocolate covered roasted beans makes up a bulk of the flavor profile, followed by a light cocoa sweetness, a bit of sourness and funky yeast, and dry baker's chocolate on the finish. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, but it's pretty well integrated as a whole for being 13%. I think this brew can benefit from a few years of aging to really round out the flavors. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy , viscous, chewy, all the good things I look for in a big stout. This is a very interesting beer. I like the mix of roasted barley and Belgian yeast. It's a combo that works for me, and I enjoyed sipping on this brew over the course of an hour. Good stuff. I'll definitely being buying a few more to cellar."
"D - the ABV is incredibly well hidden. I've had 7% ABV beers that didn't go down quite as smooth as this beer. I could drink this all day if it wasn't for how filling one of these is."
"D- Would drink it again but wouldn't have two back-to-back due to %13 ABV"
"D - Easy drinker, however I wasn't impresses with its boozyness taste."
"D - extreamly drinkable nice and smooth"
"Such a beauty. A beer to put away. It should evolve and improve for at least a decade."
"Black Albert's a very solid beer. I like it quite a bit, but I can't say it deserves all the hype. Actually, I believe some the hype has faded quite a bit. The only real problems I have with it are the slightly high carbonation and the sour flavor that's been incorporated. Less carbonation and sourness would improve it a good bit. As it stands, they don't have an overly substantial negative effect, but they do enough to prevent it from reaching its potential. Just my opinion. That being said, it's still a good beer and is easily recommended."
"Very thick and dark pour, although not extremely so. (Not like motor oil, which so many in this style can be.) A short head of beige foam developed, but quickly dissipated. Aromas of rich, dark fruit and roasted malts are very noticeable with every sniff. There's no hiding what this is about! Sweet, roasted malts approach the taste buds first, followed by notes of espresso, dark chocolate and dark fruits. Big, full flavor with a little more sweetness than usual for this style. It's not as boozy as I expected; the alcohol is a bit subdued, although at 13% I suspect one should take it easy! I sipped on this for nearly an hour while reading. The mouthfeel is a tad lighter than most RIS's., which accounts for the higher-than-usual drinkability. Enjoy one of these when you can afford it. I suspect this may be the only one I sample."
"This beer pours a very, very dark opaque brown, with chunks of sediment suspended throughout. The head is a light tan colour, and substantial, leaving a thick wallpaper of lace as it slowly recedes. It smells of fermenting black fruit - prunes, cherries, raisins - molasses, and alcohol warming. The taste is bitter, even sour at first, burnt malt, giving off essences of coffee, chocolate, and port wine. No hops are really evident, the sourness kind of masks that part of my tongue. The carbonation is quite mild, and the sour fruit mellows significantly as it warms, and the finish is actually quite clean, a little boozy malt lingering. The alcohol is very well managed, no direct heat, just that nice stewed fruitiness effect. This goes very well with some dark chocolate, but given the wine-like strength, one is good."
"D - I could drink this brew all night but the price and availability prohibits me from doing so."
"Even though Black Albert doesn't make my 'Top Beers on Planet Earth' list, I'm fine with the fact that it's on the BA list (near the bottom, where it belongs). Yeah, it's overhyped. Yeah, it's overpriced... but I got quite a bit of pleasure out of this little 330 ml bottle."
"Comment: This beer is interesting--if I could use italics, I would, for ""interesting."" The hype surrounding this beer is intense and I would suggest trying it, but it doesn't hold a candle to the majority of stouts it shares company with as far as rankings go."
"There is a hint of coco, some coffee, with an underlying sweetness tempered with a yeasty spiciness, its a very intriguing brew, I wish I had more than 33cl."
"Perhaps a bit over-hyped? But a quality RIS for sure. A must try."
"After a while the sweetness emerges along with a more leathery feel. Different from many in its weight class, but it drinks nicely and I would welcome this into my glass anytime."
"Strong and almost a bit too overwhelming for my palate. Needs some aging but otherwise, you're looking at one monster of a RIS."
"EDIT: After reading some reviews of this beer I see ""overcarbonated"" listed as a detraction from this beer. The bottle I enjoyed had been opened and left on ice for several hours. After I warmed it up, overcarbonation was certainly no longer a problem. In fact I think undercarbonation contributed in a positive way to this beer. If you have the patience, this may be the way to enjoy this brew."
"Good beer. Definitely worth a try if you like Belgians and want to try a beer that's half Belgian strong dark and half stout."
"Carbonation was high. Aroma was quite outstanding. Acidity and mouthfeel was so clean and fresh / refreshing. Heightened state of flavors lifted them, maybe too much. Small 330cl i guess bottle shared at toronado sd. Could see how this can age for years and years. Great aroma and femenin and lite is what I really felt. Pretty good. Wish it was on shelves and something I could try more often and age."
"I didn't want to buy into the hype, but this beer has A LOT going for it. Not perfect by any stretch, but legitimately a beer worth seeking out. Get it if you can."
"D - Extremely drinkable even at 13%. That's dangerous."
"From 2.9.09. Black - deep, deep black, almost purple. cappuccino colored head that is big and pillowy that sticks and stays for quite some time. Lacing is plentiful. Hints of booze and figs and cherries in the nose. A bit of coffee and espresso. Taste is burnt coffee. Rich, bitter with hops. Cherries are up front. The booze is so well hidden it is ridiculous. Plenty of carbonation, but was missing a bit creaminess. Deceptively easy to go down despite 13%."
"Thanks to Gary at Vinnin Liquors in Swampy for making sure we got hold of a few of these."
"If you come across one of these, do not hesitate, make the purchase. It will sting the wallet a bit, but you will be very glad once you take the first sip. Believe the hype!!"
"Overall, one of the most unique RIS I have ever had. Go into this beer with an open mind and just let it's complexity amaze you. Truly a wonderful beer. Highly recommended."
"Notes: What a treat to have this huge beer done in such a masterful way."
"M - Viscous, chewy, lots of carbonation."
"Taste is very roasted with an espresso like bitterness. Some of the sweet chocolate noted in the aroma. Also some dark fruit is in here. This beer kind of reminds me of Peche Mortel minus the coffee. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, full-bodied, with a perfect carbonation level. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable, making this 13% monster dangerously drinkable. This is a damn goood beer, if I have the opportunity to purchase this again I will."
"Pours onyx black with a dense medium brown head. Robust aroma. I get some chocolate, coffee and creamer, some dark berries, and a bit of smoke. The flavor is a bit different. Kind of a fruity mocha with plenty of bitterness and alcohol. Silky, milky mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. The finish is a bit bitter and hot. Still, this is a fine beer and is recommended."
"Won't pay that much for this again."
"D: Terrible, wouldn't waste my money on this one again. Don't believe the hype...you get more character out of a bud light...."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a fairly tasty brew. Not worth the all the hype it's received (or the price) but definitely worth a try. I can't really think of anything that I've tried that I could compare it too. Think a sort of dry Irish Stout mixed with a Rochefort 10 or something. Big thanks again to Derek and Mike!"
"D-This one was rather hyped, but it was really very good and measured up."
"Excellent take on the style. I'd describe it as Old Rasputin meets Rochefort 8. Although, I wouldn't drop $12 a bottle unless you really like Imperial Stouts and Strong Belgian ales."
"Bought at Bruisin' Ales for $10. I let the bottle warm up a bit before opening it. The aroma isn't that great. It's actually fairly mild for an impy stout. I get a little roastiness, but a fruity character takes the lead. I've smelled that same thing in some Belgian quads. The taste is a mix of sweetness and roastiness. To me, it tastes like what I would imagine a mixture of something like Expedition stout and Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or (CuvÃ©e Van De Keizer) or heck...how about Expedition and Pannepot would taste. The 13% alcohol content is well hidden. It has a Belgian character, but a mild one, and not something which is sour, funky, brett-ish, etc. Again, the mild, Belgian-style, sweetish, fruitiness is the main character I'm getting in this brew. It's sort of a dark, stewed fruit character. If I had been blindfolded and had been given this beer, I doubt I would have guessed it was an imperial stout. Whatever the case, it's a nice, drinkable, dark-Belgian brew. Is it worth $10 to me? No, but it was fun to try once."
"Imminently drinkable. Though I noticed the alcohol in some sensations, had no idea it was 13% until I went to review. Damned tasty. Non-beer geek girlfriend also very impressed by this one. I was prepared for it to be just pretty good, due to the hype, but I'm saying it is exceptional."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a huge deep brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of deep dry black chocolate with an intense hoppy dry finish. Taste is also a very nice mix between some deep dry chocolate malt with some dry hops and a dry roasted malt and coffee finish. Full body with great carbonation and no alcohol was apparent. Very complex and not totally American in it approach to the style. A more creamy body would render this even better in my opinion."
"D- a great treat of a beer, this is something id love to be able to drink very often. However, its very rare and even more expensive. I cant wait to see how the others I have change over time. Ill be opening them on special occasions only. Check this one out if you get the chance."
"Poured a deep black with a cocoa colored head, little carbonation. Nose is cocoa, figs, tobacco. Taste is cocoa, dried fruit up front with a sharp alochol bite on the end. The 13ABV is well hidden leaving this a hidden bruiser. Good RIS!"
"Great brew with a very interesting twist.."
"D: This 12oz bottle was aged at least a year, no hoppy aromas, lots of alcohol-soaked fruits without the candy belgian/yeast flavors. Similar to a DFH WWS in some ways. Nice to try, not sure it's something I'll ever crave."
"M - retardedly smooth. very creamy and assertive. carbonation keeps this beer alive, but doesn't overpower."
"Very delicious and quite different from any other imperial stout I've had."
"D - 13% ABV? No way... this is way too smooth. Not boozy at all... this is the best 13% i've ever experienced. Way way too smooth. This is an amazing beer. All the sudden... i'm kinda lightheaded and warm =) oooohhh yeeeeaaaahhh."
"Drinkability: Well, for starters, it was good! The love child of a Belgian Quad and Imperial Stout. The drinkability is suspiciously high for a purported 13% ABV brew. I certainly recommend it if you can manage to procure yourself a bottle or two."
"Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with this one, especially considering all the hype. Not terrible by any means, just not the stellar brew I was expecting."
"NaNaNa, thought an RIS with a belgian yeast was interesting, Hey Hey Hey. NaNaNa, that was the only thing. Hey Hey Hey"
"A decent beer, but severely over-hyped and overrated in my opinion...."
"Autumnaldave and I were drinking this on tap at the Lisle Bavarian Lodge. We decided that it had the elegant body of a tripel. The guy next to us detected some cellar notes, but I drank mine too quickly to pick it up. It combines a complex flavor profile with shocking drinkability."
"The balanced flavor of this beer is quite impressive."
"Thick beige head with pour retention. Very, very dark brown. Just a touch shy of black. Oaken brandy splashed with a some Kahlua and a little licorice make up the nose. A mix between Starbuck's liquer and kahlua start of the firs sip. But oak barreled whiskey and brandy mix with fresh ground coffee. Smooth palate and very mild alcohol feel to this beer. Dangerously deceiving 13% abv beer. Good sipper and would not imagine a beer like this to come out of Belgium. Grab as many as you can if these are available in your area."
"Great to get my paws on this one,poured as black as an oil slick,I mean no light getting thru this,a 1/2 finger light moch head atop leaving shotty lace.Aromas of dark fruit and espresso roast coffee,a tinge of hardwood shows thru as well.Lush mouthfeel,full and velvity,to me its perfect hence the rating.Complex flavors with a mix of heavy roast and dark fruit sweetness,some molasses-like flavors add to the sweetness,a big drying somewhat earthy finish is a great to end this brew.Its a sipping brew and can get a little sticky after a bit but this a gem of a beer."
"This is a great and impressive stout, but I still wince at the price tag. My beef with it is that it's a bit lite in the body. The smell however, and the taste are truly phenomenal. A fairly chocolatey beer with excellent balance- not too dry, not too sweet or flabby. It's worth having more than one!!"
"Medium body, not as much carbonation as I would have thought. A bit warming from the alcohol. Pretty nice."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and heavy, but it seems a little thin."
"Overall: Overall this is a great beer but man the $10 bottle price and the hype surrounding it seems unnecessary. I felt North Coast Old Rasputin was just as good for a hell of a lot cheaper."
"Pours a dark, dark brown color as close to black as it can into a snifter. Big creamy burnt tan head with orange highlights made up of tiny bubbles has nice retention and leaves some beautiful lacing with an oily residue. Smells of dark fruits, molasses, roasted malt, chocolate, leather, a touch of soy sauce/chalk, anise, and a bit of alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark fruits like figs, raisins, plums, and cherries, a bit of candy, bitter cocoa powder, coffee, roasted malt, leather, soy sauce, licorice, piney hops, and rum. Medium-full in body with low carbonation but a nice pop. Thick yet smooth and creamy with a robustness. Bold but very drinkable with a plethora of flavors and good balance throughout. A little pricey for a 11oz bottle, but worth it every so often."
"D- The tartness is pretty bright which is interesting compared with the dark roasted malt. The big roasted notes were up front but the malt flavors seemed to be in the background. This beer was served a bit colder than I like and I wonder if that hid some of the complexity? There just wasn't much complexity but nice contrast of flavors."
"Overall - An incredible and very complex beer although it does take a few sips before all the flavours emerge. I have two more of these and am looking forward to seeing how they age... highly recommended..."
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"""Believe none of what you hear and half of what you see."" -Ben Franklin"
"A very well balanced high abv stout that I could drink one too many of if it wasn't so damn expensive. Overall quite impressed and worthy of the praise but only something that I'll occasionally indulge in."
"Damn tasty and complex. Lovely roasted character with much more chocolatey flavors then the nose suggests and the belgian yeast and spicey quality are subdued from the nose. A sweet fruity character balances the roast nicely. Dark fruit flavors with hint of coffee and big alcohol yet in a nice way. Nicely carbonated with plum and chewy malts. Great balance and complexity. Nice."
"This is well worth seeking out. Expensive, yes, but a nice treat for yourself. Go ahead. You deserve it."
"Warm,this. Tasty, too, but not the greatest beer on Earth, nor that special of an Imperial, oh, I'm so sorry, Belgian Royal ...nice enough, but I can't see what's so special about it."
"All things equal (price being a big part of that) I would absolutely order this again, but as of now it's scarcity would probably send me to offerings of this style that while may not be as high quality are worth it after the price/rarity differential."
"single bottle from Riley's Madison, split with the feller of filth"
"drinkability: 165ml is a good serving size for me"
"Outstanding!"
"Drinkability is beyond belief for a stout of this weight. I have been reviewing all night and I can't bring myself to slow down on this exceptional beer."
"I actually had no idea that this was 13% alcohol until I looked it up to review it. The alcohol is VERY well hidden. Drinkability was great."
"This stuff was delicious. I have six other bottles that I'm ageing in my celler I think that it will be awsome with some age behind it, but we'll see."
"Overall a very good beer, but not really my bag. A bit too big for me with the alcohol and the super roasty flavors. Still I'm really glad I tried it."
"Overall, an interesting and pleasant drinking beer - worth trying if you have the chance, but IMO perhaps a bit underwhelming considering the hype it gets."
"Easy enought to drink but pretty expensive stuff."
"I am certainly glad that I got to try this beer, and overall is was a pretty good beer, but not worth a dollar and ounce though is what is equates to. If this beer were in a four pack around 15-20$ I would buy it often, but 12 bucks for a bottle I was expecting something differing from this offering."
"Very good Russian Imperial Stout with a big flavor and good alcohol heat. This beer pours black and opaque with a light brown head. It's certainly a good looking stout. The nose is a bit milder than expected, but nice toasted malt notes come through. The flavor is big and strong with some alcohol heat. It is a very malty beer with smoky chocolate and caramel flavors running roughshod all over the place. This beer might be able to garner a perfect flavor score with a bit of age on it. I envy anyone with vintage bottles. To be fair, I have no idea if Black Albert iis old or new, so that could be impossible. The feel is slightly sticky but very good. It's very drinkable given the high abv, but at 13% and relatively fresh, it's still a bit too hot. It pairs well with sweet, ripe Cornice pears."
"The drinkability suffers because the flavors seem a bit muddled and the finish is just a bit too hot for my liking, but I'm guessing this would be an excellent candiate for cellaring for many a year."
"Overall, this was disappointing, mostly because it was not what I was expecting. I would take many American RIS over this one but it's still an interesting beer. I'm not gonna say it's worth the hype, or the cost, but it's certainly good."
"D- Unbelievable that this stuff is 13%. Almost no alc. detected. This stuff is not overly done which makes it so nice. Drank this stuff really too quick and really felt it afterward. Excellent stuff but a bit too expensive to try again."
"Overall a good stout, but too expensive for me to buy again when I can buy equally good and similar stouts for much cheaper."
"Pours out black with a pretty decent brown head. The bubbles stay around, there is not much lacing, but the bubbles cling to the sides of the glass. Smells a bit sweet and roasted, and you get a bit of alcohol smell. The taste is a bit sweet, not much fruit like some others in the style, but you get a nice bit of bitter roastedness, which I love. Then there's a hint of the black malt and chocolate sweetness. The tastes are all sort of muddled, maybe from the yeast. I kind of wish it were more bold and assertive -not harsh - but I think the yeast made it hard to really distinguisg flavors. But I enjoyed it, if not for the rarity. For the style and the ABV, this one was surprisingly drinkable. Maybe I only wanted more because I only got half of a 11.2 oz bottle. The cost may limit me buying it, but if I ever get a shot to have it on tap from the source, I'll take it."
"All in all, a very tasty beer, certainly not a session beer, and I don't feel that it lives up to the $10 per small bottle price tag. That's not to say it's not delicious, just a little underwhelming."
"D - Nice Belgian twist on the style. A very nice beer but not sure it is worth the price/hype."
"pretty interesting, its main 'uniqueness' factor being that it maintains the complexity and flavor of the top RIS's however with a much lighter body. not different enough to creat a new style, but a definite great beer."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this beer. It quite good and is a different take on the RIS with Belgian qualities. But ultimately there are quite a few other RIS that would pick up before this one."
"I had this on-tap, and served far too cold, at The Terminal, near the airport in Milwaukee."
"Pours a molassses brown topped by a thin and dense tan head. Aroma is medium sweet with star anise, roast, some cocoa, cinnamon and light alcohol. Flavor is cocoa, herb, vanilla and alcohol . Medium to full full body, smooth texture. Very dry finish."
"I am very susceptible to beer hype. Just have to know what the big stink is about. Black Albert, my latest buy in, is indeed worth the endless praise. Poured nice and slow into a tulip style glass, the head was immense for a 13% ABV beer and it stuck around for some time. Fantastic looking beer, period. The smell on the other hand was dull and acrid, not overly phenolic, more like like flat pepsi. Flip Flop again. Taste is full of flavors that easily come to life. ""Caramel Sundae Syrup"" at the tip and back of my tongue intertwined with sour cherries and raisins. Aftertaste is much like a Flanders Red. Black Albert does noy give his ABV away in the mouth. Mouthfeel is sticky and leaves my teeth wet with an oily film. Very drinkable for a high ABV beer. I could drink another if it was cost effective."
"Overall, its a great beer. I would definately buy again and will once I start making the money to afford it more often."
"D - A good beer. The alcohol is well hidden."
"OVERALL: If this one has a ""spoiled taste," then spoil the heck out of me. I've had this brew many times and it never ceases to impress. Definitely some Belgian in this Imperial Stout, with the spicier yeast notes involved, but I wouldn't hesitate to call this the best non-barrel aged stout in the low countries. Very good brew. De Struise makes some great stuff, and this is one that ranks right up there. Thanks again gents."
"Drinkability: With all the hype around this beer, I was truly expecting something different; I would say that this is still quite a good beer, though it should not be judged head to head against the best US-brewed Russian Imperial Stouts - it has some subtle, Belgian elements that add a nice twist"
"D. Not too high, very rich and ""Belgian-y"" but a pleasure to sip on."
"D: It's a pretty heavy hitter and masks the alcohol really well. I could have a couple of these in a session."
"So hmm. This was good, but not great. I had this only once previously, about a year ago with BA member bgramer and I recall getting a lot more out of it at that time. I think this is probably better bottled and aged than on tap."
"drinkability is good. fairly balanced, leaning a little on the sweet side. definitely a belgian twist on the style, but it works. i'm curious to see how this one would change with some time in the cellar, but happy with it now too."
"Pours a cloudy and murky dark black, some red in the edges, thick tan head forms, drops some solid lace spots on the glass, and settles to a thick layer and ring, looks good. Smell is wacky, red wine, chocolate, yeast, molasses, wood and earth, figs, dark fruit, sour fruit, rye bread, sourdough, intense roast, interesting stuff. Taste is similar, very dry roastiness, chocolate, figs, wood, kind of astringent, red wine and fruit, brown sugar, yeast, very fruity, nice bitter roast finish, very dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol is very well hidden, pretty smooth and easy to drink. Hyped up for me but still a really nice beer. Thanks Alex!"
"Overall, top notch Russian Imperial Stout. I don't know if it lives up to the hype (there are really few beers that ever do) but I'd put it on par with the other excellent examples I've had recently, like Surly Darkness and the Abyss."
"D: Plenty of hype surrounding this beer and, for the most part, it lives up to it. Terrific drinkability as a sipper, a fine take on my favorite style with that added 'Belgian' twist. We changed our dinner plans tonight specifically so that we could try this beer. Worth it? Yep."
"Ovr: In a year that has brought me Dark Lord, Darkness, Abyss, and now Black Albert, I'd have to say this is right up there. Much more drinkable than the heavier stouts, but as complex. If you forced me, I'd go Dark Lord, Darkness, Black Albert, Abyss"
"I could definately have quite a few of these even though there 13%. I would drink this beer very often if it wasn't for the high cost and really hard to get them."
"Better than I thought, but it is still not one of my favorites."
"Aroma is roasty, hints of vanilla, dark fruit. Good but not outstanding. Wonderful taste, roasty chocolate, prune, licorice, some herbal hints in the hops. This is so creamy, so smooth. As drinkable as a 13% beer can be. Fortunately it is cost prohibitive. $11 a glass, worth it, but I won't have this too often."
"Black with the faintest of ruby edges. A regular pour produced a billowing three finger cap that was slow to settle. The foam was a light brown and was composed of fine bubbles that coated the sides of the glass. Great head retention. And the beer has legs. Faint grassy hop aroma was immediately surpassed by malted milk, rose water alcohol, dried fruits, and mellow roast. There's a lot going on and it's hard to pull apart. Alternating notes of mellow rubbing alcohol, chocolate, figs, and prunes. Bitterness was in the background, giving way to significant malt sweetness and alcohol. Roastiness stayed soft and had a cherry edge to it, while malt alternated between milk and dark chocolate. Higher alcohols added depth without contributing heat and dried fruits tied the sweetness together. Dry cocoa appeared towards the end, along with some toffee, particularly as it warmed. Full bodied with low carbonation that was very creamy, lots of alcohol warmth, and a faint dark malt astringency. Very smooth and delicious, definitely a sipper."
"D- Super drinkable and very enjoyable I wish I would have had the 750ml instead of the 333ml."
"Overall I was a bit let down after the first few sips, but this one definitely grew on me. The smoothness is what sets this beer apart from others. Definitely worth a shot if you see it around."
"This is one outstanding RIS, and I hope it crosses my path again sometime."
"Worth seeking out - I'm glad I grabbed those extra bottles at Discount Liquors."
"330 ml bottle with a big thanks to presario. Best by April 2013. Pours out a dark black color with a large, creamy light brown head and lots of sticky lacing. A nice aroma of rich roasted malts, sweet chocolates and milk coffee, sweeter sugars and the all powerful Belgian yeast. The aroma suggests a Belgian Strong Ale, but mixed with darker roasted notes. The taste is very nice; initially full of roasted, almost sour flavors, some sweet burnt toffee and caramel. Roasted coffee beans contribute to this near-sourness. Later, this beer gets much sweeter; sweet milky flavors, bittersweet chocolates, cocoa, a very nice, though not huge dark fruitiness. Very drinkable and a silky smooth body. The yeast really stands out, and for me, this really shows the core of a good Belgian beer, and how flexible it can be. A hybrid for sure, and an excellent on at that. Great."
"This is an interesting stout from De Struise. There were things I liked and things I didn't but overall this is a good brew. The spiciness threw me off a first but grew on me as I drank. Thanks again for this treat Bill!"
"This beer is the most drinkable 13% beer I've had. Many thanks to kkipple for the chance to have this. Very generous. Get your hands on this one if you can."
"No doubt a treat that is worth repeating. You should try this one at least once and then probably more. Pick it up as it now appears to be more available in the US. A GREAT, GREAT beer."
"D - Very Dangerous! A wonderful beer that masks it's 13% abv with a very smooth taste. Other than the high alcohol content (great for me, but others might not like), one of the best beers and certainly worth it"
"this brew pours up black with a huge frothy dark tan head. great lacing. the nose is a little boozy (the only negative about this beer), big dark roasty malts, dark chocolate, kind of nutty. the taste is very alive due to the 100 IBUs. I taste big roasted malts, a lil nutty, chocolate, a blend of floral and piney hops. Tons of hops and tons of malt! A fairly equal amount of the two but in great amounts! This was my BLACK ALBERT experience..."
"This stout pours a black soil color and has a very nice espresso brown head. Excellent lacing and retention. The nose is a bit light. It has subtle malts and hops along with dark chocolate, bitter molasses and sweet fruit. The taste more impressive than the nose. There are roasty malts, bitter hops, cocoa, and molasses with subtle ripe fruits. Similar to De Dolle export stout in the sense that the Belgian yeasts have a strong presence. Well balanced for such a big beer. Full body is well carbonated. A nice brew, quite unique. This vintage gets a 4.0-4.2 score."
"Overall: The flavor reminded me of a combination of Older Viscosity and perhaps a light coffee stout that was exceptionally balanced. Not what I expected at all, but still a very pleasant experience."
"Wow, the ABV is well masked, dangerously drinkable. Pretty good, barely cracks my top 10 for the style, but it would be nice to have this as a regular in the cellar. Great RIS, not the best but damn close"
"Pours a very dark brown almost pitch black with a huge 1.5 inch caramel colored head. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts, with some alcohol notes bleeding through. Intense thick lacing lovingly clings to the glass. First sip is surprisingly smooth with a beautiful bitterness that is coffee and chocolate with a mellow yeast note very present. The body is fairly light and the 13% ABV is very well hidden. Damn this is good. Very sweet and then quickly bitter. Wow. This beer lives up to its hype."
"Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, light sherry, dried fruits, chocolate, some smoke, spices, and a bit of alcohol. Taste of roasted malts, some dark chocolate, light anise, smoke, and dark fruits, with a warming alcohol presence. Thanks to Chris from Ebenezer's for sharing this bottle!"
"Black Albert is an outstanding Russian Imperial Stout brewed by De Struise Brouwers. The taste and aroma is truly remarkable. It is an exceptional example of Belgian brewing at its finest. Black Albert has become one of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts and one to enjoy greatly during the Fall and Winter months."
"D- This is a great Belgian stout...definitely the best I have had. This may be 13% but it drinks like it has 1/2 the ABV. Great, complex brew that I will revisit sometime but a bit too pricey to have again for awhile."
"mouth is creamy and smooth. this beer is incredibly easy to drink. and i now am in the market for some more."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is good and strong, it smells like dark fruit (figs, raisins), Belgian yeast, apples, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla and candy sugar. There's also a couple other things in the aroma I can't recognize. Very nice. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, yeast, candy sugar, brandy, rum, licorice and chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, creamy, a bit slick and also has soft carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very easy to drink considering the 13% ABV. The alcohol isn't too noticable at all. It's a fine example of an RIS with a Belgian twist to it. Because of the price it's not something I'd have around all the time, but I do like this beer a lot and I definitely recommend this."
"Super tasty and super easy to drink. My very first 'perfect' rating for a beer."
"This is a good beer, and quite a unique experience for me. However, this is the most expensive beer I've had if I break it down to $/mL, and I don't think it is quite worth the cost. I could actually buy a six pack of local beers for less than the cost of one 330 mL bottle. Absolutely worth trying once though."
"I believe deepsouth provided me with this sample. Thanks."
"2-12-10 Revisited in an impromptu stout tasting and have to say that time has not been good to the bottle I held onto. Drink them fresh"
"Definitely a good beer, it is lacking the finesse that I was hoping for though. The complexity is there in the nose, but, while tasty, it doesn't seem to fully follow through in the flavor."
"This is really good. The only strike might be the drinkability, it's just too thick & full to have more than (if I could get another, or afford one, so never mind...). Excellent beer. Hope it arrives on the shores of the U.S.A. soon, I'd make space for it in the fridge."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer but just not what i was expecting especially after all of the hype"
"After all the hype, I finally got to try this beer. It lived up to its reputation. Served in a tulip, the beer was an impenetrable black with a medium tan head. It had a coffee and chocolate aroma, like most RIS, but to my usually impaired nose, was fairly pronounced. A coffee/espresso and chocolate taste, very well balanced. If not for the high ABV, could drink a lot of these."
"Overall: awesome"
"D-Very drinkable for the gravity on this one. This beer is different. One cannot jump into this one thinking of it as an RIS...it's definitely not."
"I wish this was good. I really, really do."
"Impressive for what it is, except for the hefty price tag that is. Worth the hype but I'll save this for special occassions."
"M + D: Nice and creamy, though not as full a body as some I have had. A great drinker, hiding that huge alcohol incredibly well. Nice stuff, and I'd like to have it again."
"This is my first belgian imperial stout. I never knew of this style before, but tastes very similar to any other high quality imperial"
"Drinkability is high here too despite the high ABV. REally a great RIS."
"O: I'm thinking 4.7 material here. Big bolshy Belgian Imperial Stout....NIIICCCCEEEE"
"D: Definitely a sipper. An amazing brew. I actually came into this with a little prejudice against this beer. After everything that happened after the last release on this site and the other one and how the brewers handled everything. I was sure it'd be good but certainly overhyped. Really not the case. It's a fantastic brew and brings a very welcomed 'Belgian Imperial Stout'(or Belgian Royal Stout or w/e) style into more prominence. Make more and have Shelton make it more widely available."
"Obviously this is a sipping beer, and a big one at that. But the flavor is very pleasant, and seems like it would be fantastic paired with a rich dessert."
"This is one damn fine belgian-style stout that hides it 13% extremely well. More please!"
"I've had the pleasure of tasting this brew during several different occasions from the tap and from the bottle and I must say this is by far one of the best Imperial Stouts brewed; bar none! First, I don't even know if this should be in the same class with other Imperial Stouts; it has its own distinctive style. The appearance of this brew has to be one of the darkest stouts I have ever seen. The head was so thick and velvety brown head that it looked like a shot of espresso...superb! It had a magnificent scent of sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee beans and molasses along with roasted malt. The taste is just out of this world. Started off with a blitz of dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted malts; followed by light vanilla hoppy presence and fruit flavors with a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel wasn't too thick along with soft carbonation keeping the brew from tasting too syrupy. The complexity of this brew is such that 13% ABV is totally absent until the glass is almost empty and then you begin to say Wow, this is one hell of a beer! For me this was like drinking a fine Port that I could have sipped all night. I can't say enough about the brews that are being produced at the Struise camp, but I do know that the rating of number one brewer in the world is without doubt; justified! This brew has taken Stouts to a whole new level!!!"
"Overall, this is beautiful! Its sweet, complex, and very drinkable!!! WOW WOW WOW!!!"
"D- Drinkable beer, but I will not be having another any time soon."
"Black Albert finds itself somewhere in-between a quadrupel (like Pannepot) and a stout. Its malt-profile pleases me a lot, but its high content of sugar does not. And when the beer has warmed up, the two styles seem to fall out of their initial unity. A very impressive (and bold) piece of work nonetheless."
"Even a mild pour gets a monsterous three fingers of rocky carmel colored head. Body is like living black symbiote, evil and soulless. Nose is actually on the softer side with some black anise, burnt molases and zesty carmalized malt, very unique even for a stout. Layers of dark cherries, molases, bitter chocolate, black licorice and burnt malt really paint the mouth. Some dark soured fruit comes through on the back of the palate. This is a very deeply complex beer. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and creamy and the more you drink the more you love and get out of it. I could drink this beer all night but at some point I would be thankful it is only 330ml. Delecious. I know that many of the hardcore beer geeks will be disapointed that it is getting more distributed. I hope that doesnt affect it scores but I know it probably will."
"Imbibed a delicious snifter full the day after the epic Paxton dinner at Eb's. Goliath thickness and nice tight head profile. Aromas of stewed prunes, old tobacco, dates, raisins, sweet dark malts eminate. Nice viscosity, foretelling of a huge mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden well, lots of flavors going on...Belgium notes abound, playing off the aromas. Smooth, without the killer finish of many RIS'. A superbly crafted brew that completes the 12 hour horizontal tasting of Albert, kabert and lord kabert."
"After finally trying it I think this beer is over-hyped but very good (but not the second coming of DL that I'd hoped for). It proved itself to be a very good RIS, but nothing's worth the $20-33 that this is now commanding in the marketplace. Too similar to Expedition Stout to demand that kind of coin."
"D: despite being such a MONSTER, this beer drinks incredibly easily, almost too easily. The fruits definitely come out in the aroma and are not masked by the alcohol at all. Taste is also top notch. It's a great beer and one that I would definitely drink again and highly recommend!"
"(Thanks Charles!)"
"Thanks to Jay23 for sharing the spoils of his trade with Hoppymeal..."
"Big props to ma main man Delerium for the sample. Thanks bro!"
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Flavor is great, feels like a RIS made love to quad and popped this bad boy out. Alcohol is definitely there, but pretty well hidden. After all of the negativity, I'm really diggin it. It lives up to the hype for me and I'd spend every penny on it again."
"Recommended!"
"Thank you for sending Absumaster the RIS original formula version. Absolutely black, with a bit of creamy head, it looks rich and thick. Aroma of maltiness and a little coffee roast. The flavour is chocolate,roast, malt, a little coffee, mid-sip bitterness. The real feature of this beer is its balance. Its not too sweet, not too chocolate. Just eminently drinkable. A fine RIS."
"One of the best stouts I have had, way different than a Russian Imperial Stout, I have said it once and it will say many more times, De Struise is a phenomenal brewery, crazy that this worked out to be three dollars per ounce but it was great to try it once, probably would not drink it again since I had such a good taste this time because I have heard about bad bottles from a few different people now and do not want to damper my experience, highly recommended"
"Drinkability: Quite possibly the strangest RIS I've ever had. Manages to taste and smell amazingly light while at the same time being amazingly alcoholic. The aroma and taste, however, are fabulously complex - light and fruity, almost a fruity, 13% abv schwartzbier or something. Not sure if it's worth what I paid for it, but if this were available in my area and a little more inexpensive, I'd definitely get another."
"at a loss for words."
"Thanks to bgramer for the opportunity to try this one. 330ml bottle served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black with a one inch, tight, tan colored head with lots of tiny ringlets embedded in the cap. As the fluid receded into a fairly consistent layer of foam it left behind thick bands of sticky lacing. Scents of dark fruit dominate the nose (plum, black cherries and currants). Taste reveals cocoa and a slightly sour character to the fruit expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, without being viscous, with a kiss of effervescence. Excellent drinkability and exceptional balance; I can't believe this is a 13% abv."
"Thanks again for this gem, Bill!"
"HV"
"Pours a beautiful thick black with a full two finger mocha colored head that takes a while to die down to a creamy layer that lasts. Decent wall of stick left on the sides of the glass, nice looking brew for sure. Damn this is a strong smelling beer. Lots of dark fruits; fig, cherries, blueberries, dates, raisins, and blackberries just to name a few. Along with the dark fruits is a huge boozy aroma, almost medicinal. Underneath all that is a bit of dark chocolate, yeast, and freshly roasted coffee. Taste starts off pretty smokey and roasted with a good amount of black coffee and bitter chocolate. The dark fruits come through midway with sweet molasses and hearty wheat bread. An interesting sting left in the mouth towards the end lingering into the toasted marshmallow aftertaste. Very silky soft feel with a medium to full body. Carbonation is steady and noticable, but doesn't take away from the beer. The bite it leaves in the mouth though is something I've never really experienced, unique for sure. For the 13% this is pretty drinkable, still a sipper, but the abv is quite hidden. After all the recognition this beer received, I'm a bit let down. One of a kind beer, but there are plenty out there I prefer over Black Albert. Maybe it's better on tap, I dunno? I'm just not that impressed."
"Thanks to yespr for sharing this at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Poured into my La Chouffe goblet. Darkest brown with a tan head, not much lacing. Aroma is rather weak. Cocoa powder with a bit of dark fruit. Flavor is roasty with some malted chocolate and plum. This really isn't much different from Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence but somehow this is rated world class. The one outstanding aspect of this beer is that you would never guess that it was 13 percent abv. Literally zero alcohol flavor. Drinkability is insane. Overrated."
"Y'know, I was super impressed when I first poured this, but it seems to lose it's more exciting fringe character as it should be opening... that said, this is amazingly drinkable, with a clean flavor and a great aftertaste. If this were readily available, I'd purchase with regularity, but at a high cost, via trade or cash, I'm not sure, even if my first reaction was: this is amazing!"
"33cl bottle. Pours black black with a creamy ochre head that recedes quickly. Very strong smells of dark roasted malts: chocolate, coffee, etc. Dark fruits as well, followed by spices. Tastes heavily of the same coffee/semi-sweet chocolate. Spices in the background. Surprising hop bitterness actually gives it a finish that's almost dry. Thick and creamy feel with quite a bit of carbonation. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, with only a slight warming at the end."
"As for overall drinkability and character, I think it's great but not the best RIS I've tried. Nicely balanced, especially to nearly completely hide 13% abv. Aside from temperature change, it seems to really benefit from decanting to breathe momentarily and release some of the imbalanced fumes initially released. Definitely improves the longer it sits. I could sip this one for a while, only noticing the alcohol in my head and stomach, but not in mouth or nose."
"That was 13%??? I'd swear it was half that strength. Belgian strong dark, belgian royal imperial stout, you decide. RIS is a misnomer. Nice to drink but no idea of the costs although I'm sure it's not cheap. Definitely one to cross off the list and be happy to have had a shot."
"D: It was an excellent, interesting and rich beer that would be great on a cool fall night or as a night cap. Definitely not a session brew."
"Nice and dark. Beautiful, tallish, creamy dark head that sticks around, oh, does it ever. Tastes weird. Creamy smooth chocolate but strong coffee and dark, smoked bitterness with a slight tinge of sour (a blend in of another beer?). It's OK but I won't seek it out again."
"Pours totally opaque, with the sort of swimmy, slowly dissipating head common to big Belgian beers. Nose is mostly boozy dark fruits, with only a suggestion of roasty chocolate. Taste is more like a gigantic quadrupel than any stout I've had, definitely thinner in body than most imperial stouts. The taste is full of rich, bready malt, rum-soaked raisins and other dark fruits, very much like an English barleywine. There's some earthy Continental hop bitterness, just enough for balance, and pleasant but faint notes of chocolate, leather, espresso, and smoke in the finish. This one is big, but not heavy-handed."
"D - Another special occasion beer, of course. Something like this you're not going to want to have a 6-pack of in one night. But this beer is definitely special. It is a brew whose character changes with each sip, revealing new notes and flavors as it warms. Only the best seem to do that, and this beer is not acting."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice dark black color, very nice carbonation, a very nice two-finger creamy tannish head, which leaves some very nice thick sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slightly sour, with some toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet/sour, nice touch of dark chocolate. Full-Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with a brew this high in ABV. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, a nice little twist on the other RISs, but very nice for what it is. Highly recommended. Thanks Jason and Bill."
"Taste of strong alcohol, not the 13%, but still a strong alcohol kick. A sweet maltiness with the roasted coffee and chocolate and molasses. The dark malts give the beer a nice malt bitterness that is actually quite mild, but at the same time, giving the beer a great balance. Mouthfeel is sticky and warming. The hops are bitter and spicy and there is a good hoppy aroma in here. Body is full."
"This poured black in color with a thick fluffy brown head that dissipated away. The nose has tart vinous aromas of plum, fig and cassis along with bittersweet chocolate, expresso roast and cotton candy. In the mouth it is full-bodied with nice mid-palate concentration and plenty of carbonation that keeps this from coming off as heavy. This is not as heavy as I expected rather it is very well-balanced. Like the nose the flavors are dark and vinous with a lingering finish that does show off some of the alcohol. This looks to have the balance, power, acidity and carbonation to age well."
"Thanks Tony for sharing."
"All in all, disappointing."
"Drinkability is tops! A brew that is really easy to drink and enjoy."
"Bottom line: Yeah, it's a superhyped brew and I couldn't resist seeking some out(Belgian Shop) and I *did* pay a few bucks to have 6 bottles delivered but, if I didn't like it as much as I did, I would say so and follow up with ""never again"" In this case, I think what I got for my money is a very special brew and I'm glad for it."
"Drinkability is pretty poor, heavy sweetness makes it a sipper, but doesn't actually taste good. Judged in a blind tasting, beer wasn't revealed until notes were done on all eight RIS's, but this one was an easy guess."
"D: This is an exceptionally complex beer and truly unique. Drinkability isn't extremely high, but one of these is a rewarding enough experience that two would probably be too much for my poor palate to take. Wonderful beer and looking forward to getting some more."
"Poured the 1/3L bottle into a goblet. Absolutely beautiful beer- jet black with a perfect tan head. Smellso of dark chocolate and alcohol. Strong alcohol. Taste is very different than expected. I taste the chocolate and some espresso notes, but get a thin biting flavor of alcohol and maybe hops? Very thin mouthfeel for a RIS. Effervescent mouthfeel. Lots of fizziness, but plenty of flavor. Very well crafted beer, and different, which is always nice."
"Overall this was an Excellent stout, above excellent actually, but it did not anywhere near live up to the hype surrounding it. Had I just stumbled upon it I would have thought this was great, and I still do, but it was made out to be so much better then everything else, and while I do have to admit it was one of the smoothest beers I have ever seen, it was by no means the best. Still though its one you need to try at least once as it is highly worth it."
"Overall, this is a solid stout for sure, but it wouldn't be in my Top 10 Imperial Stouts, let alone top beers in the world. Just one man's opinion."
"It's very good for what it is, but wouldn't make the list of the best beers I've ever had."
"Pours a deep impenetrable black with a nice fluffy light tan ice cream head, ok lacing. Smell is an interesting mix of deep dark malts and belgian yeast. Alcohol is aparent in the nose and a touch of spice. Taste is deep dark malts with some very belgian like qualities. slight coffee and a little hint of cocao like sugar. A nice sweetness, but there is a plasticy hint I dont like alot that was also in the nose (slightly), but it doesn't ruin it. Mouthfeel is dissapiointingly thin, but still good. Drinkability is extremely high for a 13% brew. Overall I like this one alot, but I defenitey do not think it lives up to the hype. A very good beer, and a fine imperial stout I would visit again, but a tad expensive. Highly recommended, but to quote jim carrey ""I've had better"""
"Notes: Tried this again and found it even more riddled with off-flavors. I'm really not impressed with this one, mediocre at best."
"This is a nice beer and you should at least try it."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a tan head that sticks around for a bit. The aroma is amazing. Chocolates, vanilla, dried fruit, spicy citrusy hops, a bit of alcohol too. Taste is smooth chocolate, followed by some roasted grains, then a lingering coffee and hoppy aftertaste. Does have a bit of an alcohol hotness, but that melds into the whole experience quite well. Very Creamy mouthfeel. Ample carbonation, thick bodied. Excellent brew all around, makes me want to pay eBay prices for some bottles."
"D:Damn. This is up there with choklat in terms of dumb amounts of drinkability. No hint of the 13% at all. This really is a great beer that in most ways lived up to the hype. Other members of the group compared this to Dark Lord. haven't had the pleasure yet but that is good company. Would definitely have again if it didn't involve selling organs."
"I am curious how well this will age. It did not have a strong alcohol flavor at all and it seemed very well rounded already. I think it's perfect now."
"D: Very excellent all around. World class but still slightly over-hyped."
"Aside from the high ABV this one is just stellar. One of the best of beers I have had and definitely not easily classified into a style. As others have said this is one that is definitely worth the hype and one that you should seek out. The first and last thing that came to mind with this beer was the just ""wow."" Thanks again to bgramer for the chance to try this one."
"Pours a dark cola brown to black in color with an average sized medium tan head that fades to a ring. Sweet and fruity aroma, grapes and aged pruniness. Chocolate, a strong belgian yeast, tangy alcohol, and a breadiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows with the chocolate and fruity sweet maltiness mixing together very nicely, grapiness comes thru well, a decent tanginess leads into a slightly dry finish that shows a little of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is fairly full and sugary, a hint of pepper on the tongue, a bit of drying and warmth in the finish. A very tasty beer, definitely does not fit into the ris category. I had read some of the belgian stout posts before trying this so expected it to fall outside those lines and it definitely does. Would fit better in the belgian strong dark imo. Alcohol is very well balanced for its strength and it seems that this is a great candidate for some longer cellaring, look forward to trying it again after a year or two."
"A final word for the label. A design award surely with regard to matching the external bottle presentation to the quality of the beer within."
"The complex flavors also run the gamut suggested from the palate."
"When I finished this beer, my tongue threw up the white flag. It's done tasting anything until breakfast. I'm not even brushing my teeth tonight."
"This is a world class beer which deserves to be in the Top 5."
"Had this one a while ago, on tap at Erasmus in Brugge in early March 2008. I agree with some earlier reviewers that this is not as heavy as some imperial stouts I've had. I remember that there was tremendous head retention. Coffee notes in the aroma and the taste. Great satin mouthfeel. The alcohol level was not overly (negatively) noticeable. I can't wait until I can get more of this back at home."
"The beer started off a bit cold from the tap but as it warmed in my hands the taste and aroma intensify. The high abv comes through more on the backend and compliments the malty sweetness very well. Overall this beer has a nice full body but doesn't weight you down like other imperials I have had."
"It beats Kate, Darklord and Darkness all in the arse. When it finally is available in bottle I will be buying up every bottle I see."
"Overall a bit disappointing. It just lacked the complexity that I personally needed for it to have been great."
"Cheers to Ebenezer's and De Struise for this fantastic and delicious collaboration! The only complaint I have is that I wish I had a bottle to take home and savor by a crackling fire."
"I wish I could of bought an entire bottle or even a glass, but I only got a small sample. It was however, simply the best overall beer I had ever had. I am young, not as experienced beer drinker as most, but I do live 5 miles from Eb's, so I can safetly say I have had my share of beer."
"Drink: Yeah, this is incredibly drinkable especially considering the alcohol strength."
"DAMN! this is one good beer. I only had a taste and can't wait to get back for a normal sized serving. In fact even thought the tap list is one of the best i have seen, i would get this beer every time i went to ebenezer's (and i definitely plan on going back)."
"All in all I am already looking forward to my next trip to Maine and another taste of this fine beer."
"By coincidence, I had just held a Stout tasting event the night before. Among the beers we sampled were some of the best: BellÂ’s Â“ExpeditionÂ”, BellÂ’s Â“Double CreamÂ”, BellÂ’s Â“JavaÂ”, and MoylanÂ’s Â“Ryan OÂ’SullivanÂ’s Imperial StoutÂ”. As great as these beers are, Â“Black AlbertÂ” was even better. It is the most complex stout that I have ever tried. The color is black with a light-brown, lacy head (about 1 finger). The initial smell is malty, with notes of coffee & fruits. The taste is smooth & rich (but not too creamy)Â…there is an initial taste of coffee, which dissipates, and later returns. The taste lingersÂ…and changesÂ…for a long while. While sharing this amazing beer with a few others, I heard the comment Â“I died and went to heavenÂ”. I could not agree more with this. Â“Black AlbertÂ” was as religious of an experience, as you could ever hope (or pray) to have!"
"First off this was the darkest stout i have ever seen. I took my glass out to the sun porch to try and see if any light would penetrate. Well the sun did not stand a chance, I have no idea what the srm was but it had to be 60+. It had a thick, creamy brown head that was long lasting. The aroma consisted of chocolate and roasted malt with a slight touch of port in the back ground. The flavor was very rich and warming. Started off with a fresh roasted coffee taste. Vanilla beans and nobel hops in the middle and finished with an amazing chocolate aftertaste. The alcohol was perfectly balanced with the malt and the bitterness. It was warming but never hot and slightly sweet but not cloying. Urbain said the final gravity was 1.030 so he was able to achieve really good attenuation for a 100% malt bill. No sugar or adjuncts in Black Albert. The mouthfeel was very full and smooth. It is the best stout RIS or BIS I have ever tried hands down."
"It's very creamy, and goes down nice and easy. I wish I didn't have to drive for more than two hours to have another one of these."
"Definitely recommended.... If you can get it. I wish I could get a bottle or two to age or maybe a barrel aged version would be nice. I have a hunch that this gem would be even better with age."
"A very unique beer that, to me, comes across as a blend of a fresh hop IPA and an Imperial Stout."
"I cherish the glasses that I was fortunate to enjoy this week, and I thank Chris and Jen, as well as Carlo and Urbain from De Struise, for providing us with this incredible experience."
"Thank You Chris and Jen"
"I feel very fortunate to be sitting along side the folks from De Struise Brouwers,Chris and Jen for the official unveiling of this long anticipated brew. Chris and I sampled a few glasses before the Official unvieling and I couldn't wait for the next one I could get my hands on.Served in an Ebenezers 3rd Annual goblet this stout is very dark in appearance with a slight head,smells just as good as it tastes,chocolate,mollasses,leather?and hops.Ithas an almost syrupy mouth feel which is maybe why it goes down so well.At 13 percent and being very drinkable this is a dangerous concoction,Ican't wait to try the 3 liter bottle Chris has been carrying around like a baby the past three nights."
