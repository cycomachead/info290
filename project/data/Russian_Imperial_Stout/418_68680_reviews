"More quad flavors than stout. Dark fruits. Hmmm. Smooth. Super dry from the oak. Eh, its ok."
""
"Quite tasty. I think that it would only improve with age."
"Overall - 4.25/5"
""
""
"Hands down, one of the best RIS (American) I’ve had – comparable to Oskar Blues Ten Fidy in taste and complexity. Thoroughly enjoyable sipper/winter warmer. Must buy and I’ll be stocking up on this tasty concoction!"

"Just not a fan of Imperial Stouts."

"I am an IPA person. I love IPA's. this stuff is good, I think it is kind of great. Having it with a cheese pizza, and it is a perfect compliment. It tastes robust, refreshing, chocolate, with a nice not too carbonated mouth feel.  I didn't look at the alcohol %, not a supermarket lager for sure, but the alcohol taste can't taste it for the rich flavor. This is yummy. I will stick with IPA's, but this is a wonderful change of pace."
""
"Wonderful dark color, but not much of head. The aroma is very muted.  Hint of coffee.  Taste is smooth and silky.  Definetly a coffee flavor but I don't get much else out of it.  This has been in my fridge for about year so maybe that is the problem.  Its good, but not as complex of aroma or taste than I would expect."
""
""
"Overall:  This is a delicious beer, one of the best non-barrel-aged Imperial Stouts I’ve had in fact.  Definitely up there with Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout, Founders’ Imperial Stout, Great Lakes’ Blackout Stout and Oskar Blues Ten Fidy.  I’m definitely getting some more of this!  Highly recommended!"

"Very strong imperial stout that stood out a little from the other LC stouts. A little more umph with this one."
""
"Excellent head. Deceptively mild, yet rich aroma. Beautiful color. High abv but doesn't knock you out. Excellent taste, look and aroma. Surprisingly good from a brand that has almost become a cliche."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/28/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, toasted oats, raisin, light licorice, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Coal black, thick pour, sort of a frothy looking head, not quite as thcik or pillowly as I like.Smell is surprinsgly faint and distant; very heavily roasted malts, spiciness, anise, raisins., alcohol. More dried, dark fruits than chocolate and coffee. Taste is similarily unorthodox for the style; sweeter, more dark fruits, port, figs? Sort of simplistic RIS, not what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Opens with chocolate and light roast on the nose. Pours bright, deep chestnut under a ½” lightly tan tinted foam cap. A big palate starts with dark, bitter chocolate spiced with espresso with some fresh grain notes swimming through. Has a slight warming but the alcohol is smooth and not hot. Very creamy and chewy with medium low carbonation."

"First drink of this beer is very good until the bitter ending. I have gotten use to the milk stouts or even some of Guinness products have less of a bitter finish. Having said that I'm still going to finish the beer so it can't be that bad"
""
"Poured a deep deep brown, only noticeable under direct light. There a light tan head that doesn't last long, but still manages to leave some small soapy lacing. The aroma is a little mild for the style, with lighter notes of raisin and licorice. The taste, though, brings big flavors that the aroma misses, adding coffee and chocolate and a nice earthy hops quality. The body has nice weight and a slicker mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - very enjoyable RIS that leans on hops and presents a lot like a black ale."
""
"Overall it is a good stout. Good bitter dark chocolate and an interesting herb quality to it."

"Wake Up Dead reminds me of another Colorado RIS: Great Divide's Yeti (which is a tremendous compliment, and likely the reason my score is that much higher than the average). It similarly sees hop cones dipped in chocolate fondue and is sure to make an instant impression on beer geeks and casuals alike. As far as RISs go, this is an easy one to recommend."
""
"I generally like my beers on the colder side of what's recommended, but the flavor profile of this beer really comes through as it warms up. Not my first choice imperial stout, but not a bad option at all. An intense brew for sure, if nothing else."
""
""
""
""
"Spicy flavors of charred grain bitterness, earthy hop concentrate, black licorice, and booze. Definitely a fruity RIS with notes of dried berries and fig. Has a woodiness, which could be hop bitterness. There are softer flavors underneath, like creamed coffee and bourbon vanilla. Really unique. That nitro gas gives great feel. I wish the body wasn't lightened as much. Still close to rich. Leaning toward traditional English approach. Great beer."
""
""
""
"Nothing to dread about waking up dead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Don't know if it would be amazing out of a regular bottle, but the nitro really makes this strong stout excel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer, but it does leave a little depth to be desired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hey, nitro imperial is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the best AIS, but a good one. Vintage 2013 bottle can be revisited again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an excellent RIS. However, the aroma could be a bit stronger. I wasn't able to identify the dried fruits, and the tastes were predominantly cocoa, malt, and licorice. The latter enhances the flavor and makes this beer a bit unusual for the style."
""
"The Wake Up Dead on nitro is pretty cool, no widget and everything! Pours with the cascading bubbles, which pretty much makes me want to keep cracking them open and pouring, just for the hell of it. Seriously, it's just fun to turn that bottle upside down and dump the sucker into your glass, mesmerized when it stops just shy of the lip and doesn't foam over. The beer itself is super creamy, but not too rich. Not rich at all actually - outside of the creaminess from the nitrogen, it's actually lighter for the style. It is a bit boozy, but I suppose at over 10%, that should be expected. Still, it is noticeable and serves as a good reminder to have some water handy before bed."

"All around good drinking stout."
"Wow. This is one of the best imperial stouts I've had in a long, long time. This is the way I like them. Absolutely fantastic. I will be going to the store to pick up more of these for sure. Well worth the $6/bottle. Highly, highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bottle says it can be cellared for up to 7 years. I do not feel there would be any point. I do not think age will add anything and it is not too hot fresh. I would call this a second tier RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"Congrats to Left Hand...you hit the nail on the head"
""
""
""
""
"O: The balance between the roasted flavors and the alcohol was interesting. Seems like it should be more malty. The beer seemed to be too young; thinking about getting another bottle to store for 6-12 months, then try this again."

"O-overall an excellent beer. Reasonably priced and glad I found this little gem."
""
""
"Wake Up Dead is a decent Imperial Stout....but not my favorite....there is a weird twang on the back end. The beer poured an opaque dark with thin slightly off white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent carries some light roast. The taste is has touches of chocolate, roast and maybe a hint of espresso backed by an alcohol push. The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a decent stout and should be tried with delight."

"M- Medium body, creamy on the tongue, slight prickle afterwords."
""
""
""
"Overall: nice ris. Not a wow experience IMO but a solid brew."
"O: A well balanced stout. The chocolate and spice characters don't get in each other's way, though the flavors don't explode on your tongue like other competitors in this category. That said, this is a very drinkable beer and at 10% it's rare to take something like this down and not feel dried out or like your mouth has been rampaged."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a big, assertive imperial stout, but it is not overly complex. A good sipping beer, but not among the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad big stout, pretty one sided but worth a try and not overly pricey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good balance of extremes between roast bitterness and booze. Lacks a bit in malt body. This may age really well. A little hot and harsh right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good imperial stout with which to compare other impy stouts too. Good feel, standard, but very well done, dark malt flavors, and a slight warming from the booze."

"Overall a very good, and affordable RIS. Worth a revisit for sure."
""
"Overall, too much booze showing in this one. It'd be a lot better otherwise. Also a bit thin for an imp stout."
"O: I think this is two and a half years old...and at this age, it's just 'pretty good'. Not amazing, just pretty good. That could mean it was a mediocre RIS that improved marginally, or was a great stout that kind of deteriorated. Since the brewers say it has a 7 year life, and that the general flavor profile doesn't agree with me, I'll assume the former is true. Decent, but I probably won't buy again."

"22oz bottle with a Best By date of 02/28/2018. Pours a pitch black color with a thin layer of dark brown head. Some lacing. Aroma has lots of dark fruits along with caramel malts, earth, and hints of vanilla. The taste is more of the dark fruit flavors along with caramel malts, vanilla, licorice and even some marshmallows. Lots of raisin and figs. Booze with some bitter dark chocolate at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. This one's got a bit too much dark fruit flavor for me. Its not quite as balanced as I'd like it to be. Overall, mildly disappointing."

"Overall, this beer is perfect for a cold winter night. I like to recommend beers and what time of the year they remind me of and all stouts would remind me of the winter. My only complaint is that there is too much of a boozey quality. If you're into that, then this is the beer for you."
""
""
"Overall this just feels and tastes like an over-amped milk stout and I am not really getting into this at all."

"A nice burst of carbonation keeps flavors lively. The individual flavors are intense yet melded. Bitter coffee and bitter chocolate roll around the mouth and keep the sweet caramel and raisin/rum notes in check. Real nice flavor and mouthfeel but the finish lacks something - kind of leaves you hanging."
""
"O: With the abundance of great beers in the Russian Imperial Stout style, I find this beer to be fairly pedestrian and not really doing anything interesting (compared with others). A little too much char and ash for my preference."

"O/D-Was not impressed by this."

"Overall- A good example of the style. I really enjoyed this one."

"Overall a very smooth and tasty stout. Doesnt blow you away with flavors most stouts now days try to do but thats not the point of an RIS."

""

""

""
"O: I thought this was an average beer compared to other Russian Imperial Stouts and could have used more roasted flavors and bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Big complex dry beer with a unique character to the black malt. Leather and smoke hints and some dark dried fruit really make this a great sipper."
""

"it is very filling be careful with this hairy beast"
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: 22 oz. bottle aged 18 months in my beer cellar and poured into a Hamm's goblet"
"Bomber into 34oz mug. Black with a thick tan head. Smell is malty, a bit of yeast, and coffee. Taste is big, smooth coffee and chocolate at first, bittering out at the end and finishing relatively cleanly. Mouthfeel is full, could be a little smoother though. Still a great RIS, very drinkable for 10.2%. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep brown with a tiny ring of bubbles surrounding the brim of the glass. Smells of raisins plums and black cherry. Tastes is dominated by dark fruit and mellows out to a nice cherry chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with only slight carbonatin. Overall very good effort but not the best of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a flavorful and powerful brew that keeps the palate on its toes. I wouldn't describe it as a traditional RIS however, as the body is a little lighter than ideal, and the mouthfeel a shade too slick. It almost comes off as more of a hybrid between a stout and baltic porter. With that said, you can't fault Left Hand for crafting a brew with some attitude."
""
""
"I am somewhat dismayed at the price depending on which location I visit. One place I see 8.99 another 6.75...i chose the later as I once learned math long ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very solid stout. Well balanced flavor that is pleasurable throughout each sip. Light enough to enjoy at all times of the year, where a lot of stouts can be overwhelming (especially on hot days). Only real downside (for my preference) was the lack of head when pouring. Though this could be different on tap. Definitely recommended if you haven't had a chance yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not one of the better in this style. I lack a better balance; the sweetness dominates."
""
""
""
"O – Just awesome, has an unmatched balance and is quite easy to drink considering it's imperial nature. Best part of this one is all the licorice, chocolate, and roasted notes."
""
"Update: the LH website informs me that this brew is aged on site for at least 12 months before bottling. Nice!"
""
""
"As the brew warms, Wake Up Dead’s earthy hops, charred grains and the alcoholic burn of 10.20% ABV bully their way to the front and meld the other flavors together properly underfoot. Carbonation keeps things lively in the mouth and helps to create a thick and chewy mouthfeel. Overall, I am pleased with this one. What WUD lacks in strong flavors, it makes up in balancing the flavors it does have very well without the watered down characteristics of many a brewery’s attempt at this style of beer. Not overly expensive and pretty available in my experience, coughing up a few bucks for a bomber won’t hurt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't bad, but there are beter ones out there for less money to be sure. Drinks fairly easy for the ABV & style"
""
"O - Possesses many of the individual attributes of an imperial stout, but when combined does not work for me. Will not purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is an amazing and richly complex russian imperial that is not a one trick pony. This beer just entered my top 5 all time Russian imperials joining Epic Big Bad Baptist Surly the Darkness ,Firestone Parabola ,Founders Imperial and now this baby."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this wasnt a bad beer. Don't think age has done this well. Glad I got to rereview it, but I know my original review was 4's across the board. Oh well."
""
""
"Dead in its demeanor, the beer is certainly alive with taste and texture. It's ""awake"" attributes are inviting, invigorating, and highly satisfying. Its a delicious imperial stout that begs for the accompaniment of walnuts and fruited cheese."
""
"O: so many Imperial stouts, and I've had a respectable share, that this beer comes in as run-of-the-mill. I certainly enjoyed it enough, but it didn't do anything to distinguish itself."
""
""
"Overall: I love imperial stouts doesn't mean I love this beer, it's well crafted and respectable. If you have a go-to imperial stout that is around the price range of this one, I honestly would say go for it. If you want to try something new and craving that smoother imperial than you might have found what you were looking for. Salud!"
""
""
""
"It wasn't everything I had hoped, but it was still tasty."

"Overall, perfectly creamy beer! A must have."
"Overall again nothing to run out and get again and I have better options I can think of but this Imperial stout has a taste of its own. Worth picking up for 7 bucks."
""
""
"Nice dark motor oil appearance with finger of off white head. Has good Cocoa and toffee aroma. Smooth and creamy. Chocolatey . Some notes of coffee in the bitterness. I believe I got this beer for around 6-7 bucks. Worth the money. Good to drink at any occasion.!!!"
"o - Overall a pretty good milk/American stout. Very sweet but that is nice in the nose especially, and the mouthfeel was great. I think I like the BA version a bit better but would still have this one again."
"This thing reminds me of Will Farrell in ""Old School"" after he's hit with that dart-- ""I like you man, you're crazy, but I like you""..."
""
""
"salud!"
""
""
""
""
"Above average Imp Stout. Some good things going on, but lacks in some of the finer areas to really make this a 4+ beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- I would consider this to be a good imperial stout. I would not consider it a favorite, but would probably buy again."
""
"Imperial Stout pours a black color, with a small creamy tan head. The small is smokey and malty, sweet hints of raisins, dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is very complex, first come chocolate that then mixes to a sweet raisin like flavor, strong coffee tastes that finishes with a boozy alcohol taste. Very complex taste very full flavor, but not the most drinkable. Overall a complex beer, enjoyable in slow sips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this would be better if some age could calm the bitterness some. Its a good, not great RIS as is."
""
""
"O-Overall this is a pretty damn good beer. I havent reviewed a beer in a while and when I tried this one it made me want to review it. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone. Even someone who maybe never tried something like it before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Good stuff. Will drink again. Saying that this is just another dark beer brewed by Left Hand might sound like an insult, but when the boys in Longmont go for a dark beer they usually nail it and this is no exception."
""
"Very dense and smooth feel make for a pleasant sipper. Creamy chocolate, fruity, and warming."
"Not the best imperial stout in the world, but worth trying. I do like the label."
""
"O: This is a solid beer, but nothing amazing. For the price it is worth it. I would for sure try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid RIS, glad that I let it age for about a year, carb level is spot on, taste is completely appropriate for the style. An excellent offering by Left Hand, solid price point. ABV is hidden quite nicely. I like it, great example of the style, good value."
""
"Overall a good beer, you can taste some alcohol but for its abv it's not much. This is a very good imperial stout with a big kick but is very reasonably priced."
""
""
"Was pleasantly surprised. I don't think of Left Hand when I think of big Imperial stouts, but this made me sit up and take notice. Will definitely be going back for more. I thought Lost Abbey's Serpent's Stout was a steal for $10. But this is $4 less and just as enjoyable. I knew it would be good because I tried it at the tasting room last week. But this is better than I remember."
"Okay, absent the bourbon :( this is still a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up while on vacation in Denver. Dark brown, almost black pour with two finger head that fades quickly with pretty decent lacing. The nose is almost totally non-existent. A very subtle hint of roast, but that's it. It does open up slightly as it warms with a bit of smokiness. The taste is sweet and roasty with hints of cocoa, burnt toast, coffee, caramel, toffee, and just a touch of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but at the same time a bit thin for the style. Overall this is very average and a bit disappointing."
"The taste is altogether different. First, I noticed a strong alcohol presence. Second, there is a coffee with cream flavor. There's also stone fruit in the background, but the swallow features a hop, not malt, bitterness. The swallow and aftertaste is all alcohol warmth. The body is thin like most stouts, but the low carbonation makes it seem creamy."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm pretty impressed at how well they hide the alcohol in this. Oh, don't get me wrong -- it's there, but for a 10% beer, this is as tasty and rich as I could ever want. Really lovely brew, this."
""
""
"Very dark brown with a flash head and minimal lacing, smells very faintly of roasted malt and a tiny bit of ash. Could really use some amplification of aroma. At least the level of flavor is adequate. I taste semi-charred malt, black coffee, licorice, baking chocolate, and little flashes of star anise. Gains dark fruits / raisins as it warms up. Medium body and carbonation levels. If only the aroma was more robust to match the strength of the flavors contained within..."
""
""
"Taste follows the nose, dark sweetness to start, some peeks of fruit in the middle, and an alcoholic close. Mouthfeel is slickery smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Not bad."
"Overall this is pretty good. For the price it's pretty good. Should be stored for a year or two."
""
""
"OVERALL: This one was alright. While the nose was lousy at absolute best, the feel was pretty solid and the taste was intersting enough to make this one worth-while. Not a must-try beer by any stretch of the imagination, but one worth giving a shot if it lands in your lap. Apparently there is a barrel aged version of this too..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent imperial stout with a slight milkiness to it."
""
"O- Pretty solid overall, nice imperial stout"
"Overall Left Hand sure knows how to do a beer on nitro... actually, this was the first time I had ever tried the base Wake Up Dead beer, and I like this better than the barrel-aged version. Very good."
""
""
""
"O - Not bad but nothing special"
""
"Bomber bottled 3/13/12 poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a midnight brown/black with a thin tan head that shrinks down with nice lacing. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, raisin, vanilla, and oak. Taste is toasted barley, bitter chocolate, coffee, plums, raisins, cherry, vanilla, and cream. Medium mouthfeel and a tad over carbonated. Really good."
""
""
"Thin palate, but has some good flavor. Coffee, chocolate, super roasted malts, maybe some black licorice. A nice warm finish. Good sipper, but a palate that's on the thinner side."
"If I am looking for really strong nightcap to knock my socks off, this beer is not it. If I am looking for a solid Imperial Stout for someone who is newer to this genre than this will do just fine."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, bottled on 8/8/11. This pours a little less thick that some imperial stouts, the poured color is pitch black with a short lived mocha head. The smells are of dark roasted malts, molasses, alcohol. The feel is thicker than expected. The taste is a little disappointing, molasses, some dark roasted malts, but more molasses than anything else and I prefer the dark bitter espresso taste of my favorite stouts."
""
"4.0 D: Solid imperial. Good, complementary flavors with a great mouthfeel."
""
""
"poured into pint glass. Another one of my favorite breweries. Nice beer overall. Dark color not much head. Taste ok and chocolatey went down pretty smooth but not the best. Very strong beer not to be taken lightly. Serious beer drinkers will love this imperial stout"
"Overall - 3/5 - an enjoyable beer but I think the one I had may have not fully fermented or else there is just to much residual sweetness for me."
""
""
"O: Overall, not bad, an interesting take on Imperial Stouts, certainly worth a try. Not being a licorice fan, I was hesitant to try this, but it worked well."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very very dark brown that was almost black, with a light brown 1 finger head. After 5-10 minutes a thin layer was left that clung well to the sides. Aroma was slightly sweet, just a hint of milk chocolate and some roasted grains. Very slightly bitter up front on the tip of the tongue, mellowed out to a sweet almost milk stout, but finished up bitter and slightly burnt. Felt great in the mouth, coated very nicely. The finish to the flavor really dragged the beer down overall. The ABV seemed to hit a bit faster than expected."
""
""
""

"Bottle from The Wine Seller in Ann Arbor. Pours jet black with a small mocha head. Burnt coffee aroma, roast, light bittersweet chocolate. Taste is bitter, big hops and roast influences here, with some light bittersweet chocolate on the back end. A little light bodied for an imperial stout, mostly roast flavor with some bite on the back end. Decent stout, but not in the great category. Tried it, but won't seek it out again. At least easy to find."

"Deep brown with a lighter mocha-tan colored head. Thick molasses, coffee, malt, sugared plums and dates and smoke all present themselves in the nose. Really great aroma. Boozy, sour molasses and bready coffee malts on the initial sip. Bittersweet chocolate, dark sugared fruits (plums, cherries dates) and alcohol through into the finish, which is quite bitter and dry. Lots of strong, boozy aftertastes that linger for a very long time. Mouthfeel remains bitter and dry. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Lots of flatter tastes and alcohol flavor than i was expecting. A big fan of Left Hand brews, and an even bigger stout fan, AND the true greatness of it's aroma, it hurts to say that this really wasn't very good overall."
"OVerall - Decent, not overly flavorfull or that alcohol crush that makes it feel like a big beer. Mild and smooth, good flavors, just nothing special, but worth a drink."

"Pours pitch black out of a 22 ounce bomber, from Longmont CO, I literally like every beer I've had from Left Hand. Thick tan head forms nicely with a pitch black body glancing back at me. Aroma has dark fruit, coffee roasts, with vanilla bean creaminess. Flavor is great big roast, big dark malt character with more vanilla slipping in to the fun...That's when things get out of control with big alcohol and chocolate notes burping up a booze background at 10.2% abv I see why? Mouthfeel is full bodied with mellow carbonation slick oily texture that lasts throughout each sip, kind of hard to get through. Overall A beer that is worth it's credibility as a big stout in the bottle from Left Hand, I'm not sorry I tried it."

"O: I thought this was a strange stout. It reminded me of a stout mixed with a barleywine. Not my favorite."
"O- Not bad, not great, but pretty good. Great beer to try and would pick up if I saw again."
"Overall - A rather nice imperial stout. A nice warming brew with a good roasty, but balanced taste as well as very pleasing mouthfeel."
"O - A damn tasty impy stout. I would get this again if my local shop would consider putting this on its shelves again."

"This is still a decent Imperial Stout, though, and especially at the incredibly low price I purchased it for."
"O: I was worried about this after seeing some bad reviews...my bottle date, at this duration, is solid...not a bad brew."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was good but when compared to other Imperial Stouts it seems to be just slightly above average. It had good drinkability, it was smooth for the style and the alcohol was hidden nicely, I think I could take out the whole bottle but I am glad I am splitting this with my brother. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it had good balance between roasted malts and dark fruits and the alcohol wasn't that noticeable. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance and the lack of carbonation, it was just too light for the style and it needs a little more carbonation to it. I don't think I would buy this beer again, but it was a pretty good value for what it was, and I would only recommend this to people that like a big dark fruit aspect to their Imperial Stouts. This beer was ok for what it was but as a whole I thought it was pretty middle of road and it couldn't hold it's own against some of the best in the style. Left Hand is a pretty solid brewery but this beer fell short of being a great beer, but I still wouldn't mind trying the barrel aged version. In the end I could take or leave this beer."

"Flavorwise I got thrown for a loop, hops and tobacco flavors, this is a stout? I liked it, but I'm a hophead, my husband who prefers robust stouts called this a dissapointment. To me it was an enjoyable, yet mislabelled brew."

"Appearance is black with a ruby hue. There is more than a finger of head that quickly dissipates, but leaves nice lacing in its wake. There is dark fruit in the nose of this offering. The taste is dry and roasty with the taste of raisins in the background. Finally, there is a mild alcohol finish to that is not unpleasant."
""
""
"Overall: Strange. Not so drinkable, not too pleasurable. More of a Black IPA, I would say...but it is at least better than the horrible barrel-aged version!"
""
""
"Glad I tried this, I'd like to try it again some time."
""
"Appearance is dark brown, tan head, some lacing going on. Its` nose contains brown sugar, licorice and caramel. The taste is some toffee, a bit of chocolate and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium-full. A good imperial stout, but nothing too special imho."

"O: Great IS I really enjoyed the mash of mild sweet and bitter. Alcohol was a huge factor but considering the ABV I expected that. Nothing too overpowering except the alcohol once warmed, but all in all a solid IS. This I will house frequently and I definitely recommend."
"whoa! pours thick syrupy black with a minimal tan head. smells really intense, smokey with notes of licorice and bourbon. flavor is absolutely massive. im picking up tobacco, candied sugar, molasses, raisins (post review ive been informed the bottle says raisins!), and that funny birch syrup characteristic that sierra nevada's life and limb has, really really unique. full bodied as can be, sticky residue left over. plenty of bubbles too, but maybe a bit thick, not too too sweet. overall this stout is something different. theres nothing like it out there as far as im concerned, and this has to be one of lefthands best beers. wow this is great, definitely worth a try!"

"The mouthfeel is very alive, surprising for this style, but very appetizing. There's a good viscosity to the beer, medium bodied, not thick like other imperial stouts, just smooth and creamy. My mouth seems to water as I drink it, very tasty and quite welcoming. Quickly warming, not as boozy on the palate as the nose, but still certainly a little boozy. A fine brew."

"Sampled on January 9, 2012. It pours a very dark brown to almost black with a moderate, tan head and clinging lacing. Aromas envelope a wide array of dark malts, coffee grinds, and bitter hops but little in the way of sweetness or dark fruits. The body is around medium. The taste is also a combination of dark malts, bitterness, and coffee. No chocolate of note. There are better Imperial Stouts out there but this has its attributes."

"Dark brown in the glass with a modest head. Big malt with more tart than sweet in the profile. Some hop bitterness comes along in the aftertaste. Nicely carbonated on the tongue with a rich but not syrupy mouthfeel. Aroma of fruitcake and sherry. Kind of murky and a touch medicinal. Not so user-friendly as many other big alcohol beers. I would skip the second glass but it's a 22 oz bottle."

"OA I like it and would go for some more of it but not thrilled with it. Just a good quality stout not too imperial."
"one on draft."
"(O) I really like this stout. I had it before after a long day and I thought it was great then and to get another crack at it was pleasant. Wasn't quite the same the second time around, which goes to show that the moment and mindset you are in will make a big difference on how you enjoy a beer, but it was very enjoyable all the same."
"O - I really liked this stout! Thought the balance was quite nice. Not a crazy flavor profile but what it offered made me happy."

"An OK beer, not really a ringing endorsement. Haven't had many stouts at this price point."
""
""
"Poured a 2"" light mocha head and appears to exhaust all the effervescence in the first pour. Dark as coffee. Smell is almost nonexistent until a little warm and then only mildly of roasted malt. Flavor has coffee and malt and I don't personally pick up the label's own descriptors of raisin or licorice. Aftertaste does express dark chocolate. And I really don't get any hops. An enjoyable beer but not the most complex nor the poster child of Imperial Stouts."
"O: Overall, what was intended by the brewer may or may not have been achieved, but it is still a enjoyable beer."
""

"Lovely. Poured with a large tan, foamy, head that settled down after a bit and some lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is roast, malt, yeast, cocoa, espresso. Flavor's much the same as nose and drinkable. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is of good length, enticing. and that's it. Oh and a little boozy."
"Overall - I'm kinda bummed. There are really some great flavors here, but the alcohol gets pretty hot, and the mouthfeel is broken up by the higher carb. I wanted to like this alot more. I'll finish this bomber, but I won't likely purchase it again."
"Oa: not bad, not too special. Worried about the sludgey stuff."
"O- This is not a imperial stout! More of a double black ipa if anything. Not a terrible beer, but had to downgrade it because of the style."
"O: this beer is a mess. It misses the mark on style, and also misses the mark on tasting good. Do yourself a favor...pass this one up. Lefthand makes plenty of other tasty brews, this however is not one of them."
"I'm glad I bought two bottles of this, because I'm aging the second in the hopes of mellowing and cleaning it up. The flavors are solid, so we'll revisit this when it's mellowed a bit."
"D - The taste is not as typical for an imperial stout. Very smooth flavor with a heavy emphasis on the chocolate malt but lacking the heavy roastiness associated with most Imperial Stouts. Unique flavor that sets it aside from the others. Very enjoyable!"
"This beer has to warm up if it is pulled cold. My first couple sips were from a beer poured at fridge temperature, and it was plain bad at that temperature. But as it warmed, it truly woke up and became a nice enjoyable beer. I am reviewing the beer after warning to 50+ degrees."
"A solid Impy Stout from the folks at Left Hand. Worthy of a try."
"A nice imperial stout."
"This beer doesn't have any distinct flavors that jump out at me but its got a nice heavy and creamy body that goes down really smooth. It tastes like an imperial stout should, rich in dark malts. Its not very boozy tasting though, which is surprising given the abv."
"Very good beer, not one I could drink often due to its thickness."
"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours dark, but some translucence shows through, looks a little like root beer. Loose head quickly dissapated but decent lacing. Nose is alcohol, roasted malt, and burnt match. Taste seems dominated by alcohol with subdued coffee and light fruitiness, would like to see a bit more kick from the roasted malt. Mouthfeel fairly creamy with carbonation a bit on the light side. Overall okay for the style, but there are plenty of better options available."
"Mouthfilling creaminess created by the nitro tap. An easy drinking imperial stout, would be a good gateway imperial stout."
"Overall a very good imperial stout. You know a beer like this is impressive when you can enjoy it without chilling it at all. I'm impressed."
"Overall - Good beer."
"O: A decent Stout."
"For some reason I fully expected this to be better than the Barrel Aged. I was wrong. Avoid this."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, but the flavor fell short of my expectations in a number of ways. I think that there may have been a wild yeast starting to get in here as it is a bit too thin with that mild phenolic, it just seems like this beer might be suffering from a mild infection. It's not bad enough that I am wanting to pitch my beer, but I wouldn't plan to cellar the version bottled on 3/28/2011 if I were you...or keep a close eye on it."
"Nice, thick mouthfeel. Carbonation eases off quite nicely. About the only thing stopping me from having another is the ABV."
"Taste is just as fun, chocolaty as all hell and roast just right. Powdery, fluffy and light on the palate. Hops are subtle yet firm on the finish, although the flavoring lupulin is not to be ignored. It is on the sweeter side as far as RIS's are concerned, which I like. I am regretting buying only 1 bottle right now, I will have to see if there is more available, I think a year (at max) might help things integrate further. Wake up Dead Has a smoothness usually reserved for barrel-aged beers that is nice, even a hint of coconut as it warms.I can see where the name comes from, it would be all too easy to drink a couple bombers in a sitting. I am very impressed, quite a delicious treat. Love the label art too. Left Hand is a more than capable brewery that I am happy to be in the distro range of."
"Just a bit too much bite for me. I don't mind high ABV beers, but I like the alcohol to be a bit more subdued. This was in your face the second you popped the top."
"This is an alright imperial stout, but not really a standout in any way."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights when backlit and a creamy mocha head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Coffee, cookie dough and anise in the aroma with faint floral hop notes. I'll say this..Wake Up Dead is a tasty brew, if not really true to the style. Rich brown sugar and caramel cube sweetness with roasted malty flavors with a coffee like bitterness and fruity hop flavor to balance. Medium light bodied and creamy with a slightly dry, chalky finish. A fine ale indeed but I don't think the ""black ale"" description on the label is close and this is not really an Imperial Stout but is good beer anyway."
"O: While this is a decent beer I'm not sure if it should be listed as an Imperial Stout. This is much more like an Imperial Porter. The"
"overall - for price and what not this is an exceptional brew."
"The aroma was rich with roasted malts and chocolate. Some light hints of bournon and oak and a touch of dark fruits. As it warmed a very nice burnt carmale like note coming through as it starts to warm. The flavor was more of the same, though it took on a much coffee like bitterness that was very welcome. Rich and dark, forboding, this was a really intense stout. Led by bitter chocolate and coffee and a touch of an alcohol note, it was everything I had hoped it would be. Smooth, delicate profile with nice carbonation. For 10% it was remarkably drinkable and that was really a testament to how good this beer was."
"Overall, a very complex and tasty sipper."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch tan head that fades to an oily film. Nice latticework of lacing forms around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits (raisins/plums), roasted dark malt, and slight chocolate syrup. Taste is of dark roasted malt, chocolate syrup, slight coffee, and even slighter black licorice. Very mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. A nice carbonation level makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout from Left Hand. I am glad I picked this up in CO."
"Pour is a one head wonder of loose foam, but clinging lace. Head went south in less than a minute, but the lace just keeps hanging around. The color is a 39-40, with no light shining through. Smell is sweet with aromas of molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, coco, malt, and hops. Taste is well balanced with flavors of chocolate, toffee, molasses, vanilla, spices, green apple, raisins, coffee, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with a feeling of cream and zing in my mouth. Just a little bitter on the sides of my tongue. Great desert beer, and the price is good. Yes this is on my buy again list."
"You know, i admit when I am wrong... this is pretty good."
"Overview- Solid beer. Although I tried it in the dead heat of a Texas summer, I felt like it would be well-suited for colder weather."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malt and dark fruit with quite a bit of anise mixed in. The flavor is mainly made up of roasted malt and chocolate, although there is some anise in there as well. The alcohol is well hidden but becomes more apparent as the beer warms up. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. A nice imperial stout."
"Overall-I think this was a very solid beer that I would definItely pick up again."
"D- I thoroughly enjoyed the bomber of this imperial stout, but I don't think this is a beer I could drink a sixer of, and at 10%, I don't think I would want to. But when you are drinking an imperial stout it is not intended to be a sessionable beer, and I believe this beer is a great representation of the style"
"This beer enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, OK. The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a trace of tan head that laces well, buy has poor retention. The aroma has notes of chocolate, dark fruit and some coffee. The taste starts with dark fruit and then move to chocolate and finishes with coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced with a slightly velvety feel. Overall a great beer."
"O- is a solid double a touch bitter and is skewed on the dark fruit side ,but it was a pleasure on tap"
"I know the barrel-aged version of this doesn't get much love, but I was in the minority as I thought it was pretty solid. This is similar in that it is heavier on the dark fruits rather than chocolate/coffee, and a bit thin in the mouthfeel compared to others in the style. Still a good and enjoyable Imperial Stout."
