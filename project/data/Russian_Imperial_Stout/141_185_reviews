"Finish is absent.  Little to no aroma.  Lacking the robust stout feel."
"Glass- Snifter"
"drank fresh.  the hops on it are overwhelming for a stout.  it says on the label to drink now for hops and cellar for a refined malty experience.  they're not kidding.  the hops are big.  notes of coffee and chocolate are drowned out by the bitterness.  i should buy another one to cellar.  will review again if i do."
""
"An opaque, muddy body is crowned by a beautiful mocha head leaving the mug awash in picturesque lacing. The aromas are of cocoa nibs, dark chocolate, and a definite sting of black coffee. Nice, slightly sticky mouthfeel, with a definite swing towards bitter coffee grounds on the taste, rather than the chocolate of some other stouts I’ve experienced. I give it a slight ding, for a mild, hard to detect metallic finish, but it is there and keeping this one from scoring a 9. Would I drink it again? You know it."

"Pours jet black with an ample head, decent nose and underwhelming taste. It looks like I'm harsh in my numerical review - but I'm still giving the beer more than it deserves. Makes me wonder if I the keg was bad, actually. The worst part is how thin the beer is - a big imperial should have some viscosity."

"Nice stout! Big chocolate, coffee, roasted malts!"
"O: [3.50] This is really tasty beer.  It looks amazing in the glass.  The nose was a bit misleading for me (it had a great scent but it was different than the taste).  The taste is roasty malts and chocolate.  The alcohol is present and can be tasted - but isn't detracting on the taste.  The alcohol gives a bit of a dry finish.  Overall this is a good beer.  I think I would prefer to go with a Smuttynose Robust porter which has kick butt flavor at a much lower price and ABV."

"I imagine this would get better with age, but the hops were such a great part of the complexity that I'm glad I drank this fresh. Overall a solid beer that I will seek out again."

"Jet black with a ring of tan head, substantial lace on the glass. Smell is very hoppy, pine and citrus are front and centre before getting into the roasted malt, lightly burnt and anise notes, bits of chocolate and coffee as well. Taste is also fairly hop forward, good dose of chocolate and smoke, coffee and roast toward the finish, medium bitterness throughout, a fairly seemless mix of hops, roast and chocoaltey/coffee/smokey flavours, little to complain about here. Lightly carbonated, medium full creamy body. Really good stuff here, probably best to drink this fresh to get the most out of the hops in this one, very easy to drink imperial stout."

"Good, but not the best US created Imperial Stout I have had so far. Strong though."

"A robust stout that is worth a try. A bit coffee heavy but some like it that way."

"Enjoy"
"Overall -  The huge warmth in the back of my throat makes this a perfect sipping beer while a snowstorm rages on outside. A well crafted and incredibly smooth and full bodied stout, the aromas and flavors are really anything earth shattering, but executed with precision. Would consider picking up a second bottle of this before it leaves local LCBO's for at least another year."

"O:  A bargain at $6.50 a bomber at Hop City, Atlanta.  Goes so well with a slice of Hershey chocolate pie with almonds (a taste bud orgasm)."

"O 4.5 - I love everything this brewery does, and this is no exception - stellar Russian Imperial Stout with a fair price for a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  This is one of the most overlooked stouts out there, in my opinion this easily stands up with the best non-barrel-aged stouts on the market both fresh and aged.  With age this has held up surprisingly well still retaining perfect carbonation and plenty of flavor.  For picking this up for $8.50 was an absolute steal and I wish I purchased a few more."
""
""
"O - Great RIS and it reminds me of Yeti, FIS, and TenFidy. Maybe a touch more sweetness compared to those."
"This isn't a life changing world beating revelation but it's a sturdy and affordable imperial stout and one of the better offerings by this brewery in my opinion. Particularly enjoyed the full bodied aspect of this beer, something that seems to get lost a lot in this style at lower price points."

"This is a decent RIS, however the sourness, bitterness, green herbal hoppiness just don't sit well. Perhaps with some aging this might mellow out, but I think RIS should be brewed with all these things in mind, in order to be drank now. I'd definitely pass on buying it again. Maybe much better RIS's out there."

"Its a brilliant balance in a stout that ties together the extreme sensations of alcohol, fruit, spice and sweetness- built upon roasty stilts and relying on its own bigness to make it work. These brewers know how to build a big beer!"
""
""
"220z bomber dated Feb2015 poured into a snifter.  Black in color with a oil-slick like viscosity as a small mocha head retreats to a ring around the edge.  Lacing is evident as the coffee aroma dominates with each sip.  Chocolate, dark fruits, and licorice are there too.  Taste is made up of chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, and coffee being the most pronounced.  Lighly carbonated, thick and smooth, and extremely drinkable.  Earthy hops finish off the palate with a slightly dry bitterness that helps to complete this beauty of an Imperial Stout.  The sweetness I remember is not as noticeable to me but there's nothing wrong with that!  Love my Smutty!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This is part of the ""Big Beer Series"" and this is a Big Beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O- nothing fancy here, just a really good classic Russian Imperial Stout. Definitely worth a try"
"An excellent contender with the big boys. For something not barrel aged, it's tastier than dark lord and darkness (though I prefer bitter stouts).."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer pours an oily, jet black coloring with a thin, low profile, light brown head. Aromas of cocoa nibs, molasses, coffee, roasted notes, wood, and earth. Heavy, but never overpowering, and the nose remains balanced throughout. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a blast of bitter, dark roasted coffee, bitter baker's chocolate highlights, and some woody and earthy highlights. Initially robust in mouth, but transitions to a slick, light feel by the end of the palate. Roasted, rich coffee aftertaste, with campfire smoke highlights, and a slick, slightly bitter, lingering finish. Solid, rugged stout."

"Would love to revisit this after aging a while. Fairly complex, but the roast dominates now. Those underlying notes may become more pronounced in a few years."
""
""
""
"Pours an impenetrable black with a fleeting head of dark brown cream and just a hint of lacing; looks thick. The nose runs deep with warm stout character – rich, bittersweet fudge, mocha, cake batter, and a surprising amount of booze – and the palate follows suit. Tastes like gooey brownie batter laced with notes of crispy pie crust, vanilla, and ashy roasts, with a touch of dark fruit. Very satisfying. In contrast, the carbonation is pretty fizzy, and there’s a dry, flowery hop bitterness that ends up pretty significant as it winds down; in the end, it leaves this more crisp than I expected. Definitely one to seek out."

"O: This one is too young. Plain and simple. A couple of years will make it great - I have no doubt of that. But right now, it's too simplistic and too boozy. I'll buy this again, but only to age a bottle for a few years. Since I'm a firm believer that a beer should be ready as soon as its released, this scores average to me."
""
""
""
"Everything an imperial stout should be. Great complexity and balanced with all the flavors you crave. Exceptional!"

"Overall this beer is very true to the style and a very enjoyable beer to enjoy. Might benefit from some time in a cellar to round out the alcohol bite."

"Very nice example of an RIS. Again a fairly priced product that makes this an easy choice among many fine comparisons. Speaking of which, this reminds me of SN's Narwhal-one of my favorites. But today I say-Make mine a Smutty!"
"Loved this one. Great price, too."
""
""
""
"Had a 2011 and 2010 vintage last night. Both looked great in the glass. Both smelled fantastic. Mouthfeel was creamy and luscious. The 2010 beat the 2011 in one category - taste. The '11 had a hit of booze still in it, while the '10 was totally smoothed out, and all you could taste was chocolate goodness. Great beer when fresh, but with 3-4 years in the cellar, this Imperial Stout aged quite well."
""
""
""
"I had this at a tasting last night. I had the privilege of trying both the 2013 vintage and also as a special treat the 2008 vintage. The difference was absolute. The 2013 vintage was good with everything that you would expect from a great imperial stout. The 2008 vintage was just amazing, the aroma and the taste of the beer completely changed. The 2013 vintage has a much more bitter flavor profile and the alcohol was much more present. The 2008 vintage had very little alcohol flavoring so the true flavors of the beer really opened. The roasted malts dark fruits and hints of vanilla were just perfect. Both vintages were great and I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An edgy beer all around. There's a lot of bitterness going on between the hops and the roasted malts. A good amount of charred flavor too. This will put some hair on your chest. Like Smutty's robust porter, this could be a good pairing with the right cigar. Unfortunately I don't know enough about cigars to offer a suggestion. I only smoke them a few times a year. I would bet that this has some great extended aging potential too. Probably tastes great around that 3-5 year mark, maybe longer. They sell vintage bottles at the brewery if you aren't the patient sort."

"I always felt this was a very good example of the style. It's well executed and there's not much to complain about. It's a very good example of what Smuttynose is capable of and it's one of my favorites from the brewery. It's a fun beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall: A satisfyingly indulgent, desert-like beer. It paired nicely with cheese and a venison burger. Maybe just a little too sweet to be overly quaffable. More akin to a port wine."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a quality big and bold imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. Very much on the fruity/charry side of RISes. Not a whole lot of chocolate or coffee that you usually find (and that I usually prefer). Quite dry too. Very little sweetness in general and very dry in the finish. Definitely a bit different than most. Will have to try this fresh someday to compare. Pretty good but I'm a bit biased towards more sweet, chocolatey and coffee based RISes."
"O: Pretty solid RIS. Not the best I've had, but definitely glad I purchased it. I would have loved to try a new one and compared it to an aged beer like the one I just drank. I may have to purchase one more to save for another year or two to see how it transforms. At $7.00 at 22 oz, it's a steal for an RIS. Once again, another solid offering from Smuttynose."

"Verdict: A very fine stout from Smuttynose. Their isn't a ton of complexity here, but the beer is very balanced and easy to drink. A worthy take on the Russian Imperial Stout and one I hope that gets brewed again in the future."
""
""
"O – This is a really nice RIS. It’s big, bold, and complex enough while remaining very drinkable. It has all the elements that I would look for in a beer of this style. This is an awesome beer from Smuttynose. They really have yet to disappoint me."
"Medium-heavy to heavy in weight, with carbonation levels of medium to medium-low intensity, leading to a smooth, thick mouthfeel with an appropriately low amount of fizz to induce sipping. Closes dry, with significant stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty easy to drink it now but I imagine after a couple years this one will mellow out and balance to become an absolutely amazing beer. / My prediction was correct. This one drinks scary easy and has an absolutely amazing flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I had heard some good things, so I finally decided to bring this one up from the cellar after sitting on it for about a year. Very similar to the Imperial Russian Stout by Stone which I just drank last week. You get superior value at only $6.99 a bottle. You can't afford not to get this. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"This is an amazing porter; my stomach isn't completely happy but my mouth is"
""
""
"O - A really nice imperial stout. I got this on discount, so it probably has some age on it. The alcohol is hidden well and probably mellowed out a bit. Excellent flavor."
"Taste-Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark orchard fruits, underlying warming alchohol. A solid, all around RIS."
""
"Overall: Good elements here, but the taste department is a touch lacking. While there is good balance between sweet and bitter, it feels like there is a lack of cohesion among the competing influences in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is spot-on for what I look for in the style, with big notes of dark chocolate fudge and earthy coffee. A bit of roasted malts and caramel as well. Hops are muted, but balanced. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering. Chewy mouthfeel isn't too thick, but instead nicely carbonated and drinks well across the palate. I would love to try a barrel-aged version of this--I think the body and flavors would hold up very, very nicely."

"Great brew - very happy with both the Smuttynose ""Big Beer"" offerings. A well crafted imperial."
"What a huge chocolate forward imperial stout. Very tasty and even the aging hasn't mellowed out all of the alcohol at this stage. A very well done beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a bit hot smelling but it's still quite enjoyable. I could have this again."
"M&D - a straight forward and tasty RIS, doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, doesn't surprise you with anything, just some nice flavors and a warm feeling, nice RIS"
""
"This serves as a good benchmark for a typical RIS. Nothing extraordinary, just a solid big stout."
""
""
""
"I'd be failing in my duty if i didn't mention how suprised i was at how non cheese-like the aged hop character in this beer is. It really is remarkable, i've had beers younger that tasted terrible. This is the 2nd 4+year old smuttynose beer i've opened this week, and both have been remarkable. I guess they have really good quality control and a thorough understanding of all that makes a beer age gracefully. Kudos, guys!"
""
""
"I've had issues with this beer over the years being just too damn hot fresh, so I decided to age this one for a couple of years and revisit it. It's smoother with a few years on it and much more enjoyable. I'm really impressed with how well this beer ages. And well priced to boot."
""
"Overall very balanced with some nice robust flavors."
""
"O - Definitely a tasty, enjoyable stout, without being overwhelmingly memorable. I especially enjoy the smoke at the back of the palate, a distinctive characteristic. Finally, at $5.99/bomber this is an outrageously good deal. I normally avoid cheap RISes like a case of the clap, as a low price tag can be indicative of sloppiness, haste and a general lack of attention to detail. Not true here - this is a complete steal, and at this price it has my highest recommendation."
"O: a good stout for sure, a bit sweet but well balanced, would recommend."
""
"This pours jet black with a small ebony colored head that fades quickly. The viscosity of this is visible on the pour. Smells is full of coffee and chocolate. Not much else going on. Smells appealing. Taste is spot on. Nice bitter chocolate flavor that is rounded out with roasted malts. Very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall I loved this. Haven't really found a stout I haven't enjoyed though."
""
"O - An impressive Russian Imperial Stout, but nothing that shatters the mold. I'd still pick up another bottle if the price was right (and it usually is with Smuttynose)."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-above average but i hoped for more..."

"Overall: Though some of the flavors in this one really work, the alcohol was very unbalanced and detracted from the enjoyable aspects of the beer. As the beer warmed, the alcohol's distraction only increased. This one certainly has potential, perhaps with a lower ABV, but overall a disappointment based on my expectations. I certainly would not go out of my way to try this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O- So smooth! Great beer and I will certainly return to this one in the winter if able"
""
""
""
"Overall -- At $6.99/bomber I will be buying a lot of this as I assume it will only improve with age. The 2011 is so smooth so I can't wait to see how it drinks in 2-3 years. Really a great brew"
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a less hoppy Shakespeare Stout which is one of my favorites. Yet for a few less shekels and a higher ABV, this gives ol' Billy Shakes a run for his money."

"Overall-- this isn't bad, considering how inexpensive and relatively available it is. I have a few other bottles that I will try aging for a while to see if that booziness drops out."
"Certainly this a good example of the style. And maybe it is young? But it doesn't strike me as an elite RIS, and it isn't as smooth, balanced and complex as many. If I had scored it inside of the first 30 minutes, though it wasn't opened cold, it would have scored much lower."
"A stout that is priced great, i will grab more next release."
"Pours a nice dark black with a thick dark head to go with it. Malt flavor is great with slight hints of dark fruits and caramel. Could use a little more hop bitterness to help balance it out. This would be a great beer to sit back and drink and relax. I'm impressed with this one and I'll be buying it again."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Let me start off by saying I cannot believe a bomber of this is only $7. Instantly the best value I can remember in some time. I poured this straight down the center of a pint glass and it generated a well appointed, 2"" crown. The head was soooo thick and stiff (ba dum tish). A nice, opaque body with an espresso like foam crown. Simply beautiful. The nose is big on roasted coffee and with a good whiff of booze and a permeation of vanilla. The taste follows the nose well with some added oakiness, chocolate, and a bit of cherry. The mouthfeel's the allstar here. This is what I want from my stouts. I nice, thick, substantial presence on the tongue. The aftertaste is slightly bitter with some more charred wood notes. Overall, this is one of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had. World class."
"i like this one and can't wait to find a specialty stout from their big series in the future."
"O: A Very good imperial stout true to the style, very quintessential in my book. Good job smutty!"
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"O: A very rich and creamy RIS with a good dose of hops and a nice thick body. Great aftertaste as well."
"Overall: This beer is only so-so. The taste and mouthfeel leave a lot to be desired in comparison with the better imperial stouts. Not a beer that I would buy again."
"O: Great balance of flavors & feel. Very solid offering. I'm interested to see what some time does to this. Would love to get my hands on some older vintages."
"Overall: Not bad--especially for the price. Fruity aroma and chocolaty flavor get an A, but the bitter hop notes provide balance, and then some. Still, an enjoyable brew overall!"
"Pours a blackish brown, off white head and lace. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee and licorice. In the taste, robust malts, smoke, cocoa, and some coffee presence. Standard imperial stout flavor, deeply roasted malts, more coffee and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth. Overall, a tasty Russian Imperial stout, worth revisiting."
"Overall a very tasty, well made, and pretty complex beer, even if the appearance and smell aren't amazing. Well balanced and not overbearing. Stands out from a lot of other imperial stouts to me."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on the top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and citrus zest/herbal hops. I am also getting some cinnamon aromas as the beer warms. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, and a citrus zest hop kick on the finish. A mild roast/hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with a nice hop presence that I wasn't expecting."
"Overall: This must have been a hoppy RIS because 1 year later and i still get some grapefruit. Very good. and worth your time."
"This is tasty. I love Smuttynose."
"overall one of my favorite go-to inpy stouts..good price, available..I love this beer.."
"Maybe it needs time to settle? Probably. Does that mean it will taste better? Um, most likely not. I did hear some asshats say that this beer is better than Kate. Well.... You are wrong. And saying something like that you should be flogged."
"D - a bit sweet but very enjoyable, a 22 oz. bottle is very easy to drink through."
"OVERALL: This one was certainly a disappointment. Besides the full, creamy palate, which was by far the best quality of the beer, this one is too boozy and tobacco heavy to compete with the top examples in the style. While their Baltic Porter is a fantastic brew that I’d recommend to friends, this is one I’d suggest steering clear of. This vintage at least. Thanks again for the trade jojomdma."
"D/O- Being as well balanced I enjoyed this. Pretty middle of the road but recommended at the price point. Smuuuutttyyyy!"
"O: A really good beer. I'd enjoy it again. Glad to have tried it. Very much a good RIS that isn't too hoppy or too sweet but also hides the alcohol better than most."
"O - A nice drinkable RIS, not a big monster beer, but plenty of complexity. Love the price as well, see it for $5/bomber locally."
"This midnight colored beer is served in a snifter glass at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY. The dark tan head hints at the slight carbonation this beer has. The nose on this beer hints at the high alcohol content (9.8%) in the beer. The taste is of bittersweet chocolate, thickness like molasses, and nice finish with no bitterness."
"D: Overall a good RIS that I would gladly drink again. In my opinion, I would prefer a slightly bit more carbonation to make this less flat, but nonetheless, still a satisfying end product."
"Overall, while I do admire the brashness and flipside-of-subtle burnt malt flavors, it does seem that the beer is slightly unbalanced, and anyone not already familiar with even some of the weaker Imperial Stouts on the market is going to have a tough time with this one. Newcomers should thus try at their own risk, but more experienced connoisseurs will no doubt find much in here to discuss and enjoy."
"Top notch IMP Stout folks."
"This is one of the many underrated imperial stouts out there from one of the most underrated breweries going. If you have not torn through Smuttynose's Big Beer Series then do so. NOW!"
"D: The overall drinkability of this stout is good, but not really the best example of this style."
"O - Brew is a little rough around the edges. Some time would do this brew very well, let the heat fall-off a bit. Very glad I got to try this brew. Well worth finding and trying."
"O-Not the best RIS out there but a solid one. I'd be interested in aging it to see what happens."
"O: I've had this one on the shelf of my cellar for over a year and even many craft beer nerds who come over(who readily get this stuff in their area) ask how it is. Well... now I know."
"O - Overall a solid take on the style. Smooth, full, and flavorful. Time to go enjoy the rest on the deck!"
"O- Good RIS. Could be thicker and would like to try with another year on it."
"Solid midnight black with a three finger dense tan creamy head. The first smell is vanilla and espresso. Much lighter in smell than in taste. Rich vanilla extract with a hit of alcohol, bourbon, ripe fruit, chocolate milk, and dark roasted coffee beans. Deep long lingering flavors. Medium velvety body with a creamy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, rich and slightly syrupy, but with a dry smokey finish. Buzz words apply. Intense and robust! This might be the best thing I have ever had to drink. Decadent."
"A really great RIS. Great all around, although it is a bit overly sweet. The creaminess and mellow flavors are awesome. Another winner from one of the countries finest breweries."
"overall, this is what I want out of an imperial stout. dry and very lightly carbonated, huge roasted dark flavors, looks and acts sort of like motor oil in a glass and a big boozy finish. And on top of it all, the bomber was just a hair over $5. This is truely a ""big beer"" like the label says and one of my top imperial stouts."
"Overall this is a good beer, lacking viscosity to be a great beer but very enjoyable nonetheless on a rainy New Hampshire night."
"Note: 2011 vintage"
"O - It's odd to give all fours, but that's where I'm at. A solid beer from Smuttynose."
"O- A great stout. Not really too aggressive. And at 9.8%, its pretty approachable and a sipper. Well done. I've enjoyed everything from Smutty thus far."
"O-Very good variation of a wonderful style. A must try!"
"overall i was impressed by this beer. don't get me wrong, didn't expect to not like it, but it proved to be one of the tastier imperial stouts i've had recently. would definitely recommend."
"Another great beer by Smuttynose. High ABV. But not too noticeable. Feels and tastes great! If you can try this on tap it's a must try!"
"O - A damn good imperial stout, and for the price you really can't beat it. I'll have no problem polishing off this big stout tonight!"
"o- fantastic beer, glad i got to try this guy. as my first smuttynose i look forward to the rest of these bad boys i got inb the cellar (again thank you adam!)"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are complex and interesting with the cherry and hops being a very nice addition. In addition, the balance is just spot on and the flavors are really nice from start to end."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2010 vintage. Pours very dark brown color with a 1 finger dark tan head with great retention. A thin lacing cap lasts for the remainder of the glass with decent lacing sticking to the glass. Aromas of strong citrus hops with chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, and a small bit of alcohol. Big aromas with plenty of hops here. Taste of huge amounts of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, and roasted malt; with a bit of coffee and citrus as well. Decent bitterness on the finish that lingers with the strong roasted, chocolate, and caramel flavors. Very creamy and smooth with no alcohol noticed in the taste at all. Decent alcohol warming on the finish. Medium-low carbonation and full bodied. Overall, an excellent imperial stout."
"I'll give it another try next year, hopefully it returns to its greatness."
"O - Very tasty, creamyness is amazing, roasted chocolate and faint fruity flavors shine and there is no way in hell you'd guess this was nearly 10%. Awesome"
"That it masks the beefy 9/8% ABV is a feather in its cap. Smuttynose has, to its credit, crafted a solid, flavorful Imperial Stout. This is unquestionably good beer and well worth enjoying. My point is simply that it is good and solid, but not over-the-top, great RIS. A fine representative of the style, however, and one I'd recommend despite some criticisms."
"O: It reminds me of a non-wood aged Berserker. That's a good thing. 4.5/5"
"Mouthfeel is thick and velvety smooth making for quite an enjoyable sipping beer. Overall a solid imperial stout and a decent value compared to some but it doesn't quite stand out in a market already crowded with stouts and high abv beers."
"D good, definitely a sipping beer.  4 "
"O- overall, this is a beer that i would like to try again with some age on it. i feel that a little more time laying down would cause it to smooth out some of the edges and make it a lot more enjoyable."
"O: Very nice RIS though perhaps a little too much coffee flavor for my tastes. I would definitely drink it again but I've had better RISs."
"Really nice stuff. Imp Stout is probably my favorite style so I'm always excited to try new ones, but at the same time I know I'll probably be a harsher critic on the ones I don't like (Whether or not that's a good thing). Regardless, this really fits my tastes. I'd be curious about cellaring potential. Really, really nice stout."
"O- I am very impressed with this RIS from Smuttynose. Extremely easy to drink for the ABV. LIke a chocolate malt shake, but way better. For the price (~$7), possibly the best IRS in this range. I would not have expected for the recent 2011 to drink so smooth and mild. Worth every penny."
"O- good brew but not too sure of the taste theres some nutty almost funky tasting this goin on. Either way its different."
"O - Had as a part of our blind 8 impy stout tasting. Faired better than I had expected in the group. I have to say I really liked this one - very roasty and bitter with coffee and bitter dark chocolate showing strongly."
"O - I think another big beer series hit from smuttynose. Never disappointed. Definitely gonna purchase more and let some age a bit. For the price, it's a phenomenal deal and a must buy!!"
"A very tasty, exceptionally affordable RIS. It definitely seems a touch hoppy and hot right now; I've yet to have a RIS that didn't get better with time. For the price (mine was $5.50 at Trader Joe's) you'd be hard pressed to find a better example of the style."
"Overall: I was hoping it would be better than it was, however I think this beer has some enormous aging potential. I was surprised at how boozy it was especilly with no real booze scents coming from the nose. I might pick up another bomber or two just to test the ageability in the coming years. $5.99 a bomber is the right price to experiment with."
"O - I like the style and I like the beer. I ended up drinking the whole growler after writing notes. I would totally buy this again. I will look for it bottled. Give it a go. Great stout."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one. A very enjoyable RIS."
"This is a pretty good brew-- definitely worth a try."
"The taste is wonderful. The taste starts with a roasted creaminess on the mouth. The carbonation builds and dissipates to reveal a dry bitter roasted flavor. this flavor subsides and taste of raisins and a slight spicy hop finish. Nice."
"O: This is an excellent beer - one to really savor."
"O: A good classic RIS with a fairly strong hop presence fresh. I could see this becoming something great with a year or more on it. I'd say the finish is a touch too dry and bitter. For value, there are few that can compete at $5.99 a bomber."
"Here it is, the RIS that turned me into a huge fan. This is a excellent stout. Best buy in the world. Back to business. Poured in my sixteen ounce snifter. 2011 I have been waiting for fhis guy to be released. First case of bombers I have ever purchased. Pours a very dense black, with 2 finger mocha head. With a solid amount of lacing, a lovely beer to look at. The smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, & a hint of booze. Taste is of all those, with big hit of hops. Big thick mouth feel, chewy. With all that & drinks exceptional. Great cap beer, but can go down easy & kick your ass along the way. This is a beer that will always be in my cellar. So happy it still floors me, after my first year on the BA."
"D: Very impressed with how this aged. Still has a great roasted flavor but smoothed out a bit. Can't wait to try this years when it hit the shelves"
"22oz bottle. Bottle Conditioned in 2009 notched on the side. Didn't realize this had some age on it when I bought it but I am not complaining. Pours a viscous deep dark brown color with a huge light brown frothy head. Head sticks around for a long while. Tons of lacing. Aroma is slightly boozey along with some dark chocolate, dark fruits and a bit of cappuccino. Flavor is mostly dark fruits and dark chocolate. Warming alcohol taste. On the bitter side. Overall its a pretty good stout but their is a bit more dark fruit flavor than chocolate than I would prefer. Still it's a solid beer and worth buying."
"Good stuff esp for how readily available it is. Would love to have regular access to this tasty stout."
"A solid stout - no areas are exceptional, but very well done in every regard."
"Smuttynose is an outstanding brewery!! This is the first time I have had this and I will definitely seek it out again."
"Roasted aromas aren't shy, but take a bit of a backseat to tart and tangy notes of raisins, molasses, and chocolate-covered oranges on display. It looks thick and oily and it is, but hefty doses of bitterness and strong coffee cut through the body. Hints of leather and perhaps smoke at times. I love a hoppy stout and this one's pretty tasty, although I'd love to see a bit more roast involved. It's the tangy flavors that win out and linger in the end. Not as potent as a fresh bottle."
"Overall just a great beer. Time and time again I am thoroughly impressed with Smuttynose's offerings. Surely I'd consider this more of a unique Imperial Stout. Something about the great balance and sweetness from the dried winter fruits really makes this beer exceptional in my book."
"I had this in the summer of 2008 and I thought it was pretty good. The 2009 bottle was still good, but there was really something bizarre with the hops. This probably should be aged for a few years. That might fix the hop pellet flavor issue."
"Not a bad showing, overall. Nice flavors, good balance. Just hide the alcohol a little better and turn the carbonation down from 11 and we're in business."
"D - It's a sipper, a big beer. Split into two servings as our final beer of brew day. I'm looking forward to drinking this one again. I'm curious as to how this will continue to age."
"Wow, such a fantastic example of the style, all the aroma and flavor one would expect from a world-class Imperial Stout with a body and level of drinkability that few can match. Smuttynose delivers once again and further cements themselves as one of my favorite American breweries. Can't wait for this years batch to come out next month!"
"Body could use a little extra punch, but flavors are good, with roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, some molasses, and more chocolate. Grass and citric fruits show a small but noticeable contribution. Very good now that it has aged."
"Incredible stout. One of the best in New England. Its good fresh too."
"Overall I this beer just isn't what I was expecting and I've had plenty of these imperial stouts from Smutty. Most others seemed to have a fuller flavor and not so much bitterness in the overall profile. Maybe its just in a weird stage of aging. I hope so... I have a few more of these in the basement."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a deep reddish-brown with a minimal light tan head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, chocolate, slight alcohol, caramel, and bitter hop on the followthrough. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew. It just wasn't very awe-inspiring. Just seemed to be something missing on this one. Not sure what though... Nice aroma going on here though. The flavor was nicely balanced until you got to the followthrough where alcohol took over the show. This one is worth trying at least one to make a judgement for yourself, but I doubt I would have it again."
"drinkable - no more than a glass or two."
"I highly recommend this one, fresh or aged."
"d - I found it to be very enjoyable. I've been down on Smutty lately because there beers seem to have too much going on, but I think they found a great balance with this one."
"Poured this into a tulip. Looks just as I would hope. The beer pours dark and oily. Damn near black with a big dark and creamy looking mocha colored head. Great retention on this and it settles down to a nice layer of foam with sticky lace throughout the drink. Like I said, this one just looks perfect to me. The aroma is really an earthy one. Aromas like leather, smoke, dried tobacco are really up front masking faint aromas of dark fruits and sweet bakers chocolate. As I expected this has a smoky roasted flavor. Real leathery and full flavor with just a touch of dried fruits to the flavor. Finishes kind of hot though and somehow a bit metallic. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with this big thick RIS, good carbonation. Not the greatest but certainly a great accessible RIS. Good drinking here, certainly one to share as it is kind of boozy."
"D - This is a very good RIS. It isn't crazily amped up with too many flavors, but what is there works really well and is pretty delicious - it is one of the more chocolatey RISs I have. Given its price point, this is a pretty solid buy. I wish I could buy Smuttynose on a regular basis; if I could, this would be a winter staple for me."
"D - Very drinkable for the abv and style."
"First time trying this beer. Had it next to an Old Rasputin which up until now was my favorite RIS. No more. This beer is great. Very roasty with dark chocolate notes and a hint of tar. However there's a great maltiness backing that up which is very barleywine-like. Lots of complexity. Every sip and degree of temperature increase yields some new flavors and aromas. I really like it as it warmed and some of the CO2 came out. Fantastic."
"thru on the end, other than that this one was very good and worth the search."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with modest carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it was a pretty good beer for the style overall. It seemed on the hoppy side for the style but things came together pretty well overall. Pretty nice beer overall. It's not outstanding in the style, but a very solid beer overall."
"D- This beer was damn good. Smuttynose to me has been making great imperial styles and I say bring them on! The ABV was well hidden overall coming out not in full force all at once but in spurts which was nice. 22oz bottle could be drank no problem at all."
"d - I thought this was a pretty good RIS. While a little bitter and not my favorite, it is still a very good imperial stout. Lots of nice chocolate and dark fruits in the smell and taste. Would certainly have this one again."
"D - Very creamy and filling. Abv is well hidden. I highly recommend it."
"D: Enjoyable beer, just wasn't what I was expecting with a year old RIS. Still far too agressive and bitter with some burnt characteristics that dry the palate."
"a russian imperial on the american side with an interesting zest of mint at first. this is the only distiction from the baltic porter outside of the the fact that the the russian imperial is thicker in malt and doesn't have lasting licorice but a distict coffee earth bitter that is just a single dimension of maltiness. the abv is there and not noticeable but his is not a light drink. big beer. malt, molasses, licorice, coffee, and chocolate. a tad astringent and smokey. the minty hop is the only interesting aspect that makes it unique. otherwise...middle of the road... the baltic porter is excellent... go there first."
"I believe the bar (Busy Bee in Raleigh,NC) aged this one for roughly 6 months before tapping it. Pours a dark black color with a thin tan head that doesn't stick around long. The aroma has some piney hops upfront, along with dark chocolate and lactose, some dark fruits, espresso and alcohol. The flavor is similar with citrusy hops upfront, along with some dark chocolate and lactose, cherry and date, espresso, burnt bread, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side, and drinkability is decent. This is a very tasty and unusually hoppy RIS, another winner from Smuttynose."
"Drinkability- can't get over the burnt flavor, so in my opinion this is not a very drinkable beer, took me over half an hour to drink an 8oz serving"
"D: All right."
"D: An excellent example of the style, great dessert beer. I may finish the bomber tonight. I like that it doesn't have an overwhelming hops presence. Well worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style."
"D: Drink is ok, again should improve."
"I've sat on this bottle of Imperial Stout for a long time. I kept hearing about hot and uncontrolled it was fresh. I'm pleased to report that that's not the case after some time in the bottle. It's an impressive Imperial Stout that doesn't make many missteps. The nose could use a little work and more body would be good. That's about it though. Easy recommendation. Stow away a bottle while you're at it. You can thank me later."
"Downing this bomber will be easy, and heavenly. More than one would go against my better judgement though."
"Drinkability - If I could find this all over this would be my new go to stout considering Smuttynose's fair pricing and large bottles. I will obtain more if I find them around again!"
"Pours black in body with coffee head on top. Smells of chocolate, booze, and hops. Tastes of chocolate, raisins, tang, and booze flows through as well. Thick in mouthfeel and on the stomach. A heavy RIS that lacks great flavor. Not one of the premier stouts but a good try."
"This was a pretty good RIS, there was plenty of complex flavor but I didn't think that it was strong enough. The flavors were a bit faint for the style, still a very good beer though."
"* I want to note that I held onto my bottle for a few months before drinking it. I did not realize that there was such a strong hop presence in it. When I drank mine I could taste the hop fading and was bummed that I missed out on the flavor of a fresh hop Imperial Stout. My advice is if you didn't drink this fresh wait longer that 6 months for the hops to really fade out."
"Thanks for the bottle randomdanger!"
"From the 2010 series and sampled on September 2, 2010. It has an opaque black pour with a long lasting one inch tan head with excellent laacing. It looks like it is supposed to. The arome has a mixture of rich malts, hops, and maybe something akin to black cherry. The taste tends to de-emphasize the malts and bring out the hoppiness. So it is the best of both worlds. A fine Impy Stout."
"D: A bold brew for sure. Something to sit with and sip on. This is a beer you can keep on sipping and tasting new things in. Something to savor and discover, but not an everyday beer. I don't think I could do more than one bottle in a sitting."
"This is some damn good stuff, very drinkable, looks great and the alcohol is very well hidden. Drink up."
"D: Interesting, available and a pretty good price point. I'd pick this up again."
"Drinkability is very good. Solid balance between malts & hops in an Imperial Stout. I reckon this one ages quite well."
"22 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, and pine hops. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some vanilla and burnt/charred malt. There's also a nice lingering bitter finish. This bottle is about 6 months old, and I'm surprised that the hops are as noticable as they are in this brew. It's certainly one of the hoppier stouts I've tried, with good balance between the malty and hoppy flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, I'd have no problems buying this again."
"I find this extremely drinkable, even in the summer if it has a nice chill on it."
"D- Alcohol is well hidden at first but as it warms up it becomes hotter, making this harder to drink but still very good. Worth seeking out and cellaring for 2-3 years and re-reviewing."
"D: Very smooth and easy to drink, although the heat gradually builds and overwhelms the beers. Decent and enjoyable imperial stout."
"D: Very drinkable, I could drink this all night long. Very enjoyable and I'll definitely be adding this to my ""Buy again"" list."
"All in all, this is a decent stout. Not too much special about it, but it's good. Not worth hunting, but try it if you get the chance."
"D - overall it really is a great IRS and I would enjoy it again since it was great but I will have to try more just to see if I enjoy it."
"The flavor also has a strong chocolate component, but the aggressive roasted malt takes the flavor up a notch. The anise I thought I maybe smelled before is now live at five. Somewhat hoppy, with good lingering bitterness. Smooth and easy drinking for this style. Slightly chewy, although a bit too ethereal to really shine. Solid but not outstanding."
"2009 vintage. Pours from the bottle a nice silky, black color, with a big light brown head, that eventually settles into a thin slick upon the surface. Aromas black licorice, dark chocolate, blackberries and port. Smooth and thick, with flavors of roasted malt, earthy hops and bitter coffee. Rich and filling. Good for a glass, but not much more."
"D - Not as easy as it should be, but not horrible for 10%, does get easier as you go."
"D - the oddly high alcohol taste and feel put this out of regular drinking fair."
"This is a very good RIS, a big beer worth trying."
"9.8% is also dangerous when you haven't eaten all day, but this is definitely a meal in a glass. Worth buying and worth holding on to for a while."
"Very smooth and creamy, not chewy, but definitely fluffy and full. Nice drink, it's robust and delicious. A very good beer for $6 a bomber. Definitely will grab another for the cellar."
"Notes: This is not a bad brew but is like a dark IPA, hopped stout concoction. Feels like it shares a lot of common ground with say... Lagunitas Imperial Red for instance? but with a gentle touch of roasted notes, and a black appearance under the current of resin and pine. Judging by style this would be quite a failure but if one sets RIS aside it is somewhat interesting. But something is off, if only in the labeling, maybe the recipe too, or maybe it need one or two years of cellaring so that the hops subside in aggressiveness and meld magically to provide something that could be qualified as a RIS."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a tall flute. A few impressions I jotted down while enjoying this beer with a plate of fried calamari at Ebenezer's Pub. It's very dark brown with a tan foam head. Lot's of carbonation clings to the sides of my glass. Aromas of roasted malt and alcohol I can also detect some semi-sweet chocolate. It's complex and impressive. The taste is of sweet chocolate at first. The bitterness builds to a good finish. Right as I swallow there is a bit of alcohol. There is a sharp burn, kind of like a very mild chili beer. I'd like to try this one with some age on it. There is a lot of coating with each sip. It has a heavy body and medium carbonation. There is burning and a tingling sensation with each swallow. I find it to be somewhat drinkable. I wouldn't order more than one (and would want to split a 22oz bottle with someone). The burning would get old quickly. I'm going to drink my glass slowly (and I did, I think I spent an hour with it)."
"D- Definitely a drinkable. I think it could do with a little more aging to take down the alcohol content a little. I had no trouble finishing the bottle. I would recommend letting this sit for awhile before consuming."
"Another treat from richbrew! Poured from bomber into snifter on 4/1. Black with 2 finger brown head. Roasted malts, chocolate, and light booze in the nose followed by all of the above and coffee notes in the taste. Full bodied and good carbonation for the style. Amazingly drinkable but watch those ABVs add up quick."
"D - While their is a hint of alcohol in this it is blended in real well. This beer is pretty good and I would have it again but I wish their was a little more separation in the flavors. I was looking for a beer that had roasted malts and plenty of hoppiness and this comes close to meeting that expectation. If only it was a little more roasty! Also this is not your typical RIS, there are a lot of hops in this one."
"Served cold in a big tumbler at Eli Canon's in Middletown, CT this one shows a deep dark black brown with a decent light chocolate colored cover and very nice lacing. The aroma is an unusually bright juniper hop and deep nutty liqueur. Intrguing. The flavor is a firm pronouncement of what I took from the aroma with a uniquely sharp juniper hop that has some grape-like suggestions and malty-hazelnut blendings that bring a near B&B sensation. It's a bit crisp with lively, fine carbonation but it's on it's way to approaching full bodied status. Drinkability is decent for a brew that features some alcohol. The juniper idea is fairly intense and works well for me. The malt is there for some balance and I suppose you could claim some vague charcoal in the mix but that gets off the real point. This might qualify as a swell holiday brew, served with a sprig of holly. But, regardless, I like it. It's a quality brew that's fairly different with bold flavor for those that can enjoy the theme."
"Impression: Can't believe it has taken me so long to taste this NE gem. This will be a cellar dweller for sure."
"LIke you'd expect, chocolate malt taste. Bitter. Almost kind of like Cherry coke aftertaste. There are a lot of things going on. Sourness, now. Complex."
"Drinkability is good, but not one of my favorites from Smuttynose."
"D= very drinkable if you're going to have one 22-ounce bottle or you're gorging on some great chocolate dessert. Otherwise I couldn't handle more than one 22oz bottle at a setting but I'd be sure to sit a lot more! A bit dry to be my favorite Imperial Stout for my preferences but definitely one that I would grab as my next choice."
"D- Picked this one up for 6 picks. I think this one is easy to drink and very solid. Right up there in quality and price I like."
"D-Plenty of flavour and not too heavy. For a RIS a relatively easy drinker. A 10% session RIS....well...??"
"Drinkability was nice. This is a great beer, not one I'll ""stock up"" on, but I'll def. enjoy this again in the near future."
"Cheers."
"This one definitely improved as it warmed. Enjoyable, but a little scattered. Maybe it is just too young. With some age the flavors in this beer may find a balance. Might pick up another and hide it away for a year and see how it evolves"
"D: For a 10% beer, highly drinkable if you enjoy the style. Definitely the biggest of Smutty's 'big beer' series, and probably one of my favorites from them so far."
"I've always been a fan of Smuttynose, but this beer ended up being a drain pour for me. The hoppiness is way out of line with the style and doesn't add anything positive imho. There were some subtle toasty notes way in the background, but not enough to provide a balance. Bottom line, I like hoppy beers, but I really hated this beer and wouldn't consider buying it ever again. Horrible example of the style."
"A big full roasty beer. Very rich and flavorful. The flavors, aroma and mouthfeel work very nice together making a fantastic beer."
"Flavor is very decent. Lots of malts and chocolates. Mild bitter and dry aftertaste. Medium body and mouthfeel. Mid to high carbonation for a stout. As this beer warms up, a lot more flavors come to the front. Booze is well hidden from the flavor, but you can feel a little burn on your tongue and lips. Good RIS."
"This is one smooth beer for a fresh bottling of an RIS! Very drinkable and I think I will pick up a bottle to age. Smuttynose has not let me down yet with any of their beers. Recomended!"
"D: Extremely boozy. I won't lie, this bottle was very hard to get through. Good not awesome."
"A little sweet and surprisingly hop-forward, this would likely do well with a little more age on it. All in all, the ""biggest"" of the Big Beer series I've sampled thus far."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slick, oily body."
"D - drinks great! I would guess the ABV is down this year compared to '08 & '09, booze is very well hidden...silky smooth...it's love yo."
"D: Excellent, watch out for the ABV though."
"Another well-done beer from Smuttynose! Bought a bomber for $7 from one of my favorite beer stores. Pours thick and black as night. Aroma is of dark chocolate and hints of roasted coffee. Taste is excellent - rich, bitter chocolate, and espresso. There's an interesting slight saltiness at the back sides of the tongue at swallow. Pair it with a smoked gouda. Good stuff!"
"Thanks to psprings for the bottle. Ink black body, mocha head. Aromas include prunes, dark chocolate, and molasses. A wealth of flavor on the palate with chocolate covered figs, brown sugar, molasses, and a bitter finish. Bitter chocolate really sticks on the tongue providing a lasting finish. Full, creamy, velvety finish. Damn good, HUGE stout. Quite rich, split this bottle!"
"22oz from 2009. pours very dark with a decent head. HOPPY stout. flowers. creamy and tasty. I think I smell spanish olives now. big flavor in this beer. i believe i could age this for a while more and enjoy some great flavors but there is plenty going on now to satisfy. overall a great combo of hops and malts and florals. the abv isnt listed on the bottle but boy this has got me buzzed. good stuff with some great flavors."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle. The label reads ""Bottle conditioned in 2006"". Uncapped and poured into my Shaker glass. The stout appears an opaque brown color with a good inch of dark tan colored foam. The head settles to a thin layer within a few minutes. Nose and flavors consist of rich deep roasted grains, a barely noticeable wisp of smoke/char, figs, bittersweet chocolate, espresso beans, prunes, raisins, black cherries, caramel, milk chocolate, mocha, vanilla, molasses, a bit of pine and herbal notes. No alcohol heat to speak of at around 4 years in the bottle. The body could be a bit fuller and the carbonation was slightly lacking, but these are minor, minor strikes. The complex flavors more than make up for any shortcomings. This vintage is drinking really nice right now."
"A solid RIS. Nice sticky head with very good lacing as my glass is coated continuously as I drink. Impressive for the style and abv. Smell is quite sweet with yeasty dark fruitiness, caramel, burnt sugar and light alcohol. A bed of roasted malts thicken up and cut the sweetness with a rich graininess nicely. Some smoke as well. Taste is full of roasted grains with a coffee like bitterness that flows into that sweetness deliciously. Molasses. Alcohol is very well integrated and never detracts, rather it enhances the sweetness and the bittering in the finish. Nice trick. Smoke and charcoal support the mild hops. The feel is full and syrupy. Just a little more carbonation and it would really be motivating me. As it is there is just enough to break it up but what is now slick could be silk with a little more effervescence. Still this goes down like cocoa on a cold night as the abv is tucked covertly into what is a fine though not exemplary brew. A nice, easy drinker that is just a touch light in personality."
"D: One pint is plenty"
"D-For the style, this is a drinkable stout. But as with just about any RIS, one is usually enough."
"2008 vintage. Pours dark brown to black with a beige head. Aroma has quite a bit of alcohol as well as some roasted malt. Flavor is roasted malt with some smoke and a little soy sauce character. Very creamy, medium mouthfeel."
"a very solid stout, the first time i had this i loved it although it was on tap. the hops seem to have calmed down a bit but are still very noticeable. i love hoppy stouts."
"This impy can hang with the best of'em despite being way too easy to obtain and only $7 a 22oz."
"M/D: Sticky, thick, and full. This finish is very smooth. Once this beer hits temperature around 48 degrees, the carbonation is almost imperceptible. Alcohol character is nowhere to be found. The hop presence from start to finish adds a great amount of balance and depth to this beer."
"D: the drinkability is pretty good, lots of bold flavors that are balance well and a nicely hidden high abv"
"Btw, I'm enjoying this with a tasty chicken pot pie. I don't know if that is supposed to be a good match or not but it's going well...;^)"
"I will give another bottle a try as maybe I just got the rare case of a bad bottle."
"D - I think this one is a year old but you wouldn't notice by the aroma. The taste is a hint stale but the hops works well with the big chocolate stout. Very nice. As it warms it starts to become barleywine like which makes me thick it is old. Damn Discount and your old selection."
"I've had a few other beers from Smuttynose that I've enjoyed, so I was looking forward to this one. It is a tasty RIS, but not what I expected. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but as I said in the Taste section of my review I expect malts, malts, and more malts in my RIS. Nice change of pace from typical RIS's, but I'd personally go for a beer listed in my first paragraph."
"D: Unfortunately, no. This is just one of those cases where a beer is probably well within the broad range of the guidelines, but I'm too limited to appreciate it. I just don't enjoy the beer, and I don't want to have it again."
"This is a drinkable beer, but I recommend going slow with it. The ABV & meal-like thickness require you to take it easy here."
"D: This is a value beer @ $6.99 a bomber. I like the Dark fruits/hop profile of the beer, but am conflicted with the alcohol presence in this beer, not to my liking with this style. Consequently I'd still probable drink it again if I was feeling like getting all warm bellied this winter."
"Very solid two finger head of dense foam and widely arrayed larger bubbles, very slow to dissipate, slight dimpling as it does, deep brown in hue, the lacing comes in wide sheets which inch down the glass sides. Pitch black, no sign of color anywhere in the liquid. The nose achieves a good balance between roasted and sweeter elements, bitter dark chocolate, maple syrup, American roast coffee pair up with plum, black grape, black cherry fruit as well as pine, licorice, white grapefruit, not very bready, about as hoppy as any Russian Imperial Stout you'll encounter. Medium-bodied, svelte like a middleweight boxer, there's power to the punches but no lumbering around. This likely attributable to the hoppiness, more grapefruit, pine, flowers and licorice than is usually the case. Cocoa, chocolate, freshly whipped butter, grilled nuts appear, then clove and barley, at times might pass for a super-dark barleywine. Grape, cherry, apricot fruit, a mix of dark and white fruit. The carbonation is not a big factor but consistent in what it does. I can't say this is a ""textbook"" example of the style but in its own way it is compelling and a helluva drink."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a good size semi-lasting creamy light-brown head. Fantastic aroma is big time resiny hops with dark malt, chocolate and hints of fruit -- man that smells good! The malty roastness comes out more in the flavour along with tons of hops, some fruit, coffee and some alcohol (the alcohol's present but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the beer at all). Nice full body and creamy mouthfeel. An awesome Stout, what I like most about the wonderful brew is the hop profile."
"Picked up another bottle of this a year later and it was pretty good, but not quite like I remembered. It blew me away last year, but I find this bottle to be a good stout, just not amazing. Still quite roasty and very drinkable though."
"The hops make it a little less drinkable than some."
"D-the creaminess actually makes it very interesting as it actually gives off more of a hop taste. Fun to drink; but it doesn't seem to follow the traditional RIS format."
"Very good beer. With my first sample of the Smuttynose product I am rather impressed. Enjoyable to drink, easy to sip on all night."
"Just tapped this in my kegorator and poured it into a Duvel glass a nice opaque black with a light tan head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of cocoa, dried fruits slight hops. The taste is nice complex bend of cocoa and hops with some dried fruits and espresso. The beer is slightly heavy with warming alcohol. This is a very tasty brew, one I'm glad to have a whole keg of."
"I respect the love that went into this, but I just can't recommend it."
"Rich, oily aroma has an overtone of molasses and an undertone of fine roast coffee with a hint of unsweetened chocolate. It pours a dark, nearly opaque sable with a very thick, fine-bubbled, persistent tan head. Flavor is a little smoky, strongly of molasses with nutty, coffee, chocolate and toffee hints. Texture is thick, smooth and fizzy with a good alcohol bite. Definitely lip-smacking."
"Overall this is the second time that I have had this beer in the past week (the first being a bomber split between friends)and I assumed that I got a bad bottle. I was excited to have it on-tap, but it turns out that both experiences mirrored each other seamlessly. Being a huge of fan of RISs, and Smuttynose for that matter, I am extremely disappointed by this beer. I will perhaps give it a try in several weeks or perhaps wait until next season, but I would certainly not seek this beer out again. Not recommended."
"Drinkability was poor with the hops taking over the beer from aroma to finish."
"Cheers!"
"D: Big beer that just doesn't really do it for me."
"The beer texture is silky and creamy as it crosses your tongue, with a slight bitterness at the end. I enjoyed drinking this one and the flavours became more pronounced as it warmed up."
"Strong notes of brown sugar and cherry on the back end. Alcohol is full and spicy all the way through. A real treasure of a beer. Drink slowly and enjoy."
"Poured a jet black with good carbonation, thick pour and brown head. Nose is big and roasted with bitter chocolate. Taste has a funky light but noticable sour tinge to it. Dark fruits, bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel is hefty, thick and sordove acidic. Drinkability is above average overall."
"D- High. I will be buying more of these, hands down one of the best NE Imp. stouts on the market. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I suggest you seek it out."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I am glad I a splitting this because it is pretty big. I'd have it again easily."
"D- Very drinkable, almost too drinkable considering the ABV."
"Drink: Tasty, great flavors, goes down well. I would say I could drink it all night, but with the alcohol content, I'm not sure it'd be wise to have more than two. Fantastic beer with both sweet and dark flavors."
"Would recommend."
"Drinkability: All in all, this wasn't quite what I was hoping it to be. Still, it was a pretty good RIS. Would I buy it again? For the price, yes. This was a fun drink. Very smooth too."
"Roasted malt flavor with hints of chocolate, peppery spice, oatmeal, coffee bean, toffee, caramel, dark fruit, fig, alcohol, bourbon candi sugar and a very surprising, yet excellent bitter hop note."
"It was an easy big beer to drink. The word dangerously so must be used again. I polished the bomber off with ease but that was it for the evening."
"Overall, a solid beer, no doubt. I almost want to have a fresh bottle to see the hop level in that, because I can only assume time has made this a shadow of it's former self. I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing, but this is unique beer in my mind, hoppier than any stout I've ever had before, hands down."
"The taste is rather bitter in a good way, this is a rather well hopped RIS. Lots of roasted malts and coco compliment the hoppyness. The mouthfeel and drinkability are so good for a 10% stout, I really enjoyed this one from my favorite New England brewery."
"D: Amazing start."
"EDIT: 9/13/09 8:00 EDT. I finished the rest of the growler the following day and found it more ""stout-like"". There was less carbonation as is normal a day after cracking open a growler. The lesser carbonation seems to have also taken the hop flavor down a few notches. The chocolate, licorice and roasted barley flavors were more prevalent along with a stronger alcohol taste. I have upped my ratings on smell taste and drinkability based on the second session.l"
"D - This one has a lot of drinkabilty but the strength of the ABV will slow you down."
"I sampled this beer several months ago, and it was very, very hoppy and hot. I wasn't really into it to be honest. It has mellowed out over the past few months, and I think its a better beer now, just not amazing. Maybe it will be ""outstanding"" or ""world-class"" in 2010."
"This is a Very good Imperial stout, I would like to get more of this."
"D - For the style, very!"
"Bottle conditioned in 2009. Pours opaque pitch black with dense tan head, half inch retained, lacing only lasts for the first few sips. Smell: big roasted component, chocolate raisin, sweet but with a serious floral and citric hop presence, fleeting alcohol. Taste: lots of floral hop and citrus rind, roasted with some burnt character, caramel sweetness, a really nice dark chocolate note. Mouthfeel: a little thinner than it could be plus the serious hop presence makes the delicious malt flavors fleeting. The malt flavors aren't super complex, but are quite tasty. This one has around six months on it but it's still aggressively hoppy and a bit hot, but quite drinkable."
"I really find this wonderfully drinkable and a treat. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"EDIT 8/31/09: i've decided to bump up half points for both aroma and taste, and view this more as an american imperial stout. even then however, this is quite aggressively hopped."
"It has really warmed me up this summer afternoon, but if you can get past that, it's pretty drinkable for an Impy Stout."
"A bit hot, but medium body is well carbonated. Good stout."
"Thanks to Shawn for sharing this beautiful bomber."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is rich, creamy, astringent, mouth coating, and slightly carbonated. The body of the beer is thick and full. The finish on the beer is full. This beer is a very well rounded and palate pleasing. The different hops in this beer gives the beer a unique flavor. I really like this beer. It is well made and very tasty."
"The hoppiness of this beer, although untraditional, is a welcome addition."
"As in the nose the hops continue to stand out featuring a piney citrus profile I would expect from a wewt coast brewer than Smutty. Again the chocolate plays a secondary role. Not my preferred take on the big stouts, but I can respect the achievement. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium and thickens as the liquid continues to warm. I'd love to try this with a good bit of age to subdue the hops and hopefully develop greater compleity"
"Notable high-alcohol feel to this in the initial sip. This is quickly overwhelmed by a bitterness from burnt malt and a strong hop finish. Thin body for the style and the carbonation is slightly high."
"Pours a deep black with a 3 finger tan head that retains well throughout drinking this stout. Leaves good lacing coating the entire glass. Smells mostly of roasted malts/coffee with some pepper hints. Tastes like a typical imperial stout of roasted malts/coffee and some bitterness, maybe a bit of spicy pepper too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and does not seem to coat like a thicker imperial does. Good solid imperial stout taste with a smaller price tag than most of the other, would drink again. No real noticeable alcohol for being 10%."
"This might be a good cross over into imperial stouts for hop heads."
"Poured pitch black into a glass. I held it up to the light and I didn't see any shine through. The beer had a thick head with a light smell of roasted malt. I tasted more roasted malt than anything. I picked up some bitterness. I was surprised at how light the beer felt on my tongue, I expected something with a little more substance. No noticeable alcohol flavor."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a true, opaque black color. The three-finger, wood-brown head was billowing at first. The retention was very good; it soon became a fluffy cap that also left very good, consistent lacing. The aroma was quite spicy, peppery and semi-sweet. I detected notes of wood, hemp-like hops, herbal hops, roasted malt and caramel malt. The flavors started semi-sweet with caramel malt, light chocolate malt before going into lots of spice, white pepper and light coffee. The flavors were so spicy it almost had hints of capsicum in it. The mouthfeel was creamy and a little oily, the body full and the carbonation a touch high which added to the spiciness."
"D..Oh, this strong imperial stout is the easiest I've had so far. Yes, it's strong in abv and flavor, but I think I could have 2 or 3 bombers before I was passed out on the floor. Excellent version of a RIS."
"Toasted malts seque to the tongue and join the hops as they emerge. Spice and chocolate on the finish. Hoppy and sweet with a full body that lightens a bit as the carbonation diminishes. A bit dry on the finish yet expected given the hop structure. Decent feel and drink, but a bit unilateral in that regard, dry and hoppy, quite robust indeed."
"D-Prety decent. Relatively easy to drink, probably due to some of its lighter-feeling flavors in the profile, while remaining sufficiently complex and heavy to maintain it's RIS designation."
"D: very high for a 10% offering"
"I am excited to see how this cellars, as I have one laying down for the next couple of years."
"Picked this up during the last trip to Wisconsin. Pleasantly surprised by the citrus hops in this, it made for a unique tasting stout, almost like a stout-IPA mix."
"D: I think one bottle is enough for one sitting, but I wouldn't be opposed to having it again on a different night. Be a hard press to buy again though."
"An interesting take on the style, I'd definatly buy one of these."
"2006 vintage bomber. Courtesy of Hogtown Harry (I think?). Anyhoo- time to drink this puppy. Pours ebony black- no sunshine through this one. Minimal beige head, intermittent lacing. Nose- strong anise, some powdered chocolate and dark roast. Taste- hoppier then expected given the age- licorice again, dark chocolate and dark fruits. Oxidation is starting to show, but still a mighty fine beverage. Finish still packs a hop wallop and is very dry. Drinkability is almost too good with some age on it. Nice stuff- would like to try fresh."
"D: What a bizarre beer. I get the feeling that this would be pretty good after some time in the cellar to allow the hops to die down, but I'm opposed in principle to beers that have to be aged before they're any good. I won't be visiting this again unless someone presents me with a bottle with at least a year or two on it."
"D) Delicious. Love the combo of hops and stout - not the typical. Pour me another!"
"Drinkability: A very interesting RIS. A little hot still, even after nearly a year of cellaring (80% of that in the closet, 20% in a 55 degree fridge), which gives it - when combined with the earthy and smoky presences - almost a bourbon-esque feel in places. The lack of coffee and chocolate malts is refreshing (as that seems to be where a lot of RIS producers go these days) and allow a few other interesting fruity, nutty, earthy notes to shine through. If this one were a little less hot, it'd be really something."
"I have tried a bunch of the Smutty big beers and this one just didn't make the cut, especially compared to some of the other I have sampled."
"D--No, this is not drinkable at all really. Far too much tobacco sweetness, it is really off putting."
"It's actually a little too much, but not a bad beer. Thanks for the trade!"
"This is, by far, the hoppiest stout I've ever come upon.. it smells like hops dipped in chocolate (if there ever was such a thing).. pours super dark with a slight light-tan head.. doesn't look too viscous though, a more fluid pour. Taste is very complex. Very bitter, but its a hoppy bitterness more than a dark chocolate bitterness (which is also present) like most bitter imperial stouts. And its a very floral hop, very tree-like. Its sort of weird tasting, really. Its very layered and sort of strange, but good. Quite viscous mouthfeel with fairly smooth carbonation. Drinkability is questionable.. its definitely interesting and good, but I could see the taste getting overbearing. Its like what you'd get if you made a half & half with an extremely sweet DIPA with a very thick, roasty RIS. Good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again."
"Overall: A try it beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a little hot and the hops are a little sharp to call this highly drinkable, yet the taste and feel are both very enjoyable. Moderate at best for me."
"Drinkability: Moderate -- not too bad, but the especially high ABV would drive it down a bit. Definitely great for one glass though."
"So damn creamy and full, I loved it in my mouth. I could drink enough to put me over the ledge... here i go..."
"Overall - 4.05"
"M/D: Thick, full bodied, a bit sticky. Carbonation is at a nice level. Drinability is decent, but this is a huge beer in every way (ABV, hops, body). The bottle does not not lie, this is a big beer. And a good one too. I'm actually quite surprised at how well I like this one."
"2009 version. Huge head, 3 inch head poured straight into my tulip, left lacing the whole way down. A really beautiful looking beer, fantastic head and lacing. Smelled of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate and hops (that fresh cut grass smell). Very thick, coats the tongue, and lingers with the hops being very pronounced in the lingering taste. Very bitter, Roasty and subtle chocolate flavors. Not a sweet RIS but alcohol was pronounced, very much a sipper in its infant stage, I think this would fair very well with a little bit of time to sit. Still very glad I tried and will leave the other for next year."
"Medium bodied, and drinkable. Not my favorite out of this series, but a decent beer."
"D- Definately a sipper. very heavy, a little hot, but overall a tasty and interesting brew."
"D: Probably one of the finest Stouts I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Very complex and tons of flavors all begging for attention!"
"D- No problem putting back a 22 oz bomber...but that would probably be my limit, good to drink on a cold day..warms you up very quickly"
"M - Smooth, velvety."
"This was pretty awesome. I have been saving this for a while and am glad I waited. Not sure what this would do raw but it is prefect after about 1 year. Yumm!"
"Pours a nice black color with a great smell. The head formed with ease and left great lace on the glass. The aroma was good not overly powerfull but refreshing of chocolate and malts. The brew it self tasted of chocolate with roasted malts and coffe. The flavor was not overly powerful but mild and tasty. Carbonation was at a great level for this brew as it brought out the flavors, which with out it I think would kill the beer. The mild flavor and good carbonation makes this beer easy to drink after another. Would recomend to anyone to try."
"Another standout brew."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but it's a little hot now. Loads of potential though, and tasty overall, just not as approachable for amateurs at this point."
"As with so many of the big beer series, if this were available like it was when I was 50 miles from the brewery I'd drink a lot more of it!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: A sipper. One's fine for me, thanks."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. Doesn't always fall in line with other RIS, but is still easy to like."
"D - Amazing beer, great example of the style. Actually, this is the beer which I hold the standard by."
"I have to say this year is under-performing a bit; the body seems thinner and taste and smell are slightly less hoppy and intense. 2007 and 2008 and were unbelievable. With that said this is still one of my favorite beers. Its a hybrid of an Imperial Stout and a DIPA, my two favorite styles. The best bargain in beer IMO."
"PS - Don't age this brew. Drink it fresh to take full advantage of the hops the brewer put into it. An aged version of this brew would surely be less-interesting when compared to how it tastes when it's fresh."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer from Smuttynose's Big Beer series. Definitely a strong beer, but a bit hoppy for a RIS. Strong alcohol and malts yes, but the overwhelming hops and dark fruit flavors make it seem more like a dark DIPA. One to try if you like those two styles, but I'll probably stick to more traditional stouts."
"Pours out a deep, dark black color, with some dark brown highlights. The head rises up to an enormous size, and can't help but stick around at the current size. The bubbles slowly pop, leaving little bits of lacing before I drink, and the head clings to the sides as I sip from this one. I can tell this will take me long enough to drink for the head to collapse anyway, but there was always a ring of bubbles the whole time. The smell is, well, interesting. This is the most distinctly hoppy RIS I've ever smelled. I don't know if that's bad or good, but its interesting, like I said. There is also this roasted, almost bitter coffee smell, with a hint of chocolate. Really nice indeed, now that I think about it. The taste is good, as far as I can tell, but the hops are a little too intense at this point. Maybe it's intended to taste this incredibly hoppy, which again is an interesting take. The chocolate and roasted barley - coffee taste is very strong. There is even some sweetness, probably a lot, to balance out the hops and bitterness. I'm not sure if I want to start taking points off or adding them from the hops, so I might have to get another one, let it sit for a while, and come back to see what we've got underneath. Then again, this is probably be consumed the way it was intended, and I can say that I'm enjoying it. On with the review: the beer is very, very full. Part of it comes from the hops, but they don't cling with the resins. I can also tell there's quite a bit of body anyway. And for some reason, I can drink this one very quickly. I don't even notice the alcohol, not until it starts to catch me. Worth a try I'd say, just don't expect it to seem common."
"Nice. Impressive. Excellent Imperial Stout. My first toughts upon tasting this issue from Smuttynose. Recommended by the bartender at Bukowski's in Boston, I was hesitant at first due to the 10% ABV. But NO burn! How Smutty did that is a credit to them. Very smooth for an imperial too. None of that dry rye bread taste. Highly recommend when you're looking for an Imperial."
"D: For a 10% brew, this drinks pretty damned easy. This beer is decently fresh and it is going down with ease. Its not a problem at all. Sits with a bit of heat and a bit of weight, but it doesn't impose on you at all. Everything about this beer is good or better. The flavors are really pleasant. Nothing is too in your face but its complex enough to let you explore and enjoy the brew. Smuttynose is just impressing me more and more as I try their brews and I am oh so glad they are nearby now."
"D- Overall, this is a great RIS that I really enjoyed. Definitely worth a shot for those people who enjoy hoppy Imperial Stouts."
"Do you know how hard it is to try and drink a beer without smelling it? I try pretty hard to not drain-pour beers... so far I've only sacrificed one 6-year-old Stone Levitation.. But this brew is skating the edge."
"I found this to be an odd drinking RIS. The grassy/minty hops really dominated and I wasn't ready for them. Because they were so in my face, I had a hard time looking past them and really unraveling this beer. I enjoyed it immensely for just the same reasons."
"D - Reasonably drinkable for a big stout. The intense hop character is an interesting twist on the style, but the darkness of the malt profile leaves no doubt that it is a stout rather than a barleywine."
"Drinkability is good. I love RISes as a rule, and this one is no exception, even if the carbonation could be taken down a notch."
"Overall, an interesting interpretation of the Russian Imperial Stout style. The hops offer some nice flavor and counter the RIS style in a distinct way. Not sure if I would go out of my way to try it again, but could be a good beer to try aging."
"Full bodied with some suppleness to it and good carbonation. The alcohol is quite well masked for being 10% ABV. A good drinking big imperial stout that's got a unique taste and the ability to age very well. A big thanks to Josh (mullenite) for making this brew possible, Cheers!"
"Drinkability suffers a little from the high abv (not that I'm complaining--but this is a tough category for a big beer), as well as the sometimes overwhelmingly complex flavors, but is still quite good. Would go well with a fine cut of juicy steak, or with a sweet chocolate desert."
"Drinkability: this is just not what I want in a RIS. Not being a black licorice fan this was a pain to finish--especially since I had a Stone RIS waiting in the fridge."
"Poured into a La Fin Du Monde tulip, dark brown, almost black, a HUGE four finger dark tan head sits on top that fell in the slowest manner, excellent retention, foamy, leaving sheets of lacing. Nice roasty aroma, solid herbal hop aroma in the background, earthy, a bit of chocolate, and slightly fumy alcohol. Flavor is a very nice balance between the rich, roasty malts and herbal, oily hops. Nice chocolate flavors mixed with coffee, some of the earthiness that was found in the nose, a bit of licorice, and a hint of alcohol warming on the back end. Nice mouthfeel, not as full and richly textured as many RIS's I've come across, but silky and smooth nonetheless. This is a very good RIS. Not the best I've ever had, but solid, sippable, and worthy of an A. I really need to get a few more bottles of this to age, as this would be a knock after the hops and alcohol mellow a bit and the chocolate malt comes more to the front."
"Sampled fresh, just after the '09 release. Essentially black, thin tan head which fades. Very black actually. Surprisingly, the dominant force in the aroma is hops. I love hops, but this is a bit unusual within the style. Not getting much roasty malt but just ripe hops and a bit of hot fumes. I was intrigued at first and was hoping it would work but it all falls apart. It's all bitterness and a little too boozy and not enough malt and roastitude. I'm sure it's there, it's just covered up. Too many things going on here and they don't meld together. Not so smooth. Unfortunate, because I love Smutty and I remember liking this in the past but this year just isn't cutting it. If you have a bottle or two I'd recommend letting it sit a while and hopefully it will mellow out a bit."
"Smuttynose Imperial Stout is fullish in body with a sizzling snap of active carbonation that helps lighten and crispen the inky-black drink. Even at the ""reduced"" 8.9% ABV, I defy the mightiest of drinkers to pound a few bombers... but as good as this beer is, I might be tempted to try it myself..."
"Lots going on here, good RIS all in all. The anise character was out of control, not something i like in my stouts. It does diminish as the beer warms. I would love to lay one of these down to age. Not bad for the price."
"EDIT: as it warmed, the taste improved even more. Changed taste score upwards & moved from an A- to an A. That's fair. Great, great beer."
"Big, sticky, creamy mouthfeel. Very thick. Texture is one of the things I love about Imperial Stouts. This is a pretty interesting beer. It's more hoppy than roasty in a Storm King kind of way for me. Pretty good stuff. Hopefully I'll be able to secure a bottle of my own."
"D- Excellent! For a 10% ABV Impy stout this brew drinks very easy. Plenty of alcohol but it doesn't burn on the way down. Flavor profile is very well balanced, not too syrupy sweet and not obnoxiously hopped. Another winner from Smutty."
"The aroma is special. It's very hoppy (pine) even for an Imperial Stout. Also it is very sweet and toasted. The appearance is nice with a large foamy head and a very dark brown color. The flavor is like the aroma but also astringent. The palate is smooth. Overall a nice experience and one I would drink again."
"Defied my every expectation. Huge beer, insanely hoppy, and yet I couldn't stop drinking and drinking. Top notch."
"D - this isn't a bad beer by any means, and I think I'm getting more of the roasty action as it warms up. Still, I think this is the first Smuttynose I haven't been like ""FUCK YEAH"" with (it only came to GA a couple of months ago). I've had some hoppy RISs, but this thing is intense. As a hop lover that's ok, but I wasn't expecting it with this beer. Same thing with the dryness. Regardless, I shall finish the bomber, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to snag this over another Smuttynose. This does nothing to diminish my thoughts of how awesome those dudes are, and I'll probably try the next release and see if anything changes"
"Pretty easy to drink though not the most flavorful RIS I have had. Needs more complex flavor. Worth trying though."
"This was ultimately a drain pour for me. What a drag. Easily one of the worst RIS' that I've had, and probably one of the worst I've ever had from Smutty -- a shocker. So hop dominant that I had trouble getting to other flavors. Could have easily been an IPA mixed with a cup of expresso (complete with the lemon twist). This is one and done."
"You can taste the hops off this one before it's all the way in the mouth, probably in no small part due to the hopping. This mixes right away with a dull chocolatey taste. Towards the end, it gets real sweet, almost a vanilla like sweetness without the vanilla taste. There's a pretty strong alcohol bite as it warms, also. The aftertaste is a battle between cocoa flavor and the hops. This one seems to be light on the overall roastiness, focusing on the other aspects. Mouthfeel is kind of light for the style, not real full, there isn't a whole lot behind it. The interplay going right from hop blast to sweet hop doesn't really work for me at all. Not wholly unpleasant, but not what I look for in a stout. Drinkability suffers for the same reason. As a 12oz, this would be an OK try, but as it stands a lot of this will unfortunately be drain poured. Far too hoppy a RIS for my likes. I could deal with either the big hoppyness or the sweetness and burn if it was plenty roasty to compensate, but not both without the roastiness."
"The drinkability is good, but if anything the somewhat intensely diverse flavor offerings can almost be too much. This is a great brew, but I'm sticking to one at a time (of course, they're big ones). Allowing this beer to warm and continue to sample it over an hour plus really releases its character."
"I think this may age very nicely and mellow the hops out a bit. With the abv just slightly lower than normal, assuming my bottle was correct, this will also have a nice amount of drinkability to it."
"D: This is a solid beer, filling. Feeling the alcohol a little bit, but that's to be expected at 10% ABV. Consistent with expectations for this style."
"Notes: More bitter and a little lighter in body that I remembered this beer being. That being said, I really like it! Some Imperial Stouts can get to be really sweet up front, but this guy, this one here is a stout for the IPA drinker. Hops!"
"D - Very smooth, great mouthfeel and taste. Hard to keep on the coaster."
"A whole bomber of Smuttynose Imperial Stout is just about as indulgent as you can get. From first sniff to last sip this is nothing but decadent. This might be all it takes to convert those guilty cravings for chocolate into a lustful longing for stout. I think very highly of Smuttynose on the whole but this offering in particular is one I stock up on every time I get the chance."
"Smutty, you never fail me!"
"Pitch black with a heavy head of brown foam you could walk on. Toasty, burnt sugars in the nose with a substantial dose of piney hops, cocoa, coffee, wine-like fruitiness, herbs and honey. Big, full body. Very chewy and creamy with a bit of an astringent touch. Sweet, sticky sugars balance well dark, coffee malt for a while, but are obliterated by DIPA-like hoppiness.Palate cleans up nicely with a big bitterness. Warming and very satisfying brew and surprisingly easy drinking. Personally, I like this a lot, but it's difficult to categorize. It looks like an imp. stout, feels like an imp. stout, but IMO tastes more like a DIPA. It may not be for everyone but definitely worth a try."
"Thanks to Jwale73 for this one."
"Drinkability: Good fresh, though I'd personally prefer to see it with a bit of age on it to temper those biting hops. Paired well with the CD ""Some Are Lakes"" by Land of Talk."
"Mouthfeel is super creamy - carbonation is light but spot on. Full bodied. Pretty drinkable despite the ABV. It warms but it's not 'hot' at all. It's definitely a sipper... there are so many characteristics and flavors to just sit and marvel about. Great brew and a must try for RIS lovers."
"Another great beer in the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. A straight-forward but extremely tasty stout that delivers without being too over the top."
"Taste is quite bitter, but is dominated by coffee, chocolate and cacao tastes. Backed up by the bitterness of course. The alcohol is very present. A warming feeling and a rather sharp alcoholic kick on the tongue. I can't help to notice the strong oats character. The citric hops also add a nice complexity, although they are a bit overruled by the alcohol and roast."
"The body is big with a great creamy texture. Some astringency up front but hidden in the finish. Carbonation is light but allows the malty body to come out. Overall a great example of a Imperial Stout. I think age has done great things with this."
"Lays down very well. But, boy, is it tough to wait."
"D - This is a great tasting imperial stout. Another outstanding offering from Smutty."
"D: Very good drinkability, clean flavored, and a great example per style. Every sip is as good as the first and one that is hard to tire of, a bomber might not be enough here."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"This is one brewery that has done nothing but impress me."
"Pours a deep dark opaque black, some red in the edges, very thick brown head forms drops a ton of lace, great retention and settles to a thick ring and layer, certainly looks like a RIS. Smell is awesome, toffee, chocolate, roast, intense pine and floral hoppiness, vanilla, dark fruit, cherries, brown sugar and molasses, figs, quite intense, alcohol comes through a bit but is well hidden, smells great. Taste is great as well, heavy caramel, chocolate and coffee, dark fruit, pine, grapefruit, brown sugar, vanilla, more toffee, light alcohol, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth. Wow, crazy good impy, no rough edges, insane smooth, neat kind of burnt caramel and vanilla flavour going on. Smuttynose really don't do anything thats not good."
"D- Definitely, smooth, great flavors, and as an aside note goes well with the cold and snow."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is nice. The ""burnt"" type of flavor that I am getting throws me off a little, but this is still a very flavorful stout, that doesn't feel overly thick like some others in the style are. Kind of reminds me of an East Coast version of Old Rasputin. I am glad I got to try it, and I'd happily enjoy another."
"Thanks ahatcher78 for not just a beer, but an experience."
"Overall, this beer was good. I sipped it throughout the night and enjoyed it. Definitely worth a try if you're a stout fan."
"Nice aroma: plenty of cocoa and tobacco, with some fruit and even a bit of burning wood. The alcohol is also quite present in the nose. But the alcohol is *too* present in the taste-- it smothers just about everything else. A bitter sting at the finish. The body is rather thin; given the style I expected a bit more thickness. Lovely color: a dark brown center with purple around the edges. A nice winter drink, but would be nicer if the alcohol made its entrance later."
"Got a bottle of this in a trade. Pours a deep brown, nearly black color with a milk chocolate head. Looks tasty. Smell is sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Some coffee in the mix as well. Moderate carbonation and very smooth mouthfeel. Wish I got more than one of these."
"D - Sipper. Not that balanced."
"D: Very drinkable. I had this beer cellared for about 8 months and I think I drank it in a valley. I have another bottle and will tuck it away for a year at least. If you have the early 2008 bottling hold on to it for a while longer."
"drinkability - Very nice impy let me tell you. At 10% I wish I cellared one of the, Goes down real smooth and has a lot of flavor."
"3 fingers Snickers nougat colored head. Aroma of cocoa nibs, sweet raisin toast...delightful. Hoppy, roasty chocolate, fumey flavor. Good hop bitterness on the finish. Webbed lacing in the Stone IRS glass. Very smooth, very complex flavor with perfect carbonation. Quite complex on the tongue...chocolate mousse. As good as there is for a RIS."
"Like a west coast IPA, this one has underlinings of cirus and malt. Mixed in, of course, with the anise, thick chewy biscuit maltbone. No hint of any high abv, be careful as she drinks like a dream, esp. on a crisp fall day. Which this one finishes as: crisp and clean (for a RIS, just leaving a subtle hop oil slick as it leaves). Whata great brew."
"I would love another beer and will look forward to having another in the future."
"The feel is chewy, creamy and a little oily. Maybe the most burnt beer I've ever had in my life. Pitch black. One and done for me. Tastes quite good, but in an extreme way. Best from a snifter."
"maybe not an ""elite"" imperial stout, but certainly one big, bold mother..worth trying for sure."
"Overall, I put this in my top 5 Imperial Stouts. It does not disappoint in any way."
"4/3.5/4/4/4"
"Mouthfeel is wonderful. Its full and developed without being over the top. At 10% (didn't learn until afterwards) I'm amazed at the drinkabilty and recommend this highly to those who dig the RIS."
"This was a deliciously surprising stout. Not surprising because I liked it so much - it does have great reviews already, obviously; but because it's so hoppy but so well put together. Great brew."
"D - No doubt this is a big beer, just as the label implies. But it does down smooth, and I'll be reaching for another in the near future. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours black with a one finger head that quickly disappears and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Huge chocolate, malt and coffee nose. Medium to full mouth body, very smooth. Taste is bitter coffee, some chocolate and the alcohol is a little up front. Drinkability is good and I really enjoyed this bomber. Overall a great RIS!"
"Overall not bad at all, though I have to admit, it needs a bit of time to come to its full protential. Really a bit too young to really appreciate fully. This was still a very solid effort, though not my favorite from them."
"Pours pitch black with a deep tan head. It has a very thick lacing. Smells strongly like caramel and roasted coffee and some fruit notes - almost has the scent of a deep red wine. Tastes good, but certainly bitter with a strong alcohol after-taste (there's no denying that it's 10.0% ABV). Full bodied with average drinkability. I'm a big fan of Smuttynose but don't consider this one of their best showings. It's a good beer and I'd certainly buy it again in a bomber but wouldn't buy a keg. It would be great as a holiday beer."
"Very enjoyable, although the alcohol bite is still a bit hot, which limits its drinkability a bit."
"Label is unusually smooth."
"Bonus: The label is super easy to remove cleanly for filling with homebrew!"
"A very solid effort from Smuttynose. Given the quality of their beers generally, I can't say I'm surprised. Recommended."
"22oz bomber from Ron's in Farmington. Pours an opaque dark black body with virtually no head. Citrussy hops are immediately noticeable, with much roastiness, resembling dark chocolate with coffee and molasses notes. A sweet chocolaty roastiness is immediately apparent, with strong berry notes also apparent, and a tinge of alcohol warming on the finish. Hints of grassy and citrussy hops are also present. A slight nuttiness presents itself on the finish. Full-bodied without being viscous, and with light to moderate carbonation, this one definitely is still a sipper for sure. Having said that, it's sweet and complex, and very tasty. Makes a good dessert by itself I'd say. A superb example of the style, and one of this brewery's finest offerings."
"Drinkability: A lot more drinkable than I remember. Perhaps it has mellowed with a slight bit of age. I picked up my bottle back in late May. A few more months and this beer would be even better. I'm hoping I can pick up more. Regardless, it's decent for the style but could use some aging."
"D: Pretty drinkable as I was able to drink the whole bomber without any trouble but it has alot of alcohol that sort of takes away from having more than one of these. But I would definately recommend it to someone."
"I love RIS, I always want more. The alcohol-y presence prevents mass consumption of this solid brew: not because it's impairing me, but rather because it's a bit hard to swallow. I would love to see an oak aged release of this guy. It would mellow the alcohol and mesh the hops a little better... mmm."
"drinkability: Pretty good, I like the only thing I don't like is there is a lot of burnt flavor there."
"I feel like this beer is different than most RIS's I've had...it has an unusual sweetness, maybe even some fruitiness along with its dry maltiness. Overall a pretty good beer, very sweet and heavy."
"Drinkability- A great sipper, hefty and not one to gulp but most glorious to savor and enjoy slowly!"
"there are nice coffee and chocolate flavors but they are being overshadowed by the strong bitterness of it. the same pungent hop odor is in the taste and kills much of the subtleties going on here. the alcohol slightly warms the throat but it is not too much."
"I'd say that I'll love to see how this ages, but I'm almost certain that it can't get much better."
"22oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours black with a light brown head. The aroma is unexpected - very hoppy. Oh, now this is nice - if you like the hops. Hop dominated flavour up front, hops linger in the taste and then chocolate notes appear in the aftertaste. Definitely the hoppiest ""imperial stout"" I've had. More IPA than stout in many ways. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Me likey!"
"With the bold American hops, it's really more of an American Imperial Stout."
"all in all a nice Imp Stout pretty easy drinking with nice flavor. Would have another."
"D. This is a sipper that gets better as it warms."
"Notes - The combo of the alcohol presence and the ABV will leave you having this as a treat after a hard autumn-days work."
"Pretty good for the style, not the best, would have been better if the alcohol was able to be hidden better. I have a feeling this would age rather well and might mellow out."
"Smuttynose Imperial Stout pours a beautiful inky black with a thick, creamy brown head. The aroma is fruity and surprisingly hoppy with citrusy and floral hops. The flavor is a sweet caramel roastiness with nice fruity hop flavor mixing in. This is definitely different from most imperial stouts I am used to and I'm surprised at the range of flavors I taste and how well they mix together. Kudo's to Smuttynose for another great beer in the Big Beer Series."
" There is an incredible characteristic in this beer that I have not tasted in any other craft. This is my first time to try this beer and I absolutely love it. I think I am very partial to it because it tastes so much like an incredible homebrew...what a great thing."
"Drink great for the ABV & style, but a touch too dry to attempt to session on"
"D: A nice sipper, and I ended up pairing it with some cocoa roasted almonds (actually, the cocoa powder scent and taste brought that on). They went together reasonably well. Being a little stiff, I'd take it easy on this on, and the hoppiness of it might start to get a little weird after a while."
"Body is medium/heavy. It may be thinned out a bit by the high ABV."
"Pours black with a very light bubbly sparse soapy tan head. Nose is definitely hoppy and roasty. Flavors of dark rich malty and dark chocolately bitter brownies and a very lightly bubbly but creamy flavor. Dry and cocoa like presence as well. Pretty highly hopped for an imperial stout, but still maintains the feel of the style from the massive rich dark malty flavors behind it. One of my favorites from a night of many beers."
"I'm finally glad to drink an RIS that has some kick to it. It seems like the last 10 I have had were easily drinkable, more like American Double Stouts than anything Imperial. Let me explain, an ADS has high alcohol and malts that take all the flavor. I feel an RIS has a bit more complexity, especially the hops. This one is bitter, but has the sweet notes to back it up, with some hoppiness that's been missing from other stouts like this. Highly recommended."
"Overall it's not quite Old Rasputin, but what is? A very nice brew."
"Taste: Dark chocolate, lemon marmalade, slightly burnt toast. A citrus hop smack appears in the finish, blending somewhat crudely with the alcohol. The combination of citrus and chocolate really doesn't work here. It's not awful, but it's not great."
"Tastes of chocolate, coffee, a big hop bite but it is well matched with malt. This is one of those beers that you just don't want to finish cause you only bought one."
"This poured pitch black with a tiny bit of dark tan head. It smelled strongly of alcohol, along with mocha and some hints of cherry. It tasted like bitter dark chocolate, burnt coffee and leathery malts, and even lemon and pine hops. It was thick with no carbonation, had a bitter aftertaste, and had significant alcohol warming. Overall this was a very powerful beer that was good for sipping, but had a really hard bite. It would be interesting to see if the flavor mellows some with aging, which could make this an exceptional beer."
"D: The taste unfortunately holds this one back substantially"
"I had high hopes for this beer, and it really is not a bad brew. However, it is just entirely too sweet for me and what I look for in the style."
"Man, I wish I had access to this awesome ass beer. Its super tasty and packs a punch.."
"2008 vintage served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black. Half-inch tan colored head dissapeared pretty quickly. Only evidence that there was a head was the thin ring of foam and ringlets that adhered to the perimeter of the glass. Thin, spotty lacing during the tasting. Immediate impression in the nose was of a baltic porter I recently tasted. Scents of dark chocolate and malt. Taste consistent with nose, but also detected a hint of dark fruit and some alcohol. Mouthfeel was not as bold as some of the RIS's I've been drinking lately, but not bad. Fairly silky with a touch of carbonation (again, some similarities to a baltic porter). Some astringency and alchol burn in the back of the throat. This is a sipper that mellows a little as it warms. I'd be curious to see if this softens a little with age."
"Recommended..."
"I just had a brand new 2008 edition, and everything is colored by the total freshness of the beer. Pitch black stout that reeked of hops and chocolate...yum. The taste was an amalgam of dark chocolate, dark roast espresso, and black licorice...with such an upfront presence of hops that these flavors weren't as pleasurable as they should have been. This beer clearly needs some time to calm down. As it stands, it is still quite good, but by October, it will be much better. By March 2009, it may be spectacular."
"Bottle. Poured a blackish-brown color with a medium brown head. Good lacing. Aroma is very pleasant, consisting of vanilla, coffee, and chocolate milk. Mouthfeel is very nice and full. Flavor is very nice, with a strong dark chocolate presence and hints of vanilla, bourbon, and coffee."
"It's a big beer that definitely needs to be sipped. I like it but the heavily roasted nature of this beast gets to be a little too much after a while."
"This is a pleasure to sip slowly - more accessible than would be expected from the style. Nice stuff."
"D: I expected that with a bit of age this one would really blow me away; instead it's mellowness, subdued aroma and fairly flat appearance underwhelmed a little. Flavor, though, is subtly brilliant: wide ranging, ever-changing and ultimately very satisfying. I believe I have another of these lurking (forgotten) somewhere; if not I'm hoping to get some more from one of my East Coast buds. Good stuff, worth recommending."
"All around awesome beer from an awesome brewery. I paired it w/ a bar of dark fair trade chocolate."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has an intensely bitter black malt and hops scent that is just to die for. It's rich and warm with a nice coffee-like roasted character. The taste is great as well. It has a nice black and crystal malt flavor that is rich up front and warm in the finish. Again, the hop character is tremendous. It cuts through the blackness and really stands out. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I've been waiting to get my hands on this beer for quite some time. It was definately worth the wait; maybe the best RIS I've ever had."
"Overall. Good brewery, good stout. This review is from a 22 ounce bottle purchased at Downtown Liquors in Boston's Davis Square and served tonight in a snifter glass. Vintage 2006."
"It's interesting to see how my palette has changed over the years. I remember many moons ago when I thought this brew was too hoppy fresh and I would buy several bottles to lay down and mellow out. I still really enjoy this beer aged, but the growing hop head within me is more and more digging this fresh with each passing year."
"Incredible aroma of licorice, chocolate and hints of currant. Goes down like wine, with low carbonation and high alcohol. We had this at The Moan and Dove in Amherst, Mass., which has an incredible selection of Imperial Stouts, but this was the best. Really impressive -- probably a top-5 from this brewery."
"Drinkability- I really like the flavor of this beer and everything is great until the aftertaste. It has a weird lingering bitterness that somehow remains sweet. Its very unique for the style and its definitely the biggest hopped Imp Stout Ive tasted. Very distinctive."
"Pours pitch black with a lasting dark tan head. Rich malts on the nose. Flavor is extremely robust with heavy malts. Thick coffee grinds there as well. The aftertaste really lasts on this one. Feel is thick on the liquid and good with the carbonation. I seem to recall Kai at the Wine Gallery in Boston telling me I really needed to try this on tap. Well thank you Kai. This beer is tasty!"
"Poured very strong to get a beautiful 3 firnger rich foamy milk chocolate colored head. Sits atop a pitch black body that lets no light through. Leaves heavy lace. Smokey malt highlights the nose with hints of peperoni, coco, and dill, or maybe green olives. This is a very rich but crisp stout as I take first sip. Bold and zesty mix of woodsy spices and dark bitter coco grace the tongue. A long lasting deep bitter feel compliments the finish and dominates the mouthfeel. Alchol warms belly well. Enjoyable drinking stout, but not one of my favorites within the style."
"Overall: I think it qualifies as big beer worthy of a big beer series. Tons of flavor with nice aromas. I really enjoyed drinking this one. If I had access to it, I would buy several more. Do yourself a favor grab one and try it if you can get it, while your at it grab a bottle or two extra for those unlucky folks like myself who can't."
"Poured black with a tan head and okay lacing. The smell is a nice balance of heavy citrusy hops, roasted aromas, and big malt aromas of dark fruit, cacao, and coffeee. The taste has a similar profile with the addition of big licorice flavors. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. This is a big beer with big flavors, but everything is nicely integrated and it is not hot at all. Not my top RIS, but very nice indeed."
"D - drink it slow and enjoy."
"Overall a very good RIS, but not one of my favorites. Not enough hop flavor for me, but hey I'll still drink it and I really enjoyed it. I would love to sit one down for a year and see what happens to the alcohol flavor, my guess is the beer will get better with age. Still, Smuttynose never fails to produce an excellent brew and this RIS follows suit."
"I think i will lay the other two bottles of this down until next winter and perhaps the alcohol will mellow and allow the other flavors to shine as i know they could."
"D - Rich, robust and everything a RIS should be. Plenty of malt w/ out an overabundance of bitterness, just enough to balance out theis malty behemoth. Very fine, well made, One of the best I have ever had. Complex and flavorful - almost too good to share."
" Fantastic experience, and now i must wonder how much better it could possibly be....???"
"I'm sitting here, with 40 degree weather outside, savoring a dark, chewy, nice RIS. I'm glad I put two of these away in my cellar, and I'm glad the weather has turned and I can enjoy this style again."
"nevertheless, good brew"
"F - Ahh, food. This is one of those beers that showcases beer's full range of food pairings. It won't be friendly to much in the food world, but what it does go well with are things that are impossible to pair with any other beverage. Take this alongside any dessert that is heavy with dark chocolate and caramel flavors. It will also complement the darkest fruits you can imagine, such as figs, raisins, and black currants. A long-aged, acidic cheddar will provide a perfect contrast, but it won't marry well with any other cheeses. The few things that this beer would go well with will be near-perfection. Everything else is out the window. However, this would go perfect with a nice cigar after a long dinner."
"Notes: This one is perfect for any cold winter night and not too shaby for a cool fall night. In fact the colder the night the better it can warm up the coldest of nights. I definately will have a stock of this beauty for the winter. I'm contemplating giving this masterpiece from Smuttynose fives across the board. Should I dare yes I do dare and will. For all those who adore Russian Imperial stouts this is for you Prost."
"Its one of those wonderful things in really big beers where no part goes too big, too over the top, the balance is right, the intensity is right, its really a fantastic experience."
"Heavy bodied, but tasted flat, no carbonation. Heavy alcohol too. I'd say this beer is not good for everybody, but it's great for me."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I could drink all winter. Not a beer for fast drinking; rather, this is a beer for savoring. I recommend sipping this beer in front of a roaring fire while the snow piles up outside. Bonus points if you have a golden retriever curled up around your feet while you discuss the finer points of Salterian political theory with a drinking companion."
"D: This is one of my all-time favorite RI Stouts. If you are a fan of the style, you should really seek one of these babies out. I wish they would make this a year-round release. Nice work Smutty!"
"It's kind of cool for late Aug. A good day for a big beer like this."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter roasted malt with some coffee notes is interesting. Taste is dominated by some roasted malt, which are quite bitter with some dry coffee notes. I thought the taste was a bit too dry generally and some sweetness to balance the dryness would have been good. Body is quite full with some good carbonation and no alcohol was discernable."
"Hard to give a 3.5 for taste over a 4 but had to be done. A solid RIS mind you. Not as complex and the nose would indicate, still big and very chalky dry. Full of roasted cocoa barley, with black and red currants. Gooey mollasses and other dark fruits. Bone dry, hints of alcohol, with a moderate to slightly high carbonation that hurt mouthfeel some."
"A bit warming. Not quite as thick and chewy as I like, but I dug the chocolately flavors. Good body and carbontaion. Enjoyable."
"Smutty has a winner here."
"Its good, but its not great. If you like chocolaty beers, like a Mackeson triple stout, you'll find this enjoyable."
"I had this on tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House in New York City, served in a gobletish glass. The appearance was dark brown black, with chocolate milk colored but thin foam. The aroma was rich with roasted malts and a little bit of chocolate. I guess I'd say the flavor was rich too (it was), roasty and burnt malts, but it was a little more bitter and significantly less sweet than my favorite imperial stouts. Thick enough to coat your tongue with flavor, but the bitterness of the flavor results in a deduction on drinkability from this reviewer."
"dark - almost black with a dark brown head that shrunk but didn't go right away and left nice lace... nose is of hops, chocolate, coffee, toffee, sugar, and malt... taste smooth and almost the same as nose, but hops weren't prevalent as much... very drinkable... goes down easily... no abv on bottle, but i wonder seeing as this is an imperial stout with minimal boozy kick... i'll have another please!"
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Very nice very dark brown color with a very dark brown head. The head was nice and sticky, clung to the sides of the glass for a while. Aroma started off as sweet like brown sugar with oatmeal cookie scents. Taste was slightly bitter, but also has hints of chocolate and sugar. Nicely balanced. The beer was slightly sticky in the mouth which was nice. The bitterness lingered on the tounge and in the mouth for too long detracting from the overall mouthfeel, but beyond that was a solid stout."
"D - Definitely a winner as far as a sipper with some complex flavors. Looking at my review from last year's edition when fresh it looks like that roasty flavor is again providing a nice complement to the dark chocolate-like flavors."
"D- I think this beer is well balanced and very drinkable. For a 10%beer the alcohol was hidden very well. If I can get my hands on some more of this I would love drinking it again."
"Overall: A very tasty and complex RIS, the head brewer at smuttynose recommends letting this one sit for about 6 months which i did and i would say it could go even longer to let the hop bite mellow out a bit more. Still a very tasty RIS, well done smutty"
"D - Overall this is a very good RIS, with a much hoppier taste than most RIS's. This was a very inexpensive bottle, so I'd say its definitely worth picking up if you can."
"D- a sipper for sure and a beer that I would try again. It loses points with the over the top burned malts however."
"Drinkability: This is one great Imperial Stout. And what a bargain at 3.99 a bomber. You gotta be kidding me?!?! Bring it on. I'll take advantage of that next time I see and stock my cellar with a few of these bad boys."
"22oz bomber bottle with a map of the islands off the New Hampshire coast for a label. Jet black and inky. Color sticks to the glass with every swirl. Head of many different sized bubbles calms to a ring of tiny bubbles. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla bean, bourbon and dried dark fruits. Flavors are all robust and in your face. Dark bitter chocolate, vanilla bean, bourbon, licorice, espresso and dried plums. Starts dryish and leads into a very tangy finish that begins a little past mid-point and lingers into a long aftertaste. Wow. Big beers do indeed deserve big bottles. To appreciate all that's going on in this beer, skip the food pairing and just sip, savor and enjoy everything this local beer has to offer."
"Pours a pitch black bodied beer with a dull but dark colored, thin, one-finger head. Aroma is on par for the style, malty roast up front, the hop intensity is low, and there are definite alcohol aromas. Smells reminiscent of 'gonzo"" to me. Taste--this has much of what im looking for per style, it's smooth, floral, intense but not excessively so in a way that would make it any less drinkable. Up front it's luscious roast flavors, sweet, the hops don't kill it, but it fades into a bitter chocolate finish behind the bit of grapefruit-like hops. The flavors are good here, and it's very enjoyable drinking. The mouthfeel is 'wow' thick, and good carbonation for drinking, but too sparkly on the tounge for me. Over all, this is an impressive beery. It's very monochromatic, so to speak...but I dig that. I imagine if I was blindfolded and didn't know this was a smuttynose beer I'd still know that it was smutty."
"This beer was a pleasure from start to finish: pours well, black as death appearance, cocoa brown head, robust but smooth taste (with hints of chocolate and coffee), malty, not too strong (despite 10.00% ABV). A great dessert beer! Will have again!!!"
"The drinkability of this stout is excellent. The flavors are great and each sip left my mouth watering for more."
"pours black with slight ruby brown hints. nice dark tan head. looks really nice. definitly picking up some citrusy notes, roasted coffee. but definitly an element of sweetness. citrus hop taste, very mellow on the roasted flavor. hints of dark fruit add to the complexity. one of the best imperial stouts i've had, nicely done beer. really well rounded. i think this might be the best smutty so far."
"An excellent RIS, with a good thickness in mouthfeel, black body and substantial head. Aroma coffee-chocolate, with C-hop. Aged about a year so mellowness therefore the hops make their presence but do not detract from the drinking experience. Nicely malted chocolate, with roast also in the secondary. Maybe not the best RIS ever, but damn good and will have again."
"22 ounce bomber. High quality, a top notch beer. This is a very nice looking beer. It pours dark brown from the bottle and appears black in the glass. The head is dark, like any good Imperial stout should be. However, any beer that doesnt pour like pure black oil from the bottle cannot get top marks in the appearence score from me. I want every Imperial Stout to be pitch black, no matter what, sorry. Aroma indicates that this is a fresher bottle, it has some nice malt elements (chocolate, roast), but it is mainly dominated by huge, citrusy hops. Flavor is very expressive and concentrated. It is massively flavorful in both malts and hops. The malt shows hints of chocolate, coffee and roast, while the massive hops add hints of citrus and pine. A very fresh, hoppy Imperial Stout. This is a tasty beer, but not sublime fresh. I could see this aging really well."
"Dangerously drinkable...Smuttynose Big Beers kick ass once again."
"D: Well.. The beer has many pleasing flavors, but as said before, it had a very ""harsh"" ending in the taste. While I wouldn't call it a chore to finish the beer, I did not gulp it down either. A sipper for sure."
"Definitely a sipper...and definitely not 'another RIS'...this is unique...The Czar would be pleased."
"D - Extremely good. This beer delivers a total package. The abv is very high, but the only place you can detect it is the warming sensation. There is really nothing bad about this beer. I guess I wish it has most chocolately flavors than burnt flavors - but that is preference more than anything. Went well with my dinner or wheat spagetti in a spicy tomato cream sauce and spinach. Definitely worth a try - yet another Smuttynose winner."
"D- I think this isn't to good at all. It tastes like they just threw a bunch of stuff in and called it good. They need to refine it a lot more IMO."
"Grab a few of these and let them age.... highly recommended."
"Drinks well. 22oz bomber? Gone. Could use a bit more feeling to it, seems a bit thin considering its look and style."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chocolatey, and smooth."
"D: Very good for a beer of this strength. I finished the bomber in just over an hour; it wasn't tough to do so at all."
"A very good Imperial Stout and another nice big beer offering from Smuttynose."
"The 10.0 ABV is there as a solid warming sensation in the chest on the way down. A good brew for the BarcaLounger."
"Pours a nice thick black color, tiny fizzy brown head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is very nice of sweet roasted malts, slight hops, and coffee/caramel. The taste is great, lots of roasted malts, big on the coffee/caramel. The mouthfeel is chewy, with a nice dry/slightly bitter finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, man these few brew's I've had from this brewery are very tasty. This is an exceptional RIS, highly recommended."
"Very drinkable for a impy stout.... great brew."
"Overall: I love hoppy dark beers, so I loved this one. I was impressed with how fruity and tropical it got as it warmed. There was also a smokiness in the malt that distinguished it from some other RISs I have had. The aftertaste was especially long and drawn out for this beer too, even for a RIS. Phenomenal beer."
"As many have mentioned, this beer is a ""sipper"". Best shared with a friend or two so as not to fall off the recliner! A good swing at the style, something I would definitely buy again. Goes well with blue cheese ... esp. the stuff from Trader Joe's soaked in olive oil with pepper corns."
"2007 vintage. Absolutely stunningly black-huge cocoa/tan head on top. Perfect looking beer-RIS or otherwise-looks like a glossy magazine ad sitting here. Chocolate and hoppy aromas dominate. Deep roasted malt flavor with a big dose of hops thrown in. Rich, deep dark chocolate flavor-makes me think I am sucking on bakers chocolate. Smooth and creamy body-well balanced against the bittersweetness in the flavor. Just an incredible beer. Has to be one of the top 3 RIS I have enjoyed. Big in flavor and body-much ""bigger"" then Brooklyn or Old Rasputin overall. Great stuff."
"Smuttynose is likely my favorite regional brewery and this may well be the best beer out of their big beer series. This is a must try."
"Drinkability: Superb."
"It's most likely that this is way too fresh to drink yet. I wish that I had waited 6-8 months to try this. Because of that, I've adjusted my ratings numbers to average out the same as the overall average and will pick up another to hold to for a while and rate it again. I've never noticed such a big diferrence in what I expect a beer will be and what I find due to what is likely just the difference in aging."
"D---Way to full bodied to session. The flavor grew on me but it was just to cloying in my opinion. I prefer a drier imp stout."
"The previous night I detected a 'fresh' hop taste, which seemed like a young beer that needs some time for that to mellow. I suspect a little aging will smooth that out and make this one quite splendid."
"Drinkability- Tremendous RIS. Hoping I can get my friend who used to live in NH to pick me up some when she goes home to visit. Top notch and right up there with Stone and Alesmith."
"I get the feeling this might be an interesting beer ti cellar so I stocked away a few of these and plan on reviewing again at 6 months and 1 year."
"22oz bottle: Poured like black gold with a huge cascade of waterfalling bubbles, rising into a 2-inch thick fortress of solid tan foam. The aroma is big and sweet, roasty and even hoppy. The flavor is even more robust and an incredible blend of titilating flavors ... dark, bitter chocolate ... dark cherry ... oak ... whiskey ... and a big hop resiny anchor. This is gut-buster, and I plan to enjoy it for the next hour or so. (#2754, 3/16/2007)"
"Flavour is a beautiful combo of sweet maltiness & well rounded hoppiness. Bitter, but not overly so. Still malty, warm alcohol, roasted malts detecable. Lucious hop flavour. Finishes dry enough to leave you wanting more. An excellent augmentation to an already solid beer"
"This is a very good stout. It's a little on the hoppy side, which I like. Quite complex as well. Definitely a winner. Recommended."
"The pour from the bomber into my relatively small La Moneuse glass raises a one finger coffee-colored head that seems content in staying for a while, but falling quite gradually. The lacing seems too thick for its task, but still manages to cling well. The nose is highly roasted, with lots of bitterness and esters. Chocolate comes through, too. The taste seems to be relaxed for an Impy at first: not too bitter or overpowering. However, even when drinking it too cold, it ends with a lovely balanced mocha taste, like having your first of a big bag of chocolate covered espresso beans. After a while, it becomes hard to pick up the mocha finish, but the beer remains very balanced. The mouth is very thick, with only a hint of carbonation. A fine Impy, which I'm glad that I sat on since last August, from my NJ beer purchases."
"Not sessionable. Too syrupy-sweet on the intake and too hi ABV. But relatively drinkable for ths style. Great for a night as freezing as tonight. And goes perfectly with bittersweet Belgian dark chocolate."
"Drinkability - Well, even though I shared part of the bomber, I have a nice little buzz going on, so the alcohol is definitely there even if the taste wasn't too pronounced. But this beer is so well balanced, smooth, and rich that I need to go out and get some more bottles. With at least one for the cellar..."
"Pours pitch black with a finger of dark brown head and some lacing. Smells strongly of dark roasted malts with hints of chocolate, coffee, and possibly molasses, very inviting. Taste is much less malty than the smell. At first I am hit with roasted malty goodness. This quickly gives way to a fairly agressive hop flavor that builds through the finish. This is definitely an imperial stout for hopheads. Nice mouthfeel with a medium body that is slightly slick. Drinkability is good for a an imperial stout with a 10% ABV. I'm not quite the hophead I used to be so its a bit over-hopped for my tastes but enjoyable none the less."
"Forget Darklord this is the real deal right here. The large choclate head laces the glass as the perfectly dark rich brown liquid is sipped. The smell is amazing, it is so hoppy so alive with malt that the roastyness is underwhelming. The flavor then shifts gears and delves into a full roasted malt with a raisin bloom and a mellow sweetness that comes up well to the hop resin finish. The long lasting aftertaste is quite pleasent and the thick and smooth mouthfeel allows for prolonged enjoyment. Very drinkable and dangerously enjoyable."
"D: This is a nice RIS, but that's it. Worth trying, probably worth drinking on a regular basis if you have easy access to it, but nothing that I'll be dying to have again."
"This was a dark black beer with a short brown head. It looked delicious in the glass. The smell was faint but nice and enticing. The taste was a little coffee and a little chocolate. I didnt really taste the alcohol at all.The drinkability on this one was awesome and I wished I had another glass. It would be nice to buy this locally but oh well."
"Mouthfeel is thick and sweet with crispness maintained by soft carbonation and I guess acidity...doesn't cloy although sweet is a big part of this beer. Roasted coffee and malty flavors at first...substantial grapefruity bitterness comes in and the lingering flavor is an IPA-type grapefruity hoppiness. This is very good. Some dark fruit, cassis? blackberry? comes along with the initial sweetness...roasty toastiness...some melted snow lacto-creaminess...and the hops at the end, lingering in a long finish, wow, this is really good stuff. Smuttynose continues to impress. Maybe there's a little heat. Some of the sweetness might be due to alcohol...10% is really pushing the limit here, it works with this brew but it's tough to integrate that much alcohol. I would say this is a solid, successful effort for when you want a rich, robust, warming beer, yes, while in Russia or even a bleak cold February day in New England or New York. As I sip this I am struck by how amazingly drinkable this gigantic beer is. The bitter hoppy finish really complements the generally sweet roasted malt in a terrifically enjoyable way, keeps you coming back for more. Very impressive effort."
"This brew isn't amazingly complex but it is extraordinarly rich, full bodied and viscious with a huge grip. A brew this rich is a definite sipper, I can't see drinking more than a single glass."
"Aquired this from Brewfan in a trade. thanks! Pours completely black with a nice brown head. laces like carbonated maple syrup might. looks great. Odor starts out as slightly metallic, but as it warms it becomes a much more rummy chocolate with warm plums and raisins. Flavor is very nice as well...heavy chocolate fudge, slightly coffee-laced. alcohol only present as a warming quality. Some fruitiness (black plums?). Finish is bitter expresso. Velvety and smooth. A classic American style Imperial Stout...really a pleasure to drink."
"Pours an inky black with a thin dark brown head. Aroma is of roasted malts, dark chocolate, a little coffee, and some smoke. The smoke comes out more in the flavor, almost like sausage (in a good way). The roastiness of the malt flavor and the chocolate really work well together. A nice piney hop flavor lingers after the sip. Maybe a bit of cigar in the flavor also. Full, chewy mouthfeel. No trace of alcohol in the flavor. This is a great beer to relax with on a cool, rainy winter day."
"Another fine, fine brew by Smuttynose. Total class. Dangerously well-hidden 10%, and incredibly drinkable for such a big beer."
"Smuttynose's Big Beer series has yet to let me down. Please come to KC"
"Overall: I have had this a couple of times and find it very difficult to drink; by the end of the bottle, the mushroom flavors just get in the way of the enjoyment of this beer"
"It was pretty smooth for Stout and for for the alcohol content. The sweet taste also caught me off guard but it was a joyful superise. I tried it with a few other beers. It was the last one on the sampler board it was not the best on but it was a good one to end with."
"Drinkability: Misses out somehow, but still not a bad glass of beer. The extremely burnt malt flavor is a little too much to be ideal. The hop finish is hidden a little bit by this."
"Tried Stone's Russian Stout a day before, and was motivated to give this beer a try. Definitely better than the Stone, but not my favorite flavor at all. Toasted coffee and chocolate, with a cherry and caramel flavor to follow. Worth a try. Low in carbonation."
"Deep, dark color. Tan bubbly head. Frothy, very frothy, and creamy looking. Lacing around the glass. Quite, quite pretty. Smells like, oh, what is the word... chocolate. Much, much, chocolate. Sweet chocolate, no bitterness going on here. Sugary, too. Perhaps a vanilla extract thingy, mixed with a bit of maple syrup. Taste is a chocolate boozy explosion. Ballsy, definitely ballsy. The alcohol ain't trying to hide, it's right up there, and mellows out well with the chocolate flavor. Still, it's not overly sweet- I'm not sure I could drink one of these guys by myself, at least not quickly, but it's not painful. This is dessert in a glass, a nightcap, not a starter brew. Very nice. Especially for five bucks."
"Creamy textures, layers of flavor. This is an excellent night cap of a stout."
"Big thanks to HimmerMan for this one."
"Victory may be the standard ""hoppy imperial stout," but this one is better. This beer is rich, complex, sweet, bitter, burnt, roasted. Very creamy mouthfeel, yet with a persistent carbonation. The hops have mellowed since this beer's release, but it still expresses a very ""green"" leafiness. The finish is complex, with burnt coffee, chocolate and a hint of alcohol flavor mingling together. One of my favorite imperial stouts for sure."
"Quite tasty and drinkable for a big ABV. No problems finishing a bomber, although a second one will not be following."
"I don't hate this beer, but I don't love it."
"-Oelergud"
"Hops dominate the nose. The taste is all hops, with a slight coffee bitterness mixed in. Tastes good, but not the leader in its group. A smooth drinking beer, but is a tad bit thin for a Imperial Stout. Glad I tried it, would make for a good sessionable brew. Worth a try."
"Just another fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery."
"Overall a balanced, slightly sweet RIS. Rather inoffensive and easy to drink. Amazing in a brew with such high ABV. Not as hearty as some RIS out there, but it is quite tasty."
"Very easy drinking big stout, alcohol is well hidden and flavors are a little more mild than I would have expected."
"D: I spent a very pleasant couple of hours drinking the bomber of this. A great sipping beer, and it really did the trick as I stayed inside on a rainy day to take care of some ""inside work."""
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied. The flavor is long lasting due to a bit of oilyness. The alcohol is present in the mouthfeel but no more than expected. I enjoyed the beer from the moment I opened it. The beer is strong and provides a pleasing alcohol warmth. I would have this routinely if it was available in my area. Thanks again bwyker!"
"Heck of a beer. Sure there are better RIS's, but this was damn tasty and only $5 a bomber. Standard RIS appearance, pitch black with a tan head and good enough retention. Smelled of hardcore espresso, tasted of coffee, espresso, some creamy chocolate, with a little fruit and hops in the mix. Pretty drinkable for a thick 10% beer. I'd buy it again."
"I see a lot of good reviews. This beer was sent as part of a trade so someone liked this. I realise I may have one bad example of a great beer, but my experience was bad and I need others to be wary of this"
"Yum-skiddl-e-dumcious."
"Pours out black, with a tan head, leaving some lacing, but the head remains throughout the glass. Smells is full of piney hops, some maltiness, but hops seem to be at the forefront. Taste had a little bit of a vegetable taste at first, but I'm glad it's short lived. From there, the taste has a nice pineyness to it, and then shifts more towards the roasty and chocolate tastes. Little more than medium bodied, medium carbonation. Pretty good, I don't know that I'd buy this often though. Worthy of a try."
"D: Pretty good IRS, a little too hoppy for me was expecting something a little more stout like not like a pale, just a little different than what I expected I guess. Nonetheless a very good beer."
"Pours a deep, dark, jet black, with a small but tight bubbled tan head that leaves a ring but no lace. Aromas are quite nice -- plenty of hops (piney), along with sweet yeast, berry fruits, and roasted malts. It's a typical RIS nose, save the addition of hops to the mix. The flavors mirror the nose, with a nice malt/hops counterpoint at play. Slight bitterness up front, followed by rich, full espresso-and-cream malts at the mid-palate. At the finish, the hops pick up and provide a nice, balanced tingle on the sides of the tongue while the malts work the middle. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is alternately bracing and silky-smooth, as the hops and malts take their respective turns affecting the tongue. Overall, this is a nicely hopped RIS. I'm not sure how this tasted when it first came out, but at this point it's drinking great."
"D- A sipper for sure, an awesome beer for a cooler fall night ... going to finish this one off with a sweet Dominican cigar."
"Served chilled in a pint glass. Love Smuttynose products so this one shouldn't dissapoint. Poured a very dark brown, but, was black in the glass, an no light could pass through. Had about one finger of bubbly coffee colored head that hung around for a few minutes. Very little lacing. Smelled of Oak, Bourbon, Chocolate. First taste was a little overwhelming. Second taste: creamy mix of Hops, Coffee, Bourbon, Oak. Chocolate finished a little bitter with a little taste of alcohol. A very complex stout. Definintly a winner in my book."
"Overall a good beer, although not as standout as I thought it might be."
"there was some disagreement with the group of us reviewing this beer. i enjoyed it alot for trying something different and hopping up the impy, and i thought that the hops worked really well (much better than i thought they would). other tasters thought it covered up the stout character too much and they didn't enjoy that. definitely something to try for the hophead and stout lover alike. form your own opinion on this one. i think freshness will make a lot of difference with this one."
"Last swigs: Cocoa and ash RIS. Enjoyable. The 10% was hidden well. Feel is a bit too gritty a la brownie dough and charcoal. Edible, not regretable. Forgetable? A bit heavy handed without finesse."
"overall - I recommend trying this if you love their porter, but when the porter is half the costs (half the ABV?) and has about 90% of the flavor... ohh, their both great."
"Overall, it's not bad but too sticky and sweet, even for the style. It does have a certain smoothness, but average drinkability for the style."
"Another solid brew from Smutty. Nothing innovative in terms of flavor, but nothing you can really complain about either."
"D - This is pretty damn good drinkable beer considering the bigness and complexity of it. Smuttynose never fails to please me."
"Cheers!"
"A surprise for me is the aroma; I can smell the hops! This is a nice change from Imperial Stouts that are all about burnt malt. The appearance is the typical, dark black, with less head than I would like to see. The flavor is marvelously well balanced with chocolate malt and coffee coming through. Very drinkable (recommend a nice 55 deg). A great value on a very good IS."
"Deep black pour, with a fair viscosity. No head, only a dark tan ring. Roasty aroma with a hint of dark fruit tang, perhaps cherry. The flavor is rather seet and chocolatey with more dark cherry taste. The finish has a hint of coffee and light smoke. To me the overall taste is not balanced well, its too sweet and not dry/bitter enough to compensate. The alcohol doesn't come out too strongly for an Imperial. Mouthfeel is quite thick, and oily slick too. The carbonation has a subtle tingle. Overall a decent Imp. Stout, but with all the possibilities for the style I would expect more..."
"Overall: A nice, strong RIS. I may buy a bottle to age for a year or so to see how this changes."
"Drinkability: The beer is too strong to be a quaffer but the flavors are strong, so give a bomber a chance."
"Drinkability: Very, very nice! It reminds me of my recent trip to New Hampshire. (Oddly enough, I didn't get to try the beer there). I'd stumble out of the hunting lodge each morning with the scent of the oiled logs and damp pines beside me, and sit beside the remains of the previous night's fire enjoying a piece of burnt toast and a cup of dark coffee. The cool shade of the pine trees, and the dampness of the grass would sooth me, and I'd enjoy my breakfast while listening to the call of the loons on the lake - A bit verbose, but true! It's an excellent American take on an originally British style. Seek this one out! It may just be Smuttynose's best beer to date!"
"Cheers!"
"MF/D: Medium bodied id say for a RIS, with light carbonation. Hardly any alcohol to speak of, but it is warming. Pretty quaffable for the style. Good, but not great and alittle different than others ive had. Like all other smuttynose products it is def worth a try."
"D-Dangerously easy to drink. I let half of the 22oz bomber warm to just below room temp for the full flavors to come through. The cold really killed the complexity of this beer. Definately not a beer to drink everyday, but it packs a mean punch and a lot of flavor. Well done."
"The only thing hindering this beer (for me at least) is the quite noticeable alcohol flavor."
"Thanks to ghostwalker for the bombers!"
"a sipper, as there is a lot of potent flavors in here, but pretty drinkable for the big-ness of this beer."
"Poured a ink black with a thin mocha colored head that vanished pretty quickly,aromas of dark fruit like raisin dipped in rum and dark roast coffee with bittersweet chocolate as well I noticed some leafy hop wich was very nice.Alot of things going on other than the standard impy stout flavors sure the deeply roasted malt and rummy flavors are there but what a nice drier earthy finish with notes of mint,I really like the hop profile to this beer it gives it more noticable flavor and depth.I liked this offering alot I applaud Smuttynose for their use of hops in this impy stout."
"Overall, an awesome beer from Smuttynose with a price tag that blew me away, $3.99. Man for that price I don't think I could pass on a couple cases."
"D: Drinkability is pretty high on this Big beer series offering from Smuttynose. They never seem to dissapoint and this isn't any different. Good one to try--the other 2 in my cellar with be kept for sometime and then reviewed. I'm hoping they'll get better."
"D: This one is definitely a sipper and not a pounder, but it goes down very easy. I could go with it for a whole night but I would stretch out a bomber or two to last the whole night. This is a very, very good beer. What struck me most about it is that it has more of a hops character than other RIS’s that I’ve had, which was a pleasant surprise."
"""Bottle Conditioned in 2006."" Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, chilled then set out for a few minutes. First of all, this one looks stupendous with an utterly impenetrable black body crowned by a dense espresso-crema foam. Smells slightly hoppy at first; Cascades, or something along those lines. As it warms, roasted black malts yield a mocha-coffee aroma along with a minerally molasses sweetness. Piney hops are up bright and early in the taste. The alcohol, which evidently needs more time to meld/subdue/whatever then sweeps in with a sour bitter bite. This doesn't last too long -- the coffee and chocolate flavors of the dark roasted malts emerge with a welcome sweetness. The roasty finish then yields to more piney hops and alcohol bitterness. Burnt toast malt character, pine sap hoppiness and sourish alcohol bitterness linger in the aftertaste. Burps are a pleasant, if slightly medicinal, hop-fest. Finely attenuated carbonation evinces a smooth mouthfeel that works all too well with the thick chewiness of the body. Overall, a promising RIS that seems to need about a year to really settle into a groove. At that point, it will likely be a top-notch representation of the style."
"Black with chestnut highlights and a thin brown head that reduced to a ring. Light lacing was left behind as it receded. Caramelized sugar and roast in the aroma, along with a bit of sour cherry and chocolate. Piney hops appeared as it warms. Solid bitterness balanced out the malt, caramel, roast, and chocolate. Light alcohol warmth filled out the finish. Chewy texture with soft carbonation and a full body. Quite an easy drinking imperial stout. Thanks Zithal!"
"Really a beautiful beer. This pours an inky black and is topped by a thick, chunky tan colored head. The aroma has tons of chocolate covered cherries, espresso, and a mild mandarin orange hop. Depth of flavor. Very chocolaty, this beer comes across as the beer version of a mocha as the chocolate and coffee combine. The bitterness from the hops is like a lemon or orange twist added to the mocha. As the flavor settles in my mouth it brings out sherry, and cabernet flavors. Very nice. He mouth feel is smooth, thick and rich. No alcohol heat at all. Very drinkable. Maybe the best beer of this series."
"This pours a ink jet black with a decent sized tan head, this is very nice looking. The smell is surprisingly hoppy. There is some roasted and malty aromas along with chocolate, but the hops dominate this beer. I wonder if the hop smell is true to this type a beer? The taste is a sharp crisp hop filled stout. The other flavors include chocolate and roasted malt. The m/f is medium with the hop flavors clashing with the roasted flavors. This is a pretty good beer ,but I'm not sure it's true to the style."
"Pours black with a nice tan head. Smells of coffee, rich chocolate, and some piney hoppiness. Acidic roastiness up front in the taste, a hint of the sweet chocolatey malts, and a slightly bitter finish with some nice warming alcohol. Big beer series is definitely acurate with 22 oz of Imperial Stout. Medium to heavy body starts creamy, but as it warmed seemed to thin out. I drank this 2006 sample fresh as it's my only one but would like to see what a year in the cellar does to mellow the hops and bring out the maltiness. Nevertheless, fresh was very good."
"Smutty did a very nice job with this. It is absolutely perfect in the glass...deep brown, with a wonderfully frothy head. The smell is also wonderful. It smells of deep, smoky chocolate. The taste is the same. The depth and richness of the chocolate in this beers causes it to remind me an imperial porter. There is also a nice residual sweetness, to go along with a hop bite and slight fruitness. It is very complex, with a lot of flavors all goingg on at once. The beer is very clean, and there is nothing really objectionable about it, and it is, as a result, very drinkable. Smutty has really outdone themselves with this offering."
"Pours with virtually no head, and is darker than used 30 weight. Aroma of hops, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Deep burnt coffee and chocolate tones, lots of hops too. Very thick and creamy texture. Leaves a sticky lasting Belgian lace. This is great imperial. i want more :)."
"Smuttynose Imperial Stout pours a deep black color with a thin dark tan head. Head quickly fades to a rim around the glass. Good lacing. Aroma is dominated by green, piney hops up front, with some roasted and chocolate smells if you try really hard to ignore the hops. Delicious: chocolate, coffee, hoppy, and a surprisingly bitter, dry finish. Full bodied, with a moderate amount of fine carbonation. I love the taste of this beer; the hops may be overwhelming for some, but I find it amazingly drinkable for such a strong beer. Another outstanding Big Beer from Smutty."
"Drinkability seems OK. The hoppy and dry finish would limit me to one bomber for the evening, but it is a pleasure to savor."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer goes in easy, and doesn't offer much in the way of carbonation or complexity. The major focus of rich, mouth-encompassing domination speaks loudly enough, and flavor is in the driver's seat. I enjoyed sampling this beer tonight in its infancy, and look forward to its offerings in young adulthood and beyond."
"A totally different animal from previous vintages, bigger and badder for sure."
"I liked this one. It was nice and oaky so that the chocolate notes were turned down, making this a nice take on an IS."
"A great brew. Would like another."
"The most different stout I have ever had. Pours pitch black, cannot see through it at all. Smells quite hoppy. Taste? The most hoppy stout I have ever tasted, the only hoppy stout I have ever had. But damn it is way awsome and different. Slight cocoa taste way in the background. Overall this is a way amazing beer, I wish I had bought a few more bottles."
"I feel like this beer would cellar really really well...maybe I'll tuck a bottle away and find out"
"First my thank you to good ole Daggereyes for giving me the heads up on the availability of this fine beverage. It pours very dark out of the bottle, A nice tan foamy head forms. What is that smell? Is this an IPA? Floral aromas impact the olfactory neves. The brain thinks an IPA is coming its way. The first taste almost confirms that suspicion. But wait, the brew is a bit to cool. It is not ready for consumption. It needs to warm up to near room temp. Ah, that is more like it, The malty nature now mingles with the hop features, This ambrosia now smells damn near perfect. The taste has changed: a nice bitter tang and sweet malty careses. This is an outstanding brew. I am going back for more, so I am not going to name the store. If you relish Russian Imperial Stouts, search out and you will enjoy."
"22 ounce bottle from the Big Beer series. This is a big beer. A dark, dark black with a small coffee-colored head and some nice lacing. A strong coffee/chocolate odor. An espresso taste with some intense bitterness. As the beer warmed, the bitterness abated, and I could taste some fruit. A nice, robust beer. Cost effective,also. One bottle will do just fine."
"Very enjoyable and complex, but I think I may have cracked into this too soon. This is certainly one of those beers to hold on to for a rainy day. The 9.0% ABV is worth mentioning for its serious buzz quality in minimal time."
"A great brew, and a great Impy Stout."
"You could sit and sip several glasses of this in my opinion. It is an excellent interpretation and one of the better Smuttynose beers I've had. Good work, SN."
"Drinkability: Well, obviously not a session beer, a bomber in a sitting is doable for me and I'm quite a light weight. The alcohol interrupts the flow a little, but otherwise it's pretty gentle on the palate."
"Overall an almost great beer. Will be very interesting to see how it tastes after aging few years when the aggressive hops tone down. Definately has the potential to age wonderfully."
"Smuttynose continues to prove itself as the forerunner of big season beers. IMO, brewers from around the country should be on notice."
"Another solid brew from Smutty's Big Beer Series and I will be sure to pick up many more of this one before it disappears."
"Mouthfeel is full and slick. Drinkability is good for the style."
"I get these whenever I see them and enjoy! My top IS pick in bottles and of the Smutty big bottle series definitely a solid second favorite of my top three from them. Highly recommended."
"This is not easy to find in the midwest; so, drinkability is limited. I would like about 5 more bombers to mix with the other Imperials that I have in the cellar."
" Drinkalbity: the most drinkable stout i've had. i could see ordering several at a bar...but alas..this will be the last bottle untill i get another trip out east...."
"Smuttynose Imperial Stout doesn't cleave that closely to the RIS style guidelines, but it is unquestionably excellent beer, style Nazis be damned. If you like your stouts chocolate dominant, citrus hoppy and bursting with flavor, look no further. Make mine a Smutty!"
"2004 bottle courtesy of slander. Pours a murky black color with a slow erupting brown foamy head. Cap of fluff coats the inky liquid for a while leaving streaks and rings of lace decorating the glass. Big dark chocolate scents along with a great roastiness come on strong. Lighter dark ripe fruit notes are hiding in the background, very tasty smelling stuff. Taste starts off with a light fruitiness over some dark chocolate. Roasted malts and coffee are also in the mix. Sweet roasty malts linger for a bit. Full bodied and creamy. Ridiculously drinkable, I would have had a second bomber after this if it was available. A year didnt hurt it Im sure but I wonder what it would have been like fresh. Hopefully it will be released again soon."
"Drinkability: Less hoppy and intense than Stone RIS, judging by this aged example. Still, this is exquisitely smooth. When is the next version coming out?"
"Not what I've come to expect from Impy stouts, in overall complexity, mouthfeel, and taste....so just an average impy. A big beer that lacks big results."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed an uneven 3/4"" dark brown head above the dark brown/black brew. Head is somewhat resilient, but lacing is average to good for the style. Aroma is initially of dark grains, but quickly overtaken by a shot of dark fruits, and a flood of alcohol. Taste is mainly of the dark, sweet grains, with the slightest fruit tinge, and a warming parting blow from the alcohol. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A nice representation of the style. If you see it, you gotta try it."
"Pours a black with a nice fluffy dark tan head leaves spotty lacing. Aroma not up to par for a imperial stout, get light coffee aromas with pine hops and touch of citrus, more hops then roasted malt though. Taste is roasted malt lightly burnt some bitter coffee flavor with grapefruit hop flavor taking over, light chocolate taste pops up in the middle of everything. Overall not as complex as other imperials more hop sided, but not overlly bitter just the right amount of hops. Mouthfeel may be a little weak for a impy stout but not too bad. Drinkability easy to drink, just find myself wanting more in way of taste."
"Provided via a trade by BeerAdvocate ppoitras, this big beer series member came in a 22 oz. brown bomber. The beer pored just a shade brown of pitch black with a khaki head. The body was opaque with no highlights at the edges. The aroma was like a fine mocha espresso. The taste was dry and bitter, once again reminding me of a strong dark coffee. Very roasty and burnt with a hint of sourness, this beer was clearly not trying to appeal to those with a sweet tooth. The body was a bit thin for an imperial stout, and the alcohol was not quite up there. A couple of more percent ABV would have made this spectacular."
"Whoa this is 7.1% ABV? No way..."
"This is an excellent imperial stout. It is not a particularly unique interpretation of the style, it is just a classic representation of it. The nose contains Tootsie rolls, fudge, and a winey, port-like character. The taste contains much of the same, excpet the chocolate is much more bitter, very much like an 80% cocoa Belgian chocolate bar. There is also a quite-appealing wine-like character, so this comes across as if you were drinking fine tawny port with dark chocolate, except with a nice, creamy, carbonated mouthfeel. I think the alcohol is well-masked, so this makes for a decent session brew for an imperial stout. I don't know why, but I didn't think Smuttynose would excel at this style, but they have. Bravo."
"Ebony black with an initially thick tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, oats and light hops. Body is full and smooth with a low carbonation and a slight syrup feel. Flavor is of cocoa, espresso, bitter chocolate and roasted oats. A bit of a dry finish and not as sweet as some of my favorite Imperial Stouts. Has a lingering bitterness that I could do without. Overall a good brew but I prefer the sweeter higher abv Imperials."
"Very dark body with an OK head. The aroma is VERY roasty. The same follows into the flavor with just enough hops to back up the nice roasted malt backbone. This isnt an exciting Imperial Stout, its just a good beer. I could drink this one on a regular basis. A bit of chocolate rounds out the whole deal, but this isnt really much different than a typical good stout."
"Big and dark with that oh so nice tan head. I smelled lots of hoppy goodness lurking inside with that malty undertones. This beer probably would improve with age as the rough edges showed a bit but man the chocolate and tobacco flavours worked their brewing magic to make you slow down and sip slowly to savour the nuances. Very food friendly with big nasty cheeses, this is a well made big beer that can live comfortably in your cellar."
"22 ounce bottle. Other than the aroma, the alcohol does not rear it's head."
"Black in colour with a thick tan head. Creamy as it comes. Aroma of toffee, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The taste followed the smell with the toffee, chocolate and coffee but also with a bit of a hoppy bite. The alcohol is noticable, but, man is it good."
"Black as night as it pours into the glass. Nice tan head with plenty of staying power. Typical RIS aroma, bitter chocolate and roaste espresso with nice malt overtones and just a touch of hops. Taste is delicious, all of the elements in the smell with a smokiness that is quite appealing. A dead-on example of the style and something I'd drink on a regular basis without hesitation.."
"Thanks again to wyllder for this one!"
"Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel."
"Wyll-"
"The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly creamy at the start with a long mildly dry and partially crispy finish, where most of the flavor components rode the tongue for a while. A great brew and easily drinkable with the flavor and toned-back alcohol levels."
"Thanks again, to the ªth Bierman for this one!"
"As some have stated, this winds up being more of a port with its smoked qualities, than it does an Imperial Stout. Again, good and worth looking into, but somewhat off style."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. Pours a deep dark brown (very nearly black) with a thick dark brown head that dissipated slowly. Decent lacing throughout. The aroma raised my eyebrows it was so roasty, with lots of coffee present. Rich-bodied with a strong roasted character, with coffee, hops and a bit of chocolate in the flavor. It could use a little more sweetness for balance though. The finish is lightly bitter and retains the coffee flavor. Overall this is a good Imperial Stout that simply needs a little more depth to be top shelf stuff."
"Viscous"
"Me want more. This is a good one to seek out if you want fine examples of the Smutty line."
"Bomber bottle, pours black, dark tan head dissolves to a nice tiny bubble film and this one leaves nice lacing. Big and bold Imp stout. Nose of bready yeast and some dark malts. Flavor is burnt malt, black coffee, dark chocolate. dark rum. dry and chalky in the finish, this classy sipper is complex and warming. All stout lovers rejoice- this is a winner. Seek and enjoy."
"Pours with a grand, thick brown head with good lacing as it fades over very dark ruby-brown liquid. Fruity yeast and deep roasty barley grabs you right away, then fresh coffee notes appear. A rich depth of malt, roasty tones up front, alcohol and fresh piney hoppiness comes in behind. The finish is burnt malt, thick and tasty, fruity and warming. Very well done and highly recommended!"
"2004 Vintage - The Imp. stout poured jet black, and with a large - but vanishing - tan head. The aroma of chocolate, coffee, and alcohol was near perfect. Unfortunately, the flavors were a bit too acrid with the malt roasting taking too strong of a position. The coffee and chocolate notes were nice, but didn't form a complex sonata. All in all, though this was a well bodied and highly drinkable beer."
"Notes: Great beer. The flavors are super. Sourness and bitterness don't overtake the palate."
"Drinkability  Im a big fan of porters, this reminded me of a good porter. The bomber is a good size, you can take your time and enjoy it, its not an ale that youd want to chug with your buddies."
"I really like the full, dark flavor, but I do wish it lasted longer. Fruit and chocolate always pair well, as they do here, just not for very long. And yet, in spite of a rather premature finish, it comes across very well, and there's certainly no issues with finishing this bomber. And sure, it's there and gone, but that just means you take your next sip that much sooner, and there's something to be said for that, isn't there?"
"204"
"Bittersweet chocolate, espresso. A touch of orange & pine leads to a dry finish. Chocolate is left to linger as the throat warms slightly. Flavours of plum & raisin open up as it warms a bit. Medium-full bodied. Moderate carbonation when first poured, quickly becomes quite gentle. Another fine creation from Smuttynose."
"About as easy drinking as an imperial stout will ever get...very impressive."
"Very drinkable and tasty beer, but seems off style. Too hoppy, comes off more like a barleywine or strong ale, but I would surely have another."
"This Smuttynose ""Big Beer"" is everything that an excellent imperial stout should be. One of the better American examples of the style. Very highly recommended."
"Smooth jet black with a light vanilla-chocolate head. More carbonated than I expected, had a faint roasted malt nose. Great chocolateroasted malt sweet caramel flavor with a twinge of strong yeastiness, goes down smooth and begs for another round (with a 7.1 ABV this gets a ""danger"" rating,) not especially strong flavored but I think that adds to the drinkability. Good stuff."
"pours a thick liquid black colour with a bubbly yet pillowy chocolate milk-like head that leaves a sticky residue on the glass. really quite awesome looking. the smell is almost as good, giving hints of burnt wood, malt, chocolate, a touch of coffee and earth. the taste here goes from smooth to bitter rather quickly, but it's all good. starts with a semi-sweet coffee and toasted flavouring but quickly moves into a coffee taste for a bit then right into a bitter chocolate flavouring that finishes with a dry bite. smooth and easy drinking, this one is a nice first step for those moving into the imperial stout realm. while i've grown to like the style more and more, it's still not amongst my absolute favourites, but i enjoyed this offering from smutty because it was more subdued than most. it holds back in the coffee flavour dept, which is always a plus in my book. having not lived in boston for two years now, this one reminded me what a new england brew tastes like. i can't put my finger on what specifially the new england taste is, but this brew had it."
"Slight faint burnt coffee nose. Rich dense dark tan head with nice lacing on the glass. Black opeque look in the glass. Initial expresso blast of flavor then turns caramel and slight bitter cocoa. The finish is tastes of burnt bits of bread on the Bar-B-Q. Very thick full coating chewy mouth. A very solid Imperial stout other than a slight weak nose... it is wonderful."
"Poured from a 1 pint 6 oz bottle at a bit colder than room temp. Dark black with a small tan head. Oily looking, my kind of stout. The smell was of roasted malts and espresso also something reminiscent of a Sammy Smith Porter. The taste was pleasing. Dark cocoa, burnt coffee and espresso and burnt caramel. Very caramelized sugar flavors. Yet, not as sweet as some Imperials. The mouthfeel was heavy, and viscous. Drinkability was good, I drank the whole bottle in a sitting, so it must have been good. A nice solid Imperial, yet in some way lacking what the other premier Imperials of this day have. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was missing, perhaps it was just character. I'd take a Strom King or Old Rasputin over this."
"Maybe not the best imperial stout I've had, but pretty good, and entirely worthy of repeat visits!"
"Appearance: Dark roasts creat a dark ruby brown easy to call it black with out thinking twice, forms a thin moccha head leaves specks of lacing nice. Aroma: Dark chocolate, with a creamy edge on it big lucious coffee notes great stuff. Complex but at the same time not over the top one Imperial Stout that is very drinkable and stays true to the style. Taste: Full flavored chocolate cream nice touch of hops great brew, flavors blend together so nicely making this one of smoothest Imperial Stouts I have sampled in awhile. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied brew great even carbonation sticky texture nice brew. Drinkability: Incredible I would buy a case of this to sit on if I had the funds right now good all around stylistically accurate Imperial Stout."
"Nevertheless, Id say that this imperial stout falls short of the notable Imperials Ive tasted."
"Beef Notes: The tamest imperial stout EVER. This must be the imperial stout that all the other ones picked on when they were kids. Smutty has to find a way to intensify this brew; then, I might have another."
"dark and inviting pour with a medium head. deep aromas of coffee, spice and chocolate with pronouned phenolic aftertones. Warm and chewey mouthfeel that runs around the tongue and fills the voids with spicey alcohol notes, pretty well covered by malt and slight hop finish. This is a beer I would drink one after another n front of the fire, asuming I did n't have to get up for a while, or the next day. After Big IPA, the best Smutty I've had and one I 'll buy some more of to celler."
"This bottle has been in my cellar for about a year and it is perfect."
"I think this is the second imperial Stout I have had in the last two weeks ago, and I think I know why I don't drink them that often: They kick my butt! ;-) This cask was on at Redbones last night, and it was in great shape. Pour was pure opaque coal black. The head died quickly but it was a thin dark tan covering the top, with little darker clumps resting on top. A fresh hop aroma was streaming off the beer, I could smell the hops without having to bring the glass up to my face, a rare occurance. They were fresh, a mixture of pine and grass notes. For me, alcohol was the first thing I noticed about the taste, after that the hops take over. Lovely roasted note in the finish. Very tasty, but a big beer (at least to me). Good stuff, recommended, especially if you can find it in good shape as cask."
"Purchased Sept. '03 and consumed March '04"
"A bit thin to be an imperial stout, but a decent beer all the same. Still, not sure that I'd trade for another one. Thank you to mydeadguy for the trade!!"
"This beer is VERY dangerously drinkable..."
"This is one of the most impressive beers I have consumed in quite a long time. From the Big Beer series, pours an incredibly heavy black liquid with a sticky mocha head. The aroma is strongly of deep, sweet chocolate and hints of bold floral hop spice. The fist sip is like warm chocolate milk inconsistency. I cannot remember when I have had a beer so naturally creamy. The chocolate malt flavor screams at the palate with the perfect hop balance and a mellow bitterness. An awesome concoction."
"Im glad I had somebody split this with so we could compare our take on it. And so I could drive home. Its a sneaky Imperial that I plan to grab more of, if its available."
" I'm reminded of some of my favorite porters with this one. quite good."
"Beautiful, kick-butt stout. Almost black with a decent head that had a light chocolate color.Rich malty aroma that invites you to drink. Then...boom...taste is malty, coffee-flavored and alcoholic all at once. It literally explodes with flavors, then the alcohol leaves a pleasant dryness on the palate and the burnt malt flavor remains in an aftertaste that is very good. Mouthfeel is mostly crisp due to the alcohol, but the maltiness keeps it from going over the edge. Drinakbility (or should I say sippability is very good)"
"Taste: Light carbonation prickles the tongue, and settles into a round, creamy mouthfeel. Starts almost sweet. Sweetness is swept away by an astringent bitterness. Chocolate and coffee in the middle, with fresh, floral hops fighting for attention with slightly burnt coffee."
"This beer poured black with no light penetration and formed a dark brown foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate is present with a hint of raisins. The flavor malt, coffee and burnt chocolate. The finish is fairly light for this style with a touch of bitterness. Reminds me more of a chocolate porter than an imperial. So as imperials go, it is not the best representation, but overall, it is a good beer."
"Other reviewers have said that this is not a true imperial stout, and they have a point -- perhaps it is more like a chocolate porter on a very good day -- but this is a lovely beer, eminently drinkable, so very friendly to your tongue, and another winner from Smuttynose."
"Drinkability: Average. I'll go ahead and repeat myself again...this isn't anywhere near being an Imperial stout. It's more along the lines of a strong stout. Or maybe a sweet one, as the chocolate is the strongest flavor. Overall, not a bad brew, but terribly mislabeled..."
"This ""Big Beer Series"" is proof that BA and like beer lover groups are making an impression upon brewers and they are responding by digging out the top ingredients and notching up their brewing techniques in order to appease our ever growing thirst for excellent beer. This mild Imperial Stout is pitch black in color with a thin brown fading head and lots of sticky, patchy lace. Bitter chocolate, sweet malt, hop and mild alcohol aroma. A thick and rich chocolaty malt is nearly perfectly matched with sharp citrus bitterness and lightly astringent and pine-like flavors and light alcohol lung-feel. The creamy, almost oily liquid is quite luscious and very drinkable, although the intensity fades towards the end of the glass."
"Pours super dark, motor oil black, small-medium sized dark tan head which quickly diminishes, minimal lacing. Aroma has coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt to it, although it's not too strong (especially compared to some others in this style). Flavor is roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, and a slight burnt/smokiness that poked through at the end. Body is on the fuller side of medium, flavor lingers on with the bitter chocolate being last to leave."
"An absolute black hole of a body, no ruby highlights here. Big, thick, dentable kahki head, which eventually settles into a tabletop. Nose is primarily chocolate, which is never a bad thing (talk about combining vices). Some licorice and coffee buried down below. Taste is roasted malts with some coffee, a hint of chocolate and some late arriving herbal hops. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, appropriate of a pour that resembled motor oil. Drinkability is surprisingly easy, and desirable. This will require more than one bomber bottle next winter."
"This is a terrific imperial stout that is full of flavor. I found it to be a somewhat filling which took away a bit of its drinkability."
"This beer pours out of the bottle very dark almost black with a slight head that calms down quickly. It has a toasted smell of lightly burnt coffee and a similar taste with a touch of fruit(current). Mouth feel is very smooth, silky with little carbonation. I look forward to enjoying my next one as much as I did this one. A good beer!"
"This beer is a black hole. No light penetrates at all. Black as can be with as nice looking thick tan head.. The head almost looks reddish like many other imperial stouts.Smells of burnt coffee, some chocolate and ripe fruit.Taste and mouthfeel are topnotch. This brew feels like silk in my mouth. Chocolate up front with nice bitterness going down. That fruitiness is in there too. Suprisingly drinkable for an Imp stout. ."
"Pours out almost black with a very nice brown head. Tastes good. Not the best imperial around, but make no mistake, this is a good brew. Not enough in your face imperialism to make me as happy as I'd like. Tastes a touch of sweet with a good hunk of burnt and a bit of old fashoned hoppy goodness. Not enough quench to take more than one in a sitting."
"Overall an average to substandard Imperial Stout. Not enough malt profile coming through the black malt bitterness. Also no hint of hop bitterness to balance the malt."
"Cheers"
"This Imperial Stout poured jet black with good tan foam that left nice lace on the glass. The smell was very good: sweet, dark malt, and coffee aromas. The taste was good: sweet, malty, with coffee and licorice in the mix. The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied. The drinkability was good. A very fine effort."
"Have waited so long for their Black Cat Stout to be bottled, I decided to try this beer, though I knew it was a different blend. Very black with little or no head. Smooth, but not very robust. A good stout, but not the Black Cat I anticipiated it could be."
"Poured with little to no head.  Toasted wafer aroma.  Toasted flavor throughout, very mello and pleasant.  Not overwhelming (which is too bad).  Substantial underlying fruit notes, green apple and banana.  Alcohol is present but not a main attraction."
"There is no doubt about drinking an Imperial stout, and Smuttynose's has beef.  A dark, ebony colored stout with good flavor.  Brewed with 8 grains and 3 hops. ABV - 7.1%"
"Notes: This is too similar to a traditional porter in style and taste. At 7.1% abv, this turns out to be a delicious very strong porter or chocolate stout."
