4.5,-2.4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is an exceptional offering.  What a few days it has been for us!!  Yesterday we got to enjoy Firestone’s other coveted rarity, §ucaba, and less than twenty-four hours later, we have the supreme pleasure of tackling Parabola.  This pairing has really helped put the landscape of barreling into perspective for us, and have, in part, reestablished where the bar should sit.  From the moment you open the bottle the aroma is already settling into your nasal mucosa, even at a distance.  It highlights some of the most authentic and warming oaky butters we’ve experienced to date, effectively setting the stage for a decidedly serious beer.  With this in mind, the first sip takes you a bit by surprise.  There is so much cloying sweetness to it.  Thankfully, this is transient, and only serves to shock the palate before the real complexity of the flavor begins to settle in.  The final blend is intensely bittering, with primary contributions from the deeply burnt malt bill, the wood, and the booze.  It is simply succulent and wonderfully savory.  If you are going to force us to complain about one thing, it would be the feel.  It was by no means poor, but felt, at times, lacking in substance and creaminess compared to what you’d expect for the style, and for such a big beer.  As we watch the next winter storm creep towards us on the radar, we are thankfully for such a beer to keep us warm through the evening.

4.4,-4.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Got in a trade with cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled on 3/18/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness; with some light alcohol/booze. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Fair amount of roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A very slight oak astringency was present but not detrimental. Light-medium carbonation an full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged imperial stout. All around outstanding complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering as I expected.","superspak","Nov 13, 2014"

I would like to compare this to BCBS, but in truth they are quite different. This is a bit more roasty, bitter, and less sweet with surprisingly fruity flavors that balance out all the richness. I once did a side-by-side with a 2013 of each, and the BCBS was the clear winner, but there’s something really special about this 2014, so I might have to give it another shot ☺.","Tele","Sep 27, 2014"

Offers a spritzy carbonation which is more than expected given the light foam on the pour.  Rich and full in feel without being overbearing and a hint of vanilla on the finish.

4.7,2,4,4,5,5,5,"One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. Poured with a gorgeous, thick, luxurious head which left delicate lacing on my glass. The taste of slightly roasted cocoa nibs and mocha was so smooth I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Smooth, thick, rich, round, yet still clean and refreshing on the finish. I have never had a more perfect beer. I am so glad I have another, because I cannot wait to taste this with some age, I can't even fathom how it could be improved!","ToriBug13","Jul 20, 2014"

Taste is very strange. It is a heady beer but it is highly carbonated, and the carbonations tickles the tongue in a way that doesn't let you taste the high alcohol. Very strange feeling.

I thoroughly enjoyed the 2014 fresh. The flavors come out real well. Firestone makes ba beers that drink really well fresh which I appreciate although this is more balanced with zero alcohol presence. Fresh smells a lot better too. Overall a difficult beer to review because time changes this a lot for the better.","putonyourwalkingshoes","Jun 07, 2014"

That being said, I just didnt really care for this. I found it overwhelmingly sweet. My first sip I immediately get the bourbon, followed by chocolate. The oak and coffee begin to creep in after a couple of sips but sweetness is dominate. The mouth feel is a bit heavy for my preference, but not off-putting necessarily. I can appreciate the number of flavors and the balance of those flavors but this is just not for me. Kind of reminds me a little of a barley wine, maybe I'm way off on that, I dont know. I would say if you know you dont like this style but you are trying it because of the hype (like I did) then save your money and save the bottle for someone that will enjoy it.","HoppyDazed","May 30, 2014"

I'm speaking about a cold night on a porch. This isn't fair because I drank this 2014 Parabola on the edge of a wall next to a beautiful girl, feet in the bay, 7 beers deep (and then remembered I brought Parabola). Set and Setting, this was the best beer I've ever had. It is unreal. Its like this elixir, it has the same mouthfeel as homegrown mountain Dew. It is unbelievable, unbeatable, and it is firestone walker.","D-18V","May 29, 2014"

Once any type of food hits the palate, the booziness comes through in a BIG way and this will kick your ass. For SURE a sipping beer, not just for the $/mL but for the mouthfeel if nothing else.

4.98,8,5,5,5,4.75,5,"The beer was poured into a snifter glass and the first glance offered up one dark beauty of a beer. Mostly black with hints of brown on the edge when hit by the right lighting. No head to speak of just a slight mocha ring around the top and virtually no lacing as well. Smells of, well, bourbon. Some vanilla, aged oak, dark coffee, and some espresso also join in with the abundance of bourbon. Taste is great with the hints of the above mentioned with bourbon being the most pronounced flavor for me. Very well done mouthfeel that coats the palate and is very smooth. I found Parabola to be moderately sweet and extremely easy to drink, but a sipper with that high abv. I really enjoyed this aged stout tremendously and it was amazing to get a hold of this masterpiece . Highly recommended!","dpgoblejr","May 28, 2014"

Aromas are spilling out of this snifter from a good distance; this is a beast. Very rich molasses, vanilla, bourbon, woody notes, chocolate, and toffee notes provide huge layers on your sense of smell. Throughout the layers, you pick up hints of licorice, cream, cherry, tobacco, smoke and char. This smells great. Flavors are very rich, with a blast of char, bitter and roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and heavy booze notes. This is a blast on your palate. The more you drink, more flavor profiles reveal themselves, including tobacco, peat, earthy notes, and smoke. This is heavy. The body is robust, smooth, and full, like old motor oil, which is the perfect body to support this cavalcade of flavors. Rich, thickly sweet aftertaste of coffee, chocolate, and molasses, this remains heavy from start to finish. The finish is thick, smooth, and lingering. This beer keeps you on the ropes from the moment you open the bottle, and I personally loved every second of it.","GarthDanielson","May 18, 2014"

I pick up not only booze in the aroma but dark fruits like raisins, figs, plum(?), some bourbon and wood as well as a little sweetness. A very heavy, boozy beer that is great but definitely made sure I could only have one. Thick, not sticky but this is going to leave some beer remnants on your tongue, a little heat on the finish and this beer actually benefits from a woodiness to keep it flowing smooth. As for tastes I pick up the dark fruits which is still mostly figs and raisins and again I swear a hint of plum, possible black cherry, all combining with a vanilla-like bourbon sweetness that is wonderfully balanced.","clayrock81","May 18, 2014"

Taste is similarly sweet with some fruit- raisins and cherries- up front, and some milk chocolate that follows, with a touch of bitter chocolate at the end. Everything gets more intense as it warms. Carries the 14 % ABC very well. Mouthfeel is light but oily, leaves it's mark, but with a nice carbonation. Very similar to BCBS coffee in taste.

I normally drink pretty quickly, so this was unprecedented. I'll be aging my remaining bottles to see if time can mellow the booziness and the bourbon, allowing the subtler elements and deeply buried characteristics to shine. Nonetheless this was a highly impressive beer which is either a little rough around the ages or as yet still raw. Time will tell.","abeeronthebeach","Apr 20, 2014"

Aroma was roasty (borderline burnt smell), picked up on the alcohol and bourbon. Flavor was really potent and bitter. It was thin and didn't leave any lace. Very strong bourbon aftertaste. This was part of a 4 beer sampler (all barrel aged) and I would say it came in 3rd. Definitely not bad and worth a try.","BVukelich","Feb 07, 2014"

I picked up lots of dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon on the nose. It was one of those beers that I just couldn't stop smelling it between sips. The flavor of the beer lived up to and perhaps even exceeded its incredible scent. The taste made me think of a slightly undercooked dark chocolate fudge caramel brownie a la mode with vanilla bean bourbon ice cream. There were also some notes of roasted coffee beans. Its rich and decadent flavors were a perfect match for its smooth, velvety, creamy mouthfeel. I thought that the 13% ABV was rather well-disguised for the style. An absolute pleasure to drink in every way possible. Insanely delicious. 2013 Parabola is definitely an all-timer for me. Firestone Walker has blown me away yet again with their barrel-aged releases.","lmperialChad","Feb 04, 2014"

I almost trembled as I brought the glass to my nose, but the reward was remarkable. Licorice and chocolate dominate both the nose and the palate, but the taste is literally intoxicating. Upon the palate, the bourbon chocolate is phenomenally drawing and absorbing, warm and inviting, and consistently sensual. Mere words cannot possibly describe just how innocently lustful this brew envelops the senses. Both the nose and the mouthfeel expression are intoxicating. Pure rapture in a bottle. I so stunned that I cannot possibly do justice to the experience, except to say that when you get here you will understand what I mean. Pure nirvana...","JohnParadee","Jan 24, 2014"

However, at 13% abv that is somewhat expected, and for me it didn't detract too much away from the enjoy-ability of the beer. At the front there is a dark chocolate bitterness with some coffee and booze, and on the back end it gets a lot smoother and creamier. Definitely can get the bourbon notes from the beer as well which comes across with nice molasses flavor and slight vanilla. Overall, if you don't mind booze in a beer( which lightens as it warms up) then this beer is a great choice. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness, and its definitely a must try.

4.24,-8,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Agree with many of the observations of Stevedore here. It is not particularly thick, moderately carbonated. Owing perhaps to the predominance of the bourbon on the palate, it is lacking the alegasmic ""fudginess"" of Baudoinia (or even the 2012 BCBS I sampled on tap last weekend). It is not as creamy or smooth as Black Note. Way too much bourbon, even at 2+ years.","StoutItOutLoud","Nov 16, 2013"

Scents of oak, coconut, bourbon, faint coffee hints of alcohol and a bit of sweetness. Very nice, definitely an oak aged RIS, rich and boozy. I love it. Flavor starts with roast malt, black coffee, oak, bourbon and sweet malt, with very faint hints of alcohol. The finish brings forth bittersweet cocoa, sweet chocolate and alcohol that carry into the aftertaste. Very good. Deep and strong in flavor, with all the notes of barrel aging and a good RIS as well. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a smooth feeling and a slight hint of alcohol burn. Very easy to drink, hiding the 13% ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent RIS. It's got the nice barrel aged quality and the core strengths of the style to carry it and it is just plain wonderful to drink.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2013"

With some time though, my guess is this taste would mellow out allowing some of the other flavors to come through. Overall though, this beer was fantastic as it has a great bourbon smell and taste to help compliment the imperial stout characteristics that are there behind the bourbon.","mjpolzin","Nov 03, 2013"

This is amazing stuff, no doubt, but after pitting it in a bourbon barrel stout blind tasting some time ago, this didn't even make the top. Very sweet compared to other offerings of its kind, but perhaps the best one that's easy to get. Gets a lot of those bourbon sweet oak notes that I find a little difficult to wade through. This is best fresh - once it loses that roasted character, it gets a little too putrid, herbal, and sweet. Still, phenomenal stuff, but let's not forget to be objective even about our favorite beers.","magictacosinus","Oct 21, 2013"

It showcases the bourbon, but not as well as a beer like Central Waters' Fifteen does.. but then again this is a shelf beer! I guess that ""showcasing bourbon"" thing is not enough to impress me these days.. plenty of BA stouts do a good job of that already. I just would like the base beer to stand out more in these types of beers. Otherwise, you might as well splash some bourbon in a non-BA stout. That being said, it's a good example of a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout so don't let my opinion prevent you from trying this beer. It's certainly worth drinking anytime.","Stevedore","Aug 22, 2013"

The only beer that arguably surpasses it that I know of in this category is Goose Island's Bourbon County (which I think has the edge in terms of a viscous ""motor-oil"" quality). Clearly, Firestone is at the top of their game here, and this version is probably even better than the prior two years.... I think this version has a little extra sweetness that takes some edge off the bourbon.","UpToMeBeer","Aug 20, 2013"

Didn’t realize it was 13% and we each had just about a pint of this black/stout/wine/alcohol. Laughing at the fact we might get the spins and throw up. This beer left a distinctive reminder in the morning that it was BIG. Strong alcohol/stout/cherry aroma and the flavor followed the nose well. I was schmammered afterwards.","SDbrewerJake","Jun 20, 2013"

We opened the bottle and let it settle for about 5 minutes before we enjoyed. The stout just hits you with so much flavor all at once...I got hints of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee and a bit of heaven. Definitely give this beer a 5 minute cool down, I think if you drink it too cold you could miss some of the flavor. This beer definitely escalated the awesomeness of stout to the next level. I give this beer a lampshade-hat rating of 9.25. Cheers to Firestone Walker for a great beer!","Rob_pbr81","Jun 06, 2013"

Smell is lots of bourbon and oak, chocolate, some licorice,some marshmallow. Taste is loaded with dark bitter cocoa, some sweet vanilla, marshmallow, tons of hot bourbon and oak, slightly smokey, nice citra hop caricature (kidding) . The texture is silky smooth. Overall this is very very good. Loaded with complex but distinct flavors. Boozy but Devine. I'm so glad I got to try this and can't wait to see how this ages.","brewtus","Jun 04, 2013"

While there's plenty of boozy character, it's not nearly that of Sucaba, or perhaps there's enough bold stout flavor to counteract the barrel-aged influence. Either way, this is pretty good. I've purchased a 2nd bottle for aging. If it's phenomenal 18-24 months from now, you better believe I'll be on here giving it praise!","TheSixthRing","May 15, 2013"

I wish these guys could figure out a natural additive that would make the head hang out a bit longer in these high ABV barrel aged stouts. The aromas were intense which is always a good thing but along with the rich bourbon, chocolate, slight vanilla, smoked caramel, berry medley and oak was the very apparent scent of alcohol. A renowned beer is great because the alcohol is invisible and you can really get into it. This one it is dead center and you enter with a state of mind that speaks moderation which is not good. The flavor was an alcoholic punch to the mouth that left a very nutty aftertaste that coated my mouth for a long time afterwards which was very good. Awesome in fact. I wish the dynamic of flavor profiles was a smooth transition. All the greatness is there but it should be a bit friendlier. The chocolate, vanilla, roasty, dark fruit notes are very distinguishable and enjoyable once you jump the alcohol hurdle.","tastyville","May 07, 2013"

The complexity of flavors and mixture between the oaky bourbon and the more traditional RIS flavors like chocolatey malts are really fantastic.

That's good but more would be better. A bit thicker, a bit richer, maybe some more black malt char to stiffen it. A bit of coffee or something else. Never had it fresh so not sure how it compares. I really like the alcohol level. Nice and warm. It's almost liqueur-like in sweetness and strength. I would definitely buy it again if I had local access but would not trade for it again. At the end of the bottle I'll say this is a beer that made me work and made me think and improved over the course of the bottle, which is saying something.","BrownNut","Feb 25, 2013"

Aroma of black chocolate with some light vanilla notes and some light dry roasted malt. Taste is dominated by loads of black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt and some vanilla and light bourbon notes. Taste is definitely quite complex and not as dry as expected with quite a bit of residual sugar coming through. Body is full with a really nice creamy texture and some good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I can’t find many fault in this beer except that that bourbon could bit a bit more pronounced.","Phyl21ca","Feb 21, 2013"

Not a bad brew by any means, but I'm just not thrilled about the spicy notes of this(similar to what I thought about that element in Sucaba)although it does lend to the complexity. This is also a little boozy on the back end of the drink. Aside from that, Firestone Walker makes a lot of good beer and I will continue to imbibe, I just personally like their IPAs better.","PsilohsaiBiN","Jan 25, 2013"

4.69,1.7,4.75,4.5,5,4.25,4.5,"2011 vintage in a trade. Poured on 1/22/13. Pours deep black with no light let in. Aggressive-ish pour left with a tiny brown head. Aroma is very strong vanilla, molasses, chocolate, licorice, and of course plenty of bourbon. Really beautiful. Thick an viscous mouthfeel opens up to Very mellow bourbon tones, lots of vanilla, and a burst of chocolate on the finish. Mild carbonation that is right on for this. Incredibly mellow, and I am curioud is that is the age or the uncanny craft of FW. Prickle of alcohol burn on the tongue, and a nice bit of warmth on the way down. Probably a new favorite BA Stout for me. Just right.","BMMillsy","Jan 22, 2013"

The beer concludes with a gentle bitter edge, though I'd never have guessed anywhere close to the DIPA-worthy 82 IBUs the label claims. A little bit of treacle / bitter molasses in the end. For an imperial stout this beer is just super mellow; the barrel aging and oak flavors do it really well. Oh, except for the heavy alcohol of course. For a stout there really aren't a lot of roasty, nutty, chocolate or coffee flavors, either. But there are layers of bourbon, fruit and brandy","hreb","Jan 21, 2013"

Yeah, it's a big American double stout and it looks the part, black as night with a big-bubbled tan froth that builds fast before falling to a thin cap under the heft of the 12.5% ethyl alcohol. Again, it's a powerful American stout and we all know what the best taste like (and this is one of the best) - rich espresso, raw cocoa, burnt sugars, toffee, and a punch of herbal hoppiness all layered with a smooth bourbon whiskey flavor on top of an oak foundation. Smoooth. The barrel aging has rounded out the rough spots and left the alcohol nigh undetectable. Firestone Walker brews excellent beer and this is no exception.","bump8628","Jan 20, 2013"

4.27,-7.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours jet black with a razor thin tan head that settles down to a halo around the edges. As expected, the nose is bourbony, but its 12.5% abv is well masked. Notes of chocolate & coconut fight against slightly metallic notes of bourbon. It's definitely a bold elixir that drinks smoothly. The initial sweetness followed by much more bitterness (82 IBUs!) than I originally expected. It reminds me of wookey jack except with a lot more bourbon and booziness. The mouthfeel is bold and full bodied and despite spending 12 months in a barrel... there is ample carbonation. The aftertaste is a lingering vanilla bitterness that is possibly to bitter for its own good as the contrast overpowers the rich smoothness and drinkability I've come to expect in a good RIS. Regardless, this beer is damn good, but I must admit that I've had some that are better.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 16, 2012"

Aroma is big, rich, smooth chocolates and caramels with a nice, roast and mocha backing. The bourbon and oak provides a solid addition without over-powering the big malt backing. Touches of vanilla, raisins, and a light alcohol hint. Flavor is similar. Rich, bittersweet dark chocolates up front with a good amount of roasts and caramel. The oak comes on with a lighter bourbon note as well as touches of vanilla, raisin, and licorice. Mocha, tobacco, and a bit more bourbon grows towards the end as this finishes rich, roasty, slightly ashy, and sweet with a nice bourbon warmth and dry oakiness. Lengthy aftertaste following a very smooth, mouth coating, full body and a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a very big, bold, rich, well balanced imperial stout with a solid barrel aged character. Not the most complex, but such a nice body and really enjoyable all-around.","Samichlaus82","Oct 24, 2012"

Smell is vanilla, chocolate, expresso, bourbon, and some molasses extraordinary. Taste is lots of vanilla and expresso up front, with some smoke and bourbon towards the finish, really huge flavors and every sip is as intense as the first. Body is medium large, perfect amount of life for the style, dry as you would expect from the style, and very drinkable for a big beer, that should be savored sip after sip. I have 4 more of these and am so happy about it. This is one of the finest BA Imperial Stouts on the planet. Firestone does it once again!","SawDog505","Jul 31, 2012"

The bourbon is masked by an almost grain alcohol character, and the rest of the flavor profile is dominated by the bitter qualities.  I would like to try an aged one to see how it develops, but the fresh one is rather meh.  No where near the level of many other big RIS's I've enjoyed, and also no where near as enjoyable as Sucaba.  ","zac16125","Jun 22, 2012"

After one whiff I knew this was something special. I instantly picked up on sweet cherries that are nicely balanced by smokey oak and vanilla. Taste up front is of dark chocolate, bourbon, sweet raisin, dates and cherry. This gave way to the notes of burnt coffee, oats and roasted malt. I picked up on a bit of liquorice and several other flavors that my palate just couldn't identify. The bitterness and light carbonation in this stout is perfect. The brew felt thick and the booziness really warms is it goes down. Overall this beer is powerful, complex and excellent. I'll be aging another bottle to crack on a cold winter's day several years in the future.","Beerevity","Jun 17, 2012"

Firestone Walker, in my opinion, has the absolute best barrel program in the country right now. Beers like Parabola, PNC, and Sucaba all show the barrel aging dominance that is Firestone Walker.

Has some nice characteristics to it that work well. But this thing is rated up there with other beers that I've had that really made an impression. This one does not do that so much.

The alcohol is hidden very well and I get chocolates and bourbon. The beer is sweet and delicious. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have ever had.

4.5,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown, with a brown-tan, quickly attenuating head. Aromas of sorghum, coconut, chocolate, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, with some scrubbing on the back of the tongue at the finish. Milk chocolate, coconut, and unflavored leaf tobacco are prevalent and alternating flavors. There is even that mild pang in the back of the jaw that occassionally occurs with dry leaf, unflavored chewing tobacco. Notes of sorghum and bourbon as well. This is my favorite FW brew. It's a phenomenal concoction.","DocJitsu","Apr 28, 2012"

As noted above this beer has excellent olfactory and palate play, but I think the mouthfeel takes away from the excellence of the beer. I also think this beer has such dominent wood character, that this would benefit from a year or two laying down to help it all come together. Granted, I think the malts would eventually turn this one really, really sweet, so it could be a delicate balance. Great beer for an oily, slow-burning, dark cigar. Or some pipe tobacco. Mostly would want the smoke in the air, not to actually take in as it would interfere rather than compliment the beer. 4/4.5/4/3/4 - 4.0","harrymel","Apr 05, 2012"

Its not as rich, sweet or boozy and the mouthfeel is thinner. But it is less hot and more integrated out of the gate. Whereas I can see BCBS aging well for at least 5 years, with Parabola I am not sure if any time in the cellar would be beneficial.

Poured pitch black with a half finger light tan head that subsided to basically none fairly quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, wood, and greatness. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, milk chocolate, and dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fantastic brew. How in the Hell have I never tried this before!? The aromas and flavors in this brew are ridiculously good and very well balanced. When I saw that it weighed in at 13% I was afraid this one would pound me in the face with alcohol, but that was not the case. Allowing this one to sit in my cellar all this time has definitely worked its magic to subdue the alcohol. Absolutely a must try if you have not done so before.

4.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Jet, jet black and pours like motor oil. Very thin, fine head of bubbles across the top. Deep rich and roasted aroma. Rather boozey but in a good way. Really reeks of bourbon. Just a big old hunk of rich roasted and bourbon flavor. I was not expecting it to be this rich. Nothing wrong with that though. Vanilla, oak and some sherry notes. Dark chocolate and expresso all over the place as well. Sharp bite from the booze, though it almsot comes as a kick off the barrel aging process, not the beer itself. Thick and syrupy rich body. A touch of an acrid burn but that's definately part of the whole body. A total complete desset beer. I could not finish this is one sitting and am enjoying it again a 2nd day. I have a bottle from last year to enjoy. Will stay a want for sure. Killer beer all in.","lackenhauser","Jan 15, 2012"

I very much like the way the 13% abv edges have been smoothed out and the Bourbon flavors have become integrated into the beer. Definitely noticeable Bourbon notes, but it doesn't dominate the beer, and it's become oh so smooth. Pours inky black and viscous with a thin brown rim of a head and some legs on the glass. Nice aromas that present as a seamless whole- outstanding notes of licorice, vanilla, bourbon, and molasses. The taste is even better- really nice bourbon notes coupled beautifully with roasted notes, dark chocolate, licorice, and a slight woodiness than underlines the beer. Wonderful stuff. Absolutely silky in the mouth, with the sense of having swallowed some excellent drinking chocolate laced with good quality whiskey. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait.","Georgiabeer","Dec 20, 2011"

4.72,2.4,4,4.5,5,4,5,"batch 002. split with mr. cloeren, crack! and immediately the aroma shows its face, 22 oz bottle poured into duvel tulips. gives a pitch black liquid of midnight madness producing a half finger of a soft khaki head, tight bubbles remain for a while covering their tracks as they slowly fall. sweet bourbon straight to the head through the nose with vanilla, barrel characteristics and molasses. before i took the first sip many thoughts were racing through my head that i did not want to be disappointed more so than ever. parabola walked the walk son! the taste is even better perfect balance amongst bourbon, vanilla bean and molasses with appropriate supporting roasted malt and hints of chocolate in the back. complex and layerd to absolute, as it flows and rolls on the palate and finishes it is nothing but absolute silk to my surprise for the age (< 1yr in the bottle). the only flaw for me was that i thought it could of been slightly heavier, perhaps im wrong. it would be easy to drink every drop of this in a sitting. overall this beer was absoultely divine and i could not be happier that i have more. for myself bourbon, vanilla and molasses are my favorite characteristics for stouts and FW nailed it.","JayAre46","Nov 29, 2011"

4.34,-5.9,4,5,4,4,4.5,"No. 002, 2011. Black with just the faintest of dark brown edges. Brown, soapy bubbles formed a collar while extremely fine bubbles coated the surface of the beer. Decent head retention with a bit of spotty lacing that wasn't too sticky. Bourbon was evident as soon as the cap was popped. Boozy aroma with vanilla and oak apparent, notes of toffee and coconut, roast and chocolate, faint licorice and figs. Great texture, full without being heavy, moderate carbonation that provided an airy mouthfeel, a bit of astringency from the kilned grains and wood, slightly sticky. Alcohol started warm and ended a little hotter, but still well controlled. Nice depth of bitterness, both from hops and the dark grains. This worked well with the considerable malt presence, toffee and chocolate sweetness, roast and light licorice. Quite oaky as well, vanilla throughout, with plenty of bourbon character. Unfortunately, the prominence of the wood and bourbon in the flavour seemed to mask some of the complexity present in the aroma. Overall, a very strong offering from a great brewery.","DrJay","Nov 26, 2011"

The smell of the beer was roasted and sweet, some aromas of wood and sweet bourbon on the nose. The taste of the beer is just stunning... I really couldn't believe how nice this tasted. The sweet bourbon flavors come out perfectly in this brew. The mouthfeel of this beer was thick and oily just like it should be. Overall this brew is special.

4.22,-8.5,4.5,5,4,3.5,4,"O: Well, hrm. I had huge expectations of this beer, based on my opinion of Firestone Walker, the reputation it has, and the price tag. I'm also unfairly judging it against Abyss, which I consider the best beer I've ever had (which is a substantial statement). That said, this beer disappointed a bit. A good beer? Yeah. It didn't blow me away. At $14 I expected a bit more - I understand production costs, especially on aged beers. The nose implied a much better palate, but it was a bit of a letdown, lots of hot alcohol, a bitter strange finish that wasn't as satisfying.","PainkeepBrewing","Nov 09, 2011"

4.15,-10,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"2011 vintage courtesy of BrewerB, thanks Brian! This beer pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger dark kahki head. It smells of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, sweet vanilla, toffee and creamed coffee. It tastes of bitter chocolates, coffee with cream, a lot of oak, and bourbon. It's a pretty well integrated blend. It drinks very smoothly and isn't as viscous as a lot of imperial stouts. It's overly drinkable for the style and pretty approachable. The bourbon is there but kind of mellow. If I were to not pick I'd say it could he stronger but its not a big deal. Overall this is a fine beer and definitely worth trying. Kudos to FW for making this so available.","aasher","Nov 09, 2011"
3.35,-27.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D: I paid $16, which is a fair price for a stout of this caliber. I would go no higher, though. I think some of the tannic and bitter flavors could stand to be toned down a bit, but I'm sure if I wait a few months the beer will hit its sweet spot for me. Right now it's not in the top-tier of barrel-aged stouts, but it's just on the cusp.","Arbitrator","Nov 05, 2011"
4.32,-6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: My first time time trying this beer and I like it.

4.7,2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is just about as black as black can get. No light gets through this one. Has a minimal brown head, if you can even call it that. Its more of a thin blanket that recedes to the sides of the glass. It leaves minimal, spotted lacing down the glass. The aroma on this one is amazing. A very strong vanilla presence, chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, and a nice touch of bourbon booziness. It smells sweeter and sweeter as it warms up as well. On to the taste test. Just as the nose described, really heavy tones of vanilla, bitter chocolate, coffee, oak, and booze. The boozy taste is by no means in the way. Its the perfect complement to the rich sweetness. Taste is just phenomenal and very complex, all of the flavors just seem to meld with each other perfectly. It has a very rich, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. Just phenomenal. I was very excited to try this, and very glad to say that this exceeds its hype. Being someone that is fairly new to BA Imperial Stouts, they are quickly becoming my new favorite style. Cheers.","BrewtifulMind","Nov 04, 2011"

I understand that new, interesting flavors are the goal, but sometimes they can expose the tastebuds to an unpleasant palate.

4.6,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Tremendous stout! Served on tap and poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a rich opaque black with a lovely chocolate brown head, nearly a finger of it, which receded a bit during the session and left just a bit of soapy lacing behind. Luscious aroma of rich bittersweet chocolate, with notes of bitter coffee and a touch of vanilla and bourbon. All these qualities followed through in an excellent way on the palate, with the smooth, rich chocolate taking the foreground, both in the front and the finish, with a good balance of coffee bitterness mid-palate. Alcohol warmth definitely present, but barely boozy at all in the taste. Woody with subtle oak tones, and just a hint of dark fruits: cherries and figs. Full-bodied, rich, and quite the amazing drink overall.","Rifugium","Oct 24, 2011"

While not quite as complex or unique as FW14, I think I prefer this beer.

Perhaps some citrusy hops are coming through. Some notes of dark fruit, coffee, and bourbon on the finish. What a beer. FW is truly an excellent brewery.","chalsk","Oct 18, 2011"

To those of you who have a fresh bottle, I would definitely advise you to cellar it for at least a year.

4.25,-7.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"22oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a frothy, half inch, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose expresses bourbon, licorice, burnt sugar, a hint of vanilla and ethanol. This beer is a major malt bomb. There's quite a bit of char happening in the flavor profile and the alcohol is a little caustic - it definitely lets you know it's there. Bourbon and vanilla resurface towards the back once the alcohol dissipates and a suggestion of toffee also reveals itself in the mix. The mouthfeel on this beer is exceptional. Body is medium in consistency with an oily, slightly viscous quality and there's also some residual alcohol burn that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Carbonation is very pleasant; not too assertive, yet not still. Overall, I found this beer quite enjoyable, albeit a little hot. That said, I'm glad I tried it fresh because I'd definitely like to see how this one develops over time. I think it has great cellaring potential and in my opinion, will only improve with age.","Jwale73","Sep 23, 2011"

It has barrel aged but really it reminds me more of non-barrel aged Russian imperials. All that said for the 25th best beer in the world, I’m a bit unimpressed.

Big and bold, great stout flavors, doesn't overpower with roasted malts or briny scorched malts, and doesn't overpower with booze or sweetness but definitely lets you know it has both. The oak, wood, and vanilla help round it some, but the bourbon is just an afterthought compared to the big malts, chocolate, and other big flavors. The nice creamy and lucious feel are great. And then when the big earthy spicy hops kick in it really brings it up to hype level of awesomeness. Can't wait to see how it ages.","jlindros","Aug 14, 2011"

4.38,-5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Have you ever had bourbon county or bourbon barrel aged Old Rasputin? Well, this beer tastes like it's in between the two.

Chocolate and coffee, roasted dark malts, boozey bourbon and plum/raisin/cherry from the barrels. There is a definite alcohol finish that burns a little at your throat but it doesn't bother my palette because of the numerous flavors still lingering.

Big on roasted malt, chocolate, bitter malt and paired with brilliant barrel aging - bourbon, oak, vanilla and char without being over the top. The finish is chocolatey, ashy and dry, not sweet or cloying in anyway. Nice and thick, but a little hot on the end.

Taste is mostly bourbon, followed by a sweet malt, chocolate, then comes the vanilla, and then slammed with more bourbon. Everything seems kind of meshed together though. Not layered very well. Burning in my nose from the bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Bourbon burns my cheeks. Kind of a funny finish on this. Overall, this dude is way too hot. It just tastes messy to me. It's good, but not what I was expecting at all. Very underwhelming from the reputation, and the rating, IMO. This was hard to get, and I've had better beers that are easier for me to get.

Wow this one has some residual sugars that's for sure. Taste starts out with licorice and chocolate but they are assaulted with bourbon, vanilla and oak very quickly. Coffee and chocolate step in but disappear as the whole thing turns into an oddly dry finish. Long lingering alcohol heat and earthy hop bite rolled in roasted grains.

4.22,-8.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Another big Want brought forth thanks to this BIF. Good times. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, very light oak, vanilla, and caramel. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, light vanilla, very light coffee, and an even lighter touch of char. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda chewy feel. Overall, a great impy stout, one that seems to warrant the hype it receives. Get some.","TMoney2591","Jul 25, 2011"
4.77,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I stalked the forums on this site for weeks and was lucky to grab a bottle at Hawthornes in the one day or so before it sold out. This beer poured black with a thin tan head. The aroma was of bourbon and oak, with notes of vanilla. The taste was a mix of notes of whiskey, brandy, raisons, and vanilla along with with some hop bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was creamy and relatively light considering it's a 13% RIS. There's definitely a lot going on with this beer so it's better to sip it slow so you don't miss anything. This was a phenomenal beer and was worth all the effort it took to get it, and also worth the $21 I spent on the bottle. At this point, I'll try anything that this brewery puts out.","jonvan04","Jul 24, 2011"
4.52,-2,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Parabola pours an impenetrable black. The dark caramel head ends up at three fingers of height. The foam shows good staying power, but lacing is a bit on the light side. The nose is very good, but not great for a barrel aged stout. Sweet milk chocolate with a vanilla base is the predominant aroma, but there are also background notes of coffee and a smooth bourbon presence. That set the expectations for an above average beer, but the flavor profile blows right past that en route to legendary. The entirety of the nose is present, and in addition, caramel, cherries, and marshmallow can be appreciated on any given sip. There's so much going on with this beer that not everything gets to shine through each time I raise my glass, but it's all here and it's all delicious. The body is as rich and full as I could possibly want, with carbonation that just cuts through the sweetness and preserves the beer's malty nature. I'm not sure that I'm ready to declare Parabola my favorite barrel aged stout (hi Bourbon County Vanilla, Rare), but if it's not it's surely in the pantheon of great beers, and more proof that no one is consistently brewing big beers to the quality the Firestone Walker is","axeman9182","Jul 24, 2011"

The bourbon soaked wood hits you... and burns you. It's not as balanced of a beer as KBS flavorwise and a little too hot with the bourbon. I feel myself wanting more dark chocolate, better quality coffee flavors, and less bourbon and oak. Hints of Madagascar Vanilla bean shine on the palate, but the smell of Parabola is better than the taste for me.","aficionado","Jul 23, 2011"

I have to say that I was unimpressed with the smell. I tend to like the molassesey smelling stouts. Once I took a taste of it my opinion quickly changed. This is one fantastic tasting stout. I really liked the after burn in your throat you get about a minute after drinking it. It tastes of strong coffee, and dark chocolate. It has an after taste of bourbon to it. I have been eating a Chocolate Crisp Bar, bought at Aldis, with each stout that I drink to see if it brings out the chocolate taste. I can say that this one goes great with a piece of chocolate when you drink it. This one has been the tastiest by far.","Gritch","Jul 21, 2011"

4.42,-4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. The smell of this beer is very complex with toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is the same as the nose with more of a cocoa powder flavor coming through than milk chocolate. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with very complex smells and flavors. Some of the smells and flavors remind me a lot of Abacus which I can only assume is from the barrel aging program both beers went through. I am glad I have a few more of these in my cellar to enjoy in the future.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 19, 2011"

It is big and luscious with a hint of roastiness. There are notes form the barrel aging with some vanilla and oak. The flavor is a bit boozier from what I've have liked it to be, but nice regardless. Flavor also picks up chocolate and perhaps some caramel with a big dose of coffee, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and alcohol. It isn’t ultra-complex at first, but then as you drink more and more of it subtle flavors come out. The warm alcohol sensation is a bit cloying. A solid imperial stout from a fantastic brewery nonetheless!","CuriousMonk","Jul 18, 2011"
4.35,-5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: A very interesting beer that really aims high.

The barrel presence has mellowed without losing its bourbon bite, but the base beer has taken on an absolutely gorgeous, mellow dark fruit sweetness that complements the chocolate notes very well - it is, in many ways, quite akin to BCBS. This is drinking so well, and I am updating my score accordingly.","amphion1065","Jul 14, 2011"

Flavor is more complex, lending some more bourbon than the smell as well as hints of chocolate and fruit. I feel like there is another liquor working here, but having trouble picking it up. A hint of smokiness as well. Slight burn from the alcohol here. Lighter mouthfeel than I prefer, but still acceptable. Overall, another unique interpretation by Firestone Walker here. It’s not your standard barrel aged stout. The complexity of the flavors keeps me guessing some.","Blanco","Jul 10, 2011"

4.23,-8.2,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"Batch 002. Pours pitch black with a very light cocoa head. The nose is chocolate, roasted malts, oak and a touch of booze. The taste is sweet vanilla, bourbon and oak, melded together against a dry chocolate and charred roasted malts. Also, just a touch of licorice. Comes together very nicely, but the finish is a bit dry and overly bitter, with a bit much in the way of oak tannins. It brings out an excess in the charred malt / chocolate flavor. This is really my only problem with it. Really fantastic mouthfeel - silky and full on the tongue. The barrel and the medium-low carbonation just round the mouthfeel out to smooth, smooth, smooth. Overall, this is a really good beer, particularly when it warms - the anise flavor blooms a touch more and some of the dryness and bitterness in the finish mellows. I think a few months might really bring this beer around. Once again, FW does some fantastic work with a barrel.","seeswo","Jun 24, 2011"

A very faint vinous character emerges as the beer warms. Smooth and silky on the tounge, Parabola is a boozy sipper that will benifit from some age.","baconsausage","Jun 24, 2011"

It remains a dessert beer throughout, featuring truly deep chocolates with a fancy alcohol pairing. Many in the style come off savory, even starting out in the realm of salty meats; but I would emphatically say that this beer came off as dessert even when a bit cold. The rolling flavors fought for my attention, and I tried to quell their excitement so that they all could be heard, ""One at a time, not all at once!"". This is a deep brew. It's like the first time you watch Mulholland Drive: You don't know what just happened, but you know that it was good. Would drink again, tomorrow or years later.

The main detractor (for me, at least) is the booziness, at 13% I'd expect it to be coming through somewhat less, actually.

On the the beer...from a batch 1 bottle. Pours black in the glass with a small brown head. Aroma was molasses, roasted grains, chocolate, hot bourbon. Really pronounced flavors, a lot of that molasses I got with dark chocolate, maybe some raisins. As a BA stout it's all right, not my favorite. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Kind of messy and really sweet overall. I guess this would fall into the ""over rated"" camp in my book.","kayalla","Jun 08, 2011"

I did a lot of leg work to track down bottles of this in the greater San Diego area. Firestone seems to spread our limited release allotment pretty thin, but I was glad to pick up several of these.

Considering the look, scent, and flavour, I would have expected something richer and thicker--and I would have preferred it for being such, even if it was following others of the same style. It seemed a little thin, and I found that it slipped down my throat quite quickly, leaving some alcohol burn that is slightly disappointing. Fortunately, the other elements of the beer make up for it. As for drinkability, it's got a pretty high ABV. It's an evening sipper or 'end-of-the-day' type brew--best slow and steady to finish the day up.","Proteus93","Jun 03, 2011"

I'm not a fan of drinking a stout that tastes like someone slipped a shot of Bourbon in it. If I wanted that much Bourbon flavor, I'd just drink Bourbon. But this beer finds a wonderful middle ground between Bourbon and the other barrels used and it really just compliments what I can imagine the base beer being.

However, overall, this is still not a beer I would seek out or trade my first born for. It's a very good beer...and I'm curious to see how it will drink with a year on it. It is still too hot to me right now. It leaves a slightly unpleasant boozy aftertaste that I'm not fond of. Luckily, I have another one, so I think I will sit on that for a while.

The coffee/espresso flavor is deep and roasty but is not stale, burnt or acrid tastng at all and doesn't overpower the other flavors. Again, I'm picking up a good amount of smokiness/tobacco flavor that I'm really loving. All of these flavors are bouncing off of one another resulting in an incredibly complex, delicious beer. Each sip brings something new and although there is some nice heat and burn in the finish, the ABV at 13% is very well masked. Very quaffable and tackling the whole bomber was no problem for me.

Hints of vanilla, tobacco, espresso and dark chocolate make every sip a pleasure to the nose. This is one big beer! The taste is huge and complex. As in the nose, the bourbon and oak are the stars. The balance is perfect with just enought bitter hops to offset the sweet malts. Dark chocolate, vanilla, roasty coffee, oak and lots of bourbon only get better as this warms. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth as silk. And although this is a huge sipper of a beer, it was extremely drinkable. I had read complaints about the size of the bottle being too big for one person, but I was totally enjoying every drop and never felt overwhelmed. The alcohol is warming but not overpowering.

Cocoa powder and coconut was also experienced and not integrated. This is above average body, it was finishable, I owed it to the brewers.

4.33,-6.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Drinkability: This isn't a ""mature"" brew - that is, it's not well-aged, mellowed, subtle, or moderate. Instead, it's young, intense, bold, and extreme ... it's just youthfully, intensely, boldly, and extremely balanced. And if this brew were as bold in the aroma as it is in the mouth, you'd have yourself an easy world class brew here. As it stands, it's excellent, and the 13% doesn't manifest itself anywhere other than the bourbon warmth and spice (where it's desired) and, well, the manner in which I'm beginning to type and collect thoughts. So I'll wrap this up by saying: 1) this beer should be released again; 2) this beer should be a component of everyone FW Anniversary beer unless and until FW puts out a better one (aside: when are we getting Abacus? Bueller? Bueller?); and 3) if you haven't tried this beer and can get ahold of it, do so. You won't be disappointed.","CrellMoset","Dec 27, 2010"

I smell vanilla and dark fruits blended in harmony, some drier, perhaps malt notes of the roasted persuasion. The first sip has a burst of warmth from the alcohol and finished with and oily aftertaste. There's a distinct whiskey flavor, too. The malt is trying to push its way through the bigger flavors and seems to work, just enough to be noticed. There;s some dark fruit flavors that give way to the roasted malt flavors. There's some vanilla sneaking around as well. Very cream mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep things moving. I'm trying to decide whether or not this alcohol flavor is something from the barrel or the fact that it's 13%. Knowing the barrel aged beers that I've had from the brewery in the past I'm going to guess it's from the barrel. This is a diverse beer. Definitely a good one to spend time with. I'm not sure if aging this will do any good. It's very smooth for a beer this size. I'd give this beer some time and see how the malt character changes.

The bourbon and the chocolate flavors mesh beautiful alongside oat grains, a little coffee roasty character, vanilla from the barrel and seems to have cocoa nib accents. I gotta say its pretty hot and probably could do well with time. The brew was full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, boozy, silky, and chewy finish; pretty damn thick.

On the nose I am picking up on strong fig, lots of bourbon, vanilla and a nice oakiness that gives way to booze and more booze. Taste is right along the lines of the nose, in addition to a really pleasant presence of thick caramel; chocolate covered toffee, cane sugar and toasted grains. The mouth feel is medium to heavy, at times almost seeming to be too much at once. The moderate amount of carbonation helps the drinkability. A good beer overall.

4.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Palate is hit instantly with a sharp, carbonated, and semi-boozy bourbon note that suggests dark bread, vanilla, and cocoa. Mid-sip is when the magic of Parabola takes effect, laying down layer upon layer of decadent Baker's chocolate, oak tannins, fig & plum fruitiness, and earthen hops. The alcohol provides warmth to the palate, but never becomes too hot or solvent-like. Mouthfeel is a velvety, viscous treat. Perfect carbonation and consistency that never gets heavy or taxing to the tongue. All in all, a flat-out fantastic brew. Glad I chose this one as review Numero 1K, it was well worth it. For me, Parabola is easily in the top tier of Imperial Stouts, and, for that matter, any beer in general.","wagenvolks","Jul 28, 2010"

The smell and taste paralleled near perfection with bold aromas/flavors of cocoa nibbs, oak, bourbon, coffee or espresso, and some alcohol. Really, this is a great stout by what matters to me the most: taste and smell. The feel was good. It wasn't frothy, but oily. Some may prefer the oily feel in a stout. An oily feel is just not my preference, but it was still good. I opened this one for mine and my girlfriends anniversary and I could not finish it. I was too full. It is a heavy beer and would be best split over a meal or partially consumed before the meal. I was really disappointed to waste about 1 3rd of such a landmark beer.","JosephLondon","Jul 28, 2010"

Not overpowering, but the presence is known. The taste is really nice. Maple and bitter cocoa really dominate the pallet. This finish very nicely and lingers on the tounge.

4.52,-2,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Minimal head and dissipation, resulting in a very thin layer of head around the edge of the glass. Dark dark brown body no visible carbonation due to hue. The nose is pretty winy due to barrel aging with a lot of bittersweet chocolate aromas. Taste is huge hit of chocolate upfront, with oaky and winy notes, and significant hop bitterness on back end but kept in balance by significant malt bill, caramel, and the pervasive chocolate with a wee bit of coffee present. Mouthfeel is medium full, just a bit sticky, and a surprisingly dry finish given the chocolate notes. Pretty boozy effects drinkability, a sipper to be sure, this could certainly benefit from some cellaring. This is one very tasty beer, worthy of the buzz it has generated, wish I'd had grabbed a bottle at By the Bottle in Vancouver WA, as I am sure this is harder than hell to come by now.","jdense","Jul 19, 2010"
3.82,-17.1,4,4.5,4,2,3.5,"Flavor is deeply roasted malt, sweet, and some hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is nearly the same as the anniversary beers. For a stout, this is considered watery. It feels more like a porter which I find to be the major fault in the beer. Other wise this is an extremely well balanced and flavorful stout. The barrel aging does not seem to take a huge role in this though. I'd be interested to so if this could stand on it's own without the barrel aging.","BearsOnAcid","Jul 18, 2010"

4.55,-1.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"At cellar temperature, I'm astounded by how hoppy this beer is. There's a lot of English hop character here, with a fairly high bitterness and leafy character noticeable. In addition, this batch has a lot more licorice character than I remember the first batch having, with a mild anise-like spiciness. Dark honey, a moderate bourbon character with vanilla and toasted coconut. The stout base is pretty nice too, with unsweetened baker's chocolate, molasses and licorice. The palate has all of the flavors the nose would suggest in a nice balance. Hoppy bitterness is strong on the finish, melding with the coconut and vanilla as well as some grainy bitterness. Moderately sweet as well, this has some dark caramel and candy sweetness on the mid-palate. A little less fudge-like and with more licorice and anise than I remember the first bottled batch having, this is an excellent stout.

When holding my nose into the glass, I get a nice amount of bourbon blended very well with chocolate, oak, and vanilla. The taste is huge on this thing! This beer is very rich and creamy with amazing complexity. I just get all sorts of flavors that make my palate very happy. The strongest flavors would be the chocolate and vanilla, followed very nearby by the wood and bourbon. I also get some great espresso notes and sweet candy sugar. Amazing taste. The mouthfeel is very rich and thick. This beer is definitely a dessert in itself. For how rich it is, I'm very surprised by the fairly high drinkability.

Great synthesis of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, vanilla, and a tiny alcohol bite that is lower than would be expected after the nose. Pretty dry finish considering the body is medium thick.

There's a slight fruity, vinous quality to it as well, enhanced by a light tannic astringency. Barrel aging makes its presence known without overwhelming the complexities of the base beer, which has not always been the case in past iterations of this beer; this is clearly the most balanced batch of Parabola yet out of those I've tried. It has a hefty, chewy texture with a firm lingering roasted bitterness that clings to the tongue after a few sips and doesn't let go. Sweetness is reserved, at a perfect balance with the bitterness and tannins. The more I drink this, the more impressed I am. I've tried several batches of this beer over the years, some aged entirely in bourbon barrels, others in rye whiskey barrels, some a blend of different components. This one really nails it; the balance, nuance and delicacy make it my favorite batch yet. Thankfully, it's the one we finally got in bottles.","largadeer","Jun 07, 2010"

Tastes like chocolate and burnt marshmallow, light char and a slight bitterness on the tail end. The alcohol warms just right and collaborates with the flavors decadently. Mouthfeel is perfect and the alcohol is sneaking up. I can see why there is so much hype on this beer.","youradhere","May 23, 2010"
4.57,-0.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"City Beer Store, Parabola release party. Two incredible barrel-aged beers from Firestone Walker in one night. Parabola pours a wall-to-wall black with a great brown head, thick and creamy. The aroma is complex and wonderful. Bourbon and oak are probably the strongest notes, but they don't dominate quite as much as in Parabola. There's a ton of dark chocolate, a healthy dose of roasted malt and a touch of vanilla. Brown sugar, molasses and caramel round it out. The flavor is all barrel-aged imperial stout goodness. All of those roasty sugars did their magic in the barrel, changing and blending with the barrel notes. It's not exactly sweet, but there are plenty of sugars present. There's definitely no unpleasant cloying sensation, despite its viscous feel. The finish gives a mild hop bite. This is a wonderful imperial stout.","popery","May 22, 2010"

4.33,-6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this on tap at the anniversary of Bailey's Taproom in summer of 2009. The colour was black with some caramel coloured edges. The aroma was brimming with toffee, dark chocolate and burnt caramel. On the palate, there was little CO2, but no matter as there was such a viscous character that CO2 seemed trivial. Loads of dark chocolate, coffee, treacle, toffee, caramel, molasses and I think a hint of lust and greed just for good measure.","slaintemhor","Nov 30, 2009"

4.3,-6.7,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Draught at The Blue Palms. Black with a small tan head. Smooth deeply roasted malt and bourbon aroma. The flavor is an integrated blend of dark chocolate cake, caramel, vanilla, and light bourbon. The wood shows lightly but the overall barrel character is very integrated into the whole presentation of the beer, and the heat from the bourbon doesn't approach the richness of the malt. Thick with a silky texture. Probably the best bourbon-aged stout that I've had. The aging adds lots of complexity without drowning out the base beer. Firestone Walker needs to quite wasting all of this in the anniversary blends and bottle it as a separate release.","bulletrain76","Jun 10, 2009"
4.55,-1.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured black with a light brown head that dissipated quickly, but expected given the ABV. Aromas were rich with hints of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, bourbon, booze, vanilla, oak. Tastes were full and rich also - bold roasted malts, dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toasty grain. Mouth-feel was thick, smooth, and creamy - excellent! Finished with a hint of pepper as the dark chocolate lingers on the palate with the bourbon and vanilla. I had no clue this was 13% ABV while drinking it, and would recommend this to anyone who can get their hands on it! Excellent treat to have this one on tap!","barnzy78","Jun 06, 2009"

4.83,4.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"On-Tap at Toronado. Snifter glass. Dark black with a bloody red brown head of foam and excellent espresso khaki lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, oak, whiskey, roasted malts, and green hops. Taste is syrupy sweet and than bitter with a lovely roast/hop combo and just the right sugary sweetness of chocolate coffee and bitter espresso at the end. Mouthfeel is chewy, thick, viscous, and warm on the finish. Drinkability is very good as well. A killer in the RIS or ADIS style categories. I can't wait for the FW12 and I am blessed that I have had this at least ten different times in the city over the past two years. FW has become one of the best breweries in all of NorCal.

4.65,0.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an insanely dark and evil looking black, very inky, no light gets through this one, very thick brown head forms, drops an insane amount of lacing, perfect retention, thick layer and ring until the glass is empty. This is about as perfect as a stout looks. Smell is insane as well, oak, toffee, chocolate, lots of licorice, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, very caramelized, alcohol, big hit of roast, very complex and layered, dark fruits up the ass, figs, it goes on and on. Taste is oaky vanilla up front, nice wood character, brown sugar, chocolate milk, roast, alcohol, licorice, molasses, some fruit, more roast, nice balanced roasty bitterness in the finish, this stuff is dangerous. Mouthfeel is pretty fulled bodied and thick, low carbonation, some warmth but you certainly don't get the 13%.
