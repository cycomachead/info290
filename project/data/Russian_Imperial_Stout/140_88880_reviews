"Poured in a snifter. Dark black but not quite as pitch black as other imperial stouts. Nice mocha colored head that settles. Nice aroma with solid but not overpowering bourbon. I think I pick up a pleasant hop aroma buried in there as well. Flavors of roasted malts, coffee, bourbon and even a hint of hop bitterness smoothed out with the bourbon and alcohol. One of the most well-balanced bourbon-barrel aged stouts I've had. I still put the Bourbon County Coffee and regular stout ahead, but this one might top the rest (including KBS) for me. Tough call there. Anyways this is truly well done."

"Overall,  a fantastic beer and one worth getting your hands on if you can and very well suited for a winter release. Highly recommend."

"Awesome look and feel. Feels pretty special for a beer when you open it. Great bottle."
""
""
""
"You can see the viscosity as it pours like crude. Pitch black. It looses some credit with the smell, singularly dominated by the bourbon prescience, though still fantastic. Strong bourbon, dark roast malt, hint of caramel, dark chocolate, a bit boozy. Full body, velvety, medium carb. Bourbon and dark malt aftertaste."

"Not a huge fan of BA beers but this one is good. Hints of vanilla and spice, it is strong! Delicious"
""
"Good malt and hops. I think it is barrel aged. It tastes a bit barrel aged. The hops are good. Carbonation is good for the style. Colour is pretty black I think. Compared to some other beers you could definitely say it was black. What a beer! I have tasted 2 beers so far and this one is the best."

"O- a very bourbon forward stout, which suites my tastes.  I'm already a fan of Narwhal, and this is just a better version"
"Poured into snifter. Thick, dark, opaque with medium tan head. Nice lacing.   Look is very appealing.  Nice smell featuring coffee, vanilla, toffee, and dark fruit.  You can also smell the bourbon but it isn't overpowering. Great mouth feel, viscous and chewy.  This is a delicious stout.  I'm partial to dark fruit and this didn't disappoint.  You can also taste the sweetness of the vanilla.  The bourbon then hits the palate.  Overall, this is one of the best imperial stouts I've had.  I'll definitely have it again and will serve it to guests."

"One of my top 5 BA beers"
""
"This a really interesting beer. Had at the Sierra Nevada Torpedo Room in Berkeley, CA in their tasting snifter glass. Poured, it's appearance is dark! Even holding it up to the light, there is pretty much no light that comes through. The smell is sweet with some alcohol, as expected with a 12.4% abv. The first sip and you feel like you are having some dessert. I tasted some chocolate, vanilla, and maybe even some bacon. It is a stout, so there was definitely the malty flavor. Very interesting beer to taste and want to try it poured over a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
""
""
"Smooth silkiness here influenced by the barrel, tones down the hops and malt and replaces with chocolate and espresso.  Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very clean and balanced - 2 traits I come to expect from SN. With such a big bold style thats hard to pull off and keep it interesting - this did it for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer. Very good. Not great though. First row of the second tier. Compared to the greats not enough depth, and a thinner mouthfeel. Balance is this beer's biggest asset. Unfortunately, this is an extreme category."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a pretty good beer it doesn't really bring anything new to the table but it's pretty solid "
""
""
""
""
"Roasty, dark chocolate, charred wood, bourbon barrel, vanilla and coconut flavors. The nose is a bit more subdued and the body typical for the style. This is a good base beer for barrel aging and the overall product a good one. However, I would not pay $20 for another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as good as Brooklyn Black Ops. No party compared to the regular Sierra Nevada Norwhal. Still good but not worth the $20"
""
""
""
""
"Overall you gotta love SNBC and what they can pull off.  I find it pretty incredible they have managed to get a small quantity brew out across the country.  This was definitely an improvement on an a solid base beer.  Thanks to Kyle at Liquor Express for posting on the AZCBL page on FB after I thought this brew was long gone!"
""
""
""
"Will not seek out or purchase again. Would not drink again either, even if offered."
""
""
"This is exaclty what i thought it would be, nothing short of amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the word that keeps coming to mind here is “big”.  From that first whiff of authentic Kentucky bourbon, to the rumbly warmth and robustness of flavor, to topping out the feel with such creamy, milkshake frothiness, this is an intensely satisfying beer.  Even when compared to many classic, standard Russian imperial stouts, its booze and strength to each aspect are remarkable and clear.  You love that the alcohol is so spicy and hot, just for the sake of how fantastic it tastes, and how well it blends to the rest of what’s going on here.  It does beautiful justice to its base Narwhal, while expanding its universe.  It’s like Narwhal’s favorite grandfather; mystically wise and amazing to hang out with."
""
"O - More barrel character/complexities would be nice but this is pretty damn good as is. Super smooth with pretty decadent flavors, tasty and drinkable. Definitely a different beast (pun intended) from the original."
""
""
"Luscious and well balanced. It feels like the barrel and the base beer are truly on in the same. Complex and mellowed out barrel takes some of the edge off the bitter roasted base beer."
""
"An excellent barrel aged imperial stout.  Nice woody notes with heavy vanilla. Prefect balance of bourbon to the base beer. Definitely going to seek out more"
""
""
""
""
"O-its pricey but very well done loved the BA on the base stout"
""
""
""
""
""

"Drink- Just a great stout. Creamy, layered and flavorful. As mentioned above the overall beer is quite delicious and I wish I wouldve bought another one."

"Fantastic offering from SN. Lots of bourbon but reasonably balanced. Its a wee bit hot but fantastic as it warms up (aka when the booze kicks in)"
""
""
""
""
"Much better than regular Narwhal and a damn fine bourbon barrel stout. The flavors weren't quite as complex as I'd like so I can't say it was as good as some other huge stouts that are out there."

"Overall: A fine Stout that outlies the norms of Barrel Aged varieties."
""
"If only there were something exactly like this available in smaller portions or lower ABV so I wouldn't have to plan an entire day around drinking one."
""
""
""
""
"In 2015, you really have to come with more than this to be a top BA Stout. Compared to many offerings, the bourbon character is very lacking. While very smooth, it is also very sweet and somewhat thin. I think this is very good, but kind of overrated"
""
"Overall, I'm not sure this is any improvement over the regular Narwhal, which I like a lot. But there's a lot of Bourbon flavor to like. From the 750 ml bottle purchased for 21 bucks at Beer Revolution in Oakland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A hefty price, but damn well worth it.  Thanks, Dan Stein, for fishing this one out from behind the counter.  I love me some Narwhal and this one elevates the legend even more."
"Low B-"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very enjoyable beer. Excellent bourbon smell and flavor. A bit hot, and the body was a little bit more thing than I would have liked. Taste and smell are true to the Russian Imperial Stout backbone. I would drink it again, but it doesn't quite hold up to other barrel aged stouts."
""
"Black as midnight with a chocolate head,aromas of choc mint, dark fruits and an ever prescence of bourbon, full lush feel, taste is a mocha bomb with bourbon and raisins and finishs wiyh a lingering warmth, well worth a taste and will age well cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a wonderful beer that serves as a nice comparison to standard Narwhal."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious, but it's almost all barrel."
""
"VERY underwhelmed by this one. Bourbon aroma and flavor was lacking for me. I like more of a bourbon presence. Also found it to be very thin for an imperial stout with an ABV like this. I really like thick drinking stouts. Disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this was way too hot; needs time to settle in.  good color and feel just did not do what other top end BA stouts have done for me"
"Recommendation: Probably tough to find at this point, but seek one out if you can. World-class beer right here."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, what a great beer Ken Grossman and his collegues made, rich and full taste. One of the highlights during a tasting with friends."

"we are approaching perfect with this one, and beer rarely ever does for me. this is extraordinary, and absolutely delicious. i am amazed how the barrel mellows the base beer, but how the unique flavors of narwhal come through the bourbon is incredible, not covered up by whiskey but enhanced by it. there has always been a little vanilla finish to the base beer, and that really comes out on the nose of this one, along with bakers chocolate, melting fudge, honey, and vibrant oak. there is the vanilla and chocolate complexion in the flavor too, but theres also a whole lot more, the coffee notes of the malt, and a burning dessert bread sort of thing, followed by moderate raw sweetness and just a tickle of alcohol. i do get a little coconut when i look for it, but there is a different kind of nuttiness here, more of an almond thing, almost creamy with the earthy side, works so well with the heavy bourbon flavors the beer finishes with. texture is amazing too, viscous but not syrupy, palate coating but not teeth rotting, and hearty but not filling, its a mix of sensations not usually associated with the style. this may well be my favorite barrel aged stout right now, and is certainly the beer of 2015 for me here in the early going. wow, go find this one and open it immediately, no need for cellaring at all its ready to rip!"
"Pours a deep black color with an wonderful one finger head of caramel colored fuzz that sticks to the glass. Aroma is that of vanilla and oak, with a nice smokey note. Taste follows the nose well. The bourbon is prominent with the sweet vanilla. There is a chocolaty aspect hidden in there, and it warms quite well in the end with a strong alcohol presence. Feel is creamy and thick, carbonation is spot on. This beer is extremely well balanced and an absolute pleasure to drink. I do think I like the regular version a little better, I'm not completely convinced it needs the barrel aged aspect, but this beer is definitely worth trying."
""
""
"The feel is just a bit thin an  provides a significant heat but it's an easy supper and a beautiful ale."
"Mouthfeel is  thick, but not too thick. Not still, but not effervescent. Very nice. Overall, I like it a lot...but I like bourbon barrel aged stouts, so that's a bit of a giveaway."
""
""
"O - A substantial improvement over regular Narwhal, which I already liked. Removes all brashness and brings flavors into perfect balance."
"Pretty good beer. Not my favorite ba stout. Pours dark but not opaque. Not quite as thick and dark as I would have hoped. Slick mouthfeel but could be a little bit thicker. Perfect amount of carbonation. Tastes good and comes through with a big bourbon flavor. Not too boozy even at such a high ABV. Overall a decent ba stout."
""
""
"As I am not or should I say can't handled barrel beers very well. I will mix with a good fresh IPA to finish the bottle. A very good beer."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber I've had aging for awhile."
""
""
""
"It's fantastic, great nose, excellent balance and high enough alcohol to further the enjoyment.  I actually like this a bit better than BCBS, but that's just me. It feels higher on the ABV than 12.9%, but I'm not complaining!"
""
"My rating: 4.25"

"A lot of breweries make bourbon barrel aged stouts. Not many make them this delightful. This is another beautiful beer from Sierra Nevada. It reminds me a lot of Bell's Black Note Stout, only with a slightly thinner feel and a bit better nose. Pricey at about $20 per bottle, but very high quality. Buy with confidence."
""
""
""
""
""
"750ml bottle purchased for $17.49. Looks like a standard Narwhal and even has a pretty good head for a high ABv barrel aged beer. Aroma is a nice subtle hint of whiskey, booze, barrel, and chocolate. Flavor is also mild chocolate and whiskey. This is actually really good and I liked it better on the second bottle I had about a month after release. I think this is a nice take on the base beer and does improve upon it."
""
"pretty tasty. Can't say it's a whole better than Narwhal, and for 22$/bottle vs. 9.99$/4-pack, I'd have to stick with Narwhal. Had the BA Maple stout last nght, and I enjoyed that more."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured black from corked bottle with one finger of mocha-colored head. Aromas were bourbon, vanilla and chocolate and quite pleasant. Lots of great flavor with each sip, starting with bourbon and a hint of bittersweet chocolate followed by a nice vanilla backbone and a tinge of oak on the finish. Dry finish; slightly drier than I prefer, but not unpleasant. Carbonation was nicely done and feel was medium-bodied. Overall, this was a very enjoyable barrel-aged stout to relax and enjoy. Highly recommend."
""
"Overall, lives up to the billing. Excellent vanilla flavor from the onset that transitions nicely into a bourbon taste and roasted chocolate finish. Only thing from stopping it from being a 5 is the diminished dark fruits are lacking."
""
"Meh. Don't feel like writing a full review."
""
"Bottom Line: Very good beer."
"Chocolate - vanilla - roastieness. - barrel aged goodness. This is outstanding. I looked for this beer for a month and finally found it on New Year's Eve. The price point of 22.99 was crazy but I'm sure they would have got a buyer at some point. What do they care right. Beer wasn't worth the price, but I'm glad I had a chance to try it. All great in every category."
"Overall: incredible beer, complex strong and sticky"
"Thanks to Kyle for sharing this bottle during college football playoff. Pours pitch black with a very slight tan head. Smell is toasted coconut, liquorice, coffee, and lots of bourbon and vanilla. The taste follows the nose and the roasted malts and peppery finish perfectly balance the coconut vanilla sweetness. I wouldn't mind a thicker mouth feel, but overall this is a great barrel aged stout."
""
""
""
""
""

"All the flavors are in place, but the heat from the barrel is very noticeable. May need some time to mellow."

"O -  A very pleasant BA stout.  It takes the already great Narwhal to the next level.  I recommend it if you can find it."
""
""
""
"Intense and complex Imperial Stout with lots of vanilla, oak, bourbon, coffee and coconut. It is a long sipper, but not cloying at all despite its high alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hardly any bourbon, no Narwhal trademarks (cocoa and licorice). Woody, roasty, thin body with some alcohol heat. A decent stout, but horrible execution of a BBA stout. I'd even take Anderson Valley BBA Stout over this. Pass."
"I associate Sierra Nevada with great value for good beer, but this barrel-aged version of Narwhal is a truly great beer. Compares very favorably with the likes of Bourbon County Brand Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Lace is left behind in spots.  Tightly beaded miniature bubbles, no loss of carbonation through the barrel.  The aroma has wood, bourbon, vanilla, charcoal and chocolate.  In the taste, the whiskey is evident, cocoa and mocha like flavor also.  More complexities than standard Narwhal.  Vanilla and alcoholic flavor develops as it warms.  Full bodied, smooth, intense lingering flavor. A strong beer for strong beer drinkers.  Slightly hot, may mellow with a bit more age, but it has already aged a bit now.  A barreling project gone right."
""
""
"750 ml Bottle.Poured into 12 oz glass jet black in color.Smell is Bourbon and Chocolate with a touch of Coffee.Taste is quite an assault on your taste buds with the Bourbon up front and the Chocolate and coffee in the background.At first drink it was hard to handle but I did get used to it an it is pretty good.But for the money{18.99} I would probably stick to the regular Narwhal which is also pretty good.Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad my friend shared this one with me, i would hate to pay the $20 price tag, but it's totally worth it if you have the money to spare. Made me into a believer."
"This hits my price limit, approaching 20 bucks. But I think this is one of the few worth the extra money. It has a great presentation and potential longevity, yet is accessible any time you want to open one."
""
""
""
"O: A delicious BA stout. Quite hot and surprisingly light/carbonated, not quite at the level of BCBS, but still a great holiday treat."
""
"Unbelievably smooth for a BA stout. Seek this out"

"This was good, but could benefit from more time in the barrel."
"My first go at the BA Narwhal as its hard to come by in Hawaii and have to say I'm thoroughly impressed. Gonna have to pick up another one to cellar."
"O:  Good.  Not my favorite bourbon barrel aged stout.  For me, the hoppiness distracts from the heavy, toasty barrel qualities that I look for in these monster brews."
""
"I just see them as two great examples of two different styles of beer, One a very nice bold IS type coffee stout, and the other a great dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black, thin head that quickly fell.  Smells of booze, bourbon, some vanilla.  Taste is of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and some coconut with a definite alcohol burn on the way down.  Medium body and light carb makes this pretty drinkable, but the 12.9% abv keeps it a sipper.  Overall, I like this and the flavors are there, I wish I would've sat on it for about 6 months longer to let the alcohol burn mellow out a little, maybe as it warms up, it will smooth out a little.  Would recommend though.."

"Tasted earlier this year while in SFO"
""
"An excellent beer.  The normal Sierra hops bitterness is noticeable early in a cold pour, but mellows out into a flavorful, smooth and silky beer that I will have to grab more of."
"This was a hot mess the non BA is much better"
"This packs a Ton of Bourbon heat and almost stings in nostrils if you inhale too deep through the nose. Had to let this warm up and mellow out for a good 20 minutes before all the scents and flavors presented themselves. Caramel, Cream, Nugget are most predominate with some char, coffee, and chocolate on the back end. While its an awesome beer and I really appreciate what barrel aging has added to the base beer I believe I'd always choose a 4 pack of Narwhal before throwing another $20+ on this BA version"
"Really enjoyable BA stout from Sierra Nevada.  Takes Narwhal up a notch.  Picked up the bourbon, but not in excess.  Tasted some chocolate notes, and roasted flavors as well.  Very well done.  Would recommend."
""
""
""
"Hopefully, since I do have another one, I will let it cellar age, the carbonation die down a bit and the body pick up a notch"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark beer with a nice thin layer of tan head. Smell was faint but of slight bourbon and oak. Good amount of carbonation giving a nice mouthfeel. Nice smooth taste with notes of bourbon, oak, and a hint of vanilla. Overall a nice smooth beer with great balance in flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is no question a GREAT one.  I certainly wouldn't let it sit on a table and not drink it, regardless of circumstances.  That being said - it is not in the same class as the other world-class BA stouts that we all love, even though it has a similar price tag."
""
""
""
""
"O- The only glaring issue with this beer is the ~$20/bottle price point. That aside (and like BCBS), this is another example of a perfectly executed BBA Imperial Stout. Although I personally like the whiskey characteristics to resemble more of a sweet bourbon (in that regards, I'll give a nod to BCBS), BBA Narwhal's overall complexity in aroma/flavor give it immense personality, allowing it to stand proudly on its own to garner many a bragging right. (4.75)"
""
""
""
""
"If you find this brew, buy it!"
""
""
""
""
"Lots of roast chocolate balanced by the barrel.  No lack of bitterness or wood, but still nice and malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a wonderful treatment of the original Narwhal. Everything is amped up, but oh so smooth and integrated. You get all the chocolate, caramel, and vanilla notes from the barrel and the whiskey, but no overwhelming hit of the spirit. Beautifully done!"
"Out of this work cocoa, great dessert"
""
""
""
"I would have enjoyed stronger bourbon notes.  I also don't like using the word ""notes""."
""
"Delicious.  Much better than I expected."
"It pours a little hot, but not noticeable after the first or second drink. A considerably better beer than the BA Bigfoot, which was somewhat disappointing. If you can trade for this within reason, it's worth it, however for the 20 I spent, I'd of rather spent the extra five to get Mother of All Storms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn. This is how barrel aged stouts should be. It's mildly hot, but not enough to damper the ride. Nice woody boozy tones. Smooth stout flavors with a nicely robust edge. Great beer. Could deal with a lot more of this Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A friend picked this up for me from the brewery.  An aggressive pour yields a one finger beige head that fades quickly with a pitch black body and nice lacing.  The nose is earthy and roasty with a ton of bourbon along with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, oak, vanilla, and toffee.  The taste is roasty and boozey with nice chocolate fudge notes up front along with hints of bourbon, oak, cocoa, espresso, vanilla, subtle dark fruit, and leather.  The mouthfeel is moderately thick and mouth-coating but velvety smooth with very little warming or burn considering the ABV and boozieness. Overall, Narwhal is a great beer, but this BA version is world class.  Bold and flavorful without being hot and boozey.  Highly recommended!"

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a fair amount better than the base beer. The relatively high bitterness of regular Narwhal is subdued and transformed by the barrel characteristics. Despite the high price of this bottle, it is a relative value at the per ounce level."

"Solid opaque black color with a decent sized tan head that has some retention and lace. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, light brown sugar, oak with a hint of bourbon and vanilla and just a hint too much cardboard. The flavor is big roasty chocolate with hints of caramel vanilla and oak. Light dark fruitiness with a pleasant warming alcohol that lasts long into the finish. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a silky creamy mouthfeel. Nice sipper, I enjoyed it for a couple of hours. I would have liked a bit less cardboard especially with the enormous price tag this bottle came with. Nice to try but I probably would pass on this in the future."

"O: Fantastic beer from Sierra Nevada! Wish the aroma was a bit stronger, and I think it's a little hot. I think after another year or two on this it will be incredible!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Initial reaction, it's real good. Toasted coconut, vanilla, milk chocolate and some bourbon alcohol heat. Not too boozy. On the thin side, but enough sweetness to balance out the hop/roasted presence."

"O- About what I expected from the barrel-aged version of Narwhal, which is an exceptional RIS."
"O:  very good, immensely better than regular narwhal 4.25"
""
"O - I'm a big fan of Narwhal, but oh how I wish the Bourbon Barrel aged version is a yearly release from now on. BA Narwhal oozes quality with good old fashioned imperial stout style with new age bourbon barrel goodness. This is as good as any bba imperial stout as you'll find and well worth it's price. This is proof that Sierra Nevada are still at the forefront of craft beer. A top class barrel aged offering from one of the all time greats. Hail the great whale unicorn in the Kentucky bourbon barrel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just as delicious as regular narwhal but with some age and bourbon awesomeness! Would buy more!"
""
""
""
"O:  a really good beer, overall, though the barrel aging does surprisingly little to the original beer. At the price point, I think I'd rather just get 8 bottles of regular Narwhal."
""
""
"The barrel flavors are more dried out as if the barrel weren't as 'fresh' as others and doesn't impart the big vanilla, coconut, graham cracker that other BA stouts can do."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Hop City in Atlanta. Pours black with a two finger mocha brown head with excellent retention. Creamy looking. Aroma of graham cracker, roast, cardboard, light whiskey. Flavor is sweet chocolate and vanilla bourbon booze, big roast, lots of oak, rich and sweet, some dark fruits here and there. Silky heavyish mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Really good but just doesn't stand up to my stack of Bourbon County. Definitely worth having though, and probably better than my score indicates (lack of aroma knocked it down more than it deserves). Very good brew."
""
"This is a solid offering that is bold and enjoyable, I could see myself sipping on this again if the opportunity presented itself."
"Initially, the booze kind of dominated this beer. I had to let it warm up to discover a number of enjoyable nuances. I think this could get better with age, so I'm glad I stocked up on a number of them. Right now it's both good and interesting. 4"

"This is really good. Perhaps the most balanced BA stout I have had. A good amount of bourbon flavor, but not super intense bourbon county style, but still far more bourbon flavor than Big Bad Baptist, CW BBS, 2014 Darkness. And, thankfully, that big delicious Narwhal base stout shows its positives as well, despite the bourbon flavor. This one is really well done. Above average mouthfeel/thickness, super dark, smells like it tastes. This one was a winner. 16.99."

"Where I take issue is on the flavor.  A level of sweetness be it from hops or cheap barrel flavor are hard to comment on but they're a part of this beer.  The flavor has a bit of a sour wood element not needed.  Sure the beer is still amazing, it's aged in bourbon!  It is a a great stout, but you won't compare this one to bourbon county stout or other epic examples.  Add in the body is a bit light.  The nose is too much bourbon not enough stout.  Well, it's still great beer but for those looking for the BEST bourbon barrel beers (to me a style but not here) this one is a B.  As stouts go well bourbon is always a plus so yes an A maybe A-."

"750mL bottle. Pours a viscous black color with brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is bourbon, wood, chocolate syrup, espresso, vanilla, and earth. The taste is lots of chocolate syrup and bourbon at first followed by the espresso. Really chocolatey but not overly sweet. Lots of wood and warming alcohol. Some earth and charcoal. Maybe a hint of coconut. Finishes with espresso, chocolate syrup and bourbon. Heavy mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. Probably one of the most drinkable BA Stouts I have had, which is surprising considering it is 12.9%. Overall, amazing."
"Overall, this is a magnificent achievement by Sierra Nevada.  Narwhal was a great beer, and this is up there with the best I've ever had.  Going to be seeking out some more bottles to lay down, and maybe will try another next Thanksgiving. Cheers!"
"Fruit, hops, molasses, malt, vanilla, raisins, boozy. There are a lot of tastes going on here and they all scroll by you in a spectrum. Just a delight but will hammer you pretty quick. Kind of like drinking port wine after dinner, just a little goes a long way."

"Been looking forward to this one for a long time.  Pours a jet black, thick but not too thick that it has no carbonation.  A medium-hard pour will leave you with about a 1"" head that dissipates quickly.  The nose gives you almost exclusively bourbon with a small amount of coffee and cocoa mixed in.  Now for the taste:  Upfront is a strong bourbon taste that stays with you the whole time you're sipping, and lingers well after the brew is empty.  The secondary taste has got to be dark chocolate, which blends nicely with the mild coffee flavors and provides the BA Narwhal with a hint of bitterness.  I love sweet stouts and some of the more bitter ones, but this beer seems to be in almost perfect balance with it's tastes.  As my glass gets lower I notice the beer just keeps getting smoother.  This one is definitely a mellow, relaxing sipper.  I put it right with BA Biscotti Break as one of my favorite stouts.  My only regret is that I didn't buy more than one.  I highly recommend giving this a try if you can get your hands on it."

"O-Simply fantastic! There's some kind of roastiness on the finish, a welcome balance to grandma's fudge. The barrel has done wonders for an already fabulous beer!"
""
"I am early in my appreciation of such things but I believe this to my benchmark from which the rest will be measured.  Big fan of the espresso impressions!"
""
"Incredibly smooth for a beer this big.  As you might expect from SN, this is a study in balance.  A slight bit of bourbon in the nose and the palate follows with silky roasted vanilla character.   The bourbon does seem to overwhelm the base just a little, but I've never found Narwhal to be an assertive beer.   This doesn't reach the heights of KBS or BCBS, but is quite delicious on a cold evening."

"Near black opaque body with a small, oily, beige head. Bourbon, oak, roast aromas. Char and smoke in the flavor with a formidable whiskey presence. Lots of oak and barrel presence. The beer is getting a little better as it opens up. Wet wood and warming alcohol. Pretty tasty."

"Overall this is a really nice beer, not as in your face as other big beers are, this one is a bit more balanced and subtle. It is dangerously drinkable, goes down fairly easily, but still drinking it with a bit of respect. One of the better examples of the style I have tried, but the high price makes this a one time experience for me."
""

"This one has a little bit too much bourbon for me. Surpirised to say, I actually like regular narwhal to the barrel aged variety. Still a solid brew though..."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very well done BA RIS, and is a step up from regular Narwhal. I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag, but I'm glad I got to try it out. If you like more balanced BA stouts, I would check this one out."

"I remember thinking Narwhal had some real potential when I first tried it two years ago and that potential is fully realized in this barrel aged version. The barrel smooths out the flavors, adds a wonderfully sweet complexity and seems to have thickened it beautifully. This beer came out of left field and surpassed my expectations, which is a rare occurrence these days. Yes this is a tad pricey but Barrel Aged Narwhal is a benchmark example of what a barrel aged imperial stout can be and possibly the best beer I've had from the craft veterans at Sierra Nevada. Seriously- try this if you can!"

"$15 for 750 ml bottle"
"What a fantastic and smooth BBA stout. I can't imagine it would be any better with age; it's that smooth and delicious right now. For such a high ABV BA stout, the alcohol is well hidden, and the bourbon perfectly smooth."

"I dig the complexity of this beer.  Good roast, light bourbon, chocolate.  It does teeter on being too sweet though.  Needs a bit more roast."
"Overall: Very nice BA stout, I am very familiar with non-BA Narwhal and this is the only stout that I have had in both forms. I get some of the non-BA Narwhal coming through but the bourbon really changes it. It's not an overwhelming bourbon flavor, nice balance, this has a little bit more carbonation than most BA stouts I've tried. No hops at all in this beer, only a slight bitterness that blends well. This is a must for BA stout lovers. A beer that is well made, interested in seeing what some age does to this beer."

"Overall - I expected greatness. I got a high quality beer. I think prefer regular Narwhal."

"O: A very nice treatment of Narwhal. The barrel notes work extremely well with the mellowed roastiness of the base, all keeping in harmony and not clashing. A great sipper for any occasion, and definitely worth picking up at least one (or multiple to age or do with as you please)"

"Poured into a snifter. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, like dirty motor oil. One finger of thick mocha head. The aroma is phenomenal, with big chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasty malt and bourbon. Also caught some very slight coffee notes. The flavor is also outstanding, also with chocolate, bourbon, woody flavors and lots of dark roasty malt notes as well. The mouthfeel was  thick and silky smooth, with just a slight bit of alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Overall, this ranks right up there with any of the best BBA Imperial Stouts. I'm impressed!  I've hid one in the cellar to see what a little age does to this beer."

"O: tremendous job barrel-aging their Russian Imperial Stout in bourbon barrels - no mistakes here - grab one of these while you can. Cheers!"

"t/m/o - really well balanced BA stout.  has all the robust chocolate roast and chewy body of the original with a really nice glaze of woody bourbon.  the barrel takes some of the extremeness of the roast of the base and sits it in the back seat.  an improvement to an already tasty beer.  the barrel aging really takes it to another level.  very good, easy drinking and worth checking out."
"Overall, this is very tasty.  The barrel notes are somewhat subdued, but I think it makes for a better blend of flavors overall."

"2014 from bottle. Pours a black as night color with small tan head. Scent is dark chocolate with toasted oak. Roasted chestnuts and malt with vanilla and some toffee. Hints of bourbon, but the toasted malt and other toasty aromas make the most of the aroma. Taste is bourbon and booze up front with some chocolate and vanilla. Toffee comes next with more oak and robust flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied... just would you would like in an imperial stout. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I am a huge fan of Narwhal, and the bourbon barrels just increased its complexity and depth. Need to buy more of this."

"This is an awesome ba stout that is knocking on the door of the big boys of ba stouts. If you can find this ale - drink it."
"Where the standard Narwahl is formidable in its own right, the bourbon aging really pulls out the fruit, floral and hop tones as much as it provides complexity of barrel, booze and controlled aging- savory inducing taste."

"o - Overall I liked this one a lot; I had high hopes for this after having the base beer and this did not disappoint.

Hoping to see this one again sometime."

"O- I wasn't sure what to expect going into this beer having never had regular Narwhal and not being a huge fan of the few SN barrel-aged beers I've had. This beer was a pleasant surprise though, was definitely our favorite at the throwdown, and easily stands up against some of the best BA stouts I've had. I really hope they bottle this and I definitely would like to revisit it in the future. I might even go as far as saying I liked it slightly better then bourbon county."
