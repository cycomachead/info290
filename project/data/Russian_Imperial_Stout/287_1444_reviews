review_text
"12oz bottle poured into a brandy snifter.The aroma is initially a tart cherry and cherry pie aroma with some burnt toast, dark chocolate, and oak with late caramel. Beautifully opaque, brown-black, with rich, dark brown head that fades fast, but a very thin layer is present throughout drink with a dense, soap-bubble medium thin ring and a few specks of lace. The taste is heavily sweet with a medium heavy, chocolate coffee bitter, and a touch of umami to it. It’s a viscous, chewy mouth feel with light carbonation. The body is full with notes of chocolate, tart cherries, coffee, and a nice, smooth alcohol warmth to the finish. As it warms up more caramel notes come through with a burnt quality to the finish. The aftertaste is that of dark chocolate and cherries with a bit of a smokiness."

"O: I only got 2 bottles of this… and this was the second bottle. As per the description on the bottle and brewery website, I wish I had more so that I could age it and compare the differences it would make. Having said that, 6 months in, and this was nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is easily one of my favorite RISs I have tried."
""
""
"Bottle date 8/22/13. After pour there is very little head, pretty dark color. Smell is coffee dominant. Good mouthfeel. Taste is primarily molasses and licorice, not as coffee forward as I expected, with a little bit of alcohol heat. While letting it warm up reduces some of its harsher characteristics, have to say i'm disappointed in this one given its reputation. I would put stone ris, narwhal, and old rasputin far ahead of this one overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark black color, with about a quarter inch head, even after an agressive pour. Aroma was very much dark cohocolate, light coffee and some dark fruit notes. The flavor had lots of dark fruity flavors, lighter chocolate than the smell, coffee, molasses, some roasty malt flavors and just a tinge of alcohol. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and chewy, just as a good RIS should be. Overall, this is an outstanding RIS, one of the best non-Barrel Aged stouts out there. Superb!"
""
""
""
"Looks bitch black, one finger of mocha head. Smells strongly of chocolate and malts. Taste is malts, chocolate, bourbon, wood, ethanol, toffee. Alcohol flavor shines through a little more strongly than I was anticipating but it was awesome. Also a little sweeter than I was expecting. Feel is thick but not not as robust as some other high ABV stouts, complimented the taste perfectly. Overall an awesome beer, really blew me off my feet. Need to acquire more ASAP."
""
""
""
""
"O - Quite excellent, and probably best compared to Old Rasputin (another stout with hop character)  At times I found myself wanting more sweetness, and at times more roast; a stout that walks such a fine line between the two is fairly unique indeed. I'd be very curious to see what a year or two of aging might do to this, and with 12oz bottles available, why not?"
"A serioulsy complex flavor profile leaves my brain turning and turning and turning.  I hope to purchase a few 6 packs of this to age for the next couple years."
"Solid RIS by Bell's. Nothing too crazy, but definitely worth a try. Right on the outside of my top 10."
""
""
""
"This is definitely a unique stout, just not quite sure if the flavors are exactly what I'm desiring from a stout."
""
""
"The high alcohol content of 10.5% took away some of the flavor and tended to dominate the taste."
"Overall - Very impressed with the complexity of the flavor. Very good stout. ABV is barely, if at all, detectable."
""
"What a rich, hearty brew. Some can tolerate RISs that are thin in body. I can't. For the similar-minded, you'll love the body of the Expedition. Taste is just as strong, a mix of roast and chocolatey black licorice. It's the sweetness factor that is basically the only thing that distinguishes the Expedition from the Ten Fidy (Expedition weighs in at 10.5 as well). This is a huge beer--I think it's Bells' best offering. Shame it can't be available year-round."

""

"I love this beer drinking it fresh but I found one in my cellar that was just over a year old....wow...flavor profile smooths our considerably."
""
""
""
""
"Opened a 2011 and it smelled amazing, and tasted almost as good as it smelled. This beer ages really well. Dangerously well, as you can no longer taste the big boozy flavor thats there when its fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a really great imperial stout and ranks up there with the others that I really like."
""
"Just not a fan of Imperial type stouts."
"This is heavier, but tasty stout. Has almost a barrel aged flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"TASTE: Intense roasted graininess, creamy, full bodied, warming alcohol, very smooth, slight oxidation, sherry, baker’s chocolate, bitter, black berries, raisins, molasses, bittersweet finish"

"Taste the alcohol too much for my taste. I had one fresh and had one after a year and a half of cellaring, both were too hot for me. I also didn't care for what I consider a string black licorice taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O; I was not emotionally ready for this."
""
"Very thin head. Pours black. Smells a little sweet, tastes sweeter. Caramelly rye-like malts. 10.5% is totally hidden. Really nice stout."
"Best part about this beer is the mouth feel.  So creamy and chewy.  This beer is like a jacuzzi filled with frothy cappuccino and you dunk your head under and My Bloody Valentine is flowing out of underwater speakers like milk, sending warm fuzzy vibrations deep into your brain."
""
""
""
""
""
"Boozy, but not too boozy. Thick, but not too thick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – A very nice stout, went down easy."
""
""
"overall a favorite i keep coming back to, i think its better as it gets a little warmer, the only negative i ever, experience, is a slight soy sauce aroma/ flavor in some older bottles but somehow it still works, almost adds something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great stout!  Nice bouquet of cocoa and coffee.  Thick, creamy and silky texture.  Taste is sweet on the front with a slight bitterness on the finish to balance it out.  Flavors of cocoa and coffee.  This is so smooth it hides the 10.5% abv very well.  I found other Imperial Stouts like Old Rasputin and Narwhal to be very harsh.  I kind of expected the same from Expedition, but didn't find any harshness at all.  It is so smooth and such a high quality beer, very impressive!  This is a great go-to, non barrel aged, Imperial Stout."
"On tap at World of Beer, Ann Arbor poured into snifter. Midnight black with tall chocolate milk-colored head that leaves rings of lacing on the drink down. Aroma is chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malt, and alcohol. Taste is similar - malty with chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors. Modest bitterness from hop and espresso supply balance. Full bodied, creamy, chewy, and thick texture, low carbonation, and a bit of burn on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"My first Bell's beer. Had one bottle 2 nights ago, had a second tonight to validate or dispell first impression. Nice coffee flavor but without any chocolate counterpart, and instead a hoppiness in the back of the beer that substantially detracts from the flavor, almost as if a 1/4th of the beer was poured off and an equal amount of a black ipa added. Label states beer ages well. I will cellar this until the Fall when I will try another. A disappointment for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good beer from Bells. Might have a Hopslam after, if this one doesn't put me to bed!"
""
""
""
"O - 4.75 - Ranks up there with the best of the best as far as RIS go! If you're a fan of the style it is worth purchasing and setting a few back to age, comes in a six pack too! What's not to love about this awesome brew?"
""
"Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great stout and more enjoyable than Black Note to my memory. While it tastes a little ashy, I think some age would help in that department. I'd love to taste Expedition with a year or two on it."
""
""
"Probably one logical step forward from a Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little too much of the ashy / roast character for my taste but I enjoyed the nice hop character even after the age on the beer."
"A fine stout  that ranks right up there with Founders"
""
"Dec 2012 bottle into a glass. Blah, not much taste, not sure if it was bad or not stored properly but not good"
""
""
"Bought a 6-pack of the 2013 vintage; interested in seeing how age affects this beer. I plan on drinking one a year until 2018. Today 1/31/15, about 18 months after bottle date, this beer has an enticing smell with a silky smooth taste mixed with dark fruit; really coats the mouth. Alcohol heat is still slightly there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very, very good. Will be savoring the rest of the sixer."
""
"Overall great stout and flavor"

"Best imperial stout I've had and one of the best beers period. Amazing"
"Bottled 9/18/14, poured from 12oz bottle into snifter.  Huge chocolate and dark fruit taste, very nice sweetness, laces well.  Alcohol is well hidden by all the flavor. What a magnificent RIS this is."
""
""
""
""
"O: I have a lot of respect for this beer.  It's sort of like a full bodied Rasputin, although this is far from my favorite style."
"Good weight, stops short of being rich and doesn't have the bitterness that some RIS have."
"EDIT 3/2/15: Sippin on a 2009 Expedition on draft and my oh my is this spectacular. The aromas and flavors have blended together wonderfully. The smell is dark espresso, bitter roasted and sweet caramel malts, dark fruits, and mild chocolate. The taste is like some of the best espresso youll ever have, dark fruits, mild chocolate, and a solid roasted and caramel malt backbone. The alcohol from a fresh batch has totally dissipated and the bitterness has mellowed out, although still slightly bitter. This joins an aged oatmeal yeti as the best stout iv ever had. I thought a fresh Expedition was one of the best RIS iv ever had, but this is somethin else. I have just raised my rating a couple tenths. I need to start cellaring bottles in my basement, if only i could forget theyre down there lol"
""
""
""
"Big dark chocolate and coffee up front with a moderate hop finish. Thick, viscous and syrupy.  A very good stout."
""
""
""
""
"The best beer I've ever had!"
"Overall: I have drank this beer before years ago. I was not impressed with it the first time I tried it, I know more what to look for now and although in the beginning I had it too cold and did not enjoy the flavors, as it warmed it was definitely better, nevertheless it is still not one of my favorite beers of the style nor from Bell's. With all the options we have out there these days I would probably pass on this one considering the price point, however it does come in a six pack which is a good thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, not a bad stout. This beer is readily available and totally drinkable. I like this beer because it has more substance and thickness than some boasting the same flavors. It isn’t overly thick, but the rights blend. Aging would work well for this beer; it would tame the bitterness down making it beautifully balanced. While I like the bitterness, as it warms, it is a little too much for the beer. I could see something remarkable after a year or so. This would be a good beer with some beignets. I give it 94/100."
"Had to try my first one fresh. I can tell this is going to be an awesome beer with some age on it"
""
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't too surprised, since that bitterness is described by Bell's themselves, but my desire to try it out won over my original intent to age it. In the end, I liked it, but the rest of the bottles went to the basement, to be enjoyed at a much later time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oily black, toffee head. Sweet cookie dough, light toffee. Sweeter than I remember with a hint of lemon zest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks beautiful.  Sleeps ok. Taste is really goo but really bitter for a stout. I am going to save the rest of the six pack and age it. I'll review again next year."
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer that could be better if some of the flavors were less intense.  The coffee notes in particular could use toned down and made less bitter.  While this bottle had 3.5 months already, I could see an extended cellaring improving this a good deal."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, an incredible RIS and very drinkable. Really hits all the high points of the style and is quite delicious."

"had a 2012 the other day.  very solid.. a little to boozy for me.."
""
""
"The beer pours a rich black, crowned with a coffee colored head that has a custard-like consistency. The foam slowly settles, leaving a solid inch and half thick band around the glass. I don't know if I can call that lacing. It's looks more like a decorative ribbon! There's a slick coating on the surface and an oily film left behind with each swirl. The appearance is sturdy. A hearty looking brew. The smell is quite complex. Pronounced soy sauce and canned mushrooms, with a mild metallic scent. Chocolate baklava with honey sweet figs.  The customary coffee, char and dark fruits are there as well, but less so. Subtle booze. The flavors are much more potent. There's an explosion of taste on the first sip. Sweet molasses with roasted black coffee. Burnt malts with black licorice notes. A distinct cocoa toffee finish with charcoal bitterness imparted from the hops and deep roast.  Dry and bitter in the end, as the roast simply clings to your palate and refuses to let go.  The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a hearty creaminess that gives the brew an enormous body. Lively, fine pin-prick carbonation helps all of the flavors burst to life. After a few sips, it leaves a sticky feeling in your mouth. Half-way through the glass and there is a nice warming alcohol heat in the chest. I know this is not a spiced beer, but I'd swear that there is some cinnamon in there. Ultimately, this is a man's beer. Something to warm the winter nights in northern Michigan while staying in the snow-covered cabin. A big, bold Russian Imperial Stout with a soothing touch of rustic campfire goodness. Bottled 10/23/14. I've had aged versions that are phenomenal in their own right, but I still prefer the fresher alternative. A+"

"This is an amazingly delicious Russian Imperial Stout, currently my favorite."

"Taste is very heavy on the dark fruit flavor. Reminiscent of eating a small box of raisins in one mouthful or chugging some warm prune juice. Too much."
""

""
""
""

"Inky and black with minimal head. Boozy smell. I normally love a good stout but the alcohol overpowers on this one."

"O:  glad to try this young to compare with my older bottle.  A good ris and will certainly improve with age."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed my first bottle.  Great beer.  Now I'm going to put the rest of the bottles in my cellar and drink one a year."
""
"Just excellent is all I can say at the least. Smells and tastes of deep dark chocolate with a little molasses possibly, can't really tell but whatever is in there, is good. Slight hoppy bitterness on the finish. And has a very thick syrupy appearance with a thick sticky brown head. Just amazing"
""
"Excellent stout. Bell's never seems to disappoint."
""
""
""
"Tried a 5 year bottle while at dark lord day this past spring and never had a chance to score it.  The difference the 5 years had on this beer is astonishing.  The flavors all melt together and you are left with a mellowed out version that is much more forward with chocolate notes.  If you pick up a 6 pack I highly recommend drinking one initial bottle and then pull one bottle per year for the next 5 years so you can experience the transformation."

"O:  Excellent stout. Lots of big bold flavors and aromas. Very nice sipper on a cold winter night."
"Pours a very dark brown to black color with a small light brownish head.  There is a little bit of lacing.  The odor is creamy vanilla, chocolate, dried fruits, raisin, coffee, and caramel.  The taste is very rich, velvety, cocoa, bitter chocolate, vanilla, chalky, bitter throughout, this beer is only four months old."

"Thick and black, like the bottom poor from a french press. A firm foamy khaki cap sits atop for a couple moments before slowly dissipating to a paper thin cover that remains for the duration. The nose is sweet and brings soft notes of caramel and toffee and sweet dark fruits. WOW, this is a delicious RIS! Dark chocolate, heavy roasted malts and sweet dark sugars. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable on the tongue . The mouth-feel is luxurious. Oily, thick and creamy! Slightly dry on the finish. I could drink three in a row or sip on one for a couple hours. This one is amazing and I'm already looking forward to another!"

"Pours black as night with a nice awesome head that goes quickly. Smell is very subtle. Taste punches you in the mouth. Delicious and smooth. Thick, thick, thick. Bitter but not too much. Malt and chocolate. Seriously this beer is awesome. I am drinking from a growler. I have a few bottles in the cellar from last year and this year. I can't wait to see what a few years does to this beer."

"O: This is a darned good RIS. Being a malthead, I'd have loved to see a little less showcasing of the earthy-pine hop flavors, which are noticeable and sort of horn in on the malt profile. This beer also did not hide its ABV at all to me, though the bottle was only three months old - perhaps the burn fades with more age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a superior stout, Russian Imperial-style - something you must try when you get a chance."
"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours black with a brown head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and dark fruit. Taste of chocolate, vanilla and molasses, along with chocolate and coffee. Excellent imperial"

"Overall: This is an excellent imperial stout, from the imperial stouts I have had, I would judge that this is one of the smoothest. The beer's flavors blend really well, nice thickness, high drinkability, just outstanding, glad to have this in CA. This is a must try."
""
""

"O: Awesome stuff. I will likely drink this sipper far too fast."
"This is definitely the best stout and best bells brew I've ever had.  full of flavor and perfect texture.  Bonus for being available in 6pk format.  Perfect stout while watching the first snowfall of the year tonight."

"Such a rich robust stout with just a hint of smoke, its truly a wonderful beer!"
"2pppurchased in Kalamazoo, MI around early May 2003. Very little carbonation with lively nose of dark fruits, toffee. Good mouthfeel & light spice, licorice on the finish. Smooth & satisfying!"

"Poured into an oversized tulip, extremely dark with a one-finger light brown head that subsided fairly quickly. The aroma was dark chocolate and dark fruit, along with herbal hops. The flavor is dark and faintly roasty, with chocolate hints and dark fruits, mainly dried cherry and plum, complemented by assertive herbal, almost medicinal hops. I can see how this would be viewed as a challenging stout, but being a fan of hoppy beer, this was close to just right as far as I was concerned."

"Overall- Wonderfully balanced flavors, intense bitterness is finely offset by creamy taste and feel. The aroma and mouthfeel are perfectly wrapped into the overall enjoyment of this beer. Everything great about this particular style of beer seems to be present and celebrated in this beer."
""
"Not usually a fan of imperials, the alcohol burn is never a friend of mine.   But this one was different, it was more flavor than booze.  One of the few rips that I would order while out!   Loved it"
"Picked this up for $10 for a six.  The date shows Aug 2013, which I just realized.  Since the abv is over 10 it probably just got better.  Creamy with hints of coffee and chocolate.  Would have to put this in the same league as bcbs, but may have to do a side by side comparison."
""
"Pours a deep inky black. Absolutely no light gets through this. The head is pretty thick, initially a deep brown settling into a thin light tan disc. Light soapy lacing. The aroma is pleasant, deep roasted malt tones and alcohol's sweet astringency. The taste has a pleasant rich maltiness and the alcohol from the aroma fades into the background. There's a just enough hops to balance the huge roasted malts. The body has a nice heft to it and a silky feel. There is a tingling left on the tongue from the big ABV."

Hints of chocolate, molasses and a slight taste of coffee.  Beautiful jet black color with a great creamy head.  A top-three stout for sure.  Must get another growler soon."

"beautiful chocolate milk appearance and head..... love the roasted aroma: chocolate and barley! taste is thick and bitter, as I've heard from others. still very young, only two months away from bottling, lots of bitterness with the cocoa, chocolate and roastiness. thick coating of micro-bubbles down the side with each drink. nice coating on the tongue with a residual sweetness and bitterness. gave two away, got three more to let sit. i'm betting this will mellow nicely with some time."

"O: Actually exceeds my expectations which were high.  I have always wanted to try this but always passed it over.  Wish I had tried it years ago.  This is a top tier stout on it's own with no barrel aging....wow.  Bell's knows stouts."

"Age. This. Beer. It's begging for it. Sometimes overly harsh with the hop profile when fresh, once this hits the two year mark (and literally, for years and years after), this beer is a magical creature complete with fairy wings and unicorn horns. Always a hop bomb, the roasted, chocolate notes just get deeper and more nuanced and more smooth with time. A superb stout that any fans of the style will already know is delicious."

"Tastes like used motor oil. If I wanted something so acrid, bitter and viscous I'dattach a funnel to the gas tank on my car. Bell's seems to have no clue how to produce a decent stout. Pretty much their entire line is an undrinkable mess. How this gets nationally distributed is unreal. Take your average home brew and it would taste like the second coming of Christ compared to this undrinkable mess."

"02/11/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A fine, fine brew. First nostril full is of a mild coffee. On the tongue it has a very pleasant bitterness from coffee & a mild chocolate. Steady, steady stuff. Sessionable plus."

"When I first bought this two years ago, I read how bitter it was when new, so I aged it for a couple of years. Its a pretty complex stout with big coffee, dark chocolate, some licorice, and caramelized brown sugar. But yes, it is still pretty bitter. The finish reminded me of a bitter hop bomb lightly subdued with dry dark chocolate and light pine mixed in. Overall, it was nice. Super viscous, sweet, bitter, balanced, and not much burn."

"Poured into my tulip from a 12oz bottle. These have about a year on them (purchased at the Andersons in C-Bus, OH). Bit pricey, but well worth it! Pure black (blacker than my heart) with a finger of tan head... didn't last too long. Immediate notes of coffee, molasses, and DEEP dark roasted malt. Yes. The deep roasty flavor emerged with the first swig, also a crisp bitterness. Hints of bitter chocolate and even a bit a caramel as time passed. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Glad I invested in a sixer, and excited to age a couple of these for upcoming birthdays (maybe '15 and '16). What a winner. One of my faves is FIS, and in my opinion (though it has some unique characteristics)... Expedition stands right up with FIS. Get some."

"M - thick, but silky smooth. Fills your mouth to the extent that you can almost feel the bitter-sweet effervescence in your sinuses. Big sweet center that dries out nicely on the finish, leaving some lingering roastiness."

"Dark fruity sweet smell with some bitter chocolate. Great head (dark brown) and thick lacing. Complex flavor with roasted malts / dark fruit and it seems that dark fruit influence lingers on the aftertaste for awhile which is a good thing. Nice change from some of the hoppier, heavier roasted brands like Plead the Fifth (which I enjoy as well)."

"The 2011 batch from the tap of Beverage World, this brew pours dark reddish brown black with a big tan head. Aromas and flavours of molasses cookies, spicy ginger snaps, cinnamon, bitter chocolate, coffee, hints of wet straw, soy sauce, grass, & vanilla. Full bodied, rich palate combines with dry, crisp, smoky roasted finish. Truly outstanding!"

"This is one of the greats, and with its tremendously high aging qualities, this is perhaps one of the most unique stouts brewed in the country that is available quite often. I'd love to get a case of this and age it, but location is seriously screwing me up here. Simply phenomenally complex and easy-drinking stuff. Rewards you in the long run and sticks it to the hyped beers as any old school craft recipe should. Highly recommended."

"Pours black with 2 fingers of tan head which retains nicely. The nose is boozy with sweet and roasty malts, dark fruits, raisins, and some dark chocolate. It tastes sweet and chocolaty at the front of the tongue with a bite of bitterness coming later, bringing herbal hop, coffee, and roasted grain flavors. There's a bourbon barrel quality to it and it leaves an aftertaste of chocolate-covered raisins. It's full bodied, alcoholic, and skirts the edge of doing too much, but doesn't quite go over that edge."

"I like this beer for a lot of reasons, but I think the best thing about it is that a single 12 ounce bottle didn't cost more than $2.50. That's a steal for such a monster of a beer. I shoulda stocked up on about 15 more."
""
""
"Overall, I love the HUGE roasted malt character and thick body, but the bitterness is left on the palate a little too long. Drank 1 year 3 months after bottled date (9/25/2013) and this could definitely use more time. Balanced out a tad after a year, but more time could certainly help."
"Darker than night with a wisp of quickly dissipating dark brown foam. The nose is an obscene amount of dark malt along with some roasted barley. The mouth is thick and sticky. The front of the palate is heavy with dark malt and roasted barley. The back of the palate is plums and fig mixed with dark malt."
""
"Very dark pour. Not too much carbonation present and seems like there is used motor oil in my snifter. Smell has Incredible amounts of roastiness, molasses, and some dark candied fruit and syrup. Maybe even some hickory smoke and burnt char. Taste is similar with some bitterness to add. I believe this is still ""young", needs to age some, and plan to drink a 2012 side by side with a 2013 in the near future and re-review. Stay tuned!!"

"Poured a pitch dark black color with a thin brown ring of a head which quickly dissipated. Smell and taste was delicious. Consisted of dark chocolates; roasted malts; slight espresso; a touch of breadiness/nutiness. Full bodied beer. Sticky on the mouth and smooth across the tongue. No hint of alcohol on this 10.5% beast. Excellent, enjoyed thoroughly!"

"Overall, rarely will I give a beer anywhere near a 4.5, because I dont feel most meet those expectations. I dont believe there IS a perfect 5/5. If there was, then you could stop drinking anything else and stop reviewing. Its all about the chase, man. While I think the price could come down about a buck or 2, this is one of the only 6 packs that I feel is actually worth 16-17 bucks. It probly costs alot more for the amount of grains that go into making this big, big brew. The quality is worth the extra dollar. Thank you Bells!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark, almost black, this stout is a creamy and thick liquid. It has a brown head, a solid complexion, and a dense, black color. The smell is of grain, burnt sugar, and alcohol. It has a lot of character...warmth, bitterness, and velvety heft. The beer is very full flavored, intense....some malt. Balanced...neither sweet nor dry. Full body. Lengthy and smooth finish."

"O - I like certain aspects quite well. The beer holds its ABV well, and with 1-1/2 years, it is not a big, hot mess that it could have been. This is a sipper, and not on drinker. I like my stouts with strong coffee notes, and that is not the game here. Nevertheless, the balance achieved as this ages is a impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure I've had a more perfect Russian imperial stout. Pours a deep black with barely a finger of dark tan head- excellent lacing though. Very complex in taste. Obvious I chocolate malts, backed by coffee notes and nutty, smokey goodness. Coats the mouth just right with a slightly boozy finish that just lets you know it's there. I'm in love."
""

""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. I was surprised that when I read other reviews there was no other mention of the mint in the nose. I don't know if it was a product of the cellaring process or if my nose and palate are that bad.... but it was there. I would drink it again, but I don't think I'd have more than one at any given time - it was a good beer to close out an evening."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"While a bit bitter and relatively high in ABV, it's quite easy to drink. As it warms more and more sweetness comes out, making it even more drinkable. I've never seen this in town before so I'm really excited to know I can age a couple more bottles for the future."
""
"O - It's big, complex, and full of new and interesting flavors with each gulp. I can't wait to see how this beer changes with age. I'll be sure to cellar a few for later. It's not an every day beer, but I would certainly get this one again. Great for cold winter nights. Prost!"

"Overall this is a solid representation of a classic Russian Imperial Stout. A straightforward, no-nonsense, very enjoyable example of the style. Probably my favorite non-barrel-aged imperial stout."
""
"Pours a viscous black with a beautiful creamy mocha coffee colored head. Head dissipates quickly leaving only a ring of bubbles. Smells of roasted malt, char, burnt coffee, dark cocoa, with a graininess. Taste is well balanced with a nice chocolate coffee burnt flavor upfront. Not overly sweet, instead there is a solid wall of bitterness on the back end of the palate that lingers. Mouthfeel is as would be expected. Overall, an excellent RIS, though maybe a step behind Founders."

"O: A good imperial stout overall. Viscous and tasty with a good amount of depth."
""
"Having tried some of Bell's other offerings and reading the reviews prompted me to seek this one out for a try. This stout pour very dark with a very dark head on the pour. There was enough of a boutique that made me want to take a nice long sip and enjoy but I was a bit disappointed. I don't equate a stout necessarily with hoppiness but that is what over-rode this tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours very little head but still leaves a nice brown ring around the inside of the glass. Despite the lack of head, the beer still leaves some nice lacing. The beer is less of a pitch black and more of a very dark brown similar to dark chocolate. Unlike other Russian Imperial Stouts, the beer appears to have smooth surface. The beer has a strong sweet dark chocolate smell but with bitter undertones such as cocoa and the occasional hint of smoke. Additionally, the smell has hints of booziness with slight fruity hints. The smell is not very strong but is certainly complex. Unlike the smell, the taste is extremely strong and complex. The strongest flavors appear to be roasted malts and cocoa but become subtly overwhelmed by a dark chocolate taste at the end. The beer also has a slight boozy and vanilla taste as well that complements the other notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth and rich. Even though the beer is full-bodied, the beer is not heavy. Rather, the feel is more present that you know its there but not so much that it overwhelms. Overall, an excellent beer despite its price range and worth getting and aging."
""
"This is definitely a slow sipper, even for an imperial stout. The upshot is that it's rich, full beer brimming with the bold flavors expected of the style. The bite of the hops is slightly excessive on the front end, but it's not a fatal transgression by any stretch. It's certainly the best thing I've had by Bells, which typically struggles to impress me."
"O - A very great imperial stout! I really enjoyed this, and will definitely purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Where this beer really shines is the feel. If ever I was tired of middle-of-the-road breweries brewing a medium or barely full-bodied RIS and I needed something I knew I could find, there's no question this substantial, robustly-bodied beauty would do it. It coats the tongue almost luxuriously but doesn't sit too heavy though it's seriously thick and rich. A little char adds a drying note into the finish."
""
"Overall this isn't quite perfect but can still be called an absolute masterpiece from Bell's. I wish I had bought more than I did while it was available so I could age a bunch of it while still blasting huge amounts in its current condition, because it's pretty amazing as-is."

"O- a world class beer that needs time to develop. But a t 6 months it is a beer best enjoyed in a cold night when you need warm me up."

"O-great imperial stout very smooth smell, taste and palate. Great beer even thou I don't drink coffee"

Still, I'm ecstatic that I enjoy RIS's as much as I do now. I'm really enjoying this beer... I couldn't ask for more from the appearance and mouthfeel, as they are truly flawless."

"Bought this 6-pack last year and this is the first bottle I've touched. You can spare me the ``drink one fresh'' speech. I've had this beer fresh many times, I was never impressed, and I don't think the brewer intends for you to drink it that way anyhow. Since its reputation as a good cellar beer is undeniable, I plan to re-review it at 12-month intervals. This one is about 14 months old and, while good, still has lots of room for improvement. At present, it can't hold a candle next to my favorite RISs. I look forward to someday trying one of these that's 4-5 years old. Consider this review a work in progress."

"O - Good, but not great. Although a wide spectrum of flavors , flavors are less intense. Licorice was an interesting addition though. Mouthfeel compared less favorable... less creamy, lighter bodied than comparable stouts. Worth a try, but better options available."

"O Very tasty. It's got all the flavors that make an Imperial Stout great and none of these overpower the other. Smell is great. I like that the coffee seems to be toned down some as sometimes it's easy to go overboard with that."
"Overall: One of the more complex Impy stouts I have tasted. Quite bitter and therefore might not be approachable by new craft beer drinkers."

"O - when you pair Bell's Brewery and the RIS style you get Expedition Stout and boy am I glad those 2 hooked up. This is one of the best year in and year out imperial stouts you'll find. It's something I enjoy every winter and something I look forward to aging. Oh yea, I forgot about that.. Expedition Stout does well setting in a cool dark place for any period of time. But that's another review for another day. If you like big roasted bittersweet stouts get your hands on some Expedition. Highly under appreciated in today's craft beer scene. An all time favorite of mine."

"O-great balance in this RIS, enjoyable to sip this"

"I Had this beer shipped to me after spending about 9 months at my parents house in Michigan. Forgot I had left it there but they included it in with a beer order I had placed on a website, but being in Texas, could not get shipped directly. It was, to date, the best pure Russian Imperial Stout I have ever tasted. The absolutely creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation coupled with the perfect balance of bitter chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and a touch of vanilla, and the fact that the 10.5% alcohol was completely hidden was just awesome. I remember tasting it 9 or so months ago and loving it then, but this I think is aged to perfection. Have on bottle left and will probably drink it very soon too."

"There's something to be said about being complex in a simple way. This beer is simple but it brings outstanding precision and subtle complexities, with a strong bitterness to round out the sweetness. Very focused flavors that bring maximum flavor with a stellar body that is as creamy as they come. My favorite Bells by far!"
"Pours inky black with a thin mocha head. Good lacing. Aroma of chocolate, burnt coffee and a whiff of smoke. Bitter on the palate, lots of dark fruit, bitter chocolate and nice hop character. Thick, rich mouthfeel with little carbonation. Overall, a great example of Russian Imperial Stout. Well crafted."

"Bottled 7/26/13. Pours black as a starless night with a lasting head. Subdued nose of roast. Nice creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation and with the 10.5% alcohol content well covered by the malty sweetness, hops and roast. A strong, but pleasant, aftertaste of roast and malt sweetness with that alcohol ""burn"". For such a ""big"" stout, this is exceptionally well balanced. One of the best stouts I have ever tried and this one struck me as smoother than their Kalamazoo variant. Smooth finish with the chocolate malt asserting itself."

"This is a true RIS Bells knocked it out of the park on this one, i have a few more set back to age another year see how it is then."
"Overall, a great take on RIS, although there are examples of the style that I would likely drink before this one. I would hazard a guess that six months old is close to the bare minimum age you want to crack a bottle with, based on how it tastes at eight months."

"Pitch black, thick and sludgy, doesn't get better. Smell is heavy roast and chocolate, but a metallic twang that kind of distracts. Taste is insanely strong, complex, roasted coffee and chocolate with heavy grain sweetness. Mouthfeel is oily and creamy. Fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery."

"I poured the beer into a pint glass. Dark. Coffee with cream colored head. Smells of something roasty plus some fruit. Fig maybe? Definitely not raisin. There are lots of flavors in the beer. It's tough to sort them all out. Chocolate cherry, roasted malt, maybe a little coffee in there too. A little warmth from the alcohol. I'm sipping the beer. If you take it slow, it is quite enjoyable. Don't go fast, you'll miss out."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its nice look on the pour, and its rich flavoring. The latter explodes from that first sip, with surprising sweetness and fruitiness after that dry, heavy aroma. The flavors run deep, cutting grooves with raw cocoa, bittered roast, gritty grain, soft smokes, and intense booziness. These remain robust throughout, with little melding by the end of the tasting. Rather, they keep at odds with each other, acting to provoke the strength of the next through competition and contrast. That said, the final picture is cohesive enough to appreciate, and you are left kind of wondering what just had its way with you. Tasty, weighty stout, really left only to those who can handle a big Russian bad boy such as this."

"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, carbonation of a medium-low intensity, yielding a minimally foamy, primarily chewy stout. Ethanol is definitely present, particularly in the nostrils and back of throat, though tingling can be felt on the palate, too. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate and lips after each sip."

"O: I wish I had gotten a six-pack of this, which I think was rare for it being 9 months old. Finally, Bell's hits a knockout for me. This one takes your mouth on an expedition. I can see why people want this one."
""
"Overall: this is a very delicious beer. Since this was my first Expedition, I couldn't wait to age it any longer; I just had to dive in. In future, if I can get my hot little hands on some more, I will age 2-3 years and see what happens."
"Atmosphere is very nice. Thick head, and some slight but persistent lacing. Nose is roasted coffee, chocolate and wood. Flavor... coffee chocolate, licorice, woody, with some high alcohol. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"this is a colossal beer, and one that comes with quite a bit of hype. for me, it was a shade under the quality of the most elite Russian imperials, but its a damn good beer nevertheless. it pours a really dark brown color, coffee in color really, with a robust milky cream head and an aroma of black barley and more hops than expected, this is bitter for sure. some hot alcohol greets my lips, followed by raw cocoa, toasted nuts of some kind, maybe macadamias, something oily, and then the bitter super dark, almost burnt barley. its quite the journey, but the whole thing really is overshadowed a little bit by the alcoholic intensity. some age may indeed do this good, as mine is less than a year old. fortunately I have some more bottles for this. which reminds me, thanks again to thebrewo for making yet another great beer possible for me in Colorado. obviously full body, but not as thick or viscous as some, decent carbonation for what it is, and a very warming alcohol finish on top of all the bitter. this is an impressive beer, but one that age will service well I think. bells can really do no wrong for me."

"Overall - Reminds me a bit of the Victory Storm King... a beer I found too soapy on the back end to find enjoyable. While not nearly as soapy, the Expedition Stout does have a touch of that character that I can't look past. This is a good beer, but there are plenty of imperial stouts I'd rather have. It's certainly nothing I'll go out of my way for again. To each their own! Maybe this would be better with a year or two of aging on it, but I'll probably never know."
"overall: One of my favorite stouts, or beers of all time for that matter. I have one aging along with a Stone IRS to see who the ultimate champion is. This is one damn good beer, i'm still trying to find Bell's Blacknote Stout, but I don't know how it could even top this."

"o: One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had. Very strong, over 10%, you can feel it but it is not at the top of the taste profile. Hoppy but well balanced, not hoppy to the point of loosing the beer flavor. Malty, yeasty, creamy with good flavor and that hopp bitter in the end to lat you know it's Imperial."
""
"O- I have not had this fresh, but this is drinking fantastic with ~3.5 years on it! I would have been happier if some more of the complexity in the nose came through in the flavor, but it still tastes superb!"
""
""
""
""
"One of the best stouts I've tasted and definitely a benchmark of the stye. Rich, creamy, and delicious."
""
""
""
"This is probably one of my favorite imperial stouts. It really has everything that you would want in an imperial stout, but isn't thick like oil sludge. All of the flavors balance out well. It has a great amount of roastiness and bitterness, but still finishes nicely. It surprised me when I found out the ABV, or else I would've had a few more pints."
"Overall- Great stout. Easy to drink and enjoy, the alcohol bite reminds you not to enjoy to many. Basic and straightforward with its flavor and not overwhelming. Enjoyable and tasty up to two, but time to switch after that."

"O: I guess I'm just not in Bell's target audience. This is the second highly acclaimed Bell's beer (the other being 2-hearted) that seem seriously over-hyped to me. This wasn't a bad beer by any circumstances, but neither was it something that lived up to its reputation or pricetag. I know that ""balance"" is supposed to be a sign of superior brewing skill, but to me, if NOTHING stands out about a beer, it's balanced to the point of being boring. And I would have to say that for me, Expedition Stout was an $8 glass of Meh. Oh well, different brews for different crews."
""
""

"The beer pours dark and sludgy, like motor oil. A head forms of dark tan, almost chocolate brown, tiny bubbles that are very closely knit together and fade away quick, as might be expected at 10.5% alcohol. The beer’s lacing is nearly nonexistent due to the alcohol, but does live a few thin spots and some slight legs from the alcohol. The beer’s body is too dark to properly gauge. On the nose, this beer is thick with raisiny and plum malts, almost quad-like in intensity. Beneath the raisin sits a healthy cocoa smell that plays beside roasted coffee malts and thick creamy dark chocolate. The smell is boozy sweet, and stings the nostrils just enough to let us know there is thick sweet alcohol in this. On the tongue, the beer tastes thickly of bitter coffee roast with a light sweetness at the back of the tongue. The beer’s flavors begin with chewy thick almost raisiny sweet malts that move swiftly into chocolate and then into thick roasted smoky malts that bring lovely RIS flavors. The sweet malts briefly touch on a cloying level of sweetness, but are swiftly washed away by the bitter roast of the malts. The finish is fat with roasted coffee malts, char, and a slight sweet touch of raisin and dark fruit. The aftertaste is burnt char and light chocolate flavors. The alcohol of this beer, while briefly present with the cloying sweetness, is actually nicely hidden, and helps to mellow the bitter roast of the malts. In the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy in body. The carbonation is light and nearly nonexistent on the tongue, leaving a thick creamy, velvet feel on the tongue. The mouth is left charred dry with saliva on the sides of the tongue from the light but not noticeable acidity. Overall, this is a lovely RIS. Great big flavors that are not overdoing it, and certainly seem ready to mellow into beautiful things with age. The raisiny sweetness is a little off putting at first, but works beautifully to prepare the tongue for the bitter roast of the middle and finish of the flavor. I’m excited to have tried this beer, and excited to see what it does with age. According to Bell’s this is one of the earliest examples of an American RIS, and I believe they did it beautifully. Try this beer for sure, and age it too, my bottle was a little less more than half a year old."
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and roast malt are well represented, but drier and more bitter at the finish than I prefer. Think majority of the bitterness is hop derived. Fairly complex. The nutty malt saves it for me. Wish the aroma were more pronounced and the finish were less bitter."

"O--I don't get this beer. Maybe I just had a bad 4 pack, but I would have to power though each one until the bitter, and I mean BITTER end. Each time I opened a new one, I would think maybe this time it would be better, but it was a disappointment each time. I'm sure that all the other people who have reviewed this as a 94 are right and I'm wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a brew! An overly aggressive pour may have robbed this one of some carbonation, as it's a bit flat, but every drop of the flavor remained. A bit restrained in the aroma compared to the flavor, but again that may be due to my clumsy pour. Ridiculously creamy with a thick, viscous mouthfeel. Heavy, dark roasted malts and chocolate flavors are supported by a serious amount of hop bitterness. The depth of flavor and balance is off the charts. Almost a meal all by itself. I've had some outstanding Impy stouts, but Expedition Stout is just dynamite and stands alone in the deep, dark, heavy-duty stout category. I envy those of you who have regular access to this gem. A solid A+ rated beer, no less."

"Was expecting so much from this beer, considering it's high ranking and glowing review (and gift!) from my neighbors. Perhaps I just don't care for this style, but I found it way to syrupy. The malt profile doesn't seem to balance out the beer at all, and I found myself making terrible faces every time I took a sip. It's a cross between coffee and cough syrup, in my opinion. Not my favorite. The appearance however, is lovely!"

"I'll admit: I don't get this beer. I'm sure the 2,602 people who have reviewed this as a 94 are right and I'm wrong. I think this is a slightly above average beer, even for a stout. Another example of an ""extreme beer"" that sacrifices subtle and complex characteristics that ease into your palette for an ""in-your-face"" marketing pitch.

"Overall-this is powerful stuff, I think it could use some age on it which I intend to do. That being said it is a very good representation of this style. Warms you to the bone. A heavy hitter for sure. 4.25"
"Overall, I remember getting this bottle (and others) for my birthday many years ago and not being into it, as, at 21 I was a die-hard Guinness drinker. Still love the Guinness, but can appreciate bigger flavors and age has done this well. Gives me a serious lesson on aging big beers, especially after the resinated cake of solids on the bottom needed a drop of water to break up. Even though I'm still not the biggest fan of big imperial stouts, I'd love to try another aged bottle of this."
""
""
"Nicely thick and viscous the taste is of burnt coffee and burnt malt. There is a sweetness of chocolate but its fleeting. The burnt flavors are strong and smooth but there is a slight tinny alcohol after taste. Very warm going down its a great cold weather ale."

"O --> Overall VERY complex beer. many different flavors and great aroma. I should have aged it a little because I hear it is even better, but regardless was awesome. Only criticism I have is that you definitely taste and smell the 10% alcohol."

"Just a very solid archetypal imperial stout."

"Final Thoughts: Definitely one to check out if you are a stout enthusiast. Would I drink it again? Maybe, a bit of a high price point."

"Pours dark as night with a tan head and nice lacing. The smell is roasty with chocolate notes. Bold with a chocolate character along with roast and coffee. Dark fruit and sweet malts try to balance it out. Some vanilla and creamy as it warms. Carbonation is low but finishes with bitterness. A strong brew that I may have to cellar. High alcohol will keep me from drinking to many."

""
""
"EDIT: 2006 vintage, enjoyed 3/21/2013. Thanks to Chris from bringing this one from this cellar. Bell's wasn't kidding when they said this one would hold up. No head, still silky smooth. Flavors are all there; dark coffee, bitter cocoa, sweet licorice. Mellow booziness with a light oxidation - understandable given the age. Fantastic. Seven years old and still holding up like a fuckin' champ."
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours thick black with a dark tan head that laces well as it slowly fades. Smells oakey, a bit hoppy, and malty. Taste is smokey and a bit bitter. Has a chewy and creamy thickness. Leaves your mouth with a dark chocolate after taste that's pretty enjoyable. The alcohol level is hidden well, if you're looking for a thick solid stout, this is worth trying. Not my favorite but really glad I tried it."

"Overall - I do not hand out a perfect score easily. This beer has earned it."
""
""
""

"Overall not a bad beer but it just doesn't take it to the next level would like to age this and see where it is in a couple years."

"O: This one is a bit harsh, frankly. Good news is, aging it will kill that harshness stone dead. Bad news is, I only bought a single bottle. Damnit. Then again, I'm of the school of thought that a beer should be consumed as soon as its purchased, so the middling scores stand."
""
"Overall: an excellent beer, highly quaffable for a RIS, I wish I had more than one bottle. will definitely seek out when I'm back east."
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as non-barrel aged imperial stouts go, this is the one to beat. I do not see how anyone could possibly out do this one. And even among the barrel-aged ones, I can only pick a few that could, possibly, go toe-to-toe with the Bells Expedition."

"O-Maybe some age would do this brew some good, nice flavors but they didn't come together perfectly."
"Personal Rate: 4.5"
"This beer had its moments. I would try it again, but definitely want to cellar it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really impressive. I like smoother stouts, and this really fits the bill. Impressively drinkable for 10.5%. Will definitely be picking up more of this."
""
""
"O-Very disappointed in this brew coming from such a solid brewery With the high praise it gets I was expecting a lot more. Seems very unbalanced and lacks any sort of complexity. Not a good example of the style. I'll lay one down to see if time helps the flavors blend, but otherwise will probably not buy this one again."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, oil hue, nearly black into my glass, with an off-white frothy head covering the top. It remains there clinging to the side and holding steady at about 1/2 inch. This beer's appearance is on point - exactly what I am looking for, it's as if this is just a very large espresso I have here. The aroma is nothing short of an absolute delight! A complex array of flavors enters my nose, such as raisin, purple grapes, cream, molasses, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a slight woody, earthiness. After a healthy gulp I am pleasantly surprised to find that the aroma was not all hype in the slightest. I initially get some fruit flavors, again the grapes, dark fruit, and also a hint of cranberry, and noticeable hops of the ""grapefruit"" variety. Those first aspects are then overtaken by bitter chocolate, a splash of coffee, and a more musty, yet sharp ""barrel"" finish. The alcohol content is not as striking as you would imagine, although the warming sensation eventually does come when you sit for a second. For the mouthfeel, of course it's relatively heavy, but it's not as velvety and full coating as I would like. Overall though its quite delicious and worth picking up because of the more prevalent fruit and hop flavors within this excellent stout. I do wonder what aging this a few years would do to it as well..."
""
""
"O - a damn tasty stout that packs a pretty serious punch of heat and roasted malt, coffee flavor; it's drinkable but will sit you down in a hurry because of that 10.5; there are some bitter chocolate notes present but the balance is there for sure."
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic. If this was a limited release 22oz every year, people would go nuts over it. Good on Bell's for doing this in sixxers. Fantastic beer. I got this as an extra in a trade, but it will be the main-piece in a future trade. Fits somewhere between Rasputin and Founders Imperial Stout flavor-wise."
""
"O: This beer is quite drinkable considering the strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste (provided you can get past the roastiness)."
"O - 3.75"
"O- A good, not great RIS, the mouthfeel is excellent, I much prefer Ten Fidy to this, but I would go back to this for sure."

"Overall (4.0): Damn. This is an incredibly solid brew. It’s not a mind-blowing Russian Imperial Stout, I suppose, but kind of like Two Hearted it does everything it’s supposed to do and it does it all extremely well. It manages to be SO SMOOTH while pulling off so much flavor, body, and density. And it’s pretty damn fresh, too. What a great brew."

"Taste is nice...bitter roasted coffee malts followed by a bit of sweetness. Its a bit over bitter but nice. Its a good brew especially for the price and availability."
""
""
"O – This is a very tasty RIS. The alcohol is certainly apparent here, but the beer is not hot by any means. It would probably smooth out nicely with some age. If I get my hands on another one, I’ll hold onto it for a year and see how it does. Still, for a young imperial stout at 10.5% ABV, it is very drinkable. Bell’s strikes again."
"O - I like this beer a lot. It's like the stout version of Two Hearted, the other tried and true offering by Bells."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Pours dark with a late-forming small mocha head. Smells very sweet like tootsie rolls with some licorice and a hint of vanilla. Very sweet but with a nice bitter finish that keeps it from being cloying. Brown sugar and vanilla up front with a burst of chocolate as it goes down. Good carbonation. Lingering cocoa. Solid stout on national stout day."
""
"O: I wish that the alcohol was a little more well hidden in this beer - there are some very nice aspects to this beer and it would likely mellow out a bit with age. Not the easiest beer to drink, definitely requires some slow sipping over quite a bit of time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is very tasty beer the mouthfeel is great and the chocolate taste is great, there's just a little too much bitterness. Although as the beer warms it tastes better and the bitterness dies down. You can't taste 10.5% abv at all."
""
"O:this is officially the worst is I have ever tasted total drain pour couldn't even get half way through I'm real disappointed I had bigger expectations from what is heard from bells"
""
"I have about a case of this set aside and can't wait to continue drinking them over the next fews years....they should age great!"
""
""
"O: fairly well-balanced, fairly decadent, desserty... becomes boozy and 'fuel'-like later, but you'll be in too fine a mood at that point to throw up a fuss"
""
""
""
"O-this along with the Rasputin, i think, are the quintessential russian imperial stouts. they're full of a good strong dark roasted flavor, and they're not afraid to show some warmth along with bitterness. both are fairly slow drinkers, even for the style. even the 12 oz i wouldn't mind just sharing with a friend. i'd say this one is a bit more even, with a louder touch on the cocoa. definitely worth taking a snab, though there are many other stouts i'd much rather have. its a tough category though, so for the price...this isn't bad."
""
""
"This is a really solid beer. The bitterness is a bit intense and detracts from the rest of the flavors. The overall flavor profile is impressive. Rich, chocolate, roasty, bitter coffee, underlying dark fruit -- really enjoyable. I would have this again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is my first Expedition in about 2 years and I remember it being one of the best stouts I've had so I'm excited. Pours pitch black with a rich, chocolate head that settles down to a cm or so and leaves a lot of lacing. The nose is so rich its crazy. Dark chocolate, coffee, booze, roast, slight char, a bit more chocolate, some prunes and a hint of raisins. The taste isn't as hot as I was expecting, though it does light a bit of a flame deep down in your gut. Booze, raw cocoa, coffee, prunes, dark fruit, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, roasted malts and maybe some figs in the back. Its full bodied with a thick, chewy mouthfeel. This is exactly what the body and mouth of a stout should be. I am super excited to try one every year for the next 5 years. At least I know I'll have one cellared away for a cold night every winter until 2017."
""
""
""
"O: So complex, so well balanced. This is a great Russian Imperial Stout. I get all the flavors I want melded together into one of the best stouts I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm glad I set aside a sixes to age - I think this may be one that only gets better. I'll keep setting aside a few of these each year to sit on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"C+"
"D - Certainly one of the finest beers I've ever tried. The profile is a perfect meld of roasty, hoppy and sweet. Insanely drinkable at nearly 11.00% ABV. Absolutely world class beer overall. If it were readily available to me I would have a cellar full of it."
""
""
""
""
"I'm excited to have a sixer of these to age, tons of flavor but just a tad hot if you ask me."
""
"O - This beer is pretty damn awesome. The ABV is large and has a very, very small presence in the taste of this brew. I had this a few years back and wow did I hate it. My palette simply could not appreciate all the greatness going on in one bottle. I am greatly interested in aging one of these and seeing if it grows into something I would further love."
""
"O: The first time I ever had this beer was a fresh bottle about 9 months ago. I enjoyed it, but thought it was a little bit of a mess, kind of all over the place, but now, after only 9 months of aging I see the potential that this beer possesses. When Bells states that this beer was designed with aging in mind they weren't kidding. I can only imagine this beer getting better and better with age. What a beautiful beer. I almost wish I lived somewhere in the Midwest so I could load up on this stuff when its in season, but at least my trading buddy in Chicago can send me it during the winter months. Anyways, final thoughts on Expedition...AGE THIS BEER! Can't wait to see what a few years does to this masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great complexity on this one, however, Im a little turned off on how the hops overtake the beer. Its as if this one was meant to age, which there is nothing wrong with and it even says its worth aging on the bottle. If the hop character faded away a bit and the beer smoothed out, im sure this would be one amazing beer. Having said that, I guess its time to open my '09!!!"
"O: Overall, I thought this was a stand up stout, it was pretty smooth and rich, agreed with me very well, tasted great with the steak I had."
""
""
""
"O: This is a 2011 Bottle and it really has turned into a very boozy and syrupy beer. It has a nice flavor, but not as great as I was hoping."
"O - Imperial Stout no doubt, just not what I tend to lean toward. I recommend trying it as it may be to your liking. To me it is a decent stout, but not great..."
""
""
""
"O) This is a highly enjoyable sipper. I'm really interested to try this with some age on it. Definitely a RIS that is worth a try. Glad to recommend."

"Pours a black motor oil. Smells of sweet dark fruit. The taste is unexpected and welcome, coffee undertones. Absolutely wonderful. 1 year old beer that pours dark brown, medium fine head, a good looking stout. Aroma up front is malty dark fruit with strong alcohol, the roasted malts come in at the end. Taste is a huge mouthfeel, this is a big ass beer, malty, alcohol, some sharpness which is a warming alcohol. With hop flavor as well. Roasted malts which go very well with chocolate desserts. I have this as a desert beer with chocolate ice cream or desserts often. try this with Ben and Jerry’s New York Super fudge chunk. Great beer one of the top ten I have had made in the US if not the world."

"OVERALL: A pretty standard Imperial Stout, big in its ways, but certainly enjoyable. Can be aged for extended periods of time, but the alcohol will always be there, as it is a big part of the flavor."
"Overall a fine stout. Really tasty and complex, and quite drinkable despite being among the more bitter stouts I've had."

"O - Enjoyable stout that is great to sip after a good meal. A good showing by Bells"
"Drinkability: The main limiting factor of knocking a couple back is the sweetness of the beer, not the abv. Great for a (1) after dinner drink."
""
""
""
"O: Very very solid stout. Wish it was a tad bit less hoppy, but I really enjoyed this one."
"I'm no expert, but view this as a stunning example of this particular style."
"O: Decent beer, but not as good as I had expected given the hype. It was a little too big and harsh for my liking (and I normally like big stouts). I've got a bottle sitting in the basement I'm going to age for a year or two and try it again to see if it mellows, as I've heard some age does wonders for this beer."
""

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 11/11/2010. Pours very dense pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense brown head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge very dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, biscuit, toast, char, molasses, vanilla, toffee, earth, wood, and light herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, tobacco, biscuit, earth, pine, citrus, and light herbal hops. Decent amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, molasses, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a while. Fantastic roasted flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very nice creamy, slick, thick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost no warming noticed at all after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a fantastic Russian imperial stout. Huge complexity and big robust roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Extremely impressive."
""
""
""
"O: I was a little disappointed with this one. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it seems kind of one dimensional and a bit bland. I'm glad I tried it, but I can find other local RIS's that are equal in quality."
""
""
"Overall- This was the 2011 version. I bought a 6 and stashed them so this is the first Expedition stout I've had. Looking forward to getting some years on this to see that alcohol mellow and the chocolate come out even more."

"I had heard such good things about this beer so I was excited when I nabbed one of the last singles from a local shop. Dark brown pour, almost no foam head. Light smell, not very fragrant, bit of soy and pine. Taste is full bodied, stout-like, slightly lactic, sits heavy on the tongue, not too bitter, with notes of echanacia. I wanted to be wowed by this but was just not impressed - I think its possible I might have gotten a bad bottle, as I have read others experiencing more of a head when poured whereas I had almost zero."

"I was excited to try some Bell's brews, and Knightly had a great selection, but I was underwhelmed/normal whelmed by the previous offerings (Pale Ale, Best Brown, respectively). But this brew really impressed me. There isn't a specific extra detail they added to the brew (anise, barrel-aging, coffee, etc), so it might not be the most unique, but it is superbly crafted and highly enjoyable. Well done to Bell's!"

"2010 vintage, poured from bottle into CBS Snifter. Pours a rich black color, nice tan head that recedes quickly. Some lacing. Beautiful so far. Smell- rich dark chocolate, molasses, roast, some mocha. Still plenty boozy. Man, after 2 yrs I would have thought this would mellow more. Its truly built for looong term cellaring, and I will be laying the rest that I have for awhile more. Taste- rich dark chocolate just coats my mouth. A touch of espresso hits the tongue and sides of mouth, followed by a nice roasty bitterness. This is just so complex. The booze doesn't present itself on the taste, it is really covered by the rich dark chocolate taste. Mouthfeel- still nice carbonation, super creamy and thick. This is a great beer. I am looking forward to seeing what else happens over time."

"This is quite a bold, warming sipper that really hasn't mellowed with more than a year of aging. It is medium to full bodied with an enjoyably low level of light carbonation. It is a fairly enjoyable brew but I much rather enjoy a stout that focuses more on roast and dryness than big fusel alcohol that is fruity. To each their own but this one doesn't quite do it for me."

"O: This is a huge beer. I told a friend the other day that this is Brooklyn Black Chocolate but more complex and bigger. It's a little hot fresh but I have a couple bottles I'm going to let hang out for a while. I think some age will pair wonderfully with this beer.

"Picked this beer up at Dirty Johns in Iowa City, IA. Beer pours a dark black color with a thick dark brown head. Smell is of roasted malts and caramel. Flavor of chocolate, malts, coffee, and carmel. Very intense flavor and very intense beer. Not sure if I was ready for this one yet."

"O-Really good stout. Recieved this as an extra in a trade, hopefully i come by another one next winter and let it age."
"This is an excellent beer. The roasted and burnt characters are really intense but they sort of walk right up to the line of unpleasantness but don't cross it. And that, in turn, makes it extremely enjoyable for me."

"Taste is profoundly rich, with heavy burnt dark chocolate malts developing across the palate. An exquisite Russian Imperial stout, worth seeking out for an enjoyable evening sipping experience."

"Overall - Simply put, you need to try this beer if you're able to get your hands on it. Any beer enthusiast should give this beer a try at least once."
"The Rest: Wow, this is one heavy beer. It's has so much body, it right on the border of being excessive. As a result, it hides its 10.5% very well. You only get some warming after a few swallows. While I enjoyed this beer, It is definitely a one-serving beast."
""
""
"Appearance was still an impressive, deep black with a very dark tan head. Little carbonation or head was left, perhaps partially a function of the age. Smell was rather sweet, with dark chocolate, soy sauce, smoke and tobacco notes. The taste was also sweet. A lot of malt, chocolate and some alcohol warmth. A few hoppy, earthy bitter notes were detectable in the finish, along with a little coffee. Mouthfeel was very thick and oily, lacking in carbonation. I need to try this one again fresh."

"Pours jet black into snifter with 1 finger tan head. Smells like a malt bomb - lots of coffee, a little chocolate maybe, slight booziness, minimal hops on the nose. Taste is just plain old big - lots and lots of flavors. Creamy burnt caramel smokiness, lots of heat, pretty typical of RIS's. Real sipper. To be honest, there was a bit too much booze for me. I know, it's a strong beer, but I've had many examples of Russian Imperial Stouts that haven't been quite as abrasive. So maybe this is a beer that I'll have to age for a while. Mouthfeel is nice, low to moderate carbonation (closer to low) which is pretty fitting. I will return to this beer later, hopefully with something nicer to say about it."

"O - Bells Expedition Stout is a fantastic Russian Imperial Stout. Another well done beer by Bells...well worth the time, expense and effort!"
"D/O: This imperial stout combines dark yeast and grain qualities with hops that stand out amongst the more traditional elements. It is an all-around respectable contribution, though heaviness and intensity do wear the palate down after a while."

"This is quite extreme, yet not at the same time. It's intense, but the flavors that are intense seem like they would mellow over a year or two of aging. This is yet another winner from Bell's. If I could get this in my area, I'd probably buy a case and age it all."

"Yet another amazing Bell's brew. I really wish I get could get beers like Expedition and Two Hearted here."
""
"Overall this is a high quality made stout but a bit too hoppy and charred malt forward for my liking. Lovers of dark porters and Russian Imperial Stouts will find this a great pleasure but my tastebuds have eschewed from enjoying these highly roasted and bitter flavors that I enjoyed early on in my craft beer lifetime. This probably needs at least 2 years in the cellar to be drinkable for my liking and to fully reach it's peak and hide the intense flavor profile."

"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I would like to buy a few more and cellar them for a couple years."

"Pours black with a thin layer of tan head. Nose is dark roasted malts, coffee beans & molasses. Taste is heavily coffee malt base, dark cocoa, roasted chocolate. Well rounded and smooth with no abv presence. Highly enjoyable Russian Imperial Stout. Will definitely pick up more when I see this beer on the shelves."
""
"O: Excellent sipper. The perfect beer on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"O- I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and can see why everyone loves it. My bottle was from this year, but I would love to let some age and see how the flavor and the amount of roast change. Hats off to Bells for making this great beer, and it's fairly easy to come by which is even better."

"This pours a dark, thick black with a cocoa colored layer of foam. Intensely roasty, and sharply so. Dry and bitter finish. There’s all sorts of dark roasty delicious things coming across in this brew—espresso and coffee and dark chocolate. Thick and lasting. I enjoyed taking this expedition, sip by sip."
""
""
""
"Expedition Stout embodies the RIS category. It's bold with roasty, sweet and bitter flavors. The Viscous mouthfeel sets it apart from most others."
"Overall this a silky smooth nicely balanced stout. It's still ready for more years ahead and I can't wait to see how this beer evolves. Its a wonderful representation of the style! 23 more to go :)"

"O -  Picked this up as a trade extra even though we normally get this beer in south Florida. Haven't seen it on shelves yet this season but planning to buy at least a couple six packs. Easily one of my favorite 12oz stouts and can't wait to get more. "

"Visiting Ohio for Christmas. I have spent that past few weeks hoping this beer would be accessible once I got back into the distribution area. Quarter Barrel in Oxford did me one better. This is a great beer. Well balanced and consistently delicious."
"This beer pours a dark brown to black color with a 1/2 mocha colored head. the smell is roasty and chocolatey, with a nice sweetness. the taste is pretty much spot on with the smell, the chocolate flavors are a little more pronounced the roastiness is subdued and finishes sweet. the mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. overall this is a great beer."

"O: have this before it warms up and you will be happy. It does not increase much in complexity when it warms, but the booze flavor and smell come out. This bottle was from less than 3 months ago - I'll age and rerate if it's different."

"Black with decent lace until the head disappeared about 10% into the beer. Aroma is dark roast coffee, raisins, and a whiff of alcohol. Soft mouthfeel, possibly a bit too soft (on the flat side). Oily rich body. Flavor makes me think of rum-raisin ice cream with a fair amount of sweetness, dried fruit, and a noticeable alcohol presence. Finish has a healthy bitterness to it."
"O: This is a delicious tummy warmer. I drank this before its prime to do the review, but I’ve got a second bottle of ‘10 and another from ‘09. I’m going to sit on these for awhile and hopefully collect some more vintages."

"very nice stout, love to try it again."

"Overall-This is a very enjoyable beer that does not taste like it contains the abv labeled. Disappointed with the appearance which was lacking lacing and the brown frothy head some people here have stated. However I enjoyed this beer and cannot wait to see how it taste after aging!"

""
"In sum: Looks good, smells good, taste is too dominated by the burnt/bitter/sour flavors for me to recommend fully, despite the fact that there's a lot of interesting things going on here."
"a solid tasting RIS, very nice burnt roast character. there is something i cant quite put my finger on that seems like it doesnt really belong, whether it be hops or yeast. but this is still something i would come back to."

"O: Big, boozy and bitter when fresh. Will have to try some aged vintages at see how it transforms, I bet it is amazing with a few years on it. An excellent big and complex stout for sure. Let this one warm up for sure."

"Bell's Expedition Stout is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. (please don't) Make this a limited release and its rating would skyrocket. Also, someone needs to send a bottle to the Bros for re-review."

"Overall - I enjoyed this beer more when I had it on tap a month or two back, but it is still great and one that I recommend for anyone looking for a nice stout for dessert."
""
""
""
"I split the 12 oz. bottle with the missus and some fudge brownies and that was enough; I suspect it would be pretty tough to finish the whole bottle, particularly if you’d already had a few others (as I had). Big and chewy and memorable. Wish I’d bought a few more to have on hand when the mood strikes."
"Poured into a pint glass.. Pitch black pour. An almost cinnamon in color head which is very tiny and disappears quickly. Smell is extremely malty.. Molasses, brown sugar, dark chocolate. Taste is the same kick.. Very malty.. Dark chocolate forward, caramel, brown sugar. Velvety, creamy mouth feel. Dark chocolate & Black coffee like bitterness lingering."

"O- Yeah, it'll get ya buzzed, but at what cost? Not the easiest stout to drink but, as the label implies, probably tastes much better with a a year or two of age."

""
""
"O: I think this beer is just alright. Having it fresh, I feel that it is a bit hot. But I've had it before with two years of age on it, and it was too sweet. Perhaps one year of age is the target for this beer. I'll have to save one, and try it again next November."

"None-more black black with about a tan finger that dissolves rather quickly. Smell has a touch of alcohol, molasses and black licorice. For being over a year old, it is still has a very bold taste. Coffee, chocolate and molasses still are noticeable. This could age much longer and still have some very distinguished notes. Heavy mouthfeel, creamy as well. For being over a year old, I would have liked some of the flavors to be more subdued. I will review the same batch a year from now. Still, its one of my favorites. Here's to the next 50 reviews!"
"Fabulous appearance. Deep, jet black with a thick, beige head that leaves a generous amount of lacing cascading down the sides of the snifter. Grandiose aroma of molasses, malt, charred roast, dark fruits. Dark fruits really emerge as the beer warms. Lots of charred, roasted malt as well. Full bodied, though not viscous or syrupy. A really solid beer, though there are several other imperial stouts I prefer to this."
"Had high hopes for this one, and Expedition Stout lived up to them. One of the best shelf RISes."
"Overall pretty tasty, but was quite surprised by this hop bitter presence."
"This is a good beer, but not an everyday go-to for me. It's bitter aftertaste is just a little abrasive for the style, I think."
"O: A very good one for the style, but definitely not appropriate for a beginner ! I would have preferred something lighter !"
"O: This has very boisterous flavors and is one of the only non-sweet Imperial Russian Stouts I've had."
"hop aromas are very faded. flavors in taste are more blended. better tasting. silky smooth body. better than 1 year. flavors are more mellow, but blended together better."
"O- A fantastic, albeit it huge, RIS. If you're up for a giant stout, Expedition fits the bill."
"Edit 11/25/2013: Had 2010 vintage bottle. Notes: Nose not nearly as boozy and dark fruits take center stage: fig, some black cherries, brown sugar as well. The palate has much more dark chocolate now that rides forever and ever, long after the swallow, still getting the fig and dark cherry flavors, only much stronger. Again, the booze has backed off considerably. Mouth feel is all liquid velvet, rich. Amazing with three years of age, and honestly, could be laid down for another three years. Wow. Score Edit: A-4.5 S-5 T-4.75 MF- 4.5 O-4.75"
"Pours like used motor oil and looks like used motor oil. No head. Syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor is good. Very sweet, brown sugar. I also get leathery prune, burnt raisins and coffee. Thick, heavy, low on carbonation, but with a nice bitter sharpness to the taste. Good beer, but for this style Old Rasputin is much better. I am a Bell's fan overall, but here they need to figure out a way to add some lighter dimension to this brew and cut down on the thickness."
"*finish- acidity and saltiness reduce to very light, all others same as initial. Long finish length, creamy mouthfeel, hits the middle of the tongue. Good body lacing."
"Very creamy, full-bodied brew that goes down smooth. Light carbonation. Dangerously drinkable...try to remember that this is a high octane beer!"
"Overall: Hint of alcoholic burn but not much considering abv. All in all, a great stout that drinks well and is a memorable beer. Would love to get this with a bit of age on it and see how it mellows."
"Overall: A really solid non -bals version of an imperial stout. I really enjoy the contrast between sweet sugars and charred malt. Really great brew."
"O - if you couldn't tell...I give it a 5. I'd probably give the regular expedition an A-, but age it a couple years and it's a solid A+ in my opinion...but you know, ""that's just like my opinion man"""
"Overall I thought this was a really good RIS. This beer was all about the heavily roasted dark malts, just like it should be, and it provided a nice amount of complexity. After smelling this beer I thought it was going to have a half and half mixture of chocolate and coffee flavors but instead it was dominated by the chocolate letting the coffee take a back seat, I liked this and I found it to be a little different then most of the other RIS's I have tried that have a pretty heavy coffee presence in the taste. For being 10.5% I thought the alcohol was hidden pretty well, some people claim that this beer needs two to three years of aging to calm down the booziness, and while I have no doubt this beer gets better with age, it drinks pretty well fresh and I didn't find it close at all to being overly boozy, and that made for some descent drinkability, I don't know if I would grab another bottle but one goes down pretty smooth and without a problem. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was pretty much what I look for in a good RIS, and the heavy chocolate presence was pretty nice. What I liked least about this beer was the carbonation, I would have liked it bumped up a couple notches. I will for sure be buying this beer again, it's a great local RIS, I haven't had an aged bottle of this beer before but I would definitely like to throw a couple bottles in the cellar to see how this beer develops over the years. If you love RIS's this is a must try. This is a very good RIS, I like it more then Old Rasputin. but it still doesn't knock off Founders Imperial Stout as my favorite RIS. Great job Bell's this is one hell of a beer from one hell of a brewing company, cheers. 2013 Update, I just had this years batch that was bottled in 7/26/13. It's good but it it's a little boozy fresh, I changed the scores accordingly."
"Pours black in body topped by coffee-with-milk head that stays. Mildy offensive aroma of bitter chocolate, earth and vegetation, booze, slight hazelnut. Tastes of cola, bitter dark chocolate, earth, a grapefruity hop presence, and booze with subtle cocoa nibs. Heavy in body with light carbonation. Offensive in almost all aspects."
"Had this beer in monks in Philly. Poured what looked to be black in the dim lighting. No head, I mean none. Roasted malt, vanilla were the dominating scents. Taste was toasty malts, some vanilla sweetness, had some char on the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit lacking, no carbonation, it needs a bit. Overall, a very nice stout."
"One of my favorite RIS’s for sure. This beer has so much to offer and while it is intended to be a sipper, it leaves you seeking more."
"Nice mouthfeel. The perfect way to relax when quality trumps quantity."
"O - A wonderful RIS! Do try!"
"Overall: A very good stout. I still have a few more saved which I will have to try again in a year. The bitterness is still fairly pronounced and a little mellowing of the flavors would make it much more drinkable. My only concern is that some of the fruity flavors may become too dominant."
"I expected the hop character to mellow after a year. but no such luck. It's good, but not for the price point."
"o: Much better than I remember. I had this on-tap years ago and I just didn't like it. Still, while this might get with time, there isn't enough here that I like to make we want to age any."
"O: I've heard so much about how good this beer is. Actually have had a bottle for 3-4 months now but hadn't gotten around to drinking it. Was going to do a Dark Lord for my 200th but had no body to share it with. Figured this would be adequate. Yes it was. Amazing beer. Don't know how it is fresh but drinking lovely right now."
"This is a beautifully thick beer, with a ton of carbonation, which really brings the flavors out. Lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. So very complex, with that inimitable Bell's malt flavor. Basically no hops and almost no alcohol burn, presumably because of the age."
"Some stouts get talked up a lot, and thus leave some others behind, but for my money, this is a phenomenal effin' beer that is as good, if not better than most of those aboard the hype train. Throw in that it's still available in six packs for a reasonable price, plus ages incredibly well - I just have to ask you, how can you go wrong?"
"O- I didn't enjoy this much as I expected I would. It's got a lot of the componants right, but a little more roasted, less sweet, and less boozy would be things I would prefer. I should probably buy one and age it."
"OA: would like a fresh bottle to make sure that nothing went wrong with this one in aging. Love the smell but almost let down by the taste. It isn't bad but its almost too complicated to enjoy. Reminds me a lot of the Stone Belgo Annise IRS"
"My favorite beer from Bell's was always Batch 9000 - and I should say I never particularly cared for Expedition fresh, always found it to be a bit astringent. With only a year of age on it this beer has just about dethroned it Batch 9K. Absolutely fantastic...highly recommend setting aside a few bottles for years to come."
"O: I might prefer Expedition Stout at two years, but the contents of this bottle pleased my palate. Two knocks on this beer: booze seems amplified and the finish borders on harsh. "
"Unfortunately, the Expedition's carbonation makes the flavor sharper than I'm usually accustomed to in a stout. Also, it smells like wet play-doh on the beach, which I was forced to endure every time I brought it up to my lips. Besides these complaints, this was a solid beer."
"Overall its a good beer and its my first RIS but in reality it doesn't fully live up to the hype"
"may try the next bottle with a cigar"
" the"
"D: a big bodied RIS. drinks like a rich red wine or glass of port. definitely a winter beer. or dessert. or at least cool weather. or at least dont drink it for breakfast. actually, go for it. and then go back to bed."
"O-Overall, I am very thrill to have tried this beer, happy I picked it up when I was in Ohio. I had a couple of beers from Bell's Brewing Company and I am thoroughly impressed with their brewing skills."
"O2: This beer is too roasted and burnt tasting for me. If it had a bit more molasses flavor, it would remind me of Nightstalker by GI. Although I dislike how sweet NightStalker comes across, this one comes out with too much of the burnt malts and not enough balance with the other flavors. (3)"
"It pours a solid black with about a centimeter of brown, bubbly head. It dissipates rather quickly, leaving a ring around the edges a patch of bubbles in the center. Small, wet patches of bubbles are left clinging to the walls of the glass. Smells of dark fruits, some hops, chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of caramel. There's certainly a lot here, at it seems quite balanced in the nose. It tastes of chocolate, some fruity hops as well as some darker fruits (plum, date), and a bit of vanilla in the beginning. Towards the end, some roasted malt, more chocolate, and caramel come through. Mouth is rich, thick, and a bit dry on the finish. Overall, a very good stout that I’d love to have again."
"o. good beer wish it was cheaper, way to easy to drink and no alcohol burn."
"O-- Good but not that great I thought. Massive, big sipper with a great look and nose but falls a bit flat in the taste and mouth. Good to try and to cellar but not something I would want a whole lot of."
"Overall a touch disappointing, maybe i'd built this up too much in my mind. Still a good beer, but failing to deliver the taste that was expected."
"I've reviewed this before from the bottle, but I was interested to see how this beer was on cask. To be honest, I was a little dubious about a beer this big, and with these flavors being able to make the transition nicely, but I was certainly wrong- it was very good indeed. I had this at the Atlanta Cask Ale Festival, and we're not talking a skimpy pour, but a good 1/2 nonic at least. Poured black, and quite bubbly, with good carbonation and quite a decent head, even with no sparkler and gravity poured. Nice aromas of espresso and licorice. Oh my, this tastes good! Beautiful and well integrated notes of espresso, licorice, chocolate, and roasted grains with a firm creaminess underpinning these flavors. The cask lends this beer a wonderful silkiness that puts it over the top. Very nice indeed!"
"O: this is a very drinkable beer. The abv is not really that detectable."
"NICE, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Big cocoa and earth aromas accompany a touch of whiskey, with an outstanding melded together complex flavor that follows the subtle nose. A stout that I highly recommend to anyone. Especially aged. Forget all the brewery only releases and just stock up on this stuff."
"O: Damn. Good. Beer. Nothing more you can really say. This one’s a beer-ager’s dream, with enough malt complexity and hop resins to keep it interesting for up to a decade in the cellar, I’m sure. As a self-described hophead, this is one of the rare stouts that totally succeeds in capturing the essence of those bitter green flowers. I’ll be working through a six-pack as a vertical in the next few years, I’m sure."
"Overall: Definitely solid, but it might need a little more time to polish off some of the rougher edges. Booze run a little high and the char flavors can be dominating. Still, it's solid and well worth the investment."
"I've been thinking of drinking more of what I've saved..great enjoyment and makes room for new beers in the rotation"
"O: If you like bitter, smokey stouts then you should definitely try this beer. I really enjoyed it."
"This is atypical of many stouts of similar ABV in that, although it really needs some more time to tone down, the alcohol bite is not overpowering. Rather, there are a ton of huge flavors that just need to coalesce and settle. I could see this drinking very well in a few months - or years - and would love to try an older bottle, but from my sample I can't deem this better than a slightly above-average RIS."
"This one kills me every time I drink, so much complexity packed into a 12 ounce bottle. Smells of dry cocoa, coffee, dark malts. Balanced out with a nice hop bill, but the beer focuses on the malt! Finishes a bit dryer than what I expect, but each sip garners in more complexity. A delicious treat and a beer that I want to have access to all of the time."
"An excellent Imperial Stout. Amazing. When I get such beers, I always regret I do not live in the US."
"O: This is a good RIS, with some pretty vinous characters and excellent hopping, all wrapped up in a strong caramel and dark roasted malt body."
"D - I could drink this forever, one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"O: I would say I like this a lot at this age,but I admit it needs more time. Still a bit hot, cant wait to try again with one to two years on her."
"I try to have these on hand at all times(make nice extra's for those that havent had) - Very nice beer!"
"Picked up a sixer of this at Whole Foods yesterday. What a fabulous stout. Worth every penny. Opaque would be a good word for how this looks in a glass, only because there isn't a word that describes something that's darker, and permits less light to travel through it. There was absolutely zero head on this as I poured it, and lacing is nonexistent. This is about as smooth as a stout gets. Subtle bourbon hints, chocolate, and coffee comprise the bulk of the flavor profile. Does NOT taste like it's 10.5% ABV. Did I mention it was smooth? What an awesome offering by Bell's. I'm so grateful I have 5 more bottles in the fridge. This is a beer I have every intention of returning to early and often."
"D-For a relatively high ABV stout this one is pretty drinkable with only a mild alcohol presence."
"Overall I must say this beat my expectations. I had to go to AZ to find this and I am happy I did. This beer packs a whallop in a 12 oz. pour and it makes me yearn for me. If all Bell's products are like this....I am beginning my quest."
"A wonderful, flavorful, and aromatic big stout. Would love to have this readily available. It does everything right."
"Overall this is a great stout, and not as expensive as some of the other RIS of its caliber."
"Edit - This beer gave me a pretty nasty headache, I didn't have anything else besides an amber, and it really tortured my skull. I downgraded the overall for this reason by .5 ! You've been warned ~_~"
"O: There's a big disparity between people and the bro's rating here and I feel confident the people have it right. I've had some average/mediocre RISs and this is definitely not one of them. Tons of complexity and plenty of delicious drinking to be enjoyed here."
"Huh, I see the bros re-tooled their review from a C- to a C."
"Pours black, hard pour gave it a nice 2 inch head. Smells of malt and alcohol. This seems like it's going to be hot. And it is. Tastes of a bit of malt, but it is an alcohol bomb. I want more depth! Very creamy mouthfeel, but the insane amount of alcohol on the tongue diminishes how creamy it really is. Overall....eh. Average at best."
"D- A nice stout. This one is more on the roasted bitterness side in malt character whereas i prefer more support in the form of sweeter toffee/chocolate malts than evident here. However, alcohol is smooth and the feel of the beer is thick and rich, as it should be."
"."
"Pours a deep dark black color with no head at all, rather disappointing. Smells of dark chocolate, sweet molasses, roasted malts very pronounced. Taste has rich chocolate notes, sweet roasted malts, slight bitterness from the hops, followed by dark fruit sweetness. Mouthfeel is heavy, chewy, creamy, pretty amazing. Full bodied but little carbonation. Overall, a very complex brew, nice and tastey, would like to have tried this aged a little bit longer, but a pretty damn good beer."
"Good solid stout. This, in my opinion, is missing a certain something however. Vanilla? Cherry? Oak? Not sure but its a bit too bitter, dry and not particularly complex. Good though."
"5/2/2011"
"Motor oil black, small head that leaves a bit on the glass as it dissipates. Coffee, roasted grains and dark, dried fruit (prunes?) on the nose. All of the above plus a bit of licorice on the nose. Stong bitterness from both hops and roasted malt. Sweetness that borders on cloying for me, but not quite too much. Very long finish, and low, but creamy, nicely integrated carbonation."
"O- I’ve heard mixed reviews about this beer, so I was not sure what to expect coming into this. I would have to say that I really enjoyed this brew, very good stout, big warming beer, with complex flavors, really easy drinkability, the abv is well hidden, although the carbonation was not there it did not take away from the beer IMO."
"O: This beer may have restored my faith in the RIS style. I went away from the style for a while, but recently decided to come back, and in the last couple of weeks have tried a handful of RIS’s, some of which are very highly ranked on this website. I was uniformly disappointed with them all, as they were mostly ruined by a dominating alcohol presence that killed the drink. Not this one. Expedition Stout maintains a great, well balanced flavor, good mouth feel and great drinkability. Cheers to Bell’s who never seems to let me down."
"Overall okay beer glad I held onto a few but I don't know if I will be buying more"
"Serving type: bottle/12oz."
"This beer pours out As black as most typical stouts do. The head is brown and pretty thick looking. The smell of the beer has some licorice and lots of roasted malts and a few light aromas of dark fruit. The taste of the beer is deeply roasted, with some burnt flavors in there. Light herbal notes and some dark chocolate in the mix. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side which is pretty nice. Overall I think it's a good brew it's not great but it's worth trying."
"D: A good RIS though not my favorite as it is a bit harsh overall for me. I would not buy again or order another."
"O-i've heard this ages well. it can't get any worse than this for me. i love stouts and this is one of the least enjoyable i've had. i'll probably give it one more try just because other people give it good reviews, and it's possible that i just had a bad bottle."
"overall, I'm a big fan of this beer. I like a huge stout that I want to chew on as it goes down. The lack of carbonation to me isnt a big factor, as this style shouldnt be too carbonated. Nice balance of lots of flavors. Im gonna throw two out of this sixer in the cellar and see how they come out."
"O - I think this was an oxidized bottle, not good."
"O - not a great brew but a solid one. My only complaints are the lack of carbonation and the acidic mouth feel."
"The mouth was hefty, chewy and just downright splendid. Palate-coating all the way. I dig it. The roasted aspects of the nose carry over to the flavor big time. This beer tastes charred, toasted, burnt -- whatever adjective you want to use. To the point that the sweet chocolate balance and the booze quality is drowned out completely. I hear all the time that this beer is at its best after a few years in a dark cellar, and after this fresh version, I think 'they' might be on to something."
"overall, i am glad to have tried this"
"O - Very glad I got to finally try this brew! Super complex flavors, flavors are quite difficult to separate... Thank you Another6Pack! A great brew to a great trade!"
"overall: while Expedition could use improvement, there is no reason not to consider this one of Bell's finest achievements."
"T: Big malt sweetness upfront with chocolate cake, molasses, cocoa powder and a touch of raisin in the mix. Finish is espresso, and dark coffee grounds. Nice bitterness and slight acidity on the finish. Mouthfeel is huge and syrupy. I love it. One of the best I've ever had."
"What I need to do soon is do a side by side taste test of Founders and Bell's Imperial Stouts because they both seem similar to me in that they improve with age."
"Great job Bell's, Cheers!!"
"Overall / Drinkability: A beer for sipping and savoring. I had it with burger and fries and it went wonderfully, but I could see having it alone and with dessert as well in place of coffee. The bitterness is a bit rough when the beer is cold, but it mellows out as the beer warms up, and indeed, I think the beer is better warmed up a bit. One a night with this impressive brew, but it will get purchased again - outstanding!"
"This is just a very solid stout - it's got a great mouth feel but a bitter and tanginess that inhibits the drinkability - it works for the style. Much better than I remembered it."
"Pours... black. Three fingers of dark khaki foam after an ambitious pour, with nice head retention and some lacing. Aroma is a big malty one, with some creaminess and dry fruitiness, spice and cinnamon thing going in the secondary. Taste is huge, mouthwatering roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, with a lingering, bitter finish. I think the acidity supports the beer well, but the bitterness on the finish is a little much. Medium carbonation and medium-full body are appropriate for the style, although the heat is noticeable. Overall, this is a well crafted, malt bomb of a stout, whose latter feature limits somewhat its drinkability."
"Overall: A very nice Imperial Stout that ages very well."
"This is a really good beer but not great. From everything I had read before I tried it I expected it to be in Old Rasputin, Plead the 5th, and Speedway Stouts class, but it was a clear step down for me. It was a good beer, its not one I will pass on, but if its sitting next to some of those other RIS’s I am going with those which I liked better."
"Pours pitch black with a small tan head that disappeared quickly leaving some good lacing. The smell is chocolate, dark fruit, coffee, some warm alcohol and it just screams, drink me. The taste is very sweet in the best way possible. It is sweet while still being so well balnced and drinkable. The beer is one of the thickest I've ever drank. Just coats your whole mouth with it's deliciousness. Overall, one of ypmy favorite beers."
"O: Quite nice. Form reading other reviews, I think that some of the coffee flavor subsided a little bit. No sign that the beer is 10.5%, even though its fuller body makes drinking more than 1-2 difficult."
"Cheers!"
"Full body, lighter carbonation, velvet smoothness and easy on the tongue. Drinks really nice, great feel, solid profile, and something I want again."
"Verdict: Not for the faint of palate, this needs to be tried (price be damned) to be believed..."
"Simply an excellent brew and a great example of the Russian imperial stout. Bell's has done it again!"
"O - You can NOT give this beer a bad review. For it's style, it's a winner. Great appearance, great flavor, great thickness. The only thing it's missing is something new....but it's still great!"
"O: My first Bell's and it didn't dissapoint. Looking forward to another selection with as much flavor"
"I enjoyed this brew very much and am currently in the search for one or two more singles, warm, to store and try at a later date."
"Overall- To be honest I kind of expected more from this one; it is very similar to a number of other imperial stouts and not as good as a few others although it does come through in many respects. The Smells are well balanced which translates to an equally balanced, smooth, and almost easy drinking taste. I would say this is Bell’s flagship beer but you could pick up a number of other Bell’s offerings and be just as satisfied but none the less a very solid offering. For the high price point I think I’ll just pick up the similar stouts and pass on this one in the future."
"Pours a pitch black, thick, with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a suttle hops. Fresh is a bit hot, which tends to mellow over time and become dangerously smooth. Definitely a wonderful beer that is readily available (when in season) and well priced. Buy and age this beer every year. This truly gets better every year."
"O - this is a very enjoyable beer it taste great making it way to easy to drink this one is worth seeking out to try sometime"
"O - A nice imperial stout. The dark fruits gave this one a different twist and was well combined in the flavor profile. Smooth and soft with each sip and finish. Had this paired with black forrest cake at a Bells beer dinner."
"O - A decent beer that was heavy in the mouth but not a true sipper. A very good RIS for being a shelf beer. Would have again."
"Fresh, this beer is pretty hot. After a year, it's totally transformed. I've never had a beer change more in a year than this one."
"Expedition has a nice high dark brown head which recedes and leaves some nice lacing. Good rich roasty aroma with a hint of chocolate and a bit of fruityness. The fruityness is not the most appealing, but not a big detractor. Taste is big and roasty as well with a bit of chocolate flavor. The fruity character receded leaving a nice smooth rich beer. Mouthfeel was good and creamy and smooth, and not too heavy."
"At 10.5%, one of these is just right for me!"
"Dark brown almost black opaque body, one finger light brown head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Divine nose, a combination of dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, a wee bit of coffee, and surprisingly a pretty robust hop aroma, citrus and pine resin, was able to shine through. The taste mirrors the nose, chocolatey goodness, leading to a fairly bitter resiny finish, nicely in balance. The mouthfeel is fairly astringent and sticky, which surprised the hell out of me. This is a really tasty beer, lthough the alcohol is still a bit hot at this juncture. ooking forward to trying later on once the hops have been tamed a bit on the remaining bottles aging down in The Hole. For fans of the style, a must. Outstanding."
"O: pretty average imperial stout. I probably won't buy it again, but wouldn't turn it down if given to me."
"O: This was my very first Expedition Stout. It was a little too boozy for my taste, which is why I'm going to hold on to the other 5 I have for about a year or so. Other than that, it was well above average. I'm anxiously awaiting the next bottle."
"Pours a thick motor oil black with a huge 3 inch dark chocolate colored head that fades to a puffy island in the middle of the glass. Nice rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malts, chocolate covered dark fruits, and whiffs of alcohol. Tastes of chocolate covered dark fruits (raisins), sweet chocolate caramel, and slight roasted coffee beans. This beer is super thick with low carbonation. It coats the mouth with each sip and is slightly cloying. There is a slight alcohol burn and cocoa powder bitterness on the palate with each sip. Overall, this is a good RIS but I was expecting something more from this one."
"O: Nice and roasty. 4."
"D-Overall i didn't really like this beer.It just didn't taste balanced and tasted alittle harsh and burnt. It has good smell but not taste. wont be reaching for this one again."
"A pretty solid RIS. I consider this a bigger and more flavorful Old Raspy. This beer is available at pretty much any store in the area that carries craft beer. True it's around 17-18 bucks a sixer, but definitely worth it if you're craving a big Russian Imperial. One of Bell's top beers IMO. I'd put this ahead of Founder Imperial."
"Thick and creamy, this beer coats your mouth and is only slightly sticky. A little stronger carbonation would have helped the drinkability, but it would not have improved it from being anything more than a sipper."
"O-> Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Really curious what a year or more would do for this big delcious brew. Would also love to try with some coffee heath ice cream or something along those lines. Would seek this out again for sure."
"Had a glass at Barley's in Greenville, SC."
"Overall: One of the best RIS I've had. This is complex but balanced. The alcohol is readily apparent but managed. Nice job here."
"overall - nice beer, big and toothy."
"overall: Really like this. got a 6 intending to age and i keep drinking."
"O- I would definitely buy this again. Not an exception life experience, but i could see this being on tap at my home bar."
"D - Amazing drinkability. Wouldn't believe this was nearly 11% if I hadn't already had it. Just as thick as I would want an imperial stout to be. One of the better stouts I've had recently."
"Drunk straight from the bottle in my hotel room in East Lansing Michigan, because drinking beer out of a coffee cup or slurpee cup just isn't right. However, stouts are like babies, they are all beautiful unless something goes wrong, so Expedition gets the benefit of the doubt on appearance. Bottle or no, the aroma isf reakin' spectacular. Deep hints of bourbon, malt, alcohol. I want to snort this beer. Despite an excellent, syrupy mouthfeel, there's something vaguely medicinal about Expedition in the mouth, so while the taste isn't bad, it isn't spectacular. Yes, I would absolutely do this beer again, but as far as stouts go it isn't quite up there with, say, Yeti or Surly Darkness."
"O-A readily available and high quality stout."
"The taste is powerful, sweet, and well supported by the thickness of the brew. It's a mix of bittersweet chocolate, caramel, some oak, a nice hint of sourness from the malt, and some alcohol. Finishes thick and a little bitter--coats the mouth so you must drink more. Not quite as overpowering as Bourbon County Stout, making it a little easier to keep drinking."
"Overall I was really surprised by this one. I tried a bottle of this last year but don't remember it being this good. I will cellar the last two from my six pack and see how good it is next year and the next."
"O - It's not a bad beer, but I've had a lot better and wouldn't really seek this out."
"O- A nice Imperial Stout that I am glad I got to try. The finish is a little hot, but besides that this is a good Stout that I would have again."
"Drinkability: If I could get another bottle or two of this beer, I would totally would. I've passed on this beer locally so to get a 3 year old bottle in trade as an extra is wickedly awesome. Thanks lackenhauser for the experience. The alcohol is definitely present in the nose, but the finish is definitely smoother than expected."
"O: Thick, sweet and very boozey. I found this beer interesting then hard to drink after just a few swigs. It seemed unbalanced in the way of too much booze and burnt."
"O - Very nice, particularly if you're a fan of dark-roast flavors."
"O - To say I was ""wowed"" by this is a gross understatement. I'm sad that I hadn't discovered this sooner, but now I know!"
"Very drinkable RIS here, even if it may not be my absolute favorite. I do like how this one is all malt, and they do a decent job of masking the alcohol considering the ABV."
"D: Overall, this is a good beer. It's tough to be a great beer with some many outstanding RIS's but this is a good example."
"Overall a nice beer. Too boozy right now to warrant higher ratings, but it has great potential."
"D - More alcohol detection in this one than I'd like. It's not very focused and doesn't find a real balance in the taste. The core dark fruit flavors just don't work very well. Combined with an average nose, and it's an okay example from Bell's."
"Overall - I loved this beer. Being a fan of coffee stouts, I couldn't get enough of this. An absolutely delicious beer."
"Amazing example of the style that is very drinkable at 10.5%. I have to admit that I had never heard of this until now. Regardless, I will most likely seek it out again."
"This beer pours a dark black color, with a creamybrown head. The smell is very malty. The taste is massivly heavy, lots of choclate and coffeflavors, an intense malt flavor. The flavor is going to linger and the alchool blends nicley. Overall may very well be the best stout i ever had, fantastic."
"O - It's not world class, but it is damn drinkable. Very tasty and pleasant, and the feel is intense. Very very full bodied, almost chewy. Michigan-area residents, color me jealous. To have access to this and FBS (nor to mention all the other great area beers) is like a dream come true. I've been on a bit of a tear lately with Saisons, Hefes, and other lighter beers, so this RIS hit me like a ton of bricks, and I loved every minute of it."
"O: Alcohol, for me, was not present in nose or taste which makes this dangerously drinkable...not that you would want to gulp this down anyway. Expedition is one to sit back, take your time with and enjoy its complexity."
"Tastes follows the nose closely, chocolate and roasted malts bittering initially, smooth sweet chocolate ending with a mix of lactic sour and burnt caramel. Nice creamy mouthfeel from the full bodied beer lightened slightly by the ample small bubble carbonation. Alcohol warmth on the back of the throat, but it sips nicely on a cool day."
"O- Very good beer for after dinner, before, or with not so much. It would be great with oily or heavy foods as it would cut through anything on the palate."
"D- Overall its an ok RIS. Would like to see the flavors blend together a bit better. But still can't complain about the good presence of lots of flavors. Like I said before, can't wait to age this one a bit and see what happens."
"overall its a winner, becoming one of my fav ris"
"Got this one as a gift from a friend. From the looks of other posts I'll buy a pack if I can find one and store it off for a while."
"Overall - Very tasty and potentially dangerous beer at 10.5% ABV. I've wanted to try this for a while, but being unavailable in NJ my only options were to buy a case in PA or trade. I've traded and received this one, and it has shown me that buying a case is a must"
"O: How it has taken me this long to review one of my favorite RISs, I cannot say. This is easily one of the most underrated examples of the style. Is it because it is too available, too commonplace? This brew is as delicious as many of the sought-after rarities, but doesn't get the credit. All I have to say is that this is a damn fine beer, and, Jason, shame on you."
"Pours opaque black and thick. Heavy pour results in no head at first, but then comes exploding out of solution in a deep orange yellow color. Aroma is toffee, caramel, molasses, vanilla, a hint of cinnamon, mild coffee. Flavor is very robust. A little sweeter than I expected. Well-rounded thick palate. Mild lacing. The real deal."
"Its very drinkable at 10.5% and although the metallic taste is hindering this review I will say it has potential."
"D: i could drink these down and not even realize i'd had so many. i would indeed search this brew out."
"Drinkability - This Stout is extremely nice in my opinion. It's strong, so that may exclude some from liking it and it may hurt with overall drinkability for them, but it's still very, very good. Worth a try if you are a Stout lover. I know I am, so therefore I do love this beer. This beer would be perfect on a cold night by the fireplace just sipping."
"Mouthfeel is thick and very chewy. It's a big, bold beer and a great after dinner sipper. One of the best RIS I have encountered."
"Overall - pretty good stout. Very strong alcohol taste though. Nice after dinner beer."
"Overall i think that the apperance and aroma over the expedition was very misleading when the flavor comes into play. I dont know if this bottle was old but its no bueno in my book... thus far."
"D - Very good drinkability, too bad Bell's dosen't distrubute to Las Vegas..."
"for me this stout is right up there with ten fidy, my current favorite readily available stout. based on the burnt flavors, and dark chocolate, this beer really appeals to my tastes."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. Tons of body and quite slick in the mouth without being overly sweet on the finish. Perfect mouthfeel for style. Flavor lingers forever on the palate making this a perfect sipping beer on a cold winter day. This brew is fairly warm as it goes down which is not surprising considering the 10.5% ABV. Drinkability is good for style, not great. Overall a very well done RIS. I'd rate it almost perfect if it wasn't for the lack of complexity in the flavor. Very glad I got a chance to try this one."
"d- this is a sipper for a nice cold night, it wasn't as wonderful as i was expecting but certainly drinkable, and I won't have any trouble drinking the remaining single i have on hand - might throw in in the cellar for a year or so."
"Drinkability - a little bitter but not too bad for my taste. Somewhat complex, and tastes okay."
"D - This is the third or fourth time I've had this beer and I must admit that the first time I tried it I wasn't blown away. However, I have to say that each time I drink this I am more and more impressed. At the same time, this isn't my favorite RIS and I think it's because of the citrusy/grapefruity hop flavors. I will definitely recommend this beer, but only drink one because the 10.5% ABV packs a punch. And judging by the number of misspelled reviews of this beer I would say I'm not the only one that has felt its effects."
"D - the alcohol makes it tough to drink a lot but I'd still live another."
"D - It's about as drinkable as any other RIS. It's a true sipper that gets nice with a little warmth. Not sure I could drink more than a bottle in one sitting. Glad I got two bottles in a trade so I can age the other."
"D- One and done on this fantastic brew! I could have one everyday, but then move on to something a bit less thick and hearty! It's a sipper for sure... I am in love!!!"
"Flavor follows suit. Molasses and chocolate and coffee grounds. The dark fruit component is very strong. Thick mouthfeel, quite viscous and slick. A little hard on the drinkability but a full bodied and fruity stout."
"Poured a black opaque color with a dark beige to toffee colored head, that is about a quarter inch high. The head then dissolves itself to a thin layer just on top off the blackness. Dark bread and dried fruit are there at first scent, then dark roasted grain and coffee hits the nose. Then a twang of alcohol comes forward, that all blends to a sweet molasses scent at the end. A sweet malty and sugary taste is at the front, then dark bread and burnt coffee flavors take over. It finishes with a strong piney and grassy bitterness that lingers long after each taste is gone. A medium-heavy feel rolls on to the palate and stays consistent, till it reaches the back of the palate, where it thins out slightly. A strong beer in this style, where other brewers dominate this with string and overwhelming flavors, Bell's works to keep this beer on the straight and narrow. Sit back, sip this one slowly and enjoy."
"D - Incredibly tasty, smooth, delightful.. But it's pretty big."
"D - Some stouts just aren't as good on nitro... and this ain't one of 'em! One of my favorite RISs just got even better! Delicious!"
"Another very good beer from Bell's, I have yet to be underwhelmed with any of their offerings. Can't wait to see what this one turns into in about a year."
"Underimpressed. Maybe I will try aging one and revisiting this one."
"D- I'm going to end up draining this glass a lot more quickly than I was planning. While I probably won't have multiple of these in an evening, this is a very drinkable beer, it's gone down smoothly and it's been fantastic."
"D: You don't want to drink this quickly not just b/c of the high ABV, but b/c it tastes so damn good. I couldn't believe this was 10.5%. You can taste the booze, but I had no idea it was that high. This could be a dangerous one."
"D: It's definitely easy to sip/drink just like most of Bell's I've had so far. I tasted/drank in a lot of high quality in this one."
"D: Drinkability is fairly high for the style. I could drink a few of these before the ABV catches up."
"D: Uh-huh. This must be an acquired taste."
"D- I could drink a few of these (limited to 3)."
"some nice bright tang in my mouth....an alive feeling beer!"
"D: Relatively easy to drink at 10.5%, but the alcohol is still fairly present even 2 years after bottling. At times the smokiness was too much but once it faded a little, the beer was quite enjoyable"
"D. For being a strong full bodied beer it goes down nicely. This is one that I'll gladly buy again. Not perfect, but still good."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. One of the better Russian Imperial Stouts that is widely available. Another fine offering from Bell's."
"Pours a midnight black with a thin chocolate head that disappears fairly quickly. No light coming from this big beer. The smell is not as strong as the taste, but you get chocolate, coffee and a little hops which increase as this one warms up. The taste is great- chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, hops all make their appearance known. Definite alcohol burn on the aftertaste, but it's a 10.5% beer, so I don't hold that against it. Still, I've had beers in this style w/ this ABV that hide their alcohol a little better. Really get a bitter coffee in the aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is smooth, but there's an edge to it as well.. Drinkibility is good, might be a little better if the alcohol was better masked. All in all though, this is a great beer. I keep thinking I'll age some, but they never make it very long in my fridge.... Cheers!"
"Drinkability is above average. I'm enjoying the glass in front of me, but there are better RIS's out there. I would probably pick up a pack of Old Rasputin over this any day. However, I've heard from some people that this turns into a gem with some decent age on it, so I'll probably save my other 2009 bottle for another 3-5 years. Worth checking out, but I think Bell's can do better."
"Drink- I was expecting a bit more but still pretty good. I give it high marks."
"I've had prior years of this beer that were wonderful, but I must say that this year is drinking OUTSTANDING right now. I wish I had thought of getting a sixer sooner as it is tough to find now!"
"O: A solid offering from the folks at Bell's. If it had a bit more flavor at the front end it would be a home run."
" I was a little disappointed in this brew after many excellent beers from Bell's."
"D-I almost broke my no drain pouring rule with this beer. I wonder if I got a bad bottle or if my taste buds just weren't made for this beer. This is a fresh bottle and a bought another one to age, after reading about it's impressive aging abilities, so I'll give it another chance."
"This stout is not one of them."
"Very much a sipper, but since it takes a while to enjoy one of these, having two of these would make for a nice leisurely drinking evening."
"D - Not what I remember this one tasting like. Kind of a bitter burnt flavor takes this one down a notch with me."
"Cheers..."
"Thick Thick beer. My daughter asked me for a sip of my rootbeer float because of the thick creamy head it had.Then she smelt it and asked me if it was a chocolate and raisin milk shake. It has a nice thick coats your tongue feel with a choclate and rasin taste so my sweet pea nailed it. I am a hops man so I say it is O.K. I'll drink one of these at a time when I am in the mood for a thick stout. I just enjoy all the best beers in the world that South West Michigan brews and brings to my table. Now I need a Hopslam!"
"Drinks average. A nice beer but not especially high on my list of have again beers."
"D - Another fine offering from Bells. I am pretty glad that I have another to drink...but I think I'll save it for another time. This is a good beer, but in the world of RIS, there are some mind boggling beers for fans of the style. Definitely worth checking out, but a bit too dry and bitter for me. The nose was the clear highlight."
"Overall a great stout and makes for a great desert beer pairs with Black Forest Cherry Cake I'd say."
"One of these is enough for me in a night. I have had several but the abv does show after the second one. It is hidden but you will feel it kind of quickly. I often forget how good this beer is. It only gets smoother with age. Fresh it is a bit hot but with some time on it, it will taste phenomenal. One of the best stouts out there."
"D: Not bad, not my favorite but good. I would revisit this again and im glad i tried it, i think Bells make great stuff and am usually immpressed, but i guess i am a little disappointed with the RIS."
"Overall, a solid brew from Bell's. I have had better RISs from other outfits, but this is a good one that I'd enjoy again down the road."
"Notes: Not bad, but some of the flavors clash or seem harsh. Time in the cellar would probably work wonders and smooth out this brew."
"This beer pours an oily, viscous, syrupy, midnight black with a one finger beautiful dark khaki, soapy looking, head. It smells of rich, dark roasted malts with some bitter chocolate present. I love the flavors the Expedition presents. It's chocolatey, rich, has a good amount of coffee, and has this smokiness that reminds me of smoked wood chips. As far as mouthfeel is concerned, this is about as smooth as you could want for the style. It is very, very smooth and full in body. This is one of Bell's best brews hands down. The sweetness can be a little much the more you drink it but it is definitely a great RIS."
"D - This beer is delicious and I am mad that I've passed it over time and time again. It is a good reliable stout that is as accessible as Old Rasputin. Very delicious and not too boozy. Watch for the hidden 10.5%. (4.0)"
"Drinkability is hurt by alcohol and flavor density, meant for a snifter, not a liter mug"
"I think the Bros. are a little off with the grade on this one. An excellent RIS."
"D- Complex flavors get destroyed with bitter medicinal finish. Booze burn isn't well hidden either."
"D: Rich flavors and a well rounded stout, that comes in a six pack, yes. . super drinkable. This stout takes the cake over the rest of Bell's additions."
"D - Nice characteristics, but far too sweet for my tongue. Not a bad brew, but not one I'd wish to revisit."
"Drinkability: With how insanely silky smooth this stout is, the taste could be bottle sludge and I would love it. Ok, maybe that's a little bit much, but the taste is damn solid. This beer definitely deserves its accolades."
"D: I think one bottle is enough, but this is a fine beer indeed. One that can certainly hold up to (and in some cases, benefit from) again."
"D - Goes down smooth, but the lack of carbonation makes it a bit too bitter."
"Easy to drink and so rich that it completely hides its high abv. Drinks slowly from the richness, not from heaviness or alcohol."
"D - Fine for the style, the booze hits a little harder then I'd prefer with a definite bite in every sip."
"I bought a six pack of these bottles to try. After trying the first two I am definitely cellaring the other four. I'll try one three months from now and review again. I think a little more time will lessen the taste of alcohol, and really allow the other flavors to shine."
"I really like this beer. Surely one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"I can feel the booze after 1, but I could probably drink 2 of these. "
"Potent alcohol bite with a chewy, patent malt bitterness. The flavor is closest to espresso. There's a decent dollop of hop bitterness in the swallow. The brew is very thick, like half and half cream. This is enhanced by a lower level of carbonation. I think this would go very nicely with a tart dessert."
"A nice, unique (for good and bad) Imperial Stout. Not my favorite, but very good nonetheless."
"Poured from bottle into dimple glass. Was pleasantly surprised with this one! Pours a deep, oily opaque, still black. No signs of carbonation, thin tan head. Aroma is fairly complex, black pepper corn, smoke, roasted malts, coffee, licorice, chocolate and caramel. Flavor is sweet and sugary, molasses, caramelized sugar, toast, coffee grounds, dark chocolate and wood. Very thick on the tongue, heavy in the mouth, a bit of fire from the alcohol and some lasting coffee bitterness at the end which was welcoming for me."
"Overall drinkable beer. Could drink 1 or 2 pints no problem."
"Recommended vintage: Fresh-2 years or older. Bells doesn't give a best by as per their website, so your patience is the limit as far as this beer is concerned."
"The CPJ"
"Overall it's a little heavy and it's an ok beer. I would have it again but I don't think it's top 100 worthy"
"this is probably my go to, everyday, big stout in the cold months."
"No doubt this is one of the better Imperial Stouts out there. I've always enjoyed it, it's a fun beer to drink."
"Huge robust flavors, dark smoky chocolate, charred meat, raisins and burnt caramel. As I let my glass warm up a little bit more and more espresso flavors are coming out with faint earthy hops that have faded greatly. Very thick on the mouthfeel, mouse, creamy and very thick and long lasting finish that coasts your throat like cough syrup."
"D - a little too dry in the finish to be easily drinkable, but still very good. One bottle's plenty as the alcohol is rather noticeable. Pairs extremely well with pumpkin pie creme brulee. Could've used another year or two of age on it."
"From a bottle, poured into a pint glass. A hard pour produced a slow building, 2 finger mocha head. Heavy lacing follows this one down the side of the glass. Appears a deep black, with no light penetrating. Smell up front is of raisin and plum, then a deeper coffee and slightly chocolate aroma follows. Taste follows smell, with a roasty bitterness that is not at all overwhelming. Mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy, but finishes rather dry. Nice. Overall this is a fairly drinkable RIS, and one I will have again"
"D - Fairly high. I really like this one a lot but it can become overpowering after the first glass. I could have one or two of these but that would be about all."
"That said, at 10.5% ABV this is definitely something I'd like to cellar and open next winter. Very probable that the sweetness would mellow and the chocolate and smoke would be more present."
"I'm kinda disappointed by this beer. I'm a big fan of Bell's Two Hearted and this fell short for me. It's an okay stout, but it's lacking something. I'll finish off the 6-pack but I can't see buying another, especially at what it cost me. Also the 10.5% ABV makes this prohibitive for me to drink on a regular basis. It's not a session beer or weeknight with dinner beer and when I want something for a special occasion I want something more impressive than this."
"Expedition stout! I have had this beer out of the bottle, on tap, on handpull, fresh, slightly aged, 10 years old and enjoyed it each time. This might be my favorite beer of all time. Pours pitch black, huge aroma of roast and bitter hops, chocolate and even a touch of bitter licorice. Taste is much the same, fills the mouth and coats the tongue. A great sipper that is complex and full of flavor. Good stuff."
"EDIT: By FAR my favorite non-barrel aged Imperial Stout. Just can't get enough of this magical brew. Numerous batches, numerous years at a variety of ages and they're all fantastic in their own way. Age certainly benefits this one as well and I can't wait to try some extended aging well beyond 2 years on this one."
"Is a decent drinker and I could buy another single, but nothing mind blowing, just a decent stout from a good brewery."
"D: Wonderful RIS. A bit rough in the finish, but I'm loving the mouthfeel. I could see this being even better if it were aged longer than 13 months."
"D- Pretty high. I love this style and I could drink these all day. Very smooth at a year old with an even sweet-bitter balance."
"Drinkabilty - Its so strong, and at 10.5%, no more then 1-2 and done. But, you will love each drink espcially as this beer warms up, it really comes alive. Fantasic, made my top 10 RIS list for sure."
"Pours pitch black with a dark brown full head. The smell just fills the room once the cap has been cracked...phenomenal. Rich aromas of bourbon, tobacco, sweet and bitter dark chocolate, copious amounts of coffee. There is also a bit of a hoppy bite in the aroma. The flavor is just spot on. Rich oily mouthfeel gives flavors that are close to the nose. Bitter roasted coffee and dark chocolate are the most accessible flavors with those heavily roasted malts coming across with such brilliance. Tobacco and toffee combine with molasses to give an incredible complexity. This beer also has that 'raw' edge that I love in stouts so much. The finish is long, dry, and lingering. This beer provides everything I look for in a RIS and leaves nothing undone. This is just wonderful"
"D- Too drinkable. I only bought one of these which makes me a little sad, as I really have to drink this slower than I want to. It's good for very easy drinking without being watered down or having weak flavor. The 10.5% is there and easy to notice, but not overbearing and it didn't take away from the experience at all for me. I'll get a 6pk of this next time for sure rather than the single."
"Now if only the Eagles would come back and beat the Giants in this game, life would be perfect (mostly)."
"D: Outstanding for such a huge beer."
"Taste: The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy, which perfectly exemplifies the flavor experience that follows. Though subtle, the complexity is there: roasted coffee, chocolate, and a little caramel; brown sugar; molasses; the dark fruit plum, cherry, and raisin from the smell; and the spiced rum-like tingle of alcohol. Though it sounds crazy, I seriously think I taste a little bready, Belgian yeast. The roasted coffee leaves a nice, bitter aftertaste, which sometimes pushed my bitterness threshold as the pint warmed."
"D - A nice Russian Imperial Stout. Really drinkable as I do not detect as much alcohol as others do in the reviews Ive read. Although that being said one maybe two of these and thats it. Its so rich, thick, and chewy which makes it a nice slow sipper."
"D: Highly drinkable, and good to the very last drop."
"black with a darker head than most stouts big lacing from the head with a slight film on the side of the glass reminiscent of wine lacing. big dark fruit and alcohol in the nose right up front. sweetness as well. wow, the flavor is strong and out of control. first strong bitterness and then roasted coffee, which was not present in the smell. definitely makes you pull back and sip on her and unfortunately it's not as good as I expected. Though it has some potential, seems a little too fresh for me."
"D - Incredibly smooth...the intensely burnt character is a bit on the intense side and limits the drinkability a bit. Perhaps it just serves to slow me down a little bit in emptying this glass, which is probably a good thing considering the strength of this beer. I'd definitely be up for another one right now if it was available."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Jet black pour, slight white head, minimal lacing. The aroma has a ton of molases, dark fruit, and alchohol. It taste like it smells, sweet molases, and dates. It does have a lingering alcohol burn, along with a sweet finish. Definitely a full bodied sipper. It has a nice creamy mouth feel, the carbonation is fair. A very good RIS."
"Just an amazing beer, I will definately be picking some up to cellar, I am interested to see how this beer tastes with a couple of years on it."
"This is a beer that ranks in my top five, hands down. So rich, so complex, I wish I had some to share with my friends. This beer is exactly why I love this style so much."
"D - I rank it low in drinkability because the high alcohol content is not masked at all. It is too overwhelming. You are done after 1, even though the taste is excellent."
"In other words, it's not the best I've ever had but solid nonetheless. I'm looking forward to re-visiting the rest of the six pack I bought. Although it was a little on the pricy side."
"this was delicious. as far as fresh, its far better on tap. bottles need age, tap does not."
"D - Being the lightweight that I am, one is definitely enough, but the overall character of this stout makes every sip a pleasure"
"The feel of this beer is big, with a high ABV giving this beer a punch that was unexpected, this beer has you on the ropes. A really fascinating stout."
"I was disappointed. I've not had this beer before and thought one that was aged a year (or more) might be better. I'll try this fresh and see if I like it better."
"D- I've got a couple of bottles aging, I wonder what that would to do the flavors in this one...I think I'd like it a little better with the age on it"
"Overall, this beer seems like a more robust, thicker, more alcoholic version of Storm King, which lasts with me throughout the experience. I'm hoping some of the bitterness will round out more as it ages."
"For a RIS this might be the smoothest I have ever had."
"Pours black with a tan head that quickly goes down. There is not much head to speak of. Aroma is malty with hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel. The alcohol slightly stings my nose. Paired with Thanksgiving dessert of apple pie and pumpkin pie. Tastes go well together. Slightly bitter with a taste of bittersweet dark chocolate. Coffee tones work into the mouth. I expected this to be a little tougher to drink with a 10% abv, but the alcohol is not overwhelming and drinks quite easily. Probably not a beer I would have more than two of though."
"Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of toffee, caramel, and hints of dark fruit. Yeah, this is a good stout. You have the sweet hitting the front of the tongue, the bitters on the back with hints of smoke. You can also taste sweet caramel and some coffee/toffee flavor. Ultra complex, but everything is work so well. A rich beer. Love it."
"Pours a heavy and thick black with a short milk chocolate brown head, both thick and creamy. Tons of beautiful lace. So much in the nose in terms of dark fruits (figs, plums), licorice, molasses and a touch of milk chocolate. Molasses and dark fruits lead the charge on the tongue, and flows effortlessly into some bitter dark chocolate and dry coffee beans. Finishes slightly dry as a result, full and syrupy with a ton of body. Excellent mouthfeel and outstanding drinkability for the alcohol content. One of the best I've had, easily."
"A decent RIS. A bit overhyped IMO."
"D - not more than 1 in a sitting, but can't wait to taste some with 3-4 yrs on them."
"Get it. This is a new favorite of mine"
"D: It really pains me to no end to state this, but I feel there are at least five other Imperial Stouts in the immediate area that blow this out of the water. Still, I totally respect this beer."
"I've been drinking some 08's right now and it's drinking like an A+ beer. The heat has settled down and it's just fantastic with a couple of years on it."
"D: This is wonderful. I recommend it."
"Served from tap into an imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a minimal amount of tan head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, alcohol, and molasses. The flavor ws of roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. The alcohol on it was very warming to say the least. Had a nice flavor and aroma to it. However, the aroma was very weak to start out but upon warming it was dominated by alcohol. This brew is a must try for any stout or boozy beer lover out there for sure."
"One of the chewiest beers I can remember, this is dry and sticky on the palate. A little hot but perfectly manageable. If the abv were any lower the ingredients would simply call the beer a pussy until it manned up and became stronger anyway. Drinkability is good, and is bumped up a notch because I will order this beer anytime it is available. Possibly my favorite Bell's offering at this point!"
"D - I would say this is a pretty drinkable beer considering the ABV. It goes down nice and easy. This is a perfect beer for the colder months. This is a great RIS and I would recommend it to anyone. Great job Bells. Cheers."
"The mouth-feel was too thick and coupled with the ABV, it did not go down very smoothly. The beer was also really syrupy. It proved to be much harder to drink that I would have liked."
"Overall, although it is not potently boozy, the flavors are dense (but I wouldn't characterize them as ""rich""), making it readily apparent that this beer is a force. I sipped it slowly and enjoyed it, but I don't know how often I would go back for more."
"Good stout. Poured black with dark brown head, good lacing. Had a little burn on the end that didn't make it 100% smooth but still good. I can oversee that since I'm used to it. Going to get another one soon and I'm going to age that one and see how it tastes."
"This beer pours a deep darkness with a frothy stiff slow dissolving (if at all) tan foam that leaves beautiful lacing. The smell is oddly more hoppy than it is roasted. There is a bit of coffee in the back but not strong in the slightest. It's still a good aroma, but the mixture of hop and rum is a weird. The flavor is has oak, smokey chipotle pepper, with some booze. The booze is really the only off-putting part about the flavor. It could do well with some aging. There is a bitterness from the booze, but it still goes down real nice. If you sip it it drinks real well. Honestly it's good, but disappointing."
"D - At 10.5%, Expedition carries itself really well, which is definitely a benefit of aging for one year. However, it's kind of disappointing because it doesn't coalesce into a total package. This is the only bottle I put away last year, but I think I'll grab some this year with some to age for 2-3 years."
"D - Well the price is similar to Founders which seems a bit smoother but I did like it as an imperial stout. Heavy but good beer."
"Beer pours out a midnight black with a very dark brown head, some lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some stale hops. Yep, might be a great candidate for cellaring, but I wish I could get a fresh hoppy sample, i.e. no date code. Anyway, taste is dark bittersweet chocolate, some hints of coffee/espresso, and some bitter leaf hop. Has a decent carbonation so its, fairly smooth....but I really wish the hops were still present in their fruity/spiceyness doing their thing. The taste still has a nice interplay and balance between the roasted malts and the bittering hop. Sooo, as you can tell I am not a fan of cellaring cause the hops lose their flavor and have that weird faded hops taste, like this beer has. Funny, too the label suggests cellaring, no thanks. I will have to take a few points off because I have no idea the freshness of this or any Bell's beers, so the best category to adjust would have to be drinkability, although if were fresher it would easily rate a ""4" or higher, very smooth and quite drinkable for 10.5% abv! I think this beer would pair well with a Thanksgiving dessert or a crisp bar of Lindt 70% dark chocolate, ;-)"
"D: This is good, very good, but a def. sipper. I want to drink this all night, but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be a good idea for tomorrow me."
"D - This is a sipper for sure but it's enjoyable all the way."
"I'd recommend it."
"Taste-Dark roasted coffee, baker's chocolate, charred steak, nice hop bite. Big, bold character, complex and flavorful. Have one now and cellar one for later. Top-notch Russian Imperial."
"GREAT BEER!!!"
"Overall impression: If, like me, you are surprised to find this on tap, don't hesitate to take advantage of your good fortune."
"(36th)"
"o: very tasty, I think I am going to have to start saving a bottle or two of this every season."
"I had this same batch earlier this year and it has aged very well. The flavors come together very well with age."
"Pours pitch black with light carbonation. What foam there is settles quickly and after while this looks like espresso in my snifter. Intense aroma of cocoa and burnt grains. Taste is aggressive; dark molasses mixes with bitter hops and cocoa. Gets a touch before an intensely bitter finish. Feels thick. Awesome stuff. this world needs more Imperial Stouts and fewer Imperial IPAs. That said, this needs needs to sit for at LEAST a year. Don't attempt to drink this stuff fresh, it'll scar your tastebuds."
"Pours a jet black, extremely viscous color with a tiny, almost non existent deep mocha head. Pitch black and syrupy. Really nice dark chocolate, some roasted espresso and a tinge of vanilla on the nose. Really complex. I get some booze on the nose. The flavors are huge roasted malts, dark chocolate and a touch of espresso. Some shaved coconut also and a finish that lasts very long. Boozy dryness on the backend. The mouthfeel is near perfect. Viscous and thick but easy to swirl around the palate. There is a big rich brownie like mouthfeel and a great dry finish. Drinkability also is good, but too thick and rich for an every day drinker. It's a great stout and really worth looking for."
"D - again, lack of carbonation and bitter taste made it hard to finish the bottle"
"- this was a fairly easy down for a single glass but im not sure i would want to drink this all night, but that is also just my preference in beer. very tasty, if a bit unwieldy. will drink again. not sure if i can differentiate between good stouts and the great stouts yet at my level but i would say pretty good."
"D - This is a really dangerous beer for me to have. Unfortunately its not one i can easily obtain on the west coast. Its very well rounded, and not boozy making it extremely quaffable."
"Considering my preferences for such a stout, everything about Expedition screams, ""hell yeah, drinkability."" It's all the more impressive how well hidden is the alcohol. I've enjoyed the six pack over many months & am slightly bummed they're now gone. I'll be getting more next release."
"D - I drink one or two now, but would much rather let them sit for a year or two."
"D: it drank pretty good considering the ABV but I'm not much of a hoppy RIS type of dude I would much rather stick to the ones that aren't as bitter on the finish. Even though it had a quality I didn't like it was still damn tasty."
"Overall, a good stout. I look forward to drinking a bottle a year from now to see how it compares!"
"Good RIS that I would recommend for people to try."
"Pitch black under a thin, creamy tan head. Aromas of lightly boozy fruit (apples and berries) esters and chocolate. Big, rich chocolatey malt flavor...sweet berry, espresso, molasses...loads of big, rich malty goodness. Thick, smooth, lightly bitter mouthfeel. Drinkable, but dangerous. Good stuff for sure..."
"2009 vintage on cask at The Busy Bee served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a thin light tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of roasted malts, fresh ground coffee and baker's cocoa. The taste is loads of smooth roasted malts, bitter cocoa, molasses, espresso, dried fruits and a hint of oak, incredibly complex! The beer is unbelievably smooth and easy drinking for its strength. I really have to say, this is possibly the best cask beer I've ever had, I certainly want more!"
"Black pour with a nice, light-weight brown head. Aroma of subtle roast, a little chocolate and some mild, bitter coffee, vanilla, a little alcohol, some figs and other dark fruits and berries. Taste is also well-balanced and rounded, with hints of liqourice, soy, bitter chocolate and a little coffee. A lovely bitter finish, with some faint hop-notes. Very complex and pleasant at the same time."
"Drinkability:"
"Maybe you won't drink more than 2 of these in any one sitting, but it'll always be worth the trip when you choose to do so."
"D - Okay, but this is a pretty big beer. Thick and rich makes it quite challenging to put down more than a bottle of this in a single sitting."
"If you're used to drinking RIPs, you'll love this example once you start to drink it. There's nothing special to make it stand out, but it is a solid effort"
"Overall, I gotta say I prefer the aged on tap version."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The aroma is very delighting and ever so present. Very dark, almost black with a brownish head. Upon drinking, it has a very big mouth feel and completely coats the mouth with a roasty malted flavorful explosion of stout-ness. Very nice stout but also on the pricey side."
"This is an excellent beer. It is very powerful, you can taste the roasted, malty flavor and is one of the rare, high powered stouts that you can drink a few of without falling off your chair. I wish it came in a bomber."
" * PS. LET THIS WARM or all you will get is bitterness!"
"Drinkability: Challenging but delicious."
"drinkability: not over rated. it's world class."
"Thoughts: I think the bros had a batch much different from this one. This is probably the 09 or 2010 batch and its a really nice beer. I think its a good example of the style."
"A solid beer overall, but the burnt-grain taste definitely hurts this brew."
"Cheers!"
"I'd have to say that Bells Expedition Stout gets a tasty noms. :)"
"Bottle with no batch number but I am pretty sure I got this a year or 2 ago. Pours a dep dark brown/black color with a farily thick 1 finger head. Aromas of some sweet malts with dark fruit, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is extremely layered with a nice thick and creamy heavy mouthfeel. Sweet dark chocolate up front followed by roast coffee and leather. Big and chewy."
"a good paring for this chilly ""summer"" day in Calgary, a solid beer and would do quite well in a cellar but I only have one bottle and I need to thank MasterSki for sending it my way"
"Pours a luscious black on the side of the glass, not much carbonation, kind of a thick pour. Does lace slightly so you know your in for much more then a hamms light. This is one stout that I truly love due to its dark chocolate tones infused with a ever so slight alcohol vapor that can be felt on the way down. Not much of a hoppy brew which is a bonus. Brewed with a bit of thickness so that the flavors linger towards the back of the mouth. Overall, this is an excellent stout and will continue to buy it when available."
"I've drank several of these just trying to develop an honest feel for this beer. It's a beautiful black color with an exceptional deep tan head, and thats where it ends for me. I don't get the chocolates and the coffee flavors others have written of, what i get is molasses and smoke and the smoke doesn't do it for me. Its not that the beer is bad, its just not me."
"One of the best RIS I've everhad next to a 2008 darklord. I enjoyed this beer I'm my delirium sniffter. Pours out dark and has an awsome smell. Dark tan head and left a little lacing. Has a nice mouth feel and let's u know their is a 10.5 abv. Then chocalte,coffee, and tasty malts cover your pallet along with a creamy head (if swurled before consumed) I love that is availible in a 6pack so I can enjoy almost one a day!"
"This beer couldn't have alcohol in it...I can't taste it what so ever. I could sip on this all day and night. Wonderful stuff!"
"Bottled dated 10-2009. Pours out jet black like used motor oil. Sweet roasty and malty aroma with a presence of alcohol. Good tan head and carbonation. Very heavy mouthfeel. Quite roasty, almost smoky. The sweetness overpowers this one for me though, perhaps the alcohol too. This seems like a well made brew, but sadly, I found myself unable to finish it. Imperials are just not my thing-that I am sure of. -But I am up for trying anything, once. My thanks to awesome trader Birchstick for giving me the opportunity to try this highly rated stout."
"I have had the cask conditioned version too, and that was one of the best beer experiences I have had. Noticeably better on cask. Still, the drinkability is alright. However, this beer seems very rough which affects the score."
"I've drank a few of these before, and about 2.5 is the safe limit, for me. You will never need to drink that many, the beer satisfies in it's own short time."
"D- It's quite cold today so I decided itm was going to be a stout and barleywine day. So far this is keeping me quite warm. Come winter i could see this being a staple. The alcohol is mute in taste, and the complexity is wonderful definitely would have a hard time stopping at one or two (unless I can't make it to the fridge anymore)"
"D: Goes down great, especially for such a strongly alcoholic and strongly flavored beer. Well-done!"
"Full bodied, on the sweet side which works well with the strong malt and coffee flavors. Reminiscent of a mocha dessert drink."
"I have tried this beer three times. The second time was in a stout tasting and this was pick #1 out of 13 different stout."
"Overall, I found this an enjoyable brew but could do with a little less pronounced alcohol flavor."
"The beer pours absolute black, with a two finger dark coffee head. It quickly dissipates halfway and just sits at a finger in height for a long time. A little bit more lacing would have garnered Expedition Stout a five. The smell is of dark chocolate (good) and some black licorice (not as much). As long as the flavor pulls more from the former than the latter I think I'll still dig it. Well, I got my wish, but this beer is *very* rough around the edges. The dark chocolate overpowers the licorice, after an opening dollop of caramel, but there's a harsh graininess and a bitterness that I want to say comes from hops, but there's no accompanying hop flavor. I was ready to score the flavor lower, but it did smooth out some as the beer hit room temperatureIt's a shame too, because the mouthfeel on this beer is great, a chewy and luxurious body and carbonation that's just a tiny bit too high for my taste. The poor taste really hurts drinkability, but the beer gets some credit for effectively masking any alcohol. I'd never had Bell's beer that was less than top notch until Expedition Stout, but I'm glad I got to try and I'd like to try this beer with a few years on it to see if it smooths out."
"Notes: One of the most complex behemoths out there. Sweet and rich but bitter and with a drying finish. Love every thing about it!"
"Cheers!"
"D 3.5"
"Drinks: below the radar. If Expedition Stout was a limited release, I can almost guarantee it would be a far more popular beer. As it is, it's one of the better RISes out there, and easily accessible -- an dangerous combination."
"They combine the pinpoint execution of Deschutes Obsidian with the big complexity of Victory Storm King and fine tune the concept to where I can't find any flaws."
"D - Very solid drinkability, I could see sipping on one or two of these throughout the night. The initial overwhelming sweetness evens out nicely as the beer warms up, making this much more enjoyable then I would have initially thought. Great beer from one of my favorite brewers!"
"As a side, try this on cask if you see it, it's unreal."
"Bottle thanks to TheJester. Beautiful black body with lasting mocha head. Aroma is standard IS; coffee and chocolate truffle. Flavor is more interesting. So rich. Heavy chocolate brownies with some grapes and almonds. Wow, this is intense. Somewhat boozy though. Creamy and syrupy palate. Its heavyness makes it less enjoyable. I prefer american stouts that are more balanced such as Yeti and Speedway. Still, one of the best intense and over-the-top IS."
"D- Great beer but it will get you into trouble pretty fast"
"Overall- with about 1.5 years of age this has mellowed out nicely, cant wait to try my last bottle of this batch around x-mas."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but burns a bit."
"D: Would love to drink this in the summer. Maybe 3 or 4 at a time."
"Pours a blackish body with a solid one-finger head that stuck around forever. A thick, hearty malt aroma of chocolate and roasted malts along with a touch of breadiness; hops are minimal but give off dark fruit like black cherry. A sweet stickiness greets my tongue and then I pick up chocolate and hints of toffee but there's a greater bready, biscuity, almost coffee-like roasted sensation that gives this thick beer a hearty finish. Plum and tasty with minimal hop bitterness and fruit flavorings make for a great sipper that goes down smooth and the ABV is complementary on the backbite but does not bleed into the beer."
"D: Goes down rather easily for a 10% with no age on it, nice representation of style, yet another solid brew from Bell's."
"Decent beer. Definitely a sipper. Worth a try, but barely."
"Overall, I really enjoy expedition stout. It's one of the best RIS' that is widely available, but my only gripe is the price."
"Batch 9512. Bottled Dec 18 2009. Thanks to Bells batch Finder! This poured like a dark motor oil. Thick tan head with nice lacing which stayed on the sides of the glass. Taste of espresso, some hop bitterness, chocolate and roasty malt. The alcohol becomes more evident as it warms. Would love to taste this after a few years of cellaring if only I could keep my hands from prying off the cap!"
"Solid imperial stout."
"Drinkability is slow; sip, rest, sip, rest. And, at 10.5% ABV, you'll need to put this one down easy. After one, you'll be full, but also looking forward to the next time you have one."
"d - A pretty nice RIS. Lots of roasted malts in the smell and taste. Have it many times and will have it again. Would recommend."
"This is a pretty complex imperial stout and its hotness implies that it could benefit from some age to let some of those flavore meld and the heat mellow. Still something I would seek out again."
"D: the dominating taste of molasses and the high ABV make a quick return trip not likely"
"D_This could substitute a full meal."
"DB- Good price for a big RIS. The roast malt and dark fruit work well for an up front big stout flavor. Becomes a bit syrupy as the temperature rises."
"Another nice find at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis, MN, which I was glad to have had prior to dipping into the even more prized ""Black Note"" version - this black beauty shows an opaque brown/black with a good head of brown foam and decent lacing. The nose picks up seaweed malt and decidedly herbal hops. Very nice and not over the top at all. The flavor jumps out a surprising licorice which now makes a lot of sense from the aroma but I missed it I guess. But this is a licorice malt flavor fest, intense yet mellow enough to neutralize the 10.5 ABV just enough for some drinkabiity. No session beer, but it's hard to slow down too much once you grab a hold of this taste wallop. There is that herbal hop idea that adds a real nice highlight to this full bodied, viscous feeling stout. Wow. I do enjoy this. Very little carbonation as you might expect from a cask but this holds together very well. I start to pick up some berry notes and definitely some coffee and marshmallow sweetness as my palate adjusts to the dominant licorice malt theme. Intense but not a ""choker"". Highly recommended for the curious and fun loving BA, but not your mother's stout."
"D- Drinkability is hindered by the high alcohol content, and further inhibited by the over-the-top roasty and hop flavors. One 12oz. bottle is enough for me in one sitting..."
"** more notes - 1/5/14** - Great beer to revisit. Opened a bottle I bought in Philly or NY a while back, the batch # is 10105, I believe this to be from 2010 sometime. Huge+robust but smoothed out with maybe some slight oxidation. Roasty dark chocolate licorice all the way. Less alcohol than I remember. Definitely a nice winter sippin' beer, I will definitely get more of this when in their distribution range again."
"Very tasty, but noticeably boozy. 1 satisfies just fine."
"I dig this. Not as complex as some other stouts but thick and kickass like a stout should be."
"Impression: One of a crop of truly exceptional American RIS that I hope to try again."
"The alcohol has faded. I get some dark chocolate on the nose and in taste. I get some almost anise taste. Very thick and tons of flavor. Not sure if I like the flavor now."
"Aroma is very dark hint of chocolate type. The taste is very malting and rich. This was a pleasant tasting stout. And will drink it again."
"I would drink this beer again in a heartbeat ( and only one for an evening )."
"D- I like a big boozy stout upon occasion but just that, this is not an every day brew."
"On the aroma I get a ton of roasted malts along with dark fruits and molasses. Some alcohol present as well. On the palate I get a ton of chocolate - something I didn't get from the aroma. Up front some of the dark fruits are present before the chocolate takes over leaving a lingering somewhat sweet finish"
"Poured from a 1+ year old cellar temperature bottle into a Delerium Tremens snifter. It is an opaque, dark brown liquid with a small head of tan foam and bubbles. I can see bubbles popping on top of the foam. There is no light penetration. Swirling the beer produces a bit of a film and a very good foam coating. The head has now settles to just a skim of foam. It's a pretty beer, but I've seen better looking RISes. I can smell roasted malts, alcohol, caramel and some chocolate. Even with all of these candy scents, it doesn't smell overly sweet. This is a tasty stout. Creamy milk chocolate and a few dark roasted malts greet my tongue as soon as I sip. Some bitterness moves in aa I swallow. It's akin to dark chocolate, but not quite the same. Prehaps the year of aging has made the bitterness harder to identify? Also present in the finish and moreso in the aftertaste is a bit of alcohol burn. It is hot, but not exclusively in an alcoholic sense; it's also ever so slightly peppery. The alcohol flavors aren't too strong, but are certainly present. I imagine that the year of age has mellowed this flavor out as well. After swallowing, I can run my tongue over my mouth and pick up more chocolate and alcohol flavors. The Expedition leaves behind a persistent coat. It has lower levels of carbonation and is full-bodied. For a 10%+ ABV stout, this beer is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't have more than one bottle of this, but each swallow goes down very well. If you can get your hands on some of this, I would highly recommend putting a few bottles in your cellar for a year or more."
"O - Nice one from Bell's. In my search for the perfect morning beer, this might not quite fit the bill, but it definitely makes an impression. I'd like to have this available to me regularly."
"Pours Very thick black with a thick, frothy, espresso colored head that hangs around for a bit. I got about 2 inches of head pouring this thing aggressively. Very nice! The smell is very interesting. I'm getting a lot of chocolate and coffee...but the smell that stand out the most is BREAD. I'm getting a nose full of fresh baked bread when I smell this thing. More than any other bread-smelling beer I've tasted. The taste just blows me away. I don't get any bread in the taste. I get immediate bitterness, followed my such sweet chocolate it's insane. A lot of espresso/coffee in the aftertaste. This beer reminds me a lot of a cafe mocha. No matter how good this beer tastes, I still can't get over how much this smelled like fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is wonderful. Very thick and full-bodies. Ohhhh...just burped and there's that bread taste. Very interesting. This beer is for sure a sipper. Wouldn't recommend having too much of this in one sitting. This beer sure is Amazing though!"
"Pours like engine oil -- very deliciously dark appearance. Aroma is of alcohol and black licorice with a hint of soy. Very thick palate. Flavor is initially of smooth black licorice and sweet malt, then transforms into bitter hops and roasted molasses -- though not burnt. Some notes of earthy coffee and chocolate coruscate through to a dry, dark finish. Very thick, very viscous, very creamy, and very complex. A balanced taste between bitter hops and dark characters delivers a spectacular brew with a phenomenal finish. Spectacular! Think Dark City epiphany and dénouement. If ""the limits of my language are the limits of my world", this must be near the limits of my beer."
"D: I have always loved Expo, but have never tried it at this age. I must say that I am amazed by how much chocolate character comes through now. Delicious."
"Apparently I did have one of these guys hangin' around in my fridge after all. Go figure. Let's review it, shall we? It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a short finger of tan foam that fades fairly quickly. The nose comprises plenty o' roasted malts, dark wheat, chocolate syrup, nutmeg, and a surprising dose of rye bread. A general sweetness pervades. The taste darkens the proceedings, roasting some of the sweet notes and replacing the rye bread with a leather-like character. Some light prune notes gurgle up from th bottom, but don't pool all that much. Something's missing here, but I can't quite put my finger on it. The body is fairly hefty, with a heavy light carbonation and a borderline chewy feel. Overall, a solid RIS, but I've had better, even among regularly available offerings. Something's just off a little, you know what I mean?"
"Very full bodied stout, finishes brighter than it starts. Pretty roasty, kind of bourbony in the mouthfeel and forward flavors. Its a big big beer. I didn't realize the ABV on this until I started writing this review foolishly. I will pay for my ignorance for sure. Its pretty drinkable especially if I'm grading on a curve. I had the 2005 recently, also a gift from Huhzubendah and it had began to turn. Strong plum flavors and other characteristic oxidized notes in the palate. A good beer but i think the shelf life is around 3 - 4 years max. I enjoyed it."
"I have yet to find another RIS with the molasses cookie taste that Expedition Stout has. It always reminds me of home..."
"Drinkability: This one is definitely a sipper. It's nice and rich and tasty, but there's no way you could - or should - put down more than 1 or 2 12oz bottles of this baby. That said, I think it is nice and balanced and I'd be willing to drink it again. I'd like to see what it tastes like aged, or on tap."
"Age has really mellowed this brew in a very good way, but it is still strong and packs a punch of flavor and alcohol...definitely easier and more enjoyable to drink now than it was/is fresh..."
"Dark black colour swirls into my snifter and leaves little, if any room for light. A dark-khaki head appears and leaves some, but not a whole lot of lacing. Smells strongly of coffee, with chocolate also there in the mix. Taste is much like the smell, but I am slightly put off by the intenseness of the alcohol. The high abv is nice sometimes, but it seems to interfere with my enjoyment of the beer. Coffee taste is nice, but it's a bit off here, less of a good coffee, and more of an old stale coffee taste, with a bit of chocolate background. It's very chewy, and most certainly a sipper. I'm glad I purchased this, but it's certainly not something i'll be purchasing agian"
"(D)- Truthfully, I am not a big fan of this fresh, but with about a year and a half on this, it is quite tasty. Buy a case of this and drink over the next 4-5 years. A great RIS when aged properly. Even after having this numerous times now, I am convinced this is perhaps the most rewarding stout to age."
"D: Great beer that is wonderful to sip on for any occasion; however, the strength of the roasted malts and the alcohol presence makes this a tad bit difficult to handle for too long. Great beer--just approach slowly and with caution"
"D: The alcohol wears a bit as time goes on; I can only imagine myself drinking one."
"because it is so rich and sweet, don't know if I would order a whole pint again... but couldn't think of a better after dinner drink to finish off a great evening!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark as night...I've wanted to use that line before, but it fits here, with a medium sized head that starts dark atop the beer and fades to caramel the closer it gets to the rim. The mouth feel is slick, smooth and oh so full. Malt dominates the aroma: roasted malt, dark chocolate, raisin, vanilla and sweet alcohol are all present. There are enough hops in the taste to balance, but they aren't a true player in the beer beyond grounding its more eccentric tendencies. Candied plum, chocolate, vanilla, bitter toast and a bit of rum round out the flavor notes for me. This is Bell's best beer for my money and a contender for any consideration given to Imperial Stouts."
"Creamy in the mouth and full bodied. Warm. This is truly a sipper and a dessert beer."
"Good beer with some age on it, probably really good fresh too."
"Bottle pours a dark black with a little bit of foam in the glass. Tastes of roasted dark chocolate and coffee with some dark fruits lingering in the background. For this being 10.5%, it goes down very damn smooth. This didn't blow me away, but it was pretty solid overall. I'm aging two more bottles until next winter. So i'm curious to how that tastes."
"Pours a deep, dark foreboding black color, impenetrable to the light, with an inch or so of dark brown foam on top. Tons of floaties in this one, quickly settle into a layer of sediment on the bottom. Aromas of rum soaked fruitcake, fig, prunes, plums and dark chocolate. Silky smooth on the palate, with more dark fruit, bitter coffee and cocoa powder. Some alcohol late."
"D- Very full! Can't have more than one with the acohol taste too... I can revisit it in another sitting though so it's got a decent drinkability"
"D: I've had this before and don't remember it being this good. Well done Bell's! I will have to get some more and age at least one to see if it could possibly get better than it already is. Magnifico!!!"
"D - Not the best to drink on a hot summer day like today, but that was my choice. Alcohol not very well hidden and the astringency of the roasted malt is sort of bothering me more and more."
"D - i like the beer alot, but don't see myself having more than one. for the 10.5 ABV, they did a great job on smoothness, but it is a very rich beer."
"This thing is uber dark brown with a dark tan head. There is absolutely no light getting through this one. Just pouring this gives a sense of its thickness. Alcohol is immediately apparent in the nose. It's also got some fig, prune, dates, and cherry rounding things out with vanilla and coffee. Dark fruits at first, which I really like. The finish is strong with espresso and leaves a taste somewhat akin to burnt toast. I also get bitter chocolate in the taste that was missing in the smell. Sure, the alcohol is present, but not as noticeable as in the scent. I love the rich, silky smooth feel. The level of carbonation matches up quite well."
"D - A very nice RIS. Somewhat hot, but otherwise near perfect for a RIS. I am very interested to see how the other 5 of these age..."
"Overall, a very good example of the style and better than some much more highly hyped versions. Worth trying when you see it."
"Awsome brew to have on cask."
"pretty drinkable for being so strong and rich, but i doubt anyone could have more than 2 of these in a sitting. not my favorite ris, but it fits the style and i would certainly buy it again."
"I also had a 2008 vintage. I'd give that a 4.5 / 4.5 / 5.0 / 4.5 / 4.5 (overall 4.7 / A+). I definitely prefer this with some age."
"O- This beer after a few sips started to let me down. The complexity falls way short with just roasted barley taste and a touch of dark chocolate. Its decent for an RIS."
"Beer poured black as night with a nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is mocha, roasted malts, floral hops. Taste is a wonderful combination of roasted malts, mocha, chocolate, and bittering hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, perfectly smooth, creamy with good viscosity. Drinkability is amazingly great, even at a young age. The abv is very well hidden. I think I will save the other bottle for awhile to see how well it ages! Awesome beer, glad to see Bell's in Arizona!"
"D- for the ABV it is way too easy to drink, the alcohol presence never really makes itself know, still a big beer that takes a while to drink but it sure is enjoyable for the entire time you are drinking it"
"The drink ability is way to good for a beer with this High of an ABV. Perhaps I need to have more Russian Imperial Stouts."
"I have no intention of having another anytime soon, but I look forward to reviewing the rest of the six-pack over an incremental period of time."
"OVERALL: Not sure what to think about this one. The appearance and nose were average for the style, but the addition of some kind of smoked salami was odd yet enticing at the same time. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I enjoyed it enough that I'd buy it again if I came across it again. Definitely not a standard Imperial Stout offering."
"Extremely drinkable for a brew over 10% abv. Goes down nice and easy, with a flavor that just begs for more. Like a delicious chocolate desert, you know you probably shouldn't...but what the hell..."
"The flavor is big. Bitter chocolate with roasted bread. The backend of the flavor is heavy with herbal hop bitterness and the aforementioned char. Heavy viscous mouth feel. Good but actually kind of messy to me, and sitting on one of these would most likely make this better. A sipper for sure."
"D: WOW, this is a great dessert beer. Just the right amount of alcohol heat combined with a nicely balanced sweet/bitter. Makes me think of a great chocolate cheesecake dusted with cocoa powder. I could drink a 6 pack of these if it was not for the alcohol. Highly recommended."
"Overall the first time I did not like this beer, and I have no idea why.  Great full body, very creamy."
"All in all, this is a decent brew to try at least once if you likes stouts and IPA's."
"Overall I loved this beer. I especially liked the rich, bold taste and creamy mouthfeel. This was my first Expedition ever and I can definitely see how aging this one would be a smart move since this would most likely tone down the bitterness a bit. I definitely plan on buying a second or third six pack just for aging past 2yrs. If you like stouts, you must try this beer."
"Taste is a bit harsh but mellowing as it warms. Burnt coffee dominates and leaves a bit of an unplesant aftertaste is slightly bitter and harsh."
"Overall a fine RIS. Easily drinkable. Nothing really seperates it from the pack but still enjoyable."
"Now this is a proper drinking imperial stout. Big and bold, in your face attitude with a graceful refinement. I could easily kill half a sixer of these, but that would be some bad juju. This is so much better than many of the other in the style, I think this is my new favorite imperial (non-adjust/barrel aged) stout, right up there with Nogne O and Old Rasputin."
"This beer brought a big smile to my face as I poured it, watching its thick viscous blackness, and seeing the last bits of it drizzling like a syrup over the thin head that slowly developed. Its flavors are complex but not overwhelmingly so. I think it's taken me over an hour to drink but I've enjoyed every sip."
"This is a winner RIS in my opinion and is up there with Old Rasputin for sure!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. It is sweet, syrupy and completely coats the mouth. Even though this beer tastes and smells a bit boozey, I love the punchy, unapologetic bourbon-iness of it and I find it completely appropriate for a russian imperial stout."
"D: definitely a sipper and might improve with some cellaring time."
"Second Bell's I have tried. 12 oz. pour from bottle. Black, deep rich black. Thick dark brown foamy head that lingers for a short time before ending up in a thin skin of bubbles. Nice chocolate with roasted coffee notes. Slightly sweet, with a lingering taste without over powering me. Fairly high abv but really doesn't taste it. Like it but can rarely find it in Dallas."
"Prickly in the mouth and covers it initially but doesn't feel like its there after save the bitterness stuck on your tongue."
"Overall Impression: This beer is all over the place: Great look, funky lackluster smell, complex & powerful flavor, with a sweet sticky feel. Somehow it managed to come out as ""good", but just barely"
"Taste was like the smell. I was putt off by how sweet it was. Mouthfeel was waxy and thick. I just didn't think it was a very good beer."
"Cheers!"
"Follow up note: I wrote notes on this beer while consuming it. Unfortunately, the beer got a little tiring to drink as I finished the bottle and I knocked its score down appropriately."
"D- One is enough for even the fiercest of warriors after the most viscous of battles. Undoubtedly drank by Cimmerians during the spring raids into Pictland and Vaneheim."
"Worth a try if you can get some and you like malt bombs."
"Overall, Expedition Stout is just yet another example of why Bell's Brewery is a fantastic producer of beer. It's a rough example of an imperial stout and I'm a big fan of it's raw display of flavors. I only bought this one but I plan on buying a six pack as soon as is convenient to stick a couple in the cellar. There's a thunderstorm happening outside right now, and I couldn't imagine a better scenario for opening up an Expedition Stout. Do yourself a favor and buy a couple of these, stash them away and open them up when the weather turns sour - Expedition Stout won't disappoint."
"man oh man, bells has some good stuff, i really love two hearted and hopslam and this one has really opened my heart to them. cheers!"
"Pours thick and dark. Small tan head that falls pretty quickly. Nose is full of roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit, and a little coffee. Taste follows suit. Roasty and delicious. Finishes with a slight bitterness, similar to a really dark chocolate. Very good. Little to no alcohol noticeable. I love Expedition with over a year on it. Fresh is good, but a little too hot. Buy some, and put it down for a year and it will hold up against some of the more highly regarded big boy stouts."
"Could benefit with 6-12 months in the cellar. Quite a drinkable stout though. Nice."
"D. This a a big beer. Its a sipper for me. Not the very best Imperial Stout I have had, but very good. Well crafted and delicous."
"I think this is definitely a beer that could improve with some age on it and I will probably update my review when I've had a bottle with a year or more in the cellar."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is impressively big. It's thick and full on the palate with substantial weight. Carbonation is low, and towards the end of the glass, it was low enough to change the texture to a syrupy consistency. Expedition is a little hot for my tastes, but it had some good things going on that make me want to try this after its aged a bit more."
"Bell's Expedition Stout is a world-class beer that unfortunately does not garner the attention on BA that it deserves. If you have not yet had the opportunity to try this, definitely seek it out."
"overall, a really finely crafted imperial stout. glad i scooped up a decent amount of these, as i think they'll age well."
"Overall: Extremely enjoyable imperial stout from Bell's with great malt complexity with strong roasted notes. The hop aroma and bitterness is nice. Alcohol is present, but should mellow with age."
"D - This is delicious and a great brew from one of my favorite breweries. I am definitely going to buy this again."
"D: I think this is a great beer, fresh and aged. A perfect night cap Plus, given the price of most big stouts, this is a deal IMO."
"D: A great RIS and a fine introduction to Bell's. Why can't they distribute in New York? Time to get some Hopslam up in this bitch!"
"Drinkability - I was suprised by this one. Wasn't expecting an exceptional stout but this is very, very close one of the best in class."
"A good beer, would be excellent on a cold day"
"Drinkability here is hindered for some obvious reasons, mainly the powerful flavors and the high dosage of alcohol. This makes one heck of a warmer, though, and would make a perfect companion on a cold winter's expedition through the mountains or down the street to the nearest pub."
"Pours either a really dark brown or just plain black with a brown head that dissolves rather quickly. Aroma has scents of roasted nuts, sweet malts, and some cocoa. Taste follows the aroma, only the 10.5% really kicks in, maybe to the extent of overpowering everything else. It was really thick and lowly carbonated, almost drinking like a thin syrup. Because of the relative strength and thickness, I could probably only have one of these at a time, but a good strong beer overall."
"D - this was one of the first ""big"" RIS i can remember having, and loving it at the time. still holds its own against all the special one-off bourbon barreled whatevers. a damn fine RIS, easily attainable, and good for the price point. definitely need to stock up on these and see how it ages. Bell's impresses yet again."
"D: I could sit and sip this all day. It's such a smooth, creamy, complex ale, truly exceptional. The booziness and ABV might get to you after a bit, but it's not meant to be a session beer."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Just enough carbonation to smooth out the heavy oily texture of this masterpiece. Great stout. Its presence really stays with you and gives you a warm feeling."
"Heaven in a bottle, the complexity defies description. Very close to a perfect beer."
"I enjoy most beers, present one included, I am happy with the purchase, I just wish they would have focused more on developing the aromatics than the alcohol content."
"Pours a near black color with a modest, very dark tan head that dissipates fairly quickly but maintains a small ring and leaves some decent lacing. Smells and tastes of coffee, toffee, and caramel. nice creamy mouthfeel and a very smooth beer. Alcohol is slightly noticeable but is not overdone at all."
"F: Finishes pretty dry and super bitter still. Lots of earthy dark stout like char and scorched malts. The dark flavors just feel like they are pulling the water and nutrients out of my mouth. The thick syrupy barely liquid seems to stick to everything as well and coats the mouth, leaving the flavors for a while. More chocolate, roast, coffee, bitter earthy stout, and the lingering boozy flavors just go for a while. Considering how thick it is, with the boozy quality, and so bitter and dry its difficult to drink. Glad it isn't a bomber! Still a great beer though."
"The guy who sent it to me says he thinks its an 06 but there is no batch #. Either way this was phenomenal. It ages very very well. Thanks Marc!"
"D: This brew wasn't bad, but it didn't really work for me and was well below expectations. Expedition Stout seemed to suffer from the curse of too much, where all the flavors where just way over the top and resulted in an overwhelming brew. A decent sipping brew but I've had a lot better RIS's and this is not one I'll be looking for again. Not recommended."
"this was the last beer during one of our epic stout tastings. after all the 10%+, my beer notes aren't as detailed and start to become hard to read/understand. this beer had been cellar aged for one year. enjoy. pours beautiful, with a gorgeous one finger brown sugar head. smells strong a potent. clean as cream. tastes like angels tears. the 10.5% is apparent but i don't care at this point. low carbonation. roast malts. time to take a nap."
"D: Booze is only faintly detected and this beer goes down pretty darn smooth for the high abv. Very nice overall and would love to get my hands on more of these!"
"D - Great flavor in this beer. I think its the appearance and mouthfeel that really make this beer stand out from the rest. Good thick taste just like an RIS should be along with the heavy body. Thick rings of lace cling to the glass the entire time. Overall just a great looking and tasting RIS!!"
"D- This is a good drinkable stout. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 was because I could not drink a sixer of this even if I tried. It was a very filling beer for me and after a couple I would need to switch to something lighter in feel."
"Dark black color with which lets no light pass through. Has a large brown head with good retention. Smells of chocolate, molasses, raisins, and coffee. The taste mirrors the aroma nicely. Has a nice mixture of sweetness and coffee bitterness. Full bodied, creamy, and properly carbonated. Bell's does a nice job of disguising the 10.5% abv. Highly recommended."
"D: A very good, quite complex beer. Excellent sipper and another very good beer from Bell's."
"I do love me a Bell's Stout...I've cellared three of these for sampling in the future."
"D: I wouldn't drink many of these in a sitting but definitely a good sipping beer."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, well made and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a more intense smell away from being a great beer however as it is it's still knocking on the door. Well worth a shot."
"No gimmicks to this beer, just a serious imperial stout."
"Notes: Hmmm, it does not stand up to its draft form.... At least not the one I had recently that made me revisit the bottle. In fact I had a couple of ounces a few days ago from a cask version and this sits nowhere near it. The brew remains reliable and quite tasty but does not feel extraordinary. The draft was much more memorable and had a range of subtleties that were missing from the bottle. In fact, it is close to boredom at times."
"Pours super dark black. Completely opaque. Probably the darkest beer I have ever seen with a very dark tan head. Nice fluffy head with good retention. Aroma is roasty and rich with coffee, bitter chocolate, some raisin, toffee sweetness and a bit of alcohol. Taste is much sweeter than expected. This beer has a lot going on. While the coffee and roasted malt taste is there, they are not as prevalent as in the aroma. I would say the main flavors are bitter chocolate, malt sweetness and a smokiness that reminds me of burnt marshmallows. I also detect a sort of herbal and fruity taste. Quite alcoholic, I can taste it and feel the warmth. A full bodied beer that is silky smooth and chewy. Definitely one to savor."
"Pours thick and dark brown with a light lacy brown head. Vinous malty aromas flow from the glass foreshadowing the brews strength and flavor which is also vinous and has a fig ester flavor. The body is big and heavy with very low carbonation levels making it flow very slow. Likewise, the finish is slow and warms with a vinous end."
"Can't wait to see how this bad boy ages!"
"Drinkablility is decent, maybe this beers weakest aspect. Still not bad though."
"Pours midnight dark black. No visibility is seen through the liquid with even the slowest of pours. After an aggressive pour, there is a very faint tan head that quickly fades away. The nose is quite strong with some sweet raisins, chocolate and malts. Also some hints of vanilla beans and molasses. After enjoying the smell and letting this warm up to room temperature, I finally took my first sip. The taste is hoppy, malty, sweet, all the above. Sweetness is coming through as raisins and caramel while there is the hoppy bitterness as well as a roasted toasted malty finish. I really enjoy the taste of the Expedition. Mouthfeel is quite thick and syrupy. Drinkability is moderate with this being a run of the mill Imperial Stout"
"D: Does go down rather smooth and creamy with little heat for the ABV, but the mouthfeel is pretty frustrating until it warms significantly and the carbonation nearly dies down completely. A great beer overall, but drinkable? One to let warm and sip."
"Mouthfeel is full, but on the lighter side of full. The carbonation is appropriate, but could be a bit creamier."
"Drinkability: While I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, the high alcohol brings down the drinkability. Could have one or two from time to time, but not a steady stream."
"Very drinkable considering the strength. Beautiful beer."
"Very surprised to see so many top reviewers rank this beer a 4.6 and above. Unlike others I got a nice towering dark brown head, minimal lace and aroma is burnt chocolate, roasted grains and bitter coffee. Like others I found a slight fruitiness in the taste which added a very mild tartness to the middle. Nothing special in any category, more dark chocolate flavors and roasted barley notes in the taste, mild graham cracker crust and the head did have some gold dust particles that sparkled like glitter when held to the light. Good beer but much better RIS's more readily available."
"Pours thick like an oil slick with a small amount of head that took a bit to appear. Clear film of lacing sticks to the glass for just a moment while you drink. Smells of earthy fruit and dirt. Also some badly burned meat. Uh oh at this point I know I am in trouble. The taste also does nothing for me. Like drinking oven cleaner. I can respect that it is very rich and flavorful but can't finish this beast. Drinkability is poor due the taste and extreme alcohol content."
"I think it is a little to carbonated for me. I prefer my bigger stouts that have a lot of sweetness to be on the low side of carbonation. Drinkability is above average for the style for me. I'm not sipping this as i normally do with big stouts but drinking it rather quickly."
"D: I really enjoy this beer a lot, but it is thick and has a high ABV. This is definitely a sipping dessert beer IMO."
"D: This is an outstanding stout. Rich and bold, yet highly drinkable. Very well crafted."
"Consumed - 1/17/2009"
"Drinkability: A wonderful full bodied beer for cold days, I would love to kick a few back regularly."
"Thank you once again to beerisheaven for this one. The appearance is nice inky with a nice sark tan head. Smells like a traditional RIS to me, chocolate, coffee, and malt. Nothing different there. The taste is unlike any RIS I have ever had. Molasses, malts and a bit of chocolate make up the initial taste. Then Bitter hits my tongue and takes over. All I can taste now is the bitter from some unknown source. I think a little age would do wonders for this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, velvety and a bit creamy. I could not drink another of these right now. It just is way to bitter for me. I would love to try an aged and brand new one side by side, but for now ugh."
"This beer is very drinkable despite the high alcohol and intensity of the dark flavors. A definite winner on a cold winter night, especially on tap."
"D-amazing! so creamy, so chocolate, and huge flavors!"
"D: Delicious, but definitely not a beer that I could drink more than one of in one sitting."
"D: Only one. I could not have had another, Too much to handle, but what an experience!"
"All-in-all, a well-crafted and delicious brew that can be drunk now or aged for years."
"Poured into a pint glass stout black (is stout black not a color? it is now) with a 1/2 finger head that left very little lacing. Smells of... hops? Maybe my nose is off, but I smell a bit of citrus, not something I'm used to from a stout. Some roasted barley, too. Carbonation is there, but it's weak. Cream and alcohol are predominant, smoked barley and hints of mocha and caramel too. Definite hop presence, especially in the aftertaste, which I don't mind. This beer has a kick, as I would expect from an imperial stout, but it isn't that balanced. I don't see myself kicking back and enjoying a couple of these. Still a perfectly enjoyable stout."
"As stated before, this beer is very thick. The carbonation has a hard time poking through. Drinkability is high considering the ABV"
"Well, that not so huge body allows the drinkability to run very high. Great all around RIS. Bell's has to be one of my favorite breweries. Looking forward to aging a few of these to see how it develops."
"D - Would not seek this one out again over many, many others I have readily available."
"This is a big and bold Russian imperial stout, but for a true Michigan jewel I recommend the Dark Horse Plead the 5th."
"The 10.5% ABV is making my mouth very dry and I don't think I could drink another. One is enough. Overall, the beer was good, as I would not turn this one down if offered, but I've had better stouts."
"At 10.5%, the beer is one of the stronger ones. However, it keeps itself within reason. A definite treat for a winter night. This is one of Bell's best brews hands down. Try it sometime!"
"Very thick creamy taste. Pleasant flavor...bitter-sweet chocolates, dark roasted coffee. Great warming sensation down the throat. Wow, after smelling this beer, I espected a bad stout. Flavor is actually very good! Full body. Drinkability down due to thickness...but a must try!"
"Make no mistake, this is a huge RIS and very strong and assertive. Black licorice dominates, charcoal, flashes of sour that initially made me pucker - must be the hop presence. Overpoweringly rich, boozy, like a high ABV barley wine made with anise. Very creamy in the mouth, dense, heavy with hops, dark toasted malt, burnt and smokey. This beer literally blew me away, savoured and sipped, it took on subtler aspects with air and warming but demanded respect. It took me a long time to finish it. Next time I find a bottle of this, it will stay considerably longer in my cellar."
"Mouthfeel was thick rich and creamy . Warm buttery texture also a bit syrupy. A heavy beer but good, a nice beer for winter."
"Overall this was a truly a wonderful Imperial Stout that certainly lives up to the hype. Another quality product from Bell's and certainly one that has to tried by all Imperial Stout fans. Highly Recommended."
"Pours an opaque very dark brown with thin light brown head, fast fading, no lacing. Smell: roasty, dark brown sugar, a little wood smoke, dark fruit, touch of soy sauce. Taste: molasses, not quite burnt, dates, milk chocolate aftertaste, rich roasty coffee, leafy and spicy hop in the background, quite sweet. Mouthfeel: syrupy but low on carbonation. Expedition was enjoyable but not elite. The alcohol was well hidden, though this one had almost a year on it, bottled on Jan 28, 2009 (Bell's batch finder is awesome)."
"2007 vintage. Pours pitch black with basically no head. What little head is present is is a brown color. Aroma is strong coffee with some roasted malt and dark fruit. the flavor is heavy on the roasted malt with some smokiness. Some dark fruit and bitter chocolate as well. There is also a slight soy sauce character to the beer. The alcohol has a nice alcohol warming affect. Very thick body and low carbonation. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. This one might have improved with more carbonation."
"Overall impression: Better around 55-60F than right out of the fridge. Slight alcohol warmth. Definitely a sipper."
"D – Not so much. It took a 50 degree-weather day in Florida to get me crackn this one, aka once in a blue moon."
"Bro's, you guys got a bad one. Give it another try, you'll love it!"
"Ok. I prefer a little more carbonation and more roastiness. This stout was very sweet... maybe a bit too sweet for me. I prefer a bit more hop bitterness in RIS's."
"This is a good RIS. One of the thickest I can remember trying. Something I would recommend for the stout lover."
"Pours a nice molten black with a minimal amount of tan head. Very little lacing as a result. Great aroma with great roasted and smokey tones. Incredibly smooth on the palate. Complex character that has hints of chocolate, very little bitterness, and doesn't leave your mouth feeling dry as saw dust like a lot of other heavy, imperial stouts. Definitely a beer to sit back and savor."
"Man, I had forgot how hoppy this is fresh and it's no wonder that this is a great candidate for aging. The flavors are just so robust on this and the feel is one of my favorites on a Stout. Probably my favorite go-to Imperial Stout, this always puts a smile on my face."
"Overall: a superlative brew. A phenom. Wicked. Words don't do it justice. And I'm not even that ""in"" to Russian Imperials."
"in the constant michigan battle of bells vs. founders in the category of imperial stouts, i must give it to founders."
"Fantastic."
"Drinkability is good for a RIS, I really enjoyed these and will be buying them every winter for sure."
"D - Given the sharp bitterness, this one is not real pleasant to drink. Certainly not meant to be a sessionable beer, but the sharp bitter flavor really takes away from the overall experience and is hard for the beer to show any complexity with such a dominating force to compete with."
"Overall, I think I would have liked this beer more if it didn't feel like I just hunt it down and shot it. I definitely understand the name though. It is what it tries to be and I can certainly appreciate that. Just... not my cup o' tea."
"Pours a dark as night black, very minimal khaki colored head, but leaves some light lacing. Smell is of rum, molasses, raisin, hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is dark malt forward with dark chocolate and coffee taking center stage. Backed up by lighter notes of molasses, rasisin, plum. Faint earthy and smoky qualities. Full bodied, dry, earthy, slightly chalky. Good RIS, true to style, big bold flavors and nice balance with a well hidden ABV (in the taste anyway). Only downer was the overly alcohol scent."
"Pours jet black with thin dark head. Nose is roasted malts and hops. Flavor is a kiss of sweetness with a grassy hop flavor, with a full body and sticky sweet finish with a strong lingering bitterness. The detractors are that the hops are a bit overemphasized for my taste, it's a bit close to motor oil in consistency, and a bit overpriced. Still, a tasty treat."
"Very drinkable, I wish I had the ability to get more of this in the New England area. a great RIS"
"Overall impression - a big, very complex outstanding imperial stout."
"Great beer. Highly reccomend."
"D - Haven't had an Expedition without the aging, but it seems to have held up in fine form over the past 3+ years. Alcohol is fairly high, but thats to be expected. Certainly worth seeking out, as this is a fine example of a hearty American stout."
"The feel is very heavy and viscous with a decent drinkability."
"Really enjoyed this. Top-notch - bold, rich and impressive stout. There's no subtlety here."
"Coffee, soy sauce, prune aroma. Black color with dark, one-finger head that dissipated quickly. Sweet and heavy but dark chocolate finishing notes keep the sweetness at bay. Thick and chewy on the palate. Good carbonation keeps the beer alive in your mouth despite its heaviness. Long finish. A very big beer."
"I found this offering from Bell's to have a solid body, while being both rich and creamy. Drinks very well and I would love to have this available to me more often. Might make a great dessert beer or even pour well into a dessert recipe."
"Mouthfeel is thick,smooth, velvetty, richly of chocolate, bitter cocoa, a potent punch of hops and mild, mild carbonation that makes this almost like syrup. ABV is present and I'm still on the fence with this"
"D-This could definitely use some time to mellow--quite a few months at the least. Hopefully the flavours will develop to work together, rather than being somewhat disagreeable as it is now."
"Overall I was not disappointed with Expedition Stout. I have heard that it's a little rough fresh, and I couldn't agree more. With some age, it could be impressive."
"Big thanks to Stephen for hooking be up with a couple bottles of this."
"D- I'd have another, but not much more than that in an evening."
"Pours pitch black with very, very minimal head. Seems very low on carbonation. Smell is strong of soy sauce and coffee, I don't remember smelling the soy so strong last time I had this beer. Has a raisin type smell on the end. Taste is not very reminiscent of the aroma of the beer. Very roasty and toasty. I get a coffee grind and dry cocoa taste. A large bitter hop profile as well. The beer fills the mouth and sticks around, with a nice syrupy finish. Not too drinkable IMO, halfway between a sipper and a standard Imp stout."
"The taste is a mixed bag. Thankfully, the soy smell does not translate to the flavor profile. There's a bit of soy there, but not enough to be offputting. The first sips begin well, but the balanced sweetness is soon overwhelmed by the char and alcohol finish. The finish is too bitter, too boozy, simply too much. I've heard so much about how this beer ages and I sincerely hope that the conventional wisdom is true because it's kind of a mess fresh. The alcohol and burnt toast flavors have to moderate and the sweetness has to develop before this beer is worth your time. Hopefully that's exactly what will happen. Will check back a year from now."
"D: Was impressed by the complexities in the taste, the finish was slightly less than desirable, but one of the top stouts on my list."
"Drinkabiltity: Due to the rich mouthfeel and high abv, this beer is a sipper, but man is it a good one. I really enjoyed this beer and if you can pick up a single, I would not hesitate to buy it, but the 6 pack price is a bit much for a beer which is somewhat difficult to finish due to its size."
"Might let the other 5 sit a year. Not sure if I want another six pack just yet."
"Poured a jet black into a snifter. Almost zero head, but a crema lies on top with a trace of light lacing. Smells pretty sweet-raisins, malty goodness, prunes. Taste is by far the best part of this stout-starts of sweet, followed by some bitterness from chocolate that start pushing out the sweet. I like the balance of this. Mouthfeel is pretty good, smooth and velvety on the tongue. I could drink this all night long."
"My first RIS, this is an interesting experience. I really love the bold medley of flavors going on in the beer, and despite its big flavor, ABV and mouthfeel, I find it surprisingly drinkable. I'll probably purchase another one and lock it away for a year or two to see how it changes."
"Overall I quite enjoyed this brew. It held up fabulously over the year and is a great deal for an RIS at $15 a sixer. I would love to snag one of these a bit later in the year when the cold comes in and the snow sets, a real winter warmer."
"D- The strong tastes in this beer would leave me with the wanting to have another stout rather than grabbing another one of these. No problem finishing this though."
"Drinkability: This was sooo damn thick, but in small portions it worked out fantastically. I doubt I could have drank this whole vertical on my own, let alone more than one bottle, but I'm still gonna give drinkability a high score since my only complaints are based on assumptions."
"Good, but I expect more from Bells."
"This has to be one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had yet. Granted I haven't delved too deep into the style, but this certainly inspires me to try more."
"D- Overall, this was a great stout. I had tried it years ago before having some of the hyped greats and I would say that the aroma and taste of this were remarkably similar to the '08 vintage of DL. It was noticeably thinner, however, and slightly more carbonated. The finish in the taste was also a little more plain that I had hoped for. A really remarkable brew that doesn't get enough credit, most likely because of the fact that it is not rare."
"Drinkability: Overall, a luxurious (if somewhat raw) late evening sipper. While not my favorite RIS, it is still quite delectable."
"Overall, a solid Imperial Stout. I know that this beer is highly regarded on the ""other"" beer rating web site (pretty sure it's Top 10 in the world) but I think this site has the rating closer to it's actual rating. It's a great RIS, don't get me wrong, just not spectacular. The 08 I had was actually a lot better than this, so I'll see how these do in a year or two or three, and get back to you."
"D - A complex sipper, Expedition was a pleasure from start to finish. This is one that I'll be sure to keep around in the cellar."
"While I do not believe this to be the most accurate representation of an RIS, I do believe it to be one of the most creative ones. I am glad I have 5 more waiting for me."
"Drinkability takes a slight hit due to a high ABV, but I wont dock points for that, this is a Russian after all. Whatever I did not like about this when young (alot) is completely opposite now. I would not do more than one of these a night though and won't drink it in a bottle younger than two years. You need to take your time with this to see what it holds."
"D- The flavors are bit high on the high notes and ever so slightly disjointed but not to a fault. Man I can't even imagine how good this beer would be with a years plus age on it. I'm a huge fan."
"D: Not the best interpretation of the RIS style. Its not malty enough and the carbonation in the mouth takes away from the whole picture that the different flavors try to paint. It also makes this brew less robust. Heard a lot of hype, but this one isn't for me."
"D: While I'm really digging this beer, it's just a little to thick and heavy for me to drink more than one in a sitting. It's definitely a sipper"
"Batch #8311, 2/7/08. Poured vigorously into a Unibroue tulip to stimulate a light brown thick head atop a black body. Never had one fresh and probably never will after smelling this liquid gold. Aroma is of dark chocolate, toasted malts and the sweetness of a RIS with some age on it, and its bursting out of the glass. Beautiful smell, simply spectacular. Taste follows closely to the aroma and it should be noted how easy it is to drink this one is considering the ABV. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and almost seems chewy. Buy this one by the case and find a place to stick it for a few years. Drink from the old cases, keep buying new ones. Do it. Just do it."
"Pours an inky black with a rich, frumpy brown head. Smells are remarkably toasty (rather than roasty) with a dark chocolate aroma as well. The taste, on the other hand, is very roasty indeed. Big flavors of dark and burnt chocolate, with some sweet phenolic action going on. My favorite Bell's beer. Very good stuff."
"Flying Saucer Charlotte. All black pour with 1 finger brown head. More booze and bourbon in the aroma than I ever remember this having. Heavy roast, molasses as well. This is BIG this year, either that or it's just so long since I've had it on draft. Full body, thick oily mouthfeel. I could swear this was barrel aged. A large amount of oaky toffee accents the heavy roast malts chocolates and espresso. Mild hops in the bite at the finish. Not nearly as much dark fruits as I've noticed in the past and much more of this barrel like qualities. Excellent, big sipper."
"Pours a deep, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Smoky coffee-ish aroma has a hint of unsweetened chocolate. Flavor is smoky and surprisingly bitter, and has an undertone of chocolate and a hint of molasses. Texture is very smooth and tingly, and leaves a rather bitter aftertaste, not hoppy bitter but a tad unpleasing. Nevertheless, this is overall a darned good beer."
"This beer came highly recommended by a knowledgeable friend; he did not lead me astray. This is a great beer. It pours a thick and aromatic head, dark in color, as is the liquid itself. Impenetrable by light. Very deep, rich chocolaty taste that lingers. Minor detraction is that it is a bit heavy on the alchohol, but then, it is a Russian Imperial Stout, and that comes with the territory. Highly recommend the beer, another winner from Bell's."
"Wow, I think I may have discovered my new favorite RIS! This is a great beer for savoring. Each sip provides a massive flood of sensory input, very nice and very warming on this first cool day and night we've had here in North Florida this year. I'm drinking this with nearly a year of aging on it, I can only imagine it with another year or so. Simply amazing!"
"I'm drinking this one hot off the presses, just a couple weeks after it arrived on the shelves. It looks black, or at the very least a dark brown-black. Not much head to speak of and just the faintest amount of caramel-colored lace. The aroma isn't exactly weak but it's not strong. I'm definitely picking up some roasted malt and a bit of dark fruit, maybe raisins. There's also a bit of alcohol in the bouquet that carries over in the flavor and while it's not really unpleasant, it doesn't seem to add anything. I hope and assume that will mellow with age. The flavor leads with some bittersweet chocolate and a trace of a sweeter caramel. It's followed quickly and overpowered by a strong, bitter, roasted malt and coffee flavor. The raisin-ish dark fruit flavor is still around and comes through a bit more as the beer warms up and seems more noticeable on the finish. There's definitely a nice complexity to this beer that seems to attach itself to every part of my palate and it has nice mouth-coating and warming qualities. When fresh, it definitely seems to show it's youth and is quite aggressive and biting but I can definitely see this beers potential to age nicely. I'd let this one sit for six months or so at least to let it mellow out a bit and allow some of it's more subtle qualities to step forward."
"Pours a thick brown black that looks like used motor oil with a small brown head. Aroma is loaded with roasted hops, malts, coffee beans and molasses. Flavor is much the same with almost a cognac like note. Lots of coffee flavor on the finish with a notable alcohol burn. Nice medium full body."
"BTW, I'm thinking my first impression of Expe Stout would have been around 2.2 to 2.5, and now is a 4.05."
"This should probably be aged to cut down on the bitter flavor. Not the most drinkable at this moment. An RIS should have some trace of sweetness. My concern is that if the carbonation goes away this quickly, it will be nonexistent with age."
"Overall, like I mentioned earlier, one of the best stouts I've had for how bitter, heavy, and complex it is. The 11% can take a toll though. Be warned, it's a beast!"
"12oz bottle. I really wasn't terribly impressed with Bells's other stouts, but this is pretty damn good stuff. I'm going to skip the beer color and go right to the head because that's really all that sets stout apart; I mean, you know it's black, right? has a good sized brown head off the bat, but settle into a solid ring of tan foam in a couple minutes. Big, vinous, chocolate, port-like aroma, with cherry and other fruity accents. Like a delectable black forest cake in a glass really. The flavor is the same rich dark chocolate with fruity, port-like complexity. You can tell that there are plenty of hops to balance the malt, but they don't really protrude at all. There is a light alcoholic bite in the finish that reminds you how strong this is and dries enough sugar off on your tongue to invite the next sip. Thick, mouth-coating body. Definitely the most balanced imperial stout that I have had to date. Amazing beer actually"
"Drinkability is mainly hurt by just how massively hoppy this beer is. Big, big bitterness works against that aspect. Still, a tasty treat."
"Up until now I've only had fresh Expedition because I hadn't the will power to age any longer than half a year. This is almost sublime with 3 years on it and I wish I had more. Thanks again to acme to tossing me this great aged bottle."
"Overall- this is one hearty beer. not so much in the full bodied but the 10.5abv. i'm not usually a stout fan but i can dig this one. like i said you could only have a couple. i recommend this to any stout fan. would be better during some freezing cold weather or a family xmas party. haha."
"overall i feel that the age seems to bring out complexities, although not necessarily for the better. then again, it could've just been that particular batch. either way, i still think this is a great RIS."
"D - Medium and not bad for the style. Good in small servings. At least this comes in 12oz bottles so you'll never feel like you have to finish a whole bomber of this stuff."
"D - While I love and respect this beer for what it is, it is not drinkable. It's thick as molasses and twice as strong but don't get me wrong; it's a great sipper for a cold winter day. Otherwise the alcohol is a bit too present for my tastes. This big beer demands all of your attention and would substitute well for a cup of coffee and breakfast in the morning, however; one is plenty. Sip slowly and enjoy for a while."
"drinkability - while i would not drink more then a 12oz bottle i immensely enjoyed every sip"
"MF&D - the feel is perfect, no doubt about it; just thick and viscous enough, not less, and not going into american double territory. the amount of booze and the presence of it will eventually wear one down, however."
"A huge beer with huge flavors. One hell of an imperial stout."
"I had a bottle of Expedition right after a bottle of Old Rasputin and the difference in mouthfeel was very apparent. It is thick and coats the tongue. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. A very good RIS. The only bad thing about it is the price here in Alabama. (17.50/6-pack)"
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this RIS. For me the nose was much more complex than the actual flavors of the beer. For being aged for nearly a year I expected this beer to be much more complex. I have had a year old Stone RIS that was much more complex. However, I enjoyed this RIS and will consider purchasing a six pack the next time it is released."
"overall a damn fine and tasty brew."
"D- So tasty that it gets high marks even though its such a burly beer. Definitely a sipper though."
"Overall: an excellent RIS and one that I am glad was only 12oz. A bomber would have been too much."
"mouthfeel is great. thick and chewy. drinkability is hindered by the alcohol sting and the thickness, though it is still very good."
"J"
"overall one of the best ris out there why is this not in the top 100??? oh well i digress"
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours pitch black whit a one finger dark tan head that pretty quickly reduces to almost nothing. The head that is left leaves almost nothing as lacing down the glass. The smell is typical of the style, coffee and chocolate mainly stand out. There is also the typical roasted smell found in stouts. As far as taste goes it starts off kind of boozey with chocolate following shortly after. The chocolate stands out more right after the booze and especially when it warms up. There is some coffee in the taste that is in there but it's not jumping out or anything. Mouthfeel is typical of the style, kind of thick but not to thick to become chewy and not to thin just right in there to be perfect. Drinkability wise this one is right in there. Once this warms up a bit it's very very good. I could easily do a few of these in a sitting (which I have). Overall a very good RIS. The alcohol may be more apparent than other RIS' but this one is still very solid. At the bar I tired this at I will be getting it as long as they have it in and I will be picking up some when I can find it in a store. A good RIS and worth trying if you have the chance."
"D: Well, this is one I can't wait to see what others thought. I look at the average to gauge if i want to try it, but NEVER look at individual ratings prior to tasting. 10.5% ABV. Well, thats pretty big. Not an 'everyday' beer, but, a nice beer-in-a-snifter offering. I've never been a big fan of RIS, but, this one seems to agree with me--alot."
"Just an amazing beer, so well balanced for a RIS. Tons of complexity, dark fruits, coffee roastiness and chocolate sweetness. I love the roastiness in this beer, it keeps the dark fruitiness and alcohol in check. Unbelievable."
"This is a go-to-brew for those of you seeking an everyday stout."
"D- This is one killer RIS! Big and bold with a menacing amount of roasted flavor. The only thing that hurts its drinkability is the very noticeable alcohol level. One of these with a year or two on it would be fantastic!"
"D: Love this RIS. It's pretty smooth. Booze sneaks in here and there but overall it is pretty well hidden. The pronounced bitterness was a touch much for my personal tastes at times but it didn't stop me from pounding this back quicker than I intended to. Another great Bells beer and I'm sad it can't be found in Chicago."
"Conclusion: Great RIS...the alcohol is a bit hot, but this is fresh; I'd really like to see what a year or so in the cellar would do to this beer."
"D: One is fine, wouldn't want too many more than that and it wouldn't be great in all situations."
"Me thinks I'd rather have a Stone IRS or a Ten Fidy though."
"D: Nice to sip, but it's so heavy that I found myself taking a long time to finish the bottle."
"Overall, this seems like a typical imperial stout style...and I think it's a pretty good representation of the style. Not too outlandish, but not bad by any means. It's just good. Check it out."
"As you would expect, this is a sipper. It could be easily shared with 2-3 as a dessert beer. This isn't, to me, overtly chocolate-y for an imperial stout...I could see this contrasting really, really well with a quality chocolate dessert. One bottle is a bit much, however, at least for me."
"-Bye"
"this tasted like teriyaki sauce. It has alot or roasty, maybe even burnt tasting notes to it. I personally did not like this, this was my first imperial stout so i'm not quite sure what to expect. Personally i won't try this again, but i like stouts and porters enough to not give up on this style. This particular beer however was a little too bold, and not well balanced enough for me."
"This brew is a little untamed for its style, but definitely a solid offering from Bells, as always"
"D--I had this once before, early in my craft beer life, and I was underwhelmed. I thought it was too thick and boozy. I suspect that the less-than-world-class rating on Beer Advocate is due to the same reason. This beer is easy to find if Bell's distributes to your state, but it is not meant for a developing palate. But I can tell you that this is 10 times better than I originally thought. Definitely one of the best stouts in the world. And so damn smooth and easy to drink I can't help but be in awe."
"D - Again, this is a sipping beer. Thick and viscous, Imperial stouts do not lend themselves to chugging. If you want that drink a Bud, or better yet, don't do that."
"I like this stuff. I'm glad I picked up a sixer."
"A very solid RIS - tasty all the way around."
"Drinkability: Love this stuff. Glad I have 6 of them."
"A substantial beverage, to say the least, Expedition® is on a level playing field with the better stouts I've tried. It's rich, raw, and bursting with flavor. Impressive."
"Good stuff, I would like to age one and see it progress."
"I found myself drinking this one rather quickly and had a few in a sitting. For an imperial, this has got to be one of the easiest to drink that I've had."
"It pours a luxurious dark color with medium fluffy head. The aroma is very inviting with chocolate and rich, dark malts. The taste is excellent, even though I must admit I'm not always the biggest fan of imperial stouts. To be honest, I often prefer a flavored (coffee or sometimes chocolate) stout to a ""regular"" version. Whatever the case, Bell's Expedition is an excellent brew! This beer has quite a kick, but it's so darn drinkable at the same time.This is the kind of imperial stout that makes me ask, ""Why don't I drink imperial stouts more often?"""
"This beer pours out like used motor oil leaving a tan halo around the sides. Nice coating of lacing as I drink. The smell of soy sauce first greets the nose with hints of chocolate followed by vanilla,port, and other dark fruits I don't know about. I let this warm up quite a bit so the flavors can develop. Dark fruits, espresso, bourbon, soy sauce, chocolate, and burnt flavors all in one sip. There is another round of flavors after you swallow. I get tastes of tobacco, vanilla, and other flavors my limited palate can't describe. There is a kind of unpleasent bitterness/booziness that I am sure would mellow out with age. This beer sits on the tounge thick and chewy. You would be a fool to drink several of these in a row. And a rich fool at that. Best to let it age. I wouldn't mind enjoying one of these once in a while."
"d: overall a nice brew with plenty going on"
"What to way to celebrate my graduation from college, with eight big beer for eight straight nights, but in the end, the sour holds the power to winning. Girardin joins Anchor Steam and Hacker Weiss as the winners of the Unorganized Invitaitonal series. I won't be in school to have another end of the year celebration with beer, but I will continue to carry on the tradtion. Check back around this time next year for the Fourth edition. Good night everyone!"
"Drink ability was above average. Being 11 percent, the alcohol was definitely apparent and inhibited it from being more than a sipping type beer. Over all , this is a good RIS, but just doesnt have the same qualities as the really great stouts like Ten Fidy and Stone IRS"
"I think this is too extreme for me, but it is to style. Although well within the style guidelines this beer just doesn't make me want to go back for more. The alcohol and super strong flavors are cloying to the palate."
"Is Bell's planning on coming to Massachusetts anytime soon?"
"Overall, this is a decent IRS, but does not live up to the hype. I'd easily place Stone's RIS and Old Rasputin above this one. Heck, give me a Kalamazoo or Double Cream/Expedition Blend over this one. Too rough around the edges for my tastes/abv needs to be better masked, a boozy mess IMHO."
"M - Thick, viscous, but smooth, nice fizzy carbonation."
"D - I like this one, but if I had to choose a regularly available RIS, I'd take an Old Rasputin RIS any day of the week. Will drink again."
"D - Very drinkable RIS. Not much alcohol presence, just a little warmth. Very balanced with just the right flavors going on. Simple and refined."
"D: Don't know if I could do more than one in a sitting, but a very good beer, and one I will go back to a lot. Has a big taste without the big price tag. This would be great to cook with too... mmmm.. Stout bacon burgers."
"I would definitely drink this again."
"D- Tough ABV, but definitely a good sipper. Another good brew from Bells."
"D: A great RIS here, just wish I could get it more living in CA. Probably one of the easiest drinking big beers I've had."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I have another 4 beers, for aging, and look forward to them."
"Poured and formed a perfect head that was a chocolate brown color to it. The perfect head gave a great aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and dark fruits. The head dissipated after a few minutes and left a wonderful chocolate lace on the glass. Taste was wonderfully complex, as a mix of roasted malts and chocolate powered forward with a support of dark fruits and the slightest hint of coffee. Carbonation was a medium intensity which helped the flavors shine in this particular beer. The flavors and carbonation levels seemed to feed of each other and every sip I felt one was stronger then the other. I really enjoyed this Stout as it was not overwhelming on any front, and forced my self to purchase a six pack to last til this winter. Mouth feel was fine as the carbonation and alcohol was not overwhelming at all. Drink ability is good as I could probably drink three in a session and be good, but you will feel the alcohol creep up on you fast."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper. I was kind of unimpressed with this stout. There is a bunch of hype going on about it because we're finally getting it here in Charleston. Enjoyable."
"An aggressive pour produced only a scant head that faded quickly, mocha colored over motor-oil darkness as expected. Nose was faint, doughy, some sweetness, dark chocolate, and smallest bit of smoke. Taste followed suit though a bit of bitterness and alcohol picked up in the middle but good flavor and certainly on par with the style. Overall mouthfeel was somewhat lacking without carbondation. This has a smoothness to it though would have expected a bit more 'pop' and that, along with a relatively high ABV rates it low on drinkability for me."
"D - A damn fine brew! I tend to like milk stouts and oatmeal stouts for their smoothness and lack of sharp bitterness that can often be found in ""regular"" stouts, since although I am a caffeine addict, I am a person who puts tons of creamer and Splenda in my coffee. This is a top-tier selection in a style filled with top -tier selections. Good stuff!"
"This was a great beer. Curious to see how a fresh version would compare to this one. Also would like to try the BA version."
"Not as good as I remember when living in Northern Indiana, but still a pretty good RIS."
"Got this as part of a ""beer stimulus"" package from jfunkk79. Haven't had this beer in years... yum. Real black and dense looking, with a healthy brown head. This beer has a very full roasted malt aroma. Deep and a bit smoky. Carries over to the taste as well. Deeply roasty, nice and bitter, a touch of burnt char and leather. Big flavors. This is definitely a sipper. Maybe a little bit hot, but plenty of character to cover it up. Thick, viscous mouthfeel. Would love to age this so it's a bit softer, but as is it's a totally worth stout."
"The smell of this beer is roasty with a light barbeque flavor. The pour is very dark like motor oil. As the beer settles in the pint glass, the look is very thick with a flat head. The taste is definitely stouty with a strong alcohol feel on the backend. A good stout that is worth another try."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and carbonated. The body of the beer is thick and the finish linger for a few moments. I do have a few issues with this beer. The beer to me is a bit sweet. I feel that there is really no bitterness that makes a great RIS. Don't get me wrong it is an okay beer, but nonetheless it is not a great RIS. After a 5 minutes the beer went flat."
"D: Highly, highly drinkable. Grab two of these and sip 'em for the rest of the night."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel, malty sweetness and a nice hop tart in the back of the mouth. Bit of a heavy finish but I'm not minding too much. This would probably age well. Highly Recommended."
"D: Decent for a high ABV stout (10.5%).  The alcohol is hidden fairly well at the start, but it does begin to assert itself with a peppery flash and a noticeable warming sensation once you delve deeper into the bottle.  A sipper, but I imagine that some cellaring would really round off the alcohol and push some of the complexities to the next level.  Still, what Bell's has created is a pleasant RIS. A bevy of roasted flavors blend into a creamy, delicious body that IMO lives up to the hype.  My friend's told me to check this stout out, and after having a good first impression with Bell's via their Kalamazoo Stout, I must say I am quite pleased with their bigger, badder Expedition Stout.  The cost is a bit steep ($15.50 for a 6er) but a local place sells single bottles for $2.50 a pop, so I may very well purchase a couple more bottles just to see how this beer ages."
"Drinkability: It's a very good beer, but definitely sits heavy like most RISs are apt to do, so I don't feel like I would want to sit through too many of these because I would start to feel like a bit of a load."
"The aging did this beer a lot of justice. Expedition is a phenomenal stout, but the aging adds a lot more to the balance and attack. It's not a beer of which you could probably enjoy more than one at a time and I still don't think it stacks up with some of the other heavy hitters in that style, but it's got it where it counts."
"The dark fruit nose's juxtaposition to the velvety chocolate mouthfeel really complement each other nicely."
"On tap it was a bit less aggressive carbonation wise."
"I don't care if it takes an expedition to find this beer, it's worth searching out! Bell's Brewing should be conferred the highest possible accolade of beer for their lineup of stouts, of which the Expedition is arguably the most impressive. This Michigan brewery allows you to have your cake and (literally) drink it too!"
"WOO WOO--I see that I am the 1,000th reviewer!"
"Poured thick with nary a head into my nonic. Interesting cherry hue to its mahoganey color.  10.5 abv. Nice. Wow...a lovely and up front nose. Butter, vanilla, maybe cherries and raisens. Wow again. Soy sauce, chocolate, slight alcohol bite in the finish. Spectacularly complex taste and full body. Heavy and special. A special St Patricks day treat but equally enjoyable with a fire in the hearth and after a fine meal."
"Drinkability - This turned out to be a bad ass mofo of a beer, especially since I put some age on it. I can tell it did it well, as it prolly smoothed out some of the original harshness and allowed it to settle down into a smooth well rounded beauty. I expect nothing but the best from bells."
"D - I thought this was an enjoyable stout. It has everything you would want in a good stout. Great balance, nothing fancy, just a nice sipping stout. Maybe a tad much sweetness but not too bad. Something different. Defintely worth a go."
"This stout is think and a mouthful. A great winter beverage."
"D: This beer makes me realize I like a little sweetness and interested hop profile to my stouts. A good sipping beer, but won't get me excited anytime soon. Would be curious how an aged Expidition would taste, but probably even lower carbonation than when it's relatively fresh."
"D- Great, I just love thick and viscous stouts and this fits the bill perfectly."
"Drinkability: I thought this was very tasty. I could drink several of these if it were not for the high ABV. I think this is a nice and complex RIS."
"The body is big. A lot of sweetness but balanced nicely with the roast and astringency. For me a bit too astringent but really nit picky here. Overall a fantastic RIS."
"Very dark in color, and pour resembles motor oil as many good stouts do. Hard pour created about 3 fingers worth of head in standard pint glass. Lacing is strong with every sip noticeable on my glass. Smell immediately reminds me of roasted coffee, with hints of raisins and chocolate. Taste is not a let down, as my nose is spot on with my tongue with a good amount of sweetness, and a wee bit of smokeyness that makes this stout an even easier drinker. As a hop-head I find myself more and more attracted to stouts as a night-cap as my palate continues to evolve, but my brain does not, as this beer has a shocking 10.5% ABV."
"Drinkability is better than good. If I were to enjoy a Russian Imperial Stout while throwing frisbee on a sandy Hawaiian beach, this'd be the one. I marvel at the 10.5%. As I try to make sense of the discrepancy b/w BA and the bros on this one, I figure that the Expedition is quaffable enough for us Plebians to appreciate it, but not quite distinctive and unique enough for the bros (i.e. Patricians) to outright endorse it with an ""A" or a ""B"."
"I thought Expedition Stout was actually pretty drinkable fresh. With 21 months on it, it's hard to keep it in the glass. Really, really tasty stuff. Can't wait to put some more years on my remaining bottles."
"Overall this is a magnificent beer. This doesn't try to be an easy going beer and it doesn't try to make everybody happy. When bells set out to make a powerfull stout they pulled out all the stops. I'm a huge fan."
"Recommended...."
"Feel's great going in... nothing too special. It's a strong beer but after one you can easily drink another... and you'll want to!"
"D: A solid sipping RIS."
"Pours a thick black with a brown head that slowly settles. Overall rich aromas of chocolate and coffee with hints of fruity alcohol esters; smooth mouth-feel. Alcohol stands out, but is well balanced by the bold flavors. For being an Imperial Stout guy, this is my favorite."
"Pitch black with a thick molasses/syrup like pour. Very light carbonation. Sweet smells like maple syrup, brown sugar, dates, and oatmeal. Very sweet initial flavor, followed by a rush of burning alcohol, followed by a very bitter finish. Unfortunately the alcohol probably lasts the longest. Very thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Not an easy drinker in any terms.. a slow sipper."
"-Dotson"
"M: Very heavy with little carbonation and extremely silky. I've heard many complaints about the carbonation level, but it's just where I like it for a big stout like this one. It's also fairly drinkable for the style and how big it is. Could easily do a couple bottles."
"I was glad this was split two ways. I have had other boutbon type stouts but without the subtle compexities and joyous notes this maybe my first and last time ""ringing the bell""."
"This beer is very viscous almost chewy, but it's also very delicious. But I probably couldn't have more than one of these at a time."
"One of my first forays in to RIS as a newbie to crafts trying to develop my palate. I was that this beer was good enough to pour over ice cream because of its chocolate and coffee tones, and I was not let down. Excellent stout, great rich flavor. The texture was slightly syrupy and felt very pleasant. Looking forward to more from Bells."
"Drinkability: This is a beer to sip and enjoy but its hard to imagine drinking more than one in an evening. Indeed one may be more than enough."
"Drinkability - A very heavy beer, personally I could only drink one or so in a sitting. I enjoyed it in small sips best."
"I waited a fairly long time to get my hands on an Expedition. Expectations were huge. The stout pours a fairly thin black, carbonation barren liquid. The lack of any sort of head and carbonation really hurts this brew. Hard to get a handle on the smell. I get some roasted elements, along with a vegetable oil bleh. Not appealing. The taste is weak chocolate, roasted barley, and the vegetable unpleasantness again. I'm hoping that this batch might have gotten funked. Hopslam is an amazing imperial style brew, I can't see Bell's missing this badly. This beer was hard to finish. Hopefully one of the last 3 in the sixer changes my opinion."
"good drinkability here."
"A really good representation of a stout. Bought a single bottle at Capone's in Norritown. No place else in the NJ/Eastern PA area have I ever seen this available."
"Overall - A very tasty stout, though one that I am looking forward to aging both to allow flavors to emerge/meld and so the alcohol recedes."
"Overall, a pretty good RIS but not the best example of this style."
"Definitely a sipper brew. But watch out, the 10.5% ABV creeps in unnoticed."
"D: I had to drink this pretty slowly, and I wouldn't want to drink any more, at least not until the next day. I liked this more than Old Rasputin. I feel like some people might dislike the low carbonation. But if you can buy just one bottle of this, try it."
"Impressions: Reminds me a lot of Yeti in that it's a hop forward Impy Stout. Also in that way, most of the flavor comes from the harsh roast malt. Not much impressions of coffee or chocolate flavors at all. Slightly grassy, very hoppy in finish. Almost lingers like an IPA on the palate. Not much depth of flavor for me, unfortunately. I can see where the bros comment on a lack of creaminess, this feels pretty flat and dead to me. Dead hops linger on the palate, there is no refreshment, no cleansing to it. This may be the least enjoyable Impy stout I've had thus far. While it's not terrible, there are many others I've enjoyed more."
"Drink-good winter warmering beer, thick, very different experience than with other imperial stouts, good on occasion, but a bit pricey"
"Notes: While Bell's has produced a pretty solid RIS here, it's just not up to snuff with the elites in such a top-heavy category. Still a really good beer, and if I could buy a sixer for a decent price it would be in my rotation. Just wish Bell's would expand their distribution west!"
"Quite easy for me to drink, but this is the style that I search out. As a sipper, this one is excellent. Be careful of the high ABV, though."
"Poured nearly black with a thin brown head that quickly disappears into a thin ring of bubbles around the outside edge. The smell was of chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and dark, nearly burnt, malt notes. The taste was very similar to the smell. Coffee was a dominant flavor to me, along with hints of chocolate and a touch of spice. The alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. The mouthfeel was thick and silky, with very little bitterness from the hops and alcohol. This was a very solid RIS. It was very drinkable and I will be looking to get some more of this one in the very near future! Yet another winner from Bells!"
"Overall: Fantastic RIS. Wish Bell's was available in MA so I could enjoy it more often."
"This is one great brew that I will drink again. It was absolutely delicious, and I didn't have any problems with carbonation like some other reviewers mentioned. One solid stout that will definitely make it on my list to try again."
"A great beer that I wish I had access to. If this were the case I would certainly have a good amount around the house."
"Just not a very good RIS in my opinion. I wonder if I got a bad bottle. I will try this stout again. Just not any time soon."
"not sure i would rush out to buy this one again...would be interested to find it on tap to compare...could imagine this stout being more enjoyable out of the tap...."
"Just a wonderful Imp Stout"
"After many recommendations I gave in and bought a bottle. I have to admit it has a very interesting/enjoyable taste. I particularly like the blend of sweetness, bitterness, and roasted flavors rolled all in one."
"Drink: Pretty drinkable, sweet and tasty. The higher abv is hidden quite well in my opinion."
"It drinks like a meal and at 10.5% that meal ought to be dinner."
"The mouthfeel of this stout was viscous as one might expect from a beer of this color, flavor intensity and ABV. It was pleasant to sip and a pleasure to drink. Keep up the good work Bell's!"
"Overall: This remains one of my favorite imperial stouts and is a must try. So go get it!"
"D-GOOD BEER! I really enjoy this brew. It's exceedingly easy to drink, while its flavor profile demands the drinker's respect. Approach with caution: you will fall for this beer. Good thing it comes in six-packs."
"Definitely plan to hang on to some of these to age for a while. I split a bottle from the same 6 pack with my dad in December and I feel like it has already mellowed a bit in the past few months."
"M/D - really smooth, easy drinking for a 10.5%, I could get into alot of trouble. This is my favorite so far of this style."
"Pours a dark, jet black. 1/4 inch head of a dark tan color. Great retention and Good lacing. Smells strongly of sweet malt, slight hops, alcohol, and some roasted malts. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Thick and smooth mouth feel. Low carbonation level present, and a noticeable bitterness and dryness left on the palate. Tastes of strong malt, roasted malt, slight hop kick noticeable, some chocolate, and an overall sweetness. Strong body along with a slight alcohol flavor. Overall, a good complex beer full of different malt flavors."
"Pours out a pitch black color with a massive foamy brown head. Very beautiful. Some decent retention and lacing. Looks like a beer you want to drink. The smell is the least exiting aspect. Really I only get a smell of alcohol and carbonation. You might be able to detect some sweetness and roasted coffee type smells if you try hard. The taste is really great though. There's a caramel sweetness, almost like cola, but its backed with a deep roasted flavor. There is a sort of barbequed soy sauce taste which is a bit harsh but nice and interesting. The taste is accompanied with a nice pleasant burn. The mouthfeel is amazing. There's a wonderful creaminess and a ton of complexity. The carbonation is not overly done, which makes the alcohol burn not too harsh. And I found it to be a great drinker. You want to reach back into it and taste more. Recommended to anyone interested in stouts."
"Pours motor-oil thick&black with a tiny tan head that hangs around 'till about half-way through. Smells like alot of roasted malts and mabye a touch of coffee or hops(something bitter). Taste is not as smooth as say, an Old Rasputin...still enough going on here to hide the alcohol(wich isn't noticeable at all). In all, a great IRS that came into my hands from afar. I woulden't miss a chance to try it again"
"D: I had to resist the urge to have another."
"This is my favorite beer, hands down, the stout by which all others are judged and fall short. Follow me if you will, but imagine that chocolate and espresso decided to make sweet, sweet love...and they invited over their friend roasted malt, that's what it's like (perhaps a graphic comparison, but I love this beer). It is heavy, hold it up to your eye and watch an eclipse with no fear...not that you'd see a thing. The alcohol content is heafty, I'd avoid (next time) having...oh...say 8 in 3 hours and attempting to stand up straight, but this is an exceptional beer in my opinion, and better enjoyed in moderation."
"Very drinkable"
"Where do I begin? Perhaps the best RIS I have had. Poured a deep thick black with a nice deep brown head. Carbonation was good. Nose is sticky, sweet with cocoa, espresso, roasted malts. Taste is very smooth. Lots of cocoa, coffee, roasted malts and maybe even some vanilla. Mouthfeel was great. Drinkability was awesome. So good and the 10.5 ABV was well disguised. Awesome brew."
"This beer pours very dark with a 1/2 fingered dark tan head with some lacing. The smell is of molasses. The flavor has hints or dark chocolate, some molasses as well as some burnt sugar flavors. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy but the low carbonation holding it back. There is alot of roasted malts in this brew you can majorly taste them in the aftertaste. A decently drinkable brew, I will look for it next time I am @ Bell's."
"Overall- This is a pretty big beer, 12 ounces of this RIS is all you really need. Small bottle.. big beer."
"D - This was a good Imperial Stout, a little more booze on the taste than I like, except in the case of Bourbon Cask aged, of course"
"[EDIT: I'm really thinking my bottle had gone bad. I will seek out and re-review this beer as soon as I can.]"
"D: Despite the 10%+ abv I could drink several of these. Not something you'd normally say about a RIS, which is a testament to how well this one is balanced."
"Overall Impressions: This is good imperial stout. It has a very interesting difference from aroma to taste. While the aroma screams fruit and had me excited for something a bit different than the typical coffee/chocolate/molasses dominated impy stouts, ultimately it is the cocoa and molasses that rule the flavor. I'd definitely buy this one again and it's the best offering I've had from Bell's, but it has some flaws."
"D: one per session please, it's best to let it warm over an hour and get all the flavor changes"
"I haven't had this beer for probably 4 years so I picked up a single to re-try. I enjoyed it more than years ago as I am more used to the big stouts these days. It was good but probably could use a little age to mellow out the alcohol a bit."
"Drinkability: Tastes great and is fairly drinkable for a full bodied low carbonation brew."
"Thanks Steven.. I've been waiting to enjoy this one for way to long.. I've had the Expedition a couple of times before, but never took the time to really sit back and savor..."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I really enjoy sipping on this beer during a cold winter evening. It has a nice complexity while balancing the sweetness with a deep rich bitterness. This beer is a bit expensive, but definitely worth indulging in about November and sipping one from time to time through January."
"Drinks like a session beer. If not for the $16 price for a 6 pack, this would be a session beer, regardless of the abv. Love this beer,hate the price, and that is why it doesn't get a perfect in drinkability."
"D- Fairly easy to drink although it would be more drinkable if it hid it's alcohol a little better."
"This being a vintage review I will say I have had fresh Expedition Stout. Definitely worth holding on to and cellaring for a few years. Like a nice Port wine or a sherry. I split this bottle with a friend and I just want to slowly sip on this alll night long."
"I probably would pass on buying this again as it is somewhat difficult to put down due to the chalky and boozy feeling."
"date consumed: 7 Dec 2008"
"D - I am generally pleased with this beer. It is something I will go back to from time to time, and piqued my interest in other RIS's. Overall, another fine brew from Bell's."
"D: Pretty drinkable, though a bit burnt and alcoholic. Decent beer."
"Ultra black color pour with a thin tan head that falls to a thin rim and hangs out till the end.Aroma of coffee,chocolate,caramel,dark roasted malt and some anise just to name a few that I could pick out.Flavor is DARK roast coffee,chocolate,some dark fruit like rasins and plums,and bitter hops. Very thick ,full body you can chew this stuff. A thing of beauty !"
"Drinkability: Better than out of the bottle, in my opinion. The flavors just really came through on this one, and I'm beginning to appreciate this beer much more than I previously did. Sure the alcohol's way up there, but it's well-hidden and really takes a backseat to the great array of flavors and aromas here. Recommended, as always."
"Poured entire bottle into 0.4 L snifter. Dark sediment covers the bottom of the bottle. Small very dark brown head. Pitch black in color. Aroma is of dark chocolate, coffe, raisins, rum, earthy, alcohol. Very thick body, coats the glass and tongue. Tastes of dark bittersweet chocolate, espresso, raisins, roasty malt. Alcohol is present throughout but never hot, would not guess it was over 10%, easy to drink. Lots of sediment in the glass. This is one of the better imperial stouts I've had. Would definitely seek out again."
"I was shocked by the Brothers review. This is one of my favorite Imperial stouts as well as one of my favorite beers. The taste is intense with a great alcohol warmth and bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is a big beer. A cold night, a fire place and an Expedition served not too cold is a true delight."
"The aroma and taste are very similar only blended together better than before. This is basically the perfect RIS and I see no way that it can possibly be topped. If I wouldn't die from it I could drink a keg of this. Age this one for a year and you will taste heaven."
"Wow! i must admit that i was shocked to see that ""the bros"" rated this a C. I love it! I just came in from a cold MN night and had one waiting for me at about 50 degrees. It poured with a nice head, and seemed to retain one to my satisfaction for a RIS. The taste warmed me up on this cold evening and exceeded my expectationso on the palate. Good job Bells !"
"Have the rest of the six pack cellared as I think this is a once a year type of beer. A great offering by Bells, but not something that I would want often."
"10/20/10: Sampled a nearly 1-year old bottle tonight -- still a little boozy and could use more time. Flavors are not very sweet and mostly bitter chocolate, coffee, and molasses."
"Overall I would rate this beer a solid find. Enjoy this one at the end of a evening or big meal. Very tasty!"
"D - An imperial stout I could actually drink more than one of. It was my original favorite RIS and I still enjoy cracking open a bottle any time I get the chance. Excellent."
"D: I can't say I could do more than one of these in a sitting, but it's pretty drinkable for a 10.5% RIS. It's a pretty smooth beer, but the alcohol and texture prevent drinking too much of it."
"O: A very big dark sweet ale almost milkshake like. I, personally, am not a fan of Imperial Stouts but I had to try this because I have heard so much about it. Its good."
"mouthfeel is thin from alcohol solventness but thick from everything else, roasty, bitter, enjoyable, mmm great flavors"
"Poured a dark brown bordering on black color with tan head that lasted a while and left nice lacing. Aroma was of chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, and coffee. Flavor is very similar with a bit of alcohol present in the taste. Good mouthfeel. Overall a good beer that I think might benefit from some aging."
"A sipper at best. I like sharp roasty stouts, but this is too much for me. The bitterness on the tongue lasted way past the next beer! Way out of balance on the roasty bitter side. I appreciate the boldness, but mom didn't. From memory, I thought I liked this one and will definitely have it again. Mom won't. Mom:""Not a drain pour, but I wouldn't get it again."" "almost like syrup."" Mom on aftertaste 30 minutes after it was gone and we were on another beer ""like if I had a tablespoon of pure molasses. I can't get it out of my mouth."""
"I have very low drinkability with this. It's very slightly warming as it goes down, and its taste is so sharp that it's definitely not something you'd want to drink one than one of... or in my case more than one sip of... I'm sure that this is good beer to some, but it was a struggle to make myself finish this beer; definitely not for me."
"Good beer but its very hot at its freshness.Will buy sgain though."
"D= average. Gets a little too sticky and boozy. As the beer warms the alcohol is more prevelant."
"I'm ecstatic that I had the chance to try Expedition Stout on-tap, though I can only wonder how an aged/cellared bottle might do to the alcohol taste. I suspect that this is too young to be at its optimum tasting age. Regardless, this was a decadent treat and an awesome stout that I would absolutely love to drink again."
"*Note* I don't know how to read their coding system, but my bottle had ""8 3 1 1 "" ink jetted on the back label."
"Not my favorite high ABV RIS."
"Taste is very rendolent of the nose. Bitter espresso, followed by rummy roasted malty fullness. Coffee, peppery spices, cocoa, jammy fruits, tobacco. The thickness of the mouthfeel is pleasant, as the alcoholic finish cuts through the richness, leading to a nicely balanced RIS. I would like to cellar a bottle of this for a year or so, to smooth out all rough edges. Thank you to Duffman for this bonus gift!"
"D - this isn't as hot and in-your-face as a fresh one. The flavors seemed to mellow out and blend together nicely. I'll see how it holds up for another year..."
"D: Can't drink too much of this stuff, but it pairs very well with cold nights."
"Seek out to try..."
"I do love this beer, at least once a year."
"When pouring the stout into an over sized wine glass, only a small head was formed, which has okay retention. When it was being poured, it looked like I was pouring motor oil. The nose on the beer is incredibly strong; it has hints of chocolate, roasty malts, and a pleasant sweetness. At 10.5% alcohol, it's impressive that the alcohol doesn't really come through in the nose; there is a slight hint, but it's not distracting at all. Sipping this beer at just above cellar temperature really accentuates the flavours. The beer has loads of roasted chocolaty flavours, with hints of alcohol. It's so balanced, that I could not quite sipping on the beer. Each sip contained something I had not previously tasted, but it must be mentioned that the beers complexity is perfect for the overal balance of the flavours. Some tasty hop flavours come through as well initially, while the bitterness comes from the roasted malts, the hop flavour is a nice addition. The mouthfeel is superb on the beer; it's exactly what I'd expect plus a little more. There is a light amount of carbonation and enormously thick mouthfeel. Solid. Drinkability on this beer is not easy to rate because the flavours are very tasty and I could drink many in a night, but I just won't see myself craving another one."
"All the bitterness creates a sort of tingling feeling on the tongue, and a dry after taste is left in the mouth upon swallow."
"D- Very easy to drink and maybe a little dangerous."
"Bells, you continue to impresses. I can't wait to purchase another 6 and cellar this stuff. Excellent."
"Overall, this was a huge surprise. This is definitely my favorite RIS besides some of the big limited release beers. Bell's definitely brought their ""A" game with this one."
"A top notch stout, just not my favorite style."
"Notes: I am so glad to have had this on tap. If this keeps up I may have to change my favorite style to Stouts. I have had some great ones lately."
"Wow. Expedition stout with a year on it....ti's God-like. Like a thick chocolate malt milk shake. The flavors are some complex and the body on the beer improves ten-fold. It was good fresh...it's incredible aged, even only 1 year."
"Future outlook: I suppose I'll sock a few of these away in the basement, cross my fingers, and hope for a better day with this beer in the distant future."
"but worth a try"
"8/5/10/5/18 (4.6/5)"
"D - This is a very good RIS. Potent and very well balanced."
"Perfection! Dark black pour with a coffee colored head. Very full aroma with hints of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, caramel. This beer is so smooth that it become dangerous at 10.5 abv. The flavor is very complex with malty chocolate and coffee, dark berries, and many other things that are silly to even try to list. Simply amazing!"
"The perfect beer for the first light snow of the year here in St. Louis. Drink it slow and enjoy. I need to buy one to age for a while. I think it would be worth the wait."
"D= While this is an outstanding RIS, it is not something I could have more than two of in a sitting due to the very strong flavors and heaviness. Still, I enjoyed this stout a lot and will definitely buy it again when I have the chance."
"This beer is phenomenal for the avid stout drinker, though not for the faint of heart."
"D- I was a bit anxious about having this young as I thought it would be too boozy, however, I found this to be very smooth. I look forward to seeing how these age.. if I can keep from drinking them all!"
"No compromises here. When you're in the mood for a thick, complex sipper, seems hard to beat this one. 12oz bottles an extra bonus."
"Pours black with a huge, creamy chocolate milk colored head into my Darkness tulip, leaving behind some nice lacing. Aroma is boozy off the bat, lots of alcohol that isn't terribly well-hidden in the nose, plus some notes of coffee, chocolate and graham cracker goodness. Flavor smacks you hard with roasted coffee flavors, backed up by some bitter roasted malt chocolatiness, and some green hops in the background that are barely noticeable because they get smacked around by the roasted malt. Very nice flavor, not overly complex, but very tasty. Thick, chewy mouthfeel, creamy, very nice carbonation for the style. The booze is very noticeable on this one and will do well in the cellar. I drank two of these, laid the other four down. Great stuff, a real treat. Probably the second best RIS I've tasted next to the one this glass was meant for. YUM"
"when popped an aroma of chocolate and coffee filled the room. another pops and had a smooth malt odor. but another with nothing. pour is great. opaque with thick creamy head of a dark chocolate color. lace indeed. good density. foam is delicious. on an aggressive pour head graduates from light to dark down into the beer. when right the smell is a wonderful blend. equally coffee, chocolate, molasses and caramel. (in a bad bottle a mild banana and dough. sticky on the lips in that one.) taste is sweet... not intensely. light apple. nice chives hop. lightly smoky. goes down warm and smooth. one of the doughiest over all RIS i've had. liquor like but smooth bitter when best put for an RIS. that wonderful honey malt warmth i seek in RIS when at its best. excellent after a meal during winter. would like to have along side a stone's."
"Overall, a real nice RIS that i am glad to try. I like the the potent flavors on both sides and how its balanced so well. It's not one i would say i must have again, but would be happy if that happens."
"D - Excellent cold weather beer. Could do really well with some age on it and does a pretty good job of hiding the high ABV"
"Nice creamy smooth mouthfeel suits the beer quite well. A great beer, but one I would need to be in the mood for to enjoy. Even so, I would love to have several on hand to drink at a moments notice"
"Overall, this is a great RIS. Not too expensive for a 6er and at 10.5% you really can't go wrong. I will be getting this every year. If you see this at the stores, do yourself a favor and buy some!"
"Edit: Give this one at least a year and it's beautiful. Give 2 years and it's easily one of the best RIS I've ever had."
"This one was not bad but also not good."
"Overall it is quite a very good stout. I will certainly enjoy having many more of these. It is perfect for a cold winter night."
"Still a very nicely drinkable cold night sipper. This is about as black as a beer gets."
"This beer pours jet black and is thick like motor oil. Smells of chocolate, coffee, dates, caramel and alcohol. The taste is chocolate, coffee and is nice and roasty. The mouthfeel is exceptional, very smooth, nicely carbonated despite what others have said and has that perfect chewyness. Considering the high abv this beer is exceptionally drinkable. I will only be drinking one at a time but I have to remind myself to savor the next one more slowly. Two of my favorite RIS now come from Michigan! This one is right up there with Kentucky Breakfast stout."
"A fantastic imperial stout, ranking among the best. A must try for sure."
"I'm not saying that I plan on buying this beautiful shit all that often, but if I could manage to keep a few bottles on hand for special occasions, I would be a happy camper. Mostly the best thing to come out of Michigan. Mostly."
"Poured a dark black with an averaged sized brown head. Aromas and tastes of mocha chocolates, roasted malts, and light bitter coffee. This is one good tasting beer. Alcohol content well hidden. Smooth and easy to drink."
"Rich and velvetty mouthfeel. In moderation, this one is quite drinkable."
"Medium bodied and overall a bit weird. Maybe this one needs to mellow or something because right now, it isnt very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Expedition is definitely for the cold weather. Not a drink to get sloppy beer, although at over 10% it wouldn't take all that many. I enjoyed it pre-dinner with soon to be family. This is a beer I would love to imitate in a homebrew."
":("
"Bottle acquired via trade with Ty. I had this beer once before from Eric and I was unsure how to rate it. It is really a great beer. Pours a dark black with a awesome brown head. The flavor is really complex: a hoppy bite, alcohol, burnt malts, sweet and dark fruit, coffee, chocolate, industrial sludge and various mineral deposits. Warm and inviting. The body is great: thick and rich, but also smooth. A great balance overall. Awesome."
"Overall: good, but a one timer for me"
"D- Ok not great, there are better RIS out there but if this is all you can get it will do."
"Good mouth. Medium full."
"Deep dark pour, very thick black with rich tan head. Great smell of dark fruits, molasses, roast coffee. A nice balance of roast and sweet. Taste is also very nice. Some sweetness of dark fruits and molasses up front followed by a deep roast flavor. They blend pretty effortlessly together. There is also a hop presence lying underneath, adding a nice edge. Creamy mouthfeel made of silk and and velvet. Perfect carbonation and the lightest tickle on the tongue from the faint complimentary hops. Quite drinkable and it reminds me why I enjoy this beer so much. I might have to pull out a bottle to keep that memory fresh in my mind."
"This is just a wonderful beer and when you come across it pick up as much as you can spare. This is easily my favorite bells beer. If you liked their Kalamazoo stout then you ain't seen nothin yet! We don't too often see an Imp stout this wonderfully made that pours, and holds, such a terrific head. One of my top 15 favorite beers. It's seasonal so get it when you can."
"This is a terrific and well crafted brew but a little too muscular for me most of the time. I can see having one as a nightcap on a cold winters night but otherwise drinkability isn't real high."
"Poured into my trusty Delirium Tremens snifter, explodes with a reverse-cascading, creamy mocha-colored head that settles down just before eclipsing the rim of the glass. The head very slowly fades to a 1 cm cap atop this impenetrably black brew, leaving beautiful, copious lacing everywhere. Perfection in appearance. Notes of bittersweet chocolate and roasty coffee in the nose. Taste follows smell, with the chocolate and coffee flavors mingling; a nice hint of hops is detectable on the finish as well. Mouthfeel was very nice, with a thick richness characteristic of the style. It didn't have the viscosity of Dark Lord, but then, exceedingly few do. Drinkability was exceptional; I found myself finishing the glass rather quickly and wanting more. Had to wake up early the next morning, so I refrained. At 10.5%, I can see how this one could get dangerous, as the flavor does not make the ABV apparent at all. A wonderful beer, and definitely one of my favorite stouts thus far."
"This is a nice beer, I might just have to pick up a sixer the next time I see this stuff. If they made this in uber limited quantities, people might just pilgramage for it."
"Drinkability: One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Amazingly drinkable, worth every penny. Having just moved to Kalamazoo, I'm going to be drinking a <i>lot</i> of this over the next few years...."
"D - Very tasty, very big. Not something I would session but certainly delicious"
"D - I found this way too rich and malty to enjoy."
"D: A big, hot, heavy drinking experience. This beer is a great sipper but still remains quite quaffable (in my opinion, i like my beers a bit hot), but again, this beer may be a bit too hot for its own good and risks overshadowing more subtle flavors that might be lurking beneath the surface."
"D: So big it's not that easy to drink. Can't hamper it THAT much though, because its to style. I'm laying down a couple of bottles of this to see how it ages. I would only hope that some of the more intricate fruit and chocolate flavors continue to emerge at the expense of the hops (not a big fan of psycho-hopped RIS's). Anyway, get yourself a bottle and sip it on down--this one's a great."
"I'm going to try cellaring four bottles, but it'll be awfully tough waiting to taste them. ;)"
"Overall: Great beer!!!"
"thanks, ghscash, for bringing this one back from EL this weekend. It survived the plane trip well."
"D - I love this stuff. It's just not very drinkable after one or two..."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good drinkability even with the stronger presence of alcohol."
"this beer pours out blacker than used engine oil with a thick perfectly even creamy brown head. that's right brown. quite a pretty stout especially for one of the russian imperial variety which is exactly what it smells like with a chocolatey roasty nose that is out of this world. the taste is also wonderful, full of all the burnt to a crisp malt that the nose promised and even a bit of the hops that were largely hidden in the nose. the mouthfeel is lovely, the thick velvety richness makes it a great stout and plenty palatable for an imperial."
"This one's for you, Zachary!"
"This beer gets better with age, the older the better was my experience with these, cannot believe how thick the body still was thirteen years later, thanks to hoppymeal for that really old bottle, you are the man Derek, still have a few fresh ones in my closet, I will try to age them as long as possible now, looking forward to drinking again, certainly recommended"
"Damn this thing wins the 'black of the black' award, no light penetration. The head on this thing is frickin enormous, real sticky and brown, the thing looks like a sponge soaked in coffee atop the brew. Sweet burnt malts in the nose, its an all out marshmallow roasting campfire in a glass. Sweet toasty grain, and lots of it, come through initially, definitely some quality malt used here. A bit of boozy heat while tasting but its warming, rather than unpleasant, very nice. Coffee and cream come through as well as the usual suspects of chocolate, molasses and brown sugar notes. This is a big beer, packed with flavor, but god damn what a drinkable body, perfectly creamy, slightly coating and leaves a long sweet malty finish. Yea, i recommend it. I recommend Bells should come into NJ and wreak havoc upon my wallet!!"
"A: Not an smidgeon of light passes through, brown head rings the glass, a brief swirl of the glass quickly raises the foamy head - 4.5, S: Espresso and chocolate malt, possibly some vanilla, something burnt - 4.0, T: Like eating a meal, chocolate & coffee, wonderful hop bite typical of a Russian Imperial Stout, extreme beer - 5.0, M: Extremely heavy, serious viscosity - 5.0, D: An exceptional beer, one of my favorite styles and hands down one of the best examples - 5.0"
"I've had this beer fresh, with one year of age on it, and now with two years of age on it, and this bottles was the two year old version and was by far the best I've had."
"D_I have had this on tap before as a clandestine offering in a NYC beer bar but was slightly buzzed when it happened. This bottled version is simply outstanding. Warming and perfect for a cool fall evening."
"I liked it overall but this maybe my last six pack. Just didn't compare to some other Imperial Stouts I've had."
"Pours black with a burnt sugar caramel colored head. Smells raisin and plum mixed with alcohol. Taste is bitter chocolate, burnt sugar,alcohol and cofee, hints of raisin also apparent. The alcohol in this imp undoubtedly wishes to make its presence noted. A fine Imperial stout and a new top 10 for me."
"D- Easy to drink, nice and smooth with great complexity."
"Bottle / Artwork - Understated in the Bell's tradition... Marbled label with feminine compass / key symbol..."
"Mouthfeel is uber thick and creamy. Would have liked to have aged this a while, but phuket...didnt feel like packing it in my luggage. Tastes like alcohol, dark berries, raisins, hay and espresso. This is a big beer and it lets you know it. The high hop content would allow for some good aging and let all the flavors melt together. I could see this being an A+ with a year or so under it's belt."
"overall this is a solid beer. nice and thick. good flavors , nice follow through. definitely worth a try."
"Taste is a bit too licorice for me. The alcohol is here, and the aftertaste leaves a bit of a sharp alcohol taste that fights with the anise to leave something a bit too sticky and sharp for me to want another. BUT, this is a great single-sipper. Make sure you sip it warmed up a bit."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a nice black color with a creamy brown head, good lacing. Aroma is mainly chocolate, a little coffee, and some spicy hop notes. Flavor is chocolate and ends somewhat bitter. Hides the alcohol and warms very, very well. Great beer!"
"This is an awesome beer, and its not hard to tell why its so well-regarded. The flavour is rich and luxurious, and all the peripherals are capably done. A fest for all the senses!"
"edit: it grew on me as the beer warmed. maybe i just had it too cold? regardless, i need to give this one another chance."
"Drinkability - Despite a lot of high notes to this beer, it isn't as drinkable as you might expect. After about a half of one you're left feeling somewhat tired of it. The alcohol bite tends to wear on you, and though the mouthfeel is impressive, it tends to get tiresome as well. This beer might be better packaged in 6 oz bottles...like a fine scotch it's better dosed in small quantities."
"Velvety smooth in the mouth, with noticeable alcohol, roasted malt. Veru full-bodied and somewhat smoky with some possible anise. Finished fairly smooth for a RIS...perhaps 2 years in the cellar is the culprit."
"Nice aroma of chocolate malt and coffee. Color is almost black with a nice amber brown head. A flavor explosion of sweet malt, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, coffee, balanced nicely with a good deal of bitterness. Heavy mouthfeel and strong although the alcohol is masked well."
"Finally decided to give this one a try. Bells brewery really knows how to get it done. The pour here is heavy and thick, pitch black color and topped with a thick tan head. The head does settle down to a thin layer. The aroma is chocolate with molasses, some coffee, roasted malts and a faint alcoholic presence. The flavor starts creamy and nice and smooth with chocolate, roasted malts and molasses. It finishes quite bitter and dry, that of fresh black coffee. A light bitterness settles on the palate. The beer is quite complex, high in alcohol, but not hard to drink, even if you are not a big stout fan such as myself. Definitely a sipper and something that could be a terrific after dinner drink."
"This stout is simply fantastic. The aroma and flavor profile are off the charts, rich, complex, delicious. Age will make this even more awesome."
"Overall an excellent beer, I would drink again and again. Definitely one of the top stouts on my list!"
"Overall, this rivals the Abyss for most flavor and body for a RIS. One of the most richest brews I have ever had!"
"Terrific, well done Bell's."
"The consistency is almost like a milkshake. Smooth and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. High alcohol hinders the drinkability a bit, but the flavors are on point."
"I get this for $15.99 a sixer when I go out to Indiana. Very delicious Russian Imperial style stout. Very thick in consistency and very sweet. Definitely a good ""dessert beer"" with a nice abv of 10.5%. Sweet chocolate invades your mouth at first sip, followed by a long lingering chocolate/cocoa taste thats a tad bit bitter. Defintely one of my favorite stouts. Hope the brothers on beer advocate try it again. Sounds like they got a bad batch. I love this beer."
"D- I will admit that I am partial to this style. While this style in general is not my session, I feel like I could have a couple of these in one sitting. I have only received these in trades."
"This one doesn't pass the looks test, but it certainly passes the taste test. If I have to pick a category for a beer to fail, that would be it."
"D- Absolutely must be sipped upon"
"HV"
"Holy cow this is good."
"Maybe this bottle brew needs to sit a bit, maybe not. This is a very interesting beer. I think a little less syrup and more cream, this could be perfect as the flavor is top notch."
"Could drink one or two."
"I wanted to age the 2nd bottle but I'm just going to chug it seeing as I have a bad batch on hand."
"Pours pitch black with a glorious fluffy brown head, fades very slowly and leaves lots of lacing in its wake. Smell is coffee, dark chocolate, some dark fruit and spicy alcohol. Taste is much heavier on the fruit element, plenty of raisin and plum, lots of roasted coffee, and some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is great on this, low carbonation, slight chewiness, excellent lingering flavors. This is a damn fine Imperial Stout. Me likey."
"D: Drinkability is OK for the style though I couldn't see myself drinking more than one in a sitting. This is a very good RIS but probably not in the top few I have tasted."
"Fantastic RIS and definitely a sipper. This would be excellent at cellar temperature and a good candidate for aging."
"Wow, a very dark and complex brew. A good beer for a colder month in lieu of a big winter dinner. Great stuff."
"Notes: I always steered clear of this Bell's offering due to reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a more-than-enjoyable brew. It's a well-crafted brew, and not just because I'm a homeboy. I don't care what state this was made, it's a tasty, fantastic brew."
"The beer pours the color of dark chocolate with a creamy tan head that holds a nice ring leaving lace down the side of the glass. The smell is full of roasted barley and chocolate. The taste displays the same flavors as the smell along with a good amount of hops. The mouthfeel is full bodied with some carbonation. It could be a bit smoother, but it is still good. Overall a great RIS, but I would prefer a more muted hop presence."
"Growing up in Kalamazoo, Bell's has always been a favorite of mine. Expedition has always been slightly feared, too big, too much like motor oil. It is a big beer which does require a more experienced palate. First time I have had this brew in years, absolutely fantastic."
"D - Not bad, had some great aspects, but did not live up to the hype. Had some leaking from the bottle cap so I don't know if I had a good bottle. Would try again, but will probably not work too hard to acquire one."
" V V"
"So lets get this baby started. I pop open the bottle, and the cap strikes the counter with a wonderful ting. Thick, way past 3,000 miles, motor oil black pour with a small brown head that disipates quickly. I can smell the thick malt aroma from across the room. Molasses, a floral hop texture, and a rich chocolate scent rounds out the aroma. The taste warms through and through with a thick malt note, big in your face hops, fresh Columbian coffee undertones, molasses, and slightly tasting of caramel. Palate is bitter and stinging from the big alcohol content. Only problem with this on is the overdone alcohol burn at the end. Excellent Imperial Stout. Buy, trade, but try not to steal to get this brew."
"Dark brown head that fully diminishes. Color is black. Aroma - big strong coffee, dark chocolate and roasted/toasted. A hint of smoke, as well. This is one of the fullest bodied beers I've ever had. Really outstanding - got better an it warned to room temperature."
"Flavor was same as aroma but with some licorice, rich and creamy texture with very little carbonation. Alcohol was pretty evident so drinkability was not so easy."
"*Note* It is imperative to serve this brew at cellar temperature, else it is a flat, sticky mess not worth drinking. A three letter-grade difference. No joke. Be warned!"
"Drink em' if ya got em'..."
"Drinkablility- A decent stout but not too enjoyable."
"I understand why people like Expedition Sout. It is big, flavorful and bold. I think, however, that all of those words are nice ways to call this beer a ""boozy mess"""
"D) A good sipper, but one is definitely enough."
"Poured from bottle into a sam perfect pint. Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head. Smells of alcohol then mellowed with chocolate and some coffee. Flavor is full!! Tons of chocolate, toffee and alcohol. Very nice creamy, slick mouthfeel- perfect for an ris. Definitely a sipping beer- this one packs a punch. Very complex, I get many different flavors and aromas working perfectly together. Right up there with some of my faves for this style."
"D: This is an RIS that lets you know the alcohol is there. Not bad, but definitely a sipper and really no need to hit more than one. Very nice brew."
"This is a very hefty big stout with a big ABV 10.5%. the drink ability is good, but can't have more then two in one sitting. Would definitely recommend trying."
"D- this is a beer that is very good to drink but you cant put too many of these down. I struggles with it at first but it did get easier. If you dont like burnt caramel or roasted coffee this isnt a beer for you. This beer is very had for meto put down...too much burnt coffee caramel flavor. IT reminds me of eating the coffee out of the filter."
"This has all the exact opposite flavors of what my brain tells me is tasty. Hey, looks like lots of people like it. I sure didn't."
"Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers."
"Drinkability - Not the best, finishes dry, malty and dark roasted. A very heavy stout."
"D - Hard to see myself drinking this all night. This tastes like a nail in the coffin, go to sleep. Still a very good beer even if its on the higher side."
"M/D - Very thick, creamy, and smooth. A very sippable RIS. Excellent beer."
"12 oz bottle into a goblet. Motor oil color with tan head that disappeared quickly. Bitter malty chocolate smell, very rich. Very complex taste. Some cherry hidden in chocolate, bitter, coffee. Very viscous, thick mouthfeel that you can chew. A beer for the very discerning."
"D: No thank you. Not your typical from Bell's. Avoid"
"Strong initial hop aroma that fades quickly after pour into glass. Pours somewhat like motor oil with a moderate medium brown head. Head seems pretty strong and resistant to go away. Eventually subsides and leaves some decent lacing. Coffee and malt aromas most noticeable with slight hints of sweetness from fruit, raisins, and hops. Rather strong taste with thick mouthfeel. Strong sweetness to the taste. Not as drinkable as some other imperial stouts I've had, but still tasty."
"Poured pitch black, with a one finger creamy brown head that lasts forever. Complex aroma; coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, plum, and hops. Big malt flavor, complimented with coffee, smoke, hops, and some dried fruit. Full bodied. The beer is excellent, but I recall finding previous batches more flavorful and more enjoyable."
"D: Smooth and creamy texture is an interesting contrast to the aggressive coffee bittering, sort of a hard & soft complex. The ABV makes this a stiff drink, but it's enjoyable just the same."
"Pours and looks like a stout should with a dark tan head. Head took some time to dissapate. The mouthfeel are thick, robust, with some slight smokiness. The tastes are more subdued with balanced malts, there is a nice heaviness in the aftertaste. This beer was quite smooth and easy to drink - something I would definetely look forward to in the future."
"This is an expertly crafted beer with a great balance and an excellent flavor. Very drinkable, but this is a great sipper."
"I'm starting to wonder if imperial stouts are hard to brew wrong, all the one's i've had these last couple of months have been exeptional.... maybe I'm just enjoying this style more than I did before."
"Pours midnight black into the glass with only the slightest of dark brown hints. The equally dark brown head lays down very quickly leaving patchy lace around the glass. It did not smell as strong as I was expecting but it was a pleasant, subtle chocolate and sweet alcohol aroma. The taste is great, bitter chocolate and sweet malt at the same time. A dull bitter aftertaste hangs out on the back of the tongue begging for another sip. Mouthfeel is full and bursting with flavor. I get coffee, chocolate, rye bread even. Anything dark I can think of is contained in this beer. I love it and can't wait to drink the other 4 I have."
"D-I could sip on this one for quite a while, but the high alcohol content would really catch up with me."
"Syrupy and gooey blackness poured into a SA pint. A huge two fingers of dark brown foam that look more like the head of a rich Italian espresso. Outstanding retention and gorgeous lacing down the sides. Smells of rich espresso, vanilla bean, molasses, chocolate malt, alcohol is in the very back. There's a little smokiness going on here too. Immensely thick, creamy, and viscous mouthfeel. Sweet vanilla and brown sugar notes hit the tongue first before being consumed by huge flavorful and bitter coffee, cigar tobacco, oak, with a long and lingering (bittering) charred finish that stays in your cheeks. This is a clear definition of bittersweet. An alcoholic finish that is noticeable but not undesirable. This is an intense RIS and one of my favorites for sure. Will review more later with a little time on it to see how the intense bitterness and alcohol evolve. A brilliantly balanced beer nonetheless."
"a nice part of the bell's repertoire. i would gladly have another."
"drinkability is decent. this is a huge brew. the thickness of the mouthfeel and the richness of the flavors present make this one a sipping beer, not shy about filling up the stomach. regardless, this is a good RIS. cheers!"
"This was back in color with a brown head of fine bubbles. There were scents of molasses, chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit and a slight spicyness toward the end. In the mouth this was concentrated with lots of midpalate power and shows off mainly coffe & chocolate flavors with a hint of the alcohol. Very well balanced with the hops just poking out at the end. I look forward to trying this repeatedly as it ages."
"D - Reasonably drinkable considering how huge this beer is. The flavors are profoundly dark and quite complex, and the only flaw I can find is the mildly hot alcohol in the finish."
"Excellent brew! Not really well balanced but very tasty. Strong stout flavors that are not overpowered by the alcohol."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown/black with a reddish dark brown head. Aroma is somewhat sweet with roasted barley, dark fruits, molasses, choolate. Warming. Sweet, hoppy and full bodied. This beer is very well balanced. No one flavor dominates, they all compliment each other. Definately the most balanced stout that I have had thus far."
"D- Brilliant drinkability from something so intense in flavors & mouthfeel. Splitting a 12 oz bottle is enough for a lengthy sitting."
"D: For the ABV doesn't get much more drinkable than this. Too bad RIS season is coming to an end. I feel dirty wearing shorts while drinking this. Would definitely seek out again."
"A heavy dessert-like beer. Very nicely done."
"Poured a dark, dark, dark chocolate color with a thin white head. I picked up a case (gotta love PA state laws where you have to buy a case) around Christmas. I just got to reviewing this and I love it. There is a sweet smoky malty taste to the beer and the carbonation was spot on. I am confused as to why some people had such a negative review of this beer because it had no off or cardboard tastes to it. There was an alcohol aftertaste and it was thicker than your average stout, but in my opinion that is the appeal of this beer. Hopefully your experience is more in line with mine than the other reviewers."
"Pours a pitch black out of the bottle. The aroma immediately fills the air. It's VERY SWEET. The aroma is almost too sweet, which is the only drawback for this beer. Taste was very mellow and complex simultaneously. Roasted coffee and chocolate come out. A very sweet brew. Mouthfeel was smooth as silk. I don't know why the brothers hate this brew so much. I personally thought it was quite good."
"Pours almost black with a thick tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roast, and caramel. Extremely smooth but complex at the same time. Initial taste of chocolate, caramel flows into a coffee bitterness with some warming alcohol at the finish. Very smooth to begin with, but becomes smoother with each taste. An excellent beer. I can't wait to taste this one aged."
"One of the best beers out there, in any style. Who needs barrel-aging? Not Bell's Expedition Stout. This thing is just about perfect as is. A regular supply would make life that much sweeter. If you don't like them big, sweet, lovingly-brewed and freakin' delicious, then 1) this is not for you, and 2) what's your problem? Live a little."
"D: This is an enjoyable RIS with decent balance and excellent richness. It is too heavy and has too high an ABV to be a session brew but it is an excellent beer for a cold winter night."
"Bottle code of 7740 indicating a bottling date of Dec 19, 2006. Pours a really thick black color. Found the smell and flavor to be somewhat paralleled with the Kalamazoo stout, although kicked up a couple notches of course. More of a sour dark malty character to this, or what seems kinda like soy to me. I didn't like it all that much. The roastiness just wasn't that big."
"This beer poured black with a very thin dark brown head on it with little retention and it looked really thick. It seemed to ooze out of the tap. The smell was good molasses, raisins and dates very sweet smelling. The smell was much better than the taste, it was slightly sweet in the beginning and finished very bitter. There was not much alcohol flavor for being 10.5%. It also had very little carbonation. Over it was ok because I am a fan of stouts."
"I'm a big fan of Bells, but could do without this concoction of hopped up prune juice."
"This is a big beer. It started slow, butted it pulled through in then end. Drizzled over vanilla ice cream is amazing,"
"O: on occasion this monster may suffer a bit from its own success... its bold and assertive and I can only drink it when I am really craving a stout. But when I do, there are few comparables out there."
"Not bad but much too sweet for my tastes. The lack of carbonation also took me by surprise and made me feel this was more of a cold coffee drink than a beer. It's too bloody sweet in my opinion. Overall I'd not turn this down if offered but I can't say I would buy it if available."
"Pours jet black with mocha colored head. Somewhat thin head however there is pretty good retention and heavy lacing. Smell is of toasted grain, chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and raisin. Taste is great. Heavy coffee flavors and an overall ""burnt"" taste to it. Dark chocolate and dark fruit as well, really dont detect too many hops. Mouthfeel is thick as hell. Thickest beer I've ever drank. Very low carbonation and a slick, oily feeling left behind. One thing to note is the alcohol is well hidden, could barely tell this was 10.5%. Overall a great beer, hard to drink in a session but enjoy one or two and sit back and relax."
"Pours a solid black that lets no light through. Tanish head that dissipates quickly, but leaves lots of marks down the surface of the glass. Aroma is wine like, with roasted malts, licorice, some chocolate and coffee too. Taste is sweet. I pick up some dried fruit, molasses, some roast and some faint hop or roast bitterness in the end. Mouthfeel is thick, and a bit sweet. Almost leaves my lips sticky like my kids with candy. Not your average Imp Stout, but I love this stuff. Bells continues to impress me!!"
"and a hint of madeira in the nose. Taste was very complex with a medley of flavors coming through. Espresso, dark chocolate, licorice and port wine were just a few of the flavors in each taste. Alcohol was barely evident, making this stout highly drinkable. Mouthfeel was quite rich and full bodied. This is not a beer for folks who favor light or less assertive styles. Next year, I'm buying a case of this stuff."
"Another outstanding stout from Bell's. This time an imperial, it poured opaque black with good brown head. It smelled like molasses and dark chocolate with some roasted coffee. It tasted strongly like very bitter/dark chocolate with a roasted flavor, mixed with natural/wood cask notes and a bit of alcohol taste. It was very thick but not too sticky, with a strong but mostly sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful stout, but not too strong to drink more than one. Very enjoyable, reminiscent of the Old Rasputin with slightly different flavoring."
"D - One of the best American Imperial Stouts I have tasted in a bottle. Just about flawless w/ a balance of hops and so much malt flavor you can't go wrong here. Even the boozy taste is within optimal range for my taste (6 months cellared) I prefer the bottled version, but I will update this when I can w/ the draft version. I can honestly say this deserves all the accolades this big stout receives."
"Mouthfeel is medium to thick and the drinkability isn't too high on this one for me due to the overwhelming sweetness for the style."
"D - An awesome Russian Stout. Very good, and an best of style."
"Big oily black pour, big brown lasting head in a snifter. Smell is figgy, banana notes, lots of dark roastiness and dry dry chocolate. Taste is dry dark roasty malt on the bitter side with figgy character. Some molassesy sweetness perhaps. Some alcohol showing a bit too in the flavor. Slightly sweet, but more rich, heavy chalky and slightly bitter malt. Big heavy rich mouthfeel and light carbonation. Nice, big, big stout. Thanks Greg!"
"this is a monstrous stout. monstrously good, that is--almost selling me on the $12.99/6 pk price. almost. pours dark, dark, dark, with a thin amber head. wonderful fruity nose, and once it gets on the palate it just keeps going and going and going. plum, chocolate, leather, blackberries. wonderful mouthfeel, and at 10.5% alcohol, dangerously drinkable. get some tonight."
"The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied. The drinkability is high for a Russian Imperial Stout."
"Great beer. I'm going to try to convince my wife to hold off on trying stouts until the six-pack has been relegated to a fond memory."
"Drink: Nice, buy the alcohol impedes on any real continuous drinking, but for a sipping stout, it's drinkable."
"I'm not even sure the masochist in me will reach for this again but the sadist may certainly help it into a house guest's glass."
"Bell's Expedition Stout pours an opaque dark brown with a very minimal tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma smells like malted milk balls to me. The body is thick and smooth. The flavor is quite intense, this is definitely a sipper, coffee and bitter chocolate and a few other things that I can't really put my finger on. The alcohol is always present too, but never really seems to overpower things. Excellent beer."
"Overall: Malt-heads will love it. An excellent beer, but a little too sweet for me."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. The taste nice be a little sweet but it has a nice coffee finish to kill any sweetness left over at that point."
"The stout poured nice into a pint glass with less head than I had expected from my experience with other Bell's stouts. The nose was rich with sweet and roasted flavors. The texture was thicker than I had expected but the flavors were well-balanced with roasted coffee, chocolate, toffee, and even a hint of hazelnut. This is undoubtebly one of the best stouts available."
"D: Not real sure if you would want more than one of these at a time. Its a beer to savor - a sipper for sure. I would definitely suggest just holding it in the cellar for a few months. I improves considerably."
"Overall, a mediocre imperial stout."
"Overall, a really tasty stout. It could use a little more carbonation which should help the aroma pop a little more. I like how the alcohol is very subdued and the overall balance of sweet and bitter is spot on."
"I could drink more of this than I probably should - it's heavy, but quite drinkable. Again, one of the best beers in any style if not the best I've ever had. Awesome."
"A - 3.5, S - 2.0, T - 3.5, M - 4.0, D - 2.5"
"D: Great brew but this is should definitely be used as a night cap."
"Roasted malt dominates, caving to flavors of espresso, chocolate, carmel and tobacco. The burn of alcohol is ever-present. This is a hot beverage, which keeps pulling me back for more."
"D - Drinkability is high. I would highly rocommend this beer to anyone looking for a big bold stout."
"D - overall a decent stout but just think that the raw hoppiness of it makes it a bit too out of balance to really appreciate its finer points. After awhile it seems to be all you can taste. have to say this is also a nice beer to drink on a cold winter's night for the simple fact that the alcohol in it really does warm up your whole body and yet it does not stand out in the flavor such that this beer is undrinkable or overly boozy. Would like to try one after it has aged some to see if the raw hoppiness fades away some and makes this even creamier and smoother."
"Mouthfeel - Incredibly rich and creamy; easily one of the most full-bodied brews I've had. Medium to low carbonation."
"Drinkability: This is tasty and uniquely sweet next to most of the roasty, bitter RIS around. It's a taxing beverage, but a very enjoyable experience."
"I'd like to try and find a couple more of these, age them for awhile and see if that improves the drinkability."
"Overall: Very good offering from Bell's. A classic example of a very solid RIS. If I could find it locally, it would be a staple six pack in my fridge."
"Drinkability: I'd had a few other 9-10% beers before this one last night, which I wouldn't recommend. It might as well have been laced with Lunesta after those. NOT a session beer. Sip slowly, as it should be savored. I feel bad for those who didn't come to love this stout. As a lover of imperials, this is the most complex and tasty imperial I've ever had. I could drink this all da...er, several times a week. Yeah."
"d - I don't know if my palate just isn't ready for this or not, but it's way too much. The only thing I enjoyed about this beer was smelling it. The alcohol and bitterness just doesn't sit well. There wasn't anything interesting up front either. I was hoping for some good stout flavors after smelling it, but :("
"D- I choked this one down. I could see how other people would think this one is good because of its complexity but I just could not get myself to like it."
"Overall drinkability is in question. Certainly a very tasty beer that should be on every big beer lovers list to try. Bitterness and thickness of body leave my mouth and tongue a bit worn, but not necessarily a negative. Might do well with some age to mellow the finish. High abv and full character knock it down for overall, but I'd drink this regularly on a cold winter day."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's relatively thick, but very smooth and creamy. Carbonation is on the light side, but perfect for this beer. It is strong at 10.5%, but it's very drinkable. I'll limit myself solely because of its strength, but that's the only reason. This is an excellent offering from Bell's."
"7/26/10: Well, let's check on this one again...cellared for about 2 1/2 yrs. The appearance is actually nice. Thick black-brown with super dark brown head. Looks like you could chew on it (4). Dark chocolate, molasses, and piney hops. Decent (3.5). Dark chocolate syrup, blackstrap molasses, and piney hops. Follows aroma pretty much on cue (3.5). Thick, smooth, oily. Faint alcohol burn and hop bite. I like it (4). OK, so I was wrong. This one does age well, but starts off terrible. It ends up as an ok RIS, but you gotta be patient (3.5)."
"Appearance is basically black, like motor oil. Pretty thick, but not sludge-like. Smells of coffee, malt, chocolate, and tastes of all of the above plus some burnt nuts and molasses and other stuff. A very nice blend of flavors. Where it goes wrong is the lack of carbonation. While I don't have as much of a problem with it as the Bros do, it's a definite minus. It was just a bit too flat. If there had been some more fizz, this would have been absolutely first rate. As it was, it was still a pretty darn good beer."
"Served in a nonic. Pour was black as night. Half-inch coffee colored head quickly dissipated into a quarter-inch layer of foam that maintained decent cohesion. Consistent, sticky lacing coated the sides of the glass throughout the tasting. Strong scents of malt, coffee and alcohol. Taste similar to nose, but also extremely sugary sweet (maybe molasses); burnt taste lingers at the finish. Somewhat of a syrupy mouthfeel with a hint of carbonation. Not bad, but drinkability is somewhat compromised by the thick mouthfeel, pronounced flavor of alcohol and bitter finish that lingers in the mouth. What's weird is that I typically enjoy many of these features in an RIS, but the combination just didn't come together for me."
"Drinkability is very good. At 10.5 abv, I'm sure blithering idiocy awaits after a few. Would be worth it!!!"
"A classic version of the style. This one was fresh, save some for the cellar."
"Overall Impression: Clean, simple, tasty. Heavy body, full but not over the top taste, definitely worth some praise. A must try for stout lovers."
"Nonetheless, it's quite good, but a big, brawny brew. I felt the very high ABV (10.5%) was hidden fairly well. But the texture ensures sipping this rather than quaffing. All told, that might not be so bad. Grab it but, unless you can afford it, try grabbing a couple and spending the rest of the scratch on a few others. The price is as big as the beer."
"Drinkability: A very fine stout both fresh and cellared. To wit, I had an '02 this past weekend that had morphed into a slightly roasty chocolate liqueur."
"Hooooray russian imperial stout!"
"One quasi-negative thing --- I don't detect the wine-like qualities which I normally associate with a fine, well-aged English barleywine or imperial stout. I might opt for a more English version next time. Or maybe I should have aged it a little longer! Oh well --- the six pack is now gone."
" This is really everything I could ask for from this style. totally rightous stuff...a true sipper, enjoy slowly. Have stout, will travel!!"
"previous scores 4.5, 4.5, 4, 5, 4"
"Not my favorite of this style. The hop bitterness does not balance well with the rich malts and coffee. It's a clash, like an unhappy marriage. Why can't they get along? This beer is also not as complex as others in this style."
"I don't know I think I had this bottle to early will have to revisit this one was bottled Nov 07 I've being drinking a lot of stouts lately and this is not one of the tops but not on the bottom either"
"Bottle marked '8145'. Special thanks to ilovedarkbeer (of ratebeer) for this one. Aroma is very nice with pine hops, chocolate, and Raspberry. Pour yields a dark black body with a very dark creamy head. Good lacing. Sweet and bitter balanced flavor. The coffee and chocolate are hidden by hops. Creamy texture with nice lively carbonation."
"This baby is tasty as hell and is so rich it's practically a meal. Awesome brew. Thanks Kevin!"
"D. No. This is pretty solid, but too thick and intense for more than a single bottle. Even then I'd recommend 6 ounces as an optimal pour. This is good, not great, but IS better as it ages. Try if you can."
"I've read some of the earlier reviews of this beer and I have to give credit to Bell's. If the old batches were poor they definitely got their act together for this one. The 2007-08 batch is world class."
"3"
"Drinkability is poor, i have heard a lot of good things about this beer and would love to give it another shot, perhaps on draft, just in case this was a bad bottle. if this taste is indeed representative, there is just too much sourness and bitter burnt malts to warrant a return visit"
"It was too bitter and ""over-roasted"" for me. Not enough balance in flavors to be very drinkable. Needs cellar time, perhaps, to allow all the flavors to combine more."
"D. Pretty high at 10.5%, but otherwise a great beer to quaff."
"This beer poured a thick oily black with a brown head  some lacing that fades quickly. The smell is sweet, malty and roasted with a hint of licorice. The taste is roasted and malty with chocolate, spice, coffee and fruit flavors present. The mouthfeel is chewy and there is a warming effect from the alcohol which is perfect for this beer. This is a big beer with robust flavors. It definitely hits the spot on this cold winter night."
"Drinkability is hampered by the syrupiness and hefty alcohol level but it's just so damn smooth and tasty! Great beer."
"D-I'm only 2/3 done, and I'm starting to get full. Despite a couple shortcomings, I enjoyed seeking out this bold brew's veiled subtleties, but as a big Bell's fan since my irresponsible Bronco days, I'm left somewhat disappointed. Bell's has plenty of other varieties I would rather spend $ on."
"This isn't bad. Isn't good. It will not be hard to finish, but not one I will look for again."
"I'm just not seeing this one as A or A+ material...it seems this one is either really good or really bad. Maybe Bell's needs stay a little more consistent."
"D- Good drinkability, little bit of bite adds to the experience. One I'll have to have again."
"D- I'd have one once a week if I could."
"D: delicious, strong and reasonably priced...what else could you ask for. Get it if you can."
"From a freshly opened keg. The beer poured black with an incredibly creamy light brown head. The aroma had lots of burnt smells (coffee, chocolate) and was accompanied by a little bit of fruit sweetness. The flavor had lots of chocolate, coffe and some alcohol. The body was very full and the the aftertaste lingered with a pleasing bitterness."
"I would gladly try this once more on tap - I love most everything else I've tried from Bell's, so I owe Expedition at least that - but I won't be picking up any bottles again."
"D & Notes: I feel this is a reasonably example of a stout. A decent balance topped with flavour. A rather nice body, something I would feel would be nice cellared for a special occasion - but there seems to be some dispute to that, so that might not be the best idea out there."
"I think Jason and Todd got an out of date sample of this beer because it really is great. Bell's is a great brewery (you know that) and this is a great beer."
"D- This is a good drinker. Deep and bold beer with lots of malts and fruity notes. This is a much better beer on tap than in a bottle. A decent beer overall though"
"D: Ok, I'm being redundant, I only bump up the drinkability for the 10.5% alcohol being well hidden, otherwise it was very difficult for me to finish this bottle as I just didn't enjoy and would rather just have Kalamazoo, Double Cream, Java or basically any of their other stouts (for much cheaper). I'll update this review in future when I try again."
"D- Dangerously drinkable. This beer is incredible with some time to mellow and blend. This is how American style Russian Imperial Stouts should be."
"Just drinkable at best. Not worth the money."
"The malt and alcohol dominate the taste. It is not well balanced. A little of the flavor complexity that other reviewers noticed is there but very faint in my sample. It finishes bitter with the alcohol combining making it difficult to finish. The body is thick and creamy but maybe has a bit too much carbonation. This beer seems a bit ""raw"" and would benefit from some aging. I will stow a few bottles away to sample years from now."
"A rather excellent brew although the sweetness makes it difficult to enjoy more than one at a time, but it certainly is a treat. Might be good to cellar one for 5 years and see if it mellows out."
"Full bodied, creamy and smooth... Excellent."
"Wow!!! Excellent RIS, one of the best I have had so far. Very complex. There is so much going on with this one. I'll definetly have to try this again to fully appreciate it."
"M/D: Carbonation is high, too high, but does lend in small part a creamy texture. Body is extremely full, a little slick, sticks to the lips a little, no hints of the alcohol, nice. Drinkability is lowered due to 10.50% and just how aggresive this beer is. A sipper for sure. Can't wait to sample some of this batch a few years from now."
"D:The sweetness of this beer is a bit to much for me, could stand to be cellared for awhile. Was not bad, just had better."
"Very easy to drink. Not a lot of complexity for the style, but not hard to drink at all."
"Pours jet black, with a tan/ light brown head. In the aroma, a roasty malt and grapefruity hops. In the taste, hoppy, coffee, and a sweet roasty malt. A small bitter, big body mouthfeel and a sweet roasty malt and a small grapefruity hop aftertaste. Big malt, nice hops, hides alcohol and quite easy to drink."
"To be honest, not the most drinkable stout, but oz. for oz. one of my favorites."
"Pours out like used motor oil. <goosebumps> Massive fluffy dark tan head that clinges to the glass as it travels down the glass. Smells of deep dark chocolate followed by a good does of bitter hops for balance. Feels super silky in the mouth, like a melted chocolate bar, wow! Starts out chocolatey that turns into deep roasted malt flavors which then magically transition to a nice hop bitterness. A slight smokiness to it mixed in there too. Aftertaste is slightly boozey. I want to drink this beer till my ears bleed."
"Pours jet black with a thin brown head. The nose is of chocolate cake and java beans. Incredibly tasty with lots of dark malt. Coffee bean and dark chocolate come to mind. Big big flavor with great hop bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy as hell and rides slick down the throat. Hop and coffee bean flavors dominate the finish and there is a strong alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Very warming and quite drinkable for 10%. This is a great offering from Bells. i would love some of their double cream. This expedition will have a nice home in my cellar for a few years."
"This one is really good. And ranks up close to Old Rasputin and Blackout Stout for me. I hear this one ages well, but I may have trouble waiting on the other five."
"Pours pitch black with a large dark tan head. Nose is dusty with strong molasses tones. Flavor is oh so smooth. Strong molasses flavors prevail, but stay perfectly balanced. Feel is thick in the liquid and thin on the carbonation. This is a beautiful stout that is a hard one to surpass. Amazingly crafted and worth seeking out...at all costs."
"Overall- A great example in my opinion. It had robust flavor and was easily sippable."
"D - A very strong beer for how little you can taste the alcohol. One of the better RIS I have tasted."
"The sweetness wore out my palate toward the end, but still a great beer. Would definitely buy again."
"Popped open the top,, took the first sniff, and knew this one was going to be good. The beer pours a very thick black, with a thin dark brown head. The smell was of roasted malt, coffee, molassas, rum, etc. Early on, there was some strong alcohol, but the beer smoothed out with some warming. There was a bit of carbonation, and I thought it was well balanced. Overall, I was very satisfied with this beer. I will gladly invest in a few more bottles."
"Overall I recommend this beer, but there are others I like more."
"A good beer, but not great enough to be a regular buy for me. The pour is lovely, scent is tasty, color is great, and so on. Bell's quality, upfront as always. Taste was good overall, but too hop-forward for my liking. Raw alcohol was fairly prominent throughout. I'll stick with Kalamazoo Stout and Java Stout."
"I have a few more bottle of this and I'm glad because this stuff is delicious."
"D = Pretty good for an occasional beer, but I find this is too strong (both in taste and alcohol) when fresh to have it too often. Does age well though."
"Overall, it's a great stout. Not as good as DarkLord, Darkness or perhaps even Storm King, but it should be mentioned in the same breath. Can't wait to finish off the other 11!"
"Jet black body with a thick, fluffy brown head. Very bubbly and diligent, leaving good lacing from top to bottom. The smell is of roasted nuts and malts with a fiery texture. Very strong roasted to burnt flavoring with a smoldering, almost smoky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and very chewy. A fantastic sipper from a great brewery. I can't wait to see how this ages."
"Definitely worth the try. Let down more as I drank more to be honest with this one."
"This is another great stout from Bell's, I look forward to trying this every winter."
"Most egregious, however, is the price at $15/6 pack. There are way better options for as low as $9-$11 in this category alone (especially Victory and Thirsty Dog). This is one Expedition I probably won't be making again."
"Ive been wanting to taste this beer for a very long time. Thanks to akorsak for the opportunity. Apparently this beer is a little over a year old, which I am sure is a good thing, as a beer like this tends to cellar well. Pours a jet black color, with a small tan lacing for a head. Definitely one of the blackest beers I have run in to. Aroma has deep notes of dark chocolate cake, port plum and molasses. Taste is nothing short of exquisite. It starts off very sweet and round, with much of the chocolate and alcohol coming through. It ends on a slightly more bitter roasted coffee note, but at the same time maintains that initial alcohol presence. Body of this one is thick and chewy. There are hops present, but are not overly detectable. There is a good dose of carbonation, however to balance out the big body of it. I could see myself drinking one more of these before moving on to something else for no other reason than that otherwise I might get knocked on my ass from the high alcohol. Damn, I wish this beer, and this brewery for that matter were available here in Mass (maybe one day). This one definitely falls within the top five biggest and baddest stouts I have sampled. Anyway, Im gonna stop typing, and finish my glass. Cheers"
"D - This is in my top 5 beers. I love this beer and could drink it all day every day."
"Overall, one of the best Imperial Stouts I have sampled. This one is a must try."
"The beer pours a jet black into my pint glass with a moderate dark tan head. The aroma is highly roasted; coffee like, moderately sweet and there is a little chocolate and alcohol aroma. The flavor is highly roasty, there is a strong bittersweet malt flavor as well and a bit of alcoholic bite. The carbonation is medium and body is very full. Overall this brew is well done, coming in over 10% ABV the alcohol bite is appropriate, not overly harsh. Definitely one to sip..one in a night."
"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Thick, thick, thick. Akin to motor oil. The opaquest of blacks. It actually made me do an experiment - I put a flashlight up to it to see if any light went through (it didn't). No head formed at all, though there are some streaks of froth. Smell was very faint, though not bad. The usual suspects for a stout are present: coffee, chocolate, with some woody character. Despite the weak aroma, this is a very flavorful beer. Very heavily malted. Notes of coffee, chocolate, burnt wood, and even a bit of soy sauce. Finds a decent balance between being bitter and sweet, though it leans toward bitter. This is one of the thickest beers I've had. Very heavy and smooth mouthfeel. This is one to drink slowly, which allows the flavors to come out more after it warms up a bit and also prevents the high alcohol content from getting the best of you. A great pick for the winter."
"D- Delicious, if the smell was stronger, and the taste just a tad more complex this would be a perfect 10 (or 5) in my book."
"Bottle. Poured a brownish-black color with a medium brown head. Nice lacing. Aroma is a nice roasted malt with a pleasant chocolate hint to it. Mouthfeel is about perfect. Flavor is rich with a chocolate and roasted malt taste. Aftertaste has a hint of coffee to it. A very special brew."
"This is currently on tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham, along with three other stouts by Bell's. (It's quite cute, actually, seeing those four distinctive tap handles all in a row.) Served in a Bell's tulip glass, I was struck by the black appearance of the beer, with that dark-tan, one-finger head. (The head looks like it could be its own food group!) It certainly looks like a Russian Imperial Stout, that's for sure. One whiff revealed aromas of sweet dark fruits and heavily roasted malts. A bit of coffee jumps out of the glass, and there's a little bittersweet chocolate lurking there as well. The flavor is quite sweet, with a sugary prune character leaping to the forefront. Balanced in the middle by roasted grains, the flavor mellows a bit and allows the darker, coffee-like characters to dominate. Here's where the alcohol is easily detected! The finish includes some hops to contrast with the malts, but it's really in the background to everything else going on. Wow! That's something else! The lower carbonation lets the smooth and creamy texture slurp around the palate, allowing all the flavor elements to intermingle in an ecstasy of brewing delight. This is a wonderful thing!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Great feel in the mouth. Very full bodied and creamy, perfect pairing for dessert, or drink this as a dessert. Also as mentioned before warms a bit as it goes down. They don't get better than this, feels perfect in the mouth. This beer is one I could drink all night, it is that good. This is one brew I'll always come back to, and I'll also be sure to recommend it to those I know who are stout lovers."
"Taste is very similar, thick and creamy mouthfeel, too. A damn fine stout. Drinkability is where this one falters a bit, that might be a bit of personal bias against these dark beers, but i can't take that high-alcohol, bitter roasted malt in too high of quantities."
"Pours jet black, with an enticing, creamy tan head. Looks great! Smells like a wonderful stout - roasted coffee, chocolate, and a touch of alcohol. Tastes great - again, dark chocolate, espresso, licorice and a healthy portion of citrusy hops, giving the sweet and creamy aspect a balancing tartness and nice finish. This is fantastic. One of the best stouts i've had in a while. The mouthfeel is thick, but with a good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, for such a heavy duty stout."
"I really hope I can get my hands on more of this."
"Still, this is an excellent Imperial stout, and one I'd seek out if it were available here in Colorado. I'd like to put this in a taste test with Yeti, Stone,and Storm King. If it had a little more carbonation, it would be exactly on par with them in my eyes."
"The mouthfeel is wonderfully thick and smooth. Tastes sweet and satisfying. Has a good hop bitterness, toasted malt, mocha, a bit of fruits and some alcohol."
"D: again, the bitterness is a little much, but it is very smooth, quite the sipper, just one prompts an immediate contemplation of the meaning of life"
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into my normal tasting Chalice. Appearance is black. It barely let any light through. It had a large, thick 2 inch head, that left no lacing down the sides of the glass. Smell is of molasses, bakers chocolate and espresso. Taste is mostly the same, but with hints of raisins. This stout is balanced better then any stout I've had to this point in by beer journey. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. I think I could drink a keg of this if my liver (and rest of my body) could handle it"
"D-This is a very smooth and relaxing beer.At 10.50% it makes a great sipping beer on a cold night.If you like big beers or RIS's you must try this one."
"thanks again, tavernjef."
"Drinkability- Abv is noticeable, but doesn't seem like the 11.5% Seems high though. Damn I wish I could get these out here. May have to do some mail order. Top notch stuff that competes with Stone, Alesmith and a few other ones IMO. Will be doing what I can to get more of these."
"I poured this thick beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was inky black and poured a tan head that was pretty nice. The taste was strong like a Russian stout and very stout indeed. The thick coffee taste blended well with the smokey chickory taste that oozed around in my mouth. I will buy this beer again. Bell's makes a fine product."
"I don't know why it's taken me so long to return to this beer. It is a winner!"
"Thanks to kryptic for the trade."
"This beer poured from bottle an espresso color with a large foamy tan head. Aromas of brazilian chocolate, espresso and earthy undertones. Bold flavors of coffee and dark, rich chocolate. Lots of alcohol on the finish but it was balanced by the chocolate and coffee flavors. Very drinkable for the high alcohol content. One of the finer examples of this style."
"It has a full body and texture that silks over the tounge. Very drinkable for a big RIS and one of the best around."
"Another great beer from Bell's. Their stouts are above verage to outstanding. This is one that leans toward outstanding. I reviewed this one while it was very fresh. Up next will be an ged example and this beer ages with the best of them."
"Hoppin' Frog B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher"
"Legendary stout, my first taste of it. Beautiful appearance, total pitch midnight in a glass topped with creamy mocha head, rocky with lacing to boot. Smell is good, but doesn't leap out like expected. Still, nice sublime chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is intense. Very bitter, but rich with coffee, chocolate, wood, and spice. As it warms, green pepper and green olive notes reveal themselves. Mouthfeel is amazing, hefty yet with a lift that elevates this to the exceptional. Drinkable, not easygoing, but you would certainly like another."
"Drinkability: Aggressive as hell, and in my opinion, not complex enough to warrant it. Not bad - try it if you like Stone's RIS - but not my favorite."
"This beer pours dark, real dark, small carmel brown lacing on top. The smell is the best part of this beer. The taste was not what I was expecting, it was really bitter and you can taste the alohol through the other hidden flavors. Mouthfeel was terrific, I love the thinkness of this beer. I found that this beer did not have me wanting to conitnue to drink it, I drank and did not want another. This beer was not as good as I thought it was going be."
"Overall an ale that I wasn't truly able to appreciate a couple years ago (this is my 2nd review). After sampling the bourbon barrel version at the Great Taste of the Midwest a couple years ago (poured by Larry Bell himself) and several stints with Kentucky Breakfast & original Breakfast Stout, Ive been tempered and educated enough to truly appreciate the masterpiece this stout truly is. This RIS is utmost decadent and supremely balanced, and with just enough understated attitude (kinda like Billy Jack) to kick your ass if you mishandle it. I'm humbled to think I gave this a poor rating just over two years ago. This is one of the finest HUGE ales I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Hail to Bell's - the original Michigan micro!"
"Thick and creamy on the palate with low carbonation and a somewhat syrupy texture. Again there is some nice warmth in the finish that rounds out this amazing beer. One of the best examples of a RIS I can think of. Such a great selection. If you ever have the opportunity to sample it on tap, take it."
"Pours a thick black sludge that drips out of the bottle. A nice foamy chocolate milk covered head rests on top of this one and leaves lacing all along the side of the glass and a thin layer rests on top. Smell is of chocolate cookie dough and it warms your nostrils as if they had just been taken out of the oven. The rich doughy sweetness is followed by a bitter coffee scent. Taste is bittering coffee, and a smokey aftertaste. Mouthfeeling is a little oily with a good amount of warming alcohol presence. Delicious beer."
"This is one exceptional stout. One reason to keep it out of the nonic is so you don't drink it too fast. Recommended."
"Hrmm, quite the disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pick up a 6'er of this. I'm gonna go drink my Stone RIS to wash this taste out of my mouth. This one is going down the drain."
"."
"One of the best beers i have ever had. At least in the stout category. I highly recommend this one to anyone. I dont care if they only like BMC or not. This one can turn heads 360degrees"
"Drinkability: I was quite afraid of Imperial Stouts before trying this beer. I had always thought it would taste more like bourbon than beer. This beer is not like that at all. It is similar to a nice dry stout, but there is much more complexity there. It is almost too easy to drink with an ABV like this. I think this has opened me up to the world of Imperial Stouts."
"Black as night! with a very minimal head that dissipated rather quickly! lacing is virtually none! The mouthfeel is extremely thick and creamy with heavy notes of bitter chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel,and figs with a nice lasting bitter finish,one of the best Stouts i have had the pleasure of tasting!"
"Probably one of the best Imperial Stouts I have had. I love that I can buy this in a sixer."
"I don't have the batch number in front of me, but this one was bottled only a month or so ago. Since I recently polished off a two year old bottle, I thought I should get another sixer to cellar. This bottle was so new, I expected to get a huge raw hop bitterness level and it did not disappoint. Even though it smells wonderful and has an awesome mouthfeel, it is not exactly drinkable quite yet. After a year or so of aging, I expect the IBU's to calm down and the complexity of the malt to develop. I'll update my review then..."
"Drinkability: Very good beer. Could see this being a staple this winter. The only hold-ups could be the thickness and the ABV. Both of which could eventually prove to be too much. Very good beer."
"A fantastic stout to be sure, and one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. However, the flavor falls a little short of my personal gold standard (Stone), so I'd have to rate this beer as slightly inferior. I believe that some aging would greatly improve this beer as it should mellow out the bitterness a bit. As it is, it's fantastic, but it could be better. Still highly recommended."
"darrrrk. nothing but blackness. no light will pass through this one. well done. thick head with amazing retention and big big lace. smells of chocolate, coffee, and roast. nose is not incredibly strong, but the taste is wonderful. full full body with hints of unsweetened chocolate, coffee, burnt toffee, caramel, and some hops. minimal bitterness/burn from the alcohol, roasted malt and hops. what a great beer!"
"Absolutely amazing! This is the best stout ever! Pours very dark if not black. Thick foamy tan head. Nose of chocolate and a little coffee. Thick and full bodied. Great aroma but an ever better taste. Creamy and thick on the palate. Dark chocolate and coffee in the flavor. Just a great beer."
"Final thoughts: The addition of Bell's to the Mid-Atlantic market has brought many treats over the last year. And while I do like the two hearted IPA, I can't say enough about their stouts. Kalamazoo stout is great, double cream stout is great, and this one, oh this one is right up there."
"Pours an oily blackish/brown with a pleasing mocha colored head, coffe and sweet on the nose, I taste coffee and perhaps a bit of unsweetened cocoa, heavy but not quite as heavy as you might think it should be (as far as I'm concerned it's perfect for the style), nice finish that hangs around for a while."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"Pretty tasty stuff, glad I traded for this one and will have to get more of this to age. 4.5"
"This is absolutely a solid beer, but is just not my cup of tea."
"So rich and thick that it doesn't go down as nicely as Stone's, or Smutty's (two of my favorites), but I love this beer, and I pick up a few every time I'm in the midwest. Even at 12 oz I like this best as a beer to share at the end of an evening, best with a little bit of chocolate."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. This is a thing of beauty. The aroma is great! It has a warm black, chocolate, and roasted malt scent. It's rich and creamy with a stiff non malted roasted barley aroma. The taste is great. It is rich with malt complexity. It starts out smooth and creamy with a chocolate malt taste. Then it quickly warms with a roasted malt feel and finishes with a bold black malt blast. This is a damn tastey beer. The mouthfeel is great. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the perfect RIS. It's bold and challenging with loads of flavor and malt complexity. It's warm and inviting. A damn fine beer!!"
"Great oily opaque black color with a nice tan head that hangs on for dear life, lacing never stops. Smell is awesome with a hint of sweet malty carmel, coffee and anise. taste is much like the aroma, maybe not quite as pronounced, but now you find the hops, hidden just below the malty flavors. in the mouth this beer feels like a smooth chewy stout like it should. Drinkability is a little lower only in regard to the fact that one of these is enough for me in a sitting, very sweet almost a dessert beer."
"Buttery mouthfeel. A combination of harsh flavors, big ABV, and sugary sweetness make this a challenge to put down."
"Drinkability- This is definitely a beer that should be sipped and slowly enjoyed. Its so complex and flavorful that Im almost at a loss for words. Wish I had more access to beers from Bells but so far the two that Ive had (Two Hearted) are tremendous. I enjoyed this beer thoroughly and cant thank tpd975 enough. Terrific beer!"
"This was very nice, one of my favorites of the style so far. Thanks orrshow for splitting the bottle."
"D- It is alright. I think it focuses to much on just the different burnt flavors for my liking. I can drink it but I doubt I will be searching for it again."
"D: A snifter is great, more than one and you'll be seein' double. This is a complex beer that is best enjoyed slowly with good company."
"Pours a dark opaque black color with some brown highlights when held to a light. Chocolate milk head that sticks and laces. Smells sweet, roasted coffee beans, chocolate, cocoa. Taste has a lot of delicious layers with everything the smell offers and more. Alcohol warms but is not present in the taste. Drinks like a dessert. A wonderful stout that is a must try for all stout lovers and beyond."
"glad i bought 2."
"Drinkability is very good for a stout with this level of flavor. The strong flavors and long finish should make this a slow sipper but this beer just disappears from the glass. If you find this beer, buy a lot."
"Overall, a good strong Imperial stout. Not my favorite, but I will see how aging affects it. Lots of alcohol warmth and strong bitter flavors. Hell of a punch on the palate. Very good over all, although a bit over the top, still after one year."
"I've had this beer several times before and always remember it as a really good beer. I always remember it standing up to up to big expectations. That's tough to do. This beer is about as good as it gets. I could see some reviewers hitting the sweet as too much, but I find the alcohol and hops are a counterpoint that makes this beer blanaced and complex. Phenomenal."
"Aquired this brew from brandoman63, in the brews-n-tunes summer '07 tour. About a year and a half aged. Served at cellar temperature, in a snifter, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a serious inky jet black color, that no light could pass through. About a half inch of somewhat thin, dark brown head formed. Head quickly dispersed into a thin ring atop the beer. Left little lace behind. Strong chocolate, bitter coffee, some almost oaky notes, followed by a ton of alcohol. Also noted were caramel, toffee, and some nice roasted aromas. The smell was almost mouth watering. Tons of flavor. More strong coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, roasted malts. All of this finished with a hot alcohol burn in the back of the throat. The alcohol seems much more pronounced than I can remember. Very little carbonation was noticed. Mouthfeel was thick, full, syrupy and chewey. Awesome. Drinkability was great for such a high octane tasting brew. Pretty smooth and enjoyable."
"Poured opaque with an off-white medium head with medium retention. Surprisingly light in the nose. Some coffee and roast with malt sweetness, but nose overall lighter than I thought it would be. Flavor exhibited a blend of roastiness, malt, with a hint of chocolate. Smooth, nice, but not as complex as many of the other R.I.S.'s that I've had before."
"One is perfect for me, thank you. :)"
"Pours a complete opaque motor oil black with a huge three finger brown head that takes forever to die down to a generous lacing. Stickiness is truly amazing. Probably the best looking RIS I've seen to date. Smell is a sweet caramel malt mixed with a nice dark chocolate and molasses that tingles the nose as well. A bit of alcohol is also present in the smell. Taste has a lot of coffee and espresso to it, much more than the smell leads on, especially the aftertaste. Starts off with a sweet chocolate malt followed by a whole bunch of roasted nut mixed with brown sugar. Some alcohol on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich with very little, but just enough, carbonation. I could only have one in a sitting, but I will definitely be drinking this one in the future. Bell's has just about mastered the art of brewing Stouts (Cherry Stout being an exception), and this one doesn't disappoint."
"A wonderful after dinner beer to savor and contemplate. This beer definitely passes the ""I am so sad the glass is finished"" test. The folks at Bell's have done it again...they continue to impress."
"Got from my brother-in-law in Indy. Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottling code on back label. It was a dark black color. It had about a finger of dark brown head that settled into a thin film. Slight lacing. The aroma was coffee, roasted malts and a big hint of the ABV. The taste was good but had a really bitter finish that kinda ruined it for me. It got better as it continued to warm but still too much. This is only the 2nd RIS I've had with Siberian Nights being the other. I loved the Siberian so not sure which is more representative of the style but hoping Siberian. I can see why this is highly regarded but it's just not for me. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"D- this is a highly drinkable beer that was extremely delicious, this was my only on hand so i'll be looking forward to getting more this winter"
"Definitely one to be savored. The 10.50 % ABV is showcased. Highly recommended."
"I almost feel as though I am being too critical. Bell's is quite possibly my favorite brewer. I have to revisit this one. Will update after my second go around with this one."
"12oz bottle; batch 7817. Poured pitch black, with a one finger creamy brown head that lasts forever. Complex aroma; coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, plum, and hops. Big malt flavor, complimented with coffee, smoke, hops, and some dried fruit. Full bodied. The beer is excelent, but I recall finding previous batches more flavorful and more enjoyable."
"D - Very malty Stout, but very good"
"D: My god, I would have no problem stocking an entire fridge with this stuff. This is one of the best stouts I've had for a couple reasons. For one, its balance of malt and hop flavor is incredible. Two, Bell's hits the mark with the mouthfeel of this stout, making it taste like a benchmark beer, something by which other stouts should be measured. So, in closing, this stuff is damn good, so try it."
"Drinkability - this is very good. Only high abv holds down sessionability."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass . Pours a deep black with a nice thick brown head that slightly lasts. Nice heavy lacing. Aromas of sweet malts with a good amount of hops and chocolate. Undertones of coffee and alcohol. Flavor is dry malts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and some wine. You can feel the alcohol warm your tounge when it hits your mouth. Very well balanced with all flavors weaving together and hiding the alcohol. Full bodied, but a bit more carbonation than I would prefer. Still, a superb imperial stout!"
"Overall Impression - What a great RIS. Smooth, balanced with lots of complexity."
"Its big and pretty good, but my bottle need more time. Theres too much alcohol flavor and the chocolate and coffee taste feel like theyre only just budding. Theres a nice addition of hops flavor under the malt, but the alcohol that follows leaves a bad feel."
"D - Overall I give this an awesome, very thick and heavy, not even close to being sessionable in any way. I really great RIS and would love to try some more."
"Overall Impressions: This is one of those beers that really is a thing unto itself. It may not be for the timid or for those unappreciative of the heavier and darker flavors this world has to offer, but as a nightcap it has few equals. I like how the weighty burnt roast flavors mingle with the super-smooth full-mouth creaminess. I like how the creaminess of the malt comes back on eructation. I like the slightly warming, though otherwise expertly hidden, 11.5% alcohol. Suffice to say: I lock this beer, I lock it a lot."
"A little hot at times, but weirdly pretty drinkable."
"Overall a bit sweet, but doesn't deviate too far from its stout roots. Very flavorful without being overpowering. I'm afraid to say I could drink more than one of these, which at 11.5% ABV might not be a good idea!"
"Taste is a complex beast, raisin and hops again balancing the chocolatey malts. Alcoholic flavor isn't afraid to rear its beautiful head. Body is thick and creamy and leaves a great bitter finish. This RIS comes on a bit too strong for my liking, despite the fact that is is very tasty. The ABV seems to override the palate and leaves it hurtin', but I'll definately have this one again."
"12 oz bottle received as an extra from Photekut. The color was solid midnight black with a dark brown head. The smell was doughy and heavy. The taste was doughy, syrupy, and roasty. Alcohol was not tasted but felt afterward. This was a very good RIS but I find that I am liking the style less and less. Solid beer but I didn't want more than one."
"Drinkability: It's pretty hefty. A sipper. A damn tasty sipper, but a sipper. Wouldn't have more than one at a time."
"Aggressive pour release a thick jet black liquid with a big, beautiful and creamy dark chocolate head. It really does look quite nice. Smell is coffe and alcohol, airline glue and milk chocolate. Astringent. The chocolate and roastiness combats the alcohol as well as couold be expected, but there is no hiding it. Almost no ""soy sauce"" taste that I associate with most RISs until it warms up a bit. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. The carbonation is all in the head. Well, I'm glad this came in a 12 oz. A 750 would be way too much. This is a heavy beer - a real sipper. The tastes and alcohol are both way aggressive. A bit much for me I'm afraid."
"M: thick thick thick, if you want a full bodied beer, this is it. its a good beer a little to much alcohol taste for me, but a good beer just the same"
"Tried this one after aging from a sixer for about a 10 months. Pours an exceptional dark black color with a deep orange-brown head that quickly dissolves down to a fine glaze of foam. Looks pretty solid, and the lacing stays with it as the beer drains, although I would have liked the head to stick around a little longer. Nose is extremely sweet: caramel, chocolate malt, and lots of dried fruit. Maybe pomegranate. Breadiness. A nice nose, although you really have to dig at it to get all the aromas out. Felt like I was just about dip my nose in the thing. Flavor is sweet as well. Dried fruit up front, all over the place. Roasted malt shows up in the middle a bit and wears on the tongue, adding some graininess and toning the whole thing down a bit. Alcohol shows up at the back end, although its fairly well hidden in the spicy hops. The hops makes a sort of bitter coffee malt taste. Breadiness as well. Body is low on carbonation (although it feels a bit fizzier as the beer goes on) and high on body - very thick and exceptionally creamy. Interesting to notice that the Bros do not feel this one due to the lack of carbonation. I guess in my mind that's not a problem, and adds to the creaminess of the beer - its almost Guinness-esque. Overall, after a year I expected the alcohol to be non-existent, but its still a fairly strong presence. I guess that sort of diminishes the score for me a little bit. Overall though, quite tasty, still."
"This goes down easier than an 11.5% beer should and leaves you wanting another."
"These are the stouts that myths are made of."
"Full body, nice soft, gentle carbonation, and a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a fantasic beer, made very interesting in cask form."
"On cask it looks as though I will be drunk soon very soon from multiple glasses."
"Drinkability is about what you'd expect from a Russian Imperial with 11.5%, which is to say not that much. I think two of these would be pushing it, but that's normal."
"Big time sipper... it's going to take me well over an hour to drain through this one. Will that change as the beer ages? Stay tuned...."
"Pours dark like a stout with a brown head. Not much head though, a little flat. Does leave thin lace behind. Strong roasted malt smell and a bit metallically. Nice strong flavor with bitter aftertaste. Good, but nothing special. Somewhat thick, low carbonation mouthfeel. Average stout. I was dying to try this after seeing some reviews and had a friend bring me a six pack from Michigan since I couldn't find it here in Florida. Was also excited when I poured the first glass (I love seeing a brown head, not white, on a stout) but was disappointed in the taste. Again, it's not bad, just average."
"Not to be missed."
"This hefty stout show's no sign of light thru it! A nice mocha color head with good head retention. The nose was dark roast coffee with licorice and burnt toast. The taste is very surprising, yeah this beer is black as night but the first sip has good carbonation the flavors of dark roasted malts and bitter chocolate with a licorice creamy mid palate. And for the grand finally a nice bite of hops say's hi just at the end. The alcohol level mixes well. Very smooth."
"Drinkability: This beer is nothing like the plain and simple label that's adorns the bottle. It's in fact the complete opposite. Is it well suited for November storms and trips across the Sahara? It sure is! In fact it's suitable for any journey, just as long you're not driving there. I don't know about you, but I sure could go for another one. If drinking another one is wrong, then I don't want to be right. Another winner from Bell's Brewery! I'm finally going to end this review by saying this beer is black gold and worth ever penny."
"D: A wonderful stout that's so complex, that anymore than one and you're just asking for friggin' trouble. Wow!"
"I served this lightly chilled into a nonic. The head is a dense gray milk chocolate/cocoa color, about three fingers thick, with good retention and thick billowing lacing densely coating the glass. The body is so black its unquestionable opaque, mahogany times four, slightly oily, but o so pretty. The smell is straight up dry roast coffee, some buiscuit, dark chocolate, nutty notes, with a pinch of salt and smoke, but just a pinch (which becomes much more apperent as it warms up). Alcohol is almost undetectable in the nose. Hops are not very present, except for a tinge of earth or grass / dirt. This is definitely a malt forward beer. Taste is excellent I might even say huge"" tons and tons of roasted malt, black patent, good maybe crystal or even Munich malt sweetness, which is balanced excellently by a tasty IBU. I get roast coffee, chocolate, home made soy sauce (only in the good way), biscuit, with that same slight smoky salty flavor. The mouthfeel on this is so thick and full maybe the thickest of all the RIS Ive had this season. Wonderful stuff I suggest only one or two at the most in a session. Great stuff all around; I cant wait till next year to get enough to hold me over until the following year."
"As the beer warms, the flavor deepens and becomes sweeter. There is a distinctive fruit flavor in there. The alcohol is present and accounted for and rises up with the warming of the beer. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy and bold with lots of zip and tartness in the mouth. Very good Stout."
"Imperial is the only way to describe this beer. I'd give you a faberge egg for a six pack and a portrait of Lenin. The workers at Bell's have created a monument to the excesses of the Czars and offered it to the revolution. There is a specter rising over Michigan, the specter of me drinking this beer and savoring every last fucking drop."
"A: Like motor oil. A surprising and enticing dark chocolate head. S: Coffee, hops almost completely subsumed under the heavy pull of cocoa and roasted malt. T: Hops now making a bold appearance, nice bitter finish. M: Milky, not much carbonation. Drinkability: Very, very nice, though with the heavy body and staggering alcohol content, this is definitely a sipping beer."
"Pours a deep black with a hint of a copper brown head which settles into a small ring around the glass. Aroma is roasty malts with hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is roast chocolates and slightly burnt malts with some carmel sweetness. Very creamy mouthfeel with a slight alcohol burn. Taste lingers several minutes. Nice stout."
"D--- This was a very well made American imperial stout. It had a very complex malt profile and a big mouth feel that I expect from this style. It has a little too much alcohol to session but it was the perfect winter dessert ale. It was delicious and I highly recommend it."
"Shazam! KIck ass, mo fo. now this is truly big beer. again, maybe it's just my thang, but I pick up hop type hallertau yeast flavs; too fruit for me. Not a bigb head, but lots of lace. almost visquous. roasty dark chocolate, dark overruoe fruits. Would imagine that this beer would age like a dream. creamy body"
"This is truly a beer that has one down fall, its so delicious that when its gone, I want another. I do have another six pack five feet away from me, but thats another story. If you can find this gem your in for a real treat, Cheers."
"All in all this is an excellent beer that I'd definitely recommend, and I'm sure I'll be drinking it again, but due to the high abv and it's intense flavor and thickness, it's one to watch out for...I could probably only handle a couple of these at a time."
"Drinkability: Very nice, but not sessionable, both for the huge flavor and the high alcohol."
"Drinkability - Do yourself a favor and buy this."
"This beer pours jet black with a thick dark mocha colored head. It smells like dark malt, dark chocolate, alcohol, and has a general sweet aroma. The taste is very sweet and very malty and it is very obvious that this is a high alcohol beer. There is a bit of alcohol burn after each sip. It's a bit too sweet for my taste. The mouthfeel is good and full, just like it should be. Overall, it's a bit too sweet for my taste, but this is a good beer."
"Notes: Not for the faint of heart. I can see why some would be turned off by this as its alot to take in (or dissect). I thought it was really good but not in the elite category for the style."
"D - I've never had Darklord, but to me this is the best stout and one of the best beers allover I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Thank you Bell's!"
"Very thick in the mouth, but not overly so. This is what my idea of a stout should be; thick and heavy, yet delicious and easy to sip. I would drink this all night. The alcohol definitely affects you so be aware if you're having a few. The alcohol is masked very well in the taste. This is one of my favorite stouts, by far."
"I had this both on tap at the brewery and in a bottle, but reviewed from the bottle purchased at the brewery. I can't believe this is an 11.5% stout. You simply cannot taste the alcohol content at all. It pours a deep dark black color with some hints of red to it. I didn't get too much of a head from either on tap or the bottle. The little there was was dark brown in color. The aromas were so complex. Chocolates and fruits and coffee or mocha roast with just a twinge of alcohol. The taste was similar. Started out with a little bitterness and then erupting into the complexity of the malts. This was the winner of I'm Bored Tonight Stout-Off, pitted against Deschutes Obsidian Stout and Rogue's Imperial Stout. It was a hard choice - they were all amazing, but I found the Bell's Expedition to be the most complex and and exceptional. Way to go Bell's. Another job very well done."
"I can't conceive of drinking more than one of these. It is huge, relatively complex, with a bitter finish and very warming. Though I won't rate it as highly as the Rasputin or Bourbon County I had the last two days (at least on the BA scale) if I were looking to SIP one beer over the course of an evening in front of the fire, this might be my choice. At $2.33 a bottle, I'm glad I've got several more."
"Overall an outstanding beer and at $2.25 a bottle it's one that I can afford to stock my cellar with. Very big beer. Big flavor, big alcohol, big enjoyment!"
"Drinkability: I can't see how anyone could survive drinking more than one of these... two at most. The beer hides it's alcohol very well, but it will catch up with you for sure! If you can find this, pick it up. This is a must try for stout lovers!"
"Leaves a very heavy taste and sometimes a lttle hard to swallow. Not really a beer I could see having a session with a six pack with. None the less a good beer to drink and savor for the extremely bold flavors. Any fan of stouts should give this a try at least once."
"Thank you MuenchenerKindl for sending this beer out west."
"Wow, thickest beer I've ever had, I believe. A sipper for sure, and what a way to spend a winter evening."
"If a better RIS exists, I haven't had it. This beer is top shelf."
"In a word, extremely highly recommended. Stone makes one amazing RIS, but in my mind, the title (for now) must go to Bell's. Go. Buy. Drink."
"Drinkability: Only one for a night is all I need. Maybe one a week would be about right. Any more and you might ruin your pallate. Very assaulting but in a good way. Will keep me coming back for more."
"An excellent example of the style."
"I figured this could not live up to expectations and was actually expecting a letdown. That didn't happen. I can't say anything negative about this awesome RIS. I wish I had more!"
"Overall: Love this stuff. An exceptional RIS that ranks up there with the greats."
"Bell's continues to impress. This is exactly what I think of when I want a heavy hitting Russian Imperial Stout. It simply has it all. It may suffer from being so hard hitting, but that just means I'm getting my money's worth. Thank you Bell's for giving us such a fantastic beer!"
"M&D - sweet smooth mouthcoat, with a highish warming ABV, easily drinkable, sweet and strong all at once, while maintaining its palatability, a great stout from a great brewery, keep up the good brewing Bells, wish i could get some out east more often"
"I'm glad I picked up a 12 pack of this, and I might have to pick another 12 pack of this to cellar. I can't wait to do a vertical with the few I have left that were bottled in April 2005. Pick this up if you see it....you will not be disappointed."
"Draft at KClingers on the recommendation of one of the smartest but unknown beer drinkers Ive ever met. It poured midnight black with a sticky light tan head. At first, I sense medicinal properties -- licorice, cough medicine (but in a good way), roasted malt and dark cherries. This is an exceptional dark beer! (#2718, 2/18/2007)"
"Expedition never ceases to please. A truly world class beer and one of my favorites."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7740 - packaged 12/19/06. This fresh, young, yet immense imperial stout pours into my chalice a viscous inky black, and is topped with a thin, dark cappucino head that reduces to a collar. After an hour there is no head, but swirling the beer seems to revive it some. The bouquet is strong and aromatic, yet soft, consisting of roasted, coffee, and chocolate malts, licorice, raisins, plums?, green hops, and hints of red and green apples. Although the aroma is big, it still doesn't prepare you for the amount of flavor and body that this beer throws at you. It tastes of strong, black coffee, bitter charred/roasted malts, tobacco, anise, dark chocolate, leather, green/piney hops, port wine, green apple?, caramel?, and just a touch of alcohol - massive and incredibly tasty. The body is full, coating, drying, and silky smooth, with low/medium carbonation, and a long, roasted/coffee finish. This is an awesome, huge stout that demands respect; consuming it is a truly memorable beer experience that just makes you crave more. I can only imagine how it would improve with age. Mmmm..."
"For the style I would consider it very drinkable given its sweet smoothness and overall tastiness. However halfway through a bottle the alcohol will start to catch up with you. A little too much alcohol in the beer and I think I could only drink one of these at a time. This is a great beer for a nightcap thought."
"Very good RIS, and I would love to have more"
"Mmm. Used motor oil. Chocolate with booze filling. Brazil nuts dusted in cocoa powder. Monstrous, full bodied, lingering, viscous. If your stomach experiences high viscosity break-down, then a bottle of this ought to lube your chassis. If you don't try it fresh enough (as I did my first time) it might just seem dense, heavy, oily - a lot of malty heft without much complexity or depth, but this time around I got in peak condidtion and the layers revealed themselves."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a shaker glass. Appears an opaque black with two fingers of dark tan creamy head. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee. Tastes of fresh roasted espresso beans, and sharp hops. Very rich and full bodied. The hop bite lingers in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Delicious and satisfying. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"At first it's like drinking liquid dark chocolate. I detected some maple, molasses, rum raison and coffee flavors. Finish is full of roasted malt flavors. I could only sip this beer at first but as it warmed up it got smoother and smoother. Kind of odd in a way. You really have to let this one warm up to get the full effect. Slightly high on the alcohol level so I had to mark it down just a notch for drinkability. Not for the faint of heart! The most complex stout I've ever tried. If your buddy says he's a beer guy, test him with this one."
"My first Bells, and my first Imperial Stout. As I expected, the color was the darkest black. A creamy thick body. The flavor was dark chocolate with a soft fruity sweetness hidden in there. There was a little roasted malt flavor, but it wasn't nearly as prominent as I would have imagined. It had a bitter finish. As it warmed a bit, the bitterness of the alcohol and hops became more prominent. Overall, a very tasty and interesting beer."
"I have to say I love this style of beer, gotta enjoy it when you can, cause I won't be cold forever...damn global warming."
"Drinkability: I'd liken this to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout or possible Thirsty Dog's Siberian Night, but what's missing here is the visceral, creamy, heady, and ultimately thick and malty delicious nature of those brews. I was a bit taken aback with the hype of this brew, and now that makes sense, as I don't personally think the ratings are giving it the experience I'd hoped. Still, I enjoyed it, and I can certainly see years bringing good things to this. Not sure I'd spring for a sixer in its green nature, but the one bottle I purchased certainly was anything but a bad decision."
"The chewyness kind of detracts form the drinkability, but a lovely fireside sipper that demands respect & adoration. A great Russian IMP stout"
"Oil black in color with a a thin tan head that foams up to only 1/4 inch with a heavy pour. The head is the foamy fine bubbled consistancy and has a slightly reddish tint to it. Smell hits you with a huge wash of flavors. Dark fruits are the most prominant followed by coffee, chocolate and the other typical stout flavors. Also, as it warms you get a real wiff of the high ABV. The taste is just as enjoyable as the smell. I think beer might have the most prominant dark fruit flavors of any stout i've ever tasted. Finishes with some nice bitterness and some alchohol burn. Overall a wonderful beer. Hurt a little on drinkability due to the high ABV. I couldn't see having more than 2 in a night and really 1 is just about perfect."
"A slow sipper for sure, but a perfect match for a soul sucking cold ass night. I'm looking forward to aging a couple of these to see how it/if it mellows out."
"Poured from the bottle into a generic pint glass. This beer is deep pitch black. I hold it up to the light and nothing gets through. A seriously dark stout. Very nice. Pours a fat, heavy two-finger head which is a burnt orange color. It is thick and sticky, and cakes along the side of the glass as the beer recedes, leaving a very nice lace. It's strange, but I just don't get much out of the aroma here. I would have expected more, but the aroma is thin, with some slight coffee notes and hints of hoppiness. But otherwise, there's just not much in the way of aroma here. However, what it lacks in smell is made up for in flavor. This beer is delicious. Creamy, dark chocolate sweetnees mixed with a bitter coffee taste. It is nutty as well. Finishes with a noticeable amount of heat; you can really taste the alcohol in the aftertaste. Still, it's not a huge distraction, but it's just too hard to hide all of that 11.5% ABV. A wonderful winter brew, this stout will definitely keep you warm on a cold February night."
"-Oelergud"
"Verdict: one of the better RISs out there in my opinion. The flavors come together very well, and while it is a sipping beer, it is easy to get lost, look down, and see that it is gone and want another."
"One of my top beers of all time."
"Thanks to ColoradoBobs for allowing me to try this beauty again!!!"
"Ive heard good things about this one and I would say it lives up to the hype. Its rich and complex with a nice balance between the rich malt sweetness and bitter, burnt flavors. Highly recommended."
"An imperial stout that could be sipped delicately during long winter sessions. The 11.5% is well hidden and packs a wallop."
"Quite drinkable concidering the ABV, which is really well hidden."
"Served in a logoed Bell's tulip. Looks black as pitch! Head is dark tan / mahoganny, about half a finger with very good duration and excellent lacing, and served in this glassware it looks better than ever! Nose is everything I've come to expect in this brew, a near perfect blend of espresso, roasted and dark malts, and yeast. I let the glass warm a bit out of custom, but on first sip it is tangy, bittersweet, and roasty all at once. The lingering bitterness and roasted malt / espresso notes really stick in yer craw. Rather full mouthfeel and rather complex, with broad strokes of green apple, licorice, and molasses. Boozy? Yes and no: there's no arguing with 11.5%, but it's so well hidden here that it would be somewhat easy to drink this all night, and more than one of these in a sitting can be downright dangerous! As it warms the notes of bitter chocolate and light, dusty cocoa emerge and begin a nuanced and masterful interplay with the bigger, broader flavors mentioned above. Hop use is just about perfect: this isn't a style or a rendition that will suit everyone, but Bell's have thankfully resisted the 'bigger is better' approach to bittering hops that resulted in the Imperial IPA style. Carbonation is great here, and apart from one rather infamous batch has always been so. Full-bodied but not heavy, and warming rather than hot. Well balanced but not-quite sessionable . . . this is the epitome of a sipping beer."
"d - gives a nice warming sensation and the alcohol begins to mellow towards the finish. this beer will be spectacular after one year plus of cellaring."
"D- man, I can only hope to sample this beer again. It's not easy to find here and I paid big for this bottle, but it was worth it!"
"D: A magical elixir! The perfect brew to warm the soul on the most bitter cold winter evenings. A special treat that is to be sipped and savored over time. I highly recommend aging this beer for at least one year before trying. Must try!"
"the re-review is from batch 7251 bought fall of '06."
"Real clean on the mouthfeel and drinkability. Its alcohol is not hiden,but at the same time it lets all the flavors through, even if its one by one. Dark-n-sour fruit, molasses, dark chocolate, aged tobacco, and licorice."
"D: A satisfyingly rich pour. Well-balanced between its sweetness and bitterness, this is one I would gladly enjoy again and again. An excellent sipping beer that I heartily recommend."
"I purchased a case about a year ago from the Beer Yard in Wayne, PA. I realized right away that this is a beer that you have to let age. I drank a few fresh, but the flavors were all competing and too strong. After a year of aging, I have to say this beer is unbelievbale. It pours thick and black and totally opaque. Two finger's worth of super thick, fluffy tan colored head. The beer smells of dark roasty malt, lots and lots of roasty flavors appear to be on the way. There is also some hints of figs and raisins soaked in alcohol. The aroma leaves to mystery as to how this tastes. There are good hints of chocolate and coffee amongst all the roasty malt and dark fruit flavors. The mouthfeel on the aged beer is significantly different than when fresh. Its much creamier and smoother now. My only problem with this beer is that its a tad sticky, sweet. But thats something that is part of this style of beer. The drinkability is a tad difficult because its sweet and high in alcohol. This is just a great beer."
"Overall: Wow. Thank you Himerman for this trade. I think this is one of the best beers I have ever had. I owe you one man. Cheers"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very, very dark brown with a thick brown head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. It smells like chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. It tastes mostly bitter with a bit of sweetness, like coffee, plums and/or figs, semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malt. The alcohol warming in the taste is noticeable, but it's not too much. Mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy. The drinkability is good, but I don't think I'd want any more than 2 at a time. I think it's a good choice as a nightcap. IMO, it's a very good beer. Another winner from Bell's!"
"Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy tan head that quickly leaves, and in return a few islands appear. The second I opened the bottle the roasted malts, coffee/toffee, and alcohol hit me in the face, I knew I was into something special. The taste is very malty, coffee/toffee flavor, the alcohol is hidden pretty well though. Only really shows on the way down, warming the body. Medium body, creamy/chewing, well rounded. Very drinkable, a very very nice RIS, way to go Bell's."
"12oz. bottle poured black with small brown head and a bit of lacing around the glass. Smells of dark roasted malt and a touch of alcohol. Taste of slightly bitter malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Mouth feel is thick and creamy. Drink ability is exceptionally easy with the rich flavors and smooth creaminess."
"This is a finely crafted brew, superb balance, strength and nuance all at once. Next time I'm going on a beer run, I think I'll pick up a 6er for aging to see what happens."
"Eric"
"Rich 99% cacoa dark chocolate, licorice liqour, and heavily carmelized maple syrup. Soft, settled, and thick from sitting in the bottle; lacks much carbonation, but it's got plently of spunk with the rich flavor notes. Maybe the thickest beer I've had yet, behind Sam Adams Tripel Bock. Highly recommended for big beer fans."
"Although it's not one for sessioning, it has a sublime quality that makes you savor every sip. Every so often I crave an Expedition, so it has a year-round place in the cellar."
"Drinkability: This beer would be best consumed as a dessert in itself. It has the body to fill your stomach and complete a meal. At 11.5% alcohol it will bring on a buzz even after a meal. This is definitely not a session beer. Enjoy it slowly and thoroughly."
"Update: Sampled a bottle from this six pack last night, 12/28/08. This makes it two years in the cellar and 3 months shy of 3 years since production. Sampled against a fresh bottle. The aging helped to mixed some of the incongruous flavors together, and made an all out great beer. This is going to become a cellar staple for me."
"It pours out black as night, with a little bit of creamy brown head. It dissipates rather quickly but reappears a bit after every swig. The aroma is rich, filled with caramel, chocolate, roasted coffee, doughy yeast, and a little alcohol. Really interesting. The flavor follows a similar line - starting with the chocolatey roasted malts and finishing nicely with a dark bitter taste. A hearty one, this is. In the mouth it's great, too - creamy, with smooth carbonation. Finally, the richness and the alcohol might stop one from downing multiple mugs of this, but overall it's a great brew."
"Poured black into a goblet. Camel colored head. Pruney and chocolatey smell that really sticks in the nose. Very appetizing smells. Caramelly, roasted malts jump out. Initial tastes were of hot cocoa and even a dark fruitiness switching into a bitter hop profile and some burnt malt flavors. Bitterness is felt throughout the mouth even on the roof. Heavy and slick mouthfeel barely any carbonation. Leaves a thick ring of lacing behind and clings to the glass. Booze level becomes more revealed as it warms up. Excellent for the last stout of the night."
"The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. The carbonation was spot on. The drinkability was good."
"Overall my favorite example of an RIS, and maybe one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Overall a tasty RIS. Big flavors and big ABV."
"Friggin outstanding in almost everyway. Mocha, molasses, burnt sugar, with a touch of alcohol in the nose. Loads of bitter chocolate, a certain grittyness to it. Very mouth filling. Long finish. Onyx black. I sure would like to see some sort of head on this bear though. Tastes great, and fills me up just fine"
"I can't say much bad about this beer, except that you don't want to try to taste anything afterwards. I'm in love. I wish I could get this locally - I'd certainly try cellaring it if I had the means, as I think the mellowing effects of a bit of aging would enhance the subtler notes that are for now a bit hard to pick out from the flavor onslaught."
"A year or two of cellaring might make this my first 5 across the board. I will have to revisit this one and re-review in a year. I hope I can wait that long."
"Pity."
"D - I'm very glad I was finally able to get my hands on a few of these, but I can honestly say it was worth the wait. Instantly became one of my favorites from Bell's. How do they keep producing top-quality stouts? Keep them coming!"
"Dry, powdery and gritty brew, full bodied rich and thick. Just too darn syrupy for a real long drinker. It really needed more hops to balance this bad boy out."
"Overall, this is a really big, really solid RIS. It would be hard to drink more than one at a time, but IMO this rivals, if not surpasses, Stone RIS and the other big stouts for the top of the list."
"I had previously given this beer across the board 5s, based on a previous sample -- a bottle that was about 18 months old. The above is based on a fresh sample. While I'm sure that the aged sample didn't deserve anywhere near the perfect 5, it was notably better, and I'll be curious to review again, with another aged sample."
"as far as drinkability i can obviously drink alot of it F@ck it...lol this is some awesome imperial stout...ffsITS STRONG u are missing out if u ignore the fuckin price....i was blind but now i see...Again, in your face...this one is unbelievable i will be buying it if itys in the store again...icant wait"
""
"This is a great sipping beer, really packs a punch of flavor (and alcohol) but is pretty drinkable."
"I really enjoyed this beer. A little sweet for me, but very enjoyable. I'm quite surprised by some of the reviews stating this beer's high ABV being a turnoff, yet enjoying certain Quads that I found higher in alcoholic flavor. I'm guessing that what the real deal here is that they enjoyed the flavor of those beers more, and I enjoy this beer's combination of flavors instead. What gets you through a big beer? For me, it was this beer's fun flavors."
"This pours like motor oil with a nice tan head about an inch or so thick. The head disappeared within minutes, leaving a thin ring around the glass that left some lacing with each sip. Burnt, roasted, and alcohol aromas hit the nose equally. Espresso-like flavor balanced with a touch of alcohol that warms the soul on a chilly evening. Despite the strength of this stout, it handles very smoothly. Excellent."
"This is a take it or leave it beer. You can either love it or hate it. That is because is a strong, in your face, it-is-what-it-is beer. Poured with minimal rich caramel head, not too high. Has the sweet smell of burnt caramel. It tastes delicious with a hint of sweetness and has a thick, dry mouthfeel that lasts a while. It is rather expensive, but I don't regret having spent the money. Although American style IPAs are my usual choices, I can see my wife & me spending quite a few evenings with this Russian Imperial Stout this winter."
"Buy this knowing you own one of the best stouts available, and it keeps on giving."
"Drinkability is top notch, this is by far a leeding example of the style. Sure have another. I wish I had more, thanks Shbobdb, Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours a massively chunky pitch black, with a mud tinted light head speckled with red bubbles. Foam settles immediately to a ring of dirty lacing and pockets of bubbles in the center of the glass. Huge punches of chocolatey roasted malts and alcohol. Taste, well I took a bite and chewed on itlike an alcohol soaked piece of dark chocolate cake with molasses icing. It feels like it was brewed with roofing tar. Immensely chunky mouthfeel. Drinkabilty was not so high, as the alcohol is a bit too noticeable. However, a great after-dinner treat."
"The mouth is complex, sweet and creamy in the middle, and features a drier sherry finish--very lively on the palate, despite a lack of carbonation. Probably wouldn't want to drink a six pack in a sitting, but is an unique example of the style."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and thanks again to TheManiacalOne for sending it to me. I think it could use a bit of age, and wish I had another for the cellar. Overall a great imperial stout, that can hang with some of the best of them."
"Wow. Just... wow. A tremendously complex, deeply delicious beer. Makes Wordwide Stout taste like a pile of puke! Though to be fair, I don't think I've ever aged a bottle of World Wide Stout for 18 months."
"This is the perfect snow day beer -- even if I'm tasting it a couple months early. I'm going to have to stock up for the cold winter..."
"A dessert beer,can only be sipped.A port-like beer with lots of aromas and exploisons of flavor in the mouth. A very interesting beer that seems to better with age."
" Contrary to what others have said, I think this is remarkably drinkable for how big a beer it is. Sure, I wouldn't want more than one bottle, but that's not the point. I savor every drop of the 12 oz bottle and end up very satisfied. An all-around amazing beer."
"Knowing that I've got six more of these scheduled for delivery tomorrow (along with several other awesome MI brews, courtesy of BA hoppymeal), I decided to crack open this bottle I received in a trade from BA nflmvp last summer. Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, Expedition Stout is viscous and tar-black. The ghost of a coffee-colored foam cap appears for a brief moment, then is gone, leaving only a nascent tan ring around the glass. Deep chocolate aromas emerge at first sniff; then scents of dark Bing cherries soaked in anejo rum along with a slight coffee aroma as well as a heady cabernet character. The taste starts off with bitter Belgian chocolate bar flavors -- at least 75% cocoa -- and dark fruits (plums, cherries, blackberries) all drunkenly swimming in a bourbon bath. Then -- and this is my favorite part -- there is the most wonderful roasted coffee finish, thick and damn near burnt it's roasted so dark. Lovely vinous aftertaste. Appropriately heavy on the palate, but incredibly silky overall. Low carbonation, dryness from alcohol content, but the booze has melded nicely (I think this bottle may be a little over a year old). This is the first Russian Imperial Stout I've had in a few months, and I certainly feel welcomed back home. Bell's brewed the hell out of this one. Easily one of the finest representations of the style in the world. Exceptional."
"I would probably have this on hand if it were local/available. Definitely needs to mellow out a bit in the cellar but alas I was awarded only one bottle. I would love to age this for a couple of years and lay it up against Stone/Raspy/Rogue etc. I think it can hang with those boys. thanks again eric, next time you are in illinois I have a request..."
"If I could buy this again and again I definitely would. This is extremely delicious. I hope every stout lover out there gets a chance to try this."
"Drinkability: Something strong isnt very drinkable. Something that tastes special at first would get taxing after more than 2"
"D - Exceptionally drinkable over the long term, I don't think I could have more than one or two a day. But that's every day. :-D"
"D - I've never had this fresh, but it has held up well for the most part. Rather complex and enjoyable. Would like to try this again."
"D: Awesome beer, I wish I had more of this one. Would taste very good on a cold winter day, very warming beer."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- if fresh"
"This is an incredible beer....great smell of coffee toffee and burnt sugar, mouthfeel was not to thick but thick enough to be considered big, definately not syruppy. The taste is phenominal with great toasted notes and coffee overtones Very very drinakble at a slow pace...carefull do not get too loaded!"
"Inky black in color. Pours like a thick oil. Very little chocolate colored head. Chocolatey aroma with some raisins and coffee. Also a slight piney hop aroma. The coffee is stronger in the flavor that expected, but very good. The dark chocolate flavor works well with it. Also a slight hop balance. Full mouthfeel and slightly creamy, but not as heavy as I expected from the pour. This is a very interesting and complex beer. Oh to have this available all the time..."
"Good beer, but is most definately a sipper."
"I can appreciate a beer with a high abv, and this is one of my favorite styles, but this one doesn't do it for me. Overly malty, even for the style, no carbonation, and the alcohol is not masked and doesn't really add to the flavor, leaving the sweet rich chocolate to be the only dimension to its potential."
"drinkability is good. it's thick and rich and almost seems more like a sipping drink. very well balanced and quite tasty. would be nice to try this one after some aging."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabililty- Fantastic in the mouth... sublime swelling from milky liquid to creamy foam. Savor each sip, it's genuinely huge and enjoyable."
"Appearance: black. Head bubbles to a glorious brownish froth. A lacing almost as impressive as true Turkish coffee is left as you swirl the glass, exquisite. Smell: roasted malts right away, and a smokiness I cant put my finger on. An enticing aroma! Taste: with all of the aromas the taste does not disappoint. very thick. It starts off very roasty, the alcohol pretty well hidden for a beer of this caliber, it ends with a nuttiness that does not end. You are constantly chewing for different flavors. There are also hints of caramel and coco too. The finish is a little bitter. Mouth feel: This is not a harsh beer, but it is certainly not easy one either. Very smooth and extremely creamy. Drinkability: OK they should almost have a warning on the label ""one is more than enough."" Session beer? (You will hurt yourself 11.5 ABV). This is a big Imperial stout. Have fun."
"This Russian Imperial Stout rules. On a night when I had several stouts to compare to Bell's Expedition Stout came on top. Poured a thick black motor oil w/ a 1 2/2 inch mocha brown head. The sight made me think I was going to drinking a cuban expresso. The aroma was amazing and well balanced, sweet molasses, strong coffee and a vicious alcohol scent. The scent of alcohol doesn't disappoint as it also lingers in your mouth forever w/ a thick full body syrupy feeling. At 11.5% ABV, this brew doesn't play around and it's great for sipping."
"Timing is, again, everything. I was really looking forward to this beer, as it is one of the top-rated in the world. However, I found that it is NOT the beer for a hot summers night. Great aroma of very sweet malty chocolate and carmel. The taste follows suit, and at first was enjoyable. However, by mid glass, the beer seemed to get thicker and sweeter, and by the end, the alcohol was leaving a very warming sensation and it was like drinking a sweet thick syrup. I intend to pick up another bottle of this when Im in the midwest, and next time drink it on a cold winters night, maybe as an after-dinner drink."
"I like this beer. Too bad I can't get it all the time."
"Poured into a pint glass, beer is so dark, light cannot penetrate it. There is almost no head and the beer is very heavy. The smell is wonderful, of intense/complex chocolate malts with hints of caramel. The taste is just as complex, with an alcohol bite at the end, but not too bad considering the 11.5%. Almost no hop taste is apparent, covered completely by the roasted chocolate malt taste. The mouthfeel is dense and smooth, a very thick beer with little carbonation. This beer would be best served as a nightcap, served in a snifter - to be smelled, enjoyed and sipped, not drank in mass quantity."
"It was poured in a nice snifter. No carbonation with lots lacing, thick and murky. Wonderful mix of chocolate, raisins, caramel, and malts. I loved every bit of it more than i've ever loved another beer."
"Notes: A superb imperial stout. I thought the alcohol would have more presence, but I was pleasantly surprised. The roasted malts are the center of this beer, and Kalamazoo has done a fantastic job exploiting them. A great after dinner sipping beer."
"But huge. Huge to the point that drinkability might suffer a bit. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one in a sitting. But what a sitting!"
"This is a very good beer."
"I will reach for another, and I do like this a lot, but I wished for a bit more. Not the best RIS I've had, but still nice. I think it'll age well...I certainly have enough to find out!"
"Overall, a pretty solid beer although I dont think that I will buy it very often because of the price, but I am not disappointed in my purchase."
"Perhaps I am too much of a newbie, but this beer did nothing for my palate. While highly regarded among beer enthusiasts, the alcohol dominated this beer from aroma to finish. The pitch black color was exciting, but the small, fizzy head that soon disappeared was lackluster. The smell and taste of alcohol was too overwhelming to be enjoyable and more balance would make the beer more pleasant. I prefer the Bell's Kalamazoo stout. Sorry, not a fan."
"D: One of the most complex stouts on the market. This beer takes the tongue for a ride. Absolutely excellent imperial stout."
"Pours black and thick out of the bottler. Huge persistant dark tan head clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Coffee and chocolate roasted malt aroma dominates the nose along with some excellent fruit notes. Powerful espresso and chocolate roasted malt flavor hits first. The finish is powerful alcohol followed quickly by hoppy bitterness. There is a lingering roasted malt aftertaste and bitterness with notes of fruit. Mouthfeel is heavy. Not extremely drinkable but very good stuff. Definitely could pick up a six pack of this in the winter."
"D: A very good RIS, but the alcohol in the nose is a bit much. This one seems a little young right now, and a year or two of cellaring would do it well."
"D: Tasty & smooth and you certainly wouldn't know that the ABV is at 10.50%, which makes you want another and another until they start catching up to you."
"Notes: This is one great stout, maybe top 3 in my book. I will definitely try to get a case of this every year. We'll see how it ages, but it is damn fine as is, right now."
"Pours black with minimal reddish brown head that fades quickly. Very big, rich aroma is comprised of smoky and peaty smells with roasted malts, and a vinuous and big bourbony booziness. Taste reveals rich sugary malts, a hint of chocolate liqueur, quite sugary as it rolls on the tongue with some cola like flavor as well. A pleasant warming alcohol bite finishes the taste and there is a slightly drying aftertaste of roasted and smoky flavors. Nice big and chewy mouthfeel, a very rich and enjoyable ris. From batch 7205 at cellar temp."
"D: huge body, 11.5%, and not available in Mass! but all things considered this goes down pretty well on this painfully humid night. one a night for sure though, quite filling."
"Drinkability - i couldn't handle one beer, let alone two."
"Dark, near opaque brown with a Crayola brown skim on top. Crude like. Well hopped and burning aroma of vanilla, coffee, plum, and booze. Tastes and feels like bitter and acidic coffee sludge with a hint of chocolate and a shot of gasoline thrown in for good measure. Dark fruits are also present. Very assertive, butt kicking beer. A bit much to drink more than a few ounces of. Long term aging would do this beer well."
"Drinkability: While the flavor is balanced and fairly impressive, the bite in this beer is definitely a challenge. Enjoyable and distinct, but not most drinkable big stout I've had. Will probably please hopheads and strong beer fans who appreciate aggressive flavors."
"Drinkability/Overall: J.H.C., this is a potent beast of a beer - kudos for that - but a bit of a chore to drink, even 6 ounces worth. Yeesh. I'm spent, but must trudge on..."
"This is probably My favorite stout of all time so far. It's going to be very hard for me to find any other that could top this!"
"D: Abv is very noticeable. This could be a very drinkable RIS if it just calms a bit more--Possibly I cracked it too soon? Luckily I have another in the fridge. Pretty decent tasting RIS from Bell's, but I'm not sure about it. There was just something amiss. Everyone seemed to like it, but I'll swim against the current on this one."
"Cheers!"
"As I stated at the beginning, this beer could be great, and many other BA reviews don't seem to have a problem with the way this is put together, but I found that the lack of carbonation really held this beer back."
"Drinkability: I think that this is a wonderful beer. But it is by no means a session beer. The alcohol is powerful and the shear syrupy liquidness would make drinking 2 difficult."
"Dthis is a sipper, no doubt about it, a perfect dessert beer, but one is plenty"
"Wonderful. Cheers!"
"Put off only by the sheer amount of greasy yellow goop that is fairly hard to keep out of the pour."
"D: I found this beer highly drinkable. As soon as I finished one I had the want to open another right away. It was really a lovely beer."
"Pitch onto yeast cake of dry ale yeast (mine was from the ABDIJ beerkit from Brewferm). Age for 1 year. Prime with brown sugar."
"Good drinkability for a stout of this size, because let's face it, this is a huge ass beer."
"Nice job Larry :-)"
"Definitely a world-class imperial stout. This has TONS of character."
"This is a beer a lot like Turkish coffee, it is OK in small amounts but you tire of it quickly. This would be a great beer for a 4 oz shot but a glassful gets tiring quickly. I have had better."
"The first few I had of these were a bit... um... too thick. Too much. Over time I've learned to appreciate this wonderful richness in a glass. Recommended if you are looking for a super thick over the top RIS."
"My scores are going to be largely out of line with everyone elses, but my only explanation for this is that the Expedition may be a hit-and-miss beer. This is my first time experiencing it so its possible I stumbled across one of their better batches aged for just long enough to blend the flavors perfectly. Anyway, disclaimer out of the way, here we go: Pours pitch black with a gorgeous (almost edible) milk chocolate head, with dense packs of carb bubbles clinging seductively to the sides of the glass. Smells of brown sugar, molasses, a touch of black licorice, and dark malt, all of which blends into a bouquet far more inviting and less intrusive than other beers of this abv magnitude. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, very milkshake like, leaving a sticky coating on the lips and tongue. Cholocate and sugars predominant up front followed by dark roasted malt on finish. Superb flavoring - all other ingredients whiffed before drinking blend so well into the chocolate and malt as to be almost individually imperceptible. Alcohol is unbelievably well hidden, probably the best that Ive ever seen for this strong of a brew. Although the alcohol does eventually make its presence known, its more in the ""gullet burn"" than in the taste. You really have to be looking for it on the tongue to even realize its there. No perceptible way to improve this beer at all in my eyes, so perfect 5.0s all around. I do believe this one has slipped into my top 5. I plan on having more very soon so well see if the honeymoon period lasts."
"Although a great beer, this one didn't live up to my expectations. I'll buy it again when I'm in Michigan, but won't go out of my way to obtain some."
"This beer really disappointed me. It poured pitch black and thick, looks like motor oil, very little mocha colored head. Aroma is overpowering with alcohol...extremely distracting. Possibly a little chocolate comes through but all I can smell is that alcohol. Taste is of carmel, burnt chocolate and coffee, but again, the alcohol taste is hugely overpowering. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little oily and the drinkability is definitely low. Don't get fooled by the high rating, this is hardly in the top 20 stouts in my book, unless you happen to like the taste of alcohol overpowering everything. Unfinishable, never will buy again."
"Many thanks go to CRJMellor for a chance to try this well regarded beer."
"Perhaps the expedition is as much a reference to what tasting this beer entails as anything else..."
"Drinkability- Just got this and I'm on my third so I guess it's drinkable to me. This one is on the edge, like I said. love it or hate it."
"Wow - what a beer! I can't imagine how they could have improved it. (Well, okay, if they had tossed it in an oak barrel for a few months it could have been even more awesome but that's about it) This brew was just shy of perfect in nearly every category."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler. The beer was completely black with a thin tan head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavor is rich with malt and chocolate and other things that kick ass. It's perfect for the style, maybe even better than Batch 7000 due to easier drinkability."
"I was worried that this would be another disappointment like the Mephistopheles. It was similar in some ways (lots of sweetness and alcohol), but this was not as over the top and better balanced. Still a little to sweet and alcoholic for me."
"The body is uber thick and chewey. Very nice. Not too bitter or sweet, doesn't dry out too bad in the finish. Good stuff. This sludge almost demands a knife and fork to drink it. As good as it is, it would be hard to drink much more than one in a night. I'm glad I decided to give it another chance and have 2 more in the cellar."
"I had no idea this brew was 11.5%. Chewy, creamy, borderline viscous, it just flows across your tongue. Full bodied with light effervescence. Unexpected, but pleasant, memories of Samiclaus without the overwhelming presence of that brew. This beer is what the uninitated think all dark beers are, and in this case, it is as it should be. This is a stout that can easily be the standard-bearer for the style."
"Tastewise, again, ""huge"" is the theme here. Tons of sweet dark berry flavors, followed by burnt coffee, dark chocolate, and just a hint of peppery alcohol. Considering this thing is 11.5 percent ABV, it hides its alcohol extremely well. Expedition Stout rolls around the mouth with extreme thickness and creaminess, almost like a melted milkshake. I could swill this stuff all night were it not for the staggering -- literally -- ABV. Oh well. Maybe some things are better in moderation."
"D - Drinkability is outstanding, even at a more than wealthy 11.5%. I've had this a few times, and this is the first time I am reviewing it and for some reason it seems so much better this time around."
"Drinkable for sure, I would buy this for sure."
"Very nice beer."
"Very dark brown, almost black, pretty thick tan head leaving waves, yes waves of lacing on the glass. Chocolate aroma, only a faint coffee smell and a little bit of alcohol in the nose; a little more coffee roasted flavor and this would have had a five. Chocolate starts you off, leading you into a bit of coffee flavor mixed with some hopiness, then chocolate and coffee paired together with an alcohol warmth at the finish. A complete joyride the taste is. Thick, full bodied, little carbonation and seems to be perfect. Each drink is great and an all out experience of the senses, just a little short of perfect. With reviews varying in quality levels, I'm glad I picked up a good one. Scratch that, great one."
"Taste is chocolatey/coffee... large roasted grain leftover on the palate and a great balance of alcohol. A truly great example of this style."
"Black from top to bottom and edge to edge. Capped with 1/2 inch of beautiful khaki head. Gorgeous smoke, coffee, and dark chocolate aromas with whisps of bitter hops. Some sweet fruity (prunes) alcohol in the nose. Hits the tongue with a wave of coffee perfection. Sweet prune and chocolately flavors as well. Low but appropriate carbonation levels. Thick, but not creamy, mouthfeel. Drinks well for alcohol content, but because of alcohol aroma/taste, it would be hard to do too many."
"Thick black with a slow-to-rise, not-too-tall, very dark, not-long-lasting-but-laces-some head. Smells like a salted chocolate bagel - very doughy like that. Tastes like deep cocoa fudge with mellow raspberry. Oily and strong herbage. Very nice, though I could like a little more bite. The alcohol is at a perfect level. Thick feel, but not slick and not fluffy: quite amazing really. Finish is balanced and lovely, and welcomes another sip. This is godly."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. Coats the tongue with a lasting impression of powdered cocoa. I don't mean to give the idea that this is some sort of cocoa flavored beer, but there is definitely an element of unsweetened cocoa down in there with all of the other flavors. This is a wonderful, rich, complex beer. I have been sipping on this one for about an hour and a half and enjoying the hell out of it. Drinkability is rated low because the burnt flavors really slow me down (in a good way) where others of the style are relatively easy to sip continuously. Overall, this is a very very good beer."
"Praise the heavens this fine ale. Waves of complexity unfold in your mouth in nearly perfect succession. Depth too. To do this one justice most certainly requires more research. That and a larger vocabulary."
" Carbonation is lacking to say the least, and the alcohol isnt hidden, it burns my throat slightly, but the beer seems to be fairly creamy and oil like on the palate. I enjoyed this imperial stout but would have enjoyed it more if the finish would have been smoother and the carbonation would have been there."
"Thanks skyhand"
"My first reaction was ""WTF, did they fill my bottle with motor oil by mistake?!?"" I tried an aggressive pour and still only managed wisps of head in the glass. The beer was viscous, black (even the white bits was black), oily, with the only head a thin coating on the top of the liquid. The nose was huge with alcohol and chocolate. The mouthfeel was both slick and thick. After my first swallow, I realized that Larry ain't playin' around here. This is lights out action in a bottle. Nitey nite. My notes remind me to sic Carolyn Blowers on this one, since she has proven capable of drinking Russian Imperial Stouts first thing in the morning. I got an interesting mix of bittersweet chocolate, charcoal, and smoke floating across my tongue. The finish was smoky and chocolaty, just beautiful. My notes ended because of a sudden urge to lie down."
"Drinkability: Marvelous flavor; just a bit too boozy; clearly improves with a few years of age though the hops do fade"
"So . . . for those 364 days a year when you can't lay your hands on a Dark Lord, this is a great and very affordable next best."
"Drinkabitly is great for high ABV Imperial stout. I'd take this on a journey North , east , or hell, I'd drink it on the beach."
"This stout nearly achieves a delicate balance, except the smoky finish is slightly overpowered by the fruity chocolate malt that is perhaps overly sweet. It's a strong brew also, making it hard to drink more that one or two. It is one of the best Imperial Stouts I've tried, yet it still could be better..."
"A great example of the style. I will definitely be looking for this when the colder weather starts to come back."
"What a great beer. I would've given it solid 5's except for the drinkability gets a little rough as it warms. The alcohol becomes more present however, still not overpowering. A perfect example of an Imperial Stout."
"Mouthfeel- Oily, heavy, syrupy, but not bad."
"Just a huge, classy, but muscular Imperial Stout. Pours inky black and as thick and viscous as year old motor oil. Develops a thin slick of a deep tan head. Luscious, rich aromas of roasted espresso beans, dark semi-sweet chocolate, molasses and a faint smokiness waft up from the snifter. The palate is near perfection; syrupy thick and oily with a restrained minimal level of carbonation. This is the mouthfeel all big Imperial style beers should attain. The first sip is a life changing experience. Intense flavors of melted dark chocolate and espresso are initially noted followed by a pleasing molasses/maple syrup/dark fruit sweetness. The finish shows off a subtle presence of the alcohol to warm things up with a late palate appearance of a hefty hop bitterness to cut down the sweetness of the immense malt profile. An amazing, close to perfection beer. One that shouldnt be missed."
"Just to let other newbs know, let those beer warm a little. Most good beers don't need to be ice cold."
"ABV is present and I'm still on the fence with this. It started off great but ended up very syrupy with a mild soy sauce taste lingering. I guess I'll split the verdict and call it good."
"12oz bottle: This one pours an inky, very dark brown color. There was almost no head on the pour, but a moderate tan one came up through the darkness to the surface. It subsides quickly. The nose is fairly potent. Chocolate and a roastiness are the most noticeable. Some coffee and alcohol come through also. A bit of a sweetness to it also. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and silky: definitely a full bodied beer. The taste seems to be more complex than the aroma. The chocolate is there, but not as strong as I thought it would be. Hints of dark fruits, roastiness are in the taste profile also. Almost no sweetness, and a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. This is an extremely good beer."
"D: Very drinkable, especially considering the strength! Far more drinkable than some of the American Wanna-be Russian Imperial Stouts."
"D - It is a little heavy , not a session beer. If it wasnt for the aftertaste of the cigarettes it would be ok."
"Drinkability - at this point, this is a tasty beer but not one I'd age again. 4.0"
"best enjoyed fireside on a cold night"
"12 ounce bottle. Expedition Stout chugs out of the bottle into my glass, a thick black color with a small brown head. Winey grape aroma, but that is just the start. Lots of chocolate, roasted coffee, and hops. The hop aroma is very much present, but not overwhelming as it is in other stouts such as Bell's batch 7000. The flavor is silky smooth chocolate, coffee, and hops. Sweet at first, but not cloying. Some cherry flavor. The finish is very bitter. Mouthfeel is full. Just enough carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding. How can this be 11.5%? This is one of the two or three best stouts I've ever had, and possibly the best."
"Must have more."
"Pours like one heavy son of a bitch beer. Looks like black syrup. builds a small fleeting head and the beer literally clings to the pint glass. What's the smell resemble? hmmmm. prunes, lots of fresh melted chocolate. something mildly unsettling in the odor too some weird sourness. Taste is chocolately and bitter with a roasted malt finish. bitterness subsides after a couple of swigs. hoppy flavor should decrease with age. Thick and syrupy to drink. alcohol hits the tongue right away. perfect for the style. belly warming and heavy. i'd have another, but the big chunks at the bottom just didn't do it for me and kept me from wanting another. ill cellar some and see what happens with time."
"I really like the quality of this beer and the perfect roast of the malt, but the sweetness, although right on, is a little distracting."
"Pours motor oil black with small, tan head. Aroma is roasted and burnt malts, coffee and sweet chocolates. Flavor is enormous. Chocolate, coffee, citrus hops and burnt molases. Very bitter. Very dry. Flavor opens up and mellows as it warms. Coats the mouth for a finish that lasts for weeks. Texture is very smooth and creamy."
"Body is just huge, with a very creamy, smooth mouthfeel and a texture like liquified silk. Feels glorious on my palate, so creamy and rich. One bottle is not enough, I NEED more! Probably the best Imperial Stout I've ever had, magnificent."
"Purchased single 12oz bottle, Batch 6672, from Crown Liquors in Fishers, IN. Poured a thick, deep murky black, reminiscent of used motor oil, absolutely opaque, can see no light through my pint glass even at the edges, black as night. Very thin dark tan head gave way to a tan hued light sticky lacing. Smells primarily of dark chocolate/espresso and a warm sweetness from the alcohol. Taste is rich and complex, characterized mostly of chocolatly malts, coffee, undertones of roasted grain and alcohol, starts sweetly and then finishes off with a slightly bitter bite from the coffee/hop profiles. Hard to believe this brew is packing 11.5% abv somewhere, covers up nicely. Mouthfeel is light carbonation, smooth and creamy, thicker bodied. Drinkability suffers only on the strength of this exceptionally smooth stout. Hats off to another fine product by Bell's."
"Slick, dark black, oily liquid pours from the bottle. A minimal tan colored head forms and then quickly disappears. No lacing, low carbonation, but an oily coating clings to my glass. Lots of dark fruit smells, raisins and prunes. Hints of burnt coffee and chocolate and roasted malts. Taste mimics the smell, but heavy on the burnt coffee and chocolate then fades with some hop bitterness. Slight alcohol burn in the belly. Lots of aftertaste. Creamy, smooth, medium bodied feel. Hard to drink more than one, especially with an abv of 11.5%. If your a fan of Russian Imperial Stouts its a must try. I have one in the cellar to try at a later date."
"Batch #6811. Pours pretty much pitch black with a small tan head. I can tell just by looking how thick this stuff is. Actually, at first, there was no head, and slowly one bubbled up from the inky depths. The smell is great, with boatloads of bakers chocolate and a nice sharp, green hop smell. The taste is not perfect though, it was really really sweet. It started with pretty much perfect hops, and then immediately became very sweet. I would say the sweetness overpowered what would be the peak flavors, but then mellowed with some great chocolate and cream flavors and a lingering coffee aftertaste. But seriously, this stuff is sweet. Maybe with a little bit of age that would mellow. I'll probably cellar the bulk of what I have. I wish there were dates instead of batch numbers, but I'll wing it. The mouthfeel was pretty thick, and though there was a bit of carbonation that could be summonsed with a good swirl, it was a bit off balance in the respect. So.. flavor and mouthfeel are both a bit off balance, yet it was quite enjoyable and complex."
"Drinkability? Give me another... but just one more. Not because it's harsh on the palate but just the opposite; it's delicious and very rich and quite filling."
"Taste; wow, those roasted choclate malts really hit right up front, with a little bit of the cooffee blanded in. There's a slight bitterness for the hops, but those are somewhat subdued due to some age. I get a little bit of a vinous and molasses flavors as this warms, with a little bit of an alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but smooth for the the style. I don't think I would be able to drink more than one of these in a night without drooling all over myself.."
"Drinkability is OK. It's really good, but also really strong and intense. One will do me for now."
"compared to the speedway stout i tried last night this is fairly tame, but balance can be a virtue amongst the imperials as well"
"Nice. Well balanced blend of sweet malt, coffee & chocolate. Dark fruit flavours move in & out freely. Agressive hopping - grapefruit & pine. Off dry finish. Smooth, full bodied. Gentle carbonation. Well put together."
"I have enjoyed up to four expeditions in a row (lots of time in between) and they are very drinkable."
"It poured out thick and black and settled with a tiny head that disappeared fast. The color is quite black, but around the top it looks like the brown is sepparating from the black. The smell is intoxicationg with coffee, dark chocolate, mollases, malt, small bits of alcohol, toffee and raisin maybe? There is a lot going on with this one if you take the time to really ""waft it in"". The taste is awsome. Creamy and smooth, sweet and not overly bitter. This is great in a stout this way you can bare to let it sit in your mouth for a while and find all the flavors. Has a great aftertaste that has some burn and punch to it. I think I have found my measuring stick when it comes to Imperial Stouts."
"So dark in color it's difficult to identify anything else within this beer. A slight head with a mocha-color that stays around for awhile. I could smell nuts, chocolate, coffee beans, and roasted sugar; somewhat expected for this style, but still appealing. The taste was just incredible with a richness in flavor and texture that makes it one of the best RIS around. Smooth and creamy from the first sip to the last drop. The sweetness is never so dominant it takes away from the beer or blows out your taste buds. The drinkability is excellent in terms of whether or not I would want another pint, but the double digit ABV prevents me from having more than 1 of these beers."
"A top-notch offering from Bell's. Thanks to Px2GrafX for letting my try this one."
" One of the best stouts brewed these days. Excellent."
"You have to appreciate this beer like you would a work of art. It's complex, flavorful and an enjoyable experience! Happy Holidays. Have another!"
"Murky and dark brown. Minimal head from a conservative pour. Fears of overflow quelled. Small bubbles carbonate. Chocolate coloured ring is substituted for head. Smells of chocolate syrup and coffee, licorice and some fruitiness, and slight alcoholic impressions. The flavours are mostly a bitter chocolate and coffee bean experience. The body is creamy and smooth. This is at least a 9 on Bob's smoothness scale. The drinkability is good in terms of the style. Too much stout can cause pain and chocolate brown dookie."
"Poured an oily black. The tan head grew out of nowhere and quickly disappeared. Smells of sugar, coffee, dates. Tastes of sweet roasted mocha coffee. The aftertaste starts bitter and quickly gives way to sweetness. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth, but I think one is enough for me."
"Drinkability: This beer would have been far more drinkable with a little more carbonation."
"I savored a six pack I bought in March for nine months, and the beer seemed to hold its character brilliantly. So damned good."
"Exceptional brew. Bigger than many Russian imperial stouts. If anything, this feels more like an American double stout to me, mostly because of its size and fullness. The last two Bell's I've had are the 7000 and this. I'm convinced ... nobody does big stouts better than Bell's. Good, good, good."
"This pours into and Imperial pint glass with large clunks and chugs. A thick brownish black (liquid?) with a decent head for such a big brew. Thought the head does receed in just a short time. The aroma is of perfection for an Imp. Stout, roasted coffee and dark bitter choclate. The taste is every bit the same as the aroma but with a bit of heat from the alcohol! There is also a strong bitter presence. The mouthfeel is thick and coating, as it should be. The drinkability is out of this world. I always want more after I finish the first one; although I'm not too sure that I should have another?!"
"Wow! What can I say about the flavor. Knocked me over and left me sippign this beer as if it were the nectar of life. It was full of coffee. but not a dark or even mild roast. It was more of a flavored coffee. Little bits of mocha and hazelnut coffee. Not so much as choclate as flavored coffee. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich. Very smotth drinking--even for such a high ABV. So tough to put the glass down."
"Drinkable - Imperial Stouts are an acquired taste. This is a very fine example of one. I drink about 1 per month."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the opportunity..."
"This brew pours a motor oil black color. The head is brown with a with crown. The aroma is of chocolate, cream, crackers, butter, with Bell's house aroma peaking slightly though. The taste is chocolate, and club crackers, with some really nice bitterness in the finish. The bitterness slowly fades during the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout; full bodied with just enough carbonation to make things interesting. Overall, this is the best impy I have had to date."
"Drinkability... very good, but the flavor was so strong and powerful that I couldn't give it a perfect rating. I could only have one of these and I would have my fill. I would gladly go back to it, however."
"Yes. This is a good beer. Solid, heavy, thick, powerful. Quite possibly the ultimate winter brew. Poured out to a pitch black color with a motor oil level of thickness. Very high viscosity. Lower carbonation, but a nice dense brown head arose from the beer totaling about 3/4 of an inch, and remained consistant. Aromas of chocolatey malts, roasted coffee, earth and soft wood notes. Very appealing. Taste was direct and filling. Flavors of dark turkish coffee, cocoa, heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate and burnt molassas. Amazing, and worthy of the exceptional designation. Mouthfeel was thick and chewy, while still having a smooth and creamy element to it. Very hearty. A good level of drinkability, this brew's 11.5% ABV is hardly detectable, which could mean trouble for those with a six pack on hand and a low level of moderation ability. An amazing brew, and worth the price. The best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had. Highly recommended."
"I heart you expedition"
"Taste is of dark malts, caramel, licorice with some cherries and other fruits, nuts--almonds, raisins, etc. I can tell this will improve as it warms. It finishes fairly clean but does have a little bourbon-esque burn in the throat after. It is also a bit too flat in mouthfeel. I've had better imperial stouts. Maybe I need to try it again in January when the weather is much colder."
"The drinkability of this beer pretty good for an imperial stout, though the high abv would make me hesitate before opening another one of these bad boys."
"Drinkability: My was this wonderful. One sip took me back to a ski vacation up in Maine for some reason. I love the nostalgia a good aroma can spark. This was a fabulous meaty stout that Ill definitely be having again."
"-UF"
"This is probably on of the best examples of a RIS I've had to date. If only we had stouts like this in my state, I'd never have to trade to find them. A huge thanks goes out to beerhandy for figuring this to be a good brew for my tastes."
"Respectable, but way too big for me. Not drinkable in the least bit for me. I'll try thi again in a year. We'll see what I think then!"
"Huge thanks to deejaydan for this."
"overall: the best beer i've had to date. near perfect on almost every cylinder. i love north coast's old rasputin, and stone's ris, but this beer has just a couple more qualities that i enjoy. i can't imagine this getting much better, but i'm laying down a couple just to see. highly recommended. i have received this from patyoda and skyhand, so a huge thanks goes out to both."
"Pours dead black with a one finger brown head. Aroma is sweet, with coffee, molasses, and brown sugar, along with alcohol notes. Flavor starts sweet with vanilla and coffee, which quickly gives over to a grassy, hoppy finish. For an 11%+ ABV brew, I think the alcohol is well masked - it's detectable, but not overly so. Hardly any carbonation in the body - smooth, slippery mouthfeel."
"They were speaking of this beer in hushed tones at the Dayton Alefest last week but I wonder if thats for the $14.99 sticker shock than the actual taste. Its not bad at all. But for Bells and for fifteen bucks I expected better."
"Tastes like a good smoked porter, only without the smoke and with a tart alchol zip. Meat and potatoes upfron, salt and bread in the back. Yummy."
"Poured an opaque black color with no head at all, and no lacing to boot. Had an aroma of chocolate, NUTS, and slightly roasted malts. This brew tasted like chocolate covered nuts, Very sweet, with a slight tinge of alcohol. It had a creamy, oily mouthfeel. The biggest of the night!"
"I tried this beer from my boss who had a few bottles. One of the best stouts ever tasted. Such good aroma and mouthfeel. Pretty much no head, just like motor oil and just how I like it. Rich, Coffe, and chocaltes. Definently top 5 on my favorite beers.--"
"11 months later update-- I found a neglected bottle buried in the refrigerator. I poured it-- and it was like thin chocolate-syrup coming out of the bottle. The taste was okay for a while, although a lot more liquor-tasting than when it was fresher. The mug sat for a while and when I went to take another sip, it was like paint-thinner with plenty of paint-residue mixed through it. If this were the first try of this stout, I'd rate it far lower-- but given the circumstances, I simply thought I'd add my 11-month followup on what happens with this, after some aging."
"a daunting beer, a valiant effort. for the style, not my favorite.. nevertheless i am in awe of this magnificent creation. few people get the RIS right, and bell's does so with NO FRILLS."
"I don't remember having an RIS this good. This has to be one of the best out there. At 11.5%, however, this wil knock your dick in the dirt real quick, like."
"The Expedition Stout is good, but is Stephen Baldwin to the Java Stout's Alec."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't go to the bar and drink a few of these in a row, but these would be perfect for the occasional treat to a truly world class brew or with steaks on the grill."
"Bell's Expedition is a world-class stout, by which all others could be measured. I'm not sure if it is perfect at any one attribute, but it's near that on all. Plus there's several complexities that go above and beyond what the style prescribes. It pairs well with rich foods like honey-dripped dates, smoky bacon, and well aged gruyere."
"Ive been aging this one for some time but cant bring myself to wait any longer. Pours a thick-as-motor-oil deep black ruby color with a very creamy brown head that continues to grow taller as the beer sits for quite some time before it eventually reverses direction and starts to recede. The nose is quite rich with notes of estery alcohol, dark cherries, roasted coffee beans, and unsweetened chocolate. The aromas continue to grow stronger and develop more complexity as the beer warms. Full-bodied, thick, and creamy in texture. Taste begins with sweet roasted malts, dark toffee, and molasses followed by some rather intense notes of burnt coffee that balance out the initial sweetness. Next up are some spicy bitter hops and a bit of smoky charcoal towards the finish. The smokiness remains in a lasting aftertaste on the back of the throat. Wow, every bit as good as I was hopinga tremendous stout."
"Tastess is rich and bitter dark malt. Bitter dark chocolate. Decadent roasted malt. Coffee. Bitter coffee finish. Big thick beer, bitter aftertaste that lingers long. This stuff is yummy. I love a good imperial stout and this one is a great one. Superb."
"D- This is truly the black barleywine that make up a RIS. Very nice complexity and good bold flavors. Great to drink now and I bet it would stand up great to age."
"Pours a deep black, no light is visible, dark brown head forms and laces. Smell is toasted bread, hops, yeastiness, licorice, coffee and alcohol. Taste is insane coffee, lots of chocolate, nice hoppiness, very roasty and satisfying. This was the thickest beer ever. The bottom is full of sludge and it took a struggle of epic proportions to take that down, but it was well worth the espresso shot. Amazing beer, one I would be proud to drink at any point in time. Thanks DrJay."
" The nose is very complex. It is roasty and has a vinous quality. I detect just a slight licorice aroma. The nose is very well blended. The taste does not disappoint either. There is coffee, licorice, port wine, and others I am sure. Beneath all of this, I detect me some hops. There is absolutely no hint at the 11.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is great. It is thick and chewy, but is not syrupy. As I am writing this review, the quality of this beer is starting to sink in. The drinkability is high, especially with the way the alcohol is masked. I will consider myself lucky to have this beer available in IN."
"The word ""huge"" doesnt do justice to this beer. Its jet back with minimal carbonation. Powerful aromas of hops, licorice, rasins, alcohol, roasted malt, and terriaki sauce. It has a remarkable flavor evolution too, moving from hops, to dark fruit, to alcohol, and finally to the dark-roasted coffee, nut, and dark chocolate. Its also insanely heavy in the mouth. I could see this beer maturing into a work of art in a few years, but the sample I had was just a bit too much for me at this point."
"Pours a solid,deep black color. A picture of perfect blackness. Nice tan head on top. Great aroma-big chocolate and roasted aroma. Burnt raisens and licorice. Extremely slight alcohol comes thru. Huge,huge roasted malt flavor. Very espresso like-chocolatey and almost buttery fudge. A very smooth graininess. Huge body-its like a liquid piece of cake-just big in every way. I could consume this all night. A freakin damn fine beer. Doesnt exhibit the harshness as some imperials. This is what a dessert beer should be. Careful-it could be a session one if you put your mind to it. Get some-get a lot!!!"
"Completely opaque, inky black with a rich mocha head. Carbonation was on the low side, resulting in a thin head of small bubbles. Plenty of lacing and good retention. Super malty aroma, licorice, roasted, chocolate, alcohol, dark fruits to the point of being vinous. Flavour starts with some dry roasted and sweet malt, then moves on to cocoa, a moderate bitterness with light hoppiness, and alcohol warmth. Long sweet finish with plenty of roasted malts. Heavy body, chewy and viscous, low carbonation, with the texture of heavy cream. Afterwards, I poured the dregs into my glass. They came out chocolatey brown and super thick, but very chocolatey and tasty. Wow. Lots of complexity and surprisingly drinkable, with the alcohol very well hidden."
"Pours a jet black color with no light shining through, and a good size tan colored head that leaves nice lacing. Smell is rich dark chocolate, gourmet coffee, cream and alcohol. This beer is extremely rich and viscous. Taste is dark belgian chocolate, coffee, blackstrap molasses, and an earthy hops flavor at the end. The beer finishes with a dry, roasted bitterness that perfectly compliments the sweetness in the middle of the beer. Alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms and is strong but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth which increases the drinkability of such a strong beer. A really tasty and excellent stout from Bell's, lives up to the hype in my opinion."
"An ambitious recipe with plenty of kick. Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"12 oz bottle pours an oil slick black into the imperial. Hard pour produced a small quickly dissipating dark beige head. Smell is burnt coffee, caramel, and raisins. Taste is where the wheels leave the tracks a bit. Starts creamy with sweet molasses and then the mishmash of hops and cough cyrup kicks in. Finish is somewhat thin, bitter without either a bite or pleasant hoppiness. Mouth is coated in Vicks (the cough syrup, not Ron Mexico.) Unless this matches your palate, this beer is not highly drinkable. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to have one that has aged a bit more to see if the flavors blend and mellow a bit."
"Well I received 3 new bottles of this beer and after my last experience I am glad to have another try with this beauty. It is a dense black with a chocolate milk colored head that doesn't peter out for a while. Smell of roasted burnt malt, small hints of alcohol and hops. The taste is powerful dark roasted flavors slowly yeild to a bittering creamy swallow, alcohol is present but not overwhelming. I would have liked a little more hops to be present in here though. You could eat this beer with a spoon it has body for days and has a very creamy feel that coats your mouth. This is a great beer and well worth many more visits."
"Who cares take the Expedition!"
"Overall in my top 3 Stouts of all time."
"12oz bottle... 2 years old. Decanted like pitch black tar...incredible cocoa colored cap..moderate lace, soft carbonation. Aroma comes from Gambrinus own grace: like honey mixed with capuccino, prunes and a slight musty hay smell. The body is like liquid gluten ...but smooth!!. This brew lends credit to the term ""chewy malts"" . A glorious burst of cocoa, coffee, dried fruit and citrus peel in the front and middle, then the finish is slightly salty and warming...un-Fn-believable!! Wadda brew."
"Bottle: Poured a thick black color stout with a small dark brown head with excellent retention. Aroma mainly dominated by roasted malt with some subtle coffee and chocolate notes. The roasted malt dominates taste at first and then chocolate and coffee are also easily identifiable. Creamy texture makes this even more enjoyable. It all ends with some well balance bitterness. Body is incredibly full and there is even quite a lot of sediment at the bottom of my glass. Alcohol is well hidden which I always appreciate. Very good stuff indeed."
"I need to get me hands on more of Bell's brews...they impress the hell out of me."
"Labelled with the number ""6672," although I don't know what that represents. Pours coffee black and raises a tight, dirty sienna head about 1/4 inch deep. When swirled, the head leaves a pleasant, melting cling on the sides of the glass, but overall this is not as visually robust (read: gloopy) than some of the others in its style. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate with hints of vanilla extract, finishing with well-integrated touch of alcohol. Nosefeel could benefit from either a fuller body or an added dimension of bitterness; right now it just feels like sniffing at a glass of chocolate milk. Flavor begins with sweetness of raisin jelly, shifts to baking chocolate and finishes bitter and charred. As a whole, it tastes good in an unconventional way, like caramelized onions that got left too long in an iron skillet and burned. Mouthfeel is admirably smooth with a very slight carbonation and no twangy bitterness; but again, more viscosity would be welcome. Honestly, this is a beer that I'm happy enough to have 6oz of in a night. Good? Yes. Overrated? Also yes."
"Pours black with a thin chocolate milk head. Looks like dessert. Big aroma consisting of bittersweet chocolate roasted malts with a slightly burnt or acrid ( but not offensive) note. Also a nice black licorice, raisiny alcohol mix. I swirled the last few ounces around in my snifter for what seemed like hours, and almost couldn't bear to end the aromatic romance by drinking it. Outstanding. The flavor outdoes the nose! Roasted caramel malts, a rich smokiness and bitter coffee hit you up front with with a sweet raisiny alcohol warmth bringing up the rear. Mouthfeel is very thick, I almost needed silverware. The perfect after dinner drink."
"Drinkability: Not the most drinkable imperial stout. Too bitter for me. It's hard to drink anything after this beer. I've certainly had other imperial stouts that don't leave such a lingering taste."
"An expedition into the heart of darkness, well worth the journey."
"Mouthfeel is big, thick and creamy. Give this to people who say Guinness is a meal in a glass and watch them shit their pants in astonishment. As for me....this is how I like my Russian Imperial Stout...huge. Obviously...this is not a session brew by any means..but it is an incredibly tasty treat that no one should miss out on. Cheers to Bell's for producing one of the best brews I've had the chance to sample!!"
"Deep inky black pour into a tulip with a very thing very brown head that quickly dissipated. Smell is of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and I thought maybe some nutmeg or vanilla. Taste has lots of the same coffee and chocolate flavors with roasted malt backed up by a huge thick mouthfeel. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for such a thick, high ABV brew; one of the better stouts I've had this winter."
"Once liberated from the bottle, this stout sits black as a moonless night with a very thin brown head. Aroma has good strength, with smells of coffee, chocolate and malt. I also catch a whiff of raisins and caramel. Delightfully thick mouthfeel coats your mouth like cough syrup, and low carbonation does not offer much relief. Quite the big stout feeling - you almost have to chew it. The blend of malts is wonderful - slighty smokey roasted malts are huge in the beginning. Then you notice the dark fruits, I'm thinking cherry and raisin. Then come the glorious hops. Delightfully bitter citrous taste finishes as the stout coats your throat. The aftertaste is a damn near perfect blend of roasted malt and citrous hops, heightened by a warming alcohol taste. Possibly my favorite RIS now. Highly recommended for lovers of this style, but beware, this is one huge stout."
"Bitterness and sweetness have never existed in such harmony on these taste buds before. This beer is everything, oily, gooey, roasty, stupidly sweet, mouth-meltingly stark and chocolately. I can't believe the lack of booze. Best of both overblown worlds? I think so."
"This is one heavy-duty no playing around sort of stout. It's definatly not for the meek."
"Over the top and one of a kind."
"I will be buying more and more!"
"This beer suffers only in its drinkability. The high abv alone makes it too much for a session beer. I have a few more bottles cellaring and am anticipating this one after a couple years. Once the alc mellows this will be one kick ass impy."
"This is a bold stout with a thick black color and a gorgeous chocolate milk head. Its high alcohol content is not hidden by its aroma. The sweet malt smell is accompanied by the distinct scent of alcohol. The taste is similar; robust, almost tangy malts which are unable to mask the taste of the alcohol. This is a beer one must definitely sit down and experience. It's not for relaxing or shooting the breeze. Like many of Bell's beers, it is of high quality but doesn't stand out as something exceptional."
"Served from a bottle into a pint, this poured a very dark ""black"" color with some ruby tints when held into the light at the surface, but not much light got through the glass. No head at all on a rather gentle pour. Aromas are of some roasted malts with hints of chocolate and some earthy hops in there. Nicely balanced aromas and nothing stood out more than the other. Taking a sip, the roasted malts I tasted right away, but this soon gives way to coffee and chocolate flavors by the swallow w/ a nice sweet caramel finish; pretty darn complex. Little carbonation let the flavors burst onto my palete, and the smoothness was incredible! Overall, I would drink this all day if I could, or until I fell over in a drunken stooper! Great brew!"
"Poured used diesel oil black and about as thick. Copper head tried really hard to stay put, but succumbed very quickly. Wonderful coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt flavors swirl in a mist of earthy medicinal hop bitterness. Sure does smell delicious! The first taste just totally sucker punches your mouth. Numbing alcohol and tingling carbonation (hey, guess there WAS some in there after all!) set the stage for a toffee and mocha orgy on the tongue. Lots of chocolate and roasted barley in there. Hop bitterness is present but is more or less chaperoning this dance, making sure that the malts and alcohol don't get too close during the slow songs. The mouthfeel is much less thick than I was anticipating. Kinda disappointing, but it's by no means thin. The strong roasted character gives a very noticeable astringency to the finish that makes this beer not very thirst-quenching at all. That's no problem, though, as the mere thought of another sip is mouth-watering enough in its own right. A surprisingly drinkable impy!"
"Mouthfeel is thick like flannel, fuzzy and sticky. Initially, I was rather nonplussed by this one but the taste and my impressions and ratings improved greatly as the beer warmed. This is one where the rhetoric is true: you *must* let it warm up to just cool before drinking it. I'd like to try this one again after aging it a bit. Thanks to trbeer for sharing this one."
"12 oz bottle aged 1 year. Deep dark brown with a lasting dark tan head. Real nice aroma of coffee, chocolate (dark), carmel, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol carrying the fragrances up the snifter. Flavor is roasty and smooth, with big chocolate malts and roasted barley bitterness. Big thick palate. Bitterness lingers. This is an ager, for to age gets rid of the hot alcohol burn that is present when young. Should be present en every BA's cellar!"
"The flavor, however, is more full-throttle than that! It's almost too much to comprehend - and yet again, it never goes too far out on a limb in it's complexity. It's succulently rich, but not confusingly diverse. Upfront, rich caramel lathers the palate; followed by a mild slap of fruitiness (apple, very soft prune, figs) and notes of toffee and mocha. It's always slightly awash in alcohol (although it's never agressive); and as it crosses the palate a smear of leafy and grassy hops appears (far more so in the younger version than the 2 year old), ushering in a drying bitterness and some mild licorice flavors. It lingers in the mouth, seemingly forever, not unlike the smoke from a good cigar; an amazing cup of cappuchino; or some caramel-chocolate-coffee-and-liquor-drenched dessert. Again, this is STUNNING! This is an amazing beer to cellar, believe me!!!! Go get some now for next year or the year after!"
"I was very impressed by the flavor and complexity of this brew. Kalamazoo/Bell's has so many stouts out there right now that I usually just throw up my hands and pick something else. But I ordered this in a bar in Detroit and was glad I did. High alcohol is evident at first sip and this can be a good thing after a snow storm. Pour thick as motor oil. Hints of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Flavor is rich with molasses and brown sugar goodness. Low on carbonation, but this is to be expected for this style. Highly recommeded."
"To be honest, I haven't liked any of the previous Bell's beers I've tried. They just seemed....off to me. As such, I was very reluctant to drop even $2.50 on this bottle. But, with the bitter cold upon us, I was in the mood for an impy, and I had (obviously) never tried this one. I'm glad I did. This is a very good brew. While I like Storm King, Old Raspy, and Yeti a bit more, I'm glad to know that there's one more great imperial available to me!"
"This beer pours a jet black color with a quarter inch of brown head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is full of dark fruits, more like a belgian quad to me than an impy stout. The flavor is more roated than the nose would say. There is a bit of dark fruit but a ton of chocolate and big coffee on the finish. The beer is just as thick as could ever be. Maybe even more than the breakfast stout. Drinkability is nice. The thickness and the flavor keep it from being a 5 on drinkability, but this is a damn nice stout."
"More chocolate, and a mild alcohol bite. More caramel and a mild hop backing on the finish. That velvet mouth feel I now expect with Bell's. Reasonable drinkability (especially considering the alcohol content)."
"Gripe: Not knowing the age of this beer blows."
" Drinkability is great goes down quick for a big beer finished by the time it took to type down my thoughts. This will be on my list of beers to pick up when I make to a store up north. Very grateful to merlin48 for the chance to sample this masterpiece, one of many great brews he has provided me with."
"This is a huge beer, the sears tower of beer. It looks like spent motor oil with a brown head. The taste reminds me of the ""hungry, hungry homer"" Simpsons episode when Duff has a chemical to add to Duff's malty goodness. It was what an imperial should be, a much bigger version. I can't drink more than one because it is just that big."
"THe beer pours incredibly dark black with ZERO light escaping. A dark brown creamy head of .5 cm foams up and fades to an edge layer rather quickly. Aroma is nice and balanced with a mix of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate and a bit of earthy and grassy hops. First sip reveals a rather thick body and small yet prickly carbonation. Flavor is coffee bitter up front with a hint of grassy hops in the middle and a smooth chocolate finish. A very well balanced beer and quite tasty. Very nice brew, well worth it if you see it!"
"Great smell and taste, but the mouthfeel is, well, odd. Worth a try, I'm on the fence with this one. Maybe another sample would help."
"Drinkability and Overall: I didn't think my long-time favorite Storm King could be topped, but goddammit this did it. Bell's totally suprised me with this. If this were more readily available this might be one of the few beers I drink. This is my new desert island beer. As close to perfection in a stout as you can get. Unbelievable."
"mouthfeel/drinkability: thick and chewy, this beer has loads of body. a wonderful wintertime beer. for the style, this a moderately drinkable stout"
"Very nice example of an Imperial Stout."
"ABV warmness creeps in after a nice creamy bodied beverage. Leaves your mouth warm, dry, and slightly acidic. Has the same slight flatness that I recently experienced with the Czar."
"Mouthfeel: Very smooth in the mouth. The bold flavors are delivered well with the smooth texture."
"Drinkability would be great but for the abv. The abv. is too noticeable. It stands out and that puts it lower on the drinkability scale."
"Drinkability is very good for a beer on this scale of big and bold. Highly recommended."
"I had this beer before and did not like it but wanted to give it another try, I am glad I did. this was a very good beer going to have to buy some more that said I dont know if I got a bad bottle but got no head no lacing.poured black.aroma got malts,molasses, chocolate and licorice.Flavor got same as aroma with a nice taste of alcohol and fruit like plums,raisins.liked the finish that sweet bitterness I am getting to enjoy."
"The poured out an opaque ink black with a huge brown head I had to sip to keep from spilling over the glass. Great retention and chunks of lace left decorating the glass as I consumed this. Aroma is thick with dark chocolate and roasty coffee as well as a touch of fruit and some other unidentifiables. I will have to try and figure out more with my other bottle. The flavor was similar with a strong chocolate taste and notes of roasted malt and espresso. Dark fruits were also in the mix as well as some earthy hops. The finish was a mixed of roasted malts, hop bitterness and a slight alcohol bit. Excellent all around flavor that I couldnt ask any more of. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Damn good drinkability here. Great all around Russian Imperial Stout that is near the top of my favorites."
"Pours a slick motor oil jet black into a Schell's snifter. Smells richly of black coffee and bitter chocolate. Alcohol is present but not prevelent. Taste is full of rich coffee and dark chocolate flavors. The taste is excellent, however, not acidic, whatsoever. Hops bitterness combined with the high ABV makes this awesome beer what it is. Probably the best Imp Stout I've ever had."
"Thanks to mdinges for the bottle!"
"Pitch black motor-oil when pouring, a mirror to any trace of light adventurous enough to try to get through. Superb chocolate brown 1-inch head, long-lasting and displaying awesome lacing, foamy, sticky like it came nitro-pushed. Very rich malt aroma, satisfyingly bittersweet with tons of molasses, dark belgian chocolate over home-made cookies, dark european bread, torrefied coffee with two creams. Subtle fruitiness (plums, blackberries), just as subtle complementing hops as I love them, piney and obvious hints of smoke. Very complex, but still not overly envelopping in the aroma department. In mouth though, this is a very intense experience, contemplative flavour development with the typical Bells milky aspect although theres almost no sweetness here. Just great smoked chocolate. Multi-dimensional spicy hoppy aftertaste, piney, bitter and very long. Carbonation was much more generous than I was lead to believe from other reviews, its just perfect here and I think Id have enjoyed it less or found it a bit less lively if it hadnt been for a little tongue-cleaning carbonation to entertain such a thick body. Holy Crap, totally dominant monument that I never expected to enjoy all that much and Ill admit liking some sweetness in my beers and not being a fan of hopfests. Once again, Raindog is the gentleman to be thanked and re-thanked."
"Wyll-"
"This beer is amazing and has absolutely bowled me over like no beer has yet. I cannot fathom taking points away for anything so here it ismy first perfect score."
"A delicious beer. I believe I need to thank pheloniousmonk for this trade that was done over a year ago. So this has to have some age on it. Thanks brother."
"Poured an opaque dark brown, nearly black, with a small, thick brown head. The aromas this beer gave off were nothing short of mouthwatering... all very desert-like, predominantly raisins and chocolate, with some sweet spices thrown in, but some deeper whiffs revealed smells of a dark raisin cake, oatmeal raisin cookies, even maraschino cherries. Taste was just as huge... obviously, a big malty flavor right off the bat with some cascade hoppiness. The tastes of all things present in the aroma coat your tongue  burnt malts, raisins, chocolate, dark and sour fruits like cherries, baking spices and a slight alcohol burn on the tongue and throat, then a bitter coffee-like finish that is unbelievable. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy like it should be. This is a top-notch Imperial Stout."
"This is a drinkable stout, despite the high ABV. Check it out."
"This is a beer so dark not even light can escape it's surface. The singularity of stouts. Delicious. The Expedition Stout has a crazy array of spices that are balanced very well against the maltiness. Any thicker and you would spread mustard on it and place ham and cheese between it. My whole dinner never went down so smooth. This is a great beer that all but has to be used as the measuring stick for other stouts of this league."
"Every sip was as good as it gets."
"Thick, viscous and black with a large tan head that quickly drops down to a thin lace. Had to force the head with a very hard pour. Rich chocolatey nose with the pungent cascades shining through. The alcohol is very very well hidden in both aroma and flavor. Wouldnt have guessed nearly 12% by volume. Nice burnt flavor with a good smacking of hops and roasty malts, but not as aggressive as some of its American Imperial counterparts. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth...quite seductive. Jack up the complexity and this one is a classic; nonetheless, Bell's has done an excellent job with this offering."
"Each year I put back a bottle or two of Expedition Stout. Initially, I wrote the year date on the crown cap and thanks now to the Bell's site I can look for bottling dates for the batches. Tonight, as I was reading posts on the site I read one about oldest beers. I have a bottle of 1999 Expedition in the cellar and now it's open and in a chalice beside me. It poured still as expected. The aroma is chocolate and port. The taste is raisins and port with a nutty bitterness like English walnuts. The flavors are beguilingly blended. The hops are subdued into the blend. This is a silky delight. I urge any fan of this beer to go for the long aging. It's beyond any old beer I've had."
"A must sample for all who venture in to this style..."
"Taste: gee whiz. what a powerful brew. Most probably wouldnt think so as much as i, but from this was probably the strongest brew ive had in my limited experience. Taste was of chocolate, coffee, and a very roasty, burnt taste that lingered in the mouth. with such a sweet nose on this, the bitterness is a suprise, and a welcome one. Hint of candy flavoring, toffee and butterscotch? weird for me, id never expect that in a beer. wow, that burnt taste, as well as the bitterness keeps kicking me in the teeth! Toasty, just like my stomach. definite warming effect in my gut. Alcohol level is high but isnt a prevailent characteristic. mouthfeel is FULL and lovely, thickest ive had (I imagine not the thickest there is though) For my first imperial stout experience im a overcome with joy... and the roasted bitterness. Delightful. drinklability is low just for the fact that i could in no way drink more than two of these in an evening. Mighty tasty! Again i say, gee whiz, what a powerful brew."
"Drinkability/Overall: This is definately a brew to sit back, relax, drink slowly, and enjoy. Let the temperature come down a bit to enjoy some subtle changes. Maybe even stow some away in the cellar. I must say that this is the best Imperial Stout I have come across. A real treat!"
"12 ounce bottle smuggled past the NC 6% limit by AKSmokedPorter. The label on the bottle is upside down..."
"Final Thought: Extremely high expectations down the drain, almost literally, I don't know if this is common in high alcholic stouts, or if I had a bad bottle or what, I can't believe this is a Kalamazoo BC product... love their porter and double cream stout, but this was below par..."
"I gave it a lower mark on drinkability because I'd only drink one or maybe two before moving on to something else a little less ""stout""."
"Poured an amazingly dark chocolate brown, almost blackish.... Great thick and creamy head reduced down to about one finger of luscious caramelly beige lovleyness. This is a beauty to look at, perfection marred by the tons of large pieces of sediment throughout. Scents of chocolate, toffee, sassafrass...roasted yumminess.... So great and creamy, wonderful mouthfeel. Tastes so dark and yummy... Chocolate, very dark black coffee, burnt toast, grapefruit. Light carbination. Very good and one I could sit back and handle a damn few in a sitting. Good amount of thickness to it, but not so it is too heavy. Very great stout. Love this one!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, WOW, some almost nitro action from a CO2 bottle beer, weird, but cool. Formed a thick, frothy 2"" chocolate-hued head above a dark, dark brown/black brew. Head lasts more or less forever, and laces like you wouldn't believe. Aroma is is of heavy grains and malts, but not the bitterness that is usually associated with such a constructed brew. Heavy malts dominate the flavor, but their bitter ness seems to hide behind their sweetness, and make for an easy drinking brew, considering the heaviness and alcohol strength that is hiding somewhere in there... Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability is dangerously high for such a brew. An amazing phenom of brewing construction, this one is."
"Beer is good.Happy strong beering."
"Obviously as big as this is, more than 12oz of this in a session where you've already had a couple, you don't want more than one. That one, though, I have little problem finishing."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this imperial stout, actually one of the best I've tried so far. Interesting that the reviews (and consistancy) are all over the map for this brew. Guess I'll just sit back, enjoy what's left in my glass and count my blessings. Mmm...Expedition Stout.."
"Let it warm up a little and the bitter finish fades and the subtle flavors come out."
"This beer is as smooth and silky as I could ever imagine a beer to be. Big, thick body really compliments this. Great for social occasions and is best made a treat, not for a six pack night."
"Pours thick and black, with a thin brown head composed of many very fine bubbles. Smells strongly of roasted chocolate and coffee malts. The taste, like the aroma, is of roasted chocolate and coffee malts. Some hop bitterness comes through nicely in the finish. This beer has a thick, oily mouthfeel, and goes down quite smooth although it does feel a bit heavy. Overall a good beer, although I must admit that I was a bit disappointed by it--I've been wanting to try it for some time and so may mentally have built it up beyond what it could live up to."
"Drinkability: Well, this is where it gets kind of odd. This beer goes down really slowly. It's sort of tough to have more than one, and even that has to go slow. I feel like its almost too heavy, doesn't dance on the tongue as much as it ought. It initally doesn't seem like 11.5%, but it does feel heavy and slow due to a lack in carbonation, even for an imperial stout. Still excellent though, just a bit off."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't advise you drink more than two of these a night, as the 11.5% ABV will sock your brain and your tastebuds into next week. As a nightcap, a special occasion beer or the end of a session, however, you could do far, far worse."
"This is like alcoholic chocolate syrup. It is way to thick and syrupy for my tastes. I can certainly understand why people like it."
"The texture is so smooth and so creamy. It just glides across the palate. Pecan, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee beans compete with vanilla, nutmeg and sharp fruits. The bitterness is well perceived. A delicious malt experience but it has a few issues. The lack of carbonation does not effect the flavor but it does effect the way I perceive the flavor. This could be so much better. That being said, the 11.5% tastes more like 7. Very drinkable for the style. A very solid imperial stout. Rereview. After several dozen bottling and batches, this is my favorite beer ever."
"Almost 6.5 years later, a two-yearold aged, good coffee and chocolate and so drinkable."
"Is this good beer? Nope. Is it a great beer? Yup. It's a deep dessert beer that's a good finish to the evening."
"This is a very tasty beer, but I feel it must be tried on cask, or tap. Preferably close to the source. I'll see what I can do."
"A beautiful beer to say the least."
"Pours a thick oily black that looks delicious. Thick brown head that laces beautifuly. Smells of roasted malts and chocolate hint of alcohol. Tastes of coffee with a bigger malt taste that follows. Very noticible alcohol, but not overpowering the taste is smoothed out and feels very creamy. Some bitterness but very sudden. Mouthfeel is a full bodied with that interesting creamy texture. Low carbonation and alcohol warming. A very drinkable brew to say the least. A great stout from Bell's well done."
"This is as dark, rich, flavorful and robust as any beer I've had. To my tastes its over the top and not all that pleasant, and I like stouts and rich, strong beer in general. HEAVY roasted, burnt, chocolate, coffee flavors. Mega sweet malt in the finish with a bit of bittering. Extreme after dinner beer. not for women and children or the feint of heart."
"No bottling date. Now this is a seriously dark beer. The creamy head was actually a shade of orange, rather than tan. Midnight black in color, like liquid coal and completely opaque. The aroma yields rich and roasted grains, dark chocolates, vanilla extract and gives a slight hint of the alcohol in this beer. Smells rich and complex. Wonderful flavors in this one  Dry roasted coffee, dry spices, alcohol among other thing. Actually, theres no mistaking the alcohol in this beer. It isnt shy. This has a dry and woody roasted bitterness that is very intense, and is very prominent in the finish. It actually coats the tongue. Theres a medium to full body of malt somewhere in here. I must say that I enjoyed this strong dark beer and can appreciate the craft here, but it is for the initiated only, and not for the faint of heart. Very powerful and intense, but mellows a bit as it warms. Way to go!"
"A big thanks to Feloniousmonk for the chance to try this wonderful brew!"
"It captures light and transforms it splendidly into a smooth and distinguished elixir. Everything about it takes the extra steps to excel, delivering more than you expected, no matter what you expected. The balance is fun but seriously grounded in the down-to-earth components. The high ABV is very apparent, but everything about this makes you want to ignore its strident warnings and have yet another, and I think it's worth whatever risk you may run. Any expedition you need to undertake to procure this fine stout is one you should make gladly, and soon."
"note: after reading other reviews - and seeing that this beer is supposed to have a head and big hops - i wonder if my bottle was abnormal."
"If it weren't for the big price ($14.99/sixer) this big brew would be topnotch. But considering that I can get comparable Michigan imperial stouts from Arcadia and Founders for $5 less, Expedition will have a hard go of it trying to frequent my fridge."
"Like many other beers, I've had this one a few times before I got around to reviewing it. My remembrance of it was that it was just about the best Imperial Stout one got get stateside. I've let the bottle warm up some before I uncapped it. Pours inky darkest brown color with a generous milk chocolate brown head that goes to a lacing around the glass. Dark chocolate, black patent malt, nutty Kona blend coffee bean and some fruitiness from the yeast comes through in the aroma. Whoo. Intese roasty malt flavors intertwined with a vinous, yeasty alcohol bite that warms the esophagus. Bittersweet and winey. Lovitt man... This beer should be a one time in a while kind of beer."
"This stout means business. Pours black and opaque with a cakey, bronze head that remains intact and laces nicely. Smell is striking, melding alcohol dryness, roasted notes, and the standard choco-coffee mix one expects from a stout. Taste smoothes out after a few drinks, especially after the optimum temperature is reached. Taste mimics the smell--rather smooth with a dry bite that piques your interest. Mouthfeel is pleasant; despite a somewhat sticky feel, the taste lingers, rather than the texture. Its strong smell and taste weaken its drinkability a bit, but this beer is worth having even just one."
"Pours a deep black color with a creamy brown head. Thick aromas of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, an aroma I usually associate with Lactose stouts, and alcohol all waft form my glass. What a thick viscous brew, it is quite creamy on my tongue. The thickness and body of this brew helps to balance the roast character, so that it is not overwhelming. It is like a rich, creamy, chocolate covered espresso bean, but accentuated a bit more towards the creamy dark chocolate. This beer has a burnt/ roast astringent finish, which, helps to balance the rich malty sweet flavors that are up front. There is not much in the way of hops, but they would seem out of place in this brew. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste, and is only really noticeable in the aroma. Wow, what a wonderful, smooth, sipping beer."
"Served at room temperature into a Fuller's pint glass, this pours an inky, opaque dark brown with a fascinating head that is only 2 cm, but appears to give garnet hues on the tan fringe. Nice sheets of lace are left behind. Aroma is inviting, with a big mocha chocolate punch, some wood smoke, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with medium carbonation. Taste is delicious. Creamy, milk chocolate dominates the palate, with burnt coffee, wood smoke, walnut nuttiness, raisins, and some English hops for bittering balance. Alcohol remains well hidden until it emerges a bit near room temperature. Finish is dry and bitter, with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Exceptional flavor here, and very nice balance. One of the best stouts I've ever enjoyed."
"Extremely tasty, and highly recommended."
"But this bottle poured with no head and was relatively flat compared to others like Storm King. Do not know if this was an aberation, but this caused a lower score in mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent, but the alcohol level was a little over the top."
"This was an awesome stout! It is one of the darkest black beers I've ever seen. And the head was huge and dark brown. Lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and hops. The mouthfeel was incredible. The high alcohol content was well masked by the malt and hops. I really wish it wasn't so expensive because this was an awesome beer!"
"JahNoth is the man with the big Bell's hookup."
"Since it is 11.5% I had to drink this slow, which was fine with me as it gave me time to savor each and every sip. This is a beer to take in on a cold winters night in front of a fire with one or two close friends and a fine conversation. Thanks damon this made my week"
"was a little wary of this one as i'm usually on the fence when it comes to imperial stouts. started out with an absolutely amazing pour. dark as night black (and thick as hell) with an deep tan head that is absolutely massive and creamy. it leaves anice streaky stickiness on the glass. bravo. the smell is great as well, with notes of cookies dough, spice, chocolate, malt with maybe some coffee hints in the back. i am a bit giddy at this point and can't wait for my first sip. so, while i'm on the fence with imperial stouts as i stated earlier, this one is just a winner. the best imperial stout i have tasted thusfar. starts with a chocolate malt flavour that moves into some bitterness then a dry coffee finish. it gets bonus points from me for not being overly aggressive with the coffee flavouring. there is a nice alcohol warmth in the throat on every sip as well, but the alcohol is maked nicely otherwise. while i would still turn down the coffee flavouring a bit (though just an ever so slight notch), this is a damn near perfectly balanced beer in terms of flavour. mouthfeel is heavy and smooth for this full bodied brew, which is just right in my book. easy drinking and i wish i had access to this brew and to this brewery more often. an excellent brew."
"This is a Big Beer, one that should be sipped and savored. If you like your Imperial stouts with an unapologetically brash, bold, slightly raw taste, but with a refined, well-mannered mouthfeel, then you'll enjoy Expedition Stout immensely. I think I'll age the next bottle."
"Its a thick doozy. Can't wait to try some more, I feel it takes more than a couple to wrap your mouth around this behemoth. Also aging two bottles to see what happens."
"Pours like used motor oil. Thick and black as night. Modest head, but leaves some lacing on the glass. Has a french roast coffee to molassess aroma. Thick mouthfeel, which is appropriate for a this style. The carbonation is light, and needed to make the thick liquid dance on the tounge. This is defineatly a sipping beer. One or two of these would be plenty for the night. The taste is a tad heavy on the roasted barley-roasted coffee flavor for me, but this is an exceptional stout."
"Oh, Lordy, is this a good beer. First let me say that this has not changed nearly as much as I thought it would after four years of cellaring. It hasn't sweetened up like I thought it would and could probably stomach another four years. Having said that, this is one of the most flavorful beers on the planet and is probably STILL too bitter for most even after four years in the cellar. Damn the torpedoes though I am enjoying the hell outta this one."
" Well, Bell's sure made a great first impression. The PA beer laws were good to me on this one. I ""had"" to buy a case. Looks like this one worked out real fine."
"Thanks Al. I think I owe you."
"Defintely a sipping beer and very hard to finish. I did not want another one, and quite frankly, how many of these could one desire, especially with the carbonation issues? My impression, at least from this batch, is that this beer is highly overrated. I'm not completely turned off, but I'll wait for the new bottles. The Bell's retailer should have these pulled off the shelf and supply a more fresher, properly brewed and bottled product."
"Served froma 12 oz brown bottle, this is from the 2002 batch. The expedition poured out an inky black the color of well used motor oil, and unfortunately with just about as much carbonation...however that was only a minor bump in the road and overlooked fairly easily. My only frustration was that I bought this under the inpression that it was the more-carbonated 2003. Aroma coming off this deep dark brew is full of espresso, roasted barley, and sugary sweetnees. The taste is even more rewarding with deep roasty coffee flavor coming right out. Then it begins to be enhances by just a touch of hop bitternes and a fruitiness that I can only describe as reminiscent of the fruit you used to see in big glass jars soaked in brandy once upon a time. Quite smooth and sweet, the alcohol this one sneaks up on you. I'd love to try a more carbonated sample of this one..."
"(Also worth noting that Expy ages wonderfully, like many of the more powerful beers, letting this stuff sit for a year or two only deepends the flavour, and takes the edge off the hops, an interesting juxtaposition with the fresh product, and just as tasty, simply in a different way)"
"This is Bell's best offering without question. An opaque black with a brown head that vanishes immediately after the pour. It's everything you want in an imperial: espresso, dark caramel, toffee flavors with that overwhelming hop bitterness behind everything and the dominating malt sweetness... unnnnhhh! Damn it, I need a towel. Or maybe another expedition?"
"I poured this stout straight and high into the center of my Delirium Noel glass to try and get a head but to no avail. It poured still and looked like soy sauce  black and opaque. The nose was like a stout perfume with scents of roasting coffee, sugar and alcohol. The taste is intense with chocolate, coffee and buttered rum. Rich, thick and delicious. Try it with a piece of good chocolate and experience bliss. My only qualm would be the need to vintage date the bottle to see if time helps. Didnt see any sediment so maybe this is not bottle conditioned."
"ABV is somewhat masked at first but becomes more and more apparent as it goes down. That hurts the drinkability as does the sheer magnitude of this beer makes it too much to do a lot of."
"Poured out of the bottle into a Duvel tulip with little fanfare. Poured like a dark chocolate syrup, a dark burnt brown. Appearance score would have been better if there was evidence of carbonation. In the glass it was black, with some dark burnt red- brown peaking out at the edges of the glass. Wafting some distance away from the glass were powerful aromas of decadently dark chocolate, dry cocoa, and alcohol with some ester notes attached to it. I love it! It entered my mouth in what seemed like a dormant state, shunning my taste buds for a few moments. Then blam!! Ultra-dark smokey chocolate bitterness exploded on my palate, and my lips assumed the conformation of a blissful smile. Exceptional...a riot in my mouth. This flavor lingers on long after a sip is taken. After recovering from the shock I sought out other flavors. I found alcohol, raisins or prunes, hearty grainy malts, and maybe some cough syrup. I had a hard time distinguishing the bitter chocolate from bitter hops, maybe it comes from both the hops and the roasty malts? Mouthfeel was pure velvet, full and smooth. Notable was the complete lack of carbonation. I have heard that older bottlings are nearly flat (which I think this is because of the lack of a band on the neck or upper part of main label). Or it could be the travel mishandling on the way to my glass? I imagine that carbonation would improve the flavor and mouthfeel significantly. When I acquire a more carbonated bottle of Expedition a re-review may yield higher marks for taste and mouthfeel. It isn't extremely drinkable (though good), due to its power and explosiveness. This is the nature of a stout of this caliber. This is one to experience!"
"CRJMellor, I am indebted to you for this 6-pack!"
"[Once this one warmed up, the nose reminded me much of patis. Not a good thing, but not reflected in the smell rating.]"
"A wonderful and rich imperial stout. Not quite as good as some of my personal favorites, it's still up there as a damn good beer nonetheless. Definitely one I'd have in the future!"
"Appearance: Deep black motor oil, moccha tan head leaves speckled lacing. Aroma: Anise, chocolate, plums, and a whole load of underlying hop tones, cascade I think. Taste: Really poetic blend of fllavor here crashing waves of syrupy sweet alcoholic tinged fruit blended with bittering hops and harsh dark roasts what a treat this is definitely alot going on in there. Really potent, the alcohol doesn't burn though it doesn't overdo anything just adds another depth level there. Mouthfeel: Like drinking a protein shake thick and full bodied as all hell, this beer as great streaks of syrupy goodness going on. Drinkability: Complex, enticing, and oh so enjoyable to indulge and challenge the senses, however it's not the type of beer to drink a sixer it's that once in awhile when I get a craving for a big brew that knocks my senses renderless."
"Pours syrupy black with some nice carbonation producing 1/4 inch dark tan head, that is clinging to the glass as I drink it. Aroma was slightly chocolate with a little smoke or peat, also a little bit medicinal and maybe a raisin hint. Slight hop aroma deep in the background. Mouthfeel is not as strong as the look would indicate, smooth, rich and syrupy. Taste is overpoweringly coffee, roasted caramel and highly alcoholic on the back end. (Glad my bed is only one story away). Definitely a winter beer for a cold Michigan night. Malt profile really comes to life as the beer warms in the glass. Almost has a Doppelbock malt finish to it. I feel lucky to be living so near to greatness ! Excellent beer."
"Not much of any action at all on the pour. I poured agressively and got just a little hint of a light brown head. Nice dark opeque thick look but no real carbonation. Big sweet coffee, plum, raisen smell with some bitter chocolate as well. Big strong abv , black coffee, and bitter burnt caramel. The mouth is thick and flat.. I am shocked after seeing the reviews here.. but for me it is a flat, overly intense beer that really lacks balence.Dissapointing for me... Not drinkable enough to have another."
"Pours thick and black and just verges on motor oil. A deep brownish head appears and vanishes quickly leaving a simple ring-little if any lace. The absolute focus here is thickness and richness. The aromatics are strongly chocolate with a mellow hop bitter as well as definate coffee nuances. The mouthfeel is thick and gooey-very viscous and reminds me of a really rich chocolate malted in which the ice cream has melted and what is left is that syrupy mass of ultra rich, ice creamy turned liquid goodness. The flavors are over the top-again, much like an ultra premium chocolate ice cream than a beer. Try with a turtle sundae, or as an alternative lubricant for your engine of choice."
"Mad crazy props to feloniousmonk for making this possible. My second child shall be named after you, even if it's a girl."
"Viscous mouthfeel. Thick, nice low carbonation. High ABV is apparent, but enjoyable, on a small consumption scale at least. Not to be drank in mass quantities (unless you are a masochist). This is one of the best of the style without question!"
"Big thanks to Blatzman for providing me with the bottle and prompting me to give this beer another try! I simply wasn't ready for this beer when I had it a couple years ago."
"picked this up after work, but didn't see the 15 dollar price tag till i was at the counter so i went ahead and bought it. poured a deep, deep black color, no light penetration, and also no head. no head at all, but still a nice looking beer. smelled like chocolate and coffee and then tasted about the same. huge flavor that sat in my mouth for 5 or 10 seconds after each drink. however, i don't think i could drink more than one of these in a sitting due to the heaviness of the flavor. very good beer, but i don't know that it was worth 15 dollars a sixer. this was my first imperial stout so i don't know if that is the normal price."
"Dark black brown body, small and quickly disappearing head, beautiful, fruity, coffeeish, chocolately aroma, chocolate raisin first taste, thick and yet somewhat smooth mouthfeel. The slight downpoint I noticed on this was the quick builup of alcohol backtaste it was like I was drinking a port wine at the end. If you have the time and can sip it slow its a great winter stout"
"2002 edition. pours thick and black with the most *MINIMAL* head one might imagine. inverting the bottle and letting it splash into the tulip glass violently still produces nothing more than a few bubbles. great burnt chocolate roasty imperial aroma. wonderful roasted, thick, oily dark choclatey, coffe-ish flavors, except, where's the carbonation? slides down the throat too easily. can't escape the feeling like i'm drinking something flat. the flavors are there, just not held together in any coherent way. it's a damn shame. if you can get past the lack of carbonation and put yourself in the frame of mind that this is what the beer is meant to be, it becomes more enjoyable. i must admit though, i'm dissapointed. orignial overall rating of 2.45"
"Drinkability: Dissapointing. I hope this was a bad bottle, because I just spent $14.50 on a 6-pack."
"Notes, part 2: Huge thanks to fellow BA PhantomVoDoo for this one."
"i was not impressed by the first one i drank. i saved the other five for my day off. after getting over that first impression and knowing what to expect, i very much enjoyed my session with this beer."
"100th review time. I've been hanging onto this one for awhile. I drank it's five carton mates last winter, and it was all I could do to not touch this one. This bottle was from the 2001 batch. This beer/batch is also now the number one beer on my short, but growing list. This is also my first (and last?) all ""5s"" beer. It pours as black as any beer or used motor oil I've ever seen. The head, which is on the smaller side, is a dark brown (probably the darkest head I have seen). Beautiful. The nose is insanely complex: chocolate, rum, raisins, plums, alcohol, oak, soy sauce, ???. I'm getting dizzy. Taste is ahhh. Big, rich dark fruity malts start off, then chocolate caramel takes over, then smoky oakiness, and then, finally, roasted bitterness. Alcohol is there, but it doesn' feel like 11.5%. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, yet beautifully smooth. I could drink this until detox."
"This beer poured a very very dark black color and it seemed quite thick. The head was thick and dark brown. Lots of lacing on the glass as well. The aroma was full of maltiness, chocolate, and coffee. Very powerful aroma. The main part of the flavor is the thick, dark maltiness but it also has some chocolates, coffees, (a small amount of) fruits, and several other things. Quite complex taste. The mouthfeel was interesting because the flavor is so strong. It almost killed my tastebuds at first. As with most imperial stouts, this one was a bit too strong for my tastes - very well made though."
"Pours out like warm molasses, with a thin but delightfully chocolaty head. Smell is classic RIS, murky and sweet with just a touch of hoppiness. Taste is divine, espresso, raisins, malt, chocolate; it's all there. Mouthfeel is warm and inviting with a rich ground coffee finish. Dangerously drinkable; I gave it a 4 because I don't know how much further than one you can go. Absolutely delicious. I'm glad I bought a six pack of this stuff.."
"I think I got a bad bottle, it had very little carbonation in it and it had absolutely no head. However the smell and taste was excellent. It tasted of roasted coffee and raisins. Very bold and robust. The alcohol is very hidden, it's amazing at 11.5% that the alcohol can be hidden. I'm sure this would be much better if it were carbonated. I still enjoy the beer but I hope the next one is better."
"Thanks to BigHuge, you came up trumps yet again!!"
"Pours out dark as motor oil, with a thick dark brown head topped with lumps like oatmeal. The aroma comes right up to my nose - hops followed by raisin and burnt malt with distinct sweet chocolate hints. Taste is pungent. Flavor is bitter cofee and dark chocolate, with a strong alcohol finish and tingle. Chocolate and raisin lingers, as does a sting in the top of the palate, behind the nose. Mouthfeel feels a little thin for this one, and the drinkability is low due to the incredibly strong flavor. I find myself sipping this one to let the flavors come out as small amounts roll around the mouth. Excellent beer that makes its presence known."
"ng"
"Midnight black oil. No head. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and cherries. YEOW, JIP JANG JOWIE!! This is a Big full-bodied Imperial Stout. Pours and looks like engine oil. Malts are very pronounced. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee are the predominate flavors, but there are also hints of cherries, vanilla, raisins, and plums. Some smokiness as well. Hops are bitter and piney. Full, nearly oily body. Definitely a beer to take your time with and enjoy. Very smooth. Slight alcohol bite at 10%. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Jet black, opaque and flat as Lubbock, Texas. Sorry but it ain't pretty. Aroma of licorice, soy sauce, alcohol, chocolate, black coffee, and hops. Ultra-thick and full bodied, this beer is jam packed with flavors of figs, coffee, chocolate, licorice, raisins, plums, berries, soy sauce, tobacco, smoke, port, nuts, molasses, hops, and ethanol. Evokes memories of the three-course meal gum from Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory that turned Violet into a giant blueberry. The aftertaste is rich and indulgent. Lack of carbonation and ultra-complex flavor make this brew a fantastic slow port-like sipper."
"An incredible product, but only appealing every once in a while."
"edit: This year's batch is well carbonated and has a beautiful head! The flavors are even better, all BA's need to get a sixer of the 03 es."
"This brew has a very hoppy aroma and an extremely black, as in a black hole, body with no head whatsoever. It had a very strong coffee flavor. It almost burns as it goes down. Somewhat of a bitter initial taste that lingers well after is has gone down."
"I have bought this beer 3 times. There has been absolutely no carbonation. I don't think this is the way it should be. The taste has been good but I like so me carbonation."
"Acquired through trade. This brew is right up there with other great stouts like Stone IS, not better, just in the same ballpark. It pours a motor oil black...completely opaque, but with absolutely no head. Blackstrap molasses, rich malt, and chocolate dominate the smell. The flavor is intense! This is stout concentrate, professional strength. Tons of dark chocolate, coffee, heavy caramel malt and a touch of roasted barley bitterness. Viscous, syrupy mouthfeel, almost like having a liquer. Bravo!"
"Without question one of the finest stouts I've ever had the privelage to know. Outstanding aroma, sweet roasted malt with coffee overtones that remind me of Kahluha. Also reminds me of the very first Mackeson XXX I had some 10 years ago. Smooth full body and very drinkable. Seems to be at its best after sitting a little while and warms up. This is a Stout lovers wet dream!!"
"I loved the thick mouthfeel on this one, and for drinkability, I couldn't drink more than 1 at a time..."
"The first sip was amazing, perhaps breath taking. Harsh and brash like a true Italian espresso with alcohol behind the bitter coffee. Wonderful, thick, chewy. Tastes of cocoa, coffee, toasted malt sweetness, that finishes with the taste of unsweetened coffee. A truly monsterous brew. A wonderful beer. A true pleasure. I believe I have chosen wisely for my 100th review!"
"I had the Expedition Stout in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It poured a deep black with only about half a finger (if that) of reddish-tan head, which dies to almost nothing quickly. There is only a trace amount of lace left on the glass. The smell is invigorating, roasted coffee with a hint of sweetness, maybe caramel or chocolate. All of these smells are brought forth in the taste. Very heavy coffee taste with a great punch of hops. The taste really wakes you up. The mouthfeel is very strong and smooth. The drinkability is a little low due to the 10% abv. A very tasty brew though!"
"Originally rated on 4 October 2002. thick, rich, chocolatey, nice malt aroma. Has hints of soy sauce & malt. A big beer, w/ the alcohol well hidden. The malt & hops are well balanced. This is not your beginner's Imperial Stout. This is one of the top Imperials available."
"Extremely black and thick. Very heavy on the tongue, huge fat roasted malt flavours blend with raisins and spicy (hops are even a bit citric)hops, big and ugly (but ugly in kind of a good way), huge bitterness. Vinous. Not elegant at all, but nicely mean and ugly. Its great to try some US imperial stouts, and this one was another gift from Feloniousmonk."
"It is very rich and might benefit from a food or dessert accompaniment."
"Thank you, feloniousmonk for this awesome beer!"
"Poured a stygian black - no light could escape the gravitational pull of this beer black-hole. A tannish head quickly fizzed about, and then departed, thereafter the beer seemed quite lightly carbonated. Aroma was sweet and creamy, boasting of highly roasted malts. Dark roasted malt flavors packed the liquid, like strong brewed coffee, without the coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was rather disconcertingly thin, which seemed out of place against the onslaught of roasted malt. Hops in the finish vied with a rather harsh alcohol flavor for control of the finishing note, with the alcohol winning out after a hard-fought battle. Overall, the flavor profile seemed out of whack for the style - a great deal of effort had gone into crafting the beer, but the final product is one which failed to win me over."
"I have been able to drink this a few times and really like it,poures a rich black color with small brownish colored head.Smell is sweet and earthy,the taste is a complex mix of earth,chocolate,and roasted malt.When it warms a little the alcoholic notes really come thru,very true to the style.A good high quality imperial stout from my favorite brewer."
"The beer poured with almost no head at all. Very little carbonation present. Completely black. Could not see through it at all. Very good nose. Very complicated. Smells strong, too. Tastes a little tart (!) and very thick, but it leaves a pleasant aftertaste and it very drinkable."
"Overall I like it. Not what I expected but very good."
"Pours black with a thick, light brown head that leaves excellent lacing. It has a licorice aroma kind of like the Good & Plenty candies I remember as a kid. It is also roasty, chocolatey, and has a bit of an alcoholic smell. The flavor has alcohol throughout. It starts out roasty, and finishes dry, and bitter. It has a burnt roast malt bitterness in the finish. It is a full-bodied beer, with a big alcoholic warmth. A tasty brew; a good beer for warming you up on a cold winters day."
"original 3.5, 3, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5"
"Naturally, I couldn't see myself having more than (n)one of these -- at most. I have a pretty wide range of tastes for beer, but this one just didn't fit into it."
"Overall a stout with great taste characteristics but, in my humble opinion, not enough complexity to carry off the lack of carbonation and the dense syrupy body. Perhaps it needs this density to balance the 10% alcohol. Personally this stout feels a bit dead to me. Don't get me wrong I would buy it again given the chance but it would only be drunk on the coldest winter night by the fire after a great dinner."
"What an experience...again earns my highest compliment......Magic in a glass !"
"Color is a deep, deep, brownish-black with a deeper purple like tone in certain lighting and is absolutley thicker then all hell. Put it up to the light, nothing? I must have a brand new batch, cuz the super dark tan head grew fast up the edge of the glass. One of the darkest heads I've ever seen, very dark tan-chocolatey brown and it is nice and frothy with some bigger bubbles on the opposite side from which I poured it. Some large patches of tight tan lace cling forever. Eventually the head shrunk down leaving a nice settled coat of caramel colored head just on top. Overwhelming aroma of chocolate, molasses, corriander, and licorice, very warm and alcoholic in back on bigger whiffs. Has an extremely fresh quality, very lightly hinted dark roastyness and coffee. Taste is damn good, super smooth and silky, nicely coats and has a bit of sweet bitterness in the finish. Heavily roasted malt with some coffee and lots of dark chocolate in there. Some spices play underneath of nutmeg, white pepper, yeasty stuff, and corriander The feel is nera perfect for a Imp. stout, very smooth, rich, silky, bold, and heavy, hardly any carbonation really and has a nice little sweet twinge in the finish and leaves your tongue with a bit of bitterness on it. This an amazing brew and is very soothing to drink. That powerful 10% is hardly noticeable in the smell or taste, but its there. It sinks in about 3/4 of the way through. A great Imperial stout thats become one of my all time favs."
" I've gotten so wrapped up in all the different taste experiences on this expedition that I've forgotten where I'm going! Oh well, I don't mind. I'll make this a long trip, because who knows when I'll get another? But I could definitely take another one of these any time. What a great trip this is! Thanks to cretemixer for supplying the compass. This Expedition won't steer you wrong, although you may find yourself a bit lost. Lost to the world while you're enjoying the trip, and then again feeling lost when it's over, not knowing when you'll take another trip like this one again."
"514"
"The first thing that came to my mind when I poured this one wasSTP motor oil. Pours a thick, deep black color with no head what-so-ever and virtually no carbonation. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and molasses emerge from the glass. The initial taste seems to complement the aromas, but with a strong taste of alcohol that was extremely overpowering, almost medicinal. Maybe my taste buds havent progressed enough for this one. I just couldnt see myself drinking this on a regular basis. By having such high ratings, I guess I just expected more out of this one."
"This is a full night's beer. The taste overwhelms the taste buds and it has an immediate impact on the senses. I found the aroma to be on the light side initially, but very rich and caramelly. As the glass warmed the aromas strengthened and became much more pronounced. The taste is very full; again it overwhelms the senses with its complex blend of tastes that start somewhat sweet at the front, but end very bitter at the back. The aftertaste starts very bitter but begins to mellow to a bit of a tangy licorice spiciness as the bitters lighten. To call this a creamy, full-bodied beer is indeed an understatement. This is really rich stuff and not to be taken lightly. Wear a seatbelt and designate a driver before you sample this baby! Wow #2!"
"This is a very hard beer for me to rate. Why, I dont know. Maybe due to its sweetness or the alcohol punch, I couldnt drink more than 2. Maybe Im missing something but for the #2 brew at BA, I would think better."
"Thanks for feloniousmonk for yet another bottle."
"As this beauteous jet-black elixir of life sets in the glass, I just marvel at its thickness, and the miniscule chocolate brown head that dissipates into clumps of sticky lace. Nose has the aroma of bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, sweet malt, and black strap molasses, what a treat to sniff this magnificent beer. Start is cotton candy sweet, the malt thick and heavy upon the palate, the top thick as a piece of chocolate fudge, the finish delicately carbonated the hops spiteful in their spicy bite, the alcohol quite evident in the bitter dry aftertaste. 'Excellent', not meant for the weak of palate, as this is as robust as Stouts get a real 'Stout Lovers' dream, WOW! Big beer, Big ABV, I may not need to eat supper after sampling this 'MONSTER'."
"I look forward to picking up a few six packs of this every winter. It's the perfect beer to come home from work and drink while winding down. No light gets through this beer, its the thickest I've seen. Totally opaque. I usually pour it roughly so the head amounts to a little more than it normally would. It disappears none the less. The head is real chocolatey and also coffee-like. Taste follows the nose. It tastes very chocolatey at first and then you can pick up on its heavy coffee notes and maltiness. Good mouthfeel. I might try it on toast. Mmm..."
"MW"
"Initially, a shock to the palate! I couldn't believe how strong tasting this beer is. Pours like 10W 30, little head, no lace. Super malty and super hoppy at the same time. It got tastier as I went, and left me feeling no pain. Quite bitter, with some chocolate sweetness. I'm glad I got to try this (thanks, Monk). This is one of those beers that I wish I always had around, for when the mood strikes me. In the same category as Speedway and Stone in that regard. An excellent and powerful stout."
"Bottom Line: Storm King, although different, doesn’t even compare. I only wish the carbonation were a bit stronger. Now that this is meant to be available in PA, I will be buying this by the case. Make plans for your own Expedition to the Heart of Darkness. Don’t walk, run."
"F."
"Due to nearly complete lack of carbonation, there is no head whatsoever. Utterly black and opaque. Swirling releases deeply burnt malt and rich bittersweet dark chocolate notes, with buttery malt and nutty, caramelized toffee and brittle emerging late in aroma. Fruitiness is aroma is quite mild, and consists of mellow, dried date and prune notes. Quite similar to Third Coast Old Ale aromawise, but with a obviously pronounced roasted barley character. Quick waft of heaty ethanol and higher alcohols. Treacle laced sweetness bathes the palate at first, then is superceded by a drying combination of carbonaceous roasted barley and sharp, but clean hop bitterness. Malt sweetness resurfaces as hop bitterness diminishes, taking on a concomitant milk chocolate like and ripe prune character, which lend a candied, cocoa sprinkled plum impression mid palate. Full bodied, with a dextrinous mouthfeel that lacks liveliness that would otherwise be present with greater carbonation. Ghostly undertone of citric hops. Finishes slowly and long, with lingering dark chocolate and maple sap like sweetness. Wow-- Expedition Stout embodies the style. Rich, balanced, intense, yet very drinkable. My bottle was unfortunately very undercarbonated (but not flat.) If carbonation were higher, this would near perfection. A righteous thanks to feloniousmonk for sending the bottle."
"An excellent beer, pours a deep dark black thick motor oil color. Little head, but on a beer like this that is not a problem. Smells like coffee, toffee, chocolate, and caramel. A rich roasted malt experience. This beer lives up to the hype, and exceeds it."
"There's no shining a light through this one. Sweet aromas from a pitch black oily stout. Bubbles collect around the rim and an oily haze dances around on top. Alcohol is present in the breath as you breathe in your first sip, followed by a thick, heavy sweet rush. Sweet and sticky on my teeth, malty and thick on my tongue, bitter and alcoholic down my throat."
"Wow, this beer jumps out of the glass at you but fits more towards a barleywine style beer.It looks like a cup of thick cold coffee from yesterdays pot. The beer is pitch-black the alcohol knocks any head out of this pour. The legs are outstanding.It really has a nice chewiness about its body. The aroma is very complex, lots of layers of vanilla, fresh roasted coffee, candied fruits,wood and tobacco. The flavors follow the aroma pretty closely with a long roasted malt finish. Rich, definitely rich is the one word that comes back with every sip. The flavors are very concentrated with just enough hop bitterness to balance. The finish is,overall,rather dry with alcoholic warming to go along with a little residual sweetness. A nice warmer for this time of year."
"This brew pours a jet black with a nice creamy head that last a while, then reduces to a nice creamy collar leaving a very sexy lace behind. A robust coffee smell pours out of the top of the glass leaving me very excited for my first sip; which is one of great happiness, this beer is living up to everything everyone said about it. The coffee flavor and roasted malt flavors are very complex, every sip is different it seems. The malt and hops are one to cherish for the next 30 to 60 minutes. Thanks to MJR and Jeffboo for trading this wonderful beer."
"Wow! Makes me want to live in Kalamazoo. I've never even been to Kalamazoo. Nice black color, thin toffee head. Smells like burnt toast. Tastes like a fine Italian espresso. Creamy, soft finish. Nicely dry. Good at all temperatures. My first was too cold. Subsequent tastings were closer to room temperature where the beer filled out a little. This is one of the best Stouts that I have ever tasted. Very impressive."
"Beers like this remind me why Imperial Stouts are currently my favorite kind of beer. Probably the blackest beer I have poured, dark as orc blood! Minimal head really didn't surprise me because this beer did not seem like the kind to screw around with such things. It wants you to get right to the Evil. Aroma is a dark and foreboding roasty smell with some black coffee and dark chocolate. The aroma really did not prepare me for how strong this beer is. Somehow the smell does not warn you of the sinister alcohol content that waits to pounce on you the second you take your first sip. Flavors of alcohol, coffee, roasted malt and burnt wood. A truly baleful beer, this is definitely the Lord of Imperial Stouts, and will make a lesse beer cry like 7 year-old girl with a skinned knee."
"Notes: I’d say Expedition has Storm King beat when it comes to smoothness. I recommend this stout for anyone who enjoys a very smooth and warm mouthfeel instead of a more bitter and carbonated stout."
"Now I finally know what all the fuss was about (all thanks to cokes). Poured a jet black with a rich cocoa colored head. Rich smell of coffee and cocoa. Many other smells were in there but my stuffy nose could not quite identify them. Flavor is full of chocolate and coffee with a very nice sweetness. Bitterness was high but kept in check by the malts. Mouthfeel was thick and mouth-coating. Finished dry and quite bitter as the hops really show themselves. On my list of top 5 Stouts. Easily competes with Storm King and Pike XXXXX."
"10-26-03 ...I'm sipping from a bottle of a newer batch, though proper aged, some 9 1/2 months from my first reviewing, and can only agree with myself..the HUGE flavor, the enormous feeling on the palate, the never-ending finish...I would be amazed to find a better Imperial Stouts, but this is still the King..."
"Pours thick and nearly black with some ruby highlights. Small, tight brown head with nice lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark fruit dominate with alcohol in the backround. Full bodied, mouthfeel is smooth and thick. Many flavor hit you, this is a complex brew. Present are flavors of roasted and burnt grain, dark chocolate, licorice, espresso, raisin and other dark fruit, a dose of hops and alcohol. Slightly bitter, but more of a burnt type of bitterness than from hops. Sit back and sip this one, a big brew and a real belly warmer. Relax by the fire and enjoy."
"A powerhouse of a brew that will cellar well. Another great Bells product. Their best so far IMHO."
"Dark black color, pours like motor oil, sweet fruity aroma of raisons, plums and chocolate, hardly any head, a few bubbles and they are brown, huge roasty malty and fruity flavors, has a thick, full mouthfeel, leaves deep roasty flavors on my tongue, this is one hell of a stout."
"The King of Imperial Stouts in my opinion....we did a blind taste test a few years back and everything else paled in comparision..this is thick...rich...and chewy....black in color with a tinge of ruby red...no light gets through....the nose is sweet dark fruits, burnt malts, dark cocoa, and alcohol...mouthfeel is not quite as overbearingly thick as I remember...don't get me wrong because it is thick, but it is surprisingly drinkable...taste mimicks the nose. The dark cocoa and burnt malts emerge at first but as it warms it I get more of the sweet dark fruits....finishes with a dry bite...outstanding beer..among the best I've tried..."
"Although I still find this to be a fine beer, I'm altering the scores based off of a blind veritcal tasting against other Imperial Stouts. Expedition was basically middle-of-the-pack for the style, in my mind."
"My absolute favorite of the style. The shear breadth of this brew is incredible and something every beer lover should try at least once."
"This beer poured as black as oil and almost the same texture. The head was huge, bubbly and a very dark brown color, leaving some nice lace. The aroma was amazing and had many things going on. I detected chocolate, coffee, anise and other smells. The flavor was of chocolate and burnt coffee. The finish included some of the burnt aspect. This is an amazing stout and another fine addition to the Bell's line. I am just sorry that living in Ohio(next door)it took me and the state this long to get it. This one is not for the weak and definately a sipping style of beer best done in a snifter. The amazing impact it does on all sensory levels still amazes me, even the off year with no carbonation."
"By the way, if you are looking for a special treat I recently attended a beer class at Henry Ford Museum where the dessert course was an Expedition Stout Float.  They added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to Expedition Stout and it was truly a great ending to a meal.  I know it is hard to sacrifice one for an experiment but if so inclined give it a try."
"Simply stated, a triumph of the brewer's art.  IMHO this is even better than a bottle sampled from this six pack about five months ago - the fruity complexity was much greater here.  Still one bottle left, and can't wait for a cold night in front of the fireplace to try it!"
"Everything about this beer is huge. It pours truly black with a small, brown head that leaves some nice lace. The smell and taste is of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and hops. Just huge on the palate. This is easily Bell's best stout (which says a lot), but it certainly isn't one that I could drink one after another. It's just an excellent imperial stout."
"A big thanks to Deuce for the sample."
"Cheers to Deuce for the sample!"
"It didn't matter how hard I poured the beer, there was no head gonna form. This is an intensely black beer that sucks the light from the surrounding aread giving it a sort of dark halo. Light can't even pass through the edges. When you pour, you immediately pick up chocolately, coffeeish aromas before you even lean in for a sniff. Upon closer inspection a bit of caramel can be picked up. The flavor is very similiar to the smell except that it explodes on your tongue and can be overwhelming at first. Huge. It leaves the same aftertaste as dark coffee with cream. The mouthfeel is very creamy and chewy. It's a very rich, dessert-like beer."
"This beer is thick and oily.  Perhaps a bit too thick, but still incredibly smooth.  Surprisingly drinkable considering the thickness of the brew along with the high abv (something around 10% I think?).  This will certainly be one of the brews I keep around for Sunday breakfast!"
"Crikey, this poured out like dirty oil out of a crankcase! Black as night, dark yellow skim on top. Coffee and lemon aromas, very rich and inviting. Thick, thick, thick mouthfeel... Molasses, some coffee, and a dense and vaguely cherry flavor. Java at the back of the throat. Sharper and a little richer than Storm King, if a tad less flavorful and without the fruitiness. In some ways, a highly unique beer among beers. Bitter as all get out. Skoal on this one. It can come off as unidimensional, and that is something that can annoy me about some Imperial Stouts overall..."
"This is the first brew I've rated 5's across the board.  (I've reconsidered my stance of not giving all 5's after seeing somebody's opinion that all 5's mean exceptional in every category, but not necessarily the Perfect Beer, which I believe may be impossible to find.)"
"Original Rating 4/3/02: Out-freakin' standing. Wonderful beer. Dark as the darkest night, with an alcohol presence that lets you know you are going to be warmed up. Very full flavored, with malt that creeps up on you as the beer warms in the glass to the point that you sit back and say...""Wow"". Not a beer that you just open and throw back, but one in which you chill out and enjoy. Excellent."
"(2yr old bottle.) Holy shit."
