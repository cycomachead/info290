"Looks better than it tastes, but I'm not very fond of the hops."
"W/Chai spices...very interesting in a good way"

"Poured very dark black, with a two finger bubbly brown head that receded to a quarter inch thick foam, great lacing. Aroma was coffee, dark roast malt and booze. The dark roast malts really stood forward in the flavor, with some coffee, dark fruits, and of course the alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy smooth  - very nice. Overall, Stone hardly ever disappoints, and this beer is no exception."

"The after taste is harsh, though not totally unpleasant ..There are other higher end stouts that I would recommend . Completely a matter of subjective taste."
""
"Pours an amazing black with brown head but quickly downhill from there.  Smells of burnt malts and boozy alcohol that carries through the taste and finish.  Mouthful is a plus but overall seems like maybe some age is a good idea.  The burnt flavor and smell is all too powerful and dampers what seems like an otherwise pleasurable experience."

"I only sampled 4oz of this when I was in CA, but I absolutely loved it. It might be my favorite Russian Imperial. I've been trying to get my hands on a full bomber of this so I can give in a review with a proper amount of beer, but I haven't been able to find one in MI."
"Just picked up three bottles today of the 2014 release, super surprised to find it at the beer store. I hear the 2015 release comes out tomorrow. Went home chilled two bottles and put one in the cellar. I get a lot of chocolate its kind of nice. Sipping on a glass of it right now, well watching March Madness, what could be better?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.75 - This is a damned fine imperial Russian stout. Probably the most balanced I've ever had and one of the best in general. Reminds me A LOT of Oskar Blue's Ten Fidy. Is it the best ever? No. Is it worth buying, stocking up on and cellaring? Hell yes. This is a stout lover's dream beer and I HIGHLY recommend it to fans of the style."

"Draft.  A very pretty beer, close to black with a nice tan head.  Dark chocolate ruled smell and taste with underlying coffee and roasted malts.  Not much fruit.  Slight bitterness.  At 11% the alcohol makes itself known, but okay.  Not as thick or creamy as expected or hoping.  A good beer but some creaminess and smoothing out would definitely kick it up a notch for my taste."
""
"Awesome beer. Has a thinner body than I expected for an imperial stout. Smells of molasses, balsamic vinegar, caramel, coffee and dark chocolate. Taste tones same as smell, sweet start with acidic middle and bitter roasted malt coffee flavor finish. Would definitely try again. Alcohol warmth is low for an 11% beer. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking IRS and a big winner from Stone!"
""
""
"I am not sure if the years have really added to the taste. Still a good beer but a bit rough around the edges. It could use more fruit or delicacy to balance out the heat and harshness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 release poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Espresso crema-colored head suck around for the entire session. Alcohol and malt on the nose. Taste again is booze forward, but quickly yields to macerated fruits, mild tobacco, and chocolate chip cookie. Mouthfeel wasn't as heavy or viscous as expected... Undecided as to whether that's a good thing or not. Excellent stout but not as 'turned up' as I had hoped. Maybe some extended aging would change the profile? Will try again."

"Stone russian imperial stout 2014 release. Consumed 1-22-15. Look is black with a dark tan head. First taste comes black licorice, anise and a little chocolate. After 3-4 sips the palate is coated with fuzz, tends to hide the first taste flavors. All in all a good brew. Sweet tasting after the first sips and the alcohol burn isn't there. Great stout by a great brewery. Stone should do a collaboration with valiant or black market. Or do a triple collaboration with those two. Amazing what collaborations do to an already fantastic stout. Two thumbs up."
""
""
"Loved everything about this beer, the roasted malts were perfect for me, the hint of chocolate was great."
""
""
"Pitch black, brown head.  Alcohol, roasty malt nose.  Taste is boozey, burnt, chocolate, some caramel sweetness coming through.  Feels very thick with a little carbonation.  Overall, this is in your face and intense.  Makes Guinness look like Bud.  It can't possibly get much bigger and blacker than this?"
""

"Just incredible.  Sad that they don't produce the expresso imperial stout anymore."
""
""
"Awesome licorice darkness in a super drinkable imp. stout. I love this stuff!"
"I've had this beer twice: once fresh, and a second time aged 7 months. Pours like tar from the bottle, so you get this ridiculously thick, BLACK liqiuid with a brown head stubborn to form due to the thickness and low carbonation. Smells of dark fruit, burnt coffee, chocolate, and, to my nose, a subtle peanut butter note. The fresh beer had this prominent black coffee taste with a licorice note elevated by a pleasantly hearty booze note. Aged seven months, there's a little more malt and the booze calms down a bit. The mouthfeel is fat and full, as should be expected from this style since it flows like syrup (or beerup as my friend jokingly calls it). Overall, I'm really enjoy this beer. I rated it strongly because I generally don't like hot beer but the warmth of this ale just helps it taste better. I plan on doing another review after aging another bottle for MUCH longer."

"Did a vertical tasting last night, 2010-2014. All good, but nothing overly great. Aged decently."

"Decent beer but aftertaste kills this beer for me. burnt Smokey flavor.  Narwal much better."
""
"O - Very solid.  (The 7300 ratings before me prove that.)"
"2009 release consumed in 2014, fresh 2014 wasn't as good but have a couple aging. Sorry this is hardly a review, more of me just indicating which one I'm rating. It was delicious though, real smooth, could hardly taste the alcohol. After 5 years it lacked a lot of the burn you taste in the '14. If I could find more I'd buy em up, bought the last one in the fridge at Stone Brewing World Bistro for $11.99 some months back."

"Best RIS I've had to date..absolutely awesome. BIG coffee and chocolate aromas and on the palate. A lot less bitter than I was expecting, very smooth and alcohol is very suppressed. Even at the edges of the glass this beer is pitch black. I'm going to go back to the totalwine and pick up a case..it's that good."

"Overall - would love if Stone offered this in a 12 oz bottle in a 6 or 4 pack or as apart of the mixed 12. The price is definitely reasonable, but if this would go the way of Sublimely...I'd consider this a must have."

"Potent Russian Stout.  Pours to a full 2 fingers of head.  Dark chocolate color.  Traditional stout aromas of coffee and chocolate.  Big and creamy in the mouth.  Smooth and thick going down.  Very tasty.  A 750ml bottle resulted in a nice mild buzz."

"Jet black pour, with a small amount of tan head that left a minimum amount of lacing. At first all I got was coffee in the taste and aroma, but after letting it sit awhile a bunch of great chocolate, vanilla, oak, and caramel flavors all came whirling together in beautiful unison. Perfect mouthfeel for the style, rich and decadent. I waited awhile to try this and realized I will buy it more often."
""
""
""
""
"Pristine. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, nougat, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, grape, orange, grapefruit, wood, oats, cocoa, etc. mixed to near perfection. As balanced as balanced gets. Silky and viscous."

"Simply said this is what I like about trying different beers, once in a while you get to drink a beer that states the style without having overbearing qualities. And having said that this beer does just that, it has all the qualities of a Imperial Russian Stout and yet I can not discern any particular aspect that carries the beer, nothing overdone or overbearing----just a gosh darn tasty stout."
""
""
""
"Excellent interpretation of an Imperial Russian Stout.  Nice and thick with full body and the 11%ABV really kicks you!"
""
""
"Very good beer but disappointing, given some of the reviews here. From CA, I would take Old Rasputin any day. Nationally, give me KBS from Founders or Bourbon County from Goose Island. Still, a solid interpretation of a challenging style that is getting reduced too much in the U.S. right now to obviously big flavors and alcoholic contents which do not always behoove the style. Frankly, this is another example that tells me Stone is a very good brewery, but not a great one (despite the hype)."

"O - As with most beers of this style, it gets better with age.  I thought the fresh bottle was okay, but many of the components were harsh (hops, chocolate, alcohol).  It comes together nicely and will probably be even better at the next 6 month interval.  Prost!"

"Pours a dark beer. Forms little foam. Nose reveals roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is hindered by the alcohol level. Drinking this imperial feels like drinking vodka. If you like that, rate it favorably. I don't. On the good side, after letting it sit for a day, the alcohol dissipates and this beer is much more enjoyable, although not great. Body is a bit thin."

"Pour into a Pint glass from a 22oz bottle, pitch black pour with a fluffy tan head that turned into some very solid lace that hung on the glass from start to finish. Aroma held vanilla and alcohol notes with some roasted malts trying to peek out...they remained covered until the first taste. The taste is bitter/roasted coffee and malts with the alcohol present but not over powering, deep roasted flavors and some wood hints show up as the tasting goes on. The mouthfeel is so dead on for the style, thick/heavy on the tongue while leaving a nice roasted mild coffee/roasted flavor at the end. Overall I'm very impressed with this offering, I love RIS as a whole and I've had a lot of Stones products...this is a winner and I will pick it up when I can."

"Flavor: Sweet malty, fruity entry. Oaky sweetness and warmth, dark fruits-prunes, dark chocolate, dark roasty malts, hints of coffee, slight ashy/acrid (near finish), comes to drying finish. Minimal alcohol detected on the finish, spiciness on finish as well. Finishing bitterness (and earthiness) of hops and chocolate intertwined. High drinkability. Nice grainy, cereal finish as the beer warms. All of this is in a nice harmonious balance. You have to try this vintage (2014), a great beer!"
""
"Overall- Very good, but not enough to challenge the undisputed king (IMO) Old Rasputin. Still a good deal on bombers and a nice change of pace beer. It's really a shame that it gets release in April and not sometime during the fall."

"O- A simple, yet well stated beer, I am confident the czar's from Russia would most have certainly approved of Stone's efforts. It is always nice to see Stone's IRS hit the shelves, yet the (odd year) varieties and W00tstout seem to eclipse the standard version. I've had this beer both fresh and aged (~2 years) and prefer it fresh since the fruity aromatics, subdued licorice/anise flavor and well-defined bitterness are more apparent when young. (4.75)"

"This is what a stout should be all about.So many flavors in this stout blended together to make a true masterpiece.Kind of a creamy feel to it.This is indeed a heavy hitter.At 10.6 ABV it will get the job done.Just make sure you have a designated driver if your going to be getting into these bad boys.Love slamming this beer out on the Porch while i`m listening to a little Motley Crue.Too date this is the best Stout I have ever tasted.No B.S,try it."

"Despite being down on Stone and finding many of their beers disappointing (all relevant, disappointing due to expectations and hype), picked this one up on the recommendation of my beer guru. For once, they did not let me down. Outstanding look and appearance, tasty and enjoyable and not to much punch despite the ABV. I enjoyed this one very much, while there are other Imperial Stouts I prefer, this one gets great grades due to cost and ability to deliver the ABV. I will probably buy a couple more and cellar (stash in the basement, but cellar sounds better) to share with others who say they like stouts. Closest thing to a go to for me from Stone (yea, I know everyone is shaking their heads to that comment)"

"This is the 2014 release. Pours a very deep brown, with a slight off-white head that doesn't tarry, though there is some lacing. The scent is vanilla bean and espresso, quite strong. Hints of a dark, fruity chocolate. The taste is rather faithful to the scent, with a bitter finish. It's got a nice full body, easy to roll around in the mouth and enjoy in a voluptuous sort of way :). An enjoyable stout. I'm having this 3 months after its bottling date, but I think I'll take a cue from other reviewers in saying that it would be interesting if aged longer."

"Overall one of my favorite offerings from Stone as well as RIS' in general."
"(2014 release) Pours a viscous oil with a small, cappuccino-hued head. Aroma somewhat sweetly syrupy and roasty. Super-rich flavor, bold roastiness, chocolatey and sweet. A bit bitter and hoppy, definitely a young beer. Hot and boozy and finish. I don't cellar, but I feel this beer would benefit with age."

"Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. I finished the whole bottle myself over an hour and it sneaks up on you, taps you on the shoulder, and then introduces you to a whole Soviet armored division, Baba Yaga, and a bunch of other Russian traditions. Definitely a beer for a weekend or an evening when you have no other responsibilities. Alcohol is very well hidden but I definitely could notice it by the end of the first glass. That being said, this beer pairs very well with food. It has a stand-alone flavor that isn't overpowering, and doesn't linger forever on the palate. It went very well with salad, mashed potatoes, and sausage. I think it would pair well with a wide range of meats and a wide range of other foods as well. Overall an amazing beer, and I may have to start picking this one up every year when it comes out. I've had several people tell me to cellar a bottle or two so I may have to start doing that as well. Definitely a beer to celebrate."

"Overall i was expecting more from this brew. All of stones brews are top notch, and so is this one. But i feel at $8.99 a 22oz it's just not worth it. I would rather have a 4 pk of founders imperial stout at $11.99. Overall they are about the same in quality and ABV, Founders being a tad better and a much better value. If they offered this at $4-5.99 comparative to Arrogant bastard it would be a deal."

"O-I let this warm up this year and that was a great move it taste much better and had many aromas and flavors coming out that I did not notice last year. See you in 2015"

"O - I'd love to taste this coming out of a barrel, yet this is still a great non-ba imperial stout. Very easy-drinking. 11% is very nicely hidden and the beer comes together really nicely. I feel like this would make an awesome base beer from which to do interesting variants. Good stuff."

"This is an excellent imperial stout. It's not quite on-par with some others out there, but this one is also a little bit lower in price as well. Most definitely buy this beer if you're a fan of the style, but certainly drink it at its recommended temperature of about 55 degrees."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2011 vintage, bottled in Spring 2011. Pours Dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malts with moderate earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength and some slight booziness. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, raisin, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal/roasted bitterness after the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate earthy yeast flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish, Overall this is outstanding imperial stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Conlusion: A fantastic beer with a complex body that wants to be investigated!"

""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A real winner from Stone, for all their hoppy fame, this beer definitely holds its own. The 2 years of aging has definitely helped this one tremendously, the roast is subtle and layered that brings out so many interesting flavors, licorice and tobacco as well as stone fruit. I'm glad I've got another 2012 vintage to open in another year or two."

""

"M: very good only reason not a higher score is it seems kinda sticky, the carbonation is perfect though"

"Comes out jet black with a finger of brown head that slowly dissipates. Alcohol legs are on full display. On the nose I get roasted grains that lend a coffee aroma, plus charred wood, smoked meat, earthy hops, and some alcohol. The taste has a creamy chocolate quality with black currants, coffee, more of those earthy hops, and an astringent taste from the roasted grains. It feels quite full-bodied in the mouth and goes down velvety."
""
""
"Got this on tap at the stone brewpub in the San Diego airport since I didn't have time to make it out to the brewery during my trip. Had it for breakfast with the duck confit eggs. Practically perfect stout for me. Licorice aroma, jet black color, nice crisp mouthfeel. Just a great clean stout. Will definitely look for it again."

"A very good RIS full of flavor and depth. The smell was complex yet rather subdued and was the only weakness overall. Hop bitterness builds up nicely and lingers through the end. But it's the bold roasted grain flavors that tell the real story: big toasted malt flavors with a mild sugary sweetness and bitter chocolate tones. The ABV makes its presence known, too, but is well-blended with the malt and hop elements to make an overall harmonious marriage of taste and feel. Complexity and depth with a fairly easy drinking quality for such a heavy and high ABV ale make this stout a winner."
"Excellent, but mostly one-dimensional, imperial stout. It smacks you in the face with gobs of roasted barley, never hides its allegiance, and pulls it off in a very tasty package."
""
""
"O - In case the brand and the name weren't warning enough, this stout isn't one to be taken lightly. Best used as a dessert compliment rather than solo."

"The standout quality of this beer is the mouthfeel: dense and creamy. When I'm drinking an RIS I want it to feel like I'm gulping down motor oil. This is beautiful sludge. The taste is outstanding, with a blend of coffee, a bit of chocolate and a lot of roastiness, maybe just a bit too much roastiness for me. I've been on an RIS kick lately and this is at the top of the heap, but not quite up to Plead the Fifth or Expedition. Still, an excellent beer at a good price."
""
""
""
"Glad I was able to find one at the local craft beer store. 1 of 3 left! And damn good, for a Russian stout it was everything I hoped it would be. If only I bought 2 and let one age for a month or two, if I could've kept my hands off it!"

"Overall: I highly recommend this as a class A stout, this is one to enjoy and I will again. At 11% ABV it is surprisingly smooth and not noticeable. Get some you wont be sorry."
"Spring 2014 Release. Pours a pitch black, midnight color. Fantastic mocha-colored foamy head which settles with some lacing. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes of toffee, chocolate, and some roasted coffee. Creamy smooth brew that is very easy to drink and the ABV is wonderfully hidden. Stone has produced an excellent Russian Imperial Stout here that I found highly enjoyable and all expectations were met. Overall this is a stout that I would absolutely recommend to all!"

"Pours a very viscous jet black oilish look, very similar to used oil out of my 6.1 liter Hemi after 4,000 miles. Smell is plenty of coffee and roast and some dark chocolate but everything seems to be quite muddled together. Taste is good, but i feel like this brew needs some time in the cellar to reach peak performance. Check back 365 days from today for a solid re-review."
""
"This is not the most ""authentic"" variation of an RIS that I've had, given the presence of unique hops. For that reason alone I could not give 5's straight across the ratings. However, I will dare to say that this specific mix of hops might just be the last ingredient that such an ale has missed in other brews, for me. It makes for a powerhouse ale, which is dynamic and full bodied. So what we have here is an Americanized RIS. I have probably enjoyed no less than 20 or 30 Imperial Stouts, and I have to say that this is, despite the unique variation, the best I have had."

"Overall - A good beer but I was expecting more based on the high overall score. The chocolate is a little like herseys syrup, and it has quite a bit of burnt/anise like bitterness. Like I said, still good, just not amazing."
""
"Bot this in a 4 pk at Costco. The price of all 4 was worth it for just this one. Dark, dark beer. Got better with each pour from bottle. Smooooth! Got better as it got a little warmer. Drank it while eating smoked salmon. Perfect! Wish that the whole 4 pack was just the stout."

"I just opened a 2010 vintage and I must confirm that the years have been kind to this beauty. It is every bit as smooth as the later version. Like liquid velvet. I will say that the coffee flavor seems more subtle here with some hints of anise becoming slightly more dominant. I'd rate this vintage somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.5. World class, indeed."
""
""
"O: This beer is a miniature tragedy. So good, up to the finish which is really unpleasant. I could just drink faster, so as to experience more taste and less aftertaste, but that's probably a poor choice with a 10.5% beer. So, I'm torn. Half of the time I like this beer, half of the time I dislike it. Unfortunate. (3)"
"O- A great beer that I was sitting on for a year wish I would of bought more of this 2013 version."
""
"O- The highlight is the mouth with the thick and syrupy textures, the smell is lacking and the taste I would put a ok / average. The alcohol is not hidden and starts from start to finish. Worth trying but wont spend much to keep it on my shelfs."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Probably one of the best deals out there in terms of Russian Imperial Stouts in bombers at $6.99. Founders Imperial Stout is a better beer and a better value, but for our friends in California who don't get Founders or Dark Horse, this is an excellent and overlooked option."

"2014 bottle. First non-vintage I've had. Poured from a bottle into a short wine glass. Thick brown head and dark brown body. Smells like dark chocolate, coffee, and has some hints of toffee and nuts. Taste follows nose for the most part. A good amount of bitterness as well. Mouthfeel isn't too thick. Actually on the thin side for an RIS. Overall a very impressive RIS. Up there with the likes of Ten Fidy I'd say."
""
"A classic in its own right. Delicious roasted malt, coffee, chocolate make this a rich and decadent treat. Easy to drink a bomber by oneself. In the crowd of RIS ales, this one still holds its own."
""
"O: Pure RIS goodness here. No barrels, no flavor infusions, and yet still a ton of flavor. One of the best ""base"" Imperial stouts on the market."
"Typing in useless characters to meet the required minimum is also frowned upon."
""
"Classic 2013 release. Poured from a 22oz. bottle. Smell is black liquorice, dark chocolate, hints of roasted coffee, even soy sauce.  Taste is malty up front. Lots of roasted flavors going on. It finishes with a very slight alcohol burn that lingers for quite some time. Not in a bad way.  It's amazing how smooth it finishes for what it is. As the beer warms I almost pick up hints of peanut butter on the finish.  Mouthfeel is perfect for the brew. This is a must try. It was the #1 beer in the world for some time. If you ever come across it I highly recommend giving it a try"

"O-One is not a beer drinker until they hit Stone's Imperial Stout. A great gateway for novices in the style. A nice throwback/personal favorite for seasoned vets. The ABV is well concealed. You get buzzed without tasting the booze. This didn't blow me away, but didn't disappoint. I would rather drink North Coast-Old Rasputin. Shameless plug but still. This is a great beer! Beautiful texture and aromatic wonders. Wish the taste was more exciting. Stone will remain a top five brewery in America though. They deliver on any and every style easily."

"Serving type: bottle"
"O - 4.0 - After a previous really big stout, I was expecting the same from this based on what I'd heard, but this one is milder. Still it's really good. The balance is such that nothing sticks out. That makes it more subtle than blasty. Often I want something more robust, something harsher, but it's good to know this milder one is there too."

"Pours inky black with thick mocha head. This stout is a black hole of a beer, light cannot permeate it. The head sticks around for a while with some great lacing. So many aromas waft from the tulip - dark roast coffee, caramel, dried fruit, anise, soy sauce, and so much more. Extremely complex.  Nice sweetness hits the palate first - molasses, fig, vanilla, chocolate. Bitterness on the back end with lots of coffee, bitter chocolate and toasted coconut. Full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a textbook example of Russian Imperial stout, very well crafted, very balanced and super smooth, it's like drinking silk."

"Damn fine RIS! One of my faves I love holding onto for a year, at least. If you haven't tried it- what ya waiting for? Truly a classic."
""
""
"Tastes follows the smell, but now I get the roasted notes, some bitterness, but the chocolate presence i recall upon prior annual releases of this seemed to involve more chocolate, where here there seems a focus on a sour-dark fruit/ coffee basis. Malty. A thick, sticky yet smooth-sipping beast of an RIS. Burn. Feels good like that. Maybe my prior sampling had more age. Maybe this beer is even greater with a year or several on it. I know I've had it in the past and it blew me away. Oh well. Still among my top 5 RI stouts, and Im glad to have a bottle each of this brew (beginning with 2010's) in the ""cellar"" for aging to find out."

The label says bottled on 3/15/2013, so I was surprised to see this at a liquor store. I don't know if that would make a difference but I thought I would mention the date. I don't think I would buy this again though. But worth the try!"

"O: a perfect stout. A bit pricy but then again not an everyday session beer either. If you like stout treat yourself once to this beauty!!!"
""
""
""
"Big baker's chocolate, roast, and earthy bitterness mellowed out with some subtle burnt sugars. A very good imperial stout. Something I am currently building a vertical of since I imagine this ages very well."
""
""
""
"When I rated this the first time I didn't like it as much so I I got myself another bottle. I have to say that this one is fresher than the last and I like it much more. The mouthfeel is creamy and not too oily this time. The fruit stays up and bright this time to lend an all around sweetness and bright flavor to the darker heavier aspects. The nutty flavor intensifies as it warms and suddenly I am begining to change my mind. What kept it from a higher score in taste and smell is that pesky alcohol. Glad I tried it again."
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent stout. I was worried about it living up to expectation, but Stone has delivered here. And at the price you can get it for, IRS has to be one of the best values out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good. One of the better straight RIS that I've had. Aged about a year, not sure how much that changed the flavor. So I'll have to look to pick up a fresh on but 1 year old its delicious."

"On first taste: WOW.... a stout for sure, it is...deep, complex, roasted, malty, and a bite of hops on the pre-end..then the abv washes over you. Imperial for sure...this brew is not for the everyone. There were times when i felt like I was drinking with Omega-Red himself, hearing stories of mother russia and how one day captain america will fall(sorry, comic book joke..but true ;) )...Stone has set the bar with this RIS. I will be getting another....just not tonight...lol."

"O- great taste and smell. The only thing I would change about this beer is to make it a little thicker. It would be a top tier beer with just a little more viscosity."
""
"This review is of a bottle I cellared for a year: The IRS poured an opaque black with a slight tan head. The aroma held notes of molasses, dark chocolate, roasted malt with a slight hint of licorice and dark fruits. The taste followed suit with a strong note of molasses, dark chocolate and dark fruits. Obviously there was a lot going on in this brew and it deserves the strong reputation. The fantastic flavors only expanded as it warmed. A full and rich bodied beer that was a pleasure to consume."
""
""
""
""
"A: Thin layer of espresso like head, pitch black to brown in color, visible viscosity – 4.50, S: Strong aromas of molasses and caramelized brown sugar, lots of figs and candied dates along with fruitcake, there is also a good deal of dark coffee and slight charred grain – 4.50, Tons of prunes, chocolate and espresso, mild shot of ash, there’s a dark fruit sweetness, some citrusy hops are present but are overpowered by the malt, alcohol is noticeable but not distracting and actually provides a smooth warming, intense flavors all around – 4.50, M: Very heavy body with a thick creaminess – 4.50, D: An exceptional Russian Imperial Stout and strong representation of the style, big beer all around – 4.25"

"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good beer and a very good example of the style, Founders Imperial Stout it still my favorite, but this beer isn't too far behind it and had all the aspects that I look for in the style. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, medium warming and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this isn't the kind of beer that I would drink multiple bottles of but I wouldn't mind having a bomber to myself and I think it's pretty drinkable for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, this is a textbook RIS and nothing about it is out of place for the style. What I like the least about this beer was how warming the alcohol was, it wasn't overwhelming but I wish it was toned down just a little. I would buy this beer again, I think it's priced nicely and it's dead on for the style, i'm glad I bought a couple bottles to cellar, I might have to grab a couple more and I will for sure be buying some when it's released next year, I think this also has the potential to age well. All in all i was pretty happy with this beer, I had heard it was good and it didn't disappoint, it was a great straight forward RIS that I really enjoyed drinking and while it's not my favorite it is up there as one of the better RIS I have had. Good job guys, this is one great stout."
"O: A complete homerun of a stout. I don't think there is a better staple beer than this one. God damn Stone is good at making beautiful exquisite go-to beers that are just always there when you need them. Like the perfect marriage."
""
""
""
""
"Stone Espresso IRS was significantly better, probably the best IRS I've had. The head sticks around for longer and leaves a nicer lacing on the glass, while basically the same color, and it looks creamier. The smell is creamier and hides the alcohol better. The taste has vanilla and creamy milk flavors in it that I just don't taste as much with the original. I said yesterday that the Stone Espresso IRS drinks like a chocolate milkshake in beer form, and the original is a little less thick. Overall, for 50 cents more a bomber I'd go with the Stone Espresso IRS, it's just better. I'll have to snag a case of it and cellar for later!"

"O - This beer is better than it needs to be for 8.50 a bomber. It is a treat that is luckily easy to find in my area. I live in a small town and I find bottles two years old sometimes tucked away in the back of poorly operated stores. I have a few tucked away. Aging doesn't exactly improve this beer for me but it doesn't hurt it either. I will accept this beer anyway on any day."

"O - This is probably one of the best beers I have ever had. It is so complex however extremely smooth and drinkable. Almost no alcohol is present and this is a fresh bottle. Awesome job Stone!"
""
""
""
"If Duvel had a stout sister, Stone Imperial would definitely be that sister. It's surprisingly smooth, but Hulk-strong. Bitter, yet not enough to prevent you from enjoying it. What a wonderful brew. Certainly something you might want to consider sharing with your friends over some sweet chocolate dessert. Fantastic."

"This imperial stout's characteristics are in total harmony. It has achieved zen enlightenment."
""
""
""
"Beer's body is heavy, with mid-level carbonation that creates a thick and slightly foamy mouthfeel. Alcohol burn noticeable from mid-palate onwards, particularly in nostrils and throat. Finish is dry, with heavy stickiness around the palate."

In northern New York this beer is not located at every store, but Bark's beer shack seems to keep a wide selection of Stone's on tap. I would highly recommend this beer for anyone who likes a full flavor beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had tried this early on in my craft beer adventure. It was a current vintage, and I remember it being bold, rich, and super thick. Either my palate has expanded or a year of aging mellows it quite a bit, because this beer can go tooth and nail with any other RIS I’ve tried."

""
""
"Overall: This is firggin' good beer, I have had it before and has been at least a year since the last time I seen it out here in Long Island. Easily one of the best Russian Imperials Stouts that I have had and the one that i will keep having. Salud!"

"O - A delicious IRS, and it certainly deserves the acclaim it gets. Lot's of stuff going on in this one, all the normal stout flavors, with my palete noticing some fruit and pepper. Interesting and unexpected. But in a good way. Certainly a sipping beer not for the faint of heart. Thick as heck, and won't be liked by most. A beer that I don't see myself buying a lot, as I prefer to drink stouts on occassion rather than frequently, but this is an amazing beer. Highly recommended!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent for this style. It has all the flavors and qualities that one should expect from a Russian Imperial. The 10.6 abv is respectable and appreciated (not by my wife I should add). This is a sipper that should be savored and enjoyed. Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the best standard Russian Imperial Stouts out there. Nothing unique or crazy or out there about this beer but Stone executes it with such quality and attention to detail that it stands right near the top of all Russian Imperial Stouts and is just an excellent beer"
"Overall, this is a great russian Imperial stouts. I would have to say that it tastes very similar to the Espresso Imperial Russian Stout, except this one doesn't include the espresso bomb flavor that the other has. This is a stripped down version of its Espresso counterpart. This is as very smooth Russian Imperial stout. It goes down easy, and one can't taste the alcohol."

"O: Pretty much everything I want in a RIS just packed full or roast, chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, hops bitterness and some hops flavor while fresh. A rock solid beer that has has a lot going on while maintaining a lot of balance. Not really sure what more I could want that doesn't fit in the glass."

"Pours out black with a milk chocolate head. Thick head at first, but then chills out to a thin cap. Smells very roasty and sweet with some dark chocolate. A good bit of booze is apparent. Roast isn't overwhelming in the flavor. I get a good bit of sweet, bready malts that stand out. Nice bit of chocolate and coffee as well. A little citrus rind from the hops. Alcohol is a little strong in the finish, but doesn't get medicinal. Mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, full, rich, smooth, with just a touch of prickly carbonation. Overall this is pretty awesome. It would be stellar with a few months to a year+ on it. WAY more drinkable fresh than some other Stone high abv releases. Can't wait to try this around Thanksgiving/Christmas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic example of a Russian Imperial Stout. It's so flavorful and balanced yet offers something you can't really find in other RIS's. It's hard to explain but this is that one beer you need to try if you like the style. Not for the newcomer for sure, but definitely for someone wanting to explore the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: Really a solid beer. For its price, it's definitely very good in its style. Not sure if I could recommend it over Old Rasputin, which is comparably affordable (even cheaper) and has the advantage of coming in 12oz bottles. The flavors are different between the two beers, for sure, but I'm not sure one is necessarily better than the other. Stone's IRS is certainly more complex. Very impressed with this... I'll be excited to see how it is doing in a year or two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best RIS, I'm curious to see how it ages a few years from now. Needless to say, I will be picking this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fans of chocolaty stouts have to love this one. Sweet, but really dry on the finish surprisingly. The roast is kept pretty low and the fruit is maybe a tic below medium. Enough hops on the finish to barely be noticeable, and the mouthfeel is rich without being chewy. For something that has been around since 2002, it has really stood the test of time with flying colors. It may not be the best stout I have ever had...but for the availability, consistency and price - it is tough to beat in my book."
""
""
""
"A heavy, dark and rich beer with initial bitter bite. Leaves a roasted coffee to chocolate flavor after which is quite pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"All in all, I'd prefer to have discovered a little more complexity in this beer, but even so, the anise is not as off-putting as some reviews lead me to believe. However, if you aren't into the licorice stouts, this is not going to be up your alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice. One of my favorite stouts. I think I prefer this to the espresso version, but want to drink another of each before reaching final conclusion."
"O- This is one fine RIS. You just gotta have it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: A bit thin at this point in it's aging. Like other reviewers have noted, it will likely settle a bit as it ages."

"Overall: I am enjoying this beer ... a lot! The Espresso version of this beer is a little better, to me, as it adds the coffee in a subtle manner without going over the top. However, if you don't want any coffee flavor this beer is so subtle, balanced, and tasty, with the perfect mouthfeel for the style. Would buy again it again in a heartbeat, and is a great value for the bomber."

"O: What can I say, Stone's IRS has always been one of my favorite imperial stouts, and will continue to be. Of course it is an amazing beer after some age, but I personally enjoy it fresh just as much. This beer has a great kick of heat at the beginning with a satisfying smooth & clean finish. Definitely a world class stout."
"Not great but a well crafted beer if you dig the oak flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very well done with a few minor complaints. Love the complexity in both aroma and flavor but could use some more balance. Also, seems to get more hoppy and bitter as it warms which opposed the expectation for the style. Still a well crafted and intriguing imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fairly classic Russian Imperial Stout, not overly complex and definetly not lacking. I am glad I have a few more bottles of this in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A tough beer to digest at first - but one that rewards its drinker with good complexity and a breadth of flavor storytelling. It isn't immensely drinkable, but then again, something like this should be savored slowly. Given its price point, it's one I can heartily recommend."
""
"Overall: Very good Russian Imperial Stout. A well executed example of the style. Fairly easy to find during its annual release if Stone beers are available in your area. At $8 per bomber (locally), it's definitely recommended to try."

"O-This is a great and classic-tasting RIS. The flavors are intense, but well-balanced, and everything seems to work well together. There is no standout characteristic to throw the equilibrium of this beer out of whack. On the other hand, in today's world of ""brett-this"" and ""barrel-aged that," I almost feel like something is missing here."
""
""
""
""
""
"this one would be in my regular rotation without doubt, about what one should expect from a big stout this one hits the spot"
""
""
""
""
"Overall-this thing brings the heat. All of the typical RIS notes are here and this holds up with some of the best of them. Although I wouldn't consider this a world class stout, it's on the edge of WC. 4.25"
""
""
"O- This was a great standard RIS, but that's what it is, standard. I feel that a variation, such as a Vanilla BA version would make this one of my top three favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorite stouts, too bad it's so hard to find for me. Very chocolatey, and it's jsut so balanced you don't taste any alcohol. Got my hands on 2 of these and two espressos. This wold be my first choice to convert a non-stout person into a stout lover. Another amazing brew by Stone, never disappointed."
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a great RIS, hi IBUs and just plain brash. I will certainly seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
"overall: It's a little hot, probably needs a little more time to balance out. Still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Okay so this review is officially incomplete I need to try a non fresh version of this beer because it seems like it would develop really well but as of right now it is a decent stout that hides its high abv and is very drinkable, but it is not the big imperial stout I expected it to be. So I will be back soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Unlike most other Imperial Stouts I've tried this one has a hop character that really comes through. The hops are not simply there to balance out an abundance of malt. This makes for a pleasant and more easy-drinking stout...at least if you're a hop head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my current favorite stout, with the exception of Peche Mortel. It's is a very unique R.I.S. it doesn't have that Licorice and leather thing going on; but it more then makes up for it with a creamy caramel, dark chocolate and espresso combo. I hope this sticks around ""these parts"" for a while."

"Fantastic thick oily black look to this one, topped with a nice fluffy tan head. There is proper lacing going on later as I drink the beer down. As for the aroma, I am primarily enjoying dark fruit esters such as raisin & fig. The taste is smooth and sublime... very balanced between the dominant aforementioned dark fruits, molasses, toasted malt, and even a faint hopped flavor that edges its way in. The mouth feel and alcohol heat are just right, not too heavy like you may assume. Pleasantly dry finish that leaves you thirsting for more... Overall a practically perfect RIS!"
"Excellent combination of roast character and fruity esters. Just enough sweetness to counter the roast dryness. A bit alcoholic, but delicious."
""
""
""

""

"The taste is vibrant with mouth coating dark malts, sweetness, and a mild lingering hop bitterness. But smooth. The 10%+ alcohol is well-integrated into this beer yet it brings on a definite light-headedness if drunk too quickly. This is a fine Imperial Stout and could easily be on my Top 10 favorite beers list."
"Truly a Czar of beers. Pours like black Siberian crude. Leaves all other stones turned. A royalty that puts even Mr. Smith on the defensive. This beer has the power to command your attention. Afore all to God in Heaven - Hail! And to our Czar on earth - Hail!"

"Overall, a very worthy beer for a celebration. The question is, am I worthy enough to fully appreciate how well crafted this beer is? Stone, thank you. Thank you for providing me with 2 of the 5 beers that I brought with me to live in the southern continent! Thankfully I have 5 more waiting for me when I return, patiently waiting to be savored over the next few years. I'm anxious to see how the hops hold up with age, and to see how the darker flavors come to the fore. As close to perfect as can be at the age of just under one year. Well done!"

"Pours a deep black with a two finger thickness head that lingers. Smells a delicious combination of coffee, molasses, and malts. Leaves a ton of lacing. Taste similar to smell, but with a great boozy taste. Heavy and excellent. Years ago when first entering craft beers I stumbled upon this, it became and instant favorite."

"Flavor is huge too - massive dark chocolate flavor, roasted, even charred malt sweetness equally met by bitterness from the roast and the hops. Alcohol warmth is felt but only barely detectable on the palate (in the aftertaste, along with a bit of lingering bitterness). Never have I had such a massively flavorful beer before; my only knock on this is that it feels a bit too carbonated."

"This was very dark, heavy, and thick. Probably the BEST stout I have ever tasted. I had this with a prime rib dinner and it totally made the meal for me, complimenting my rare prime rib and horseradish. This is probably not for everyone, but for stout lovers, this is definitely one to try. This one surprised me. After Drinking Beamish and Guinness for years, this one was a rare treat. lager drinkers would probably not like this. It also makes a hell of a ""black and tan"" for those into that sort of thing. Cheers!"

" Roasted malt is at the front, no espresso but coffee on the tongue it finishes with a little alcohol. As the glass warms, the roasted malt comes out much better. I love the initial flavor, strong chocolate, strong malt. There's a touch of tinny alcohol when the beer is cold and I encourage this to be serve at room temperature."
"D - A benchmark for the style to be certain. Everything about this brew is dead on, from the dark roasty profile, to the pungent bouquet, to the massive mouthfeel it packs. Well rounded, but assertive and even abrasive. This is exactly what an RIS should be. Interested to see what happens with my other bottle after some aging. If I had just one complaint, it would be that for 10.50% ABV, I expected a bit more flavor; I've had 9.00% stouts that pack just as much as this one does, and I was hoping the slight increase in ABV over some other stouts would provide even more flavor than a traditional RIS."

"-Overall 4.0: Good, not great, Imperial Stout. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but it is missing a depth of flavor, particularly in the fore-palate, that I have found so pleasant and satisfying in other Imperial Stouts. This baby is over 10% ABV and it is completely unnoticeable. Great ""starter"" Imperial before moving on to more nuanced versions."
""
"Overall, I'd say drink yer 2008 bottles if you have any. I don't think the beer is getting any better after this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first time trying the IRS and I'm very glad I did. It's a great example of what a non-barrel aged Imperial Stout can be. I'll be buying a few more to save for a while."

"Full bodied but not massive; medium to slightly low in carbonation, so it’s very much alive but not fizzy at all; quite smooth and creamy with just a touch of chewy stickiness. Really a pleasure to drink; I’ll grab this anytime I see it from now on and stash them in the cellar. Again it’s a phenomenal buy at 5 or 6 bucks a bomber."
""
"O: Now that the days are finally starting to look a bit cloudy and dreary, it's time to bring out some toasty, dark brews to bring in the holiday season The Stone IRS is a great place to start boasting a 10.5% ABV. A big and flavorful stout showing that California breweries can do more than just brew hoppy ales."
""
""
""
"Suggestion: Grab 'em if you find 'em. Better served in a tulip or snifter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer, ESP for the price (I paid less than $7 for this). Probably the best bargain in the industry. People would easily pay twice this for this quality of a beer."
""
""
""
"O - This massive stout is top shelf. The class Stone puts in this bottle is 2nd to none and can be enjoyed when first released or after it sits in your personal cellar awhile. Most Russian Imperial Stouts call for some sitting to get the smooth easy drinking brew, but not this one. It's ready to go from its release. Sure it would sit well and age nicely, but the sheer complexity and masterly crafted balance allow we snobs to bust one open right away. This is an expertly crafted imperial stout from one of the best breweries in the world. A yearly favorite of mine and IMO you can't find many better stouts than this. A top 5 for me any day. Absolutely flawless."
"Overall I would not cite this as a good example of Russian Imperial Stout style. I get the impression that Stone was trying to push the envelope and sacrificed flavor for alcohol content. It's missing the roasty malt goodness and full flavor, balance, and body that smooths out the alcohol. If you want to try this beer, do it early in your session and consider making it a one beer session."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer and great value, but not as good as a many of the more recent imperial stouts. The flavors are not as intense as I would prefer while the alcohol is a bit distracting."
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with small mocha head. Notes of chocolate and sweet vanilla on the nose. A bit of candy, roasted grain, and maybe some hints of dark fruit. Smell is cloying sweet. Licorice comes out as it warms. Flavor is heavy black currant and chocolate. Some vanilla notes and slight hop bite. Lingering cocoa aftertaste on the back of the throat. Licorice flavor comes out with warming. Some comforting alcohol warmth on the way down. Sticky mouthfeel with the right carbonation. Good beer, but on the sweet fruit/sugared currant side for my liking. I like sweet chocolate coffee and hops a bit more. Flavor improved as it warmed, but not sure this belongs amongst the top on the leaderboard. But it seems I am in the minority there."
""
"O: I would have to give this one a A. I have had this aged 4 years and thought it lost alot of its prominate flavors which kinda bumbed me out. I would like to try this aged a year or 2 to see what happens."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This RIS is unique compared to others but still a great beer. Surprisingly easy to drink and gains in complexity as it warms and lingers on the palate. Flavors aren't too overwhelming but enough that its a satisfying flavor bomb, again, especially in the aftertaste. Damn, just took another sip and this brew never gets old and keeps getting better with temperature. Definitely a must have from Stone."
""
""
"Overall this is IMO a pretty poor showing from Stone. The thin body really allows a bitterenss to cut through that lingers and is super gross. Great vanilla and smoke notes but not as great as I've known stone to be."
""
""
""
"O: this is a great IRS, one of my favorites, look forward to it every year.... A must try for serious stout fans.... Well balanced, aggressive and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Fresh, this beer was a 4.25, but at 3.5 years of age, this goes 4.75. Of the 16 I picked up in 2011, only 2 remain. And given how this beer matures, I think those bottles will see a couple more years in the cellar. One of the very best impressions of an IRS. Ever."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: A solid imperial stout, but not overwhelming. Still, I would recommend and drink again."
""
""

"2007 vintage, thanks Chris. Either this beer transforms amazingly with age, or my palate has been refined over the last half year, but this was much better than I remember it from the first time (and I still thought it was pretty good). Less of the nearly-cloying anise and licorice (much less, actually) and quite a bit more cocoa powder and even a hefty dose of coffee beans in the aftertaste. Decent roast from the malts and still a solid alcohol warmth after all these years. Mouth feel wasn't as amazing as I remembered it, though. No oxidation - wow."
""
"A very capable RIS, no half measures."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is actually my 1st time having this beer, and it more than lives up to the things that I've heard about it. One of the BEST non-barrel aged stouts that I've ever had. Top notch! I need to grab a bottle to age. Also, I forgot to mention that at $7.99 a bomber, this beer is incredibly fair priced as well."
"O - A very well done imperial stout, the mouthfeel is more oily than any beer I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It has a decent viscosity but it just doesn't have one of those finishes that is characteristic of a stone brew that I'm just not a fan of. I can't really say that's a bad thing but, just not my favorite twist on an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A heavy hitting stout makes this a slow sipping beer. I enjoyed it but wonder if a little more time might take off some of the coffee/roasted bitterness and make it all the better."
""
"Tap 2005 ed at Alewife Baltimore for Stone Total Tap Takeover. Poured a deep motoroil with no head/no lace. Aroma is black olives, sardines, saltwater. Taste is salty pimento, black olives. Not good. Has not aged well. 10/01/2010 6/3/6/3/11=2.9"
""
"O- good RIS. Not a ton of complexity but nice chocolate and some sweet and roasted malt flavors."
""
""
"Not a big fan."
""
"Another great Stone beer and one you need to pick up if you like the style!"
""
"Pours black, smells like coffee and dark fruits. taste is dark, good stout. ours black as black can get with a lingering brown head. Nose is mostly coffee and with hints of cocoa. Very smooth stout. If I can say anything about this beer it’s that it truly is better served a little warm. I poured mine just under 40, after about 20 minutes it has a different taste. Strong bitter coffee taste with hints of alcohol. The aftertaste lingers a little longer as it warms. This is a nice finisher to a meal."

"Overall: Hands down, my favorite Stone."
"O- One of the best examples of the style I've ever had. I don't know how they can make a beer this rich and still achieve such balance. I didn't pick up the hops except in the bitterness, which was fine with me but I know some folks like a ton of late hopping in their IRSs."

"Overall this has a lot more hop than I expected. Can imagine as that tones down it will become a real nice RIS. Real slap in the face, great strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow. This beer is pretty amazing. Not quite as ""extreme"" as many RIS'es out there and doesnt try to clobber you over the head with the intesity of any particular flavor, or with the brashness of it's alcohol. Instead this beer offers up a tasty, proportioned, drinkable RIS that WILL still knock your socks off if balance and smoothness is what you crave."
"Definitly one to revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A good solid offering and that is in fact an understatement. It has all the characteristics of a stout – nice roastiness, good depth of flavours, and an enjoyable thicker body. As per typical from Stone and west coast brewing, the beer offers a moderate amount of bitterness, and it’s easy to know where it comes from. I find this works well in contrast to the sweeter elements. Overall, the beer is a very easily drinkable package. Furthermore, these bombers are reasonably priced with good accessibility. All this combined make it a regular go-to stout. May not be as bold or rare as others, but it doesn’t let you down. Highly recommend to try."
""
""
"Black color in the glass. Carbonation relaxes after pour but makes a return visit on the tongue. Nose is dark - caramel, roasted malt, dark chocolate. This IRS is a bit young at a 2012 brew, so there is some fruity flavor coming through in addition to the nose notes - plum and dark cherry but very subtle."
"Stone’s imperial ale has long been a favorite among the American beer aficionados, and it’s easy to see why. This is a great representation of the style and a worthy opponent for your darkest of nights."
""
""
""
""
"This is the 2012 edition and pours a dark black hue with a creamy two finger head that stays and nice lacing here and there,the smell is dark and milk chocolate,choc raisins,coconut,coffee and boozy alcohol,the mouthfeel is full lucious and really coats the mouth with tastes of dark and milk chocolate,creme caramel,choc raisins,cherries,a touch of boozy alcohol and finished with a cream coffee sweetness and overall a beautiful drop thats well worth a taste and be perfecy with a chocolate dessert cheers."

""
""
""
""

"Coffee coats the mouth then sweet malt with caramel, chocolate and coffee notes roll around until they are kept in check with a bitter licorice, herb, coffee bite. A very good RIS."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good. Not my favourite RIS but a really excellent beer that one can return to repeatedly."
""
""
"This beer pours pitch black as you would expect from a stout this size. It has the aroma of roasted malts ans well as some chocolate. The flavor matches the nose and really has a nice big bitterness to help keep the beer drinkable. There an alcohol presence but it isn't too much and the beer is about as drinkable as it needs to be. An IRS that really holds the standard."
""
"O: Compares very favorably to the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout as well as the Old Rasputin that is my current favority. I would still say I prefer Old Rasputin a litle bit more but I was pleasantly surprised by this imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good RIS, not nearly as bold as some I've had. Lots of flavor and everything balances quick nicely. Would give it a slightly higher rating if the head stuck around a bit longer as this went down fairly quick compared to others. May have been this bottle though.  Another great Stone brew. "
"Been at least a year since my last Stone IRS, and this was better than I remembered. Maybe it's the time on this bottle, maybe I just don't give Stone enough credit these days. Regardless, this is a tasty stout and remains one of the best values in craft beer."
""
"Overall: The is a classic example of cellaring making a world class beer even better. Pumped I have another 2007 and a 2008."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: One of the most complex beers I have ever had. An excellent brew that takes the taste buds on a ride! 10.5% ABV so be careful! Limited 2012 Release. Initial tasting 4/26/12"
"Poured into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip glass. Nose of anise and dark chocolate. Roasted malts and coffee are there but on the back burner. Slightly boozey but not very noticeable. Coffee comes across more strongly in the taste. Its dark roasted coffee and chocolate with a vein of anise running throughout. The flavors all blend together towards the end and fade out leaving hints of coffee and black licorice behind."
"O - An outstanding Russian Imperial Stout with a typical American influence that some might find too intense but that I enjoyed very much! Excellent drinkability, bold flavors, good complexity... Definitely a World-class beer! 4.5/5"
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent example of the style."
""
"O: Easy drinking. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced Russian Imperial Stout. Good body and smoothness with a great malty base."
"Overall: This one’ll put hair on your chest. World class. Lives up to the reputation."
""
"Very dark stout served in a scooner. Smells and tastes like expresso with a hint of chocolate. Hard to find on tap - the place I visited multiple times ran out. $6 a pint, but easily my current favorite beer. Drinks slow because it is thick, but not bitter."
"Black, or very very dark reddish brown, lacks head, thin dark mocha ring around edge. Thick, syrupy, black coffee maybe even espresso. Smell is smokey roasted coffee chocolate and just a bit of bacon. Chocolate frosting cake. Smoke is prominent at any rate. Taste is a bit different, with molasses coming through. Roasted, smokey coffee and bitter chocolate also present with brown sugar. Some carbonation, not creamy, but smooth. Somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall this is awesome. Having this for desert tonight, very much recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have a theory that the most satisfying characteristic a beer can have is being temporally dynamic in its feel and flavor. That is, the tastes change drastically from the moment you sip the beer through to a prolonged aftertaste. This stout achieves that quite well, at least for flavor, less for mouthfeel. I think a bit more carbonation would make it more visually attractive, and would help pronounce its feel and presence."
""
"O: This beer has a great amount of complexity to both the smell and the taste of the beer. This beer is very enjoyable but not the easiest to drink, the high ABV (which is not all that well hidden) makes this one a real sipping beer. Good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/d - A very good RIS - tends towards the sweet side which I think is more stylistically correct. The graininess and burnt flavors are there, but in a balanced fashion. A very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice stout for a stormy summer day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Delicious. As noted by everyone else this is one of the best imperial stouts around. Hits you with the best and robust flavors a stout has to offer, well-balanced booziness, and sips like a neat bourbon."
"Appearance is dark brown to black with surprisingly little head for an RIS. Slightly roast in the nose. Solid flavor combination of roasted malt, creaminess and residual sweetness. A complex offering with a subtle, but certainly present alcohol finish."
"OVERALL: A delicious stout sporting great strength, feel, flavor and general outcome. A stout that does its job and is proud of it. A salud' to Stone for a job well done!"

"O- A Must Try for any Imperial Stout Fan. Would love to try this aged in Oak or two years in the cellar"
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: Had a 2011 and a 2012 in the past month of this gem and it absolutely becomes a gorgeous beer, even after one year of age. The hops settle out to this orange and grape-like smoothness that just tastes fantastic. It also starts to pick up some flavors like a nice Port. It's really hard not to drink what I have left of these."
""
""
"O- Really a well-balanced beer. The malt has a full chocolatey flavor with notes of caramel without being sweet. The woodsy hops add multiple layers of complexity without being too bitter. The alcohol is well-integrated, adding yet another layer to the mix. A must-have for any beer stash."
""

"Pours a nice dark black with a thumbs width mocha head and decent lacing. A rich but warming aroma of chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, roasted malt with some definite alcohol showing itself. Flavorwise, the alcohol was definitely a quite notioceable, just a a tad too much so, with some roasted malt, chocolate, licorice and sweet cream. An awesome full, creamy and velvety mouthfeel. Not flat but also not much activity. Overall, a very nice IRS. The alcohol presence was a tad too strong, the flavor a bit straightforward but a very nice beer overall. I'd certainly drink this again and at ~$7 a bomber a pretty fair deal."
""
""
""
"D/O: I enjoyed my first 14-ounce-pour of this beer. It's big, bold, and flavorful. But, ultimately, I'm just not sure that ""Russian Imperial Stout"" is a style I really enjoy. This might be my favorite example of the style, but it's still not particularly drinkable for me, and wore as me as I worked through the bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty amazing Russian Imperial Stout even if it is a bit boozy. The alcohol is prevalent, but the chocolate notes are creamy and rich. It's a pretty solid offering that's worth checking out."
""
""
""
"What a wonderful Stout!"
"This is a good RIS, but it never blew me away. A bit one dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the baseline by which all other Imprrial Stouts are judged. It's got great flavor and ease of access makes it even better. I've had this beer every year since 2008. It ages with the best of them and drinks well fresh. It just is that good."
""
"Overall this was the first RIS i ever had and going back to the 2013 version a few years later and I remember why i fell in love with this beer and style. While i have had a few that I've prefered since then (old rasputin, batch 9000) this one is truly top of the line. And being so readily available and cheap is a huge plus as well."
""
""
""
"O- I had a mini vertical 2009-2011 but I was impatient and drank them. I bought extras of this to start again, glad I did."
"O: A bit straightforward, but as the beer opens up I enjoy it more and more. Very balanced, very drinkable, very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall good, solid and reasonably priced big beer. Perhaps I just went into this one with higher than reasonable expectations."

"O- This is a terrific brew. Incredibly smooth and satisfying. Drinks so easily, that I feel like cracking open my aging bottle. I will definitely get another bottle if I can. Props to Stone to perfecting a non-BA stout with wide distribution and affordability."
"O: A great RIS, World class, would like to see how this one ages for 5+ yrs."

"O- Exceptional beer. The taste is great, but the mouthfeel is the real stand out."

"This stout looks fantastic, tastes fantastic and feels so smooth going down. I've heard and read how good it is and it's taken me this long to find out for myself. The next one will be coming very soon, especially for the great price. This is an excellent value."

"Extremely drinkable, considering the ABV. Light/moderate carbonation. Overall outstanding."
"O - I have been keeping an eye out for this since late April and it just came in to my local Total Wine today. Not sure what the holdup was, but I'm happy to have it now. The nose was very impressive, probably one of the best smelling RIS (or IRS?) I have tried. The flavor is delicious and complex with notes of coffee, chocolate, fruit, oak, and toastiness. The high alcohol doesn't really show itself (although I find myself saying that more and more so it may just be my palate becoming accustomed to these double digit ABV'ers). Overall a great stout and at $5.99 a bomber, a great value. I will put one away to see how it ages."

"O: its yummy, its drinkable, but i have absolutely had IRS's with more complexity and a richer flavor profile, i had honestly expected more given this brews pedigree"

""
""
""
""
"O- One of the greatest stouts I've ever had the pleasure of having. Will certainly get a bottle or two before it's gone for this year."
""
""
"Overall - What a wonderful and flavorful stout. It's almost hard to believe this is 10.5%, alcohol is very well hidden. Warming comes from deep within, not in the mouth or the throat. Allowing this one to warm up will accentuate the sweetness of the dark fruits and the tartness of their skins, along with the amaretto-like flavors in this RIS. I feel that the roasty characteristics are actually more present at cooler temps - I would recommend enjoying this one at about 45 degrees. They diminish beyond 50. Try this one for sure if you see it."
""
"O - Gotta buy this stuff if you see it on shelves. Up there with Ten Fidy and BA Yeti!"
""
"D: Big and bold with chocolate, roast, and hops at the forefront. Balanced with harmonious flavors and texture. Again, a great purchase for the price. You can’t really go wrong with this one. Quaffability."

""
"O: Very drinkable and smooth. A great beer for the price."
""
""
""
"Smells of roasted malts, coffee, hops, and licorice. The taste is very rich. Chocolate, smoke, licorice, and coffee. Heavy mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and a delicious finish."

"O - My favorite RIS of all time, but it is a strong one, so I wouldn't wanted it for any or all occasions, perfect right before bedtime."
""
""
""
"Epic, has to be one of the best stouts I've ever had. I'm trying to think of a better one...KBS and...? Can't come up with another. Something to sip slowly and enjoy over time because of the strength, but you'll be fighting not to drink it faster."
"Overall, a great, don't get me wrong, brew. But not as mind blowing as I hoped."

"Overall: This is probably my favorite stone beer to date. Its just a really solid RIS. It exceed my expections and its got a nice price at 7 dollars a bomber."

"Overall, this is good fare, though I did find myself somehow wanting a bit more. Not from the ashy notes, but perhaps a few more sugars, or an additional layer of flavor to help bring out what is already there. This beer seems, in other words, to cry out for a bit of barrel aging, as a bourbon undertone would nicely complement the alcoholic, ashy tones. Still, even without this, it’s still a very nice stout, and worth trying."

"O-Really happy to have finally tried this.Top notch."

""
"Overall - a great imperial stout that anyone would love"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this beer is pretty damn good and maybe one of the best RIS economically speaking. The complexity is great and smell is amazing. Forums state this is an exceptional beer to age, and I can definitely understand why. There is some room to improve but not much. Looking forward to how these are going to taste in 2 years."
""
""
"O: One of the best beers on the market. Every time it comes out I grab several so I can age them and they Always seem to get better."
"Poured into a Maudite tulip. Pours a deep, dark black with a frothy finger and a half of hazelnut colored head. Smells of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. The chocolate nose is excellent. Big chocolate and coffee notes on the palate, with hints of toffee and caramel. Excellent bitter balance to the sweet malt flavors. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Supremely sippable. This is a delicious Russian Imperial Stout and is an absolute bargain at $6.99"
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours black with a creamy chocolate brown head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the glass during consumption. The alcohol smell is very forward in the aroma, but I can also catch dark roasted malts and coffee in the aroma. It's very inviting. The alcohol definitely comes through in the taste here. I can also pick up the roasted malts and coffee flavors that I smelled. I also pick up some dark chocolate flavor and anise as well. I might not have been lookign for anise if not for the description on the bottle. There is also some hop bitterness there to balance this big brew. The alcohol definitely has a warming effect and a bottle of this would be perfect for a cold winter night. This is a medium to full bodied beer and it is a sipper. It is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a good example of the style."
"This is a nice RIS from Stone. It is a little on the sweet side for me. I prefer a little less sweetness, ala Old Rasputin RIS, which is my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great all around beer. Nothing stands out that differentiates itself, but just does everything well. The one thing I would note is that the aroma and flavors are all strong and in your face. Not subtle."
"A-"
"Overall – A very tasty and slow drinking stout. It has a wonderful flavor profile, aroma, appearance and a fantastic body. Very enjoyable."
"O: An absolutely fantastic RIS, deceptively easy-drinking."
""
""
"O- I enjoy this version each year that it comes out. I drink some immediately, and cellar a few bottles for 1-2 yrs... wonderful when fresh & exceptional when aged."
""
""
""
"O - This was a very nice RIS. A larger hop presence than I was expecting (although I should’ve known better with Stone), but it was balanced well with the other flavors and really added to the overall taste and mouthfeel. I usually like my stouts with more roasted coffee and chocolate flavors but I enjoyed this beer very much."
"Stone is one of my favorite craft brewery's and they certainly don't disappoint. Awesome stuff and priced very reasonably."
""
""
"O - one of my favorite stouts, very roasty bitter a nice underlying sweetness and a very smooth thick brew. I would think lactose was used to get it this thick and smooth but don't think it was based on taste"
""
""
""
""
"overall its good easy to drink and i typically not a fan of hoppy stout but it works here"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a pretty good brew, one I would likely drink again and certainly if it was free. I have not bought into Stone Brewing like some I have seen, but they produce good beers no doubt. I just prefer a different style than theirs, that’s all. If you are a RIS fan, this is a must-try, for it is a solid example of the style."
""

"O- This was a great Russian Imperial Stout from Stone. Most of the Stone beers I've had have been great, but nothing remarkable. This beer definitely fits that mold. This is one of the better RIS I've had, but definitely not the best one. I liked the nice creamy chocolate taste that hid the abv very well. It could have been a little bit sweeter to cancel out some of the bitterness, but overall it was a quality beer. For $8.95 per bomber you can't go wrong. I definitely recommend picking up a few."
"O - This is an amazing beer. Hype fully justified. Now ... if only it were available year round and wasn't $8.99/22oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O-A lot of coffee for a RIS, seemed more like an American Imp Stout. Still a good beer. If age could calm down the coffee the beer has room for a lot of improvement."
"O: It's been a long time since I tried this one and all the memories came flooding back after my first sip. This one along with Old Rasputin were the ones that turned me onto the style in the first place."
""
""
""
"a true icon, and one of this years best."
""
"O: I heard mostly good things about this offering but also some mediocre thoughts as well. I agree with the good things on this one. It was a pleasant surprise and I am really enjoying this. I love bourbon barell aged stouts but this too has its place. So glad I was able to pick up a few of these as I am eager to see how this matures. Good thing I have other beers in my cellar to grab because I would be tempted to drink all of these before the maturation process even started! This is a great Stone beer!"
""
""
"originally reviewed on: 06-13-2010"
"O- One of the best stouts on the market, a real classic at this point. Not overly sweet, roasted flavors are outstanding, I forgot how much I had missed this beer since last year."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer, I love imperial stouts and this one is in my TOP 5 ""non-barrel aged"" stouts."
"O. Really complex RIS. Its at a great price range, and availability to really load up a nice stash and age it or drink a ton of it. Really up there on my list!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone Imperial Russian Stout, 22 oz. bomber: Stone brews up some great IPA style beers, but can they make a good stout? Not guaranteed, but in this case Stone comes through with flying colors. Pitch black with a thin tan head. Big aroma lets you know there is a serious stout sitting in the glass. Surprisingly drinkable, with lots of complexity. Flavors range from chocolate to vanilla, molasses to coffee to ginger spice. Flavors keep changing as you make your way through the bottle and as the stout warms. The Oskar Blues Ten Fidy is my favorite Imperial Stout, but the Stone ranks up there and is worthy of working into the rotation. I love the complexity of this brew. A must try for Imperial Stout fans."
"Insanely drinkable."
"O) What I like the most about this is that it is not an overly sweet interpretation of the style but an approach that leaves the consumer wanting much more than one!"
""
""
""
"O: Very impressive and certaintly worthy of the hype. However, I still think I prefer Old Raspy and Ten Fidy to this."
""
"O: How can this so cheap relative to all other beers of its ilk? It's a benchmark for the style. Such a great beer."
""
""
""
"Poured in to a shifter, pitch black with a small mocha head. Lacing is descent. Alcohol on the nose, coffee, milk chocolate, tobacco, small hop punch. Taste is rich and full bodied, again, chocolate and coffee dominant with hints of tobacco. Even fresh, this is a complex brew, with some age on it it will be excellent."
"O- A great beer, the nose just doesn't really punctuate until you have a sip, which isn't really a bad thing. Very thick and pronounced. Could mellow out some of the alcohol nicely with with age, overall a wonderful beer as is."
"I look forward to trying aged IRSs. I have another in the cellar. 4.0"
"O- I really like this beer and would love to try it bb aged."
"This is a nice complex tasting stout. I am going to savor this one, and as soon as I get a chance, I'm getting some more!"
"O: This was my first time trying this one and I can say that this is definitely one of the better RIS's out there. Glad I picked a few up to enjoy. We'll see how the do with some age."
""
""
" I love this beer, I love imperial stouts and this one is in my TOP 5 ""non-barrel aged"" stouts. AND it's 7 bucks a bomber!! This beer is amazing!"
""
"O: Very drinkable. ABV is really well hidden. Solid, but honestly I thought it was gonna be better."
""
""
"O - again, will never order a stout/porter over a pale or IPA, but will definitely buy this again. It is excellent, and the price can't be beat. Can't wait to open my 2nd bottle in a year or so and see how it compares. Pick it up, now, in large quantities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Super easy drinking stout, especially at 10.5% abv."
""
""
"Overall, amazing. This beer is (and defines) what a world class RIS should be. I cannot wait until this beer ages and I get to experience a whole new level of Stone IRS."
""
"O - Awesome! Hard to deny how good this one is at such a reasonable price and availability."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Stone is known to brew some aggressive brews, so I'm a little befuddled by this RIS. While all the typical characteristics are there, they seem fairly muted and, dare I say, safe. It's a good RIS, but I can't say it's in my top 10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: so good but will definitely get better with age"
"D: Danger, danger, danger. So easy to drink at 10.5% abv..."
""
"Mouthfeel - Full bodied. thick, chewy.low caronation. Extended bitter finish. Like I said, the beer isn't all that complex but it does its job. Its solid it packs plenty of flavor and is an easy drink with only a slight booziness for a 10.5% beer."
""
"Overall very nice, but none of the component parts wow me right after I drank a hunahpu's stout. Was better aged a year than it is right now."
""
""
""
"I love this beer. It's such a great RIS, yet it isn't impossible to find. In fact, it's easy to find, and it's reasonably priced. It's not the greatest thing I've ever tasted, but I've purchased this every year since I turned 21 and I do not intend on stopping until my liver fails."
"This beer is pretty damn full bodied. I'd even wager it being on the consistency of a lighter, fizzy chocolate milk. Damn good stout, very filling."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a bang-on recipe - quintessential RIS. Incredibly solid."
"O- This is my new favorite stout and a fantastic value at $5.99. Don’t serve this too cold. I had to let the second pour warm up a bit to get the best head and flavor profile. Definitely one to savor and pair with food. The brewer says that it cellars well so I plan to put this in the collection."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, this stout is incredible. I haven't had this beer for about 2-3 years and this beer is absolutely great for a non barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout. Extremely smooth, and rich with layered depth that is almost perfectly balanced. Stone needs to start releasing this year round. It is amazing."
"served ice cold unfortunately, which majorly stunts the beer's aroma. It appears jet black and oily with tight tan bubbles that hold the glass tightly. The taste is a bold rich coffee roastiness and chocolate sweetness. It's definitely a potent stout with an extra chewy mouthfeel. Overall this stout is quite the bang for your buck and worth trying once."
"O - Overall this is the same top tier stout I have grown to love in a bottle. A bit better overall on draft, but nothing too substantial. Grab it if you get the chance!"
""
"this one is a keeper for sure, especially at less than 8 bucks a bomber. pours a gorgeous and enticing coffee black color, heavy and rich, with a 1 inch light brown head that has the consistency of cool whip, thick and light. it just floats on top of the beer without ever getting smaller. smells quite spicy for the style, espresso beans radiate as well. there are also notes of milk chocolate, vanilla beans, and charred english malts. flavor is similarly complex, with the roasty coffee and chocolate flavors being most prominent. there is that spice character again, maybe peppercorns or anise or clove... great alcoholic sweetness in the finish. the feel is quite thick, almost motor oil thick. mellow carbonation lets the complexities linger, and the aftertaste is awesome. this is a bigtime beer, a good one to share with a lover. well worth its excellent reviews."
""
"A fine beer, better than a lot of the stuff people are throwing in barrels and expecting to sell for 15 a bomber. I think I need a case."
"For some reason, I thought this beer was a lot better than what I just had. You can't beat the value of this bottle (@ $6.99 per bottle), I am surprised a little bit that it's listed in the top 100 beers. I bought a few more bottles to age - maybe my opinion will change after a few years."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is excellent- very full bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Not too syrupy/thick- very drinkable but in a sipping kind of way. Get it!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I give a lot of beers good reviews because I usually buy good beers, but I have never gone with 5's across the boards - it's just like saying the beer is perfect, and once you've had the ""perfect"" beer for a style, what's the point of having another? To be reminded of what less-than-perfect tastes like? Also, what is the perfect RIS? It's subjective, right? This was as close to perfection as they come in a RIS. Silky sweet, but with a drying balance; sublimely mellow, infinitely drinkable, and with a nice high abv."
""
""
""
"O: Another gorgeous beer from Stone and an RIS at its best. I'm excited to try this with a little age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: Do not try this beer very warm! Make sure its either chilled or semi-cooled (less than room temp). I feel it becomes a lot stronger in the bitterness and the chocolate notes are overpowered by the coffee roastiness. It becomes an entirely different beast depending on the temperature. I prefer it cold and my scores are based on that."
"O: This is one of the best non-barrel aged RISes of all time in my opinion. You almost have to give it extra credit for being so widely available and easily attained. Not to mention quite cheap! The mouthfeel is honestly the best part. It's a great combination of heft, creaminess and smoothness without being too cloying or too syrupy. Otherwise, surprisingly fruity RIS, making it more balanced than most which are usually just hardcore roasted malt and nothing else."
"Overall, I can see why this beer is a standard in the cellar. Smokey, malty, hoppy, but still approachable. Bravo!"
""
""
"O- I like my IRS's from time to time and I have to say this a solid brew. It is a great beer and I look forward to aging a couple bottles."
""
"O: Simply fantastic."
""
""
"O: Very pleasing... bold, but a smooth stout for men. I suggest drinking at room temperature, letting it sit in your mouth for a little, and swallowing slow. Hopefully I can grab another bottle for aging, but even this fresh release taste great. The texture in the mouth is some damn pleasing, it dares you to take just one sip. If it's one gripe I can find with this brew, it would be the head and the lacing, but that isn't a big deal. This is one of the best Imperial Russian Stouts you can find out there. I highly recommend and would suggest to experienced beer drinkers. Worthy of the beer mantle!!!CHEERS!!!"

"O: One of my favorite RIS. Amazing flavor and complexity for such value. Looking forward to buying a stash of 2012."

"Enjoyed many vintages many times. This particular bottle is an ’09 that went straight from the brewery to my fridge. Vigorous pour produces a huge, burnt coffee/brown head. Aroma is roasted (almost oat-like) malt, chocolate, and coffee. As the beer warms, I smell some dark fruity notes. Smells great. Taste is huge thick chocolate malt, coffee, some dark trailing dried fruit, and the slightest whisper of alcohol. Extremely smooth feel in the mouth with the transition between the different flavor components."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, appearing black. One finger tan head and light lacing. Aroma of smokey and dark malts, dark fruit, light alcohol. Taste is lighter than other top RIS, with dark and smokey malts, dark fruit. Finish has light hops and very distinct alcohol, which detracts from the flavor and flavor progression. Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
"5/9/13 update - The char notes have toned down, as has the booziness. There seems to be more of a (sweet) milk chocolate character with just a hint of dark fruit."
"Very dark body with a medium frothy light brown head. Rich chocolate, roast, some caramel and rum-soaked fruit. Sweet chocolate, faint coffee, some rum-soaked fruit and a big bitter finish. Medium full body with moderate carbonation. Good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into 20 oz Duvel Giant tulip. Vintage 2011. Pours a pitch black, with a gorgeous 3 inch mocha head, plenty of lacing. Smell is chocolate, roasted coffee, smoke, and a hint of licorice. Taste is all of that, but less roasty than I would like. Body is thinner than I like, plenty of carbonation, not overly dry, and drinkable for the size. This is one of the beers I am always shocked it gets the recognition it does, a nice stout, but a top 100 beer?"

"2008 on draft at Dutch's. Looks good; black with a little head that quickly dissipates into lacing. Smells good too; deep and malty. Tastes great! One of the best RIS I've ever had. The age does wonders to an already great beer. Mouthfeel is great too, especially for such a big beer (11%). Overall, an excellent brew that I hope to have aged again."
""
""
"O: This is a obviously a very complex stout, but almost too complex. I can think of a couple Stouts I would go for before this one. It is not bad, but just not a real stand out as far as imperial stouts go. That being said, I do think you should give a try for yourself. I bet this beer ages interestingly, though, with how complex the aroma/flavors are."

""
""
""

"O - Absolutely a must buy every year. This is one of the standards of the RIS style. If you happen to see any vintage bottle at the store, buy it. You won't be disappointed. I have one sitting for a bit longer, maybe I'll go 12-18 months and revisit. It can only get better."

"O: Great RIS. The only thing holding it back for me is the lack of dark roasted malt flavor. Felt it was a bit sweet. Truly a great beer and a must have. If I see it I will drink it. Had the opportunity to try a 2010 and 2011. The 2010 lost some of the sweetness, and picked up a salty, soy sauce character. This beer cannot go wrong. Too drinkable."

"the body is as close to black as brown can be. a finger of mocha colored head slowly settled into a crescent shape on top. the nose is comprised of roasted coffee, dark bitter chocolate and smoke. taste is full of big robust coffee and chocolate notes with a touch of roastie smoky goodness and a generous warming effect from the alochol. mouthfeel is full body, creamy, good carbonation and a bitter finish from the dark chocolate. my only complaint about this beer is the mouthfeel should be sticky like syrup, but i think the high abv might be cutting it for a cleaner feel."

"Overall, it is the strongest stout (isn't that redundant?) I've ever tasted and my first IRS. The moment I took the first sip I regretted instantly I poured almost the entire bottle in the glass; it almost knock me on my back over how strong it is. This ""viscous beauty"" as it's written in the side of the bottle is a dangerous and sinful stout (although Stone claims no sin was committed in the production of this brew) is worth to seek and drink. It was a whole new experience for me, but I think I'll stick with regular American Doubles/Imperial Stouts."
"O - I like this one but have never tasted it before so I can't compare to the 2010 or 2011. Even after two years of aging you can still taste the alcohol quite a bit. Overall not my favorite but definitely good."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is jet black, with a low profile, small bubbled, light brown head that holds to the glass as you go. Aromas are rich, with blackstrap molasses, dark roasted coffee, and old world fruit sweetness. The beer has a full, round body, and delivers an initial blast of dark roast coffee initially. Forward flavors are immediately followed up by a strong molasses and chocolate palate, with a deep, dark sweetness overall, and a slight hopping at the end of the flavor profiles. Cleans itself up very nicely, leaving a roasty and boozey aftertaste that has hints of fruit character. Very smooth, clean finish. Tremendous beer."

"O - A classic RIS, and one of the best on the market. Aging brought out layers of complexity that weren't fully developed when this beer was fresh (though it was still excellent a couple years ago). I'm very glad I sat on this for a while and look forward to aging more of it."

"This pours a sultry black body with a nice rich caramel foam. The nose brings molasses and a rich cocoa. There is still some booze hanging around in the background which I imagine creates some of the heat that appears in the taste. Other aspects of the taste include dark caramels, slight molasses, and rich dark cocoa powder. This has velvety smooth flow, but there is a harshness that if removed would make this amazing. Overall this is a very good beer but it needs more time. I must say I enjoy it."

"650 ml bottle. 2011 release. Pours a dark black with a small tan chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasty with dark, bitter chocolate. It has a bit of a floral hop presence as well. A bit of alcohol as well. The initial taste has some bitter chocolate, then comes a bit of coffee roastiness and a bit of hops. There is also some dark fruits, plum, and a hint of cherry. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and a hint of alcohol, but not nearly as much as in the nose. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. Low-medium carbonation. Great beer, especially when you consider the price."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not one of my favorites. I have aged it over 6 months so far and the flavors have changed... just not for the better in my opinion. Heavy licorice flavor almost. More of an English RIS with low hop profiles. Good but not great."

"No heat detected. All the flavors melded real nicely with roasted chocolate, anise, and hints of caramel, marshmellow, and currants. The mouthfeel was a big difference. So smooth. Heard it ages well for another couple years so looking forward to cracking my last '11 vintage in about 2 years. This is a classic imperial stout for aging, along side Bell's Expedition."

"Pours totally black. Really struggling to find some light through this. Mocha head recedes quickly to a ring. Smells of dark cherries, roasted espresso, some vanilla sweetness. The taste is all roasted malt and chocolate. There is some anise and hop bitterness on the finish. Alcohol has already dropped since I first had this about six months ago but it's still a little hot. It is totally thick and viscous with fairly light carbonation. Really smooth going down. Can't wait to see this one develop further."
"Tastes like a massive version of an Export stout. Ageing it could work well- really want to tone down the sweetness, the roast bitterness and perhaps even the alcohol. There is a huge deal of complexity in this beer and I think it can be drawn out more with a few years in the cellar. Will most likely buy another to see."
"Overall: a great IRS. Well balanced. Fairly complex. The ABV is well hidden. Good drinkability."
"cheers"
"This beer is sublime. The flavors are in amazing balance... with its notes of woods, coffee, and chocolate all at amazing quality and in perfect balance...so much so that they equal more than the sum of their parts. This beer is world class."
"Overall just an outstanding, well-executed imperial stout that hits the mark perfectly. Drinkable, tasty, delicious."
"Pours deep black, like my soul. With a frothy finger and a half kahki head, that dissolves to a ring with some cling. The nose on this is complex, and pretty amazing. I get heavy tobacco leaves scent in one whiff, leather in another, and some anise. Smells manly. Flavor is exciting, roasty malts mainly, slight alcohol finish. I dig. Mouthfeel is smooth. I really enjoy this offering from Stone."
"Overall. A good RIS ...make that IRS. A little warm, but rich chocolates, molasses and coffee keep the alcohol taste at bay."
"overall a great RIS, could maybe be just a bit thicker, but that's nit picking."
"O - I like this brew. It didn't rocket to the top of my Russian Imperial Stout list but I'll have it again. 4.0"
"Honestly I find this much more drinkable with a little age on it. Fresh it's just too hot and not to my liking. A perfect beer to age and enjoy over the years."
"Smooth rules the day, really good beer."
"Overall it is a good brew and a decent Russian Imperial Stout. I wish it had a little more complexity. The start definitely differs from the finish (finish is more bitter roasty taste while start is more bitter chocolatey taste) but overall I only got hints of three of four different flavors while it would have benefited from more! Overall, I recommend this brew and I would have it again."
"Poured into a Phantom Canyon Brewing Co. shaker. Thick, opaque black, reddish-brown around the edges, with a good three fingers of chocolaty brown head that receded to a mere ringlet about halfway through the session; soapy lacing throughout. Served at just about room temperature. Aroma rich with chocolate, roasted malts and coffee, with a touch of smoke. Luxurious taste of bittersweet chocolate balanced with a bit of bitter coffee, and subtle hints of smoke and and definite blast of alcohol warmth that perhaps is augmented when the beer is warmer. Thick and full-bodied, and very drinkable, if a bit on the strong side."
"Split this bottle with a friend. It’s every bit the big, bad monster I remember it being. And oh so good. Pours a thick, solid black with very little foam but a big aroma of toffee, coffee, roasted chocolate on the nose. Tasty espresso and cacoa nibs on the palate. Black licorice? Oily, heavy mouthfeel. Deeply complex, like a multipart sympathy that hits every note. I let it warm, took my time, enjoyed every single sip. I’m not worthy!"
"o: This is a big beer which needs to be taken seriously. The alcohol is not afraid of showing itself but it's a background presence and not dominant which I appreciate. A solid RIS which I'll seek out next year. And such a great value to boot. Perfect for a crisp, cool autumn evening."
"Overall: An excellent Russian Imperial Stout. Very well balanced, a tiny bit too boozy for my tastes, but I'm definitely not complaining."
"A great take on the RIS style."
"O-This is one of the beers that got me into appreciating craft beer, and it still holds up."
"O - Not impressed with this Stone offering. I hope it flattens out with age, I still have two more... If anyone would like a Belgo Anise version, please let me know!!! What happened to Stone brews setting the pace for the rest of the West Coast? Close to a drain pour..."
"This is one heck of a RIS, Stone nailed it. Some beers do well with just the taste or just the aroma, but this one kills it from the look, aroma, and taste. Can't wait to try my earlier vintages ('07 and '08) somewhere down the line."
"O - This was a super good and super big stout; it's great how easy it is to get. Can't wait to see how it ages!"
"22 oz bomber poured into a Sam Adams glass. Pours opaque black with two finger tan head, lacing is lacking for an RIS. Mocha and coffee aroma. Taste notes of mocha, espresso, licorice, and dark fruit. Thick mouthfeel but smoother aftertaste then you often get with this style. Alchohol well hidden. Overall this is a smooth complex flavored RIS."
"Overall: After all the RIS that I've tried, this is still a top-notch brew. It is one of the benchmarks for the ""American-Russian Imperial Stout"" category and combined with its availability, affordability and reliability, it is a true classic. The SNPA of RIS."
"Overall: It scores a little better because it is quite drinkable, and the hefty ABV is not detectable. But this is not the best version of Stone IRS/RIS I remember. Too much smoke, not enough excitement... it didn't wow me."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Pretty slick; good in this category. I would call this a very solid imperial stout. I've had this once before (2010 version) that I remember enjoying more....seemed more balanced overall. Seems like fresher could be the way to go with this brew. But I definitely still enjoyed it and would have it again."
"O-- Not as cake like big as say Marshall Z is but this was big in feel. Big chocolate bomb in this. Glad I cellared this for a year. Long cellaring does wonders with this. One of the better US seasonal RIS out there and a great bang for the buck."
"I don't know if I'd order this one again, as it was just average. Detected way too much alcohol, which made it a bit difficult to finish"
"O: Great bang for you buck. With some age on it it really does wonders. Can't wait to pop open the 2008 I have."
"O - Decent IRS. Not my favorite on account of it being more on the bitter side. It's a bit better on tap."
"Overall-So this beer isn't too hard to get when it comes out, it's a super RARE beer. It's about 6 to 8 bucks, and it's fucking delicious. A true winner and I WILL be buying a case of the 2012 next summer."
"O: Nice, but not among the best Russian imperial stouts. 4"
"O: This was great, reminded me how good of a beer this is. This was clearly better than the Belgo Anise, which I just don't really like at all. Hope to pick up a 2012 next time I see it! 4"
"A+"
"Final word: I can't believe something this damned good is so readily available!!!"
"O: A very good beer for being such highly produced. Worth every penny."
"SOOOO good. For a beer with a production volume as high is this one, this is a truly an incomparable brew. A grade of ""A" almost undervalues this beer. Thank you, Stone!"
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer which is an excellent Imperial Stout that shines for its smoothness and solid taste. Perfect pairing for desserts!"
"Overall: A very good take on a Russian Imperial Stout. Good balance among the malts, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits. Goes down incredibly smooth for such a big beer."
"O: This is a really enjoyable beer and one I'm glad that's easily available in my area. Stone is widely regarded as one of the best brewers in the US and this beer is a terrific example of why that is."
"O- This is a great rendition of a big imperial stout. Fantastic coffee and chocolate flavors melded with a thick, creamy body, make for a very enjoyable RIS experience. One of my favorites and highly recommended."
"The Rest: This a one big, flavorful beer. It's crazy how thick and creamy it is with almost no carbonation to speak of. This is one to enjoy nice and slow."
"This beer is more than the sum of its parts. Wish I had more of the old bottles. Thankfully there's a ton of it made, so hopefully I can acquire some."
"O- Man, this beer rocks. Maybe the best deal around, getting a world class RIS for 7 bucks."
"Overall: Not what I would expect from a Russian Imperial Stout but still very interesting in a good way."
"O: One of my favorite off the shelf (season) impy stouts. I love this brew. So much so that I brewed a clone of it that’s conditioning now. Can’t wait to try it! The only thing that could make me love this more is a slightly thicker mouthfeel (I like them REAL VISCOUS), more coffee taste and aged in bourbon barrels. Next up to try is the Belgo Anise version of this. 4.5"
"A solid RIS with lots of great flavour and a lovely mouthfeel."
"A beer I can certainly appreciate and a lover of imperial stouts should definitely check this one out (though it's likely they already have)."
"O- One of the best ""regular"" RIS's I've had the pleasure of trying, altough I think Plead the 5th does a much better job at concealing its booze while having some stronger flavors."
"O - Another very solid beer from Stone. I have a couple aging and looking forward to seeing how they develop."
"Overall: A very good Imperial Stout. A tad bitter in the finish, but nothing to really complain about. Great balance and I would love to try this barrel aged."
"O - Great IRS. Look forward to it every year."
"Overall: surprised. Stone has always been held high, if not the highest in my brewer's book. although I haven't had the entire catalog or anything, Arrogant Bastard has long been my favorite beer, Ruination and IPA are great, and having the Sublimely Self-Righteous for the first time the other day, I can definitely say this one just falls short of the others. perhaps it was the barrel or bottle, I won't hesitate to give it another try one day."
"A great example that is very drinkable now, yet I'm excited to see how a couple of bottles age."
"Overall this is a great beer. Never had such an old beer before so I didn't know what to expect besides what I've read. Pleasantly surprised. Just glad I could try such an aged beer without having to have the patience, especially since this beer was brewed when I was still in high school."
"Awesome beer and for the price none other beat it."
"O: A very solid brew but I prefer this beer with about a year on it. Too much hops fresh."
"This is a wonderful drink and take on IRS style. In Stone's traditional bold style, not for the feint of heart!"
"Overall, a splendid. An amazing example of the style and aggressive! Excellent."
"M: Medium bodied, coats the mouth well. For a 10.5% ABV, I can barely notice, although it does has have a slight warming effect. Overall a very well put together stout from beginning to end."
"Overall: This is surprisingly a very straightforward RIS. While I might have expected something a little more out of left field from Stone, I am impressed by how well they made a traditional Imperial Stout. Fantastic stuff!"
"Another beer I enjoyed pre-BA shattered…sigh. I held this beer in such high esteem I held on to my ’09 to sample against the newer version. It’s not as complex as I remember as I see it now a bit high on the roasted side. Certainly a great beer but it just can’t live up to the pedestal and expectations I had previously had for it. Oh I was so naïve… blessed ignorance. Damn my developing palate and BA for introducing me to a wonderful world of beer!"
"A pretty kick-ass RIS, though I think it could improve even a bit more with a little age. Sufficient roast, but not much in the way of burnt flavors, which is okay with me. Moderate amount of fruity esters and tons of chocolate make for a very pleasant beer, and definitely a go-to for dessert pairing."
"O: Exceptional, well-made stout, well balanced and easy to drink. This is so easily available and reasonably priced that this should be a staple."
"A modicum of the style and a superb beer. This year's batch is a winner."
"NOTE: To be fair, the bottle DOES warn of this beer's hearty and boozy nature. In that regard, it certainly lives up to its promise. Be warned!"
"O- This is a great example of a RIS. It's nothing overly exciting but for the price it really hits the spot."
"Overall: This is a top brew for me, and my favorite from Stone by far. I'm glad I grabbed a few bottles this year, it will be tough for it to last me until next release. Probably one of the best, if not the best, Russian Imperial Stouts out there."
"The bottle suggests you buy a case and drink one every 3-6 months to see how it develops. I may actually do that. It was excellent."
"Edit: I'm drinking one of my 2010s right now, and it's even more delicious. Still gorgeous, devoid of bugspray aromas, and packed with the same flavors - minus the burn. A year and a half of age has really tamed the beast, and right now its balanced mix of dark chocolate brownie batter sweetness and fruity hop bitterness is working beautifully. I'd probably give it a set of scores along the lines of 5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5. Terrific beer, and only $8. I just saw 5 more 2010s on the shelf last night, so now that I've confirmed my suspicion that the beer ages well I'll be cleaning them out."
"O- Stone IRS is a damn good beer. It isn't a top 100 beer in the world, in my opinion, but it is very good."
"Overall: Well, this is a very nice beer. I definitely am not going to be drinking these often just because of the alcohol content but the beer is very complete and an all around top in its genre."
"2011 Stone RIS poured into my Brooklyn tulip. Pours a pitch black, syrupy texture. Awesome brown/tan head, about 3 fingers. No light gets through this at all. Just black as motor oil. Smell- roasty, mocha, dark chocolate. Dark fruits, maybe some coffee bitterness. Taste- bitterness, roasty notes, dark chocolate, the alcohol is definitely here- not very well hidden, but I think I actually like my RIS to burn me every now and then. Something to hit you in the face and say ""I'm a badass and you are a weakling"". Back to the review...definite dark fruits and a warming alcohol presence. At the end, there is a bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel- this is slick, and although is a definite sipper, is nice and velvety. Drinkability- this beer is menacing, evil, and wants to impose its dark will upon you. I bought 3 bottles of this, and can't wait to see what it does after a couple years on it. Some of the alcohol heat will die, and it will be super super smooth."
"O - A solid stout with some excellent scents. Not as sweet as I like but nonetheless, still very good!"
"T: Molasses, dark chocolate, plum, some hints of other dark fruit and a bit of coffee. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for me. Solid, but not as good as I remember this being last year."
"Aggresive pour creates a one inch foamy head that dissipates in a couple minutes. Aroma is heavenly.... cocoa, coffee, molasses. First taste is great as expected, with the same notes and the addition of hints of raisins and cream. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, lacing and density of head could be a slight bit heavier. Amazing beer i had to try fresh because of the hype. Time to grab a few for the cellar."
"Overall it's one of the best IRS's I've tried. I'm used to a much thicker and harsher drink with an IRS; this one's a bit uncharacteristic of what I'm used to with the style but makes for an excellent sipping beer."
"overall, this is what Imperial russians should be, big bold strong beers that dont fool around, love it"
"O - Stone offers a great example of an RIS with this brew. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the style. The smoothness can't be overstated, and the balance of flavors along with that make for a wonderfully drinkable imperial stout."
"Overall, this is one of the better imperial stouts I've had in a while. It's one I def. can see myself buying again. Well done, Stone."
"The mouthfeel is fantastic; coats your entire mouth with the dark bitter chocolate flavors and lingers on your tongue for a decent amount of time after you sip. Plenty of carbonation which I always appreciate and it drinks medium to full bodied overall I have to say. Overall, d@mn girl sh#t; this beer is meant for aging. Some like it young when it's more hoppy and bitter and acrid, but I cannot highly recommend more that you should age this for at least 2 years (preferably up to 4 or more apparently) to enjoy the great complexity that this beer can offer."
"O- Considering buying a case of this, if the store will allow it. Such a good beer. It's great fresh, would love it with some age. glad I already have 3 more bottles in the fridge. thank you stone, for coming to Missouri."
"O - Beast. Great highly surprisingly drinkable stout. High ABV would tell you its not very drinkable but hell with that. Its so damn smooth."
"This beer pours a thick black color with two fingers of brown sugar lime head that retains and laces amazingly. The aroma is strong with chocolate malt and bitter coffe notes. The taste is strongest with the bitter coffee notes and has a hint of ark chocolate. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbed, but not Terri le. Overall a good IRS."
"This is easily one of the top beers I've had...so very happy to finally have it in Texas!"
"Overall: Fantastic beer, pity is it so hard to get in Europe"
"From a bomber, pours inky black with head that stuck around briefly and left some lacing in the glass. Smells of chocolate malt with a bit of alcohol. Such a smooth tasting well balanced, great overall beer. One of the best RIS that I have had. Would definitely buy again and would be a great night tasting against some of my other favorite RIS with a few people."
"Probably one of the most complex beers i've ever had. To sum up my review: holy shit."
"had an 08 the other day and while it was good, im not sure age does any good with this one. ill let ya know when i have an 05"
"OA - a great beer in a great style. In my top 5 RISs!"
"Overall, will certainly buy again. Along with Ten-Fidy and Old Rasputin some of the best imperials I've had."
"This is a big beer that means business. However, despite some of its bigness, it's easy to drink and very smooth. One of Stone's better selections. Very glad I bought two of these."
"Overall, the 2011 is a very good beer, but the 2006 is an incredible one. An excellent example of the specific type of depth and complexity that only seems to show up in aged beers."
"O: Didn't live up to the hype for me. Definitely a good. IRS for the price. Can't wait to get some age on this one."
"D-Overall this was a wonderful beer. It gets alot of hype. Im looking forward to opening a bottle in my cellar of this in 10 yrs or so. Def. try this if you havent' its a solid russian imperial stout."
"Overall - Just outstanding. I bought 6 bottles and I think I need to go back and buy more."
"O - Good dark flavors and not to expensive for an RIS, I enjoyed this one."
"2011 batch poured on tap into tulip at sd toronados. Jet black with a milk chocolate ring. No head. Cocoa on the nose, with maybe some coconut. Either that or I'm crazy. Subtle notes of coffee and espresso. On the tongue, coffee is more pronounced, cocoa hits you in the back and in the after taste. Overall, well balanced, good year for the RIS. I definitely would drink again, and I will indubitably age."
"Overall a great representation of an Imperial Russian Stout. I would drink this beer 100 times over. I recommend putting a few in the cellar to let the alcohol mellow out. Search this RIS out. It is worth it."
"D: purchased the bottle this week and was labeled as a 2010 release. definitely excited to get a little age on this one. glues to the palate. gonna finish the rest of this bomber with a cigar. should be the perfect after dinner match."
"Quite a good Imperial Russian Stout with a good bit of complexity of flavors. Well worth a taste."
"O- Just a touch alcohol hot right now, but I'm gonna age a few of these. Really nice roasty coffee, chocolate and licorice flavors."
"I will have to age as the alcohol was a bit much."
"Overall: For one of my first intrusions into the world of stout brews, this one is delightfully complex, bold and infinitely better than the common Stout. The flavor is complex and dynamic and left me wanting more. Well carbonated and easy-drinking for a stout, despite the presence of alcohol in the nose and taste. Pleasant to the finish. I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in knowing what an American-style stout can taste like."
"This excellent stout has a great rich looking blackness with a dark rich head that slowly dissipates. The aromas of bittersweet chocolate hit you as you take your first sip. The mouthfeel is thick though not strongly overpowering. The taste is a full bodied dark chocolate with hints of cocoa, with a slight bitterness on the finish that works well with the loaded fries at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY."
"A great beer! Stone is famous for it's hop heavy brews, but this one showcases the malt. The thickness and the ABV slow you down a bit, but this is not a hard drinker in the least! It's a sipper that demands respect."
"Very good stout, very smooth and drinkable. Not sure why it took me so long to try this."
"Tasted a 2008 vintage. Nose is mellowed as has its taste-- really balanced, sublime. Slightly spicy, malty, the hops are tempered but not absent. Some burnt caramel. The Stone RIS series ages *magnificently*, even 6-8 months."
"Overall - I have always loved Stones beers, a long time fan of Arrogant Bastard but this is the best beer I have had in a long time, it's definately on my top 3."
"Overall, wow, this beer actually lived up to the hype, its miles better than the odd year belgo version. I'm going to go back and buy a case of this. Amazing beer."
"O: This is a great RIS in its simplest form. Not to over the top but just solid. Stone sets the industry standard with this RIS."
"overall - this is a pretty good and reasonably priced RIS ($5.49 for a 22oz)"
"D- you feel and taste the booze in this baby. Sip one and done the flavors are well integrated and there is a smoothness that bolsters the drinkability. So when I say one and done I really mean one bomber!"
"One of Stone's best, The Russian Imperial Stout poured out as a deep thick black liquid with a brown foamy head on top. The lacing was very impressive here. The smell of the beer gives of plenty of roasted malts and chocolate, some hops, and even some sweeter notes from some dark fruits. The taste of the beer is packed with a heavy amount of malts and hops. The flavors evolve into a rich piney chocolatey combo with some fermented fruit in the far distance. The mouthfeel has a great thickness to it and coats the glass and mouth really well. Overall It's a damn good beer and I enjoy it every time I have it."
"It's always awesome to be able say a beer tastes like something completely unpalatable, but mean it in a good way. Stone fans have my back when I say that this tastes like pure motor oil, and therefore is one of the best stouts I've ever tasted. This not only succeeds to be a great Russian Imp. Stout, but it also is a beer that could only come from one place: Stone. Quite an achievement."
"The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Even with the huge body and complexities, this still goes down pretty easily. Definitely a great stout, glad I was finally able to locate this."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I was shocked at how well hidden the alcohol was. It was also very well balanced, while not being overly complex."
"O - Very solid beer and for the price, quite incredible. Good dark flavors with a solid body and mouthfeel. Enjoyable beer for sure."
"Overall: A good beer that has been one of my go to RISs for a long time. The fact that it's priced very well and just kicks up a notch or two after a couple of years of aging makes it a steal. The value factor is sky high if you have the discipline to set it aside and let it cellar for a bit."
"O - Really after all this, the only thing that can be said is go find yourself a bottle"
"The beer is a pitch black with a brown filmy head that left lots of lacing. It smells of anise, wood, and hints of coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is anise, alcohol, molasses, dark fruit and piney hops. The beer is thick and smooth with soft carbonation and a dry finish. This is a great stout, it gets better and better as it warms up and it's incredibkly smooth."
"Final thought - stone, thank you. Even the price at $5 doesn't bother me. Awesome beer"
"D - Great flavor and body profile; reminds me of Dark Lord and probably as close as I'll get to DL without actually going to get a hard to find bottle"
"O - Muted flavor, more so that I would have guessed, but a good RIS."
"it's hard to knock this one. I'm not a die-hard stone fan, but damn, this one is consistently solid. and tastes excellent on tap. it just works. not mind-blowing, but it's definitely up there."
"Overall this is just an outstanding Russian Imperial. Stone continues every year to just kill it with this one. I may not be the most difficult RIS to find but it dominates many highly regarded and ultra limited releases of this style."
"Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, and sticky. Overall, this is a very good example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Very nice. Slow drinker, though."
"I recommend getting a few bottles and finding it on tap."
"Overall: I love it. An excellent Imperial Stout. At 10.5% alcohol, a 22 oz bottle is more than enough, but this is a great beer to spend an evening with."
"Overall this is a very impressive beer, and one I highly recommend. It’s a shame I had to finish it all as I really enjoyed this and it got better and tastier as it warmed. Factor in the 10.5% ABV, and this is a highly drinkable beer that any stout and imperial stout fan should seek out and drink…immediately."
"O: A nice RIS, not very fruity, very roasty, leaning more towards cocoa than coffee in taste profile."
"O - An helluva imperial stout. One of the best I have had. Alcohol is definitely present, but its not overwhelming which I find alot of in this style. And I repeat, ""so damn smooth""!"
"Poured a slow to emerge 2"" rootbeer-like head. The body is dark as coffee. Smell has chocolate, coffee, malt. Taste is more of the same but the chocolate is more on the milk chocolate side and there's also a sour rye bread component. Long satisfying finish. The high alcohol is extremely noticeable, and yes being an Imperial it's supposed to be there but this one burns almost like shots of whiskey are in it."
"O: A definite treat. The complexity of the flavor blend makes this brew excellent. A definite A-list."
"Magnificent beer and RIS, truly one of the very best I've enjoyed. A great, complex RIS, Stone has created one of the all-time great beers, and one of the 2 or 3 best stouts on my radar. A superlative achievement."
"Between the two brews, I prefer this one fresh. Don't get me wrong, both are amazing and a year adds some pleasant changes to the brew but the coffee has faded since the early spring '10 release. Both acquire the features that i seek out when looking for an Imperial Stout. BOOM!"
"This beer pours pitch black with a nice light brown head. the smell is roasty with a hint of booze. the taste follows the smell with huge roasty malt presence followed by a little boozey heat. the mouthfeel is semi thick but not overly thick. overall a very good representation of the style"
"Overall, this is a fine big stout, a steal at $6.99 a bomber, with no chinks in its armor. It isn't quite my favorite RIS, but it's right up there."
"Total repeat buy. I blended a bit with Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen this go around and it's drinking great."
"EXCELLENT, MUST TRY!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- This is my first crack at this beer, and it's definitely lived up to its hype. Simply World Class all the way. If you have a chance to pick this beer up, RUN to the store and buy as many as you can afford. It's that good. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a pretty much as good as it gets for an IRS. It's rich, deluxe, endlessly roasty and excellently balanced. I attacked this one with high expectations and it certainly didn't disappoint."
"2011 release pours a deep dark black with a half inch thick, creamy, dark tan head. Lacing is thick with great retention. Aroma is earthy, of roasted nuts, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, some hops, malts, and a bit of smoke. Mouthfeel is thick, heavy. Taste is a combination of the aromas, with more emphasis on smoke and roasted nuts. There is a hint of a metallic flavor there. Overall, this is fantastic. Truly this is my favorite RIS."
"$6.50 a bomber."
"It's Stone IRS season and I had this on tap at Goat Hill Tavern in Costa Mesa after a first round of Stone vanilla bean infused porter. I reviewed this year's bottle release last week and was happy to get to try it on tap so soon after. There were clearly noticeable differences. For one thing the taste was more grainy/malty and nutty. The mouthfeel was lighter, more dry, and rather moussey--less syrupy than the bottled version. The lovely stout roastiness was dominant, of course; but overall, I'd say the taste was slightly weaker. Still, this is a terrific beer."
"Overall a nice Russian Imperial Stout not the best, needs a little more body and I prefer a little more bitter taste for a stout."
"Pours a nice motor oil color and consistency, typical with the style. Little hint of dark fruit as i let it sit for 10 minutes to catch all the flavor. Wonderful dark malt taste that RIS always have, what makes it one of my fav stlyes of beer. No need for hops in these brews, that's what DIPA are for. Probably needs to sit a little while, prob gonna have the 09 soon, lets see how that compares to this fresh one."
"This is quite a disappointment but it's so far the biggest char tasting Russian Imperial I've had to date. However, it seems like I've had so many better ones before I just can't see what the big deal is. Where's the variety? Where's the punch? Where's the body? Where is that so called angry Stone kick? Not here... this is not for me at all."
"***Perhaps it was on sale, you saved two bucks...Now you can go by yourself a butt-wiper!!"
"BOTTLE: 22oz."
"O: I had fairly lofty expectations going into this, but also realized that I shouldn't put it up against the BCBS of the world. I got what I expected, a very well crafted RIS with a lot of similarities to the Yeti. Huge chocolate, good amount of sweetness, a little alcohol warmth in the back of mouth, well balanced, no off flavors, and the hop presence is at a minimum at this point. It's less than amazing, but probably more than just great. For it's price point, there aren't many better."
"O: this is an amazing beer from a great brewery, the price tag and ease in access make it even better, any way you name it RIS or IRS it's a great brew!"
"O - Overall, I love this beer. One of my favorite breweries as well."
"O: A nice example of the style, though it doesn't have enough of a unique characteristic to it for me to fall in love with it. Still, a great buy if you want to try a nice RIS."
"Creamy, smooth, full bodied. Awesome well balanced stout."
"O: Overall this is a pretty good Russian imperial stout, nothing special, but not bad by any means. Standard dark malt with hints of hops, but lacks the nice chocolate and coffee notes that I like in a big stout."
"O: Overall, I’m not really sure how I feel about this beer. It looks good, smells great, and has very good flavors in the early initial and on the finish of the beer. Unfortunately, the majority of the drink is held hostage by the inability to hide the high ABV. It certainly doesn’t ruin the beer, but it does make a potentially excellent beer, simple good."
"Bitter burnt coffee flavor is most prominent when sipping. It subsides and roasted malt shine through, along with dark chocolate, a little bit of malty sweetness followed by a warm, bitter finish. Medium bodied for the style, with low but active carbonation. I'm not sure if it's the batch, the serving style, or just the age, but this was not as good as I normally expect from Stone IRS."
"O: This is an excellent IRS, and perhaps the best I have had that isn't barrel aged. The aroma is really something to experience, and really impressed me. I wish this beer was available year round so that I could make it my go-to IRS."
"That sort of deterred my overall rating of this beer. While it was so very good, it was somewhat less than I anticipated"
"Overall this is a delightful example of an imperial stout and I can only hope that I can find more then the three bottles I was able to find. Enjoy!!!"
"O- Smooth almost on a whiskey level ; Huge complex flavors, can't go wrong here."
"O: Another solid imperial stout from stone at a very attractive price point."
"O: This is a yummy beer. I thought it would be stronger because of the initial ""earthy"" smell, but the whole experience was like that magical gum in Willy Wonka that made Violet turn into a giant blueberry...What I'm trying to say was, this beer tastes like a series of good foods. Highly recommend."
"D/O: After North Coast's Old Rasputin, Stone's Spring seasonal imperial stout is one of the more common, approachable, and affordable renditions of the style available in the bottle. It offers the hallmark qualities of an imperial stout, but is doubly harsh on the palate due to acidity and booziness. At one year old this beer doesn't have the freshly-hopped qualities of a new bottle, but smoke and dark fruit are more pronounced."
"Overall - I think this is a great example of what an IRS is supposed to be. It is dark, full of flavor especially from some serious malt, with a nice hint of anise tossed in for good measure. I am sure there are better IRS out there, but I haven't had them."
"well it's a big stout. shockingly drinkable for how big the stout is - clearing 10.5% ABV without a hint of being hot until it warms up a bit. it's lighter than a lot of russian imperial stouts i have had, but not too light as to be problematic. i have heard this stout be considered the ""benchmark"" for russian imperial stouts (in the same way samuel smith's oatmeal stout is for that kind of beer) and i can definitely see why."
"D-Very easy drinking for the ABV and a very delicious stout. This will definitely be a go to RIS for me in the future at a decent price-point."
"Overall one of the best RIS I have ever had, taste is amazing and the mouthfeel and body are just right"
"2011 vintage pours a pitch black with a thick two fingers of espresso crema colored head with sticky curtains left in its wake. Nose has some sweet vanilla chocolate, dark roasted coffee, baking spices and roasted malt. Taste brings molasses, bitter coffee, dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and almost a ytannic quality. Nice carbonation and the abv is not very noticeable but i do find this to be almost astrigent slightly hurting its performance at the finish."
"Poured out of a bottle on a hot day, so not ideal glassware and pretty much went from too cold to too warm for me pretty quickly. Still definitely enjoyed and will track down again."
"O: Every time I have this beer it seems a little more special to me. So distinctly an RIS but also terribly unique and without any of the typical pitfalls of RIS. A drink I hope to revisit multiple times over years to come. Easily one of Stone's best contributions to any style."
"Excellent beer. Just like most other Stone brews."
"O: Stone Brewing does impress me here, the thought that this was going to disappear in the ""odd"" year release of the belgo version makes me teary eyed. This is way too good to be gone for extended period of time. I would say of their many offerings, this has got to be one of the biggest ships in their fleet. Barrel aged variations of this boat could yield a whale for many years to come. Highly enjoyable IRS with a drinkability that is taste driven. Impressive and worthy of revisits. be sure to check the bottle to remind yourself this is a 10.5% ABV beverage. it's there, don't deny it."
"i will need a couple more bottles of this..."
"This year's brew, poured into a snifter. Pours an oily black with 3 fingers of chocolate brown head. Smells like an RIS, I don't really pick up anything novel, but that might be my weak sense of smell. The taste is solid, dark and malty, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Though the high ABV doesn't initially present itself, it makes itself known on the finish, leaving a tingling warmness in my mouth and throat. All in all a solid RIS."
"Stone IRS succeeds as a bold, assertive example of the style, all the while exhibiting class. It's excellently constructed and maintains composure throughout. Ages well, too; righteous."
"Bottom line, TRY THIS BREW, CELLAR AT LEAST 2!"
"O: I think this is definitely worth the wait from the last years batch. I've been suggesting this to customers at my job and they've been buying it. It's a great stout for $5.99 so thank you Stone for not price gouging. I just threw another one into the cellar so I can't wait to see how it improves down the line."
"o-Best RIS I have ever had the opportunity to have. I am glad I have a case of these to cellar over the years. What a beer experience."
"Overall: Quite an interesting take on the RIS style. Roasted malts backed with a huge amount of hops."
"D: This is a solid overall beer, a lot of hype surrounding it but it lives up to it for the most part. It's different from the ordinary RIS but I wouldn't expect anything less from Stone. Although it's 10.5%, it's hardly noticeable and highly drinkable."
"Overall, another solid offering from Stone. Nothing that really wow's me, but very solid and would definitely buy again when I'm in the mood for an RIS."
"O - Overall a really good ris. No complaints except for it goes to quickly. Gonna age one to see how it changes."
"Drinkability was good but limited with high ABV and signs of warmth. Great blend of flavors."
"O: Overall, enjoyable. I consider it to be a slightly above average IRS, but considering the price point and availability, it is worth grabbing several of these and revisiting every 6 months to a year to see how they develop. There have been far better batches of this in the past, but with Stone's rapid expansion, it only makes sense that the quality of there beer suffers a little. Cheers to business expansion, boo to decline in quality of product."
"Considering how big this beer is, it has a very nice mouthfeel with a nice aftertaste. Delicious. Overall, this is still one of my favorite beers, though I think it had a stronger taste in previous years. Can't wait to see how this ages and develops. Cheers!"
"Cheers"
"Overall: I haven't had this beer for a few years and my palate has developed quite a bit since I last drank it, but I am glad to see I still think it is delicious. I am looking forward to the two bottles of this vintage I am cellaring. Delicious beer and another hit by Stone. I should also note that the price only adds to how great this beer is. At 7.99 for a bomber in a market where you should expect to spend over 10 for a bomber of anything and much more for an imperial stout, this is an amazing deal. Cheers!"
"The creaminess in the mouthfeel makes this a winner. Good flavors all around though. I will definitely get this again."
"Full body, slick and oily with a bit too much prickly carbonation on the tongue. Drinks pretty good right now and is a great value for such a big beer at less than six bucks for a bomber. I think some of the burnt and char notes should smooth out with some age."
"O – Very well balanced, with great flavors. A real gem. As long I’ve lived in San Diego this is my first time trying this beer, and it jumped up into my top 5 IRS."
"Must have top 10 beer of all time. Awesome."
"O: Good offering, Stone's dialed this one in. I could drink this a couple times a week, even here in summer."
"Overall I must say that I feel very lucky to live on the West side of the country and have pretty easy access to this. I have '10 in my fridge and will cellar quite a few of these so maybe I can have some friends over and do some type of a vertical some day. I like this one as it is, but I'm sure it will change for the better, with age, like the rest of the vintages."
"Overall - Simply delicious. A beacon of RIS. Full of flavor that even tastes good on a summery day. Bravo."
"I am not given to drinking stouts, but this is exceptional. The new batch for 2011 has just been released, and I'm looking forward to purchasing another half dozen for the appropriate moments."
"Overall I will hold onto the other bottle I have for a bit since I know it drinks awesome after a few years. Will try my best to keep it in the fridge till then, but for a hop forward RIS this is still one of the better ones I have had."
"Black beer with a small brown head that didn't retain for long and left a few random dots. It smells of roasted malts with some dark fruits and some charred wood. Taste is the same, but tastes a little bit sweeter. This beer was pretty easy to get down at 10% and something I'd like to have on a regular basis."
"O - this is a very good RI stout, i can't wait to have the 2011 version to compare it to,(editing had the fresh version 7/6/11 and the one year old makes it a stand out of the style 2years??) i feel like ill being getting a few of those to put away, getting back to the 2010, i feel like next year it will be amazing, and also with most stouts i enjoy vanilla hints that i wouldn't mind with this one, just sayin...other than that this one was awesome and i could of had the entire bottle no doubt."
"This beer was great. Smooth, creamy, very chocolatey with good heat and bitter bitter hops and coffee. Be sure to have some mints handy after drinking this one. The hop dragon/coffee breath is strong enough to kill a toddler. No big deal... their not worthy"
"Stone IRS pours a solid and complete black, with a small bit of tan foam serving as a cap on the beer. There's also a bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose is incredible, a near perfect blend of rich chocolate, sweet, dark fruits, and a touch of tobacco. That great balance is lost in the flavor thought as the herbal taste of tobacco, and a bit of wet cardboard oxidation become a bit too prominent in the flavor blend. Milk chocolate as well as plums and figs and the like are still present, but a bit more subdued. There's also an unexpected but welcome espresso flourish to close things out. The mouthfeel is porbably the low point of this beer, as the body is too thin, and crosses the line into watery. At the same time, the beer is a bit undercarbonated. I've had experiences with less aged versions of Stone IRS in the past that I enjoyed a little bit more than this one, 2007's batch may have already peaked."
"O. The high ABV only hints its presence at the end of the tasting. It is not so pervasive that it turns you off to this nice beer. The flavors work very well with each other and create a beer that will keep the fan of this style happy."
"D/O - Booze is trumped by all the wonderful flavors, and it's dangerously drinkable. This has always been my favorite RIS, and this years may even be better..."
"O: An excellent Russian Imperial Stout, definitely one of my favorites. I think the 3-year old SRIS aged very well, too bad I don't have another one."
"Overall I had high expectations for this beer and I'm happy to say that it met my expecations. I am going to pick up several more bottles for the cellar to enjoy as it ages."
"The mouthfeel is smooth at first, but the drying character at the end reveals a surprisingly high level of carbonation. It's also a bit thin for the taste and alcohol content. The drinkability is fairly good. Overall, this is a solid imperial stout. It's not the best around, but it's quite enjoyable and well-priced."
"Overall: A must try for any craft beer fan Stone hit this one out of the park! If you love Imperial stouts I know your going to love this. A really great example of a Russian Imperial stout. Cheers to Stone for this Great brew."
"Full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well without being overly sticky. The great carbonation lends itself to an almost creaminess that allows for great drinkability without interfering with the flavors."
"Pours pitch black, with a foamy brown head. Sticky lace, medium retention. Nose has some roasted malt qualities, dark chocolate, dark fruits (black currant, as the bottle suggests?), brown sugar and some vanilla sweetness. Taste has the sweet dark fruit initially, before the brown sugar and bitter chocolate come through along with some alcohol warmth. Slight burn in the throat comes with this. Great complexity within this, and balance between the components. Bitter roast in the finish which lingers immensely. Mouthfeel is ideal, as is the carbonation at a medium low level. A bench mark for the style."
"O - There is a reason that this is considered one of the best and most balanced RIS. The malts are the golden star in this beer and their roasted to a T. Love this beer and it only develops with time."
"O: What is there else to say? This is one of the best, if not the very best imperial stout I've ever had (tied with 6 month old Péché Mortel). Superbly drinkable. Also, since this beer is so cheap, so easy to get and so good, I really don't see how anyone who like stouts never have tried this before. World class."
"Another great brew from Stone. It's extremely thick, so this may not be the best choice for hot weather. Personally, I like it. Very good in all categories. Beautiful appearance and mouthfeel. Very solid with the aroam and flavor. Flavors and aroamas settled a bit after it warmed. Still well balanced and more than adequate for the style. I picked up an extra bottle to cellar for a while."
"Pours like oil after being used for 3000 miles. Great, thick brown head of three fingers, with lace the clings like glue. Color...well black... a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is rich and sweet, with aromas of dark roasted coffee, roasted wheat and corn, molasses, toffee, and cranberries. Taste is very complex and wonderful. There are flavors of coffee, chocolate, toffee, molasses, cranberries, licorice, prune, and a slight dash of citrus. Mouthfeel is thick like heavy cream, slightly drying feel in the back of my upper palate. This beer sneaks up on you like a tiger, and the alcohol kicks your butt. From the first good swig, you feel the warming and it is a downhill rush after that. One at a sitting is surely enough, but the flavor is saying give me more."
"2009 Vintage into a Duvel tulip. Pours an oily black liquid that leaves a nice 2 finger beige head with no lacing. The nose is dark fruit, chocolate, coffee and some licorice at the end. The taste is amazing: Layers of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and again the licorice bringing up the rear. The mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety; the alcohol presents a slight burn but nothing to scream about. I would compare this beverage to a tasty alcohol-tinged chocolate cake. Overall, a great RIS which benefits with age. I have no doubt this would go great paired with a chocolate dessert - I'm thinking Chocolate Moose with a Stone IRS Bomber - MMM!"
"O: Amazing beer. I can only image what another year or two would do to the complexity."
"D – Nice representation of an Imperial Russian Stout. Liked it and would recommend trying. Glad I let it age for 2 years."
"D: This is one heck of a great beverage, from a brewery that certainly knows whats going on. I could very well sip several of these in an evening. I definitely recommend this to RIS lovers and dark chocolate lovers alike."
"A perfect brew for a cold night or around the campfire. The alcohol sweeteness becomes dominating towards the end of the bomber but besides that its a well balanced, exceptional example of the style. Another win for Stone."
"Great work from Stone and a perfect time to get it right, as i recently sampled Arrogant Bastard and was not very impressed."
"D/O: Very drinkable and delicious... 10.5%??! Hard to believe."
"Well done Stone. This is easily my favorite beer from this brewer so far. Zero alcohol detection in both aroma and taste. Balanced yet powerfully-flavorful. Not overbearing on the palate. Just a well-executed beer in every aspect."
"Overall: Nearly perfect...the last time I had this, I don't remember it being so pungent...perhaps I had better let the beer warm up a touch next time (it came out of the fridge...I usually cellar it for a while)...there may be another review of this soon."
"This is one big stout."
"Overall: A very rich beer and I was glad to have the bomber but like Founder's breakfast stout it is nowhere near as delicious as the Belgian De Struise stouts."
"O - A phenomenal work of craftsmanship. I can honestly say that this is quickly becoming one of my absolute favorites. And for about $7 a pint, what's more to love?"
"07 on tap at The Gate for the Stone event. Delicious and only $7/pint..Hells yes please. Angry and black it pours with a dark brown head, roast and alcohol dominate with some hop aroma, very faded, a little smoke, a little coffee. Very tasty, aromas a little faded, and a little surprising how dominant the alcohol still was in this one 3 years later. Damn good, and another reminder of the continued excellence of these SoCal cats."
"Overall- Great RIS, or should I say IRS. The nose is a bit muted but besides for that it is right on par with some of the best in the world. The cheaper price point for these bombers makes it a very attractive option."
"D - good for a stout, but seemed like it would benefit from a bit of aging. definitely a sipper in its current state. i couldn't finish this by myself. i will try an 09 bottle soon to see if aging will make a difference."
"Scores: Appearance 5/5, Aroma 3/5, Taste 4/5, Mouthfeel 4.5/5, Overall 5/5"
"2008 - Had a similar initial taste as the 2006, but the flavor ended too quickly and lightly. There's a smokiness that kicks in halfway, but everything seems to drop off prematurely. Leaving a lingering bitterness at the end. Rating=4."
"D: Drinkability is through the roof! An exceptional stout."
"Overall the 2011 is still just as good as the 2010, and it is still one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts you can find."
"One of the better ones in the style. It's good and almost great. The only things that comes to mind is that this beer is missing something that makes it stand out. Still: RECOMENDED"
"The mouthfeel is medium and silky smooth. Overall, a superior RIS."
"Taste - at first sip I get tons of semi-sweet chocolate. After a few sips it settles in to bitter chocolate up front with a semi- chocolate finish. A little more carbonation than I prefer but over all really well done."
"Drinkability - I have a newfound respect for Stone. This is a well-done beer. The density and complexity is worthy of it's ranking in the pantheon of ""Beers of Fame""."
"Atmosphere is really good. Dark, formidable appearance, with a nice foamy head. Nose is a really great combination of grain, coffee with bitter and sweet spice components. Flavor is hearty malt with a pungent and bittersweet profile. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"M - No booze in the finish at all. Medium bodied with a great smoothness."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. A solid RIS but nothing revolutionary. A bit on the thinner side of the style with a noticeable emphasis on the more fruity side of the taste. An interesting take, for sure, and a great beer for its availability and price."
"Drinkability - Wow is all I can say - Nice creamy RIS with great flavors that blend together well - still a bit hot but I'm not complaining. Thanks again Tilley4 - you seen I had this on my wants and threw it in as an extra -you'r the man."
"Drinkability - Quaffable for sure. Can't wait to open up the 2008 I have. Very little alcohol warming. Delicious."
"D - Very high. I have always loved this beer and I would even say it is one of my all time favorites. You would be hard pressed to find a better beer for your money."
"22oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 2010 vintage. I wasn't planning on aging this bottle this. I actually prefer this one fresh. I will review it again when this year's release comes out. Pours pitch black with two fingers of roasted brown, frothy head. Decent lacing. Nose is mainly roasted coffee and brown sugar malt with nice cocoa and dark chocolate notes. A hint of alcohol can be detected as well. Very rich and full bodied mouthfeel but not too heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is right where it needs to be for the style. Malty sweet on the palate with a slight hint of alcohol. Bittersweet chocolate throughout, with a coffee and cream finish. The hops aren't quite gone either, keeping it from being too sweet and malty. Very drinkable for such a big beer. I haven't had this in a couple of years and it is still one of my faves. As much as I like this aged bottle, I can't wait to pick up a fresh one soon."
"Very drinkable/sippable beer. Good on a winter's night, better as it warms up a bit in the glass."
"M/D: Definitely fuller bodied, very creamy, and no trace of the alcohol after sitting for a couple of years. Overall, one of the best in the style I have had. Going to head and out and pick some up to age I think."
"Pours a used motor oil black with a 1 inch dark brown head that fades to a very small cap. You cannot see through this beer whatsoever when it's held up to the light. Thick ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, rich espresso, dark chocolate, and cinnamon. Taste is perfect with roasted malts and coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, and faint soy sauce. There is a delightful bittersweet finish that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Carbonation is good but it seems a bit flat overall. Thick and creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is beyond exceptional. I am very happy I have been able to try their 5+ year aged IRS. Very sad I only got a liter of this beer. Hopefully some of the bottles I have aging in my cellar will taste this good one day."
"22oz bottle with ""Limited Spring 2010 Release"". Pours an in need of an oil change black with a tan head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is of chocolate, smokiness, coffee, and roasted malts. Taste is a mix of boozey roasted malts and chocolate. Smokey flavor throughout. Slight coffee flavor. This is one heavy brew. Alcohol flavor is present but not overly abusive. Nice burn. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts out there."
"A remarkably drinkable and complex RIS. This beer does so many things so perfectly. A true marvel. Bravo!"
"This is what an imperial stout should be!"
"Both pour very dark. 2010 has lots of head. 2006 has almost none. Both have reddish tints. Both smell roasty and dark with chocolate on the nose. Fairly non descript on the nose. Tastes sweet and bitter for both vintages. 2010 is sharp and bitter. The 2006 vintage is really smooth and rich. The chocolate blends well with the roast. This one ages super well! Thick solid mouthfeel. Vry drinkable"
"D- Sweet, molasses, very well balanced with all the tastes and aromas that hit your nose. Smooth easy drink especially for the high abv. Fruitiness and sweetness stand out for this stout. I truly enjoyed this gem, excellent beer."
"D: Big and flavorful, this is certainly a tasty and well crafted brew. I couldn't imagine finishing more than a bottle and again that would likely be the only beer of the night. I was a tad disappointed by the character of soy that kept popping up in the aroma which put a damper of a sorts on the experience."
"Upon my first sip I immediately noticed that 10.5% ABV the beer has. Let me tell you after drinking it all I was ready for some sleep! After the initial alcohol taste came the coffee, malty sweetness and smoothness, and dark cocoa. I thought it would have a bit more flavor to it because of the impressive aroma but in all this was a good imperial Russian stout, being in-your-face."
"Final thoughts: This is a great example of what an imperial stout can be. At under 8 dollars for a22 OZ bottle this beer is a steal. Imperial stout bombers are usually well over ten dollars. If SRIS was over ten dollars I would have to reconsider how much of it to consume, but at this price it is a joy to have this beer and feel like I have made a great purchase every time!!!"
"I can only imagine what this could do with some age. I will definitely pick up a few of these to age and do a vertical. Easily one of the best RIS that I have had."
"Overall Stone RIS is thick and rich, with tons of character and flavor. It can be quite boozy if fresh, so ""hibernate"" one for a year or two and it should mellow out nicely. Best shared with a friend or family member in a sippin' glass or, for a ""knock-out"" treat, pour some over vanilla ice cream to cap off a nice meal. Yum!"
"Notes: It's wonderfully complex and well rounded. Overall outstanding!!!"
"D- Very drinkable RIS. Good flavors, nothing spectacular, but a really good RIS. This is a good one to have when not wanting to crack open something to special, but still enjoy a nice big beer."
"D: This is a wonderful anytime beer (assuming you like stouts at anytime as I do). I will be scouting older stores for some vintage bottles."
"Overall, Stone IRS is a staple that every brewer should base their RIS' off of. True to the style, and the American twist with the hops that every brewery is copying today. At #13 in the top ten and over 2000 reviews, this brew is not going anywhere."
"Pours jet black with a medium brown head. In the aroma, coffee, scorched malt, dark fruit, a big alcohol punch, and a bunch of hops.I the taste, malty, floral and sweet, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and grassy hops. A hop bite and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, roasty malt, small hop and alcohol aftertaste. A monster of an imperial stout, a nice sipper to keep the cold out."
"D - I know there was controversy over the change this year to belgian yeast. Clearly they also changed the base recipe as well. While I am stoked to try the belgian one, I don't think I'll be aging this years version."
"Dangerously drinkable beer for a stout of it's size. Obviously not a beer that is anything you would want to have multiple of but taking a couple hours to enjoy a bomber is very enjoyable."
"D- Fucking great! This is a perfect example of an imperial stout. I cannot wait to have this again another night."
"D: This beer tastes great, is complex and interesting, and is wonderfully balanced. All in all a great recipe for high drinkability."
"This is my first brew by Stone and I am impressed. This beer is dark, complex and goes down smooth. Definitely recommend."
"D - One of the best, most proven RISs out there. Delicious"
"O- This beer is great. I love it fresh and it only gets better with age. I need to grab a bunch more of these and lay em down. 4"
"Drinkability is good, I'm going to have no problem drinking the bomber, just too much alcohol is apparent in this beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Don't know if it's the best RIS out there, but very, very enjoyable."
"D: One glass of this is enjoyable, but it doesn't particularly keep me wanting more immediately. Perhaps a little too sweet to be an all-night beer, but definitely worth trying and one that I'll be returning to."
"Taste: Complex assortment of chocolate and coffee roasted malts. Hop bitterness definitely comes out more here than in the nose and nicely complements the rich malt backbone. Alcohol is barely evident, which greatly adds to the drinkability. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, despite the fact this one's been sitting on the shelf for well over a year. Very impressive offering from Stone."
"D - I was looking forward to cracking open an aged bottle of this, and it did not disappoint. Flavors are clean and easy to identify, but yet does not fail to be complex in it's simplicity."
"A slight knock against the stronger Stone beers I've had, the alcohol flavor isn't as hidden as I like. But overall still a damn good flavor."
"2006 vintage at a stone event in cincy at lackmans"
"It's an intense experience, but if I had access to more, it'd be enjoyed again and again."
"Drinkability - I normally like the fresh (4-4.5) but with 2-3 years, it is fantastic."
"Ferocious drinkability for a 10.5% RIS. One less touch of bitter makes it a 5."
"As far as Stone's brew, I think I almost enjoy smelling this beer more than I enjoy drinking it. That big wallop of roasted barley is just amazing. I would like to get my hands on an oaked version."
"Overall impression: This beer ages like a champ, but it's damned good fresh as well. Top notch."
"Pours pitch black. As black as any beer I've seen. Medium, fizzy brown head that is lively while it lasts but doesn't last long, although the beer remains bubbly much longer. Intense chocolate aroma mixed with raisin and dark, fruity notes. Some booziness in there too, especially as it all warms. Lots of chocolate flavor here too; thick and sweet but not cloying. Raisin and plum fruit. Some roasted barley but mostly this is smooth and sweet not bitter or rough at all. Medium booziness here too although it adds to the experience. Full body; on the high side of viscosity."
"d - This is a great RIS. it is one of the best easily available RIS's out there. will definitely have again."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a classic RIS along with Old Rasputin and a few others that are reasonably priced, easy to get and always tasty. With almost 3 years on this beer the heat has dropped out and the overall feel is super smooth. The flavors have melded together nicely, but may be slightly muted. I've still got another '08, and based on this one, I think this beer can still go a few more years. That being said, I'm not sure if I like an aged version of this beer anymore than I do fresh, but if you're looking for something that drinks a little more easily and isn't in your face with intense flavors, then definitely lay a few down for 2-3 years, or more. Cheers Stone for making this awesome brew each year. It's one brew that I always look forward to."
"The CPJ"
"I wanted an above average beer all day and to go to a local spot I haven't been to in a while that has a great draft and bottle list. I got what I came for and stone didn't disappoint."
"Drink- Well done stout that is as it was for the easiest stout to start with being from Stone and having that name behind it."
"Now that I've had 6-8 sips since typing this review...it has just gotten better and better. I don't like drinking my beers warm, so I poured this at what I guessed what 50ish degree's if not warmer...its more mellow and fun to sip."
"I have waited one year to try this beer. So upon finding this beer I was excited and boy did this beer not let me down. Fantastic! This is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that I have tried. The full on roast flavor is so rich that this beer is a dessert to any pallet. Another great beer by Stone!"
"10.50% ABV. Poured from 750ml bottle into a pint glass. I've had this one quite a few times, just now getting around to rating it. Pours an inky black color with a rocky tan head absolutely beautiful. Aroma of chocolate and roasted coffee, with some alcohol. Flavor follows the aroma, with a nice chocolate backbone that holds flavors of roasted malts and coffee, as well as hints of dark fruits. A good RIS for those who shy away from it. Insane beer indeed."
"D - Well it's +10% so after the first don't try getting another bomber, but it's a very drinkable brew and if my liver was larger I'd keep going."
"Drinkability: Ultimately smooth, and the flavors blend really well together. The only issue is really the strong coffee aftertaste. I will definitely look out for this every Spring."
"d- booze is definitely there, a tinge of heat as it warms. that being said, the taste makes this dangerously drinkable"
"Excellent beer."
"Overall, a high quality sipping brew. Just a tad too much of that molasses sweetness. I prefer the Old Rasputin, same thick quality, but more roasty than sweet"
"Drinkable. Most certainly a sipper."
"This lives up to the ratings its been getting for years. Very approachable yet complex."
"This is a pretty darn drinkable American RIS, and it is no wonder it is so popular. While it is a big beer and I often end up drinking it quite slowly, I feel like I need to bump up the drinkability a bit because this is a beer that I seem to end up picking up from time to time because I know it will be an enjoyable drinking experience. This is a classic beer and highly recommended."
"Very easy beer to find where I live and I will pick up several 2010 bottles to enjoy next year."
"I could drink this all night, well until I fell down at least! the abv is a bit intimadating."
"I could not believe that I hadn't rated this yet, as it's one of the best RIS that I have had. I will definitely buy this again and again."
"D - Great RIS, great brew period. Sip and sip well, because this one will sneak up on you."
"Drinks very well for the 10.5%. I've had quite a few RIS's lately and this is definitely one of my favorites. (P.S.- why they gotta be different and be an IRS instead of an RIS?)"
"Drinkability, oh I could drink some more of these! An excellent RIS, a style I haven't been drinking lately but I think that's about to change for the rest of the season!"
"I think the age diminished much of the hop character quite a bit. West coast imperial stouts are always too damn hoppy in my opinion, so I'm glad I put some age on it. Not the best RIS but still very good. Recommended."
"d. i could drink this all night. thanks stone!"
"D: This is good; wish I'd bought more. This beer has been elusive in Nashville but I'm glad I finally tracked it down. jVery drinkable, very tasty. This will be a go-to cold weather beer for me for a long time to come."
"Coats the mouth nicely and finishes prickly on the back of the tongue with a lingering bitterness. Booziness is kept mostly in check, especially considering I recall fresh bottles being quite hot. There is, however, a mild burn that reminds you of the abv. While time has mellowed this out substantially, I feel like some of the real pop of this stout has been lost. Enjoyable, but not quite what this was or could be."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I think its a very good RIS. I would certainly try another bottle of this."
"D- a stout lover's brew, very drinkable (albiet on the strong side)- sip and enjoy!"
"Notes: Excellent. Very true to style. Somewhat delicate in taste, but very complex. A good recommendation for anyone who enjoys red wine."
"A great winter warmer, perfect as an after dinner sipper."
"This was quite enjoyable. A very solid, but not mindblowing RIS."
"This is a thick, viscous, full-bodied beer that's a definite sipper at 10.5%. Truth to be told, I was expecting a little more from Stone on this one. Russian Imperial Stout just seems a little misaligned and as I mentioned, it makes for an uneven drink. I'd like to pick up another body and lay it down for a few years to see if the rough edges are smoothed out."
"Been my favorite for years and now reviewing it. Lourdes into reidel stemless dark black little brown head. Beautiful to look into. Smells of roasty goodness. Tastes of roasty chocalte and coffe. Bitterness is there along with the alcohol. I love this beer and could put down several. My closet thanks me. Cheers"
"I'll grab a few to cellar for sure. I personally can't wait to compare it to next year's release."
"O: Great beer - better than 2010 but not quite as good as 2009."
"D - nice RIS. For as bitter as it is, it is very drinkable but a strong sipper."
"D- My first offering from Stone, certainly not my last. Possibly the best stout I've ever had. I have been looking forward to trying this for awhile now and was not let down at all. I deffinitely would like to get a case of this in the future, and open one every 3-6 months like it suggests. Dont believe the line on the bottle ""we guarantee that no sin was committed in the production of this seemingly pernicious brew", Stone deffinitely struck a deal with the devil on this one."
"Drinkability: Not hard to drink at all. In fact, hard to not drink it all too fast before it warmed and got complex. Little bummed I drank it too fast, two years to age, 15mins to go down the hatch even while typing, LOL. But an all around excellent brew. I think '08 was a great year for Stone's Russian Imperial, right in there behind '05 and '02."
"D:Stone says to open one of these every 6 months and see how it develops, well this one is about 18 months old and its doing great!! Great flavors coming thru with a crazy easy drink for ABV since you can't even feel or taste it. Hands down one of the best RIS brews I have had all year."
"Great Example of a RIS. Pours very black and glugs as it comes out, thats how you know its going to be thick! 2 Finger Chocolate colored head. First sip is good can taste some of the booze and coffee up front but where this beer really shines is the aftertaste! A great coffee roasted aftertaste that leaves you wanting more and more. With an ABV of 10.5 I had one, and probably could have shared it with another person. Once again a great example of what an RIS should taste like."
"Nice aromas come into the nose, dark chocolate and coffee. The sips i had were soft and somewhat sweet. Not a bad stout at all...and that's been said by a stout critic."
"Drinkabily - On these cold winter nights, this is totally what you need to get you through the nights. A 22ozer is perfect to enjoy this. Its strong so be careful. Its really drinkabily being 10.5%. Id rank it higher if it wasnt so high alcohol. Fantastic, what you want in a imperial stout. One of the best"
"O: This is still definitely one of my favorite beers. Just so amazingly complex and somehow too easy to finish. Now, I need to try the anise odd year version and see how it stacks up"
"looks like a stout with but with a quickly disappearing head. the smell is sweet with chocolate and roast malt notes. the taste is mildly chocolate, with a hint of bitterness. sweetness is subdued and is a bit drier than expected. the alcohol is definitely in forefront but not unpleasant. adds just a bit of heat. licorice in the finish. solid RIS, it's a sipper and glad I tried it. might grab a few more '10s to hang onto if I see them around, but won't go out of my way."
"Poured into a NB globe. Pitch black with a one finger light tan head that fades into a cap with excellent lacing. Smell is huge milk chocolate, some roasted malt, a hint of fresh light roast coffee and hops. Taste is a mix between sweet milk chocolate and slightly bitter hops, followed by some roasted malt and some bitter bakers chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy with a medium light carbonation. This is a very drinkable RIS. I dont remember the past years of this beer having as much chocolate flavor, but it is delicious as always."
"Medium to full bodied. Slightly bitter, finishes bitter with some booze showing through..."
"pretty high. A little boozy but not TOO bad. Easily accessible as well and not terribly expensive. Would love to try this on tap. This bottle might be a little old (got as an extra in a trade) I can see myself getting a bomber of this every once in awhile."
"This is oh-so-drinkable for how huge the flavor is and how high the alcohol content is. Simply put, I love this RIS. It was perhaps the first truly great beer that I tried, and I hold it in just as high esteem now as that first time I had it. It is a truly delicious and satisfying beer and I look forward to its release every year."
"D: Much improved over fresh, maybe too drinkable for ABV."
"A fairly dry RIS that is better as it warms. But all in all, just amazing. I loved how bold all the components were and how well they melded together like a symphony. Would love to try this with some age, one of the best RIS available."
"excellent stout"
"This is an exceptional beer. One of the best I've ever had and the best RIS I've had."
"D: Very drinkable for how thick, dark and robust of an ale this is. Not my type of brew, but man I enjoyed this one a lot!"
"But who am I kidding? This is great. Plus Stone makes it affordably, which should be its own rating when it comes to lots of RIS's on here. It's just as good as these other hard to find ones. Does it blow my mind? No. But they damn well have a right to be arrogant."
"D - Deservingly in the top 10. A really great RIS with a ton of great flavor. Slightly slower to finish since it's a bigger beer, but one that I will absolutely be drinking on a regular basis."
"The taste is right along the lines of the nose. Dark fruits. Dark roast. Some booze. All wonderfully blending together. The carbonation is right in line. Not under carbonated like some stouts. Keeps the mouthfeel from being exceedingly heavy. Very well balanced for how big it is. This beer is very drinkable and I'll love drinking the rest. I'm so happy that this is distributed in Texas and it's one of the best beers we can consistently get down here."
"I like this very much and will drink my fill of them when they are released in the summer and through the fall and winter."
"I highly recommend this beer. As a midwestern guy I feel the Western breweries tend to over hop their beers but this one is incredible and a well balanced Imperial Russian. A top 10 stout of mine for sure."
"D - This is a great go to Imperial Stout, I can drink this one on a regular basis no issue. It's stout, strong, and gets the job done the way a true Imperial Stout should."
"D: ABV on this says ""watch yourself."" but ima keep on goin with this one. Amazing Brew!"
"D: Terrifyingly outstanding. A perfect brew."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with carbonation being on the lower side. Very nice for the style and just how I like my big stouts. Drinkability is good, it was a very flavorful with a lot of very good flavors all coming together nicely. Excellent beer overall."
"D - This is perfect for a cold, stormy day in front of the fireplace. It will warm you up nicely. It hits the notes for a Imperial Russian Stout. Even though Stone gives fair warning on the bottle that it is loaded is alcohol, I would prefer a little less on the nose. Minor complaint. Excellent stout."
"goes down very easy for the alcohol in the bottle. Scary good!"
"D- Freaking fantastic! Pretty smooth for a 10.5. Might end up in the ER if you're not careful."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Perfect for a cold winter evening. I would highly recommend Stone IRS to anyone."
"Dense, huge, massive brew. It is this years' vintage and it's already very smooth... can't imagine how luscious it might be after cellaring for a year or two. I might have to find out. Highly recommended, just the kind of massive stout I've been jonesing for for quite a while."
"D - Drinks great, very balanced and complex, I can have a few but its expensive usually $7-$8 bucks a bottle. Great beer with meat or dinner, or whenever. This is one of my favorites, cant beat this brew with much else, but its ol' skool & Ive been told the recipe is from way back & there are some others with the same quality's/flavor. Thumbs WAY up!"
"I love Imperial Stouts and this is a perfect example to try and introduce to others."
"Note: 2009 release"
"You can sip on this for hours. It'll eventually get to heavy but you'll be drunk as hell by then."
"D- I will definetly stock up on this beer next spring, I am turning into a big Stone fan!"
"The taste gets even better as it warms. Awesome brew, can drink this any time. I suggest picking up a case when it becomes available."
"Drinkability- I'm going out and buying a case. I'll be drinking this all winter. This is a GREAT russian imperial stout at a very fair price."
"Felt incredibly smooth and rich in the mouth, carbonated with a wonderful chewiness to the drink. For me, this beer ranks right up near the top in the drinkability category."
"Definitely one of the sweeter RIS's that I have had.. It's also one of the thickest I've ever had. The hoppiness also is more than is found in most RIS's, even if it isn't all that permeating."
"Black colored with red hints, little light brown head. Deep, licoricy, roasted and mildly vanilla aroma, dry coffee. Medium to full bodied. Flavor is rich as well, roasted licorice notes dominate, some vanilla and bitter hops also here. One of the best Stouts ive ever had the pleasure of drinking, and its on my yearly must buy list"
"Mouth feel was smooth and creamy. Thick body allows the flavors to linger in your mouth. An excellent RIS that can best be enjoyed slowly on a cool fall or winter night."
"Highly recommended."
"Pours nearly black, very slight brownish ruby hints when held up to a light, supple beige foam, nice life. Deep aromas of charred wood, leather, fig, and a boatload of roasted malt flavors. Not overly on the chocolate or coffee, which I tend to think let's the more exotic flavors shine. First gulp is full and intense, very warming. Loads of ripeness, rich, earthy, soaked currant raisin fig fruity, nice mellow roastyness and the slightest bitter edge cutting through. Images of smoke, leather, tobacco. Milky and voluptuous the palate with a slight chewyness and surrounded by a definite heft and warmth. Perfect for ushering in the colder weather on a rainy fall night, while I wait for my landlord to turn on the damn heat. Only gets better with age for at least 2 years that I can vouch for. Don't overlook this beast due to it's lack of non-availability."
"Drinkability: An excellent stout. I'd have to try a more recent vintage to really see the effect of aging on this beer but I am glad to have tried this aged one. This is certainly something I'd recommend for aging but the temptation to drink it would certainly be great!"
"Overall, this is quite good. The only thing I would say I don't like is the smokey quality, as it gets in the way a little. Otherwise, this is a good RIS, and one I'd buy again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Very drinkable, its tastiness was hid the 10.50% ABV well and I could drink this very fast. Would recommend it to others."
"A bit light on the liquid body compared to other RIS I've had, but still a beauty. Very low the carbonation feel with a relatively moderate viscosity feel on the tongue. A definite plus is how fast I was drinking this beer - nothing was holding me back. Quite delicious. I've held onto this beer for a long time and very glad to have opened it to finally experience one of my most anticipated beers."
"This is one of my favorite stouts that can be found with any regularity. I recommend it to any fan of the style."
"Bottle. 2009 release. Pours a really dark brown almost black color with a nice 2 finger tan head. Laces on the glass as the head settles. Nice and strong roasted coffee notes along with malt and some dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Big and chewy but still not as heavy as I would like for a 10.5% abv RIS. Big roasted coffee notes in the taste. Lingering bitterness similiar to a dark coffee. Some dark fruit type tastes as well. No real evidence of the alcohol. Overall, I am pretty happy with this beer. Not overly roasty or boozy but a nice balance and a RIS that I'm sure a lot of people cold enjoy."
"A STOUT stout. Wow. This is very strong and drinkable. This is also the first Stone Brewing beer I've tried that did not have strong hops. It is fairly smooth and very strong."
"I am trying to get into the RIS style. Poured into a small tasting chalice. Black, opaque, thick. Without a super heavy pour a head is not really produced. Really thing milk infused coffee color head. Aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla, roasted barley, and finishes with grassy earthy hop notes. Maybe a little weak. Your palate is met with rich heavy cappuccino flavors, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and hops manage to cut through leaving a lingering bitterness on the tongue. This big beer manages to be dry, with just a mild bitter aftertaste. Really good body without being syrupy as I find many RIS beers to be. I sought this out and I will again. Good beer."
"This monster is dangerously drinkable for the ABV. It might be a bottle best enjoyed with company, but I am happy to say that this one is all mine!"
"D: A pretty good Imperial Stout, and I'm surprised the bitterness doesn't come from the hops knowing Stone beers, but I know this beer is heavily hopped and the bitterness from the dark chocolate still overshadows the hops here."
"Overall pretty good brew.. Just found the boozieness to be a bit high.."
"Body is respectfully full, but a great creamy feel is present from the carbonation level. The beer drinks pretty easily, with a good enough balance and flavor to hide the alcohol."
"D - Well, for being a strong RIS, it doesn't get too much better here. Definitely not one to drink all night, but I think I could easily handle a bomber to myself. Split this one tonight, and had a decent buzz going after finishing my portion (which didn't take too long...). To those who haven't tried this one: Buy It! It's definitely worth the somewhat small price tag."
"d - This is a great RIS. I've had it several times and a few different vintages and have always enjoyed it. This one being a 2004 vintage, I didn't think the extra time did too much to improve the beer, but regardless, it is one of the best easily available RIS's out there. Interested to open my 08 bottle soon to compare to, will definitely have again."
"Taste is along the same lines as the aroma. Starts with a bit of coffee, then you get punched in the face with dark fruits, and it finishes with a bit of bittersweet chocolate. Hops are not noticeable whatsoever, as they shouldn't be in a 2004 vintage. Seems to have thinned out a bit in comparison to the fresh version. Great brew."
"D - Very much yes. Need to work this into my already crowded RIS lineup."
"Going over my previous review, this beer has dried out nicely and still holds a good heat. Most of the dark fruit is gone, as are any trace of hops. It cellars great and I need to start putting more away."
"D- This is a sipper. 10.5% is no joke. Problem is this beer goes down easy. I do not enjoy really sweet boozy stouts so this beer is awesome! Classic RIS!"
"Mouthfeel is heavy and hot. At about 6 months, the alcohol hasn't really toned down too much."
"D: Deserving of the praise as one of the best Russian imperial stouts of there. Plus, it's hard to beat the price. Storing a few to see how it ages"
"Pours a super dark black with brown edges.. about a two finger fluffy tan head which dissipated quickly. Very minimal lacing, if at all. Smells of roasted malts, toffee, dark chocolate and coffee. Taste is very full, very complex.. I'm getting dark chocolate, cherry, toasted malts with a touch of bitterness. The sweetness of the malts shine overall. Very heavy, yet very drinkable. ABV is well hidden. Thoroughly enjoyable in all aspects!"
"D: medium"
"Just over all a wonderful beer, amazing blend, dark and very rich and full flavored. Would be in my opinion on the desert end."
"D: A very complex beer that straddles the line bewteen being quaffable at 10.5 abv and is equally at its own being contemplated sip by sip over an hour or two"
"D- Solid. Delicious, has a phenomenal aroma, but high alcohol content is the only drawback. Depending on how you look at it. This is up there in the best IRS I've ever had."
"D - Best RIS available for it's drinkability, complexity and affordability."
"D - a beautiful beer that drinks quite easily. I can't wait to crack one open on cold winter nights, just as I can't wait to experience a '10 next summer after its had some time to mellow out."
"D. I take a glass(or 4) every night and wake up the next day waiting for a chane to taste it again."
"D- Not much that one can do to improve this guy. this is pretty much everything an imperial stout should be. The alcohol definitely slows you down and makes it a slow drinker. But this is one that I will come back to frequently."
"D-quite the manly beer in such a large bottle. ABV is high and it hits. This beer is like a great steak dinner that you just want to keep going, and luckily due to the bomber, it keeps going until you're full."
"Overall, a nice RIS. Not my favorite, but excellent."
"Still have 7 bottles of this beer."
"Taste: Great toasted malty flavor with a little roasted bitterness that is complimented by a sweetness from the malt and something else (maybe chocolate)."
"Cheers!"
"Really loved the carbonation of this beer. Of course it's heavy, but the bright carbonation really makes it far more drinkable than the usual. It doesn't foam out into a glob on your tongue, and actually stays somewhat crisp."
"D - All around, this is a pleasant imperial stout; very nice. Of course, it would be difficult to drink too much of this with its high ABV."
"Have had this many times in bottles of different vintages, casks, and taps of different vintages. This rating is from a bottle of 2007 (from notes). Pours with a finger width, creamy brown head with a black body. Nice coffee aroma with a dash of nail polish/fusel alcohol. Taste is coffee and a lot of barely. Extremely nice creamy body, bitter hop finish. This is a great roasty, and slightly hoppy stout, with a few dark fruit esters. Alcohol is high, but I feel that it is over rated...Solid beer but not one of the best imperial stouts. I am aging a bottle for 4 years to see if it improves...I have high hopes...Right now the beer has a bit too much bitterness from the roast."
"OVERALL: I can definitely see why this is considered a classic, but don't think it measures up to some of the stouts that have followed it. A good aroma and taste profile, but certainly doesn't stand out next to some of the others on the market. A brew I'll have again if I find it, but I don't need to seek it out again. Interested to see how the other bottle ages though. Will update this review in a couple years. Thanks for this one boys."
"This is a review of the 2009 vintage of which more I will purchase to try along side it's present and future versions."
"Great stout and for the price, even sweeter."
"Oh, and to complete the mosaic (although I guess we never really mentioned painting), someone in the neighborhood has a little bonfire going, and the subtle smoke aroma is wafting through my window as I drink this masterpiece - it's called perfection, ya fool."
"D: smooth drinking, one bomber is perfect can drink one over the period of the evening and be a man."
"Overall I'm a little disappointed by the nose being too light, but the taste was great, and the whole experience of the beer was pretty nice. I need to crack my aged bottle sometime, although I think I want to keep aging it."
"D - For the alcohol content and overall thickness of this brew, it is highly drinkable. A classic for sure!"
"Excellent."
"Overall, a very tasty beer. Being 2+years old, lost viscosity and some bitterness. Also lost some carbonation and heat yet gained a more upfront roasted malt flavor."
"It's thick and it's 10.5, so you aren't drinking these all night. But boy does each wild taste make you want to. Rampage through the cathedrals with one of these to feel like a real gargoyle."
"D - Good drink before bed time to let the air out and sweet dreams."
"Excellent example of a heavy stout. Sweet malt, coffee and chocolate predominate with high alcohol level kept in check by a nice measure of hops. If I had to criticize I would say that the sweetness could be dialed back a bit, which would allow some of the more bitter flavors to come through. I've rated drinkability at a lower level because it's not one you are likely to pound back at a session, but as a single (very hard to find 12 oz but nice to split) its a sweetheart."
"Mouthfeel much lighter than expected with ample carbonation and a creamy smoothness. Intense waves of flavor throughout with vanilla bean, licorice, milk chocolate, and alcohol warmth mixed with espresso and slightly bitter dark chocolate on the finish. Wonderful balance of flavors with new notes constantly emerging. Truly exceptional stout."
"D-Easy drinker. Surprisingly light for an IRS."
"D - A great Russian Imperial. I think I will be stocking up on this one."
"I think this made me love RIS' more."
"very nice RIS that I would never pass up if available. although not my favorite of the style, would like to always have a bomber of this around through the winter months."
"Possibly the darkest beer I've ever had. Completely opaque black pour with an almost mahogany head. Smell is incredible, like straight cocoa beans and coffee beans. Tastes like that too, so rich and sweetly delicious! Really creamy full mouthfeel, chewy almost, and yet strangely drinkable for a 10.5 chocolate bomb of a beer. Really a phenomenal brew and a wonderful after dinner treat. Great stuff"
"D- A good no-nonsense RIS. I think this is a model representation of the style. Would certainly drink it again, although a bomber is certianly enough for a night."
"Mind you, I'm drinking this in 80* weather, with humidity, and it's still easy to drink. I reckon this would be a good year round beer."
"Prost!!!"
"...Utter destruction. Total annihilation. A blitzkrieg of the most cunningly vicious infantrymen could not keep a foothold when faced with the slash and burn that is Stone IRS. Opponents beware: this menace lives up to its namesake--imperializing your virgin palate is all in a day's work. Hide your women and children--the opposition has arrived, and it's shrouded in black and will strike without notice."
"Stone Brewing Company is on point as always. This is a nearly infallible beer, with boatloads of delectable qualities. Released every spring, this is a MUST have for pretty much everyone."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: A very tasty smooth, drinkable imperial stout. Without a doubt, the alcohol in this one will creep up on you. I'd drink it until I fell off my chair."
"Reviewed from my notes. Pours a deep black and very opaque. There is a modest tan foam head that settles to a skim. Swirling the beer around left a filmy coat on the sides of the glass. I can smell roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate wafting off of the beer. It's a good mixture of sweet and bitter. The taste is of slightly creamy chocolate up front. In the finish is coffee bitterness and some effervescent alcohol. The flavor lets you know this is a strong beer. It has a creamy body. It isn't as full-bodied as some other stouts. There is a medium level of carbonation. There is a bit of coating, but not too much. Nor is it very sticky, which is nice. This is pretty drinkable as a single glass, and I think I could go through an entire 22oz bottle, but the strength and bitter finish are limiting factors."
"D-Definately a sipper. Alcohol content works well with the style but is still there. I don't expect any stout of this magnitude to be very drinkable beyond one serving."
"D: Really good. Equivalent to Old Raspy."
"Flavor is very much like I though it would be...which means it isn't disappointing in the least. Lots of coffee notes, a heavy deep roast...along with the bitter/sweet coffee flavor throughout. The hop factor is subtle. There's a nice booziness to the mouthfeel, along with a semi-thick medium body, mild carbonation, and delicious! A very tasty stout from Stone."
"Incredible beer! My consumption is only limited by the high alcohol content and local unavailability; otherwise I could drink this amazing beer all night. Stone is easily one of my favorite breweries, further confirmed by this amazing beer."
"D- This wonderfully crafted brew never seems to become overpowering with any given aspect. Quaffable for such a high ABV. Kudos to Stone."
"2011 version, fresh: flavor has a lot less licorice with a lot of woodiness and a significant hoppiness. slightly lower in abv (10.8 vs 10.5) but its still a bit boozy. I like this a bit more. I'm not sure if I like it better fresh than aged or if this vintage is just more to my tastes, but I've got another few of various years in the cellar that I'm looking forward to."
"Nice example of the style, and doesn't have an outrageous price tag (at least in La.)."
"drinkability- not as filling as a i thought the beer would be. Very high drinkability."
"M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice bitter dry finish."
"From 2010 Vintage. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black with a two finger tan head that lingers for quite awhile and subsides to a minimal amount after awhile. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, coffee, chocolate, and bread. The flavor was of cream, malt, espresso, with a coffee followthrough. Upon warming up to just below room temperature there was a very strong aftertaste of bourbon associated with it. It was heavy, almost sticky, on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew from Stone. This was the first time I've gotten a chance to drink this one so it was a whole new experience for my palate. That being said, it was quite good but not what I was expecting to be #30 in the World at the time... One of my only gripes was that the followthrough of coffee was a bit harsh for my palate as I do not drink coffee, but it still didn't deter me from finishing off a bomber."
"This is a good drinking beer, which I believe would go very well with a well-prepared steak. Steak and stout - I wonder if there's a better combination."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Great roast flavors, sweetness in moderation, and a little bit of hops in the back make for this to be a very satisfying brew. My expectations were exceeded."
"Very good beer overall. Only problem is drinkability due to alcohol content (10.5%) and bottle size available in my area."
"D-Given the style and ABV I would be done after a bomber"
"D - This is an amazing RIS, and, given the availability and price, one of the best bargains around. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts and haven't tried this yet, get to a store now! Cannot wait to see how these age."
"A terrific RIS, one of the best I've had the pleasure to enjoy. Surprisingly drinkable - the ABV is high, yes, but such a meaty stout is worthy of slow savouring."
"D- I could have alot"
"Typical deep brown pour. Decent amount of dark brown head leaving minimal lacing behind. Aroma is primarily roasted malts and some slight chocolate. Flavor is very similar but the alcohol comes through a bit to liven things up. Seems just about perfectly carbonated with just the right balance between silky smooth and syrupy mouthfeel. Considering the relatively low cost and wide availability I don't know if there's a better RIS out there... Will definitely be drinking more of this.... Yum!"
"Great beer, an exemplar of the style. Buzzed after half a bomber!"
"Drinkability: This beer is outstanding. Easily the best stout I've had- I haven't tried this one without age, but I can imagine that the vintage brings out the rich chocolately flavor of this which is extremely enjoyable. This beer needs to be sipped and savored and probably cellared before that."
"Great beer!"
"D- not sure if its a good thing or not but I couldn't really taste the alcohol it was really well hidden, which is a sign of a well-made beer; it creeps up on you by the end of the 22oz bottle; it's a bit hoppy for my tastes, but a really affordable and well-made addition to the Stone line up"
"D- The alcohol in this one brings the drinkability down, but surely good for such a big beer."
"I would absolutely recommend this beer."
"D - Amazing beer and has been for years, I am always happy to find this one because I know I will enjoy it!!!"
"I could drink 2 or 3 of these in one sitting, no problem. Excellent beer."
"Thanks to Doug!"
"D- One and done for me, bombers that is. Just a tad sweet and hot right now. The ABV is barely even noticeable. I hope Stone stays in WI for this beer alone. I also heard the the sweet spot for this beer is around two years, so I have an '09 and'10 in the cellar."
"D: A delicious dessert beer for a cold evening. The 10+ ABV makes this a one and done for me in one sitting, but that is not a bad thing. I would certainly treat myself to more in the future."
"I look forward to this beer release every year. at least nine months pass before I get to re-taste it. And in that time my palate matures and I assure myself that I cannot once again be amazed by this beer. I've outgrown it or become better than it, I tell myself. But then I drink it and am amazed again! For 5 years now this has been going on and everytime I drink the Stone IRS I'm in awe. This might be my all-time RIS. It has every quality I'm looking for in the style: roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and overall great malt sweetness. It has a near perfect black color with just a touch of brown around the edges. It's smooth but not velvety or creamy. it's just what I want. Excellence."
"D- big huge stout with a ton of bold flavor. Bigger hop profile then most. Not for the faint of heart and a 22 to the head will do the trick. Ill say I do prefer it with a few years down. Go phils."
"D- Easy to drink and a great stout. My first RIS and I truly enjoyed every drop!"
"D: Very smooth, and it only gets easier as my tastebuds warm to the taste. Very rich, but I'm diggin this beer. Hard to beat the quality you get here for the price."
"D: Drinks closer to an 8.5% ABV instead of the 10.5% advertised. Pretty solid all around but I'm satisfied with one glass. I would have no problem recommending this brew to an average stout drinker."
"Surprisingly drinkable considering the ABV. A very strong, solid, serious beer, yet goes down easier than others I have tried. As rich as this is, would be hard to drink a lot, but that is not a bad thing. Like a very rich delicious dessert, best enjoyed in moderation, but time spent with it is well worth it."
"Rave reviews from most BA members: on the whole, a solid offering from a respected brewer. However, the alcohol taste I noted was much more pervasive than most beers exhibit--and that to me is not necessarily a good thing. One and done--Cheers!"
"D - This is very thick, very heavy, and very bold. The 10.5% certainly isn't hidden, but it isn't overpowering either. That being said, this is an after-dinner, or with food, slowww drinker."
"Overall, the drinkability of this stout is dangerous. I could drink more than one bomber of this, which at 10.5% is scary. Great beer, seek it out if you've not had it."
"All in all a lovely brew and a very impressive imperial stout."
"This is a very enjoyable, and solid presentation of a RIS, and while I will no doubt look forward to next year's offering, I doubt that it will be anything I will truly seek out or keep in my cellar."
"Thanks again Market of Choice for keeping this beer in stock. This was the Spring 2009 release. I don't know if that is all that's out, or that's all they had left from last year. Once I opened the bottle, the aroma hits you in the face with coffee, chocolate, some black licorice. Pours a very dark cola color, but is very, very black once in the glass. This beer goes down rather easy, but at 10.5 abv, i could drink one and be done. There is a chocolate milk flavor I think. At least that's what it tasted like to me. Such a great beer, I can't wait to get another one."
"D: Very drinkable considering the ABV and nature of the beer."
"big thick full bodied, not overly sweet though from unattenuated sugar. really a great beer. this and smuttynose RIS are my favorite in terms of this style."
"RESPECT."
"Stone has hit another home run with their version of an Imperial Russian Stout. Chtob vse byli zdorovy!"
"D- Hell yeah baby. A very complexly flavored beer with layers upon layers. Nice stuff. enjoyed the bottle."
"Again, like a 10.5% ABV beer can truly be drinkable? This is tasty but a decadent treat."
"D - dessert only. very hot and sweet, only ~6oz per person please"
"This is from some notes during last nights abomination of a basketball game. This pours black, and gives about an inch of beautiful tan head. Good lacing. I smell fresh espresso, bittersweet chocolate and a bit of toffee. Pretty much smells like a candy shop with roasted malts kicking around. The first thing that hits my tongue is espresso and then some cocoa. It has a richness that I would think to find in maple syrup. Espresso flavors linger in the middle of the tongue. A little bit of alcohol but at 10.5, you gotta expect a little bit. Feels silky and rich in the mouth. A bit syrupy, but overall pretty amazing. Easy to drink with the 10.5 abv. A little bit of warmth from the alcohol, but it's really just enough to you let you know it's there."
"O: Bleh. Maybe I've drank this beer too soon. On the back it recommends trying it every 5-6 months, and since it was ""released"" this spring, and it's only June, maybe it wasn't the right time to drink? I will go read the other reviews now and try to see what everyone else see's in it. It's definitely disconcerting that my experience is so far different from the other reviewers here."
"Pours a dark black color with thin off-white head and some life. Has an aroma of chocolate, caramel, and grapefruit, with hints of coffee. Sweet up front. Then a malty, velvety finish with some nice bitters on the back end. The carbonation is muted a bit, keeps it from being too syrupy though. Very good."
"Drinkability: This is not something I can have more than two or three glasses of but if I were to drink this with food I would enjoy it very much. For what it is it has all the drinkability you could realistically ask for."
"D: pretty damn good RIS from stone considering they stick to the hop bombs. This is definitely a treat after dinner. The beer drank good and could have another bomber."
"Overall i was a bit disappointed with this imperial stout, I was expecting a bit more from stone. Its not a bad Imperial stout, i just wanted more flavor."
"overall, very good but IMHO not world class. maybe my expectations were too high going in; i was expecting to LOVE it... def not on the level of a kbs or even bourbon county, in my opinion. guess i'm a sucker for the bourbon. :)"
"Overall, it is hard to come by a widely distributed Imperial Stout that is worth picking up. A nice beer to look forward to each year. I liked 2008 a lot, hated 2009 ( I dislike a lot of 2009 versions of beers for some reason), but enjoy this years. I will probably pick up a couple of these for aging."
"D - It'll put a bit of hair on your chest. It's definitely for a person who can enjoy a ton of character in a beer. This isn't for the normal fragile American tongue. This is the real stuff. That said, it's a bit much for a daily brew. Personally, I enjoy something a bit lighter day to day, but it's a refreshing change I'm sure a stout fan would love."
"6/6/2010"
"Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. Silky texture that just dances on the palate. Drinkability is good for a big beer, but definately not a chugger. A great beer and one.I have enjoyed for a long time just never reviewed."
"D - I wouldn't recommend it on a hot day after work or from mowing the lawn. As a beer you relax and sip on, it's a fine wine in beer form."
"Happy St. Patrick's Day, still going on these '08s, 7 years old now. Ridiculously easy-drinking and subdued (in a good way). Kinda just like viscous chocolate cigar box licorice substance with really no alcohol. Still some light carbonation."
"drinkability - a very complex but huge beer, difficult to get through a snifter in any amount of time"
"D: I'm almost invariably left wanting more."
"D- I enjoyed sipping on this one. I took my time with it. I drank the whole bomber solo over an hour. I am glad I did because like I said before, it really opens up as it warms. I really enjoyed it and I believe I will purchase more to put some age on them."
"I'd highly recommend picking one of these up, especially if over a year old."
"Had on tap at Belmont Station in Portland Oregon. I have had the 2010 in the bottle several times now, and finally got a try on tap. The appearance was deep black with a really foamed up brown head. As the glass settled they maintained some patches of bubbles. Nose was roasted malts, coffee, bakers chocolate, and a twinge of hops. Taste was more of the same with the hops and currant being more prominent than in the bottle, and in a way that was less pleasant for me. The mouthfeel was spectacular."
"Poured into a pint glass and built up a massive dark tan head that lingered for quite a while which was highly unexpected. Coloration was black as night. Smell was ok, pretty nutty smelling with loys of coffee. Tastes of roasted nuts and malt upfront with a very taint bitterness at the end of the sip. Pretty thick mouthfeel, also nice and creamy and smooth. A nice sipper in my opinion. Not the heaviest or most massive stout out there but very nice."
" i say this because for me with how heavy the coffee taste i may be able to stomach one or two at a time because of how rich it is"
"i am really impressed with this quality brew"
"overall - I think the best year was '09, but it may have been a bit too sweet. Somewhere between 1 and 2 years is about perfect. Actually at the end I mixed '08 and '09 together and enjoyed it quite a bit!"
"I was impressed with the differentiation here. The 2008 > 2009 > 2010, but they're all good. This is an awesome RIS, and, for the price, it's second to none. Buy several, drink one or two, and cellar the rest."
"Overall - This is one of my favorite of the easily available RISes. I need to keep reminding myself to buy a case each year when it comes out, and even that probably wouldn't be enough to tide me over until next year."
"D. Once the alcohol burn fades a bit more this will be supremely drinkable."
"D: I'm glad it's easily available at a reasonable price. I usually buy several bottles of each year."
"Very drinkable for an Imperial Russian Stout, but without losing any boldness. These could be dangerous on cool autumn evenings. Luckily it's nearly summer and I'll want something lighter next."
"One fine sipper! Bang for the buck this blows most beers in this class away! Ive paid twice the $$$ for RIS's that dont even come close."
"i'd highly recommend this brew, one of the best i've had...i enjoyed this one with a friend from england playing pool in his at-home pub...cheers!"
"d - very drinkable, even with the ABV"
"Overall a great beer I will be buying again. The flavor was spot on. Very well balanced and a easy drinker. I think the feel will get better with age, it was a bit harsh on the finish. Let this warm up a bit if outta the fridge. My favorite Stone so far.."
"Poured crypt black as the Ace of Spades with a finger and a half silky carmel head finishing thru the entire glass with sticky lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malts with a slight alcohol tint. Taste was off the chart with a semi-sweet dark chocolate and robust coffee infusion with a touch of malt. A full bodied nicely carbonated brew with a warm finish. Yeah this brew drinks like it belongs in the top 100."
"Poured this into a tulip glass about a month after its 2010 release. Big, frothy, silky tan head on this one. Black as night. Smells very roast with a pleasant chocolate scent. Tastes like dark chocolate with toasty dark fruits as well. This one is a little boozy, but I expected that. I have 4 others that I'm gonna age to allow to mellow out. The mouthfeel is amazing on this, and drinkability isn't too bad considering such high ABV. The drinkability will only get better as this one gets older. Very good imperial stout."
"I'll drink this again. I would definitely like to see a nice bourbon barrel aged version made with such a fine imperial stout as its base. Delicious"
"It's hard for me to pinpoint individual flavors; this is a fairly complex brew -- at least to me. Very similar to the scent, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of bitterness. A great beer from one the US's premier breweries."
"D- Everything but the alcohol makes this super drinkable...if it wasn't so strong, you could easily pound back a few of these. But because of that underlying alcohol flavor...eh, gotta hold back a little bit"
"Edit- ""Had"" to pop the early Spring 2010 vintage from cellar, poured into HOTD tulip. Nice and chocolatey,coffee notes are now fairly subtle, hops have mellowed a bit and the alcohol is well hidden. Not sure this will drink much better in the future, it's really good right now. Upped taste and overall score. IMO one of best American interpretations of the RIS style along with Southamption."
"A nice Imperial Stout. Next time I'll go with a bottle and hold onto it for few years to mellow the heat."
"Living in san diego i sometimes don't take advantage of these amazing locals! got to remember these brews more often!"
"Pours an impenetrable black with a thick cola colored head that retains surprisingly well, this one is a real looker. The aroma is also impressive, with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, dirt, burnt bread, citrusy hops, molasses and a hint of alcohol. The flavor has some roastiness upfront, along with gourmet dark chocolate, black coffee, dark fruits (plum and date), burnt bread, piney hops, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich without being overbearing, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Overall an extremely good interpretation of the style, without going overboard on the hops or the roastiness."
"Awesome RIS. Stone is still spot on."
"I feel there's a difference between the 2010 and 2008 ( the older beer clearly winning out) though I am not drinking both side to side. Again, study is required."
"Probably ranks in my top 5 beers at this point."
"The carbonation is much too high and distracting from a smooth mouthfeel. It finishes pretty dry which I much prefer over a sweet finish in RIS' Drinkability is ok but not great mostly due to the high carbonation. If I let this one sit for 30 minutes to an hour I bet it would improve."
"I've had this brew a number of times in varying years and serving types. They have always been an enjoyable experience with their own unique characteristics. While fresh this brew is quite bitter but time let's it smooth out and become a little more sweet (like this example.)"
"22 ounce bottle, 2009 vintage. Although I have had this beer a number of times fresh, in the past, I have heard it is supposed to be even better with age, so I'm giving it a try. Pours a deep, impenetrable black, topped off with a thick dark brown head which quickly recedes. Aromas of roasted malt, strong, bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Flavors of black licorice, roasted malt, dark chocolate and smoke. Silky smooth and very good."
"D - Really easy to drink especially for a 10.5% beer. I really enjoyed this one and I am sure this one will be in my cellar permanently and in my shopping cart quite frequently."
"Really a remarkable beer. I only even gave it less than perfect marks on appearance because this was my first review and I wasn't exactly sure what made up an ""exceptional appearance"""
"I loved it and have talked about it with everyone I talked to this weekend including my mom."
"While excellent on its own, this would be a superior addition to a BBQ marinade as well."
"The balance and interplay of flavors; smoke, roasted barley, sweet dried fruit and pleasant bitterness make for a great drinking experience. A pleasure to the last drop."
"Have two more 2008s about five 2009s and a 2010, so don't be surprised if I make some edits to this one. But just go out and get this beer, it's been a personal favorite for several years, I'm glad I finally took the time to review it!"
"D - Fits the style well - this would be a great after dinner/dessert brew that will function as coffee and rich chocolate all rolled into one. I haven't tasted any of the earlier vintages, but this is one I would be happy to revisit again given the opportunity. Stone, always a quality brewery, really hit the nail on the head with this one."
"Drinkability: Such a great beer that I've routinely overlooked year over year. Won't happen any more, as this is a world class home run by Stone."
"D - I'll admit to being a bit predisposed to Stone's IRS, as I still have two bottles of the 09 version cellaring in the fridge. But for fans of a great IRS, Stone really sets the bar high with their offering. This is an annual selection I really look forward to trying. Great beer from a fantastic brewer."
"Highly drinkable, but only one per sitting. I couldnt drink multiples but maybe others could. I just dont have any interest in drinking multiples unless over the course of an entire evening."
"Would make a great dessert beer, especially with chocolate mousse or Bavarian Chocolate cake."
"Overall, an exceptional brew. I have never been a big fan of Stone brewery. This Stone Imperial Russian Stout (not to be confused with a Russian Imperial Stout mind you) has changed the way I view their craft. Well played Stone... well played..."
"The appearance is black as can be as you would expect with a deep colored brown head. The smell is sweet and full of alcohol. The drinkability of this one is out of this world, and the full body of the beer blends so well with the deep tastes of chocolate, molasses, and roasted barley. For 10.5% this one goes down smooth. This one has surely gone on the list of top RIS's."
"A good drinkability factor, besides the liver loving 10.8% ABV it is one beer that I will be sure to keep an eye on."
"Notes: I understand that this beer improves with age, but so do a lot of beers. I just don't understand why this beer has such a high rating. There was never a moment when I was really moved by the taste of Stone IRS."
"Picked up a few extras to cellar for a while, I fully expect to bump this review up a few points once it has some age on it."
"Appearance pours out almost black having a thin head, but no lace. Smell of dark rich chocolate, coffee and molassas, having some dark fruity earthiness to it. taste is again rich as in the above aromas with some roastiness and having alchohol present, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is full with a good spike of carbonation makes it a smooth go down. A nice complex stout that is great to sip on and enjoy."
"Roasty and thick, just the way i like em about sums up this Imperial Russian Stout for me, it has alot of roasted malt that verge but don't quite get into coffee territory, although the aroma does have quite the coffee smell to it. there is alot of bittersweet cocao that compliments the roasty notes wonderfully, and a very light alcohol on the finish that is enjoyable. There is a subtle sweet side tucked inside of this beer, caramel is dominate on the sweet side with a touch of vanilla powder. I love how thick this is, this is how a RIS should be, viscous and almost sludgy, and yet there is still a decent amount of carbination spreading the flavors around the pallete. great RIS."
"D: another solid brew from Stone- really liking the fact that they began distributing to Chicago. Looking forward to trying this after some time in the cellar."
"Taste: Chocolate and coffee with a right hop bitterness. The high alcohol (10.5%) was almost entirely hidden except for comfortable warm on the back palette. Roasted characters are in the background - noticeable but not the stars."
"A thick mouthfeel that isn't over powering."
"Very drinkable beer, great offering by Stone."
"Drinkability-Well, it's a RIS so it's not gonna be super drinkable regardless but given the style I'd say ranks about average I.E. a single bomber is more than enough"
"D: This is an impressive beer. high alcohol limits the drinkability"
"All-in-all, a top-notch beer, worthy of its ranking. I plan on cellaring a couple, but I don't know how it could get any better."
"I tried this last year and thought it was a bit too hoppy/bitter...the age has done this beer very well. I look forward to trying this with even more age."
"I feel like this is one of the craft beer world's better kept secrets. Very happy that this is readily available in Chicagoland now, and at a very reasonable price point to boot. Will definitely be enjoying this again in the near future."
"D - Wonderfully complex, yet drinkable, and the alcohol isn't prohibitive."
"D: A high ABV makes this one a sipper but you won't want to put it down after one sip. Darn good!"
"A note about value. I paid $6.49 for this bomber, which is almost half the price of The Abyss. When I am pinching pennies, I always choose this over The Abyss. It is almost as good, and maybe just as good since I cherish value. This is my very favorite Russian Imperial Stout. I am thankful for the style."
"M/D: Has a moderate/low carbonation. Th alcohol tingle is hidden, which makes it easily palpable, especially for the 10.5%. What else but another great beer from stone, do they make a bad beer?"
"D: A thick, amazing stout that even though it is thick and creamy, it's easy to drink. Alcohol is barely detectable, though it does come through in the finish, and as the beer warms. I don't think I've been disappointed by any of Stone's offerings thus far."
"This was the first bottle I opened from the 2010 release. If cellaring makes this better, I'm excited."
"What is there to say about this beer that has not been said? Honestly this is the only Stone beer that I have liked and well I have reassured my faith in them. The alcohol is hidden and I am pretty sure this went down faster than my morning coffee. Great Brew."
"A late night sipper. The brew that ends the session. Great job by Stone who has not let me down."
"Like many Stone beers, Stone IRS is bold while still being balanced, and is a solid example of its style. If you're on a stout kick, or liable to be on one in the future, you'll want to keep a bottle of this on hand at all times. Also notable for the excellent value, $5-$7 a bottle or so, depending on where you are (I paid $6 in NYC)."
"Overall, this is a very solid beer for the style. I highly recommend this beer to any 'dark beer' lover. haha. cheers"
"D: Very drinkable, goes down easily, would definitely have another, though with the high alcohol content one should be careful."
"D_It's a big beer but a bomber sometimes just is not enough."
"drinkability - very enjoyable and full of flavors. I did not mix with food as it was so overwhelming."
"D: Excellent. Working on 2nd bomber with DH. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- Very rich and creamy, like biting into savory chocolate mousse. Highly drinkable and delicious."
"Overall I was impressed and would be happy to drink this vintage again and would love to try one with even more age on it."
"just had this about an hour ago. Pours lovely, brown to black with a tan head. Smells like rich chocolate and coffee, lightly carbonated with a nice weight in your mouth. Warm going down and finishes nicely resonating with a rich coffee flavour. Highly recommended, try this if you have a chance, especially for those who are a fan of the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a khaki colored head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt with some piney hops. The flavor is lots of bitter chocolate, coffee and some piney hops as well as roasted malt. As the beer gets to room temperature you start to get some other flavors including semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, toffee and brown sugar. Medium bitterness overall, much less so than when the beer is fresh. The alcohol is not that present in the taste but it is warming. Thick, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Feel/Drink: Rich, creamy mouthfeel. I can drink a couple of these but with the alcohol, I'm ready for something a bit calmer."
"D: Very rich with great flavors and a great hop bite. Highly drinkable and recommended."
"Not the most drinkable beer, but the complexity makes me give the drinkability category a higher score."
"Bottle from Malt & Vine. 2009 spring release. Tasted blind with 14 other stouts. Pours a black with frothy tan head and great lacing. Incredible coffee and chocolate aroma. Nice sweet flavor with chocolate and molasses. Medium body an d a bit fizzy. Really interesting chocolate and bitter finish. Incredible brew, but still needs to mellow. Can't wait to taste this vintage in a couple years."
"D-a delicious beer with a great taste that can be drunk all night and can certanly lead to trouble"
"This review was taken from notes. I had this beer at a tasting with my buddy on a dark cold night and we decided to play some whiffle ball. We had a KBS and this beer. This beer held its ground against the KBS. Black, hearty, and warming is the only way I can describe this beer. Very complex with bitter chocolate overtones and a hoppy undertone. Velvety texture with a long bitter sweet finish. A true display of what Stone can do."
"D - a solid, almost by-the-book RIS. two years has done well on this, and I'm looking forward to seeing what more time will do (got a case of this yesterday at a steal). dangerously drinkable, caught myself thinking gulp instead of sip. doesnt have the flashiness of some barrel-aged or infused stouts, but doesnt need it. superb."
"Overall, a really good RIS, but not the best IMO, I would still take Storm King anyday over this. This is just a touch too sweet for my liking, maybe a fresher sample would be less so."
"Although this stout is quite drinkable right now i am sure it'll improve with another year in the cellar. Good stuff."
"D: For what this is, this is incredibly drinkable; alcohol is so well masked; this is a very good brew from a very good brewery"
"D-This bottle has 2 years of age on it and it is still kickin' strong! Super flavourful and VERY tasty. Dollar for dollar one of the best Imperial Stouts out there. So ubiquitous it is easy to overlook and take for granted."
"I'll easy drink the bomber. I expected to really love it, but there's something about his beer that is missing. Can't quite put my finger on it."
"D - I love this beer and wish I could get it more regualrly. Drinks very well given the high ABV, just a great beer."
"**Resampled again at 6 months, 8 months, and 1.5 years. Found the former to still be a bit shallow, the latter to be too dark fruit focused (dark cherries), and the 8 month to be a bit better overall, with most of the complexity coming out without losing too much focus."
"M/D- Full bodied, low carbonation. best beer that i've had from stone. can't wait for the 2010 edition."
"I don't care for the 2009 vintage as much as previous vintages, but it's still good. Like I said, hold on to it and 2-3 years after the vintage everything should come together nicely. For a RIS this is very drinkable and actually not as heavy as I feel previous vintages were, which can be good or bad depending on what you want."
"D: I don't like rating RIS very high, but this one has a good combo of what I expect from the style and what I like in a beer."
"D - Hard to pick out the alcohol in this one, impressive given the ABV. Probably going to fill you up quickly though."
"Drinkability is a good as you can get for a huge 10.5% Imperial Russian Stout. I mean you can't drink a ton of these but thats just the way it is. It's a fantastic beer regardless. I would love to try an even older vintage to see how if calms at all."
"This was an extra from richbrew and again I am stoked to try this one! Poured from bomber to snifter. Black like oil with a 1 finger brown head. I smell chocolate and a little molasses and I get the same tastes. Chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, slight alcohol, and a little bit of raisen. This beer is thick and rich and very drinkable though with such high abv one 22oz bottle is enough."
"Similar flavor, hershey's and molasses, reduced down to a compact format. A bit of roasty malt in the background, any booze/hops are long gone on the palate. Thick, full, rich, sticky. Quintessential aged RIS? I guess so... Afterimage of toasted marshmallows and burnt chocolate edges. Nice enough, maybe not my favorite RIS but a soild one i'd never refuse. Plan to revisit when Stone shows up in Illinois..."
"D - No problem finishing a bomber. The alcohol is present but not tiring. I am not as anxious to open another bottle as I have been with others in this style."
"Mouthfeel, fades when you swish it around a little, which might be good, this is a big beer. Drinkable for being so strong, thick and yet, reasonably priced for everything that goes into it."
"D: For sure this is not your average Imperial Stout, it was nice to have a difference in this style but overall hard to put down. I wonder what a few years will do to this. Got a few more bottles I plan on sitting on."
"Roasty, malts, chocolate, creamy and smooth, but heavy and full-bodied at the same time. This beer will grow on you, at least it has for me and every re-taste I have after several months I am more impressed by the combination of smokiness, roastedness, and full bodiedness accompanied with great drinkability."
"Overall, a beer that lives up to its style but with an American punch. The alcohol plays a large role in this beer's flavor profile and for the better. This one will put hair on your chest and prepare you for the cold."
"D: a very nice ris. big but not huge, with the requisite expected flavors. being on tap and well-cellared probably didn't hurt."
"Overall I could drink a couple in one sitting but not too much. I will be buying a whole case this year to keep for years to come."
"Thanks so much Beerandblues2 for sending this in a secret santa package. Much obliged. Dark opaque black, frothy mocha head. Oily and viscous looking. Milk chocolate dominates the nose, and is then followed by anise, mochachinos, roasted malts, and american hops. Milk chocolate taste, cocoa beans, roasted cofee, and bitter as all get out! Great! Awesome length, sweet roasty hops bitterness finish, but unfortunately, has some chalky astringency. Pretty damn good, just wish it was less dry on the finish. Thanks again Brad! IOU!"
"drinkability is great even @ the 10+abv"
"D - This was a great RIS and of course it's from Stone...the flavors paired well with one another and the 10.5% was well hidden but I wouldn't want to push the limits"
"Overall, this is a wonderful IRS. But my recommendation would be to cork it, put it in a fridge, let it explode and sit over night. Then enjoy!"
"A very rich and full flavored stout. Plenty of interesting subtleties within the complex flavor profile."
"I might have picked up the slightest tinge of oxidation in this one. It drinks well, just wondering if this is the outer limit for this one. Perhaps the 08 might be the star of a vertical. Very good and enjoyable beer from a great brewery."
"O: Exceptional. Very smooth and intricate for this style. One of the best RIPS' in my opinion! Beats Founders, Otter Creek and Great Divide Yeti, if that's any inclination!"
"Overall, it is a wonderful example of the style. My favorite beer hands down."
"A pleasant drinking beer, but I just would prefer less sweetness."
"Overall a good beer, but not the best RIS that I have had."
"D: Pretty high for the style and abv."
"Really liked it. I have one more 2009 and I will plan to stash away several 2010s when released in a week."
"Overall I think this is an amazing beer - still a bit cold from the refrigerator and I think aging would do this beer wonders!"
"Small somewhat creamy light brown head that mostly diminished. Pitch black color. Aroma of bread, molasses, caramel, chocolate, coffee, toasted malt. Light alcoholic sniff, plum, prune, date, licorice. Very complex aroma. Full bodied with an alcoholic texture and a soft carbonation. Excellent balance between the moderated sweet malt and bitter flavor. Berries sweet and lingering finish. Smooth and very nice thick beer. Definitely one of my favorite RIS."
"D-this is quite tasty and brings a nice level of complexity. it isn't as big as the top dawgs imo; but it quite nice!"
"I like it seved nice and chilled.. I've had it warm and it is quite a different, far more pungent flavor profile, but still it's pretty enjoyable."
"D - Smooth, balanced, could drink a couple hundred of these... too bad its such a high abv so one will have to do."
"If you like other Stone Brewing brews then you should like this one as well."
"Poured from a 2009 bottle. Stone IRS pours an inky black with a thick brown head. Not a bit of light shines through when held up to the bulb. The aroma is sweet and chocolatey with hints of caramel and toffee. The flavor is rich chocolate, with tons of sweet crystal malt flavor balancing out a slight astringency of the roasted malt. The finish is dark with hints of coffee and earthy bitterness. Some alcohol burn comes through in the end, but at 10.5% I wouldn't expect otherwise. This is definitely towards the sweet chocolatey end of imperial stouts, and I don't know how they could do it better."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable RIS, but make nice and share this monster of a brew."
"Medium-full bodied with a medium effervescence. Fairly smooth with a slightly dry finish. Oh, yeah, this is some seriously good stuff."
"D--This is an awesome beer. Not sure how long this beer can age before it ""turns", but a nice choice for my first Super Bowl sunday beer day."
"Drinkability: I would like to thank Stone for creating such a magnificent full-bodied brew in the style of an Russian Imperial Stout, Stone is known for making first-rate products and this is no exception. This afternoon I ventured into the almost three feet of snow outside to build an igloo and this is the perfect beer to come in and warm up to. In fact once I finish this review I am going to give this beer a field test by taking it into the igloo to finish what I have left."
"What a delight, enjoyed on tap as part of the Novare Res 12 Stouts After Christmas. Dark, rich, thick and complex this was a very enjoyable beer. The alcohol warmed me right up and it felt like dark chocolate hot cocoa. My wife ordered a Young Chocolate Stout (also on tap) and trying a sip of it after the Stone made it taste like Yoo-Hoo. This was the closest beer I have tasted to the elusive Kate the Great."
"Great appearance, great aroma, great taste, drink it while you can!"
"Really enjoyed this beer, most likely the best beer from the USA I've had so far. Can't remember what score I gave Ten FIDY, but this is better in my opinion."
"D: The alcohol is hidden well and its very drinkable for a RIS. The sweetness is alittle much for my personal tastes, but that doesn't stop it from being a really solid beer. For the price, this may be one of the better RIS I've had."
"Very enjoyable, big & tasty -- one is enough, but I ended up happily finishing the bomber. This was relatively young, & while it had some great things going for it, I'd love to have it aged to smooth out some of the rough edges. I'm sure the result would be fantastic."
"A good model for imperial stouts to follow. Improves and comes into its own as it warms."
"D: This beer's drinkability is limited by its alcohol content. I love the taste of beer but I don't particularly like the feeling of getting drunk and make no mistake, after only a single bottle of this definitely-more-than-10.5%-beer, I was basking almost a little too much in beer nirvana. It goes down smooth but after you finish your bottle, I seriously doubt you will want anything else the rest of the night."
"Overall, a first rate RIS. Hope to try other vintages of this beer so I can see what it tastes like fresh and with more time on it."
"Anyways, mouthfeel was solid. Good consistency for a imperial stout. Feels solid and not sticky in your mouth. Drinability was not good. I could taste biting alcohol and it made me hesitant to want more than one glass."
"Very drinkabale beer considering the style and strength."
"D. This is a highly drinkable Imperial Stout. Goes down very easy, and is incredibly smooth. A great RIS."
"Drinkability is quite good for a stout of this caliber. The alcohol is masked well and it was a smooth ride from start to finish. Overall, a very, very good RIS, something I'd definitely revisit."
"This was very tasty and flavorful, pretty easy to drink though very filling."
"'03 bottle shared at January '07 metro Detroit tasting. Black pour with a small loose brown head. Big, sweet, fruity, coffee aroma. Lots of coffee flavor with lots of alcohol, raisin, dates and brown sugar. The body is sticky and full with a nice alcohol warming."
"22 oz bomber many thanks to Hogtownharry! Dark black pour with thin veil of brown-reddish head. Aroma is so thick and malty, rich roasted grain, heavy molasses, and a bit of chocolate and some plums. Taste is very rich, molasses and ripe fruit, quite sweet well hidden alcohol, don't feel the advertised bitterness either. Palate is very chewy, heavy and absolutely great."
"D- This is the best RIS I've ever had...period"
"Will happily finish this 750ml, and would gladly share another... With myself even."
"D: A roasted anise monster with a nearly perfect body. It's a big beer nonetheless. Good job Stone."
"D-Very drinkable but still a sipper. Very smooth, but say, not as smooth as the stout trooper I had last week. One of my favorite RIS's."
"Overall, kind of let down. It's great, but finding a lack of dark fruit. Probably tastes a lot better aged, obviously."
"Serving- Bomber"
"(Will re-review later, and improve)"
"Glad to finally get my hands on this. An excellent example of the style, although fresh it was very boozy and difficult to finish the bomber by myself. Would love to try one with a year or more on it to mellow out the alcohol."
"D - Very drinkable. Has a nice complex flavor. The strong content would prevent me from having a few, but one hits the spot just right."
"Alluring and delicious. A great 'standard'. Classic all around."
"D: Slightly bitter finish, doesn't last extremely long. Hides the alcohol extremely well for a beer of this strength."
"Overall I find this beer to certainly be in the top of Imperial Stouts and it's another fine offering from Stone. For a beer with as vast a distribution area, nothing at all hasbeen compromised. Highly Recommended."
"Big, heavy and roasty with lots of boozey giddiness: it's a kitten puncher. Black currant esters and smooth coffee versus roast malt with a lingering chocolate aftertaste. Well balanced for such a big beer."
"Overall, a very good example of the style. Certainly not on the level of The Abyss, but just as certainly worth your time."
"This is smooth, rich, thick and delicious RIS. A 2008 keg from my 16 oz growler. Respectable head and retention. Average lacing. Smell is just wonderful. Big roasted chocolate malt. Coffee just behind that. A light sweetness but mostly a wonderful dark breadiness and roasted grain goodness. An English yeast fruitiness. Earthy hops following the English line. This is a great tasting beer. No tricks, no gimmicks, just good solid brewing in the vein of Brooklyn BCS. An excellent balance of bread, roasted grains, and sweetness. Brown bread, molasses, and toffee. Mocha and light chocolate with coffee in the finish. An earthy hops blending into the coffee to give a lingering dry finish with faint alcohol heretofore invisible superbly integrated. Feel is silky and mildly carbonated. A pleasing fullness with a slightly chewy texture. Quite easy to drink in spite of the abv. I have to force myself to behave. This stuff is seductive!"
"D – If you can get it, get it. Its not a fast drinker, but it is a delicious sipper. I take about an hour per tulip."
"Not much to add here that hasnt been said in previous post. Awesome this one was a bottle I had back for 2 years and wow all I can say is lay these bad boys down to age and you will be VERY pleased. Not overly heavy on the mouth feel but just right. All the flavors seem to jump out especially as the brew warms. I had this one at just over celler temp. Dont drink these cold as it does not truly let the flavors come out like they are capable of . Nice roasted malts and chocolate a small touch of coffee not overly done in anything and all the flavors blend to form and intense drinkable experience you and expect going into a beer like this.Awesome"
"This is a great Imperial Stout very smooth nice mouth feel. Pretty pricey at the 8.46 a bottle. Would like to know what others are paying in there areas for it? I will probably grab a few bottles and toss them in the cellar for those special times of the year."
"Notes: Wow this is a great brew perfect for any cold night. Cheers."
"I don't know how much I'm adding with my review to this already well-recognized brew (1,600+ opinions on BA!). This is merely an affirmation of its greatness. It's like Old Rasputin taken to a whole other level: refined and smooth."
"Oh so balanced, oh so roasty with just enough sweet to balance. Dangerously drinkable at this point, must find more to age. Superb."
"D - Between the flavor and mouthfeel...well, hell...every aspect of this beer, it's probably one of, if not THE, best beers I've ever had in my life. And for the price, it's damn near impossible to beat. I want to buy a case and I want to buy it now."
"This was a great Christmas Present from Stone and the Flying Saucer."
"OVERALL Seems to have mellowed with age, and surprisingly easy to drink. Pretty smooth for all that is going on in it."
"Taste is a great chocolate,coffee and a fruity sweetness that really sits well on tht tongue. Extremely smooth and creamy motuhfeel and a solid drinkability with an ABV that will sneak up on you if your not careful."
"D- I can never seem to give RIS anything more than a 4.5 for drinkability, I find it kinda rediculous to try and drink 22oz of this stuff. Its not that its bad but it is heavy and high abv. Overall this is a good RIS, not my favorite but the value is there especially for teh quality of the beer."
"Limited Spring 2009 Release. This stuff is black. The fluffy dark tan head is the only thing that gives it away as to not actually being black. The head does dissipate rather quickly. I can't even discern color when held directly to my desk light. Lots of chocolate along with some strong coffee notes and hints of molasses. Only a hint of alcohol in the nose. There are also traces of dark dried fruits. Tastes of a smoky chocolate coffee. Alcohol is masked fairly well, but it is noticeable. Pretty good for a 10.5% RIS. That's what has kept me away from other RIS's such as Siberian Night, which I felt to be too alcohol forward. Oddly enough, I tend not to notice alcohol in high ABV strong ales or DIPA's. I'm also noticing a black licorice component as I get further into this. Creamy viscous feel with a fair amount of carbonation. Not typically a fan of this style, but I'm glad I tried this one. Nice sipper, but I could only drink it sparingly. The only knock that I have is that there is a building sweetness/richness that knocks down the drinkablity a touch for me. Unlike high ABV DIPA's, I'd rather have this in a 12 ouncer."
"I have a 2007 bottle but decided that I would give this one a shot first. This is a good RIS but I probably would not get this again. I have had other offerings from Stone that I would get before buying this again. Plus I have found other RIS's that suit me more. Overall a nice beer but a one time thing. However I will be having the 2007 bottle in my cellar down the road and see what a few years does to the flavors."
"the alcohol is barely noticable. Smooth and medium bodied with a silky carbonation. A fantastic RIS that only improves with age."
"All in all, this is a great brew. Awesome stout. Very impressed with the '08 after aged for a year. Great for people who have already expanded to craft brews and are looking for a good stout."
"After a year's aging, this is presenting as an amazing beer. My notes are for the 2008 vintage, now a year old. The fruit flavors have mellowed a bit, but there remains a well-integrated, deep complexity of flavors. Age your stone RIS a year (or more) and you will be glad you did."
"Hard to knock the value here, certainly not the best RIS out there but that is not a knock at all. The ABV is very well hidden."
"D: Scary on the drinkability, alcohol is well masked and this beer is delicious. 10.8% ABV? I wouldn't believe it if it wasn't printed on the bottle."
"O - A good RIS. There are a ton of better RIS's available, but for the price and the ABV, this is a good choice."
"D-Dangerous. Smooth enticing for 10.5 abv."
"I am sure another 6 months would do wonders I can not fathom. so buy one to enjoy and then stick one away for later. don't miss out."
"D- Definitely a sipper of a beer. Taste, mouthfeel, and virtually everything about this beer is excellent, but I can really only take so much of it. This is a big beer that deserves respect."
"D: Very good for the abv."
"D- For me, this is my measuring stick for Russian Imp Stouts. This has great aromas and rich flavor. This gets better with some age on it. Great after dinner drink."
"D: A great drinking RIS, one of the better ones out there. At 10.5% alcohol you won't be drinking a lot of this at once, but you'll want to!"
"(D)- A fantastic RIS that defines the style. I can only imagine how additional age will continue to transform this. It tastes superb now, but has the stuffing & body to continue on. Definitely a well-made stout. Perhaps one of the best Russians I have had the pleasure to drink; stock up on lots of this! Very surprised how drinkable this is. The alcohol does catch up with you later on though. It even has a very reasonable price to boot!"
"D: Enjoyable but it's a sipper right now. Just the high ABV and the burn made me lower the drinkability of it."
"D - The ultimate stout-sipper's beer. It'll keep you warm and feeling full, but is not at all overbearing. Nonetheless, a single bomber will do you in for the night."
"Drinkability is very good. I am just finishing up the bomber and could probably enjoy another 12 oz. before oblivion starts to kick in. I don't know why I kept this one out of the rotation so long, but the bit of aging was probably a good idea. If I get another bottle it won't last that long."
"D- Goes back easy for a RIS. I drank a bomber by myself w/o problem. Overall a great beer and probably the best accessible RIS in America (also, one of the best overall)."
"D - Huge complex flavor with a good body. A bit boozey from the alcohol content and presence. Definitely a sipping beer but extremely enjoyable. My favorite beer from Stone!!!"
"This is surely not my absolute favorite Stout, but it's probably a top 10 entry. I'll have to get some bottles to do aging experiments with."
"Picked up a Limited 2010 spring release last summer. Decided to crack this open with a bit of age on it. Its still a little hot initially, but the roasted espresso/chocolate flavours come through in the finish. I hope to grab another bottle sometime so I can sit on it for a couple more years."
"Pours a black vody with a one-finger head that leaves a lace ring fown glass. A great roasted malt smell with some minor sweetness. Extremely smooth and creamy when it first hits my tongue with a burnt chocolate edge alonst with caramel and I think hints of vanilla/molasses. Roasted and coffee malts are pretty abundant in this beer and it finishes dry but a little sweeter than I thought. Smooths as it warms and is a little stickiness that is great as well; ABV only serves to complement beer and this is a sipper you take your time to enjoy."
"D - Be careful. The 10.5% alcohol is expertly hidden. This is an extremely drinkable brew, a perfect blend of bitter and sweet; another superb offering from Stone."
"Pours a bit like engine oil, viscous and black with a medium frothy brown head. Aroma of dark chocolates, roasted barley, java and a bit of alcohol. Initial flavor has a noticeably roasty profile with some malty sweetness, caramel flavor and residual sugars. The bitterness really comes through in the end with a bit of a charred taste. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, but not as creamy as some imperial stouts. The finish is long, dry and bitter, like a good relationship gone south. Possibly Stone's finest offering."
"Overall pretty solid beer. Wish the flavor was a little more balanced. I'd buy it again if it came in a smaller bottle probably. But for the price and drinkability I'd rather buy two 12oz bottles of old rasputin or yeti."
"Stone Imperial Russian Stout is everything it ought to be and much much more. More of these will be coming home all winter long."
"D: Definitely felt the alcohol after I polished off the bomber. Not very drinkable, yet Stone doesn't intend this to be a sessionable beer."
"D: To be enjoyed slowly. Not the kind of brew to be had every day, but definitely one that can serve as a proper nightcap to close out a long and stressful day."
"D: Alcohol is quite prevalent, dips on the drinkability, however a tasty beer that regardless of alcohol goes down quite smooth and finishes nicely."
"Drinkability: This is a very solid RIS. It's definitely a sipper. I can't see having multiple bombers in an evening, and I wouldn't really want to. This bomber will be enjoyed for the remainder of tonight, and that's exactly what I want from this beer. It's a big beer, and it lets you know that, but then again, you knew what you signed up for when you bought a beer from Stone with ""Imperial"" somewhere on the label."
"D - This beer is definitely a sipper but the aroma and taste are so exceptional that you cannot resist having another one ... or two."
"D - For RIS's this one sets the standard for drinkability. Very smooth - no hotness from the alcohol. Everything is balanced really well. Complex and filled with roasty flavors and aromas. Very, very good."
"Keep in mind, this review was donbe AFTER downing an Older Viscosity and a 90 Min, so even in a drunken state this beer will still knock your dick in the dirt."
"Overall, a great brew. I would have been extremely pissed if I didn't have two bottles of this, as the first one was horribly infected. Thankfully the second bottle put my fears aside and I can't wait to have more of this."
"Drinkability: One of the best. A 12 oz is nice-- you want more, but shouldnt have it. This is the last of my 2008s, time to start in on the 2009s."
"Overall, this is great beer, one of the best I've had. I would love to try an older version and see how it ages."
"The beer is lightly carbonated, just enough to let the flavors work together and the beer move through the mouth. The alcohol is just present enough to let you know you're dealing with a big beer, but not cloying or overpowering. Compared to the 09 I have previously tried, the 08 blows it away, very nice."
"Lets face it. This is no session beer. It is a big beer full of flavor that will warm your inards on cool fall evening."
"Amazing beer, pleasing to all senses, nothing that disappoints, and a fine example of the style. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability- It is a sipper, not for the ABV but for the heaviness and tastes."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a black wonderful consistency with a brown/ dark tan full head, two fingers. The head faded and left good lacing as the beer went down. The aroma is immediate roasted malt with hints of coffee and some chocolate. These smells mirror the tastes as you sample this beer. It is surprisingly smooth and palatable for a Russian Stout and could use a touch more body. The easy drinking quality of this beer makes it a good stout for people used to lighter beers. Due to the light carbonation combined with the perceived thickness I would give this style points and say it is a very enjoyable beer. After enjoying many of the other Stone offerings I was happy to try one that is not for all of us hop heads and continue to be impressed with their offerings."
"Consumed: 11/9/2009"
"D: I've been waiting for this one for a while. Glad to see that there was a bottle sitting in a local establisment for me to finally crack it open. One bomber was enough to make me feel pretty good during monday night football. Go steelers!"
"Poured into a tulip glass it produces a 5 mm brown head that leaves little lacing. The color is very dark, almost black, but with no cloudiness. The aroma is very slightly hopped with a hint of coffee. The taste is uber strong roasted coffee and chocolate with malt sweetness and a hint of bitterness. It feels sinfully thick and rich with moderate carbonation. I could drink more than one of these in an evening but my conscience would bother me."
"Note: On a second tasting, I noticed that the taste can be very similar to sherry at times. This beer is still one of the best I've ever had."
"Drinkability- This is awesome. I love it. Perfect for after dinner digestion which is what I need every night!"
"Notes: This is one of the brews that early on opened my taste buds to the US craft scene. I must have had one of the early releases since it must have been 01 or 02 when I first had it. I was just amazed at the variety of stouts in the country and almost by chance I ordered to have this one and was psyched to see a bomber land on my table, and totally awed when I tasted it. A lot has happened since and while I still like it, I don't find it as extraordinary as I once did. It might be part of the brew but certainly I have expanded my palate. This revisit to Stone's RIS was nice but fell short of the memories I had from those early years in the US."
"M/D- the feel of this beer is what really sets it off IMO. It's so thick and creamy with just a subtle carbonation to remind you that this beverage is a beer, not something from Starbucks. I could drink a bomber of this stuff every night. At least untill my liver completely shuts down. It's just one of those beer where you can't put down the glass. It is a BIG beer, though, which can slow you down eventually."
"D: very drinkable, defiantly not session-able one bomber is enough for one sitting"
"D- Doesn't drink like it's 10.5%. A really well made beer. I agree with Stone, buy a case."
"D-Very nice Beer, gonna try to finish this bomber by myself. Normally I would share this beer with at least one other person."
"D: A sipper if there ever was one. Still, the flavors are rich and decadent, though not overpoweringly so. Complexity keeps it very interesting, but it's still balanced and coherent. A well-crafted beer, and one that will need to still sit in my cellar probably another year before I take another crack at it. Still, I'm quite pleased that I decided to open this bottle tonight."
"Drinkability: excellent sipper. Will have again"
"So we have to trek on, the burns in our thighs, ignore, they don't matter. Press on for a brighter tomorrow, because the world is governed by force. Our heartbeats pound, every breath screams in our heads, Death or Glory, Death or Glory."
"Pours a dark cola color with no light able to get through. There is a brownish head that is thick and gives way to some moderate lacing. The smell is of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and a slight alcohol smell. The taste is of chocolate tones with a roasted malt backbone, the taste mask the alcohol fairly well, however, the taste of alcohol becomes more prevelant the more you consume this beer. The mouthfeel was silky yet a little slick, the alcohol presence i thought was felt more through the mouthfeel than the taste. Overall it is a very good beer, however, after consuming more and more I began to notice the mouthfeel coming out more and more along with the alcohol, overall a solid good beer."
"M/D: The bitterness is biting initially. The finish is dry and malty, incredibly smooth down the pipe. There is a silky character to this beer. Despite the high ABV, this is so delicious that I wish I had some of this every night."
"This is a top-notch beer...one to be reckoned with for sure."
"Drinkability-Very drinkable. The fact that it goes down so smoothly and that the alcohol is masked so well is even more impressive."
"Mouthfeel is good, not too thick not thin at all. The flavor is sweet, with a lot of roast in the back. I can taste some of the alcohol. High drinkability. The roast completely clears leaving no aftertaste. This is a superb RIS."
"good beer though"
"This is one hell of a beer. Would definitely be enjoyable if it were 20 below. Had an 07 vintage of this a few days ago, still had a big alcohol kick but the molasses sweetness and fruit came through much more."
"First off, the name to me is funny but a fitting, mocking style of names. Stone's Russian Imperial Stout, named Imperial Russian Stout, just begs for the chance to hear someone make the mistake of disorganizing the set of words. The beer pours a thick deep black with a mocha head that depletes into a brown soapy film with some lacing down the glass. The initial smell is a deep licorice, with some roasty dark chocolate. The taste of the beer is quite opposite, with a bitter black coffee and dark chocolate up front, and a licorice sweet with some alcohol heat on the back. It has an oily thick sweetness to it on the mouth. A very thick beer, perfectly low carbonation. Honestly, the 10% punch this beer packs is suprisingly masked. Stone comes across as a beer that pulls no punches so the lack of the alcohol heat is a pleasant surprise, although on second thought, such a drinkable beer at 10.5% is a touch sinister. Well played, Stone."
"D- Even though this isn't the best and most flavorful RIS I have had, I could drink a lot of these, which makes this RIS much more dangerous then others. Definitely get this and try it fresh and try it after a few months, the flavor changes."
"The taste is up front very alcoholic, with very intense smokey leaves, prunes and rum, sweetness with hot, spicey alcohol and just barely dominant leafy-spicey bitterness. It starts too intense and a bit harsh, with sweet prune aftertaste and alcoholic warmth. It reveals nothing underneath. However, it then settles down into a more charascterful, more balanced and complex beer. It stays fairly intense, but not overly so, with strong charred leaves, strong alcohol, a bit rummy, slightly burnt prunes, some spice and leaves. It becomes much more drinkable at the same time. It is slightly oily but not very."
"Had a very dark brown/black appearance. There was little foam, but that may have been a result of the waiter not picking it up right away from the bartender. The smell and taste were much more subdued than I was expecting. Coffee was present in both, but was fairly subtle. I was surprised at the subtly of this beer since Stone is so aggressive in other beer styles. I expected an aggressive coffee flavor. Instead, I tasted a rich complexity of coffee and chocolate balancing each other. It was suprisingly sweet and light even though it had a thick mouthfeel. It reminded me of a porter with more complexity. Dangerously drinkable for a 10.5% ABV. One really needs to be careful drinking this beer because the alcohol is entirely masked. This is really and excellent beer in every way."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - Surely, but only one at a time! This is a great example of an intense stout that was really well made."
"I look forward to get the other older IRS's in bottles during the SD Beer Week."
"*** Aged 1 yr notes- the raisin and dark fruit seems to have subsided slightly, the alcohol is less present, and tastes are working in conjunction, rather than fighting. hops not noticeable. much creamier and easier to drink."
"D- Really great. The alcohol isn't hidden per say but only shows itself in bourbon flavors and not too much in the actual burn. So I am really loving this beer. Cheers"
"I highly recommend this one and to date is probably my favorite Russian Imperial stout because of the complexity of it. If you can buy a few and drink them every couple of months and enjoy the journey of the beer."
"D- This is a sickly drinkable beer from Stone. But hey what do you expect from them? I have a couple more in the cellar that I'm going to sit on for a little while to see what happens to them. Nothing but good things I just know it!"
"2008 (18 months old): Same mouthfeel and apperance. The major difference that my friend and I noticed was the alcohol bite in the nose and taste of this year's release is big, much more than that of the 2009. I guess that makes sense as there might be a bit of yeast reacting in this one. Have 8 more bottle of this, can't wait to try one a few years down the road."
"I could drink two of these, but would probably not want to in one sitting."
"For $5.50 a bomber, this is an amazing deal. Also, widely available. Another amazing example from Stone."
"Nice, really nice. Definite charred, roasted notes on the taste with cocoa and even French roast coffee making an appearance. The appearance is dark, opaque and alluring. Alcohol carries a punch; not so much in the taste (though it does have the warmth) but in the affects on the brain. Definitely a beer that is drinkable but probable safe in single 22 oz. servings."
"This is a really really great RIS. With its price and accessibility this will definitely be one of my regulars now."
"D: Very tasty and solid in every way. Can't find too much wrong with this beer other than some of the flavors being too strong, but that is not necessarily a bad thing."
"Best beer I've had this year hands down! Drinkable??? Um....yes!"
"Tastes of coffee and molasses, dark fruits and slight hop bite is perceivable. Dark chocolate and toffee flavors. Feels a bit oily, but is smooth as silk on the way down. Not very light, but also not too thin. Just about perfect. Very drinkable, maybe a little too so. Watch out, that % might sneak up on you."
"Even mouthfeel, perhaps just a tad slick, tingly finish, a bit tannic finish with a definite warming up the cheeks and tongue. Tasty beer and very drinkable."
"D- definitely a sipper, the 22oz took about an hour to go down, stronger flavor as it warms"
"Absolutely a fantastic brew but leaves me underwhelmed. Drinks wonderfully easy and is remarkably enjoyable. The shortcomings are not deal breakers but more or less personal preference for the style. Definitely one to revisit in the future. While I came away moderately disappointed Stone IRS is truly a top notch RIS."
"This beer challenges me a bit more than I like, but it's absolutely of the highest quality. If you're a fan of what this beer is aiming to be, then you'll be in heaven."
"A great stout from a great brewery, thanks Stone, you guys rule!"
"Overall, I am really enjoying this beer and I am glad the serving size is a 12 oz bottle. A bomber would be too much for me. I like, but it is nothing I am falling in love with. A great beer none the less!"
"Tom and Analise"
"Drinkability is good, delicious beer but not amazing in its drinkability - any beer where I can literally feel the alcohol burn shouldn't be getting higher than a 4 from me, even if I do believe it fits well with the flavor profile."
"D: Very good. More than a year in the cellar was really good for this one."
"D: Fairly easy drinking beer, has a lot of nice flavors and strong flavors, but the booze is just noticeable enough to not really want to crack another one open. One 22oz serving is more than enough. Nice beer though, strong flavors, and deserves the respect it gets."
"Exquisite appearance. A jet black body supports a god finger of long lasting mocha head, which produces sheets of lace. This could be textbook!Lightly smoky aroma, with hints of cocoa powder and coffee. The flavour puts me in mind of an imperial oatmeal stout. Off the bat I taste oats mixing in with a rich melange of roasted malts. Some dark fruit, tobacco and alcohol round things out. Its very good all round, but its still not top tier in my oppinion - rather just solidly made. Smooth, medium body with restrained carbonation."
"For a beer that is relatively inexpensive, and is always available, I wonder why I seek out other stout's? Do I see myself looking for something better, something to put this over-the-top? The fact of the matter is, I am looking for something that just so happens to be right in front of my face. Highly recommended! ~"
"Ahhh, the beer that got me into imperial stouts. This beer is just about the model of what a drinkable RIS should taste like. Nice roasted flavors, a small alchohol burn, and medium body make this one of the best of its kind (and by the far the best of mass produced RIS beers). I love that these now come in 12oz bottles."
"Had a glass of the '06 vintage and it was far and away the best stout I have ever tasted. Poured nice and dark, nearly opaque, with a perfect coffee-like foam on top that was never-ending. The smell was absolutely sensational. Loads of sweet malty flavors, chocolate, nougat, caramel, vanilla and a slight smoky aroma. One of the most powerful aromas I've ever had in a stout, it just leaped out of the glass. The taste delivered pretty much what the aroma promised. The bitterness was more pronounced in the taste but well integrated with the malt flavors. The bet way to describe it is that it tasted like a Toblerone bar, midway between milk and dark chocolate with a nougat/honey biscuity quality. Full-flavored with a nice medium body. I couldn't find anything wrong with this beer. One of the best brews I've had in my life. As I said, I've only had the '06 vintage so I'm not sure how the new vintages will compare. That being said, I would definitely like to hold on to this for a few years but I'm sure it's pretty close to perfect in it's freshest state. Absolute must try."
"Would def drink again very drinkable"
"song: jackson browne - ""somebody's baby"""
"I had an '09 vintage RIS from a trade with fsvan in late June and it had been sitting in my mini fridge just chillin' until tonite. Perfect for a late night when the wife's gone to bed and you're watching a college football game on the tube. I have gone beer-less for four or five days so this is a nice beer to break the ice again. Priced at $7.69 at Midtown Liquors in Nashville, TN, it's respectfully priced for a beer with such a good reputation. Initially, the appearance is the best thing going. But I'm going to give this one time to warm up to room temp before I proceed on my review... Contrary to my wife, who believes all beer is the same, this Stone offering is an EXCELLENT example of an Imperial Russian Stout. As it warms up, I can really smell the roastiness, coffeeness, and taste the oily goodness. Yum. Will definitely need to pick up another on my next trip to the beer store. This is my new favorite from Stone. Great job, guys."
"D - Pretty drinkable for the ABV and style."
"D: As far as 10+% beers go, this one goes down easy! But take your time - this is best enjoyed slowly."
"D - Ummm @ 10.5% ABV and 22 oz bottles, 1 or 2 tops. :P"
"D: Pretty drinkable for the style, although I like my stouts a little creamier and without the heavy carbonation this one presents. Still pretty good, but leaves me longing for more."
"Drinkability: frankly, most RISs cannot break the 4.0 drinkability limit for me. The flavors are usually great, but the cumulative effect of all that malt plus the Herculean alcoholic content just pull that number down. After some consideration, though, I think Stone's RIS rates a bit higher ... it's just plain good."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. I feel like I need to be drinking this for some momentous occasion. I honestly feel like I'm dishonoring the beer by simply enjoying it as an after dinner treat."
"I can't lie. I've enjoyed this grumpy old man. But it doesn't rate anywhere near the top of the RIS list for me. Then again, I haven't experienced Stone RIS with some age on it. But I'm also of the opinion that you shouldn't rate something based on what you project it to be years down the road."
"Drinkability: A very nice RIS. Strong, but smooth at the same time. Taste wasn’t as complex as I would like and the nose wasn’t that appealing to me, but an overall great beer."
"First when pouring the beer into a tulip glass from a twenty-two ounce bottle the head seemed to dissipate as the fluid levels increased. I was slightly discourage to see this, but then took a smell. And again a little more disappointment. The smell almost too light to pickup was not bad, but was nothing to bragging to your friends about. Tiny hints of espresso and chocolate arose from the glass. I tipped the glass took the first sip. Ah utter bliss! They say don't let looks decieve you and this holds true with this beer! Very rich in the dark chocolate flavor with a fair balance of espresso to break through the boldness of the chocolate, smooth carmal flavors that flow over the peripherals of the tongue and a superb syrupy finish that coats the mouth. Most definately a pleasant sipping beer for after dinner while watching TV or chating with friends."
"(Tasted Aug 24, 2009)"
"The feel of this beer is a bit strong with a high ABV. It does have a warming feel to it. It is medium bodied and goes down well. A fantastic beer."
"I can see why people recommend aging this a year and that is definitely what I will be doing with my other bottle in my cellar. Hopefully it takes down the heat and mellows out. Until then, I do not recommend drinking this fresh."
"On Tap at the Shepherd and the Knucklehead. This is one hell of a beer. Perhaps the best of its kind I have ever had. Superb mouthfeel, thick and chewy but not overpowering at all, almost like drinking a very fine espresso. Chocolate malts and coffee are very apparent. Really a world class RIS."
"A top 10 beer for me."
"D - A great Imperial Stout. I''m starting to really appreciate what Gerg Koch has achieved with Stone, there are some fantastic beers available from the brewery and this is one of the best. Their Imperial Russian Stout is smooth and aromatic, with a perfect balance of flavours. Definitely a beer that has to be savored. There will be a few of these going into my cellar."
"M&D: creamy soft on the carbonation, fulsome on the flavour while the alc. treads elegantly as a much lighter stout. I disagree with the back label's statement, as I don't feel any guilt/sin while tasting the ale, but I think it's to do with how mellow this bottled ale has turned into in less than a year's time~~ Compared with the other American RIS tasted recently (incl. Great Divide's Yeti, Flying Dog's Imperial Russian Porter, Left Hand's RIS, and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout), I find this one the most balanced amongst them all, as the hops seem to have melted in the magical mixture. In many ways this is not unlike a balanced English RIS added with a bit more hop aroma+flavour - highly enjoyable."
"Man oh man is this one epic brew. Its a sipper to be sure. Loads of complexity await each delicious sip. Its very easy drinking upfront. The alcohol seems almost non existent. AS the beer warms up, the alcohol becomes much more prevalent. The last few sips definitely have an alcohol bite. All in all though this is still one incredible brew."
"D: Surprisingly high considering its thick and robust flavors."
"Mouthfeel-Full body. Chewy. Velvety feeling coats the tongue. Strong but smooth alcohol warmth. Medium carbonation. Dry finish."
"07 vintage on tap pours a pitch black with some aroma - mostly a smell of hops. Has a nice head that laces the glass well. Complex hops and dark roast lend to a medium mouthfeel with a smooth roasty taste and long hop finish. I was a little surprised how the hops played a role in this. Will be interesting to try different years down the road. Nice brew."
"Overall a very good stout, one that I have tried numerous times and only reviewed now. Great for the price too."
"I was in general quite pleased with this beer - poured form the bottle into a delirium noel snifter. I particularly liked the nice thick mouthfeel and creaminess. Altogether a very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is typical for a bigger stout I would say, meaning there is a sticky, lingering body to it rather than a crisp, watery feeling. A great beer all around."
"D: Hard to put down as its very thick and filling. Strong flavors make it hard to drink lots of."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is apparent, but not overpowering. a solid RIS through and through. cheers!"
"D- easy but not after the to many"
"It pours a rich, dark color with a thin tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee. Great mix of dark flavors the lead to an amazing taste. The full body felt think and creamy, but didn't slow me down. Every sip lead to another, not wanting to put the glass down. I could have drank myself to death, and with 10%+ abv, i very well may have."
"D - Due to the high ABV I wouldn't call this beer ""sessionable"" but it does drink easy. So rich you're better of savoring every sip."
"Serving Type: 22ox Bottle."
"D- For me, perfect drinkability, but I like them strong and can handle the heavy hitters. I could see this knocking a few people over, but right up my alley."
"D: For me, the poster boy of a mid-grade priced but high-grade taste RIS. This beer is what its all about and I can never wait to have another."
"d-Get it. This beer is incredible. very good presentation of the style. Full of flavor but not so much as to turn one off."
"As I expect from Stone, this is a huge brew with massive flavor exactly to style."
"Using @Mebuzzard's criteria of ""only half a beer left?!"" versus ""I still have half a beer?!"" for drinkability, the Stone RIS does very well. The front sweetness balances so well with the chocolate malt and carbonation as to keep me quaffing. If the alcohol character was either mellowed slightly or masked a bit it would be even better, as I imagine it will be next year."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I wish I had bought another bottle."
"D: Wonderfully sippable; the smell could use some work though."
"A classic from Stone no doubt. Full flavored, full bodied, full everything, RIS that leaves nothing on the table. I love the fact that you don't have to give up an arm or a leg to procur if either. Great stuff!"
"I don't see myself having more than one of these."
"What an excellent example of the style. I was worried that something from stone would somehow be hop dominated even at the RIS level. Wrong. The balance of this beer is quite impressive, the mouthfeel is definitely the key player here, incredible smoothness brings flashing notes of chocolate and licorice. Slight bitterness really integrates with the carbonation to prevent any kind of cloying sweetness, which definitely ups the drinkability. Overall a very good beer, surprisingly true to style, not overwhelming but blended. Excellent."
"12 oz goes down like a dream and going for two would be filling but not difficult. At $6 a bomber Rasputin and Storm King are better deals."
"All I can say about this beer is WOW!! It pours thick and black. The smell is just a wonderful blend of coffee and chocolate. The smell alone is enough to win me over. I had a 22 oz. bomber. The first glass I drank chilled, but recomend letting it warm as I did with my second glass. It really brings all of the flavors out. As far as I'm concerned the best Russian Stout out there."
"This one's almost black, oily with a respectable beige head that didn't last too long. A nice aroma of coffee and chocolate. The taste followed suit with coffee foremost, chocolate second and a bit of anise. Rich, heavy, oily is the feel; as a stout should be. If you put away a bomber, that should be plenty. The tastes were different cold vs. warmed at room temperature, both enjoyed."
"2009 Spring release that I'm drinking has an alc/vol of 10.5%, not 10.8%"
"Got this bomber - uh, somewhen. It's dated 2005. and doesn't say ""Russian"" on it. Poured a small finely bubbled frothy foamy head and some lace. Color is absolutely opaque brown. Aroma is quintessential imperial stout but with a subtle enticing ripe red cherry quality. Flavor's about the same. In spite of the power of the beer, it's oddly drinkable. Righteous beer!"
"So easily drinkable. I am not afraid to say this is top two or three Impys I have ever had. I have two more bottles from 2006 and cant wait to try them."
"D - Pretty good RIS at work here. I'd love to cellar a bottle for a year or so and see what the results are."
"This is an exceptional beer and probably the best in the stone colledtion. It is one of a handful of beers that explains why the imperial russian and american stouts are always at the top of the llst in beer popularity. Great bitterness, malt and alcohol. A marriage made in heavan."
"D - At first this is slightly moorish then quickly creamsoda overkill and you dont know if you re in 21st century London or a 1950s american movie"
"Just such a smooth brew so velvety just glides down. Very light carbonation. Really love this beer can hardly taste the 10.5%. Have one aging in my basement that I hope I can keep my hands off of."
"D- I could sip on this beer all night. Its just plain good."
"D: Despite being approximately a year old, it's still somewhat boozy. Very tasty though and it will only get better."
"Second time enjoying this brew, i will be buying more to cellar asap."
"Stone Imperial Russian Stout is a pitch black ale with a huge, fluffy brown head that has some oily bubbles on it. The head retention is incredible. It leaves huge, thick sheets with sip lines on the glass. The aroma is roasty and slightly sweet. There are notes of coffee, caramel, chocolate, alcohol and grass. It is thick, full bodied, heavy and smooth. The finish is dry and acidic. The flavor is roasty and has notes of salmiakki and coffee. It's not very sweet. The finish is medicinal and alcoholic. There is a lingering aftertaste of salmiakki. It's a pretty darn good beer."
"Drinkability= This beer is going to be another fabulous beer in a few years. Now is not the time to drink. However, this is still a good beer. Fits the style to a ""T."""
"D: As per style, a little heavy to drink throughout the night. However, if I were to go Stout for a night this would be it."
"Good stuff, can't wait to enjoy one in the winter months."
"I felt privileged to have found it and had been looking everywhere for it, I bought all 4 they had on the shelves and I do not regret it at all.. I wish I had a place to cellar my last one, but I will be saving it as long as I can stand to see it sit in my fridge. I will probably go back to the store and see if they can order a case of these so I can serve at my wedding next year."
"This is a drinkable beer, but that ABV will surprise you. Excellent example of an RIS."
"This beer poured a deep dark black with a two-finger dark tan head. The smell is a mix of strong black coffee, very dark fruits, and some melted dark chocolate. The taste starts off with a huge hit of sweet malt that gives way to some slightly bitter coffee and dark chocolate that gives way to a bit of real dark fruit and alcohol in the background. The mouthfeel is so thick and creamy it's unreal with some real pleasant warming from the alcohol. The drinkability doesn't suffer even though this is a big serious brew that means business. A fantastic version of the style."
"I did not think I would finish the whole bomber myself, but I quickly found myself reaching for the bottle to replenish my glass. Pours smooth and dark with a dark gray brown head that foretells of the rich goodness below it. The nose hints at sweet chocolate roasted malt. So smooth and creamy on the palate, balanced and flavorful. The roasted malt up front mixed with caramelized fruit and a threat of sweetness the never materializes. The finish is dry with lite hop bitterness. A beer so good you can't help but stare at the glass as you drink it, amazed by the goodness it contains. It is the balance that makes this great, a perfect combination of complex flavors that are never overbearing."
"the 2009 is no let-down. it might have just convinced me to pop my 2008 that's in the cellar soon."
"surprisingly enough (i know i've seen it before, just never picked it up...good beer for the inaugural review), this is the first time i've actually had this beer. will probably pick up a couple to cellar."
"I would love to leave these in my basement for a long while to see how it changes these - very tasty. This will be a brew I will have ready for winter every year - a damn fine stout."
"Easy enough to drink even if it is a bit warm out for such a beer."
"D: well one 750ml at a pop is all I want, and I love heavy beers."
"Drinkability: This is a wow beer and easily the best I have had from Stone. This does not have the hoppy taste I am used to from them. It is incredibly balanced. Well worth the hype, this is up there with Pozharnik as my favorite in the style. High ABV makes this a one time for me, but wanting more the second I finish."
"For having a high ABV, it's incredibly drinkable. Perfect for a cold winter night."
"Well I've been waiting tfor this for some time now so here it goes. First off it's black hole dark. Holy crap it's black. The aroma is malty with hints of chocolate and coffee maybe molasses. It didn't smell as good as I thought it would though. The flavor is very rich and decadent. Like a piece of chocolate coffee cake. I was a bit suprised at how present the alcohol was in the flavor but at 10.8 abv what are yopu gonna do? The mouthfeel is about what it should be. Mild carb fills my mouth and hangs around for a bit. This is a sipper for sure. I felt no pain after downing a 16oz glass of this bad boy. I left the tasting wanting more though. I will have to try this beer again soon."
"Hard to pair with a food that this wouldn't overpower--maybe a rich, chocolate dessert, or well-seasoned beef. Best to get a bomber or two and share with your fellow stout drinkers."
"Out of a bomber this beer was an opaque, crude-oil black color. The brown, one-finger head displayed decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was rich and sweet, molasses, coffee, chocolate male and caramel malt. The flavors were of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, sweet pipe tobacco and a hoppy bitterness that balanced the malt elements nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation right on-target. Not the most complex example of the style but certainly an accurate one."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best. It is really well-balanced, but the strength of the alcohol is definitely too prominent."
"Verdict: Certainly worth all of the the hype, Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is a damn fine beer well worth seeking out for any Stout fan. As good as this tastes now, I can't wait to see how this ages."
"Drinkability: It's a sipper, no doubt, and I'm especially glad this one is being split as I would be passed out on the floor if I tried to drink an entire 22 oz. bottle on my own, so yeah... The flavors are mind-blowingly present and exactly what the bottle tells you you're going to get, but it's a little bit and heavy for much more than one glass."
"This beer is great. Very sophisticated and hearty. A high alcohol content helps boost this beer above the rest."
"D - Very drinkable, especially considering the 10.5% abv. Absolutely delicious with a complex flavor profile and a great balance that manages to be a monster on the malt side of things without being overly sweet. While it probably wouldn't be a great idea to put down more than one bomber of this, I thought it was stellar in all aspects."
"Great beer. I will definitely welcome having this in my house again."
"drinkability: One of the top imperial stouts out there. Loved and will drink again"
"Limited Spring 2009 release. Pours pitch black even when held to the light, tan head. Smell: soft and sweet, something like a liquor soaked chocolate cake, black plum, roasty, caramel, a bit of coffee, effervescent alcohol. Not as pungent as some ris, but very nice. Taste: this one is pretty hot at 10.5. The booze and a bunch of sweet, syrupy malts are cut with a pretty serious hop note... roasty, unsweet chocolate, anise, dark chocolate. Rich viscous mouthfeel. Will need to grab a couple to sit until the cold(er) months."
"This beer is remarkably drinkable. The stout of all stouts, I feel compelled to sing its praises. Not a sessionable choice by any means, this stout is certainly a meal. Sip slowly or with great vigor, this beer will flood your senses any way you attempt to engage with it."
"D-Very smooth drinking for a beer of this stature. Please, if you can, treat yourself to this wonderfully brewed ale. You won't be dissapointed. But don't drink too much, it sneeks up on you..."
"Mouthfeel is good and thick. Drinkable? This has to be the least drinkable beer I've tried for those that I could get down...no one I know who likes drinking good beers would think this was worth any amount of money but to get drunker faster. I drink for the flavor, so this is a disaster. I finished it as cold as I could get it over a few days, a small glass a day--all I could stand. Surprisingly, Victory Imperial Stout is hands down better in my book...this wouldn't make it into my glass again unless it were free. Stone is not for me."
"Taste: Unbelievable! The thickness in the pour really comes through in the taste. Ok. Maybe that goes into the mouthfeel category. So, I will combined them. The rich malt blend flows smoothly over the tounge. It only has a very slight bite at the finish. I really would not know that it was 10.5% if it wasn't on the label."
"drinkability: very accessible taste and mouthfeel make this an entirely drinkable brew that i will certainly return to soon, thumbs up thrice!"
"D - This is a great beer to savor. It's got a huge kick but it's so smooth and easy to drink."
"Lives up the hype. Not an everyday beer whatsoever but absolutely worth a try."
"All the hype, all the rumors and here it is in Austin. Splitting a 22oz bomber with a buddy, good call. Pours black as the night with no stars or no moon. Smells of malts, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is smooth to start with but then look out. There is a sweetness that lingers but the alcohol is there... and you get reminded every sip. This is a big beer and it lets you know. I enjoyed it as a big sipper, was fun while I had it."
"O. Amazing beer, the time does amazing things for this beer."
"This extremely dark beer features a small but persistent head and some modest lacing. The aroma consists of lightly roasted, dark chocolate notes, with hints of cocoa powder. Excellent flavor, deliciously malty but never sweet, and highly bitter without bitterness being the dominant flavor. The taste mostly mirrors the aroma, but is richer and very smooth. The body is surprisingly light for the strength--a plus, since the heaviness of many RIS's is why I'm not a big fan of the style. Very well crafted, like nearly everything Stone has done."
"Better a bit cooler, IMO. As it warms up the alcohol flavor becomes more of a factor and less of a background note."
"D- Truly worth the hype. I was expecting something kingly and was not disappointed."
"Drinkability is pretty nice for such a big sipper."
"Had the 2009 version again in 2010, hasn't improved and found it less impressive. Good RIS but not great. Lacking complexity compared to others in it's class."
"Less complex than I expected, and much more drinkable than I thought it would be. A great beer, but I question its really high ratings. I suspect aging would do wonders. If I see it again at the great price I found this one at I might put one down myself."
"this brew pours up a clear pale yellow color. Just joshin. this brew is solid black with a decent light brown head. decent lacing on this mutha sucka. the nose is a lil bit too much alky, some yeast, chocolate, coffee. I taste big malts, total roastiness, cocoa, again coffee, nice hop balance and bitterness in the finish. full bodied and low to medium carbo. A lil too hot and a little too bitter to be in my top stouts list but definitely a solid ale."
"I would gladly pay double for another (some other day (it's heavy))."
"A world class beer."
"Clearly a standard for the style, this beauty of a Russian Imperial would have made the Czar's blush. Thick, chewy notes of dark chocolate brownie batter blend with roasted malt grains and spiced rum. Finishes with a spicy linger of musty hops, and more dark chocolate booziness. Thick mouthfeel is viscous and chewy, becoming somewhat sticky at times. A year or two in the cellar should definitely improve the body, whose drinkability is lowered due to its behemoth nature. Still, Stone's IRS is a worthy addition to their line-up, and a fantastic beer on the whole."
"Mouthfeel was nice and crisp. Almost a little too spritzy. Yet, this had a mellow creaminess that aided drinkablilty. Flavor was of roasted cocoa beans, wood, alcohol, espresso, and finished slightly charred. This was a very good brew. Dang. Perfect blend of flavor and mouth. Drinkable - freaking spot on. The alcohol, though not present to the tongue, is knocking me down some. I feel good. Nice work Stone."
"Pours almost black in color with a large brown head. Big, burnt, toasty malt nose, vanilla cream, chocolate, some coffee and light alcohol presence. Smooth and super creamy, its amazing the quality of ingredients used while still keeping a 5.99 shelf price. A little more body wouldnt hurt, i guess it just doesnt feel as big as it is...or should be...if that makes any sense. Amazing beer none the less, although this is my first time reviewing this beer ive had the past 3 years fresh and the 2009 vintgage is the best ive had. Great job Stone. Go buy a couple bottles asap."
"Spring 2009 release. Pours a used-motor-oil black with a creamy dark beige/light brown head that disappears to leave a bit of lacing. Smells of Drambuie-soaked raisins, dates, and other dark fruits, as well as a load of chocolate and some brown sugar. It would be pleasant if it weren't overpoweringly boozy. The more it warms, the worse it gets. More cocoa and dark fruits in the taste, and again, loads of alcohol. The initial chocolaty sweetness turns to intense bitterness from heavy hopping. Slightly astringent as well. Warming alcohol-laden finish. Thick body with nice carbonation. Too intensely boozy to be very drinkable. This might have the potential to be nice after a couple of years, but a fresh bottle tastes like chocolate macerated in port with a few dabs of soy sauce added for good measure. Poured half the bomber down the drain."
"All this review should say is: HOLY F@#K, but I'll elaborate. This is by far the most looked forward to beer of the year for me, and lemme tell ya, the difference between bottle and cask makes this even rape harder even more. My first cask-conditioned beer, and wow, I was drunk halfway through my glass. This HAS to be stronger than the bottle! HAS TO BE! Slightly absurd! Felt nitro-y as well, VERY creamy and smooth, bitter, and alcoholy at the same time, but it blends oh so perfectly. Hard to scoff down, but it is one beast of a beer. Drink a chalice and you are DONE."
"MF&D - the feel is a bit thin for how much ass this beer can kick; I would have it thicker. the drinkability is brought down by the alcohol pervasiveness, once I had found it there was no losing it out of. the carbonation is small, fizzy carbonation on the tip of my tongue"
"This is one of the best Imperial Stouts that I have ever had. That is saying a lot, given that I have tried dozens from many different lands. Color is opaque, smell is very alcoholic. It is very drinkable, but don't have too many- you may wake up in someone's bed that you don't even know (and trust me, she/he will not be to your standards)!"
"Overall, this is a great beer that cellars well. The smoky flavor in particular is more notable in the older vintages, whereas ""fresher"" editions are hoppier, crisper, and a bit lighter on the tongue."
"I have had this several times now. Each time is a treat. Highly recommended."
"Delicious beer that begs to be drank all the time. I have got to say, I have been craving an RIS for a while and this one has done the trick."
"2009 is another great year for the Stone IRS."
"From what I see, this beer is probably too hot for most people to fully enjoy when its fresh, but I think it's just fine now... maybe a couple months age would do it good, but less than a year for sure."
"Hell yes, what a delicious beer. A rip-roaring RIS that is also a delicious treat. Raw, but refined. Heavy, but smooth. A perfect balancing act, showcasing the art of the Imperial Stout. Bravo!"
"An excellent beer.. one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had the privilege of trying."
"..and i don't like the contraction, apostrophe E-M,..as far as i am concerned his name is ""Dig Them"". You're not welcome here, Dig Them ... Pours a darkest of the dark brown-black , with a fantastic hearty dark coco head, big with great lacing .. . wow, so easy to drink, the abv is so well hidden , great roast level and a balance that is hard to beat!.. . for a pretty widely available RIS, this is fan-freakin-frakin-flippin-sex orgy in the living room-tastic!!!.. . Aromas include sharp molasses, dark coco chocolate, light alcohol, maduro tobacco leave, dark dark hard wood .. . has really distracted me from the Dig 'em fiasco! .. . . This could get you in trouble with its super smoothness, but it maybe lacks abit of complexity for me, there are definitely better Imperial Stouts, but at the somewhat decent price and availability, i can see why people talk... . I will also say, i bought a couple of bottles, and plan on re-rating after a year.. . .. You just got dunked on by Patrick Chewing!"
"Although alcohol catches up with you it's got drinkability since it's a bold brew. East-coast like. Very good, but I have other favorites. Cheers!"
"D - Surprisingly high for the style but maybe not as much due to the ABV. Still very nice brew."
"Stone was gracious enough to pour growler fills of their 2006 vintage of IRS and boy did you know I was going to be there. Stone's IRS is always a must get and living only minutes from the brewery ensure my cellar is going to be chock-full of this specialty. It pours like motor oil, thick and black, the nose isn't as apparent as the 2009 version but definite chocolate and coffee tones jump right out. Mouth is GREAT! Due to the age some carbonation was lost but I thought it made for a smoother stout feel and as it warmed more coffee and smooth silky chocolate came out. This beer is a great and will remain on the top of my favs list for quite some time."
"Drinks incredibly well while playing in the realm of 10.8%, there is a little lingering bitter that makes the last couple of drinks a little tough, but still delicious."
"I'm a big fan of the RIS, I've had some better, many not as good as this offering. Sometimes I neglect staples from the better known breweries, glad I grabbed this one (and glad for Marty's 6-pack discount!)"
"Overall: An exemplary RIS, extremely complex and satisfying. Highly recommended."
"Now, I do see the potential here. This is highly regarded on BA for good reason. I am going to buy another bottle - but it's not going to be opened for a good long while. Right now, though, drinkability is really limited."
"Drinkability: Superb drinkability! Address with extreme caution!"
"Poured in to my Portsmouth tulip, pours a pitch black color with a very minimal light brown head. Had to force the pour to get even an half an inch of head to form. Head forms minimal and stays around for abit. Aroma is of a very chocolate and mallasas mix. The Malasses taste is very prominant for me and is ocompanied by the chocolate and coffee flavors. The brew is thick but not overly thick and filling. Carbonation is minimum and average for a good RIS and helps with the drinkability. The brew it's self is very tasty but watch out for the alcohol level when you have finished the 22oz it will hit you. I am very interested in sampaling the older versions of this particular brew. Will continue to cellar each year of this brew."
"D - good stuff! great blends and balance make this super smooth and easy. i had this in the fall of 08 and it was a little more harsh. for 10.8 ABV, the alcohol is hidden well. this is very smooth overall."
"Drinkability is very good, this is a good sipper. It's potency might limit, but the flavor invites a long sipping session."
"A thick oily black pour with a medium sized brown head. Aroma of roasted barley,charred malt,molasis,coffee and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is huge,malty sweet,some coffee,anise,smoke,dark roasted barley,and rasins, a smooth creamy mouthfeel,soft carbonation,lots of sticky lacing, with a slightly bitter coffee/alcohol burn finish. Another very good brew from Stone."
"22oz. Pours black with no transparency. Milk chocolaty brown head is thick but quick to dissipate. Aromas are sweet, toasty roasted malts, and chocolate - not much else. Mouth-feel is creamy and thick - coats the palate well. Tastes are bitter chocolate with hints of espresso and slight molasses. Lingering dark chocolate finish with white pepper and a hint of anise. As the ale approaches room temperature, fruity esters add to the complexity giving off notes of black cherry and black currant. Also is more boozy as it warms, although overall the alcohol is well concealed for an RIS (or IRS in this case). Really enjoyed this one. One of the better Imperial Stouts I've had, and yet another great Stone brew!"
"D - good now I think it will be even better cellared. I think one poster wondered why this came out as a spring/summer drink. I think the people at stone know that with age this will be a great winter drink so are giving us the ability to do that. My two cents anyway. Will follow up after having a chance to cellar."
"Nice thick syrupy mouthfeel, qutie drinkable, I don't know about a spring beer though, but this would be good for a cold winter night in the middle of butt fuck nowhere!"
"Some age on the bottle would surely smooth out the alcohol presence and allow greater exploration of the complexities in this devilishly delicious stout.  I would say that Stone's offering has a more complex, nuanced palate as compared to Bell's Expedition Stout (as a point of reference), but that Expedition just nudges ahead in terms of better drinkability for such a high ABV stout - but not by a wide margin!  Nonetheless, a fresh bottle of Stone's IRS is very much worthy of a purchase - it is complex and has all the hallmarks of a supreme stout, not to mention a highly agreeable price point of $5.49/bomber.  Recommended."
"D - I'm surprised by this one. I thought it would be an outstanding brew, but while not bad it's no where near as nice as expected based on everyone else's ratings on this site. Chalk it up to personal preference, but I think that this is a confusingly complicated beer that I think might improve DRASTICALLY with age (mine is a Spring 2009 batch, so it's super-young)."
"given the average of the beer, I'll probably end up trying it again just to be sure, but as of now not that impressed"
"Notes: the 4th of 5 Stone beers that I am tasting and rating this week. This is a great RIS but I have enjoyed others more (like Big Black Voodoo Daddy)."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable, but there is a lot to consume in a bomber with 10.5% alcohol."
"Poured this into a glass from a 22oz. bomber. This beer kicked my ass. Rich creamy head stayed for the duration of the brew and laced all the way down. Taste was like coffee/dark chocolate and was the thickest beer I have ever had. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. This pitch black beer is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. Definitely buying this one again. Absolutely loved it."
"Poured a deep, ddep brown almost like burn motor oil with good carbonation and big thick brown head. Nose is deep roasted malts, cocoa, espresso and a skunk soured twinge. Taste is big roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium with a big burnt taste and ABV is more noticable to me."
"D: This is a big beer that goes well with dessert. It made me all warm and fuzzy inside. A great sipper!"
"- A bit heavy for major drinking... and warm on the gut... but overall quite good for a 10.5% Stout."
"Edit: As this brew warms up the alcohol is becoming more and more evident making it a touch less desirable. I'm sure this would be alot better with some age on it."
"Cheers...."
"Pours a pitch black with a giant chocolate tan foamy head. The head lasts and leaves great lacing. Very impressive. The smell is pungent with dark fruit,raisins,plums,figs,alcohol,and cocoa. The taste is very creamy,like a chocolate shake,with cocoa,alcohol,dark fruit,roasted malt,and espresso. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing very well. A great beer,one the best I've had in a long time."
"D- Highly drinkable beer. Heavy but not filling like most beers of this style. The next time I buy some, I'm getting a case and cracking one open every 6 months or so."
"D- I had no idea the ABV was so wonderfully high. This beer is complex, but quite subtle so as not to overwhelm the senses with any one aspect."
"I feel privileged to have had this vintage on tap. I will seek out the fresh version and any other vintages I can obtain to compare. They have a tall task to match this brew."
"Pours thick black with a thin cocoa head that dissipates rather quickly in a fine ring around the glass. Deep black in appearance with a bit of mahogany around the edges of the glass. Smell is rich in roasted malts with some slight aromas of dried fruits and smoke. The flavor is full of bitter chocolate, roasted malts and a bit of coffee. There is definitely an alcohol presence in the aftertaste but it is very nice. This beer is extremely drinkable, very well done. Happy I bought a few to keep around for a couple years."
"D: Very high drinkability for the ABV. Overall, this beer belongs in the discussion of best RIS out there. Just great all around! Skal."
"Drinkability: have to watch out for this one. the ABV is high and drinks easy. This was my dessert after dinner, I could have easily had seconds and thirds."
" The taste is great with chocolate bitterness and notes of pepper and currant with a light smoke and hint of toffee in the flavor. The mild cocoa and coffee is buoyed by the hop flavor which gives a slight sweet woodiness and then the toffee-molasses comes back with mild dark brown sugar taste in the finish. This is awesome aged - I think the 2008 is the best by Stone I have ever had, just ridiculously good drinkability and I want to go out and get some to age for three years now, what a treat! Thanks John!"
"D: Another Stone success. A very nice RIS and one I look forward to having again. Personally, I couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting - it's much too flavorful - but this a wonderful beer to have every now and then."
"22oz bottle. 2007 vintage, from International liquor right next to my house. I'm guessing that not too many people in Isla Vista drink this stuff, so it was probably sitting there since the spring. Pours nearly solid black, but there's a little brown around the edges. No head, only some light brown lace. Sweet chocolate, vanilla, and almond aroma. Flavors of dark chocolate, prunes, roasted coffee. Doppelbockish. Thick and syrupy, but not overly so. Very rich and alcoholic. Was fantastic for the first glass, but by the end of the bomber it became a little cloying and intense. I think I'll share it next time."
"Slight hint of coffee and fruit. Pour a very dark motor oil black color into pint glass. Can't see light thru the glass! Very small head with little bubbles on top. Very stouty first sip with a strong alcohol backend. A very good mouthfeel of roastiness with the taste tingling with every sip. Overall, a very good Russian Imperial Stout from Stone Brewing. I could drink 2 or 3 of these in a row. Also, a good description on the back of the bottle which I always like to read especially while drinking the beer. Nice."
"Taste is heavy, a sweet malty base covered with roasted, yet mild, black and chocolate malts. Hints of coffee, molasses, figs and mocca offer a great taste. Bitterness nicely balances the roast and let the beer shine in every direction. Some hints of adjunts, like oats or rye, which give an oily character."
"Few minor twaeks and this can be as good or better that the best of them, i think it is better than the Abyss and close to Darkness and will have some work to catch the DL. IMO"
"I could drink a bunch of these, not too alcoholic feeling. A great beer."
"Drinkability: I want some more of this soooo bad! I was expecting an absolute hop-bomb from Stone, but this turned out to be delicate and harmonious. This is one beautifully addictive RIS."
"D= fabulous. One of the best ris's I've had. I really wish stone would come to MN because this is great I love it."
"Served in a duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark oily black, with an mean burnt brown colored head, really haven't seen a head like that in a while, no real lacing to write home about, so it just misses the perfect appearance mark. Nose is of rich roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffe, with hints of molasses. Taste is a little bit of a let down, i was excepting a little more bite in the taste, i don't know how much cellaring this beer hurt it. There is a strong taste of espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, but def. lacking the bitterness, I almost wish I would have drank this sooner, o well. It is pretty smooth on the mouth and is a silky velvet texture could be a little thicker though. The beer is listed at 10% and the alcohol is hidden pretty well, a sipper for sure just for the style. Overall it was kind of a letdown for me after reading so many great reviews, I don't know how much the receipe is changed each year or if cellaring the beer for 2 years hurt it."
"A fantastic example of the Imperial Russian Stout style"
"D. A sipper - I split a bomber with my wife, 11 ounces is plenty for me. This is a good beer but a little too harsh/bitter for me - I was expecting more given the high scores and hype. Not up to the caliber of Founder's RIS, Ten FIDY and Old Rasputin."
"D - This is one of those beers with which you should take your time. It takes some endurance to drink a brew this rich and complex - next time I would share it with a friend. I'm sure it ages exceptionally well. A must-try for stout lovers and adventurous beer drinkers alike!"
"The foam was a deep coffee wheat/tan color, smooth and lacey. The color was opaque/dark brown with amber/mahogany highlights in the light. The smell was of a burnt mahogany, molassis with wheat overtone and subtle fruity undertones, complex. The taste was a deep, rich molassis, wheat flavoured, nutty and a little bitter and a little sweet. Mouthfeel - heavy-bodied, smooth and rich. I had to drink it somewhat slowely to enjoy the complex taste. Drinkability - heavy and smooth - good if you like the extended time to enjoy a rich porter taste - very good session."
"Poured thick, black and beautiful. Thick brown head. Roasty, molasses aroma. Sweet, yet spicy. Roasted coffee flavor, chocolaty. Boozy after first couple of sips. Anise, raisin flavors as well. Some hop bitterness, slowly ripping at my tongue. Thick, oily mouthfeel. Nice to sip. Take your time with this one. Slowly now, warm it a bit. It definitely stands out from other RISs. I would love to buy a cache and age some."
"overall...incredible beer. well done stone."
"d- a winter warmer, a seasonal beer for me"
"My god this stout is fantastic! The flavors that play around in your mouth are just awesome. Its as if you can get different flavors in every sip. This beer is going to age well and should just meld the excellent flavors of time. I better go get my case now!"
"This beer gets great reviews for a reason. A must-try for RIS lovers."
"Without a question one of the best RIS! Drink only suffers mildly from intence ABV."
"Vintage Spring 2009. 22oz bomber poured into a Cigar City snifter. Jet plack pour with a thin mocha head that diminishes to nothing. Scattered lacing along the sides of the glass. Ruby red hues when I tilt the glass in the light. Smells of dark roasted coffee. Sweet milk chocolate. A hint of toffee or caramel. A touch of alcohol shows through in the finish. Tastes of roasted grains, a bit of dark chocolate. Sweet toffee notes towards the front of the tongue, dark roasted bitterness on the sides with a smooth alcohol warmth at the back of the throat. Carbonation is just about perfect. Finishes with a slight burnt chocolate aftertaste. Alcohol peeks its head in towards the end, but overall a very drinkable beer, especially considering its ABV. This stout deserves to be in the top 10."
"Overall this is an above average RIS. I am drinking this rather fresh and would love to buy some more to cellar as i think it would age beautifully."
"I was expecting to be let down on this, but was pleasantly surprised by a world class beer."
"Smells very roasty and sweet, very malty and a bit earthy. Pour is a super dark, near-black color with light brown head. The only thing preventing it from looking perfect is it seems like it should look a bit more viscous, a bit thicker. Tastes vey rich, roasy with a bit of dark chocolate. A slot of roasty malt with a good amount of bitterness behind it. Bitterness in aftertaste is a bit much and as it opens up the whole drnk takes on a sort of bourbony, rum-soaked-raisins flavor. Good but not great. Mouth has a crisp carbonation bite, moderate viscosity and not too chewy like most RIS's. Its definitely good and quite tasty but you really need to be in the mood for it, its not something that could be enjoyed at anytime. I didn't even finish the bottle because hte last 3 or so ounces were just too much. It would be better as single 12 oz bottles."
"Drinkability: Drink a bomber by yourself and you're down for the count. It's a slow sipper for sure, but packed with flavor so that's not a problem. This is a phenomenal beer, and unlike anything that I would have expected. Strong recommendation."
"Stone Imperial Russian Stout feels like a rainy, chilly afternoon...good for the soul, but only when you're in the perfect, laid back mood."
"I first tried this beer a while back while I was making an imperial oatmeal stout. Since then I placed this beer as one of my favorite ""big ass stouts"" that I search out whenever possible. The appearance of this beer is striking and memorizing. The think tan head flows into a meaty bold mouthfeel. As with any great stout it feels as if you can chew this brew as it swishes around your palate. The taste and smell of this beer confirms that the appearance of this beer is not false advertising. Notes of vanilla dance in the perfect balance of sweetness and alcoholic strength. Bordering on hot this beer does let you know exactly what you are imbibing without deterring you from grabbing for another."
"The bottle suggests to let it age. I may have jumped the gun on opening this one the same day I bought it. I will definitely buy an other and let it age a while, then reevaluate."
"D- Big powerful brew that can cripple a weak palate into submission. Drink with caution. Forcing this one on beer n00bs could be seen as ""cruel and unusual punishment."""
"Appearance is jet black with a little bit of head (thin film) and thick, sticks to the glass when jostled. Smell is of coffee/burnt malt. Taste is, as before, like a car bomb, in that it has a little bit of sweetness, a lot of alcohol, the roasted malt flavor and a bit of bitterness. Can't wait for this to mellow out. Definitely sticks in the mouth. Had to drink pretty slow with the alcohol."
"2008 vintage. I bumped the taste score up a 1/2 a point. The year of aging has improved the taste somewhat. It's still on the boozy side, but more flavors have appeared."
"2007 Vintage on-tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte served in a tulip glass a nice opaque black with a thin tan head. Aroma was a wonderful blend of bakers cocoa, fresh ground coffee and roasted malts. Taste was a wonderfully complex roasty blend of cocoa and coffee that gets even better as it warms, reaching the point where it is meal in itself, or a least a very fancy dessert. The beer is certainly on the heavy side, but age has served it well providing a great smoothness. This one was truly fantastic, enough for me to want to pick up a bunch of this beer and age it for years to come."
"D - Very good RIS, but not as mind-blowing as I had hoped. Regardless, this was a nice vintage brew that was quite smooth, tasty and pretty mellow overall."
"IMHO the ABV is the only inhibiting factor. Could have the will and desire to drink 8 of these brews but would never make it. Great taste, excellent body, all around a terrific beer."
"D: This beer is a monster and any stout lover is not complete without giving this bad boy a shot. I had a hard time finding anything wrong with this one...maybe a little strong on alcohol at times? Naw! Take it, drink it, love it"
"Drinkability: Well the alcohol taste was a little bit too much, but its wonderful mouthfeel just blew my mind. This is a seriously good beer, but a bomber of this and you can call it a night."
"taste is smooth, thick, dark and milk chocolate, some coffee, some roasted malt, some licorice, touch of smoke, and a little vanilla, ends dry and somewhat bitter."
"Note this was the Spring 2008 vintage"
"Has a nice coffee and brown sugar scent with molasses tones. Tastes fantastic with coffee and molasses. I also taste cloves really mild chocolate. This is a 2007 on tap and the tastes are really mellow. It is really great on tap and smooth. Really easy to drink."
"This beer pours a think black color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, graham crackers, dark chocolate, and alcohol. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied which is a bit to thin for a RIS for my liking. Overall, this is a nice Imperial Stout, but I don't find it to be all that complex. I could drink it again, but there are other big stouts out there that I like more."
"Finishing Notes -- Recommend pouring this into a pint glass straight rather than against the side to take off some of the carbonation tones. I have yet to try this on tap, but it probably would be significantly better than the bottle in my opinion. The burnt taste is a little much, but the other complex flavors make up for it."
" Drinkability and mouthfeel are about what you would expect from such a dynamic beer. One bomber is more than enough for tonight. RIS isn't my favorite style, but i'm glad i picked up an extra bottle for the weekend."
"The booze really slows me down, as it should, but it a bad way. The flavors alone are solid, but not robust. Not as bold and in your face as some others on the market, but a damn fine example of the style."
"I've had many a cellard version of this, but I think this is one that drinks sublime enough fresh. Smoke'em if you got'em boys and Girls."
"D- An outstanding representation of the style. Due to my current taste preferences it's not a beer I will be drinking too often."
"It's an okay beer. I'd happily drink it again but there are better options available to me."
"Bottle Pours a thick dark brown with a creamy tan head. The head laces well and seems to last. Has a great aroma of coffee, chcolate, and a touch of black cherry soda. The aroma is exceptional. Has a good carbination and a good mouthfeel. The flavors are very good and complex. Blended very well with only a slight alcohol burn but it is a good one. Has a solid finish and a good aftertaste. This has a full body. It is a hearty stout which is great."
"Overall, much better than my first review. Dark and malty, a good stout. I would still prefer Yeti or Storm King or FBS or Raspy. Kind of similar to Raspy though."
"d: I can't believe that this is +10%. I taste some alcohol, but am very surprised how smooth and easy this is."
"Notes- Like most of you, I LOVE this RIS. It warms the soul and after drinking it it gives you the feeling that all is well in the world. Stone is consistant in making awesome beers and I'm glad that I can get it here in the Low Country."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly drinkable for such a huge ABV. Smoothness and sheer flavor seems to eclipse alcohol."
"Note: 2009 batch"
"D--One of the easiest drinking 11% beers I've ever had. The booze is noticeable, but it is not distracting in any way. I'm actually very glad you can taste it because this beer is so damn smooth it would be chuggable without that alcohol burn. And that would not be a good idea to do."
"Pours viscous, thick, and black with an off color, even brownish, head. Initial aroma from the bottle was a strong blast of damp cardboard. But that gives way to roasty and rich, with wood, charcoal and a little plum. Flavor is bitter, woody and a little smoke. Finish is surprisingly dry, with an ashy bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly clingy, but it finishes cleaner than I expected. Sugar on the lips but mouth puckering on the finish as it warms."
"D=I found it to be quite drinkable. Not something I struggled to get through the bomber."
"For such a big ABV it is a very drinkable beer."
"This is an RIS that I could possibly drink for an entire night, but that could change with some aging."
"very smooth beer! very nice. a beer fit for a czar!"
"March 2010 edit - recently enjoyed another bottle with more age on it ('08 vintage). less head; virtually none, really. a more noticeable smell of dark soy that translated into a more savory flavor (though the overall impression is still on the sweet/malty side). feel about the same, i.e. smooth but not exceptionally creamy. excellent drinkability remains."
"Pours a dark black, appears viscous, with a moderate brown head. Heavy lacing is left on the glass surface. Reviewers describe an awesome aroma but all I get is a shot of alcohol. Maybe a little roasted malt as well. Things pick up in the flavor department but not much. The main flavor component is a roasted/burnt bitterness. Missing subtle flavors that would warrant a higher grade. A substantial body with proper carbonation. Not as thick as other RIS but still good. A good RIS but nothing that sets it above others in the style."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rich creamy tan head,Aroma is chocolate malts.Taste is chocolate,molasses,nuts and alcohol.A very very good beer.Great taste and smooth as hell.This is a no brainer that I would recommend.Will I buy this again??I'm on my way to the store now!!"
"I wouldn't call this a session beer by any stretch, but all 22oz were plenty enjoyable. Best sipped slowly, but smooth enough. Solid."
"2008 on the bottle (thanks BanditBrewingCo). Pours a think black with a chocolate head into my snifter. Head quickly thins out leaving bubbles and a slim layer of tan carbonation. I was on the couch grabbing my computer to do this review and could smell this RIS all the way on the coffee table...wow! I get chocolate milk, alcohol, roasted nuts, on the nose. I taste dark chocolate mixed with heavy cream, almonds, and a bitter alcohol flavor on the finish. Mouthfeel is great, thick & rich, chewy, and perfect carbonation. This is a great RIS that I will no-doubt be grabbing in the very near future."
"07 version on tap at the Saucer. Poured into a snifter this beer was solid black withe a 2 finger mocha head. It smells of currants, coffee and strong roasted malts. The taste is more of the same. It is incredibly drinkable and has a nice creamy chocolate finish. This is a fantastic beer and easily one of my favorites."
"NOTE: I have adjusted my public score to reflect the 2008 bottle as it is still available in many places (I think)."
"D: Highly drinkable for an RIS. This has a lighter mouthfeel than many others, and I can definitely see how this is a spring--as opposed to winter--release."
"What a great beer. That's all I need to say."
"D: Goes down really smooth. Not as heavy as I expected, but I could probably only drink 1 or 2 before moving to lighter beers. This beer is pretty hard hitting. This is my first beer of the night and I'm already feeling it pretty good. Anything over 1 or 2 would be a waste anyways, because I'd already be tipsy at that point."
"Looks nice - this is black as black can be, light tan head which doesn't last, not much of a cap either after 5 min. Smells good, and the thing that jumps out to me is some kind of sweetness. It's pretty rich, with some chocolate, dates, raisins, some licorice, prunes, and I'm sure some other things I'm missing. A bit of alcohol. Taste is also good, medium-full, pretty rich, and rather sweet. Flavors like the nose. Ton of malt. Feels fine, but I'd prefer less carbonation. I'm going to score this lower on the drinkability scale, not because it isn't sessionable (which it's not, but what are you expecting from a RIS after all?), but because after I eventually consume the other couple of bottles of this that I have, I probably will not seek out again. Fun to try, but just not to my taste. A bit too sweet for how I like my RIS."
"D- Best to be split with the high ABV but I could see myself with one of these in the middle of winter. Not the most drinkable RIS i've had but perhaps some age can fix the dents. Gets better with some chocolate nearby."
"D: A sipper by definition but an enjoyable one. the complex flavor and aroma in combination with the well masked alcohol gives this one high marks for drinkability."
"For a beer of such high ABV, this is exceptionally drinkable. A slight alcohol tinge in the aftertaste, but a very pleasant smoothness is immediately apparent. Of the dozen or so ""Imperial Stouts"" i've had, this is probably the most pleasant. Among stouts in general i would consider it second only to founders breakfast stout. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this is an amazing RIS. I'm a fan of stouts and porters, but generally not a fan of RIS's because the alcohol takes over the flavors in a large number of them. But this is ridiculously balanced, so much so that I probably wouldn't have known this was a RIS. For now, it's the best RIS I've had, and recommend it to everyone without hesitation."
"Spring 2009 bomber. Pours dark black color with a chocolate milk colored head. Just beautiful. I love imperial stouts. Anyways, Stone's IRS smells very sweet, of chocolate, coffee, and malts malts malts. The taste is perfect. This might be the best tasting beer I've had. Even more so than KBS. Tastes so damn smooth, and of coffee, chocolate, toffee, candy, it's very sweet in a good RIS way! So damn delicious, a bomber is not hard to kill. Mouthfeel is near pefect as well, nothing bad to say about this beer. It's very smooth. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. Drinkability.. lets just say I'm going to pick up many bottles of this whenever I go out next. Fucking loved it."
"Overall, I wish I had cellared this another year during which time the astringency might have settled somewhat and allowed for greater complexity in taste and a more rewarding mouthfeel. The advice on the label to cellar a case and try it at six month intervals is pretty sage and I'd love to try doing that sometime."
"overall i was let down...i like all of stones year round offerings quite well with the exception of the smoked porter....maybe i had an off bottle but being as i took it out of the delivery box before it hit the shelves i doubt it..."
"A couple of thoughts. This is a very good beer, but I have to say, that at least in my opinion, it's not in the same league with Dark Lord, Abyss and KBS. In fact I would probably take the Goose Island Bourbon County over this beer. All that aside, this is still a very fine beer, and an absolute treat to find on tap. Cheers!"
"This is probably my favorite RIS and one of the best all around beers I have enjoyed. You can really spend a long time sipping a bottle of this stuff. Very complex and interesting flavor with great balance. I will be buying a case of this to cellar."
"D: Extremely drinkable."
"Stone remains one of my favorite breweries, and this is an absolutely tasty effort. I am going to introduce this to my stout drinking friends who think Guinness is gods gift to the Irish. Damn this is good. Now I just have to decide which I like more, this, or Founders Breakfast!"
"Can't wait to taste this with a few years on it."
"Drinkability- So drinkable especially considering the wallop of alcohol this actually does contain, Such an amazing beer that I will continue drinking many many more times, a master piece simply put and if your a fan of russian imperial stouts this is one you must try end of story!"
"Overall, one of the better RIS's I have had and a great example of the style. Definitely made me want to try more from this brewery."
"Beer pours a liquid black color that looks as dangerous and ominous as the Warlock on the bottle. No head whatsoever, but a chocolate brown film rims the glass a the top of the brew. Smell is a smoky chocolate mocha and it makes me want to drink it now. Taste is expresso and chocolate. Alcohol is very well masked; could easily put a few of these down. Finish is roasted malts with a touch of hops. Full bodied almost syrupy with low carbonation. Wow, the best RIS I've ever had."
"Couldnt handle more than two or three of these but wouldnt need to cause you are feeling great after the first and even more so after the second what a great beer to just take your time and enjoy."
"D - One of the most drinkable 10%+ beers I have had. Damn near hearty and you could easily drink too much of this because it disguises it's alcohol content so well."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, and would absolutely encourage anyone who can find it to try it."
"Pours nearly pitch black with a tan/brown head with little to no staying power. This beer is hugely aromatic. Chocolate, coffee, bready malt, nuttiness, and a bit of alcohol. Taste mainly follows the nose with strong coffee or espresso, roasted malt, and a hint of warming alcohol. The main surprise here was the high level of ester sweetness, which was more than expected, and was a tad overbearing. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation. This is a really nice offering, but is a bit strong for a session beer."
"D - It's too high alcohol to be very drinkable. You start to feel it halfway through the glass, but it's wonderful stuff."
"D - I can feel the alcohol slightly, but at 10.8% I should be feeling much more than this. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this beer in terms of drinkability. Truly one of the most drinkable stouts I've tasted, so I'm going to go ahead and give this a 5 here. Definitely a sipper, but something I could easily sip all night long. In this case it's a nightcap though. I have two more bottles I'm cellaring, can't wait to try those out. I have a feeling this beer only gets better."
"D) One is plenty! Two in a session might be a waste."
"Overall, this was an experience with the complexity of flavors. The was very strong, but nothing was overpowering. It was hard to put down and simply ""sip""."
"Notes: Overall I was superbly impressed with this beer, and I'd love to pick up a few of them fresh to see how they compare to this year-old example. I'm assuming that, considering my tastes run less toward the hoppy end of the spectrum, I won't appreciate them as much as I did this beer, but I'm sure it will be delicious nonetheless. Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is an exceptional stout and an exceptional beer, and is one of the finest brews that money can buy. It's a bit hoppier than other stouts on the market, but if you're a hophead looking for a good stout, this beer may just be the love of your life."
"D. for a 10% ABV beer it is pretty smooth drinkable. Although I'm glad I had a 12 oz bottle. Really enjoyed it, but not a beer I would prefer to drink more than one of per night. It would make a great beer to be stored away for a cold stormy night."
"My go to beer after a long week, even better with a macanudo gold label cigar."
"Great beer from the Gargoyle-guys and one of my favorite stouts."
"Overall: Stains the glass a bit and reminds me a bit of dark lord. This is a very good beer, and reasonably priced."
"Overall, a well-crafted RIS that can be more notable for balance and truth to the style as opposed to other 'balls to the wall' examples of RIS."
"I still don't see what it is with this beer. Stone Brewing still hasn't delivered a fine quality brew to me, save for their IPA."
"Verdict: Aging improves an already amazing beer."
"D: This is one of those beers that I'd never been able to ""get."" Every time I'd gotten this beer, I felt like it was a chore to force it down. I even did a drain pour one time. I didn't understand how I could find a beer so highly regarded so unappealing, so I kept coming back. This time around, I decided to let it warm up on the counter for a lot longer than I usually do (specifically, 45 minutes) to see if that opened up the flavors. It worked like a charm. I still don't think I'd make this my go-to RIS, but I appreciate it a lot more now."
"I find RISes drinkable as heck in general, and this one is no exception. Might be a sippin' beer for some, but I just wish I had another bottle."
"poured out of 22oz. bottle at cellar temperature into pint glass. pours completely opaque black with a very nice deep mocha colored head that has a little bit of retention then eventually fade away to nothing. some lacing. intially got aromas of solvent alcohol and roasty dark chocolate. also dark fruit, heavy malts, and a little bit of coffee. decievingly thin at first, very minimal carbonation, solvent like alcohol flavors, followed by roasty chocolate, then more alcohol heat in the finish. lingers with some bitter malty flavors. very thick and chewy body, wonderful mouthfeel feel with a nice little tingle in the aftertaste from a combination of the carbonation and alcohol. extremely drinkable for a 11% RIS. been drinking a lot of RIS lately and this one has got to be my favorite. i would definately recommend to anyone whos into the big beers."
"D: That is good squishy! Believe it or not, I have never tried this one before, but now I can add it to the list of very good stouts I tell my friends about, that way they can ignore my advice and have another guinness.."
"Drinkability- One is plenty for me"
"Love That Stone!!!"
"Drinkability: If you like RIS, this is drinkability exemplified. Made for slow sipping and savoring. One a night is plenty but what a wonderful beer to spend a night with."
"Pours a viscous black with a minimal tan head. Roasty aroma with cocoa and coffee. Nice toasty malt flavors, balancing hops, and a medium mouthfeel. Smooth and elegant through the middle, with some roasted malt complexity and some minty hop bitterness in the background. The long finish comes just short of cloying. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but a tasty beer and spot-on for the style."
"D: For the style, alcohol, and boldness this is a very drinkable imperial stout. I was a little let down in the taste department, but maybe another try will brighten that up."
"D: For a Russian Imperial, this is one fine example. This is quite the meal in itself. I can't drink more than one, however, I enjoyed this beer very much. The sweetness and thick chewiness of it makes for an excellent beer to have with dessert, especially something like a brownie or mud pie."
"An excellent example of the style, Stone impresses once again."
"Otherwise, kids, believe the hype. Stone Imperial Russian Stout is unbelievably excellent, and is now my new personal benchmark for the style. The 12-ounce bottle is a perfect serving size for it, too."
"Notes: absolutely delicious. a bit more tame than comparable imperials because of so much chocolate. i guess i kinda like a slightly more present alcohol tone. but damn, this is delicious. might still be a little cool. we'll see as it warms"
"D: A very nicely balanced RIS. Bold taste isn't dominated by any particular flavor, which is nice. Definitely worth a revisit."
"Overall, really surprised at the drinkability of this one. Imperials are usually real sippers for me, but I found myself drinking this one faster than I thought I would. I also think that because I found it in a 12 oz. bottle, I wasn't ready to be done with it due to sheer consumptive volume. Really great."
"Overall: The mouth feel is full body rich and complex beer with some creaminess. The finish is full and lasting. This beer is huge with a good amount of hops note. This beer is really good. I would like a few more bottles, but unlikely."
"Finally another one that is good and relatively easy to come by."
"Very, dark with a thin tan head. Faint aroma of chocalte and charred malts. The aroma intensifies as the beer warms. Smooth chocolate flavour followed by mellow coffee notes, slightly sweet in the middle but dries out in the finish. Hop flavour and aroma are minimal, and the hop bitterness is very mellow but does still manage to provide balance. Lower carbonation and huge malts contribute to a rediculously smooth body. The 10.8%ABV is well hidden. Not my favorite imp stout, but very good none the less."
"A very West Coast interpretation of a Russian imperial stout, with a bitter dryness that makes it go down quickly, but coming in at over 10% ABV, it's best to tame it and sip rather than quaff."
"On tap at Beechwood. 2007 Stone RIS, 3 glasses and still trying to find more. My girl enjoyed a sip of mine, ordered a few as well, she doesn't usually drink stouts. She actually made a comment a few days later saying how good that beer was. If you can get it, get it now, hopefully I can beat you to wherever it is."
"Good all around beer, but a little lacking in some areas and, at times, a bit overwhelming in the taste department. I think this one could stand some time. I'll revisit this review upon diving into my 07 version some time in the future."
"D: Such a great beer, I can easily drink bombers of this stuff (though 12 oz. bottles are now available). Great balance in this one. One of (if not the only) few imperial stouts I can actually purchase regularly and truly savor. The best imperial stout on the market that is not impossible to get."
"An impressive stout, very well balanced."
"If this were more widely available, it would easily run toe-to-toe with Ten Fidy, Expedition, and Rasputin as my go-to stouts."
"Got my hands on this in eastern NC thanks to my beer store being such a great customer. Pours out jet black, with an amazing thick golden brown head. Leaving behind nice thick lacing. The aroma has hints of coffee, a bit of alcohol just wonderful. The taste has hints of coffee, chocolate, a bit of alcohol, but very little considering how high this brew is. Mouth feel has a nice bit of thickness but not as thick as I thought this would have been. Overall a great beer from Stone, considering this is my intro into Stone I need to find some others."
"Pours black with a short brown head. Smell is chocolate with coffee and dark, toasty toffee. Taste is dark bitter chocolate up front followed by toasty toffee malts and molasis. There is coffee on the back end with a bit of alcohol. Slightly thick, not very but it's there. It improves as it warms. This beeris perfect for aging!"
"Good IRS, but there are some better ones out there."
"I think the saying on the back of the bottle perfectly sums up this beer for me. It is thick, rich, and sinful."
"Overall, an excellent beer."
"This stout pours a black color with a very small tan head and some lacing. I get hints of coffee,vanilla,raisins,alcohol and some chocolate. A lighter mouthfeel compared to other stouts allowing you to put it back quickly. The taste is a coffee and raisiny flavor especially after i let it warm up just a little bit. Overall a great stout and would buy again."
"Pours dark as coffee with light brown head. Smells of coffee, anise, vanilla, and alcohol. Mouthfeel- it is thick, but very smooth and silky almost. Taste dates, prunes, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. Not one flavor over powers the others. I have found a new favorite Imperial Russian Stout. It is outstanding."
"As I mentioned, this beer became very popular in Russia; in fact, the mad monk Grigory Rasputin is said to have particularly enjoyed it - I guess when he wasn't seducing the Czarina. (Maybe some brewer should name an Imperial Stout after him ... Naaahh!)"
"Drinkability: A very solid Imperial Stout, one that places more of an emphasis on the roasted notes than others I've had. The alcohol will sneak up on you with this one. A very good beer, but I'm not sure it's worthy of the hype. It's almost too strong of a roasted flavor, and I would have liked to see a little more balance."
"D: Very drinkable. Every sip seems to be an initial wave of taste, followed by a warm feel of the alcohol and then a pleasant after taste. A very very solid beer. No gimmicks on this beer, just good all the way around. If I had to describe this beer in one word, it would be ""solid""."
"Scott"
"D: A very good RIS. I like a few others better, but this is very good an always easy to find. The sweetness is a bit surprising from Stone, but it is easy to tell the prodigious maltload they dedicated to this brew."
"D: Wow... This beer is great... Everything a Stout should be...this is a big complex beer it has a lot of balance and smoothness in flavors. And only gets better as it warms. According to the bottle it ages well.... I buying more and holding it for a few months... Great Brew I will buy again and again.... Stone Brewing Nails another one !!"
"Drink this beer!"
"First time trying this beer, but there will be at least a second. Alcohol on this one is very evident...a sipper great with cigar."
"Received a couple bottles of this in trade. Poured this into a snifter. Pours an opaque black color with a nice dark tan head on it. Smells awesome, roasted malty goodness, bitter chocolate, and slight alcohol smell. Taste was great also. More chocolate than in the smell and more alcohol than in the smell also. Nice thick chewy mouthfeel. I drank 1 12 oz. bottle and did not need another one. The alcohol is fairly strong here. Overall an Amazing RIS"
"Overall. This is a sipper. Wonderful after a meal. Expensive, and strong. One is enough. I am savoring it :)"
"Early spring 08 release bomber consumed at Aj's Club Soda after tending bar. Pours a dark as night beautiful black with a coco brown head that dissipated in a minute or so. First sip was a bit cold it gets much, much better as it warms up a little, but the flavors are there roasted chocolate some coffee notes. and at 10.8abv it is very subtle. this i feel will get much better with some years on it so im gonna stash a few away. Not recommend as a started Stout but a must try for any stout advocate."
"Pours black, all but impenetrable except for brown around the edgues, with a frothy, creamy, tan head with excellent retention. Smells of expresso, roastiness, and burnt chocolate. Taste is absolutely phenomenal, unforgettable. First thing you notice is the fact that its so tightly concentrated that it almost burns initially (I'm sure that the 10% abv also has something to do with that!), and then opens into sweeter, chocolatey, burnt sugar notes before finishing with dark cocoa bar and roasty bitterness. We've all tasted these flavors in other stouts and porters, but few other beers can approach the sheer concentration of these elements that Stone somehow achieves. An exceptionally full-bodied, high intensity, concentrated blast of darkness that is nothing short of astonishing. A great beer."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable. I recommend a 12oz bottle to play it safe...and hide the others from yourself.... or...hide your car keys and plan on taking the next day off.... I'm not your dad... I don't think?"
"D - not as much alcohol taste coming out made this beer very drinkable anlong with the mouthfeel."
"Conclusion: one of the most impressive beers I ever drank."
"D - A very good RIS, I hope Stone does indeed start distributing down here, I would buy this a lot"
"Cheers!"
"D- for a strong stout like this it is very drinkable. Before I drank this particular stout I couldn't imagine myself drinking stout regularly, but this brew would be the exception. Another beer that is right on by Stone."
"P.S. Cellar this beer!!!!"
"While this may end up not being my highest-scoring RIS, it is arguably my favorite. A fantastic beer."
"Overall, this is a great beer for the style and it is quite drinkable. I will continue to monitor for its availability and get it when possible."
"Taste was less than stellar. The alcohol is not very well masked, with a slightly astringent flavor. A bit of a disappointment."
"A RIS that is tough to beat and very drinkable for such a big beer."
"Thank you stone for making me a believer."
"Overall- A good imperial stout lots of good flavor but too much of an alcohol presence."
"A good nightcap for a fall evening."
"12oz bottle, poured black with brownish/tan head almost to the top of the glass. Smell of roasted malts, some chocolate. Taste the booze up front then roasted malts and a slight after taste or the booze ( just how i like it) but still very smooth. I love that i can get 12oz bottles now, cant handle more than that at one time!"
"3.5 D: One is certainly enough because it simply isn't that good."
"Before this, I had only ever had the Arrogant Bastard from Stone, and that one wasn't what I consider to be ""world class."" This beer, however, may just qualify for that. I was amazed to get such an amazing taste and mouthfeel from a bottled stout. Many times, stouts are best suited to be poured only from the tap (like Guinness). The appearance is a beautiful black with red highlights around the rim of the glass. Beautiful brown head does not stick around, however. Taste and mouthfeel are freaking heavenly. Taste of prunes, pork fat (no joke), initially, and then chocolate all the way down. God damn it's a beauty. I can see why this is on so many want lists. I feel extremely lucky to have this readily available in CA. This is one I would stand for in the face of opposition."
"Pours a pitch black color body. Average brown head, good lacing and somewhat lasting. Strong bitter coffee aroma. Spices and alcohol. Musty. Very complex. Coffee, bitter chocolate taste. Slight black licorice taste. Malty roasted flavor, creamy mouthfeel. Almost oatmeal tasting. Very tasty. Dusty taste. Wow, this is a good beer, best I've had to date."
"Still thouroughly enjoyable."
"Of course this is a good stout but would like less alcohol."
"I brought home a growler of this amazing imperial stout and now wonder where it has gone. A modern confectionery treat. Smells extraordinary with deep roasted chocolaty hues. After one pint I was amazed on how much my chocolate cravings started to hit. A very robust lasting flavor which makes it a very smooth stout for the power it packs. The hype is right on, this brew doesn't disappoint."
"D - For the ABV, mighty dangerous..."
"Notes: What else can I say. It's simply incredible! So thick and rich with such delicious flavors abound. One of the best RIS out there, without a doubt. A perfect example of why this is my favorite style of beer. Highly recommended"
"First impression: With Stone, I was expecting a super-hopped imperial stout, and this is nothing of the sort. Dark roast malt that comes over as nice and sweet, without any real harsh burnt sensation (like charcoal that you get from some). The roastiness just lingers on the palate long after the beer is gone. Touches of coffee and chocolate, without either one particularly dominating. Something slinky lurks in the background, like a vanilla or sweet spice. Just enough hops for balance/cleansing, nothing more. Fantastic. Nice big body, very rich, if not super creamy, filling and cloying in a good way, yet slick and oily at the same time. Hides the alcohol super well, no burn, or even a hint of alcohol that high. Fantastic stout from a brewery that I'm not the biggest fan of, since I don't really care for super hoppy beers. This is sure to please all."
"D - This is a BIG beer in every sense... Nicely executed and very good in all categories, but I'm not entirely sure it lives up to it's lofty reputation..."
"1-21-09 Just cracked another 2007 and it is drinking very nice right now. The only thing different was maybe a vague sourness in the nose."
"WOW, finally, what a beer. I've been waiting to try this on for awhile now. Pours a deep dark brown, almost black with light brown colored head that dissapates rather quickly. Hits the nose with roasted malt and coffee tones with some chocolate sweetness in the backround. What a delicous beer. Tastes of perfectly blended roasted malt, coffee, light chocolate, with a slight alcohol backround. Very well balanced. Being such a big beer, it's surprisingly drinkable."
"I have been underwhelmed by some Stone beers in the past, but this one is really noteworthy. Good, good stuff. I would not put it in the class of the Abyss, but not far off either. Pick some up if you see it. Have an extra bottle that i am looking forward to trying in six months or so..."
"To date it is probably my favorite beer."
"Drinkability is not bad either, but it is a big and strong beer, go careful."
"Drinkability: A great sipper now, and I imagine an even better one int he future. Alcohol is very present right now, but hopefully this will fade."
"Notes - An amazing beer that I was skeptical of due to all of the hype. However, despite this I would say that it is hands down one of the best RIS's I have had the pleasure of sampling. Incredibly smooth and creamy with a spectrum of flavors on display that would make anyone who brews an RIS jealous. Absolutely excellent. Also, paired well with a small piece of dark chocolate that I had."
"Incredible, just as everyone says it is. Coffee and chocolate cede the foreground to a rich, but not bitter, malt flavor. Smells like the very ideal of an imperial stout -- incredibly rich, more alcohol in the nose than in the taste, I think. The perfect balance between astringency and richness. An indecently satisfying beer."
"I'd been meaning to give this one another shot, and I'm glad I did. The last time I had it was last April, and it really wasn't proper RIS weather. This is a wonderful beer for a cold winter evening. Another outstanding effort from Stone."
"Good drinkability but again with a IMP stout how many do you want to drink in one sitting. Well worth trying would drink it again"
"D - Due to the high abv, it is hard to drink anything after a bomber of this. I really enjoyed this and wish I could get this in Missouri. Oh well, it leaves something to desire when I travel. This is a great RIS and was glad I was able to try it."
"Dark licorice down the sides of the tongue. Sweet chocolate all over. Coffee. Sweet malts. Big, rich, complex. Hey, this is good. Not over the top on anything - beautiful balance. A hint of citrus bitterness on the finish. Beer done right!"
"D Good example of east coast RIS, as it does not exhibit the over-hoppiness of its west coast counterparts. Reminds me that fermenting at high temperatures brings out delectable esters in these beers. Will need to pick up a yeast sample in October."
"Pours out pitch black with nice big dark brown head that fades rather quickly. Smells of burnt malts and hint of coffee. Very flavorful beer with chocolate, dark roasted malts, coffee bitterness. Very smooth creamy beer with nice alcohol finish that lingers and warms you up. Overall a solid stout impressively drinkable for its strength, well done. Just what I needed when it's 5 below zero outside right now."
"This brew is from the year 2007, decided to give it a try today. Well, I must say that it aged very well, simply a fantastic brew. I have been milking this one for the past 90 minutes letting it warm to see how the flavors change. The pour resulted in a pitch black color brew with a limited but steady darker brown head that left nice lacing. The aroma is magnificent as the black roasted/burnt malt give off a intoxicating aroma of chocolate, dark fruit (raisin, dates) molasses and brown, slightly burnt sugar. Extremely inviting mixture along with a faint but present Alcohol smell. The flavor is very good, lots of burnt/roasted malts (not overly astringent) gives a thick but slick feel. Coffee, chocolate, dark berries come to mind. As it warms the flavors seem to come out even more, if that is possible mixed with a warming taste of alcohol with is fantastic. This brew aged extremely well, now I wish I let it age even longer but on such a cold night this is exactly what was needed! This is a sipper, an evening with this one is the perfect end to the day!"
"D: Superb! A great winter-warmer."
"D - Very nice. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. And that is fresh! I've had a couple aged bottles as well that were tasty to"
"All in all, this is still a beast of a beer, but a much more subtle, sneaky, trickster of a beast."
"Has a rich, smoky, roast-coffee aroma with a nutty hint and just a touch of molasses. Pours a deep, opaque sable, just a shade this side of black with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head that sticks around. Flavor does not disappoint - thick, smoky, tones of malt and unsweet chocolate, ribbon of hop bitterness, nutty and coffee hints, with a satisfyingly bitter finish. It fairly dances on the tongue and on its way down the pipes."
"Good stuff Stone. I'll be back for the Winter Storm for more."
"Pours a dark, dark black with a thin cappuccino head. Smells of hops, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. I didn't know this was a 10.8% until I took my first sip and had to check the bottle. It tastes very roasty, with cocoa and coffee notes. The bitter and sweet elements balance each other very well. I felt that the alcohol was inconsistent, meaning I tasted it on some sips and not others. Full bodied and thick. I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a time."
"What a great beer, if you havent tried it yet, you should."
"D- This is almost too much beer for me between the alcohol and the taste. This one took awhile. I enjoyed it and will get it again."
"A friend described this beer as very drinkable...kind of like a session RIS. I disagree. The combination of bitterness and strong alcohol flavor made the bomber tough to finish. I look forward to reviewing a bottle that has been cellared."
"This was a big letdown for me. It's raved about and Stone makes other beers I've really enjoyed. My bottle had been in storage for approximately eight months, so maybe it's at an off time or just an off bottle. I hope that's the case and the next one I try will impress me."
"d - great balance and creaminess, the alcohol and price take away from drinkability but the flavor is excellent."
"This IRS is world class! Recommended to both friend and foe."
"All dark beer lovers need to try this one. It is a great representation of the style, and has some unique qualities to it. Powerful brew indeed."
"D - This is a slow sipping brew, perfect for a nice, lengthy contemplation every now and then."
"This is an exceptional RIS with an immensely rich and complex flavor. Should be sipped to enjoy the nuances."
"Good brew."
"overall a drinkable brew, despite the strength."
"J"
"Amazing beer! I'm lucky to have three more bottles."
"This beer kicks you in the balls and then comes back screaming for more. It really does pour the color of motor oil too, which is just lovely. Heavy alcohol flavor here as well as a big coffee taste. Very bold smelling as well, big coffee aroma. So good it'll make you slap yo mama!"
"Limited Spring 2008 Release 12oz bottle. A thick, smooth Imperial Stout with phenomenal depth of flavor and a round, luscious mouthfeel. The liquid is opaque and black topped by a small but sticky dark brown head. The nose is rich with perfectly toasted malt. The flavor is vast and superior, in my opinion, to many fancily barrel-aged stouts, not that I don't love a good barrel-aged beer. Stone just manages to pack in massive toasted malt flavor without adding in outside complexity. The malt is mostly chocolate with some coffee on top of wonderfully burnt toast. It's not nearly as roasted as some Imperial Stouts but the roasted flavor is just right. There's still some hop bitterness without too much age on the bottle. There are a number of flavors that will take me a few more years of beer tasting to describe adequately. The feel is incredible, lush, smooth, thick but never cloying or sticky. It's a remarkably drinkable beer for the alcohol level and the depth of flavor. You just have to keep going back for more. I wish that I had a case of this stuff, and come Spring 2009, I will. Absolutely phenomenal beer."
"Not an extremely thick stout and reasonably drinkable. This beer was a treat and I'd like to get several more bottles to cellar for a while. Highly recommend this beer!"
"D - Very tasty, the taste sort of mellows as it sits and warms, as another reviewer mentioned. Good stuff."
"A very solid IRS and a very yummy beer indeed!"
"cheers"
"-Gordon Quid"
"Overall - Another top notch US impy stout and up with the best i've tried... highly recommended..."
"Had to re-rate this after having the AleSmith Speedway stout. Pours black with a thick brown head. Great lacing. Currants, dark chocolate, and coffee in the aroma. Taste is too fruity with currants and prunes. I like the chocolate/stiff coffee base, but the currants are too much. While this is a very good Russian Imperial, It can not hold a candle to the Speedway. This is fruitier and sweeter, with a strong alcoholic bite. I will not turn this down if put in front of me, but I'll wish it was an AleSmith."
"D - This is a truly great brew. One of the most balanced RIS's I've ever had."
"Drinkability: One of the more drinkable RISs I've had. Not too robust and the 10.8% alcohol is hidden nicely. I think it would go great with some food."
"D: Exceptionally smooth, very drinkable, tops among the RIS's I have tried thus far."
"D- Kind of boozy and sadly reminds me of a <$20 tawny port."
"This is a very good R.I.S. if your looking for one and the price is right too. This is a go to R.I.S. for me, factoring the price and taste!"
"Finally had this one. Got a case of the 12oz bottles in Ohio. Very thick and creamy beer with a great head that leaves nice lacing too the finish. From Stone I expect a more outgoing smell, and while the smell was great - sweet and chocolately - it wasn't as strong as I like. Taste was very smooth - alcohol hidden brilliantly. Nice carbonation, too. Feel is thick and full bodied. I could drink several more of these in one sitting, easily. Fantastic drink."
"D: This is a fantastic, well-constructed beer. Another job well done from Stone."
"The best widely available RIS I've had. In league with the big boys, no doubt."
"A thing of beauty."
"Drinkability: Use caution! Very good beer that has a decent alcohol kick. I would drink it more often if it wasnt to strong."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bomber (2008 spring release) inot a tulip glass. The beer pours thick and juicy. The beer is jet black and has a more impressive head than I was expecting. As the bottle states it is a ""very aromatic brew."" There are notes of dark roasted coffee, chocolate, alcohol, and dried fruit. Even my wife was impressed by the smell. The flavor is very good. The coffee, and chocolate notes are most prevalent and there is always an alcohol undertone. A full bodied beer that can be consumed easily. This one could get you in trouble with its almost 11% abv. Simply put if you like RIS you will love this beer."
"The is a very drinkable beer!"
"D: This is a great RIS and one of my favorites of ones that closely fit the style, but I could only drink a couple/few of these. That's just how this style is."
"Stouts are not generally high up on my list of styles, but this is good. Highly recommended, especially in a world of $20+ bottles of beer. Buy a bunch and cellar some."
"D: I COULD drink a few of these at a sitting. But I don't think I would. For my money, there's many better examples of the style. This isn't bad in any way, it just doesn't stand out from many others in an overpopulated style. Good, but no better."
"Creamy brown head, colour is almost pitch black. Smell is roasted, coffee, hops, liqorice. Flavour is exceptional! It's sweet powerful, heavily roasted, dark chocolate, liqorice and very warming but yet not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is very smooth. The best imperial stout I've had to date."
"Delightful and extraordinary, this is one of the best beers I've ever had, give me a few of these on a cold day, and I'm a very very happy man."
"Another great beer by Stone. I might pick up some of the 12oz late 2008 release to try it again."
"Pours black as night with a 3 finger coffee colored head that works down to about 1/4"" and leaves some grate lacing. The smell is rich with dark roasted malts spent coffee and bitter chocolate. The flavor is complex with roasted malts some bitter hopping and light hints of chocolate and some earthy spicing. The mouthfeel is perfect for the beer, and this is the most drinkable RIS I can every remember. Such an excellent beer and example of the style."
"The bottle poured thick and dark chocolate color with about an inch of orange hued tan head. I'm afraid I'm just too congested to fully appreciate aromas and flavors. I definitely get warm alcohol in the nose. Alcohol in the taste, but also chocolate, and an aspirin like bitterness, which I'm sure is off due to my cold. Doh! What a shame. I can get only a few Stone brews in Oklahoma, and this ain't one of them."
"The appearance was nice a 1/2 shade off black with minimal light penetrating. A coffee colored, 1 1/2 finger head evolved but reduced in a minute to leave a decent lacing. My first drink proved that the beer was too cold and i would suggest allowing it to warm slightly because it is only then that you can appreciate the caramelized sugars, dark chocolate, alcohol, but still could detect the malt and hops. I didn't think the mouth feel was as thick as the bottle described, but the texture and taste formulated a very drinkable beer."
"I'm really not a big stout fan, but I had to try this. Pours like motor oil. Deep black hue with a dark creamy head. Aroma strikes me as deep, fruity, candy, but isn't all that noticeable. Flavor is a wonderful toasted coffee with a hint of creamy dark fruity chocolate. Feels amazing in the mouth, thicky and creamy. The high abv (10.8%) is well hidden by the taste. I have yet to drink another stout that comes anywhere close to this one."
"Drinkability: very good for an RIS ..nice beer"
"Finally got to try this after several years of waiting. Picked up a single 12oz bottle from over in Wisconsin. I was not blown away by this beer's flavor. It didn't seem to be all that complex. I let it warm but it didn't seem to change much. The alcohol was well hidden. I'll probably try it again in the future, but wasn't as outstanding as I hoped."
"D- wow, this is one thats worthy of its following. extremely easy to finish, but at the ABV its really not a good idea to have more than one. i wish this was available in my area, but an hours drive for this makes it well worth it. cant wait to see what this one develops into! check this one out if you get the chance, highly recommended."
"This is defintely a very nice sipper. Despite the 90+ IBU:s (?) it feels very balanced. Not too bitter, but not too sweet either. This is how I want to have my imperial stout! Fantastic! Very tasty! I'm really happy now."
"Update 6/22/08: Had this on tap at the Ginger Man. Smells very nice, strongly of coffee. This is too green as the mouthfeel is heavy, cloying, and sweet. Strong alcohol presence. Needs to mellow and definitely should be aged at least 1 year."
"Think I am going to pick up another bottle and cellar it another year."
"Pours a dep dark black with a chocolate/coffe colored head. Aromas has hints of roasted malts, coffee, alcohol, and chocolate. Full bodied with a lot of roasted malt flavor. Also, chocolate, alcohol(not overpowering thought), and roasted coffe flavor. One of the best stouts I've ever tasted. Excellent!"
"Update, had a 2 year old sample of this and WOW did it age nice. Had that awesume layered head white, ruby and brown. Much more complex, less bitterness. Like a fine port and double stout combined."
"D: A wonderful experience and heavy duty delivery of malts and candies with an ABV that cannot be ignored with time. This is a top shelf for the mature beer drinking pallet."
"D - wow, I was psyched to have this after realizing it was on sale here and so highly ranked, and I can see why it has the ranking it does. This is a hell of RIS. The taste and mouthfeel are amazing, and the ABV is well-hidden IMO. I could certainly drink another of these, although that's probably not the best idea. Anyway, I love this. Highly recommended, and I will be adding it to my winter standards"
"Drinkability: Great beer, I will have to get some more. Goes down silky smooth, and, thankfully, the coffee is not overpowering. Great balance on the hops, and huge malt character. Excellent!"
"Update: 2009 version seems to have corrected the hop bomb issue. If I were to review that version, the total score would be more along the lines of 4.35."
"It's not as overpowering as your typical RIS, which improves drinkability."
"Overall it is a little sweeter than I would prefer but is an excellent example of the style, have had it before and will definetly drink one or five in the future."
"Strong cocoa and dark chocolate flavors dominate, but give way to a growing alcohol presence and firmer mouthfeel. A definitive finish consists of a kick of hops, roasted malt, coffee and alcohol. The flavors of sweet chocolate are nicely maintained by the hops and roasted flavors to strike a balance. Alcohol remains embedded within the beer rather than acting as a defining component making this an enjoyable sipper on a cold night."
"malt character more consistent this time around. cognac warm sweetness. toasty chocolate and coffee. nice body."
"I don't generally like stouts but this is a fantastic sipper. I can't wait to try the bottle version for comparison."
"D: very drinkable, although it is a bit of a sipper."
"Top notch."
"Drinkability: This is a phenominal stout beer that ever fan of the style needs to try. Drink this while hanging out, eating dinner, or during any other time when your kicking back. If you haven't had this yet, don't waste any more time. Go out and find some now."
"P.S. This is my first review."
"D: Too rich to enjoy more than two or three snifters worth. However, those two or three are massively delicious and satisfying."
"Future outlook: Very disappointed in this one. Doesn't look like this one is my cup of meat."
"Smooth, like thick motor oil. Rich and viscous. Not for the weak. Really roasted and dark. Delicious and challenging."
"As with all the Stones, outstanding. Poured as you would expect, dark with a thin orangish lacing that reported your sips all the way to the end along the inside of the pint glass. Tasted a bit bitter and coffee like, perhaps a bit lighter than the 2007 version, but then again I have not let the bottle age. Outstanding, and like me, better with age."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and velvet-like. Wow. Minor carbonation, just right."
"Another great Stone brew."
"This is truly imperial. Just the right amount of hops, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Not even close to over the top."
"D-1 bottle tops, but lovin every last sip."
"D: Perfect beer with some warming fuzzy music. Drinkability is a double edged sword. In a perfect world I would love to make this a regular habit but it is one I will save for special occasions. Worth picking up and holding on to for down the road. Stone always delivers."
"Might be my new favorite. I opened a 22 oz. bottle and poured it into my trusty pint glass. Black with a very thin head that dissapates almost immediately. The aroma is soft, and chocolate and roasted grains shine through. On the palate, espresso, bitter chocolate, and vanilla strike with force. The hops aren't very present until the very end, where it has a very mild, dry finish. This medium bodied beast could be a session stout, even though it has strength and body that rivals a Sherman tank. I love this beer, and it's unfortunate that it isn't sold here in the Minnesotan tundra."
"Mouthfeel is thick and silky, and it coats the tongue on each sip. The beer is super rich, and coupled with the high ABV, this one is definitely a sipper."
"I just think this is a great beer."
"Drinkability: A fantastic beer. Approximately equal to Bell's Expedition in terms of quality, and a fine brew to have on these cold winter evenings. A beer designed to be savored and enjoyed for as long as the bottle lasts."
"This is a wonderful beer. The dark dark brown beer has a great amount of foam and even a great lingering lacing after settling. The Beer has a wonderful cooking chocolate smell and taste. Overall this is a wonderful beer that I would highly suggest anyone that wishes for a great stout to grab this beer."
"Overall a very impressive beer. With such a high abv. the flavors masked it well, allowing for smooth consumption. Highly recommended!"
"D: Quite a brew and deserved of the great reputation it has gained. Stone not surprisingly has another winner and here's a beer all great advocates should seek out and try. Drank very smooth and easily for an RIS, a sign of quality. Still, I've got to give the RIS edge to Victory's Storm King (and even Brooklyn's BCS), though that just shows this brew is in excellent company."
"Very drinkable for an RIS. Very smooth and enjoyable."
"Pours a dark black color with some dark red hues with a one finger tan creamy head with good retention. Lots of bitter aromas, lemon rind, espresso, chocolate with some dark stone fruit. Up front coffee flavor with roated and smoked malt, lemon rind, alchol warmth and some cherry. Light carbonation, very full body with a chalky, mouth coating feel to it, very dry. The alcohol is present but not at all overwhelming."
"Pours a syrupy, thick, used motor oil BLACK with a caramel brown head a couple inches deep that lingers around. Good lacing. Robust aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, burnt caramel, awesome. Taste is equally as decadent as the smell. Huge roasted malt flavors, caramel, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, balanced out with some sweetness and a noticeable hop presence. Simply put, Outstanding & Phenomenal. Mouthfeel is huge and viscous, oily, slick, coats the mouth. Along with Darklord, this is the most amazing/favorite stout I have ever had in my entire life."
"After enjoying on its own, I finished the bottle up with a little dark chocolate. Great pairing!"
"One of my favorites. could drink this anytime. I wish it could have this come of my tap instead of water"
"Poured from bomber to pint glass black as night with a minimal tan head. Smelled of burnt malt and chocolate. Warm mild alcohol taste with malty sweetness, coffee and chocolate. Has a very mild booze taste but the ABV is for real in this one. I will buy this again but would probably not have more than one in a session."
"Excellent choice with this Stone, not too hoppy and not too sweet, very balanced in the end. Definitly recommended on a nice cool New England night."
"This is a smooth and thick stout, that goes down easier than a 10% brew should. An enjoyable stout. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly a solid and delicious offering."
"D - Too much chocolate for me but still fairly easy to drink. The alcohol is nearly undetectable and the body is full. If you like chocolate then this is for you."
"D: This beer is something out of this world. Just amazingly solid, tasty, easy drinking sipper, been drinking this for well over an hour and it only gets better. I would argue that this beer gives all those other rare RIS's a run for their money."
"D 4.5 - A great balanced beer - some hops come out, but a great sipper and alcohol is very well-hidden. This beer really holds up well over time. A great treat."
"**I have always been a fan of Stone Brewing co. and this one added a missing dimension to their line..Signature taste and very well put together..Going on my top 50 list..I recommend this beer."
"This beer has a weight to it, and density that is special. Milk and dark chocolate, coffee nib, excelent nose and dark rich head. Almost too much of a good thing. Finish is very long, roasted flavors, alc is also nice and helps clean things up. I guess these could oxadize and head south but a well kept bottle should drink well for 5-7 years."
"A very good imperial stout but I prefer Samuel Smith's offering."
"Overall a fantastic RIS and beer in general. It'll be my go to when I'm in the mood for a creamy stout."
"This beer is very ease to consume. It would make a great session beer as it is perfect to drink at a slow-to-moderate speed, especially given its higher ABV. It's smoothness coupled with the great taste balance between the malts and hops is very inviting. I would definitely have another."
"Overall, a monster of a beer, and one of the classics. A little more age won't hurt this beer a bit."
"Overall this is certainly in the top tier of RIS's. There is not a thing out of place here, definitely worth a try."
"D= Wow this was a crazy good beer. After trying and loving some of their hoppy stuff, this one solidifies Stone as easily one of my top 10 breweries in the US. Highly recommended!!!"
"D: It was smooth, despite its inherent bitter coffee flavors. It is too heavy and has too high an ABV to be a session beer but it is a wonderful taste treat."
"Spring 06 release. Pours black with a nice coffee and cream colored head. Very nice aroma of ripe fruit, some raisins and prunes, also some caramel and chocolate, some alcohol evident in the nose as well. Hints of some ageing to with a bit of leather, smoke and meatiness in the aroma, though they are subtle and contribute to a very complex and enjoyeable aroma. Taste follows with a good dose of chocolate sweetness, some roasty smokiness towards the finish, and a bit of a bourbony alcohol bite in the finish. Some of the leather is also noticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, somewhat syrupy up front, though not heavily so, and it is broken up by some bitter roastiness and alcohol warmth. Age has been good to this one and it could probably go a few years longer. The aroma is very delicious and quite complex, the taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma's promise but is very good nevertheless. After a fresh sample a year or two ago, I definitely prefer this one with some age on it."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head. Smells like a bar of milk chocolate. Taste is malty, with a roasted, chocolate, coffee component that is quite nice. There is a tiny hint of hop flavor, bitterness is low. Mouthfeel is creamy, rich, with nice, low carbonation levels. Very little alcohol apparent for such a high ABV brew. Drinkability is good, a 22oz bomber is a lot of beer to drink, I wish they had this available in 12oz bottles due to the strength. Another great one from Stone."
"Cheers."
"The drinkability exceptional good after the first one you will be feeling it which is a good thing. I had the Ruination IPA right after this one and i was feeling quite good watching my football game. I felt bad for those around me drinking coors light the water beer."
"WOW!!! This beer was a winner!!! Poured dark and rich. Smelled of roasted coffee and aged rum. Tasted caramely with a subtle alcohol bite followed by a fresh, clean, aromatic sting. Would love to drink many of these but after two 22oz bottles, I was feeling FINE!!! Stone figured out yet another great brew."
"Pours dark black, almost like motor oil. Dark brown thick head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and alcohol. Smooth on the palate, but extremely complex. Develops throughout a sip. The flavors become more intense as the beer warms. I've had this three times refrigerated, but seems to be more enjoyable at about 55 f. Again, one of all time favorites. Really, well done! Spring 2008 release."
"Glassware - My new Buses By the Beach Pint glass"
"Pours a solid black with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly, but laces the edge on the way down. Aroma is of chocolates and roasted malts with a touch of alcohol. Taste is more roasted malts, chocolate, some dark dried fruits and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very creamy, Full body, ample carbonation. This is another excellent brew from Stone."
"I loved every sip and will be enjoying this again as soon as possible. Tommarow?"
"Growler, 2004 Saturday Night Special Pour. Pours a very dark brown with a creamy light brown head. Aroma is very complex, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, maybe some molasses, and a touch of smokiness. Flavor is sharp and complex like the aroma. Alcohol is hidden by the bitter chocolate finish. Very good beer."
"I was not expecting the sheer depth of this beer. After I looked up the style, I discovered that this beer perfectly embodies the characteristics of the style. I will pick this up again and re-review it on an appropriately cold winter night."
"Stone Imperial Russian Stout pours jet black with a milk chocolate brown colored head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is very malty, dark chocolate, coffee and perhaps a bit of fruit are noticeable. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick. The flavor is also fantasically malty, chocolate and coffee, just a touch of dark fruit. A hint of alcohol is noticeable, but really you feel the warming more than you can taste it. Excellent beer."
"Second time I had this beer. Not as memorable the second time but I was totally blow away the first time! Blackest beer I have ever seen, the smallest speck of red highlight makes an appearance if you hold it up to the light. The head was 2 fingers deep, frothy, and a creamy light brown color. The malty nose featured chocolate and coffee. Weaker smell than I remember but nice. This time around it tasted slightly milky and of cereal. The alcohol aroma was very minimal. Barely any alcohol detected in the flavor. Delicious chocolate flavor. This is a rich beer. Wonderfully thick and creamy. This is wayyy too drinkable for the abv!"
"Pours a motor oil black with a thin tannish head and some lacing. Aroma is sweet cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, some grapefruit, prune and raisin. Flavor is moderately sweet, cocoa, roasted malt, light grapefruit and wood. Slight alcohol burn in the finish. Silky smooth texture, medium to full body."
"D- Not bad at all for something so strong and rich, but definitely a sipper."
"D- Nice drinking. Take your time to enjoy this as different caracteristics come out as teperature changes and the beer has time to open up."
"I think a few months improved this excellent beer, and am hopefully that a few more will make it all the better. Not a bad price, and it's drinking frightfully easy. Another excellent brew from Stone, well done."
"Overall: very pleasantly surprised, exceptional beer"
"In the mouth the bitterness lasts at the top fo the throat with the alcohol esters going up nose. Overall this is definitely one of my favorites in RIS category."
"D- I love this beer its exactly what i would want to be drinking while watching the snow fall outside on a winter evening just to bad its august."
"A fabulous RIS. The high ABV is the only drawback to drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Great brew overall, with a medium mouthfeel...exceptional!"
"Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers."
"I wouldn't consider this a sessionable beer by any means, but it went down more smoothly than any stout I have had thusfar - and I love stouts of all kinds. Will I buy this beer again you ask? I have already made plans to do so!"
"D- I love this beer its exactly what i would want to be drinking while watching the snow fall outside on a winter eve."
"Pretty good beer. I don't think it's as massive or grand as the text on the bottle make it out to be. But it is a very, very good RIS. I'll definitely have to find another to hold onto for awhile. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is moderate. decent flavor makes this beer enjoyable to consume, but it's rather boozy right now which really slows consumption. Definitely a sipper."
"D: Can't handle much more than one 750 of this at a time, shared at that. But it is a migical experience, that one tulip glass full of great RIS."
"This is a great beer and deserves the recognition it receives."
"2008 bottle: Pours a black ebony with chocolate milk head. Good sticky lacing. Nose- mild coffee and black licorce. Taste- sweet caramel, milk chocolate, spice and licorce. Hop bitterness on the finish. Medium to light on the body side given the style and gravity of the beer. Finishes with a drying hop and roast bitterness. Minimal alcohol noticeable. Way more well rounded that I thought going in- very well balanced and well crafted. I can only imagine how smooth this would be with a couple of years on it."
"Spring 2006 edition, I wanted to let this cellar longer but to be honest it never stood a chance I had to open this up and try it. Pours pitch black into my imperial pint glass reminds me of motor oil, very slick and thick. Large brown head that soon becomes nothing and leaves no lacing I expected this due to the very high abv. Aroma is fantastic blending sweet malts, dark roasted malts, licorice, and even smells like plums and raisins. The aroma also gives off an insanely strong alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best I've ever experienced, this is the fullness and thickness I've been looking for and a smooth finish to boot you can almost feel the alcohol evaporate before you ultimately swallow. Flavor is phenominal sweet fruity yet dark and bitter. Two opposites clash but yield a wonderful taste, if only that strong alcohol wouldn't kick so hard this is near perfect especially for this style. The licorice and dark fruits also repeat themselves in the taste. Surprisingly sweet and smooth this is nice on the palate, overall a truly wonderful creation."
"Not for the Coors Light drinking beer wuss for sure. This stuff is just rediculous. It costs almost 9 bucks for a 22 ouncer, and I don't even care. I suppose I'll care even less by the time I get to the bottom of it."
"One 22 oz bottle is quite intoxicating."
"Edit: Its now about an hour and a half later without any other beer, and this beer being my only one in 30+ hours. I would say I'm intoxicated, this is one sneaky brew."
"This review applies to the 2004 vintage of Stone RIS. Picked up Saturday from Stone. Decanted from the growler into a snifter. Pours extremely dark with a small head that fizzles away quickly. Aromas of chocolate, alcohol, and plums. Smells more like an old ale than a RIS. Taste is chocolate, coffee, and a touch of alcohol. The taste in general is smoother and less sharp than younger Stone RISs. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and because of the age it has, this RIS is more drinkable than most. Overall, four years of age seemed to have done this brew some good."
"One of the best dark beers I have ever had."
"Eric"
"D - Pretty high; very high for 10.8% abv!"
"D- A great RIS that has everything you would expect: deep rich aromas/flavors, great feel, and just the right amount of alcohol presence. I will definitely be revisiting this offering from Stone again. Cheers!"
"Full bodied, warming, viscous, lasting."
"make no mistake - this beer deserves its Top 15 spot."
"overall this is my favorite beer. I have some bottles I'm storing now to see how it ages wich I'm sure will be well. I've also had on tap at the blue tusk, which was even more drinkable."
"Taste at first has a kick of booze, warms up the tastebuds for what's to come, a malty chocolately coffee-ish beer with a good creaminess and the right about of carbonation. If this was distributed in Maine, I think it would overtake my current go-to RIS."
"Poured into a snifter and looked like a black cola with a mocha colored head. Smelled of raisins and dark fruit. Tasted like coffee with the alcohol very well hidden. Thick and sticky on the tongue. Overall a delicious beer, I'll have this one again!"
"This pours beautifully. Coming out of the bottle it is so thick you know exactly what you're getting into. Nose is toasty and chocolatey, and well complimented by toasty, creamy, chocolatey and coffee notes on the palate. This brews real strength is how thick and full it is. I couldn't ask for a better stout."
"on tap at powerhouse brewing in columbus, indiana. first review so this is new. beautiful beer. can not see through. inch of head that disappates quickly. taste. wow. I've had dld and dld vanilla oak aged. this is up there with them. it would have got a 5 all around, but drinkability is a 4. I can't drink too much of this because of abv. that's life though. great things have to be enjoyed in moderation. watch out for powerhouse.."
"This beer pours almost an opaque black with a tan head. I am tasting one made in spring of 2008. The smell is a mixture of malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste is absolutely divine, the best RIP I have tasted to date. The main flavor seems to be coffee with unlerlying hints of chocolate and malts. The mouthfeel is wonderful, perfectly carbonated and no over bitterness or dryness. Not something I could see myself drinking all night BUT certainly a beer I would seek out when I am looking to show people what a wonderful RIS tastes like."
"D- Yes please! Not thick, that ABV is well hidden and it just goes down so smooth. I love this on tap. I have had it out of a bottle many times and out of the tap just seems to be better. The place I got it from is going to maybe put it on nitro so that should be very interesting."
"If it's this good now, what would it be like with even just a touch of age on it? I wish I could try it, but alas, I'm leaving the country. Still, this is a great RIS."
"The pours syrupy jet black with a tan bubbly head. The head dissipates pretty quickly from the massive alcohol. The aroma smells of bittersweet chocolate with hints of dark stone fruits. The taste is practially perfect for the style. Tons of chocolate, hints of roast, and a bit of fruityness and molasses sweetness along with some caramel. The beer had a full body, with a syrupy like texture that is not overly cloying. Carbonation is subtle and appropriate. Overall, an amazing Imperial Stout. Possibly the best I have ever had."
"Especially after having some other Stones, I'm disappointed; I was really looking forward to this one. It's a decent enough RIS, but I was looking for more."
"Holy F'n Shit. Chocolate syrup bed, fig and berries, with twig and berries hanging drilling deep. Sweet charcoal took advantage of dates. Date rape never tasted so good. Bittersweet symphony of dark notes. The gargoyle has mud on his helmet, and he's horny for more. Black, Russian, mail order brides, who knew? The perfection exhausts me. Stone has got me stoned. Daddys going night, night."
"Hypnotic dark black in body with fleeting mocha head. Subtle aroma of chocolate, roast, dirt, coffee beans. This beer does not hide from you, it tells you with a calm, straightforward voice that it means business and it wants your soul. Heavy body oozing with chocolate, coffee, roast, alcohol burn, hop bitterness towards the finish, dark fruit tang and burning wood. If you are into stouts look no further, this is the messiah who's come to Earth to free us all. A biting stout. Prepare to enjoy a nice steak and sit by the fireplace for a few hours with this brew. Let the cold wind beat against the windows, you have a guardian gargoyle to protect you."
"A great example of the style, but it leaves me wanting more complexity."
"Overall, this has to be my favorite aged brew right now, and at 4 years not to hard to duplicate! I will be holding my Stone IRS for a min of a year and longer."
"Limited Spring 2008 Release. Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass, the beer was a deep black color with a thick brown head. It had a sweet chocolate and coffee aroma, which I thought was a little subtle. The coffee came through more in the taste. Chocolate was there also, and the subtlety of the aroma vanished into a richly rewarding beer. A very drinkable beer, despite the high ABV."
"The Beer was Aces."
"I can't believe I've taken so long to get to this beer. Simply amazing. Best RIS and one of the best brews, period, that I've ever had."
"D- Long ago I had a RIS when I knew little of beer besides fizzy yellow stuff. Having this again years later is amazing. Goes great with chocolate. Definitely a sipping beer to enjoy with others."
"Pours inky black with a 1 finger brown head; decent lacing. A dark chocolaty beer and the coffee really comes out as it warms. Pour it cooler and let it warm. Some dark fruits in the nose as it warms, not as much in the taste though - possibly covered by richer flavors. Lots of dark roasted malts. Some hops add a nice bitterness to the mix, but never come close to taking over. Woody touch with hits of vanilla. Not as creamy as it could be, but still nice on the mouthfeel. Lighter body than I thought, but still definitely not light by any standards - it is an RIS after all. Suprisingly easy to drink. Alcohol comes out just a tiny bit the warmer it gets, but is still suprisingly well covered at 10.8%. A great beer, and an exceptional standard-setting RIS."
"Had this brew a few times now, this review from a tasting with friends last week. Poured into a chimay goblet. Jet black with a light syrupy pour. WOnderful tan head. Smells of roasted malts, some chocolate and alcohol. Taste is the sma but well put together. You can taste different flavors all separately but they work together very well. Great smooth mouthfeel and extremely drinkable. Just like Kate in that facet. This is the RIS I usually think of when trying all others."
"Overall: One word: wow. Simply stated, this stuff is excellent. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and you wouldn't be able to tell that it's 10.8%. Deceptive. It's also well-balanced and a decent sipper. If you're looking for a decent imperial stout, you can't go wrong with this. I do wish there was more creaminess to it but otherwise, it's great."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is still noticeable, but mostly balanced. very good. excited to try this again in another year or two."
"Poured from the bottle into two pint glasses. A milk-chocolate head. Not a whole lot of lacing with this one. Smells like traces of coffee and brown sugar. Taste is very complex. I'm getting coffee, chocolate and caramel in the taste. Very creamy mouthfeel that is overly drinkable. A fantastic brew from Stone."
"Very easy to drink."
"This is a painfully good beer, both in the way you'll feel next morning if you're not careful and in that there will never enough of it around. One of the better RISs I've had the pleasure of trying. Highly recommended."
"Pours out jet black, thin head to lacey. Aroma is that of chocolate, definetly coffee, molasses, alcohol(dark rum) and brown sugar. Taste is still amazing after all these years mellowed out slightly, still has that warm alcohol feeling, bittersweet chocolate, black coffee/ espresso flavors. Very drinkable. Still an amazing beer I could have let this sit for another year and it would probably retain its greatness."
"A must try. This is a fine beverage that has great personality. I love the big flavors, thickness, large scents and wonderful warmth. I'm now angry that they don't sell this in my state. WTF Texas?"
"Drinkability here is good, this beer has quite a bit of characther and is on par with beers like Dark Lord for sure."
"Weaker in taste than some stout's, and also lighter. No creamy goodness, but some malty coffee-ish vibe. This isn't always my favorite style, but occasionally I find ones that I really enjoy. This wasn't one of them."
"22oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a pitch black color with a solid dark tan colored head. The aroma is dark and roasty with some alcohol soaked fruits. The taste has dark roasted malts, with a slightly metallic flavors, and a pretty boozy finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but is a little thinner than expected. Overall, I am a little disappointed in this offering. There is no question that it is a solid beer, but I think that it is extremely over hyped here on BA. It is just too boozy for me, I have had many other RIS's with a higher ABV that hide the alcohol much better. Worth a shot? Definitely. Will I buy it again? Probably not."
"Drinkability - Loved this from the minute it hit the lips. A great stout that all should enjoy. This bottle was young (08 spring i think). I'd love to try an aged bottle for comparison."
"Drinkability - Found it to be a little harsh at first, but calmed down nicely and balanced as it warmed. Would love to try this again with a year on it, as it will surely be a beaut."
"While this is less complex than many RIS's I've had, that does not detract anything from it. The flavors blend together so beautifully that it is easily one of my very favorites."
"D- I think I may have started feeling it half way through the bottle on this warm and humid evening, but was ready for another shortly after finishing the first... good thing I only had one bottle around or I may have had my wife calling me an alcoholic."
"Overall, I would say this is a below average Imperial Stout for drinking fresh or aging."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, very creamy when you swish it around in your mouth. This was a very enjoyable RIS well worth seeking out and stocking up some more."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. The stuff is very thick and can fill you up quickly just because of that. Look to have this beer in the cooler months as opposed to the warmer ones as the alcohol content does a nice job in warming you and the beer itself is fairly thick."
"The taste is nice and creamy. Chocolate, caramel, dark fruits. I love how light this is to some of the others in it's class. This is a very drinkable stout, no matter the season... very California! Glad I bought two!"
"22 oz. bottle of the 2007 spring release. I sought this one out and finally had a chance to imbibe. This is one dark brooding elixir of doom. Nice dark aromas frothy head. Taste of roasted, smoky molasses, sweet spice, cooked tar, charcoal, nuts, coal, brick, earth and prune. I have seen some comments on an overly alcohol profile but I didn't sense it, at least in comparison to some other Russian Imperial Stouts. Yes, the alcohol is there and will kick your ass, but this didn't have the brandy/whiskey notes that overpowered the overall experience. This was one superb stout....just what the doctor orders on a deep winter day when the snow is falling heavily and all you can do is drink, read by the woodstove and harken to spring and summer that awaits."
"the alcohol is very strong with this one. there are some really nice flavors in there though. it's very creamy. lots of sweet flavors in there, chocolate, vanilla, carmel. it leaves a bite with the aftertaste."
"Taste is smooth but a bit too rich with an unexpected bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is very solid and continues beyond this slight bitterness to provide a decent drinkability given the over the top ABV provided by the folks at Stone."
"D: This is a drinkable brew. I do not find this beer as complex and awe inspiring as other RIS's I have had. With that said, it does represent well what an RIS should be even if it doesn't have the complexity, and although nothing is too amazing about the taste and nose, you can't find anything wrong with what it offers. A fine example of the style."
"D: I had two pint of this animal that night. I love this beer. The one thing I will say is that the fresh keg tasted like a bottle with about a year on it. I could literally drink this till my liver turned to stone. Enjoy that pun."
"D- ever so smooth and balanced. This could replace an old favorite. I would defintely drink this some other time... even age out a few bottles. Highly highly recommended."
"Pours dark dark brown with a thin tan head. Big aroma of dark chocolate, dark fruits, coffee and alcohol. Tatse is great, starts off with notes of licorice, chocolate, and slides into a huge coffee finish. Long lasting bitter finish. Thick oily mouthfeel. Very impressive beer."
"2008 edition. 22oz bottle purchased for just under $9 from Clarendon Wines in Boston - that's the cost of the the convenient location, I guess... Pours black with a boozy, malty aroma. Little head and lacing. Flavour is full and thick as it coats the throat. Alcohol is noticeable, but particular flavours such as coffee or chocolate are not. Enough hops to try to balance things out, but not hop forward. Not particularly impressed - and I'm a big Stone fan and a pretty decent imperial stout fan. Would aging it have helped?"
"Drinkability? 10 point what percent? Bah! It goes down dangerously smooth."
"Bottoms up..."
"I like this beer, but it isn't my favorite from Stone. That said, it is another great beer from them."
"d: Dessert in a bottle. Certainly deserves to be in the top 10 for its style. A terrific RIS. Probably a million calories and I thoroughly appreciate every last one. Watch yourself, before you know it, this one will take you down (10.8% abv, really???)."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this and look forward to trying it aged."
"Truly one of the nicest beers I have ever had."
"D'ability - So far, so good. But seriously, it goes down easy for a 10.8% ABV brew. Not the most complex or in your face Imperial Stout, so maybe more drinkable than some."
"Pours pitch black with about a 1/4"" of brown head that quickly fades. Aroma is chocked full of dark fruits, figs, raisins, plums, some light caramel maltiness, a touch of alcohol, and some very faint hoppiness. Flavor is complex with a vinous quality. There is alot going on here, some relatively restrained roastiness and a bit of caramel are first. These flavors are quickly overtaken by dark fruits (figs, raisins, and plums), which give this brew what, in my opinion, is a distinctly vinous feel. Some bitterness enters towards the finish to balance this brew out. The dark fruits linger in the long finish with a touch of roastiness, a noticable but not terribly significant alcohol heat, and a bit of malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied, with low carbonation. This beer appeared to be properly attenuated but at times it seemed a touch syrupy, though not at all sweet. Drinkability is pretty good, I certainly enjoyed it. Its a good representation of this style, complex and interesting but not quite all that I had hoped for. I'd be interested to see how it tastes with a bit of age on it, I think it may change for the better. Overall its a well crafted brew that I'd recommend seeking out. *As a quick note I've had this on tap and enjoyed it immensely so my expectations were pretty high."
"If it was half that price it would probably be my session beer."
" The mouthfeel of this beer is truly incredible. Super-rich,thick, yet cut perfectly by the warm alcohol bite and Warrior hop finish. A mouthfull of a hot White Russian is all I can say. I was lucky enough to try it fresh, I reccommend trying one now, and aging a few. As far as appearance,taste, and mouthfeel, this was a perfect Imperial stout. Unleash this Rasputin proudly for the Czar to behold! I spoke with the Stone East Coast rep for a time, a truly fullfilling experience."
"drinkability - Real good RIS, might be the best I have tried. Would buy this agin. Appears you can age this one too. I'll have to look into that."
"Overall, a solid brew. Interesting. Certainly worth a try."
"This is one of my favorite Stone brews. While this one's not initially as good as the '05 or '06, it's still a great beer (as reflected in my scores). I think this one will get better with age."
"Pours black and thick. Decent head that lasted through the glass. Smells of coffee, and burnt toast. The flavor is slightly acrid, but heavy on the chocolate and coffee. I've had this beer many times before and never noticed anything off putting about the roasted malts, but it struck me as a bit harsh this go around. It also feels and tastes a bit on the underattentuated side. I'll have to try it again. Never the less, it's a good beer, and I'd suggest giving it a go."
"Drinkability. . .::sigh::. . .I don't even know. This is probably the second beer I've had in the last couple of months that almost resulted in a drain pour. I'm just left wondering why it's rated so high. . .is it because it's a Russian Imperial Stout? Is it because of the high ABV? Is because the brewery itself is known for producing quality beers (this is the first one that has let me down, FWIW)? I'm just confused, I don't recommend this at all, and between this and the Harviestoun Old Engine Oil (Aged in Malt Whiskey Casks) that I had last week, I've been having pretty bad luck with choosing my beers lately."
"overall the hype for stone's russian imperial is deserved, as this is a staple of the style done damn well for an affordable price."
"Poured a very rich black color with a rich dark brown head that sparkled as it slowly faded away. Aroma is strong on fruit, molasses, espresso and licorice. Taste is extremely strong and complex with dark fruits, licorice, and espresso. Moutfeel is very thick and chewy, making this one an extreme sipper. I found a lot more flavor in this one on tap than when I tried 2007 in the bottle. This one is a very thick stout."
"This is a great stout but I'm not ready to rave about it. It doesn't offer me anything that all the other RISs have, and falls just below the few that I have truly enjoyed. Still, it's recommended."
"p.s. The 2005 brew from tap at brewery is the best version of this in my opinion"
"Served in the 22 ounce bottle. Appearance is spectacular: dark, dark black with chocolate-color head that laces rather quickly. The aromas are perfect: smoky, sourish malts mixed with strong fruits (raspberries) and coffee laced hops. I mean the smells are all over the map, but they are so wonderfully complementary that there really is a great unitary aroma. Taste-wise is also excellent with an incredibly savory bitterness that is a combination of coffee, mocha, espresso and wheat flavors. The mouthfeel helps aid in perfecting this beverage by making it very smooth on the palate. Its not light but any standards, but by making it almost milky with a medium carbonation, the flavors are able to express themselves quite well. By far, one of the best drinks I have had. Highly recommend."
"Two masterpieces. If you never had this beer, now is the time. I cannot believe it took me so long."
"I wasn't sure what to expect when the beer store guy described it as less sweet then world wide stout, but I had it following a world wide stout and it still had a bitter sweet finish in between. The beer pours cola with a thin tan head. The taste is like coffee with lite cream. It's not sweet but not bitter, so it's like coffee. It has a thick mouthfeel like a lite syrup almost, like a cream almost. Drinkability is very high as it is, I would definitely recommend."
"All in all, a really great brew. I will buy more of these and set them aside for a while."
"D - Great RIS that has an excellent balance. I wish this was avaliable in Texas, but until that time I will just have to trade for more!!"
"This is really an excellent, well-balanced tasty stout. Nothing really stands out on its own but it really is very smooth and drinkable."
"D: This is a definitely a great RIS and it almost lives up to the hype. I probably wouldn't put it in my top 3 for the style but I would actively seek it out."
"D- Give it a year or so & it'll mellow out & be vastly improved. This is one brew that benefits greatly with a bit of age on the bottle."
"Obviously, I recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried!"
"Pours a very dark brown, with minimal tan head. A little thinner than some RIS's. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Tastes of coffee and chocolate, plus some cherry and malt flavors in there. Overall, not as intense as most RIS's I've tried; a nice balance of flavor, but just not that much of it. A little disappointing. Not as good as, say, Abyss, Yeti, or Brooklyn, or even Bourbon County. Closer to a straight stout. Being a bit lighter, you could finish the whole bomber and not feel like you were stuffed. A fine beer, but flavorwise it's a very middle of the road offering from a brewery that usually delivers high intensity."
"D: strong, but smooth, this was aged perfectly"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Butter presents itself on the nose and palate as the beer warms, and with it a more prominent booziness. And this one will have ample time to warm, as it's a very slow sipper. No room for seconds; more like dessert for two."
"I was hoping it was just a bad bottle but I bought another one and it had the same exact problems. I really really wanted to enjoy this beer because of its high rating, but I'm starting to think it's rated so highly simply because its a seasonal from a reputable brewery and because its so high in ABV. I won't be buying this again, sticking to Old Rasputin."
"The beer poured a dark, evil, black with a thin brown head into a 12 oz pilsner glass. The smell was of alcohol and roasted malt. The initial flavor was of roasted malt, with a slight black-currant sweetness that faded quickly into an alcoholic, burnt toast and slightly hoppy finish. Fairly low carbonation gave this beer a viscous mouthfeel, but there was still very nice lacing down the inside of the glass. Another fine beer from Stone."
"First of all this is the 2nd best stout i have tried. second to the rogue chocolate stout. This stuff is amazing i would recommend trying it just as much as any other stone beer. This stuff is very complex and spicy in a way with the high alcohol content but it wont overwhelm you as much as some of the lighter stone beers when i say lighter i mean that this has the highest alcohol that im aware of from stone but it doesnt seem as potent as a double bastard. anyways this stuff pours thick black and has a thick creamy head that tops off the amazing apearance and smells like coffee malt hops and some chocolate. And tastes like this also with some complexities i cant identify but id like to have a couple more bottles to really say for sure. This is heavy stuff for me i dont need more than one bomber at a time to enjoy it and trust me if you like stouts you will enjoy and probably love this one.I only wish i had the money at the time to buy another bottle or two."
"D- Love this Beer! Wonderfully complex and balanced."
"A solid and well done Russian Impy Stout."
"D: Good drinkability. I found this to be a tad on the overrated side, but it's very good."
"Pours impenetrably black with a huge tan ice cream head. A bit cold yet, but the nose is weaker than I had expected. What there is is roast and toast malt with some metallic copper alcohol smell. The roastiness comes out as it warms. A bit of coffee and slight hop fragrance. Taste is nice and smooth, roasty malts, coffee, vanilla, and alcohol come to mind, some dark dark malt flavors in here and a nice hop kiss on the finish. Not as hoppy as I would have expected for a stone brew, which is sort of refreshing as they tend to be a little bit obsessed, but still on the hoppy side (barely). A slight metallic astringency to it, and alcohol is a bit more pronounced than I would prefer. Vanilla flavor is apparent enough it has a bourbon aged hint in the middle. The alcohol heat is a bit strong fresh, but should mellow in just a year or two. Mouthfeel is good, but could be a touch more viscous, just a touch. Drinkability is good now, but will should vastly improve with just a little trip to the cellar. Overall a great imperial stout, maybe slightly overrated, but defenitely not one you want to pass up. It is certainly case in the cellar worthy..even if you are not! oh wait, different stone brew..."
"The nose is pretty awesome. Mellow with anise spice, milk chocolate fudge, a great blend of roast and coffee, this does also have a mellow port-like oxidation, which lends a little bit of a red-wine character. The palate opens moderately sweet, with caramel, toffee, tobacco, anise up front, along with some medium-dark chocolate. This just might be heading over the hill, as I'm starting to get a wee bit of papery oxidation/ aged thinness, but it's barely on the threshold of perception (IMO). What this means, though, is that this beer is near its peak. Medium-full in body, moderately carbonated, this is smooth and fluid on the palate. A lingering grainy/roasty bitterness lingers, tempering the sweetness. Excellent. 4.5/4.25/4.25"
"Drinkability: High drink-ability if you are into Imperial Stouts. This is definitely a sipping beer though, and probably not suited for active social gatherings. This may just be one of the best beers for a night in with the old woman and a marathon of CSI."
"Pours an opaque black color with a creamy tan head. Aromas noticed here are coffee and caramel with a little alcohol in there as well. Taste begins with a classic roasted coffee flavor and a small hop note up front, with a well-rounded balance of chocolate, caramel sweetness on the way back, and finishing with a pleasant alcohol warmth. This brew is pretty heavy....and drinks as such. Syrupy mouthfeel, and somewhat filling....that said, with a 10.8 ABV, one is plenty. Great beer after a nice meal."
"Poured from a bomber into a seidel. This is a big and heavy beer. The color is black like the universe at the beginning of time. The head is a sandy brown color with a diet Coke-like consistency. Audible head reduction: this is a noisy beer! The smell wasn't distinguishable from other fine stouts even though it claims anise and black currants. I don't know, maybe I have cerebral palsy, but I didn't notice those. At 10.8% ABV the alcohol was noticeable in aroma and taste. This beer would benefit from cellaring. Otherwise, it's a perfectly carbonated beer and one of the gnarliest stouts I've ever had."
"Regarding the metallic taste, it also seemed a little rough. I plan on picking up another one and aging it for a while to see how it comes out. I imagine it'll smooth out a bit and hopefully that metallic taste will go away."
"Still, and excellent beer, and I'll keep giving the style more chances."
"D = Very good drinkability. I find the taste and smell a little more bitter than I personally prefer but for the style it is excellent. A good example of the style."
"Drinkability>""Oh dang"" yes, that was actually written in my notes."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, but very good beer. One of the better imperial Russian stouts out there. High ABV makes how much you can drink, but that's all that's stopping you. Highly recommended."
"D- My wife and I shared a bottle after dinner, and it was awesome. I would definitely drink this again, though not often. It's a strong bugger. I recommend trying it."
"Yummm where to start. This hands down is the best RIS I have ever had. Smell taste body, its all fantastic. A bit of smoke on the nose. Pours black as night. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, slight smokeyness, vanilla, very mellow hoppiness, slightly porter-esq, mild hop bitterness in finish. Finish is nice and dry, not cloying like some other RIS. Alcohol is well hidden. Very well done!!"
"d - nothing that dark and strong can ever be considered a session beer, but for the style it is very drinkable."
"Highly recommended RID especially at the price. Drink one now and lay a few down to taste how the flavor evolves."
"MF&D - Thick and rich. Great taste and superior quality. Not a session beer, but very enjoyable."
"Has a nice full body very thick and creamy, gives you a nice warm belly. What an awesome beer will definitely be drinking more of these!!!"
"M/D - Increadibly creamy. Nice balance of alcohol, sweetness, and bitterness. Nicely done."
"I'm new to the BA, so my assessments of A,S,T,M,D aren't very descriptive yet. As someone who usually does not drink a lot of stouts, this one was great! I'm fortunate to have a friend to sells beer for a living and get great recommendations from him on a regular basis. I've tried about 20 stouts and next to Bells Expedition, this is by far my favorite. Glad I got a second bottle to age and can't wait until the day I decide to open it."
"D- Very drinkable but with the higher ABV can't drink a lot of these. Very nice."
"The drinkability is good, a big flavor full brew, but not quite up to it's hype. Prosit, MK"
"When I get my next paycheck, I'll grab another."
"Mouthfeel has a solid full body, chewy and sticky. This is very filling, and a bomber was almost too much for me. Note to others, don't try this one if you are tired. It'll knock you out."
"So this is what a fresh Stone Imperial Russian Stout tastes like. I have a one-year old bottle of this which I'll take notes on one of these days, so comparing the two will be interesting."
"A very good imperial stout that ages extremely well. Highly recommended."
"D: Considering how huge it is, it's very drinkable. I'd like to try aging some as suggested to see how things go, as this is quite a fresh bottle, and I found it to be very smooth already. I'll certainly be going back for more."
"D - i was sad to finish this bottle off. i have some more from the same release that i will try at later dates and see how it develops. something i am very much looking forward to."
"What more can I say, I don't drink stouts all that often, but when you are in the mood for one, you really can't go wrong with this one. Again, mine was well aged, so I advise you to lay a bottle down for a couple years and enjoy!"
"D-"
"This was a great choice."
"Thick mouthfeel, viscous, but low carbonation. This one was an easy drinker for the style, but the high abv made it a definite sipper. Very enjoyable, I will definitely pick this up again."
"D:Perfect consistency for the style. Awesome beer, once again stone is johnny on the spot."
"This poured pitch black with a little dark tan head. It smelled like chocolate covered raisins or prunes with some alcohol notes. It tasted like sweet dark fruit and mocha, slightly bitter with some alcohol warming. It was somewhat oily with no carbonation and a smooth, warm aftertaste. Overall this was delicious, and could be one of my favorites! It was complex and interesting, yet very easy to drink."
"Beautifully done. Extremely enjoyable."
"Finish leaves the coffee taste as the beer's final statement. And what a wonderful statement that beer makes. I am completely satisfied. I need to buy some more!"
"D - Smooth but only for special occations for myself."
"I don't have any notes from previous releases, but this years batch seems more mellow fresh than previous years. I've got a couple past years in my cellar that I'll open to compare sometime soon."
"This beer pours a dark brown/black color with a very tall and thick but creamy tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of deeply roasted malts and hints of coffee, caramel, and chocolate. The taste is excellent for a beer like this. It tastes of very rich roasted malts, some coffee, chocolate, and some caramel as well. The taste is followed by a short and faint but nice hoppy bitterness to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel was very good - very rich, velvety, and warming. The drinkability is very good especially for a beer of this magnitude."
"D: A good drinking RIS... a little overhyped in my book..."
"Black, black, black. This bad boy looks as though it absorbs light (which may explain why even the head was so dark!). Nice lacing. The smell is like a charcoal party with everyone invited. There was also the presence of dried grass. Taste was roasted, burnt, massive, and delicious. One of the more bitter imperial stouts I've had. A bit hoppier than expected, but not bad at all. Mouthfeel is spot on. Thick and syrupy with just enough carbonation. This is an absolutely huge beer. It could be a meal in itself, but you'll be sorry if you don't have anything in your stomach with this."
"Rich black pour with a tan to brown head atop. Creamy smelling with a hint of soy, and doughy dark fruity sweetness. Taste is similar with elements of that doughy, dark fruit taste that I have a difficult time describing, and is quite nice. Rich, very nice imperial Stout that I look forward to trying again."
"but I'd drink it again if it was in front of me ;)"
"***I have been drinking this stout since 2004. I have a few 2006 and 2007 bottles still in the beer cellar for a future date. I just bought the 2008 which was just released this past week. I don't care what people are saying about Dark Lord or The Abyss. The Stone RIS is the BEST RIS on the market. People are willing to say that something taste better if they think it is rare and hard to get just to brag about drink the best beer on the market but this beer is just as good, no, better than either of the other two. Find a 2006 or 2007 and have a glass and decide for yourself. If you have to, drink a fresh 2008 and see what I mean. Then you too will age a few bottle for years to come."
"I've had the pleasure of drinking the 2003 in '07, the 2006 in '08, and finally have got around to reviewing the spring 2007 in early '08. My first impression is this beer is really hot. It's amazing how much it time mellows out the rough edges, but on to the review. Poured a 22oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. Wow, this is a beautiful pour. Rich oily black, letting no light through, no head even with an aggressive pour. This beer leaves no lacing whatsoever. Aroma is of raisins, dark chocolate, and espresso beans. It's really complex as with most RIS's. Taste is huge up front with bakers chocolate. Slightly bitter. Then pours in the roasted (almost burnt) coffee beans and finishes with almost a Isles Scotch taste. This beer really is another amazing product that the Stone Brewery puts out. Mouthfeel is exactly what I want in a beer. Plain and simple. This is my favorite style of beer and a absolutely fantastic version of it."
"Recommended..."
"Flavor is first and foremost intense. Roasted grain, malts, bakers chocolate. Hops are in there, but hide in the background. Very rich, robust, and bitter. Feel is thick and smooth."
"Mouthfeel is outstanding, so full and smooth. But at nearly 11%, it loses a point for drinkability as a bottle of this is dangerous. I've only had a few RISs, but I would say Stone's has a pretty unique flavor. Yeah, I'll be getting this again!"
"Well at 10.8% I can't say this is a beer you could drink a lot of. But I would love to have more of it, lots and lots more."
"Imperial Stouts are certainly my newest favorite style, and this one does not disappoint. It's very tasty, and I'd agree pretty much with anything anyone here who rated it an A- or better had to say. I really enjoyed this one, even though I'm not a big fan of Stone offerings, although I do enjoy their Old Guardian Barleywine. Probably the best thing is that this baby sells for about $5.99 (as does the Old Guardian at American Thrifty in Brooklyn). At $5.99, it's a fantastic beer at a fantastic price. I may still buy Old Rasputin and Yeti, but, probably not as often after having this one. Try it!"
"Drink= Extremely drinkable. Shared this with my wife and we both sat in silence in aw of this beer."
"Drinkability: One of the best Imperial Russian Stouts from my favorite brewer. This beer makes me question how anyone can drink wine when there's a beer like this. I can't wait until this years version comes out."
"This is the type of beer that makes me wish I would have started cellaring alot sooner. Fantastic ... Beyond the hype and worthy of every good word mumbled about Stone and the IRS."
"Mouthfeel is balanced, bitterness low but balanced. Drinkability is OK, smooth, didn't have me waiting for another pour. Moved on to something else."
"Pours a standard pitch black with a less than stellar head, only a quarter inch of dark cappucino color. Aromas are quite boozy first, quite roasty, chocolate, slightly burned walnuts, and a bag of black patent. Just a touch of piney hops there, but the alcohol and malts really dominate. On the palate, a thickly bodied, low carbonated brew really kills the palate with a hugely complex malt profile. Layers of coffee and chocolate, roasted grain, touches of oak and smoke finishing with a lingering bitterness. I'm thrilled this is not an overly hopped RIS, as I've come to really hate that. Overall, an incredible brew, one to really put up against my favorites: BCS and Expedition."
"Overall- I am very impressed with this brew. Good representation of the style and another strong offering from Stone."
"Having said that, it's still quite good."
"d-- goes down easy for being so high in alcohol"
"I'm not meaning to sound like I hate this beer but I guess I'm just a little disappointed. I love Stone and I had high expectations for their version of one of my favorite styles of beer."
"This ale continues to improve for at least a decade."
"A real favorite."
"2007 vintage, aged approx 1 year. I have to say I had very high expectations, not only due to the high rating of this beer but I am a huge fan of most all of Stone's offerings. This did not live up to those expectations and was a very mediocre beer. Pour was good, nice mocha colored head, dark as can be, decent head retention with some lacing. Smell was very disappointing. Stong smell of alcohol, particularly vodka which I found weird. Some smell of toffee and raisin, but mainly alcohol. Taste was of some coffee, chocolate, dark fruits but again a very sharp alcohol bite, especially as it goes down. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is great. Overall this was a good beer, but not great and not their best offering IMO. I was overwhelmed by the alochol presence and did not enjoy that."
"This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. Please buy as many as you can and age them about a year. Highly recommended."
"Pours a thick black with some ruby hues in light, with a nice 2 fingers-width of creamy tan head, good retention and lacing. Smells lots of chocolate, along with dark fruits, licorice, roasted malt, coffee, and floral hops. Taste starts off with dark chocolate, followed by some anise, coffee, raisins, and black currant. Nice finish of milk chocolate, bitter hops, and a touch of alcohol. Full bodied and smooth with a good oily texture and a good job masking most of its alcohol. Dangerously easy to drink and very flavorful with a good balance."
"*This was a keg from 2007, drank in February '08."
"22 oz bottle, 2007 edition. Pours black, pitch black, with a 1 cm tan head that is quickly diminishing. Aroma is all bitter chocolates. Initial flavor is dominated by bitter chocolates, but some roasted malt and coffee show themselves. Ends balanced with a hint of alcohol. Lots of lacing, no noted carbonation, medium/heavy mouthfeel, some noted alcohol. Very drinkable, especially if you prefer stouts heavier on chocolate than coffee."
"D: Far, far too easy to drink for a beer that's over 10% ABV. I kept reaching for another sip, it was very difficult to let this warm properly as it was deliciously potable from the get-go. Highly, highly recommended."
"Overall: Basically this beer kicks ass. If you like RIS, than this is one of the best beers in the world. I must say though, if you really like Russian Imperial Stouts than you must try this beer. More importantly this beer is not ready to drink when it is released. Let it sit for at least one year before drinking. Up to 3 years (When it will peak) is ideal. Cheers!"
"I love Stone beers. I don't know how they manage to make such easy drinking hoppy beers. This RIS lives up to the hype in every way."
"A really great RIS. Smooth and pleasant. Alcohol is quite apparent, but not in a bad way. Would be interesting to age this."
"This beer was also a launching pad for my obsession with beer, so it holds a special place for me in the pantheon of beers."
"D: More, more, more please. Looks like I need to get another Stone gargoyle tattoo."
"D- Good drinkablitly for a RIS. Alcohol isn't overpowering so it is pleasant the whole session."
"D: I was feeling the alcohol from this beer from the first few sips so drinking a bomber alone is a little tough. I think this is an excellent RIS and surprisingly drinkable bit there's really nothing here that wows me (not a bad thing, but keeps me from rating this higher). Was much sweeter (from fruit flavors) than expected. After I'm done reviewing this beer I feel like I shortchanged it and that it probably deserves a higher rating, so I take that to be a good sign for this beer."
"More than 1 bomber in a sitting could probably cause me some damage or a headache, so I'll save the other bomber for next year."
"A year made a big difference."
"D: Very smooth. Age did wonders to this beer. I have a 2005 that I will have to drink."
"This beer's greatness doesn't show right away but builds, and midway through the bottle you realize it's just outstanding."
"I loved everything about this stout. It's definitely in my top 5 in the category.. Awesome beer."
"At 10.8% ABV, one bomber is enough in any one sitting. Next time, I'll have to try this one with dessert. Good stuff from Stone."
"D: Overall not a bad beer but feel like the body was lacking substance at times and felt light. Still a very good beer but think there are much better examples per style."
"Heavy dirty black motor oil appearance with some sticky tan lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and burnt toast. Big flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, light smoke, and bitter coffee. Delicious! Mouth feel is thick and coating. Drinkability is great. An outstanding sipper! Did not detect the high ABV whatsoever. Highly recommended!"
"d: I prefer smaller bottles so I doubt I'll buy more of these, but this is a world class RIS for sure."
"wow, 858 reviews as of this writing. Guess this is popular. I enjoyed this brew. Pitch black, syrupy, roasted coffee, hops and molassses notes stand out strong. Drinkability was good, not great IMO. I would have no problem recommending this depending on price."
"A great brew from a great brewery."
"This one pours BLACK like pitch with a thick tan head that sticks around for a while. The nose is roasted malt and coffee, fruitiness, nuttiness, and a bit of alcohol (hey, it's 10.8% ABV). The flavor is GREAT. It's a smorgasbord of roasted malt and coffee and chocolate and a touch of hop bitterness. Some people taste tobacco and if you look for it, it's not hard to find in there. Surprisingly, the alcohol is lost in the mix, despite being detectable on the nose. But even better than the variety of flavors in this beer is the balance. This is a truly exceptional Imperial Russian stout. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but likely thinned to just the right density by the high ABV. As filling as this beer is, drinkability is incredible, simply because of the superb flavor and mouthfeel. If you like stouts, you won't want to stop drinking this one. Highly recommended."
"Extremely rich, yet surprisingly drinkable. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full without being gaggingly thick. Sticky, even a little oily, but mostly just plain delicious. With the subtlety of the sweetness hitting somewhere more in the back of the mouth than up front, it's not overly syrupy. Very nice."
"Poured from 22oz bottle from 05 into a stone RIS snifter. Poured a used motor oil black with a wonderful thick tan head. Smell is of light coffee, roasted malt, slight anisle and chocolate aroma. Taste is a thick chewy monster stuffed with coffee, chocolate, black liquorice, and a slight herbal hop flavor finished with alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is full but creamy with this alcohol monster still very drinkable."
"D - Great beer. If you love stouts, and I do, try this, it's great."
"Pours pitch black. Tan head slowly falls leaving a lot of lacing. Very slightly roasted earthy malts. Molasses tones. Flavor is just beautiful. And amazing. Thick malt tones. Just so robust and consistent. Alcohol doesn't seem to show up at all. Feel is amazing on the liquid. Extremely drinkable. A RIS that sits at 10.8& alcohol? Easily could be a recipe for disaster, but this just comes out magnificently. Easily one of the best beers ever created, IMO. If you haven't had a chance to try it yet, I really hope you get one."
"Drinkability: Not the most drinkable beer (considering the style). An excellent special occasion beer to warm you on a cold winter day when you come in from shoveling or skiing or whatever.. Not a session beer nor is supposed to be."
"Bottle. Poured a blackish-brown color with a light brown head. Good lacing. Aroma was sweet with a hint a vanilla, coffee, and roasted malt that usually come with this style. Mouthfeel is really nice. Flavor is unreal. Malty, chocolate, a touch of coffee...this is what an imperial stout should taste like. This is a very good beer that maybe someday I can get locally. I wish at least."
"Cellared for six months and poured into a pint glass. Dark, pitch black body with a very tan head. Wonderful smell of roated malts and coffee. Very complex taste with strong coffee notes, spicy hops and hints of anise and other spices. Very potent brew which is a drawback concerning drinkability. I don't see how I could drink more than one of these in an evening. Despite this small flaw, Stone makes a wicked Russian Imperial Stout, most likely the best I have had of the style."
"Overall a pretty good RIS. I have had better but this is a great option that is much easier to obtain than others in the style."
"Drinkability: This is a special brew. You can feel its power course through your veins as you drink it. It is a well-balanced Russian Imperial Stout. It has smoky, sweet and bitter character in one brew."
"All in all, an excellent brew."
"Chocolate covered raisins. Final answer."
"D- This is one great RIS. Stone produces some awesome dark beers. I was really impressed by this one as well as the smoked porter. This one is very rich-but not too rich and it is my favorite RIS so far. I will definitely purchase this one again. This beer is definitely worth the hype."
"I definitely want another, but can I handle it?"
"I'll probably spend some extra time in pergatory for this, but I can't help but wonder if there'd be more Christians now if Jesus would have turned the water into this instead of wine."
"YUMMM!"
" The body is thick, smooth, and just a touch oily, simply perfect for the Russian imperial stout style. This is certainly a beer to be cautiously savored, as the high ABV and huge malt content can have you out for the count in no time. And, I foud it goes quite well with chocolate chip cookies. Take that, chocolate milk!"
"I got one for my dad, who drinks Coors light but claims to like good beer. I asked him what he thought, and he said he poured it down the sink. In case beer karma is real, please pray for his soul."
"D: Not bad, but definitely 10% ABV, in taste and feel."
"An asterisk for those how aren't dark beer fans: if you don't like dark beer, you might still like this one, and if you don't I just don't know what to tell you. For those of you who love beer, but dark is just something you do occasionally, this beer may be a bit intense, but I'm sure you will appreciate it. For those of us who love a dark beer, this is, I believe, the benchmark. A gold medal from Stone."
"Taste: This had a vicious mouthfeel. Syrupy, but not overwhelmingly so. To my surprise, I also got a good amount of hop flavor. This beer is so delicious and complex. I'm going to get a couple more bombers and age em to let some of the more vicious flavors mellow out. Hands down one of the best stouts I've ever had. Ranks up there with Victory Storm King."
"When poured from its bottle into my sniffer glass, this beer had a brown head capping a black beer with no clarity. When I tilted my glass to the side, there was very heavy, sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was of sweet, grainy malt with a subtle alcohol. There was a slight aroma of bittersweet dark chocolate. The flavor was very full-bodied. What struck me first was the large hop presence with its full, bitter boquet. It also had a burnt grains flavor and finished sweet. This is a very full beer with a lot of ingredients. You can tell the brewery did not skimp on this recipe."
"2005 version on tap at the Stone Bistro, (guess about 1 1/2 years old or a little more by now). Deep deep brown, basically black, not much of a head but a little tan thin and creamy foam up top. Chocolate malt, coffee, and alcohol dominate this beer, and it is very smooth. Rolls over your tongue without any carbonated bite but with a little alcohol heat."
"A truly great stout and one that is proving to only get better with age, I have another 2006 hidden away and may just sit on it for another year"
"This is one of the first highly rated beers I have had that truly lived up to it's hype!! It deserves it's ranking."
"Joe"
"Pours an opaque darkness with a wispy full finger dark tan head that resists fading. The smell is wonderfully rich and thick, dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans. There is also a touch of vanilla and oak age treatment. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel has a thick yet smooth texture. The syrupy coating sensation is light yet the roasty choco-java flavor lingers nicely. The 10.8% ABV is present in the nose but otherwise well hidden. Immensely quaffable, highly recommended."
"Kudos to Stone for creating a beer that will bring a tear of joy to ones eye. I must say after having a Stone Imperial Russian Stout makes drinking supermarket next to a sin. Buyer beware you will no longer be able to consume inferior beverage after this experience. From start to finish it was everything I wished this would be. For starters when poured the appearance was super cool rich and dark and creamy just like you would expect. The smell again is warm, rich and luxurious. The taste is complex, not to heavy or strong. Mouthfeel was smooth as silk, coating my whole mouth and continuing down the throat. Drinkability is a joy, easily a year round beer. No longer are stouts reserved for great meals and winter time for me. Thank You Stone"
"D: This is about as drinkable as this style gets."
"Easily the best stout of any variety i have ever had, even more than old rasputin which i thought was damn near flawless. Its not terribly drinkable given the heavy mouthfeel and dangerous abv, but stone out did themselves here. I must have more of this."
"Stone has made a fine Russian imperial stout here, no bones about it. But it's not my favorite out there, nor should it be considered the best on the market. It's nice and complex, as it should be, but it's sweeter than some and a bit less complex than others. Definitely worth a try, though, and it'll keep you warm in the wintertime. Try it with a hearty stew, or a dense chocolate/raspberry dessert."
"If this bottle is any indication, I'm positive Stone RIS can hold it's own for at least 5 years of downtime before drinking...possibly a lot longer."
"D - This beer is not very good at all. I neither hate nor love Stone beers, and I neither hate nor love extreme beers - but, objectively, this is just bad. A little short of drain pour. Truthfully, I don't think age will make a worthwhile difference in this one. I'll let it sit for a few years I think and then crack it open. I am really sad that I bought two when I saw it. Very few times that I say this, but ""at least it is strong."" Barring the one I bought synchronously (which I might just trade), I won't have this again."
"This is a RIS that would age really well and Im putting aside a few to test it."
"D: A very good and easy to drink beer. May be too flavorful for some. It would be great to drink all day, but I don't think I could drink more than a bottle at a time. Very filling, a very good beer."
"D - If I only could, this would be an all day beverage :)"
"Pours pitch black with a large tan colored head that creeps up on you. Be careful not to overflow the glass. The foam recedes at a steady pace leaving behind an impressive wash of sticky lacing. The alcohol in the aroma has faded a bit since spring. The first thing that hits the nose is the roasted malt character, a bit of bakers chocolate, a hint of coffee and a distant hop presence. The taste has mellowed a bit as the flavors have melded together a bit more. The alcohol isn't nearly as perceptible as it was 5 or 6 months ago. There is a robust bitterness that seems to be originating from numerous sources. Baker's chocolate, hops and coffee. There are dark fruit characteristics and a background sweetness that help to balance everything out. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth and somewhat oily with the perfect amount of bite. I really like this beer, but have been spoiled by a surplus of Speedways lately. This isn't quite on the same level, imo, but it's still one of my favorite stouts. I've got 10 more, and look forward to checking in on them a few times each year. It's really not even hitting its stride at this point. Every stout lover should pick up a case of this each year and enjoy the ride."
"Drinkability is very good. A very nice Russian Imperial Stout, that seems a bit different than others in the style... but that's a good thing."
"...Im not going to waste your time telling you about the smell, taste and body...just know I put 5s across the board. Out of all the amazing high profile stouts like Darklord and Bourbon County Stout, this trumps them all, for sake of drinkability and mouthfeel. Close your eyes, take a sip, think Caramel, coffe, chocolate, feel the alcohol warmth, and remember that moment, for you have reached the pinnacle of beer drinking, and it is all downhill from here. Of course, this is all subject to your personal taste, but for the love that is everything holy and unholy, FIND THIS BEER! Thanks again Stone, you never let me down."
"Outstanding beer. Well done Stone!"
"Highly recommended. Can't wait to try the 2001 I've got!"
"I reviewed a Stone RIS that I'd aged a year over the summer. I liked it better aged but this is stilll a damn good beer. I long for the days that Stone comes to NC."
"D - I'm glad I got 2 of these. This is an excellent stout and definitely worth the stop on the quest to try the worlds greatest imperial stouts."
"D: Doesn't at all feel like a 10.8% ABV; this could wind up being problematic, as I could really drink this stuff all night."
"Drinkability is quite good, but with so much in your face flavor, it'd be hard to drink more than a bomber of this. Buy a few and share with friends. I'd like to try this with about a year of aging on it. Very nice indeed."
"D: Surprisingly high for a RIS(at least for me). I'll have absolutely no problem finishing this bomber and will probably buy another one tomorrow."
"Overall: Stone just does not disappoint do they? Several of my favorite drinking brews come from this brewery, and I can add this on to the list as another of those beers. The aroma and taste is huge and the price tag is so low. Dollar for dollar in my opinion this RIS gives the most bang for your buck. I Think I will pop my last one tomorrow to enjoy with breakfast... I can think of no better way to end one day and start the next."
"D- a outstanding RIS, although idk if i would want to drink it all night because it would be so selfish to not spread it out"
"4) Stone: Imperial Russian Stout"
"Overall I could definantly drink this beer all night long. But I wouldnt advise it. The abv is higher then what she lets on."
"This is a good beer, no doubt about it, but I can't help but be disappointed after hearing it hyped to the skies. It's just not thick or complex enough to warrant the praise heaped upon it, in my humble opinion. While a good introduction to the style, there are plenty of breweries who do this one better. Highly recommended if you're breaking into Imperial Stouts. If you already love 'em, try Deschutes Abyss, Dogfish Worldwide, Dark Lord, Storm King, or Gonzo Porter -- all are a few notches above this one."
"Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and creamy- a thing of beauty. Overall an contemplative brew that should be purchased by the case to be enjoyed through the colder months and years to come. Yet to find a better RIS. Highly recommended."
"Looked great in the snifter with lots of carbonation clinging to the sides and a thick tan head, though this faded fast, as expected. Aroma was of sweet caramel, chocolate and molasses, with the characteristic roast and coffee smells as well. At first taste, earthy flavors in the front of the mouth gave way quickly to malty chocolate, followed by strong alcoholic warmth and a bit of herbal hop finish. I found that the malt intensity could be slightly overwhelming and out of balance (how else did they get a 10.8?) If I were Stone I would knock down the gravity just a bit to even things out. My drinkability rating was particularly low as I'm not inspired to knock this one back due to the combined alcoholic slap in the face and the overwhelming maltiness. Still, this is a very respectable and tasty beer in the style."
"Highly recommended"
"The beer is pretty easy to drink, despite its heft. Take caution: Plenty of alcohol just around the bend. Go easy and enjoy. This is one of those beers that I could buy in quantity just in case I ever get an urge for a premium Imperial that I just can't tame. Highly recommended."
" The aftertaste of this retains the roasty, bitter aspects quite well, but loses the depth that can be found up front. No matter, the 10.8% ABV is not really a factor here, unless ya like your beer to slowly sneak up out of nowhere and make it's presence known once it's too late to turn back. In that case, Stone has done their job wonderfully here and even though it's not hoppy like many of their well-known beers, it's just as good and worthy of it's own big bottle and limited release. Perfect for year-round quality beer-drinking sessions, or those who aren't afraid to get introspecitve with a stout. Highly recommended!"
"D  Im finding the 05 much more drinkable than the 07. Thats fine with me because Ive got a case of 07 in the cellar. With any hope the 07 will develop as well as the 05. Hands down this is still one of my favorite stouts and at $5 a bomber its a steal of a deal."
"This brew was going to be enjoyed while watching my beloved Boston Red Sox . I got neither . The Sox game was called off and this beer was not enjoyable . When poured , the color and the crusty bubbled head was nice and very impressive . The head reminded me of the inside of a Crunchie Bar that my folks would bring back to the States from Ireland . The aroma is coffee and boozy . Burnt and overwhelmingly bitter . I have enjoyed the Storm King and Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout . The latter is one of my favs . Stone makes some very tasty brews but this was a mess . It was not a drain pour but it will not be bought again ."
"Pours black as oil with a huge foamy chocolate milk head that laces for days. Smells of roasted malts, french roast coffee, molassas, fig and slight alcohol. Tastes of dark chocolate notes, dried dark fruits, coffee notes, caramel, molassas and list goes on and on. Nice warming effect and a touch of alcohol finish. Feels full in the mouth with a perfect touch of carbonation. Smooth as silk and the alcohol is extremely hidden considering the high ABV. Crazy drinkable for such a robust stout, I could polish off another bomber or two easy...then wake up the next morning with memories of a delicious brew. A must try."
"Got a bomber of this - impossible to find in Philly where I've been living, but back in Michigan it seems to be everywhere. This one pours a totally black, with light red-brown head that dissolves a little quickly (although that could have been the pour). Nose is lots of licorice, molasses, black current, spices, and a touch of light alcohol. Smells excellent. Somehow, the taste tops it. Coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, molasses, roasted malt, breadiness, and some light licorice. Body is full and creamy, with perfect carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, with a great flavor and body. The only slight problem is the quickly vanishing head and the somewhat mild nose. Otherwise, incredible. Cellaring would only make it better, too."
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Was a very nice completely opaque very dark brown/black. Had a gorgeous dark brown chocolately colored head. Lacings clung to the sides of the glass the whole time. Smelled like freshly baked oatmeal cookies. Not too sweet, but not to earthy either. Tasted smooth, with a very slight bitterness that reminded my of a very very dark chocolate. Had a hint of coffee hiding in there also. Felt great in the mouth. Very smooth, coated the mouth perfectly. A little bit of bitterness/burning in the throat, but not bad. Too strong to drink fast, but a great brew to sit and sip."
"Always a pleasant find when on the hunt for a big, dark and hearty brew."
"Overall, I think it's a good RIS. I didn't get as much of that black liqorice flavour that I dislike as I have with some others."
"They are sold out here at the Irvine Bevmo, but I've laid down six or seven to carry me over for a while. A great beer, and for my money the best of the Stone offerings."
"If you're looking for a food pairing the obvious answer is chocolate. Nothing too sweet. Few beers of this strength are as drinkable - maybe that isn't such a good thing, but at the moment I'm not about to complain. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm out of nice things to say about this beer, but I'm not yet out of beer."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle - 2007 vintage - into my NBB snifter. It was a solid black color even against the light. It had a small, dense dark brown head that settled into a thin collar. Just a little lacing. The aroma was mostly chocolate with coffee and alcohol in the background. Smell and taste are sweeter than most stouts or amer double stouts. The taste is very smooth and follows the aroma. Very drinkable. The mouthfeel was good but a little watery for a stout. Expected it to be creamy but it wasn't. Overall an excellent beer and glad I finally got to try it. Highly recommend. (4.5, RB-OAY, T, Y)"
"Overall, it's an excellent beer, and a good example of the RIS style. This bottle is definitely better than many of Stone RIS that I've had: for many years, I think it was a prime example of how extraordinarily overrated some of Stone's beers are due to the cult following the enjoy. That said, this one is worthy of solid scores and praise. It might even, one day, grow up to be as good as Yeti."
"Drinkablity- Although I think Stone makes some pretty good beers (AB is pretty good), all-in-all I think they're pretty overrated. This beer is the exception. I thought it was terrific and I can imagine with a little time it would only get better. Its tremendously smooth and balanced and a really phenomenal beer. Im glad I waited to enjoy this on the lake!"
"Drinkability: I think one to two years is the ideal age for these beers unless you're a big fan of oxidized flavors. It was certainly worth the experience."
"D - I can't find anything to complain about in this one. The flavor and aroma are excellent and the chocolate notes are particularly delicious. They have done a great job of rideing the line between a vary flavorfull beer and an excessive, opressive one."
""
"Overall, this is a very good brew. Very smooth, reminds me of my favorite oatmeal stout, but just a bit of a bite. This would be paired great with a hearty stew... or just on it's own. Another great one from Stone."
"Must try beer for a stout lover.Reminds me a lot of a barleywine."
"An very nice RIS, thoroughly enjoyed on a crisp summer evening, recommend."
"D: A delicious big stout, not something that you'd wan't to drink everyday, but a great occasional treat, best when aged for 2 years."
"Thanks goes to JohnGalt1 for the extra!"
"D: Certainly not the most drinkable of beers due to the whopping 10.8%. It's definitely a sipper and it's not the smoothest of RIS's. The plus is that there are a ton of complex flavors in this brew. I've got a couple aging in the cellar. It will be interesting to see how it smooths out over time. All in all, a top notch RIS, highly recommended."
"D- If it weren't so powerful, I would drink this beer everyday."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. Well balanced between sweet and bitterness."
"Amazing. This is easily the best stout I've had, and it's not even close. I've admittedly been hesitant to try too many stouts as the style has never been my favorite, but this beer just changed all that. I will now be seeking out all of the best stouts available to me to see how they stack up to this magnificent creation. Needless to say I highly recommend this beer."
"D: This stuff is amazing. I like to turn to RIS's sometimes after dealing with IIPAs or something of that nature for a while, gives me that extreme flavor in the other direction. That way, I can let my palate be malted and assaulted."
"D - just one, call me a wimp. I could take more, but it deserves a ""limited engagement"" status."
"The messy flavor of this beer makes it a bit difficult to finish. I worked on the 22 oz bottle in two sessions on the same day. I have never seen a beer that tastes like this turn into great one, even with age*."
"Wow... not my favorite beer but very good. Theyre not lying that it pours like used motor oil, forms a nice head that dissipates quickly. Considering it is 10.8%, this beer is remarkably smooth. Nice roasted taste, remarkably nothing overwhelming. It has roasted malt coffeee chocolate taste, but they are all fairly subtle. Coffee taste comes through very nicely however. Quality brew."
"Thick and heavy on the palate with little forgiveness. Mild carbonation attempts to lighten the texture but to no avail. I'm not complaining one bit. Just what to reach for on a cold night. Raises the spirits."
"pours pitch black, no light comes through. a dark tan two finger head that builds after the pour. fades to ring the beer after a short while leaving a small amount of lacing. smell is heavy with roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. taste is sweet, rich and complex with coffee, chocolate, prunes, and dark molasses melding together for a slightly bitter finish as it warms you going down. smooth and thick mouthfeel with a light carbonation. something to sip and enjoy slowly."
"Overall-thanks to PintofNoReturn for sending it down I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Pours black like motor oil with a small dark mocha head. This one is one of the darkest beers I have seen, you cannot see through it even when held to the light. The smell is great, it has some sweet notes and chocolate, some alcohol as expected, with faint burnt notes as well. The taste is very similar, starts sweet, heavy, and malty. It ends strong, powerful, with plenty of alcohol flavor. The aftertaste has the sweet notes with some burnt characteristics. It has a smooth mouthfeel that could overpower most with the finish. Good balance in flavor and carbonation. This isn't an easy drinker considering its ABV, but is an outstanding beer with great flavor and I could have one any time. I suggest that everyone should check out this beer, this is one not to be missed."
"Taste is wonderful; the bittersweet chocolate shines through, a hint of coffeee, hops, and many malts. Balanced well. Not spectacular ...but a damn fine brew."
"My first 5 and usually i never really freak out about a beer but DAMN!!! Bottle was a limited 2007 release that i aged for about 4 months (i just couldn't wait anymore) poured into a standard pint glass and ejoyed while watching old ECW tapes. Pored black as night and motor oil like, just from the pour you know you are in for a good one. Taste was nice and malty just all around great beer if you can find it buy as many as you can carry and store a few for a bit to get maxium flavor out of it."
"Cheers!"
"*I am currently aging serval bottles and can't wait to add to this review."
"I would image drinking this during the colder months would be much better- but I still enjoyed the hell out of my bottle. Will be buying as much of this stuff as possible to save for the years to come."
"Beer poured black as night into my Duvel glass with a limited head. Nose is of boozy roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is boozy, roasted malts, some coffee and chocolate, with a blast of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect! Creamy smooth roasted hops that glide so nicely across the palate. Overall drinkability is very good. This is the best RIS for the price. The boozy, malty, hoppy concoction is awesome!"
"A very good beer, but I'm spoiled by some of the locals (Bell's, Founders, etc). Not the mind blowing experience I was expecting, but still solid."
"Crap, now I've only got 2. I'd hate to wait 6 months or more to have another, but it will be well worth it."
"overall a wonderful brew. Definately one to sip and enjoy. Represents the style well."
"Well, I'm not very impressed with this offering from an otherwise impressive brewery. I would certainly take Rasputin or Founder's RIS over this in a heartbeat I bought 2 bottles of this so maybe I'll come back and edit my review if anything changes."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. When I poured it I noticed its massive thickness, kind of like molasses. The head had a copperish tint to it, unlike a foamy white you would get from a nicely poured Guiness. Smelled of espresso with a hint of it's alcohol content. Went down surprisenly smooth without the alcohol overpowering my tastebuds. No burning sensation here! I would have to put this as one of my favorite stouts."
"Thick mouthfeel. Heavy body. Very drinkable for such a rich stout. The alcohol is nicely hidden which makes this go down easy. Very much recommended"
"Poured into the Stone Russian Stout snifter, pours a complete pitch black with a dirty dark head that doesn't hang aroung other than a ring around the glass, little lace. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, cake, sweet roasted malt and barley, this smells very nice and tasty. Taste is inviting, strong coffee notes, velvet chocolate, and just a bit of bitternes towards the end, I am also picking up a taste of wood in the mix as well, this is simply awesome. I had high expectations of this brew seeing the fine high reviews and believe me this is simply an awesome creation, now let me go back to enjoy the remainder of the bottle."
"Drinkability - This definatly is not a day-time beer. A great, last beer of the day, watching a great old war film or listenning to the crickets getting it on."
"D- Fantastically complex yet remarkably easy-drinking for as big and heavy as it is. Almost a little too sweet at times, but the finish more than makes up for that. Definitely worth trying."
"I will admit I had a certain expectation going into this beer, but after the first sip, I realized why all other Imperial Stouts are playing from behind. A wonderfully complex palate, alternating from sweet dark fruits and chocolate to a stern, warming alcohol. There is a definite roasted flavor here, along with hints of sweet molasses. Each sip invites another. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Even at 11% this beer is incredibly drinkable, and for me is the gold standard of Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Had this on tap last night at Toronado where they were featuring Stone beers. Pours extremely dark, almost black. The foam is thick and a dark mocha. Nice mix of hop, malt and chocolate. The alcohol is present on the palette. Very enjoyable. Definitely a beer to sit and enjoy slowly. A bit over powering for food."
"The bottom line: This isn't a bad beer, but it is not as exceptional as Stone's other big beers. I wouldn't pass one up, but there are many others in the style that I enjoy more."
"While many applaud its extreme nature, I felt somewhat overwhelmed by its flavor profile, which came off as rather sharp and astringent at times. This is a good beer, but I am not sure that it deserves the attention it receives."
"Perhaps the best thing about Stone's imperial stout is its drinkablility. Though strong, it does not have a strong alcohol taste."
"Split a bomber of this with a good friend. Part of the Spring 2007 Limited Edition release. Pours a completely opaque black with a thin, off-white head. Poured it into a brandy snifter - maybe the wrong glass, but it seems to fit. Wow! What complex aromas and flavors! Smells like so many things: dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, raisins, cherries, caramel, molasses, all with a smoky tip to it. Tastes are wonderfully balanced: dark and sweet flavors of molasses, brown sugar, cherries, raisins, and chocolate. Nice bitterness from the coffee and a touch of hops. The flavors travel nicely through the sweet and bitterness, and ends with a wonderful smokiness. Nice, thick mouthfeel - perfect for the huge flavors at work here. Still, none of the elements are overpowering, which makes this a wonderful, highly drinkable beer. I'm looking forward to having this beer again."
"Delicious and easy to drink. Needs some time to tame itself however."
"All in all, another beautiful beer from Stone. They really know how to brew a good drink!"
"Simply put, the best beer I have ever had. Certainly I have not experienced as many different beers than many of the reviewers on this site, but again the best beer I have ever had. The visual appeal is amazing. The darkness of the stout is unlike any others that I have experienced. It had a wonderful rich smell and the taste lived up to it's appearance. The taste was incredibly smooth considering it's abv. I sipped this beer after dinner and could have drank two or three but I probably would not be able to walk or talk. Truly a great drinking experience."
"smells malty grains, some chocolate, tastes good and probably can't get much better. Drink 'em if you got 'em."
"Poured out of a 22oz bomber that had beeen aged for one year. Poured black with a brown head that faded quickly and left minimal lacing. The smell was of sweet stewed dry fruit, especially prunes and dark cherries; as well as dark malt, a touch off soy, and a hint of anise at the end. The aroma of alcohol has been tamed by the aging. The taste is very mellow at this point, and markedly similar to the aromas with the addition of a tasty black licorice finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but not remarkably so. After some aging, this one is pretty drinkable. Overall, a very good beer, and probably more drinkable and enjoyable for the aging, but probably not quite the elixer its made out to be. Quite good, but don't kill yourself trying to find it."
"drinkability is much better than i had expected. despite its complexity and powerful alcohol content, i could sip this one all night. one of the best beers i've ever tasted."
"Drinkablity - This is the ideal special release. It comes out at the right time of the year so that you can compare it with other Imperial Stouts. This one definitely ranks among the finest. In closing, I think this is perhaps the first beer I've ever had that I wasn't so much concerned about food pairings. I think this beer is so good that food pairings are almost a distraction to the complexity of this offering."
"Wow, you're getting what you expect with this stout. Pours a dark, dark, brown, nearly black. Good brownish-copper head that lingers. But it's in the taste and feel of this beer that you get your money's worth. A strong flavor of rye bread comes through with first sip and lasts to the last drop. A full, dense drink that I compare more to a hearty stew than a beer. Stone packs an incredible amount of taste into it, and with 10.8% abv, it packs a wallop. A great choice to accompany a meal on a winter's night."
"Another greatly offensive beer from Stone, Oh how I love them so."
"Drinkability - Fantastic for this style. Nothing in this is too overpowering, yet it is still full of flavor. It's amazing that you can't really taste the alcohol going down. A great beer!"
"Overall this is a very fine example of the style and like I said before, it's the best Imperial Stout I've had from this year's offerings."
"Been looking forward to this one for a while. Pours dark, jet black, with coffee-colored head. A less beer-savvy friend watched the pour and asked if I was drinking beer or motor oil. Smell was coffee, caramel, some fruity notes (grape? currant maybe?), and just a hint of toffee. The taste is bitter, a lot more hops than I was expecting (though since this IS a Stone brew I suppose I should have known), with a strong coffee/toffee flavor, undercurrents of caramel and that same grape/currant flavor that I noticed in the aroma. Mouthfeel is very thick, but it seems like the carbonation and bitter hops keep it from coating too much. Personally, the 10.8 ABV on this one hit me like a load of bricks. Reading the bottle, they reccomend buying in bulk and cellaring to enjoy the aging...I may just have to try that."
"Drinkability - Drinking any beer after this is a step down. Be mindful of the ABV, it's so good that I always seem to forget."
"Very thick and creamy but a smooth beer that goes down very easliy witch I find somewhat surprising for this style. I could drink on this for a while."
"Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. The color is pitch black with a very nice tan head that goes away fast leaving a little bit of lacing - not as thick as some stouts I've had. Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, some anise/black licorice, and some dark fruit - very nice. The taste is precisely what an Imperial stout should taste like, IMO - big dark roasted coffee up front segues into dark chocolate and a nice note of tart cherry & anise. The finish is dry and mellow. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick, but a could be a little richer. This is one mighty fine brew - very tasty and easy to drink. It'll be interesting to see how this stands up next to Dark Lord. Another winner from Stone. Highest Recommendation."
"I got a half case, but I doubt I'll be able to age any of these. I just don't have the strength to not drink this bomber of happiness."
"Despite the ABV this beer is Fcking awesome and very filling and brilliant for the style."
"Also, it kicked my ass after having not eaten most of the day. Oops."
"the taste is great. probably my fav stout right now. sooo smooth and balanced and creamy. there is some sweet malty ness. im not really sure how to describe it other than if you like stouts. pick up a bottle, grab a glass, pour, and enjoy, its just so enjoyable, and at 10.8% could get you in trouble if you have more than one bottle, very good"
"Not the first imperial stout I would grab, but undoubtably a really good one."
"Notes: Bravo on another great IRS year from Stone. Great fresh, and I'd wager great with some age as well."
"Good balance for such a huge, heavy beer -- at no point is it overly alcoholic, nor bitter, nor dry. A nearly flawless RIS."
"I'll revisit this review after some aging."
"Cheers!"
"I have only had the 2006 and 2007 versions of this beer after searching for a while for this offering. I love it and can't wait to drink my other bottle of '07 as well as future bottlings of this magic elixir. If you haven't had the pleasure of drinking a Stone IRS, do yourself a favor and procure one. Do whatever it takes, this truly is the epitome of craft beer in this man's eyes. Well done Greg"
"Absolutely lives up to the hype and my expectations. Superb."
"D: o.m.g. yes."
"Drinkability: A year on this does it wonders. I think I'm converted - not to Stone, but to their RIS."
"This is not to drinkable right now. For one, it tastes way to boozy. Two, it is boozy! 10.8% ABV, how many of these do you think you can drink in one sitting? Rather then try to find out, why don't you just stash some for a while, and then savor one or two on occasion. As they so altruistically suggest on their label, ""We recommend getting a case (of our expensive most expensive beer!) and opening a bottle every 3 to 6 months to enjoy it's journey."" I opted for four, and will probably have 1 a year or so. As I often feel about young RISs, this was nothing that will have me clamoring to break into my stash earlier then I should. With certain barelywines though, that's a whole other story!"
"Dark khaki colored head with tiny bubbles all around the glass. Pours completely black motor oil. This stout is so thick, that the bubbles struggle to move. Head dies down fairly quick but some stickiness remains here and there throughout. Smell is of roasted coffee/nuts with a molasses/brown sugar scent that tingles the nose a bit. Alcohol is a bit there as well, but not overpowering by any means. Taste, mmmMMM!!! Thick malty goodness dominates this amazing brew. Very mild hints of hops, but just enough to balance this one out just about perfectly. As this warms, it seems to become a bit sweeter with a more powerful roasted caramel presence. So smooth, so flavorful, so well balanced for a 10.8% abv. Such a great job done by Stone once again. I can't wait to age my case and see what time will do to this well crafted brew."
"Ok my second bottle, I had at room temperature, and this stout has got to be one of the most balanced brews that I have had. The taste of this brew at room temp was much better, so do not refridgerate this one, the aftertaste was well disminished and the alcohol taste was not noticeable at all. I will be definetely buying a few more of these before they disappear."
"Black and robust, lightly carbonated and syrup-thick. The nose is all roasted barley and molasses. 10.8% alcohol is alarmingly well-hidden here, especially for a bottle with little age to it. Dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate and burnt toast entangle (but never overwhelm) the palate, with a long finish of black licorice and mild hops. Perfectly smooth and drinkable, I find it difficult to fault this beer in any way. One of the very best Russian Imperial Stouts available today."
"For a mighty RIS, this one is extremely drinkable. The description on the bottle does it justice. An exquisite brew!"
"Poured this big beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. Very black beer with a tan head that did not stay around long. Smokey smell and taste with roasted malts and burnt peat overtones. A very complex brew in my opinion. Very high alcohole and I thought a bit of a burn on the after gulp. Interesting brew that if you like super heavy brews you should try. A bit tight for me and I do noth hink I will buy again."
"fantastic."
"-xgabe"
"Good drinker as long as you don't mind an early night! Great dessert beer & maybe one to session on your tolerance is built up; just kidding!"
"On this day they had the Imperial Russian Stout on tap from 2004, 2006, and 2007. I was fortunate enough to be able to taste the 2003 IRS the previous week, but they had just run out when I arrived today. They were also offering a 2005 IRS for growler fills only in the gift shop. The 2004 stout poured black with a creamy thick yellow-brown head and smelled of roasted brown sugar, alcohol, and dark chocolate. The taste was a little metallic up front, with notes of bitter dark chocolate, cocoa, black cherries, and woody hop. The beer finished roasty, with a powdery-cocoa, peppery tongue-numbing, and slightly syrupy medicinal finish. Despite finishing every last drop of the beer, the inside of the glass remained stained with a thick brown sugary glazing clinging all the way to the rim. A mellow-smooth relaxing buzz emanated from the 10+% ABV. I enjoyed a second 2004 IRS after brunch paired with the espresso drizzled cardamom coffee cake. Spectacular."
"Very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy evil beering."
"Drinking both the 06 and 07 at the same time was a wonderful experiment, as it allowed me to see exactly how it aged."
"Cheers"
"D- This is a great beer. I wish I would of liked stouts this much when they came out last year. This will be up there for one of my favorite stouts (along with Siberian Night, Storm King, Dark Lord, and Bourbon County Stout)."
"This is a very tasty beer indeed. An exceptional RIS with the boldness one can expect from Stone. Drinkability is only limited by it's strength, which personally I chose to fully embrace!"
"I was really excited to see this one at the store lately, as I havent had a fresh sample of this beer in a while. This is the 07 release. I love the 05 and 06 bottles, which I have quite a few of. This one pours a dark brown/not quite jet black coloration with a brown tan head. In the nose was faint alcohol, powdered cocoa and a definite burnt character. Taste started off with burnt coffee, but as it warmed up a bit more of chocolate showed up. Mouthfeel was heavy, but not too big on the alcohol despite the presence of it in the aroma. One bomber of this was more then enough for me. I have to say that im a bit disappointed by this release, as it is not as good IMO as the 05 or 06. Maybe a little ageing will complement this beer. Either way it is better then 90% of the stouts out there. Check it out regardless. Cheers"
"Stone's RIS is one of my new favorites in the category. Proceed with caution, though."
"D- Complex yet balanced IRS, easily drinkable given the ~11%abv yet I wouldn't drink more than a few in one sitting, another great release from my favorite brewery that I would highly recommend trying (this coming from someone who hates coffee); falls just short of my current favorite IRS (North Coast Old Rasputin)"
"Get one for now, two for later."
"This beer pours out a good head, soft and tan/brown. The color is dark brown with a black color in the middle. The head falls very fast and leaves a slight lacing. The smell is boozy and harsh with some off flavors, I have had these off flavors before I just can't put my finger on it. The taste is slightly roasty, alcohol presence is noticable. Their are off flavors again. Mouthfeel isn't very good, it leaves my mouth dry and want of more, not more of the beer, but something. Overall, this was a bad experience. If the 2007 is like this I will not buy this again."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Pours jet black with a nice 1.5 inch dark tan head with excelent lacing. Strong aromas of chocolate and esspresso, very malty. The taste is glorious, roasted malts and esspresso with hints of chocolate. Very smooth to the palate, suprisingly smooth for the alcohol level. Definately a highly drinkable beer. I am very impressed. Great work Stone Brewing Co."
"I bought a case so I will re-evaluate this many times and may change some of what I have here for first impressions."
"Served at cellar temperature in a snifter from a twenty-two ounce bottle. Poured a very intense , shiny jet black color. Some brown highlights when held up to the light. Two fingers of very thick, creamy, mocha brown head formed. Retention was very good lasting almost to the end with plenty of thick lace. Smelled strongly of roasted/toasted malt, sweet dark chocolate, with strong bitter aromas of coffee with just a small alcohol presence. Tasted of chocolate and fresh coffee up front, with a little caramel, more chocolate , and a short bitter hop bite in the middle. Finished with coffee and warming alcohol. Overall pretty smooth and the flavors compliment eachother well. Mouthfeel was full bodied, thick, almost chewy and a little heavy. Just how I like my RIS.Very drinkable , but at almost 11% abv. this one might bite back. Also a little young in my opinion. I'll definitely lay a few down."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty thick and creamy, but very smooth. At nearly 11%, drinkability is somewhat limited. One bomber is enough for me in a sitting. But, don't get me wrong, it's very easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic imperial stout. Easily one of the best I've tried. Classic Stone brew. In my opinion, it has every ounce of arrogant character one would expect from Stone. Highly recommended."
"I seldom find that the hype matches the beer, but this beer truly deserves all the accolades it receives. It is a real pleasure to drink such an expertly crafted brew. From reading reviews of fresh bottles, I would assume that letting this sit for 2 years has been key in allowing this to properly mature. Patience is indeed a virtue."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. I would want to session this, but that's a little dangerous. I could go throug a bottle of this regularly, if it was that available."
"D- complex, impressive, and enjoyable, special occassion kind of brew due to complexity of flavor, probably one of best RIS, but the alcohol is way to harsh."
"Bubbles notwithstanding, though, you'd have a hard time pounding these."
"D- dont think there is any way i could possibly drink more than one of these in a night, im not a big stout fan, but this one i look forward to every year, love it"
"Basically, something happened to this bottle. It had to have, because I can't believe I'm going to score this beer so low, and give it such a sad review. I'll have to procure another bottle and re-review in the near future."
"Thick and chewy. Very little carbonation. Some alcohol burn in the aftertaste. I like this one, but I am not sure if I can get through the whole bomber on my own. Heavy with a higher abv...this is one to share."
"2005 Bottle. Poured black with a short tight 1/2 "" brown head. Very nice. Heady rich smells of soy and sesame oil. Taste is sweet, sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is thick, oily and indulgent. Carbonation is sublime, but there. Age has really tamed the hops and the alcohol in this. It would be insanely drinkable were it not for the sheer malty sweetness of the beer. Very nice, but a bit much to finish a bomber."
"D- For such a big beer in a bomber, I found myself wanting more as I polished off the bottle. This is a remarkable beer that I was very skeptical of before I cracked it open- but damn... this is liquid gold."
"D - A great beer with the only thing keeping me of drinking many of these is the ABV which is expected in an RIS. A very tasty beer."
"Received in trade with cooperrip thanks again. Bottle states limited spring 2006 release Served a bit below room right into a nonic. Tan head rose and fell and lingers on the surface. The body is black oily and completely opaque. Smells is robust, salty, smoky, earthy, maybe some brown sugar, dirty coffee hints of caramel and that slight anise character typical in some RIS, but subtle and perfectly executed. Taste is big, chewy, meaty, yet immediately approachable. I get an excellent roasted flavor, colored by a nutty character that makes it sort of pop in my mouth. Bitterness is perfectly balanced definitely not as aggressive as some, but provides tasteful ballast. Mouthfeel is wonderful, well balanced, surly and big, yet so tasty and easy to drink. This great offering starts aromatic and tasty and ends in very welcome alcohol warmth. I am very pleased to have had this wanderful brew. Great companion on a cold night, a simply great brew from a great brewery. God I wish I could get a case and do as they suggest"
"Pours black and syrupy in snifter. Thin ring of mocha colored head along with a swirl and some bubbles on top. First smell was almost like prunes and roasted coffee. Might not sound too appealing, but it really is once the other smells come out as it warms. Weak molasses smell and a big chocolate smell came out later along with a mellow anise/licorice smell. Tastes upfront of sweet chocolate with roast coffee beans and roasted but not burnt malt flavors. Almost perfect carbonation in mouthfeel, very smooth but faintly bubbly on tongue and creamy if left to hang around. Drinkability is excellent as the alcohol is well-hidden. The entire experience of this beer just gets so much better with every sip. Can't wait for the next batch to hit! Definitely my favorite offering from Stone."
"Overall, I thought this was very good, and definitely up there with some of the best in the style. A big, strong, full stout that you must respect when drinking. Do not take this one lightly, just because it is a little bit more available then some of the others, is no reason to pass it by."
"Bottle is Spring 2006 release. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head which went away pretty quickly. It smells like coffee, chocolate and dark fruit. It tastes the same way to me but with a bit of spicyness in the flavor too. It starts off sweet and then finishes with a nice hop bitterness which lingers around a while. The alcohol is well hidden, but you can taste it here and there. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's smooth, creamy and slick. Drinkability is very good, it goes down easy and almost as soon as I was done with one sip, I was ready to pick up the glass for another. Overall I think this is a very good beer, perfect to warm me up on a cold winter's day like this."
"It poured the color of my Black Lab with a nice fat tan head. I have never seen anythink quite this dense a black. Big chunks of tan lacing as it slowly settled. Served at 55 degrees as suggested. Nose was chocolate, coffee, fruit, and spices. Wonderful. More hints of flavors than can really be identified. Great rich and smooth mouthfeel. Wonderful flavor of roasted malts. Hides alcohol well. Finish is smooth and good to the last drop. This one came with a very high reputation and lived up to it."
"2006 vintage poured into a snifter glass. Appears almost pitch black with barely half an inch of caramel colored foam. Smells of dark, roasted malts, and dark chocolate. Tastes of rich, fresh brewed coffee, milk chocolate and vanilla. A little thin in the mouth but with medium carbonation. Alcohol is more noticeable than I'd like even after at least seven or eight months in the cellar. I look forward to tasting this again after about another half a year."
"Drinkability: Nice beer to warm ya up...just enough alcohol taste and great flavors"
"All I can say about drinkability is that this bomber is a perfect end to a cold winter night after spending a couple hours outside."
"Drinkability is pretty good but this is not my favorite RIS. Maybe it was just an off night for me, maybe my expectations were too high. It is, though, another tasty, strong brew from Stone."
"Pours thick ink-black with only a short creamy head at first, but the head continues to grow long after the initial pour before finally settling into a heavy lace. Nose is dark chocolate and espresso along with a bit of rum-raisin alcohol. Quite sniffable. Taste is heavy on the black malt with notes of black currant, prune, and anise along with some dark molasses. This is followed by some dark coffee and semi-sweet dark chocolate flavors followed by a dry and spicy alcohol note. Simply delicious. This beer is exceptional in every way. Thanks to beerdiablo for the sample!"
"Poured into the chalice. Dark tan head with medium to large bubbles that faded to a slight cloud that floated around the glass. Body is as dark as can be, no light passes through it when held up to lamp. Smell has a lot of molasses, coffee, and slight hazelnut, toffee, alcohol, and licorice. Taste is very chocolatey, dry and bitter hop, coffee, alcohol, aslo pick up some dark cherry, and blackberry. Mouthfeel is somewhat complex, fairly light at first with nice carbonation, then a heavy slick viscous finish long after taste that is quite pleasent. This was my last '06 kinda wish I had one more to age about another 8 months or so. Really good but not outstanding."
"As with every other drop of beer from Stone, the mouth is delighted by the feel of this gorgeous, gorgeous beer. If this is a session brew, it's gonna be a very short session. That having been said, this is wonderfully sip-able, and goes great with a steak."
"Have Another?: Oh yes please. My favorite stout yet but to be fair, I don't have a lot of stouts under my belt."
"This is a stunner, and seriously changing my opinions of Russian imperial stouts! The beer pours black with a thick brown head. Dark but clean. The smell is strong with a nice array of sweet maltiness, earthy honey and chocolate and fruit notes, a bit of grain too. It drinks smooth, with chocolate, roasted malts and a bit of fruit. I can only describe the mouthfeel as silky. I could drink this all night!"
"Whoa buddy! This is quite a brew! Pours a very dark amberish brown with a dark tan head that was more prevalent than I expected. Smells wonderful, alcohol, dark berries, toffee, and sweet leather. Tastes just as complex. Definite currant and some other fruitiness as well as chocolate and toffee. The alcohol is more hidden than I thought. I've had a few double stouts but no imperial stouts, so I guess that is what I was expecting. But, this brew slapped me in the face and showed me what imperial stout means. Very complex and very, very good."
"Pours black as night into a stemmed tulip creating a dark brown dense head that disappears all too soon leaving some lacing, but for the most part it was pretty lifeless. Somewhat disappointing as I had been waiting a year before opening this one. Aromas of chocolate and roasting coffee mask the alcohol well. Taste was excellent. The hops were muted and the malts shone through. Big and thick mouthfeel coats the mouth and throat while alcohol persists. Some dark fruits and sweetness but not what I expected. This was a lot easier to drink than I thought it would be. I expected a bomb of a stout (see DFH WWS) but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong- it was still a great Stout. I look forward to cracking open the 2006 tonight to see what it's like fresh."
"The company (depending on the store) only is allocated a certain number of cases after that you will have to get @ the Brewery..."
"super sweet, dextrinous aroma. some deeply roasted malts play around too, but it's mostly sweet that i smell. i would have expected the flavors and mouthfeel to be more melded and muted, but the heat is still there. it transitions right into the bitterness, too, which is a little odd. i get some oaky vanilla, but nothing like the yeti that actually spent time in oak"
"Delicious for dessert, but not one I would consume in great quantities."
"This is a 2006 bomber I saved until New Year's Eve. A fitting event for such a bottle. I offered some to everyone there, but they were intent on mixed drinks and MGD. Although I thought the ABV of this beer was masked by its strong flavors, it should be noted that I had put away a growler of Grumpy Troll Russian Imperial Stout and a 6-pack of New Glarus Spotted Cow earlier that day. My tongue may have been impaired."
"Cheers and a Happy New Year to All!"
"This beer had a decent head that faded a bit too quickly for my taste. The smell was strong of chocolate malts, the alcohol was not too overbearing. Apple phenol, my favorite smell, was present. Taste was incredibly balanced and malty. I can't believe this is 10.8% alcohol. The malting of this beer is superb and thick. I was afraid the alcohol would be overbearing. Not too bitter either, I've heard the ibus on this beer weere very high, but the balance doesn't make it very noticeable. This beer was pretty easy to drink. A very nice RIS."
"I don't think i would drink more than one of these in a sitting, but definately a good choice for a scarey movie on a snowey night."
"If it wasn't for the disappointing initial appearance I would have rated this a bit higher. Overall I very much enjoyed this brew."
"D: Fair. It's not bad. Very much a sipper. Seems to be more akin to a imperial java stout, or something along those lines. Well made, just not my bag."
"Overall- Not a bad sipper, but you better like it over the top sugary sweet!!!"
"Wow! This is one great beer. It is much smoother than many other impy stouts thatI have had in the past. Alcohol is not as obvious as I would expect for a beer of this strength. I am eager to try my other cellared bottle in a year or so. Definitely a nice Christmas Eve treat."
"Poured out a dark dark dark brown, with a tan creamy head, lasting a long time. Nose was malt, sour cherry, stone fruit, alcohol, sherry. The taste was incredibly big, complex, and balanced. Lots of dark fruit, sheryr, muted alcohol, cherry, and cassis. There was a nice silky mouthfeel, amazingly drinkable. Really lovely beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style, other than the headrush from the ABV, great flavor, pleasant warming, coats the mouth and the glass."
"This has to be one of the hoppier stouts ive had in a while, latly ive been drinking goose island Bourbon county and founders breakfast, and man on man was this a nice change of pace. I love the copper head and the darkness of a great stout, smell was awesome, reminded me of dark lord, rolling over the the maltyness and hops really came out. overall i would have to say that i have to get over to FFF and check this out on tap."
"Mouthfeel- Not as viscous as Dark Lord. But still viscous. Just what I'm looking for in a good RIS."
"Not my favorite style, but a well-crafted flavor with carefully brewed complexities. Definitely worth a try, even if you don't like this style."
"Hands down, one of finest Stouts on the face of the earth."
"Drinkability- I sipped on this for about an hour- but when it approached room temperature I found myself wanting more and more, and it was surprisingly drinkable. I bet this would be even better with another year or so of aging. A great beer that I look forward to trying again."
"Overall it is an average/below average RIS. I have had it before, and it was better this may be a bad bottle."
"Pours to a thick black, used motor oil look, with light tan head that lingers long and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is malty roasted nut and molasses. Flavor is more of the same, and as the beer warms, the 9.4% alcohol becomes more noticeable. Sweet, long finish tops this off and makes it a most enjoyable beer."
"I thought it was a great beer but I expected more of a wow effect from the taste given its acclaim. It is an excellent interpretation of a russian imperial stout but I found myself prefering old rasputin. Will do more research on this subject..."
"22 oz. bomber, released in early summer '05 - served lightly chilled in a big chalice. It pours thick and black, with a small, lightly fizzy orange/brown head that reduces to a collar, then fades away. It is quite aromatic, with dark and sweet chocolate, coffee, charred/burnt, nutty, smoked?, roasted, and sweet malts, tobacco juice, currant, blackberry, apple?, oranges?, other berry/tropical esters, and a bit of a lactic quality. Insanely complex. Just as complex on the palate, with cocoa, tobacco, leather, coffee, Jagermeister?, blackened/charred/burnt malts, roasted and vinous malts, plum, currant, blackberry, and green/piney hops that leave a medium bitterness. The body is thick, fairly carbonated (thanks to bottle-conditioning), and incredibly smooth - swishing the beer in your mouth turns it into an almost milkshake consistency that you damn near have to chew. It leaves a long, roasted and hoppy finish and hides the alcohol surprisingly well (in flavor; you can feel it going down). Overall a dangerously drinkable beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"I'm not normally super impressed by Stone's beers, but this one was exceptional. It's deservedly at the top with the likes of 3F Dark Lord, Bell's Expedition Stout, and Alesmith Speedway Stout."
"Is there anything Stone can't do? This is incredible."
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel is velvet smooth, and drinkability are excellent for the style."
"Mouthfeel is without equal. Well, there maybe another stout out there that *can* equal this, but certainly not exceed it. This is just a glorious creation, coating your mouth with its decadent and nearly oily presence with each sip. Very, very heavy. Beautiful. Rasputin has a mouthfeel similar to this, but it also has a hop presence that I am not particular fond of. This drink, is a sensational marriage of nearly everything I like in a stout. Many, many thanks to Ding for bringing me this most splendid brew!!"
"Decadent and delightful, seek this out."
"02/03/08: Early Spring 2007 Release received as an extra from dirtylou, cellared about a year. Thick with smooth dark cocoa and deep, rich roasts with a great smoky character. A light note of sour that's pretty interesting, and probably draws the old ale comparisons I've seen in other reviews. Ethanol present, but at welcome and appropriate levels. Thick and delicious."
"Update: Drinking my second bottle of the 2006, I poured it into my NB goblet and there was lots of nice foam and lacing and it lasted for the entire session."
"Overall, my review cannot do this beer justice. Very complex and incredible. I look forward to my next one. I strongly encourage a slow drink, because the flavor profile changes quite a bit across the temperature spectrum."
"Thank you to WarriorSoul for this lovely brew ... a 2006 bottle i didn't have the patience to cellar. Pours an opaque black so intense it's as if it sucks up any and all light within a 5 ft radius. Gorgeous. Epic head of chocolate tan that persists long. complex lacing patterns in the goblet in which it sits. Nose is good, but not great ... something some time in the cellar would remedy, I'd wager. Dark, roasted grains, espresso, baker's chocolate, and a slight sweetness. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't knock me over. Palate is consistent with the nose, except the tastes are so intense they nearly overwhelm the senses. Incrediblly rich, thick chocolate, espresso, and dare I say ... tobacco-like flavors. Remarkably dry though all of this. There are hops in here ... never cloying. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. A man's beer throughout. All in all, incredible. I need to get my hands on several more bottles so I can cellar them ... this can only get better with time. Excellent."
"A very good RIS...is going well with roasted chestnuts.Probably a bit too big to have more than one...or two."
"As you pour this ink black bodied beer you think ahh...beauty in black. Hosts a thick milk chocolate colored head about 3 inches thick-perfect. Leaves a little lace. Nose is a burnt zesty malt with a tingle of chocolate and anise. Enters the mouth with rich robust dark toffee, and burnt malt. This is a very heavy feel, but very fullfilling and welcome. Smooth and well balanced over the entire palate. Finish is mellow and easy for this type. Mouthfeel is very thick and broading. A nice sipping beer for those long cold evil nights."
"Overall, this is a good one. It got a lot of flavour and is big without being over the top, which is a tough feat to accomplish sometimes."
"Dry and powdery, this is just an awesome brew. I just wish the hell we could get Stone in Illinois, or Missouri. This would make for a great evening brew with friends  sharing about 6 bombers thru a cool fall nite sitting in front of the bonfire."
"Amazingly drinkable for such a strong and complex brew. In my opinion, this is one of the best beers in the country, and one of the best beers I have ever had. Seek it out and enjoy."
"Notes: I find myself describing this beer much like I did Speedway Stout. It tastes like they mixed a stout with a barleywine. Not enough stout flavors and too much malt and alcohol for my tastes. I can see why this beer is so well liked, but personally, I prefer a roastier, dark malt flavor. I won't be reaching for this if I'm in the mood for an Imperial Stout."
"Very, very good."
"Really nice beer here, awesome aroma and nice flavor. Huge bodied but lots of alcohol. I'd gladly have this again and again, so its perfect from that standpoint but this is a huge beer and its drinkability is limited there. Double edged sword...whaddya do?"
"Had this on tap at O Briens. this was the first time i have had this beer on tap but one that i have enjoyed from time to tiem in the bottle. The tap version was better, but not by much. This sucker was dark as night with very little head. I would describe the aroma as coffeeish with some hops and malt playing aorund too. As for the taste, i have to say it really does not get much better than this. You get chocolate/coffee and malt upon first sip, then you are hit with the heavy hand of the hops and alcohol. This iss a very nice beer, though i dont know how many of these you coudl have."
"D - This RIS is a spectacular example of what an RIS should be in the drinkability category."
"I tasted the 2006 release of this beer. This beer pours as black as black can be with a dark brown head that settles into a light lace. The beer smells richly malt and of roasted coffee. It has a creamy malt sweetness and hints of caramel. There is a sweet fruitiness that settles into a light alcohol flavor. It has a smooth creamy feel with a crisp bite from the high alcohol content. In all this is a great example of an imperial Russian stout. If you like stouts that are over the top strong this is a must try."
"D: The 10.8% is steep and the alcohol is not well hidden. One bomber is more than enough for an evening."
"Almost like drinking whiskey. Harsh at first with a smooth finish. Coffee and chocolate mixed with a tinge of sweetness finishes with a brandy-like flavor. Medium body despit the sluggish motor oil appearance. This is once a night beer due to the high octane level. Maybe would have been better with some aging."
"Likewise, this is an eminently drinkable beer and hides its alcohol well going down. The low carbonation and full body made for a smooth mouthfeel. Roasted malts gave way to a rich, chocolately flavour that remained semi-sweet and never crossed over into bitter or burnt. It finished nice and dry."
"Wow, this is amazing. Appearance, yeah it's black, can't see a thing through it. Smell is, well, I get more coffee, but it's great just to breathe it in. Very smooth, alcohol content is very well hidden. This is pretty good stuff. Only thing I could ask for is a bit more carbonation and head retention."
"This beer is absolutely phenominal, It's only true better is Dark Lord."
"Overall, this brew is awesome. Make sure you drink at 50 - 60 degrees to get the full and intense flavor it has to offer. Several months ago I bought 6 bottles and one thing I 've realize is how hard it is to keep them stored. Must restock for the winter. Thank you Stone for making one hell of a brew."
"D: I've commented before that high ABV beers just don't seem as drinkable to me. This one is an exception. Of all my cellared beers, the Stone RIS is the hardest for me to age. I love sipping on one or two throughout an evening, and it is really one of my favorite beers. However, if you are one of those that find stouts too thick and filling, you should adjust the drinkability rating down one point. The flavors and hop presence make this beer easier to drink than a still, bland stout, but it's still VERY thick."
"D - Very Drinkable. Another awesome brew from Stone, they have not dissapppointed yet."
"Whenever I try a beer with the magnitude of hype that surrounds a beer such as Stone's IRS, I'm always a bit worried that it won't live up to it. However, with this one, I had no reason to worry. What a great beer."
"This brew lived up to - and exceeded - all of the hype for me. I've wanted to try this ever since I got into craft beer last spring, but just finally got my hand on a bottle last night while in DC. The extremely well balanced and complex taste makes Stone IRS one of my all-time favorites. I only wish I had readier access to this amazing brew!"
"Full bodied, chewy. Very smooth on the finish."
"The bottle said this was a limited early summer 2005 release. It poured into the hotel water glass with a big fluffy tan head that slowly disappeared; I need to travel with the proper glassware. The body is black, there is no light getting through at all. It had the look of olive oil being poured, very thick and viscous. The smell was really muted, only solvents getting through, and an alcohol bite. The taste was very complex. There was coffee with sweet cream, dark fruit (prunes), a spicy herb that I can't identify, and a bit of alcohol bite at the end of the sip. This beer is way more complex than my palate. It has a velvety smooth texture with a good level of carbonation. It is very drinkable for something this high in abv and complexity of taste. I am very glad I bought this. I think the Storm King is still my favorite because I like the hops."
"What a great beer, this one made me remember what love about Imperial Stouts. A multi dimensional beer that similiar to belgians has flavors that appear as it warms. Nice rich dark roasted malt, chocolatey coffee goodness, throw some hops in for good measure and you have one hell of a beer. I would fill the fridge with it if i could afford it. Way to go Stone."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 3/8"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head quickly falls, but here's plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma is heavy on the dark grains, with glimpses of dark fruit, and plenty of alcohol apparent. Taste is sweet chocolate and bitter coffee at the same time, some hoppy bits, with warming in the mouth and down the throat. Mouthfeel is velvet smooth, and drinkability are excellent for the style. Always worth revisiting, for a new vintage or just a new bottle."
"Dark brown, almost black, with a creamy head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, alcohol, malt, great. Taste is like it smells, coffee, chocolate, nice malty flavors. Texture is a little too syrupy and sweet, but just a little. Overall a heavy, very enjoyable stout, but for me its best in small amounts."
"Pours a coffee colored stout with cappachino like head with heavy retention. This beer oozes with chocolate and smoothness. Something I 'd excpect in Willy Wonka's fridge. A champion stout and one I'd been dying to taste. A wonderful after dinner beverage or just for dessert. Now I know why this is at the top of the list and hope I can snag a few bottles of this and hold on for those cold winter months ahead. Another great brew from stone who continues to impess me each time!"
"This beer is quite a bit more rounded out than the 04 I had. Broader, stronger carbonation, sweetness that is better balanced, fading seamlessly into a bitterness and heat, but less pronounced alcohol. This beer is absolutely exceptional."
"The pour into my little used (of late, anyway) snifter brings up a very sparse, large bubbled head, with a light coffee color. Lacing is almost nonexistent, but usually expected for the ABV. Of course, the beer is black as night. The nose is coffee, roast, a bit of licorice, a little unsweetened cocoa, and some caramel. Starts sweet, with a nice cocoa/coffee middle, ends with a lingering roasted taste that leaves chocolate in your mouth. Hides the alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is lighter than I'd like. Really, this is a very good impy, and I'm glad I came back to it."
"This is the best imperial stout I have ever had. And I've had lots of 'em! The only reason I gave it a 4.5 for drinkability is the high alcohol content. You simply can't drink as much as you would like to! The last time I had this was from a bottle, but before that was on tap, and if possible, it may have been even better on tap."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, oily. Not a very drinkable ale, unless it's 20 below outside with freezing snow blowing sideways."
"Thick India ink color- anisette and alcohol present in the nose  thick chewy body- spicy, toffee, coffee, and citrus taste- long sweet aftertasteThick India ink color- anisette and alcohol present in the nose  thick chewy body- spicy, toffee, coffee, and citrus taste- long sweet aftertasteThick India ink color- anisette and alcohol present in the nose  thick chewy body- spicy, toffee, coffee, and citrus taste- long sweet aftertaste"
"2006 Spring Release. Pours dark as hell with a nice top of chocolate foam. Smells of roast alcohol with a sweetness and earth spice. Taste is pretty right on with the smell but the alcohol pops out a little too much in the finish. The body was good for a ~11% beer and was good for the style. The 22 went down very easy and if it was sold in the area for a reasonable price I would have another. Thanks Indybeer."
"This was incredible. I'm really ticked that I didn't buy more since it's such a phenomenal beer. I'm hanging on to my second one for next winter as I've heard this baby only gets better with age. If you find the 2006, grab it fast. It's definitely worth it!"
"Big chocolate is present on the palate as well, but is more dark chocolate than milk chocolate. Malt is still there to round it out, nice and roasty, hops in there (though more tame in my aged bottles now), and it has a seamless integration of these components. Balance."
"Pours a very dark, thick, black with a slight head. Smells of coffee and alchohol. The taste is pretty complex. Lots of flavors are picked up throughout the drink. A nice coffee flavor is dominating at first,then the thick chocolatey taste takes over. You get a nice roasted coffee and alcohol taste with this drink. It is pretty ""heavy"" on the palate. This is a huge stout. One of my favs, would hightly recommend."
"Drinkability - not a session beer but drinkable and very good."
"Kudos to Stone on creating what I consider to be the best Imperial Stout that I've tried. They continue to exceed my expectations."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber marked ""Limited Spring 2006 Release"". Pours an opaque obsidian black with a thin finger mocha-beige head that slowly fades to light sticky lacing that coats the glass. Aroma is rich with a coffee roastiness, sweet malts, alcohol, bitter unsweetened chocolate. Taste is even richer than the nose lets on, hitting straight off the bat with an enormous malty sweetness that turns to roasty malt and coffee before leading off into the rich chocolate and alcohol finish. Leaves a slightly dry aftertaste, dry bitter roastiness paired with some warm alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, viscosity similar to used motor oil, slick and slippery on the tongue. Lower levels of carbonation, pairs well with the characteristics of the beer. Drinkability is excellent despite the higher abv, which is hidden well, only hinted at slightly in the nose and in the aftertaste. Rock solid beer, very good and true to the style, satisfying and indulgent. Perfect relaxing finish to a long day in the summer heat."
"KAA-POW! That's the first thing that came to my mind, then ""WOW!"" This beer is a one beer per night drink. Definitely sip this monster beer because it's so thick and syrupy that you can only sip it. The worst part about this beer was the overpowering taste of alcohol. You can smell it when you pour it when you drink it, even when it's just sitting there. This definitely needs another year or two to age just to mellow out the alcohol in it. The color is rich and black and there is a roasted smell with the complements of coffee. The flavor is chocolate, at least what I could tell throught the hot alcohol flavor. Drinking this beer is like putting vodka in a stout and ruining the flavors of the stout. And I also think this definitely needs more hops added to it for bitterness just to balance out the sweet malty taste of it and the incredible alcohol flavor. I was really disappointed with this beer. The Stone Ruination IPA was fantastic but this RIS is horrible."
"Extremely full bodied and complex, with some burnt coffee grounds up front coupled with an intense chocolate sweetness. A little harsh midsip, showing it's youth. This will age wonderfully.	 Plum like chewiness towards the end, excellent ripe fruit characteristics."
"Overall, this is a great beer. It's not a guzzler, by any means, and anyone calling this a session beer is a liar. But for what it is, it's done extremely well. I wish I had bought more, so I could cellar this and see how it changes over the course of a year or so. Strongly recommended."
"This was a 2005 bottle and I understand that it needs a year or two to gain its full potential. Liked it so much I bought a case of the 2006. Stone has some great beers and this one has to be the better of the batch."
"Overall, I've not been terribly impressed with this beer. Its good, and I'll drink another after it has some age on it, but not really among my favorites."
"Another job well done by Stone Brewing."
"Big and bold, but to much of a good thing"
"Drinkability/Overall: Mad drinkable for almost 11%, impeccable balance between sweet caramels and toffees and bitter coffees and chocolates and grainy malts. A great cap on a knockdown, dragout night of extreme beer drinking. Cheers, boys."
"Drinkability: Spectacular - completely drinkable despite a heavy complex flavor and a high ABV. Body carries this brilliantly. One hell of a beer - fantastic whether judged according to style, to flavor, or to sheer drinkability. Thanks again, Dane, for one of the nicest beers I've tasted."
"D: Though it was very good, it's not something I could drink horribly often, but something I would love to have again. This is definitly a sipper, I even shared my 22 and still had a hard time finishing it. Not because I didn't like it, but because it's so rich and heavy. a bomber of this goes a long way."
"Drinkability kind of suffers because of the alcohol hotness and the overall booziness of this one. Still not nearly as boozy as Weyerbacher Heresy, and Heresy is only 8% abv."
"An onyx brew that sucks everything else in the room away and leaves you purely focused on the beer and nothing but the beer. The smell then leaves you begging to taste what you know you are expecting. You are smelling the expectation of something so dark, so smooth so rich, yet so mellow that you could swill this stuff down faster than water itself. You finally take a swig and it tastes like a full compliment of laughing licorice soldiers with ginger helmets and their complimentary cavalry of mellow spice horses thundering across the plains of your tounge, You are forced to put more in your mouth uncontrollably. Once you begin to consume you will not wish to stop. Most excellent."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thick and creamy in the mouth... the carbonation is rightfully downplayed in favor of a smooth, slick, viscous experience. I'm savoring each sip, this will take you down if you're not careful. Great beer."
"One of the better beers I've tried from Stone Brewing Co. This one is over the top as usual, but not as much as the others. The flavor itself is quite good, but it seems as if they dumped some grain alcohol in during bottling. I like to feel alcohol in a beer, but not taste it. This has the distinct taste of hard alcohol -- while I don't mind the taste & feel, I personally don't think that it belongs in a beer. An interesting beer with some major strong points and worth trying, but overall... a novelty."
"Black color, dark brown head that quickly dissipated, I didn't get the head the picture shows, but maybe my glass was dirty. Smell is very nice. Full of chocolate, dark fruit, piney hops, coffee, and I think some oak was present. Taste doesn't let down either, chocolate in the beginning, coffee stepping in before a dry vanilla oak finish. Mouthfeel had great carbonation and was full bodied, heavy on the tongue. Very good beer, I wish I had easier access to it, but it's worth seeking."
"I really looked forward to this beer, after hearing so much about it. It poured absolutely pitch black into a snifter and the light from my halogen desk lamp did not even penetrate it, which was impressive. It had a very small tan head and left very little lacing. The smell of baking chocolate and roasted coffee beans predominated, with the taste being of bitter chocolate and espresso. There was very little carbonation and the mouth feel was at the same time heavy and silky, with very lttle carbonation. This is definitely the type of beer that one sips like a fine cognac."
"Let's get straight to the point on this one. It's an amazing beer, but I don't think it's worthy of #3 on Best of BA. Pours black with light brown head and smells a bit sherry-like, chocolatey brandy maybe with a bit of alcohol. The roasted flavors really came our in the flavor. Chocolate, burnt coffe, espresso, more chocolate, and warming alcohol; quite tasty and it really lingers. It has a nice thick mouthfeel, but it took me a while to get through maybe 5-6 oz. I'd call it a great beer, but not an epic."
"I am nourished, Stone Brewing Company. Well done."
"Man this is a great beer! Saw some at the store and bought the last four bottles they had. The head is light brown and thick, takes a bit to clear up. The taste is heavy stout all the way but I could definately taste the alcohol. Not too big on stouts but love this one. Goes great with a steak! One of my overall favorite beers! Hits you something fierce, don't mess around with this beer!"
"It pours like crude oil but looks like black gold to me. The head forms to a nice almost purple-ish hue. Smells like a chocolate coffee and slight alcohol. The taste kicks the crap out of my tongue, with delightfulness of course, bringing to light the smell that was heaved in but plum and raisens crept in to my surprise. Mouthfeel is fantabulous. Yes I just used that word but if you try the damn beer you will see what I mean. The Alcohol, though apparent in the smell, is masked well considering 10.8 %. I think last years offering is a little better but the 2006 early summer release is yet another supurb offering by Stone. An imperial stout that is hard to match."
"Very good *sneaky* beer..."
"Yeah, this beer definately does not benefit from warming. Ironic, it is usually the reverse."
"What a great Imperial stout: rich, thick with very nice burnt flavors and a great overall complexity. The alcohol is well hidden, barely detectable considering the nearly 11% ABV. Its not quite as good as in years past, but honestly, the difference is so minimal that it could be my taste buds numbing down or my palate becoming more demanding. In any event, its still very good and entirely satisfying. Highly recommended."
" Yum-tastical!"
"Pours an amazingly black color with a dark head that lasts for a bit. Smell is complex, sweet, roasted, alcohol and a bit of hops. The taste is very nice - a blend of sweetness, alcohol, dark fruit, roasted coffee and a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with little carbonation and a fairly clean finish that leaves the mouth salivating for more. A great beer and RIS. I'm excited to see how it ages."
"I really enjoy this...worth the praise it gets. Wish I had been able to grab more than one. I look forward to hopefully getting the 2007 release."
"This stuff is gorgeous and dangerous."
"Smooth and silky on the tongue, incedibly tasty and very drinkable. A finely crafted ale."
"Overall, an excellent beer; understandable why it's so highly rated on BA. I have 3 more bottles which I'll keep in the basement to enjoy over the 12-18 months."
"A shout out to MRMOJORISIN for sharing from his obscenely well-stocked stash."
"This is a very strong brew. Most things that stone make are this way so I expected a powerful drink. The Appearance is like oil. Its thick and dark as night. The smell is fantastic. All I can say is interesting. Black curant and even wildberry notes are in this. The taste is intense. Strong and hard to break down. There are similar tastes to the smell with notes of coffee and even chocolate. The mouthfeel is my only complaint. Its almost dirty, but in a good way. Not my bag but I can tell its a fine brew. Not something I will buy again so I cant give a 5 on drinkability."
"Holy glass of black perfection....thick, smooth, an absolute masterpiece. This beer is a rare find. I just about cracked open my bottle of Old Guardian that I'm cellaring becuase I just needed a 'kick you in the ass and leave you for dead' kind of brew. But luckily I got ahold of a Russian Stout. The pour was slow and deliberate and it oozed out thickly to produce a nice head of tans and light browns, the glass completely impenetrable by light. I held the glass up in direct sunlight, and failed to see the sun on the other side....how fitting for this beer, so complex and complete it can block out the sun. I let the stout sit for several minutes to warm ever so slightly and took a whiff. Coffee, chocolates, a bit of an earthy tone and the flavors of heavily roasted malts. I prepared myself for liftoff, raised my glass and took a sip. Outstanding. Rich, smooth, thick, the mouthfeel was exceptional. Flavors of coffee, roasted fruits, alcohol, and malts. It is right up there with Old Guardian as one of my most favorite beers in the ""Good God, how in the hell can this be over 10%abv"" category. Sip, savor, enjoy, and respect the black."
"Side note: This beer caused me to reflect on Stone's lineup and really grasp how incredible of a brewery it is. Stone just overtook the top spot in my book. RIS, Oaked Bastard, Old Guardian, Smoked Porter, IPA, Ruination, Levitation, Pale Ale. Every one of them outstanding."
" This is some tasty stuff. If you can find it try it for yourself."
"-Oelergud"
" D- I wouldn't want to drink this on a daily basis, but I enjoyed it enough that I would love to have this on special occasions."
"One year old at opening. Pours dark and thick like black oil. Slight brown head. Smells like a mildly sweet, black forest cake. Soft hint of fruit in the background. Be prepared to taste a little bit of alcohol, but then savor the creamy, balanced elixir. Strong malt to chew on and a subtle hop on the back end. This isn't beer...it is my dinner and dessert. I've got the same advice as everyone else: buy some to keep and open in front of a warm file a few years down the road. Who needs oak aging barrels when you've got Stone?"
"Gret beer and very drinkable. I think I'm going to try to get my hands on some more 2005 as well a cellar some 2006."
"D: Thanks to GClarkage for this awesome beer. This is my first Imperial Russian Stout, I love the style."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer for how big it is. I highly recommend it."
"Taste is very bitter, the hops bitterness hit you then followed by a burnt coffee flavors followed by a dark chocolate aftertaste. Quite carbonated, not very smooth, quite hard on the palate."
"Opaque and dark, some tan head, no lacing. No bubbles. Nose is coffee-esque- almost a frappuccino. Maybe coffee liquor. Nothing special. Taste is interesting. Alcohol is very present, a bit much. Coffee. An almost vodka aftertaste. Bitter, roasted. I'm not sure if I dig this or not. Tastes too young, this needs to grow up. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, somewhat sudsy. Drinkable for such a high alcohol beer, but definitely too heavy, too alcoholic to drink more than one of. Don't know if I could drink the whole bomber on my own. Eh, I wanted more from this beer."
"2006 version...ooh this remians a top brew. Poured a purplish black with a great head that lingers. Smell is a plethora of aromas: malt, oak cask, grapes, plums and a surprsingly understated alcohol presence. Taste is sweet malts, molasses and understated alcohol. It reminds me very much of Okocim Baltic Porter. Mouthfeel is smoooth, yet has a rich chewy note that sticks to the palate quite nicely. Drinkability is great for the high abv. This is a 10 abv? The smoothness belies that fact. Plus it finishes slightly dry, which is the crowning touch IMHO. A must try for all BAs."
"[edit] 11/11/07- True to my original review I have aged this one. And over a year since purchase it still is deserved of my only perfect 5. The aging process has made this one very smooth, with a bit more of a alcohol burn. My original review still stands, since I can't give it a 5+."
"I liked this beer OK, but it's not the first RIS i'd reach for..."
"Wow I thought Guinness was dark, this pours like oil, such a dark brown it appears black and isnt very transparent at all. It has a small dark tan head that leaves some light lacing. It has a bouquet of flavor that includes coffee, chocolate, spices and finishes with a light nutty scent. Wow Im not exactly sure how to describe the taste because of the many different flavors. It starts out with a clove/spice type flavor that lends way to a chocolate taste and then melds into a nutty coffee type flavor, although the alcohol is definitely present it hides the 10% quite well. So all in all a great tasting beer thats pretty damn thick, not exactly something Id have every weekend but a nice treat and would be a great finish to a large meal."
"Bottom line: Get it while you can. And if you can't, I have some for trade. This is quality stuff, indeed."
"Maximum respect to dmeadows for the trade to Stone-starved Western New York!"
"Mouth: Enters with a nice blend of flavors, like hot chocolate around a campfire, some smokiness, and a long lasting bitter flavor after swallowing like unsweetened baking cocoa. There are also some berry notes that come out as the beer warms, but I think it needs some time in the cellar before these flavors mature. On the downside, the alcohol in this beer stings my mouth before I've even swallowed. It's too noticeable, from the time the beer's about halfway through my mouth and on through the following exhale. Hopefully some cellar time will cure that as well."
"Excellent Brew!"
"Although this one might be a bit rough-drinking for the average beer-drinker, I love these big hearty beers that take you on a journey. Incredibly drinkable for such a high ABV brew. Only 3 left in my stash and I plan on trying one this time next year and two years from now. I'm gonna try to let the other sit for 5 years but its going to take some serious self-discipline to not crack this little gem open before then."
"This is my favorite beer, this bottle was a reminder of that. Cheers to Stone, cheers to Dano, and cheers to Chaingangguy who I had the treat to enjoy this beer with."
"Pours very thick (motor oil like if you will) with pitch black color and thick head and good lacing. Smells strong with coffee and toasted aromas. The taste just wasn't I was expecting. I somewhat expected a better blend of the flavors that just wasn't there. I felt the coffee taste overwhelms. Mouthfeel is thick and goes down smooth. Drinkability is high to low depending on your tolerance as the AC is high."
"One of the very best beers I have ever sampled. Worth the high ratings."
"Easy drinking for a dark beer."
"Highly recommended."
"For my 100th beer review, I decided to crack open a bottle of this gem that I acquired in a trade. The beer poured totally black with a 1/4 inch light brown head. Aroma was of coffee, roasted malts and hops. Taste was of espresso coffee with lots of smoky burnt flavors coming through and notes of cocoa, ripe fruit, alcoholic warmth and hop bitterness. This is without a doubt a sipping beer, very full bodied and sort of like drinking a sherry or port. Nevertheless, I finished off the bomber easily and found myself wishing I would have aged this a little longer. At least until the colder months arrive. Thanks to wcudwight for the trade."
"Drinkabilty is good , although I prefer to sip this one.Overall a great beer"
"What a great beer. Found this at the the Brickskeller in DC. Came in a really cool bottle (which I kept). Poured black and thick. Left head about one inch think. Nice lace which hardened to the side of the glass. Had a nice roast smell to it, reminded me of a nice chocolate desert. Taste was excellent. A smokey taste combined with chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Mouth feel was very full and think, great mouthfeel. Good drinkability. It is high in alcohol but the alcohol does not over power the taste of chocolate and coffee. Very drinkable beer. Each sip is like a spoonful of desert"
"medium carbonation leaves a smooth, rich mouthfeel. starts with some chocolate sweetness and some dark fruits then a chocolate bitterness and some piney hops. very drinkable for its strength. a good beer now and a damn fine candidate for cellaring."
"Drinkability: An excellent sipping beer that you better be careful about. 22oz. of this beer is good enogh for me! A great beer from a great brewery!"
"Worth a look, but IMO, this is a slightly overrated imperial stout. I'd choose Bell's Expedition Stout over Stone any day of the week."
"If the finest, plushest velvet was a beer, it may just be this one. Big, full, rich, lustrous, sumptuous-if I enjoyed this any more, the experience might become sexual. Wonderfully complex, it's so artfully blended that it's never a challenge, or too busy. The ABV is a kick, but it's too damned hard to care about that, at least until morning. If I had enough, I'd fill a tub with this beer and bathe in it, and then drink the tub dry. Well, ok...enough of that...let's just say, this is real close to as good as it gets."
"EDIT, October 18, 2008. I've now reviewed 400 beers. This beer is tied for #93 on my list, but is still hanging in on the Best of BA"" list at #16. How do you spell ""overrated""?"
"After a glassI already feel better, and somehow the rain doesn't seem so bad. A fantastic beer. I would love to have this side by side with speedway stout, because they are sort of on opposite sides of the Russian Imperial stout spectrum, this being the smooth and malter of the two, speedway more roasty and coffee like. Right now i'm very, very content, and will have to get several more bottles while I can. Not really to age, but just to make sure i can have one once a month at least. One of the best beers of all time."
"I rated this from notes I took while having it on tap at Pizza Port in San Clemente. I've also had it in bottles twice since then and it's been really consistent. An awesome beer."
"Wow. I like it. That is all I can say. This beer is currently going for $4 a bomber at a local market and is better by far than the Rogue IRS going for $13 in the nifty ceramic bottle. The taste is rich and complex. Not smoke. More like a bittersweet roasted flavor with burnt sugar in the background. It soothes my pallette like a gourmet coffee. I only regret not buying more. This is the best beer I have had in 6 years."
"D - bitter and sweet, but as i said well balanced, easy to drink, most people would love this"
"I've got two more bombers stashed away to age, so I'll be curious as to how they taste in a year or two."
"The beer as it sets in my 30 plus year old Chimay Chalice, is as black as they come, the head is prodigious in size, a beauteous chocolate brown color and spumous in texture as it evaporates in the blink of an eye, the resultant lace forms a Victoria Secrets like sheet of lace See-through got to love that? Nose is dominated by the toasted grain aroma, backed up by the coffee, chocolate, and a fresh and pleasing crispness I find so appealing. Start is ambrosial, thickly malted with the top as thick as the Ice in Maine Today! Briskly acidic, hops spanking in their spiciness and the aftertaste desert bleached bone dry, and my most highly ranked Imperial, and one of my most favorite Stone Brewing Creations, which is a tie with the rest of their beers, except for that Levitation stuff, just kidding Arrogant Nipple, I mean Greg!"
"An AMAZING beer worthy of all the praise given to it."
"I'm not much of a stout fan, but this beer might have just converted me. I'm definitely going back tomorrow and am going to try to pick up a case of this stuff. I can't think of a better after-dinner drink, and I can tell right away this would go extremely well with a nice, creamy Connecticut-wrapped cigar."
"Appeared a viscous, opaque, black with a soft, mocha-colored head that dissipated quickly and left behind some lacing. The surface was covered in small bubbles that seemed to be immovable. Aromas of plums, dark chocolate, alcohol, and coffee. The taste was similar with the addition of bittersweet candy. Smooth with a suprisingly bitter finish. Hops were present in the background. Dry, chewy, and viscous in my mouth. Quite enjoyable, but too rich to enjoy repeatedly."
"Great job, Stone! I'll keep a bottle of this to age-- I bet the flavors will just get richer with time!"
"I waited to make this my 50th review and man was it worth the wait. This beer pours black and is opaque with a small beige head forming. The aroma is amazing, chocolate and coffee scents with some currants in there as well, followed by little bit of hops. The taste is wonderful, it starts a tad bitter, then a sweet taste of chocolate comes in, ten ends with a nice clean finish, there is alot going on in this beer. The alchol is present in the flavor and the mouthfeel as well, which is more dominated by the thickness of this beer. It is almost like a syrup, it coats the palate and lingers there for sometime making you wanting more. Drink this beer slowly and enjoy one the premier beers in the world."
"While there's undenying the alcohol content (at 10.80% ABV), the warmth it provides is not overbearing and it's quite drinkable. I imagine having this aged a year or two will bring out some other characteristics. Pretty damn good now too."
"Coffee with cream? Tootsie Roll."
"Notes: Once it got in my mouth, it was perfect. There was so much build up. Was it justified or overhyped? I think it was justified, but not the perfect beer yet. We will see how it does in a few months and years (4 in the cellar so far, and more to join them soon)."
"Notes: Still very tastey, definatley is different from previous years, not quite as pronounced aromas and the flavors are not as big and billowing as in previous releases, much more creamy and no big defined currant flavors. Still a good sipping brew though and the mouthfeel I'd say improved. An interesting beer to follow year to year."
"Edit: I am having trouble finishing the bomber, so down goes the drinkablity score. Honestly, people, what is with the obsession over this beer? I'm not sure that tasting heavier than ""Siberian crude"" is really such a good thing."
"Average drinkability. The sweetness definitely hinders this. It seems like a chore to finish the whole bottle. The 2005 release was so much better than this. It seems odd that this was the same recipe. My other two 2006 release bottles will remain in my basement for a year or two, hopefully developing some positive characteristics."
"Enjoy and Cheers."
"I was prepared to be a bit disappointed because of the hype, which is sometimes overrated. But, in this case the hype was well-grounded!"
"(My thanks to AndoBrew for sharing this one with me.)"
"Drinkability: Rather addicting really. Delicious flavor leaves one yearning for more. The alcohol doesn't hide in the taste, but regardless, this one is highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: 10.8%... go figure... never would have known this as the alcohol is hidden to near perfection. Could drink quite a bit of this... pass that bomber back over here. Unfortunately did not live up to the quite high expectations I had, but certainly a very enjoyable experience."
"D: No trace of the alcohol. Don't think I could drink more than a bomber in a night. Definetly a stout that I would buy a few times a year as a treat to myself."
"Notes: first time I had this I had some roquefort cheese and white grapes. Very nice indeed. I followed that with some Indian foods including a vegi dosa. The Indian food went perfectly with this brew. I'd give it all fives if rating was on that."
"Drinkability: Yes, I'll have another. My advice is drink one now and save a bunch for later. On the bottle they suggest a case! That's why I love Stone. They know what they're about, and if I had the funds right now I would snag one in an instant. There's a reason this beer is so highly regarded."
"-Cheers2Beers-"
"Poured a deep dark black color with a medium tan color head almost like old used motor oil. Had a fusal hops, with chocolate and coffee. Very nice aroma. The flavor was more of the same with lots of chocolate and coffee. A very sweet almost like molasses. Has a fusal hob bitterness that helped mellow it all out very nicely. Wonderful flavor. Mouthfeel is chewable. This was one of the thickest mouthfeels I've had. Mild carbonation. Exceptional beer."
"With the alcohol, and the persistant aftertaste of soy sauce, I really think last year's batch was much easier to drink, which is really too bad. I had my hopes set extremely high for this beer."
"Taste: Surprisingly smooth at first, the hop astringency gradually comes along in the end, making a kind of wave that's creamy, then just a bit sweet, then bitter and warm from the alcohol. I wouldn't drink tons of this stuff, but when I have a feel for a RIS I wouldn't mind having some of this."
"Overall a really interesting beer that I enjoyed. I think was made this beer really unique is the fact that it is so new and already balanced really well without the taste of alcohol... Give it a try if you get a chance."
"This could most likely chill in the cellar for a while to bring out the best of it, but it is pretty damn complex as it is now. Obviously a big, serious brew; one bomber's probably enough for one sitting. A rather tasty stout though, if I may say so myself, but it can only get better after sitting around a while..."
"GREAT"
"2006 bottle. Pours jet black with a small, creamy, tan head. Quickly fading, no lacing. The aroma is very sweet - golden grapes, chocolates and figs. Overall, the nose is suprisingly mellow for a monster Imperial Stout. Flavor is also very sweet - lots of dark fruit, chocolate, molases, becoming bitter and roasted at the end when some coffee and dark chocolates come in. Finish is long, sweet and slightly bitter with a heavy dose of warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is big, rich, creamy and coating. This one is a bit too hot for me, lets hope it mellows with some age."
"Drunk Responcibly;) -Matt"
" This isn't quite the greatest stout I've ever had but I will definitely be looking for it again soon."
"GREAT BEER as stone does now and again!!!"
"D: Last year's edition was the best beer that I've ever had to date, and this year's was a bit of a dissapointment to me. This is still one of the best beers out there, but not as good as I remember. I'll be cellaring the rest of my bottles in hopes that the flavor will smooth out."
"I've just poured the remaining contents of the bottle. My glass is literally hissing at me. Or is it the gargoyle on the bottle? Stone doesn't mess around."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. This brew poured the darkest black wherein no light permeated. Nice chocoalte milkshake head that fades quick but leaves the tiniest layer throughout. Smells strong of alcohol and cinnamon with notes of plum and pomegranate. Taste is sweet with notes of coffee. The gentle hops play off the moderate vinous taste. Alcohol is clearly present but is overwhelmed by a nice complexity. As it warms, green apple and vanilla notes make their prescence known. A giant among beers. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy. Drinkability is hindered because the alcohol does play prominently in taste. Overall, a big complex beer that leaves you with a warmth and a sense of what went into its creation."
"Fantastic brew overall. I think the aging worked well - though not to such a drastic effect as I had anticipated. I would say that at most it was a bit more subdued. Not sure if hte increased carbonation was a part of it (I would have expected the opposite)."
"Given the strength two would be plenty - but many other brews of this heft (I smoked a pork shoulder with less meatiness) would have me shouting ""No mas!"" after one bottle. Damned fine brew."
"Now the mouthfeel is where this beer shines like a spotlight. It coats the mouth like an oil spill. The carbonation is like a fragile work of art. Delicately spilling over the tongue and the rest of the mouth. If I had the means I would be happy to drink this whenever I craved a stout. The reputation is well deserved."
"Thoughts: This is just as good as the Victory Storm King Stout in all categories except taste. But This is not a 4.5 beer in the taste department so I deducted .5 from the drinkability score. I think storm king has a little more going on in the taste department but that is not to slam this great. beer. But there can only be one top stout and this one makes a good case for that title. Excellent in every way."
"another great drinkable brew by stone. this one's a sipper though so be carefull with it."
"This is an excellent beer. I know that by the time I make it back to the store where I got this beer, it will all be gone. While I consider myself lucky to have gotten the beer, I’m cursing myself for not buying more of it. I guess I learned my lesson for next year."
"Can't recommend this one enough, get some or you'll be sorry. And don't forget to get some for your thirsty cellar !!!"
"New 2006 release. Thick inky black pour, no real head, just dark tan swirly foam. Aroma is nice and strong, with intense coffee notes, very roasty, with hints of light chocolate and black currant/dark fruits. Alcohol not very strong in the nose. The taste is rather dry, and mostly like coffee, with chocolate undertones. Moderately bitter, the alcohol taste is slight, but becomes strong over time. Thick mouthfeel, but smooth and slick feeling. This beer goes down easily, until the alcohol catches up to you, but I am looking forward to cellaring for awhile, because as it stands this stout lacks the depth to be a top 10 or even top 100 brew yet."
"All in all...easily the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. The best beer ever? Well, I do like a balanced brew, and on that end this could use some cellar time to mellow, but honestly, I also love a big, in your face brew from time to time, and I have never, ever, never, ever had a brew this big and in your face. I loved every sip of it and would open more, if I weren't saving it for future tasting. Yeah, fantastic beer...it definitely belongs where it is on the Best of BA list, and recognition as my first every solid 5 rating."
"When the beer enters your mouth the first thing you notice is how thick and syrupy it is. It comes in a just coats your mouth. On the way down your throat it gives off a nice alcohol warming feeling. This is a beer to be taken slowly and to let it warm so one can pick apart all the flavors. I really liked this beer I'm going out soon to buy more. One for right when I get home and others too cellar."
"This poured into a snifter. The dark choclate/black color produced a rether big tan head. The aroma is the common roated coffee beans and then some spicy (hop?) aroma. The taste is bitter up front and a little astringent in the end. There is coffee, bitter sweet choclate, and a little plum twist. The astringence detracts from the mouthfeel and the drinkability. The alcohol warms you rather quickly; the heat is just a tiny bit present. The body is big, but not overly filling. A good stout!"
"music: richard ashcroft: keys to the world"
"I tend to be a little bit critical (compared to the rest of BA) of Stone beers, but this is, in my opinion, one of the best beers, and the very best stout, in the world. This is US beer experimentation at its best. It takes a style that is traditionally pretty easy-drinking, because of the lack of bitterness, and makes it in-your-face. This beer is very malty, with strong notes of semi-sweet dark chocolate, plus some coffee. But, it also has a stong bitterness (without an overt hoppiness) that defines the finish. It is HUGE, with absolute hop/malt balance. Drinakbale, but with a great bite, Stone RIS is a fantastic beer."
"Beautifully done again, Stone! Will prolly go with Ye Olde Rasputin in a pinch though. Never thought i'd be a Stout enthusiast. Things change, don't they?"
"Although this beer is high in alcohol, I have had it as a session beer before. I get a little buzzed, but it works. I think I could drink this beerall week long. I would like to install a drinking fountain in my garage that pumps this beer out."
"Definitely recommended!"
"Well, Ill put this one up there with North Cast Old Rasputin and Rogue Imperial Stout. Not only one of the best Imperial Stouts Ive had, but one of the best beers."
"Correspondingly, this lends itself to a much quieter and much more gracious drinkability. While some US Imperial Stouts command the world's attention be on them and are so bold so as to provoke standing, shouting grunts of ""U-S-A, U-S-A", this one invites a fireplace, or a good book, or a hearty meal, or a game of cards, or silent, solitary, discerning and high-minded reflection on things much bigger than the beer itself."
"Haven't had this one in a while. Pours an opaque black/brown, small tan head, some thick lacing on the glass, and nice retention. Smell is killer, roasty chocolate and coffee, vanilla, sweet and malty, some alcohol. Taste is roasty sweet, very chocolate and coffee, vanilla, some licorice/anise, little cherry, very smooth for such a beast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with low carbonation, super smooth, 2005 edition. Thanks DrJay!!"
"With well over 400 reviews on this one, I'm not adding anything I'm sure hasn't already been said. But after drinking Stone's Imperial Russian Stout I had to in the very least say that this is the very best stout I've ever had. The look, the smell, the taste, everything was heavenly. It poured out like coffee syrup with a scent so intense I swear smelled soy sauce. The head was thick and nearly as black as the beer. The feel was creamy soft. The taste...oh my...so many favors danced on my tongue, I'm not good enough a writer to express them all in words..."
"Taste is how it smells, but only more powerful. The alcohol really stands out as it warms up. Not very thick, which is surprising. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for this style. Sits on top of my list of favorites for this style."
"Overall: Last night I came across a lost Review for a 2003 Bottle of Stone Imperial Stout, and it inspired me to immediately pop a bottle of my 2004 IRS stash into the Fridge and gave it a day to cool off. I just added the 2003 Review which is a year old, and seemingly following my own advice in that Review, so is this bottle of 2004 Imperial Russian Stout. I have to say that I still hold firm that this brew is best enjoyed with about 12 months under its belt. An utterly brilliant creation and definitely one of Stones premier offerings. It cant be long before the 2006 Release appears, heck, this 2004 bottle still has a $3.49 price sticker on itbarrr-gain. Each Bomber is worth twice that coin in my book."
"Bottle(room temp  July 2005 release): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a bid foamy dark brown head with pretty good retention. Aroma of roasted malt with some coffee. Roasted caramel malt are easy to distinguish with some very easily distinguishable coffee. I was expecting a bit more complexity (liquorice, chocolate, plums) or even more hops. Body was quite full and alcohol was well hidden. Overall, this is a very good imperial stout but I was expecting a bit more complexity and I still have to say that I would drink Expedition over this any day."
"Not much to say other than if you like the style go buy this beer. I got mine for $6, to me that is a super impressive deal for this awesome beer."
"Opaque. Black. Gentle aroma of rich malts, providing chocolate, coffee and roasted notes accompanied by a thick resiny hop leaf and scents of dark fruits, vanilla and brandy. Intense raisin, black licorice, molasses and brandy character ending with a huge dose of anise and a hint of chocolate and coffee. All, somewhat put together by a well hopped profile and a cunning bitterness. Its a nice beer, no doubt, but to me, its too hoppy and its a little to fruity, thin and sweet. After about 8 months in the bottle, after its allowed to mellow, its a 4+ for sure."
"Drinkability: This is where I knock it down a bit. Not because it's high in alcohol (though it is), but more because it's just such a strong, aggressively flavored stout. There are far more drinkable imperial stouts (Victory Storm King, Samuel Smith, Weyerbacher Old Heathen/Heresy) - this one is just so bold that I can only down one bomber without either switching to something else or stopping altogether."
"Mouthfeel is thick, quite viscous, but remains drinkable. Impression is of a very, very strong, alcoholic espresso (which ain't bad at all). Some cocoa flavors in this beer would pair very well with dark chocolate. It's not a Dark Lord-type of evil, but don't leave it alone with your grandmother."
"Re-reviewed on 3-6-07 and had to knock it down a few notches due to some much better stouts reviewed since. It's still a massive brew worthy of it lofty rating, just not the perfect 5 I gave it on first review."
"Drinkability = I wouldn't be able to have more than a 1/2 bottle of a 1/2 bottle shared. It's just too overpowering. I think I need more food to compliment this beer, like a calzone from Bova's Bakery."
"Still a great Russian imperial stout. I believe I need to set aside another few of these for 5 years."
"Jet black spent oil color. Little head with little retention. Slight webby lacing. Roasted coffee smell with some alcohol smell bleeding through. Smooth thick feel with huge coffee taste and alcohol bite. Alcohol comes through heavy in the finish. Oddly enough, doesn't have warming feel as much as a cooling effect on the throat. Great RIS. Thanks to BeerBeing for this one."
"Black color with very small tan head. Was expecting a much larger more prominent head. Smell of cherries and plums, slight alcohol note that becomes more prominent as you drink, chocolate, coffee. It's all in there, everything you would expect from a IS. The coffee flavor stands out the most to me in the taste. Mouthfeel is actually a little thinner than i would have expected. Overall this is definitely an above average beer but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Maybe I was hoping for too much but it just didn't blow my socks off."
"Thanks to Stone for another winner."
"d - Could drink way too many of these. Each sip invites another and now unfortunatlely I have sipped mine to bottom of the glass. I'll be heading out to the beverage store tomorrow."
"World class all the way!"
"I bought two of these at CIty Wide in South Bend and im cellaring one for later. The other one we had last night at our South Bend Coalition of the Drinking club. This is the early summer 2005 release. Pours black, black, black. creamy caramel colored head with good lacing. fantastic overall appearance. Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, prunes. Taste was great. smoky roasted maltiness, coffee-also roasted, sourness like coffee grains, alcohol not totally hidden. Smooth in the mouth. smacks the roof of the mouth a bit for the first sip or two. Faaaantastic drinkability. i only give it a 4.5 though because im so optimistic about the one im cellaring that i want to leave room to give it a better score."
"The drinkability factor could be considered as pretty darn drinkable. This brew wasn't really a mammoth by any stretch. Sure the abv is up there pretty good, but the cleanliness makes this thing dangerously drinkable. A very solid brew, but I have to say that it appears to be greatly overrated. I was expecting more based on the numbers, but this just proves how irrelevant all of our opinions are. To each his own as they say."
"Summer '05 Release. Finally got around to rating this one. Aroma was light bread, strong coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted. Moderate yeast and a bit of dough. This baby pours black with minimal head. Excellent lacing that fully diminishes. This is one full bodeid brew that's oily/syrupy with only a little carbonation. This is my favorite RIS. As I have a bunch of these, I'll be adding my reviews as they age."
"This is a marvelous beer and I highly recommend it."
"Overall this beer lives up to its hipe!!!! This is the first beer that I can honestly say is worthy of a perfect score!! The only downfall is that Stone is not sold in MIchigan yet. So, I'll keep trading or make many trips to Toledo to pick my new favorite beer!"
"Thanks to karengarys for hunting the beast down for me."
" and I knew from the moment my lips touched the bottle and I gently savored that warm sweet smell before sipping, that there was indeed something truely special at work here. Its dark with huge coffee and chocolate flavors along with some rather imposing but welcomed fruit flavors .The mouthfeel is indeed fantastic experience as well. Overall a Great first tasting beer!"
"Next time you see it in the stores (I think I bought mine in april or may) pick up a few bottles. This is one beer well worth every single penny!"
"and drinkability? well, ok, its 10+%abv makes it hard to session (ha!! thats an understatement). but after this, i doubt anything will taste the same. i've still got half a pint left and it has changed the way i think about beer. is it possible to cram too much of a good thing into one bottle? nah. just call it stone irs and leave it at that."
"Drinkable, if you can find it. It hits all the bases, and is one of the best."
"This is a phenomenal beer."
"Black-not just black but BLACK. Whisper of a head. Aroma of dark chocolate and black currants. Somewhat floral and hoppy. Big, thick roasted malt flavor. Very heavy hand has been used on the hops-decent balance between the hops and roasted malt. Licorice and anise really dominate. Has the perfect inky and oily slickness that I love in an Imperial Stout. Very, very drinkable beer. Who could criticize such a brew..."
"Maybe the bitterness may be a little boring after a while."
"Drinkability - Quite exceptional, I dont see myself drinking more then 1 of these in an evening, but that 1 is savored till its last drop."
"my christmas eve beer. early summer 2004 release. From the bottle. poured black with a big bubbly brown head that left some lacing. aoma coco bitter sweet chocolate, molasses, a light touch of alcohol as it warm the coffe and dark fruits come out, roasted malts. flavor wooow I can see why this is rated number 2. the first thing that hit the taste buds was the coffee and alcohol than the roasted malts and the sweet berries than along came the chocolate nice mouth feel. would like to get a lot of this stuff"
"This was the last bottle in the store and I'm glad I got it, and its matching glass too. If you see a bottle, snatch it up."
"Drinkability: Dam this is a good beer. This is a very full bodied, very big balanced treat. Gods of Beer I love this brew!"
"Can't wait to see how the ""bottle konditioned (nice touch with the 'k,' Stone!)"" 2004 version tastes. I may pass out."
"Deliscious. Rich, thick, flavorful. This stout is worth seeking."
"This beer pours a dark black with brown tones and has a thick tan head that lingers with the entire pour. The smell is of dark chocolate, plums, raisins, black cherries and no alcohal to be smelt. As I tasted this beer the bitterness from the hops kicks to the fore-front as well the malty chocolate essence and finishes sweet caramel and nutty. This beer is so smooth I could drink it all day."
"22 ounce bottle. Stone Imperial Stout chugs out a thick, black color into my Duvel glass. It is topped with a small, dark brown head. The aroma is roasted coffee, licorice, chocolate, and raisins. Huge roasted malt flavor. Sweet, but not overly so. Hoppy in the finish. Perhaps the thickest mouthfeel I've experienced in a beer, but the truly amazing thing is that the drinkability does not suffer for this at all. This beer is very drinkable, and at almost 11% abv. A great beer that lives up to the hype."
"drinkability: very drinkable, especially compared to expedition stout or rogue imp"
"Wow.... glad I have two more of these in the cellar.... absolutely phenomenal."
"Thanks Len!"
"Drinkability: I originally had this at a 4, but I'm actually moving it down to a 3.5. The reason for this is that alcohol presence. I was able to finish the bomber, but it took me the better part of two hours. I'm very tempted to buy a bottle of this and toss it in the cellar for a year or so. I bet that it would age very, very well (and would probably change this number score quite a bit)."
"Its fairly easy to drink for the style, but its one thats made to savor. Not much alcohol present, but it could pack a punch if you rush."
"I love this beer. I knew that when I first tried it, there was something special going on here. Its super dark with huge coffee and chocolate flavors along with some strange fruit flavors that sneak in. The mouthfeel is really pleasant as well. Fantastic beer!"
"This is a very good full flavored beer that hides it's 10% alcohol very well."
"Lives up to its reputation, but NOT to be taken lightly. This is hardcore, As such, I would only tackle this beast every so often."
"SIRS is Stone's finest creation and is infinitely deserving of a place in the pantheon of the greatest beers ever created. I've run out of adjectives for 'great', but I haven't quite run out of beer. So if you'll excuse me, it's time to savor the final few swallows. Stone Russian Imperial Stout is a tour de force and is the finest stout in existence, bar none."
"Drinkability: Excellent, an outstanding Imperial Stout. Well worth the ratings, because this is a big beer which can appeal to more beer drinkers, becuase it isn't over the top like many beers in the Imperial/Double stout category."
"This beer may have a high alcohol kick to it, but you definately get a well balanced mix. There is so much going on in this brew that it is definately a must have for anyone that loves a good stout, or a strong brew."
"Summer 2005 release. Pours a thick consistency, blacker than black, and totally opaque. Light brown head is dense and creamy, and reaches a full fist in hieght. The retention is excellent, holds a tight half-inch cap, but leaves only weak patchy lacing. Vinous dark fruit nose, with hints of bakers chocolate and cascade hops. The taste is boldy sweet at first, chocolate malt and roasted barley. Some fusel notes are perceived as it warms, but a dry, american hop bite in the aftertaste keep the ABV and sweetness in check. Finish is dry, but leaves some traces of fig/plum and a slight alcohol smack. The full body and flat carbonation lend an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel and combine with the well-rounded flavor to allow a high drinkability. Magnificent."
"M&D. Another tremendous offering from Stone. Creamy all the way through, its drinkability is hurt a little by its high alcohol content."
"Slick oily mouthfeel. Heavy hitting, thick and chewy. This is a great Imperial just perfect for a cold winter evening playing chess or reading a book."
"full chewy body with light carbonation. silky mooth and a pleasure to drink. excellent drinkability, packed with flavor, but not overwhelming or excessive ever. it just makes you want to have more. seek this out, it's top notch as far as this type of beer goes. stone never disappoints."
"Very drinkable!"
"Nice dark and heavy mouthfeel to this beer. It's a full bodied dark brew that feels great on the tongue. This beer is low in carbonation as well it should be, I don't think that a beer like this would be very good with high carbonation. This beer is excellent, and is definitely worth the money I spent on it. I would definitely buy it agian. As to the actual drinkability of this beer it is something to be sipped, I imagine if you drink too many of these in one night you'll easily get sick. Definitely an amazing beer go grab one if you haven't had this."
"Shared with my homebrew buddy. Shipped from S. California thanks to my good friend OstrungT."
"enjoy"
"Another bombshell by stone."
"The drinkability is great considering how big this beer is. Stone is such an incredible brewing company."
"Ahh the Stone Imperial Russian Stout. Always a good choice. Let's see how it has held up over the past 2 and a half years. Pours near black with a quickly dying half centimeter of brown foam that doesn't leave much behind. Just as expected. Swirling does bring back some foam. The smell hits me before I'm even finished pouring. Molasses, vanilla, raisins, coffee, rum, and oh so much chocolate behind it all. A hint of oxidation. Now to taste. The coffee and roasted grain bite first, you can really taste them on the tip of the tongue. Chocolate is there in force, as the smell suggested. Sweetness dominates in this beer after the initial bite - the molasses and dark fruit, especially raisins, really come through, with some vanilla as well. The sweetness is defnitely kept in check, however, by the harsh acidity of the roasted grain and coffee. Bittering hops are there too, but don't seem to play much of a role. Never does the beer as a whole actually become harsh. On the contrary, it is actually very smooth and easy drinking for such a big beer. Again, there is a bit of oxidation in the finish, but it is tucked in neatly behind the bitter coffee aftertaste and the chocolate. Very well blended flavors in this, one, but it's definitely a sipper. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for the style, and very smooth."
"The first impression of this beer was the extremely dark body and dark head, with mild lacing. Even holding this up to the light gave little idea of color. It smelled of the typical roasty, chocolate, but was far more complex and very well balanced. The taste was also chocolate with hints of coffee, and one of the best balances of malts and alcohol Ive ever had. The smoothness was incredible, with minimal carbonation. It finished as good if not better than when I started it, what I consider a rarity among Imperials. This was drinkable to the very end. Overall, this was one of the best Imperials I have ever had. Even if youre not the biggest Imperial fan, give it a try, it might make you a believer."
"The body is super big. A very rich an complex malt. An exceptional example of how an Imp Stout should be. I am a little deterred by the phenol flavor but overall I still impressed."
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful beer."
"I can't believe how black this beer pours. I can't coax a hue out of this even with holding it up to the light. And what a thick tan head on the pour. About an inch and a half which diminishes to a nice ring of foam leaving lacing down the glass. Very impressive for 10.8% The nose is a symphony of aromas. Dark ripe fruits, unsweetened chocolate, with a faint roasted hint and some slight alcohol. Very very nice. Strong dark fruits up front blending seamlessly into a chocolatey bitterness with a strong alcohol warmth on the finish. This beer packs a punch, but does it with velvet gloves. You can tell the strength, but it hits you gently. Quite lovely, but it's going to take me the whole night to finish this bomber. Lovely thick and almost syrupy mouthfeel. Very minimal carbonation and smooth as silk. A very very lovely beer. I only wish I could get this more readily, I'd probably buy a case. Definitely something to cellar. Special thanks to Air Canada for getting this home in my luggage in one piece."
"d - didn't go well with buffalo wings."
"Taste: Incredibly smooth and creamy in the mouth, with the initial flavors of cocoa combining with that to give the distinct impression I'm drinking a cellar-temp café mocha. Amazingly drinkable for a beer this big. Age has done this one right! Big espresso bite after the swallow, with a lightly bitter and slightly astringent finish. Warming alcohol presence noticeable in the flush of my face, but not in the taste. Excellent imperial stout, and a definite top five beer overall for me."
"-UF"
"Proceed with extreme caution..."
"2005: Pitch black, dark brown, chocolatey head that leaves trails of lace down the side of the glass. Very fine head reduces to a ring and sticks around throughout. Strong roasted and burnt aroma, coffee, dark chocolate and lots of caramel malt. A bit smokey as well, with some vinous alcohol, ripe fruit, and licorice. Moderate bitterness with a bit of hop flavour balances out the roasty malt and alcohol very well. This brew is full of dark malts, giving it plenty of roasty coffee flavour and a bitter chocolate. The alcohol flavour blends into the background along with a bit of acidic smoke. Finishes with just a bit of bitter dryness from the roasted grains with a fair bit of sweetness. Theres lots of alcohol warmth going down, but no harshness. Smooth and creamy, full bodied with low, well-integrated carbonation. Wow. This is a great beer, well balanced and exactly what an imperial stout should be. It'll be fun trying this one again once it's aged a while."
" This sample has convinced me to not touch my stash of 05 IRS for at least a year, and to get more."
"An incredible imperial stout. My favorite to date, and I think it would be very hard to top."
"Alcohol is the only burner in the drinkability of this brew. A fine nightcap, if I must say so myself."
"Drinkability: All around an excellent stout, Russian Imperial or otherwise. Rich and full of wonderful roasty flavor and dark chocolate goodness. It leaves a velvety smooth feel in the mouth and tastes great. When it comes to price and availability, this is one of the best stouts out there. Wonderful this year as every year so far."
"I had heard so much about this beer that I went out and bought the last 3 bombers I could find. Now that I have had one, I believe the hype. Too bad this is only a seasonal, I will hoard the remaining two and await this year's batch eagerly!"
"update (01.14.08): after having this a couple more times (once aged a year on draft) I'm forced to knock this one down a bit in flavor and drinkability. A distinct, and consistent briny soy-sauce flavor (peated malt?) more present than many other impy stouts I've had since. Still, a strong offering."
"Overall: an unsurprising surprise. For all the hype, I expected to be let down and was not even for a moment."
"Damn, this is beer is kicking my ass tonight. After a big Notre Dame win versus Michigan, I knew I needed to pull somthing nice out tonight. Appears as black as any brew I've tried, this one does not overwhelm me like Stone's barleywine. Combined with a Smore and more chocolate, this one complements any dessert. Packs a nice punch, the sweet malts balances any taste of alcohol. Definitely worth the $4.99 22 oz bottle."
"This is one really big sumbitch. I can feel it after half the bottle, and my tolerance is pretty damn high. I like this alot. It's not a session beer, nor is it something you would drink every day, but for every now and then, or special occasions, it's wonderful. Highly recommended."
"Big, thick, and strong, full of flavor, and dangerous b/c the ABV hides itself well. Could hit this again and again."
"Poured into my tulip glass a black blacker than any beer i have ever seen before. I held it up to the light in the kitchen... nothing... total darkness. She had a nice dark brown head that fell to a ring around the glass leaving no lacing at all. The smell is of roasted malts, molasses, fresh brewed coffee, rich dark chocolate, and hints of vanilla and alcohol. The taste was a powerful roasted malt, with chocolate, coffee leading into an aftertaste of slight hops alcohol and dark chocolate lingering on the tongue. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, very thick and enjoyable. Very drinkable beer for an impy stout lover like myself. I cannot wait to try this one after it has some age on it. So good, so damn good."
"Notes: A very solid Imperial Stout. Very much worth your time."
"Opinion: Golly gee, this is not your ordinary beer! It is way big, and something that I personally would only drink on occasion. I shared a bottle with some of my club members at a brew-in yesterday, and I am glad I didn't try to tackle this beer on my own. I think that this beer would do well to sit down for at least two years at 50F to let the hops mellow and the alcohol to add complexity. Like this, it hits your palate with brute force."
"Aaak! This beer sure looks good, but it sure aint of me. Stone RIS pours an oily thick pitch black witha huge brown head. As the head disapates, it leave so great lacing. In the nose there is some dark chocolate and alcohol. The bottle mentions anise. That must be the scent that is turning me off. Same with the flavor. After a while of drinking, Im starting to come around. I think its somewhat astringant. Hard to drink. I surley dont think this is one of Stones best."
"Thanks to GClarkage for the samples."
"So i poured from the bottle to glass and the color is rich dark black, couldn't see through to the other side. aroma is definately roasted with chocolate and coffee notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a lasting aftertaste. A bit rough around the edges as it leaves your mouth almost a bit puckered, but I have been assured that aging does wonders for this one. The head was thick caramel with a definate java note. I can't wait to drink this one again, and again, and again. Thank you Stone!!!"
"Drinkability is good still a nice IRS but doesn't live up to the 04 yet which seemed perfect fresh. Then it has been a year and I have had lots of big Stouts since then so maybe my tastes have matured either way believe this one will only improve with age. Have to do a tasting this winter 04 vs 05."
"Very drinkable for a RIS however something one would want to savor with a good steak or close the evening right before bed."
"Wow, the head on this beer is darker than most beers I'm drinking these days. Beautiful chocolate brown head and dark, almost syrupy-pouring beer. The taste isn't syrupy, though, as the carbonation cuts through nicely. The body in this beer reminds me of Double Bastard, but the flavor is (of course) a more chocolatey, coffee taste. I don't get the ""dark fruits"" that a RIS is supposed to contain, but I think my tongue (or my brain?) is less sensitive to the fruity esters that beers contain. This beer is probably too over-the-top for an August evening such as right now, but I think I'll be picking up another of these in the winter!"
"Overall, a solid brew. A little strong on the sweetness and the alcohol in my opinion."
"An early summer 2004 addition that I sat on for over 1 year. It's aged beautifully."
"Tastes of alcohol, burnt malt and coffee. Milky too. Oaky vanilla. Tastes kind of like those little chocolate bottles filled with liquor. Rich malt and some alcochol burn in the finish. Creamy mouth and smoky on the back of the throat that lingers. A sipper to be sure but very good. Could stand a little aging and I'll bet it would age very well."
"Wow, what a beer. I couldn't drink too many of these in one sitting, definitely a sipper, however, it was calling my name long after it was gone. Amazing."
"The mouthfeel is thick, rich, full-bodied, and creamy. The beer has a very long finish with its burnt, roasted character swirling around the mouth long after it has been swallowed. It is definitely alcohol forward right now. Good for sipping, has a big warming effect.The drinkability will definitely improve with age. This could easily be part of the Vertical Epic series, I don't doubt at all that it will hold up that long."
"This was quite possibly the greatest Imperial Stout I've ever had. Dark, rich, it was a treat to drink this. It poured black, witha brown head that laced as I drank it down. The aromas were so complex I don't really know where to start. There was Cherry, oak, chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, and many more. The flavor was just as complex. It reminded me of a nice bourdeux, with lots of chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, vanilla, cherries. The mouthfeel was silky smooth, and glorious. I can't say anymore other than wow."
"overall: As a relatively inexperienced BA, this beer seems to fit PERFECTLY within it's style. This is a wonderful treat. A dessert unto itself. If you are a fan of big beers, you MUST try this."
"Overall: Very solid IRS from stout. There's still a few in my book that are better, but very good nonethless."
"I will re-review this if I've found today was just an off day. I'm surprised I'm not giving this at least a 4, but it just isn't cutting it per my tastes."
"overall: for the longest time north coast's old rasputin has been my favorite RIS, but this years RIS by stone is a little bit better. appearance and drinkability are the only things that bring it down. i've yet to drink a better russian imperial stout."
"I like this beer. It has a good, strong taste that isn't characteristic of normal stouts. It has a beautiful appearance and incredible mouthfeel. It is incredibly dynamic as the flavors change while the beer warms. On the downside, it is a little hard to drink - this is definitely a meal in itself. I think the taste definitely improved as the beer warmed up, though towards the end the alcohol got a little strong. If it weren't for that and the quickly dissippating nose, I would have given this a very high score. Overall, however, a very good beer."
"Black...opaque, with a minimal head by the time it arrived. Firm ring of foam atop the brew. The nose lacked the complexity that I was expecting, some coffee, a little licorice. But the taste...semi-sweet chocolate start, bitter coffee, anise and hops, all working together and standing apart. Where was all of this in the nose? Mouthfeel is oily, full and the finish is marathon length. All the flavors reappear and linger long after the swallow. Find it. Drink it. Enjoy."
"Stellar RIS! Kudos to Stone. Certainly a beer to look forward to each year."
"Amazing texture! Silky but with so much flavor as it runs by. Smooth but biting somehow...great for such a strong and dark brew. Deserves its place among the top 10."
"Taste was Oh OH sooo good...The best imperial stout I've ever tasted. while the only slight ding could be in appearance ( I personally loved the appearance but to some it may be a bit lacking in (head/retention) Syrup mouthfeel is perfect for a big stout and alcohol warming is off the charts nothing overbearing and well hidden but wow a nice cheek warming drink. God DAMN!!! every once in a while a beer is so good all I can do is cuss and emberass myself with excitement. Hey its an Imperial and lets you know all along the way. Loved this beer...Greatness from STONE."
"Overall, very good, but watch out for the alcohol- not to be taken lightly, comrade!"
"Entry is silky smooth, getting support from a perfect level of carbonation. The deeply roasted malts lead headlong into the midtaste, quickly followed by layer after silky layer of chocolate covered fruits, molasses, and toffee. The finish is ushered in by a fast appearing wall of hoppiness which quickly disperses into a beautiful, alchohol-warming, slow malt fade which warms both the throat and the heart..."
"This review pertains to the limited edition 2005 early summer release. Black as night with a malted milk head that faded fairly fast. Some small smatterings of lacing were evident. It poured a thick almost motor oil like consistency. Aroma was of dark fruits, raisins, plums, and some roastiness. Alcohol in strong evidence. Taste was superb, one to sip, with all the above mentioned aromas figuring strongly as well in the taste profile. Thick and rich on the palate, with some chocolate notes I may add. This kicks your butt folks, I went right to bed after I had my bottle. More appropriate for a cold winter night but thankfully I had a coolish summer night to try it on. A very decadent big big beer."
"Strongly recommended."
"Malty but not too sweet, hops are there for a bit of a bitter finish, but definitely not a stand out characteristic. Warmed me all over. If I could give it a 4.995 I would, because I can't wait to taste this after I cellar it for a few years."
"Drinkability: What can I say. If I could buy ten cases I would."
"Wow a veritable monster but worth drinking, though Im thinking maybe a 16 oz bottle would have been better for me..ah next time I will drink with a friend!"
"Quite drinkable, and a first-class effort all around."
"Stone's Imperial Russian Stout is always at the epidome of what the style represents. With ultimate maltiness and supportive roast and complexities, it's amazing how effortless the beer seems at it's rudimentary levels, but how complex and succulent it becomes the more you delve into it's individual and unique flavors."
"I would love to have this beer again, one of the best Imperial stouts, in my opinion."
"Go try it for yourself!"
"I pop open the cap and watch as wisps of steam furtively escape the chilly interior, like moaning spirits reaching towards the sky. Pouring forth from this dark bottle comes a fluid so deep, thick, and syrupy that pancakes are suddenly my deepest desire. The rocky, off-white head taunts me. I lift my glass to my nose, and am overtaken by a sweet caramel aroma, with hints of licorice, and sweet caramel. Visions of hop flowers enter my brain as I realize that the earthy character of this brew is more than palpable. The taste, where to begin? Hoppiness to the extreme, but a deep, burnt, chocolatey undertone hits me where it hurts the most: my palate. Undaunted, I realize that the complexities of this beer are too much to handle. I find many hints and flavors, all intermingling and forming a cacophony of sinful flavor in this hearty brew. Sip upon sip reveals nuances that had previously remained hidden. The balance between the hops and malts are striking, but just because there is balance does not mean that neither is too extreme. Both are in your face, both hit you like a ton of bricks, and both can decimate the palate if one does not respect this mighty beer. Smoothly it finishes, and is surprisingly easy to drink. And just as easily as it was poured, it finishes, and my liver has a long night ahead of it."
"Drinkability is quite high, but I couldn't rate it at perfect due to the fact that 1 22 oz is not enough, but 2 seems to be almost too much at times. I think this is my favorite brew at the moment, but unfortunately it is not distributed here."
"Jet black with a very thin and short-lived milk chocolate head. Bitter roasted malt aroma, sweet caramel and milk chocolate; slighlty smoky and acrid. Some very subtle citric hops, a hint of coffee and a little alcohol. Almost sugary sweet like a milk stout. Hugely complex and intrigueing. Tastes of roast bitterness followed by that sugary sweetness that is evident in the nose. I absolutely love it. Sort of marshmallowy. Some acrid bitterness in the finish, along with some resinous hops. Very warming and alcoholic. This beer is a mouthfull, creamy and very thick. Mouthcoating is the word. Dangerously drinkable, this beer should have a warning lable."
"Bomber obtained from Liquor Mart (Boulder) in 2004 and consumed in June 2005. Pours a dandy brown two-finger head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of roast, chocolate, molasses, and alcohol. Tastes divine. Wow this is incredible. Starts sweet smooth molasses chocolatey before Ghengis Khan drives 1,000 screaming roasted barley grains through my mouth and down my throat. A detectable alcohol lays beneath these flavors and becomes more prevalent in the aftertaste. Super thick creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Further tastes reveal a great depth in the molasses flavor. Wet sweet to start with some fruits, but they are hard to identify before the roast appears. Plums or prunes and some licorice, too. The roast is dry and contrast with the malt in a nice power struggle. In the end, roast dry does win out, but the malt sweet hasn't completely given up the ghost. It's for this reason that I never became tired of this beer. I can't tell if I'm attributing some hop bitter to the roast character or not. If there are any hops here, they have settled. This is one fabulous beer. Many desirable flavors coming and going in an easy and well-blended flow."
"Even in 2013, this is my favorite Imperial Stout!!! That is eight years now."
"spring 2003 edition. Bottled, bomber. Poured a dense black viscous ale into the pint glass with a rich chocolate cap that settles to a lacing ring. Thick prune, fig and sweet capuccino tones to the nose. Rich silky body permeated with the standard Impy tastes...deep chewy dried fruit tastes, cocoa/coffee tones. Light hop presense ( many be a result of the aging). Finish give the licorice impression that the alcohol turns to a light salty taste. A good standard Imperial but certainly over rated as there are many equally good, or better, Imp stouts about."
"I just couldn't drink this every day, maybe not even once a month, I definitely cannot drink another beer tonight."
"No head to speak of, just a light rim around the circumference of the glass. Mocha/java in appearance; nice, inky black. Impressive whisky and molasses bouquet, quite sweet, like an understated WWS. Deep flavor profile topped by some burnt umber notes, hickory, Chinese five-spice heat, black pepper, orange rind, and a dash of soy. Given the high alcohol, this was a surprisingly smooth libation. Time to store one away for a while."
"Thick and ebony in colour, this is an imposing beer. The smell was old chocolate and vinous notes swirling around the back. The taste was unexpected as instead of big hops and malts I got a fantastic melange of aged chocolate, wine, hops and fruit. The last time I had a beer this well constructed it was a Westy 8. I love Rogue and North Coast's take on this style but I must say that Stone have created something quite sublime and full of the brewers soul."
"Drinkability - perhaps the most drinkable 10%+ beer I've ever had."
"22 ounce bottle. 2004 early summer release. The head must have been impaired by the alcohol content of the beer. The alcohol also lowers the drinkability slightly."
"I couldn't think of a better way to sum up this stout than an excerpt from the bottle: ""It almost seems evil."""
"Bravo!"
"Overall this rates highly with exceptional drinkability. Due to its heavy hitting nature resulting in a slow sipping intake, I suggest a nice cigar accompany this one to bring out the best in both. Take the two in on the back porch with a friend and a debate of philosophy, theology, and politics and you have a glorious night...just remember that drinking this Russian doesn't mean that you aren't a good red blooded American even if commy's come up in the debate."
"Pours with a nice thick soapy brown head. It's dark as night and beautiful. Smells very sweet with little alcohol smell. Has a very thick, very smooth mouthfeel, with a rich chocolate taste. You would never know that this one is 9.7%. Very drinkable!!!"
"Purchased this while on vacation in Memphis. The color is black, head is medium brown and creamy. Head is very good considering the 10.8% ABV. The aroma is of rich, dark chocolate with slight whiffs of alcohol and roasted coffee. The taste is quite simply amazing. Rich and complex dark chocolate flavor is ruling my world here. Alcohol flavor is noted in the finish. A light roasted taste rounds this out. Another great thing about this beer is that considering the extremely full flavor and high alcohol content, Stone Imperial Russian Stout is amazingly drinkable. This is a beer that every fan needs to get their hands on. I haven't finished my bomber yet and I'm already mad that I can't get more locally. Note to Stone Brewing: Please, please, please bring your full product line to Texas."
"Drinkability/notes: Superb and very drinkable, an excellent cold weather beer."
"A gigantic imperial stout. There's no mistaking the alcohol in this beast, but it's well-balanced and nicely warming on a long and cold winter night."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have the undisputed champion of my taste buds. Its an eloquent sipper. Sit back and enjoy."
"Drinkability: A wonderfully rich and powerful stout but it's one and done"
"Pours a one-finger brown head that quickly fades leaving traces of lace. Black opaque color. Nice, beefy full bodied. Sweet roasty coffee/chocolate nose. Starts sweet, finishes with some alcohol overtones and there is a slight burnt chocolate aftertaste. $6 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Deep brown to black color with a nice thick brown head. The head recedes to a nice sheet of lace on the glass as I write this. The aroma is heavy with chocolate and roasted malt notes. There is just a mild hint of citrus hops on the finish. More chocolate notes up front in the flavor. The roasted malt comes across too along with a bigger, brighter hop flavor than I expected. There are layers of flavor in this beer, and the layers come together nicely in the finish. Rich, velvety smooth mouth feel and a high drinkability. One of the best of this style Ive had the pleasure to try."
" I found I enjoyed this Imperial more-so than even the porter. IMO"
"A slight alchol burn in the finish, but a kick ass beer. One of my favorites now for sure. Too bad I cant get it here. And you need to be careful - this shit will fuck you up."
"Notes: Very tasty. Even though the alcohol content is very high, it surprisingly doesn't have the burning solventy alcohol taste, but it is very strong in the taste. Definitely a slow drinking beer."
"02/26/08--trying again and all the things I said before still apply now. Cant say its improved much but it didnt need much improving.I think the alcohol heat is a little more noticeable than it was last time I tried this but the bottom line is this is one fine beer."
"I had this off tap a while back and didn't write notes on it, so I'll see what it does out of a bottle. This one comes out black as night with a small tan head sitting atop the viscous looking fluid. The nose is huge. Full of big dark fruity tones, chocolate and hints of black licorice. Wow. The flavor is a blast of alcohol soaked chocolate followed some figgy notes, finishing slightly coffee. I think I am in love. This is great, but it remember the tap being even better. The feel is huge thickness, almost a syrupy residue on the tongue after swallowing. Drinkability is not bad at all for a big ass beer that is thick anc big on flavor. Stone, you do good work. I kick myself for not grabbing a few of these when they came out. Thanks to clvand0 for sharing his spoils with me so I could get some pen ot paper on it."
"Late 2003 release. Black as night. Pours beautiful with a nice head that quickly vanishes. Unfortunately, I couldn't smell much, but I could definately taste. Great, thick chocolate taste, with a thick, slimy mouthfeel. Sticky lips, slight alcohol burn, happy feeling! I wish I had another."
"Mouthfeel: It feels thick and creamy, a solid imperial stout. I would love to try this on a draft."
"Smooth, creamy, huge mouthfeel...it doesn't get any better than this! Velvety smooth. Drinkability is hindered slightly by the big ABV, otherwise this is an awesome brew to have on a cold night..wonderfully crafted and will warm ya up nicely. 100% recommended. Thanks to kmpitz2 and ppoitras for hooking me up with yet another amazing Stone brew!"
"GClarkage.. I am in your debt for this one."
"This is without a doubt, the best, and most drinkable RIS I've ever had the pleasure to encounter."
"Drinkability: So amazing that I was in a constant battle with myself over whether or not I should keep taking massive gulps or sip it quietly. It's the kind of beer that grabs your attention and blocks out the rest of the world for you. I had but bottle and now it's gone. I want to cry."
"Drinkability- Brutally drinkable! This may be my highest rating to date. From the first sip I didn't want it to end. Too bad I had to share a 22 oz bomber with two other people. Only 8 oz at the most for poor me :( The alcohol comes through pretty hard at the end. Already noticing a tinge of buzz after my 8oz. Fricking phenomanal beer. Like drinking a smores with a cup of coffee. But minus the marshmallow and plus the buzz. Sounds good to me."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Silky smooth, with a huge body. Amazing drinkability for an impy stout. I could drink this in volumes, although I'd be hurting the next day."
"Enjoy! Highly Recommended!"
"Pours black as coal under a 1.5 finger burgundy head that lingers forever, with good thick lacing. A beauty to behold. The nose is treated to strong roasted malt sensations, while the mouth is mildly carbonated with a very thick body. Luscious. There is lots of roasted malt flavor, with good hops backing leaving a pronounced dry impression. There's sweet caramel here, too, but it is quickly blown away by the smokey nut and dark chocolate, which in turn yields to espresso. Ideal blend of bitter and sweet in the aftertaste. This is a truly great stout."
"Sweet black velvet, this sis some 70's freakshow exploitive brew. The very dreams of my gluttonous taste buds seem to have been given form. Stone Imp. Russian Stout pours an opaque onyx. It's delightfully thick, with a textured but continuous velvet feel. The aroma is mild but complex, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt notes. The layered flavors in this brew are delightful. There's a sharp citrus hop spice to balance the incredible chocolate sweetness. Coffee and burnt malt notes contribute favorably. I'm not sure where stone hid that 10+ ABV. the slight alcohol in the finish is remarkably subtle. Now, I wouldn't call it a summer brew, but the early release encourages some aging and mellowing. I can't wait to see what a year or two will do to this brew."
"Deep, dark, blackness with a light rim of head that clings to the glass after pouring. light aromas of dark roasted chocolate and malt. flavors include chocolate, raisin, and a deeply roasted grain, with the chocolate gaining ground as it warms a bit. Slightly alcoholic in the finish, but not objectionably so. This is a thick beer, clinging to the tounge lest you forget about it. It's going quite well with the brownies we're enjoying with it - altogether a fine beer and perhaps the beer equivalent of hot chocolate for a cool winter day."
"Had this on tap at Dilly Deli in Cincinnati, OH. This beer pours the darkest of dark with a thick brown head and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. The aroma is extremely malty - a good blend of the coffee/roasted and the chocolate. Pours like motor oil, but thick, dirty motor oil. This is one thick beer! The flavor is extremely malty. Roasted malts and chocolate everywhere. Goes down smooth with a slight alcoholic burn that is overwhealmed by the thickness of the beer. Mouthfeel is huge! Drinkability is harsh at first, but becomes great."
"On-Tap at the Sunset Grill. This stuff is nearly opaque black with bloody red edges and a head of deep brown foam. This is a beautiful looking beer that should be served in a nice tulip glass or snifter. The aroma of this brew is intense and consists of black kurrants, chocolate, espresso, alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and more! The taste is an explosion of dark roasted malts, chocolate, strong coffee, liquor, and more. The mouthfeel is very thick and coating, and the drinkability is damn good as well."
"This is an awesome beer. Pours out darker than Martha Stewarts heart. Minimal head, just enough to lace the glass with it's passing. A huge roasted malt smell is the first thing to assault the nose, followed by a expresso/ coffee scent. Very nice. Yes, there is a big taste of alcohol, with just a little sweetness thrown in with the malted goodness. Raisins and plums provide a nice tartness that rounds out the flavor extravanganza. This is beer that demands you to pay attention to it. Raw around the edges, perfection just may lie within. It can only get better with age, as far as I'm concerned. Best consumed while writing angry letters to the government, or penning your manifesto."
"Early Summer 2004 Release. I am sitting on a cool rainy day and thought this would be a great day to try my first 22 oz bottle of Stone Imperial Russian Stout. This beer poured out a sweet black color with a nice brownish head. The smell is heavy with roasted malt and hints of the strong alcohol. The first taste is a perfect follow-up to the appearance and smell; roasted malt, warming alcohol, heavy chocolate and java overtones. This is great sipping beer to cap off any day. This is not the beer I would normally drink on a daily basis, but one that I would seek out again for a good occasion. (Everyday is a good occasion now that I think about it) As I near the bottom of the glass, I can now say this is a beer that demands some respect. Think abv."
"Not my beer style at all...but I must say I was impressed by this one. Yes, that 10.8% never fully goes away...it's a constant presence and certainly demands respect. Pour when served was the color of black gold. The coffee crema style head was a nice touch, and lasted through-out the glass. Aroma wise, the roasted notes were the most apparaent (think java), but I also picked up some plums as well. Mouthfeel wasn't quite over the top full, but definitely chewy. Tastewise, the hot alcohol kept one in check while admiring the roasted java meets tootsie roll in the taste. Very good, well made, but damn dangerous at that abv."
"Black. It is black in the middle and around the edges. Even when I held it to a light there was no penetrating the dense liquid. Impressive. The head was a lovely brunette color. At the apex the tightly compacted bubbles reached about a half finger in height. The head retention was respectable; it faded to a skimpy cap, kind of naked in the middle with a bubbly collar. In my goblet this beer does look damn imposing. There was no subsequent lacing, which can be expected I suppose. Still it is a good-looking beer. The first sniff of the nose was a massive explosion of malty goodness. I set the glass down and exhaled. Ah, Imperial Stout. Only a prodigious stout could be so malty. I went back for more. Raw alcohol, completely unabashed, it is forceful and hot. Did Avery brew this? Thankfully there are *enough* ripe, dark, and tropical fruits to play with the heat for a while anyway. Continually smelling the beer after I poured it from the bomber, wore my tolerance of the booze smells thin. If the alcohol had a more complex aroma then, say, rubbing alcohol I might I have been more inclined. By the finish the beer returns to a chewy, sweet, coffee and chocolaty array of olfactory pleasing aromas. Random hints of burnt caramel. Plums. There is also just a tickle of sugar. Potency is bold enough, I want my big beers to scream; this one talks very loudly. Inviting even with the rubbing alcohol smells. The palate is warm and damn yummy. There is excellent depth. Sometimes alcohol heat detracts from the overall enjoyment of a beer. Rarely does a raw burn add welcoming effects. In this case the alcohol works, the heat adds depth to the flavors. Also it acts like a connective tendon between the muscular malt and the delicate fruit. I guess calling the fruit delicate is a bit of an understatement as it does come across dark and tropical with plums, raisins, peaches, and even some apples. Random spiciness. The meat and potatoes of this beer are the malts. Big, chewy, evil, tastes like coffee (spiked with brandy), chocolate that is semi-sweet, kind of chalky. I have nothing to complain about with the palate it is charming in an angry kind of way. Not perfect but very good. Imperial stouts should be bold. This one is. A little too raw? Id buy that. Still, it is very tasty, very complex but its lacking a little magic I think. Id like a little more roast, more char, and less warmth. Full/medium-full in body, amazingly creamy, silky mouthfeel. It is like swallowing liquid velvet. Low carbonation but it is fitting for this beer. I really like the mouthfeel. Maybe it could be a tickler fuller (I guess I want to drink motor oil) and a little less hot. But the absolute smoothness cant be ignored. It is drinkable, it needs to be sipped and savored. A tickle too raw maybe a theme is developing here. It is a very good Imperial Stout. Not perfection, though. More malt depth and less alcohol would be ideal. This beer makes me want to eat grilled meat and hearty cheese! I need to send a huge Thank You to meathookjones for sending me this long sought after beer. A damn good nightcap ZZZ I dont feel the need to hurry back and drink this one again"
"thanks"
"A spectacular RIS, perfect for any occasion and makes a great night cap."
"I'm a big fan of Imperials so of course I still like it, and it's still a good beer, but I am going to have to get a few more bottles for comparison. Maybe it's me, but I know Stone...they are an amazing brewery, which makes me think they can produce an amazing Imperial Stout. This is good, but it falls short of amazing."
"I find it interesting that Stone releases a beer I would think of as a winter warmer in early summer. And while this beer certainly can be laid down, I see no need to. It's ready to drink now!"
"Drinkability: surprisingly good for such a strong beer."
"This is a mighty fine stout. It pours a deep black, with beautiful brown foamy head. The smell is of sweet roasted malts. The taste carries on the malty wonder of the smell, nice roasted malts. A warm full and smooth mouthfeel. This is a very tasty stout and there is really no hint of the high ABV in either the aroma or taste. Definitely a beer to be searched out and enjoyed."
"Drinkability: I don't really know how many of these things I could drink repeatedly, as this gem clocks in at 10.8% alcohol by volume. Although not the infinitely drinkable yet amazingly delicious perfection that defines Stone's IPA, this brew could be consumed for a good while."
"The drinkability is fantastic, I got the bottom of the glance and imediatly wanted more. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is that I can't get it on a regular basis and now that makes me very sad because I want another."
"This beer pours a nice thick syrupy black liquid that almost sticks to the glass as you pour it. I know Im in for a treat when I finally get to drink this. The flavor dosent dissappoint, it is very powerful wich much more of a malt tone than I expected from Stone given their other beers. The hops are well prononunced yet not overly powerful like in Arrogant bastard. All in all a very nice beer, but I doubt many people could handle this as a session beer it would just overwhelm you."
"Pours a thick black with a decent sized coffee brown head. minimal lacing. Veiwed from above it took on an almost port-like apperance (dark with a clear layer on top) Aroma was dark fruit(prune,plum) coffee, liquorice, alcohol. flavor was rich, thick coffee (espresso) unsweetend chocolate, with a touch of bitter/sweetness in the finish. I hope there is still a bottle left at the store, because this is one for the cellar"
"The simplest description that comes to mind is a perfect cross between Victory's Storm King and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout -- two personal favorites in the style. A nearly perfect imperial stout that leaves you in awe of what can be accomplished with malt, hops, yeast, water, and talent. Thanks yet again, Stone!"
"Poured a jet black brew with a moderate off white head that dissipated after about one minute. The aroma was clean without having any defects but it was hard to pick up much except a little roasted barley and alcohol. The taste was very nice as the rich malty sweetness was balanced very well with the sharp contrast of the roasted grains. The hops made a brief appearance right before being run over by a warm alcohol and then finishing clean with a touch of roasted flavor lingering. Very drinkable though not a session beer as one bomber is enough to get a nice buzz."
"thick but entirely drinkable. I better like it, because it comes in a big bottle! (and I do like it)"
"Excellent, one of the best stouts around and aging quite nicely."
"Overall it is a really good Russian imperial stout. Stone is once again amazing! This beer is really worth the price"
"Impressive and insanely drinkable. Where did those 22 ounces just go? I want more."
"Spongy, dark brown colored head left strings of lace. Strong aroma consisting mostly of chocolate and raisins. Matte black looking beer. Flavors of bitter chocolate, coffee, a bit of marshmallow, creamy alcohol, and raisin. A thick chewy beer that's just right."
"pours almost no head,with VERY BLACK apperance.not much carbonation,and has a little syrupy taste to it.for serious imperial stout lovers only."
"Pretty drinkable for such a big beer, but awfully bitter after a couple sips. Woudl like something a little smoother."
"NOTE: A few years since the first review. I have since tried many imperial stouts. This one came across as a little dry and not as dynamic as I first thought."
"Taste? Very very complex, typical like a stout but not with the heavy alcoholic taste like most imperials. This beer was warm , tasty, complex and will be a fave for wintery nights if I can find this in Cleveland."
"Big beer, a sipper not a pounder, took me about an hour and a half to finish this. Wonderful"
"Pours a very dark, chocolate brown, with a frothy brown head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of fruity currants and malty sweetness. Taste is unique for an imperial stout. Very fruity, with undertones of coffee, malt, and cinnamon. Alcohol has an impact on the aftertaste, and burns the throat slightly. A very unusual imperial stout because of the fruity, spicy elements."
"The early summer 04 edition. Black as night with a coffee colored head. Not a whole lot in the way of retention or lacing. Heavy hanging licorice and charcoal smell. Taste is huge gobs of fruity fig, choclate and ash. There is nothing you can do but submit. Epic is an understatement. Finishes with that ever so subtle astringet burn. I'm floored. If this can't fill your palate try lighter fluid. Suprisingly drinkable for a young, strong, beer with high ABV. My other bottle is going underground for a few years.They should rename this stuff Hammer because it's like drinking steel."
"First time sampling this stout and I got ahold of the 2004 edition at a local store. As I was pour this I was able to anticipate the creamy mouthfeel as it felt I was pouring oil into my pint. Appearance is black as night with a medium sized tan head. Nose has a bit of alcohol which was preceded by notes of chocolate and coffee... mmm... roasted malts. Taste is simply wonderful, lots of chocolate and slight bitterness. A slight sensation of alcohol follows but it is pleasant and warming, not strong at all. Mouthfeel is gloriously thick. Drinkability is decent for a brew of this strength. All and all I think i might have a new favorite Imperial Stout. I will definately try to stock up on this one for the comming winter."
"All in all, a very good beer, I'd rather have an expedition though."
"Drinkability: Excellent tasting beer that is a bit big to enjoy that many in a row but is wonderful Imperial Stout."
"Late Spring 2003, Bogartski while you can, 9.47% ABV edition. Pours opaquely deepest brown to black with a medium brown head that fades into thin lacing. French roast coffee, scorched malt, dark fruit, toffee, raisin, black strap molasses and a big alcohol punch prevalent in the nose. Throw a lot of hops in there, too, but they're trying to keep their head above water like a mafia victim with concrete shoes that gets lost in the riptide. Malty, floral and sweet, with residual flavors complementary to that of almost any stereotypical dark ale; coffee, chocolate, dark, plummy fruits. But this monster does have some leafy and grassy hops manage to poke its head out like a prarie dog seeing if the coast is clear. Oops, the coast isn't clear, here comes the black patent malt monster. There's a mineral and salty background, not unlike Le Coq. All things considered, this has to be the finest imperial stout from the U.S. I've ever had, and I've had it a good number of times before I got around to reviewing it."
"This is a serious, forcefull, thick-bodied beer that's an amazing experience in itself."
"Drinkability isn't as good as Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout but it is good."
"This is a delicious IRS. I only got one bottle but next time I'll grab a few so I can see how it ages. Top 5 of all the beers I've had."
"I think that the fact that a beverage this dark, flavorful and complex and another beverage so light and flavorless as Coors light are both ""beer"" (I use the term loosely in regards to coors light) is proof enough that there is more variety of flavors in beer then wine."
"Спасибо."
"Thanks to AleOha for the bottles."
"Nothing but net for Stone on this one. This is about as regal as Imperial stout gets. Benchmark beer."
"Pours black as midnight oil with no head and lacing that lines the sides of the glass before sliding down into the muck. Still, looks like it would suck up surrounding light like a black hole. Smell is alcohol and plum/raisins, kind of like a belgian strong ale. I think I would have expected more of the roastiness to come through, but it's partly because of the taste. The taste is bitter, roasty sourness. My roommate *hated* this one, leaving me to drink the entire 22 by my poor little self. Awww. An initial taste of maple syrup giving way to a bourbon-like bite lessening to this sour bitterness of roasted malt and ending with a coffee finish on the tongue lingering and lingering and lingering. Until the next sip where you get to experience it all over again. This is one huge massive beer. Mouthfeel is thick and juicy with the beer being almost flat, you would think it was cask right out of the bottle. Geez. I guess I have to get a case of this for the next year and bust it out for special or not-so-special occasions. Mmmm..."
"Sweet. Very sweet, brown sugar sweet. The fruits in this one are quite ripe. Pungent, full, huge! Exciting. This stout is exciting to drink! Dark fruit lingers for eternity. The alcohol presents is noticed and greatly appreciated. Hops? This stone we're talking about, of course there's hops! I had a great time enjoying this beer."
"John"
"Pours a jet black like motor oil I held it up to a pretty bright light and nothing shined thru a bit of a mocha colored head settled nicely on top perfect.Hops in a imperial stout well this one has a big dose that come thru in the aroma with some cocoa powder and deeply roasted malt.Big complexities going on in the flavor department roasted coffee followed by a medicinal quality a touch of smoke and hop dryness in the finish.A beer that lives up to the billing big bold and beautiful man what a beer!"
"Drinkability: Fine. This one, if not for the limited release and price, could be enjoyed all year long. Not heavy or bold like some others. Goes down easy and is satisying. I wouldn't bother cellaring. It's not like anything is out of control and needs time to refine."
"An apparently simple beer with complex undertones with a nicely balanced combination of intensity and subtleness. A well crafted brew."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy light brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black malt and chocolate scent with a dry alcohol driven aroma! The taste is great. It has an intense black malt flavor with a dry warm finish. It goes down smooth and leaves a black malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Russian Imperial Stout. It has good aroma and better flavor; a good drinker."
"This is a thick beer and feels smooth in the mouth. I tried to have a second, and that was my downfall. This is not a beer to quaff all night."
"Still a great beer. The alcohol has been ratcheted up a point and a half, and the hops seem a bit more assertive than in 02. Also, there seems to be a more noticeable roasted malt character. All in all, this lends a bit more balance to the brew, but without detracting from it's big bruiser status. Yummy."
"Kudos to Stone Brewing on another impressive brew! They just never seem to fail to impress with anything that I have tried from them!"
"Poured pitch balck with a burgundy tinge. There was no head, and this beer was so smooth that there was no lace on the glass either. There were very strong flavors of chocolate, coffe and hazelnut. So strong this beer was almost stifling rich and hearty. The finish is a waft of hazelnut coffee. Overall, a very smooth drink."
"Had a pint of this at the Grey Lodge. Poured dark as night and was topped with one of the darkest heads I have ever seen, Looked like worn and dark leather brown. Sour licorice nose with deep and dark roasted chocolate notes. I detected some ammonia-like alcohol in there, which brought my aroma rating down a bit. Complex, burnt and rich. The taste is strong and very rich, with sweet molasses in the forefront and a small roasted bitter bite towards the finish. Theres touches of seared caramelized fruits in there, too. A very bold beer. Definitely worth a try. And for me, definitely worth a revisit in the future."
"Final Thought: This is the second strong beer I've had that has been too heavy, and really shouldn't be classified as a beer. I'll try it again but as of now I prefer Victory Storm King and Great Lakes Blackout over this any day..."
"This is only the second Russian Imperial I've had, Rasputin being the other. An intriguing style, one that seems to lend itself to dark, cold winter night even more so than regular stout. I'll be back in the store buying another one for the sake of storing it."
"Dammit this is good stout! Not quite Storm King, but the beer reviews have it dead on as a close second. A very black stout, sweet, good malt, warming with the alcohol. A great winter beverage, but not the most drinkable. One 22 ounce bottle is plenty for me!"
"Intense. Extremely thick, heavy, alcoholic mouthfeel. Not as roasty as i would have liked, some vanilla, and toasty/roasty/choc, quite citric and extremely hoppy, hop bitter. In fact the malts play a secondary role to the intensity of the hops, hops are quite citric/acidic/bitter. To be honest felt a little out of place for me, especially when mixed with the vanillin/choc malts, some vegetable stock and spice in there aswell. Very intense, and lots going on. Not quite my style, but cheers to Greg from Stone for giving me this opportunity to try it, Greg is an absolute legend."
"Body is thick, viscous, oily with dry chocolate tones dominating and cutting through with a bright hoppy bite in the finish accentuated by a roast and alcohol slap."
"A nice stout, the first imperial i've had but a little too sweet for my liking, i cant imagine getting this again (since it'd be a 10000 mile trip), made fantastic pork and apple sausages though"
"On tap at BT in NYC, sheesh, Stone is just crushing folks at the Tiger this week! Their I.S. hardly seemed like the appropriate brew for a warm summer night in the big town, but this one had to be tried and enjoyed. Poured black and gooey with a solid dark tan head. Coffee and chocolate in the nose. Body/mouthfeel is rich, thick and motor oil in feel. Big and bold flavors of roasted malt, coffee, raisins, prunes, chocolate. Finishes dry with uggodly hops. This stuff has the style nailed. Classic sipper. I imagine this stuff would age very well also."
"(2004 Edition) Just like the label says, ""Pours like Siberian Crude"" Black as the Ace of Spades, dark as midnight, literally a black hole in my Stone IRS glass. Pours with a nice two finger head, much like a good quality shot of espresso, but dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Smell is black currants, dark chocolate, anise and finishes with a medium alcohol, simply marvelous! Taste is smooth toasty malt, prunes, espresso and raisins, with a warming alcohol bite and a mild acidity. Thick, creamy, belly warming good!! I am cellaring an entire case for this winter. This is a huge complex IRS that makes me feel truly ""Not Worthy"""
"An amazing stout!!! Pours out like crankcase oil, tastes like ambrosia. A full creamy head on a black coffee brew, with nice sticky lacing. An aroma of Arabica roasted coffee, raisin and molasses and a hint of the absolutley decadent 10.8% ABV hits your nose. With all the syrupy viscosity of cough syrup, (but none of the taste of cough syrup!) The body is solid with malt, and plenty of carbonation. The initial taste is a sweet maltiness backed by prune, and a molasses/caramel flavor that washes cleanly off your tongue. Toasted grain, coffee and dark chocolate prevails. The hops are so subtle as to be almost missed, but they are there. This stout will keep your taste buds guessing and fully engaged. Nothing dominates, all is in perfect harmony. The mouth is left with a taste that says, ""Please, Sir. I'd like some more!"""
"Best Stout I have ever had, hands down. Have had this 2003 bottle cellared for exactly one year. Pours a dark motor oil black with the darkest head I have ever seen, brown/tannish with dark black hues. Lacing sticks to the glass like it is possesed. Head not as thick as most stouts however. The smell is a sweet caramel/molasses with mocha beans. Hints of irish roasted coffee and toffee. Small tone of bananna as well. The taste was rich and full of mocha. The roasted malts was mixed with the powerful alcohol to create a monster. This is overpowering, but not to the point where it is undrinkable. A very full bodied stout, this stout is dangerous because you can drink alot because so good but I don't recommend it, it will mess you up. Pray to the gargoyle, for it will haunt you in your dreams."
"Only knock may be the drinkability. This is a beer that can kick your ass if your not careful, and while i love that about it, not everybody can be a fan of that."
"Thick, rich, big, and sinfully drinkable. Old baseball glove leather and pipe tobacco emerge at the finish to contribute to the immense complexity. I cellared a bottle of this, as I think a few months aging will improve the 2004 release considerably. Be careful with this gigantic imperial Russian stout. Sit down, relax, and sip. This is going to give you a buzz by the time you finish it. I was disappointed not to find any English walnut nuttiness here, which I prefer in any stout, but with all the other characteristics going on here, this is just a minor, personal issue. This one is going to be quite an experience to enjoy after a few months in the cellar."
"This is a big stout! The intial appearance is used motor oil black. This stuff pours thicker than any beer I've seen, although I'm no seasoned pro so there may be beers that are thicker. The head is brown, the beer is black. The smell is like coffe/chocolate/mocha, but that big 10.8% comes through also. The taste is good. It leaves a sweet/bitter taste on the back of my tongue after the first drink, and that taste remains for quite some time. The mouthfeel is thick, as I presumed it would be by the consistency of the beer. When tried with sweets a certain mocha/coffe flavor hits my palate strong. They didn't mask the alcohol content very well with this, but that would be my only complaint. The beer is made for sipping with desserts (I tried mine with a nice, warm cinammon roll). Watch out, this beer with creep up on you. Overall a pretty good stout."
"22oz bomb from the 2004 batch. As I was pouring this I was reminded that my car needs an oil change. Wow this is thick stuff, and about as dark and opaque as a beer can get. An excellent dark tan/brown head arose from the snifter as this was poured and stuck around for a bit before leaving a lace as is dropped to a bubbly ring around the beer. First smells that hit me were the bittersweet dark chocolate and the roasted coffee. After that notes of fruits and a touch of alcohol could be found. The taste begins with a bit of sweetness followed by the chocolate and roasted coffee. You get hit with the alcohol around the middle of the taste but not in a negative way and some fruity flavors as well. A nice bitter finish and this one lingers around a bit in your mouth well after you drink it. Mouthfeel is HUGE, a small sip seems to fill the mouth and it is so rich and creamy feeling. This goes down extremely easy for the alcohol and overall hugeness of the brew. Awesome brew I couldnt be more pleased with the high expectations I had, highly recommended."
"Overall I am VERY pleased with my first Imperial Stout experience. I am glad I grabbed a couple of these to cellar and/or drink at will it will be hard to hang on to them, but Id like to see how one develops in a year or so."
"All in all, I can't imagine how one could improve upon this beer, other than to make it a year-round, and have more cases cross the Rockies."
"Did I say that this is damn tasty? It is quite smooth, and just slides viscously down my throat, coating my entire mouth with lingering flavors that refuse to dissipate entirely. I take another sip and the process begins anew. The middle of this beer is laden with smooth dark malt flavors, but the burnt/ roast character of this beer really only hits you at the very end. As this beer slowly disappears and as it continues to warm up, it just gets better and better. This beer is awesome right now; I am definitely going to have to age quite a few of the 2004 vintage."
"2001 edition. Well, I've been rash enough in the past to scoff at Stone's beers, and the imperial stout style, deeming both of them as not-quite-worthy of all the heaping praise bestowed upon them. With this 3-year-old Stone Imp. Stout (Russian was on the label at that point), I am eating my words, or should I say, drinking them. And they're delicious. It pours a dark, dark brown (just shy of black) with the smallest head, belying the alcohol content. Brilliant aroma of chocolate and vanilla. The flavor is obviously enormous, with huge portions of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla bean. Undercurrents of smoke, spices, mocha, oak, wood, sherry, brown sugar, lightly burnt vegetables, slight anise, perhaps nutmeg, and black currants (misspelled on the bottle). Despite this bonanza of flavors, the beer managed to be somewhat mellow, and completely integrated in all aspects. None of the flavors jumped out and showboated; they all worked together as a team. However, the vanilla bean flavor was most noticeable on my palate, unexpected and supremely enjoyable. There was some lactic sourness throughout, and a big bitter coffee bite appeared towards the finish, but only for an instant. The mouthfeel was gloriously smooth, and not especially thick which surprised me. The alcohol was a big part of this beer, but perhaps from the aging it received, it was not at all out of place. The beer became thicker and stickier at room temperature. All in all, wonderful. A big thanks to HiroProtagonist for first of all, locating this marvel, and then sharing this rare, perfectly aged gem with me!"
"2003: Poured an opaque black with no head. Actually the bubbles on top, formed like a hurricane on the radar map. Strong aroma of roasted malt, dark fruit (berries?), hops, coffee, and alcohol. Initially prickly on the tongue, leads way to chocolate, coffee, roasted notes, and some hops. Very sweet, with a creamy mouthfeel. I tasted this young, and it is aging gracefully right now."
"2003 Bottle courtesy of Eyedrinkale. Pours deep brown with a tan head. Aroma of hops and chocolate. Big malty flavor, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Flavor has some hops and plenty of malt bitterness in addition to all that hop bitterness. One tasty Russian. Thanks Mike!"
"This is an ass-kicker of an Imperial stout. Carbonation: none. Pours the consistency of maple syrup. So sticky sweet and syrupy if you let it dry on the counter it will trap flies. Smells like a molasses humidifier. Complex chocolatey\fruity\coffee\roasted-malt\caramel taste with a tart hoppy bitterness and a silky-smooth mouthfeel. So thick it's almost like drinking pudding. Who put this in such a big bottle? Awesome."
"2003 bottle. Pours a deep, dark black liquid with a tan foamy, creamy head. The head stayed for a while, and there was a good amount of lace on the glass. The smell was of chocolate, coffee, and maybe some spices thrown in. Taste is rich chocolate with hints of espresso, and fruit, like plum. Good hop bitterness. You can taste the alcohol presence. This is full bodied, no debating. One of the thickest beers I have ever had. Low carbonation, which is good in this case. Overall, GIVE ME MORE NOW! No doubt, one of the best beers I have ever had. This is imperial stout at its best. I will have this whenever I can get my hands on it!"
"Aroma is extremely complex, raisins, sour cherries, caramel, burnt sugar, dark chocolate and some coffee notes are present. One of the most complex beers I have ever brought to my lips. Taste is more of the same, with the burnt sugar and raisin notes dominating and a bitter french roast coffee/bakers chocolate aftertaste. A warming alcohol feeling follows. This beer is incredibly thick - they compare it to Siberian crude on the bottle and I can't say I disagree. I think they should advertise this as the anti-Atkins - it probably has about 100g of carbs and every one of them is delicious. If I had to pick a beer to sustain me through a fast I would pick this one - it is as good a meal as I have ever eaten. Deserves every bit of praise that it has gotten."
"[Added clarification]: This brew is not available in my neck of the woods so I had to go through some effort to get it (this is why I would not seek it out). If it were available in FL, I would most probably get this one again."
"Had it in late 2006 and it was great roast and chocolate and winelike, thick and mellowed 2-year old bottle."
"cheers"
"I will definately purchase this every time I see it. If you ever want to try a beer that lives up to the hype, this is the one. A great drinking experience."
"Drinkability: Wow, this one is one of the best stouts I've tried. Great for a dessert, but not too much more."
"Without a doubt, the best imperial stout I have ever had."
"2003 Vintage: This is a dark chocolaty brown beer with light brown head. No lacing really. It had barely any carbonation. The light does not penetrate this one. If you look down into the glass, youll see the abyss. The smell was a little fruity. The taste was also a little fruity and syrupy. There was a small aftertaste of alcohol. This beer was easy to drink; it went down the throat very smoothly."
"The mouthfeel was excellent. This is what an Imperial Stout should be! The drinkability was excellent, but beware, this stuff will put you on your ass if you're not careful."
"This is one big stout."
"Yeah."
"Blind Tasting, thanks Jazz88 Black hue with almost no head, just a light brown ring. Aroma proposes a solid malt profile of dark chocolate and possibly marshmallows, perhaps a touch of salt as well. Bold grapefruity hops accompany this all. Up to now it's nothing special. In mouth, the malt profile is huge. Very full-flavoured caramel and brown sugar together with a profound grapefruity hoppiness. The difference is.. it works here, very balanced and intense at the same time. You don't realize how hoppy this is before a few sips. Mouthfeel is excellent, silky and full bodied with low carbonation. My main critics are the almost absent fruitiness and restrained roastiness. But as one who didn't particularly enjoy what he had from Stone, I was bound to recognize in a blind tasting that their imperial stout is world-class. Delicious and one of the best, as much as I hate to admit it."
"Simply an amazing beer. It actually almost reminds me of a nice german bock beer mixed with stout at times. The fresh malt flavor though reminds me of going on a brewery tour. Its really an amazing beer. A must try. I can still taste it days later."
"This beer is black. There is not a bit of light coming through. I managed to notice that the head was dark brown in the two seconds before it died to nothing. Aroma is sweet chocolate, with some roastiness. A sweet, tangy, chocolate front. A thick, sweet, dark, chocolate, syrupy, buttery middle. A nicely bitter finish, roasty, nutty, with warming alcohol. This is an excellent imperial stout: jammed with choco-syrup, buttery, roasty intensity."
"Wow this is one black stout.. I think it started sucking the light out of the room as I poured it.. Nice foamy mocha head that lingered and laced well.. The smell is of dark roasted malts and coffee. Maybe a bit of bittersweet chocolate. The taste is of coffee, caramel and a bit of brandied plums. Alcohol is barely noticeable. The Carbonation was beautiful and lended to a splendid mouthfeel. Drinkability is very high for a stout of this power.. Absolutely fantastic"
"Notes: About the pinch; This brew gave me an ""alcohol, hops, chemical, bitter"" pinch in the middle to back of the tounge. It was an interesting characteristic, however unpleasent."
"22oz Bomber: The beer has a ""thick"" consistency when it is poured. It is almost a little syrupy. Dark oily brown color. Small cocoa colored head. The aroma is multi-faceted. Molasses, coffee, chocolate, some fruits too? Taste starts out a bit sweet. Malts and chocolate are the first hits. The flavor gives way to some chocolate, coffee and a bit of bitterness. Very rich, full and complex. Wow, this is good!"
"Overall Impression: I was scared to try this, it being ranked so high (currently ranked #3). My expectations were high. God bless you BA! I don’t know how Bayesian estimates work, and I don’t care; this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Rich, complex, mellow like a good cigar. The alcohol is felt and tasted, but it fits. I’m awed by Stone’s abilities. While this is a massive beer, it’s easy to drink. If the alcohol content wouldn’t make me drool, I’d drink 3 more. Many thanks to weefishheads for the bottle."
"	-Xi"
"Believe the hype. Rich, chocolatety initial flavors - thick with an alcohol punch to remind you who are playing with. The burnt coffee initial taste gives way to a bitter chocolate aftertaste in a way that is predictable but so well done that it doesnt really matter  much like watching the godfather for the 17th time. A world class stout at a reasonable price. Life is good."
"Beef Notes: I can think of at least three imperial stouts I'd rather have, but this is still a good beer. I did expect a little more character from Stone. C'mon guys, you gotta live up to your own hype."
"The advertised abv begins to make advances as it warms."
"Oh man is this a fantastic beer. It pours a deep dark brown and has a reddish tone in direct light. It smells like coffee and chocolate and the taste is so full and think. This is smooth and creamy in the mouth and just awesome. The alcohol arrives as a kick in the throat after you've had a few sips. You'll want to drink more and more."
"so far this is one of my favorites. it goes down so smooth and the taste is incredible. find some and taste it for yourself and you will see!"
"I think I let it sit for too long, as I aged my bomber bottle at about 60F for 6 months; it thereby lost some of its punch, especially around the olfactory. I did like how the hops had calmed down so much, and how complex the taste had become - thus, next time I'll age it for 3 months. In personal taste, I'd take a Dragonslayer or Czar instead."
"Watch your breath after this one, though! People will think you've been lapping up motor oil from the parking lot. God only knows how many calories are in this bomber, but i'd guess enough to feed a small country. All in all a good stout, but not one i'd want as often as say a Shakespeare stout. But blows away Bell's 6000 - like it without the mega-hopping and wretch-inducing aftertaste."
"Give this to a Ulta-light drinker and they will actually die. This is full flavour. Not for the faint of tongue."
"Crazy. This stuff is absolutely crazy. Pours deep, black, and oily with virtually no head (a little puzzling). Aroma is of dark coffee, very sweet malts, brown sugar some dark, ripe fruits. Alcohol. Mouthfeel is extremely heavy (syruppy) and very creamy. Very light crispness at the beginning, but doesn't last long. Very sweet and malty. A very slight amount of hop bitterness, but it's hard to detect. Ends with fairly alcoholic, almost like a cough syrup. This one is almost a little too much. A very well-crafted beer, but needs to be given the proper respect."
"This one turned me off slightly at the start on the aroma due to the very dominant alcohol smell, but the flavor turned the tables. The alcohol level was much more tolerable by the tongue and was balanced in the other flavors. I will need to try this one again soon."
"""Bogartski while you can"" instructions that are printed on the lable and can be translated into: Quickly horde against all others. And horde you should as this is one special brew. Smells like a wholeshot (burnt rubber tires of a late 60's/early 70's muscle-car) laced with simple syrup and toffee and tastes like, well, it tastes dambed good! My fiancee says that ""It's different and very heavy."" I say that I like it, I like it a lot."
"Full feel and very warming, improves as it warms, probably want to drink this just a little under room temperature. A great strong beer, but that ABV keeps the drinkability under a 5, a dessert or nightcap beer."
"As everyone has indicated pours like Castrol GT. Aroma is drak tropical fruits, chocolcate and coffee. Taste was somewhat syrupy dark malt up front but as it opened hte malt falvors smmothed and the complexity shown through. Very fine balance was struck between malty tastes and the somehwat bitter coffe tastes. The malt won but was balanced nicely by the mildy roasted flavor. Fell in the mouth wa smmoth but not quite aggressive enough for me as to the style."
"I almost feel unworthy to review this beer (almost). Late spring 2003 release, I shared a bomber with a friend last night. This beer is so good, I immediately regretted sharing! Pouring it reminded me of changing the oil in my car -- but if my oil tasted like this stuff I'd be a dedicated motorhead. It had a hint of prune that reminded me somewhat of my '94 Sam Adams Triple Bock, but was far more drinkable. Between the appearance, smell, mouthfeel, and taste, I felt like I had increased my station in life simply by consuming it. In case I'm being too vague, I liked this beer a LOT!"
"Notes: I'm curious as to whether or not this may have been past its best point for consumption. I purchased it very late in 2002 and it has been in my closet since then. The bit of sour flavor was only a tiny cause for concern as the overall experience was excellent. I prefer just a bit more chocolate flavor and that's why it ranks a little behind Storm King for me. I am curious as to how my '03 bottle tastes..."
"Now, later, I acknowledge what an astounding bad boy this one is, and I LOVE IT!!!"
"Pours with no head (Duvel Tulip), color is nearly black, with dark cherry color at the edges of the glass. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel, powerful malts. Tastes delicious, smokey malts, warmness, and twinge of dark cherry flavor perhaps. Its hoppiness balances everything perfectly! Mouthfeel is full and enveloping. You are left with a lasting hop/malt essence long after the last sip. This is a mighty pleasurable stout, one of my favorites!"
"Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. The best beer I've had from Stone. This is the late Spring 2003 release. I still marginially prefer Expedition, but this is a great example of the style too."
"The high alcohol content creeps in slightly with a warming sensation after the swallow.The mouthfeel of this beer is thick and viscous, which is just fine for an imperial stout. I had to grade down a little for drinkability in the sense that this would NOT make a good session beer. The combination of rich flavors and the 9.47%abv would probably be a bit much for that. However, this would be great to have at the end of a satisfying meal, perhaps with a nice cigar."
"This beer has been in my cellar for over eight months and it could stay in there much longer. Smooth overall but could still use more time. I still rate Storm King above this."
"REAL TIME REVIEW: Pours coal black with a coffe ice cream color fluffy head. The nose has roasted and malted mik balls aromas. Holy cow! The first thing I notice before I even swallow and exhale to taste flavors is the sheer thickness of this brew. Sweet tobacco and chared grain/oat flavors to start and a nice licorice hop juice biterness. It reminded me of some of the flavors from a big dip of sweet leafy chewing tobacco after a big meal, if you chew you will know what I mean. So many flavor so few fluid ounces... flavors of bittersweet chocolate, prunes and malted grains. Probably the biggest Imperial Stout I've ever tasted. So thick, velvety and good."
"Roasty, bitter, coco and coffee smell with sweetness and clean hops. Dark black opeque look with a thick rich sticky tan head. Superior lace on the glass. WOW is there a hell of alot going on on the tongue when you taste. Initial abv presence introduces roasty malt and and expresso.. this then mellows to some dark chocolate, plum, gin, and some bitter hops. The mouth is quite thick and coating. As it warms the flavors smooth and the edgyness gets mellowed. It will however get better with even more time in the bottle as this is a 2003 release. A sit back and relax kind of brew. It's blowing 30-55 mph outside my fence just broke, a boat blew off a trailer in my back yard and I have no worries... beer is the solution.. SIS.. not SOS."
"Add another elite Imperial Stout to my list."
"ng"
"Many thanks to Sheepnutz for delivering this beer!"
"Outstanding beer!!! I can see why it's rated so highly. If any other brewery were to put the word ""Imperial"" on it's offerings, I would doubt it, but this beer is truly worthy of the adjective!"
"The best beer I've had in the last five years and one of my top five ever. Only hindered by the drinkability, but still not bad for the style. Very highly recommended and worthy of all the hype."
"Drinkability: My no means an everyday beer, but one aht is good enough to indulge in whenever possible. Another Stone stunner."
"Fantastic big stout. Not syrupy big, so I had a couple, but a couple is the max for this lightweight. Nice West-Coast bitterness balances what must be a fair amount of unfermentables hidden in there. Big mouthfeel, but not so much that it needs to be undercarbonated."
"Pours an opague jet black, with a small but dense dark brown head that mostly diminishes, leaving chunks of lace. Aroma is huge, roasted grain, coffee, burnt caramel, and somewhat vinous. Flavor is grainy, a good bit of fruitiness/dark fruit flavors come through, especially as it gets closer to room temp. Thick, syrup like body, extremely flavorful, truly amazing brew."
"Really a top notch Imperial. Overall, better than I remember."
"2002 version. Eclipse black color. Head is medium. Aroma is roasted malts, fruit esters and dark chocolate. A big bold full bodied Imperial Stout. Deeply roasted malts, fruity (touches of cherries, plums, apricots and raisins), vanilla, chocolate and coffee. It has a nice hop bite. Its very smooth for all the flavor stuff going on here. Soft and creamy texture. Mild and soft carbonation. Excellent sipping beer. Hides the 9.6% alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"The smell is roasty and warms the mind just hinting at the great flavors that are going to come from the thickly inky body. And come it does, with volumes of roasted coffee taste and a thick mouthfeel that informs that this is not your average stout. The overall effect is so full of the coffee and bits of caramel as to nearly overwhelm the senses. The only weakness in this lovely presentation is the limiting effect of the alcohol; limiting as to the sense it gives the rich, tasty brew and limiting in terms of being able to drink more than a little of this great beer."
"Pours out BLACK with a short light head which leaves a nice lace. The darkness is real my friends. Dark in the look, but also dark in the feel. Mouthfeel is big and black. The taste is good. Not the best Imperial in the land, but a good one none the less. I'll let this Imperial review to be the chance to recomend Magic Hat Nailbiter as the best in the land. Storm King is also quite good. But failing those two I would reach for this over an Old Rasputan which is also good stuff. I love the style, what can I say? I'm glad that this beer was finally retailed in Boston the week I left town so I got to try it."
"There are very few beers that linger in my mind days after consumption begging to be had again. Stone Imperial is one that's been tough to get out of my head. This could quite possibly be the ultimate Imperial Stout."
"This was a very tough decision to make. Should any beer be worthy of perfect 5's? Finally, I decided that it wasn't fair to Stone to deduct a point somewhere just because there should be no such thing as a perfect beer. After tasting this, I think I may have been wrong. I honestly don't think any imperial stout could top this. Jet black in color with a thin tan head that just seems to hang around for an eternity. Roasted coffee is dominant in both the aroma and the taste. There are also traces of plums and raisins. What more can I say? As far as this particular style goes, I don't think you can top this."
"Damn, I'm still full from this beer and it's been 3 hours! A great tasting brew that hides the ABV% well until it gets close to room temp. Then the alcohol really comes out and sucker-punches you. This offering from Stone is what all those fizzy yellow ""dark beers are heavy"" beer drinkers have nightmares about. Tough to work through one of these brutes alone but worth the taste treat."
"22 oz bottle. Poured a pitch black, with a massive head, some good lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted barley, espresso coffee, chocolate, and even alcohol! Whew!! The taste is like drinking a quadruple espresso, with chocolate, syrup and a shot thrown in. We're talking big taste here! Creamy smooth and easy drinking even with the high alcohol content."
"This stout poured an opaque, black color with creamy brown foam (with coaxing) that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a very pleasant sweet roasted barley aroma with grain, malt, and oatmeal? in the mix. The taste was sweet and malty with roasted barley, chicory, fruit (figs, raisins), hints of coffee, and toffee, and a trace of alcohol. The hops were present in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, sweet, creamy, and warming, with full body. The aftertaste was nice and lingered. This was a very enjoyable Imperial Stout! Dangerously easy to drink."
"This stuff is liquid desert!"
"Update  I popped one of my cellared summer-released 2005s in June 2006. Its just starting to get into the sweet spot. The alcohol is picking up steam and the sugars are opening up nicely. It still has plenty of body and will be perfect on its second b-day."
"2003 edition. Awesome. By the way, thanks Chaduvel for this one. Brewed in California, delivered by refrigerated truck to Boston, purchased by Chaduvel at Juliana's, flown in baggage to SLC, driven to Logan, and consumed shortly thereafter. What a life for this magnificent 22 oz. beer. Split this one with Kluk. Poured darker than the 4000+ mile motor oil I just drained out of my subaru. Not as thick though (thank god). Formed a small to medium sized tan head. Smell was dominated, initially, by freshly cut barley and roasted espresso. But I also picked out plenty of alcohol, raisins, and other complex fruity/chocolatey mixtures. Amazing. Taste was much like the smell. Big roasted malt presence but the alcohol and the chocolate and the sweetness of the overripe fruits balance this well. The finish was warming and just bitter enough. The lacings on the glass are great. Very thick, rich, and syrupy; just how I like my imperial stouts. My half of the bomber was gone too soon...need more...hmmm...I can really feel this alcohol. Thanks again Stone. 3 for 3!"
"Overall a very drinkable Imperial Stout and one worth seeking out."
"Overall I enjoyed this stout. I just did not love it and I can think of others that I would purchase before this one."
"The smell is very rich, sweet and licorice. The taste is thick of roasted coffee, licorice, currant, smokey and is delicious. Leaves a nice lace on my glass. Mouth feel is exceptional, very warm and smooth. My 22oz bomber is more than adequate, but I feel as if I could drink more and more. This is the epitome of an Imperial Stout, do not pass this one up if you have the option."
"Big Thanks to Gusler for the bottle!"
"I managed t bring a few bottles of this magnificent imperial stout back to CT from a recent trip to California. These are 22 oz bombers, marked spring 2003 release. Intersting aroma of coffee with slight hint of anise just on opening the bottle. Pours out black as night, nice light brown head, and the amazing aroma just builds more in the glass. This smells like an imperial stout, all right. Very full, complex taste, with the coffee flavor most evident and hints of chocolate most prominent. The alcohol warms the throat on the way own, with a nice sweet aftertaste. All I can say is yummy..."
"This is one very wonderful and very big beer."
"Big, beautiful 22oz bomber. Late spring 2003 edition. Black as oil, beautiful to behold, with a nice caramel-brown head that dissipates into a head not unlike the ""crema"" on good italian espresso. Smoky, roasty chocolaty aroma that feels excellent on the nose. Taste is robust and warm, unbelievably delicious and complex. Anise, bitter dark chocolate, roasted espresso and even a little port wine on the finish from the alcohol. I can't wait to see how this tastes after laying it down for a while. My what a masterpiece. The only reason it isn't a 5 all around is that with that alcohol content, one and you're done..."
"Edit: 2004 - I just did not enjoy this beer as much this year...maybe just me, or maybe the beer..but it was less creamy and more fruity..not what I like in a stout"
"Very strong and young. This is one beer worth setting down for a year or two and then it will be remarkable. Stone has either gotten smarter and is producing more of these special releases or the market is slowing down for them. Last year it was impossible to get this beer, this year it is available at a couple of places."
"The mouthfeel was smooth almost sexual. The alcohol was like transparent silk wrapping on the blockbuster body."
"For my 50th review, I wanted to choose a great beer, and the 2003 Stone Imperial Stout is about as good as they come! I'll be waiting on future releases of this Imperial Stout with enthusiasm!"
"My favorite Stone thus far. As is the case with Speedway and Expedition, there is a rich body and sweet malt profile to balance the bitterness. I love the motor oil appearance, and the rich coffee-like mouthfeel. Certainly stronger and richer than Samuel Smith, but not as balanced or drinkable, IMO. However, I would rate this as good as any other imperial I've had, and if Stone ever becomes available in my area, this would be a regular purchase."
"This stout pours midnight black. Opaque. As in absolutely no light gets through. A fizzy brown head sits atop the dark liquid, which is a beautiful sight. As the beer breathes for a bit, copious amounts of roasted malt, along with notes of triple-shot espressos, West Coast hops, and alcohol all seek attention from the nose. Taste is incredibly complex, with black currants, incredibly roasty malt, bittering hops, coffee, and alcohol all present. Mouthfeel is very nice and oily, but not overly so. For such a huge offering, this is the most drinkable imperial stout I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. The alcohol content is certainly there, but it never becomes overly prevalent. Overall, this is one exceptional imperial stout."
"This is probably the darkest looking stout I've had. First scent to hit my nose as I uncapped this 22oz bottle was cocoa and espresso. Reminded me of an espresso gelato I once had. Very enticing aromas, from a deep black brew with a thin head resting atop. Chocolate, espresso, intensely roasted malts and hints of alcohol and yeast. Velvety smooth stout, extremely smooth and approachable with a slight dryness at the end. Superbly balanced and pure decadence. This is the best product I've had from Stone brewery. I drank this bottle at approx. 65 degrees."
"568"
"What a beer!! I have never seen a beer so black and so thick in all my life! This baby poured like 10W30 but had such a heavenly smell to it...hints of plums, chocolate and coffee without much carbonation. This sucker was black through and through, no light could get through whatsoever. I let it sit till it was just below room temp, took my first sip and was amazed. It felt like a thick syrup going down, then I tasted the chocolate and coffee flavors followed up by a huge yet incredibly smoothe alchohol flavor. This was a thick ass beer and it took my about 45-50 min to sit and enjoy the whole bomber bottle. This is one to seek out now and try, then geta couple more and cellar them!"
"Before I start my usual hyping up of the Stone Brewery, just stop me and leave the house and seek out this beer. This is not just any beer this is a beer to be experienced and relived annually like a tradition, only it saddens me to think about the batches from the last two years that have escaped me. This is the 2003 limited spring release, and I am in heaven simply heaven. Pours like crude oil (according to the bottle, but you must see it for yourself), honestly this beer is viscous and opaque it eats up the light that attempts to shine through it. Dark black body with the pleasant thin moccha toned head floating atop of this dark abyss. The aroma contains layers of light milk chocolate tones, dark roasted barley malt, hints of anise in the background, deep plum or any overly ripened fruit in a light brandy liquer all topped off with a light hopping of signature Stone hops to boast it's west coast roots along with an underlying nose of alcohol gracing my olfactory nerves. As the temperature rises so does the amount of alochol that shines through in the flavor of this classic Imperial Russian Stout. A creamy based chocolate/coffe presence along with sweet buttery notes that elegantly dance on my palate. An overall warming effect creates a sense of ecstasy, with notes of fruit tones and acohol notes that are in one word heavenly. Mouthfeel is full and heavy syrup esque, but goes down suprisingly very smoothly. Low carbonation that complements the overall quality of this beer, and definitely a one bottle at a time experience no session beer found here and none wanted from an Imperial Stout of any kind."
"Bottom Line: Maybe this is what Ferrari is really using in the Enzo at $60/quart."
"""Mmmm Beer..."" Homer Simpson"
"Overall, this is a very good beer I quite enjoyed. A big beer not to be taken lightly."
"grabbed 3 of the bombers the other day. pours black and thick like motoroil and has a brown/tan head. looks like a manly drink. the smell is wonderful bringing to thought currents, berries, chocolate and roast with a nice hop kick. the taste is, well, intense to say the least. nice hop flavour mixin it up with coffe, chocolate, port, smoke and that nice imperial alcohol spice. this stuff is thick and heavy and extremely creamy and pleasant in the mouth. the drinkability is high for the type of beer, and the high abv really makes itself known after a bit of drinking. top notch brew."
"I had this awesome beer in a 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a thick black with half a finger of reddish-tan head. The head goes away quick, and there is no lacing. The smell is a sweet malty flavor of coffee and spices. The taste is just fabulous. Hints of chocolate and toffee under roasted coffee and caramel. There is just the right amount of hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is just awesome, very heavy. This is still a drinkable beer at 9.47%. A really great example of an imperial stout!"
"With a beer that swallows all light, Stone has outdone itself with this fine interpretation of the style. I wondered if I should have dared to be selfish enough to take on the entire 22oz rather than share it with a friend; I perservered through the guilt. Black as the ace of spades, the beer pours thickly and smoothly with a consistency reminiscent of the bottom of a coffee pot lined with spent grounds. Atop sits a fluffy, dark brown head. A whiff of chocolate-coffee sweetness and alcohol are apparent throughout the beer's pint-plus lifespan. A soft-silky mouthfeel encompasses the tongue while yeasty flavors with roast coffee and dark chocolate nourish the senses before the smooth liquid drapes down the back of the throat. This is a delicious treat on its own or for dessert. It kept me warm and filled my belly - enough to where I wished I didn't eat the meal I did before hand! - and would pair perfectly with chunky chocolate chip cookies (which would probably stand straight up in the tasty stuff). Stone's Imperial Stout is an excellent flavorful beer that was easy to put to my lips and yet one that's best to take time with. Can't wait to taste this vintage once it's been cellared for a year."
"A monster, indeed. Im really curious to see how this beer tastes in a year. The flavors are not at all rough or segregated, even at this VERY young age. The beer flows seamlessly from the glass into the mouth, creating a uniform, though thoroughly complex flavor profile. Kudos again to the boys at Stone for not only brewing massive beers, but brewing beers with flavorsome substance too."
"""Limited Late Spring 2003 Release"" - I've been anticipating this one for a very, very long time. Pours darker than black with a brown head that goes away farely quickly. I found myself swirling this viscous liquid around the glass and watching it cling to the sides of glass like Jager. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a hint of spice. This was nice and fresh and should age very well. I tried like hell to sip this one, but it knocked me on my ass anyway. But it was in a good way."
"Wow! Beautiful aroma, great flavor, everything is exceptional with this beer. Another world class beer from Stone. If you enjoy your Russian Imperial Stouts with more ""chocolatey"" than ""coffee flavor, this one is for you. Originally sampled 24 May 2002"
"Highly recommended!!! Although the alcohol will stop you.... you'll want to drink a few of these!"
"Thanks to ""Gloworm"" Gusler for the bottle."
"spring 2003 release sampled 01-31-04. inky black with an giant chocolate milk colored foamy head. big nose of soft coco, roasted dark malts, with a touch of espresso. a few sips indicates this is an extremely well crafted brew. extroadinarily rich tastes of milk chocolate, roasted malts, and vinous fruit. it has what i would consider the quintessential imperial stout taste, though i found the body to not be as thick and chewey as i had expected. where this brew shines is in it's full, soft, deeply rich and complex flavor, without coming across as being over the top. superb craftsmanship. i guess to sum it up, i found it to be almost understated, which is not a bad thing, but not what i expected, especially after tasting some of stone's other offerings. a world class imperial. absolutely lovely."
"(22 oz / )"
"For the record, it's March of 2003 as I write this, and the stout was the spring of 2002 version, and apparently has been patiently waiting for me in one of my local beer stores (with no ill effects) for the last several months."
"My first look as I scope its beautiful pour is the thickness that resembles the flow of lava coming off a volcano top. As I pour it in my Stone pint cup (hehe), I can see nothing, what i mean is the shadow it places as I set it next to me on my desktop proves a real deep dark caramel coffee color that gives reason to what is packed in this stout. The smell is rich raisin, deep malt and hints of coffee, Ahhh. The taste is a major kick in the a$$ with full flavor you would want to keep in touch and never let go. Some hints of black cherry and dates are also present. I would slowly savor the combination blast of this wholesome treat that i can see it to be addictive to my stout loving ways. Chances are I would even pour this on my ice cream for that fruitful candy taste. In all this is what I call delicious, maybe this is not the way to describe such a brew, but I can assure this to myself, this is clearly hands down one great Imperial Stout. Stone has got me hooked on this 2002 limited release."
"Just an absolutely incredible ale. I must have more, and soon. Could very well be #1 on my personal list."
"This is one helluva brew! It is my first experience with an Imperial Stout. Richer than Ted Turner. The color is a super black color, like old motor oil. Had a real thick head on it at first, but then quickley subsided. The head was a real reddish brown color, and started out like an inch thick. The taste is that of dark coffee, some fruits(grapes), and chocolate. Kinda taste like a fruity chocolate espresso, which is kinda wierd to me, but I like it. It starts out smooth and finishes smooth. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 on drinkability, was due to the fact that it was so rich. Give it a shot, you might like it."
"This beer is black, and pours with a minimal, but dense brown head. No color can be seen through this beer, it is so ominously dark. This may be to foreshadow the evil effects it will have upon your opinions of other beers. The aroma smacks you hard with chocolate, malt, hops, and some plum fruit. All distinct, but yet one aroma. It's as if this beer transforms it's smell continously to mesmerize it's victims. Upon sipping this silky smooth liquid satin (or is it Satan), intense plum, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors bind your tastebuds. Assertive but well balanced hops secure the knots as this deliciously evil brew takes you hostage. You are assaulted by such intense flavors that it is impossible to distinguish the beginning of one from the end of another. Now completely given in to the power of this beer, you have no choice but to drink every drop of it, and immediately search out some more. Beer may never be the same. I'm not even sure this was beer. It has a power over me now. I must find more. I must find more. I must find more......."
"To me this beer is cast and mold for the style. The color is so dark no light can escape it and it sports a deep tan head. Chocolate malt dominates the aroma with a bit of coffee in the background. Chocolate and black malts are front-n-center in the taste with citrusy hops providing balance but utimately being overshadowed by all the malt. This brew exhibits more fruitiness than other imperial stouts I've tried. Roasted barley comes on late but takes a backseat to other flavors. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy. Outstanding!"
"Absolutely black opaque with a dark tan head that is about what you expect from the style. Alcohol is stronger on the nose than some of the other imperial stouts. Nice malty aroma with good cherry fruitiness under the alcohol bite. Taste is smooth, creamy. Milk chocolate, slight coffeeish hint with creaminess hints at Kahlua. Anise. Great beer."
"Wow I don't know what to say, I feel blessed to have a taste of this brew..........Nice burnt chocolate malt,perfect amount of hops. Black Licorice and coffee flavor.Sweet with a great malt balance, One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had I hope I can get some more."
"This is the first (but certainly will not be the last) high-ABV beer I tried since the limit was raised here in Ohio. Quite possibly the prettiest beer I have ever poured. 2/3 oily black evilness under 1/3 beautiful dark brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate and anise. Amazingly rich and complex flavor consisting of coffee, cloves, chocolate, and lots of other stuff I couldn't wrap my brain around. This is not a beer, this is an experience. It is completely engrossing from beginning to end, and left me with a nice buzz to boot."
"The color of the brew was a deep dark brown/mocha color.  The flavor of this beer had hints of malt, coffee, chocolate, molassas and some light fruit. The aroma matched the flavor with some smells overtaking the others, depending on temperature, and if it is shaken slightly.  A very good stout.  I loved it, and wish I had more."
"Pours an opaque black with an absolutely wonderful light brown head.  Roasted mocha aromas rise from the glass and are unmissable.  Chocolate and molasses are dominant in the mouth with some coffee and other sweet flavors showing themselves at times.  Mouthfeel is absolutely wonderful as it slides down your throat with ease, yet a fair bit of substance.  Bitterness is well balanced with the malts, but still gives a good bite.  Another amazing beer from Stone."
"Pours a super black color with a nice creamy brown head that lasts nicely.  Big roasty chocolate is huge in the nose, almost a chocolate cake like smell, very nice.  Big chocolatey malts jump right out with some more subtle roasted coffee type flavors in the background.  The great warming finish has nice dark fruit tones to it that leaves a great amount of flavor lingering on the tongue for a bit.  Silky smooth and fairly heavy, this is one great brew.  I am going to have to grab a few bottles to cellar as this is one great brew."
"2002 Ltd. May Edition: This beer poured as black as the night. It formed a lovely dark tan, foamy head that left some nice circular lace. An aroma of malt, coffee and cherries. A flavor of malt, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit that gave it a slight winey feel to it. A medium body and a slightly bitter/astrigent finish. A great imperial stout."
"Holy cow!  All other stouts, imperial or otherwise, shall henceforth pale in comparison.  This is one over the top, take-no-prisoners monster stout.  Pushes the envelope on how much flavor can be crammed into a liquid - my tastebuds were overwhelmed and threw in the towel after about four sips.  Coffee, molasses, dark chewy malt, you name it, its in there.  And did I mention thick?  You could just about spread this on toast with a knife.  A little sour and astringent at the end, so that it finishes clean enough to invite another quaff.  Well done, Stone."
"This one has been waiting for me since last year. This is the Spring 2001 release, which is labeled as ""Stone Imperial Russian Stout"". Pours almost like the bottle jokingly suggests, like used motor oil! This is the darkest black I've ever seen in a beer (if varying degrees of darkness in black are even possible. They seem to be, when used in describing beer, so I'll go with that). It just refuses to let light through. Creamy dark brown head, but not much of one. Still leaves some lace. What a delicious aroma! I am thoroughly impressed. Very sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee cream, even a bit of cherry, along with underlying roasted coffee character. In one word, the aroma says ""cream"". Makes you want to jump right into tasting this, however, you still can't help but savor the aroma between each sip. On to the palate, very sweet malt with spicy alcohol accompaniment appears first, coating your mouth with a caramel sweetness. Roasted grain and chocolate with some hints of coffee come next. Some of what I'll call ""dark fruit"" flavor as well, including more cherry character. Hops don't come around much, which surprises me, this having come from Stone. This could be due to the aging. Of course, that's not at all a bad thing! As I expected, a very creamy mouthfeel. What an experience this beer is! Definitely a must-try for anyone who can get it! Great one to cellar, too."
"The virtually jet black hued and opaque brew is topped by a dense, thick, rocky, light brown head that quickly recedes into a thin layer.  Sparse lace is left.  The highly appetizing aroma is comprised of oaky woodiness, carob, dark chocolate, deeply caramelized dark fruit... roasted grains coupled w/ esters and subtle citrusy hops have had a synergistic effect on the aroma... the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  The rich malt profile is dominated by buttery dark chocolate and sugar coated nuttiness, with roasted barley bitterness lending a bittersweet undertone.  Hop bitterness, although secondary, sufficiently balances the residual sweetness, leaving the deeply chocolately malt character intact.  Full bodied w/ a highly dextrinous and viscous mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a hint of spicy alcohol and with more mellow dark chocolate lingering.  Soothing alcohol warmth emerges after a seemingly long deliberation. Stone Imperial Stout is a tremendously flavorful and rich brew.  I only wish I had waited until a cold winter night before drinking this fine beer."
"These F'ers have the best smelling beers around...INCREDIBLE aroma...more of sweetness than dryness...Jet black...very small lace....some cocoa and coffee emerging on nose...""Sweet"" is the first impression on the buds...not much in the way of bittering..very nice sweet flavor...easy drinking for an imperial...a bit more hopping would be nice but a very enjoyable imperial...I have several other reviews of Stone Beer on paper that I will be entering tonight, and this could very well be the best brewery in the USA."
"Notes: Devastatingly flavourful, highly drinkable and very deceiving for a brew at 9.47% abv. This beer shows-off Stone Brewings prowess to take a style a bring it to a greater level than others."
"Spring 2002 release. Mine had little head, which faded quickly, leaving only a glass full of beautiful, magical blackness. It has a terrific fruity sweetness without the pronounced roasty flavors of some other imperials. Chocolate flavor becomes more noticeable as it warms. The hops are just enough to balance the sweetness and keep it from overwhelming this beer. This one's got me thinking about moving south to San Marcos to be closer to the brewery."
"Thick, quickly dissipating tan head.  Glassy black color, the darkest I think I have ever seen.  Aroma is sadly nothing special compared to the hype.  Strong chocolate malt aroma mixed with alcohol, figgish sweet fruit and alcohol.  Toasted wafer flavor, well-balanced between malt, alcohol and hops.  It took me several hours to drink it, which is impressive.  The flavor changed but sustained throughout.  A very tasty imperial but I still prefer Brooklyns."
"Mine didn't have as big of a head as I thought it should. The big dark raostyness was very enjoyable, it had an appropriate dryness (some imperials end to be too sweet for the style) and a nice alcohol presence. Excelent Imperial,side by side with North Coast and only to be out done by Havey and Son"
