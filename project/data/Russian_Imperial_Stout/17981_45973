4.4,0.7,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 7/11/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An incredibly amazing offering.","superspak","Sep 11, 2014"

The finish is slick, with a solid linger.  Huge, but drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Beers"

3.75,-14.2,,,,,,"Picked up a couple bottles of MZ 2014 and decided to drink one now and cellar the other bottle.  I had high expectations for this RIS being a big fan of Cigar City but was underwhelmed.  Although it has a nice jet black color and layer of tannish foam the aroma did not appeal to me.  Smells very boozy and I pick up some notes of licorice and tobacco but they are overpowered by the boozy smell.  The taste again was very boozy which didn't allow me to fully appreciate the chocolate, tobacco and licorice flavors.  I also found the bitterness to be too much (I like hoppy beers so it's not that I don't like a bitter beer in general).  Again, it overpowers the other flavors and doesn't do much for the balance.  I'm going to cellar my second bottle for a year or two and maybe all the flavors will come together and offer a completely different/better beer.","ELS","Aug 31, 2014"

The flavor is a little boozy, a little funky, and a little smoky, with lots of molasses and some more chocolate malt. I tend to prefer coffee and vanilla notes over molasses, but I still enjoyed this, and it is no doubt a fantastic imperial stout. World-class.","ljthiesse","Apr 27, 2014"

Nice moderate carbonation level, small bubbles tickle your mouth most of the way through. Silky smooth with a nice bitter finish that isn't too try or too gritty. Nice flavorful beer that's excellent the whole way through. A crazy good sipper that's super decadent, but drinkable enough for any stout lover to enjoy on their own, but I'd recommend sharing, even though I'm being selfish right now and not!","AndyAvalanche","Mar 24, 2014"

I trust the BA ratings and in this case they were right on. Tremendous stout to say the lease, and a total surprise that a beer this good could come from Florida. Have it again since my first taste and still rate it as one of best stouts that i have had. My buddy was in Florida recently and I told he had to go to Cigar City and have a Marshal Zhukov. He did, and he liked it so much he went again the next day to have it again. Great beer if you like stouts. Right up there with Goose Bourbon County, KBS and Old Rasputin.","ricknelson","Mar 11, 2014"

4.38,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"wow. an extremely impressive stout here, one of the best ive ever had. who needs a barrel when you've got Zhukov? luxurious pour, velvety dark chocolate color with a rising bubbly and thick mocha head. so so dark on the malt. its short of being burnt, but its chocolaty and a touch smoky in the nose, and more earthy and mineral heavy in the flavor. in certain high end espressos, the connoisseurs tell you to look for blueberry and other fruit notes. I get that here, amidst the coffee notes, some dark fruits as well, very nice, subtle complexity. chocolate too is robust, not sweet but bitter and raw. the darkness of this is lovely, so deep and rich, but im finding it a lot more drinkable than I should at 11% abv. my friends left right after we cracked a 750 of this, and im having no trouble at all doing the heavy lifting here. full bodied but not filling. im enjoying it more and more as it warms. this is a world class example of the style, and proof of the fact that we don't need to put every stout out there in a bourbon barrel to make it special. brilliant stuff from cigar city.","StonedTrippin","Nov 20, 2013"

The head stays forever it seems gradually releasing aroma of sweet and dark chocolate, roasted malt, oak/rum, brown sugar and vanilla.Flavor follows with a very complex and dynamic character. Opening with cola, milk chocolate and cream moving to dark chocolate and roasted malts finishing with vanilla and coffe, a great beer. Full, thick body coating the palate and light carbonation. This one lives up to the hype and expectation. A must try.","kylehay2004","Oct 31, 2013"

Scent is packed heavy with chocolate, coffee, and more chocolate. Chocolate cake with a hint of dark fruits, and rich, roasted coffee. Lots of roasted malt. Taste is just as it smells, and man is this beer rich! I thought Speedway Stout was a rich imperial stout that was available regularly, but apparently Florida has some other stuff going on. : ) Mouthfeel is FULL BODIED and rich with a bit of chalkiness.

If you havent had this beer, get it immediately. Smells of coffee with a tiny hint of cherries as it warms up. I would recommend drinking this at room temperature. The characteristics come out a lot more.","Beechner719","Sep 04, 2013"

It's all about IMPERIAL STOUTS. So I was told to try this by a very knowledgeable dude in the craft beer game so I tried it and fell in love dude. Great aged or out of the tap or in the bottle. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this, please do yourself a favor. I've had this couple times on tap and in bottle and it's as good as the first time, every time.

Having tried a bunch of RIS's out there, I can confidently say that I prefer Marshal Zhukov to any of the acknowledged RIS heavyweights such as Darkness, Plead the Fifth, Dark Lord, Ten Fidy, Stone IRS etc. Now if Cigar City released a barrel-aged Marshall Zhukov in bottles.. the world would probably collapse on itself.","Stevedore","Jul 20, 2013"

Strong roasty malt, bakers chocolate, boozy alcohol, and dark fruit. One sip brings an explosion of flavor, charred dark chocolate malt, huge plum, prune, and black cherry notes, molasses which finishes with continued bold roasted malt, dark roast coffee/espresso, and warming alcohol. Ridiculously complex. The mouthfeel of this brew leaves nothing to be desired, huge and viscious, oily, velvety, creamy and silky. The most full-bodied brew that I've ever had and possibly the best mouthfeel of any brew I've had. As far as I'm concerned Marshal Zhukov is the one of the standards for Russian Imperial Stouts.

I love complex tasting beers and each flavor plays beautifully off the other. The booziness is present but is balanced out pretty well so its not overwhelming or overpowering the rest of the beer. I'm really glad I had this and thank akuyper for sending it along in our trade. This is a beer that is definitely worth seeking out and trying and/or cellaring. Am very interested to see how this beer tastes after aging for a few years. I can see why it's so highly regarded.","nootch23","Mar 18, 2013"

4.34,-0.7,4.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! Thick, pitch black pour with an amazing creamy dark caramel colored two finger head with decent retention and crazy lacing. The nose is hugely roasty and subtly sweet with hints of espresso, molasses, dark chocolate, toffee, and booze. The taste is complex and is dominated by the roasted malt along with hints of strong bitter dark chocolate, espresso, wood, burnt coffee, licorice, and some subtle vanilla and dark fruits with just a touch of smoke. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and slightly oily with a bit of sweetness that is abruptly squashed by a lingering bitter finish. For a beer with such a beautiful head, it had a bit of a flat feel and could have used a touch more carbonation, but that's really being picky. I love the way it coats your mouth with flavor. Overall, this is a big rich bold beer that's really drinkable. First ever Cigar City beer, but definitely not the last!","beerdrifter","Mar 07, 2013"

A nice thick dark head. A nice rich dark chocolate smell. The taste is dark chocolate, malts and fruit with a bitterness at the very end. Well balanced and a touch of sweetness. The only problem I have with this beer is the mouthfeel. Too much alcohol burn. I would like at a lower ABV. Needs a year or two of aging.","Florida_SC_Trojan","Feb 18, 2013"

Nice head retention. Solid chocolate/coffee/roast flavor. Taste is on the sweet side with a definite, lingering molasses note. Medium full body. Some hop bitterness helps curtail the sweetness. Good beer but doesn’t do enough to differentiate itself from the pack. As a year round beer (and depending on price), it’s very good, but among all >10% stouts, it’s not so memorable.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

4.1,-6.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout pours a solid black. There's almost four fingers of foam so dark that I could barely tell it apart from the beer when the lights were low. Head retention is fantastic, I actually started getting impatient waiting for it to finish fading. Lacing is left in thick webbing. The nose is wonderfully intense, with rich dark chocolate and potent espresso leading the way. There's also a noticeable molasses aroma, but it's definitely playing third wheel to the other two. The flavor still features plenty of chocolate and espresso, but the molasses is a bit more prominent here. Frankly, I think I like it better in more of a supporting role. There is a nice earthy hop flourish just in time for the finish. The body is nice and chewy, but I don't know if it's too full, or if the carbonation is just too low, but the mouthfeel definitely comes off as a bit syrupy at times. While excellent all the way across the board, Marshal Zhukov is one of the better straight up imperial stouts (no barrels and/or flavorings) that I've had in a while.","axeman9182","Aug 05, 2012"

Lots of Caramel chocolate and brown sugar up front. Then some licorice and fruits move in, some sweet some tart. A bit of earth and ash come in next before a long lingering bitter dark chocolate with just a touch of oxidation. Thick thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy silky sweet mouthfeel. Damn that a big thick beer! I'll bet that's sitting somewhere around 1.050 right now.

A fairly unique flavor is good in a small dose means it’s definitely a great beer for an 8 – 10oz pour. Any more than that and the herbal quality really takes over.

3.91,-10.5,5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"This bottle was the 2010 vintage. This one pours a blackest of black, motor oil sludge in consistency with absolutely no head or activity. It smells of rich and smooth milk and dark chocolates, featuring both sweet and bitter malt characters with a good amount of coffee. The sweetness is almost Baltic-esque. The flavors are heavy on chocolates, all types of chocolates. Initially I got a good amount of milk chocolate, followed by coffee. It is quickly followed by a dark chocolate bitterness and plenty of roasted malts. It's just really sweet, which takes away from the overall balance. It drinks exceptionally smooth, as one should expect. Overall it's a nice RIS but it is on the sweet side. I can see where Nielsborium got it's sugar from and I can see the base of Hunahpu as well. It's a solid beer, worthy of barrel aging and new additions, but alone it's nothing too special.","aasher","Nov 18, 2011"

The bubbles struggle to come to the top of the beer. The smell is of molasses and coffee, there is a ton of dark malts that give off a burnt aroma also. The taste of the beer is very nice, I love the bitter sweetness that the beer has. It's sweet, roasted and dry. The mouthfeel is thick and very oily. Overall this beer was a real gem.

4.18,-4.3,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a thick pitch black with a huge 3 inch intensely dark khaki head that settles into a dome of foam. A nice latticework of lace slowly clings to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of rich dark chocolate, cocoa powder, subdued espresso/coffee, cinnamon, and some roasted malt. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet baker's chocolate, roasted espresso/coffee beans, and some molasses flavors. There is a roasty and hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer is extremely thick and creamy in the mouth. The ABV is hidden pretty well in the smell and taste. Overall, this is a good RIS that is very rich and makes for a slow sipper. I am glad I finally got to try one of these.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 06, 2011"

I would prefer some more balanced milk chocolate flavors but I guess that is more the American Stout category as opposed to the RIS category here. Better than I remember, but my small sample at the bar was enough as I would struggle to finish the 750ml that this is typically bottled in. Maybe I am just over the Russian Imperial Stout category or my tastes have just shifted away from enjoying these huge chewy beast beers.","claspada","Jul 15, 2011"

The light, but still noticeable carbonation helps this go down very easily. The drinkability is very good for the high ABV and the thickness, only the smallest hint of alcohol is available. This is the batch of Zhukov's to make anyone a believer. This is one of the best big stouts I've ever had. Be on the lookout for the 2011 bottles. If you see them, get as many as you can. It'll be absolutely worth it.","shand","Jul 12, 2011"

3.15,-27.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"O: A bit of a disappointment for me, overly sweet and this sweetness is too prominent in the flavor profile for me. I had been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time. This is from the batch that I had heard there were carbonation issues with some of the bottles, and it seems like this could be a bottle affected by it(although never having had this beer before I cannot be sure). I don't know if I drank this a few months earlier if the sweetness wouldn't have been as intense, of if the carbonation may have been slightly higher, but I wish I would have tried it earlier. Not a terrible beer, but I wish I had about 6 ounces of it and not the 2/3rds of a bottle that I do. Would like to try again sometime to see if the over sweetness that I am getting out of this beer and lack of carbonation are a fluke, or if that is just how this beer is. That being said, it really doesn't taste like 11% and I am soldiering on and putting it down a little quicker than most other beers of this strength, maybe just because I want to move on to something else.","headbucket","Apr 04, 2011"

It was a sweet tasting beer with chocolate, grape, smoke and caramel all combined into a very tasty melange.

There are some subtle cocoa notes as well as a hint of coffee towards the end. It is sure a sipper. It feels so thick and chewy in the mouth it is a meal in itself.

Now the best part about this brew is the taste, at first it tastes like a chocolate milkshake with the bitterness settling in after you gulp it down. There is also a strong coffee aftertaste which is really nice. because of the low carbonation it is very difficult to drink the whole liter as it is so thick, that is this beers only downside.

4.66,6.6,3,4.5,5,5,4.5,"A faint hiss as I popped the cap. The rich, chocolatey smell immediate wafted and filled the room. Poured thick, viscous, and somewhat oil-like. No head to speak of, no bubbles, just a black heavy mass in the glass. No light passes through, save a tiny bit at the edge of the glass. Would be more impressive with a dense tan head, but the viscosity makes up for it I suppose... Anyway, the aroma is impressive. A nice blend of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate (if you follow Lindt's chocolate, this is closer to the 80% cocoa bar), a faint tint of black currants, and a touch of black patent malt. This is an assertive stout, yet presents itself elegantly. The first sip reveals such complexity, yet reminds to to sit back, not worry about it and simply enjoy the beer. Sweet and fruity in the forefront, with the roastiness and cocoa character following closely. The finish is extended with much coffee and touches of vanilla, followed by a lightly astringent and almost charcoal-like texture. Alcohol warmth and dryness follows. Although no head is apparent, the beer is certainly carbonated, albeit very mild. I enjoy that texture with an intensely rich beer as such. A very nice sipper. I can see this working very well with many different desserts or with a chocolatey cigar. Even as a stand-alone dessert beer. Good job, Cigar City. This is a different beer than the last time I tried it and I'm glad I'm reviewing it this time.","DmanGTR","Oct 07, 2010"

Although it drank extremely well for the style, it may still be a bit much for novice beer drinkers. This is a beer meant to be savored, and that it should be. Once again, another fine offering from a brewery that doesn't get enough attention due to the overall lack of a craft beer scene in the South.","BDJake","Beers"

The taste is a very sharp kick of heavily roasted malts with bitter bakers cocoa and some espresso and molasses, citrus hops come through a bit as the beer warms. The beer is a bit on the heavy side with its 11.5% abv certainly showing, but this is a very enjoyable sipper.

This one is very well balanced, even a bit on the sweet side. Dark as motor oil, very little head. ABV does not overwhelm, and the beer gets better by the sip. Already one of my favorite imperials.

The flavor brings thick molasses grassy hop that finishes with an ashy smoke. Unreal. Thick with minor carbonation and tart apricot highlights. Charcoal works it's way to the top with fruity overtones of watermelon and apricot with lots of buttery edges. Reasonably drinkable for such a sturdy brew but naturally a bit too much alcohol for proper sessioning. The feel is smooth and invites slow but steady enjoyment.

A sky so dismal they're begging to see the glorious sun of Highland Scotland, bitter winters, the eternal dread of the oprichniki: they all seem bright compared with the darkness currently sitting in my snifter. Motor oil, chocolate syrup, and pitch could be used as a comparative image, but they all fall short. This is Russian darkness at its finest. Even the finger-thick foamy head is dark, the second-darkest head I've yet seen (I can't really remember the darkest, but I know there was something darker than this one). Just as the Russian people could not escape the gloom of the Soviet bootheel, light cannot escape from this brew. I know I've gone a bit overboard in discussing the look here, but I was amazed by the bleakness oozing thickly from the bottle during the pour. Now, as distinctively Russian as the appearance is, I'm not sure how Russian the smell comes off as being. Heavy doses of chocolate and anise are joined by rabbit punches of black cherries, coffee, and tobacco. I'm sure you can come by these in Russia, but they're not recognized as Russian things. You know what I mean? Upon drinking, the good Marshal himself lets his troops loose: Whole divisions of bitter chocolate, brigades of tobacco and cran-black cherry, and skirmishing squads of leather, figs, burnt toast, molasses, and nutmeg. The victory is quick and one-sided, a Russian version of Austerlitz. The occupation then begins, and these troops make sure they bring every nook and cranny of the tongue under complete control. Despite this lingering and brutal occupation, a dearth of active carbonation, and a healthy, semi-perceived alcoholic content, the drinkability is dangerously high here. I just can't seem to get enough of that grinning soldier on the bottle and the brew that bears his name.","TMoney2591","Apr 25, 2010"

There is a nice combination of dry charred earthy scorched malts that adds a bunch of bitterness and a little minerality, as well as chewy earthy hops. A nice hop finish really. A touch of lingering sticky sweetness, and lots of lingering roast and coffee. Lots of lingering malts as well. Some bitterness and minerality on the back of the tongue as well. It really coats the mouth and sticks around. A touch of warming booze, but being 11.5% it hides it really well. I like this one, but it's hard to drink an entire 750ml by myself.

Pure black in color liquid, that's all you can say, not a star in the sky. Cappuccino, milk chocolate, licorice blow through your nostrils like wet paper, the smokiness is more like incense than wood smoke, light touch of plum and cherry fruit, there's an underlying leafiness, like plant oils on your fingers, otherwise hops a vocal backseat driver. Full-bodied enough that you have to gulp to get it going down your throat, as expected from the pour, the carbonation has a large billowing effect, making it foam up and close to out of your mouth. Less milky here, the roast more pronounced in the coffee bean, dark chocolate flavors, close to bitter. Flutter of caramel, butterscotch. The cherry fruit deepens here, more red than black. Again the hops don't distinguish themselves through individual flavors, more both a tactile bite and oiliness which cements the whole onto your palate. Monochromatic, as all exemplary steamrollers are. You can't wash it out of your mouth with a hose.","farrago","Feb 17, 2010"

Bitter chocolate dominates, followed by a strong roasted coffee. Nice and earthy. The brew is big and chewy, yet exceptionaly smooth. Abv is well hidden.

Mouthfeel is good, big bodied despite the high ABV, lots of flavors that completely coat the mouth. The alcohol is not as obvious in the beer as it was in the aroma, the flavor is dominated by a strong sweetness (that the alcohol may be contributing to) in the front of a good full malt character and then an avalanche of roasted espresso and coffee in the back of the mouth. Beer continues to surprise by not having an aftertaste. The coffee flavor is present and lingers but there is not secondary flavors. This is a world class beer and one of the, if not the best, Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had.

The dominant taste is the dark chocolate with the coffee flavor enhancing it, especially in the back end which stays strong for a couple of minutes, very pleasant. My favorite part of the beer is the mouthfeel; the taste is awesome but the beer is so damn creamy, it's like liquid velvet. The 11.5% is totally masked, booze taste at all.
