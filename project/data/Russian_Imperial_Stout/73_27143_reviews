review_text
"This is one of a few barrel aged beers in which I prefer the regular version better. Looks and smells outstanding. I just think it drinks way too sweet and the body has a little bit too much carbonation giving it a soapy feel. I would guess that this is a Jack Daniels barrel beer. It tastes like cheap whisky instead of good bourbon. I also notice a lot more black licorice than in the base beer. Still above average, but pretty disappointed."

"This is not quite at the level of other big name BA stouts. It's also"

"Overall: pretty good, actually, but clearly a notch below the top tier. I was probably a bit hard on this; interested to see how the 2012, 2014, and non-BA iterations I've got in the cellar stack up."

"Pours almost black, though much lighter than any other of this style I’ve seen. Aroma is multi with notes of chocolate and espresso, but kind of mild. Whisky barrel aging makes itself an obvious taste upfront, and on each sip toward the bottom of the glass. Quickly mellows into semi sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Decent brew overall, but not a great example of an imperial stout. I’m don’t much enjoy whisky, so perhaps I’m not being exactly objective."
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head that fades quickly.  Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coconut and vanilla.  The tastes follows the nose but with more coconut and vanilla.  Full creamy mouthfeel.  Warming as it goes down.  Just a fantastic beer that I hope to enjoy every year! Much better than the regular BO stout if you ask me.  Well done GLB!!"

"Very good, delightfully surprised. Wasn't expecting it to be that good."

"Overall this was a good beer but it was a little underwhelming. The hype surrounding this beer as one of the top 250 in the world probably raised my expectations somewhat. Bourbon was pretty pronounced but all the other flavors were kinda muted. Glad I got to try it but It wasn't anywhere close to the top barrel aged stouts out there."

"Overall: a very solid ba stout. certainly worth a try and one I'd happily go for again but not going to give up too much for it. great sweetness that isn't cloying and full of complexity. I wouldn't expect anything less than this from Great Lakes."
"Nice and very well balanced BA stout. Is very good and has some real good flavor. It is a bit light for such a big stout. Which I guess is good since it makes for easy drinking. I was told to let I sit a year and didn't. In retrospect I wish I would have. The problem is I am from Cleveland and needed something celebratory since I found out Lebron came back today~"

"Pour is dark brown with a tight toffee colored head. Nose is light bourbon and wood, fair bit of sweet milk chocolate, hints of anise and chewy caramel. Taste has more wood, lots. Fairly forward bourbon notes, lots of rich milk chocolate and some sweeter caramel type malt. Full bodied, thick and creamy with strong carbonation and some alcohol burn through the finish. Heavy on the bourbon and wood side."

"Even though the most important aspects are well taken care of I think this one's not living up to its potential fresh, thankfully I'm going to have a second bottle to age, cheers Patrick!!"

"Looks like a stout. Black, lighter then tan head boardering on off white. Sticky lacing, relative good staying power in the head. Aroma is some what muted, what is there smells of vanilla mixed with chocolate milk and light roast. But again it is very faint, however as it 'breaths' the aroma pronounces itself more. Flavor wins all the points here. Nice marriage of barrel to beer. Chocolate, roast, and vanilla mesh seemlessly with bourbon barrel vanilla and toffee. Velvety smooth mouthfeel and rich. Little hint of alocohole here and there, actually kinda hot-ish for a beer of 9.5%. That's it that's all, great beer here."
""
"O - Really good barrel-aged stout. The alcohol is not very noticeable. The mouthfeel is incredible and the taste is very good."

""

"O- I was really lucky to find this on tap while I was in Columbus for the weekend. I was a bit disappointed by this one, not a that big of a barrel presence to me. I might even say I prefer Dragon's Milk to this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I was expecting it to be a little thicker looking, but its fairly light and lively and it has a tremendous flavour. It's a big beer but it is still very well balanced and all the flavours work very well together. The barrel aging isn't all that pronounced, it just accentuates the beer a touch. A high quality brew that is surprising not cloying in the least."
"O- Damn good beer, not as superior to the standard blackout stout that I am already very fond of."

"dark black pour with a slight head. smell is big on bourbon...expected. taste is very smooth and drinkable. slight bourbon but it didnt overpower the chocolate notes at all and you get a lot of the original beer flavor too. the big knock for me on this beer though is the mouthfeel...almost a thin body. way way too thin for a BA stout, we were joking that this was a session BA stout. still though, the flavor is solid. just wish it had SOME sort of body."

"Thanks Jeff for the trade! Pours black with brown highlights when held to the light. Thin tan head that fades quickly. Not a lot of lacing to speak of. Lots of roasted coffee on the nose. Notes of chocolate, bourbon, and some dark fruit, notably fig. Bourbon on the front of the palate followed by coffee and sweet, dark fruit. Milk chocolate and tobacco on the back end. Nice malty caramel aftertaste. Bourbon gets more and more prominent as it warms. Medium bodied with light carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Overall a solid BA stout, a little over-hyped, but I'd seek it out again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What can be said about this beer that hasn't already been said in other reviews. A fantastic russian imperial stout to begin with, gets raised to a complex degree when the booze and the wood are introduced from the bourbon barrel-aging. The nose comes big with notes of booze, tobacco, burnt sugar, and caramel with wood coming through in between. Same again when it comes to the palate. All those flavors with added pleasure of bourbon, and everything that that spirit brings to the table. An exceptional ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall, very well balanced for a barrel age. The black out stout really holds it's own against the bourbon barrel. Very well done beer, I had a hard time finding anything wrong with it."
"One could call this a ""drinkable"" Imperial Stout, because the abv, while high, is still under 10%. The body is not viscous, and the booziness is mostly contained. It's not the best example of a barrel-aged impy stout. It's not the worst either. It's somewhere in the middle."

"Bottle from jbwimer. Huge thanks for this big want of mine. Bottle pours pitch black into my tulip with a small half finger khaki brown head. Aroma of loads of rich chocolate fudgy goodness, some roasty grains, bourbon, oak, coconut. Flavor is big sweet chocolate up feont with plenty of bourbon and roast, it finishes with huge vanilla from the barrel, some light coconut and chocolate and oh my lord so smooth. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation, heavy body. This is fantastic. The finish is one of the best and it is so velvety smooth. Right up there with the best BA stouts and yet much more drinkable. Great Lakes is just such an incredible brewery."
""
"Pours a dark brownish amber. Off white head forms and leaves some lace. Aroma of malt, coffee, vanilla, of course, some bourbon. In the taste, roasted malt, vanilla, smoke, wood and a warming booze. You get a lot of the barrel with this brew. Roasted and a lot of tannins drying it out. Full bodied, smooth, dry and satisfying. Overall, a different beast than the regular, more coffee and vanilla tasting version. A standalone giant in its own right."

"2013 release vintage poured into snifter. Pours black with a small off white head. Smell is full of great bourbon oak notes, some cinnamon, sweet marshmallow, some coffee , some chocolate. Taste starts with a hit of smooth bourbon oak barrel, some hints of cocoa, coffee, sweet dark fruit, again some cinnamon, small anise flavor. Texture is perfect, velvety smooth. Overall this beer is fantastic, I had one fresh and it was pretty hot, after about 8 months it's has aged wonderfully, amazing bba stout from an amazing Ohio brewery."

"Being a huge fan of the original Blackout Stout already, I just had to give the barrel aged version a whirl. I was impressed. The added oakiness (for better lack of term) was a grand addition to an already phenomenal brew. It added a great depth of flavor to the already great stout that Great Lakes has had brewing for a while. The mocha notes that start as you take your first sip are satisfying and enjoyable, while the finish hits you with notes of bourbon and vanilla. If you enjoyed the original, give this one a try. I do not think you will be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It's black as it's namesake and has a central pillow and flanking ring of mocha foam. Smells of graham, oak, toasted malts, residually melted sugars, a hint of craft caramel, some vanilla, alcohol and raw oats. Flavor follows suit: malts, oak, vanilla, oak, leathery, a bit of fig, a solid molasses undertone (nothing too overpowering, just a complement), and some nougat. Nearly full bodied with slightly hi carb and a semi dry finish. This a really tasty beer. I'm glad to have had it, and I would drink it again for certain."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I can't say enough about this beer. The first thing that comes to mind is the most important characteristic that can be associated with a beer, and wine for that matter, balance. This stout is so overly whelming balanced it's crazy. It's a creamy, velvety, roasty, chocolaty, bourbon flavored masterpiece. I've been brewing myself for 6 years now and can only aspire to craft a beer as grand as this. I could write forever about how delicious it is and it wouldn't do it any justice. If you haven't had this beer, I implore you to buy or get one in a trade. Outstanding!"
"Overall, this is a really enjoyable brew, but the barrel aging actually took away some of the subtlety that makes the original so good. The barrel characteristics haven't integrated very well. I'm going to let my second bottle sit in the cellar for 12 months or so and see how it compares to the regular Blackout then."

"O: I've had a few bottles of this, both fresh and aged. I definitely recommend sitting on this for at least a year, it ages well."
""
""
""
"O - The ubarraled version is delicious, but the barrel aging has mellowed the somewhat bitter char and added in layers of sweet complexity. Bourbon is prominent, but not overpowering. I am glad I got a few of these, as I am interested to see how it ages."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle, this treat was a handsome black color with little bubbles forming on the sides of the glass. From the aroma, one gets the hint that this is going to be a good one. A generous boozy aroma jumps out of this one, with malts and dark fruits hiding in the background. In the initial taste, one notes the booze, vanilla, dark fruits, spicy malt, and sweetness that reminds me of gummi bears. In the aftertaste, the taste evolves into burnt sugar with boozy warm malts. The thick texture allows the warming to continue all the way to the belly. This is a really good example of what a barrel aged stout should taste like."

"O: Excellent beer, quite different from the sweet barrel aged stouts that I like (BCBS, Black Note) and much better bourbon flavor than the hoppier and drier stouts like Abyss and BA Blackbeerd. Maybe it's the time I'm drinking it (5 months after release), but it's delicious."

"many thanks to thebrewo for hooking this one up via trade. it is a real treat. pours not quite black, with a shiny glow and an inch or so of rich mocha lather on top. the nose is not alcoholic at all, very impressive. lots of deep roast, some lighter coffee notes, and a lot of vanilla from the bourbon barrel. some char too, but it isn't bitter to the taste at all, and is in fact more on the sweet side. some licorice notes in the taste as well, and a warming chocolaty finish that reminds me of some of the top rated barrel aged imperial stouts on BA. what I love the most about this beer is its feel, its not a big heavy syrupy sticky mess like so many of these can be. its still full bodied, but drinkably so, not weighty or overly sweet or boozy. almost reminds me of the eclipse series, with that touch of honey but pleasant lightness in a dark beer. it seems weird to call this an everyday barrel aged imperial stout, but it kind of is. its something I could see myself drinking a lot more of than many of the others. the buzz is nice, and the finish is glorious, staying on the palate for quite some time. probably the best great lakes offering ive ever had."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent bourbon barrel-aged stout, not too over the top but brings plenty of flavour. Sounds like GLBC's modus operandi to me here. It's sweet, dry, hot, bourbon-ey, and bitter all at once. Very complex but not too over the top with any one thing. A true pleasure to sip on. Hopefully I don't black out tonight; that would be ironic. Anyway, this is a bit pricey at $30/4pk and I think I would rather pick up BCBS and hang onto it for a year. That being said, I don't think I would mind buying a 4-pack ever year if I lived close to Cleveland. So that's my 2 cents here- great beer for sure."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Very good offering that is complex in the nose as well as on the palette. BABOS lives up to the hype that surrounds it. Be prepared for this to fall on the expensive side but I think that is to be expected from a limited release. Classified as a Russian Imperial Stout at 9.5% ABV. Consumed 3/15/13."
""
""
""
"Feels a bit slick and flat. Gotta get this sticky sweet off my teeth, bubbles would work. Actually didn't finish it because the feel just didn't grow on me in a good way. Other than that, it was easy drinking. ABV is well hidden"
""
""
"O: The barrel treatment is a bit on the harsher end, esp. with the alcohol burn, and the base characteristics are pretty overwhelmed. Some of the harshness mellows out as it warms to room temperature, but it remains."

"O-A great BA stout, doesn't rank up there with KBS, BCBS etc but still yummy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't want to be one of those people but given the ""hype"" around this beer it is lackluster. Good flavors but no the flavors are good."
""
""
""
"O: Love this beer. Some vintages are better than others (2009 comes to mind as one of the best) but this 2013 vintage is outstanding. One of my favorite beers of all time. It's just incredibly drinkable for a 9.5% barrel aged stout. Love it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really nice beer, the bourbon isn't overpowering at all, but its plenty strong enough. Nice balance, all the other flavors stand out well. The biggest gripe is the price. It works out at 8$ for a single 12 oz bottle. I still prefer kbs over this, and that's around 5$ a bottle. That along with it being a brewery only release for purchase is the only real downfalls."
"O: This was alright, but I'm just not a fan of this beer or the base. It's too thin to begin with and the barrel aging thins this out even more and the base gets kind of lost."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the huge, warming, and inviting nose. While this component of the beer approaches comparability to the top of the heap beers like Bourbon County, the taste strays a bit, focusing much more on the outright presence of booze, and seeing how roasty and charred we could go with the malts. This swings things out of that perfect balance, with loss of necessary sweetness, and what are essentially burnt malts. Sadly this beer marks the rare case where the standard base beer is considerably smoother than the barrel aged version. That being said, this guy sips wells, is certainly palatable, and is a treat for any enthusiast."
""
"T: Opens on a pretty big roasted note, with some faint dark chocolate and astringent black coffee. Bourbon comes on strong on the finish and leaves a slightly hot, drying finish. A touch of peat and anise on the finish as well. There's a touch of sweetness in here, but it's beaten away pretty quickly by the darker, bolder flavors. A very tasty stout, but a bit much if you don't like them dark and nasty. Luckily, I do."

"O: This beer was damn good. Probably the best beer I've ever had from Ohio. Really glad I got a full 4pack as I fully expect this to improve after a year or so as the bourbon cools off a bit. Don't miss this one! 4"
"M: Very low carbonation. Despite that, maintains only medium body keeping the drinkability high, marred only by a slight harsh finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well balanced stout that doesn't blow me away. It seems to have lost a little bit of what makes bourbon and Imperial stouts great. I blame a lot of that on the lack of heft in the beer. Still, you won't go too wrong with it."
""
""
""
"D - A well-made barrel-aged stout that displays the restraint I'd expect from a fairly conservative brewery like Great Lakes. I'd certainly drink it again if it were on-tap or readily available in bottles, and I think the exorbitant trade demands have abated now that supply has increased; was somewhat overhyped when it was only 600 bottles. Still, a nice spin on an already solid beer."
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer and I would love to try one with some more age on it."
""
""
""

"Overall this is a good Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout. I enjoy others more, and I probably should have let this one sit a year or so. I'm glad I tried it. Cheers."

"***Great balance, not too daunting, but the 12oz is perfect. The barrel takes away from the great coffee notes in the regular version, but I'd call it a fair trade off. Good drinkability, and a BA stout that can stand up with the best. $7 is a great value for this stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I know lots of Great Lakes' lighter beers are well loved, but between this & the Edmund Fitzgerald porter, I think dark beers are where they truly shine. $8 for a 12oz bottle seems a bit steep until you step back & look at what many restaurants are charging for BMC; I would happily buy more of this for that price. As the release tasting event showed, this beer ages like a champ so pop one now but set a few aside for a few years."
""
""
"This is truly the best beer that I have ever had. And I have had a LOT of quality beer in my 43 years. This beer is perfection in a bottle. I honestly do not know how another beer can ever eclipse the superb taste of this beer. At $30 a 4 pack though it isn't cheap. And if you are fortunate enough to have it on tap for the brief period of time it is available, you'd willingly pay more than $8 a beer for this gem."
"Overall - an already solid stout that is very well complemented by the bourbon. A good balance of flavors shows that the brewers really know what they're doing with this barrel-aged stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Get this beer at least once. This beer should be the bench mark for elite stouts."
"From notes, 8/22/10. 2006 vintage. Pours black with just a few bubbles on top that dissipate pretty quickly. Didn't expect much appearance-wise, anyway. Excellent barrel-aged stout. Very smooth feel. Some well-blended oxidation really added a nice aged flavor. Great bourbon aroma with a big chocolate and roasted malt flavor. The whole thing was blended into a velvety soft package. Some light vanilla and oak around the edges. Very little alcohol burn, at least at this point. Great beer."

"O: exceeded expectations, as good as I expected....can't wait to drink another one!!"
""
""

"O: A pretty nice barrel aged stout. Definitely worth seeking out, but not up there with the elite BA stouts out there."

"O- This beer was an excellent bourbon barrel treatment of an already great beer. Very nicely executed."

"Bottle thanks to sarro. Pitch black with light off white head. Aroma of coffee, powdered chocolate, vanilla and smoke. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, coffee and rich crunchy cereal. A very nice layered and balanced imperial stout that benefits from barrel aging without being overdone."

"This is my first Barrel Aged Blackout and it is much better than the regular version, which is a pretty good beer in its own right...my point is this is one of the most improved barrel treatments to a beer I have had in quite some time. The vanilla is so rich, I would have guessed it was a vanilla infused stout if had blind. Not too fruity and the chocolate is bold. Its not too boozy, not over-the-top sweet and has great flow. Mouthfeel is not overly thick, but it is adequate and the carbonation is supple and smooth. This is a great beer, one of the most impressive I have had in awhile, thanks Auslander!"
"Overall - Only on close inspection is this a really great beer. I would be hard pressed to admit this is better than the original, as the barrel masks a great deal of the beer's qualities. Nonetheless, I am a sucker for bourbon and its barrels. Well done."

"651mL 2009 ed courtesy of beeranddogs. The pour is clear cola, not black, with ruby highlights. The beer is almost the opposite of normal Blackout in that you have to really coax a head out of this thing. Even swirling, pouring from ten stories high; the head is about a quarter inch of yellowish tan foam that has okay retention and leaves little swathy lace. I understand that barrel aged beers may have less carbonation and head retention, but after the beer is finished in the barrel, it gets put back into the brite tank for conditioning in the bottle. So it should have good retention and rise up healthily. But the pour is dismal, making it hard to get a big aroma out of the beer. The muted bourbon first comes across a bit oxidized, slight red apples, lots of cocoa butter, and marzipan. As it warms, the nose comes into play with big bourbon, coconut, vanilla. It is quite mellowed out but very apparent. The taste is thinning, a bit watery. Really lacks the richness and bitterness of normal Blackout. There is definitely milk chocolate, warming bourbon, slight oak, lots of vanilla and cream. But the body is not well integrated. Very little carbonation doesn’t help the mouthfeel and lack of bitterness makes the body rely on vanilla and bourbon with no drying oak, no spicy oak, no spicy alcohol even. Just sort of a sweet mess that is hard to fall in love with. 11/8/2010 8/3/7/4/15=3.7"

"Verdict: Wonderful stout from Great Lakes. Sad to see my last bottle go, but this has aged gracefully, I'd love to take a stab at keeping these in the cellar for more than 9 months, but temptation will likely get the best of me. The richness is spot on, great body, a well rounded and very pleasant barrel aged stout."

"Overall fairly solid although something about the bourbon integration is a bit off for me. I'll definitely drink this again, but if it's a choice between this, KBS, BBPtF, etc. this one probably comes in last."
"Overall, this was a delightful BBA stout but by no means was it top notch. It is lacking in the body more so than anything but it is definitely one of the softest BBA stouts I have had. Take this for what you want but while this was a good beer, I was not impressed."
""
""
""
"I liked it very much, but what it really did for me is remind me of how much I liked the un-barreled version."
""
"O- This was definitely a nice BA Imperial Stout that was interesting to try. The nose was a little bit too dominated by the bourbon, but the taste was nicely balanced. This beer was definitely a sipper, there was a tiny bit of heat and the bourbon presence is a little bit heavy. The beer was nicely done with a fairly nice balance (bourbon could have been toned down a tiny bit), plenty of complex tastes, nice use of barrel aging, and a nice mouthfeel despite the slight heat. Not a beer that I'd seek out all the time, but definitely an interesting try."
"O- nice BA stout but not one I will seek out every year."
""
"Overall this is a very good beer. It definitely stands out from many of the other BBA stouts that are cropping up everywhere from the bitter chocolate and dry oak. It also benefits from being under 10% ABV in that there's no booziness to speak of. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall this was super, age has done nothing to lower the quality of the original product and if anything it has only added to the complexity and quality. This is one smooth beer and I am grateful for the opportunity to taste this. This only proves that cellaring beer is a great practice if you have the discipline. I appreciate the less than 10% ABV making this much more ""drinkable"" compared to many of the monsters that are produced in today's imperial heavy craft beer market."
"A pretty balanced bourbon barrel stout. Personally, not a fan of the roastiness, but this is to be expected since I feel similarly about the regular Blackout Stout. Good beer, but not worth going to much trouble to seek out, in my opinion. Much better BA stouts out there, IMO."
""
""
""
" The flavor is very full with lots of toffee, cocoa, wood with vanilla and bourbon interwoven with slight coffee and bready flavors from the yeast with a toasted and spiced taste which brings out some dark fruit toward the middle with mild earthy hints of raisin and chocolate toward the finish with oak blending well throughout the flavor. Overall this is a splendid oak aged stout, it satisfied from first taste and I didn't want to drain the glass, but it left me feeling satisfied and it is one of the most drinkable wood aged stouts I have had."
""
"O: A solid barrel aged imperial stout. Nothing else really to say! Glad to try it and wish I could get it regularly."
"Overall: Great Lakes is a really well-rounded brewery. It seems like all of their offerings are enjoyable and this one is no exception. Seek and enjoy advocates."
""
"O: Near perfect in my books. Very tasty stout!"
""
""
"O: A nice sipping beer. Thinner than most in the style, not thick and syrupy, a little more body I think would have helped. But all in all, a solid BA RIS."
"O - If you like the taste of bourbon and stouts, you will probably like this beer. I am glad I had the opportunity to have it. Thanks Auslander."
"Overall, a pretty good BA stout. A bit too boozy for my taste, which hurts drinkability, but it's got some good flavors. I'd be curious to see what some age does to it. Didn't really blow me away, though... maybe I've just been having too many stouts recently."
"I don't know if I'll ever be fortunate enough to land this again. One can only hope."
""
""
"O - There's a reason this is one of my favorite beers - Great Lakes knows their stuff. This year's vintage is simply more whiskey-forward than I remember from last year. Ought to age very well."
""

"Smell of coffee and very dark chocolate. Very easy drinkable but a strong one. Enjoyed it till the last drop. Mouthfeel was very nice, this is a friendly RIP to drink, not the best i ever had but it is a good one!"

"Overall, a really nice and balanced bourbon barrel stout. Definitely a nice strong barrel presence and really nicely balanced for how fresh it is. I would definitely get this again."
"Poured from '10 bomber into tulip glass. Pours opaque dark brown color with a small off white creamy head. Smells like chocolate liquor, vanilla, brown sugar and molasses. Initial taste is a medium body that coats the mouth with caramel and roasty smokiness. Quite a lot of warming from alcohol. Finishing with chocolate and warming alcohol presence. Flavor hangs around for a while, but doesn't quite match up to the regular blackout stout that I really love. A still good beer nonetheless, but I'd rather get a six pack of the regular one which is much easier."
"Poured an opaque dark brown color with a small off white creamy head. Smells like chocolate liquor, vanilla, brown sugar and molasses. Initial taste is a medium body that coats the mouth with caramel and roasty smokiness. Quite a lot of warming from Alcohol. Finishing with chocolate and warming alcohol presence. Flavor hangs around for a while, Beer is almost gone, and still has good head retention and some lacing on the glass. Great beer."
"O: What a great barrel-aged RIS. The caramel and the vanilla from the bourbon is great on its own, but combined with the blackout stout just makes it stellar. A complex, well-balanced yet smooth and creamy RIS. Not hot like a lot of barrel-aged beers either. One of the nicest and easy-drinking versions around. Second only to something like a KBS, this was a borderline 5 on taste."

"O: At first glance, I think this beer drinks a little thin. But as I enjoy and consider it more, I realize that it's not thin, just focused. This is chocolatey, vanilla-infused, coconut-laden, and filled with nice bourbon notes. A simpler BA stout, no doubt, but top-notch all the same. Very much enjoy this one."
"Overall, a fantastic brew. IM looking forward to seeing how it ages when I try this vintage again in the winter time."
""
""
"Highly recommend. Soon enough, this beer won't be on the top100 list anymore because there's always some new, uber rare beer made in an area of the country that isn't known for beer, and it will become even easier to acquire. I look forward to that day. If you're reading this, and you have a bottle of blackout stout, yes, you can offer it in a trade to me."

"A hearty two thumbs up."
""
"O - This is a really nice beer. It gets a lot of bonus points for being as complex as it is. It's changed a lot as it's warmed up (as expected). I love the base beer and I cannot wait to see what happens to this with a year or 2 of age on it. I have 3 more 2012's... plan on drinking one in a few months, one in a year, and one a couple years down the road. I'll try to edit this as I go!"

"overall the nose is great and got better as it warmed, the taste fallowed the nose it was great and got better and had more depth as it warmed, would love to get more bottles of this. thanks PittRooney for the trade"
""
""
"side note: i really like seeing more big beers in 12ozers"
"O - This was very good but missed the mark for me (based on expectation). Needs more body and less carbonation. Mouth feel got considerably better in after about a half hour in the glass."
"O: While certainly not bad, this beer is quite boozy and the bourbon is in your face.  I also wish there was more roasted malt and dark chocolate present. Maybe I'll wait a year and re-review."
""
""
"O: I don’t want to say I was surprised by this beer, but I was overly impressed. I remember the original being pretty good, but not great. Barrel ageing the original is definitely an improvement. Thank you so much for the pack, Michael!"
"Overall: It reminds me alot of a Barrel aged Milk Stout brewed with coffee. Its just not a really strong flavorful barrel aged beer. Its a solid beer that has decent complexity, but I was underwhelmed by the nose, taste, and mouthfeel of this beer. Even though I was fairly critical on this beer, I still did enjoy drink this beer. My recommendation is to drink this beer at room temperature because this beer really needs time to open up so you can get the most enjoyment/flavor out of this beer. I am also thinking that this beer might be better to drink fresh."
"Overall just an amazing beer."
""
""
""
"O- A pretty damn tasty stout, it's not the most extreme or in-your-face, but the flavors are delicious and well-balanced."
"O: A very good beer. This was the first time I had had this in its bottled form (living in Cleveland, it isn't too hard to get some on draft around release time). I like the fresh bottle a little more than the fresh tap. A little more balance, not as much alcohol presence (though there is still some). Not quite as good as some of the elite BBA stouts like BCBS, but a great beer nonetheless. The Ohio 12% cap on abv probably does not help Great Lakes in this respect, but they turn out amazing beer anyway."
""
"Sampled at Snallygaster 2014. After waiting many years to try this legendary brew, it totally lived up to the hype.  Wow. Tons of coffee, some chocolate and bourbon.  So smooth and delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great stout...very underrated...glad I had 2, but I will be drinking the other soon."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and thick with carbonation being low. It's a really great mouthfeel for the style. Overall it was a great beer. The bourbon was really bold and flavorful in it, but the base beer also got to shine through. All the flavors really came together very well in it. I can't wait to see how this one develops with some age on it. Great beer overall."
"I know I gave a perfect to Siberian Night, but this is a totally different monster. I prefer both Blackout and BA Blackout to Siberian Night. Im scared of this beer for good reason, its scary good."

"a very good barrel aged impy stout, but the bourbon is very strong with it being so fresh which might be a turn off to some and it does come off a bit thin. i think age will greatly improve this beer as it didnt really seem to live up to some of the older vintages ive had in the past."
""
""
"O: I am rating this very high. This is a solid A for me. So drinkable. Love it. I just wish I had another!"
""
"O: Average barrel aged stout. Not my favorite by any means as it missing the heavy, sweet flavors I love in this style."
""
"OVERALL: I’ve never had this beer fresh, but at this point, the ’09 vintage has probably mellowed out as much as anyone would want. The nose has probably started to tail off, but the flavors are still bold enough to showcase how well everything has blended and come together. If you’ve got a bottle this old, do something with it, as it’s probably not going to get any better. A very nice balance between barrel and base beer on this one, which we can’t say about every bourbon barrel stout. This one still suffers from a thin body and average feel, but otherwise, it is an enjoyable beer for sure. Thanks again for the trades guys!"
"Great stout which will benefit from time. 2012 vintage is boozier than previous vintages I've had. Age this one!"
""
""
""
""
"O - So glad I have this beer. Best BA stout I've had to date. Can't wait until next year to buy more!"
""
"Overall: Certainly this is a delicious and excellent feeling BBA stout. I appreciate the mellow bourbon notes in both the nose and the taste. So many BBA stouts are overpowering in all respects. This is just right. FYI I find this bottled version superior to the draft version for whatever reason. Obviously as a BBA stout, this is a sipper, and the high ABV would limit me to one or two of these in one sitting. 4.5"
""
"o - overall, wow...really a wonderful BA stout. have had this a few times before, but gotta say it is certainly top tier for BA stouts. worth checking out."
"Full bodied with good carbonation, this beer is a creamy delight. The body is rather sticky and very coating but is not syrupy in the least. The carbonation never really presents itself as fizzy but can definitely be noticed in the creaminess of the mouthfeel. This is definitely one easy-drinking RIS."
"*This beer pairs extremely well with chocolate. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
"mouthfeel is a touch lacking. still a solid beer."

"O: A fantastic bourbon barrel imperial stout with very unique flavors. I really enjoyed how mellow the bourbon was. It allowed the other flavors to really come through significantly. This was a very unique bourbon barrel stout experience. Great Lakes did a great job with this. I'm glad I have a couple more bottles of this to enjoy."
""
"O: This is outstanding. I love how the flavors came through and everything melded together very well. It isn't a huge ABV but the alchol was masked very well. Great BA stout."

"O- Excellent beer, very well crafted and awesome seeing how balanced this base beer can be with extra love."

""
""
"4 pk. = $32"

"This beer is full bodied and VERY amazingly creamy. Carbonation is just right. Even though bourbon is a strong characteristic of this beer, the alcohol burn associated with it is very mild and very pleasant. Warming. Perfect for a cold evening."

"Strong flavored beer with generous attributes given by the barrel. It was technically an extra I didn't pay for, but I'm almost certain it's worth the price. There's so much flavor and it definitely rivals an aged BCBS (which is way too alcoholic when fresh). I would have liked a little more body, but it's not worth complaining about."

"This is a very good barrel aged RIS! The barrel aging isn't overpowering. It is noticeable and wonderfully complimentary to what the base beer seems to be. Tom/trxxpaxxs, thank you so very much for being so generous as to send this to me, among many other great beers, in the N00B BIF Round 5! Your generosity is STILL a bit unbelievable to me. You are the epitome of a great BA! Cheers to you, my friend!"

"Amazing! On my want list for nearly a year and find it on tap at South Park Tavern!! Great Lakes selected SPT for 2 kegs tonight. First one tapped at 4p, gone by 6. It is everything I had hoped for. Smooth, sweet, little/no hop bite, bourbon flavors. A refreshing, sipping beer ... world-class. A halo beer."
""
""
"O - A very good take on the style. I enjoyed it but compared to say...bourbon barrel plead the 5th, which I had only a short time before this, it just doesn't compare. I wouldn't turn it down in the future, thats for sure."

"2010 bottle split with Josh. Pours black with a small tan head. The nose is nice - milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, bourbon. The taste is a mish mash of bourbon (w/ vanilla and oak) and smaller amounts of bitter chocolate/coffee. The bitterness in the finish is just a touch much for me in that it winds up being a touch acrid. The mouthfeel is really nice and smooth. Overall, this beer was good, but not nearly as good as when I had it on tap at the Great Taste. Will be happy to try this one fresh."
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly, highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks Matt!"
"It pours the darkest of browns in color, full in body, with a slight beige lacing around the glass. The aromas consist of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and toffee. It has a great nose for a bourbon barrel aged stout, with nice complexity. The flavors feature an array of flavors. You get a good amount of roasted malt up front, sweetened by vanilla, bourbon and toffee. It has phenomenal flavor. The bourbon is just the right amount. It drinks very, very smoothly and has great flavor. For a RIS, and a bourbon barrel aged version at that, it has amazing drinkability. It drinks a little fine but it really is fitting. This is a phenomenal beer, phenomenal. I love it. I'm eternally grateful for this bottle."
"Edit: After reading other reviews, I see it is indeed bourbon barrels. I'm shocked. I really don't get bourbon. Maybe this one's not just flat...but flatlined? But how wouldn't I get more nose? Perhaps I started too cold. I suppose I get it more as it warms, but I do not get a well-blended bourbon beer. I smelled goodness, and can get some of that (goodness), but for me the good bourbon has left the building."
"Highly drinkable BA Impy Stout but not incredibly complex in the flavor/aroma."
"Pours an opaque black. Little head is noticed and almost no lacing. Not an awesome looking beer, but the smell switches your senses. Smell is sweet bourbon and chocolate. A small hint of vanilla from the barrel. Taste is right on par with the nose. Notes of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and dark fruit. Beer has a perfect texture and has carbonated perfectly. A small burn from the alcohol makes this one a nice sipper. What an amazing beer. Blackout Stout is one of the best RIS I have had the luxury of trying and adding a bourbon barrel to it makes it an awesomely different experience. Would like to try this side by side with the regular Blackout Stout."
"5.0 D: Great Lakes has only disappointed me once. Everything else I've had has been world class and this is no different. This beer epitomizes balance between the beer and barrel and uses a stellar recipe and perfect technique. Excellent beer."
"Overall pretty pedestrian for a sought after barrel aged stout."
"O- This is my 3rd experience with this beer. All three times it has been an exceptional, stand out-BA RIS-one of my favorites in the category for sure. Its got a lot of everything with an exceptional blend. Great brew put together by Great Lakes."
"O-Great brew especially for an RIS, loved this one great blend of everything."
"Overall pretty dam solid. As it warms even mild licorice and molasses creep in making for one classic enjoyable drink. I would certainly partake of this beverage any day!"
"Drink- I loved the bottle I had of the base beer. The pour I had at CF7 really was that much better."
"O- I’ve wanted to try this beer for some time. This beer was one of the beers on the top of my list to try at this year’s festival. Really well balanced Bourbon barrel aged stout; I will for sure seek out a couple of bottles of this gem."
"Fellow BA and friend dtx00 traded this, appearance was pitch black nearly opaque with a big foaming tan head. I must say this is awesome stuff, just like the regular version. Aromatics big oak barrel whiskey aging effects hints of vanilla/toffee and oak going strong, a touch of anise and dark chocolate/coffee roasted malts with a hint of cherry fruitiness going on. Flavor is layered with a balanced whiskey barrel aging and rock solid big stout flavors, probably the most drinkable version out there beside fresh KBS. Again big alcohol but not overly boozey, just some whiskey barrel aged vanilla/charred oak/and hints of cherry to go with a big ol' stout from Cleveland. Dark roasted malts bring out some dark chocolate notes but not much in the way of strong coffee tones. Mouthfeel is full bodied defnitely warming and even carbonation some versions are almost flat this one had enough bubbles flowing to make each sip easy going on the palate. Overall excellent version above and beyond qauality and definitely highly sought out amongst our little online community, for a reason!!!"
"O: A fantastic barrel aged beer. Also loved the relatively low (for the style) abv."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown color with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to an oily cap. Random thin streaks and spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, wood, and cocoa powder. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa powder, and slight coffee. There is a definite alcohol warmth felt in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has lower carbonation and is a bit flat with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with some nice bourbon qualities but it's not as good as I thought it would be. I am glad I got to try this one though."
"Poured a black color with a moderate frothy brown head that diminished slowly and produced sticky legs and fair lacing. Good roasted malt, vanilla and woody aroma. Full body with a smooth texture. Complex sweet chocolate flavor with a sweet smooth woody finish of long duration. Very well balanced barrel stout."
"O - Blackout stout was not one of my favorites RIS. The barrel did wonders to this brew. Quite nice, very enjoyable"
"O- the name of the game here is balance. The barrel weaves its way in and out of the base beer with elegance and grace where so many other are being bludgeoned to death. Its got enough punch to get the job done but smooth and subtle at the same time. I like blackout but I love ba blackout."
"Im glad I tried it and this is one that lives up to the hype. Im sure the two years in the bottle helped alot. This was all too easy to drink like a fish."
"The flavors are best in show here, good stuff. If this got a bit more body, and a bit more aromatics, it would be more awesome...er."
"O - a great BBA stout that I've been wanting to try for a good while now. Thanks again Chad!"
"O - A fantastic brew all around, the barrel in this is nuanced, not hot and over-the-top like some others out there. Fantastic!"
"Chewy, viscous body with a flavor profile that's similar to the aroma. Lots of dry, toasted earthy oak/wood flavor up front that is countered by a very roasted dark malt presence. Hints of bitter dark chocolate, burnt toast, oatmeal and deeply roasted coffee bean. A bit heavy on the roasted side for my liking resulting in a slightly acrid/burnt flavor but there is enough sweetness to balance things out. As the palate adjust, this becomes less harsh and the maltier, especially chocolate, notes start to come forward. Some alcohol sweetness but not much heat at 9.5%. Slight warmth n the finish. Very good!"
"O: This was a simply outstanding barrel aged RIS. I love regular Black out and this just took it to another level. I may have to plan a road trip for the next release."
"Pours a nice d ark reddish brown with a decent amount of head. Light brown head that is a fairly minimal. Smells slightly fruity and very rich and malty. Nce and chocolatey with a solid bourbon presence. A very subtle banana on the tongue as well. A bit strong and boozy but very tasty. Overall a top notch beer"
"O-nicely suprised with this brew. Great offering from great lakes"
" Awesome. This is great. It's so easy to drink because of the body and balance, but has none of the normal issues with a lighter bodies imp stout (astringency, tannin perception, being 'hot')...I like it. I've never had it before, and I'm glad I drank it for brunch today instead of including it in a trade (almost did)."
"Overall, BA Blackout comes across as a fairly average BA RIS. Nothing here really makes me want to come back to the glass and the ABV is not enjoyable. I wasn't a fan of the regular Blackout stout, so maybe it's not a surprise that I'm not a huge fan of this one. Maybe other vintages have been better, but this most recent release is not worth seeking out."
"Overall it's pretty good. I am always amazed at the variations of RIS offered. This one is somewhere in the middle of all those."
"D: I'm a little disappointed by this year's release. I had multiple bottles of the '09, including one as recently as two months ago, so it's not an embellished memory in my head. This year's changed, and it's not as synchronized to my palate as last year's was. It's still a good beer, just not a great one. I seem to be the most apologetic about it, as a bottle split 3 ways left more than 16 oz in the bottle. This one really didn't win over our tasting group as much as last year's."
"D: I wasn't a big fan of the regular version but that was delicious. In some ways, this reminded me of Kate the Great - not quite as complex or easy drinking but the flavors are pretty spot on. Two thumbs way up"
"(D)- A great barrel aged stout. It really has taken on the qualities of the oak and bourbon to its core and has meshed well with the overall base beer. Sweet and rich with an overall oaky dryness. Some good stuff right here."
"Shared during a small Charlotte BA tasting with marine1975, caSSino, CarolinaKevin, and GehenHerzog. Big thanks goes out to sproser (Secret Santa '10 BIF) and my boy Lunch for allowing me to have multiple bottles of this beauty! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured black with a one finger light tan head that remained throughout. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, wood, slight smoke, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was definitely a great brew. Very smooth flavor going on here that made it very easy to drink. 9.5%!? This could have gotten me in trouble for sure. The aroma on this one was not slacking either. A definite must try and I'm glad I got to share this with some local BAs. This was the highlight of the tasting for me..."
"Luckily the smell translates perfectly into the taste as this beer is all about chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. A little bit of roast, but this is a prime example of a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Nice and thick with low carbonation. I would have no problem drinking quite a few ounces of this, but my body would probably start to hate me more than it already does."
"D - A nice beer, and my first I believe from Great Lakes. Maybe I should try to get my hands on a 2010 version and see if it differs. One bomber was more than enough for me in one sitting."
"Overall it's thinner with more burnt and smoke flavors than I like in my stouts, but still a decent barrel aged stout."
"Since ""drinkability"" is now ""overall", it gets a higher score. After all, would I like more? Of course. But could I have more? No, no I could not."
"O: Although this is a solid BA stout, it is not near the top of the list. I liked it, just didn't love it. The overcarbonation was the brews downfall. Skal."
"D - So glad I got to try this one. An amazing stout."
"M: Heat is diminished, drinkability flourishes. An easy sipper, surprisingly gentle on the palate. I'd be interested to compare year-aged versus fresh, but that's for another day. Well done, GLBC."
"Have had this years vintage in the bottle as well and it is shaping up nicely."
"D: This has exceptional drinkability for a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Lots of flavor, ABV goes undetected. Great brew!"
"D- This beer drinks with a smoothness that a lot of BA beers wish they had. The ABV limits this beer of course but the flavor makes it hard to put down. The blending of the barrel and beer is hard to beat and I can see why this has the praise it does."
"D- Moderate. b-bal stouts are a dime a dozen these days, but it takes more than a barrel and a stout to make a good beer. This one is just that- a (very) good beer. I would not hesitate to drink this one again. Impressive."
"D: Too brash and in-your-face on the barrel aging for my tastes. Maybe this beer will improve with age, maybe the bourbon qualities will tone down and reveal a more subdued and complex beer. I don't know, but in it's current state, it was just too much for me to consider overly enjoyable."
"This pours a dark brown with a beige foam. Distinctively lighter in color than most beers of it's genre. The aromatics are a little on the bourbon side with some caramel malt mixed in. This is apparently still a pretty hot beer. The taste confirmed the punch of the bourbon, but the oak and the vanilla helped calm down. Interestingly the roast and chocolate flavors were secondary to the bourbon barrel notes. This was a tad astringent still, but not too much to not really enjoy this beer. It was a pleasure drinking this beer, and it goes to show GLBC can make good beer. Why they don't do it more often, I can't say."
"And it's great."
"M,D: This beer sticks to the palate, and is delicious, one large bottle enjoyed with friends is plenty but, I would have one every night if possible."
"D - Drinkability is high. While at first the alcohol is certainly present, it cools off and melds perfectly with the rest of the beer. I sipped this over the course of an hour and a half and was happy the entire time."
"Cheers!"
"650ml bottle, aged for one year. Poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Pours near black, nice head. Notes of bourbon, oak, chocolate, caramel, molasses and vanilla. Good, but lacks complexity. Body a bit thin for teh style. Decent stout, lacks depth."
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF #4. It pours a slick, oily black-brown topped by a relatively short-lived finger or so of khaki foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, buttercream, caramel, and molasses. On the tongue, chocolate and oak kick up the most dust, followed by whiskey, roasted malts, and a smidgen of vanilla bean.The body is heavy, but still in my medium range, with a light carbonation and a very smooth, lightly chewy feel. Overall, definitely better than the normal Blackout and a damn fine and tasty stout generally-speaking. Great times."
"This along with BA BORIS are a couple of my favorite Barrel Aged beers. This is a beer to sit and enjoy - concentrate when you have this one in your glass - it pays dividends."
"D - Definitely one of the best imperial stouts I've had in a while. Smooth, rich, tasty, and with noticeable barrel character. World class."
"M/D - Very smooth, buttery mouthfeel that makes this beer a pleasure to drink. Overall, a great example of bourbon barrel aging."
"D: One of the easiest drinking -bal aged imperial stouts that I've come across, this is a completely different animal compared to the regular blackout stout which I wasn't a huge fan of. Not fantastically complex but it has all the sweet, roasty, bourbony character that I need. Well worth searching out and I can't wait to see how this one develops."
"Drinkability: The bourbon barrel aging helped to further the complexity of an already solid beer. This is nice, sweet, and smooth. Even with more flavors, I am not sure if I find this remarkably better than the regular Blackout Stout, which is a solid beer to start with."
"this beer is a little lighter mouthfeel, but it works well, could easily have drank the whole bottle of this beer"
"Mouthfeel is medium to thick yet smooth with some heat.The drinkability is pretty high for me, I enjoyed the beer a lot."
"Overall impression, BA Blackout: Doesn't measure up to the regular version. It seems to me that drier, roastier stouts are the ones that respond best to barrel aging. Perhaps this one will age gracefully, but I won't seek it out again. Fans of sweeter stouts should definitely check it out, though."
"All this comes through in the flavor, plus a dose of bourbon, very good. I love this beer, one of my favorites in bottle form and very good from the keg as well."
"D: Well, this beer is by no means bad, but it's not all that exciting either. I would have this again, but probably won't seek it out."
"Honestly, I am a bit bummed with this one; it's sorely lacking integration, in my opinion. This is the first time I've had this beer so I have no prior vintage by which to compare. Perhaps some time will put it at ease; then again, perhaps not. As is, it's good but far from great."
"D - very good all around."
"D - Really nice and smooth. This one drinks pretty easy. Nice bourbon notes and great flavors makes this one worth it. Nice that its two years old but it would have been even better in another year. Worth seeking and trying."
"Drinkability: ABV be damned, I would be happy to sip on this all night! Wonderful scents and flavors to match (or even surpass); typically I would rate this bit a bit lower when something is big and prevalent, but it's REALLY exceptional. Also, the thickness in the body is exceptionally thick, and I freaking love that in my stouts. Great Lakes is one of my all-time faves, and this is one of the further reasons why."
"Definitely something I plan on visiting again in the future if I can find another."
"Bottle. Thanks to Peter for opening this one up from the most recent release. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown color with a slight tan head. The aroma is very subtle with slight hints of roast and booze. Medium mouthfeel. The oak is pretty subdued with notes of vanilla. The one thing I would say is that this beer is very smooth and easy drinking. I wish it had more of a oak barrel flavor to it but it does have a fair amount of vanilla flavors. The appearance of this really upsets me, there is no head and no lace, booo."
"I understand the cult following behind this beer. The oakiness melds with the other flavors, creating a smooth and sublime drinking experience."
"So nicely done and not over the top. SteepH20 preferred the Dark Intrigue, while I found this not only to be superior, but a favorite in the style. Fantastic."
"I was really excited to try this but came away disappointed. I had the 09 on tap and it was much better. Would like to try to more to see if 10 just sucks or its just better on tap. This is an above average RIS but a below average BA RIS, doesn't add anything to the beer."
"The verdict: A good beer, one for the cellar. I didnt put myself too far out of the way to obtain my allotment and for that Im glad. As it stands, I wouldnt do much more for some of this. We will stash one and see what it becomes. I have a feeling it will be a late bloomer."
"22oz. bottle shared by Thirstybird. 2009 vintage. Pours 2-3 shades shy of black with zero head; just a few clusters of bubbles. Nose is malty, suggests artificial sweetener and cocoa (reminds me a bit of BA IST). Taste is much better than implied by the nose. There is a suggestion of spirits, but this is not a bourbony BA beer. Flavor profile reveals chocolate, roast and some earthiness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style - body is medium-light with a mild, easy carbonation. All and all, a very drinkable and approachable beer but lacking some of the bolder characteristics of the style."
"Quite good overall, does show it's alcohol a bit which is just fine with me. Just the mouthfeel. Too darn thin. Oh well, if you are looking for an exceptional BA stout that's a little on the thin side this should be your thing."
"Medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Very well balanced and a great example. It leaves a lasting bourbon flavor which might be distracting for some, but I loved it. I would certainly seek this one out to have again. For being 2 years old at this point, it could have aged even longer but if I had bottles of this it would be very difficult to not open them up and enjoy now."
"D: Pretty good for a couple glasses."
"Many thanks to my awesome brother-in-law Dave for hooking me up with this beauty! Pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head that fades quickly. The smell is over the top! Very complex with the bourbon as the star. I'm also getting some dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, espresso, and toffee. The taste is complex as well, with the bourbon once again dominant. Loads of oak and vanilla as well as dark chocolate, espresso, and a hint of cloves. This improved so much as it came to temperature. And the warming of the alcohol was really nice, but well disguised. Extremely smoothe and really scary drinkability, especially considering I had a nice buzz after just one bomber. Definitely one of those rare beers to just appreciate and enjoy slowly. Thanks again Dave!"
"D - Without a doubt one of the easiest drinking Barrel Aged RIS' I have ever had. The ABV is low enough to truly enjoy this great boozy tadting beer without all of the booze. Will certainly enjoy the bombers I brought home with me"
"D - I love this beer. I bought 4 Bombers at the release and kept two for myself, trading the other two. I will be be ageing one in my cellar for a few years. I'm thinking two or three years will produce great things for this beer."
"A bit thinner body for the style, but still pretty full, with nice carbonation and some velvet smoothness. So delicious and drinkable, and not out of control with the ABV, despite being a little warm. I finished a sample, immediately bought a full glass, and still wanted more. One of my favorite barrel aged stouts right now."
"EDIT, 5 November 2010: One bomber left for trading, but in the middle of a couple of trades and job transition, will let you know (especially you guys that msg'd me) if/when I decide to trade one."
"Thick, viscous body, with a bit more carbonation than most of the big stouts. It works, though, and makes this a relatively easy drinking big beer. Overall, I was very happy with this. Well crafted in all respects, one of my new favorites, and I'm glad I'll be able to get it for the next few years!!"
"D: I killed two of them in about a half hour..."
"4.5 / 4.5 / 5 / 4.5 / 4.5"
"Beer is thinner than other stouts I've had recently but it tastes good. There is a nice bourbon character to the whole thing and the sweetness plays off well with the alcohol and the caramel from the bourbon barrel. There may be some mild vanilla in there from the oak but its not dominant at all. Its a good beer, deserving of its place among the middle of the best barrel aged bourbon stouts. I wish it were more available."
"D: A solid beer and good example of the style."
"d - I enjoyed this one a lot, but it was slightly disappointing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great beer, but I don't know how much of an improvement it is on the normal Blackout Stout. We tried BA Sexual Chocolate, Ivan the Terrible, and this in a tasting and I think everyone was in agreement that this was the third in that group. I thought it smelt very good, and again, it is very good and I'd definitely drink it again, but I would try and get another bottle of BA SC or Ivan before another bottle of this."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a thin slight off white head and almost no lacing at all. The aroma is of vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes, with a slight hint of dark fruts present. The taste has a roasted malt backbone with hints of vanilla, chocolate, and oak, also the bourbon alcohol flavor really comes through at the end of the drink. The mouthfeel is low carbonation a little slick and slightly creamy. The drinkability is about average, the bourbon alcohol flavor is not as enjoyable as other ris's. The taste didn't seem as balanced as others."
"one of the best bourbon barrel stouts i have had. very well blended and never over powering in any way. lower ABV than most -bal aged stouts. wish this was available in a 12oz."
"I had high expectations on this one, and unfortunately they weren't really met. A decent barrel aged imperial stout, no more."
"D - Did the entire 22 oz bomber without a problem, and I want more beer. Very easy, course, I might just be an alcoholic."
"Balance is great. This is more subtle than most in the style, but its complexity has me coming back for more."
"Notes: Well, there it is, one of my hometown brewery's flagship artisan beers in a bottle. I think that I prefer the on tap version but this is a treat to be savored by many in the bottled form. This may be elitist but I still prefer the OTHER Bourbon Barrel aged Great Lakes beer, Rackhouse Ale to this one. Anyone reading this should attempt to seek it out!"
"D - Very nicely drinkable. Again, that distinct ash is hindering me a touch but overall, a nice beer."
"Damn, this is excellent. One of my new favorites. I'm definitely going to have to seek this out again."
"D: This is one smooth beer. I can see why everyone talks this one up. I'm very pleased to have an extra in my arsenal."
"If I think this was a little underwhelming, that's only because it's ranked so incredibly high on this site. A little too woody and alcoholic, could use more big gooey chocolate, thick sweet cream and coffee characteristics--the stuff of my favorite stouts--but still a good stout? No doubt about it."
"D-Really great, the whiskey doesn't dominate the beer too much. Really a solid BA stout."
"J"
"All in all, this brew worried me with the look and the smell. I thought this one was going to be a disappointment until I got to the taste! Definitely worth hunting down if you like stouts. Super smooth. Like a finer version of Aphrodite in the taste."
"Drinkability: High, although the ABV felt (I didn't actually taste it) much higher than 9%. One of my favorites for the style."
"D- Like any RIS, your drinkability is going to be lower than some other beers. Again, this would be a one and done beer but only because of the amount of alcohol in there. Other than that this is a good sipper and gives that nice warming effect so it's good for these cold Wisconsin nights."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a wispy shallow off tan head that fades quickly, leaving negligible lacing in it's wake. A moderately intense heavily roasted malt note shares the space with a nice but understated barrel aged character. The mouth feel is medium-heavy bodied, adequately carbonated with a silky smooth texture that compliments the taste REALLY well. Barely enough 'coating' nature to complement the flavors. Full flavored (4.25), moderate levels of bourbon capture your attention while a roasted and 'well TOASTed' thing happens. The feel lacks the substance to complement with enough 'hang time'. The 9% ABV is REAL (..and will kick butt._) however..this one MUST keep on - keep'in on. Many thanks for the opportunity, Kev!!"
"Consumed: 3/17/2010 - 3:30 a.m. (got up early for St. Patrick's Day....this beer will kick of the celebration for me!)"
"D: Top notch. Subtlety sometimes is king. This is the champion of barrel aged subtlety."
"Mouthfeel is both thin and undercarbonated, and this is a less than pleasing combination. The drinkability is okay for the style, and the flavor is good enough to keep you reaching for more, but the lack of carbonation is detrimental to every category except the aroma."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle - 2008 vintage. Uncapped and poured into my snifter. The stout appears an opaque black color with about a finger of dense tan head. Nose and flavors consist of licorice, bourbon, oak, dark and semi-sweet chocolates, some vanilla, more bourbon, dark roasted grains just shy of char, espresso, dark fruits. Certainly approaching full bodied and amply carbonated. Even though the bourbon is quite evident in the nose and taste, there is not much alcohol heat to speak of here. This one is rather drinkable after just a year in the bottle."
"Inky black pour with a small, short lived, tan head. Mildly chocolaty aroma with a hint of dark fruit and bourbon. Rich milk chocolate flavor with hints of espresso, dark fruit, toasted almond, and a nice smoky bourbon kick on the end. The body is wonderfully full, velvety and decadent with soft carbonation. Not immensely complex, but great balance."
"Had at the recent BA tasting at Bailey's Taproom. After having a number of world class imperial stouts, we cracked this and wows were heard around the table. Color is pitch black with a small head, aroma is a bit boozy but pleasant. The taste is a great balance of coffee and barrel flavors balanced by a light sweetness. It was not an overpowering beer, but very well executed and unique."
"I suppose I should try the regular blackout stout before jumping to this one, but oh well, this is what I got in front of me. Well the beer definitely lives up to it's title as being completely black. As was indicated in other reviews, there is not much heading, just a tiny bit of lacing. The nose is dominated by chocolate and bourbon, though there are some traces of dark fruit lingering in there too. Taste is once again, big on the bourbon and dark chocolate, with the alcohol really packing a punch. Mouthfeel is definitely viscous and filling. A few sips of this brew warms the blood quite a bit. This one works well drinking wise if sipped over a long period of time, however the big body and the hot alcohol might make this a beer better to share amongst friends, or family in my case. This beer lived up the hype for me, and I am surprised that it does not get as much recognition. I may look to acquire one or two more bottles, as I can see this beer going from great to world class with a few years of age behind it. Cheers to Mike for sending this one my way."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer! At first the bourbon flavor is so overpowering, I thought I would stick with a 7 ounce pour. But as you get deeper into the drink, it's smooth, rich, and somewhat sweetness make it something i could sip on for hours. It is easily one of my Favorite RIS"
"D- Good drinkability. I think a pint might be my limit due to the bourbon flavor. But this is a great beer and I hope to try it again."
"Overall, wholly deserving of a place among the elite American beers."
"D - This is an extremely smooth RIS...easily in my top 3. Definitely would like to see another bottle of this...have to keep my eye out to trade for more. Alcohol isn't really noticeable, just rich, cream, and roasty. Excellent - highly recommended."
"D - The 2008 vintage is drinking nicely at the moment. The alcohol is hidden pretty well and once detected, adds to the overall flavor. I'm going to wait a while to open a 2009, but I'll add my notes here when I do so."
"If anything, I'd say that this beer is probably under-hyped. It's that good."
"Overall, this is a very very nice barrel aged imperial stout. The original blackout is a classic, so i expected nothing less than excellence here, and they came through. There are better barrel aged stouts out there, but very, VERY few. The complexity is a marvel here, as it changes with every sip, so much going on. Would love to see how this would do with age, I think it would do amazingly well with a couple years on it. Definitely pick some up if you get the chance, excellent beer."
"Drinkability: I could drink this stuff all night long. Flavors intensify nicely as it warms up."
"Overall, one of the big boys. Try this if you can, it's very good and I'd say one of the best barrel-aged offerings out of the state of Ohio."
"Thanks Boatshoes!"
"Perfect. Only my second pure five. Scott & Molly, thank you!!"
"I'm actually surprised to see that this beer is only 9%. I would have guess it was in the 11-13 range, probably because of the heaviness on the tongue which causes the volatiles to just sit and burn away. It really isn't very hot, but it is hotter than it should be. Nonetheless, this is a solid beer but I'm really not sure it should be as highly rated as it is. But that is up for you to decide for yourself....seek this out!"
"Poured into a chalice a black color, some carbonation, not much of a head at all, a couple of tiny islands appear. The nose is malty, with some oak notes, chocolate, toffee, some spice. The taste is malty, nice oak note, chocolate/toffe, with some spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, but not what it's hyped up to be."
"This is a very good bourbon barrel stout with the barrel character coming out aggressively in the taste. Overall, it's a big sweet and smooth imperial stout that's got a bit more chocolate than the typical RIS."
"D: It doesn't really feel like a BIG beer, but there is a slight alcohol flavor and it just doesn't hold up to my expectations for flavor and mouthfeel"
"Overall, one of my new favorite beer. It is really awesome. I am impressed and want more. Very great flavors and extremely drinkable."
"I didn't like it as much as I was hoping to but its a solid brew."
"Overall, a little more bourbon forward then some I have had in the past, but still maintained the subtle complexities of an aged bottle. Incredibly smooth and a perfect fit between BA RIS that have too much bourbon and BA RIS that do not have enough bourbon qualities in them."
"D: Pretty damn high for a RIS, especially a bourbon barrel stout. a fantastic offering."
"The city is enjoyable for a tourist. You wouldn't want to live there, you wouldn't want to drink it constantly as the locals do, it will draw you in. WATCH OUT! It will draw you in, you'll never escape, you'll grow old and red, your world will become an endless dreamscape."
"I hate to give this beer a 3.5 for flavor, but it was just a little too hot. The 9% ABV made itself known early and often. Some time in the cellar would do good, but this is still a damn good beer. It's got all of the elements of a dynamite imperial stout, but just a little too much heat. Will hopefully be re-visiting this one soon."
"Wow. Easily one of the best beers I have tried. You can certainly tell this beer was aged in Jim Beam Barrels. Here in Cleveland they do a Jim Beam tasting along with beer tasting with this special release. Strong bourbon and toasted coffee aroma. Pours black with nice head retention. Bourbon flavors abound a light mouthfeel followed by dark chocolate/coffee like flavors. Beautiful long finish."
"The regular blackout stout isn't bad, but this is truly exceptional. Very well done."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium off-white foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of of well balanced vanilla, bourbon, oak with some deep roasted malt. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some bourbon. Vanilla and deep roasted malt with not one flavor overtaking the other. Body is lightly creamy while being full and carbonation is perfect for style, i.e. about average with no apparent alcohol. Easily drinkable with just enough character."
"Definitely drinkable, although drinking a bomber solo is a challenge. A good beer worth seeking out, but a bit of a let-down based on other reviews. I just really think the liquor is too dominant and distracting. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with a bit of carbonation."
"D - The drinkability for this is very high considering the higher ABV. I could have easily had more of this. Wow. What a fantastic beer. Believe the hype on this one."
"Mouthfeel is fantastically smooth and creamy with very minimal harshness from the alcohol. It hides it's 9% well. Drinkability is great for the style and I will continue to enjoy every sip of this bottle until it runs dry. What a beer."
"Blackout Stout is one of my all time favorite stouts, so when I heard that they did BA I knew that I had to get one. It didn't disappoint, simply delicious."
"D: Very, very nice. Great Lakes can simply seem to do no wrong."
"Pours black but not opaque and surprisingly clear. Smells of whiskey, tobacco and raisins make up the nose. First sip is bitter whiskey with, oak, raisins and other dark fruits dominating the flavor. Hints of coconuts and vanilla add to the beer's complexity. Slightly thin on the body and a little light on the carbonation. Very pleasant indeed!"
"Overall, this is A++. This is the perfect beer IMO."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head recedes promptly, with leggy dwindling lace. Aroma is dark grains, vanilla, and alcohol. Taste is roasty sweetness upfront, barrel character in the middle, and alcohol warmth at the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, almost seems to evaporate off the tongue, and drinkability is very nice for the style. Could stand for a bit more body, but all in all a great offering."
"D: Very, glad I shared it, but is one I could have sipped on for an hour."
"Drinkability is good, I can't wait to get back out to Ohio to pick up some more when it hits. Blackout is one of if not my one favorite ""easy"" to get imperial stout, this is a damn good version of it."
"Drinkability: This is a damn fine brew. It's not over the top in any way, but balanced in every way conceivable - that is to say, very drinkable. The 9% abv is eminently reasonable, and perfectly acceptable for an RIS - I definitely approve. There's really not too much to be said about this one. Enjoy it, enjoy it with friends, enjoy it to its fullest extent. It's a big winner of an RIS, alone or with company."
"Very smooth and rich upfront but a tad thin in the middle and finish, low carbonation. Thinner body as it warms up but it's expected from a BA beer."
"thanks Zapata. true Gem."
"Full bodied, soother than the original as the bourbon notes are more pleasant than the alcohol bite of the original; it is also less charred, a bit less bitter than the original. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla. Still bitter, but drinkability is significantly higher than the original."
"Awesome BA example. I was very surprised by the way the beer seems to hit hard with the bourbon, back off and then hit again with a coffee after note. It was like drinking two beers in one glass. Very enjoyable."
"D: This is an extremely enjoyable beer. Not too thin, not too thick, just about right. The bourbon is balanced by the malt and vanilla and doesn't overwhelm the palate like some similar brews *$*cough*^$ blackops^#...What? Anyway. World glass. Smooth as hell. Seek this out. Lives up to the hype. I'm going to take down this whole bomber and sleep like a baby."
"I really can't think of a better barrel-aged Russian Imperial stout. Top notch, amazing - this should be in the top ten. Don't think for a second this is ""just"" a barrel aged version of Blackout - it is, but MUCH more with the addition of the aging. Recommended..."
"Very drinkable, I could have another one of these!"
"Very dark with faint chestnut edges. Carbonation looked low on the pour, since a very thin light brown cap appeared and I wasn't all that careful. Fine bubbles formed a solid collar. Spotty lacing. Caramel and whiskey aromas, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, malt, light roast. Very nice aroma, lots of character without any single trait overpowering the rest. Roast was more prominent in the flavour and bitterness was solid, yet fairly soft, throughout. Faint hop flavour towards the end. Whiskey and booze gave the palate a tingle from start to finish. Bittersweet and milk chocolate notes, vanilla, drying oak, caramel, dry cocoa in the finish. Fine carbonation, a little on the low side. The body was between medium and full, a little on the light side for a RIS, but this aided drinkability. Plenty of warmth without being hot. Overall, a well crafted and balanced barrel-aged beer."
"Overall: really good"
"i love this beer. and would probably give up a night with olie for another bottle. any takers?"
"Overall: One of those beers that you have to say ""Wow!"" to. The aroma made me excited, as did the taste. A must try...seriously. Cheers!!!!"
"D: This is extraordinarily drinkable for a 9% stout. In fact, I am taking occasional double gulps, like Harry Carey drinking a cool Budweiser after eating barbecued spareribs."
"Black. No real head that I saw. At least it surely didn't last too long. Typical BA imperial stout aromas. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, some roast. Typical BA flavors. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, some roast. Medium body. Silky. Light carbonation. There really isn't much here to set it apart for the rest of this sort. It really reminds me a lot of Schlafly BA Imperial Stout."
"This is a very smooth and drinkable beer. Thanks to Deuane for the sample, this is a top notch RIS."
"I got a 2009 vintage from goryshkewych a long time ago. Thank you, George! largadeer and Arbitrator raved about this particular vintage, but I think it's dropped off since its peak. The nose really does evolve. Initially reminiscent of the 09 Elijah Craig Eclipse with a nice blend of coconut, caramel and vanilla, as it warms up, chocolate, bourbon, oak and milk chocolate (milk duds) appear. In particular, it has a Cheerios-like character that I don't particularly care for. Smooth and boozy, both on the nose and palate, this is quite enjoyable. 4/4/4"
"This is a ""career beer"" for me, meaning that i've wanted to try it for most of my drinking ""career."" Now, thanks to a generous package from kkulacki, I have my chance (thanks, Konrad). Pours black but not overly viscous with a thin light brown head. Lacing is watery and quick. Smells extremely good...lots of chocolate and vanilla, with a rum/bourbon note, forcasting an alcohol filled deliciousness. Deep chocolate malt odor too, I can almost smell the crushed grain. Flavor is equally rewarding...big and chocolaty, with obvious oak and vanilla undertones. Barrel aging has not overwhelmed this beer, but actually improved it (and considerably, in my estimation) No extreme bitterness, just a hint of espresso. Alcohol obvious, but not distracting, on the finish, blending in well with the vanilla and malt. Delicious. Velvety mouthfeel, if a bit thin on the finish. Very, very good. It was worth the wait. Happy New Year!!!"
"3/15/2011: Tried the 2010 batch and found it less impressive than '06 through '09, though it's still a pretty good beer."
"HV"
"Drinkability: I would absolutely love another one these. But if there is one big problem with this beer, it would have to be this beer's availability. It's one of those beers that are only available at the brewery one time a year and at a certain time. If you love thick chewy roasted Stouts or you just like Great Lakes, then this is the beer for you. That is if you can get your hands on one. How did I get my hands on one? I knew somebody who knew somebody, that knowes somebody who went to Great Lakes at the right time."
"D - The bourbon character is fairly subtle here, making this one go down quite easily. Good stuff!"
"The color is almost black and the dark brown head is small. Retention is decent and there is some lacing. Aroma is of chocoloate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, and a very little bourbon. BA Blackout tastes like bittersweet chocolate. There is some coffee but a small amount. The alcohol is noticeable. The bourbon that was absent in the aroma is more apparent in the flavor, but still understated. Finish is bitter chocolate and alcohol. Medium - full bodied with medium carbonation."
"Pours a very dark brown with only the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light. Smallish mocha head dissipates quickly. Smells of Vanilla, oak, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste is bourbon, followed by roast and chocolate, then some alcohol, faint dark dried fruits, leaving a lingering bitter roast and bourbon on the tongue. Yum! Body is medium, mouthfeel is oily/creamy, carbonation is low but appropriate. Great smelling and tasting brew. The only thing I would change is maybe a bit of a thicker body."
"D - Yes. Easy drinking for the ABV."
"drinkability is good. balanced and nice. the barrel character is very nice, but i get the feeling this would be even better with some time in the cellar to let it really mellow and mesh together. looking forward to trying this again."
"Pours a deep opaque black, some brown in the edges, thin light tan head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots, looks like a stout. Smell is crazy, very nutty, bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, some coffee roast, toffee, peanut brittle, nice barrel character, dark fruit, more bourbon, smells great. Taste is great as well, buttery oak, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and coffee, toffee, sweet brown sugar middle, a bit toasty with corn syrup and bourbon in the finish. Really nice flavour. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden but some heat does come through in the finish. Really nice example of bourbon barrel aging RIS, very well done. Thanks Jason!"
"Tastes wet to start with alcohol and cherry-like tang biting in a way that cooperates with the drying edgy bourbon oak. Baker's chocolate, fig newton, iron, and onion underneath the dominant alcohol and oak. Leaves the tongue dry and a lingering rough alochol bite with chocolate edge. Meraganue aftertaste. Alcohol curts the mouthfeel to thin, but some dextrine plays on the tongue when swirled. Moderate carbonation. Bourbon County Stout Light. Very similar barrel and alcohol profile, but not the malt sweet and thick mouthfeel found in one of my favorites. Needs *alot* of time in the cellar for this one to pull together."
"Super jet onyx black with a teeny tiny head of espresso foam that dies qucikly. Aromas of big booze, bourbon, adn wood with some nutty chocolate and coffee undertones. Taset is full up hot bourbon as well as deeply roasted malts and imperial stout notes. Dark fruit also makes an entrance. Mouthfeel is thick but not cloying. Drinkability remains high especially for bourbon lovers such as I. Great!"
"I would love to make it up to GLBC and experience this on draft."
"<i>14/400</i>... Poured an opaque black color with a small, tan head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of vanilla oak, some butter, lots of bourbon, roast, caramel malts, and nuts. Taste of chocolate, some smoke, vanilla oak, roast, some light spices, and finishing with a whisky / alcohol burn. Thin mouthfeel for an impy."
"This was probably the best stout I've ever had. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this heavenly nectar."
"D - Would tire pretty quick, regardless of how good it is."
"Jonathan Passow"
"D- Had this at the pub and drank two of them and it was so easy to drink. I wish I could of made it up there when the bottles were for sale."
"For me drinkability was a bit down since I did not find the alcohol hidden to well. This is evident as the brew warms. Overall however, this brew is fantastic and is a great contender among barrel-aged RIMPs. Another BA that shared this with me suggested that this brew is far superior to the un-barreled version."
"Served in a snifter. Dark almost black in color, rich tan head that lasted some time. Smelled very much of whiskey. Tasted like they had brewed the stout using whiskey instead of water which wasn't a bad thing... whiskey, stout (dark roasted barley) and a hint of coffee were the basic tastes. More coffee presence as the beer warmed. Isn't something you would have more than a glass of as it was 11% abv and to me was more of a dessert/after dinner type..."
"wow, the regular stout is good and worth trying if you get a chance. This release, hands down excellent! I can't say enough my appreciation to EGledhill for sending me this gem!"
"D- Well if your having one which is what I had I would say the drinkability is splendid since it leaves you with a wonderful buzz. however if you plan on operating a motor vehicle that is probably where you'll want to stop. It says 10%, it feels more like12%+ which a person at the brewery said was very possible. This is a fantastic stout any way you slice it and well worth the trip to the brewery to experience it."
"On tap at GL. I've been drinking this at the source about every other day since the release. I've never had a beer whose flavor was so dependent on what I had eaten immediately prior than this one. First day I was disappointed; second I was impressed; third day was also a let down, until I started in on the pretzels, then it was pretty good; fourth day was best of all. So I asked if they mixed the batches or went straight from barrel to keg. Evidently they mix them. So, I rate with an emphasis on the good days. This beer can be impressive. I imagine giving this one some time to mellow out can only help, but the barrel aging surely takes this a step or two about the regular Blackout. So creamy and delicious."
"D-Big and robust...a brew with serious kahones! A beer that deserves more (shhh lets keep it to ourselves) hype. Who cares as long as I can get more in the future."
"The flavor, as the 5.0 rating suggests, was exceptional. Rich, dark chocolate notes covered the palate with a background of earthy hops and vanilla undertones. Bourbon whiskey and oak are saved for the finale, as a spicy, wooden booziness rides out for an enjoyable finish. The body isn't overly thick or viscous, drinking more like a porter. It also wasn't as hot as the normal Blackout Stout, although I would love to see how this stuff tastes after a year or more in the cellar. Overall, a fantastic brew from the solid beer-makers from Ohio. The two glasses I had of this stuff went down dangerously easily, and I can only hope I cross paths with this beer again."
"Been wanting to try this one for awhile and had it side by side with a regular blackout and let me say, this beer was meant for oak. Aroma was a dead giveaway which one was oak aged. The oak aged was a lot more subdued and ""earthy"" than the regular. Side by side the barrel aged doesn't look any lighter than the regular. The mouthfeel of the oak is creamier than the original. There is a definite texture difference, carbonation is weak in both brews but is practically non-existent in the oak aged. This gives the oak aged a softer feel in the mouth. Regular is much more strong in alcohol flavor. This is why this brew is made for oak. The oak aged is smooth with sweetness to match. Alcohol is in the background but never detracts from the flavor profile. (Major weakness of the reg. b/o) Hints of smoke, oak, coffee, and licorice. This is one of the better stouts out there. Better than DL IMO."
"I know that a perfect rating should be really rare, but this beer definitely deserves it. I have never enjoyed a beer this much in my life. Great job, Great Lakes!"
"Overall this is a great way to enjoy an already classic! I love the regular Blackout Stout. Then they throw it in some Bourbon Barrels? Absolutely genius! I definitely plan on making this a yearly ritual. Can't wait to get some more!"
"Pours a deep deathly black letting no light through when held to light. Head is short and short lived but nice for a Barrel aged stout that is three years old. Nose has a distinct mix of bourbon and chocolate that is wonderful. I could just sit and smell this beer all night. Sweet bourbon notes grace the tongue so smooth and consistant. Chocolaty and syrupy without being to heavy. Candied and oh so good flavor profile that just lasts and lasts. A bit of tingling bourbon on the back of the tongue. This brew has aged wonderfully. Mouthfeel is full of rich coco. Highly drinkable, as a matter of fact you dont want the glass to end."
"Overall I thought this was a great BA beer. Not the heavy, dripping with bourbon and whiskey tones that you tend to see sometimes, this was much more subdued, with gentle hints layered on top of an already good beer. I would love to get another one to see how this holds up."
"Black, but brown at the edges with a very light tan head that retains well and leaves bits of lacing. Sweet smell like a coffee with creamer; oak, vanilla, and bourbon is also present. It immediately gives me sweet malt and vanilla flavors. It also has some creamy, lactose notes to it. Roastiness seems rather subdued in comparison to the regular Blackout Stout. Amazingly smooth going down; full bodied with light carbonation. Great beer, thanks go to kmweaver for the bottle!"
"Dark ruby brown color with a small, light tan head. Needs to be much darker. Timid nose, with only a light hint of the barrel element. Thin mouth feel, low complexity and fairly depthless character overall. Some hints of caramel and corn whiskey, but there is hardly much of a beer underneath. This is a rerate of the newer bottling, but its a lot like the first: bland, poorly concentrated, lacking texture and just dull overall."
"Drinkability: Quite nice, Great Lakes, but then again so was your original Blackout."
"I was expecting a lot from this being that I gave up my last bottle of Angel's Share for it, worth all the hype and much better than the standard Blackout Stout from Great Lakes in my opinion, think this is brewed once a year and it is definitely worth seeking out, cannot really go wrong with a barrel aged stout, would love to drink again"
"Great beer overall...definitely worthy of the high ratings. The booziness is strong, but it doesn't mask the other flavors. I much prefer this to the regular Blackout Stout. I have a feeling that a little more bottle aging would do this beer good."
"Cherry boubon mash, guessing Jim Beam (one of my favorites). This thing takes your breath away, in a most enjoyable way. Luvly beer to start (hopefully) spring in 2008."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It definitely leans toward medium bodied. It's still a sipping beer and certainly one to savor. Carbonation is excellent. The mouthfeel is very creamy, smooth, and among the best I've had. Despite its high abv, it's very drinkable. I'm certainly appreciating the one bottle I have very much and am wishing I had more. This is an excellent bourbon barrel stout. It's clearly one of the best I've had the opportunity to try. Kentucky Breakfast Stout is perhaps a slight bit better, but not much. If you have the opportunity to try this one, you certainly should."
"Good, drinkable, another fine beer from Great Lakes brewing."
"Great Lakes Barrel-Aged Blackout Stout combines my second favorite style with my first or second favorite liquor, and is brewed by one of my favorite breweries. How could it fail to be anything less than amazing? Thanks to my brother for securing a double handful of this exceptional ale last autumn. I can't wait until this October when I can replenish my stock. Highly recommended."
"D: If you've got an '06 vintage laying around, it's drinkin' beautifully right now. The alcohol is present but never distracting and the bourbon-stout combo is a revelation."
"Huge thanks to miketd for so generously offering up a bottle of this rarity!! Dark, opaque black pour that holds a light to medium head poured into a snifter. Nose is rich and complex with dark semi-sweet roasted malt, an appropriate and not overwhelming amount of bourbon, and notes of spicy oak and vanilla. Very good job of incorporating the barrell, and not just the bourbon. Flavor is dark and roasty with a good amount of bourbon and a woodsy, light vanilla and almost spiced flavor to go along. Alcohol came into play as it warmed up a bit more than I'd like, but even with that, it was a fantastic beer, and most importantly, the bourbon barrel didn't ruin the beer, but added new complementing flavors. Fantastic."
"A sipping beer here and quit high in alcohol. Not to thick a beer this is quite close to bourbon and coffee with crème in flavor and sensation. Still this is the sort of beer like KBS that is a one a night type of beer."
"I see quite a few outside the Cleveland area have got to try this one. I've never had it in the bottle, only straight from the tap:) It has all the characteristics of the regular blackout to me. I taste dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, and a hint of woodiness. The barrel aged adds the distinct flavor of bourbon, and also intensifies the woodiness. The first couple sips will definitely warm your throat. Probably not for anyone that thinks the average stout or porter is too intense. The only reason I gave drinkability a 4 is because of the abv% and richness, a couple will do just fine. I always look forward to this one every autumn. Overall, a very unique beer that any stout fan that can get their hands on some should try."
"Pours a midnight black with a one finger tan colored head that quickly dies down to an outter ring of bubbles. Thin webbing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is a wonderful blend of roasted barley, carmelized sugar, vanilla, raisins, bourbon, almond, and smoked oak. Sweet aroma overall, extremely enjoyable. Probably one of the best smelling RIS I've ever put my nose to. Smokey caramel malt up front with fresh ground coffee flavors. Bourbon and whiskey sweetness on the tongue from start to finish, but just the right amount. Aftertaste is almost oatmeal stout like with kick. Not the heavy body most RIS have, but for that reason I love the mouthfeel. Slick carbonation that coats the mouth. I really like this twist on the style. I could see some people not liking this because of the almost thin mouthfeel, but to each their own. I'm a bit up in the air as to whether or not age will help this one, but I have an extra bottle so what the hell, let's give it a shot."
"A wonderful drink, and many praises to BuckeyeNation for getting this out to me!"
"This is not the barrel aged stout!... There needs to be a distinction created between the barrel-aged, which is a twelve year process, and simply, the annual ""black out stout. "" I've had both, I was at the brewpub on the 2006 release of the barrel... and i also enjoy it annually. Basically, the age provides the detph you might expect, but eitherway this beer is awesome. I have had both bottles and draft...it'll get you drunk! It's one of the best non-imperial stouts I've every enjoyed... BUT this is first Great Lakes I've reviewed...and (not to be arrogant) but I believe I have a complex beer pallate for a 22 year old, I believe the all Great Lakes beers have such a distinct and acquired/different taste, that once you dig in... your done, it's awesome...must be the water, but hopefully not Lake Erie. Maybe it's the hint of feral snakefish and zebra mussels."
"Delicious, but a bit overpowering by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle. I swear there's some hops in here, as well."
"Pours a thick like motor oil black color with a light brown creamy head that sticks around to leave a fair amount of lacing on the top of my pint glass. Smell is like a cookie with milk chocolate and some dark coffee notes, as well as the roasted malt aroma. Taste is moderately sweet with a bittersweet finish. Medium mouthfeeling with a creamy dry texture, and soft carbonation allowing the bourbon notes to really kick in."
"Pours out black as night with a mohogany hue. Big cocoa head dies slow and leaves sheets of lacing. The nose is big on chocolate, bakers chocolate, a little toffee like note and a hint of bourbon. Taste starts off with big chocolate followed by a long lingering bourbon finish but not boozy. Full in the mouth and a true sipper. A tasty brew."
"Somehow this beer is strangely thin; I would like it to be a bit more full, textured and rich. This does have enough complexity though to keep it interesting. This really needs to be served on the warm side of cool (no where near the 45°F mentioned on the bottle); somewhere north of 60°F / 16°C should do it; at this temperature it picks up a bit more fullness and perhaps a touch more round, malt flavors to help balance things out. Compared to the regular version though, this beer is really missing a lot of malt character & complexity; seems some how heavily filtered (which can actually mechanically happen inside a barrel) and stripped down. Not bad, just not the beer it was originally."
"This is a good beer, but the alcohol flavor, together with the thin watery mouthfeel is a turnoff. I thought it would age better, but I think I liked it better last year."
"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep ebony with a very pretty brown/tan head; the nose is as good or better than any Ive smelled before with sweet carmel, alcohol, and a little bit of carbon (almost the best part of the beer); flavors of chocolate, coffee, csndy sugar and, malt impress upon you a general feeling that you will want more; the body is heavy but not cloying; the finish tells you that it was aged in bourbon barrels and leaves almost the full flavor of the beer in you mouth. This is one fantastic beer, it ties for first in my book."
"22oz Bottle. Rambling aroma of thinning nuts, fire and marshmallow. Coffees come forth, but fade quickly. Subdued and absent. Pours deep brown with ruby corners and a rim of tan. Light carbonation. A machismo of coffee rubs against the grain of background wood and toothy sugars. Chewiness absent. Bright and nostril burning. Fairly dry and not overly heavy. Nutty dry. Smack excels in this beer with a never ending carousel of left over coffee tannins, chocolate dust, chipotle and edges of earth. Thanks for sharing, Andy!"
"D: A richly complex elixir. The multitude of flavors are well balanced and the higher alcohol content is well hidden. Aging did a ton for this brew. Recommended."
"Bottle 360 of 900 from 2006 release. Pours black, an agressive pour yields a very small light to medium tan head that quickly fades. Aroma is somewhat smoky like burnt leaves, a light cocoa sweetness and cola aroma leads into a boozy and woodiness. Some soft sweet vanilla up front in the taste, slightly cola-y before a good bite of alcohol and drying finish. Leaves a nice roasty dry aftertaste with a small bit of tangy acidity. Medium to heavy in body, quite soft on the palette at first, finishes with a decent bite and drying hoppy and woodiness. Very nice beer, love the biting finish and dry roasty aftertaste."
"Actually, if Man was allowed to profess love to a Beer, now would be one of those times."
"22 oz. bomber. 9% ABV. Bottle 51 of 900 from 2006. Big thanks to mcallister for picking this one up for me, and bringing it to me. Pours pitch black with virtually no highlights. Thick frothy mocha head trickles down to 1/2 inch rather quickly, but remains as a nice collar for some time. Roasty, oaky, and vanilla aroma. A bit boozy, bot not overly hot. Roasty flavor up front followed by burtn sugar, caramel, and finishing with a nice chocolate flavor. Throughout, the oak character compliments everything perfectly. The barrel flavor does not overwhelm, but sits in the background to lend a hand. Very smooth mouthfeel, a bit thin, with lower carbonation. Nice amount of sweetness. Warming, but not overpowering. This is a great example of how barrel aging can compliment an already solid beer, without overdoing it. Fantastic. Great Lakes never ceases to amaze me."
"D: I love bourbon beers but this one is on the heavy end. Its really so strong that is masks the beer opposed to ""enhancing"" it. In all honesty, the original Blackout wasn't a favorite of mine so I actually like this one better. But it is off balanced and could be dialed back a bit."
"Smooth roasted dark chocolate in the fore is followed by a heavy bourbon blast which then rolls toward vanilla, roasted/burnt malt and milk chocolate flakes and creamed coffee. It almost seems less intense than the original as far as the base flavor, but barrel aging can sometimes alter beers in odd ways. Id actually say i like this version a bit better than the original."
"Thanks to McAllister for this one."
"excellent beer. served in a classy snifter and oh-so-delicious. i'm priviledged"
"Pours a dense black color and thin layer of lace swirl. Not too much in the nose (this might account for being poured too cold) but faintly detectable notes of chocolate, espresso, and bourbon. The taste is outstanding with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, brown sugar and roasted malts all surrounded by a blanket of smooth bourbon character. Bourbon increases towards the end of the gulp and is even more apparent in the finish along with some sweet, chary, aged oak bourbon barrel notes. Mouth feel is very smooth. This brew is enormously enjoyable and despite its nine percent abv, it goes extremely easily."
"Bottles courtesy of both Sliffy and JSquires. An imperial stout yes, not a Russian. Another good example of a bourbon barrel aged. But I would like some other tastes besides bourbon. The stout is black, the head is off-white and gourgeous with bubbles. There is active carbonation. Seems a slice thinner than the non-barrelled."
"They limit you to three of these at the brewery. After one, I was already feeling it. The second I was a happy camper, didn't attempt to do three. This is a sipping beer."
"Mouthfeel is bit more highly carbonated than I'd prefer. It seems to work against the body of the beer rather than with it. Quite drinkable for what it is, but the snifter was more than enough for me. Kudos to Great Lakes for not going over-the-top with the wood or bourbon flavors."
"At GLBC Restaurant, great place, great atmosphere. I'm not going to bore you with a half-assed description of this beer. You can taste the burbon. The mouthfeel is not overly thick, but the alcohol is there, and the burbon barrel makes it that much more apparent. It's just an outstanding stout. outstanding beer. And I'm not a stout lover."
"Eric"
"Very well done and by far one of my favorites, I only wish this wasn't so hard to come by...."
" Taste has plenty of chocolate-laced coffee. Anise combined with oak and leather. Oh yeah, there's bourbon and vanilla there too. Mouthfeel is quite full, the finish is lengthy. High drinkability for this beer."
"Went down to the brewery again this week to have this limited release on tap before it goes away. Probably the best beer I've ever had."
"This one packs quite the punch. Very warming in the chest. The forefront again is the bourbon flavors as well as toasty vanilla oak. Rich plush mouth with a medium finish of what I'd say is about 40 seconds. The finish mainly consists of strong mocha coffee. A rich creamy middle is consumed with a chocolate covered cherry, black curran, crème brulee, and burnt malts. Entry is a bit thin but it evens itself out. Smooth and viscous overall. The first drink is all the alcohol after that you adapt to this beast. Complex and well balanced. Damn good job by GLBC!"
"Drinkability- Heavy and intense make this one a sipper. Yet I think I could sip way too many of them in one night."
"WAY TO GO GREAT LAKES!!!"
"Mouthfeel is just ever so slightly thin but the rich flavors are still there and very enticing."
"Here I am sitting in my favorite brewery ( Kuhnhenns) enjoying a beer or 2 when a a few other people who rate beer show up. Jsquires goes to his vehicle and comes back with this wonderful beer. talk about being in the right place at the right time. as pailhead said bottle 108. poured black with a light brown head. aroma roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, alcohol. dark fruits, molasses, and vanilla. flavor the same as aroma but more robust and a nice touch of bourbon."
"22oz bottle #68 of 400, courtesy of a colleague who was in the right place at the right time last weekend. Inky black color with a thin dark brown head and quick lacing. Heady bourbon, chocolate malt and coffee aroma. Rich, chewy body with a bourbon character that is not too dominant. Loads of coffee and chocolate flavors underneath, making for an eminently drinkable beer from beginnins to end. The finish is sweet malt and warming alcohol, which I was definitely feeling after a mere 11oz. This is world class stuff."
