3.25,-17.5,3.75,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Bottle. 8.5% abv.  Please note this 2014 batch is well below its apparent historical ABV of 10+%.  Started at 54 degrees.  This stout is all about the hops, which sounds kind of strange, but is true.  It's the first thing I smelled and it was still there at the end.  Taste is not as much, but still there first and foremost.  Hint of chocolate on the backside, or maybe its a combo of the toffee and mocha?  Bitterness is well managed at first but lingers a bit too long on the tongue.  Medium body, slight creaminess.  More sweetness came through at the end.  I didn't think the alcohol was a taste factor.  I certainly did not get the array of flavors some other reviewers seemed to have experienced.  Bottom line: this is a pretty good quality beer, if you like hops.","marieli","Mar 06, 2015"

Third, it's way too sweet for a stout. There's absolutely zero lacing whatsoever. It tastes of a watered down stout with bananas, no alcohol, no chocolate, no coffee, nothing. This was an extreme letdown. I'll try this year's and hopefully it is better, because I'm not very pleased with the 2014 batch at all.","bman13","Jan 25, 2015"

Malt - forward (obviously), but some nice balanced bitterness on the back end. Flavors also opened up a bit with some dark chocolate and smoky character coming out as the glass warmed.

Perfect thick mouthfeel. The flavor is very roasty. Coffee and burnt carbon with a perfect amount of hop bitterness.

Aromas of coffee and booze forward, with old world fruit sweetness, woody notes, and an underlying coffee bitterness. Beast. Flavors are a blast of rich sweetness on the tongue, with black strap molasses leading the charge, followed by cocoa nibs, bitter coffee, vanilla, oak spice, and a ribbon of booze. Holy hell, this is big! Smooth and velvety in mouth, with a rich, darkly sweet aftertaste of molasses and brown sugar. Slick, smooth finish.

There is nothing complex here but at the same time it's pretty inoffensive for the alcohol content and would be an excellent beer to introduce to someone who doesn't care for stouts. Its one of those rare stouts that I like less as it warms up. I love Avery especially some of their earlier sours and Uncle Jacobs. I'd pick this up again. It's right on par with the other stouts that I can get for $8. It did sit on the shelf so that could be factored in but not too much.","putonyourwalkingshoes","May 31, 2014"

This almost drinks like a port, but it does contain a chocolate character that is strong, pungent, and memorable, to its credit.

Aroma has some grainy hops to it but is mostly a hodge podge of roasted malts along with some bitter cocoa and toffee, as well as some figs or plum (very minor). Heavy bodied, a little chewy even as there's some breadiness, the hops offer a little dryness and tag with the alcohol for a very dry finish with a little harshness which is a shame. I say that b/c this beer has the requisite sweetness I like the figs (dark fruit), toffee and sticky chocolate notes and a good balance of roasted malts with some coffee elements thrown in so it's not overly sweet. Overall, I liked this beer a lot but just didn't care so much for the finish b/c after awhile it's wearisome.","clayrock81","Dec 07, 2013"

It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, and a twinge of toasted molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, but the roast is deeper, the chocolate is darker, and there's a strong current of bitter darkness, like treacle mixed with strong coffee and booze. It becomes a bit much over time. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a solid impy stout, though the roast is a touch strong for its own good. Still, I'd gladly take another.","TMoney2591","Jul 26, 2013"

That moderate insubstantiality hurts it in my view, unfortunately offsetting the effect of its flavorfulness. I'll want to get another and see if a year does anything to it.

They did what Avery does best: make it very sweet and very alcoholic with a backbone of one delicious flavour at the forefront of the beer. It's not especially complex, but it works. I do feel that stouts are supposed to be very complex to be truly exceptional, so this one lags behind the true champions in that way. Chocolate malt seemed to dominate the flavour profile of this, which went surprisingly well with the flavour of Avery's unusually delicious yeast, which adds a very fruity flavour to their beers. This was supremely yummy. Thanks again, Avery.","ElCommodoro","Mar 27, 2013"

I feel like there's something else buried in there too but I can't quite identify it. Maybe some toffee? The taste is great. There's notes of anise, chocolate and coffee all at once but they push each other back and forth and weave in and out. I wanna say chocolate into coffee then it dives into anise and kicks back to the coffee (almost a mocha flavor) before it fades into anise and a bit of alcohol heat. The after taste is mostly roasted malts and coffee. The mouthfeel is substantial but not overwhelming. The heat sticks around in the pit of the stomach, it would definitely be nice on a cold night. I don't remember what I thought of this when I tried it years ago but right now its pretty fantastic. Thanks Whole Foods for doing my aging for me ;-)","DonDirkA","Sep 23, 2012"

The flavor is fairly similar. There is a little bit of warming from the alcohol, but what really stands out is a big, bold chocolate character with some roasted malt. There is a good bit of sweetness from the malt, as well as some dark cherry and prune notes. Thick, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice imperial stout, which is drinking very well with 2 years of age on it.","Mora2000","Jun 24, 2012"

The nose doesn't showcase roasty malts like I'm use to, it's almost geared more towards a Belgian quad than a stout. Big, boozy dark fruits, some yeasty bits, smells tasty. And it is.

Flavor is intense and sharp at first, tapering to a dark and caramel malt background and an nice hop bite. Alcohol is well muted.

Pours very dark brown, almost pitch black color; with a nice 1 finger dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice lacing sticking on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, roasted malt, toasted biscuit, herbal spiciness, and light coffee. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, dark fruit, raisin, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, biscuit, toast, herbal spiciness, and earthiness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of a lot of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, chocolate, and roasted malts on the finish for a while. Some nice flavor balance; with not cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fauirly creamy and slick mouthfeel. This drinks very smoothly for almost 12%; with only a slight alcohol warming after the finish. Overall this is a great Russian imperial stout, with good complexity and balance. It has been a while since I last had this; but the dark fruit flavors are definitely more prominent after the aging. I will have to pick up a fresh bottle from this year to compare and see how it changes over a long period.","superspak","Feb 17, 2012"

I expect big things out of these expensive “designer” beers packaged in the bomber format, and got mixed results with this one. The Avery Maharaja and Salvation were outstanding, but this review is of the Czar. When pouring this beer into a glass, it is not pitch black as other stouts I have tried recently, some glimmer of light shines through. The head is thin, but off-white rather than the deep brown of other offerings in this category. Good and plentiful aroma meets your nose with notes of molasses, toffee and coffee grinds. Lots of flavors working together in this stout, but the predominant ones are of molasses, rock candy, and bitter chocolate. The alcohol is there in a good way. The Avery Czar, a great stout in so many ways, was just a bit too sweet for my tastes. Maybe cellaring for a few years can tone down the sweetness, but I am not into aging beers, there are too many out there ready to go.","iSip","Feb 06, 2012"

4.11,4.3,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black in color with a thin cocoa head. Head quickly disappears. Great lacing on my snifter considering the 10.57% ABV for this vintage. The nose is very, very weak to me. I get chocolate, malt, molasses, coffee, and slight hops. It's pleasant smelling.. but I almost get nothing out of the nose. Multiply it by 5 and the score would be in the 4- 4.5 range. Maybe the weakest smelling RIS I've come across. Thankfully, the taste is another story. Big chocolate, coffee, malt, molasses, and hops flavors that come across smooth and creamy. Really floored that I don't get any of the 10.57% alcohol in the taste- not even a little bit. The feel is sublime- almost like a liquid chocolate brownie sundae. Super smooth.... Overall, this is a solid beer that severely lacks in one category. I would drink this again though, but not smell it again. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Jan 16, 2012"

The smells are of molasses, very sweet, and dark roasted malts. The feel is medium to thick. The taste is a little different, very sweet at first, loads of molasses and then I get a nice bitterness from the roasted malts, but with all the sweetness this almost reminds me of a barleywine / irs hybrid.","DavidST","Dec 29, 2011"

I dug my nose in there and smelled a wave of dark fruits and molasses, reminiscent of a dubbel. The taste is more of the same with an addition of dark chocolate and hot hot booze. These fruit and chocolate flavors pop out more as the beer warms, along with notes of vanilla and licorice. It's pretty heavy on the tongue and moderately carbonated, which I think is works great for Czar. A fantastic brew overall and a real pleasure to drink.","Jawn","Dec 27, 2011"

2.81,-28.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,4,3,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty average RIS, I was expecting a strong and roasty RIS and what I got was more like the combination of an RIS and Barleywine, more Barleywine like flavors came through in the taste then RIS flavors and that was a little disappointing but it made for a unique tasting and liquor like beer. This beer doesn't have good drinkability, between the high sweetness, booze, and bitterness I was glad the bottle was split three ways, taking out the whole thing might become a chore after the second glass. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just what and RIS should be like. What I liked least about this beer was the heavy Barleywine like presence, I like my RIS's roasty and robust and it seems like a lot of Barleywine flavors drowned out that roastyness and the booze could have been hidden better. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it just isn't what I think of when I want a nice RIS. This may be worth a try to see where you stand on a hybrid of a Barleywine and RIS, but the I don't think the aroma and flavor are anything to brag about. In the end it was nice to try but it really isn't my kind of beer, I would have much preferred a more straightforward and traditional RIS. Avery really tried something different with this beer and when it came together it's a little all over the place, so far my least favorite brew from them and not a very note worthy RIS.","StoutHunter","Dec 26, 2011"
4.06,3,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, the best thing about this brew is the rich and chocolate aromas. The fruit inclusions are also nice, in both the taste and aroma. The look could have been a bit stronger, and the hops advertised are not as present as they could have been, but then again this beer has been aging for three years, so it’s to be expected to some extent.","TheBrewo","Dec 26, 2011"

Somef earthy bitterness puts up a bit of a fight in stead of the retreating roast, but the sweetness is thisclose to overpowering. This sweetness isn't even of chocolate; it's mainly brown sugar and molasses. Moderate thickness.

Chocolate layers the front tounge. Mixed dark and milk chocolate notes are followed with some robust coffee and roasted notes. There is a tinge of earthy bitter in the middle with a grassy hoppy character that is followed with a hint of licorice. Slight burnt, ashy notes.

The flavor was of roasted malt, caramel, slight chocolate, and big alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this thing was amazingly boozy. I was honestly shocked upon my first sip with the flavor of booze in this one. The aroma did nothing to prepare me for what I was about to experience.

As far as I can tell, Avery brewed a perfectly fine English barleywine, then got the labeling screwed up somehow. On the other hand, the ingredients did list flavors of English toffee and spices on the RIS label, so maybe the taste profiles got mixed up in the handbook? Regardless, at best this is an American Strong Ale with a touch of roasted malt thrown in for giggles, but to call this an imperial stout is not only a huge stretch, it's a, well, yes, a huge stretch. If this had been called "The King Barleywine" I would have known to steer clear. As an imperial stout, however, this one isn't even close.

Inhale the rich chocolate malt, that is quickly followed by noble Hallertau hops offering a spicy and floral aroma and a slight twinge of alcohol at the end. Flavors redolent of English toffee, rich mocha, sweet molasses, along with some sweet roasty malt, a hint of candied currants and anise. This brew is surprisingly smooth and fairly easy to drink when you consider the, if you forgive the pun, stout 12.2% abv.","JMC_TM","Feb 19, 2010"

After delicately peeling the tin foil off the cap, I carefully poured it into the glass so as not to get any of that annoying foil in the beer. It pours a rich dark ruby red to brown with about three fingers of soapy, foamy, long lasting tan head. The aroma has a burnt sensation made up of a dash of molasses, malts, and fruity esters. However there is also a noticeable alcohol aroma due to the 11% ABV. The mouthfeel remains heavy and creamy on the tongue. The tate starts out strong with sweet molasses, toffee, and hops but ends more mild. It is a gratifying Impy Stout that you can enjoy slowly.","puboflyons","Jan 30, 2010"

Its bones are solid, but its flesh is curvaceous and full-bodied, perfectly proportioned, and a joy to savor. I love this beer. The Czar shows that Avery has mastered the (sometimes lost) art of roasting a malt without destroying it, leaving intact the wonderful sweet complexities that would be obliterated by a few more degrees. There is valid discussion that The Czar is unlike other RIS's, and this is an accurate observation. I have based my review upon how this beer presents itself to me, not strictly what it is labelled as. I enjoy this beer, and I am hard-pressed to think of a way it could be improved upon.

Dark roasted barley, chocolate, caramel, and roasted nuts also make a nice addition to the complex aroma of this beer. The Alcohol comes out as a spicy peppery aroma, there is some bitterness from the hops as well. My first sip of this beer is magical. This beer is extremely smooth with a large malty sweet flavor up front. Again honey, plums, raisins and figs make an appearance. There is also a good amount of bitterness to balance all those sweet fruity flavors. Hints of charcoal, burnt toast, and pine bitterness.

Full-bodied, however, the carbonation adds a violent swirl which breaks up most of the overall solidity. Minty and floral at first, actually beats the cocoa powder, ground coffee and caramel to the punch. Elevated grains, straw and bread crust elements, adds a drying touch. There's concentration but not much sweetness found in the plum, prune, raisin, cherry, apricot fruit. There is a slight astringent booziness in the texture.

The aroma is dominated by fruitiness with very little dark malt character. The aroma reminds me of a combination of Granny Smith apples and ripe pears. It's a pleasant aroma, but not at all what I expect in an IS. The taste has a malty/fruity sweetness upfront followed by a lingering (but light) roastiness in the finish. It seems to be a bit boozy, and the mouthfeel is a bit thin for an IS. Sadly, it's really lacking in the dark, roasty, malt character one expects in a stout or impy stout. I find this brew to be quite drinkable, but it doesn't remind me of an IS at all. Instead, it's more like some sort of dark, somewhat sweet, fruity, strong ale. I'm rating this brew as an imperial stout, and thus my ratings aren't that great. However, "as a strong ale", I would have rated this higher...such is one of the problems when rating beers. Do you rate to style or just overall pleasure? If I order apple pie, but get blueberry instead, am I disappointed? They're both types of fruit pies (and I might like both flavors), but I asked for apple, I was in the mood for apple, and they said it was apple.

Smooth and delivering a nice blend of flavors backed by a delicate and devilishly smooth mouthfeel. Really enjoyed this one. Not sure how a fresh bottle would compare, but with age, this is quite a nice RIS to enjoy. With age, could this compete with some of the best of the best RIS? Perhaps. I think this bottle proves that The Czar is mighty fine with some age on its side. In the overall picture, however, The Czar probably falls just shy of RIS greatness - there are other examples that are better in each of the rating categories.

Sheets of lacing formed during the tasting, but had weak legs, leaving only residual specks. Nose was cocoa, malt, hops and alcohol. Taste revealed mocha flavors with some alcohol astringency and a kiss of hops bittering at the back end; perhaps a hint of char. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and slightly oily & creamy.

No chocolate, coffee or other dark or smoked malt flavors. I mean, seriously, isn't that what stout/porter is all about? Again, as a barleywine I'd only say that the color was too dark.

Overall this was a very bold beer that's very good, but must be sipped due to the strong unmasked alcohol.

A sweet, syrupy essence is left on the lips. While I'm not opposed to big hits of alcohol, this one isn't as well balanced as I would have hoped for, and there's some cloying and astringency at work that leave things a bit unsettled after a few drinks.

In the glass, the color is deep so that very little light comes through, but not at all hazy--clear ruby highlights are visible around the edges; nor is it as black as some stouts; it is a deep, dark, chocolate brown. The smell is very sweet, faintly ftuity, slightly alcoholic. The taste is also quite sweet, even a bit sugary--brown sugar or molasses. The fruit from the smell is present up front in the taste, then disappears or is overshadowed, then comes back again at the end. Not a very roasty stout, I only really get any roasted malt flavor in the aftertaste. For me the dominant taste is brown sugar or molasses and this flavor also hides the high alcohol content--my first taste seemed a bit hot, but I don't notice the alcohol after the first several sips. For some of my favorite breweries, their imperial stout is among their best offerings, but this certainly isn't the best beer I've had from Avery. It is by no means a bad beer, but I will probably pass it up for better imperial stouts in the future. It's difficult to get through a bomber of this; by the end, the syrupy sugar taste is overwhelmingly cloying. (By the way, the site describes the alcohol at 12.2%, while the bottle says 11.7%.

Appearance is a almost opaque black with a large size tan head that diminishes slowly over time. Flavor is big toffee notes, malts, coffee, chocolate, and some spices.

I would love to experience this flavor over and over, but it is definitely mighty. This is so thick, juicy, and hearty. The last bit I didn't want to finish. I just watched it as I rolled the glass-bottom in circles and the thick beer reluctantly rolled against the corners. The consistency is so magnificent.

It has a very deep roasted malt aroma with some chocolate, caramel, and some dark fruit aroma. The taste is good too. Really deep roasted malts, some caramel, chocolate, and then some dark fruity flavor. It has a very nice rich and smooth mouthfeel that makes it a very drinkable beer. Its one drawback is how alcoholic it is, but it gives it a very warming feeling.

The mouthfeel is excellent - you could almost eat this with a knife and fork, but it's not a beer I could drink more than one of, and at 12% abv I think I'd prefer a smaller bottle.

First sip yields more of this burnt grain quality with a bit of the Hallertau spiciness coming through, especially in the aftertaste. As it warms, I get a yeasty aftertaste. Rather light bodied and smooth for what I expected. Nothing too interesting. Even though the bottle lists a bunch of interesting descriptors, I didn't get much of what they describe.

The smell is a knockout -- a huge wafting of dark-roasted coffee, sweet chocolate and what seemed almost like bourbon. Tastes similar -- dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and a hugely creamy vanilla. Delicious. But somewhat offset by an overly bitter finish. I like the bitter bite for balance, but it lingers a little too long. Nice, thick, oily, chewy mouthfeel. Drinkability is good for something this powerful, but perhaps a little sweet for more than one. Still, something to savor. A real winner.","eberkman","Jan 12, 2008"

Thick and syrupy mouthfeel matches up with some sweet molasses and bittersweet chocolate flavors. Roasted malty nuttiness and rum finish this one out.

A decent hop kick at the end but nothing to write home about.

The alcohol flavor is present but not unpleasant. The mouthfeel is slick without a lot of lift. Not bad but not the mouth filling experience I love.

Light toffee, vanilla bean, coffee, chocolate notes, with a more prominent nutty aroma. Alcohol is already showing off big time here. Taste confirms the aroma notes, but the alcohol bites down really hard in the end and makes it difficult to really catch on to any subtleties. The hops add a bitterness that is attempting to hide the alcohol, but is doing a poor job. I'm really not getting any considerable dark fruit notes because of the alcohol kill.

This year's version weighs in at 11.73% ABV, a bit higher than last year (11.04%). It pours a near black into a tall pint glass, with a dark tan, foamy, two-finger head. A deep inhalation reveals scents of bittersweet chocolate and espresso, and dark, slightly sweet malts. The flavor is just overflowing with rich coffee and dark cacao accents, and the dark malts shine forth with great complexity and less sweetness. It's great to really indulge in a single mouthful of this brew and enjoy the flavors for some time. The finish focuses on coffee flavors, but a little hoppy bitterness sneaks through to balance the malts.","CWiggins","Nov 27, 2007"

Many scents confront the nose--caramel as bold as anything, mocha, molasses, and a hint of roasted chocolate--and the taste is magnificently complex. In addition to those aromas mentioned, I noticed an anise flavor accompanying a moderate hoppy bitterness that was initially off-putting, but overall pleasantly tolerable. The high ABV (11.79% in its most recent incarnation) becomes apparent about 1/3 of the way through, but the rich flavors and smooth texture make for smooth sailing nonetheless. A very delicious beer worth the time. I spent mine with The Czar listening to a hockey game via the Internet by the fire. Terrific.","Gehrig","Nov 24, 2007"

Nice roastiness in the aroma, along with a good amount of chocolate, alcohol, and some piney hoppiness. Taste follows with some decent chocolate flavor that becomes more noticeable as it warms followed by a huge crushing grassy and slightly piney hoppiness. Mouthfeel is average, at first comes across a little thin but as it warms to room temp becomes a little fuller feeling, medium in body, but still on the thin side for my preference. Biting hops mix with some evidence of the abv in the bitter and drying finish. This beer seems massively hopped, I enjoy some of the nice chocolate flavor that is there before the hops set in and look forward to letting a few of these sit for 5 years and see how they have developed.","hoppymeal","Nov 14, 2007"

The Czar feels creamy and smooth, medium body, with just the right amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel is probably the best of the stouts I have sampled.

Burnt sugars and heavy roasted malts become the dominant flavors with espresso and cocoa powder tones developing through the middle and a big chalky dryness and bittering hops perceived at the end. The finish shows a little tartness that is matched by drying burnt malt and chary, espresso notes. Descent mouthfeel, smooth with some creamy carbonation.

There is far less hoppiness than I remember both in this batch last year and this year's batch, they definitely mellow with age and allow a great mocha flavor to come through. The alcohol is very present at a listed 11.04%, even so, it is not too overpowering, this is a sipping beer.

I enjoyed the herbal hoppiness is got. Mouthfeel is a little slick, not as thick as I'd hope, and the carbonation, although minimal, is a bit prickly for me. Slow to go.

This one has a medium mouthfeel, the strong alcohol notes would probably scare lighter beer drinkers away. This is a potent RIS, and it doesn't try to hide it. It is a daring beer that is dominated by a few characteristics with many other sitting in the background adding layers to this beer.

Spicy alcohol joins the olfactory chorus as it warms. On tasting, I find it again very sweet, joined by high acidity, which recedes to a chocoate covered espresso bean aftertaste. Sweetness is overdone, even in a 2004 bottle! The mouthfeel is thick, slick and heavy. Coats the mouth, throat, and stomach, the latter two being very much warmed by the alcohol.

Thick, sticky lacing covered the edges of the glass. So far, looks wonderful. Just moments after I poured it, however, here it comes. Pine sap. Now, this isn't an overly offensive smell to me, in fact, I enjoy it in the RIGHT STYLES. Hercules DIPA is to die for, for instance. Chocolatey beers, however, need hop varietals from Europe, ie, hops that don't taste like citrus and pine. The smell was fairly nice, but I knew what was to come. I was entirely prepared for the taste, which was a bit chocolately, coffee like, stewed fruit, and grapefuit with pine sap. A far cry from wonderful, to say the least. Mouthfeel was bold and very heavy. This I truly enjoyed. An RIS should make you think for a split second that you have a mouth full of maple syrup; this was an area where this beer did very, very well at, IMO. Drinkability, however, was 3.0 at best. A 22oz bottle of 12.2% this heavy is more than enough. I would probably treat this in the future, the same way I treat Rasputin.

Taste is also quite rich with roasted malt and some warm alcohol, which is not really of my liking but could have been worse. Body is above average but not as full as some other big Impy stout.

The aroma had some malt to it, but was more brown sugar and molasses with a little burnt and roast thrown in. And just a hint of nail polish remover. Flavour was mostly sweet and alcohol with a bit of roast and caramel. Low bitterness and hop flavour with some harsh alcohol in the finish. Overall the malt was pretty thin. (Only) medium bodied with carbonation a little on the low side - still, it felt harsh. This seemed more like a high gravity brown ale than imperial stout - not to style in my opinion. Plus, the alcohol was too hot, with not nearly enough malt and hops to balance it. Not impressed.","DrJay","May 18, 2006"

What I liked most about it was its appearance. It forms a decent head that settles into a ring, and provides some decent lacing. When held up to a light you cannot see through the center of the glass, but there is a deep cherry red that you can see around the edges that is very appealing. This is an especially sweet stout, almost even like a barley wine. The roasted flavor of a stout is not apparant though you can tell its in the background. Sweet molasses and black liquorish flavors really dominate this beer's flavor. The alcohol in this really brings the drinkability down. The mouthfeel of the alcohol going down doesn't immediatly let you know how strong it is, but it comes through after a few minutes. Very good beer, and worth a try, but easy to over do.","dfried","Apr 28, 2006"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, goes down really hot. This was bottled in 2003 and the alcohol is still very apparent, I can only imagine what this is like fresh.

All rolled into an assertive, over-the-top stout. Starts out smooth and alcoholicly hot / sweet into an aggressively roasted / hopped finish.

Healthy dosage of roasted malts, faint suggestions of prune and bakers' chocolate. Light, vinous hoppiness; but overtaken by roastiness and fusel alcohols. Warming to the mouth and gullet, it maintains an overall sweetness, with fleeting glimpses of hops to counterbalance. Some wine-like properties show up, but nothing distracting.

The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with minimal carbonation and drinkability is good for a beer of this magnitude.

Upfront loads of utterly smooth chocolate malts, absolutely no abrasivenes, then a nice soft berry twang slowly drying into smooth roast coffee. Everything's interlaced with molasses sweetness and spicy alcohol keeping things in check. Alcohol actually dominates the flavor profile, yet only flavor, outside of that it's nonexistent. A touch of diacetyl Amazingly integrated in it's 3/4th year. The flavors have really gelled and it's quite silky. Low carbonation and full bodied, slinks its way down the gullet. Mellow.

The aroma was a little soft for the style, with chocolate dominating all other smells. It was a rich smell, but lacked the typical roasty punch. Taste was sweet cocoa with hot alcohol flashing across the palette. The hops were very apparent, with a spicy brashness typical of Hallertau. As is typical of young Imperial Stouts, the dark fruits and vinousness were yet to present themselves. All of these complexities are sure to develop with age, and I will have to bury the bomber back in the cellar so that I dont get tempted and crack it open too soon.

The look was definantly not that of an Imperial Stout. The lack of carbonation was a sign but the beer was more of a dark ruby color rather than the pitch black that I am used to. The smell was quite subtle with prunes, malt and alchohol dominating. I was really expecting more from the taste but it was still good. The 13% abv was hidden with great skill and was not overpowering in the flavor, only in the warming effect as it went down. There was a hint of alchohol in the flavor but it was mostly malt sweetness with a touch of dark chocolate and an even smaller touch of coffee in the background. This tastes more like a bock to me rather than a Imperial Stout, IMO. Still a decent beer and one worth cellering just to see what will come of this in the next few years.","Dmann","Feb 16, 2005"

Licorice and sweet dark molasses introduce themselves. The nearly 13% alcohol doesn't wait long to punch its way through and remind you that this is an Imperial stout. The Czar is smooth and not really oily. Hop bitterness arrives toward the back. Slightly more hoppy than desired. Maybe that's it's American influence.

First sip reveals, average body with very mild carbonation. Flavor is similar to nose. Ripe Plums, raisins, chocolate and brown sugar come through. There is also a big warming factor as the beer goes down into my belly. Very robust tasty brew. Suffers a little on drinkability due to the intense warming from alcohol.

Loose lace remains. Barbed waft of ethanol macerated ground anise and prune hits the nose initially. Mellows a tad, with dark chocolate covered raisin and black licorice ensuing. Swirling releases trace solvent - like, fusel hints. Ragged, yet appetizing aromawise. In flavor upfront is a lingering impression of rum soaked bittersweet chocolate torte. Minty ethanol darts in after a deliberation and complements the stalwart chocolate presence. Earthy, dirty, hop tones arise mid palate along with suggestions of black pepper and fermented dilute molasses. Fruit character is slow to develop in flavor, but eventually augments into a combination of well overripe plum, although there's a softer hint of cherry - esque tartness. Moderate in body at best, with a mouthfeel dangerously skimpy in viscosity. Roasted barley and chocolate character counterintuitively diminish as the beer warms, while hop bitterness augments. Overall this brew gets sharper and drier as it breathes. Finishes with fleeting burnt brownie hints and lingering, enveloping ethanol warmth. A potent and flavorful imperial stout, indeed. Most certainly worthy of cellaring for a long time. The Czar is a a touch boozy in its current state, but is quite tasty nonetheless.","marc77","Sep 18, 2004"

Head is down just a slight film of bubbles quickly, but lacing is okay. Aroma tends towards sweet and alcoholic. After allowing to warm for awhile, taste starts to exhibit some dark malt character, which chilled was not evident to my palate. Was starting to think The Czar was reminiscent of its (in my mind) redheaded step-brother, The Beast, but had to give it some time. Mouthfeel is okay, but I wish there was a bit more heartiness to make up this one.

Not the most pleasant smelling stout, as the alcohol seemed to really take over the aroma as this warmed. The taste was a bit sweet to start off with before the alcohol jumped in and took over. This is one Imperial Stout where you can defiantly taste the big alcohol. The usual roasted malt and coffee flavors are there just not a prominent. The mouthfeel is decent with a good amount of carbonation. I think the drinkability is defiantly hurt by the strong alcohol, not a bad beer but no-where close to a favorite imperial stout of mine.

The front is a dark hoppy with some fruit and bitter chocolate. The fruit develops through the middle. It's almost apple-like... an impression that only intensifies with temperature. There's also a good dose of tangy toffee in the thick, malty body. The finish is very bitter with considerable alcohol bite. This is very good. The hops are more pronounced than the big, intense malt-monster imperials. The malt here is more toffee-like. Almost British toffeeness.

Slick, oily mouthfeel clears out leaving a slightly bitter finish. An impressive beer, not what I normally expect from an RIS, but very good. The taste is quite a bit sweeter than expected, not at all cloying. ABV is very well hidden. I'm starting a new shift at work and need to go to bed about 8 hours before I'm used to.

The taste is excellent, very sweet and malty. Some chocolate and alcohol flavor, and only a slight bit of hoppiness. As fine as this beer tastes, I think a bit more hoppiness might make this beer more enjoyable. Mouthfeel is excellent. Drinkability is great if you ask the mouth, but not quite as good if you ask the brain. I'm definitely feeling this one, but it's hard to drink this beer slowly.","bigbubba","Feb 29, 2004"

My rating of the appearance is based solely on the beer itself, though Im tempted to award bonus points for the very cool bottle. Nose is toffee, semi-sweet dark chocolate, and some faint aromas of floral hops. Full-bodied and quite smooth with a slightly syrupy texture that coats the tongue and the back of the mouth with each sip. Taste begins with notes of molasses, candied dark fruit, and mocha followed by notes of smoky charcoal, rum-soaked raisins, and warming alcohol. A very rich and very enjoyable imperial stout. Im definitely going to buy a few more of these to lie down for a year or two.","Morris729","Feb 15, 2004"

4.45,12.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"OK, this one was pretty good. Worthy of a name like The Czar, I think. The colour was very dark, and by the time I got to have some, there was no head left. It smelled very roasty, toasty, malty, carmely. Nice. It tasted very smooth, not harsh or bitter, very malty. Yes. Sweet but not too sweet, and just a hint of hops near the finish. Mouthfeel was good also, a bit thick and creamy- it had 'umph.' Drinkability is excellent, because it does not taste or feel like 12%abv, and the flavour is so well-balanced that I dont think I could get sick of it!","erica","Feb 12, 2004"
3.61,-8.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours with a thick brown creamy head, a deep black beer with amber highlights rest under the head. Serious aromas of alcohol emanate from the glass. There are aromas of black malt, roasted character, and coffee (though fairly subtle for an Imperial Stout). The body is, as expected, thick and creamy. Wow this is strikingly different. It is intensly sweet, even for an Imperial Stout. The roast character is here but pretty subdued. The sweetness dominates the flavor profile. This beer needs some age to smooth it out. The alcohol is evident in the finish. If I had to rate this as is I would give it a 3.4, based on potential though I would give it a 4.0 after it has aged a few years and smoothed out.","Gueuzedude","Feb 12, 2004"

This glugs out of the bootle a deep, dark, opaque black colour with some ruby/crismon edges, and a heavy head of tan foam. The head quickly dies, as the bubbles try and make their way to the surface. The aromas are substantial and remind me of Stones excellent version. I smell currants, booze, spicy hops, and deep roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, some lactic notes, and some other dark fruit notes as well. The taste is also exceptional. A creamy blend of booze, dark roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, coffee, currants, dark fruits, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, smooth, and never really borders on cloying. The drinkability is absolutley excellent for a beer of 12%abv as well. Recommended. This is probably Averys best brew!","francisweizen","Feb 11, 2004"

The smell is fairly sweet and malty, with some coffe notes. There is just a little bit of hops in there as well. The smell is a little weak though for an imperial stout. The taste starts malty, with coffee, chocolate, and toffee. The finish is slightly hoppy with a good dose of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability suffers a little due to the high alcohol content. A good overall imperial stout.","SheepNutz","Jan 17, 2004"
4.32,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Man alive this was a good beer. It poured quite dark with ruby highlights. The head was small (understandable considering the abv) but held nicely. When I smelled it I got a TON of different flavors including coffee, chocolate, earthy hops, lots of alcohol, soy sauce, etc. The taste was like the smell but more intense. The initial hit is a wallop to my tongue. Real sweet molasses and candied currants. Alcohol is strong the whole way through which was actually fitting for the taste. There was an underlying earthiness here and slight hop flavor, but not bitter. More sweetness comes in the form of chocolate, brown sugar, and maybe some vinous flavors. The body was a little thin and not quite carbonated enough. I'm going to age some of these and just wait for the phenomenon that will be "The aged Czar".","granger10","Jan 17, 2004"

Aromas of malts, chocolate and alcohol waft out of my glass. I can tell this is a strong Imperial. Up-front tastes of dark chocolate, with just the right amount of bitterness. Subtler undertones of cherry, smokyness, and nutty-ness. Perky and well balanced. Very tasty and delicious. One complaint: normally, imperials can take up alot of alchohol, melding it well with the flavors (Strong ales are my favorite). In this case however, there is a little bit too much alchohol getting through in the aroma and taste... holding it back from getting better scores. Mouthfeel is lovely... silky and smooth. The errant alcohol detracts from the drinkability somewhat, but still quite drinkable. Overall, a very good imperial stout with a minor flaw.","HiroProtagonist","Dec 30, 2003"

It had a very subtle aroma of sweet malts, with some floral and yeasty and tangy alcoholic tones. It was definitely a thick and chewy beer, with a sweet molasses start and a hoppy finish with a big alcoholic bite that got stronger as the beer warmed.

Very smooth taste. Hides the 12.2% alcohol very well. Very drinkable. Extremely dangerous beer. This beer will be outrageous with a couple of years of bottle aging.

And you can just tell from the care they put into designing the label that they're pretty proud of this beer -- mine was the 2002 edition. Pours jet black, with only the scantest traces of a dark tan head lining the edge of the glass. But hey, at 12.2% ABV, who can blame 'em. Pour little cabron dioxide bubbles are probably too drunk to find their way to the surface. Aroma is huge, enveloping, overpowering and rich. Coffee, chocolate, and a cherryish/licorice like dark sweetness. Terrific! The beer feels great too, oily, very smooth and full-bodied. Sweet molasses dominates the first part of the taste, with the malt developing a toffee-like toastiness mid-palate. Alcohol spiciness comes through at the end, tingly and peppery, though you'd never guess 12.2% (did I mention it's 12.2% ABV) from the taste. Hallertau hops lend a pleasant though very understated herbal character to the finish, and a nice balance. Chocolate overtones becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. This is an ass-kicker of a beer, but I'll take a beating from it any chance I get.","mzwolinski","May 08, 2003"

Finish has an applicative hop spicy bite, the acidity germane, the aftertaste droughty and long lasting and slightly alcohol bitter a real nice Belly Warming feel from the 12.2% ABV, a real load and a real treat for this Lover of the dark side.","Gusler","Apr 02, 2003"

I had some fun times just looking at the light through the glass. Quite a nice color. Floral hops and alcohol dominate over chocolate and roasted malt aroma. Flavor begins with a mild roasted mocha coffee, and light molasses sweetness. Then you go on a bit of a ride, as the taste becomes drier midway through and the spicy warming alcohol takes over in combination with the spicy, yet fairly restrained, Hallertau hops, and then we revisit the beginning with a sweet finish. In the aftertaste, you are reminded of the light roasted coffee beginning. Interesting Imperial Stout that I'm sure would benefit from a year's time to mellow out the undoubtedly brazen 12.2% alcohol.","comat0se","Jan 25, 2003"
