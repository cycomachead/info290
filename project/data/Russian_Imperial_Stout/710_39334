Taste is of roasted malts, ash, slight coffee with some cocoa mixed about. Not super thick but medium bodied enough for me to enjoy. This was overall a fantastic imperial stout that more than surpassed my expectations. Enjoy!","dpgoblejr","Mar 19, 2015"

3.9,2.4,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"Overall: It is an Americanized version of the classic RIS style. Not too bad and by far the best in their Big Eddy series so far. This 4-pack is from the 2013 release (Feb/Mar 2014 shelf time) so I'm thinking it has about a year of age on it. I'll try it again in a few months to see if things are changing. If they don't, I can certainly enjoy a few more of these. Not as good as other RISs I've tried but a nice offering from Liney's.","ClavisAurea","Jan 31, 2015"

3.51,-7.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"passable, but something here i just dont like. its hotly alcoholic, way more than the abv should force, and way more than i think the style allows for, or should allow for, its distracting to a nice dark fruit and charcoal malt profile and i really cant get past it. it feels weird in the stomach and going down because of it, and im having a harder time enjoying the dark chocolate and vanilla and tobacco flavors in it. is there a touch of smoke to it? it certainly seems to pop up in the finish. others have described this as smooth, so maybe something was off with the bottle i had, but i wouldnt describe it like that at all, well, maybe texture, but certainly not in overall feel, it almost burns. the way paint smells this sort of feels, if that makes sense. still, i think the project is a noble one, and i think the beers isnt as bad as i am making it sound, but the alcohol exposure is a little much. looks amazing though, shiny black and heady forever. good to get a four pack of a style like this out there affordably too, which is probably this beers greatest merit.","StonedTrippin","Nov 23, 2014"

Chocolate and deep roasted grains up front with a coffee bitterness and sweet chocolate and deep roasted grains in the background with hops coming through on the aftertaste.

Flavors are smaller and more composite. Tanginess is somewhat unsuitable. The body is a wash; a hefty medium that detracts from the decadence. This new bitterness is a byproduct, and probably unintended or changed. Carbonation is medium-low with little play. There might have been a really good beer here a year or two ago.

Anyone that looks for a malt forward, sweet, rich, and impressive stout is sure to appreciate this one! I encourage anyone that happens upon this on tap or in a liquor store to not let this one slip through their fingers! I had this on tap at Bukowski's in Boston, and wasn't letting someone else buy it at my favorite liquor store! I even bought a little extra to age.

Big Eddy is a different story. This is a seriously intense beast of a beer, and I can see why someone could seriously dislike this. It's got a wallop of bitterness that stands up to the most intense double IPAs, but with a distinctively dark and roasted twist.

Flavor reflects the same complex, fruity-molasses alcohol whif of the nose. Alcohol is well covered but also mouth numbing. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy with a minimal yet creamy carbonation.

Nose is a bit dull - artificial sweetener, suggestions of lactose, dark malt and a slightly vinous quality.

Smell is aggressive dark chocolate, roasted coffee, some licorice, dark fruit, and a hint of smoke. Taste is very assertive, lots of expresso, with hints of the other flavors from the nose. Body is on the larger side, perfect amount of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is very solid, reminds me of Ten Fidy and $5 less expensive.

Aromas are boozy and sweet, but more like cough medicine with some cherry and roasted malt. Tastes are boozy up front, with notes of cherry, dark fruits, roasted malt with the alcohol presence lingering. Mouth-feel is full bodied and smooth and finishes slightly dry. The first time I had this was when it was a one-off in 2008(?) and I feel that batch had better results. This one just seems off in comparison. It's still good, but there are better Russian Imperial Stouts out there.","barnzy78","Jan 29, 2012"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, dark fruits, apple, wood, light smoke, molasses, and caramel. Some nice and fairly complex aromas. Taste of rich chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, light fruit, coffee, roasted malt, herbal hops, and light smoke. Not much bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, herbal spiciness, coffee, and toffee for a good bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very nice creamy and lush mouthfeel. Very easy and smooth to drink at 9.5%.

3.42,-10.2,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was an Ok RIS but it can't hang with some of the better beers of the style. The flavors started off very similar to most RIS's but then the roasty charred flavor gets a little out of hand and stuck out the most giving this beer a pretty bitter burnt taste. This beer has good drinkability I should have no problem finishing off this bottle, the alcohol was hidden well and not much of the 9.5% was noticeable. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it smelled pretty on par for an RIS and it had some nice complexity to it. What I liked least about this beer was that the burnt malt flavor was the most dominating in the taste of this beer, I would have preferred to have more robust chocolate and coffee flavors, the mouthfeel could have been a little better also. I would drink this beer again but I don't know if I would buy it again, I would much rather prefer an Old Rasputin to this beer. This is worth a try if your a big RIS fan but it doesn't compare to some of the better beers in this style. I like the fact that Leinenkugel took a shot at making a bigger beer which is much different from their regular lineup, but when I compare this beer to other RIS's I have had it just doesn't stand up and show the same amount of balance and complexity. I am glad I finally got to try this beer, but it falls in the middle as far as RIS's go, but I am still interested to see if Leinenkugels can produce a top notch big beer.","StoutHunter","Dec 11, 2011"

Or perhaps it's my sniffer. Might revisit this aspect of the review with one of the three remaining bottles. From what I can gather, however, it's pretty roasty, malty, and has some hints of chocolate. The taste has a certain fruitiness to it. Cherries, figs...not quite sure...but the sweetness is a fruity variety. Subtle woody notes, alongside of vanilla and a touch of alcohol make an appearance. The mouthfeel is way smooth. Very silky, with a slight remnant of alcohol lingering behind. Overall, this is a fine stout. It's nice seeing a BMC beer come through for a change.","Retail1LO","Nov 29, 2011"

Dove sweet dark chocolates. Hints of sweet cream. Dark, ripe cherries with just a bit of date. There is a odd flavor that i cant put my finger on. Almost reminds me of a band-aid/plastic on the finish. The booze is hidden very well. Its really completely hidden. I would have never expected it to be a 9.5% stout. The mouthfeel is decent.

Mouthfeel was medium with a very smoky, charcoal flavor initially, somewhat medicinal in its bitterness. I feel left out on this one, since I am not a big fan of the style to begin with and I just am not liking this particular iteration.

The head caps it off with a great head for the style. Right away I can tell that this isnt your typical joke of a beer that Leinenkugel has been churning out lately. This is the real deal. The aroma grabbed by attention with a robust sweetness of licorice and chocolate drizzled figs and raisins. Brown sugar and leather make appearances as well. The taste is very nice. I like when a beer is made well enough to define the line between Russian Imperial Stout and American Double Stout. This one is clearly an RIS. Nice deep fruitiness with licorice, leather and a sturdy hopping. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. This single I received has made me consider buying more.","MbpBugeye","Jan 19, 2011"

Dark roast, mild dark chocolate, tobacco, and almost a vegetable like aroma in the nose. Some booze also evident in the nose. Mdeium mouthfeel, too light in my opinion. The first flavor I notice is some mild smokiness that sticks around the entire time you take a drink. Sweet dark chocolate flavor along with some boose and dark chocolate bitterness to end this.

Nicely balanced with more bitter chocolate, asome dark roastiness, a touch of dark fruit without being overly acidic, and some cream. Nice bitterness throughout.

The aroma is bold with burnt malt, coffee, caramel and dried fruits. The taste is exactly that creamy dark malts along with strong sweetness that is almost overpowering and a lingering raisin and plum taste. Aftertaste is strong and on the burnt side of things. A little disappointing, however a decent strong brew. Likely to cellar two and pass one along to a friend from my four pack.","WJVII","Dec 29, 2010"

There was no price tag so the cashier sold it for 6 bucks for a four pack. I'm guessing that was a good price, appears pitch black in body. Large tan head forms thick velvet texture, I like the cascading effect as this one dwindles. Fine speckled lacing is even around the entire glass. Aroma has some dark ripened fruit notes hints of cherry/raisin notes. Roasted malts with a touch of soy sauce/anise like notes. Dark roasted malt brings in hints of chocolate and coffee but these noted don't stand out as much as other features I mentioned. Alcohol plays a pretty big factor in the nose here, I can really smell the booze in this one. Flavor has a tart cherry/raisin sweetness wrapped in dark chocolate dry alcoholic finish with dark nearly burnt roasted malts. Body is somewhat thin for the style alcohol is a bit too prominent on the palate, it hits with dark roasted malt and ripened fruit notes finishes a bit boozey. Drinkability overall is one and done type of pseudo craft, this is a good representation of the style I just think it would do better with some age I have three left, I'll update my reviews accordingly.","WVbeergeek","Dec 28, 2010"

Finish is a bit charred, almost oaken, with caramel and toffee notes up-front. They say there are 3 types of hops, but I couldn't really discern any.

There is a little bit of alcohol in there, but is hidden pretty well for the most part. The smell is the taste at first. Gradually the roasted malt and coffee taste melds into some molases and slight spicy or herbal notes. Licorice/anice, maybe even some faint cinamon or nutmeg flavors. Hard to nail down. It finishes with more roasted malt/ burnt wood flavors, and a fair amount of bitter hoppy bite. The 10% alcohol is in there, but pretty far in the background. Very thick and chewy mouthfeel. It's like pudding it's so thick. I had no idea Leine's made beer like this. For the most part they make decent, drinkable, but mostly boring beers.

Very stout like aroma with plenty of roasted malt, chocolate, and some dark fruit. A touch of grassy, earthy hops as well. The flavor features the roasted malt foremost. A little smokiness sneaks in as well. Other hints include a bit of chocolate. Alcohol is well disguised. This beer falls short in the body department. Far thinner than the premier Russian Imperial Stouts. It just does not let the flavors linger very long. Carbonation is good and would of been very good if the body had more substance. Relatively easy drinking for a big stout thanks to the alcohol not being detectable and not really a positive, a light body.","morimech","Dec 07, 2010"

The way it drinks is where it especially stands out. This is possibly the smoothest stout I've ever had. It's full body but is so soft, so smooth that it's hard to believe this came from Leinenkugel.

Wariness aside, it pours a deep motor oil topped by a substantial amount of brown foam. The nose comprises molasses, caramelized brown sugar, dark roasted malts, light fusel, and light burnt coffee beans. The taste runs similarly, though everything is darker, more roasted. I never thought I'd say this, but it all seems too dark and roasted for its own good. I'm not getting too much of the heat that others are, though it is in no way mild. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an only slightly chewy feel. Overall, while not necessarily hot, I feel this is indeed an overly young stout. Perhaps with age it could achieve something (or, at least, get it's lazy ass off its mother's couch and get a goddamn job), but until then it's too much roast with too little mass.","TMoney2591","Nov 20, 2010"

The smell is a little hot and could use some time to mellow out. There is the aroma of some vodka, strawberry and banana, some smoke and a bit of oak woodsiness. The taste is mainly smokey with a clove flavor in the background. There is a a real need for this to mellow out the booze harshness.

Syrupy chocolate glazes the tongue and the hopsbring about a slight soured bitter feel as you continue to drink. Dare I say ""underrated"". Electric on the mouthfeel as it begs for the nexy sip.

Coffee in, chocolate coating but not over on the chocolate as per the new wave. I know many malts were used, but it is definately coming out on the strong bitter side.","Sammy","Mar 08, 2008"

A little more roasted malt or hop character to balance all that sweetness would have really helped. Still, this was a decent enough sipper of a RIS and one that I'm most grateful for having had the chance to try.","Kegatron","Mar 05, 2008"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from 12oz bottle thanks to Hoppymeal. Poured into a duvel snifter. Poured a thick black color with a finger size brown head. Smell was slight dark fruit with chocolate and alcohol scent. Taste is slight herbal coffee and light chocolate flavor with a alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is full body oily with a light carbonation feel. While a good RIS to me the alcohol feel is just a little unbalanced.","sfoley333","Mar 02, 2008"

Ripe berries mix with anise oil and char and alcohol. This beer has a real oily texture, which I like in Imperial Stouts. Body is about medium-full or so and light on the carbonation.

A little bit of coppery taste on the finish. very little coffee tones. The mouthfeel is very thick and viscous, soupy.

Big Eddy's has to sit in with every top notch RIS, it has few flaws, it's only drawback is that it fills the bill, but has nothing to really bring it forward.

Full in the mouth and the ABV is well hidden. A victim of hype.","franksnbeans","Dec 01, 2007"

Nose of dark chocolate-covered raspberries, scorched brown sugar, stewed plums, and raisins. Herbal, almost piny, hop aroma surrounds. Tastes of dark chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness up front. Sweet, dark fruits come on strong along with truffle and milk chocolate sweetness. Tiramisu flavors before herbal hop bitterness crescendos into the bittersweet, roasted coffee, warming finish. Full-bodied. Big and chewy with a very smooth, creamy finish. I was prepared to be disappointed by the hype, but this is a very impressive RIS.

4.43,16.3,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours inky black with a medium sized creamy rusty brown head that dissipates quickly to a ring. Aroma is a big dry and smoky roastiness with hints of chocolate, acidic tangy aroma lies behind it mixing with the maltiness to create a sweet fruit smell. Taste is a soft chocolate mixing with the smoky and dry charred woodyiness of roasted malts up front, sweet fruity and ripe berry maltiness comes in mid taste and lingers nearly to the finish before the smoky and nutty roastiness lingers dryly on the tongue. Medium to heavy in body, fairly thick, sugary and full on the tongue, low level of carbonation is soft and creamy, slight drying in the finish. This is an outstanding beer, I had no idea what to expect and was very impressed. The smoky quality to the roasted malts is very nice as is the strong fruity maltiness. The alcohol is extremely well balanced. I am very excited to see how this will age but it is drinking very well now.","hoppymeal","Nov 25, 2007"

The roast fights to get through. The fruitiness in both arom and flavor blunt most other flavors that I am assuming lurk beneath. The alcohol is very apparent and fusely.

Many of the things noted in the nose are also present in the taste, but just even more condensed and with some roastiness in the finish; it's so good!
