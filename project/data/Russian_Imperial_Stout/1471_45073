4.24,-1.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Like many other reviewers, I did not feel this beer lives up to the hype.  For the money, Founders RIS is better.  Poured from a 12oz bottle chilled into a brandy snifter.  Pours a deep black with barely a finger of tan head from an aggressive pour.  Head dissipated quickly.  No oily residue on top.  Smells of dark bitter chocolate, hops, and dark fruits.  Little to no coffee smell.  Taste is much thinner in the mouth than I would have preferred with hardly any coffee or espresso finish. Dark roasted malts, toffee, bitter dark chocolate and hops.  No vanilla.  Dark fruits like raisins or plums/prunes.  Hoppy and slightly bitter after taste.  This is not my preferred RIS.  It's very good but not great.","uvachief","Mar 29, 2015"

The smell is chocolate, raisins, coffee, and some dark roasted malts. The taste is pretty close to the smell, with the dark chocolate and coffee flavors more dominant, and the dark fruit flavors a bit more in the background. I'm also getting a bit of heat from the alcohol. The mouthfeel was kinda thin, but very creamy, with a nice bit of carbonation. Overall, very good beer, not sure it is worth the $4.99 price tag for a 12 oz bottle though.","timontheroad","0"

The taste was very strong as an 11% alc/vol should be.  The booziness is definitely detectable followed by a chocolate, coffee, and smoke.  This is definitely a fine fine product.  The minute you swallow this beer you start to get that warming feeling in your gut.  The after taste is a slight bitter, but nothing to take away from the beer overall.  This is a great imperial stout.  I really enjoy this and Dark Horse Brewing Co.'s Too Cream Stout as well!  Try them both!","JPowell712","Mar 01, 2015"

3.98,-7.7,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"12oz bottle poured into stout glass. Very dark brown and nearly opaque with a few brown slivers at the edges. Half an inch of tan head rises and quickly falls to a thin cap that lingers. A few spots of lace remain. Aroma is of roasted malts, dried dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate, touch of soy sauce, and alcohol. Taste starts moderately sweet with chocolate, brown sugar, and date. Some bitterness follows from espresso and woody notes. Alcohol is masked well but not completely hidden. Medium-full body, creamy texture, low carbonation, warming sweet finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 22, 2015"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light char, light dark fruits, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial stout! All around fantastic complexity and balance of big dark, roasted, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely amazing offering.","superspak","Beers"

I still got a brief finger of deep-tan head with limited retention, quickly falling to wisps. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose smelled of molasses or medicinal cough syrup from when I was a kid. It had a vegetal, root-like quality that also put me in mind of my grandparents' Geritol. I am not trying to be funny or anything of that nature, either. That is just what comes to mind. Mouthfeel was big, dense, thick, chewy. There was an initial, immediate fusel alcohol burn that slowly died down, allowing for flavors of burnt charcoal, dried dark fruits, anise, and molasses to come forth and be recognized. Whew! This was definitely a no-playing-around beer. Finish was dry, mainly due to the alcohol heat, with a lingering smoky chocolatiness that began to put me in mind of brownies. It was a good beer and I am sure that it is an excellent example of the style, but a) I do not really dig the style and b) it could have aged a while longer to reduce the heat.","woodychandler","Jul 22, 2014"

I think I can taste bitter, semi-sweet chocolate paired with a roasty coffee-filled linger. The bitterness, to me, is from the chocolate, I don't necessarily pick that up from the coffee influence. Dark brown sugar, too, and does sweeten up a tad as it warms. Drinks very smoothly for 11.0% but even after it warmed I couldn't help but notice the lingering bitterness. Tends to be a bit of a downgrade for me.","bowzer4birdie","Jun 16, 2014"

Just floats its way down (despite its medium to heavy body) with prominent notes of milk chocolate, bubblegum and black licorice, followed by hints of oak, cherry and vanilla. Fusel alcohol is barely noticed in the back. A beautiful, well-crafted stout that pairs well with this cool and rainy spring evening.","stephens101","May 23, 2014"

First thing that hits me in the nose is dark fruits like raisin, figs, and then minor sweet malts like chocolate and something sugary (not going to say candi sugar or caramel...toffee? molasses?) and then balance from some roasted malts and to be honest no alcohol. The lack of alcohol in the nose and also the beer itself is quite a feat considering it's a double digit ABV beer. This beer, for as heavy as it could be and with so much going on, is actually light and easy to drink with a chewy, fuller body that goes down incredibly easy with notes of chocolate and other sweet flavors (again - toffee? molasses?) hints of figs, some roasted malts, good balance and the beer has a good, strong finish without alcohol burn.

This ale pours black with a very small and short lived tan head that leaves a slight film and lacing. The aroma has an over abundance of dark chocolate followed by a lesser amount of coffee, burnt caramel, and vanilla. The nose is the best thing about this beer. The flavor follows the nose but is more subdued. All the notes are there as in the nose but they just are not as dynamic. The coffee is more pronounced particularly in the bitter finish of the ale. Other than the finish it is a rather sweet stout. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but smooth and satisfying none the less. This is damn good but maybe not as rich and complex as some of the other offerings in this category. Can't wait to see how it ages.","lochef81","Apr 08, 2014"

Taste is very chocolatey with some caramel, creamy vanilla, and lactose sweetness. Slight piney bitterness works its way through. Very yummy; dessert in a glass.

Visible and minimal carbonation. Aroma is very heavy... dark chocolate cake, dark fruits, some sour cherry, and it is indeed very roasty. Flavor wise, that roasty, toasted malt aspect comes through in a big way. Secondary to that are the pleasing coffee and chocolate notes. It does start off very smooth, and appropriately fades out into a very dry finish. There is a very strong 'campfire' aspect to this as well, which could turn some people off. I rather like it, myself. The mouth feel is medium-heavy, and overall, this is an interesting blend of sweet and smoky. Recommended for any RIS head.","Neorebel","Nov 06, 2013"

4.21,-2.3,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. This aspect was just so over the top robust, with woodiness from out of nowhere, char and ash, fruity sweets to match, and general complexity. The blend really comes through and each individual component finds its mate, striking harmony. The flavoring follows nicely, with just as much punch through the taste. Here, however, things did not strike as beautiful a balance, but rather just swam together in the same pool. The booze was way forward, even for the style, but it did offer some nice sweetness towards the front of the sip, contributing to the flavoring itself in a way that many beers lack. The sip was slurpy, creamy, and coating, helping to offset some of that brutal chalky astringency. This is a huge, impressive offering from Dark Horse, and we can’t wait to try the barrel aged version.","TheBrewo","Jun 13, 2013"

Aromas of dark, bittersweet chocolate, black cherry, peat and earthy tones, and a touch of ginger. Pretty interesting nose. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a warm, cocoa and sweet chocolate backbone supporting a touch of bitter coffee and some subtle fruit sweet highlights. Rich and smooth in mouth...almost creamy. Bitter and creamy aftertaste, with hints of baker's chocolate and a hint of booze. Rich, smooth finish, with a slight bitter linger. Very solid, robust brew.","GarthDanielson","Apr 26, 2013"

Nose is pretty hoppy for a stout with a prominent alcohol almost solventy smell up front. After a couple more deep whiffs I get a bit of semi sweet chocolate and a bit of roastiness. Taste is smooth with light roast and chocolate but also some subdued hop flavor in the mix. Loooong bitter finish with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Can taste a bit of the solventy-alcohol that I picked up so much on the nose but not too much. Smooth on the tongue with just a little carbonation but actually sort of light mouth feel for a stout let alone an 11% stout. That being said, it is very easy to drink. Second time having this beer, and I enjoyed the first more than this one. Just had a Founder's Imperial Stout last night and this particular bottle did not even come close (perhaps that's influencing my review?).

Nothing odd here. Aroma of lightly hopped dark and toasty barley dominates the whiff of the chocolate that comes across far more potently in the taste (the chocolate, that is). The other taste presence is more of a sensation, bitter to be exact, without an overwhelming hop profile. My highest praise is attached to the silky ass mouthfeel. Just dandy as hell the way this ribbon of liquid seduces the tongue. How's that for women's romance novel descriptive?

4.25,-1.4,4.5,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a glass from the bottle, one must note the attractiveness of this beer. Pouring a handsome black color, a mocha colored head tops the beer before fading to lace the sides of the glass. In the aroma, one gets notes of burnt malts, chocolate, and a hint of molasses. I was a little surprised that the aroma is so muted since this is relatively fresh. On the initial taste, one detects dark chocolate, smoke, burnt sugar a sweet backbone. The alcohol is noticeable, but in a good way. I enjoyed this stout near room temperature, which really helps to highlight the nuances of the beer. The smooth mouthfeel allows a sweet dark chocolate note to linger on the back of the tongue until it almost becomes mediciney. It is an that point that the warming sensation of the alcohol bursts through and reminds you that this stout has an 11%ABV. After about three sips of this beer, I am starting to feel it. This beer is an excellent nightcap, and may be best shared with a friend.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 17, 2013"

The dark fruit is minimal in comparison to the roast and char. The very large percentage of chocolate malt and black patent adds to the astringency and creates an unpleasant tartness. It finishes very dry for the style with too much charcoal and burnt grain.","Mitchster","Mar 09, 2013"

And all of the components of the aroma are magnified in flavor - BAM!! In some sort of odd way severe yet warm and welcoming. Body and carbonation are perfect.

Nothing that will blow your mind but it's a well-crafted, balanced, highly enjoyable RIS. The 12% ABV is barely noticeable and the rich flavors kept me craving a sip every few minutes.

The appearance and smell take second fiddle to the flavour and mouthfeel for sure. I'd like to try the BBPt5 just to see how much the mouthfeel improves! But in those departments I don't see much room for improvement- it's that good. I want to call this my RIS for the really dark, cold nights while Founders RIS is more of whenever I feel like a RIS.

Pitch black pour with a caramel colored head that lasts about 5 seconds with no lacing. The nose is a bit unique with a roasty maltiness and subtle sweet smokiness along with hints of soy sauce, molasses, black coffee, dark chocolate, and a touch of licorice. The taste follows suit with the sweet smokiness really showing up early along with black cherries, espresso, dark chocolate, booze, port wine, and licorice. Definitely a complex stout. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, smooth and oily, with a subtle creaminess and a nice warming alcohol burn on the finish. Overall, this is definitely a standout RIS.

What I first notice on the nose are sweeter malts - caramel, toffee, brown and candied sugars, sweet booze, simple syrups, a bit of cocoa as it warms. The booze is very well placed on the tongue. Taste starts with burnt oak, then black cherries and caramel. Just a hint of black licorice if you really look for it. Really a unique flavor. The feel is nearly perfect and showcases the best of the beers base flavors. Overall, I would highly recommend this. This is one of the best ’non-specialty’ imperial stouts I’ve ever tried. Fantastic.","yamar68","Beers"

The aroma completely doesn't match the flavors - wish they met somewhere in the middle. Balance seems a bit off...alcohol is dominating and heavy handed. It is fairly enjoyable, but when it comes to world-class RIS's this really leaves a lot on the table. Perhaps a bit of aging will smooth this one out a bit...fresh, doesn't live up to the hype/expectations I had coming into this.","portia99","Dec 29, 2011"

Poured pitch black with a minimal fizzy brown head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, subtle sweet alcohol, and subtle caramel. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma and flavors on this one were quite nice for a RIS. While they were not overly complex, they made this one quite enjoyable. The key thing for a RIS for me is if they can cover up the alcohol while still keeping it around as a more subtle flavor. This one did this quite well. A definite must try for any beer drinker out there.","thagr81us","Nov 04, 2011"

The taste is just behind the nose, mirroring all of the luscious flavors represented in the nose. This is my kind of stout. A little boozy, thick, rich, and creamy.

Pours a pitch black syrupy appearance. Barely any head (what you would expect from a beer this big). Smell- rich roasty maple syrup. Maybe some vanilla bean, some subdued chocolate flavor. From appearance and smell, it appears this one might have some time on it (yay!). Taste- Different flavors from what I would have expected. A roasty sweetness up front, some liquorice, sweet chocolate, not much bitterness at all. There is a creaminess to the mouthfeel, very little carbonation. Overall for the style, I would have expected more of a roasty possibly dark chocolate presence. I got almost too much sweetness from this one, and it kind of bugged me.

The aroma is milk chocolate, dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, nutty roast, creamy coffee, vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is smooth and very full. Taste is sweet but not cloying. There’s a mildly bitter finish with roast and some earthy hops. A bit of a tannic quality, wine-like. This is a real treat and an excellent beer.","popery","Aug 10, 2011"

The appearance is pretty damn nice, it's a little better than the 4 I gave it, the head and lacing were nice. The aroma was much more roasted then the first bottle I had, it had more RIS aromas and light amount of dark fruits, its like the opposite of the first bottle I had, but the biggest problem is the harsh alcohol aromas that remind of of cheap vodka, the aroma is better than the 2.5 i first gave it, but it's not much better. The taste is better and more RIS like it, it had a nice roast to it, the alcohol was hidden ok, it wasn't harsh but it was pretty warming, better than the 3 I first gave it, it taste like a good RIS. The mouthfeel was better than the 3 I first gave it, it was pretty true to style. I must have had a bad bottle because this one is much different and much more RIS like. The drinkability isn't the best I don't think I would want another one. This was a solid RIS, but not a favorite Founders Imperial Stout is still my number one.

Really nice, based on the smell I can't wait to take a sip. Taste is sweet Hershey's syrup up front, roasted malt, a little bittersweet cocoa and smoke on the finish.

There’s also a slight lactic cream presence but the nose of this beer is all about roasted malt and chocolate. Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a slightly chewy, viscous consistency. Deep roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee/espresso bean, oatmeal, burnt toast and toffee. This is complimented by a sweet chocolate malt presence and subtle creaminess. There’s also some earthy hop bitterness and a prominent alcohol burn in the finish. The ABV isn’t well masked with a ton of heat and warmth in the finish. I expect that this will tone down with age but this fresh bottle is too hot for my liking. Dry boozy finish. A little disappointment for me.","CuriousMonk","Jun 01, 2011"

Copious amounts of yeast sediment remain in the bottle, this could either be good or bad depending upon how the yeast reflects in the glass. Smell is dark coffee and not much else, possibly some slight caramel in the back. First taste has this malt forward brew brining the malt bitterness of black patent roasted malt, followed by a subdued sweetness and an even more subdued smokiness which is a nice surprise. Yeast is barely detectable in this cornucopia of flavors, all jockeying for my attention; this is so much that it takes me a quarter of a glass before I even find the alcohol (12%), and even then it is perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel of this beer is something somewhat of perfection- it keeps the malt char, sweetness and smokiness all in line and playing beautifully with eachother on my palate. The carbonation is perfect, and I can see now why there was so much yeast sediment- as to even reach this modicum of CO2 a damn near entire yeast starter slurry is needed to survive the flavor and alcohol. Very drinkable, I wish I had more of it here in the PNW.","youradhere","Beers"

The flavors are of conflicting chocolate (both sweet and bitter), oaky smoke, and alcohol. It's good but not as good as it could be. The strongest aspect of this beer has got to be the mouthfeel. It drinks exceptionally smooth and also lighter than it looks. It's velvety smooth. Overall this is a very fine beer but it misses on a few levels.

The flavors meld together well and make up for what's lacking in the body. Lots of bitter dark chocolate, cold coffee, almond, and the finish is hintingly tart. I like this.

Not much to stick around, but spotty lacing looks pretty good. This has a really big nose. Big earthy smells all around; tobacco and faint whiff of alcohol. Dates and prunes and other dark fruits are present alongside a faint aroma of bitter chocolate. This smells great, at 12 percent, I expect to smell a little alcohol, regardless, I'm having trouble getting my nose out of this one to taste it. To my disappointment, the smell was better than the taste. I love the dark fruits that I'm tasting and hint of rich chocolate. I generally prefer something to be a little more roasty, but the dark fruit flavor is really nice. A little too much alcohol heat for good drinkability, but the mouth feel is good.

This one pours a bleak nothingness, like the background of a later Goya painting, topped by a light head of tan bubbles. The nose comprises chocolate syrupe, maple syrup, molasses, a hint of soy sauce (odd...), roasted dark malts, brown sugar, figs, and some light coffee. Now that's some impy stout goodness, mm-hmm. The taste dives a bit, though: The roasts are all a bit too roasted, the sweetness is a bit too sweet, the strange soy sauce element returns (though not all that much), and a strong bit of leather comes swooping in uninvited. It's just all too much in too many different directions, if that makes any sense. Still, it somehow stays away from going too far in those myriad directions. It's hard to explain, but I think I can sum it up thusly: It's not what it should be (by any measure), but it's still not entirely objectionable. Yeah. Something like that. The body is a light heavy, with a high-light carbonation (deal with that, if your puny mind can, bwa-ha-ha!) and a smooth, fluid feel. Overall, I was not all that happy with this stout. Dark Horse has done some great things, but this one misses pretty far. Add the relatively high ABV, and the drinkability suffers. Still worth a try, though, if you ask me.","TMoney2591","Jun 30, 2010"

Full-bodied, yet smooth with nice fluidity, honestly, here the relatively weak carbonation helps to keep the pace going rather than fluff things up. Dark chocolate, cocoa, mocha and caramel, not so much coffee or real roast. Plum, cherry, raisin, fig, apricot fruit lends sweetness and concentration. The coconut, vanilla fudge, honey glazed dough and croissant flakes likewise. Hard to say both what the hops contribute and what they were meant to contribute.

This one is aggressive needing some age yet still a necessary drinking experience for any beer lover. I used to not be able to get any Dark Horse now that it's distributed in Ohio I've seen most of their beers come through, I really like their standards and their limited releases have been outstanding. Extremely sweet creamy sweet it could use a bit more hop balance than this, really it has anise (black licorice) a touch of soy sauce tones, and some dark fruit with soothing alcohol tones...strong espresso and dark chocolate this is one big ass stout. There's nothing here screaming hop bitterness I just wish it had more of that.

This beer pours a very inky black with the slightest formation of a tan head. My initial impression of the nose was that it smelled similar to a DFH World Wide Stout or Bell's Batch 9000. Initially very sweet, sugary, and syrupy smell. However, after a moment a robust and roasty smell dominates. The taste of this beer is superbly solid. Well balanced, beautiful roasted malt flavor dominates, without the slightest hint of alcohol. A perfect example of what a Russian Imperial Stout should taste like. Reminds me a bit of Old Rasputin. Carbonation in the beer is moderate. with a slight watery feel as the beer passes through to the end of the palate, but finished dry. Very enjoyable brew and by far my most favorite Dark Horse to date. Strongly recommended.","phishisphunk","Apr 13, 2010"

It's kinda like a big Oatmeal Stout with the creamy texture, slickness, and weight. Lightly carbonated, the beer falls still fairly quickly and doesn't lift off of the tongue the way I like. A balanced roastiness never prefers the char or the toffee malts. Milk flavors and sweetness round out the herbal hops, sharp roasted grains, and alcohols.

This beer is up there in Dark Horse's line-up, along with Perkolator and Double Crooked Tree.","TurdFurgison","May 11, 2009"

The aroma is caramel chocolate, and raisin. Taste is the same, nice hop balance bitter coffee with a little bit of lactose and vanilla. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, like the oily pour would suggest. Highly drinkable, though you better not be a lightweight. Once again a SOLID effort from a brewery that has puts out a lot of winners. I applaud Dark Horse for putting out some great and fairly priced four packs of specialty beers.","littlekidlover","May 11, 2009"

Some vanilla and barrel like qualitites. Finishes with some more chocolate and light espresso. Drinks well, but is filling. Another excellent stout offering from Dark Horse.

It just doesn't taste like what I'm used to, it's not really smooth, it's thick but not smooth and that alone sort of makes the whole drinking experience suffer for me, where the beer might actually taste better than I am rating it, but the feel made me think that it tastes worse than it actually is.

A tasty and easy, not challenging RIS, that has everything I like in one without being overpowering.","jeonseh","Mar 23, 2008"
4.58,6.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Wow, they really did bottle this again. Huge thanks to Kkulacki for this one. A big surprize. Pours extremely still, with only a small, belated rising of tiny brown bubbles. ring of bubbles holds throughout and lacing makes the whole deal look tremendous. Body is oil slick black. Strong, sweet chocolate truffle odor. really, exactly like a choco truffle. some maple, burnt malts. hint of vanilla, cherry. Flavor is at first quite extreme on the burnt side of the spectrum. like licking a grill. It quickly becomes a decadent prism of flavors though...more of that truffle-like chocolate, burnt malts, vegetal hops, coffee grounds, bitterness. The finish and lingering flavor is of a toasted chocolate marshmallow. Creamy, viscous mouthfeel. Very thick. A tasty, tasty treat, all around. Please Konrad, may i have another?","aforbes10","Mar 14, 2008"
3.57,-17.2,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad beer overall but, given my excellent past experiences with other brews from Dark Horse, I expected a little more than I got. Drinkable but not terribly memorable.","knight84","May 17, 2007"
3.72,-13.7,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Intense dark chocolate and roasted barley flavors up front. Very baking chocolatey with strong espresso bitterness. Some sweetish dark fruits underneath and lurking alcohol warmth. Finish is herbal hop bitterness and more intense coffee/baking chocolate bitterness. Not bad, although it seems to be lacking some complexity. A little too baking chocolate-y and coffee bitter. Medium body seems a little light for the style and intense flavors. Maybe a bit undercarbonated too. Still a decent beer, just not as great as I was hoping for!","alexgash","Aug 05, 2006"

Dark Horse Imperial Stout impressed be, taking 3rd place for me, among 19 other Imperials. Black. Rich malts in the nose, with hints of chocolate, roast, fruit, tar and tocacco. Flavor is full of charred fruits and chocolate. A very good Imperial Stout.","Crosling","Beers"
3.82,-11.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer is pretty nice, but I can't help but think that at least a slight level of carbonation would have made this beer quite a bit better (in both its aromatic and flavor qualities). In fact this beer would be approaching stellar if it was a bit carbonated.","Gueuzedude","0"
4.37,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours black with no head at all. I spent a few minutes trying to look through the glass to no avail. Smells mostly of chocolate, some roasted coffee. Taste is of sweet chocolate, slight hints of espresso, and some roasted bitterness. Coffee is really present in the aftertaste. I'm not a huge stout fan but this could definitely help change my mind. Silky smooth and pleasent mouthfeel with little to no carbonation. This is the fastest I've ever finished a 750ml in one sitting.","TheBlackMallard","Sep 16, 2005"

3.94,-8.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This Dark Horse stout pours an increadibly dark black color with purple hues and no head whatsoever. Looks like motor oil. Carbonation was lacking. Aroma is plums, charcoal, molasses, vanilla bean, and alcohol esters. Taste begins sweet with a chocolate syrup consistency. Fruity flavors, dark fruits, open this beer up esp when it gets warmer. Bitter chocolate comes then the finish is this really roasted grain astringency. I loved this beer but it finishes a little too harsh for my liking. I would also like some carbonation to liven up the mouthfeel. Nice and thick and rich, this could be really really good if they tweak a few things.","granger10","May 26, 2005"
3.85,-10.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Feel is smooth and quite quick with a moderate silky medium heftified body. As it finishes it gains a bit more heavier tone and character. Mild and sweetly dark with partial chocolate and dark fruit layers build a bit as it goes. Not quite what I was expecting given the other Dark Horse goodies I've had and liked, but good enough to try. Give me their Black Bier though and I'll be content enough.","tavernjef","May 01, 2005"
4,-7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours thick opaque black, nearly entirely devoid of head - even after quite the vigorous pour. My nostrils are assailed by oily pungency - coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted grain, and even a hint of dark fruit. Taste is what you would expect based on the aroma, just a little weaker. Starts out with coffee and chocolate, subtle raison is noted. Some roasted grain comes in, and is most noticeable in the aftertaste. Hops are barely discernable, but are there in meek form. Mouthfeel is not as thick/chewy as I would have expected, but it is still pleasantly oily. Decent imperial stout. As cheap as these are, I wouldn't mind grabbing another and putting some age on it.","BeerFink","Apr 25, 2005"
2.65,-38.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Overall a nice full-bodied Imperial, though very unbalanced. Alcohol sharpness is very intrusive and mouthfeel is watery and uneventful. Nice bold dark roasted malt flavors, but get squelched by the alcohol presence. Bold, strong but unrefined.","malty","Apr 03, 2005"
3.92,-9,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer definitely looks thick as it pours, and I was convinced it was flat as I completed the pour. However, after a few moments a thin layer of dark brown bubbles formed atop the beer, only to disappear before I made it to a comfortable place to sit. The aroma has a slight hint of musty fruit, intermingled with coffee, alcohol, and brown sugar notes. The flavor is powerful, with highly evident tobacco flavors that are accented by coffee, cocoa, and pure alcohol. A bit of an earthy note is in there as well, with a moderate sweetness wrapping things up. Mouthfeel is very silky and seems nearly devoid of carbonation, even though visibly carbonation is evident. Drinkabilty is surprisingly good for such an assertive beer. Not sure how old this one is, but a few years of age would have rounded it out nicely. Yet another fine beer from this ""Dark Horse""...","aaronh","Mar 31, 2005"

4.47,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed only the slightest layer of brown bubbles over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Lacing is more or less non-existent, but the viscosity of the brew does leave a nice film when the glass is swirled, which I think should be worth something. Aroma is heavy oatmeal and dark fruits. Taste strikes first with the soft oatmeal, then the fruit chimes in for a moment, eventually giving way softly to more dark malts, and some coffee bitterness at the close. Warmth is evident upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth for such a heavy beer, no doubt the oats' doing, and drinkability is quashed a bit by the heartiness of the malts, but overall for the style this brew is reasonably approachable. Check it out yourself and make sure I've made the right call.","ppoitras","Jan 30, 2005"

4.17,-3.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Interesting beer and hard to rate for some reason. Dark Horse has something of a penchant for stouts, and this doesn't really disappoint. A bit intense through the first sip or two, but give it a few minutes -- it really gets quite good.","marburg","Beers"
4.08,-5.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours thick, black, and almost flat. A very tiny ring of brown head formed around the edge of the glass, even after a hard pour. Smells of coffee, molasses, fuggles (a type of English hop), and some alcohol. Tastes of coffee, chocolate syrup, and a faint alcohol. This beer is really sweet and the flavors I've described above are really strong. The roast flavors almost have a feeling about them...like tiny roast bits of grains sand-papering my tongue. Also a note about the chocolate, it's a delicate and sofisticated chocolate, not a dry (baker's chocolate) or waxy (Nestle's) chocolate. The sweet hangs around heavy and hot on the back of the tongue. This is definitely a thick-bodied beer, which is appropriate for the style. Not sure the ABV, but I'll bet it's high. I could still pick out the alcohol burn despite the 'in-your-face' potent sweet, roast, and chocolate flavors. I recommend this beer for those interested in the style.","mentor","0"
