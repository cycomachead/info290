"Not worth the hype. And where's chocolate? Just bitter."
""
""
"Not as sweet as I thought it would be- which is nice."
"Solid beer, I'm a huge Foothills fan, but I don't get all of the hype...nice chocolate notes, creamy and smooth, but over-hyped"

"Overall, a good chocolate stout.  Not worth the hype especially in the south."
""

"Poured a black body with one finger head that died quick with no lace.  A roasted cocoa presence first greets my nose and then possible burnt or coffee notes as there is a little more than dark chocolate in aroma.  This how beer tastes as it is not your typical RIS in terms of being overly dry, roasted, burnt, charred, but while there is a dry malt presence (and hidden ABV), there is more of a dark, bitter chocolate vibe that adds balance and sweetness.  Pretty enjoyable beer that hit the spot for me."

"10oz draft pour. The head was pretty stellar."

"I am a stout man. I have re-named winer ""stout season"" because that makes me happy. This beer is rich with a stronger chocolate-smoothness than most, so it delivers on the name. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts it will not disappoint."

"Draft.  Pours a deep molasses purple black.  Aromas of molasses, toffee, abd dark fruit like prunes.  Tastes much the same with a little espresso.  Solid imperial stout.  Fruity.  Chocolate.  Love the taste of toffee and molasses.  Medium in the mouth.  Little to no bitter hoppiness.  Roasted malts.  Great taste.  Highly recommend."

"the barrel aged version of this is apparently something splendid and worthy of the top beers in the world designation. the base beer is really nice too, although not what i expected. sometimes i see top beers biased to region, like the people here cant get the stuff the bruery does, so this becomes the best stout out there, or the toppling goliath people, or the central waters region, they all think their own beers are the best, so they get jacked up on here. fine with me. this one to me comes across a lot more like a black ipa than it does a stout, really interesting dryness and hop intensity not normally found in the style. its got a salted cocoa sort of flavor to it on the malt, and only a little bit of front end bitterness. the hops are heavy in the finish, pine family and aggressive. it wipes out some of the richness and nuance built in the grain profile, but i like that its so different. im not sure how the barrel would effect this, sweet whiskey and the hops, they must fade out a fair bit in that edition, or else its entirely unique to itself. fuller medium body but not at all sludgy and heavy, which i like. impressive overall, but its hard to picture the acclaimed barrel aged edition from the base beer in this instance."

"I have to be brutal here and say despite having high expectations for this well regarded stout, I find it one of the worst stouts out there. It has no complexity. Solely dark chocolate and the worst tasting gas station coffee caught up in a horrific amount of bitterness throughout the beer and especially in the finish. The IBUs are absurdly high, 85, why would you do that in a stout? This is brittle, miserable and painful to drink. It's a struggle not to drain pour."

"Poured out with a creamy tan head which stuck around longer than most stouts and leveled to a thin covering. A little bit of lacing as well. Sticking the noise into a snifter revealed notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, booze, and sweet tobacco. Taste went well along with the smell. Chocolate and a touch of vanilla and coffee. Mouthfeel was just a bit lacking for a stout, but good carb balance. Overall a pretty good beer which I would try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a viscous looking black with a thin tan head that provides some lacing and minimal residual oil. The nose is roasted toffee, bitter cocoa, slightly resinous hops, and a hint of ethanol. There is almost a cloying toffee sweetness in the taste, which is followed by abrasive bitterness (fades with time), lingering roast and background chocolate. It's medium-heavy bodied with average carbonation, big roasty sweetness, minimal overt chocolate, heavy bitter hops, and burning ethanol that dissipates over time. This beer is tasty and I can easily see how it could withstand/improve in the barrel, but reminds me too much of a more pricey choco yeti."
"Yep!"

"The peripherals to this stout were spot on but the immense dryness didn't suit my expectations."

"My mind isn't blown but I've been wanting to try this for a few years and I'm in no way disappointed. Now I am really stoked to try the bourbon barrel version because I can see this responding well to a barrel treatment. If you enjoy the roasty, bitter stouts then this is certainly worth checking out."

"Overall a good stout, and one worth trying. Price point may be off putting for some, but since mine was a gift, it was well worth it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is very ""okay"". The name implies a thick, decadent, luscious stout, but this is anything but. It's thin, dry, bitter, and unrefined. And at nearly $20 a bottle, this is an incredibly poor value. I'm not sure where this beer received its great reputation...I found it instantly forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer. It may not be the end-all Imperial stout, but it is worth actively seeking out in my opinion. I was lucky enough for it to show up at a local bar."
""
""
"A little more body would probably get this beer a decent uptick of .5 or so."
"Poured into a Sexual Chocolate teku. Room temperature. Abyssmal black color, with two fingers of rocky mocha head that settled to a ringlet, leaving some soapy lacing on the glass. Dark roasty malts in the nose, distant raw cocoa, some herbal hop bitterness. Taste was surprisingly bitter, roasted dark malts and espresso, toasted grains, char, raw cocoa was present but quite muted, herbal and citrusy hops. This was really a let-down. Basically a plain stout, and pretty homebrewy, which is mostly the impression I've gotten from all of Foothills' beers thus far. Really neither sexual nor chocolate. Body was medium, mouthfeel thin, bitter and somewhat harsh, well, far from smooth anyway. The higher ABV was on the subdued side at least. I was glad to have gotten to try this, but it was a major disappointment."
"TOTAL - 40/50"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a delicious beer. Loving the contrast between the sweet chocolate and intense bitterness. Get it if you can!"
""
"O- this one is definitely smooth and chocolaty with a near perfect mouthfeel and some nice dark fruity notes to compliment the chocolate. However, it wasn't quite as multi-deminsional that I had expected due to the immense hype of this beer. I had a 2013 BBA Sexual Chocolate after this and it enjoyed it much more. I'd seek out the BBA version again, but probably not the regular."
""
""
""
"Overall this brings the roast and char, but there's some acidic almost vinegar quality that just overloads and ruins the experience. Would really like some chocolate flavor on this and doesn't really get it done. It's char profile is also identical to its porter and reminds me much of it, which is another beer from Foothills I just don't care for. Just a bit too much bitter, acrid, and oily. Doesn't come off quite right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With a name like Sexual Chocolate I would have expected a more in your face chocolate aroma, this beer has a mild chocolate aroma. Good thickness and mouthfeel, solid from start to mid to finish. The IBUs shine through with a bite at at the end that reminds you that you are drinking an imperial stout. Would recommend this beer but not for the price."

"Overall I can imagine the BA version is great because this is a very solid stout"

"On draft at brew pub"

"Poured on-tap in a 12 ounce vase, the beer is jet black, creamy and thick, with a dark brown, low profile head. Nose of dark, bitter cocoa nibs, sweet cream, and earthy highlights. Flavors are heavily roasted and bitter cocoa forward, with a creamy, smooth, rich cream overlay, and a chocolate and rich molasses backbone. Smooth and heavy in mouth, with a bitter mocha and cream aftertaste. The finish is smooth, with a bittersweet linger. Bravo! This is a damn tasty brew!"
""

"O: Better than I expected. Was expecting a sweet chocolate/coffee bomb but got a very deep dark roasted bitter chocolate bomb. Thanks again Josh!"

"O: This was a nice RIS with a light dash of smoke underneath. Would enjoy again, but not in the upper echelon of RIS's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a world class RIS though definitely above average. Gets a bit too much hype that wouldn't be there if this weren't so rare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite good but I can see why all the hype surrounded the BA version instead of this base beer. Thank you BlackBelt5112203 for my first taste of Foothills."
""
""
""
""
"Note: 2012 vintage"
""
""
""
"This is an undoubtedly solid RIS. There are some nice chocolate flavors, and a lot of burnt goodness. This was better than expected."
"Better than anticipated. A nice use of everything chocolate. Sweet and bitter and worth the name. I'm looking forward to a cellared bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and very enjoyable - the alcohol is very well hidden and there is a wonderful complexity to the balance. Overall the beer is well balanced by being neither too sweet nor too bitter. Very excited to finally review this one."

"sexual chocolate is a great name. i like the smell... smells creamy. and i like black beers and this one is really dark. the taste is nutty and woody.. i dont get much chocolate. its earthy. i have had better chocolate beers..(imperial mokah from southern tier and chocolate yeti from great divide). my biggest problem with this beer was the $16.50 price tag for a 22oz. this is a good beer.... dont get me wrong, but there are better beers for the price."

"O: While this beer doesn't quite live up to its hype, it's still a well made, easy to like beer. Drinkable."
""
""
"O – This is a nice RIS. Due to the name, I was expecting a bit more chocolate, but it has everything you could ask for in a beer of this style. It’s very drinkable especially given the ABV, and has a nice and thick mouthfeel. I think this beer might be a little hyped, but it’s still tasty nonetheless."
""
""
"Overall I can imagine this being a super revolutionary beer when it was first released but really it is just a good Imperial Stout. It's actually quite drinkable at less than 10% ABV but the flavor profile isn't so exciting that it needs to be sought out each year."

"Had on tap at Duckworth's in Ballentine in Charlotte, NC. Pours black with a nice brown head. Great roasty aroma also may be a touch of coffee as well. taste of dark chocolate, coffee, dark malts may be some espresso. Very well balanced and a very well done beer to say the least. Its definitely thick with pretty good carbonation. Overall I love this beer and if you can get your hands on I would recommend at least trying it."
"When I think of my favorite (non-barrel aged) imperial stouts, Founders is on the top of the list, but this one is a serious contender...it may even took first place! Really a great stout that could use a bit more aroma, but ultimately satisfying my Jungle Fever!"
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the more drinkable RIS's I've had. I'm glad the chocolate wasn't overdone, but I wish there was just a little bit more in the flavor. It's a very good RIS in my mind, but would have been a little better with a little more chocolate given the name of the beer. Maybe it's not the best RIS ever, but it's still a very good beer in my mind and worth a try if you run across one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer but I am not blown away by it. I really enjoy the chocolate and coffee flavors but it is just a little on the heavy side."
""
"O- good RIS, better than I expected actually even with the high rating. Has some sweetness and lots of chocolate, roast, and dark fruits."
""
"I was fortunate to find this beer at a local shop. It was however rather expensive, but due to the scarcity of this one I figured I would bite the bullet and shell out the cash. I chilled it to around 45 degrees and then pried off the cap. I poured it into a Imperial pint glass and let it breath for 10 minutes or so before I tasted. The glass was held up to a light and no transparency. It was very dark nearly obsidian in color. It smelled really nice and rich lots of chocolate, molasses and some coffee but not too much. I do not care for coffee stouts but since this one was more of a chocolate stout I figured I would give it a try. The first taste had a strong molasses taste not too cloying but more molasses than chocolate or coffee to me. As it warmed slightly the chocolate and coffee came in as well as the licorice. However, it still had an overpowering molasses taste. Which for the price and hype of this beer was its downfall. I would have expected more of a cocoa backbone. In regard to mouthfeel it was slightly watery but nothing that was overtly. I felt it was pretty well balanced from a texture point of view. Nevertheless, I would not give this beer as high of remarks as others in its category. Also, for the price it is overrated. As most stouts in this category I imagine this one could be aged. I just wonder if it would improve with age?"
""
""
"O - This is a better than average stout but it's not amazing. It's too watery for my taste and I found the smokiness to be slightly overpowering"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O Not one of my favorite imperial stouts to drink more often than not. But this one is a nice break with its bittered and flavorful attributes. Might want to pair it with something sweet to balance it out."
""
""
"O- nearly three years is too much to hold on to this beer. Wasn't a huge fan of it with that much age on it...oh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, awesome beer that lives up to the hype. Great chocolate flavors here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: just an average imperial stout that is IMO way overrated but just OK all around. Didn't see anything special about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Full bodied. Coats the mouth a ton."
""
"O: Really not very chocolaty. Not a bad stout, but seems rather basic. A bit of a let down based on the hype around it."
""
""
""
""
"Get your hands on these. Foothills is nailing this one."
""
""
""
"Very nice, through straightforward, imperial stout."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and some char aromas. Taste is much the same with a fairly high level of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."
"D - really nice cocoa / chocolaty brew. Glad I finally got to try this one - worth seeking out."
""
"This is a good imperial stout. It's pretty straightforward in the nose and taste - it's roasty and a it's chocolaty, in that order. Nothing more nothing less. It's pretty exceptional in terms of being really good and interesting without being hugely complex but in the grand scheme of things it's probably just below the the upper tier of big imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Apologies for the unhelpful review--I'm struggling with this one."
""
""
"O- A solid stout, has some really nice flavors, worth giving a shot."
"Pitch black beer with a short ring of head. Aroma is very roast and kind burnt with nice dry cocoa. Flavor is really similar. I think it could have used a bit of sweetness. Its good, dry toasty, almost smokey. Mouthfeel is medium with OK carb. A bit of a letdown."
""
""
"Not nearly the disaster some have made it out to be. It wasn't magnificent, but still enjoyable. The sips that didn't have too much smoke were quite delightful."
"O - A very good imperial stout. I expected (and would have liked) more chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a decent chocolate stout. Nothing to go crazy trying to trade for, but worth trying if you get a shot."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"A growler fill from GBX poured into pint glass. Beautiful dark black pour with no chance of light getting through! A generous mocca head stays for a bit and provides adequate lacing. Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate and cocco. Taste was just a little disappointing for me. I will preface this by saying, I got the last fill out of the station. Actually only got about 3/4 fill on my growler. It had quite a bit of a metalic taste to it and strong booze quality. With all the hype, I was wanting a smooth mix of booze, chocolate and malts but it just wasn't there. Feel was nice and creamy, like a good RIS should be. Adequate carbonation. Overall- I want to try this again and think it may have been an outlier due to the bottom of the keg. Just okay and letdown with the taste-"
""
"overall: this is a great beer that I have been wanting to try for a while. This beer is deservedly hyped. Ill def buy again if I can find it."
""
"Wife picked this up for me at the CBX, on tap. I've been waiting to finally get this for 2 or 3 years now, my ship has come! I was worried that all the hype on this beer would leave me disappointed. Glad to say, it lived up to the hype. While it's not the greatest beer I've ever had, it was a solid one. From the strong cocoa smell, to the dark color with the thick tan head, to the smooth finish. The taste was a good balance of malt, cocoa, and slight hops. Even though the alcohol is around 10%, it's hidden well. This beer makes a great night cap. I'm happy I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great beer"
"O: Overall, this comes together nicely. There is a more earthy flavor in here, but I sense it is well attenuated and not leaving behind overly sweet flavors like many of the high abv RIS of today are leaving behind. Recommended, but would not sell your arm and leg for a taste."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a real good beer but nothing spectacular.  Certainly worth trying if you get the chance but there are many better RIS out there.  Would like to find a bottle so I can drink it at the right temperature from the correct glassware."
""
"a pretty good stout that has eluded me for years, glad to finally taste it. i would seek this out again."
"Notes: This is good, not deserving the kind of hype I perceived kind of good but good in any case. Supposedly I was lucky to reach the last keg on this work visit to Winston-Salem, and taste the batch done on the premises. I was told that the one I tried in a bar nearby came from the batch brewed at the new location. From one day to the next I could not sense the difference. The second time around I had it on a pint shaker glass, typical reaction: good for the size, but again wrong glassware. Probably this brew shines more if served properly."
""
"2011 version, on tap at Sexy Chocolate Day 2011. Pours with a little head, tan lacing, a slight chocolate aroma, I was expecting a bit more chocolate, it was a bit subdued for me. Still, extremely smooth, well worth the hype, if only I was just getting a bit more rubustiness and full chocolate. I still like it."
""
""
""
""
"This wasn't bad by any means although it's nothing world class or even at the top of the Russian Imperial Stout style. And where the hell was the chocolate? There were good amounts of different flavors but they were too choppy, and unbalanced. I have the barrel-aged version which I hear great things about, let's hope that one is a bit better."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very happy to try this, but there are plenty of shelf brews that exceed this."
""
"D: This was a decent chocolate stout, but nothing special. The scent and taste were enjoyable but basic. The body was a little weak. And the finish was very hot, so it must be sipped. Might improve with age if it mellows a lot, but fresh honestly isn't very impressive."
""
"Tryed this on tap @Lindley Park Filling Station last night (2-10-12) and it's the 2nd time within a week that I've had Sexual Chocolate. I had the pleasure of experiencing the 2010 Sexual Chocolate Barrel Aged over Cocoa Nibs last Saturday @ the 1st Annual Raleigh Rare & Vintage Beer Tasting. Now that 	was 1 hell of a great beer. The 2012 draft version was not that impressive. Don't get me wrong, it's a great NC 	beer by a great NC brewer. But as far as a great beer in the grand scheme of Russian Imperial Stouts, it's excellent; but not great. While it is a brilliant marketing ploy to release 4000 bottles directly at the brewery 	only (which would piss me off if I was a store carrying all Foothill's other brews). Lesson learned, don't buy into all the hype/local cultist following; judge for thine self. There are just to many superior Russian Imperials (Old 	Rasputin, Brooklyn Dark Chocolate, Stone, Samual Smith's, Founders, and Siberian Night .. to name a few) that are readily available seasonally to even consider standing in line for 6+ hours (although I'm sure the beer share in line is way cool) on pre-release morning. Don't get me wrong, I am not bitter, nor mad; I like Foothills and 	love thier brew pub. It's just dissappointing to experience my 1st Sexual Chocolate year, with all of it's hype and 	national news coverage and then to experience it and have your sails deflated. If this brew came out of Wyoming, they would be lucky to sale 4000 bottles in a season, but here in NC that amount dissappears in less than a dozen hours. Kinda sad really. I'll try it again on tap if it's available, but for me; actively seeking it out is not on my things to do list."
""
""
"Well, this is the most I've paid for a pint so far (10 bucks). This is a great beer but doesn't meet the hype (what does?). A nice and full beer that, despite the name, doesn't have that much chocolate going on. Very drinkable and hides its alcohol well. No wateryness to speak of and nothing wrong with it at all. The metallic notes remind me a bit of a Baltic porter."
""
""
"O - Always enjoy waiting in line for this one."
""
"This is smooth, drinkable, and very enjoyable. The mouthfeel could be a little fuller, but overall it's warm, delicious, and very enjoyable. It's worth checking out."
"O: It's tough to measure the worth of a beer with this much hype. I fully understand folks who work their butts off to try this and find it falling short of their expectations; however, I live in NC - couple hours from the brewery, so I'm lucky enough to have this beer on draft (bottled if I work for it) many times each year, and while it's hyped to the nines, it's also a damn good beer. The rarity definitely drives the craving for this beer but let's not lose the fact that it's damn good."
""
""
""
"I've never had this from a bottle - standing in line in the cold, pre-dawn doesn't interest me...too much hype. On tap though, when I can find it, it is always excellent."
""
""
"O: Not a bad stout, but IMO didn't live up to the hype."
"O - I think this is a really good imperial stout. It's worth seeking out but I wouldn't stand in-line for it at 3 am. Doesn't quite hit that upper tier but is really nice."
""
""
""
""
"Hm taste isnt what I expected. With a name like Sexual Chocolate, I was expecting extreme chocolate, but what I get is an upfront bitterness from the dark chocolate and espresso that fades into a clean dark chocolate feeling. Still really good, but not world class."

""
""

"Pours black in color with a dark brown head which leaves behind a one-finger lacing throughout. Lacked the nice aromatics I was hoping to pick up on with this special-release brew which was the suggested big chocolate aroma with notes of espresso, blackstrap molasses, dark sweet toffee and dark fruit as the brewery suggested. There was a rough dark chocolate backbone with complex notes of coffee, dark toffee and dark fruit that didn’t sit well with me. I was hughely disappointed with this brew as I traded big for this one and Draft Mag rated this a must-try top 10 beer in 2011."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Body is definitely short of full; more in the medium body range. Moderate to low carbonation, which is the only reason this beer drinks smoothly at all. Overall, this is an interesting take on a RIS. Too smoke heavy and one dimensional. Definitely not my favorite from this style."
""
""
""
"It pours a full bodied dark, dark brown with a mocha colored one finger creamy head. It smells of sweet milk chocolate and little else. It's just a chocolate bomb, as to be expected. The flavors are initially very bitter with heavy roast as it eases into sweet milk chocolate. It definitely wasn't this bitter the first time I had it. It's somewhere between milk and dark chocolate because of this. It's solid, but nothing spectacular. It drinks medium in body and is a nice beer. It just isn't very complex and isn't as refined as it could be."

"Overall: This beer is a lot more bitter than it needs to be. I really would have liked this beer to be smoother and have a stronger chocolate presence."

"O - There are many off the shelve beers that I would rather have, I didn't want to penalize the rating because of how hard this was to get, The beer should stand on it's own rare or common, and this one was just not good."

"If you give me an 09, I would happily drink that often. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the 10 or 11. Overall this beer is decent but there are many readily available beers which can match or surpass the quality. Worth trying but not worth going out of your way for."

"O: All 10 people at our tasting thought this beer should have been called Sexual Smoke. There was very little sweetness, coffee or chocolate and we had it before we tried the barrel aged version which was 1000 x's better. I won't bother trading for this one again. Terrible let down!"
"mouthfeel/overall - thick bodied, good carbonation, a little sticky in the mouth."
"O: Good. Between BORIS and BCBS in a good way."
"Overall: This was not significantly better than any other number of imperial stouts and doesn't seem to warrant the praise it receives."
"Pours dark brown or even black with a very thin head. Aromas of chocolate, roasted sweet malt, and a touch of coffee. Taste of bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, and a hint of alcohol. This is another of those elusive brews I was glad to have tasted but just don't get the hype. A very quaffable brew but I'm not going to trade away the cellar to acquire a bottle of this."
"This is a good beer to try if you can find it. I just don't understand all the hype. Good Luck finding it, I had to trade my left n.. to get a bottle of it!"
"D/O - Drinkability is pretty high. I'll start with a disclaimer: Overall and generally, I felt this was a damn tasty beer throughout and really enjoyed drinking it. The issue I take with it, however, is that I don't think I got an overwhelming chocolate presence that would justify it being named after it. I'm not bashing the beer or it's name at all; for all I know, Foothills could've just picked the name based on it being catchy and exciting and because this beer actually does exhibit a semblance of chocolate. That being said, I can't say I didn't come into this beer expecting dominant chocolate ala Chokolat. I love coffee and coffee stouts, though, so I didn't mind the hostile takeover performed by the espresso in the taste. I hope I get the chance to try the barrel-aged version of this, because it seems like the bourbon would really transform the nuances of this beer."
"O - I am disappointed with this one. The smoke takes away from what I think is a decent amount of potential. It is evident throughout my entire 10-12oz pour. Chocolate only comes out after 6oz or so. Otherwise, I have to fight to find it. I'm not going to kill the score because I find it to be unique and it does get a lot better as the glass empties. Less smoke is my request. However, I can see how some people could really enjoy this. I think this is a smoked beer drinker's paradise. Unfortunately, it isn't my preference. I think the BA version will probably benefit from the smokiness though."
"OVERALL: This was an excellent beer, and dare I say it actually lived up to expectations. The average look and feel were a drawback perhaps, but the nose was enticing and the flavors wonderfully put together. This stout told a story, which sets it apart from many of the other imperial chocolate stouts out there. Unique in its conception and impressive in its execution, this one is well worth the hunt. In fact, its unique qualities led me to enjoy it more than the barrel aged version, which, while being a great barrel aged imperial stout in its own right, had dominated much of what made the base Sexual Chocolate special. Regardless, both are worth checking out if you can. Thanks again for sharing Doops, and thanks for sending these over John."
"If this was on my local shelves labled year round as something else, i wouldn't buy it, it doesn't taste good."
"Drinkability is excellent, and this bad mamma jamma has given me jungle fever!"
"O-- Good but not outstanding. Coffee and chocolate got bigger as I drank on with this. A bit overhyped I thought."
"You da man, John. Jeff thanks for helping me drink this bad boy!"
"2009 vintage. Bottle #604/1000. Another bottle shared before my buddy's wedding, his last beer as a single man. It pours a very dark black-brown (almost obsidian, but not quite) topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, light coffee, light oak, and light molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis on the chocolate, the coffee, and some added maple syrup. Everything's almost too sweet, clashing with the roast in a strange, though not altogether offensive way. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that edges to the brink of watery. Overall, a pretty decent impy stout, but it's much too thin and the flavors just don't work together very well. It's good, but nowhere near worth the hype."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I thought this beer was going to have a stronger chocolate flavor I guess mainly because of the name, however I really like the balance in the mouthfeel and flavor. The 9.7% abv goes virtually unnoticed in the finish. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to get a bottle of this beer. I probably will seek it out again really enjoyed it."
"Not bad but definitely a disappointment. One would expect more chocolate from a beer with chocolate in the name."
"Overall this one is a little dissapointing. Nothing bad or offensive here but just not what one would hope it would be."
"Drink- It was unremarkable for as much hype as this beer gets. I hope this was just a bad bottle or the vintage isnt as good as other. I probably wont trade for any other years after this one."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is quite tangy with alcohol and fruity hops intermingled. It is possibly more tangy and fruited than it is chocolaty which is surprising to me. Regardless it is excessively drinkable. As the brew evolved in my glass it took on a bit of a vinous, maybe even port-like quality. Overall a solid offering, one to seek out for sure."
" The taste has a lot of roast but mild chocolate, the nose carries more cocoa with a subtle spice note perhaps a bitter cocoa nib taste. The yeast adds a gentle twang of dark chocolate and slight coffee-like acidic note with slight berry undercurrent and mild toasted graininess. The dark malt is slightly astringent with a hint of hop bitterness coming in at the end of the taste. This was a great stout, I enjoyed it and was looking forward to having it in bottled form. I enjoyed a small sample on draft at Extreme beer fest, but that was years ago - this was pretty high in drinkability with some nice complexity and fits the style well. I can only guess that this is a beer you may want to taste fresh based on the cocoa flavor subtlety."
"A very good stout, the roastiness took some time to get used to but I wound up enjoying that element alot. I imagine this may be quite a different beer when fresh."
"Honestly this was a one time experience. I wouldn't drink it again if it was free. Meat filled boring garbage."
"A first I was skeptical but it grew on me with time and warmth. A good complexity opens up and it ends up very nice."
"Overall: Highly overrated. Old coffee with almost no chocolate. Thin and unbalanced. Tons of better beers in this style"
"o - overall, i agree that this beer gets hyped quite a bit, but that being said, it *is* a solid example of the style and the chocolate is rather nice and tasty. bear in mind that chocolate imperial stouts are all the rage these days...they weren't always. i find this beer to be worthy even in today's beer market, but the way people go nuts for stuff, it is understandable that many folks were let down on this beer...after all, it is just beer and although tasty with a nice hint of gourmet chocolate...drinking this beer will not give you super powers. delicious like a marshal zhukov."
"O: A really good beer. The balance between the more harsh chocolate, hops, coffee, and alcohol provides for an evolving taste you will enjoy to the last drop."
"O: This thing should not have the word ""Chocolate"" in the title it should be Sexual Smoke. There was very little sweetness."
"This is quite tasty and there is no way that I'd guess that it was 9.75%abv, if I didn't know. Way more complex than expected. I'd be a very happy guy if I were ever able to get more bottles of this one!"
"Served in snifter."
"Overall impression: Solid, not great imperial stout that's worth a try."
"Dark brown, light khaki head, sparse lacing. Holy smokiness! There's a quite a bit of smoked malt in the nose, charred wood, tons of roast and a bit of licorice. Taste is right on par. I don't think I've had a more smokey IS. Lots of charred malts, very woody, very light chocolate present, but can't get past this smokey flavor. It's not bad, but odd and unexpected. Very earthy tasting, hoppy, some anise, licorice, and more dark bitter chocolate than the nose let on. Very interesting, very dry. Needs maybe a bit more sweetness to round things out. Mouthfeel is medium-full, perfect carbonation. Sexy Chocolate? More like Sexy Smoke! Good overall, but again, needs a bit of sweetness to balance the smoke."
"GFunk"
"O - Good stout - not especially complex however. Would like to see this a bit more nuanced with flavors. This is my second go around with Sexy Chocolate, unfortunately, this reinforced my initial thoughts...think hype builds this one up a bit. In our blind taste, this was a middle of the pack beer. Much prefer the barrel aged version of this."
"Overall - its good but not great. I enjoyed it but its too much like the Alaskas smoked Porter and that's more available than this."
"O- Really glad I tried this beer, and Im glad it did not get any older. I've been running into mad infection issues with craft stouts recently and it's really turned me off of the style completely."
"Creamy and fluffy and light on the palate, this beer doesn't feel like nearly 10% ABV. The flavors are intense, and I can see that this is a beer that someone would either love or hate. I love the proportions of leather and tobacco, such underused flavors in imperial stouts. Great stuff, to be sure."
"Poured into a ccb snifter. Pours dark black with a 1 finger head that lasts seconds. A thin ring forms around the glass with very little lacing. Aroma isn't bad, coffee and chocolate all the way. The taste is where there is a problem. Chocolate then coffee then a really off taste, something I'd never like to taste again. I don't like to throw around claims of infection but if this isn't infection what the heck are they putting in their beer. Very disappointing for a very hyped brew."
"Poured a very nice black color with no light pearing through. Head formed great and was a melted chocolate color. The aroma was roasty and was matched with a thick sweet smell. I enjoyed the aroma and looked forward to this tasting part! The brew has a nice medium body to it that pushes the sweet roasty flavors through. It reminded me a lot of NEB Imperial Stout Trooper. Overall a enjoyable brew that I would trade for depending on the request. Will hopefully make it to the next release to grab some my self."
"O- well this is not a good beer, nope not at all. I'm glad I opened it now rather then waiting till winter. Who knows how bad it would have been by then."
"Overall- Great beer. Would like just a little more age on this."
"D= A very drinkable RIS that I liked quite a lot. I don't know if it deserves the extent of the cult following it has but its a damn good beer all the same."
"Overall, it is quite tasty, and I enjoyed drinking it, but I really don't think it's anything to wait in line for or something."
"O: Overall, I wasn’t very impressed with this beer. The chocolate was not nearly as smooth or well-done as I had hoped. Across the bored it was fairly bland and uninteresting. Hopefully the barrel-aged version is better…I hope to crack that one sometime soon."
"Overall, this beer is thin, bland, and way overrated."
"Pours dark black with little dark tan head.  Smell some chocolate, booze, slight yeast.  Taste some malts, some chocolate, boozy. I wonder if I would have liked this better a year ago, without aging it, hmmm.  Mouthfeel is kinda thin, drinkability is high, although overrated, IMHO."
"O: Worth the hype."
"All in all, the '09 is phenomenal! The '10 is horrible and the '11 is bearable. How can 3 years be so different? Wow. Get the '09 if you go for any of them."
"This is so easy to drink. I like that it's fairly low in the frills department. Some folks may not care for the dry/bitter combo but I enjoy it. Recommended."
"Of course, your mileage may vary."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I thought this beer was going to have a stronger chocolate flavor, however I appreciate the balance in the mouthfeel and flavor. The 9.7% abv goes virtually unnoticed in the finish. This beer certainly lives up to the hype."
"The taste is also surprisingly devoid of chocolate (and sex for that matter, although my expectations were much lower in that regard). Bitter roast espresso has the featured position. Some light smoke and maybe a bit of baker's chocolate provide some added depth. There's a lot to digest by mid-sip, but the beer begins to fall apart at the finish line with some astringency and alcohol heat. This is a perfectly fine stout, but it needs more sweetness to provide complexity and balance."
"O: One of the most balanced, easy drinking, creamy smooth imperial stouts I've ever had. Alcohol is undetectable. Perfect."
"Overall this is a great brew, but falls a little short of the brewery only release hype. If you've had Old Raspy' or Stone IRS don't fret not having Sexual Chocolate."
"Warning, dont drink 2 and post!"
"Pours a very deep dark black with a sort of thick brown head and a little lacing. Smells awesome! Smells of tons of coffee and chocolate! For once in this beer, you can actually find the chocolate! Tastes of coffee and more coffee and more coffee and more coffee, and then some malts, smokiness, and chocolate. This beer should be called Sexual Coffee. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with a medium carbonation."
"Overall this beer benefitted from the cask treatment as the cocoa nibs were able to shine with gusto. My one qualm with the cask conditioning is that the mouthfeel suffers slightly. Still, if you see this beer on cask don't hesitate, it'll go fast as it well should, very much worth a shot."
"D - Quite a drinkable beer. Although I don't know if I would really seek this one out again. It was good once, but not the most ""wow"" brewery only release beers I've ever had."
"D - Very high drinkability factor for such a high ABV. It is not that noticeable and not too intense."
"Drinkability:Delicious. This is a dark malt forward beer. Great complex chocolate flavors. This beer is a definite sipper."
"Poured a Dark black with a brownish hue when held up to the light. Moderate head with a faint amount of lacing on side of glass and some bubbles. I got a slight amount of chocolate on the nose with some cocoa powder and raster coffee. Taste was very dry and bitter chocolate, slight toffee and roasted malts as it warmed up. Pretty carbonation on the mouthfeel, creamy and not too thick. Would probably drink again with friends, but not a huge fan of the bitter chocolate taste."
"D - pretty good for a big beer like this."
"Overall, this was a very solid Russian Imperial Stout. I would be very interested in trying the barrel aged version in the future. I think, in retrospect, this beer could've been better with a little bit more age. As it is, I missed most of the chocolate flavor and the alcohol might've been a bit more forward for a sub-10% alcohol beer and maybe some time in the cellar would've improved these characteristics. Still, a really good beer and I'm glad I tried it. Cheers!"
"D. If you really like bitter dark chocolate, you'll love this. If you're not a dark chocolate fan avoid. Pretty good, but much less sweet than I expected."
"D-very drinkable. I wanted my taste to last alot longer than it did."
"Pours dark black with a good amount of light brown head. Te head slowly dissipates leaving a touch of lacing on the glass. Smells chocolately like dark cocoa powder. A bit of bitterness from the cocoa even on the nose. Tastes like drinking cocoa powder. Especially when it's cold. Opens up a bit as it warms up. Too bitter and dry for my tastes. I was expecting this to be sweeter but alas. It's well carbonated and certainly drinks fairly easily for a 10% beer but the bitter dryness decreases the enjoyment of this beer."
"O - The beer is a huge letdown. I expected more cocoa and buttery sweetness, like other delicious chocolate stouts. What we have is another roast bomb. I hope the BA versions could top this, and mellow out that harsh roasted flavor, as I have 2 of them. Biggest disappointment of 2011 so far. Shame too. Glad I got to try it though."
"D-Very good but you feel glutinous while drinking the Sexual Chocolate due to the extreme nature of it's flavour. Too awesome to not feel guilty."
"HV"
"D- since it is one of 600 bottles made I'll savor it but it still doesn't compare to some of the the other chocolates I've had."
"D: I may now have to seek out the barrel aged version. After getting my bottle last year I was thinking it might actually fall into the over-hyped camp, but considering what I gave up for it I'm very pleased. It really stood out against all the other stouts."
"Thought this would be a little sweeter."
"As for drinkability, this was a potent sipper. But I was happy to drink a couple full snifters worth from Ryan's growler. Certainly a solid beer. Seth - I sincerely hope your bottle isn't infected, 'twould be a damn shame."
"D - Probably one of the best Foothills beers I've had. Really enjoyed this beer although not quite on-top"
"Big thanks to Jeff and Ryan is deserved here. This is a long time want, and I fear the bottle I have is an infected mess. I really wish I could drink this every year."
"D: High, at about 10% ABV i was feeling it halfway thru my first glass, so I cant recommend this on an empty stomach or when you need to do something afterword. But it is fantastic after a large meal. Skip desert and drink this."
"D: I really enjoyed this, but I still would still pick others I like more because of more complex malt flavor."
"Overall good, but doesn't hit my expectation.Nonetheless, extremely good."
"I enjoyed this brew at a Rare Stout night tasting, thanks to CampusCrew and the other generous BAs. This is a fine made imperial stout for sure, but not one of the standouts as we expected during our 20+ bottle tasting. This seems a bit overly hyped, but still an impressive stout indeed."
"Maybe not as good as the hype, but it has character and stands out from a lot of the same old imperial stouts I've had."
"drinkability: we had a rare sout party is this was one of the selectons. I was a little diasppotinted here with this one. Hyped up alot. Good, not all world though."
"Barley's Taproom in Asheville had it on tap, so I took the plunge. Served in a 10.5 oz goblet, it appeared a bit viscous, color like a black hole that became brown for second, but still captured all the light. Medium brown head sank quickly. Smelled of dark roast coffee with bittersweet chocolate and a hint of sweetness lifted out by an ethanol note. This is a very well made beer, with few defined edges when tasting. Great mouthfeel, tastes rather like licking bittersweet chocolate which has been dipped in strong coffee. Not really complex, but tasty. I don't think it is amazing, but a very good beer which buried the 10% alcohol expertly. The gentleman next to me offered that ""that's a good beer"" and followed with ""all beer is good - it's wet and it has alcohol"". I discovered he had downed three of the Sexual Chocolate from his forelorn looking wife when he went to the bathroom. Prost!"
"Drinks very easy, ABV is concealed nicely. I enjoyed this one, not the best out there, but one I would buy on a regular basis if possible, reminds me a lot of Victory at Sea, I'm sure the barrel aged version is even tastier"
"2011 Vintage! Served from firkin into a shaker. Poured pitch black with a minimal khaki colored head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and vanilla. THe flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, and slight sweet malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew as always. This could probably use some carbonation, which made it better from the tap in my opinion. Had the tap version right after a glass from the firkin and enjoyed it quite a bit more due to the additional carbonation. Good well balanced flavor and aroma going on here. An absolute must try for sure."
"D: Overall, a good imperial stout. Not the greatest or necessarily worth the hype, but a good stout nonetheless."
"The lighter mouthfeel though contributes to a higher drinkability. A very well made and pleasant to drink beer. I'm not so sure it belongs in the upper echelon of ""big"" imperial stouts, but I have had it many times and enjoyed it thorougly every time."
"I had 3 pints of this stuff during dinner and easily could have had more. Yeah...it's THAT good. Seek this stuff out. NOW."
"With a little bit of age in proper storing conditions, I honestly believe this young and brash 2011 vintage will be marvelous, as the '09 was remarkable."
"D: I'm giving the 2008 an A- and the 2011 a B+. However, both are very worthy entries in a very competitive style."
"Pours jet black with a tan like head. In the aroma, sweet chocolate, roasty malt, and an alcohol hint. In the taste, chocolate, a bit creamy and a roasty malt all the way through. A small bite and a medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry chocolate aftertaste. 85 IBUs but not too hoppy, hides the alcohol, but can still feel the heat, but a nice chocolate flavor."
"I have been saving this beer and finally figured what the hell might as well open it. This is a good beer, on par with the other 'big' name RIS's. Of course the label art alone makes this beer a must have."
"D: Overall I would like another. It's a good and interesting beer that can rival several other big stouts rated higher in my opinion. Worth trying. 4/5"
"Beers with this much hype surrounding them can oftentimes disappoint. This one does not, I am not sure that it is the best RIS that I have ever consumed, but it definately deserves the fanfare."
"MF/D: the bitterness certainly affects the drinkability, but the mouthfeel was still fairly smooth, and all-in-all enjoyable."
"Big, big thanks to Cobi for this one!!!!"
"D- Ok to drink. I think this one might be part of the hype machine."
"D: Very drinkable for the ABV. Goes down easily. Honestly was not expecting this big of a beer to be so drinkable."
"A disappointment, if not a terribly BAD beer."
"D- Tasty overall.. still not fantastic and complex as I had expected."
"Back to the beer, I said it already, it was all pickles, vinegar, yet heavily bitter and charred, high carbonation. Not drinkable."
"As one would expect, a chocolate-centric Russian Imperial Stout. Unsweetened cocoa with a bit of instant coffee up front. Bittering has a slight sharp, almost tart edge. Full-bodied in the mouth, with the ETOH showing up with a little heat, but not too prominent. A very nice, if a little overly-hyped, RIS."
"Drinkability is quite good. Much smoother than what I remember at the release, which was about 7.5 months ago. Guess I can say this one is holding up well. I'm excited to see where it goes in the next couple of years. Not quite worth the hype it gets, but still a very solid RIS that is worth getting a hold of."
"Overall it is a very different beer than I remember from on tap at the release. It's mellowed out quite a bit. I don't know that aging will make it any more to my taste, but it's a nice drink the way it is now."
"Doesn't quite live up to the hype-train, but this is an amazing beer nonetheless. If you're put off by the hype, send it my way, I'll dispose of it for ya!"
"Very disappointing overall."
"A super dark black brown with a light brown head. Decent size but only spots and streaks on the sides as it fades. Smell is rich and roasty. Chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts. Pumpernickel breadiness. A touch of vanilla and a bit of cherry. Quite nice. Taste is a real treat here. Chocolaty espresso and toffee. A bit of molasses and burnt caramel. A big charcoal and earth hoppiness in the finish. Feel is great with a nice round chewiness and thick syrupy coating of the tongue. Carbonation is creamy at first settling down a bit after some time in the glass. Very drinkable with no trace of the abv really. Maybe a bit of warming in the finish but that's about it folks. A top drawer RIS."
"Disappointing. Very over-hyped. What I would expect from a mediocre corner brewpub's RIS."
"A completely different beer from the previous year. Smells smooth and smoky. A bit of cocoa, some oat, a touch of raisin. Flavor is identical. Smoky pork, raisin, peat, cocoa nibs, a little oat. I get the feeling this is how Sexual Chocolate is supposed to taste. The downside is that this is the first good version I’ve tasted after three attempts."
"Bottle & Draft. Attended the release on this one. Great times. Poured a deep chocolate brown almost black with a nice head. The aroma of chocolate is clearly evident along with roast, coffee, and a slight touch of vanilla. At the release they had the 09 and 10 version on tap. The 09 was much smoother than the 10. But for this I will rate the 10 version. The initial taste is smooth and chocolatey with hints of roast. If you like chocolate and Imp Stouts, then this here is a winner. I will say the mouthfeel can be a tad light."
"Great beer, very memorable beer."
"Overall as excited as I was to try this beer, I will say I was let down. Sadly I'm afraid to say there is way better stouts that are easily more available to get."
"Drinkability: I have another bottle, I think this one might have been infected, if that one is better I'd seek out again, if not I wouldn't, hence the average rating."
"Decent enough, but the hype surrounding this had my expectations set pretty high. I would like to try this again..."
"Poured a deep mahogany brown/black, with a thin'ish tan head, little visible carbonation, and decent lacing. Smelled of cocoa powder (Bosco'ish), dark chocolate, and very subtle coffee. Very one dimensional. The taste also was one-dimensionally chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate, with very little in the way of coffee, anise, woodiness, etc. The finish was sweet as well. The most surprising thing was the body, which was thinner than expected, though very smooth. My gut reaction was that this beer would benefit greatly from a little more flavor and texture balance. I know that this is a popular brew, and a lot of people might think that I'm smoking crack as they read this, but maybe I had my hopes too high, as I was genuinely disappointed. I'd be willing to give it another shot though."
"D - ISO clean Sexual Chocolate, so I can re-tick."
"There's no doubt this is a good example of the style, but its difficult for me to discern what makes this so special to so many BAs. The limited availability may be a factor, but to me this is just another entry in a pack of decent imperials that I've enjoyed but didn't adore."
"D: An enticing sipper."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, while carbonation is on the lower side. Great mouthfeel and just how I like my imperial stouts. Drinkability is good, I really liked the dark, bitter, chocolate flavors as well as the burnt, smokiness it had. Would have paired great with the ice cream I just had. Excellent beer overall."
"An easy drinker. Really reminds me of speedway stout w/o the coffee. 4"
"D - Extremely. I'd hit this up all day. 4.5"
"One of the best, you know that. I am just lucky in the fact that I get to try it often and never seem to be able to get enough."
"Overall it needs more sweetness. The name is kind of misleading. It's good but not what expected."
"This is a rare ale that does not measure up to the hype it has. You have to keep in mind there are only 500-600 bottles a year so it can build up a hype about it with that few bottles. We had bottle 5 of 600. Very dissappointed with this ale! We had it at a blind stout tasting and most of us gave it very low grades then. Now with 4 of us sharing a bomber, we are still highly dissappointed with this stout. Perhaps we had two bad bottles between two years, but I doubt it! This is far from the definition of Imperial Stout!"
"Hmm, flavor is not at all what I was hoping for or expected. Don't get me wrong, the beer is not bad...just a tad over-rated in my opinion. Mouthfeel starts off smooth and creamy, medium carbonation...coffee hits right away, but then dissipates just as quick, leaving way to a semi-sour chocolate. The fruits towards the finish resemble sour cherries...again, not what I expected. I was expecting some hops, but not hoppy at all, just slightly sour towards the finish, and dries up relatively quick. Overall, not a bad beer at all, I just think the hype doesn't deserve the results. Glad I got to try!"
"Well, I wasn't sure at first, but as this one warms, it opens like the roses after a steady rain. Black roses, of course. I'm already looking forward to the 2008 bottle that's been resting for a long time in the cellar. Maybe next year..."
"D: A pretty easy to drink beer for a Russian Imperial Stout. Quite minimal alcohol presence, and easy to drink."
"Pours completely black, with modest white head. Thanks Mikesgroove. Pleasant aroma, was expecting extreme chocolate and happy that was not the case. Also happy not coffee overdone. Well integrated RIS, bittersweet chocolate. Above average mouthfeel. Good drinkability."
"Overall, this beer was not good and is primarily hype driven in my opinion. The three of us who split this bottle all got vinegar/acetic acid in the aroma and sesame seed oil in the taste. I'm really hoping this was just a bad bottle because it was really bad."
"D= Thanks to Thomashardy for this one in a trade. This was one of those beers I never thought I would get to try. Unfortunatly it is sort of a let down. A good RIS but not the best I've ever had by far."
"F: Slight sticky syrupy finish, still semi sweet with lots of roasted malt bitterness and lingering minerality. Some roasted malt flavor lingering with a touch of chocolate and some caramel. Overall nothing like I expected. A lot more malt and roasted malt especially forward and much less chocolate than I was expecting. Still a great beer, not too sweet, good roast, hides the booze well, but did have a little heavy on bitterness from the charred malts and somewhat of a misnomer name. Can't wait to try this aged a couple years."
"Nice beer, nothing earth shattering but a solid, albeit, somewhat standard Imperial Stout..."
"I made a point of drinking this fresh to fully experience the chocolate character, but if you're expecting ST Choklat (which I dislike) you will be a bit disappointed. Nate mentioned that some think this is better on draft - I can see that being the case if it improves the feel."
"29 Jan 2011: Made it to the release! Good times."
"Pours a deep, opaque black, with a pretty decent amount of light to medium brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, dark chocolate and mocha/espresso. Nice flavors of cocoa powder, espresso, roasted malts, and a little bit of sweetness. The body here is a little bit thin, but overall a pretty nice example of the style."
"D- This was a very drinkable stout that was bordering on the Milk Stout style. I would like to try this beer again with a little bit of age on it to see if the chocolate mellows on it. Overall it was drinking rather nice right now. I would have no problem drinking a lot of this."
"D-this is a very tasty RIS, nice chocolate presence but a good bit of roasted malts to keep it stout like. Nice complexity and big flavors that are done well!"
"I would love to get my hands on another bottle of this stuff. Hopefully they continue to produce more and more. This beer was better in bed than my girlfriend."
"4.5 D: I've had a few better, but this is still up near the top. Complex with a pleasant taste, this goes down perhaps a little too easy. Would love to have this again."
"This is by far one of my favorite beers."
"D- This is a very interesting, different, and well put together stout. The ABV is undetectable as there is a lot going on with the chocolate and roasted malt. Really enjoyed the slight hoppiness as well. A good high quality stout overall- but doesn't quite live up to the hype."
"Mouthfeel was damn good. I thought this brew was solid, but a tad bit overrated. If you're going to name your beer sexual chocolate, this thing better be like Hershey's. I prefer Southern Tier Choklat over this version of the chocolate imperial stout."
"Overall, good brew, but a touch overrated IMO. I was slightly disappointed by this brew as I expected it to be more viscose and to have a dark fruit characteristic that never joined the party. However, would definately drink it again."
"M: Mouthfeel is dark chocolate, smooth, and dark fried fruits. Very good."
"D: The girlfriend and I polished off a bomber quite easily. This beer goes down nicely and is tolerable. I didn't love it enough to seek it out again, though. Certainly not worth the prestige and hype it has on here."
"Quality brew but not a favorite of mine in the category. I typically do not enjoy aged styles, but the '08 was probably the best as a sipper. The '10 was a bit smoother, but not as flavorful as the '08."
"Drinkability is terrific, with only the mouthfeel keeping it from hitting a five. My brother in law said he'd be willing to sit in the line next year to get me a bottle from the annual release, since he works a few blocks away, so I will definitely take him up on that!!"
"d - Overall I thought this was a great beer. I've had 09 and 10 SC and think the 09 is much better. I think the time on it lets the hops fade and lets the chocolate and some other flavors like the dark fruit come out more. For 9.75% ABV this is very drinkable and I can't wait to try my bottles of 2010 SC with some time on them."
"The pour is quite gorgeous, black with a dark brown head with great retention and lacing. I found the nose excellent. While there was a definite faded hop character with a mildly oxidized character, the blend between dark chocolate, roast, cocoa and a toasted bread sweetness was very very good. The palate opens with a blend of chocolate flavor and a surprising, mild lactic tartness. Flavors of dark chocolate, toasted bread, a moderate caramel sweetness all appear on the palate. Some dark fruit character is noticeable as well, with some plum character. Mildly bitter on the finish with a great dark chocolate bitterness, this beer tastes great. The mouthfeel is borderline exceptional. Medium to full in body with a soft, lush carbonation, this feels exceptional smooth on the palate, a lushness which works beautifully with the delicate chocolate character and the bitterness. This really is a top notch stout, I'd have drunk more but for the $10 pours. Much better than out of a bottle."
"edit: Reading other reviews from the same night it's like we had two different beers. I wonder if I had a dirty glass or...I don't know, something seems off. Wouldn't be first time that's happened to me there."
"Overall, it's good but I am not exactly jumping for joy in consuming more. Perhaps if I had it on its own instead of subsequent to three strong ales I would enjoy it more."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but I think it is a little hyped up. Maybe it would be better with some time on it, but fresh it is nothing stunning. Still, I am really glad I got to try this one."
"Drinkability - A sipper and something to share. I enjoyed this offering."
"D: This is a good, perhaps even very good beer... the problem is the competition up at the top of RIS style is spectacular these days ... probably won't go through the effort of tracking this down in subsequent years"
"Overall, I was really disappointed here. The chocolate is super light in the aroma and it disappears mostly in the taste. If I didn't know better I would think this was a coffee stout. The taste is a big one noter and boring. This has to be a top 100 because of the name and bottle, about the only cool thing here."
"D - I really love this beer. The chocolate flavor is very pronounced, you can't taste the booze and it is easy to drink for such a bit stout. Easily the best dark beer I've ever had."
"Overall, definitely a good RIS, but I just don't think it lives up to the hype. Granted, this is a fresh bottle and I can see this getting better with age, but it's not like it was too hot or anything so how much better is it really going to get? I've been told previous years were fantastic. Anyways, I think the four of us were split down the middle, two liked this better and two liked Olde Rabbit's Foot better. For the record, I liked Olde Rabbit's Foot better."
"Aroma is sweet with some chocolate in there. Beer is medium in body and has some roast character at the back. There is a bitterness from the chocolate I assume, really creamy and consistent palate presence. Really smooth, finishes cleanly. Very awesome."
"Thanks again to these two great BA's for showing me some Sex Choc goodness. Would I search this one out and trade my best beer for it? Probably not, but I still enjoyed the experience very much. I just prefer a couple of other stouts much more. Still, very happy to have had the opp to try this one, never thought I would get that chance."
"Like other Russian Imperial Stout this look very black. No chocolate smell. Just alcohol. But taste very much chocolate and alcohol not so much. Almost as good Brooklyn. This one I feel not drunk from. I love to drink this more."
"This is a very good stout, but it didn't quite live up the the hype or the name. There were chocolate flavors but not near what I expected. A very good stout but not one of the best I ever had, sorry to say. Still, I'm damn pleased (thanks again cashew70) to be able to try it. Thanks!"
"D = Very, very easy to drink and down-right dangerous. Alcohol hidden well. Overall it's a damn nice RIS. It's no Kate the Great, but nice. Damn nice."
"I oured from bottle 834 of the 2010 release courtesy of my sister in law. It pours jet black with a thin tan head. The cocoa is present in the aroma, along with hints of coffee. Chocolate and coffee in very good balance dominate the flavor. Toffee and dark fruit are also present. The beer finishes with lingering dark chocolate. The beer is well carbonated and medium in body. It also has a very creamy mouthfeel. A very good RIS that meets the hype."
"Drinks great! With time the bombers will be beautiful and the kegs are always beautiful!"
"Body was maybe a little thinner than I'd like. Really easy drinker compared to most of the heavy-hitting imperial stouts."
"Overall a great RIS. Worthy of it's spot in the top 100. A million thanks to Andy for sharing this with me."
"D - A good Russian imperial stout with a very easy drinkability for both how rich it is an how smooth/thick it is. No alcohol flavor hits at all."
"J"
"Good beer overall, and I would definitely drink this again."
"Overall: Excellent representation of the style. This is one to seek out. One of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had the privilege of drinking."
"2010 bottle thanks to Mike. Thanks Mike! 09 and 10 bottles. Pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. The 09 had more toffee caramel and butterscotch notes. The 10 had more malt roastiness and hops. Heavy mouthfeel. Flavors followed the nose with both bottles. There were complex layers of roast, chocolate, caramel, and molasses. The toffee caramel flavors were more pronounced in the 1 year aged bottle. That's why I preferred the aged bottle more. Both excellent beers. It reminded me a lot of Cigar City Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout. Great beer."
"Great, great sipper. I like this much better on draft than out of the bottle."
"Wow... had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom. Poured an opaque black with a dark tan / light brown head - not much lacing to be had, although there was decent head retention. Smell was dominated by chocolate, primarily cocoa powder and straight up milk and dark deliciousness. Taste was also heavy on the chocolate - whoa... brownie batter in liquid form! A touch of sweetness (a la molasses) on the finish. Not much of a hop bite or any indication of 10% (??!!) abv. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, and the finish is ridiculously smooth and unparalleled amongst RIS's. Drinkability is hella up there! Great stuff - lives up to the hype!"
"Overall I must say that is an exceptional Imperial Stout from Foothills and one that is deserving of its great praise. This was tasted at my first ever beer release and it did not disappoint. Great brewery, run by great people and producing some great beer! My Highest Recommendation."
"Overall, this is a very fine beer and one that I would most definitely seek out again. Thanks to Rob and Jim for giving me the chance."
"D- it's a shame this stuff is so hard to obtain because I could drink this stuff all the time. maybe not everyday at the $15/bottle but if available I would always have a stock of bottles."
"It poured a deep and opaque black color with a dark brown head. There was a big chocolate aroma with notes of espresso, more chocolate and a subtle following of molasses, dark sweet toffee and dark fruit. Smooth dark chocolate backbone, both bittersweet and malt, with complex notes of coffee, dark toffee and dark fruit. Each sip leaves you craving another. This Imperial stout weighs in around 10% ABV and is worth every bit of hype it gets!"
"I have to thank my friend Paul for sharing a bottle of this with me. While the legend is greater than the beer itself, this was still a top-notch RIS. The cocoa nibs impart a deep, dark chocolate flavor that's also earthy like a cocoa bean. The malts provide an array of chocolate cookie, graham cracker, toffee, bread crust, and plum notes. The body is thick like most, but there's enough bitterness to keep this from getting too sweet. The hops also add a pleasant, mild citrus taste, which aid drinkability, though this is a tough beer to do anything with but slowly sip... but I suppose that's ok."
"Black pour with a nice dense brown head and moderate lacing. Mouth watering dark chocolate aroma with a bitter roasted malt and a fair bit of alcohol and some molasses. Yummy bittersweet choclate flavor balanced by lots of roasted malt, a touch of pine and a little burnt brown sugar. There's a healthy dose of alcohol in there too. Very full and creamy body with a nice little warming at the end from the alcohol. This is for sure a top notch Imperial Stout."
"Notes for the 09 edition, just differences - the main difference was in the actual balance. Tons more chocolate and sweetness in this than the 10. The 10 had a great balance of roast, coffee, and chocolate, while the 09 definitely tilted a bit far to the chocolate side. This showed up in smell and taste, and the sweetness lowered drinkability some. Otherwise it was still quite good and I'd gladly drink this at home had I made it to the release, but on tap is fine with me."
"Poured into a DFH snifter and it has the typical dark opaque appearance of the RIS style. Very little head or lacing, although it does leave a light brown colored ring around the edge of the glass. Aroma is of dark chocolate, espresso, and dark fruit (raisins?). Taste closely follows aroma with the dark fruit and heavy chocolate being the most prominent on the palate. Minimal carbonation with a thin, creamy mouthfeel and goes down exceptionally smooth. For a 10% abv brew, this is one highly drinkable RIS....and it gets so much better as it warms up. An excellent job by Foothills....it may be a tad over-hyped, but it is still one of the better RISes that I've tried."
"I have to say it was not as much chocolate as I was expecting. Still worth a stop by to try it out."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this beer, but also glad I wasn't able to make it to the release party where I would have spent $50 acquiring the maximum number of bottles. I have had better representations of the style, but enjoyed it nonetheless. I don't want to seem like I am being critical of Foothills, because I enjoyed the beer and the meal I had with it. I think I just expected too much."
"The '08 - The nice soft roasted characteristics have given way to semi-astringent char. The alcohol is more noticable, especially in the nose. Vinous and sherry like characteristics have developed from mild oxidation. Munich maltiness is not as noticable. Definitely not liking this as much."
"Overall, this is a very nice imperial stout and easily the best chocolate stout I've had to date (though I admit I haven't had a whole lot of them). It is a really well constructed brew and a pleasure to drink. If you live fairly close to Winston-Salem, it is definitely worth dropping by Foothills for a good meal and a very good beer."
"Poured a very dark black; nice head and appeared to be pretty thick. The smell was full of dark malt, chocolate, some molasses, and bits of coffee. Similar taste but with more deep dark chocolate and nice roastiness. The mouthfeel is a tad bit thin for the style; no noticeable alcoholic warmth (at least in the 2009 version). Highly drinkable and something I was very glad I sought out."
"Overall, a very nice, refined RIS that carries a lot of dark chocolate character. I would definitely go out of my way to have this again."
"D-a little to easy to drink it'll catch up with you quick"
"D: In my opinion, this is one of the top over-hyped beers. Sure, its pretty good, but nothing outstanding and definitely not worth the hype. Seek it out if you live near the brewery but honestly, there are a bunch of year-round RISs that I'd much rather have. Not bad by any means, but a let down because of the publicity."
"The '09 version (perhaps more accurately characterized as the year-aged version), also on tap, I think I would have rated much lower. It gains a little bit of smoothness, and the carbonation has largely subsided--no huge, crisp, spicy bubbles here, and there's a slight hint of bitterness. I think this one loses more than it gains with age, oddly, and personally prefer it fresh."
"D: Surprisingly excellent. We were floored that the abv didn't stand in the way of us enjoying this, at all. Stunning!"
"D: High in general and very high for the style. Now I gotta get a bottle (hopefully 2) to try!"
"I finally decided to crack open my 2009 vintage of this bad boy. First, let me start by saying this is one of my favorite names for a beer and also one of my favorite labels. It pours jet black with a nice 3 fingers of dark tan head and leave a nice foamy lacing on my Founders 10 Anniversary glass. The smell is a bit off putting because it has a rather large burnt grains smell with lingering hits of chocolate, carmel, booze and earth. The flavor is much better as the burnt grain smell is replaced by the taste of bitter sweet chocolate, sweet grains, toffee, carmel, coffee and earthy flavors....overall the taste of chocolate and roasted grains is most prominent and quit delicious. This beer is thick in my mouth like a bitter chocolate milk shake. I really enjoyed this beer, much more than I thought I would. The chocolate is there, but over powering and all the flavors really meld together nicely. I may seek this one out again, but there are a few other imperial stouts I have higher on my list."
"SEXUAL CHOCOLATE!!!"""
"M/D - smooth creamy, full bodied, warming with some bitterness to it. I really enjoyed trying this and will hopefully get to again someday. I really enjoyed it. Very smooth."
"sexual chocolate. the name and the bottle seem a clever tease. desire, expectation, suspense. then surprise, confusion, an empty glass. wondering why i didnt get what i expected instead of appreciating what i was given. sexual chocolate... you b****. now i cant wait to expect a sour fruitiness on our reacquaintance. all wrapped in a roasty blankey. mmm!"
"The best thing about this sexy black beauty is that she faithfully returns to us year after year, and you can bet your bottom dollar, folks, that I'll be lining up to see her again on SC Day '10. A truly awesome brew."
"drinkability: actually drinks pretty well, less the bitterness in the finish"
"D: From the pretty bottle to the pretty warm stomach a very enjoyable beer from start to finish. A great lasting wave of chocolate after every big sip and well hidden ABV. Hopefully I can snag another one of these in 2010. Curious how a fresh bottle would taste."
"My first ever growler, and what a pleasure it was! Deep black colour that reminds me of midnight mixed with space. It has a nice looking head that hangs around and a wonderful lace. Smells strongly of chocolate (obviously) and to lesser extent coffee. A powerful, and pleasant aroma that makes my mouth watcher for the first taste. The taste is everything I expected, a sweet chocolate with some coffee aftertaste as well, but the sweetness makes this a truly memorable experience. This also may be the best feeling beer I've ever had, in addition to the taste which also certainly up there as well. I still have a hard time believing that this is a 10% RIS, because our friends at Bud Light could use some education as to what true ""drinkability"" is. This may very well be one of the best beers i've ever had, and I'm already sad that my growler is gone and i'll have to wait to get another"
"Just got back from piggly-wiggly where they had a foothills tasting on friday thanks Michael for saving me a growler, you are the Man. Appearance: Dark black w/ a nice tan head this stuff pour awesome out of growler even though 2 days old. Smell: Great chocolatey goodness, can't wait til I can taste it. Taste : Have I gone to heaven, this stuff taste great! Mouthfeel: Wonderful not to thick(if that is possible)but definitely stout not a disguised porter. Drinkability: I can't really taste the alcohol very well hidden, it's only 6:00 pm and I've got a half gallon of this wonderful beverage to drink before I go to sleep, don't be jealous, it's going to be a great night."
"D: Drinks pretty easy for a bigger beer. This was about a year old when I had it and I really enjoyed it. I've had it fresh(from the '09 batch) a few different times and really think it needs to age out for at least a year."
"Pours a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice small islands and thich creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty with lots of chocolate/toffee, slight roast note. The taste is awesome, malty, sweet, with some dark fruits, some vanilla, slight roast note. Medium/Full body, smooth. Very drinkable, what an awesome brew, so glad I finally got a chance to try it, Thanks Chuck!"
"D - High for the style. Does not get to be too much like some impy stouts do."
"Taste is groovy. It's a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, dark plum, light tobacco and smoke. A bit chewy. Better as it warms, more roasted malt comes out. Dark chocolate, not sweet. Doesn't have quite the bite as some RIS, kinda wish it did...but this is very nice."
"Drinkability: Tastes great, little to no alcohol presence, but thicker mouthfeel and high abv."
"Thanks Dyan!"
"D: Very little separates this from other imperial stouts, kind of disappointing. It's good but not great. I wouldn't trade life and limb for another."
"Overall: Expected more...a little disappointed, but still very good. I hate to say it...a ""hyped up beer"". Cheers!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great. Once it warms, I could drink this all night. Overall, one of the best RIS's I have had to date. So nice on all levels, so comlex and choclatey. Great offering from the guys at Foothills. Skal."
"RBSG09 Grand Tasting notes (thanks to whoever brought it). As much as this was a good beer, it still disappointed me. I hadn't read reviews or heard much about it beyond general hype for a good American impy stout. This is a pure chocolate bomb, in my humble opinion. While it does a great job with creating a good chocolate flavor, I didn't find the complexity that I need to nudge my scores above a four. Well, the aroma is very good, still chocolate but so intense it broke through. This beer tastes like rich, high quality semi-sweet to milk chocolate, and there's not a ton else to say. It's the best chocolate flavor you can find in a stout, but as someone who likes good dark chocolate, a chocolatey stout will never live up to the real stuff, which is a good thing because I wouldn't want to drink anything with the bitterness and intensity of good dark chocolate. I should go back and downgrade all of the other chocolate beers that I've reviewed because this is better, however it's still a one note stout in a field of deep, dark, gigantically complex entries. On a fresh palate, alone in my room with a growler, I'd probably give this beer a higher score, but the RBSG09 Grand Tasting gave me quite a bit of perspective on reviewing and showed me that I need to leave more room in my scores. I had a Cigar City 110K+ about fifteen minutes before this beer, and while that wasn't the best stout ever in all the world, it was still significantly more interesting to me."
"Bottle at the RBSG grand tasting. Black with a tan head. Licorice and dark chocolate aroma. Thick, rich dark chocolate flavor. This just oozed thick chocolately goodness. Full bodied and smooth. Pretty drinkable for a big chocolate stout, but definitely not something you could put back too much of. Nice. I'm a sucker for chocolate beers, and this delivered."
"A great Russian Imperial. Not too much on the nose, but my worries were quickly banished after the first sip. Dark chocolate and coffee swarmed beautifully into my mouth. The mouthfeel is spectacular and oily enough to really make the impression last. The taste just lingers forever after the experience."
"Pours the anticipated black and oily, under a dark tan head, leaving plenty of dark tan lace. Rich, bold and tasty stout. I get notes of coconuts, bourbon, rich chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, dark malts via the nose and tongue. Over the top bitter/sweet, complex and full of RIS goodness. Seek out and enjoy"
"Bottle, 2009. Pours black with a thick tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, sweet malt, bitter chocolate. Flavor is sweet and malty upfront with a cocoa finish. A bit on the sweet side. Meh, this was a good impy but it certainly wasn't a great one for me."
"Perhaps it's still too hot as there is some in-your-face booziness present. I'm more than humbled for the opportunity, but maybe sitting on this for a year is the right call?"
"This is one of, if not the best Chocolate Imperial Stout I've had. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, giving it remarkable drinkability for an imposing style."
"D - Goes down easy and smooth."
"A slow sipper. One that might accompany a sweet dark chocolate dessert well. Would actually cut the sweetness a bit."
"Drinkability is just wonderful man does this go down smooth and easy two pints gone in no time potentially could be dangerous. Man i wish i wasn't driving could stand to have a few more of these. A must try if you can find it get it, best chocolate stout I have had."
"This one has earned its standing among the elite American megastouts. Meaty, beaty, big & bouncy doesn't cover it. No body fat on this one. Packs a punch in deep, dark roasted malt but a little slate and patent tannin works with the aggressive hops to balance down the residual sweetness while not rendering it comatose. There's accessible complexity here with a lightness, not a clamminess...to make it extremely drinkable. Thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Beer #7 in the ""Motha of all Stout Tastings"" courtesy of Thirstybird. Bottle #133 of 600. Poured one shade shy of black with no head; just a skim. Nose is mild - malt, licorice and perhaps some dark fruit. Taste consists of malt, char and ash (very ashy/earthy). Also a little spicy/peppery - not your typical RIS. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and carbonation is a bit prickly with a lingering bitterness at the finish. Drinkability is decent, but all and all, I was a little disappointed with this brew."
"Overall, a good RIS, but nothing special. Lack of body totally affected the taste and mouthfeel. I feel like if this beer was more medium to heavy bodied it would be a completely different experience."
"Nice to drink but there are many stouts that aren't rated as high that are much better."
"D: The alcohol can be felt fairly soon on this one, but the spiciness of it is an afterthought. Quite well hidden and, in this case, that's a positive point, I'd say. This is a nice beer... at time of review, it's being enjoyed as a bit of a celebratory brew and that's a good purpose for it. It would also be a stellar dessert brew for something like Valentines Day with a special someone. Something about it has me almost craving chocolate chip cookies to pair with it. Nice stuff, and well worth checking out if the opportunity is there."
"Thanks to Deuane for sharing a bottle of this at his recent tasting party. This bottle is from the first bottle release in 2008 and numbered 410/500. I have had a few samples of this beer here and there at beer festivals, but I'm glad I finally have enough in my glass to finally jot down some of my thoughts about it. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into my glass on 3/21/09. Appears a deep, dark brownish black color with a solid two fingers of tight ecru head. The head lingers in my glass for a few moments before retreating to a thin layer. Smells of rich roasted chocolate malts, caramelized malts, semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate and molasses. Tastes of cocoa powder, milk chocolate, sweet caramel, molasses, and mocha. Notes of dark fruits such as cherries and raisins are starting to develop and I find this to be a great characteristic in an RIS with some time in the bottle. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. This is a satisfying and tasty RIS. Not the best one out there, but really nice nonetheless. Check it out if you can."
"D - Very good RIS that I was finally glad to have had the opportunity to review. Is it worth all of the hype? Maybe. But it's not the best stout I've ever had. With that said, Sexual Chocolate is pretty damn good, though!"
"Notes: Overall I was very impressed with this beer, and my only complaint is that I didn't get a chance to buy any bottles during this year's release. I love stouts, and there are lots of good ones out there, but Foothills Sexual Chocolate is definitely one of the best. It looks beautiful and smells incredible, but the taste and the mouthfeel are what really set it apart from its peers. If you ever get the chance to sample this beer, don't pass it up; you'll be disappointed if you do."
"D: A really drinkable RIS. Glad I got to try this but I don't know if I would give up the farm for this. However if this were local to me I would grab every chance I could to have this. Great beer."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and heavy bodied with a small amount of carbonation."
"Quick note, I have lowered my score a bit as 09/10 both had a strong char/burt character too them, a bit acridic, and I did not enjoy them nearly as much."
"Obsidian black body, with a lasting head of sticky foam. Spotty lace deposited around the edges. Notes of fruity plum and lactic milk chocolate notes. Flavors of rich chocolate and hints of coffee, with a flaky pastry middle, and a very smooth lactic feel. Some mild roastiness that lingers long in the dry aftertaste. Well crafted, with each sip I wanted more. A fine RIS, maybe not the best i've tried, but truly solid..."
"This one goes down extremely easy but considering the difficulty in obtaining one, let's just say I am glass to have tried it once."
"Overall, this is a great RIS. I wish it was more readily available, because this was so drinkable and I could have one every night."
"Poured from 2008 bottle #20 / 500. Thanks to Atlbeerdog for this treat! Poured into a tulip. Pours a jet black- I meannothing getting through this puppy even when held up to the light. Great dark tan, creamy head. Smells faintly of some coffee, some burnt malts, and dark fruit. This does not have a ""strong"" aroma, though. I really have to try to get some smells. Taste is of bitter coffee, bitter dark chocolate, espresso, some raisin and a bit of a hop bite at the end. This is quite a bit more bitter than I was looking for. Could be the espresso. Not the creamiest IS I have had either. Overall, a good Coffee/Chocolate stout."
"Notes - Appeals to my sweet tooth, as good as advertised. Blaxploitation just popped me in the mouth."
"Pours a pitch black color. Even the little stream from the mouth of the growler is pitch black, maybe with a bit of brown highlights. The head is thick and brown and it rises up and stays around. There isn't much lacing, but that's about the only thing that's missing. The smell seemed immediately to be full of carbonation, it smelled kind of dry which surprised me. There is a decent bit of roasted and sweet notes, but the smell doesn't keep you all too interested. The taste is definitely full of roasted barley, which is very nice (better than a bunch of black patent). The chocolate nibs fills this one out, you get the taste of chocolate, but not a lot of sweetness, and it fills the whole thing up. It has a bit of lingering sweetness mixed in with some roasted coffee bitterness. Very pleasant, but just a bit more chocolatey sweetness, like chocolate malt or dark crystal, would really put this out into outer space, but at this point its a bit dry. The taste is really just like a bar of bitter black chocolate. Like I mentioned, this is very full, really wonderful, like thick, viscous syrup. I love the feeling, until the dryness hits. I mean, for a style like an RIS, dryness just isn't nice. I really couldn't pull myself away from this. There's room for improvement, but I really enjoyed working through this growler, and would do it again in a heartbeat. $20 for 4 pints, I think that's better than everyone who waited in line paid."
"Drinkability is all there. This bar has so much on tap that I had to try other things, otherwise, I would have kept drinking this one. Wish it was more readily available. Good RIS. Not sure what all the hype is about. Goddamn beer trekkies!!"
"This is a great stout, great chocolate flavor with enough sweetness in it to keep it interesting. I am truly enjoying this bomber while sipping this last glass. A must try to any stout lover; I know I grab another one in the future."
"This is a standout beer."
"Tastes wonderfully chocolatey. I had heard that this years version was lacking in the cocoa dept., but not in my experience. Definitive chocolate presence, followed by a crisp hop bite, but not overly so. Warm bready taste in there as well. This is very well-done. I actually had my expectations lowered due to some hear-say, but I think this beer is wonderful. I can't wait to let some of my bottles age and give them a try in a year or so."
"Receive bottle via trade (52/600) cap was leaking when I got it so I had to open it qucik :( Aroma is chocolate, coffee, and sticky molasses. Such a great aroma that fills the air when poured. Flavor is exceptional. Balanced, not too much chocolate. Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and some alcohol but in a complementary fashion not overpowering. Smooth, creamy and rich mouthfeel with light carbonation. Great for an impy. It's sad that I'm going to lose this fine brew through the process of digestion."
"The drinkability of the beer is off the charts considering the amount of flavor profile and abv. I would recommend this beer to ANYONE regardless of their preferences. It's sexual chocolate baby...how could you go wrong!?"
"overall a good ris...is it the best ive ever had? no but it was worth the drive to try....the only the odd thing to me is that my experience with ris is that the more they warm the more flavors come out i actuall prefer 90% of my ris at room temp...but this seemed to lose a little flavor the more it warmed which threw me off slightly but congrats to foothills for another great brew..."
"Worth three hours of standing in line? I had a great time hanging out with the other beer nerds. Everyone brought their favorite beers and were open to sharing. Like I said....I'll be back."
"Edit: Drank this right after a Ballast Point Sea Monster Stout which may account for my perceived lacking of SC. In any event, it did not hold up well against another big stout."
"A very hyped beer that you can brag if you have. All in all a good RIS. Worthy of craze? No.Worthy of praise? Yes."
"D. For a big beer, this is way too drinkable. I could hurt myself on this one. Believe the hype, people."
"Highly drinkable and highly recommended. Smooth as silk."
"Extremely high drinkability. It is by no means a filling beer. I could easily drink bombers by the pair, unfortunately I was 7 people late this year. So I guess I have to settle for the few on tap."
"I was thrilled to try the 2008 on tap at the 2009 bottle release. After standing in line for hours, I can safely say it was well worth it. Poured into a snifter, it is a deep, dark ink black color and a fairly thin dark brown head. It sure looks incredible, and smell doesn't let down either, the intense chocolate, burnt coffee, and strong malts combine to make quite the enticing aroma. This 2008 vintage blows you away in the taste department. It seems the alcohol has muted enough to allow all the other flavor components, the chocolate, the coffee, the malts, to overtake the flavor. It is a dense beer, but far thinner than the 2009 release, I assume due to aging. The subdued carbonization is also nice. All combine to make strong RIS, in both flavor and ABV, that still tastes, and drinks easy. I am thoroughly impressed, and may now have to hold off those '09 bottles for a while."
"Very drinkable at almost 10 percent I can detect very little alcohol at all. This stuff is going down way to easy. Better be careful there won't be anymore till next year."
"If it were readily available, this would stand comfortably as a special occasion sipper, but with the limited release (600 bottles this year) it's really a once a year type thing... And I can't wait for a special occasion, so happy saturday to me."
"NOTE: Foothills also had some of the '08 vintage on tap, and I was fortunate enough to sample that next to the '09. It was much mellower, and the chocolate notes were not nearly as present. It's a much different experience, and personally, I think I like this beer better fresh."
"Drinkability: For an RIS? A definite 4.5. The 10.0% is nowhere to be found; the flavors aren't too intense, too over the top; it's not too thick, too sweet, too creamy, too heavy. It's just a nice, flavorful, smooth, well-carbonated RIS. I easily downed two glasses of this one, and could have gone for several more. If you're in the area, get this one on tap while you can. And if you can trade for a bottle, do it. I'd love to see what this one does with a little bit of age on it, see if the bitterness fades a little - I'll be picking up plenty of bottles to test out that theory."
"Here's hoping that Foothills Brewing has more than 500 bottles in the pipeline for this year's release. It would be great if every RIS loving BA could see what all the fuss is about. There's no question that Sexual Chocolate is one of the great ones."
"The beer is dark black with a nice initial 2-finger foam. The smell was not as chocolaty as I expected from the name, but was really rich with malts and dark fruits (like I said, similar to Dark Lord). The taste was really good too, lots of roasted malt, rich with sweetness and a little chocolate, very flavorful. The body was just thick enough in my opinion, even as it seemed less substantial than Dark Lord. Drinkability couldn't be improved for such a large and flavorful stout. It really goes down easily."
"Pretty good beer but it didn't live up to the hype IMO."
"Poured black with red hues around the edges. Head was a dark beige color, but didn't last too long. Chocolate-y aroma, some ash and strong roast, perhaps some lactose, and some alcohol came out as it warmed. Taste started out with the strong dark roast, similar to The Abyss, but where the Abyss powers on with ash, this transforms elegantly into dark chocolate and sweet lactose flavors. Smooth is a good word to describe it. Carbonation was on the lower side and body was medium bodied. If I can be picky, I'd give the taste a little above an 8, but not quite a 9, so I'll add in an extra point to the overall. Big thanks to Cole and his roommate for the sample!"
"Poured a dark black color with brown at the edges and a smaller sized light brown head. Aromas of roast, chocolate-cocoa, caramel, and molasses. Tastes of cocoa, caramel, dark fruits, and a lighter roastiness."
"Chocolate here is much more noticeable than on the aroma, along with some roasted malts, rarely burnt providing mild acidity. There is very little of that burnt, acrid, acid taste described by others, presumably because I am drinking this quite warm, which appears to be the way to go. Mostly sweet, with some balancing roasted bitterness, but not near 85 IBUs as the bottle states. Compared to the ridiculously bitter 88 IBU rogue RIS that I recently had, this is quite sweet (more balanced, really) - and significantly better."
"I am thoroughly impressed with this beer and would rate it among my favorite imperial stouts. I may be slightly biased to the sweeter side of things, but either way this is a world class beer. Thanks again to kp for sharing this one."
"Poured an opaque black color with a small, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, some smoke, chocolate, dried fruits, caramel, and a hint of spice. Taste of roast, charred malts, some caramel, dark chocolate, molasses, with dark fruits, and pronounced alcohol in the finish."
"Thanks a ton Mikesgrove!"
"Oh my, this is some tasty stuff. Pours a near black color with a creamy brown head. Huge nose of chocolate, coffee and sweet fruity malts. Taste follows suit. Lots of chocolate over a very nice stout. Chocolate is well balanced. Creamy body goes down well. Delicious. Anyone want to trade for a bottle of this?"
"Overall a very nice and well crafted imperial stout from Foothills. Good to see more good beer coming out of the south. Second time ive tried this one and it certainly made a bigger impression this time than last. Nothing too tricky about this one, it is just a solid representation of the style, with no adjunct madness or gimmicky feel. Just a good solid well made imperial stout. Gotta appreciate that. Good beer. Probably wont change your life, but defenitely worth trying to find a bottle or two. Great."
"Opaque, very appropriate black color. Like ""Dark Lord Light," this ale is very heavily sweet with flavors of cherries, dark fruits and chocolate cake. Excellent flavor and aroma intensity, with a coating texture as well. Complex, with dessert-like malts. Very long finish on this bad boy. Undeniably one of the stand out beers at GABF 2008."
"+++"
"Pours a thick jet black color with no light passing through and 1 finger of creamy burnt tan head. Nice lasting retention yields good lacing that slides down the glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, smoke, roasted malt, vanilla, walnuts, dark fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Tastes of chocolate syrup right from the start followed by molasses, black coffee, plums and cherries, vanilla, caramel, and roasted malt. Finishes with a bitterness of espresso beans, anise, cocoa powder, and alcohol. Full in body and low in carbonation. Smooth and creamy with a nice bitter bite, but the sweetness outlasts the bitter in the aftertaste department. A good balance between sweet chocolate and bitter coffee. Very easy to drink and quite delicious. Hopefully Foothills will be able to make more of this soon, otherwise I just may have to head down there myself for the next release to stock up."
"D: If it were a little more available, I'd drink it about as much as I drink Old Rasputin. Which is a few times a month. Overall, a good if not overrated RIS."
"Drinkability - excellent. Just like a tasty dessert. No notice of the 10% alcohol"
"4/4.5/4/4/4.5"
"Three fingers of chunky foam carry a beautiful milk chocolate colored head. Slowly fades showing nice retention. Body is thick and black as Hersheys syrup. Nose has lots of zesty roasted malts and some mineral nuttiness with a hint of coco at the end. Initially as you take first sip the chocolate feel is very smooth and almost milky creamy like. The deeply roasted malts really carry this flavor through the palate with grace. The dark chocolate takes over on the back of the tongue with a nice even bitter feel that is very pleasant. The mouthfeel is a attractive roasted bitter feel and slightly thick. A wonderfully drinkable sipper and my new favorite chocolate beer."
"I'm glad to have tried this now on both draft and in the bottle and my opinion hasn't changed. This is still a solid upper tier RIS with an all around solid character and good drinkibility for its size. I was also happy to see that a bit of age had helped smooth out the overall flavors and feel some as well. A very nice brew from the folks at Foothills."
"Sexual Chocolate is a high quality beer from Foothills and I'd love to get my hands on more of their brews. I do enjoy this beer but it seems to get caught in the shuffle with all the other quality RISs out there. It's well made but is missing that something special to set it apart. Thanks again for the sample Brent!"
"Bottle 271/500 - Pours pitch black with a 1/8 inch caramel colored head. Super heavy lacing clings to the glass. Aroma of deep roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. First sip - the coffee really dominates with the chocolate coming through next followed by the rich malts. There are hints of vanilla and licorice. The whole thing really works as all the flavors blend beautifully together. Complex but not as complex nor as thick bodied as Dark Lord. None the less, this is World Class"
"This is one of those beers that really needs to breath and warm up before being consumed. I had almost written this off; some savory food paired with it seems to have helped the flavor nuances a bit as well."
"This was an excellent imperial stout and certainly one of the best I've had. Still, it didn't quite match the complexity of KtG, IMO."
"Notes: A big thanks to Loki for this bottle. Hype and rarity aside, this really is a good beer. Worth seeking out for those that like chocolate stouts."
"Poured dark brown with a decent head. Good retention. Smells primarily of cocoa and some smooth malt. Not dusty smelling as some cocoa smelling beers are and not overly sweet. The taste is also all about the cocoa and a nice backbone of chocolate liqueur. Not overly sweet, but nice deep chocolate flavors without any waxiness and a bit of alcohol comes through as well. Enough malt to keep things firm and together, but there is plenty of pleasant bitterness to stop things from getting too sweet. Somewhat of a one-note beer, but done quite well. I like this a good deal more than the Southern Tier Choklat. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat sharp. It could have used a touch more creaminess. Nice to see a Southern brewer hitting it big. This is nice beer, but I'm not sure there should be a frenzy over it."
"Sexual Chocolate's an excellent beer and certainly deserving of the praise it receives. Hopefully Foothills will be able to produce this and distribute on a larger scale at some point. This is damn fine and should be sampled by all. Highly recommended. Thanks, Dan. This was awesome."
"Thanks to Artusory for the brew!"
"Probably one of the finest RIPs on the market right now. I'm a big fan of Stone's RIP and until I tried Sexual Chocolate, I'd thought it was the only respectable version of this style. This is one hell of a beer. All I can really say is, find it, by it (en masse if possible), covet it, and drink it. An incredible beer ... can't wait till it makes its way to DC!"
"The pour is black with a billowing light brown head with some very nice lace. Aroma? What aroma? I get next to nothing here. Seems to me hops are leading the way in the nose. I bit apple-ish. There's roast and chocolate, but over all the nose is much to weak to earn a high score. The flavor, to me, isn't really anything to brag about either. There's some roast and some chocolate, but there supposed to be. I do pick up a tad of molasses. Really, the flavor is pretty pedestrian. The mouthfeel on the other hand is quite good. Big body. Above average carbonation. Dry finish. Full palate all the way through. OH-VER-RAY-TED!"
"In sum, this is a damn tasty brew, well worth the search. Its not quite top notch, can't hang with the best bunch of this style, but its a very respectful second tier impy stout, which makes it much better than most in my book."
"Drinkability: Very."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty brew. It's not really chocolaty like Southern Tiers Choklat (which I thought it would be closer to then farther from) but still very nice and tasty. It's not overly sweet and cloying like some of these brews can be and I hate. Wish the 10% was covered up a bit more but that's about my only complaint. Big thanks to Shane for the opportunity to try this delight!"
"Pours a very dark brown almost black in color. Decent sized head. Smell is dominant chocolate and some tar. Taste is all cocoa and dark chocolate. There are some dark fruits trying to make a presence, but the chocolate just won't let it happen. Decent beer that I'm glad I got to try. I'm happy I got to try it instead of trying to trade for one on the market."
"This is a great, complex stout that I wish I could get more of. I am glad I had the opportunity to try this from this brewing. There was a lot of hype surrounding this beer, and I think I can honestly say that it has earned at least most of it. Thanks again for the bottle Josh."
"M/D: Silky smooth on the tongue, hardly any alcohol at all, medium carbonation, full bodied. Very good drinkability for such a big beer. Could easily drink a few pints of this."
"Once again, thanks to ahatcher78 for a beer I probably had no chance of trying."
"Non numbered bomber bottle. 22oz of chocolate goodness. This one pours motor oil black with a nice espresso head of cocoa nib foam. Lacing is long lived and provides excellent lacing and legs. Aromas is all bittersweet chocolate, background green hops, and big bread basket malts. Taste is all pure chocolate, cocoa butter, great dark hot chocolate with great roasty, bready malt. Mouthfeel is medium liquid silk smooth and great. Drinkability is very good as well. This one blew the Brooklyn black chocolate out of the water, and would do the same thing to the rogue chocolate as well I imagine. That being said, based on the hype this doesn't quite live up to it. This is a damn good beer but not quite up their with dark lord or kbs. However, it is a different sort of thing and certainly a fantabulous brew from NC"
"A reddish black liquid that pours super black in the glass. Small tan head can form if poured vigorously. I thought I'd be hit with chocolate in the aroma but all that really comes out is a little bit of toffee and maybe a bit of roastiness. It's like there's a ton of dark malt aroma there but they all cancel eachother out into one muted sorta sweetness. The taste is what I would describe basically as a pretty good but not too unique imperial stout. Compared to what I think of as the ultimate chocolate beer (Choklat) it falls way short. Compared to a standard IRS (for example the Port Santa's Little Helper I had just before it) it exceeds it by a small fraction. It holds a little more sweetness than most IRS's, and the chocolate comes across in the bitter variety. Don't get me wrong, it tastes good. It's one of the better tasting IRS's I've had but I was kinda hoping this would go beyond that, sorta like Choklat does."
"Highly recommended."
"I won't get into how much I enjoy the label on the bottle of this beer, mmhmm. So...it pours the color of the black hole with a big three finger brown head that leaves a tick layer of webbing on the sides of the glass. Chunky bubbles remain on the top of the beer throughout. Super dark chocolate with roasted malt and barley in the nose up front. Big smokey wood and cocoa powder aroma with a tiny bit of caramel and molasses. The alcohol sting is first on the tongue with big french roast flavors that follow. Smoked dark chocolate taste with some earthy hops and bourbon towards the end. Aftertaste has dark fruits and is surprisingly dry. Creamy full body with a silky carbonation. Very bold in the mouth. This is a pretty big beer overall and very enjoyable. Not as much chocolate flavor as I expected, but still very good. This bottle will definitely be displayed in my kitchen."
"Pours a rich dark black color, letting no light through the snifter, and holds a nice sized brown head. Good lacing. Smell at first is of dark rich fruit, and then shifts in a dark chocolately, roasty and dry coccoa smell that is really nice. Taste is rich, creamy, smooth mild bittersweet chocolately sweetness. Nice and dark and dry in the finish for a great balance. Never got too chocolately, artificial, or cloying in the least. The drinkability is phenomenal. Medium to light carbonation and a great mouthfeel. The alcohol is flawlessly hidden as well. Easily one of my favorite beers, and exactly what I want in a Chocolate beer. Worlds better than ST Choklat and the Chocolate Donut Beer. Shared with pint_size for Valentine's but easily could've had the entire bomber to myself with no complaints..."
"Pours an opaque black, attractive brown highlights, nice dark tan head, very thick, super retention, drops some nice lacing as it settles down to a thick ring. Smell is some dark fruits and alcohol, chocolate, big roastiness, toffee, intense burnt fruit, more roast, very nice. Taste is tons of chocolate, nice roast, toffee, lots of dark fruit, burnt currants, alcohol, some sherry, bit of pine, molasses, intense finish, flavours aren't as integrated as I expected though, lots of fighting, but lots of intensity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Maybe with some age the flavours will meld together a little bit more. Regardless, thanks Russ for the fantastic beer!!"
"Deep black color with a moderate amount of tan head. Slightly burnt, somewhat port wine and plum aroma. Heavy, though mellow roasted flavor. Lingering bittersweet chocolate taste. Very grainy tasting. Solid mouthfeel-the heavy grain flavor comes thru as a nice chewy, bready feel to it. Very, very good and enjoyable beer. I am a tad dissappointed overall but I think I just hyped myself up for it. Thanks to brentk56 for this great trade. I wouldnt have been able to sample it otherwise I am sure."
"Thanks Roger down Greensboro,bottle # 42/500.Poured into a nonic a jet black I mean as black as crude a large fluffy billowing dark mocha colored head atop that settles very slowly.Not as intense as ST's Choklat in its choclate bombardment in the nose but its there and in force along with raisin and French roast coffee just roasted to the hildt.Me and my wife are splitting a bottle with a piece of Cheescake Factory peanut butter cup-fudge cheescake and it dont get much better as a pair in my mind.Dark bitter chocolate dominates the palate with dark roast coffee accompanying it hand in hand a bit of char into the finish with the alcohol beginning to creep as I drink more.It lives up to the hype its decadent and raw at the same time it kicks as."
"If they put out brews anywhere near this one I will be a very happy man."
"drinkability is excellent. well balanced, hiding its alcohol well. great chocolate profile that is interesting yet still lets the stout come through. great stuff."
"Pours an opaque brown color with a huge foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. The smell from beneath the cap is Hersey Syrup chocolaty goodness, from the pour a wonderful distinct dark fruit character comes through and hints of vanilla. As it warms you get more of a cherry vanilla barrel aged treatment. The initial mouthful is conditioned by the rush of alcohol. The fire is dampened nicely by the full bodied rich chocolate flavor dispensed in a silky creaminess. Big chocolate flavor mixed with the fruity taste of a barrel age treatment. Finishes with a chewy semisweet maltiness that lingers appropriately. Way too easy to drink. This one is labeled 9.75% ABV. Integrated well, has a really nice complexity that's a kick to consider. I never know where the line falls between a RIS and a Double Stout, but this is what i think a Double Stout is shooting for. Really nice effort. Highly recommended."
"This beer is about as dark as a beer could be. Black with a nice thick tan head. The smell is coffee, a little oatmeal and a ton of chocolate. The taste is chocolate. No hop bitterness, just mainly a ton of chocolate and a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just a hint of smoke. Served at room temp. The abv is not too noticable and the beer has a long lasting aftertaste. I will certanly try this beer again sometime."
"Pours black like an overdue oil change. Brown head falls quickly to a ring around my glass. Strong roasty smell of chocolate and coffee. Some pine and licorice aromas were also detected. The first initial sip, I tasted flavors of dark chocolate followed by black coffee. Finishes with a bit of crisp citrusy hops. Some bitter chocolate lingers. Alcohol is barley noticeable, just some slight warming in my chest. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and slightly heavy. Overall, drinkability is fantastic. I would agree this Imperial Stout lives up to the hype. Highly recommended!"
"This puppy is black, with the darkest ruby-hued head I've ever seen. Aroma is a high quality dark chocolate, maybe some espresso or coffee grounds. Taste is the same great dark chocolate, slightly sweet, turning astringent on the finish. Really no harsh alcohol to this one, just a nice warming feeling. There's something in the aftertaste I'm having trouble putting my finger on - astringent, metallic, I'm not sure. It's got a surprising little hoppy kick to it, keeping it crisper than most RIS's. Quite a bit of fine carbonation, too, keeping it light on the tongue. Glad I split this bottle with a friend - Very enjoyable, but I don't think I could really do justice to a full bottle."
"D: A damn fine beer all around. There isn't as much chocolate as there should be in there."
"This is an attractive beverage, and I can't wait to see how it ages in the keg and in the bottle over the next couple of months."
"D-See above...and This beer improves with age and this while still young is certainly WAY more drinkable than last years fresh tap version. The 11% ABV will certainly keep the amount you can imbibe down a bit!"
"Many thanks to Mikesgroove for the chance to try this great RIS! Bottle 384 out of 500. If I had a say I'd have 12 sitting in the cellar to mellow over time!"
"Overall, a brash and bold newcomer to the world of Imperial Stouts. Cheers to BA barleywinebrewer for sharing the wealth from down South!"
"Bottle 186 of 500. Pours black with a pumpkin pie, dark tan and orange head that recedes to a ring. Aroma is sweet and sugary, some cherry and apple fruitiness wrapped in chocolate. Nice roastiness and a bourbony twang, just a hint of leather as well in the aroma. Taste is a somewhat smoky, ashy roastiness blending with the sugary chocolate and sweet fruitiness before a decent amount of piney hoppiness. Finishes with a small bite of alcohol at the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, slightly sticky sugary feel is balanced by the hoppiness, roastiness and alcohol, somewhat drying finish. A very drinkable beer, glad there is another on the way that can age for a little and see what develops. Thanks to Xak and to Pete."
"IMO, this one was slightly overhyped... a good beer, but not worth a kidney, or $200 on ebay."
"SC has everything I love in a RIS and am so happy to have shared this with my lovely. We are planning to watch 'Coming to America' tonight on TNT."
"Clearly a sipper, but one that I found was going down way too easy for its bigness of flavor and ABV. Why play games, Foothills? Make this one available all the time. Please."
"Was excited when I heard this finally going to be bottled, heard it was so good from people who had it on tap in the past, best chocolate stout ever tasted even though it is more of an IRS, would love another bottle of this but know the odds of that are not too good, could not recommend this gem enough if I tried, wow I have been drinking some great beers lately between this and the Russian Rivers last week, worth trading tons for, exceeded my initial expectations, deserves to be in the top fifty, incredible beer overall"
"Mouthfeel- Bold but not aggressive,smooth like a milk stout but not flat. decent carbonation and a staright-up chocolate finish with notes of coffee and the dark and/or roasted roasted malts are evry flavorful. Alcohol is hidden well. A flourish on the palate releases some sweeter flavors. I can only imagine how killer this would be on tap. Worth the wait and the price."
"It's a great stout. For being so strong it still drinks very well, and it also has many flavors buried within. The chocolate is very pronounced though well blended. I seldom can drink two pints of this type of beer, though I managed to do it with this one and I could definitely feel it. It's a very tasty beer with great drinkability, especially for the abv."
"D: I had no idea it was as high ABV as it was. I had this at lunchtime after a breakfast of an apple. I was half-way through it before I ate anything and never noticed the alcohol. It's deceptively easy to drink... and at $2.50 a pint, it was hard to say no!"
"D:I wouldn't be able to drink too many of these beers. They were very good. The strong flavor from the roasted malts prevents it from being a beer that I can drink multiple beers at once. Overall it was a very good beer."
"cheers..."
"The beer arrives in a standard pint glass branded with a Foothills logo as black as the beer itself. The head is the color of cappuccino foam hinting at some of the aromas and flavors awaiting the drinker. The head eventually dissipates to wisps of foam, leaving traces of lace down the side of the glass. In addition to coffee notes in the smell, there is the distinct aromas of dark chocolate coming together to remind you of a cafe mocha. Roasted barley is also evident, rounding out the nose of this beer. Upon taking a sip, all of these aromas come to full life on your tongue. Coffee hints with huge amounts of dark chocolate provide a perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness usually provided only by the finest chocolate makers. At 10% ABV, the lack of alcohol presence on the palate is surprising and evident of proper maturation by the brewer. Swirling the beer around the tongue gives the drinker the chance to fully appreciate the full body of this beer that combines with subtle, even carbonation for an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Sip after sip, this beer is a pleasure to drink. As it warms, flavors of dark fruit present themselves and the aromas become more alive. With the high ABV, you would think that this beer would beg to be drank slowly, but the perfect balance of flavors and incredible smoothness urge you to continue drinking. Chocolate in beer can sometimes be overwhelming and when combined with sweetness, even cloying at times, but Sexual Chocolate is constructed with such care that it just continues to please over and over again. To quote a buddy with me at the time, ""There is not a single aspect of this beer that I do not like."" If that does not motivate you to get a pint of your own, I do not know what will."
"Prosit!"
"The flavor was powerful, black & proud. A generous dose of baker's chocolate, raw cocoa, and buttery cinnamon-bread balanced well with notes of spicy, earthen hops. The mouthfeel was exceptionally thick, velvety smooth, perfectly carbonated for the style, and left a sticky, bittersweet aftertaste that, like the title, can only be called ""sexual chocolate"". I would gladly have this beer again, if only it weren't brewed in such limited batches. Thankfully I live near enough to the brewery to enjoy the fruits of Foothills' labor."
"F."
"Possibly the most drinkable RIS I've had. As mentioned before the alcohol is not to be found. Forget aging...drink this now....Could it possibly get any better?"
"Draft at Foothills on Release day. Black with nice braown head. Aroma has lots of sweetness, coffee and some chocolate raostedness. The flavor is rich with a great balance betwwent eh sweet and hop bitterness. Good full bodied feel. Bought 4 bottles and looking forward to sitting down with it for a more detailed session. Lucky me;)"
"On tap at Tylers in Durham as part of its 08 debut. Pours jet black, no lite penetrating at all as its held to the light. A quarter inch dark tan head escapes not long after my first sip. A ring of steady lace remains. The aroma at first is more subdued. At first just hints of semisweet chocolate and roasted malts. As this beer warms the aroma's really get much more complex, Caramel and charred fruit. Faint hints of anaise as well. The taste starts with a soft bakers chocolate sweetness and caramel undertones. The hops sneak in and assert themselves on your tongue. A warming begins down your throat after a few sips. The mouthfeel is moderate and extremely creamy and smooth. By the time you start to realize the strength of this beer you look down and your Foothills tumbler is almos empty. This beer is much too easy to drink for it's strength. A complex brew that's hard to keep away from your nose and your gullet. Highly Recommended."
"Black is beautiful. This beer pours real dark almost black and has a nice light tan head. The first sip is bliss with the taste of roasted malts and dark chocolate dancing on your tongue. There is a slight undertone of coffee that makes this a complete flavor experience. If you are a stout lover and in the area of the foothils brewing company then get to this beer as fast as you can."
"Drinkability: Highly recommended, it's a very tasty RIS from the folks over at Foothills. Kudos for hiding that 10% abv, too!"
"Very good stout from Foothills...they have yet to disappoint me. Hope we don't have to wait to next V-day to have this again."
"M- Thick and creamy, all the way down. A little lingering dryness at the tail end. Fairly low carbonation, and some light warming."
"Edit: Oh yeah...tried on-tap again recently. A little less roasted than I remember. More rich dark chocolate up front. Slight fresh hop presence lingers. Even a little sour dark fruit that reminds me of a Baltic in a way. A $7 pint was no problem."
"While Sexual Chocolate is perhaps a bit too sweet and rich to drink several glasses of, I sure wouldn't mind trying. As an added bonus, you should not have difficulty finding a woman who likes this beer. Sexist? The truth, more like! Foothills has crafted yet another superb beer. Here's hoping it becomes part of their regular lineup."
"Served in a goblet at the Charlotte Flying Saucer the beer was a very opaque black and presented a thin off white head that was diminishing and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by dark chocolate. Some espresso and roasted barley, but mostly chocolate. The taste was mostly great dark bitter chocolate. There was a good blend of dark malts present as well, with some coffee flavor, but once again, chocolate dominates. The mouthfeel was heavy as expected at 10% abv, but the alcohol was also well hidden by the chocolate bitterness. There was a pleasantly low carbonation as well. This was a great sipping beer. Holds up very well with others of the style and the addition of real chocolate was a great touch."
"Body is huge, silky, and has a texture like melted chocolate. Incredibly rich and creamy. Feels so luxurious the name is definately appropriate. Begs to be paired with anything chocolate."
"drinkability: sipped over the course of an hour...quite good, a slow drinker but that's to be expected"
"Drinkability: Rather determined toward its goal, this libation is lucious and titillating but it's just a bit too hot for me to handle; next time I'll return to the safer zone of the Total Eclipse Stout"
"I could drink this stuff all night. Mouthfeel is not quite full bodied but it certainly is typical of an imperial stout. ABV very well hidden for an impy stout. This was a wonderful beer and certainly able to be enjoyed by you and your sweetie."
