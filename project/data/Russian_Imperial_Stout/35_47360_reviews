"Excited to finally try this one, but I thought it'd be a little better. It's still pretty tasty, anyway."
""
"Overall: Excellent RIS with moderate complexity."
""
"V - Medium value."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pure pitch black in color with about a one-finger foamy/creamy beige head that hangs along for a while. A good amount of thick lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the glass. The aroma is mostly of dark roasted malts, toffee and coffee. The taste is bold with lots of flavor of the above ingredients. A slightly dry and very light bitter finish is noted but doesn't take away much from this brew. Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation for this brew style. The brew actually tasted better when warmed up as this is more of 'sipping brew' than drinking it down in a few minutes. Kick back and enjoy this one during the cooler months. Another tasty brew from the Sam Adam's folks. Cheers!"

"Finally drinking a bottle I’ve have in the fridge for a few years. This pours a pitch black color with a slight brown head. The aroma is filled with coffee, toffee, and robust tones. The flavor is big, bold, and full of flavors. This is a sweet, robust beer that delivers in the flavor category. This brew has really held up over the years I’ve had it. Maybe a little bourbon aging with help this beer *hint hint Jim Koch*"

"O- this bottle was nearly three years old, and it is drinking wonderful. Alcohol is barely detectable and the chocolate and dark fruits have taken over, making it a sweet sipper. If you take the Sam Adams label off of this beer, I guarantee it would be rated higher"
""
""
"O - Well, this is a ok RIS. Just too many good ones out there to choose from. Cheers."

"Pour out dark as night with a one finger brown head with good retention and some nice lacing. Smell is of chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, a little toffee, and some burnt malts. The smell is better than expected. Taste is coffee forward with all the attributes I sensed from the nose except I didn't get the chocolate in the taste. Mouthfeel is quite thick which is nice for the style. Overall this is quite a nice beer for the style and a lot better than I expected."

"A great example of what Samuel Adams can do when they put their heart into it!"
""
""
"I'm not going to type a whole lot on this one. Just want to say that I think it was an attempt at something good that failed. The brew had the appearance. Had the smell even. But the flavor tasted... I don't know, forced. Almost like some sort of artificial flavor was added. It left this starchy aftertaste too that lasted long after it was gone. Also, you can taste the alcohol in this one. Not that its a bad thing. Just that combine with the ""forced"" flavor made me think I was drinking some sort of flavored malt beverage, rather than a brewed stout. I tried to be fair with the rating best I could."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty awesome RIS. It has a lot of deep flavors yo go with the traditional ones people would expect from this style."
""
""
""
"Overall –Overall the brew had a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, sweet, roasty and malty. A quite tasty and enjoyable imperial."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark and intimidating. Fair head, and some slight lacing. Nose is characteristic roasted coffee and malt, dark chocolate, licorice, and molasses. Thick and malty with bitter licorice, pungent peat, and bittersweet chocolate. Well balanced, but a little boozy. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"A bit too obvious alcohol, and a surprisingly short finish. Otherwise, this is a classic RIS that don’t disappoint. A good introduction to the style."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is the old label, so it should be a few years old. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, toast, toffee, light char, molasses, raisin, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light char, raisin, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, raisin, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with big flavor robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial stout. All around good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with big robustness and very easy sipping. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - This style really isnt my favorite, but this is done pretty well, though it does have a more tart sour cherry type quality to it than most RIS beers, I'd say put it in a blindfold taste with some others and see if people guess that its Sam's."
""
""
""
"O- It is ok, more balanced out with nothing really popping out to grab me. But to be fair, I did try this after a Old Rasputin RIS and the SA iS is on the other end of the spectrum. Wonderfull appearance, average nose, alright taste and mouthfeel."

"Nice job Sam Adams."
"I was hoping for more body. This seemed a bit thin, and the finish then was the same, somewhat thin. Plus there was a bit of an after taste I could not figure out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice brew. It is hearty, full of flavor and satisfying. Glad i finally tried and would recommend."

"If you are looking for a top shelf beer that is strong, sweet and dark, this brew from Boston Brewing is as good as any I've had in the genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice beer. A very nice beer, in fact. It's not an imperial stout that redefines the genre, but it's well made and well-structured. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O – This is a nice RIS. As I said before, it’s not as complex as some of the best beers of the style, but it’s a great basic example of the style – just like most Samuel Adams beers. It’s very tasty and drinkable, and the ABV is hidden very well. While there are other Russian imperial stouts that I’d rather have, I would certainly never say no to this one. Nice beer from Sam."
"Overall - Extremely thick and relaxing beer to sip on. Excellent dessert beer, especially if you love coffee and chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall not bad but not really a big kick ass stout like most RIS's. Fairly descent but have had regular stouts with this much flavor. Did enough the smokey notes though seems a nice touch."

"Pours dark brown/black. One finger of creamy brown head that recedes after a minute leaving a light lace. Aroma is heavy dark chocolate with a light roastiness. Light sweetness of chocolate up front, with a dry roasted coffee finish. Subtle spice aftertaste - the anise perhaps. Smooth lightly carbonated thick body. Alcohol is well masked by the strong chocolate/coffee flavors. Very good beer with excellent body. Will definately have this again sometime. This almost tastes like a milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Given its sweet nature and relative simplicity, I'd recommend this as a dessert beer or to someone who's never had an imperial stout before. All in all, this one is a fine offering, but nowhere near my favorite in the style. I'd pick Old Rasputin, Black Chocolate Stout, or Yeti over this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice, flavorful beer with decent drinkability. It has all of the right flavors and has really nice balance. My only dislike is that this isn't as full flavored as it possibly could be. I would definitely have this again."
""
"Overall- A very well done stout. I have no complaints here. High ABV, check. Chocolate and caramel flavoring, check. Roasted malt taste, check. No overwhelming coffee tones, check. Definitely recommend. Another well done brew in the Imperial Series by Sam Adams."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very good imperial stout from Sam Adams. I gotta admit, I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the well-rounded qualities of this RIS. It's not the most aggressive or the smoothest, but it hits on a lot of things well."

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours black with a thick, dark tan head. The head retreats slowly. There are some visible bubbles underneath the head, indicating some mild carbonation in the beer. The beer is completely opaque. There is some lacing left on the side of the glass. I detect chocolate, coffee, and toffee. The alcohol is not detectable in the aroma. There's a nice bitterness from the dark roasted malts in the flavor. There's the chocolate and the coffee notes as well, but the sweetness is very mild. The alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. The body is full with mild carbonation. This is a smooth RIS. This is a very good beer."
""
"O - Very good stout. Impressive beer by boston brewing, and my favorite of the Imperial Series. I've said it frequently, Sam Adams has a common failing which is the distinctive aftertaste of leather, Fortunately they are so prolific that they make plenty of beers that either hide this well, or completely lack it. And those beers are always amazing, which is why Sam Adams, when on point, can make an extremely enjoyable, unique beer. This is one of those."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe I got a bad bottle? There were a lot of off notes in this one that I'd assume others didn't get, judging by the scores. Oh well, plenty of other good stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with lingering tan head and lacing. Looks really good. Smell is very smokey scotch, some roasted and chocolate malts as well. Taste is of scotch, roasted malts, some chocolcate and booze. Its creamy but bitter and a nice brew. I'd get again when the budget doesn't call for a ""whale"" RIS. Nicely priced for the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this beer to be an enjoyable and well-rounded Russian Imperial Stout. It packs in a good amount of flavors and also hides its alcohol very well from the taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a reddily available imperial stout, not too expensive. Even though it is flavors, other examples have more character. Solid, but nothing too special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very average beer for the style. Not one I would reach for again."
""
""
"Overall - It's got some great flavor, but the aftertaste does need some work before it can be an outstanding beer.."
""
""
""
""
"Imperial Stout pours a black color, with a small lacey tan head. There is a a strong roasted malt aroma with a bitter coffee. Strong smokey malt backbone, with a robust coffee flavor, with hints of chocolates, and just a bit warm from the alcohol. Great full bodied flavor. Overall this stout comes together very nicely, great blend of of the strong malts with strong coffee flavors, and I really enjoy the subtle warming from the alcohol."
""
"Overall: Excellent representative of an imperial stout, Sam Adams has done a good job with this. A little sweeter than some of its peers, but the alcohol masks it, in a good way! Will have to get a couple of bottles when I next come across this."
""
""
"Overall this was o.k."
""
"Overall this is a decent example of the style and one, that because of the brand, might be attractive to a craft beer fan. It is by no means stellar or really worth seeking out but there are worse example that is for sure. As far as Imperial Stouts go it is fairly drinkable."

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours black with a thin dark brown head and nice lacing. Dark malt and slight chocolate and coffee aroma. Dark malt, dark fruit, mild chocolate. Alcohol seeps in at the finish to diminish the other flavors, finishes somewhat dry and thin for the style. Medium body. Tastes fine, but somewhat underwhelming against other RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good but not great. A little above average. Recommended to try once, but nothing spectacular. There are many other good RIS's out there to try before we reach for this one."
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan, but I hope it grows on me."

"Saw this in the refrigerator over the 4th and had to try Sam Adams take on an imperial stout. It's traditional and reminds me of Samuel Smith, but with more alcohol."
"Then there's the chocolate-mocha on the palate. Possibly over-sweet. The one drawback for me is the dominance of molasses flavor."
"Samuel Adams may be one of the biggest craft breweries (probably the biggest,) but they still make some good beers. It isn't the best imperial stout in the world, but I quite enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am actually quite impressed with this one, I would easily have this again, and even take it over many other Russian Imperial Stouts as well."
""
""
"This beer was aged a few months and mellowed a little bit as the other bottles were a little more in your face with the booze when they were fresher. Overall I liked this beer as it makes a nice nightcap and is tasty and worth a try. Only knock is that it borders on being too boozy."
""
""
"Overall- I have tried many of Samuel Adams beers and many are quite enjoyable. But I've never been impressed with any of their Imperial Series. This is the best of that group but it still isn't that great."
""
"Samuel Adams' Imperial Stout is better compared to more traditional English examples of the RIS style, but it should still be considered a masculine, muscular monster. The tasting notes listed above speak for themselves. If you salivate at the thought of game-meat basted in coffee and roasted in the fireplace, then you may have found heaven. If not, but you think that sounds intriguing, then maybe you've found your next purchase."
""
"D - For some reason I can't explain, I'm not a huge fan. It is really a case where the some of the parts is greater than the whole. It looks good, smells good, feels good, tastes okay (maybe that is it), but I just am not thrilled about it. It's not bad, but I doubt I'll buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good RIS overall, at a great price. Like a lot of Sam Adams beers, this seems a bit subdued, and so doesn't really stand out. But it is a tasty and easy drinking RIS that I could see having again."
""
""
"O: Like the Double Bock, this member of the Sam Adams Imperial Series could be considered a standard for the style. Absolutely wonderful, and for only $2 a bottle or so, I have a feeling I’ll be buying this one again and again."
""
""
""
"Now that I've had the Imperial White, Double Bock, and this, I can say that Sam Adams' RIS is probably the one that held up best over time (by virtue of comparison to other world-class beers of various styles I've had since)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black as tar with that kind of consistency. Some brown flecks but otherwise picth black. Nose is chocolate, raisins, licorice. Taste is a rich roasted stout. Dark fruits swirl in the mix. Thick and hearty. Bittering close that lingers. Anise. Espresso. Its all in there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer enough to have it again and it would make a nice choice for mixing it up when enjoying RIS."
"O: A straightforward imperial stout, fragrant with strong flavors, just wish it was smoother and more complex"
"C"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, but I've had much better RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this one. Not my go-to RIS, but it's a nice, widely available, affordable one. Would recommend."
""
"Overall, this is a very decent imperial stout. I would buy this again for sure. I wonder what age does to it?"
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the beers that got me into craft in the first place, so I definitely have a soft spot for it. It also helps that this is a very solid imperial stout that gets a lot of flak for no reason. Almost a must-try if you like the style"
""
""
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours an opaque black, with a thick looking, sticky, one inch expresso colored head. Lacing and lots of it and wonderful retention. Smell is chocolate covered raisins, dark malts, figs, and some roasted coffee. Taste is all of that, huge blast of strong coffee in the finish. Fairly dry finish, body is on the large side, and perfect amount of life. This beer really surprised me, my taste buds have changed, years ago wasn't much of a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is great, you get a lot for the price point. Also nice to find a stellar RIS in a 12 oz bottle."
""
"Dark black with a broken mocha sheet leaving spotty lace. Smells of chocolate, black cherry, caramel, licorice and molasses with a little bit of raisin. Alcohol is the first thing I taste, then there is a good dose of toasted malts and cocoa tones with a little metallic season on the finish. There are some coffee grounds and sweet malts as well. Medium on thin for the style with a hi carb for the style. Semi dry finish. The beer is decent, and apporachable. I would recommend this as a starter Impy stout as it carries the character without spoiling the newcomer with the best aspects."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer. I’m a bit of a Sam Adams homer, but this one hit the spot. Good RIS."
"I love this beer. As I said above I wish Boston Beer Company would sell an aged version of this beer. I've still got one bottle left, I'll be updating this review in another 2-5 years."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 3/4"" mocha head with decent lifespan. The body is a clear dark walnut woodstain brown. It's got the Imperial Stout smell right with roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. The taste repeats those flavors but there's also a very yeasty aspect to it, and the finish equals the bitterness of a bite of very dark chocolate. A pretty decent Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- My overal on this brew is hands down totally drinkable. I've had this beer several times before and I've grown to love it more and more every time. Its not a super crazy Imp. stout but very well put together and would recommend to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is soft and slightly thick, it is comfortable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has the expected inky dark color and two fingers of dark tan colored head that recedes to a crown layer in about two minutes, with some minor lace curtains left behind. Smells mostly of dark chocolate but also contains a decent amount of roasted character with a smaller background levels of prunes and other dark fruits. Flavor leans more on the roasted malt side of the equation, with the black bitter coffee and dark fruits coming in second and third place respectively. I'm not really picking up on any of the anise flavor that everybody else seems to be getting. Body is on the heavy side, but smooth and soft enough to avoid becoming clingy. Straight 4s across the board, a well made RIS."
""
"o - a good beer but so many other imperial stouts blow this out of the water. not really cheap enough to keep some on hand either, ~$12/4pk. worth trying if you come across it though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like it, this RIS has a good roasted malt profile and body. I enjoyed it and would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent beer in the Imperial Series but compared to other Russian Stouts out there it's a little more subdued and tame. This one could use some more b@lls on the roasted malt."
"O- Eh this one was a miss for me. I like imperial stouts that are more roasted in character. This one leans to sweet for me."
""
"Overall: A pretty good take on an Imperial Stout. Well balanced and the underlying dark fruits are very nice."
"Very nice pour. Big tan head with retention not to mention a nice lace down the glass. Very nice looking beer. Scents of cocoa and coffee. Pretty rich taste. A bit light on the mouth feel and alcohol is a bit overwhelming. It is not a bad stab at the style but in no way compares to the better American Russian Imperials."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one of my favorite Sam Adams beers. A great Stout, with a solid amount of alcohol. High price, but is worth it if you enjoy a good creamy, coffee stout."

""
""
"Not the greatest of the style, but it's pretty hard to find a quality Imperial Stout for less than $3. Were I to find it again for tht price, I'd consider trying it again."
""
""
""
"Smell is dark fruit, roasted malts, and possibly a tiny bit of coffee (may be muted after storage) may be in the nose. Taste is of roasted malts, dark fruits, and really not much I can pick out. Nice beer but nothing special. Great for a Samual Adams beer but you know they know how to do better."
""
"O- This is a pretty good offering by Sam Adams, Better then their Wee Heavy from what I remember. There isnt as much flavor as their should be and its just too intense to not have more flavors."
""
" Overall this was a Pleseant suprise. A well crafted RIS. I would not hesitate to buy more of this."
""
"O-Another disappointing installment of the Imperial Series. With all of the good Imperial Stouts out there this one does not compare."
""
"Not bad."
""
""
""
"O: Good overall. The smell is excellent, but the taste dropped off a bit from expectations the nose created. A bit of a watery taste, but I could still pick up on the coffee, malt, and anise. Good, not great."
""
""
""
"Taste is burnt malts, coffee, dark chocolate, figs, dried apricot, leather. The coffee adn candied fruits become more prominent as it warms, and there's little evidence of the 9.2% ABV. Complex and delightful imperial stout."
""
"D - A solid Russian Imperial Stout... Accessible and never overpowering, but still loaded with enough complexity and character to keep even the most experienced BA interested..."
""
""
""
""
"love this beer! I am not a big fan of Samuel Adams beers but I will try any stout once and I am glad I did. This Imperial stout went down pretty smooth, awesome smell, taste and mouthfeel great; Surprisingly good after taste! The down side is it is a bit more expensive than old rasputin so i would go with the old rasputin."
"O: I actually like this better than the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout I reviewed yesterday. Great sticky lacing, rich roasted smell, and a flavor to match without the off-putting taste of alcohol. I only wish this was a bit more creamy. Overall, a solid Russian Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very solid beer from a very solid brewery. It would be cool to try this with some age and maybe even some different flavor variations (bourbon, coffee, etc)."
""
"Pours a beautiful pitch black with a half-inch coffee-colored head, which sadly disappeared almost instantly. Smells strongly of chocolate and roasted coffee -- pleasant, if a little two dimensional. Flavor is slightly more rewarding. Dark chocolate, coffee and slightly roasted notes balanced out by slightly hoppiness and alcohol flavor typical of a higher ABV beer. Body is thick as a stout should be, but not overwhelmingly so or creamy."
""
""
"My mind wasn't blown, but this is a pretty solid stout. Good stuff, short of being something special."
"O-Sadly, I'm really under-whelmed by this. I expected more from them, especially with a year of cellaring, but there's just nothing that outstanding here"
"Complex, but lacks the real roasted stout flavor that I like in the style."

"Overall: My favorite in the Imperial series, and might be yours too. One of the best stouts out on the market maybe my number 4 which means a lot. Yes there's 3 better stouts I have had than this but doesn't mean Sam Adams Imperial Stout is on top of the food chain. Drink with responsibility and cheers to all!"
""
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit imperial stout. I don't even think I've had a bad one. Lets be honest, it's hard to rate a beer when they're too bold to show their flaws - thus having no flaws."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint, the body is black as night with a light brown head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is sweet, almost molassas and some coffee notes. The taste is bitter of burnt malts, some coffee notes and a little anise flavor. It has a nice mouth feel and overall is a good beer for its style. I'm not a big fan of RIS, but i try them anyway."
"Overall (3.0): I’m willing to bet that a lot of people out there will like this beer substantially more than me. I’m not a fan of anise in general, and this beer’s flavor profile is dominated by anise—kind of wish it leaned more towards the coffee and molasses personally, but it is what it is, and it’s not exactly for me. Glad to have tried, won’t be seeking out again."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve=ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
""
"Overall, a very complex and heavy flavor, but it's not for me. The anise flavor is overpowering in my opinion, and it's not an overly attractive flavor profile. Still, this is not a bad representation of the style."
""
"Sam Adams' Imperial Stout is a sit-by-the-fire kind of beer, that is warm, tasty and comforting. Perfect for a Nor'easter, this is an easy drinking brew. One thing it isn't, however, is typical of the RIS's I'm familiar with. This is a much less aggressive and creamier brew. Still, it is definitely worth a try."
""
"Super average Imperial Stout. If that. Most I end up getting are among the best, so this was a disappointment, bought on a whim just to see what Sam Adams could do with an IS. Not pleased. Fizzy mouthfeel, kind of thin! Boring burnt/sweet taste with a hint of soy sauce. Kind of pissed I spent $10 on the 4-pack. I guess I'll keep these for late nights when I'm less interested in tasting what I'm drinking. Not horrible, but not great. If it was free I'd like it better."
"Overall, this looks like the imperial stout you really couldn't go wrong with. It doesn't break any boundaries, but it does what it's set out to do, and it does that quite well."
"Appearance----DARK, no really DARK this is black or very close. Smell it every inviting, and complex. Coffee, chocolate and anise are about. Mouthfeel is very nice for a stout and doesn't linger. Taste, Wow, this is like dark chocolate drizzled with coffee and anise. Very nice dark beer. Overall a good beer will go well with cheese cake, good cheese cake(New York sytle)."
"A solid RIS but does have some flaws. Better examples out there."

"O - A very drinkable and flavorful imp stout, pretty complex, but not the best balanced. In fact, as this one warms the alcohol has become noticeably and significantly stronger, and is actually muting/overtaking a few of the flavors I've mentioned earlier. I would drink this one closer to 40-45 degrees."
"D/O- Been awhile since I've had this, pleasantly surprise with how it held up. Very nice, widely-available impy stout."
""

"RJT."
"Overall, the overly bitter flavor profile detracts from an otherwise big and fairly complex brew. I’ve definitely had better, namely Stone RIS, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, and Great Divide Yeti. Worth a try."

"O- This was my first stout and it was quite tasty. I think I will keep a bottle to age and see what happens."
"It's a good imperial stout, though there are many others I would rather drink."
"Excellent drink and it hits the style perfectly. Drink it on a dark and stormy night (like I am) to warm you up."

"Overall, I think this is a very good stout from Sam Adams. Definitely going to age one and see how it develops."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours an opaque black, with a thick looking, sticky, one inch expresso colored head. Lacing and lots of it and wonderful retention. Smell is chocolate covered raisins, dark malts, figs, and some roasted coffee. Taste is all of that, huge blast of strong coffee in the finish. Fairly dry finish, body is on the large side, and perfect amount of life. This beer really surprised me, my taste buds have changed, years ago wasn't much of a fan."
"O- An extremely solid and drinkable, if somewhat traditional, take on the style. Anyway, I'm very impressed, this beer should make it onto anyone's must-try list for the winter."
"O: Very nice, bone dry and quite complex in all it's modesty."
"O- Ok imperial stout. Would be a decent option if you want to drink a couple imperial stouts in a night."
"It made me want to try the other higher end beers that Sam Adams is making."
"It's another one of those brews that are really planned out. They had a specific flavor in mind and obviously went thorough a lot of testing to get it just right. I'll be buying a six pack of this anytime I come across it."
"O: Overall, it reminds me of a nice rich old style english stout, because of its coffee, dark chocolate, booze, and light raisin notes. This really is a good stout, but with some aging I think the booziness will subside. I am also hoping it will balance out with a little bit more sweetness which will complement the roastiness."
"Dr. One was enough. Trying it in a beef stew."
"O: I've always felt that the Samuel Adams beers are solid and receive an unwarranted degree of bashing from many beer geeks. The quality of this beer, I feel, provides evidence of this trend. If you've never had a Russian imperial stout, then it would not be a bad idea to start with this one and branch out. If you're already familiar with the style, give this one a fair chance. It just might impress you."
"Overall Impression- My favorite from Samuel Adams now! This one was impressive with its roastiness and chocolate flavor. I enjoyed this throughly and will be having more from this ""Limited Series""."
"Stay away if you don't like the sweeter or thicker bodied stouts. It's not super chewy but it's close. Good job by BBC."
"O- I had this bottle for over a year and expected it to mellow out. Not a bad imperial stout, but not as good as most if the ones I have tried."
"Overall: This is an impressive beer as for the smell and pour. The taste is good but not quite what I hoped after seeing it and smelling it."
"O: I was very delighted by this beer, especially for a sam adams, which I am generally not a fan of. If they could calm down the sweetness, this would be a fantastic beer."
"O - Excellent beer from a brewery that excels in middle of the road beers. Not my favorite stout by far, but you could do a whole lot worse."
"O- Should have bought another Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout instead."
"Overall: A fine sipping beer for a cold night; much like brandy. Tried it with cheddar, then almonds, then cashews. Nice pairings. Wish I'd had a chocolate chip cookie to pair. Even better as it warms. Still liked the Imperial Double Bock and Imperial White better."
"This pours somewhat thick, its pitch black (even held up to the light with a nice mocha head with good retention. The smell is of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, the alcohol is also noticeable. The feel is very thick and chewy, one of the thicker beers I've had (off the top of my head only ten fifty is thicker). The taste is pretty good also, I get the dark roasted malts, a heavy coffee flavor and some sweetness, reminds me of a molasses type sweetness, there is also some alcohol burn. Overall this is a very good stout and one of the better (best?) beers from Sam Adams, although at $10 a 4 pack, Old Rasputin is cheaper and Green Flash Double Stout is the same price both of which I slightly prefer, so I'm not sure how often I'll buy this, but I'll occasionally pick it up, its a tasty stout."
"O- Great beer from a commercial brewery but nonetheless an enjoyable, with a hearty thanksgiving football dinner kind of beer. If i can find, it I'd seek it out again and leave it aging for a long while. Tastes a lot better when its aged..."
"O: This is an outstanding Imperial Stout. Catherine would have been amazed. Make no mistake -- this is not a beer for beginners. It is a BIG Imperial beer, and as such, should be sipped slowly when you are not going out again. As a side note, it mixes beautifully (50-50) with a traditional English IPA (NOT an American IPA -- the English hops are complimentary, but the citrusy/resiny American hops would not blend well with the strong coffee and anise of these dark malts) to create an entirely different, but equally interesting beer. Note: I brew my own traditional English IPA, so unfortunately, I can’t recommend one, but I’m sure some research would yield good results. Otherwise, you might want to try blending this with a good English brown ale. It would lose some depth, but should be interesting, nonetheless."
"Overall I tasted this beer after I first bought it and was dissapointed so I cellar-ed the remaining bottles for close to three years. The aging improved this beer dramatically. Aging turns this beer into a very good RIS."
"O: This beer is greater than the sum of its parts. No single exceptional characteristic, but it is very pleasant. It's difficult to pin down where the enjoyment comes from, exactly, but there must be something said for being quite good in a number of respects. For the price, definitely worth picking up and it is certainly my favorite of Sam's Imperial Series."
"O - Good lord, delicious. This is what an Imperial Stout is."
"Overall: Normally I’m not too impressed with their offerings, not that they are bad, but as my pallet has expanded I’ve branched out from SA. I did enjoy this one and thought it was a good representation of a RIS."
"O - worth picking up for the looks alone. nothing like drinking a strong abyss of a beer"
"This RIS has aged very well."
"M - Too much carbonation, and a little bit too watery feel for a Russian Imperial Stout."
"A worthy stout, kind of reminds me of stouts you get at micro-brews, which is usually a pretty good thing."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with a half-inch milk chocolate colored head that is dense, small bubbled, and has great staying power. The beer has a nose of coffee, dark chocolate, and a little hint of booze. The aromas are very well blended, with a slight smokiness, also. The beer has a rich base of flavors, and initially you get the dark roasted coffee with a boozey highlight. As the beer crosses and covers your tongue, you will get more of the chocolate, and even a dark fruit sweetness, but just slightly. The beer is mid-bodied, but leaves a thick, frothy lacing on the glass while you drink. You get a decent warming from the ABV, also. The aftertaste is darkly sweet, with an overtly roasted chocolate character. The finish is slick, with a boozey feel, and it slightly coats the mouth a bit. Definitely a good winter warmer, and a decent stout overall."
"Good looking brew that I'd be willing to give another try sometime down the road."
"O: Not the absolute best Imperial I've known in my taste , but very good overall. I would recommend it."
"Overall, I think this is a stellar Imperial Stout, and I place it right up with Old Rasputin in terms of potential. Because while this is excellent fare now, if you threw a few of these into a cellar for five years, you'd have an unbeatable drink."
"Overall - Really good. Wasnt expecting this to be such a monster full of flavors. I wish the put the effort into all there other beers like the imperial series. Only hangup is this is a little too alcohol strong flavor, makes me want to age this and enjoy in a year or so."
"O: This is a really well put together stout. 4.5"
"Overall, I wasn't expecting much going in but this beer was pretty good. Nicely balanced and not one-dimensional like many examples of this style tend to be. One of the better Boston Beer Co. beers I've had."
"Very disappointing."
"Drink- I never saw this in CA so grabbed a bottle in LV, a tasty stout that was pretty balanced with that hop/anise tinge."
"Pours an opaque brown colour with creamy tan head. Nice lacing around the glass. Smells of roasted malt with some mild chocolate and a hint of coffee. Nice roasty flavour, some bitterness in the aftertaste. Fairly smooth mouthfeel. A very nice imperial stout."
"This beer pours a black color with a finger of brown head that dissipates rapidly. The aroma has hints of figs and chocolate and cherries. The taste starts with figs and cherries and chocolate, then finishes with a slight coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is a bit watery. Overall a good imperial stout."
"Disappointing RIS. I will not have this again."
"O - Samuel Adams has always been one of my favorite brewers. This stout is really good, but not the best I've had. For its price, I think you could do better if you had a good selection. Otherwise, nothing to complain about."
"D: Wish I could've tried this one as a comparison when it was fresh, but really nice."
"This yet another premo beer from Sam Adams, I am almost always happy with the beer I buy with their name on it."
"Jet black body with a fast fading mocha head. Decent nose, dark fruits, bitter chocolate, coffee beans, also something sweet in there - cant figure out the scent though. Pretty much just getting those dark fruits and roasted malts, with a fairly bitter finish - not the best tasting RIS ive tried. Slightly thin in the mouth, and again, that bitter finish is stuck in my mind. Id go as far as to call the carbonation above average for the style. Simply put, a slightly above average take on the style."
"It's a pretty good beer. I wish the smells and flavors were a bit stronger, but it's not bad at all."
"Foamy tan head forms about a finger high over a pitch black body. Coffee and milky chocolate with some lactic sourness. Taste is milky chocolate but with a bitter coffee finish. Some fennel also works well with piney hop and bitter chocolate finish. At first the chocolate flavors are sweet but then transition to bitter. Through the middle there is a metallic, penny flavor but it is covered up by the hops. Alcohol is not present which is surprising with a relatively thin body."
"O-its not a terrible beer, and it does have some serious robust flavor to it, but i wouldn't call it a good imperial stout necessarily. it has too much of a roasted/smoke flavor to it. when i drank this, i was really thirsty for a good hearty stout, i didn't fulfill my need."
"O: Overall I think its a good beer, but drinkability is low for me (a slow sipper for sure) and as much as I like Porters and Stouts I'm not sure I'd seek this out again."
"Pours a black opaque with a large creamy tan head. Smell is of roasted sweet malts, some smoke, chocolate, with some ripe plum aroma as well. The first taste I get is the sweet roasted malts then chocolate covered figs-plums, a little toffee, and a slight hop taste to finish. Not your typical stout but a pleasent surprise. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, not bad at all. Overall not what I was expecting but I was pleased with this one."
"The Imperial Stout was the first of the three in the series that I tried. The pour was a dark black that generated a nice brown colored head that lasted for a little while. The smell was heavily burnt and roasted with some dark chocolate in there as well. The taste gave off much of the same flavors as the smell did but with the addition of some fresh wood in there too. The mouthfeel could have been a little thicker I think but overall this brew was pretty good."
" dark chocolate flavor, very pronounced and noticeable. As it mellowed lots of roasted coffee and some notes of cookie dough and even a touch of vanilla were becoming noticeable. Very sweet and sugary on the palate, with a very present abv warming thoughout. It was not a light brew by any means. A very full flavor and feeling coming off of this one. Reminded me of some of thee other breakfast stouts I have had in the past. Very full bodied and the more you sip the more flavors you start to notice. Damn fine crafting on this one."
"This pours your typical RIS, deep dark black plum with slight brown highlights. It is accompanied by a 2 finger beige head that swims to a thin beige lace as it warms up. The first smell on the nose to me is almost that of sweet dark fruits and black licorice. Followed powerfully by deep dark chocolates and roasted coffee beans. Hints of cherries and vanilla also find their way into the swirl, a nice esspresso fudge brownie comes to mind. The taste also has the sweet dark fruits on the front followed by chocolate, toffee, alcohol, and finishes with a deep coffee taste. Full on the feel, bitter sweet, very sweet, syrupy, heavy. Overall it was good to try. This is a decent RIS from SA."
"Overall-Nothing memorable, but not bad. Definitely lacking some sweetness. It's Reasonable for a RIS 4 pack which is a plus."
"I'm wondering if I picked up a bad bottle of this, but seeing as how it's 9.2% in a dark brown bottle with heavy labeling and packaging, it should take a fair amount of light or bacteria to spoil this one. Not a very good representation of the style in my opinion, the taste is way overburdened by the alcohol, such that little else comes through. A disappointing effort from Boston Beer Company."
"O: Average and a bit disappointing, and is not to SA quality, imho. It tasted too sweet, and I had a hard time finishing a 12 oz bottle. I shared some with my wife, and she felt the same. I'm use to strong beers too, but this missed the mark for me in balance, taste, and enjoyment."
"O/A--I'm sorry to say, I'm kinda mad I wasted $11 on a 4 pack of this crap. It must be a really old pack or lightstruck or something because its hard for me to believe this has a decent rating here. This is literally the worst stout I've ever had and I won't be trying it again unless they start putting a discernable date on these things and I get a fresh one."
"Overall: A decent example of the style and one, that because of the brand, might attract a new crowd; still, I can easily list many others that I would prefer"
"O: A good example of a classic RIS. I like the balance in the flavor profile, especially with the hops as some either go overboard with a leafy hop character or have no hop character at all. I did feel like the taste fell a little short of the nose and the mouthfeel wasn't as thick and smooth as I'd like out of a RIS. Overall though, it's a solid RIS for a very reasonable price."
"O - This will probably be the last SA Imperial Series brew I'll try. This beer just isn't as bold and complex as the label say. Honestly, it's almost kinda watery and bland."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I don't know that I'd buy a whole 4 pack, but I'd definitely throw a bottle in a mixed 6 (which is how I got this one). The alcohol is well hidden, making for a drinkable IS."
"Overall, I find this very drinkable, but no more than 2 in a night."
"Finish: Little heat on the back with the roosted to toasty malt"
"Even though this is strong, there wasn't an excessive amount of alcohol in this beer. The balance certainly is there but I never found a lot to savor with each sip. If I had the 4-pack of this, I could probably put a few away in a given night, which is not how I usually tend to drink my Stouts. This isn't the best or the worst of Sam's that I've had but I think this should only come in a 22 oz. bottle as there are much better offerings that I would get should the next time I stock up on some Stouts."
"A Jet black body with a nice tan head that disappears too quickly. S. Oakey almost burbon like,peat,and some muted fruit T. Mild chocolate, charred oak , raisins possibly and cream M. Medium chewiness very liquid goes down easily O. Overall I like this brew did'nt think a big brewer could pull off an I.S. this well but I take my hat off to the Sam Adams people. I will buy more."
"O - at 9.2% this is dangerously drinkable, well put together, and a big beer all around"
"Pours a thick opaque black with a huge 3 inch dark khaki head that lasts. Random patterns of lace on the glass on the drink down. Smells of plums/raisins, licorice, milk chocolate, and slight soy sauce. Taste is of dark fruits, licorice, chocolate covered fruits, and soy sauce. There is an acidic component to this beer that lingers on the palate after each sip - almost a citrus juice taste/feel. Mouthfeel is a bit flat with a thickness in the mouth that is somewhat hard to take combined with the flavors of the beer. Overall, a pretty good RIS and one of the best from Sam Adams but there are lots of better beers out there."
"Overall, not my favorite Sam Adams beer - nor is it my favorite imperial stout. Definitely not a bad beer, but it lacks a certain something that makes it a great beer."
"O - By far the best Sam Adams offering I've had to date. Some huge bold flavours that make for a memorable experience and a drinkable feel that could have you tossing these back all night!"
"NOTE: This is number 4 of a 4pk. I found this beer a bit twangy, harsh, and hard to drink straight off the shelf. Each bottle got better with time. I recommend putting it back for at least 6 months. It would probably do well with a year on it."
"One of those sweeter than roasty stouts. A simple adjustment to the sweet to roasty ratio would rock my socks."
"This was a pretty good RIS, nice balanced flavor. Not easy to drink more than one or two."
"O-Overall I'm a tad disappointed in this one. Was expecting something different. It's not bad, but it's not that good either."
"After being pulled back into the world of craft brewed beers recently I was looking for a less expensive alternative to consuming Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout at $9.99 a 12 oz bottle. I stumbled across Sam Adams' Imperial Stout 4 pack and decided to give it a try. I found the initial pour to be a deep dark brown to black with a thin dark brown head with a nice cling. My initial nosing was of all things rich and dark. Hints of chocolate, coffee and dark leather. My initial tatse found this brew to be a delicious mix of dark bitter chocolat ewithout being overly sweet. I found the brew to be almost creamy. Although I still love everything Sam it is evident it doesn't have the same outcome of other craft breweries out there. Certainly a reccomended brew."
"Notes: I think this is a quality brew with a lot of interesting tastes, but I did not fully enjoy drinking it due to the alcohol. Perhaps this is stylistic (My only RIS)."
"Samuel Adams Imperial Stout was opaque black in color. It had a tan head with good retention and lacing. The smell was roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. The taste was dark malt, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and alcohol. The finish was semi-sweet with throat warming alcohol and some lingering roasted flavors. The mouthfeel was good with a full body and medium-light carbonation, quite creamy. The drinkability was good. This is a tasty brew and worth a try."
"Drinkability is ok, it's well made technically, just a kind of boring design."
"D - Good stout overall; plenty of different flavors, which were easy to recognize; I could have a few more of these instead of the macro traditional stouts"
"This is much bigger than seems at first. Heavy and strong, but it doesn't come off that way in the beginning. Enjoyable, delicious, but hits hard when you least expect it."
"For US$2.50 per bottle though, I will probably seek out other more exciting beers instead. This beer comes nowhwere in competing with Stone's Imperial Baltic Porter for a similar price."
"Enjoy folks"
"Drinkability: Fairly decent imperial stout. Needs more body and character. Some wood character from a barrel or wood chips would make this brew a bit better; along with some additional malts to add to the body."
"Pours a deep black into my tulip glass. Dark brown head left plenty of lace. Moderate carbonation. The aroma was subdued choclate, roasted coffee, and sweet malts. Taste wasn't quite as overpowering as I expected. Very smooth and sweet with roasted coffee undertones. The body was a bit lighter than I expected. Finish was smooth and moderately sweet. The alcohol was masked by, but could be detected in the finish."
"Drinks adequate for style. As noted above a little sharpness that could use some smoothing out."
"Drinkability: A good sipper full of complex flavors. Based on quality and price point this is a no brainer. I imagine I will be getting more of this and probably throwing some in the cellar."
"D: This is one of my less favorite imperial stouts. But I do love imperial stouts, so it still rates fairly high. The alcohol is not masked at all by the rest of the flavors, leaving it much harsher than many better, similar beers. It simply lacks the smoothness and complexity of the better imperials."
"D- Great sipping beer on a cold night. Warms up the chest and drinks smooth with great flavor. Would definitely try again ."
"Pours pitch black with a dark brown head. Smell of coffee and taste of dark chocolate and alcohol. Just a slight burn. In my opinion an average stout for an average brewery. I haven't been able to find anything from Sam Adams that wow's me but hopefully I will soon."
"The abv holds this back but still good for a couple of pints!"
"One of my favorites from the boys at Sam Adams. Pours up with a thick tan head, 2-3 fingers, with a black body. Very rich and thick mouth feel, creamy to taste, chocolate, coffee, with a bit of smoky aftertaste. Easy to drink, even with the high alcohol content, I could easily put down a 4. It's around for 8-10 bucks in a four pack, nicely priced for such a good beer."
"Drinkability could be a whole lot better if the alcohol wasn't so in my face. Other than that, this is a pretty solid RIS and reasonably priced. ($10 for the 4 pack)"
"Bottle from annual special pack. Very drak brown and and a disapearing three-eights of an inch head. aste that is integrated chocolate and coffee and that stops short of being astringent in bitterness. Good drinkability and satisfying.Better than average from the style."
"Overall: A very strong, dark, excellent brew, but it could use a little less anise, and a bit more coffee. It's a fascinating experience to try this if you've never tried it before, and it serves as a wonderful link to brewing history."
"D - Even with a almost two full years of age this one still had a touch of alcohol burn...a nice imperial stout to try especially being from Sam Adams and easy to get your hands on...but I wouldn't put it up there as needing to try this one...I enjoyed their other two beers from the Imperial Series a little better"
"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a little bit of dark fruit. A nice, complex aroma and better than I expected. The flavor is a mix of heavy roasted/charred malt, dark chocolate and some coffee. There is also a nice bit of cream flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Imperial Stout, easily the best beer from the Samuel Adams Imperial Series."
"Medium brown head of two fingers, settling down to a thin ring with little lace. Color is a 38 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of rich coffee, chocolate, black strap molasses. Taste is that of chocolate, chicory, coffee, burnt malt, walnut, and spices. Rich smooth body in my mouth, like heavy cream. Although it is a heavy beer, I could have a small amount in one setting. Good to share with friends."
"Pours an oily black body with a tan head that reminds me of chocolate milk. It has good retention and very nice lacing and decent carbonation. The smell is anise, rum, chocolate, some coffee and some alcohol. the taste is anise up front followed by some strong alcohol taste with some dark chocolate and coffee in the middle and finishes off with a rum like taste. This beer reminds me of Meyers Jamaican Dark Rum. The mouthfeel is sweet and sticky at first and than leaves the lips sticky and the mouth dry. This is pretty drinkable for a strong full bodied beer. A nice desert or last beer before going to bed type beer. Another winner from the largest craft beer company in the U.S.A."
"I think this would go best with a dessert, a nice ""last one of the night"" beer. Wouldn't be able to drink to many."
"A pretty tasty RIS, overall - the big ABV is AWOL as far as the flavour is concerned. Given the agreeably restrained chocolate goodness, matching this with a more sugary dessert would work nicely."
"I enjoyed BBC's imperial double bock as well and this goes right there with that as one of their best. Out of their Imperial Series, this is their second best right behind their double bock."
"Verdict: Not that great. For me, a one time beer. B- (3.45)"
"This beer is dark rich and sexy there is a nice darker tan foam. There is a pretty strong booze smell to this beer that is almost off putting in general. The taste of this beer is chocolate and some whiskey notes. In general it's pretty nice for an impy stout. It's still a bit on the hot side as far as mouthfeel goes, but I would say there some good drinkability going on with this beer."
"Drinkability: It's definitely solid and would make for a great dessert beer on its own or accompanying food; ABV is a bit high for too much and the sweetness and weight would likely feel too heavy after a bit, but it's a good offering. It's interesting how much deviation there is between the high and low scores with this one. After reading some of the negative reviews I have to wonder if the BAs had bad bottles or something, because my experience was really only positive."
"Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"highly recommended!"
"D- Definitely a sipper. Intense and complex. Delicious and roasty. Very smooth and enjoyable, but take it very slow. Slight booziness and intense flavors make it one you have to sip."
"Notes - would be dissapointed if I had to pay more than $3 a bottle."
"at 9.2% abv this drink much like a lower stout. it has a lot of flavors that mask the high alcohol well. This is an amazing stout. If people would look past BBC trending the big companies like A B and Coors, they would realize that jim Koch runs an amazing brewery. Beers like this make me proud to know i drink craft beer and avoid anything marketed to me. Jim I would salute you for making the United states realize what good beer tastes like!"
"You know I really love this beer. The alcohol really snuck up on me, but you know what, I would really love to have this brew again. Thank you Sam Adams. Thank you."
"Flavor wise its alot more of the same, and no detectable alcohol, its very thick and viscous, rich and creamy. It finishes with a roasted coffee aftertaste. It doesn't even matter what temperature this is, its always smooth and creamy with low carbonation; as it warms it gets even better. There is nothing very unique about this brew but its just a solid imperial stout."
"Going into this beer, I didn't expect to be as impressed with it as I am. Really solid taste, and overall just a great Russian Imperial Stout. The high ABV and richness would prevent me from drinking too many, but as far as the taste and body is concerned, this is a fine drinking stout. I'd definitely recommend trying this."
"D: For the style this is a decent beer and worth picking up. I've found it as a good introduction to the Russian Imperial Stout style for those not accustomed. This isn't high enough to be my ""go to"" for RIS."
"Very dark brown liquid that is accompanied by a brown thick head. Scattered remnants on the glass from the head and the film from the beer. Smell is sweeter then most stouts, but a shocking sour kick. Scents of molasses, brown sugar and sour grapes. The grapes almost give it a wine after taste. Flavor is very sugary and sweet. Has a hint of smoked hops that is followed up as the final flavor of grapes. Medium/Full bodied beer that is smooth going down and leaves a slight trail. That trail makes you urn for more. Isn't hard to finish the glass."
"Typical look for a stout, smells of malasses, roasted malt, and something sour. The taste follows the smell, very intense flavor hits you immediately. I didn't care for it at all, like sour molasses and bad coffee mix into a very tough to drink concoction. I've only had a few other Imperial/Double stouts, so maybe its the type. At the end of the beer it was going down a little better. A beer needs to be more than just complex, it needs to taste good. I won't be enjoying this one again."
"I remember trying this when it had just been released, but I can't for the life of me remember what I thought of it. As such, I figured I'd give it another go and put my thoughts down. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted wheat, buttery toffee, and wet cardboard. Hmm. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, chocolate, light molasses, and, near the end, a strange melange of sharp char, alcohol, and coffee. When this last wave hits, things go from good to not-so-much, ruining the experience entirely. The body is fairly hefty, with a very light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, this one misses the mark a bit."
"A surprisingly very smooth beer and greatly crafted by true artisans. This was a very unexpected surprise ."
"Pours a pitch black color with a light brown head. Nice lacing. Smells of chocolate and coffe with some hop and malt sweetness. Tastes like the smell with a velvet mouthfeel. Drinkability is high. I have had this beer before and it is a fine example of an imperiel stout. Not harsh but instead a good beer to bring someone into imperiels"
"Drinkability: Thankfully this was given to me. It's a decent brew, but there are definitely better imperial stouts out there (at least one)."
"Drinkability is very good. Yeah, it's a big imperial stout, but Sam Adams has given it a unique flair that is eminently drinkable and really rather affordable. An excellent brew to drink, thanks to a well-done flavor profile that masks alcohol quite well. Will definitely have to pick up more to keep on hand. Bravo, Sam Adams."
"D- A nice, readily available imp stout. In a perfrect world, it wouldn't be my first choice, but definitely not my last."
"D: Very good. Better than I expected considering I was at the grocery store, wanted an Imperial Stout and this was my option. Its more chocolatey than a lot of ImpS and has some bite to it. Definitely a worthwhile diaper run."
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down smooth and tastes good. I think this is a very good beer for winter. I'm glad I got the chance to pick this up. It's better than I thought it would be"
"Drinkability- I was in the mood for a dark, creamy stout, and this beer failed to deliver. I'm so dissapointed, I might not finish this one."
"D: A well crafted stout which will be easy to finish off if this is the first or only rich beer of your night. I recommend drinking only before having drank any other rich beer; I only say this because I had trouble finishing this beer the other night after I had previously drank a 22oz. of a rich, chocolate stout. However, tonight (a completely different night), the Sam Adams Imperial Stout was my first beer of the night and I found it was gone before I had known it!"
"Low head retention, but that's OK, the rest of the beer looks great. Dark, opaque beer, brown head. good carbonation. It may be the ABV preventing the head from holding. Smells of chocolate, roasted barley and other dark caramel malts. notes of bread and molasses. I immediately notice the very full mouthfeel. Thick but not syrupy. Crisp ending, smooth sip, boozy but not scorching. I feel like I detect some flavors of oak or vanilla. I would be happy with a pint, or a 4 oz sampler. I'm impressed. Good beer."
"Drinkability - After a couple it becomes difficult to drink."
"A very solid, classic imperial stout. Dark brown appearance with fairly light carbonation. Nicely balanced roastiness with chocolatey/malty sweetness. Full-bodied mouthfeel without being too syrupy. A good deal, I think."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer but there are several in the style that I would choose before this one."
"picked up a 4 back while in boston and poured into a small hotel glass. poured a silky black with a nice creamy off-white head. didn't leave much lacing. smelled of deep chocolatey and roasted malts. smells rich and full. falls a bit short on flavor though. surprisingly thin and lacking in flavor and substance. has an almost caffeine-like fizziness to it. pretty weak for a RIS which is usually a flavor monster."
"If it wasn't for the alcohol this would be a good beer."
"12oz bottle. Dark brown hue with a small brown head. Lots of lacing. Looked like espresso in a tulip. Aroma of dark fruits, dark chocolate, yeast and brown sugar. Body is lighter than other Imperials, creamy and slightly tangy. Dark fruit, chocolate, espresso, and molasses flavors are nicely balanced on the palate. Long, complex finish. Not the best Imperial, but still very good."
"Pours a rich black, has a brown head, leaves lacing on the glass. Smell and flavor is mostly roasted, noticeably bitter but not overwhelmingly. Has hints of dark chocolate, coffee, slightly sweet. I noticed the alcohol taste upfront in this beer. That makes the drinkability less than a lower-ABV beer, but it's a good sipping beer to pair with food. A pretty nice Imperial Stout, but not better than others like Old Rasputin and Storm King. This would be a good intro to Imperial Stouts for a new craft beer drinker."
"This beer pours a thick black color. No light coming through the beer when held up to the light. The head is tan almost brownish. The beer smells of alcohol and roasted malts. The flavor is alcoholic, and yet smooth. The roasted malt shines through, kind of tasting like coffee, but more of a roasted malt flavor. The mouthfeel is thick. As for drinkability, I would consider this a sipping beer."
"Fairly average imperial stout. A little thin, and dull for flavor. Drinkability is pretty middle of the road as well."
"Imperial indeed."
"D - the 9.2% ABV is the only thing that'll stop me from having more of a couple. Other than that, this one is a winner. And who can beat $9.99?? Awesome!"
"Overall: An pretty impressive offering from Samuel Adams. A huge bodied tasty Imperial of a stout. Very dessert like and a sipper for sure."
"A nice stout, although I wasn't thrilled by the metallic element in the finish and the overall balance was a little sweet. I'd have it again, but there are other low-priced imperial stouts that I enjoyed more (Old Rasputin, Storm King, Ten Fidy, Stone)."
"D - Well I wanted to try this and I did. I really didn't think it was the worst RIS. But it definitely needed less of an ABV bite or more coffee to balance the burn. Still pretty decent."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. In the aroma, roasty coffee and a small hint of alcohol. In the taste, a nice roasty malt and coffee presence with just a hint of a dry alcohol in the end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and small roastiness in the aftertaste. Thin body, nice alcohol presence, but everything seems to be line, the taste, smell and aftertaste is all the same."
"i really enjoyed this one"
"D - Not a good brew, and unlike the Imperial White in Sam's series, you can tell this one comes from Sam Adams. While that's not a bad thing obviously, this beer tastes predictable and could definitely benefit from being, well, stoutier. It could be thicker and more robust. The fruitiness is fine with me, but the chocolate/coffee flavors should be buffed up. On another level, this is about as long as I've ever taken to finish a beer...this shit's gross and hard to drink. Doesn't taste good, ingredients are cheap, and there's no reason why the alcohol has to be so unpleasant in this. A pretty awful brew."
"Overall, definitely worth a try"
"Not bad, actually quite a bit better than I was expecting even, this definitely hits the Imperial Stout mark for me. This should actually age quite well and I wouldn't mind aging this for a year or ten to see how it develops. It does seem like it could use some more firm, biting, hop bitterness, which also would help it age."
"Pours black with a very thin mocha head. Nose brings forward roasted malt, dark chocolate, a bit of coffee, dark fruits, some peat, and a large dose of black licorice. Taste has some roasted malt and some of the characteristics of the nose, but this is just dominated by anise in a way that is somewhat unpalatable. Feel is fairly heavy with low carbonation. Drinkability is severely affected by the one flavor that really takes everything else out of the game."
"D - This is a one and done type beer. Would make a nice dessert."
"Overall: A thick stout that feels more like a porter or smoke beer rather than a stout. It is very strong and potent. I'm hoping this brew was just off, because I didn't taste chocolate, coffee, or anise. The smoke was very strong."
"Cheers!"
"Flavors linger long after every sip. This is a great imperial stout. I really enjoyed this, the complexities and bold notes really came out the longer the glass sat."
"A good english stout but an average American stout. Too pricey for what this is."
"Overall - This is a decent RIS, but falls short of Old Rasputin, Ten Fidy, and Stone RIS IMHO. It's worth trying if you're a fan of imperial stouts though."
"D: Well, your mileage on this score will vary depending on how drunk you like to get. Something about this beer makes you feel a little giddy after even one, and while the flavors are assertive and have a modicum of depth, though the chocolate is definitely at the forefront. As such, this brew is a great after-dinner drink and would likely pair well with anything that you might serve with mole."
"Definately not recommended."
"D - It's a +9% ABV RIS, so you're not chugging these on the lawn mower..."
"Yet another exemplary beer from Jim Koch! And another must-have Russian Imperial Stout to add to my list."
"2 steps down from some other stouts I have had, and I consider myself a stout novice."
"Overall: I liked this imperial stout quite a bit. Has some different qualities than others I've had but worth a try."
"Overall, not a very complex RIS. This one is drank best when I don't want to have to think about my beer too much -- like when studying for anatomy. Probably one of Sam Adams's stronger showings and definitely my favorite beer by them. Despite the C+ rating, I really do enjoy this beer. It just doesn't blow me away. A solid slightly above average showing."
"Pours an oily pitch black with a thin dark brown head. Consistency of motor oil, very nice. Smell is a bit boozy, some charred wood and earth. Taste is sweet licorice up front, with a oak middle, and an earthy, mollassas finish. Quite sweet for an American RIS. Mouthfeel is super rich, nice low carbonation. Pretty good drinkability. Understandably this beer is a sipper, meant to be savored over an hour or two's time."
"Wow, I really like the taste. Right off the bat you get with the sweet chocolate malt which then deepens into a smokey taste. Surprisngly this beer was not too heavy even with the dark malts used to brew it. I really enjoyed this beer."
"age has done this beer wonders, i wish i had more than this one bottle in my basement. when drinking this fresh, a year and a half ago, i would have seen it as kind of an average stout, a little alcholic. but now, its up there. maybe not as good as some of the real great stouts, but pretty damn close. i highly recommend you age this beer if you can."
"Nice Imperial Stout, one of the better beers, if not the best that I've had from Sam Adams."
"drinkability: If you can get by the carbonation, the relatively low ABV (9.2% on the bottle) and slightly thin mouthfeel could make this imperial stout more repeatably drinkable than most. Not a bad showing by Sam Adams."
"EDIT 9 October 2012: Maybe better than my original bottle. Still lots of licorice, etc., but less meat. The mouthfeel is marginally better. (This bottle is rather warmed up, so perhaps herein lies the difference. I might bump the Overall up to a four, but otherwise I stand by my initial review."
"D - Due to the thickness and alcohol preeminence: One at a time, my friend. Take this one easy..."
"D - This is a decent RIS with a lot of flavor and character. It follows more truly to the English version of the style in nature. This is my favorite of the Sam Adams imperial series and one of my favorite Sam Adams brews. While it might not be as assertive in some aspects as some of the smaller breweries, I think this beer will open the door for a lot of people - and I think it is quite enjoyable for those that have already stepped through that door."
"Would have to be in the just right mood for this one. I don't know when that would be, as I rarely go to the candy store looking for black licorice. That there is a sense of booze/ABV coming through isn't helpful, either. That said, there are some excellent foundational elements here that are just lurking but the carpet bombing with anise sinks the prospects."
"Notes-I'm sorry to say this is going to be my first F and I'm sorry again to say that it's a Sam Adams. Sam, I have absolutely no idea what you were going for with this beer but whatever it was you failed at it. This is nasty."
"Absolutely one of the best stouts from the U.S. This is a very heady, dark, but smoothe as can be dark, dark stout. 9.2% ABV with a low ABV taste. When poured from the glass, beer is very foamy, but sttles in quickly and is smoothe to drink. leaves little to no after taste in your mouth after drinking. Well worth the price!"
"Jet black body, no hues come through when held to the light. Tiny brown head. Great chocolate malt nose. Huge and complex taste. Big chocolate malt, some roast and burnt notes. Spice from the alcohol. Some oakyness. Full mouth brew. Pretty good imperial."
"D - This has all the elements you'd expect from Imperial Stout but it hits you in the face with them without a hint of balance or subtlety. Not my cup of tea."
"The brew has plenty of carbonation and is creamy in the middle. Due to the chocolaty sweetness in the end, this brew leaves the palate nicely wet, and still has a bout of alcohol warmness."
"D- rich and easy to drink, just love it"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Nice, not exactly my favorite, but drinkable and full of flavor. It's a bit too sweet for me, but it's a fairly unique take on the RIS."
"D: I remember when I first had this, I was underwhelmed. After a little time, this one seems to have taken on a bolder character with lots of sweet notes. Not a big fan of the sweet flavors, but this is a solid imperial stout."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer overall, but when I want an RIS, I want something more. Although this is a pretty accessible and inexpensive beer, Old Rasputin can be had for the same price."
"Drinkability: A decent stout and another good offering from Sam Adams. Definitely worth a shot."
"cheers!"
"D: Overall its very drinkable. I feel like I could easily polish of another bottle fairly quickly. Flavor-wise though, I would probably reach for something else for my 2nd beer. Not because this beer was bad my any means, but theres just a lot goin on with this and makes me think my taste buds need a change."
"Drinkability: It is not in my top ten. A little more of a task than an enjoyment."
"[Drinkability]: It's average."
"D: Good beer to slowly savor. The alcohol does not overpower you like some that I have had. Not top of the class, but when you are looking for something a bit different."
"Final Notes: An absolute treat to the taste buds. Would appeal to those who don't really enjoy stouts that much due to the really fruity flavor. This is a great dessert beer or paired beside a nice dessert. Would also make a nice beer to warm you up by the campfire in wintertime."
"booziness is apparent throughout. i like a booze kick to add to the flavors of an Imperial Stout, but this is just a bit too dominant in an otherwise solid brew."
"Overall, a great brew from the Boston Beer Company. Stouts are one of my favorites and this one was great. I look forward to trying SA's two other imperial beers - Imperial White and Double Bock. If you like stout beers, give this one a try, it'll be one you may like."
"I really wanted to like this but the taste ruined it. Maybe its better after being cellared for a while?"
"Samuel Adams Imperial Stout is now available in the state of Iowa. That's fine and dandy, but Double Bock will get most of my Imperial Series dollars and Imperial White will get the rest. The brewery probably won't do it, but a minor overhaul is in order."
"I'm more of a fan of the hop forward ISes, but this is a nice sweeter version. I'd much rather drink this than DFH WWS or any other that are just trying too hard."
"D - Certainly big, bold flavors here, but I think the sweetness makes this a one and done."
"Still a very very good offering from the Boston Beer Co. but I feel it fell a little short of potential. Just a little though, and I'd definitely grab another sometime."
"Had a bottle of this last fall. The colour was jet black with a thick head. The aroma was that of sweet roasted malt, treacleand soy sauce. On the palate, it was frothy and viscous with mocha, dark hot chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow cream with bitter edges and a long, creamy finish."
"A very solid black color with a small toffee head that stays and leaves lacing. Nose is dark chocolate, liquorish, coffee, toffee, and alcohol. The taste is heavy on dark chocolate, with a nice bit of liquorish and coffee. Slight alcohol bite as it goes down, but not as much as you would expect from such a high alcohol beer. Very rich and full flavored. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Very drinkable beer, overall an outstanding brew."
"pours a almost jet black color with spare light brown head and fair lacing. soft carbonation. Smells of coffee, and probably some dark chocolate, the taste is very much the same. finish is slightly bitter. full body, pretty heavy and malty. very filling. good stout but not great. wouldn't go out of my way to drink another."
"The soy sauce flavor lingered a little too long for me to the point I thought I might have a bad one. It settled down after awhile and brought out the other flavors but I think I'll let the other 2 I have sit for awhile. All in all, a pretty straight-forward imperial but nowhere near as interesting as SA imp white or doppelbock."
"Im no expert at reviews but this is an Imperial Stout worth a try. You might like it better than me, but I surely do not dislike this. Despite having a lower ABV compared to some of the bigger stouts, this beer made me buzzed a lot faster than I expected."
"D: A solid interpretation of the style by SA, this beer presents moderate presentability, good complexity, and a nice feel. It loses points because of a booziness that is too apparent and aggressive in the taste, smell, and feel. Still, worth trying though if you're into a little bit more heat in your beer."
"hot. Could be great after a year."
"Not my go to strong stout, but very tasty, I'd drink this beer again."
"Wow, certainly not your dinner brew. Thick, black, not very carbonated, smooth feel. I got a fairly thin head off an average poor. Extremely malty with heavy coffee and chocolate flavors. Strong though, some alcohol from the 9.2%, mild hoppiness did not distract. This is a power malt brew. I took about 30 minutes or so to work through my glass, and loved going back and breathing in the aroma. Truly a very nice evening brew, but certainly not for the faint of heart. What's funny is that when I tried Guinness Extra Stout this is what I was looking for, bold, malty, thick, smooth"
"D: Very, very nice... a little disappointed in the aroma, but otherwise dangerously drinkable."
"Medium to heavy bodied, with a decent mouthfeel that coats the mouth. Would like it to be a bit heavier, but not bad at all. The beer gets much better as it warms, with the carbonation dying down just a bit and the coffee becoming a bit more noticeable. I would recommend letting it warm a bit before even starting to drink it."
"It's not complicated for the style, but that's also a welcome change. I consider this quite easy to drink and I'm glad it's not cloying or sweet either. Another solid year round RIS choice."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. A sipper and honestly I could probably drink a couple of these in a sitting if in the right mood. A easier imperial stout to drink compared to others in my opinion. Slight alcohol warming which again makes it a great sipper on a cold night. I will be saving at least one of these to age and see how it is in about a year. Cheers!"
"There are better Russian Imperials on the market, and there are better SA brews out there than this. If you're looking for something different in a RIS, you can give this a shot."
"This is a delicious and enjoyable stout in the Russian imperial style."
"Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Deep, dark brown, nearly black with a brownish golden head that dissipates quickly and leaves very little trace on the glass. Aromas are of dark fruit and roasted malts, however not as distinct and complex in smell as desired. Taste is similar, good, but not very defined as the best can be, regardless of flavor. Feel is good, with a light carbonation and some alcohol warming. Overall a good introduction to the style and appropriate to the style, but not quite as distinct in aroma and flavor as the best."
"Overall, this was a really good imperial stout, but not the best I've ever had. Definitely worth a try when you see it."
"This beer gets better as it warms. The body seems a little weak for an imperial stout, however it's a rather drinkable version of the style."
"I knew Sam Adams was making some great beers, but with this they hit a home run. This is an awesome beer, lots of roast, chocolate, nice bitterness, the abv hidden well, it's amazing. I need to get some to age."
"D - Not bad but I wouldn't get this again. 3.5"
"D: This was boozy and bitter when I first bought this but it's really toned down both of those characteristics. Put a 4pack in your cellar and let it sit for about a year and it will reward you."
"Even though I wouldn't rate this as one of my top choices, I consider this beer worth the pour. I will surely drink more in the future, especially as my palate evolves."
"D: This is definitely a sippin beer, a very good example of a RIS. An excellent bargain, high quality and readily available for a reasonable price. Highly recommended, way to go Sam Adams."
"D- Reasonably smooth. It would be quaffable if it weren't for the booziness. Drinkability went down as the beer warmed and the booziness increased."
"Overall Impression: Samual Adams has created an excellent Russian Imperial Stout. It's one of my favorite Imperial Stouts not aged in a barrel. I just LOVE toffee!!! This one should age very well. Highly recommended!!! This one is not for the meek though."
"Drinkability is good with this one. Definitely a sipper, but worth keeping around - particularly when there is a nip in the air."
"Overall, not a bad offering from Sam Adams, but a bit middle-of-the-road as far as RIS's go"
"D- Drinks nicely, smooth, dunno if I would buy it again but I liked trying it."
"Overall a decent beer. Nothing I would pick up again."
"Overall, about what I expected from Sam Adams. A solid, simple, and consistent Imperial Stout. It won't turn any heads, but it's still a good beer."
"Mmmm, goood beer. Poured with a decent fine foamy tan head and good lace. Color is an opaque dark brownish black. Aroma is like they say - dark malt, cocoa, coffee, licorice, roasty. Flavor's about the same just more of it. Great body and carbonation. Finish is a little more roasty, which I like. Don't really pick up the alcohol too much. Really good beer. Alllmost a session."
"Full, flavorful, and smooth, this RIS makes for a good drinker if you're careful of the alcohol. Overall, this is a really solid beer from the Boston Beer company and provides an easy sipper for a wintry evening."
"All in all, I tell ya, Sam Adams is one of the best mainstream brew. This stout is a perfect example. This is a very good stout that can most definitely compete with some craft brews. I was totally taken by surprise by this one. Very good, try it."
"It is pleasant, and easy to drink, but very far from being a really good imperial stout. A slightly above average regular stout."
"A stout black pour with a small short lasting soapy tan head , light carbonation with sone jagged lacing left behind . Aroma is of coffee , anise , and coco powder and roasty malt. Flavor is on the light side for an Imp Stout . Lots of roasted barley , coffee and a little chocolate , a slight boozyness in the roasty finish , lightly sweet with an "" ok "" bitterness , light body for the style , oily thin mouthfeel . I would call this drinkable and good, sessionable for the style, ( I found nothing wrong with this) but probably not something I would buy again due to having many local Imp Stouts that are much better , thanks for the Stout Sam"
"Drinkability is superb for a stout, or any beer for that matter."
"Medium-to-full bodied, light effrevescence, relatively smooth. Very good stuff."
"Medium-full body. Appropriately carbonated. Fairly smooth drinker. Very solid effort from Sam Adams."
"Very tasty, moderately complex and well balanced. An impressive offering from Sam Adams. I'd pick this up again."
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. I have tried it many times and will buy again. Its definately worth a shot if you are a fan of stouts."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very very dark opaque brown, almost black. Head was a froth, started as 2 fingers, ended up leaving a small layer on the top and clinging well to the sides. Aroma was slightly sweet, burnt sugar, with some molasses undertones. Taste was smooth, but had a surprising kick. Bit of sweetness to start, but finished with some acidic bitterness. Started off smooth and rich in the mouth, coated very well. Carbonation was dead on, not detracting, but present enough to be noticed. A solid stout, and was drinkable, but nothing outstanding."
"I have meant to give this brew a try for the past ¾ of a year but had not. So picked up some this weekend for a try. Beer poured to a dark black color with a real large dark tan head that had fantastic retention and lacing. The aroma is of dark malts, deeply roasted and burnt, chocolate, some dark fruit and then a slight alcohol scent. The flavor has a sweeter feel and less astringent than I was expecting. Also noticeable is dark fruit, chocolate and possibly molasses. Slight hop presence but seems to get lost with the other flavors, which is not a bad thing. Finish is slightly alcoholic, though that flavor mixes extremely well. Quite easy drinking which I suppose is a little scary. Nice brew, will have to try the others in the series."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Very heavy beer but balanced with a light carbonation that really tickles the tongue. Very good rendition of this style, hearty and filling."
"D-this hides the alcohol very well and has a great taste, hits the style right on. not as big as some of the monster, but for a macro, damn good!"
"D: Very good. This bottle has been sitting, forgotten, in the back of my fridge since the first week it came out. I think sitting for the better part of a year did this beer good."
"Cheers!"
"This isnt my favorite version of the style but its decent. Worth a try."
"I find this Imperial Stout to be very well balanced. It is very sweet and creamy for such a style but it is certainly less abrasive and yeasty than others that I've tried. It's very delicious and very drinkable. $10 for a 4-pack would definitely not be wasted!"
"This is a very interesting stout. It took me by surprise initially, but now that I'm nearing the end of it, I realize that I'd like to have another one, or two. That, to me, says that it's pretty drinkable."
"D- Nothing really special here. Nothing to avoid. This seems to be the way many of Sam Adam's beers are. They seems to be playing it safe with nearly all of their beers."
"My only critique of this beer is it is a little too sweet. It needs a significant dose of bitterness, either from hops or roasted malts. It has a longgg finish that needs to end a minute or two before it does."
"D - Unfortunately I think the alcohol shines through a bit too much, so I can't grant this a high drinkability. I understand it's imperial, but in my interpretation, that means there's a lot more malted flavor too. It just isn't the case with this one."
"I was thoroughly impressed by SA on this beer. Only got a single, will try to hunt down more and age one or two."
"Overall- i'm not a huge raison fan so that comming out of this beer doesn't help. there was nothing at the store that really stood out so i had to try this. not to disappointed tho. i say give it a shot."
"Overall - Unfortunately the appearance and the mouthfeel can't make up for the aroma or taste of this beer. I guess I set my hopes too high, but this one is really bad."
"Certainly a sipper, with a big, intriguing aroma and an equally big flavor. Drinkability is hindered all around by big flavors and big boozy warmth; this isn't the most remarkable Imperial Stout out there, but it certainly has character. Very nice."
"I enjoy what SA has done with this style of beer, it has a very roasted dark malt characteristic, a noticeable alcohol content, and most importantly warms and fills for the bitter cold winter weather."
"It has a mad thick chocolaty head. It has very dark, fuzzy body that is also very thick. Awesome lace. I have to say this is a great looking beer. It has a good milk chocolate and caramel flavor with just the right amount of bitterness to balance things out. A little warming with a mild alcohol flavor."
"The mouthfeel is very nice, the beer is well carbonated and has a nice heavy body. The alcohol is present throughout the beer, but it adds rather than detracts for the most part, and leaves a nice warm feeling in the stomach. Definitely a nice find for the price on this one, and I will certainly revisit it."
"overall: Not shockingly good, but more than I expected from SA. Not because they're always bad, but they don't always put their name on great products."
"D: A very drinkable RIS with no flaws but no distinctive elements either. Readily available and no corners cut here -- great quality like always from SA."
"Aroma is crisp, malty and smoky with a hint of molasses. It pours an opaque dark brown like dark chocolate with a decent light tan head. Flavor is smoky and malty with an undertone of molasses and hints of mocha and caramel; however, it does not seem all that well-rounded. Texture is smooth and tingly, though not as thick or heavy as most stouts I have tried. Overall, it is OK if not outstanding."
"in soviet Russia, Imperial Stout drinks you!"
"D - I could put a few of these back easily"
"D-This is a decent effort at the style, but one is enough for me."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small dirty brown foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of black chocolate and dry roasted malt with light bitter notes is not all that bad. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some balanced roasted malt with lingering sweetness and some medium sweet black chocolate. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well made with no flaws thought doesn't really stand out from the pack."
"Dark fruit of plum and raisin in the aroma, and I can detect some anise under the sheets. Thick and gooey quaff of burnt toast and deep roasted malt, only drawback is bit of woody resin in the finish. Has a kick of alcohol burn, even with the 12oz bottles, they could use a year of rest. Still, for $10 you get 2 bombers worth of high octane beer with a fine quality to them."
"D: A good offering from Sam Adams, I can never turn down free beer!"
"Value: C"
"Sam's Imperial Stout poured a pitch black with a thick carmel colored head. It presented a nice faint coffee and chocolate. Just a little alcohol nose, but not too much like some Imperials. It had a smooth feel and very balanced taste. Not too strong but not weak. A very good Imperial Stout. So far Sam Adams Imperial series ahs not dissapointed."
"Looks like motor oil, good for social lubrication. Aroma is of coffee and chocolate, with alcohol notes spread throughout. Tastes like a cup of iced coffee (without the ice) and a lot of alcohol. Chocolate and caramel notes are found within the coffee flavor. A little bit bitter, smooth with a nice finish."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, black and roasted malt scent with some chocolate notes. Alcohol is present in the nose. The taste is decent. It has a rich, malty flavor that boasts of warm alcohol and black malts. It's easy drinking for 9+%abv. It does lack the hop character of a RIS. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It's easy drinking, but it's a bit lacking compared to similar offerings from other breweries."
"And that's the bottom line, this is quite enjoyable."
"this is a straight laced imperial stout with no frills attached. the bottles have no freshness dating and the neck labels are blank. i'm not sure if this would be a candidate for cellaring or not but it probably wouldn't hurt to lay a few down to see what happens. i would hope it would get better and develop some more character than it has now."
"Notes: Much better alternatives on the market."
"Pours black with cinnamon head. Aroma of milk chocolate, slight roast, raisins and prunes. Flavors of chocolate, espresso with cream, alcohol, slight roast toward the finish but then the palate gets blind-sided by sweet sugar. Heavy bodied brew but not as heavy as most imperial stouts. A sweet drinkability comes from this beer and remains throughout. A good stout but not a great one."
"drinkability: a solid stout and i would drink again."
"I've had some imperial stouts off the beaten path and enjoyed them - but this isn't one of them. It's not an awful beer, but I won't be trying it again."
"Night of the dark beers the weather outside is right for the beers I'm drinkin'. I've been meaning to try this since the release, I finally found it at a bottle shop. Pours pitch black body with a beige khaki head that really fades pretty quickly this maybe one of the biggest beers from Sam Adams I've had. Minimal speckled lacing on the sides of my glass poured into my Piraat chalice. Aroma strong fruit smell tart cherries or grapes come to mind off the bat, maybe a bit of plum or raisin on 2nd sniftt. Dark beer characteristics are here with a bit of dark chocolate accent. Flavor is kind of a mess, there's a big wave of fruit and tart sourdough bread that clashes from the first sip onward. Not much coffee or espresso just a bitter black patent malt force that jolts the back of the throat with the tart/sour fruit tone and alcohol burn. Not much cohesion or finesse in this bruting style from Sam Adams, kind of a shame. Mouthfeel doesn't hit right at all sits thin and cloying on my palate, nasty over ripened fruit note sits like it's spoiled almost induces a gag reflux. Burn of alcohol just adds to the trainwreck at hand. Stick to the traditional low alcohol styles that got you where you are. I used to like the Double Bock I haven't tried the new version, and I couldn't really stomach the Double White so far these two failures are pretty much strike outs in my book. Disgusting I'm pouring the rest out I haven't done a drain pour in a hell of a long time we're about due especially with this beer at the helm, lousy version of a great style."
"Mouthfeel: Thick and coats the mouth. Very good for the style."
"D: heavy, occasional"
"D - Definitely a sipper and I plan to consume it that way but it's nicely crafted. The malts seem just a bit too roasted for me but there are enough other flavors to occupy the palate elsewhere."
"D_Not bad not good somewhere in the middle."
"A very nice sipper, well placed in between sugar bombs like Dark Lord and dry/bitters like Founders."
"I think out of Sam Adam's imperial series I like this the best. Poured a nice thick tan head and had excellent lacing. Black as night in color. Silky smooth going in with strong hints of chocolate and coffee; very sweet in taste. Perfect for a cold winter's night."
"Overall: Wow. Wow. And one more big Wow. By far one of the best Impy Stouts I've had so far. Maybe one of the better beers I've had in a long, long time. A bargin too. Samuel Adams hit it out of the park with this one. It also paired well with the homemade sweet carrot cake I made (not to mention that I added one of the beer into the mix)."
"Again, body and drinkability were typical. Overall, a beer worth trying, and one that won't give you any surprises, making it a good introduction to the style."
"D - An extremely thick beer. Not for the faint of heart. A slow-drinking beverage."
"pour is nice. dark with a health mocha head. nose of coffee and elmers glue protein. quite doughy. like unbaked bread. palate is mild acidic... not a very well placed malt character. weak coffee, chocolate and burnt... green orangepeel bitter acidic. will try again, but an older bottle."
"Medium to heavy body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol not too noticeable. This is actually a fairly complex RIS, though not quite as much so as many others. More than I expected from SA given this style, but they pulled it off nicely and have produced another solid offering. Great value, a nice sipper and I won't have any problem finishing the 4 pack."
"Notes: Overall, I'm impressed with this offering from Sam Adams. This is a great value, and a great beer and I look forward to the other offerings in the Imperial series!"
"D - This beer starts sweet and stays a little too sweet for the style. The drinkability ultimately suffers due to the prominence of the alcohol in the taste."
"Picked up a single at PHP in Brookline. Poured into a Great Divide Yeti glass. Dark black color. Not as much head as I was expecting. Smells a lot like dark roasted coffee. Taste actually was quite an accurate example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Bold flavors of dark chocolate, licorice, roasted barley and cocoa were right up front. Mouthfeel was a tad lighter than other examples of the style. Also, there seemed to be more of a sweetness to this beer than with others I had tried. I would have preferred it to be a bit more dry. I was not sure how Sam Adams' take on a RIS was going to be. But I feel that they were pretty authentic to the style and produced a quality stout."
"Poured a very deep brown with a respectable head that reduced to a thick, sustainable collar. The aroma was definitely chocolate. The taste was strong chocolate, a little coffee and a somewhat bitter after taste. The feel was full bodied with very little carbonation. Drinkability was reasonably good considering the high ABV. A very solid RIS, one that I would have again."
"Drinkability would be good. Kind of thick and a 12oz bottle would be plenty for one sitting. There isnt anything that pops out about this beer. Pretty predictable. This would be a good beer to have with a cigar as its very thick and has a bitter chocolate snap to it."
"Poured into a pint glass. Out of the bottle this beer certainly looks the part, and may have the darkest-colored head I've yet seen on an impy stout. Not much evidence of light getting through any of the glass' corners. The head does recede with a little too much haste. Aroma is more standard stout than imperial, which is much closer to my expectations with this beer. Big notes of coffee with artificial sweetener, graham crackers, some vague dark fruits, and a nip of fusel alcohol. Flavor has a solid roasty character but no real heft to it. Body is a little thin and so is the flavor profile; this could almost be mistaken for their cream stout if it wasn't for the alcohol, which isn't apparent in taste but is definitely felt in warmth. Some lesser chocolatey notes float around but this literally tastes like an imperial stout cut with water, right down to the watery aftertaste. Drinkability is high, satisfaction is not as high."
"M&D - this brew caught me way off guard, wasnt expecting much from SA on the RIS front and they made me a poor prognosticator,w ell brewed SA, smooth and warming, just enough alcohol for a cold winter, nice amalgam of sweetness and nutty malts, i will be getting more of this"
"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA pint glass. The pour is jet black, with a thin sticky black head. The nose is molases, dark fruit, and brown sugar. The flavor profile is pretty sweet. The primary flavors are molases, dark chocolate, figs and maybe a bit of anise. The beer is full bodied and is a bit high in carbonation for the style. I liked this one even though it is on the sweet side."
"i suspect this on was brewed with aging in mind"
"Mouth feel is not as ""thick"" as others but is pretty good. Drinkability is easy since it is not as strong as some others I have tried. Not a bad beer by any means. Actually a pretty good beer just up against some real stiff competition."
"Tastes like alcoholic burnt s'mores. Has a crusty graham cracker flavor with sweet marshmallow and Hershey's chocolate syrup thrown in. Some wood notes and a bit of roasty malt come out upon warming. There is a modest amount of bitter hoppiness and plenty of alcohol to help cut through the sweetness. This might round out to be something nice with a few years in the cellar, but it is a bit rough around the edges right now and drinks bigger than the 9.4% it is. Good, not great and a little better than I expected."
"Drinkability is good. I really enjoyed this beer, and glad to see that Boston Beer Company put out a high quality RIS. Cheers!"
"Very sticky in your mouth but still has a smoothness to it. Would really on do one of these a night. Great beer"
"Pours a deep, midnight black, with a dark coffee colored head. head dissipates quickly. Smells great with many sweet notes, including chocolate and some sort of dark fruit. A bit of cofee on the smell as well. taste starts off bitter coffee goes through a chocolate transition and then ends with a strong sweet fruit. A bit too sweet in fact. Can also taste the alcohol in this one. good mouthfeel, not too thin, but not thick either. A bit too sweet to be easy drinking, but it is an imperial. Overall, a little disapointed in this one, but its not a bad beer."
"D- Egh. I don't like this, and this is gonna be hard to finish. Looks good, smells awesome, but fails to deliver on the style. So far, this SA Imperial Series fails."
"drinkability is pretty good. doesn't hide its alcohol quite as well as the SA doppelbock we had before it, but still does a fairly good job. a nice impy."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, almost silky. Light bit of sourness, almost grainy, some warmth going down. A pretty nice RIS."
"(D)- Big sugar sweetness in front of a relatively simple body. Fine, but not great. The high sugar taste is really filling."
"D - Very drinkable for how thick it is, and considering the ABV, but it's a beer to be sipped and savored. Definitely not a beer to slam back or have later in the night if you can't appreciate the flavor."
"This 12-oz. bottle didn't last long."
"Very dry and bitter on the back end. Way too sour in the finish. Despite the nice viscous body, the sour mash component to the mouthfeel and finish are very unsavory and really detract a lot from the flavors."
"Bottle. Poured an average head, brown in color, that slowly dissipates leaving a thin covering. Excellent lacing. Black body with no light getting through. Smell is sweet with coffee and vanilla coming through. Flavor is slightly bitter with roasted malt flavors dominating and some dark fruit flavors showing through. Medium body. Overall a pretty decent brew."
"This is a very tasty Imperial Stout from the Boston Beer Co. Strong but lots of good flavors. I'd like to see what this one could be like a few years down the road."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is thick, coating, rich, and full. The body of the beer is heavy and thick and the finish is full. This is a very good beer from Sam Adams. I really enjoyed it."
"Great job on this one! For not ever seeing an imperial stout from SA, this is a pretty good shot!"
"D - Meh. Not a bad beer, but hardly worth the price of admission."
"A good offering from Samuel Adams. A great after dinner drink, or paired with an assortment of chocolates. I will buy this one again."
"Overall, delicious and amazing."
"D: This is a drinkable well-made stout. A big - but not overpowering beer."
"D: Definitely a very good Imperial stout to sip and enjoy."
"D-It goes down very smooth but there is a very noticable alcohol presence. I wouldn't say it's fusal though. I think it goes down very well for the style and abv. Very nice beer indeed."
"A nice imperial stout, spot on for the style. It has a certain Sam Adams quality-- slightly minerally, well-attenuated, and supple yet clean-- which I happen to like."
"Drinkability: This beer is too heavy to have more than one or two of. Its a great pint while it lasts, probably an hour unless you are a total alcoholic. However, it is dark and strong enough to suffice for 4 lesser beers imo."
"Nice to finally have an affordable RIS in Iowa. Not that I don't like Rogue's XS Stout, but for $16 I couldn't go there. This beer is a nice solid offering."
"D - Yummy, but I could see how it would get tiresome."
"I very much enjoyed this brew as a fine example for an Imperial Stout. It's not neccisarily sessionable at 9.2% with it's full body, but it's a great rep of the style IMHO. This Stout is a bit more on the roast/malty/coffee end of the spectrum more than the chocolate range for the style."
"A good imperial stout but there are better examples out there."
"MF&D - great! a cheap beer with a thick feel, and a great texture (feels almost like a un oily crude oil). I really think this guy has a great deal done right, and I wish all the mediocre breweries could get up to snuff on how to make a robitussin like beer, well, at least for this style"
"D - Sam Adams really came through on this one; this is a very drinkable and complex imperial stout. The malt character is great and has just the right combination of bitterness and dryness to keep it well balanced and very easy to sip. I'll be buying some of these to age, and I would love to see a barrel aged version."
"D-- Not bad. Needs more chocolate and maybe a touch of vanilla. Kind of feel like I am drinking a good coffee with cocoa in it. The licorice is an interesting twist but needs a bit more. Go get a Yeti and taste the difference. The ABV is there but it just lacks something in this that could set it apart from others. Gets very dull after a few sips."
"12 oz. bottle. This black liquer at 9% is potent yet restrained for an imperial. Good, with smooth flavor profile of mocha, cocoa, and roasted grain bill. A little boozy but not too much. Good mouthfeel and weight for a stout. I would drink these again on a heavy snowy day in the middle of January."
"overall a descent imperial stout."
"couldnt drink too many, id get a bit too goofy haha"
"D: Clearly the best of the Imperial Series and one of Sam Adams finest brews. All their beer used to have the complex, full flavor profile used to have, i guess it takes a special series to get that now."
"D - Much like most of their beers theres nothing groundbreaking happening here but its a good solid representation of the style its a little hotter than I would prefer but overall its a good beer thats worth the time and money to try"
"drinkability: in my opinion probably the easiest to drink of the sam adams imperial series. a good beer all around and a shining example of the imperial stout style."
"RB!"
"This one pours basically black with one finger of tan head. No light gets through. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Tastes a pleasant blend of coffee, chocolate, molasses. Not the most intense flavor I've had from a RIS, more middle of the road, but very respectable. The alcohol is well hidden. A bit heavy to drink much of this too fast, but as RIS's go, I can't complain."
"drinkability: big and bitter"
"pours out black from the bottle like very dirty motor oil, tan one finger head with a light lace as you sip it. smells of dark chocolate, strong coffee and alcohol. strong bold taste, smooth and creamy with roasted malt, sweet strong coffee, alcohol that warms you as it goes down and taste that lingers on after each sip. its not session but one or two would do just fine."
"another great beer from the boston brewing company. not the biggest, baddest RIS out there but it's a great brew and sticks to the style. im happy to give this delicious brew high marks. i will definately be picking up some more."
"Looks the part. ""Glugged"" into my tulip glass and created a nice tight brown head that leaves lots of lace as I drink. Great nose of black licorice, char, roasted malts, chocolate and dark fruits. Medium to medium-full body. I'd like to see a little more girth here. Lightly carbonated and some trace amounts of alcohol linger long after the sip. Flavor is solid, if not spectacular. Greasy flavor of anise oil and black coffee. Char and light cocoa come into the picture as well."
"D - Semi-drinkable, its not too bad for a stout but the bitter alcohol taste keeps it from being enjoyed over a long period of time."
"D: This is obviously a good brew but I think I can only handle one in a sitting. While this is a good example of an Imperial Stout I believe there are better options out there."
"D: I'm not a licorice person but I do like stouts. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer despite my handicap."
"This one pours a jet black and a fluffy brown head that lingers for a long while. Especially as it warms, a clear alcohol hotness (9% so that makes sense) confirmed by legs when tilted to the side; a very strong oakiness in the nose over top of sherry and dark fruits. Bitter chocolate, stale coffee and dark molasses invades the entire mouth and lingers with a bit of hop. An extremely smooth but uncompromising version of a Russian Imperial Stout. Looking at other reviews, many seasoned drinkers seem to like it better--the flavors are strong, but mostly balanced, but may turn off those who aren't accustomed to an RIS but giving the Sam Adams a try on recognition. Boston Brewing Company is kicking it up a notch with its Imperial series, and this is one not to be missed."
"D: Easy to drink. The alcohol does sneak up a bit. Overall this is a nice entry into the impy stout arena from a large brewer. It doesn't quite reach the level of Stone IRS or Old Rasputin, but I would definitely buy this again."
"Overall, it's a decent Russian Stout. Could be, probably should be, a bigger beer, with a more aggressive nose and better masking of the ABV. I was sort of spoiled by great Impies like Old Rasputin; if this was my first Imperial I'd have been impressed, though."
"Overall, a pretty darn good imperial stout."
"All kinds of flavor though. Lots of roastiness, malts and chocolates, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, all rolling around each other, nothing sticking out but working together. Very nice. And the mouth is smooth, very creamy, yet still well carbonated, not really any warmth. In fact, the alcohol content is barely registered anywhere. Quite well hidden. Which makes this, in sum, a very drinkable RIS. It was gone much too soon."
"This is big warming beer better suited for a cold winter night than a warm, late summer, evening. Very filling, I doubt I could do more than one at a sitting."
"Nevertheless it's certainly worth a try-- now if it's worth its price- is another question."
"This brew poured a deep, dark, black-ish color with very little head. The aroma is not typical for an imperial stout. (Perhaps it has more in common with a Baltic Porter?) Maybe or maybe not. The aroma is subdued for the style and leads me to believe it's something else other than an impy stout. The flavor is malty and clean. I like it, but it just doesn't taste like an imperial stout. In fact, it's quite smooth and mellow...tasting like some sort of rich, dark, malty lager. Who knows...this might actually be a lager? The strong roasty characteristics I associate with an imperial stout (or regular stout) are not up-front in this brew. This brew has a sweetness that overpowers everthing else. It is a clean-tasting (and enjoyable) sweetness, but this brew seems to be beyond anything I would normally associate with an imperial stout. In the end, I do like this beer quite a lot, but it doesn't taste like an impy stout."
"D - Solid offering from Sam Adams, very good example of style. Nothing spectacular here, but definitely a good one!"
"D: One beer per session is enough."
"Finally got around to trying this one.. wasn't a huge fan of the Imperial White but I love me some RIS's. Pours like engine oil with a nice tan head.. excellent. Smell is very roasty, but also very boozy... a little too strong in the nose for my liking. Taste wise, this is a pretty hoppy RIS, moreso than most. Nice roastiness to it too along with the complex chocolate, coffee flavor characteristics. Once again, that strong ABV is quite prevalent as you get quite the burn after each sip. Nice sipper beer, makes for a good night cap.. couldn't see having more than one in a sitting. Nice stab at an RIS and I like the sweetness but the alcohol taste needs to be toned down.. until then get me a Storm King, Ten Fidy, or Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout."
"This Imperial Stout is a good brew but based on price and expectation, I could name quite a few beers that are better in both taste and value."
"In conclusion this beer is of microbrew quality if not better and is well worth the price tag, enjoy today."
"The mouthfeel is okay, but this doesn't come together very well at all."
"Even mouthfeel, not too rich, moderate carbonation. Tasty beer, good sipper, not the best representaion of the style, but a good beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of brown head that settled into a brown skim on top. It is black. It smells of dark fruit, chocolate, and alcohol. Dark fruit dominates the taste with a hint of alcohol. It is followed by coffee in the aftertaste. The coffee becomes more apparent as it warms. It tastes like a Bell's Cherry Stout without the cherry. It is okay. I like imperial stouts, but this is not a favorite. It's better than a lot of beers, but it is mediocre for the style."
"This is a good example of the style. It is a tad bit to sweet for my liking - still very good, just more unexpected. This is a sipper, and is a nice brew to try here and now. The sweetness kind of put me off at first, but as I drink it I am enjoying it. A very solid brew, from a very solid brewery."
"Sam Adams can proud of this one as it holds its own among many other RIS's out there."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with an off white color head. The smell is of coffee and chocolate malts with anise laced throughout. The taste is of anise with chocolate and coffee notes. The alcohol is hidden very well. The mouthfeel is of light carbonation and very smooth. Drinkability is above average, good balance of flavor to alcohol."
"I've read some polarizing opinions on the Sam Adams Imperial Series, but I love most stouts so I thought ""Why not?"" I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a decent, middle-of-the-road RIS in my book.  To be honest, it won't hold a candle to the likes of Old Rasputin, GD's Yeti, Bell's Expedition or Stone's IRS.  It doesn't approach the same level of mind-blowing aromas, taste or complexity.  But, it's not a bad alternative either - the aromas and flavors are enjoyable, albeit rougher around the edges.  Some time in the cellar might be beneficial, particularly if it would mellow out the warming blast of alcohol while drawing out more nuanced complexities, especially with the anise and dark fruits."
"I could drink one or two of these a night, but certainly no more than that. It's good for what it is. Let's always keep that in perspective, shall we?"
"Mouthfeel isn't bad at all with a great degree of creaminess and soft carbonation setting the drinking up for a luxurious beverage...which can only be attained if it tastes good. The Double Bock was great, but the other two entrants into the Imperial series have been total let-downs. BBC should focus on their strength as the best large-scale brewer of lagers in the US."
"D: I enjoyed drinking it, and don't regret paying $7 for a 4-pack (on sale). But I'll be giving the rest to someone who enjoys sugar bombs."
"Samuel Adams Imperial Stout is an impenetratable black ale with a thick, dense, splotchy, muscovado colored head that's adorned with a smattering of oily bubbles. It leaves thick, doily-pattern lacing on the glass. There are chocolate, coffee and licorice in the aroma, with a slight molasses-like sweetness. There is alcohol in the nose and something earthy, like manure. It's full bodied and smooth with a clean, dry finish. It has a full, roasty malt flavor, slightly sweet, with chocolate and licorice notes. It's not very bitter and I can taste a little alcohol. It's very drinkable. This is what I'd describe as a ""Pennsylvania Impy""."
"Quite effervesent for a Stout, and a decent ABV is quite apparent. but for a 12oz it's easily consumable"
"drinkability is good. a lack of true drinkability is inherent to the RIS style, which contributes to a hit here, but as far as overall appreciation, this is an excellent RIS. full of black malt character and silky smooth on the palate, this one warms the stomach and leaves the palate satisfied. cheers!"
"Debated on what to pour this one into, ended up pouring it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Poured a black in the center, but on the edges you can see it's brown. Had a chocolate milk colored head with multiple sized bubbles that goes away about 1/2 way through the drink, slight lacing on the glass. Smells good, you can smell hints of chocolate and some roasted/burned malts. Tastes good, you can taste a bitter type chocolate taste with some burned malts tasted as well. Mouthfeel is good, pretty smooth, and no carbonation bite at all. Surprisingly drinkable for an Imperial Stout. Also I really like how this is in a 12oz bottle. Every once in awhile Im in the mood for a Russian Imperial Stout but don't really have the time in my schedule to sit and enjoy a 22oz bottle."
"D - Too thin and too much soy sauce as it warms."
"Poured opaque darkest brown with no light penetrating. Head dissipates to varying shades of lighter brown just sitting atop the surface. Scent is full of roasty malts, coffee, cocoa, and dried fruit. Taste is slightly less impressive than the aroma with bitter chocolate, prune, licorice, and alcohol coming through. As you'd expect this one has a substantial body and coating mouthfeel. This one is good, worth trying, but not one to leave a lasting impression."
"D: It sips pretty easily, though the intense complexity really lends it well to just that--slow sipping. A great effort by Sam Adams, probably one of the best beers they brew."
"Don't drink and review."
"D - Gets better as you go along. The first taste caught me off guard and took getting used to. Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, and bitter."
"D - This is a good beer from a good brewer. Sam Adams never really does anything super-stellar, but they do almost everything they do quite well. I've always thought of brewers like DFH or Rouge to be innovators and arteeests, while Sam Adams is like that musician or band that never really has a hit but has been around forever and just writes damn good songs. This is a beer worth drinking, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to pick up a six pack or a four pack (I don't know how they are packaging this stuff since I tried it at a bar)."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a good sized creamy brown head with good lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, molasses, raisins, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is similar, chocolate, raisins, and a bit boozy. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, slight bitterness that lingers. My favorite from SA so far, well done."
"O - A decent beer, but not the best Imperial Stout."
"I'm not a fan of this beer. It was a long time coming, and you'd think Sam Adams would know what it takes to bring a RIS to the market that can stack up, but unfortunately there are many better ones out there. Nice try, but next time spend a little more, make it better, and charge a little more. People will come..."
"This RIS leans on the bigger, less subtle side of the field. Not the most balanced either, but it's got an impressive character nevertheless. A memorable beer that might just make some RIS fans outta your average Samuel Adams Boston Lager beer drinker. Or not."
"D = This is a pretty easy beer to drink for all the strong flavors."
"Nonetheless, a ton of gratitude to JaBier for hooking me up with this bottle."
"smells of dark fruits, coffee, and chocolate. some roasted malts, but nothing really amazing. tastes like your average chocolate stout. roasted malts and roasted coffee, some dark fruits, some chocolate or licorice. full bodied, not very impressed. May have drank it too cold, may have been a bad day, but i didnt enjoy it more then your average stout"
"Very good, very very good for the price. However, it goes without saying that there are probably better options within this style."
"D) Quite good. Tasty but a bit bitter for me. Plus high ABV makes 1 bottle enough."
"D- My personal favorite of the Imperial series. Pretty easy to drink."
"Drank easy for the style & ABV, one of the breweries better offerings IMO"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no obvious lot code or expiration date. It pours dark brown to nearly black with an impressive brownish-reddish foamy head. The aroma is full of roasted chocolate and/or coffee. The mouthfeel is creamy. The taste is a decent balance of hops and cocoa and it packs a punch at 9.2% ABV. Pretty powerful brew and fairly consistant with the style."
"The flavor profile of this beer is a bit rough around the edges but generally solid throughout. A good brew, one worth trying."
"M/D - very creamy & flavorful, decent carbonation, a bit too boozy for me"
"Pours black, totally opaque. Nice creamy head with good retention and lacing. The smell was overpoweringly sweet, more toffee than chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel, perfect carb. I felt like the brew was trying too hard, and was not a well rounded imperial in taste or aroma. Too many things stuck out to make it very enjoyable. It would go from very sweet to bitter with a very bitter, roasted aftertaste that I found undesirable. I would not drink again, and can't really recommend it."
"Nikki"
"This is a good stout. I think it is capable of competing with some of the better stouts, but definitely not top tier. The mouthfeel and booziness were its biggest weakness, but still worth drinking and enjoying."
"D: A decent example of the style, though the alcohol taste is a little offputting."
"D- This is a strong stout. Very flavorful, warming due to the high alcohol also. It is good, but I think it is a tad heavy and I love stouts."
"Looks pretty black to me, no highlights or edges at all. A dense, dark brown cap formed during the pour and fell very slowly, leaving behind a ton of lacing, basically coating the glass. Solid big stout aroma, lots of caramel and toffee, coffee and roasted malt, a bit of burnt malt and alcohol. Moderate to low bitterness with a rich malty texture. A bit of mineral dryness from the dark grains. Kiss of green hop flavour. Sweet caramel and roast throughout with mild alcohol in the finish. Full bodied with a creamy texture and low carbonation. Mild warmth. A solid stout. Pretty drinkable for a bigger beer."
"D - good, but a little on the boozy side. I've had other RIS that did a better job hiding the 9% ABV. maybe it is a little young, but has been in my fridge for a few months."
"Recommended"
"It's black as the devil, not a hint of light going through this, and a thick brown head which lingers for awhile. Rasputin would be proud, the nose hits with booze, coffee and paritcularly anise undertones, but the alcohol warning is there. the flavoris all this and more taking some time to roll across the mouth you get Anise, powerfull and purpley rolling to chocolate and finishing with a terrific coffee bitterness. Jim Koch is really reaching for greatness on this one, and while I've had better russian imperials I haven't had many, and I'm a fan of the style."
"Dark, almost black with a thick dark cocoa colored head that settles slowly and leaves sticky brown lace on the glass. The nose is rich and malty, coffee, semisweet chocolate and anise are all present. The flavor is like molten fudge with a charred coffee bitterness struggling to just balance the flavors, and it succeeds. The flavor complexities are fully realized when allowed to warm up a few degrees. The mouthfeel is nice and viscuos. The finish is a little dry and chalky with warm alcohol. I am really impressed with the quality of this brew, SA really knocked one out of the park with this one."
"This is one thick and full flavored brew, I'm not sure that I could have more than one in a sitting."
"overall, this isnt a session beer, but the style never is.Very enjoyable"
"Drinking this one right now. Pours an inkly black, with just a bit of brown visible around the edges. Thick mocha head that fades quickly, but leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of somewhat fruity yeast, slightly citrus/earthy hops, caramel malt, and alcohol. Tastes similar with less hops and some chocolate notes. Quite smooth, but definitely takes a back burner to the other great imperial stouts out there."
"D-good taste. Like a lot of Sam's beers you have to appreciate the introduction to a style that the brewery brings. Not the greatest in the catergory but a good representation nonetheless."
"No way in hell I could have another one of these, too thick of a mouthfeel and there is better stouts in general. Overall though this is a decent stout made from SA."
"D - This was an ok imperial."
"Pours very dark, thick and syrupy. The frothy brown head is gone pretty quickly with little lacing. Smells of roasted coffee and semi-sweet dark chocolate. Mouth feel is creamy, smooth and very tasty with a little bit of bitterness. For a Sammy, it was an unexpected treat. I liked it a lot. Reminded me of the Stone 12th anniversary bitter dark chocolate oatmeal stout but a bit less smokey. I'll be getting more."
"Color was pure blackness with a fine brown head. Can't say I polished this one off until well after dinner ended, but drinkability is very good anyway."
"D: All in all a pretty decent beer. I wouldn't go out of my way for it but definitely wouldn't turn one down."
"Poured a nice black color with a small tannish head and decent carbonation. Nose is roasted malt and chocolate. taste is smooth, amazingly smooth for 9.2% ABV RIS. It was light chocolate, roasted malts. Not to complex but tasty. Mouthfeel was medium, not that heavy and drinkability is good. As compared to most RIS I could drink more of this than a Stone IRS due to its smoothness."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for an RIS, but really only something I'd buy if I had no other RIS options, which, given Boston Brewing's distrib., might end up being the case at some point - if they keep brewing this."
"D- I was able to finish a 12oz bottle, but the strong alcohol presence prevented me from wanting to crack open a second one. For some reason, I wasn't expecting an imperial stout from Sam Adams that needs some time to ""cool off", but here we are."
"You'd better be up for this one!"
"D - Despite being 9%, this is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is not very apparent in this beer. It's a big beer in flavor, so it's a sipper. I think I am going to need a second job to keep this in the fridge."
"Impy from the boys in Boston..."
"D- despite the high abv this beer is a surprise to me. I could really pound these back without knowing how drunk i would be in a matter of an hour."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Flavor is different on this. I'm a little disappointed. There's definite big coffee presence, but it's overly boozy. Finishes slightly bitter, but the alcohol just makes this undrinkable for me. One bottle's enough for me tonight. I'll let the other bottles age a bit so the ABV might lessen a bit."
"D- Quite drinkable. I felt it was a bit boozey and not so complex."
"Thick, pitch black liquid (if I can call it that...) with a mammoth crown of sticky, brown foam that takes a while to settle. Head is the consistency of meringue. Nose has some roastiness, alcohol, dark fruit, and caramel/molasses, but isn't pungently strong. Big, heavy and creamy sweet, but not cloyingly so. Would be if not for the balancing toast and bitterness. Hefty espresso and resinous hop both make it through the heavy body. Definitely some astringency to this as well, cutting through the smoothness. Definitely a sipper. If you like RIS, this is definitely worth trying."
"Overall- Not bad, just a bit too sweet."
"I felt it was really sweet and other than that I did not have any complaints."
"I'd describe this a lighter version of an RIS. Not too heavy or complex, but sweet and drinkable. Recommend trying one."
"This is the best Sam Adams beer I have had to date. Very suprising how good this is. Poured an opaque black with a sand colored head that faded to a bubbly film. Smells of coffee, little chocolate, and hoppy. Taste is good, hoppier than I was expecting but not hoppy like a Bear Republic BBS. Still very tastey. I'm catching some green olives in the aftertaste also. . Some coffee and chocolate in there as well. Fairly thick feel to it. Overall this is a good beer that is pretty widely available. I would probably pick this up again. ."
"Wow this beer suprised me. After trying the imperial white, i did nto expect to like this one, but its good. The nose is weak though, i barely smell anything, jsut some chocolate, weakest nose of any big stout i have ever had. Beautifil beer tho, huge mounded chocolate colored head, sheets of lacing. Wonderful well rounded tastes, hops cutting trhough the chocolate notes, some toffee in there as well, smooth mouthfeel. I really like this beer. Ilove wheni get suprised like this."
"D: A solid offering. Glad to see this one around, and I'll be getting more."
"D: Medicinal taste and harsh malts aside, decently quaffable brew. Not much of a sipper because I don't really want to savor this. Not recommended if there are other imperial stout options available."
"This is not one of those beers that I ""can't see why"" others like it. I imagine if you were expecting certain flavors or you really like thick sweet stouts, you could really enjoy this. I, for one though, won't be purchasing this beer again in the near future."
"Samuel Adams Imperial Stout pours an opaque black with a dark brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a little bit of ""dark"" fruit in the aroma. There is also some of this ""dark fruit in the flavor as well. Bitter chocolate and a touch of coffee are also present. Not the best imperial stout I've had, but decent and worth a try."
"An impressive offering from Sam Adams. A very solid RIS, will definitely try again and perhaps even try aging."
"drinkability - rather low - maybe 5+ years might take some of the booze and carbonation issues away"
"This is OK but isn't all that great. RIS but lacking in many respects."
"D-This is one awesome Impy..I did a blind taster with this and Central Waters Impy which is also very good and this was by far the more impressive beer in body, big flavor, aroma etc...the CW was tasty but seems like a regular stout next to this. This is a great creation by Sam Adams...."
"M- This gets a 4 simply for its style. who doesn't like the mouthfeel of an RIS? However, it is not as full-bodied as I would like it, and it may be slightly over-carbonated."
"Seems a little thin for the size. Carbonation seems a bit high as well. Lacks depth, but still pretty tasty. Worth trying."
"Mouth as stated before overshadows everything as this beer is a carbonation bomb. Overall drinkability suffers because of this. Will be re-reviewed if in the event this isn't a problem again."
"drinkability could be a touch bit higher with some more age on it...didn't have one of these fresh when i first bought this 4 pack...still a bit boozy, but to drink a few of these shouldn't be a problem"
"By far the best Sam Adams ive had. Favorite to day was their Boston Ale (not Lager)."
"This poured opaque black with dark tan head. It smelled like black licorice and bitter dark chocolate, with cooking vanilla and oak. It tasted like semi-sweet chocolate and black licorice, with vanilla oak and alcohol and roasted coffee. Sweetened some as it warmed, to create a bit more balanced flavor. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was a surprisingly solid imperial stout, which was easy to see a high level of effort that went into the brew. It had a nice scent and taste, and great body. The alcohol was a bit hot, so this beer was definitely for sipping. But some age might help mellow this out and build a bit more unique character. It's not a terribly complex beer fresh, but it was clean and very enjoyable. Well done."
"Pours basically black with a sandy brown hint of a head. There's no light getting through this one. The smell seemed a smokey wood, chocolate, and molasses mixture with alcohol overtones. Very rich and smooth flavor. For me, the chocolate dominated and the smokey flavors that ensued were quite pleasing. I'm typically not much of a stout drinker, but there is something about this beer that just hits my taste buds the right way."
"A very drinkable beer overall and a winner from Sam Adams!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a small amount of carbonation."
"Poured thick, black and dense. Large head of amber-brown foam formed, then settled into about a 1-inch collar. Leaves much lace in the glass. Not as full on the palate as the pour suggested. Lingers nicely. Noticeable forward bitterness. Notes of chocolate and cardamom and dark roast flavors. Reminds me a little of Westphalian dark rye bread. No spicy notes, though. It appears a little short on the palate. Definitely not moreish. Not for sessions! One will be enough."
"MF/D: This is where the beer was lacking in my book. Way over-carbonated for my liking...also, a little too bitter for my personal taste, but I respect that"
"D: A good brew. It's not Founders KBS by any means, but its a good stout. I enjoyed it. I'm compelled to keep drinking it, but I couldn't pack them in by any means. I could see myself getting more."
"D - Although I wish the flavor was less sweet and more malty, this is very drinkable with the alcohol well hidden."
"This has all the hallmarks of a fantastic Imperial Stout. It may lack a bit of cohesion. But all in all, it's a good one."
"Taste and mouthfeel more of the same as this medium-to-fullbody goes down smooth and creamy. Taste mostly roasted malts, along w/ some breadiness, balanced w/ coffee and chocolate which gives this beer some sweetness. Possibly some molasses or syrup as there is a decent stickiness to the beer. A textbook stout - nothing superbly amazing but a great sipper that one must try."
"Drinkability: It's good sipper, not great, but certainly worth a try or two. I am willing to get on board with this one."
"D: Okay, take away the astringancy and I would really enjoy it."
"alright I'll be back got to finish this brew-Ha...Alright Im back the beer all in all was pretty enjoyable. Thought it was a good american version of the RIS. Warming, filling and flavorful. Yet I've had better RIS in the paste. Recomended might buy it again but if i see Rasputin i'll grab that instead."
"D: A really solid interpretation of an Imperial Stout for Sam Adams. I could definitely see myself keeping a few of these in my fridge. It's nothing fancy, not gonna rewrite the history of beer, or even the history of the stout. But, It's a good beer, if a little on the simple side. Could use a little more complexity. That said, I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied."
"D - This was a very good Imperial Stout, very drinkable and made for sipping, you cannot go wrong with this beer if you like the darks"
"Bottle from Monument in Concord, CA. Pours tar black and thick-looking with a half inch milk chocolate head. Strong lacing. Smells of chocolate covered cherries, dark biscuity malt and fruity ethanol. Big, thick and chocolatey flavor. Cocoa bitterness, strong alcohol mixing with chocolate and a well defined hop bitterness. Maybe just a little hot, but otherwise very nice. Big and thick. Drinks well, S.A. impresses."
"Definitely not a session beer but, of course, that is not its purpose. A good sipping imperial stout that warms the stomach and caresses the soul."
"D - surprisingly easy to drink and an excellent first crack at the imperial stout by BBC"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades at a moderate pace, with lots of legs and average lacing. Aroma is rich deep dark grains and alcohol evident. Taste is syrupy sweet upfront with the dark malts, peeks of fruit in the middle, and a warming alcoholic close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good for the style. Kind of cutting edge for Sam, not trying to be a gateway brew like so many of their other styles."
"I'm very happy I got to try this beer. For the money its a pretty good deal. I didn't expect too much going into the tasting and left extremely satisfied."
"This is an excellent imperial stout and one of Samuel Adams' best. Well worth seeking out."
"Pours thick and black. A mocha tanned head forms on top the invincible black body about an inch thick initially. The nose is very charred and smokey, I swore it smelled like a baltic porter. A bit of chocolate is found, but the smokey aroma prevails here. In the mouth, it's a little smoother than other big stouts. It has a rich flavor and feel without going over (apologies to Bob Barker), and the alcohol is hidden well. Rich chocolate flavors hit first, liek drinking Dove chocolate. A little smokiness and wood add complexity. Very warming in the throat and tummy. This is a good imperial stout, but its pricetag may scare away the everyday consumer familiar with the brand (but maybe not beer geeks ;-)"
"D--Nah, drain pour for me. Joins the ranks of Triple Bock and Cranberry Lambic as the worst Sam Adams beers"
"Pours pitch black with hazy dark brown edges. A thick, very dark brown head sticks for ages, finally leaving a wide stripe of lacing behind. Smells of very sweet caramel malts, black licorice, taffy and pine. Tastes a bit cloying at first. Underneath that exist some toasted malts, nuts, faint dark chocolates, alcohol and grain. Goes down big, somewhat smooth, and a little dry at the end. After a few drinks the sweetness becomes overkill. A decent RIS in all respects except the one that really counts; the one that ends up destroying this beer."
"A tasty initial burst of toffee, earthen hops, and dark chocolate gives way to roasted coffee, mocha, and sweet booze. Notes of raisin rum and hops linger in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, full-bodied (but not syrupy), and packs a superb carbonation level. I really dig the flavor profile on this beer; it's complex, yet not so over-powering that I couldn't see myself enjoying more than one in a session. Easily the best beer in the Sam Adam's lineup beside their Hallertau Imperial Pilsener."
"Pours a dark black color. One inch head of a dark tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is really smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt up front, then a good amount of alcohol, some sweet malt, slight hop in the background, and some very slight raisin flavors. Overall, a really easy drinking Imp. Stout. Good body and blend of flavors, and the alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering."
"This is the kind of beer I prefer to round the night off with rather than drink all evening, although I have an urge to try a glass of this with a full English breakfast in the morning. I'm pretty sure I'll be spending an hour two flaked out on the sofa afterwards."
"d: This was my second from the Sam Adams imperial series. The double bock was outstanding, while just seemed to be a bit strange to me. We live in a beer world inundated with fantastic big stouts. I don't see myself buying any more of these."
"D- Not bad, Sam Adams did a great job with this beer. Definitely worth a shot. Recommended!"
" By the way, the bottle says 9.2% ABV."
"Poured into my SA glass a thick black color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy tan head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is sweet, malty, some nice chocolate/toffee notes. Medium body, nice creamy brew. Drinkable, the ABV 9.2% is hidden very well, recommended."
"Drinkability- This brew is heavier than even it's 9.2% ABV denotes. Too big for more than one. Overall, kind of disappointing for what my expectations were. It was brand spaking new and probably needs significant aging to take the edges off."
"D: Nice drinkability with a big flavor that was boozy and dark roasted yet comfortable enough to drink a few of."
"Verdict: Imperial Stout is another solid beer from the new Samuel Adams Imperial Series. Miles ahead of the Imperial White, and a shade better than the Double Bock, this is my pick from the collection. Well done Jim, this is great stuff."
"D: delicious beer but hard to drink, but that is typical for this style. It's not a session beer."
"D- Really good beer that I look forward to having again."
"Drinkability - A nice drinkable imperial stout. Has a heavy alcohol presence, quite good."
"Drinkability- A very well hidden alcohol percentage yet still definitely a sipping stout, very nice example of the style not the best stout in the world but it is a very solid offering no doubt about that and would make a great nite cap to end a long day,"
"Overall a masterfully crafter Imperial Stout that surely hits all the marks. I don't think I've ever felt a brew so creamy straight from the bottle (without nitro widgets). I'd be proud to serve this to my friends on a cold winter's day/night. Good stuff for sure."
"I bought a four pack for $10.99. The ABV on my bottle says 9.2%. This is a perfectly beautiful beer. It poured out like dirty motor oil as a rich brown head shot to the top of my glass. Bubbles cascade downward as it settles and a sticky lace is left behind as the head slowly disintegrates. Sweet and burnt malt as well as licorice are the most prodominant aromas my nose picks up. Heavy and thick but not syrupy. It tastes like expresso, burnt Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate, and black licorice. There's a bitter but not too unpleasant aftertaste. The ABV and strong rich flavor limit this beer's drinkabilty but it's a perfect sipper. Strong black coffee drinkers should love this beer. It's pretty damn good."
" two thumbs up for tradition."
"D: I wasn't impressed with this one. The alcohol isn't hidden well and the flavor is too strong in the wrong areas."
"Overall, a gigantic beer that could probably stand a couple more years in the cellar."
"This was passable, but given how many great stouts are out there, I will probably pass it by if I see it again."
"ETA: Unfortunately, that funkiness in the aroma, leaves my review lower than what I genuinely feel this beer deserves, however I don't feel right altering any scores as the smell WAS off. That said, I would put this more in the A- range overall."
"Another excellent product from Samuel Adams."
"D- This beer doesn't have a lot of complexity but the charred malt flavors are big while other parts are a bit thin in the finish. As the beer warms a bit more alcohol comes through but not much else in the flavor does. Perhaps age might change this beer if there are more flavors underneath the big bitter black malt."
"Fairly easy to drink. Once would be enough for me in a night."
"I am usually below average for Sam Adams, but this impressed me. For the price this should not be passed over. Very easy drinking for the style, perhaps a great gateway for people to try a great style of beer. Kudos Sam Adams."
"Overall this is a good IS, though I'd stop short of calling it very good. That being said I'm always impressed with the quality of SA beers when considering the sheer volume they produce. Worth a shot."
"D - Lower because of the price and because there are other RIS out there that are better and less alcohol. Still a very good example from Sam Adams. Probably the best Sam has offered in a long while."
"I'm glad I grabbed a few bottles and may even go back for more, but it's not something to actively seek out. Try it if you see it though."
"Poured a very dark brown, nearly black, with a nice thick tan head that stuck around for a while. Good lacing. Good start. Strong licorice aroma with burnt barley and wood. Molasses and mocha with dried fruits round it out. Not the most appealing, but still good. Then, the first sip... ehhh, what happened? Weak mouthfeel, some may say even ""watery"" for the style, considering this is an Imperial Stout. Noticeable carbonation gives it a harsher feel as well. As for the taste, the molasses and burnt barley are most prevalent. Second-place is the alcohol and raisin flavors. Some soy sauce in the finish. Its not awful, just unbalanced."
"EDIT: This beer got better and better with each successive bottle. I might buy this again - we'll see."
"2.5 D: The constant presence of the alcohol and the thick chewiness make this a not so drinkable beer even though the taste isn't bad."
"D- Easy drinkin' stout here. Sam Adams has done an awesome job on this style. So smooth rich and complex. 9.2% give it balls and it's hard to detect."
"Bitter dark chocolate, medium hops, and heavy dark fruits (cherries, figs?) provide the impetus here. The texture is thick and rich but still can't quite corral the alcohol. The aftertaste is a tasty melange and the hops get theirs back. Overall, a decent, well made RIS/Double. Like most SA products, this is good but not quite top notch."
"Pours an inky dark brown, nearly black, colored body, with a big brown colored head, lasting. Good lacing too. Chocolately roasted aroma, alcohol too. Some good chocolate and toffee aroma. Not an overly strong aroma. Nice chocolate taste, creamy mouthfeel. Reminds me of Stone RIS. Some alcohol on the backend. A good chocolate milk taste but with some bite to it. Wow, this is pretty good. I'm interested in seeing how this ages. Very tasty. Definitely will buy again."
"Pours an inky, opaque black with hints of translucent brown shimmers alongside the edges of the glass. A respectable head marches up the glass before surrendering to atmosphere, leaving only a film of residual bubbles. Nose is solid. Dark stone fruits, bitter chocolate, toast. Across the front of the pallet, bits of burnt brown sugar, dark cherry. Then a butterscotch transition into a bitter, dark coffee and toast. Alcohol burn on the swallow that dries up mouth. Creamy texture with plenty of body. Solid."
"The feel is smooth and oily and viscous. Really dark but bitter and sweet. Balanced, strong, delicious."
"The Imperial Series just showed up in town so thought I would give it a shot. This one pours black as night with a 2 finger head. Foam is dark and does not want to go away. The aroma is robust with malt, maple and dark chocolate. Kind of tingles the nose. This is a hearty beer. Taste starts off semi sweet but then the roasted malts take over and there some decent carbonation going on. Seems like every other sip I get some fig or other fruit finish before the dryness ends it all. As far as drinkablity it's not bad. Has somewhat of an oily finish, kind of sweet and the alc % doesn't keep reminding you it's there. Kind of reminded me of Strom King but not NEAR on it's level. I did enjoy this though."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and smooth very nice liked this brew alot especially from such a big brewery i could drink this for a while has great drinkability with the lower percentage on the imperial it is kinda nice but disappointing at the same time."
"This is an enjoyable sipper! Alcohol could be hidden a bit more, but it's not unexpected for an abv of 9.2%. Nicely balanced and fairly complex!"
"The aroma is almost meaty with touches of bacon and maple syrup, chocolate, and burnt malt. The appearance is black is with a huge head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin for the style. Overall it's a well made beer but it does not do anything great."
"Beer poured into a Rochefort chalice is black as night. No head on this one but a thin, dark brown film rims the top of the beer and looks delicious. Smell is an enticing menage of dark chocolate, molasses, and roasted malts. Taste is dark chocolate up-front, in the middle and in the finish. Finish also brings a peppery tinge with some roastiness and alcohol warming. Sticky and chewey on the palate; I had no problem finishing this beer. A pretty good RIS that was pleasantly better than I expected."
"I really enjoyed this beer, but it made me feel dirty. Something about Sam Adams brewing an Imperial Stout didn't seem right, like if my sister where in playboy. Weird."
"This is a really good stout. One of the better Sam Adams that I have had. Highly recommended."
"Overall this is a pretty good Imperial Stout but not one of my favorites. Something about the molasses/dark fruit combo just doesn't appeal to me all that much. It's also a bit on the sweet side. A solid brew, definitely worth trying, but it has a pretty premium pricetag on it so I can't even say it's something I'd keep on hand. Storm King is superior and cheaper, and there are others I'd prefer as well."
"One of the more impressive beers to come from Sam Adams recently, not really in the mood for an imperial stout tonight but it was still good, would drink again, recommended"
"D: Good go to stout. Still a bit hot but should age nicely."
"Not as smooth as other Imperial Stouts I have had but a good try."
"D-Good flavor, but the harsh alcohol and minimal chocolate and roasty characteristics seems not quite perfect for the style. A bit of aging would perhaps make this beer interesting and help smooth out the alcohol."
"Eric"
"D- A smooth stout that needs to be sipped. I enjoyed it but with so many stouts on the market i fear this may get lost in the mix. I'm interested to see what a year does to a bottle."
"The taste of roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate, with a hint of dark bitter sugar and coffee are flavors that jumped out on the palate! We balanced for all the components. One of the better stouts so far this year. Hurray for Boston Brewing Company! There beers only get better and better!"
"Pours a nice jet black with dark brown highlights at the top of the beer. Lovely, soft and thick layer of dusty brown foam after the pour. Rich, creamy and dark roasted malts with some warm alcohol that lends a slight charcoal aroma. Vanillin zucker mixes with robust French roast coffee and 60% cacao dark chocolate. Theres some creaminess mixed with a smooth abv. in the finish. Very smooth and silky smooth malty palate. Great nightcap sipper."
"Pours nice, thick, and black with a nice deep cappucino colored head. The head is rather short lived and there remains just a bit of lace on the top, but there isn't much lacing on the glass. For the nose, I get a light chocolate and roasted malt sweetness. The small is nice, but nothing special when compared to other imperial stouts. The flavor is good, but lacks the complexity of the RIS's that I have come to love. The beer does have a nice thick and creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. I only bought 1 bottle as I wanted to try it, but I wasn't disappointed as my expectations were rather low. I probably wouldn't get it again, as there are plenty of others of the style that I would choose over this. Overall, I enjoyed it and it isn't a bad beer if you aren't able to find other more enjoyable imperial stouts!"
"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam which recedes slowly into a thick, firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste is a lot like the aroma. It is bold, and well rounded. I would be no means say that this beer lacks depth, but it doesn't have that extra complexity that makes for a great imperial stout. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice Imperial Stout, and it is even nicer to see BBC doing some bigger beers. All in all, this beer reminds me a lot of a cross between Lion Stout and Old Rasputin. It has all the roasted malt and graham cracker of Lion Stout with the well rounded higher (but not to high) alcohol of Old Rasputin. I would certainly drink Samuel Adams Imperial Stout again when in the mood for a large, but not overpowering stout."
"Pours nice and thick, almost a solid black, even darker in the glaass, but the head is short lived and there's no lacing. In the nose I get a lot of caramel, some burnt sugar, light chocolate and plenty of roastiness. Not really much in the way of coffee. Smells OK, but could use some more roasted malt and a bit more coffee that I've come to love out of RIS's. Really not a lot going on in the flavor. Sure it's loaded with roasted barley, some hint of caramel and chocolate, but that's about it. Rather one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer, nice thick and creamy, richly textured, low carbonation. I'm on the fence with this one. It's not bad by any means, but can't touch the best of this style. I can think of 15-20 RIS's I would rather have. Uninteresting really, and probably won't be buying it again. I'll take a 4-pack of Old Rasputin for $2 cheaper any day."
"Pours black and opaque with some purplish notes as well (or just reflected off the cool purple label). Smells like anise, chocolate, coffee and alcohol. Taste is bitter yet sweet. There's a good presence of roasted malt flavors, with vinous fruit/alcohol and flowery hop flavors as well. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation level is mild, but on for style according to my very limited impy stout experience. I only had one bottle to drink, but would have had more if available. I like beer."
"This is quite enjoyable. Drink it without expectation."
"This is a decent beer from Sam Adams. It's a little overpriced, but I encourage people to try it at least once at a bar."
"Minor flaws (if you even want to call them that, as they aren't flaws per say, but more so personal style preference differences) this is a nice beer that is actually one of the easier drinking imperial stouts around. The one thing I'd certainly do is tone the alcohol presence down a bit, as I think it'd bring out the other flavours a bit more. Regardless, this is a nice bigger, bolder brew from the BBC."
"Thick head for the pour with a really dark black appearance. Patchy lacing and eventual thinned out head. Roasty aromas with mixtures of chocolate, coffee, toffee, malts and grains. Even with this great mix, it was a little thinned out I felt. Taste was great; bitter cocoa mixture with a good sense of earthy, toffee tones. Creamy mouthfeel gives it a nice milky texture throughout drinking. Overall, a neat dessert-like beer from Sam Adams."
"Pours out a thick black brew with dark tan one finger head. Sweet dark chocolate scent slight hop scent . Taste of slight chocolate and slight odd alcohol type flavor that lingers in your breath. Mouthfeel is good,,not totally chunky but feels almost right. Drinkability is good , this beer has its moments , the alcohol isnt disguised too well and its of an odd flavor."
"D: Only average for an imperial stout. Chocolate flavor dominated a bit too much and, although good, wasn't great."
"D: The bottle I had stated an ABV of 9.2%. Not a bad option as far as Imperial Stout are concerned, but this would not be my first option."
"MF&D - Thick as motor oil. Warming throughout. Nice change of pace, but I couldn't drink more than 1 or 2 of these in a setting."
"D: You can certainly tell it's 9.2% ABV. One and done."
"Pours a deep onyx black with a full two finger dark brown head that slooowly falls to a creamy layer of foam. The lacing is picture perfect, spiderweb like all over the sides of the glass. Smell is extreme sweetness with raisins, plums, and some licorice. Alcohol and fudge find their way in the nose as well. I could use a bit more in terms of roasted aromas and smokiness though. Taste starts off with a bit of a coffee bitterness, gooey chocolate sauce, and molasses. Licorice and some piney hops midway, this is definitely a fresh IS. Aftertaste has more of the dark fruit aspect with dates and figs. Once again though, could use more roasted flavors, but good overall. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a thicker feel. Carbonation is low making it slick in the mouth, ehhh. The sweetness is a bit much which takes away from the drinkability. Not a bad IS, but I could see some time vastly improving this beer in just about all characteristics."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full. The carbonation is low but works well. The flavors are long lasting. This beer is about 9% roughly but leaves my glass faster than I expected. Overall this beer is a sucess. Well played Sam Adams!..."
"I should have rated the stone RIS it was a year old and has become my standard."
"With all their resources, I can't understand why Boston Beer can't create examples that better rival the smaller guys. Good effort, but I was expecting more."
"Drinkability is likewise excellent. Good flavor that is not overpowering - the flavor doesn't become cloying. If it wasn't for the high abv, I would definitely say I could drink this brew all night. I probably could, but then I'd be on my ass after a few hours of pounding these. One of Sam Adams best in my opinion. (And a helluva lot better than the Imperial Double Bock)"
"Overall, this is a decent stout, but it didn't do much for me."
"D - Very drinkable, well done to Boston Brewing!"
"Very sweet and fruity. Perhaps this is one needs to age a bit. The alcohol is also a touch hot and takes away from everything else."
"I'm not quite sure what's going on here, but it triggered a lot of bad reflexes that I would prefer not to get from a beer."
"D: Not bad for a big beer. The syrupy consistency will slow you down some."
"Overall, I'm surprised this is coming out of Sam Adam's. It's really not any better than my thrid attempt at homebrewing. While I'd like to say this as a compliment to myself, it's really said with a feeling of disappointment in SA. Not a bad beer but it could have been so much more."
"Dark, dark brown with a milk chocolate head. Smell is roasted malt with a bit of molasses--a little funky, though, maybe a bit of steel? The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and syrupy--not as heavy as some imperial stouts, but plenty viscous. The taste is pretty good if not super exciting--some roasty malt, some bready taste, just a touch of brown sugar. The numbers I'm giving suggest that this beer isn't as good as it actually is. Compared to most beers, this is a good brew. But compared to the seasonal release, imperial stouts of other microbreweries, this one is only average."
"I'm happy SA decided to put out an Imperial Stout and I'm very pleased."
"I was really impressed by this big stout from Sam Adams. I do like their Cream Stout, this takes it to another level of creaminess and thickness. I am definitely going to get more of this beer."
"Notes: Really great Imp. Stout and it makes me want to seek out and try the rest of the Imperial line."
"A very nice impy stout."
"Inky dark brown with a formidable, tall, dark cardboard head. Great lacing. Classic double stout nose of charred malts, roasted coffee, licorice, chocolate, and dark fruity alcohol. Roasted malts and coffee bitterness up front. Dark chocolate, scorched fruits, and caramel sweetness mid-palate. Strong hop bitterness in the finish, along with a warming alcohol bite. Pretty good. Full-bodied, with smooth feel. A nice addition to the Samuel Adams' line up."
"D - For an RIS, this was far more drinkable than most, but I am getting use to my RIS' being much heavier, ala Stone's."
"D - This was a pretty good RIS, good but not great. It is definitely on the chocolate side, which is not a bad thing."
"A: Sluggish pour, thick brown espresso-like head, some serious viscosity to this beer - 4.50, S: Aromas are evident from a couple of feet away, lots of roasted chocolate malts, reminds me of powdered chocolate milk mix, some sweetness that suggests carob and dates - 4.00, T: High alcohol is evident, nice hop bite, lots of caramelized molasses and roasted grains, some burnt flavors also come through on the palate - 3.75, M: A touch on the side of being gritty - 4.00, D: A nice sipping beer made for a cold winter evening - 4.00"
"drinkability - Pretty good I have had better on Imperial Stouts, seemed syrupy, oily when it went down. Worth a try."
"D: great sipper and a unique tasting brew. A good Imperial Stout"
"D- solid brew. The lack of bitterness as you keep drinking it is kinda awkward and reduces the drinkability."
"Over a decent imperial stout. Not my favorite but not a bad Stout for the price"
"D - This is a pretty good imperial stout. I had higher hopes. I hope it is better with some age."
"D: A real nice Imperial Stout, the flavours are akin to an Abyss, but at a much cheaper price tag. One of my favourite new stouts."
"The taste is even better than the smell. This is a very well done imperial stout. All the flavors meld well together. The roasted malts and molasses/coffee flavors really work. This is very creamy and velvety smooth to drink. This is a very well done imperial stout that I'll definitely pick more up of if I come across."
"Ulitmately the beer fares well. The fruity notes balance out the roasted notes well for variety, complexity, and imagination. The textures are fine but lack the rich smoothness that I have come to love in the top ranked Stouts. Boldness and assertiveness is kept in check respectively speaking."
"Drinkability- Well done!"
"Overall, not bad. I definitely had better RIS."
"Overall impression: This one is a little too hot for my tastes, all alcohol and not too many flavors."
"D: Tastes great to me. I think I have a new favorite Sam Adams brand beer."
"Pours a very dark black color with a small tan head that quickly fades away. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. I smell roasted malt and alcohol. Has a burnt malt flavor. Mildly smokey with anise and tobacco hints. A little too burnt for my taste. Finishes with fusel alcohol flavor. Has a nice thick, creamy texture. But with the burnt, smokey flavor, it leaves a feeling in my mouth like I just smoked a cigar. It is a big, bold stout. Just not one that suits my tastes."
"Tastes strong of alcohol and anise. Also there is a taste of chocolate. reminds me a bot of dogfish's chicory stout only without chicory and alot of anise. HAs a bit of an alcohol burn with it Not unpleasant tasting and goes incredibly well with a few pieces of dark chocolate. Certainly one of Sam's better offerings."
"D: Very nicely done. There's nothing new here for a seasoned imperial stout drinker, but for someone new to the style, it's a good introduction without being too overwhelming. Thumbs up, Boston Beer Company!"
"Poured a thick, opaque black with a milk chocolate colored creamy head. Aromas of roasted and burnt malts, molasses and hints of black licorice, with a mild alcohol nose. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick for the style. Tastes of burnt malts, alcohol, and molasses, with hints of chocolate and espresso. Nicely balanced with a mildly sweet finish. Overall, I think Boston Beer did a good job for the style. It was better than I anticipated and average for the style - there are definitely better ones out there."
"D= ok. Not my favorite imperial stout but still pretty good. I prolly won't buy it again but I am happy I tried it. Decent"
"D - A very drinkable imperial stout (almost too drinkable for its own good). This is an excellent beer that I may try to save up for a vertical tasting."
"-Dotson"
"Pours a dark brown with a thin espresso head. The nose has licorice, molasses, roasty malts, alcohol and piney hops. Taste is also on the bitter/roasty side. Alcohol presence a bit hot. Medium to full body is a bit under carbonated. A decent stout from Sam Adams. Definately one of their better brews."
"Tastes good. Feels good. Not so easy to drink. Like many amazing technical wonderments it's hard to swallow."
"M/D: Full bodied, very viscous, low carbonation. Decent drinkability for such a big beer. Overall, a pretty good imperial stout. Taste is perhaps a bit too sweet at times, but overall it's solid."
"A different take on an RIS than say, Old Rasputin. Flavor is milder overall, with a definite sweet aspect. Alcohol comes on hotter than expected, but this offering remains a worthwhile RIS."
"This was quite a suprise coming from Sam Adams. This is (so far) the darkest beer I've ever had. It was pitch black with no light being able to penetrate the lovely blackness. It pours very well leaving a very dark brown head and simply reeks of heavily roasted barley. To taste, one notes very strong coffee, chocolate and caramel notes. It is incredibly smooth and quite easy to drink. Simply astounding."
"D - Like most Sam Adams beers (in my opinion) this is not bad but not outstanding. I'd drink it if there were no better options but this isn't one I'd seek out."
"This baby is 9.2 ABV and it tastes like it. The alcohol def comes through. I give Sam Adams credit for ""pushing the envelope", but for overall enjoyment of this style, I'd go with a Samuel Smith Imperial or Oatmeal Stout."
"D: very easy to drink, the flavors aren't overpowering and are subtly good"
"Glad I only picked up one of these. Not satisfied with it at all. Drainpour."
"This is a good, solid, and accessible Imperial Stout that could be more ramped up in the flavor. Yet on the whole, this is a fine effort from Sam's, not at all a surprise. Well done."
"D - Although very well rounded, the butteriness of this brew becomes quite rich, especially as the beer approaches room temperature. This intensity detracts slighty, but overall this is an enjoyable RIS and up there with some of the best I've had. Though it can become quite sweet, the relative absence of bitter, roasty, coffee notes is quite welcome."
"This beer has a beautifully lingering toffee head, and color of the beer is that of the moonless night. The smell is that of fine dark chocolate, heart roasted malt with a hint of alcohol. The alcohol disappears in the taste, and although not very complex, very smooth for an Russian Imperial. Espresso and chocolate malt are present along with a host of other subtle fruit flavors that avoid my pallate. It is very drinkable, which could pose a problem at 9.2 abv. Smooth mouthfeel finalizes this beer as great, and beats out other varieties of Imperials that insist on NOT being classy with their alcohol presence."
"This is a good beer and a decent stab at the style. If you like Sam Smith Imperial, try this. I'd rather just have the real thing for the price."
"This ale pours out of the bottle a very dark brown. It appears black in the glass with a average sized light tan head. Nose offers up potent notes of brownie, grape & black licorice. After tasting it seems really out of balance, overly sweet, needs quite a bit more hop. Lacking in body. Seems incomplete. I had higher hopes for the entire Imperial Series line."
"I was impressed with this. I didn't go in expecting that much from it but it's actually much better than many RIS I've tried. Very true to style. Pick one up for sure. I think they would be a great candidate for some aging."
"Notes: This is an incredible brew definately to be enjoyed during cold winter days. This beauty will warm you up. Cheers."
"More creamy tasting than the smell would indicate. Still, this could be a coffee stout. No notable alcohol taste or feel. The body is lower than most stouts, but not dramatically so. Great and lasting aftertaste of dark chocolate and coffee. Touch of chalk."
"D - A borerline average imperial stout drinkability wise, but the smokey coffee-like flavor made it better and more interesting than most. I would probably not seek this out even though it has basically good drinkable characteristics"
"A very average imperial stout, too sweet, with the classic stout flavors taking a back seat to the alcohol."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The flavor profile is fine, and the beer is easy to consume. I'm definitely more impressed by this one than the White, but maybe not the bock. The Impy White was a flop, the Double Bock was pretty good, and this one falls between the two."
"My second Sam Adams beer today. First was the Blackberry wit. They continue to come out with well-crafted, interesting new beers like this one, while placing them alongside pedestrian offerings like the blackberry."
"A nice sipper brew at 9.2% ABV and one of the better Sam Adams offerings I've had in some time."
"P St. Whole Foods/$8.99/4-pack"
"Overall: A great drink for a cold nite. Not the most powerful imperial stout I've had but a for the price a great one!"
"Not something I would purchase as I was not impressed with the taste."
"asos, good buy for $9 for a 4 pack."
"Pours a solid black with a good sized mocha head that dissipates quickly. Smells of cocoa and chocolate syrup, a bit of alcohol, some dark fruits as well. Taste is boozy chocolate syrup up front, plums or figs or some such fruit midway melding into some hops followed by a roasty grainy finish. Mouthfeel is sticky and creamy, body is thick, carbonation is a little on the high side for a stout. Overall I though it was a good drink. It's still kind of hot and I think the flavors need some time to meld, but I think a little time on this might make it fantastic."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass. Pours a deep opaque black with a thin tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves very little lacing. Aroma is a subtle mix of all the usual suspects; roasted malts, espresso and cocoa. The taste is a nice smooth blend of roasted malts and bitter cocoa. The beer is a smooth and the 9% alcohol is very well hidden. This is an enjoyable Imperial stout, but there are certainly better ones out there."
"Man this thing is black. The head is gnarly TAN CREAMY AGGRO. From there on things wind down with the expected aromas and flavors of dark chocolate and coffee and all the roasty grain intensity etc. Full body with a bitter burnt malt finsih that I find to be agreeable in my current circumstances."
"Overall: This was actually a not too bad. I think this beer could definitely be improved upon, but again...something I might try again. Cheers!"
"I wasn't expecting a lot, but was hoping for something. I didn't get it. I must say that for Sam Adams it's decent, but I won't purchase again."
"Blipped ""Stackolee"" by Samuel L. Jackson...motha f**ker!!"
"EDIT: you MUST let this beer warm before consuming. it improves."
"A good dense, cold weather sipping stout."
"Pours nicely. Thick frothy brown head. Totally black. Nose isn't that vibrant IMO. Flavor is thick. Molasses, tar, roasted tones. Too much molasses for me, but it's still nice. Thick liquid feel. Carbonation is lower but nice. Nice enough to drink. A bit too tangy and too much molasses."
"D- The flavors mask the abv well. Easy to drink. Could see myself buying it again in the future."
"This beer is a little too heavy to be called sessionable, but certainly worth trying many times."
"Comment: Didn't do much for me. I felt the taste was unbalanced and at times all over the place."
"The beer is decent and interesting to see SA produce, I wonder if a year in the cellar would tame the warmth a bit?"
"Overall imperssion: A young, hot, Russian Imperial Stout. Knock down the carbonation and set it back for a few months and I think you are pretty close to having a winner. I thought this needed more time to knit itself together. Not bad but there are so many other great stouts that I can get locally and in six packs for the same price. I really wanted to like this beer but I probably won't try it very often simply b/c of price and how many great local stouts I can have."
"Update: Year and 8 months later. Does seem to be a different beer now. Smooth, velvety and all of the flavors blend so smoothly."
"Poured nicely with a 2 finger head.. completely black..im not seeing any light through this stout. Moderate lacing of the tannish foam. 1st smells of roasted malts with some chocolate, and smoky fruit?, but not overpowering. Tastes of coffee..dark cocoa. Mouthfeel is great: thick, mild carbonation, coats the tongue nicely. I think Sam Adams does a nice job of trying to bring a wide variety of brews to a mass market. Id drink it again but i think id take a Founders or Arcadia Ales IS over it anyday."
"D: A great sipper"
"It appears to be completely filtered, but I'd imagine that it would still age well, or at the very least, hold up for quite some time. Any oxidation would probably only lead to more bready flavors in the malt anyway. At the price they're putting this out, I'm buying more!!!"
"Poured a dark black color with a large sized brown head. Nice lacing left on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roastiness, anise, and licorice. Tastes of roast, chocolate, caramel, licorice, some dark fruitiness, and anise. Alcohol content well hidden."
"Jet black with a decent head. Leaves some great lacing. Inky, somewhat of an elderberry aroma to it. Deep, deep dried fruit flavors upfront. Very sweet tasting. Quite low roasted flavor-I was expecting more. Missing some of the graininess and roasted flavors of a RIS. Decent mouthfeel. A good RIS but not great. Rather sweet for the style. I was expecting a lot more from SA but this is still good."
"Pours a four finger brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Totally black color. Chocolate nose. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet chocolate and hints of anise, lingering anise aftertaste. Decent stout. $10.49 for a 4-pak of 12oz bottles from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"A good amount of residual sugar resides in this brew and is very cloying to my palate. Caramel and sweet chocolate flavors with only the slightest hint of coffee. Black fruits undestinguished. Good complexity but if not slightly thin in mouthfeel with a bit of alcohol in the mouth. If not for the sweetness would be much better. The mouthfeel is almost sticky."
"Not as big and bad as many RIS I've had, its a good introduction to many who wouldnt have tried one from a smaller brewer. Glad to see this will be readily available."
"D: Too heavy for more than one, but it's not meant for that, anyhow. You can nurse a bottle for awhile."
"12oz bottle from The Liquor Shop in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours an opaque black body with a good inch of tan head. Chocolate and caramel dominate the aroma, with some coffee and hints of citrussy hops. Caramel, coffee, and chocolate dominate the flavor, sweet and tasty. Rich full body with moderate to high carbonation. Super tasty, full, no flaws to speak of. Delicious. I hope this becomes more widely available."
"Cheers..."
"D: Eh. For an imperial stout it's not bad for 9.2% but it's not just good enough to want to get any more."
"Excellent murky brown to black color with a small head and some lacing. Smell is rich, malty. molasses...extremely inviting. Taste follows suit with a richness of malt and molasses....burnt malt finish..creeeamy! Extremely smooth for high abv...I can only imagine what it will be like after aging. As above, this is so smooth and drinkable it belies the abv. Definitely in my top ten...keep it up!"
"This Sam Adams Imperial Stout is a nice surprise. A strong smell of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted grains greet the nose. A good pour with a medium dark head that drops a bit too fast. A real nice flavor contrast while the head remains. The taste compliments the aroma very nicely. The mouthfeel for a stout is a little thin to my taste. All that being said I find this to be a pleasure to drink. I will definately buy this again in the absence of my favorite stout."
"Drinkability: A drinkable Imperial Stout, the high ABV is moderately masked. If this were on draft, I may get it, but I have had better imperial stouts"
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness/vintage info...come on now, the label says ""age it", how about some dating info? Anyway, rant over, this one pours Imperial stout dark/almost black, under the expected dark tan head, froth, film and leaves light and fine tiny spots of lace. Nose is full of dark chocolate, espresso, chocolate milk and burnt grains. Full flavor, heady stuff @ over 9%. Nose carries nicely into the tongue sensations, more dark, dark chocolate, roasted grains and dark coffee. Thick and smooth mouth feel. Real nice job here by S.A. Impressive."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite Sam Adams Imperial. Solid all around. Highly drinkable for a RIS, especially with the over 10% ABV, yet it remains balanced and doesn't try to do crazy things, which lets the flavors all come together well."
"Nice beer, not a stellar stout, but well done. Age this some and it might be amazing. Glad to see a successful brewer continue to experiment and push the envelope of their line."
"D- the strength of this one, is a deterrent from having more than a couple of these in a sitting. its nice to see this new line coming out from boston beer, and even better that its going to be year round. ill check this one out again."
"D - This is a decent showing by Boston Beer despite it being out of its ""normal"" zone. This one is worth another try ."
"overall a good beer from sam adams...i am impressed...just a little underwhelmed with the mouthfeel and the sweetness...if this beer was cleaned up it could be a steallar imperial stout"
"Some very promising flavors going on here within a pretty good balance; however, the alcohol intensity is too readily apparent. I can imagine that putting this one away for a few years would really allow the alcohol to mellow and the other, already strong, rich flavors to really shine."
"M: This is a big beer. Fairly interesting and well made. Body and abv make this a good one and done."
"12 oz. Near black pour, dark tan head. I was surprised by the lacing and retention of this one. Roast malt but mostly chocolate aroma. Taste is a little more expansive, roast malt, nut, but dominated by chocolate, molasses and vanilla. Settles into a rather creamy mouthfeel. Descent finish of a mocha coffee. Found this enjoyable and drinkable. Almost a dessert beer because of the sweetness, would be nice if there was a little more balance. Southern Tier Choklat is the thing I would most compare this too. Suprisingly good brew from a big brewer."
"D: A good to decent homebrew at best. Way too sweet. It almost seems out of style."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. Again it really did remind me of good homebrew. Nothing really stood out as excellent but it was good all around. Hopefully they will continue with their imperial series."
"An excellent stout. It's nice to see Sam Adams moving towards a more craft beer market. I've always enjoyed their product before but now with a this husky bodied stout and the imperial pilsner in the lineup, consider me a super fan."
"Pours a jet black with a huge brown foamy head that leaves great lacing. The smell isn't as strong as other stouts,but you can still pick out dark fruit,alcohol,and chocolate. The taste has coffee,alcohol,chocolate,and dark fruits. Not bad,but nothing all that great either. The m/f is heavy with the flavors mixing well,but it is alittle harsh. Not a bad beer from Sam, but there is room for improvement."
"Not a bad entry into the RIS domain by Sam Adams. I've tasted licorice in these before, but the amount of anise-like flavors in this one is higher than average. Overall a good RIS, worthy of comparison to the incumbents. Recommended."
"1109"
"Drinkability: for the style this one is extremely enjoyable since the alcohol levels aren't in your face. IMHO, this is one of the best beers from Sam Adams."
"This beer was a syrupy-looking black brew with a small orange/tan head and a tiny bit of lace. It had a bittersweet chocoloate and roasted malt aroma. A nice espresso bitterness, also some chocolate and dark fruit. More bitter than sweet, a pretty good stout."
"Pours a dark, dark, black with a large head for a stout that sticks around. Had a faint hint of coffee and even berry? Strong taste, as expected from the style, a good sipping beer. Not up to par with Rasputin, and a bit more expensive, perhaps worth a try. It is interesting that Sam Adams has now marketed itself as a micro..."
"D- A very rich beer that requires a bit of time to consume. I was not expecting this much of a sipper out of this. I am impressed, but also pretty numbed."
"My expectations where met with a solid drinkable beer."
"12 oz. bottle served in my New Belgium goblet. Poured one shade shy of black. Opaque with a one inch, dense, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipated into a quarter inch consistent cap. Spatters of sticky lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Nose indicates anise (a little too much), a roasted quality, some alcohol and mocha. Taste follows nose; anise continues to be too up front for my liking. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but carbonation is a little overstated. Some acidity is revealed towards the finish. I found the texture to be a little thin and watery; lacking the viscosity of great examples of the style. This is a solid offering, but anise is too in the forefront of the brew; however, alcohol was well-hidden."
"Chewy and syrupy on the tongue. Full bodied with a slight hop bite in the finish. A really nice RIS. I began judging this as an American Double but the bottle clearly indicates this as an RIS, so my judgement reflects this beer in that category."
"Pours dark, with a lacey, dark brown head. Really liked the smell: Notes of chocolate, some berry. The taste is where it lost me: A light maltiness (some coffee) which disappered after passing the palate. It was drinkable, in fact almost TOO drinkable. Disappointed with the body. When I hear ""STOUT"" I imagine a full bodied beer. This one was thin, indistinguishable. High alcohol content is un-noticable."
"Overall, I think this is a good release from Sam Adams, and truly their darkest of all time."
"Pours the darkest of browns...almost black.Thin brown head with good retention and excellent laceing. Aroma is of dark chocolate,roasted coffee and malts. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is a milky mix of roasted coffee,chocolate,and dark fruits. Littl bit of a bitter edge make this one excellent stout!"
"I poured the bottle into my favorite snifter. It was opaque black with a nice dark brown head. The taste was surprisingly dry, with very much a dark, dark chocolate flavor. No milk chocolate here. I didn't find it at all sweet, but had a woodiness that was kind of interesting and nice. Overall I enjoyed it very much, although I expected more fruitiness and more of a hint of the alcohol contained therein."
"Though it lacked some of the core qualities I like in a RIS (BIG flavor mixed with smoke, burn and some char), it was still very nice. I added some drinkability points to this review, as it's cheap for a RIS and easy to find. I will buy more of this and throw it in the cellar - I bet this would really improve with some age/mellowing on it. Nice work, Jim!"
"Out of a bottle this beer look like used motor oil when I poured it into my glass. The two-fingers of head was cocoa colored, retained well and laced in sheets. The aroma was of chocolate, toasted malt, butterscotch and alcohol. The flavors were rather dry, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, spices, roasted malt, alcohol and some citrus rind bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel was slick and tongue coating. It was also a little rough, the body was full and the carbonation a little too high and prickly. Not a bad brew but the mouthfeel needed work and the alcohol was a little too transparent."
"Drinkability: The alcohol on this one is a little apparent - though not up there for the style at 9.2% - and the flavors decently interesting, really pretty unusual for a RIS. Quite the Boston Beer Co. touch. I'd be happy to try this one again, though I don't know if it's going to become a fridge staple."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable and strong beer. Good for anyone who wants to try an imperial stout. Its good that a large brewer, like Boston Beer, is taking chances like this."
"D-Far from the 1st imperial stout I would reach for and to be completly honest it just seems to be more of what sam does best a great gateway to the style."
"Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. In a way this seems to me to like a ramped up version of the chocolate bock. As far as food pairings go, this beer would go better either with or as dessert vs. pairing with hearty fare."
"Sam Adams Imperial Stout is a lot more subdued than imperial stouts than I am used to. It is easier to drink than most, because the taste is more balanced and a lot less of an alcohol taste than normal. Although, the brew does not have some of the strong and great tastes of others of its style, it is more drinkable because of the good balanced taste."
"9.2% ABV. per label.Good to see SA branch out and make a foray into this style.Poured into a snifter an oil slick black with a minimal cappuccino (like the bottle says)colored head that is gone rather quickly.Aromas of charred dark fruit and black licorice,dark roast coffee and a bit of wood as well.Flavors are heavy on the black licorice with molasses and dark fruit quite prevelant as well,a nice bit of raw earthiness in the finish as well.A solid stab at the style,just all around good."
"If you like the style, you'll like this one. Not the absolute best one, but it's better than many. At $10 per 4-pack, the price is right, too."
"D: Very drinkable, even for the amount of alcohol it has. All the flavors were extremely well balanced and the perfect amount of them."
"D: I could do a six pack of this.. A pretty decent imperial stout, for a pretty fair price. This isn't going to beat a lot of other imperials on the market, but damn good if you're in a quick fix for something dark. Plus with the availability of Sam Adams, this will be an easier one to pick up where selection is bad."
"D: For me, very highly drinkable. The alcohol does not show through on the palate to spoil the flavor. It's hidden so well. I am more of a sweet stout fan than dry and bitter, so this one hits the mark for me perfectly. This is a hit for Samuel Adams in my book."
"Overall this beer was pretty good but not going to buy it again."
"Not a bad example of an imperial stout. Strong and needs a bit of aging. Otherwise, it's par for the style. Could be creamier but hey, I don't brew the beer. I only review and enjoy it. Pick this up but I recommend buying a bottle instead of 4 bottles at once."
"Very different from any Imperial Stout I have had. Pours like motor oil with a light caramel head that disappears quickly and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smells of brown butter, burnt caramel and dried fruit. Tastes the same with the addition of black licorice, not much in the line of hop bite. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. I wouldn't call this a session beer considering the alcohol content, but I could get down a couple."
"D: I find myself a little up in the air on this one. It's got good qualities, and I find myself enjoying it... especially slowly (and at 9.2%, it's the appropriate way to do it, I suppose). At the same time, I almost feel like something is missing, but I can't put a finger on it - the flavours are fine and develop further after each sip. The aroma is lighter, but offers a reasonable complexity in the scents. The body is thick, but not overdone. Outside of the appearance coming across as a little uninspired, it's a pretty solid beer. It might be that it's the slightest bit hot... perhaps a little age would do it good."
"Overall, Jim Koch you crazy saaahhhnuvabich, I didn't expect this. awesome beer, great job."
"Not a terrible Imperial Stout, but just tastes...unrefined. I'd like to see this one with some age on it to let the flavors meld together a little more. There's just not that much to this one. It looks beautiful, but goes downhill from there."
"Strongly roasted, full of bitter chocolate. The chocolate is probably the strongest characteristic the beer brings, it tastes just like baker's chocolate. The roast malt is dark and harsh, but not overbearingly so. It counterbalances perfectly with the dark chocolate. Little bit of hops at the end adds to the mix, leaving a lasting sweet bitterness that just lingers. Nowhere near the boozy taste of the other 2 Imperial Series beers, the alcohol content is neigh undetectable. For me, this is pretty close to fresh BBCS. Not the most amazing impy stout, but very solid. My favorite of the 3 new Imperial Series from SA by far."
"D - With the great presentation, aroma and medium body taste...it is overall a good Imperial Stout. Definately a slow drinker. I would reccomend this beer to a stout loving friend, but for the $10/4-pack and thin mouthfeel and heavy CO2...I will not buy it again."
"Not bad at all. Pretty good, really, but a little off the mark. I wanted to rate it a bit higher because there was so much going on in it, but much of it was lost underneath the smoky/roasty intensity. Some age would likely do it some good. Wouldn't hesitate to have it again, and if I could get my hands on it in my part of the world, I'd age some."
"I recommend you try this one, but is it the best Imperial? Or even the top 3? No."
"BBC's Imperial Stout's an okay beer. Easily above average, but not quite what I was hoping for. It runs a little too warm and is a little convoluted in terms of the flavor. I'd be interested to see what happens with some age on it. It really could improve. Who knows? It's definitely worth checking out, but it's a little bit of a disappointment."
"Pours jet black w/no head and minimal lacing. Looks super thick. Nose is cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. Taste comes on a little hot, with a strong roast flavor with strong amounts of licorice. Is fairly thick, but not as thick as it looks. Loses some heat as it warms up and gives additional notes of vanilla and wood. Not the best Impy stout I've had, but not the worst either."
"Notes: A solid stout. Bottle says it's 9.2% ABV. I believe I paid $9.99 for the 4-pack, which is more than what I pay for 4-packs of Old Rasputin, which outperforms this beer by a good amount. Recommended, but I wouldn't call it world-class."
"great brew. I think a lot of the S.A.s have a distinguishable taste but this one does not have that typical S.A. signature. I think that this is a good thing. I love S.A. and this is just another reason to love this brewery. dark oil can appearance, nice dark tan head, taste of coffee, coco, and sweet malty goodness. Mouthfeel is good but not super smooth. you can't be disappointed with this one."
"D - While the alcohol being less perceived makes it more drinkable, I feel as if some time down in the cellar would do this one justice. I would like it to be a bit sweeter. Even though it's a different style, this is how I felt about their double bock (the original). Then I tried a three year old bottle that was amazing, the malty sweetness was out of this world. Only time will tell with this RIS..."
"Grabbed a single of this new beer from Sam Adams tonight at Sav Mor in Twin City Plaza. Good pour brings out a black color, with a decent amount of brown foam heading. Nose is of Belgian chocolate, licorice, sweet cream, fudge...very very nice. Taste is fairly rich, with chocolate and espresso notes. It starts off sweet, and ends on a mildly bitter coffee note. Medium body for the style, but it makes up for it in taste, still feels big to me. Pretty quaffable, I like this Impy Stout from SA. Next time I will go for the four pack."
"Notes: +1 for Jim Koch and the rest of BBC. They are really pushing the bounds of what can be a readily accessible big beer. The taste might have missed some of the hidden gems you often find in a good RIS, but overall a good accessible beer for the big beer lover."
"Drinkability was a let down. The meaty and banana aroma scream yeast abuse, which is really surprising for the pros at Boston Beer, they've got plenty of experience brewing big beers. And the flavor is muddled, nothing shining through. Both recipe and technique suffer. I'm surprised they decided to release this and declare that it's a new, permanent year-round offering without apparent public tastings first."
"D - I find it to be a really rich beer, definitely a slow drinker. It's a great value for the price (9.99 for a four pack) and I will definitely buy some again."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a frothy 2 inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee, dark/bittersweet chocolate, licorice and a bit of smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I can also taste some oak/wood (even though I'm pretty sure this beer isn't barrel aged). It also has a good lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's rich and a bit creamy. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. It could be smoother, but overall it's still an enjoyable brew. I think it's a good beer, hopefully SA will decide to make this again in the future."
"over all a great offering from s.a. can't believe it took them this long to release an impy stout. nice work."

"d - For an imperial stout it is highly drinkable. Can't wait to see this in the bottle."
"A great Imperial stout that is not too hard on the pallet. A bit smooth and also packing a pit of a kick. This is a new brew in Samuel Adams new Imperial series,"
